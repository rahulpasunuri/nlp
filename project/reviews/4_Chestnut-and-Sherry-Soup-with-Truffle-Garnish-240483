I view all recipes as merely starting points / general guides but a few points cannot be missed here. 1) make sure you boil everything off between steps 2) keep stirring 3) immersion blender uber alles! 4) jarred chestnuts are just fine

The sherry and chestnut is a genius combination. I'm planning to serve this as a starter on Thanksgiving.

I wish I had read the review by vmascitti just below before I made this. I agree that the flavor was slightly too oniony. I also used white truffle oil instead of the garnish. (after coming up empty handed at four very well stocked gourmet shops and an Italian store where nobody speaks English, I could not find truffle juice). The one big mistake I made was not straining. Dinner was behind schedule and I just needed to get things moving so I used an emersion blender. (shameful but true). The flavor was very rich, decadent even. I think the sherry and wine and truffle overpowered the chestnuts so I will have to play with it next time. Overall, this is with a try, and probably a couple of tries to get it right.

I used Williams-Sonoma jarred chestnuts - a great time-saver. Upon completion we felt it a little too 'oniony' tasting (probably because the shallots I used were quite large) and needed a little something. We added 2/3 cup of heavy cream about 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and simmered for another 40 minutes to reduce it. I did not make the truffle garnish but did drizzle with a little white truffle oil when serving. Fabulous. The straining is an important step; don't skip it.

Very time consuming, a lot of work, but well worth it. This is my go-to soup for special winter dinners. Making it this Thanksgiving!

I have made this recipe at least a dozen times. I usually exclude the white truffle garnish; as a college student, I find most of the people I'm cooking for aren't discerning enough to notice its absence. The chestnut prep has caused me a great deal of trouble, and I even went so far as to purchase a ridiculously expensive chestnut shelling tool (totally useless). I very highly recommend the already prepped chestnuts from Trader Joe's. They're something like $5 a box and you need several boxes, but chestnuts aren't all that cheap anyway, particularly when they're out of season.

This is a delicious recipe! Under pressure, I was unable to find my recipe for chestnut and fois gras soup so I knew epicurious was the place to check for a suitable replacement. This recipe did not let me down! I used peeled chestnuts due to time, but her technique for peeling chestnuts is spot on. It is important to follow the directions...ie. you want to take the time to reduce both the white wine and sherry and cook the chestnuts long enough so the soup is not gritty.This recipe can be labor intensive, but well worth the effort. Thanks Traci!

This was wayyyyy too much work for an okay soup. Too sweet. Handling the chestnuts is a nightmare, lots of the chestnuts were moldy and I bought them at a premium shop. It went over okay at my dinner party but I'd never make it again.

I think this is one of the most decadent soups I've made. Nonetheless, the chestnut soup didn't add much to the truffle butter for me. I also think the truffle butter would be amazing with various types of meat as a kind of gravy, especially cooked with pan jus. If you're short on cash, add potatoes instead of chestnuts. Keep the truffles though - I can't imagine it's worthwhile otherwise.

this is very good, very rich. I forgot the shallots and replaced the chicken broth with veg broth. I also just used truffle oil mixed with butter and chives, which was great (although i bet the juice is even better). Roasting the chestnuts takes a long time. The recipe took almost 4 hours of continual work, but next time I will buy jarred chestnuts.

The truffle garnish, while mostly butter, adds quite a bit to the soup; if you don't make it, yeah, you miss a fork. The soup itself is outstanding. Mine actually came out a bit thinner than I expected, but the flavor is exceptional, and unusual. There's a great deal of sherry flavor, but the chestnuts add a rich and special taste to it. We're lucky enough to live in a place where they still sell roasted chestnuts from stands, in the old European tradition, so we saved a lot of time on the roasting step, but I still think it would be worth it if you had to roast them yourself, and it would probably still be good if you used pre-cooked or canned chestnuts. We made this dish for New Year's Day, and everyone wanted to take the extra portions of soup home with them! My next search is for a chestnut creme soup; I had some at a local restaurant that inspired me to make this, and while this was OUTSTANDING, it still comes in behind the creme version.

Interesting. Something everyone should try at least once. Mine came out a little thicker than I would have liked, but my guests... and baby loved it. I didn't do the truffle garnish.

Absolutely delicious! The flavor was full & rich but not at all heavy. Definite hit with everyone. This is a keeper!!

This was really easy to make. Last Thanksgiving it was a hit, and I think I plan on making it again. Using good quality, cooked chestnuts (not cheap) makes this recipe a whole lot easier and it's really worth it!
