Watch the heat -- I followed this exactly, and mine burned between the 45 min. to the hour mark.

After making this recipe and experimenting with multiple uses, my husband and I have decided vadouvan is magical. The shrimp recipe was easy and had great depth of flavor - good enough for company! We've also substituted vadouvan for almost any recipe that calls for Indian spices, using 1/4 to 1/3 cup vadouvan in place of about 1 T of curry and half an onion. Vadouvan-instead-of-curry eggplant was outstanding, as was Best Recipe's Chicken and Rice with Indian spices. Make a double batch and try it with anything!

This recipe is really amazing and versatile. We made the Fricassee recipe that the Vadouvan accompanied in Gourmet and it blew our minds. We had enough vadouvan left to experiment with. Vadouvan was a big hit in the meatballs we made for a cocktail party. Give it a try. Don't omit ingredients, cook it attentively, and you too will be sold. 5 forks to make up for people who overcook and then blame the recipe.

The right spelling is V A D O U V A N.

Jamie's pureed carrots with vadouvan sounded wonderful on Top Chef, so I gave the vadouvan recipe on Epicurious a try. Twice. I followed the recipe exactly (except left out the cloves because I hate cloves) and it burned badly before the hour in the oven was up. I therefore tried again, keeping the onion pieces larger and making sure to just let the onion mixture get golden brown in fry pan. But it started to burn again in the oven, so I turned the temperature way down. I'm not sure how the end product is supposed to look or taste, but I'm not impressed. Lots of work for a mess of dark brown, dried out caramelized onions and garlic. The spices smell wonderful, but the taste is nothing special. Any ideas on what went wrong?

I am going to the store to get ingrediants; this sounds great! To Thesu; picky, picky. Is that your entire review?

I don't get the spelling either, BUT the vadouvan, while time- consuming, was outstanding. Made it with the shrimp/orange juice recipe from the Gourmet online site and guests loved it. It adds a deep, rich, meaty, mysterious note. Recipe made a lot, so I put it in 1/3-cup ziplocks and froze it for future use -- and there will be lots of recipes coming out of my kitchen with this "gold"!

You spelled vadouvan wrong.
