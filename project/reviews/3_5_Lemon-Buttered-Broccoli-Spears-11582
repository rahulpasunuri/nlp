Not too bad... watch the lemon, don't do what I did.

This is a very simple and yummy way to spice up steamed broccoli, but obviously nothing out-of-this-world.

This was easy to make but it was missing something. We did not really like it. Sorry.

Most certainly the easiest and most tasty way to prepare a quick side of broccoli. Great nutty, lemon flavor.

Definite winner. Suprisingly yummy!

So simple and so delicious. I finished off with a dusting of fresh parmesan cheese. This one is a real crowd-pleaser. I will be making this far more often from now on.

Great! I substituted olive oil for butter, added more garlic, and then watched in sheer delight as my carnivorous husband polished off a plateful! I'm so happy that this good-for-you veggie can be dressed up without dairy.

I added several cloves of sliced garlic to the butter, decreased the steaming time and increased the saute-ing time to give it a bit more punch. My boyfriend (who several days ago told me that eating broccoli is a chore) ate a small plate full.

A good variation to plain broccoli. I sauteed spinach in a similar way and was pleasantly surprised with the result.

This dish is simple and easy to make. It is good, but nothing special. I would probably make it again if I was in a rush.

This was the perfect vegetable dish to serve with teriaki salmon. Very quick and delicious.

I'm always looking for new ways to dress up plain vegetables and epicurious is the place to go. I have never been disappointed by any of their recipes. Keep up the good work. By the way this is a delicious dish, I served it with pot roast, mashed potatoes and yorkshire pudding. Even my 2 year old loved it.

Didn't think it was anything special but a nice change.

Easy and delicious-- I'll do this everytime instead of just steaming it plain, now!

Great recipe and works well with green beans, too. With the green beans, I add in garlic with the butter, cook off till garlic is lightly browned, and then throw in 1/2 of a lemon, squeezed, warm through, then pour over the beans through a strainer. Very easy, very tasty for a holiday or big crowd meal, and very fast, too. Sprinkle on toasted pine nuts for a little texture just prior to serving if using broccoli if you want a change. My 3-year-old loves this (we call them "trees with nuts").

Nice and light. The lemon gives it that extra bite, without losing the broccoli flavor.

my husband was nervous when I said lemon juice with broccoli but delighted when he tasted it. delicious and healthy.

Very simple yet elegant!

Simple, but divine. Works very nicely doing the first part of the cooking in an electric steamer.

Very simple but classic. Add a little parmesian cheese for a change.

Wonderful flavor. The next time I would save one pan by melting my butter in a cup in the microwave and then drizzling it over the broccoli in a serving dish.

Fresh broccoli spears are so tasty that its almost a shame to cook them, maybe just par-boil them to set the color...just dip them in sour cream or pour the lemon butter over them and they are delicious as a snack.
