I thought this - especially the dressing was amazing. I made a few modifications: Used 2 cans of tuna - 1 in water 1 in water and oil. Tuna: mixed in ahí dulce (but red peppers would work also); stuffed green olives; and about 1/2 tsp. of mayo to make it stick together. Dressing: added 1/2 tsp. dijon mustard; 1tbs mayonaise; 1 big jalapeño; juice, carrots and onions from jalapeños; cracked black pepper; and 1/2 a small white onion. Mixed with other ingredients called for until smooth. DON'T use water from tuna - oil only. Salad: used romaine; added chopped carrots; put toasted wheat bread on sides and put the tuna/tomato mix on top of the lettuce and carrots, then eggs, then dressing. Amazing.

I thought this deserves 2 1/2 forks (between good and delicious). I made it exactly as stated, and served it as part of a summer dinner buffet. I thought the cumin was essential in giving the salad a little "punch" of flavor.

I really dig this recipe, easy to prepare and perfect for a picnic. I also like it with cottage cheese and hard boiled eggs. I've made it without the mint, but it's really best with. I call it "Poor Man's Salad Nicoise" or "Nic Salad". It's very popular with my friends.

this was delicious...and really inspired. where do these so- called self appointed "experts" on everything come from? Why would one "get out" the food processor? Duh... most cooks leave it out so that we can USE IT. As for blabbering away without trying the recipe ... go to McDonald's and tell them your story and leave the cooking to the cooks, please.

i really enjoyed this salad. I had no beans, and only stuffed olives, so I tossed a couple in the dressing, along with a couple of sun dried tomatoes. I also added cottage cheese under the tuna. I scaled down to two servings, and it was perfect proportions.

I added some anchovies and three hard-boiled eggs (quartered) and the salad was great. But if I were going to make it again, I'd skip using 1-2 cans of the tuna....it was just a little too "fishy."

I do think calling this salade nicoise is a bit misleading, but the problems end there. It's a delicious salad. I had left over marinated green beans, so left them intact. But the addition of mint is inspired! And I added lemon verbena just for heck of it and liked that too.

Very tasty- interesting combinations of flavours. The use of the tuna water was a very good idea. I used less oil. This was a very filling salad, and an excellent addition to bbq fish. I also agree with the comment made about actually trying out the recipe before making disparaging remarks.

This is a delicious salad. I used water packed tuna (and used the reserved tuna water where the recipe asked for oil,) & less oil in the dressing. We didn't miss it. Great flavors!!

I liked this meatless dish. It worked really well as part of the buffet menu from the magazine. I would par boil the string beans before cutting them however as that would enhace the flavor. I would also pit the nicoise olives so guests did not have to do that.

I've just read four reviews criticizing a recipe that not one of the "reviewers" has bothered to prepare. Please try things out before you write in with a critique. When I'm considering whether to make a dish I would like to know what people who've actually made that particular dish feel about it. Thank you!

This is not a very good recipe. A classical Nicoise salad does not require everything to be mashed up in a processor. Thumbs down on this

The dressing on this Nicoise was interesting. We cut down the portion size and substituted quartered hard boiled eggs for the tuna, and steamed aparagus for the green beans, added radishes. Much less tuna, when used, is appropriate for us.

Why would you get out the food processor to chop 6 ounces of green beans?

It isn't Nicoise salad at all. Call it something else, please. The tuna addition is a horrible choice! The original salad was just fine: mix equal parts of diced potatoes and French beans. Season w/oil, vinegar, salt & pepper. Mix with anchovie fillets, olives, capers. Garnish w/quartered tomatoes, sprinkle w/chopped chervil and tarragon. A processor takes character from it. Lettuce belongs into another salad.
