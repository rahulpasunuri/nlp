I tripled the spicy rub and it was awesome.

This was the best meat dish I have EVER eaten. Period. I accidently marinated the lamb for 2 days instead of overnight, and it was so soft and moist, I ate two whole shanks in one sitting. Ask around for a small, local lamb producer in your area for the best, freshest meat.

An excellent lamb shank dish. I score the silver skin on the shanks so the marinade penetrates. I did a half recipe and it turned out perfect. The cooking time for the vegetables was quite accurate. We had this with Orzo with Asiago cheese (on this site and VERY easy). Delicious!

Fabulous! I added a tsp of dash of Mango Chutney to it - gave it a sweet taste.

This dish was excellent, and also quite forgiving...I cooked it the first hour then took it to a friends house to complete the cooking. I made half the recipe, adding an additional cup of broth (making 4 cups total) when cooking the vegetables. The best part was the whole coriander which tasted fabulous. I would definitely make this again.

Fantastic! I have made this several times, and it is a real keeper. I use different vegetables depending on what's in season, and toast the cumin and coriander seeds before grinding just to bring out the flavor. For variation, I have used a large can of crushed or pureed tomatoes, to replace some of the chicken broth (skip the whole tomatoes called for later). It makes a richer, thicker sauce and is my favorite variation so far. If possible, have your butcher trim the shanks and remove the silver skin for you -- it reduces the fat and allows the marinade to really absorb.

Just couldn't get myself to like this one, although my husband did enjoy it. Even with all the spices (and I used extra) the flavor was just so-so to me.

Good flavor. Very tender. I got repeat requests for this lamb. This is one recipe that was really good exactly as written. Times are accurate, and the amount of broth seemed just right, especially if you are making the gravy. A good variation is to replace the tomato paste in the gravy with pomegranate syrup.

This was very good. Next time I will probably add more spices to the marinade. Like another reviewer suggested, make sure to get the marinade under the "silver skin" and next to the meat for the most flavor. The meat was incredibly tender and delicious. The gravy was more like a broth, but the flavor was great. Served with israeli couscous.

Really great recipe. My husband loved it. I didn't do the gravy but did the reduction sauce instead. Great intense flavor and very good served over plain egg noodles. This recipe is a keeper.

Yes, this is delicious, but the herbs and spicies could be more intense. I will add 1/3 more next time I try it. The meat was so tender we are raved! I will also reduce the amount of of liquid . all and all this recipe could be spectacular with a few adjustments. liquid

This recipe is great. Lots of flavor despite the fact that it's time consuming. Next time, I will try to add the vegetables, except for the asparagas and maybe the zucchini, during the last 25 minutes of cooking in the oven. Then just prepare the gravy. Also, I found the flour didn't give enough consistency for a thicker gravy. So I am going to use cornstrach and cold water instead. We'll see...

I made this before reading the other reviews, so I didn't add any extra seasonings. I and my family thought the flavors were great. I toasted the seeds before grinding, substituted inexpensive blade and round bone chops for the shanks, and reduced the braising time to one hour. This is a keeper!

I liked this dish so much that I wanted to give it 4 forks, but something was missing... Maybe I should have added oregano like the other cook from Florida did. I am not sure what it was, but next time I'll experiment with some more flavors. Also, do make sure that your butcher has trimmed the shanks well for you and removed the "silver skin" (that silvery/shiny membrane that prevents the flavors from penetrating the snanks!) I found out the hard way!

Really flavorful recipe, also added fresh oregano and fresh marjoram to the dish. Using freshly ground spices and herbs give this marinade a unique flavor. You'll need to reduce the liquid at the end much longer than the recipe suggested. I used the marinade oil when I cooked the shanks. I strained the liquid and reduced over very high heat for about 10 minutes. This gave me a very flavorful and heavier broth with a deep flavor. Your guests will surely want your recipe.

I love lamb, and had found this recipe to be very good, and quite easy to make. The lamb marinates overnight which is, i think, the secret to its wonderful flavor! The veggies were also perfectly cooked ..... nice combination. overall a 3 out of 4! Delicious : )
