Veyr ho-hum -- it was ok but not something I'll make again.

I used some toasted almonds that I had on hand. I thought I always preferred the toasted nut - but this time I think it overpowered...I will make it again, definitely, but I will use ground blanched almonds, or, perhaps the "flour" that other reviewers mentioned. I also like the clafouti minus the addition of nuts.

First off, I'd like to say I'm a college student with limited cooking equipment. My first time I had ever even heard of clafouti was when my mother (an excellent cook) made it from an old gourmet magazine recipe. My mother's clafouti is a tough act to follow. Regardless, this was incredibly simple and easy to make, with a few modifications. The local supermarket was having a ridiculous sale on strawberries today, so I subbed strawberries for cherries. I also just toasted the whole almonds in the oven for 8 minutes at 350, then added them whole to the milk and blended until smooth in the Magic Bullet. I did not bother to simmer the milk and almonds together and I did not discard the almond solids. I also subbed vanilla extract for almond extract since I already had that on hand. The rest of the recipe I followed as written (just added ingredients the blender and whirred). It was delicious! I can't wait to eat it tomorrow morning cold for breakfast.

Easy and delicious. I made this with Rainier cherries because they were what was available at the fruit stand, and I used 2% milk because that's what I had on hand... otherwise I followed the recipe pretty closely, except I cut the sugar by 1/4 or so and needed to cook it for about 15 minutes longer than the 30 minutes suggested in the recipe. I served it with the buttermilk-lemon sorbet recipe from this site. Fantastic!

I did everything but strain out the almonds--I kept them in for crunch. If I do this again in the future, I'm going to toast the almonds. The flavor and consistency were great. Delicious!

I had always wanted to try a clafouti and this one had the most forks --plus I had some great cherries to use up. I followed the recipe exactly and it was not bad, just boring. Not worth the effort at all. Crips and cobblers are similarly easy and much tastier.

I wasn't really a fan - better than some other recipes I've had, but still not great. The texture was ok (at least it wasn't rubbery!) but I think I would have liked it if it were lighter and a little bit more bready.

Delicious. Skipped soaking almonds in the milk, just used plain milk. Added a half teaspoon of vanilla, in addition to the half teaspoon of almond extract. Used fresh cherries, pitted at home with a cherry/olive de-pitter which I bought for this recipe! Used a scant half cup of sugar. All in all I thought it was PERFECT. Delicious as a sweet end to breakfast...as a sweet end to dinner...just delicious whenever you eat it. I made it twice in a week! My guests loved it.

I made this twice in the last few days. First, with cherries. I skipped the soaking the milk in almond paste step. My clafoutis seem to always come out watery, so I used only 1 cup of milk - still came out a bit watery, but I think that is probably because I had just canned some cherries, and used some extra cherries that had been boiled in syrup. Made it a second time with 1 cup of raspberries, vanilla extract instead of almond, 1 tbsp plus 1/4 cup of sugar, and just over 1 cup of milk - came out quite nicely. 1 cup of raspberries were plenty. If making it with cherries, I would recommend using 1 to 1 1/2 cups, and using slightly less than the full amount of milk. If you have a sweet tooth, use the full amount of sugar, but you don't need it. I've found that in most recipes, I cut the amount of sugar called for in half, and they are usually still plenty sweet enough - and I can justify eating more desserts that way!

I made it for my family who loves good food. It was gone within minutes. Instead of Ice Cream I served it with a lime/maple syrup/2%yogurt dressing. Used half the almond extract, kept the almonds in the dish, added Tahithia Vanilla Bean. Definitly a keeper

This is now one of my all- time favorite dessert recipes and it never fails to impress! We've substituted the cherries for cranberries, blueberries, apricots, etc and each time have been so impressed with the outcome. I don't see how you can ruin this one...but why would you even try?

We substituted rice flour for the wheat flour as one of our guests was allergic to wheat and it was still very delicious. We also added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to round out the almond flavor. Would definitely make this again and would also try with other summer fruits.

I made this recently while on holiday in the South of France. We had a great time going to the market buying the cheeries, pitting them over cocktails, etc. We did not have almonds, so it might have been improved upon - but I doubt it. Pretty great!

Yumm!!! This is a great dessert. I used canned cherries that are pitted, turned out wonderful and very easy.

A delicious, easy dessert that makes a dramatic presentation on the table. I'm an acceptible cook and this dish made me look like a pro. I used pluots instead of cherries as that was the only ripe fruit I could find in my supermarket, still turned out great. Next time I would reduce the amount of almond extract to 1/4 tsp as the flavor was a tiny bit too overpowering, otherwise I'd give it four forks.

I'd never had clafouti, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I followed the instructions but skipped the whole almond milk process--in fact, I skipped the almonds altogether. They weren't missed. There was plenty of flavor from the extract. I liked it. I will experiment with other flavors soon (blueberries? vanilla? coconut?)

Nice alternative to the more commonly served cobbler. I made this with cherries and nectarines and everyone really liked it. I didn't strain out the almond solids, but none of us minded the slightly different texture it gave to the recipe. It seemed a waste of time and ingredients to me to dump out perfectly good ground almonds. I just ground them in the food processor. The almond extract flavor is a bit strong. Some may prefer 1/4 tsp as opposed to 1/2. Overall very nice recipe. I will make this again.

Lovely recipe...love to have this for bunch Sunday mornings. But...DO NOT strain out the almonds. I used almond "flour" (already finely ground almonds)..put in blender, poured the hot milk over it, and blended the whole thing together well. Added the rest of my ingredients to blender, blending after each set. Since I was cooking for 2, cut the recipe in half and poured into a preheated small skillet with a some melted butter, and popped whole think into the over and cooked for 15 min. Came out beautifully in less cooking time. Bottom only slightly firmer than the rest...which was a good thing in my opinion. Will try with nectarines next.

I thought this dish was wonderful, and easy too! I used ground almond meal from Trader Joe's and left the solids in to give it more body. Yummy!

This is delicious. A perfect end to a "Farmers' Market" summer meal. Is nice with a little creme fraiche. I have made it twice. The time factor is in seeding the cherries. The rest is simple and quick.

This was just okay. A little mushy. I wouldn't make it again.

YUM...this is great! Did not steep the milk with the almonds. Just added some almond extract to the milk instead. Great results.

I might try this with vanilla instead of almond. I made it with fresh cherries. I didn't care for it at all.

This was very easy to make and it was good. I used preground almonds to make the preparation easier. I do prefer a less adulterated custard though - without the "almond paste/milk".

Substitute Splenda for the sugar in this recipe to make it low carb. It works fine. The fresh cherries were a delight. Has a bread pudding sort of texture.

To Cook from Vermont -- how did you adjust this recipe to make it low-carb?

This was an excellent and easy dish to make. to make it a little less fattening, I used fat-free half & half instead of whole milk. It didn't make any difference in the taste or texture at all. I used fresh cherries. My husband raved and said it was good enough for the best restaurants.

It was delicious! I used raspberries and vanilla extract. Will try with blueberries next time.

Very simple, quick, delicious recipe. I increased it by 50% for company and made it with a combination of fresh cherries, plums and peach. I even adjusted it to make it low carb! Everyone loved it and had seconds and more.

Clafouti is a funny thing - it tastes historical, like a dish brought to a 17th century French peasantry banquet: hearty, indelicate, and delicious. Just don't go in expecting a creamy custard! Outstanding with cherries; I found the almond extract was a bit intense and will reduce it next time, or do vanilla instead.

I actually made this for a Sunday brunch when I normally would have made a fruity french toast. It was a big hit!

This recipe is SO easy! Very nice, not too sweet. Although, to be fair, I used bluberries not cherries, because that is what I already had. Delicious. Can't wait to try with cherries!

A delicious dessert that was easy to make for a last minute dinner with the family. Will definitely make again!

Made this recipe exactly as shown and took it to a dessert party. Doubled the recipe with no problem. I really enjoyed watching the other guests go back for seconds, and will definitely make this again.

I used raspberries in place of cherries, a great flavor combination with the almond. Aside from straining the almond milk mixture, this was an easy recipe and the results were delicious. So good in fact there were no leftovers to enjoy the next day.
