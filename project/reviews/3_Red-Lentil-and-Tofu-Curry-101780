Pretty sure this is my second time making this. Thought I had reviewed before but can't seem to locate it. Like (seemingly) everyone else, I doubled the spice, did a quick fry of the tofu in the oil. Where I goofed was water ... didn't need 3.5c, heck 2 might have been too much. Poured off the excess (before adding the tofu and spice oil) and devoured. NB: Used ground cumin in place of seed as it was what I had. Blended with all other spices and sauteed for 30 seconds before frying tofu for another 60 seconds.

Made it with brown lentils, so it took longer to cook. But really enjoyed it.

Doubled the lentils, doubled the spices (cumin instead of seeds), used 3 cups chicken stock, sauteed the tofu in the spice oil...and it was fabulous!

Absolutely delicious! I love Indian food but my husband does not, yet he enjoyed this dish immensely and agreed I could make it again, which is high praise for him. I followed everyone's recommendations by doubling the spices and sauteeing the tofu in the spiced oil. Didn't add the coconut milk because I thought it tasted fine without it.

Made some alterations per others recommendations as well as just because I wanted to add some veggies. Doubled spices, used chicken stock instead of water and only used 1 3/4 cups. Added chopped carrots, parsnips and mushrooms to the onions and stir fried the tofu as well as the broccoli in some of the spiced oil. Added about 3 oz coconut milk at the end, but tasted it before I did so and it was pretty darned good without it. Left the lentils a little al dente to avoid mushy texture. Would definitely make it again.

Instead of cutting back on the water, I used about 1 1/2 cups lentils, and because I had some leftover in the fridge, used mostly beef broth with some water. (no longer vegan, but tastier!) I fried the tofu cubes separately in a little oil to brown it, transferred it to a paper towel-lined plate, then fried the spices in oil. I put those in with the lentils, then put the tofu back in the saute pan to pick up the leftover spices and dumped it in with the lentils. Really good recipe, and made sure to season along the way as others mentioned it was a bit bland. Would go well with a little greek yogurt. Worth a try, but changes are needed.

Did what everyone else did--doubled the spices, including the salt and cayenne, halved the water, sauteed the tofu in the spiced oil. Also added a small (160 ml) can of coconut milk and stirred in some steamed broccoli. Served over rice. It's a keeper.

This is a great quick and healthy meal in a bowl. It's great with cauliflower and carrots in it too. The recipe forgot to include salt so add about a tsp or so

Loved this recipe (as a base)! It was one of the best curries we've made. I followed the recipe, until I got to adding the tofu... at which point I cooked it in the pan with all of the spices before adding it to the lentil mixture. I also used the following measurements instead of the suggested ones: 2 garlic cloves, 1.5 teaspoons dried ginger, 2 cups water, 1/4 or 1/2 cup coconut milk, 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon garam masala, 1 teaspoon curry, 1 teaspoon salt. As suggested by others previously, the increased spices made this recipe divine (in addition to whatever the recipe listed). Enjoy!!

YUM!!! I doubled all spices and halved the water, per other reviewers and this came out really, really tasty.

I also doubled the spice and halved the water, did NOT fry the tofu and I thought it was delicious! Definitely one for the recipe box. Ate it with some oriental brown rice sesame crackers YUM!

I followed the directions of halving the water and doubling the spices and it has turned out wonderful for me. I've made this at least 4 times. It is one of my favorite ways to prepare tofu.

read the reviews before you make this one. they are spot on. i reduced the h2o to 2c, still too watery. also used dried ginger and ground cumin. no salt needed. was yummy.

Rating: 3
as others suggested, I fried the tofu in the spiced oil. Also cut the water down to 2 1/4 cups. At the end, the dish really needed more salt and spice. I stirred in some baby spinach leaves at the very end and a quick pour of coconut milk.

I listened to everyone's advice and sauteed the tofu with the spices, cut down on water, amped up the spice factor, among others. Thing is, it really is like baby food and i see why many folks say their babies love it! It was tasty but the texture was really weird. I know we can do better!

As long as you follow the reviewer's adaptations, this dish is really tasty. Definitely saute the tofu before you add it. Next time I will use coconut milk in place of some of the water, to add a little richness I think the dish could use. But very good overall, even without cumin seeds or cilantro.

I put the first spoonful in my mouth, my expectations were low based on the mixed reviews this recipe got...my eyes popped out of my head and I thought..Oh my God, this is GOOD. As far as tofu recipes goes this is 4-star in my opinion. Here's what I did a little different based on others suggestions...instead of cumin seeds I used 1/4 tsp ground cumin (I don't like eating cumin seeds in my food but I like the flavor), about 2 tsp of Garam Masala and a good shake of Cayenne. I sauteed these spices in oil and sauteed the tofu cubes (14 oz. of tofu to be exact) in the spiced oil before adding the lot to the waiting lentils. I probably used at least 1/4 cup fresh cilantro and I must say this was really good and I would make this again in a heartbeat.

Rating: 3
It is a must that you use red lentils in this recipe because they turn to mush unlike brown or green lentils. I cooked out all of the excess water and served this over rice. I used a little more spices than what was called for and opted for curry powder instead of garam masala. Next time I will fry my tofu first.

My 8 month old loves this and so do I. It's great 'lumpy' food for him with the bonus of being really healthy and quick to make. I just leave out the salt and keep a light hand with the cayenne, add some peas, greek yoghurt, and occasionally some mango. Delish!

i was looking for a recipe with a good source of iron and protein to feed my 16 month old. this was a good one b/c it wasn't too spicy, but still flavorful. i took the advice and cut down the water to 2 cups, but i ended up adding a bit more throughout the process to get the right consistency. i also stir-fried the tofu in the spices and oil. after i added everything, it still lacked flavor. i added some chicken bouillon ("better than bouillon" brand) and it was exactly what it needed. would do it again for my partner and me with more kick, but for my daughter, it was perfect.

Surprisingly comforting food ... suspect will make again and again since all ingredients regulars in pantry. Recommendations: do rinse lentils, add red peper for color, opt for convenience of ginger paste from intl grocery, use 2-2.5c water, double spices, use 2nd T oil to saute spices/tofu while lentils simmer. Makes 3cups, 1c=Weight Watchers 6 (w 12oz lite tofu), 40min to table.

I agree with other reviwers: use less water and more spices. I used 3 Cups and still had to drain more water in the end. Next tiem I will use 2 1/2 cups. I also added more curry and salt in the end.

Rating: 2
I sauteed the tofu cubes in the spiced oil before adding to the lentils. I also put the same amount of spices in with the lentils- and don't forget the salt!! Also used about 2c. water and added a bit more when it started to cook down to much. So, with less water and twice the spices, it was pretty good. :)

Rating: 2
The dish was too watery. The lentils do not need 3 1/2 cups of water to cook fully. I added more onion, some chopped jalenpeno to spice it up a bit. It tasted better the next day so I will make it next time but elimating some of the water.

Rating: 1
Quite simply, this recipe is just plain bad. I agree with the other reviews which state there is too much water AND not enough flavor. Boring...even after having drained some water and added more spice. Frying the tofu is a good suggestion, as is adding in some vegetables like peas, but an even better suggestion is not to bother at all. Buh.

Rating: 3
This is a good, healthy weeknight meal. I sauteed the tofu in the spice oil. That gives the tofu some added flavor. I also used a bit more spices than recommended, because I like spicy! Also added some cooked brown rice to soak up the extra liqiud, because it is a little watery.

Rating: 3
By following the suggestions in the reviews(and of course responding and tweaking things yourself as you cook)this can be a very tasty and healthful recipe. Definitely sautee the tofu first - I did just with oil, salt, and garlic - until browned (you'll have a hard time not munching on these while you're waiting for the lentils!) Reduce the water (adding more if needed). And definitely use loads of spices - I quadrupled the curry madras - I've never seen a curry recipe with only 1 TB! End product is rich and not watery at all. Even healthier with brown rice and flavourful enough to win over the London curry fans!

Rating: 2
No no no. I used way less water and doubled the spices and it still turned out poorly. I threw it out and tried again with more onions and added some black pepper (1/2 tsp.) and about a 1/4 cup of unsweetened coconut. That worked somewhat better.

Great texture, a lot like dhal paneer. For the texture of paneer (homemade cheese) be sure to use firm tofu, not soft or extra firm. Unfortunately, it was watery and short on flavor, even though I used only 3 cups of water and multiplied quantities of all the spices and garlic by 1.5. I'd suggest using only 2.5 cups water, and doubling all the spices, cilantro and garlic. It also wouldn't hurt to use more onion, too. I substituted peanut oil for half the vegetable oil. Next time, I'll use only peanut oil. And still, something was missing. I'll keep experimenting with this one. Maybe I'll throw in some mango chutney or something like that.

Very tastey! Healthy & easy too. The lentils took long enough to cook that I didn't have the "watery problem" others have mentioned. Hubby gave it two thumbs up too.

A great (and fast and easy!) curry dish that I will be making frequently. I doubled the onions, garlic, ginger, and spices (except salt..) and only used 2.5 c water and it worked out really well for me. I might even use 2.25 c. water, because I like my curries really thick (instead of more saucy/soupy), but that's just me.

Rating: 1
I should have read the review before cooking this one! I did it as is and it was way watery and lacking any kind of real depth of flavor. I definitly would cook the lentils in stock as was suggested and double up the spices...i would prefer more of a curry flavor as opposed to the garam masala.

Rating: 3
An excellent, easy and TASTY tofu recipe! Used less H2O, and sauteed tofu/spices separately. Brown lentils good, will try red next time. Also, extra-firm tofu probably best.

Rating: 3
Definitely follow the other recommendations to double the spices, cut the water down to 2.5 cups, and use broth instead of water. Also, you might want to go easier on the cayene if you're cooking for any delicate northern palates (like my wife's). But I suppose that's kind of a given.

After reading many of the other reviews on this site, I tried this recipe with a few additions. I bumped up the measurements of nearly every ingredient - more onions, nearly doubled the spices, but decreased the amount of water slightly (from 3 1/4 to maybe 2 1/2 cups). I also added a veggie boullion cube to the lentils. Once this was done and fried tofu was added, it was really, really good. I'll definitely make this again!

I felt this dish was quite delicious. The lentils,ginger, garlic, onions, cumin, garam masala... straight ahead Moroccan, hearty and satisfying

Definitely cook the lentils in broth if you want them to have any flavor. Like the other reviewers say, fry the tofu. I cooked 1 tsp of yellow curry powder (in addition to the garam masala) in 2 tbsp of oil. and then stir-fried the tofu until it was golden yellow. The finished product looks a little plain, so it might be nice to add some peas or maybe a little sauteed red pepper. Use heaping spoonfuls of all spices and you'll get a great flavor that is not too hot. My roommate loved it and said I should make it again.

I am so glad we get to read reviews beofre trying these recipes. I made this with extra onions, ginger and spices. I also added a couple veggie boullion cubes with the lentils. It was delicious! Easy, too. I added extra lentils, and I'm glad I did, because the broth is pretty watery.

Rating: 3
Very easy and very good! But you do have to go heavier on the seasonings...definately needs more garlic, ginger and curry. It also helped to stirfry the tofu prior to adding it to the dish. Perhaps for a thicker, less dal-like dish, you could go easy on the water/broth.

This was a horrible recipe! I'm trying to learn tofu recipes and this was much too watery. I love curry but this won't stay in my recipe box.

Extremely watery and not much flavor. Bland. Boring... What else can I say -- I'm surprised they don't remove this lame recipe from the database. I can't believe anyone would like this. The only this I would recommend to improve this is don't make it and find another recipe. This has to be the worst recipe I've ever made and it takes quite a while too. It smells good making it, but that's about it.

Rating: 3
This is a good dish, but needs some tweaking. It's much better if you use stock -- chicken stock or vegetable stock -- instead of water; it's better if the tofu is stirfried instead of poached; and there's a good deal you can do with the seasonings (the sort of garam masala or curry powder, or curry paste, you use makes a lot of difference; if you don't have good home made garam masala, a good hot yellow curry powder or a red curry paste (best of all to me) helps.

This was terrible. Bland taste and awful texture. Like the cook from Melbourne, I threw the whole thing out after a couple bites. A waste of time.

Rating: 1
This recipe had no redeeming features. I actually had two mouthfuls and threw mine in the rubbish bin. The whole recipe would need to be reworked to get more flavour into it. The tofu needed to be marinated or fried to give it a lift. My thoughts were why waste time on a recipe like this when there are so many good ones around.

Rating: 3
very easy to make, the tofu is better if sauteed first.

Rating: 2
This recipe can be enhanced by increasing the amount of spices, otherwise it's too dull. Also, feel free to skip the tofu--I find that the best tofu recipes are those that either marinate the tofu or fry the tofu to give it a more interesting texture. The tofu in this recipe is just too bland.

Rating: 2
Was good but needs extra work. I really browned the onions, then added the garlic & ginger. I added more spices to the hot oil mixture and reduced the total amount of olive oil. Let it cook a bit longer and then added some of my own garum masala at the end with the coriander. Served with basmati rice. My husband thought it was delicious and it is a fairly health dish. Will make again.
