The concept was intriguing, but it was impossible to tell when the fish was done wrapped in all that paper. I removed the bundle from the grill at the designated time, but had to finish the undercooked fish in the oven. However, the marinade was delicious. Next time, I will cook the fish in a basket directly on the grill and prepare additional marinade to serve as a condiment at the table.

We made this last night with black cod as bass was unavailable. Since there was just two of us, we didn't make the whole fish, just a fillet. Wrapped it in 6 bags, no butcher paper and smoked it for 20 minutes. It came out delicious. The fish was moist and smokey, had a really rich flavor. Can't wait to try this again!
