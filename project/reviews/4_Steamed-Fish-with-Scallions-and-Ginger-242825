A simple, elegant recipe - adapts well. I am the only one in my family who eats fish, so instead of cranking up the oven I steamed one salmon fillet on the in a covered, non-stick pan over low heat on the stove top. I cut the sauce down to 4 T soy, 1 t oil, and used a dash of brown sugar. I added some sliced jalapeno and extra ginger. It stood up to the oily salmon quite well.

This works great with smaller portions too. I tried it with perch fillets; more work with the foil tents, but it was excellent. I added the juice of half a lime into the sauce, and was much happier with the flavor.

I made this with yellowtail snappers (about 1.6 lbs total). I am on a very restricted diet and not using oil I omitted it, and added a few tablespoons of fresh lemon juice for volume and to cut the soy a bit. It was delicious and I didn't miss the oil at all.

Did this with tilapia and snapper; preferred the latter. Grated the ginger rather than julienne, skipped the sugar, increased sesame oil to 1 tbsp, added a couple squeezes of sriracha and a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds at the last minute. Amazing and easy. Will make again soon.

Wow! This dish will forever be in my culinary repetoire! I used fresh whole red snapper and mixed the sauce as directed, with the exception of adding a teaspoon of sambal for some heat. The sauce was delicious on the brown rice I paired with the fish. I can see a few variations on this dish in the very near future! Simply fantastic!

A big hit-made the sauce as directed but added 1 t sriracha sauce for some heat. Also added mung bean noodles, sliced garlic and some veggies to the seabass, and it was great--the fish had a subtle flavor, and the noodles soaked up the yummy sauce.

I didn't change the core of this recipe, but added to it with amazing results. I added one large clove of thinly sliced garlic to the sauce as well as a heaping tbl of finely chopped jalapeno for a little spice. I used about 1/8 cup less soy sauce then called for but added the following veggies (julienned) and put them under and on top of the fish in the packet (which added moisture to replace the soy): fennel, red peppers, yellow peppers, carrots, red onion and yellow summer squash (I wish I had had snow peas). Lastly I sprinkled thinly sliced fresh basil over the whole thing before sealing (about 2 tbl).The veggies were amazing with the fish. Served with white rice. Everyone loved it!

When I lived in Thailand, my cousin used to make this sometimes, steaming it right in the serving dish over a wok full of boiling water. (It's a Chinese dish, but we do eat Chinese food in Thailand too. ^_^) Anyway, I've tried this a few times with varying degrees of success. Usually my fish is too big or my steamer too small. Pouring on the sauce, wrapping in foil, and baking worked just as well. I couldn't discern any difference from the steamed version. For good measure, I did put a dish of water in next to the fish, to keep the oven humid. I used a bit more ginger and sugar, and coconut oil instead of peanut oil (reducing the quantity a bit, since it's a saturated fat). For the commenter who did this with trout -- I actually do like trout, but I would never cook it this way. I'm not even sure I'd do salmon like this. This is a technique that is most appropriate (I think) for a flaky, white ocean fish with a very mild flavor. Sea bass is perfect, and I think my favorite for this. But you could probably go with red snapper, grouper or tilapia with reasonable success. The flavoring is subtle, so a fishy fish will not work at all.

Did a half salmon for a teacher appreciation luncheon. Wonderful presentation. Since it was served cold, did a cucumber lemon dill yogurt sauce instead of the soy. Every well received.

I had been looking for a good steamed fish recipe for some time, and this recipe fit the bill. I used sea bass, which has an excellent consistency for this recipe. Instead of julienned ginger, the second time I sliced the ginger very thin which worked just fine. Paired with some chilled white chenin blanc was fantastic!

sooooo easy, and if you have a Trader Joe's nearby, try using just their Soyaki mardinade the scallions and fresh ginger with about 3/4 cup water in a covered fry pan. even easier....

This is delicious exactly as written. We used frozen (and thawed) salmon fillets and added some shrimp to the packet. It was truly a lovely combination of flavors.

I used frozen salmon filets from Whole Foods, made separate foil packets and baked then on a cookie sheet for 17 mninutes at 425 following advice of another reviewer. It was very good but the salmon was a bit overcooked. Next time, I'd leave it in the 425 oven for 12 minutes. The sauce is very soy-y, but damm tasty. This has to be an awesome recipe with a whole fish.

Really simple, quick, and healthy. I made a half recipe of sauce with a couple of salmon fillets, and it was great!

As others did, I used salmon fillets from Trader Joe's instead of whole fish; I put the fillets on a bed of sliced green onions, used ginger from a jar (Christopher Ranch) in place of fresh ginger. It took me about 1 minute to put the sauce together. The fillets took about 20 minutes in my oven to cook. I served them with steamed rice and stir fried cabbage/bok choy/snow pea, celery mix, also from Trader's. Great, simple fairly health-conscious meal which took little time to prepare, and very little time for my family to devour (even the finicky 13 year old ate every bit of the salmon!) I will definitely make this again; and would serve the salmon for guests, perhaps with more elegant veggies.

The only whole fish they had at the store was trout, which is probably why I'm giving this only 2 forks. The sauce was great and the fish was tender, just didn't really like the flavor of the fish itself, guess I'm not a trout fan.

This is a simple, exceptional dish that focuses on fresh ingredients and brings out the best in them! My family really loved it, especially my dad who loves seafood. I used grouper and a Chinese soy sauce for seafood. I chose to steam it for 20 minutes instead of baking it . I added drops of sesame oil before serving to make it more fragrant and garnished with coriander leaves. BTW, reserve the coriander stems for stuffing in the fish cavity during steaming for extra flavor.

I made this with 1 1/2" to 2" thick salmon filets. Did not pre-salt the fish.Cooked for 17 min in a 425 degree oven. Perfectly cooked Deliciousness!! Served with rice and stir fryed bok choy. Fast and easy. This is a winner for sure.

Okay so I didn't follow this recipe exactly BUT I thought it was AMAZING! Really simple, which I love! I grated the ginger instead of julienned it and I did not use a whole fish, I had it on 2 fillets. Absolutely wonderful. Enjoy!

Delicious and very simple. I am intimidated by whole fish, not to mention the cost, so I purchased filets from Trader Joe's. I adjusted the cooking time a bit. With the aluminum foil, there were hardly any dishes!

Really tasty and so easy. I used a half pound + fillet of wild salmon with skin and 1/4 of sauce. Worked fine. Next time I won't salt the fish though as it is was bit much.

Absolutely delicious. So moist and SO easy! I can't help but think it would be just as good with fish fillets. I am intimidated by whole fish and have a difficult time filleting whole cooked fish. Either way, worth making. I served it with the Vietnamese Fried Rice. Perfect dinner!
