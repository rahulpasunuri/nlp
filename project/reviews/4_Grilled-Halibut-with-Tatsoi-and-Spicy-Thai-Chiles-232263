Look at the recipe, not a drop of oil! I consider this fresh Asian spa cuisine at its best. Used spinach for the greens, and sometimes I even serve it fresh like a salad. The sauce is so good, and the fish sauce is the key in my mind. Don't skimp on it! This is great for a hot day, and if your grilling skills are good enough to cook the fish there, it's a nice touch.

I loved this sauce. Instead of grilling I sauteed the fillets after coating them in panko. Delicious. This is going to be one of my go to mid-week recipes!

Amazing! The sweet and spicy mixture were a perfect pairing with the fish. Great summer dinner!

So easy, it's rediculous! We used Sea Bass, and added 4 to 6 oz. of coconut milk to the sauce for a bit more Thai flavor. Placed the fish under the broiler vs. grill, for 3 min. per side. Worked out great. Used Thai noodles as a base, added the spinach, then fish. Drizzle, drizzle. It was a total hit and only took about 20 min. to prepare. You can't go wrong with this.

I have made this a few times and every time I do my guests suggest I open a restaurant. Serve over the baby spinach and shallots over quineoa, garnished with carrots pickled in rice vinegar. Next time, for a change, I am going to try scallops.

This sauce has just an amazing flavor. The second time I made it with red snapper because I think halibut is a little too mushy for me, but the basics are great.

Super easy to cook and delicious. I used spinach instead the tatsoi and the result was really good, I also drizzle the spinach with the sauce. I will make it again for sure.

This recipe turned out *amazing*! I made only a few tiny changes ~ I substituted Splenda for the sugar (2 1/2 packets = 5 tablespoons of sugar), I used spinach instead of Tatsoi, and I broiled the halibut for 4 minutes a side instead of grilling. I plan to make this again and again. Everyone loved it and it was really easy to make! Nice visual too.

The sauce is so good!!! I made this on a really hot day, so instead of sauteing the greens, I tossed them with some of the sauce as a dressing and the carrots, and served it as a salad with the fish, asprinkling the crispy shallots on top. My guests went crazy for it!

Used slightly less fish sauce because I ran out, warmed the fish sauce in the microwave before adding to the sauce. Wowed my guests - said it was their favorite of any meal I have made them .Served it over mixed organic quinoa (red, black & white)steamed in a rice cooker w/ 1 teas olive oil, lemon zest, Salt & pepper. Served with Thai pumpkin soup & Cambodian slaw salad

We will definitely be making this again for more people aside from ourselves! We used rock cod atop kale with a side of quinoa, next time I would layer with the quinoa on bottom. The sauce is delicious!

I prepared this pretty much by the book. It was a huge hit. I used leftover sauce with grilled chicken and rice instead of halibut and spinach, also successful. My daughter who is just beginning to bud as a cook begged for the recipe.

I had picked up some halibut at the store and had Hon tsai tai and spinach from my CSA - how lucky was I to find this fabulous dish! I didn't have the chili's or ginger on hand, so I used chili garlic paste and ground ginger. It was awesome,and a big hit with the family. The sauce is so good, I think it would work with a lot of other things - including a dipping sauce for spring rolls.

This is a really good recipe. We could not find fresh or local halibut so we used rock cod and sauteed it and it was quite good. I think halibut would have even better texture. The sauce is excellent - the only change we made was to use agave nectar instead of sugar - perfect! We will make this again.

I had tatsoi greens and was looking for a reccipe. I came upon this. I had all the ingredients but the halibut and the chiles. Instead I used catfish and hot red pepper flakes. The sauce is outstanding. It tastes very vietnamese to me. Perfect flavor balance. I loved it. I will be making this a lot. My husband and the kids (8 and 10) liked it as much as I did.

We got tatsoi in the box from our CSA (Community Supported Agriculture). I didn't have time to run to the store for fish, so I just made the sauce with the greens. The flavor is delicous and easy. Making again this week with baby bok choy from the CSA and gulf shrimp.

My husband and I have been eating this recipe about once a week since discovering it. It is easy, delicious, and has a really stylish, colorful presentation - have served it to guests very successfully. We like it best with salmon, but halibut is delicious too. We substitute fresh spinach for tatsoi, and have a thai salad with lime/fish sauce dressing alongside.

So simple, yet so tasty! I always have fish sauce on hand and, like a previous cook, had always heated it to dissipate fishy stink. I heated this sauce, reduced it and we loved it last night. so much so, I'm making it again tonight.

I didn't have Thai chilies available so I used the jalapeno. I wanted to find a recipe using tatsoi which we received from our CSA farm. We broiled the halibut and I used a bit of the sauce to baste it with. This is quite delicious even though I forgot the carrot which is probably only for color anyway. I definitely think its worth a try using either tatsoi or baby spinach or a combination.

Rating: 1
I guess I am in the minority here, because I thought this recipe was horrible. The fish sauce was overwhelming; I prefer fish sauce in a cooked sauce, but this is basically dumped on top of the halibut with a little sugar to sweeten it up. It's a pretty presentation, but just not a very tasty recipe. Try tilapia with chile lime butter instead.

Substituted spinach, used jalapeno for heat from chilis, parsley for garnish instead of carrot, wild rice on the side...overall it was a raging success. It will become a favorite. Much easier than I thought it would be.

This is an excellent and easy fish recipe. Great flavors! I have already made this three times since it was published four months ago. So easy and impressive enough to serve to guests. The chiles can be omited and it's good for kids.

I substituted mahi mahi for the unavailable halibut; nice choice, but any mild white fish would be good. Very tasty sauce, but next time I'll use a little less sugar. The spinach (no tatsoi) was bought at the health food store, roots, stems and all, and not cleaned. The size was between baby and adult-sized spinach leaves. I simply wanted to again taste what spinach is really like. I spend about 20 minutes removing tough stems, but it required only two washings. The extra effort was worth it; much better than thrice-washed spinach from plastic bags. Which is not to say I won't use the latter in the future, just not as often. I broiled the fish. For the spinach saute, I used twice as much shallot and the same with oil. Altogether a lovely dish, and not incidentally, low calorie as well. Definitely worth a frequent repeat.

Usually * indicates it might be an item difficult to find or something not commonly used. They will usually give a brief description,where to get it or what to sub for. You can find fish sauce in the asian section of any grocery store. Can't wait to try this,fresh tatsoi is at farmer's markets now

I made this recipe over the weekend for the first time and it was a hit. I broiled the fish (I used tilapia), and added alfalfa sprouts on top for a nice presentation. Everybody liked it on top of jasmine rice.

I used a small amount of the sauce to marinate the halibut for 30 minutes before grilling. I served the halibut over the bed of greens and the greens over a bed of thin rice noodles which I seasoned lightly with a dressing of oyster sauce, soy sauce, sherry, garlic and brown sugar.

This made for the best fish I've had in a long time! I cut the sauce in half & it was enough for 4 servings. The only changes I made was spraying my piece of halibut w/nonfat cooking spray instead of using oil & I cooked it under the broiler for 4 mins per side instead of grilling. Used jalapenos instead of thai chiles. Perfect! I agree with the cook from Calgary- be careful not to overdo the sauce or it can be overpowering. The spinach recipe ended up being the best spinach I've ever made. I served with brown rice enhanced with broth, lemon juice/zest. I used the rest of the sauce the next night over broiled salmon and it was just as good. My boyfriend said the sauce was good over his steak as well! Highly recommended.

I actually made the recipe, and it was fabulous. I shredded the carrot, used baby spinach because I had it and served the whole dish over brown rice. The only mistake my husband and I made was adding a bit too much additional sauce at the table - it pooled in the rice and made for a pungent finish. Overall, this dish was easy, delicious, healthful, and presented beautifully. I'm going to make it for guests the next chance I get.

The carrot, as the recipe says, is peeled and cut into matchstick-sized strips. The asterisk beside the fish sauce probably indicates that it can be found at Asian supermarkets or the international section of some grocery stores.

This recipe looks tempting but the fish sauce listed in ingredients with an asterik beside it is never mentioned again and there is no msntion if the carrot is shredded and if used raw or cooked
