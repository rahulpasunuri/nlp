Really bland - sorry, but this was a big disappointment, and not how I want to start a special dinner party. Pretty, and nice that it was lighter (not having the cream), but the flavours were indistinct, and all in all just not worth the effort or expense.

I'm allergic to salmon so substituted shrimp meat. It was delicious and my guests loved it!
