Growing up, my grandmother from Italy made this dish all the time. My mother got the recipe and I grew up having it all my life. It's a wonderful memory of my grandmother & my childhood. I'd recommend this to anyone - it's THAT good!

I made this as written but added a generous sprinkling of parmesan as I was tossing it at the end. Simple, quick, and delicious.

Wonderful basic recipe, and so glad to see the steaming time. I used garlic-scented olive oil, fresh thyme, and the zest from the lemons I squeezed for the juice. This would be nice tossed with pasta, maybe add some cooked chicken or shrimp, you could also add in some hot pepper or sauteed mushrooms too. Definitely a 'make again'.

When I was a child I absolutely hated broccoli and I now know why because she would boil the broccoli and to top it all off she boiled it way too long. I came across a book called "Perfect Vegetables" through Cooks Illustrated, and it states that when you cook broccoli longer than 5 mins it starts to break down chemically. Now I know why my mothers broccoli was so bland, mushy, and an unpresentable brownish green color. But other than her broccoli she is a wonderfuld cook! So I highly recommend setting a timer for your broccoli but most importantly get a steam basket its well worth the investment because it will cook your broccoli evenly. I didn't become a broccoli fan until I was 22 years old but Im so glad I gave it a chance.

Quick and tasty. Definitely double the garlic.

Great! Even my extremely picky inlaws who hate veggies ate this. My garlic also turned blue, but it wasn't noticeable on the broccoli. Definitely a keeper!

I've never found a more fail-safe way to cook broccoli -- it turns out perfectly every time.

I love this recipe, but I do it a little different. After steaming I add butter or margine, season salt, and put lemon wedges on the table to add after cooking.

Ehh. Salvaged with parmesan cheese. Lemon did not work.

I absolutely love this dish. We only get fresh broccoli in the winter here and I wait all summer, craving it.

I had prepared this dish for my family a few times, to the extend that my parent learn to prepare the dish themselves. Its so simple to prepare and its a healhty dish for today's diet concept.

This is a nice, simple sidedish that takes just a bit of extra effort. It goes well with Italian flavors.

This is a fast, healthy and delicious side dish. It smelled REALLY garlicky when it was cooking but the flavor was fairly mellow - a pleasant suprise. A definite addition to our cookbook!

Eager to see what blue garlic looks like, I tried this. No luck! I can never get my garlic to turn blue. What am I doing wrong? Nevertheless, it was good with the broccoli. Yes, I'll make it again.

This was okay. My garlic also turned blue - my mom suggested sauteeing the garlic in the oil but only add lemon to the broccoli immediately before serving. (The lemon is acidic and causes the change in color - mind you it wasn't noticeable once added to the broccoli) I think you get a very similar flavor with adding a little butter and lemon juice to steamed broccoli. However, I'm a very occasional cook and the fewer steps before putting a dish on the table the better.

I have to agree that san fran was just a little off in the comment department. i made this for a dinner where my guests were on the atkins diet and it was a smash! Not only did it meet their approval; but i also added cauliflower and some red peppers to mix it up. I will definently be making this recipe again!

Quick, simple & tasty - a keeper - as one of the other reviewers said, if my toddlers (3&1) eat it, it's great!

While a simple dish, cooking the oil & garlic WITH the lemon juice is a new approach to adding lemon flavor for me. I use mostly zest while cooking and juice at the end or at the table so the change was nice. Noting the overwhelming number of recipe reviews, I think San Francisco's comment could be deleted and no one would miss it.

This recipe has been endorsed by my two picky eaters: My 2 year old and a 4 year old sons. If they like it, it's got to be good!

Just wanted to comment on San Francisco Cook's comment. I am a new cook and am always looking for new ways to put excitement into my cooking. Not everyone knows how to cook; this site is excellent for a new-comer such as myself.I agree with New York cook regarding comment from San Francisco cook. Thank god for sites such as this.

This is a pretty good recipe, simple yet tasty...I have to remark on the Cook from San Francisco two down from here. Not everyone knows everything about cooking, my dear west coast gourmet. The site also includes recipe for frying eggs and making hamburgers...some people don't have the benefit of knowing it all. I can assure you that I have eaten at your house or people like you in the past. They think they are great cooks, but they miss the point, rendering their dish unpalatable. Regards.

Very easy and a nice change from plain steamed broccoli. I made it for someone who only ate broccoli if it was covered in cheese and even he thought it was delicious!

Well DUH, did you really need a recipe for this???I was looking for something different and saw this...to me...same old...same old...but it is a good way to make broccoli...

Just when you can't stand plain steamed broccoli again this is the answer. I admit, I did improvise a little by adding halved (lengthwise) grape tomatoes to the olive oil, garlic and lemon mixture and sauteed them up before adding the broccoli. Definitely season generously with S&P and being a lemon lover I did squeeze in a bit more lemon juice. Enjoy!

Easy and nice side dish. What could be better to go with fish, meats, stews. Takes all of ten minutes and will impress the guests, or for that matter, people you don't even care about impressing.

I love broccoli, and this dish was so simple and easy. Perfect for weekday side or a more formal arrair. Served with salisbury steak and the mashed potatoes with sundried tomatoes found in Epicurious, which by the way, are amazing. Simple refreshing dish.

A wonderful simple and quick broccoli recipe. The rest of the recipes I had chosen for dinner were very complex and it was a pleasure to have a light and simple side dish to complement the meal.

Can't believe such a simple little dish could be so delicious!!! Was it just me or did anyone else's garlic have some sort of chemical reaction and turn blue when the lemon juice was added? No matter - this was yummy. Would be good with a little bit of red pepper flakes too.

I gave this 3 forks because it has greater potential. I didn't think the flavors came through but the recipe is so simple and a nice change from plain broccoli. Next time I will add a LOT more garlic and double the oil and lemon juice.

It's always a challenge to get my group to eat vegetables other than salad and I tried this on a whim, thinking, "Cooked broccoli. Yuck." It was a huge surprise. Everybody, including me, loves it. It's fresh and light and flavorful and really, really easy!

I've prepared this preparation for some time, but I prefer using lemon zest instead of juice. You still get the flavor, but with the added color, which I think makes it a more special dish.

The sauce was most tasty and greatly enhanced the flavor of the broccoli. I would most definitely make it again!!!

The recipe is very simple and quick, and tastes okay, not fantastic. It just didn't appeal to me as much as some of the other broccoli recipes we usually do, so I doubt we'll make it again.
