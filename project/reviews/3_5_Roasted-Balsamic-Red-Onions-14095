So good and simple! I am a vinegar fan, so I incresed the amount a tad. Served with pan seared rib eye and steamed asparagus. Delicious!

SSSSOOOO easy! An awesome side dish, looks nice on the platter surrounding a roast. I got a little vinegar happy and added way too much. Next time I'll stick to the recipe!

I adore onions, and these were fabulous! Don't change anything! Easy, delicious. I served with thyme-roasted potatoes with balsamic vinegar and roast pork loin with garlic and rosemary, also from this site.

Made this and served it over a plain, baked whitefish. Added a great flavour to an otherwise bland type of fish. What was left of the onion we ate all by itself! We love red onions and balsamic vinegar, so we used a lot more balsamic on these like the other reviewers did. We will be making this quite often.

I was looking for something easy as an accompaniment to a roasted tenderloin, just as an added side dish. Was very pleasantly surprised at the delicious result from this easily perpared dish. I too added a bit more balsamic vinegar than the recipe called for with good results.

I made this with Christmas dinner and enjoyed it. I would use more balsamic vinegar, but I really like balsamic vinegar so I always use more than what's called for :) Its a great accompaniment for a roasted beef, which is what I used it for.
