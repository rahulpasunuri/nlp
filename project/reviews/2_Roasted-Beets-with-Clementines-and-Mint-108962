I was really looking forward to this (later today for Christmas Eve), but when I made it last night I nearly gagged at how bitter the clementines turned. The beets are slightly bitter, too, so I threw away the clementines and will figure out something to do with the beets so as not to throw away everything.

Just OK

I agree with several who said that the clementines (I used minneolas, as clementines were out of season)were mushy and lacked visual appeal. So I removed the minneolas, put them in a skillet with app. 1/2 cup dry, white wine and cooked them down for 8-10 minutes, then put them in a fine mesh sieve and used a spatula to push the juice into a bowl. I then mixed that back into the beets. Very good.

I made this as part of a big birthday buffet and was disappointed. The whole thing tasted kind of "blah" and we had loads of leftovers. No one at home was crazy about it either so I ended up throwing it out. It simply lacks a good flavour and though I'm a beet lover I didn't love this recipe.

This is our favorite beet recipe. The melange of flavors comes together quite nicely. You wouldn't think that beets would go together well with clementines, but go figure.

This was wonderful dish and so easy to put together.

This was ok--the mint was good with the beets, but next time I'd leave the clementines out. The just got all mushy and did not taste good or add a great flavor to the beets.
