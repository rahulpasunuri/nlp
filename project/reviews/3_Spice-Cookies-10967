Something must've been written wrong in the recipe because it was crumbly as all the other reviews noted... I then noticed there was no binder of any kind in the recipe. I added one egg and it then worked like a charm. So for those who had troulbe before, try adding one egg.

Why oh why didn't I listen to all of the bad reviews? Well, I thought, there were a couple of good reviews, It;ll be fine. HA. Crumble is right. I did manage to salvage it. I added about 2 - 4 Tablespoons hot water until it looked like a dough and put it back in the refigerator for 2 hours. They came out fine. No special taste. Keep searching.

Okay, here's my story. Decided to make these cookies without reading the reviews (which is unusual for me). Once I put the "dough" (a misnomer) together I thought something had to be wrong. It was a crumble, not a dough. That's when I looked at the reviews and found it's a difficult dough to work with. Boy, is that an understatement. As far as I'm concerned, it's nearly impossible. It takes far too much work to get the dough to come together. For what it's worth, the dough is delicious, just impossible to work with. I'd rather apply the spices to another cookie recipe rather than suffer the frustration of trying to make this again.

Like the other reviewers said- this is extremely difficult "dough" to work with- more like crumble. It also yielded less than half of the amount of cookies I was expecting. All in all- not worth the effort. The few cookies that did turn out had a pretty good flavor. Just needs a better consistency.

The perfect afternoon cookie to accompany coffee or tea. Not to sweet and full of flavor. It's my new fave.

I made these for christmas, and they were excellent. I hear what the other cooks say about the crumbly dough, but it just needs a firm hand. I handed the task over to my partner, and he made short work of it. I left the icing off because i wanted an intense spice flavour without the excess sweetness. The cardamom adds an extra special flavour. I discovered that cookies made by just slicing thin circles off a roll of chilled dough were as good as the ones we rolled out, so that's what i'll do in future if i'm feeling lazy.

Though the dough is VERY difficult to work with, we enjoy the taste and crisp texture. The contrast of the sweet lemony icing on the spicy cookie is great. But, this is not the recipe to reach for if you are in a time crunch, or if you frustrate easily.

I tried these cookies for the holidays. They are crispy in texture, but there isn't enough spice or flavour. I also found these very dry. I would give 'em a miss. Sally in Toronto

Warning-you may be caught by surprise when you make this dough. I too thought I had made a mistake because it was crumbly. However, when you compress it in your hand, it does stick. It's a bit hard to roll (I used wax paper), but it's well worth the effort. Everyone loved these cookies--they were a huge hit!

I'm not sure what I did wrong--the cookie dough was far too dry, more like the texture of crumbs and would not come together. Am I right in seeing that there are only 2 Tbsp. of liquid in this recipe (not including the lemon juice in frosting)? It smelled great, but there's no way I would've been able to roll it out and cut cookies. Very disappointing, since it sounded so good. :(

I made this recipe for Christmas a couple of years ago. You can't eat just one. They are definitely on my "to-do" list this year.

This recipe saved me when I had surprise dinner guests! I kept the dough in the freezer between rollings. Everyone loved the spicy, sharp cookies with sweet icing.
