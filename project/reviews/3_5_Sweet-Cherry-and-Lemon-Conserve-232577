Tasted delicious, but I will use it to pour over ice cream as it is very liquid. I cooked it for about 3 or 4 times as long as recommended and it still didn't set.

I am in the midst of prepping my canning jars to make this for the second time. Its a nice way to use the cherries while they are in abundance and especially nice to have them around when they are not. This conserve is delicious on just about anything. I used it this spring on some lovely duck breasts.
