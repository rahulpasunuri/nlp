This was delicious - made it for Thanksgiving and it disappeared. Very easy pesto - added some garlic as well.

So delicious & easy! Next time I might try using lime juice, but did it per the recipe and it was very, very good.

i didn't have cilantro and so did the pesto with parsley instead and holy cow, it was amazing. also used the juice of a lime instead of a lemon. fortunately there's some leftover and i look forward to eating it on fish. i did the squash as halves and cut it into pieces after cooking--peeling squash is such a timesuck. it worked fine. i cooked it at 350 for 35 minutes facedown in an olive oiled dish and it was perfect.

So yummie! I made this recipe as is and it was easy and delicious. A nice alternative for squash. Will keep this as a staple!

I was so disappointed after all of these great reviews! I followed the recipe except for the addition of garlic as suggested below. I really didn't love the combination of flavors and it was too salty. It was very one-note and a bit intense for me. I think I would make the pesto again to use as a dip for sesame crackers or bread sticks. It might work better over some pasta or pork.

I'm just feeling the need to again effuse about how spectacular this dish is. I did freeze the pesto in little batches, and it turns out that they can be defrosted incredibly quickly. I've been eating this pesto on almost everything--more squash, crackers, etc. It's wonderful on Kashi crackers with red wine. I'll be eating this pesto with fish, grilled pork, more crackers, more squash...You seriously need to make this.

Like a lot of other reviewers, I was skeptical about this dish, but I ended up being blown away. What a great way to use up some of the pumpkin seeds I found in the pantry! I also added garlic to the pesto, and I tossed the squash with cumin before roasting it (which is delicious even without this pesto). The pesto was even delicious with the roast chicken that we were also eating, and I imagine that it would be great with grilled pork. I plan to freeze the leftovers in little batches so that I can defrost a little bit whenever I want.

I have made this several times for my family and they love it! I serve it as a vegetarian main dish by mixing the pesto into some whole wheat spaghetti with a little of the pasta water, then top with the roasted squash and some leftover pumpkin seeds.

outstanding with the addition of cumin as noted by another reviewer.

This dish is so delicious that I make it often and just leave it in the fridge so that I have something healthy to munch on. It is just as good when I cut the oil back by half.

I've made this twice and loved it both times. My pesto has come out different both times due to thinking I had ingredients that I didn't.

This works well as a vegan main dish. I substituted spaghetti squash for butternut. The flavors are perfect.

Was a bit hesitant to try this recipe but was very glad i took the risk. The fourth fork is for my unexpected surprise at how well these flavors went together. I added 1 clove of garlic, and a bit of cumin and ground coriander to the pesto and it was delicious! I also used half the seeds and sprinkled them on top as the recipe states...using all the seeds in the pesto would be way too much. If you're on the fence - try it!

This is a great and easy recipe! I've made it three times now, to great reviews. I also added a little white truffle oil to the pesto and that worked out well too.

This was so delicious! The perfect balance of flavors. I will definitely make this again. I couldn't find pumpkin seeds at the grocery store, so I substituted sunflower seeds which worked just fine.

I never know what to do with butternut squash so I thought I'd try this. The pumpkin seed pesto was great, but somehow the flavor didn't mesh with the squash very well. Family thought it was okay, but I found it disappointing.

Just delicious! So easy when using the prepeeled and cut up squash. I used two 16 oz. packages.

Delicious! I only needed to roast the squash for 12 to 15 minutes.

What a wonderful dish! This is one of my all- time favorites, and it's easy to prepare. My only disappointment is that it didn't make as much as I expected, but next time I'll look for bigger squash. Tasty!

Simple on preparation, big on flavor. My finicky family has already requested this for Thanksgiving. Use 2 pans to roast--I overcrowded the squash and didn't get as good browning. Only criticism: not very good as leftovers.

This was yummy! I was looking for a dish to compliment a vegetarian menu and came across this. Not usually daring and took the leap to try it. I am so glad I did. Really love the cilantro and pumpkin flavors. The roasted squash was light and delicious under the sweet and nutty taste of the pesto. Definitely recommend and will make again!
