Have saved this recipe for a long time and finally tried it. Made some changes however. "Roasted" the poblano peppers along with some red peppers by charring them over my gas burner, then cored (almost all the seeds vacate this way) and placing them in 400 oven--only took 15 minutes to finish in the over. Cooked tortillas, added some mozzarella (didn't have cotiija), then the onions/shrooms and red and poblano peppers. Very yummy and roasty! Agree with other reviewers--double or triple ingredients. Would like to try the half/half, creamy idea from others next time. only gave 3 stars as I'm not sure it would be so flavorful if peppers were just sauteed.

SO-oo good! I grew poblanos last summer and wanted a good, quick recipe for them. This was it. Absolutely yummy. Yes, portions are small, but the flavors are rich, so I think they're meant to be a side or first course, nota main meal.

Absolutely, totally horrible! I am assuming that the other reviews are based on the relative tastiness of the cheese and the salsa. The vegetables were a mushy slurry of bland sliminess; a complete waste of crimini mushrooms (which can be outstanding). This is the type of recipe that uses vegetables in order to sound like a gourmet taco, but the long and the short of it is that this recipe was completely and totally dependent on cheese to give it any flavor. Don't fool yourself into thinking these are anything but cheese quesadillas. I tried to compensate for the lack of flavor in the vegetables by adding garlic, more cumin, salt and oregano. This improved the flavor somewhat, but it also further diminished the volume of the vegetables. After having tried several excellent, simple and rustic Mexican dishes (Rick Bayliss's Chard Tacos), this proved to be an enormous fail. Went to bed hungry rather than piling on the cheese- I wanted something filling, not greasy or bland.

Made these for a vegetarian couple. They were quite good. Do double or triple the recipe.

I thought this was great and easy to make. I included an anaheim chili pepper I had on hand, green pepper, corn, and after adding the cumin, I added some Port wine I had that was already open and simmered until the wine was reduced. I used goat cheese and cheddar cheese + arugula + tomatoes. Very lovely. I also double/tripled the recipe - can't go wrong!

Very good but do even triple the recipe I added 6 poblano pepper and a pint of mushrooms so everyone can eat. I have in the past just made it with the poblano peppers and added sauted onions, garlic and corn plus added heavy cream and sour cream to the pot very easy and great tasting. Cubed potatoes can also be added.

Yes to doubling! These are delicious, and can be made more decadent (closer to rajas) if you reduce a little half-and-half or (why not?) cream over the veggies before serving. Not such an indulgence if you leave out the Jack cheese.

A delicious, healthy and easy recipe. Definitely double if you want left overs. Any favorite cheese works. Have made it several times and will keep making it.

As everyone else has noted, double the recipe! Small portions, and you'll want more! I used shredded cheese instead of sliced. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. I didn't miss the protein at all! If you're trying to go veg, cheese+mushrooms+frying is the way to start! I made these twice in one week, once for myself, and once when my meat-loving BF came over because I'd raved so much about them. He loved them (the second time, I made a chipotle crema..they could use a touch more heat. Maybe some minced jalapeno along with the poblanos would help?).

These sounded kind of strange at first but they were excellent! I used whole grain tortillas, and added some avocado and feta cheese on top along with a squirt of lemon juice. They were absolutely delicious! I will definitely make them again!

My husband and I really enjoyed this dish. I added some grilled chicken into my husband's tacos, and used a whole grain, low-carb tortilla. These are simple, quick, healthy. We will make again!

Rating this one with 4 with a few modifications. 1st - I added some green bell pepper since the previous reviewers suggested the recipe wasn't enough for more than one person. Instead of doing a bunch of toppings we made guacamole which was great on top. Used shredded mex blend cheese instead of sliced. Also added some cayenne pepper when adding the cumin. This was a great, quick weeknight meal! Very delicious and filling!

These were the best tacos I have ever had! I followed the recipe to a "t" except I added a little more protein (per my husbands request) and used some chicken breast. They turned out restaurant style! All I can say is WOW and I am looking forward to cooking and eating them again soon!

My husband and I loved this recipe! The only thing is I had too triple the recipe in order to have it for a dinner for four. everyone loved it though!

Rating: 3
Simple and delicious dinner. Will definitely make again, but will a little more spice - probably homemade taco seasoning to get the recipe up to 4 forks. I doubled the recipe & ended up with 6 tacos.

these tacos are delicious! they're kid friendly too. my daughter doesn't even like peppers, of any kind and she loved these tacos! i'm making them again next week :-)

Yummy! I loved these tacos. Followed the recipe exactly and it was a delicious meal. Note, make more than it says (unless you are cooking for one). I made this yesterday and thankfully I had double the amount, otherwise, I would have ended without dinner, my husband ate 4 of them!

Absolutely a keeper, and easy to modify for variety. If you have even the smallest attraction to this recipe, give it a go. Use your skill, and you'll get something to talk about later.

My husband and I loved these! We made 3 each with feta, shredded lettuce, avocado and salsa.

Delish. I added a little chopped garlic, some Pico Pica hot sauce, black beans, and a large bunch of cilantro to the mix. Great twist on regular tacos.

absolutely delicious! I ate all four myself! I even forgot to add the cumin and I have to say, it was still so wonderful and fresh tasting. I chopped up some avocado and tomatoes, added shredded lettuce and used greek feta. The feta added just the right amount of zing. Loved it.

These are truly the best tacos I have ever made. I added some asparagus tips which complemented the veggie mix nicely. My husband added a dash of cajun spice and hot sauce after he deemed the first batch to mild for his tastes. He was right - the new spices added just the right amount of kick. Delicious!

Made these last night for dinner and loved them. Had to use a different pepper because the grocery store next door doesn't carry Poblanos. Can't wait to make them again.

I stuck religiously to the recipe and we absolutely loved it. It goes to the top of our vegetarian dish list. You can barely tell it's vegetarian as the mushrooms and extras really "beef" it up.

This was very good, but it could a little garlic or spice to enhance the flavors.

Yum! These were pretty darn tasty. I made two per person, but they were so good I really wouldn't have minded eating three or four...

Excellent and innovative. I used more mushrooms than called for (no problem with sogginess). Don't skip anything because the flavor blend is delightful. We are carnivores trying to cut back and this satisfied us both. Great for gluten-free diet too. No sacrificing with this recipe.

Not sure the problem andrica from Austin had with the mushrooms being soggy, the mixture cooked perfectly for me. These were delicious, even my meat-and-potatoes boyfriend enjoyed them for lunch. I topped with cojita cheese and salsa as that's all I had in the house for toppings - warm, cheesy, mushroomy deliciousness!

Have made it twice. Yummy and full of flavor!

Truly excellent. The feta cheese is what makes this recipe, so avoid the temptation to skip it. So good, we'll be having it for dinner again tomorrow.

I added crumbled Italian sausage to this dish and it was delicious. The sausage didn't overpower the peppers or the mushrooms, just added another kick of flavor and spice, as well as a bit more substance (for the non-vegetarians in my life).

This recipe says that you should cook the mushies, poblanos and onions together, but I found that the mushrooms were soggy and over-cooked in the end. they need to be cooked seperately or thrown in at the last.
