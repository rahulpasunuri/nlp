I used 3 Tbsps of lemon juice which was fine. I preferred this recipe to the other recipe on this site, plum and red wine sorbet.

I used Santa Rosa plums from our tree; 9 of various sizes gave the right weight. I took the earlier cook's advice and used just 1 Tbsp. lemon juice and the sorbet was tart enough. Substituted amaretto for the kirsch and it was fine.

The only thing I would do differently next time is cut way back on the lemon juice. 1 tbl would be more than suffucient.

We have used this twice now for a dessert selection at our Inn; great consistency and flavor-one of the staff favorites (next to fresh raspberry w/creme de cacao & strawberry sambuca). Last time I did double the kirschwasser and liked it even better.
