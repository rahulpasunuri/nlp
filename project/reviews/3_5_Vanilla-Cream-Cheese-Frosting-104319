Simple and delicious. This is my go-to cream cheese frosting recipe. It is not-too-sweet and has just the right amount of tang. Smooth and easy to spread.

Just what it is supposed to be, tasty, sweet but tangy white frosting. I kid myself that cream cheese frosting is somehow more nutritious than buttercream. Had a problem with lumping, first the butter in the cream cheese, then the powdered sugar. When I switched from the paddle attachment to the whip it was solved, smoothed out and whitened up perfectly.

A decent recipe. I used lemon extract instead of vanilla to top my red velvet cupcakes with blueberries and strawberries for the 4th of July. I would definitely recommend sifting the sugar before adding into the cream cheese and butter. I used 16 ounces of cream cheese, simply b/c I didn't feel like cutting it; turned out fine but very creamy. I popped the bowl of icing into the freezer for a bit b/c I read it was too loose and wanted to spread it nicely. That worked out well. If I had been making a layer cake I think I would have used bamboo skewers to keep the cake from sliding while icing it. I'd make this again.

This recipe was so quick and easy, it was a gem. The consistency was good for piping and the flavor was a perfect combination of sweet and sour (from the cream cheese).

Perfect cream cheese frosting- no adjustments needed at all. This went over red velvet cookies and made them look decadent, rich, and very elegant looking. Taste was absolutely perfect- no complaints at all.

This frosting was disgustingly sweet even after two cups of powdered sugar. I think the point of cream cheese frosting is to taste the cream cheese. After tasting mine, I decided to use 16 ounces of cream cheese instead of 12, two cups of powdered sugar, and then added the juice of two lemons as well... that was much better!

For everyone who states it is too thin, Adding more sugar won't help. Little known fact about cream cheese frosting is that you can completely over-beat it and it will turn into runny mush. Mix it as little as possible. If you use both the butter and cheese at room temperature, and sift your powdered sugar before adding, it will not require as much mixing, thereby giving you a stiffer texture. Hope this helps some of you~!

Tastes great! I decided to use this recipe to frost a 3 layer cake, however, and it was way too creamy to even hold the layers in place. That aside, if you're using it on a one layer cake it would be great and it tastes wonderful.

Made this to frost the chocolate cake recipe that I made into mini cupcakes. I halved the recipe as I had halved the cake recipe adding 8oz. cream cheese and about 2 T. orange juice. The OJ brought out the tang of the cheese but is subtle. I'm very happy with the taste but the consistency isn't as stiff as I would like so aim going to add more powder sugar to stiffen it up for piping.

This is pretty good. I made it as written and everyone loved it, but I wasn't much of a fan (probably from tasting it too many times between sugar additions). If I were to make it again, I'd cut the sugar to 2 or 3 c. I'd also skip the vanilla and use 1/2 the butter.

Very easy to prepare, used vanilla paste for a more rustic look, turned out great, used it on a red velvet cake, looked great tasted even better.

I've made this recipe a few times, and it is very good. I didn't really see the need to amend it as some reviewers have suggested. The addition of lemon juice could be good, but I find this to be a great recipe as is.

P.S. I wrote the cake name down wrong in my last review, its 'icing' not 'frosting'. Sorry

Loved it but had to change it according to the other reviewers suggestions. I cut the sugar down to 2 cups and increased the vanilla to 3 tsp. and added a squeeze of lemon to bring out the bite of the cream cheese. It spread very well in theese adjusted measurements. If you have trouble spreading it and it is too soft, I suggest putting it in the fridge for a while, it will get firmer. I used it to frost a two layer carrot cake {the recipie is on this website: 'old fashioned carrot cake with maple and 045 cream cheese frosting' ...but I didn't use the maple frosting, I used this one.}

I use this recipe often and it is always wonderful. I do add a couple drops of lemon juice. Not too cheesey but has the tartness of cream cheese frosting that we like.

I take it back. The frosting was so delicious that I have to give it a better rating. And in all fairness, i didnt' level my cake layers, so that DEFinitely added to the kinda wobbly aesthetic. I'm gonna make it again in a couple of days and level the layers and make this work, by golly!!! *hits palm with fist*

Fantastic flavor, but totally unusable consistency. I iced & filled a four-layer chocolate cake with this recipe, and alas, it gets too sloppy at room temperature. Even in not-warm-at-all SF! Looks like my poor cake was painted by Dali. Good flavor, terrible aesthetic. Prolly be aight on cupcakes, though.

At the suggestion of other reviewers, I made the following changes to this recipe and loved the results: Used low-fat neufchatel cream cheese, cut the sugar back to 2 cups, used 5 tsp. of vanilla and added 1 1/2 tsp. lemon juice. The result was delicious -- sweet but not overly so.

Rating: 4
Followed the advice of other reviewers - 2 cups powdered sugar, 5 teaspoons vanilla, plus a squeeze of lemon juice - but otherwise followed the recipe as written, and got great results. Like another reviewer, found that low-fat cream cheese also produced a tasty frosting. In fact, made two batches, one with regular cream cheese and the other with low-fat, and couldn't tell the difference between the two.

Here are my suggested modifcations: up the vanilla to 4 teaspoons, add 1/2 teaspoon lemon extract. Since there was some debate in the previous reviews on the amount of powdered sugar - I decided to gently spoon it into the cup measure to ensure that wasn't the issue and tasted the frosting as I went along. 3 cups of powdered sugar is just *perfect*. It has an excellent flavor without being overly sweet. I added an addition 1/2 cup of powdered sugar (totaling 3 1/2 cups) and wished I had kept it at 3 cups exactly. This recipe still tastes decadent and yummy when made with neufchatel (the low fat cream cheese)

This recipe made a super light and fluffy frosting! And it tasted good too. . . However, I had to alter the recipe a bit. Definately a must to use at least 5 teaspoons of vanilla extract. Plus, only 2 cups of powdered sugar. Otherwise the frosting will become sickingly sweet.

I used this to frost cinnamon rolls and was very pleased with the results. I thought the amount of powdered sugar may make it too sweet, so I reduced it by half. It was just right.

For those that like a cream cheese frosting, this one is wonderful. I agreed with another cook by adding a small amount of lemon juice to lessen the sweetness perception. This frosting is also very easy to work with - just enough softness to make it spreadable. I will make this cream cheese frosting again!

I wish I listened and added the extra vanilla. I think the cream cheese taste was just a little too distinct for most people, but still its very good, so overall it was a success with my red velvet cake.

I love this recipe. To make it a little "less sweet", I add a little less vanilla and add a little lemon juice. Everyone always asks why mine tastes so good!

I had this frosting with carrot cake, and it was a huge success. I also doubled the vanilla, and added a tablespoon of milk. I think this will become a monthly tradition!

This is very good. After reading the other review about it tasting more like cream cheese than vanilla. I added vanilla to taste and ended up doubling the vanilla. I am using it on cupcakes. This would be very good on carrot cake. If you want the extra vanilla, remember that it changes the icing color. I am adding sprinkles and candy on top, so the color did not much matter to me. This is a keeper.

Delicious and simple to prepare. I used only 3 cups powdered sugar and it was perfect on my husband's birthday cake. Incidentally, it tasted more of cream cheese than vanilla.
