This was excellent but very, very rich. The topping was fantastic, and really help cut the richness. I would make it again, but only for chocolate lovers!

This cake is amazing! It came out beautifully - just like the picture. I followed the recipe exactly for the cake and had to add a bit more mascarpone to the topping as it wasn't getting thick enough. I'll have to try adding vanilla to the frosting, but it was lovely and fresh without it. It was a huge hit at our table.

This cake is heaven. I cooked it in a 10" springform for 30 minutes, and it is like a chocolate and whipped cream cloud. I added a bit of espresso powder to the egg yolk/chocolate mixture because I usually add it to everything chocolate.

Surprisingly easy and delicious. I baked for 35 min at the heeding of other reviewers, but felt like it was too little and thus more fudge-like than I would have liked. This is an enormous amount of topping. You could half the topping recipe and still have plenty. I added fresh rasperberries on top of the cream topping which was pretty and good.

delicious and easy. didn't use all the marscarpone but guests enjoyed adding more to their plate from the leftovers. would make again for sure! cooked several minutes shorter than recommended time.

slight revision - I stuck to the recipe but did add a tiny dash of vanilla to the whipped cream.

Stuck to the recipe exactly as written, except that my guests don't do cream, so I served that on the side. (If you had to serve the cream on the side, you might put a bunch of fresh raspberries on top or dust with powdered sugar.) But we all loved the intense chocolatey flavor, light yet dense cake, and the crispy crust. The cake has a definite "wow" factor. Baked for 40 mins, but I probably could have removed it earlier. Would be great for Passover!

The dense chocolate flavor and wonderful texture of the cake paired with the mascarpone and whipping cream on top ... an incredible combination! A new favorite dessert!!!

This was an excellent cake and has instantly become a favorite. It is our new go to dessert for when we have guests that are gluten free or for the Passover holidays.
