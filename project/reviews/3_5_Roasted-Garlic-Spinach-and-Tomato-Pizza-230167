This was really good-- made in the oven. Loved the flavor of the roasted garlic and the spinach. Added some fresh ricotta. Will definitely make again.

this was enjoyable! I made my own crust, used smoked mozzarella, and mixed some basil in with the tomatoes. Yum!

I made my own crust and the Formanator did a poor job of "grilling" the dough... A pizza stone is really worth the investment.

This is my new favorite pizza. I used fresh mozzarella and a pre-baked pizza crust.

Made this tonight, followed the recipe accordingly except I used fresh mozzarella. It was very good. Although, the crust tasted alittle like pillsbury biscuts and not true pizza crust. Next time I think I will get a fresh dough from the pizza place.
