This turkey was so good, there was literally none left over! I am going to make it again this year, and I am sure it will be a constant favorite for years to come. Last year, I didn't realize that I had to salt the bird 24 hours prior, but it still came out so juicy, flavorful, and absolutely delicious, it didn't seem to matter. Everyone should make this recipe- it may be a few more steps than you're used to, but its definitley worth it!! Happy Thanksgiving!

This was our Thanksgiving bird recipe last year, and it will definitely be making a return appearance this year thanks to rave reviews all around. This seasoning combination adds an incredible depth of flavor to both the bird and the gravy. Yum! It went over SO well last year that there were hardly any leftovers; we'll have to get a bigger bird this time around!

Best turkey ever. Exotic collections of herbs and fruits adds turkey an amazing flavor. The gravy came out delicious, too. If turkey tastes this good, I'd like to make it more often.

We wanted to try out the salting method before subjecting a Thanksgiving crowd to an untested method, so we used 1/3 quantity of all the ingredients and roasted a chicken. We left the spiced salt on for 8 hours, roasted it at 400F for 30 minutes before brushing on the glaze, then reglazed every 15 minutes until the meat thermometer beeped at us. It turned out awesome. The meat was perfectly cooked and the gravy got rave reviews from the whole family.
