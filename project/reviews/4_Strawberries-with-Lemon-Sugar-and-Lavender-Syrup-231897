This recipe was very simple to make, and the lavender syrup was absolutely wonderful! We actually put it over french toasts, which made for a great combination. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is exceptional! Only make this one with the freshest Farmer's market strawberries in season- a perfect strawberry dessert to show off the perfect berries. I use leftover lemon sugar on home baked muffins and other fruits.

I will make a strong lavender simple syrup and add it to fresh lemonade for cocktails. I had such a marvelous libation (with vodka) at a recent gathering, and it trounced the mojito, cold.

This was a huge hit. My husband doesn't like lemon so I used lime instead. I had extra lavender-scented syrup and heated it up the next night with blueberries and a touch of butter, and served with pound cake.

This was a really interesting combination of flavors. Loved it with the creme fraiche. In my opinion the lavender could have been a little stronger. I'd also use more lemon zest in the sugar next time. And if you make the sugar in advance, do definitely cover it as recommended. I forgot and had to decrust it all! Still tasty though.

Fresh and subtile. I really enjoyed the comments from the cook from Montclair. If you like the lavender here, try other lavender preparations - lavender ice cream (with - peach cobler or apple pie), or, rub a chicken with ground lavender and salt, before roasting.

Unique and phenomenal flavors, plus easy to make--what's not to like? Don't do anything different; just follow the recipe for a dessert that will equally impress a gourmand guest or your family.

SOOOO GOOD!!! I wasn't sure about the lavender initially. I thought it might be too strong but it's not. It is wonderfully subtle and delicous, not too sweet.

Really, really easy and absolutely delicious. A terrific summer dessert!

I wasn't able to find lavender (I was told it becomes readily available in late summer), but I tried the recipe without it. Very easy and very tasty. The lemon sugar is brings out the sweetness of the strawberries.

Mmmm. Made this for Easter brunch and everyone loved it. Sour cream complemented the strawberries nicely.

I have made this recipe several times now, for several different people. Although I personally love it, and really enjoy the taste of lavendar, some have commented on feeling as though they just ate perfume. Well, at least their breath will smell like flowers. I will continue to make it, as I truly enjoy it. It works well with a strawberry, raspberry, blueberry medley, too.

First made/reviewed this wonderful dessert back in April. Since then, have made several times and it is always enthusiastically enjoyed. Now that we are at the peak of luscious local strawberry season and my lavender is blooming profusely, I made this again for a family beach picnic on Canada Day. Prepped all the ingredients and packed in separate containers, heated the lavender syrup to simmering and placed in a thermos bottle to keep warm. Everything held and travelled very well. Assembled at the last minute and served in plastic champagne flutes with long parfait spoons. My young granddaughters named it Princess Strawberries because it looked and tasted so special. 'Twas a deliciously elegant finish to a casual picnic supper. So, if you have plans for a picnic.....

This was the perfect ending to a light summer dinner. The syrup gave the berries a light flavor and the lemon sugar added punch.

Honey-lavender syrup is amazing. Guests have a hard time determing what the flavor is but love its complexity. Great for sweetening and adding flavor to less than perfectly sweet strawberries. The lemon sugar definitely adds to the dish but is not essential. Serve over first rate vanilla ice cream and get rave reviews. Perfect finale to an elegant summer barbecue.

absolutely lovely - stylish and simple. We took this on a dinner picnic and it was a hit. Next time I will reduce the honey and be braver with the lavender - the flavour could have been more pronounced. serve with home made shortbread.

Wonderful & interesting combination of flavors. Husband who rarely eats strawberries loved it and had it several times. Very easy to do ahead. Lavender sugar water lasts at least a week or two in fridge. The Creme Fraiche with lemon sugar is lovely with other fruit as well (dipped cherries in, tried with rasberries).

Fabulous dessert recipe. So simple and easy, yet major Wow factor. Served this to a picky, unadventurous eater and she loved it! Will definitely make this many, many more times.

I have made this recipe twice now to rave reviews. The lemon sugar is nice, but not necessary. I like to use a vanilla whipped cream. The lavender flowers are available from Dean and Deluca.

A lovely twist on strawberries and cream ... I used chunks of fresh ginger to flavor the syrup, but if I can find the lavender, I'll try that for sure.

My husband turned up his nose at the lavender syrup when I was cooking it. He changed his mind after tasting the final dessert and is already asking for it again! Delicious and easy.

I used just the lavender syrup on a fruit salad for Mother's Day brunch. I used strawberries, blackberries and honeydew melon. It was a huge hit.

Lacking lavendar, I used rose water instead. Deee-licious! Everyone loved it. The sauce is also exceptionally tasty on HaganDaz lemon sorbet!

I didn't have lavender so I just did strawberries with lemon sugar and sour cream. We used this as a topping on the Basic Pancakes recipe from Joy of Cooking to which I added 1/4 cup crystallized ginger. It was out of this world! I loved the lemon sugar; it even LOOKS beautiful. We also tried in espresso -- delicious. Will definitely try with lavender syrup next time.

The syrup, which is quite simple to make, is delightful paired with strawberries. It works magic on the fruit available in spring -- often not as sweet as summer strawberries. I first made this exactly as directed. For entertaining, I would definitely use the lemon sugar. Day to day, I have found that it isn't necessary. We have even put the syrup, strawberries, and a bit of fresh cream over buckwheat pancakes!

Nothing special. If you like lavendar, the strawberries and lavendar syrup are good for strawberry shortcake.

The best recipe to celebrate the first strawberries of the season. The subtle flavors of lavender and lemon complement and yet don't overpower the strawberries. Everyone was asking me how I did it!

Delicious, delicious! Took some time to find the lavender flowers but well worth the effort. Lovely delicate flavours, not too sweet and very pretty served in large martini glasses. Cheers!
