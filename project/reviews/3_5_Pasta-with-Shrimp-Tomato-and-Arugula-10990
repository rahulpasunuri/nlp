Excellent! Used canned petite diced tomatoes instead of fresh, and left out the onions. Will definitely make again, including for guests.

My wife and I enjoyed this recipe with a few changes. I used a chopped Serrano pepper in place of the red pepper flakes. I suggest two peppers if you like a little "fire." Also added 1/2 tsp of dried basil and 1/2 tsp of dried oregano. The 4 oz. of feta cheese melted as part of the sauce gave more flavor to the finish.

I've been making this for several years and my family really enjoys it. I did make a few adjustments to enhance the flavor. I used only 1/2 of an onion and added roasted red peppers, steamed asparagus and some sauted mushrooms.

I have made this recipe a few times and I add a can of cannellini beans and also a tablespoon of tomato paste. Really adds some extra flavor.

This has become a regular on our menu- pretty quick and really tasty. I use fresh pasta sometimes which bumps it up a notch.

I really like this recipe and make it regularly -- usually with spinach and because we like lots of spice, about double the amount of chili. It's nice because it's not a thick, heavy cream and you don't feel too full afterwards.

A sunday night and no shrimp, so I cheated and used chicken. I figured it wouldn't have as much flavor, so I also tried the suggestion of balsamic + butter (instead of cream). It was a a welcome change from basic marinara sauce, very light & spicy. My husband liked it too, I will make again.

I made this for Christmas Eve and everyone seemed to enjoy it. I did make extra juice and added pine nuts which added great flavor.

Okay, I made some modifications and didn't follow recipe as written. I didn't have cream, so made it with butter and balsamic vinegar, as a reviewer recommended & it definitely kicked up the flavor. I found this 'okay' but not great, in order to make this dish 'great' it needs modifications! I LOVE pasta dishes, and have traveled and made many dishes. I think it's missing the mark and is just okay. My husband, from Italy, said the same thing. Not a keeper, but may make it again with many modifications (whole tomatoes from can I think may give better texture). Cut onion amount in half and don't make with chicken stock & cream, maybe seafood stock or more wine - clams or scallops would be yummy addition to this. Have fun, but make once and then alter is my recommendation.

This is a dinner party favorite. I always receive comments like "restaurant quality" whenever I make this pasta. Generally use spinach in place of arugula and double the sauce. Plan to make it again tonight!

I made a few adjustments by thickening it with a roux, using shrimp stock instead of chicken, and adding in a little bit more garlic. It made my brother happy (and he's one tough critic) so I'm not complaining.

An excellent easy recipe for pasta without the heavy tomato or cream sauces. Very light, great spicy heat, and a perfect amount of garlic. If you're in a hurry, you can sub. canned diced tomatoes.

I bought some shrimp and wondered, "What could I make that would use shrimp with both arugula and tomatoes?" Since I had both and they needed to be used before they went bad. This recipe was absolutely perfect. I had just the right amount of tomatoes left and I made this exactly as written, with perhaps more crushed red pepper than it called for. I really can't imagine it being as good if you use some other greens instead, though - definitely use arugula. Easy and delicious.

This recipe is fast and delicious - I highly recommend it whether you are in a hurry or not. I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used frozen pre-chopped onions, pre-minced garlic, frozen already peeled and deveined shrimp, and plum tomatoes in a can - which made it even easier. Also, after cooking the noodles to al dente - I drained, rinsed, and sauteed in a small amount of olive oil to reheat - this removes that 'starchy' taste. For presentation, instead of adding sauce to noodles and mixing, I served the sauce on top of the pasta, sprinkled with some shaved parmesan cheese and topped with additional chopped arugula. If you haven't made it with arugula - you must try it - it makes a big difference in the flavor. A keeper! I would have given it 3.5 forks if possible.

This was really delicious! I doubled the sauce and shrimp to serve 4 big eaters. I also used anglehair pasta, omitted the cilantro, and used spinach instead of arugala. This is going to be a regular.

We didn't have Arugula or heavy cream. We subsituted Cilantro(!) and balsamic with butter, as someone below recommended. It was really delicious. We also doubled the recipe.

Made this last night for a VERY picky and traditional German mother-in-law and she seemed to really like it. I would have liked more sauce but the overall taste and presentation was great!

Absolutely delicious!! Had to substitute spinach for the arugala as the market was out, and it was still excellent. As previous posts stated there is no way this would serve 6, so make extra sauce if you have more than 3-4.

This was a fantastic recipe. Made for a small dinner party and everyone left raving about my "better than a restaurant" pasta. Very easy to make, elegant and unique. Only change I would make is to use a little less onion next time - the onion taste did not overwhelm I just found myself sorting the onions out of my way after a while though. Definitely a keeper!

It was delicious!!! I made it for a birthday party, so I actually had to make a lot more of the sauce. It came out wonderful. All guests were asking when I will make it again. No leftovers!

I love this recipe as-is BUT (with apologies to the originator of the receip) I liked my modification just as much. One of the (many) times I made this I discovered the cream I had was spoiled, so in its place I substitutued a tablespoon of butter and one of good Balsamic vinegar. Amazing! Try it and see. Do everything else the same but omit the cream and add my mods. I hope you'll like it.

I was looking for a quick recipe using shrimp and pasta, and this was not only quick and easy, it was wonderful! I used frozen shrimp, and substituted canned tomatoes (diced), and since my sons are vegetarians, vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. The arugula gave the dish a lovely peppery flavor. Delicious!

This is delicious! No arugula so substituted spinach. Also added a bit more wine, broth and cream to make more sauce. Absolutely wonderful!

My husband isn't going to take me out dinner anymore if I keep finding recipes like this! He is not a seafood lover and there was not a speck of sauce left on his plate! We loved it! I confess...I did use chopped basil instead of arugula but it was delicious!

As others have said, excellent recipe and very flavorful. It's a lot better when you eat it fresh because the Arugula seems to lose its taste and color if you microwave leftovers. Took a bit longer than I expected because of reducing all the liquids. You might want to save a little pasta water in case the pasta absorbs too much of the sauce and dries out.

Wonderful, complex flavors. A pasta that would please me at a highly rated gourmet restaurant. Easy and quick as well. I use frozen, deveined, tail-off shrimp for ease and have used mixed Spring salad greens (in a bulk bin) in the grocery store when arugula was not available. I didn't notice a difference and it was more affordable. Be sure and cook the pasta while the cooking the sauce, because it's difficult to keep the sauce warm while cookin the pasta without it cooking down too much.

This was delicious. The peppery arugula really makes the dish. My bunch seemed like a lot when raw but shrank down to nothing -- next time I'll use more arugula. It's not a very "saucy" dish, but very tasty and light. I did not think the parsley was necessary nor did it add anything to the dish. This recipe would also be good with scallops or crab as well, or any combination of the three.

Excellent recipe, but I did modify it. Instead of arugula, I substituted 15 spears of steamed aspargus cut into 2 inches pieces. Additionally I added 6 leaves of de-stemed fresh basil with the tomatoes and onions, 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese with the cream and dressed the pasta with a couple tablespoons of olive oil prior to tossing with the sauce.

I absolutely love this dish. It is so easy to make; the hardest part is shelling and deveining the shrimp! The arugula really gives it a unique "kick" and it tastes delicious! I will be making this again and again!

Since my Mom asked for the recipee before she went back home, I figured I'd better put in our two cents! We loved it and went back for thirds. I did add some dried oregano and thyme for the heck of it (Can't leave well enough alone!) Thanks everyone for recommending.

This was easy, fun to make, and delicious. I wish they had specified how much a "bunch" of arugula should be like they did with the onions and tomoatoes. Next time I will add more arugula (my "bunch" was pretty small).

This was wonderful. It was a perfect weeknight recipe. The cream sauce was so light, which i was a little worried about. I didnt return the shrimp to the skillet, just tossed it around in the pasta to warm it up again.

I've made this many times during the past 6 years, and we enjoy it just as much as at first. I omit the arugula and parsley, and instead stir in 1 bunch of basil, chopped, just before serving.
