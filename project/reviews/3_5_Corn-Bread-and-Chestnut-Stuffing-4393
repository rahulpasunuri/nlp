For those who are wondering where the cornbread component is - click the "Buttermilk Corn Bread" link at the top of the ingredient list. Or use any other cornbread recipe as your base.

While the corn bread itself is nothing to write home about, it's a wonderful base for the chestnut stuffing. I suggest using vacuum packed chestnuts. I used "canned," and they were a bit mushy. I substituted fresh tarragon and parsley for the herbs and made one-and-one-half recipes so there was plenty to stuff the 20- lb. bird and fill a medium-sized oval casserole. Everyone at my Thanksgiving table loved it.

Unexciting. It needed more herbs. I used frozen chestnuts from Trader Joe and my husband described them as "little dry nodules". Not a keeper.

Excellent stuffing; simple to prepare. Made cornbread from Betty Crocker mix, and used 10 oz can of chestnuts, which was plenty.

I gave the recipe 3 forks because although it can stand alone as delicious, IMO it's a basic, very good starting point to get creative with. Add herbs to the cornbread batter. Toss in some finely diced apple and/or cranberries. Substitute the chestnuts with sliced almonds or another chopped nut. I make some variation of this every year. What do you feel like adding?

This IS our family's annual holiday stuffing recipe. It's so moist and delicious. The combination of cornbread and chestnuts and all the herbs and spices just makes this recipe a winner! I will never make a regular bread stuffing when I can make this one.

Next time I make this recipe I will use a different cornbread recipe, the one that came with this was very dry. I added sausage and extra butter and broth to compensate for it. The stuffing was very good.

Had this for Thanksgiving, and it's the only chestnut stuffing I've ever made that I would make again. Might use a little more broth next time, but moistness is a matter of taste. The corn bread was delicious on its own too.

This is a signature recipe for me; I make it every holiday, even though it takes a lot of work. I add jalapeno to the cornbread, which gives it more zing, and I roast my own chestnuts. What I love about this recipe is that it isn't overwhelming. No meats & no meat fats, and so it doesn't have to take over the meal, like some stuffings do (especially sausage or oyster ones). This is wonderful with goose, which is my favorite holiday bird (served with cumberland sauce), as well as turkey or (less grandly) chicken. You will have plenty left over to serve with other poultry. But truly delicious. I couldn't recommend it more highly.

I love the cornbread with the fresh chestnuts. It makes a change from more typical fare. I would cut the cornbread into smaller suqres though. I have added dried cranberries to the dressing sometimes, for a touch of sweetness.

I made this for Xmas. Initially I had some misgivings about the attached cornbread recipe, as I thought it would be too dry, but it wasn't after all ingredients were added. I added a few cloves of garlic with the onions, tripled the fresh sage, added about 3/4 cup chopped parsley and some dried apricots, and omitted the egg (I like a lighter texture to the dressing).

We made this two years in a row and loved it. Works very well with veg broth for the vegetarians, too.
