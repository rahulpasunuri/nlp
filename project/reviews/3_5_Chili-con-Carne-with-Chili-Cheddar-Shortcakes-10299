I have yet to make the biscuits because I was missing baking powder & soda, but the chili was very tastey. We like spicy, so I was generous with my red pepper flakes. I used ground round because that's what I had in the freezer, and I only had a pound, so I made a half-batch with extra beans and green peppers. REALLY tastey! I'm glad that I used the leaner ground beef since everyone has commented on how greasy it can get. We tend to avoid greasy foods in our house, and we thought that this turned out really nicely. Even if we ate it with canned biscuits. :)

While I made just a few small changes to the recipe (left out the jalapenos and green peppers, and used smoked paprika), I can recommend this recipe wholeheartedly. The shortcake biscuits raise chili con carne to a lovely level. I will make this again.

Rating: 4
This is my favorite chili con carne recipes (sorry, I usually skip the cheddar shortcakes and opt for shredded cheddar on top). I've been making chili all my life and never ground it myself until this recipe - now I never use already-ground beef in anything. Grinding your own beef adds a totally different dimension to this chili.

Excellent. I've not yet gotten around to making the biscuits, and I serve this with grated smoked cheese and sour cream on white rice. I also us half the meat and double the beans, and a mixture of chopped tinned tomatoes and ketchup.

This is a fantastic recipe - my husband and I loved it! It was a bit greasy so the next time I make it I plan to cook the beef separately so I can drain it before combining it with the onion mixture. Instead of the tomato sauce, I used 1 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes and instead of the pickled jalapeño chilis for the biscuits, I used 3 tablespoons of diced jalepenos from the jar.

YUM!! I added more tomato sauce to make more chili and the taste was delicious.

Rating: 3
Wow, what great biscuits! Quite good with the Chili, too. Biscuits: had so many jalapenos that I roasted and chopped for the dough. Added two of the roasted jalapenos to the chili. Chili needed a bit more depth; added tomato paste and 1/4 cup of cocoa powder.

As made with my modifications and work-arounds, this was fantastic. All I had on hand was 1.5lbs of chopped beef, so I used that. Because several comments mentioned how greasy this was, I browned the meat first and drained off the fat before doing anything else. Even though I had less meat than called for, I used the specified amounts of other ingredients. I used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and about 1/3 of a can of chicken broth (no beef broth on hand). I wanted to control the consistency - we do not like overly liquidy chili. 1 can of kidney beans went into the mix, along with a chopped jalapeno and a handful of small sweet peppers in lieu of one large green pepper. I cooked it for about 2 hours. Near the end, to up the flavor (nice finish, but weak initial taste), I added a can of tomato paste and cooked for another 15 minutes. That really kicked up the flavor. Part of the key, I'm sure, was the chili blend I used: Pendery's El Rey blend, which seems to have a lot of ancho in it. With those mods, this was delicious. A real 'go-to' chili. It was only mildly spicey - on purpose. Another jalapeno would probably have added a bigger kick. The biscuits were also a big hit, especially with my I- don't-eat-cheese husband. Great dish for this yet-another-snow-storm evening. I will definitely make this again.

This is our favorite chili recipe. I have never made the biscuits though. I do make a lot of changes- 1 lb of meat instead of 3 and 3 cans of beans instead of 1. I usually use fresh or frozen tomatoes from our garden) rather than canned sauce. I love the complex flavor the cider vinegar and carrots give this recipe- that I never change. We misplaced our original printed copy of this recipe and were very lucky to find it here again!

This recipe had some complicated instructions including "blend into a rough meal" and "knead 6 times." I made two batches, and the first time around I tried to follow the instructions. The second time I literally threw all the ingredients in a bowl and mixed them with my hands until they became a large dough ball. I left the two dough balls in the fridge for a few hours so that we could bake them right before the guests arrived. I also didn't use the "pickled" jalapenos- just fresh ones. And in one batch I omitted the jalapenos, and that batch tasted like the Brazilian "Pao de Queijo." I also didn't bother with the cookie cutters and just made small balls--delicious.

Very good, but a little greasy. Maybe I'll drain the fat from the beef before adding the rest of ingredients and simmering.

This forms my basic chili recipe. I use 2 lbs of meat rather than 3. That thins it out a bit. I also use more beans and I vary the beans from time to time. I substitute balsamic vinegar which sweetens it a bit and I add about 6 jalapeno peppers with the green peppers. I think it is the mixture of spices that makes this a great recipe.

Wow. And not in a good way. To be fair, this was my first attempt at chili con carne (but I'm a good home cook) and this came out like taco filling. Bland (and I can't even handle medium salsa!), greasy and liquid-y. I used ground beef instead of chuck, so maybe that was part of the problem.... But other reviewers did too and still raved. I am at a loss. Will have to find a better recipe.

boyfriend and I loved - it's a perfect chili recipe. Didn't need to add S&P. It's better than Ben's (the famous chili place in DC)! Also, the servings are true to size. It definitely gives 6 one-bowl portions. Had to use two pots to cook it all, but that was ok since I omitted the green peppers from one of them. We also left out the pepper flakes.

This was super delicious and easy. I made as the recipe instructed but added some extra veggies--canned corn and mushrooms for variety and texture.I let it cook all day and then added the peppers and beans right before we ate. I am looking forward to having the leftovers!

The only adjustments I made to the recipe was to increase the beans to 30oz., add an extra can of tomato sauce, and add about 2 tblsp of salt. Came out very well, and the Chili Cheddar shortcakes were modified too, could only find pickled hot pepper rings so used those and it was spectacular. Our friends thought the best part was the biscuits, better than store bought. No kidding!

I made the shortcakes with a lentil and chicken stew, and they were simply amazing! So easy to make and quick, and even substituted another cheese for cheddar, used King Arthur white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and left out the jalapeno... Perfect side for any stew on a cold day! Definitely a keeper.

I tripled the recipe for a party and used New Mexico red chili powder. I also used 4 lbs. of ground beef and 5 lbs. of cubed chuck along with black beans. I hate green bell so I used yellow and red. At the end I put in 1 small can of Coca Cola. One friend (with a strong opionion) said it was the best chili he'd every had.

We like tomatoes in our chili so I used two cans of diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce, and one can (6oz) of tomato paste. Also I substituted ground turkey for the beef and used two cans of beans instead of just one. Otherwise I used the ingredients in the recipe and it was great--my family likes rice and didn't want to try the biscuits though I was eager to do so. It still was EXCELLENT chili--I put it in a crockpot and cooked it on low all afternoon after initially cooking everything in the large frying pan as per the recipe. Terrific balance of spices and textures. Great flavor!

This is a fantastc chili recipe. I omitted the paprika and carrots. I added a bottle of mexican beer and doubled the kidney beans. I have to confess - I love my chili "Cincinatti style" - that is, served over spaghetti. My family thinks I'm nuts, but what could be better than chili and pasta together?! Either way, it is a keeper!

First made this for a Super Bowl party to rave reviews! Used Beef Chuck (cubed - lightly coated with flour and seared in dutch oven) and ground beef (good combo- more body). Skipped the carrots but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Nice heat. Excellent fall/winter dish.

This is my go-to chili recipe. I've used ground beef and ground turkey - both are great! Be sure to add al little oil if using turkey to balance it out. The biscuits are great - be careful with the jalapenos if you have some non-spicy eaters. I make half the batch jalapeno-free then add the chilies to the sencond half. The biscuits are great with other dishes like fried chicken too! Chili is even better the second day and reheats well.

This was my first time making chili and I made it for a chili cook off at church. Didn't make the biscuits, but the chili was amazing and won 1st place out of 9 pots of chili! I substituted the 3 lbs ground chuck for about 1 1/4 lb ground beef, 1 lb ground turkey, 12 oz chorizo, did 1 can tomato sauce and 1 can diced tomatos and green chiles, added 1 can of black beans and I used a heaping tablespoon of red pepper flakes instead of leveling it off. Warning though, it was pretty spicy and although amazing as it was, I would probably just level the tablespoon next time... maybe.. I think the spiciness was the key to winning!!

I have made this chili recipe tons of times since i found it and i love it and so does everyone who eats it with me. I like to make this in my large crock pot. I don't make it entirely the same everytime but one thing i always do is use Spice V8 juice instead of tomato sauce, sometimes with a little tomato paste even. I also like to use cayenne pepper and a little extra red pepper and chili powder. It is also good with a little sugar and some chopped or julienned carrots.

Made this for a dinner party. Universally loved. I followed the suggested substitutions of the other readers (for diced tomatoes and partly ground turkey). I simmered the chile for at least three hours, which I think is needed for thickening. I will definitely use this recipe again.

Took the advice of previous reviewers, but kept it healthy. I used half the oil, 1.5 lbs chicken chorizo sausage, 1.5 lbs ground turkey, 8 oz can of sauce, 28 oz can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes, 1 can black and 1 can kidney beans, and added more carrot. Spices were perfect, a lot of kick to this chili! Next time I will try adding some celery and possibly more veggies (zucchini, perhaps). Very tasty, my boyfriend and I loved it!

LOVED this, and used the following adaptations based on comments of other reviewers: For the meat, 1 1/4 lbs ground chuck, 1 lb ground turkey 1/2 lb chorizo. Instead of veg oil, used bacon grease (so healthy!).Doubled the carrots. 1 8oz can tomato sauce and 1 28 oz can diced tomatoes. Added 2 diced chipotle peppers in adobo. 1 14 oz can kidney beans and 1 14 oz can black beans. No change to dried spices. Simmered 1 hour after adding green peppers and beans. No change to biscuits other than increasing cheddar to almost 1/2 lb.

Following suggestions from others, used this as a strong base recipe. We used just under 1/4 cup chili powder -- and it wasn't too hot at all. I'd probably up it to the full 1/4 cup next time and add a bit more pepper flakes. We used 2 lbs ground beef and meat from 2 hot italian sausages. Added 1 T cinnamon, a can of corn, and used a 28 oz can of crushed tomotoes in place of tomato sauce. Followed the biscuit recipe exactly. They are best right out of the oven - not as good if they sit for a while. Chili was quite good - we'll definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
By far the best chili I have made.I used black beans instead of kidney. I added a few diced chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. I also added one small can of diced tomatoes as it cooked-and one more small can after it was done cooking an hour. I let the chili sit overnight. Next day, I added 1 green bell pepper, 1 yellow pepper and the beans and let it cook 1/2 hour. Topped wtih shredded cheddar and green onions and served with jalapeno cornbread instead of the biscuits.

I have made this recipe several times and I always get rave reviews! In an effort to make the meal a bit leaner, I substitued the ground beef with ground turkey.

Just looking at the ingredients told me it could be a winner. It's a great basic recipe to "personalize" if desired. First time I made it exactly as directed and it was tasty- although too spicy for me. Second time no tomato sauce but used diced tomatos with green chiles and a few squirts of paste from a tube. "Chili-grind" beef is a must. Finished off the simmer with a little masa harina to add a "tex-mex" twist and a succulent gravy. Yumm. Too hungry to wait for the cakes- some corn muffins were perfect and of course some cheese and sour cream on top.

Again, another first-time for me with making chili con carne but it was easy enough and a great hit at a friends BBQ. I was a bit surprised by the amount of meat this recipe asks for and when cooking I cut it by half, even though I bought the entire amount. I would also add more beans than the recipe asks for since I felt the batch fell short. Mind you, I doubled the recipe since I was cooking to serve a large group (12+). I would definitely use this recipe again as there were no left-overs.

I just made this chili for my daughter and 6 of her college friends. They are in the process of devouring it. I made it as written, except I added about 21/2 tbsp of salt. I thought it was strange that the recipe didn't call for any. Perhaps that's why some reviewers found it bland? I also used only about 1/2 tbsp red pepper flakes per others' recommendations. I look forward to making the biscuits the next time.

I made the cheddar cheese shortcakes and we almost ate these as our whole dinner, they were so good. Inspired by a suggestion from another reviewer, I substituted part of the sour cream with half cup of pimento cheese dip (which is made with sour cream), and left out the chile (because I didn't have any). I lightly kneaded the dough in my mixing bowl until the dough came together (it was an extra large stainless steel bowl), and saved another step by dropping the dough on the baking sheet instead of rolling and cutting. The rough texture tops baked up extra crisp, which added yet another flavor level. The inside was tender. Fabulous!

we found this to be a rather delightful dish, except the first time I made it, it was waaayyyy to hot for my taste, so next modified the amount of chilis. From then on, it's been a hit. The last reviewer must be a lousy cook if they found it to be thin and watery, ours is delicious, thick and hearty. Stick to the recipe and you'll get a good result. We didn't make the cheese shortcakes, so no comment for those. Just about to go and make it for dinner tonight!

I followed tips from previous reviewers and cut the beef by half and substituted one can of tomatoes for the second can of tomato sauce. I can't imagine what it would have been like with two cans of tomato sauce. I also decreased the chili powder by half. We thought this recipe was really bad. Even with all of the other seasonings there was little flavor. More chili powder would not have improved the flavor. It needs more beans than called for. It was thin and watery -- need to simmer uncovered to reduce and thicken the liquid somewhat. I expected the shortcakes to be flakey. They had the gummy texture of canned biscuits. We could not even taste the cheese - very little flavor overall.

I have made a lot of different chilies and this is fabulous!! VERY spicy. I made it exactly as written including buying a 3# chuck roast and coarse chopping in the food processor. I was able to eliminate a lot of fat. As for the shortcakes (also fabulous and very spicy!) I didn't even try to roll them out. I pressed the batter into an 8 X 8 baking pan and baked until golden - the same 15-17 minutes. I then cut them into 16 squares. You can proceed by putting the shortcakes in the chili as suggested or serving them on the side they are great either way and oh so good.

My husband and I loved this dish. I did tweet it a bit though. I added a large bag of frozen corn, a 29 0z. can of crushed tomatoes, just to moisten up things. Very yummy, and perfect for a cold winter's night. I served this with garlic bread and Chardonay, and it was perfect!

Not sure why there is so much excitement about this recipe. I didn't find that the flavor had any real zing, and the amount of beef was truly out of proportion. I felt like my end product was more like sloppy joe than chili. No broth, SO much beef. Wasn't crazy about the biscuits either. Sorry...this certainly wasn't bad, but it wasn't special either.

I made a lot of portion changes to this recipe and replaced carrots with corn. Used Cuban Black beans instead of black beans, reduced the amt. of chili spice. The meat seemed like a lot so I balanced it out with equal parts beans. I will remake this again and again because it vanished so quickly at the last party I gave. Also, make it the day ahead of when you want to serve it, there's something about refrigerating it overnight that makes it thick and the flavors really bind well together. Did not make the biscuits, made corn muffins instead but may make them next time.

This is a family favorite, although with some modification. We like it heartier, so I use more kidney beans, and black beans - and I throw in a can of sweet corn for flavor.

Yum! The chili was amazing with very few changes. I added cubes of boneless chuck roast, instead of ground beef, and it was delicious. Also, the chili cheddar shortcakes are fantastic and very easy to make. I didn't bother rolling the dough out or cutting biscuits, but just dropped heaps of dough on a cookie sheet. They still came out great - not too hard, crispy outer shell, and perfect with the chili. I would highly recommend pairing the two!

Let me rate this recipe again. I've just made the chili for the second time this week. I can't tell you how many rave reviews this has received. Here are some of my modifications: To make the recipe more affordable, I opted for 20% ground beef. Used one can of corn in addition to the dk. kidney beans and green peppers. I am definitely adding this recipe to my mainstays. A couple of experiments I might consider in the future: use ground chicken/ ck. broth, add chocolate or cocoa powder... or possibly espresso powder. With such a great basic recipe, the possibilities are endless!

I tried this recipe ten days ago after my husbands constant requests for chili which I always found so boring, so wouldn't make it for years. Well, this recipe changed my mind, absolutely delicious and tonight I'm making it again - willingly! My only complaint is that it is way tooooo hot, so have toned down the amount of chili powder and flakes this time. Adding sour cream to serve (too cool down the chili heat) and didn't bother with the cheddar biscuits, may do some other time.

We really liked the biscuits. Sifting the flour is necessary if you want fluffy biscuits. I had some jalepeno cheese dip on hand and substituted 2 T. of it for the sourcream.

I am very perplexed that there were only 6 contributors who actually tried the recipe as written, but there were many more that voted on its validity. Most seem to change the recipe to such an extent that bears no resemblance to the original, and then vote on its success. How can you do that? It is beyond understanding. Read the recipe clearly. If you think it sounds interesting, read other recipes that might sound more interesting. THINK about it. Take a walk and ponder it. But for Cook's sake, review it honestly.

This was a hit in my family, especially the shortcakes. I made the following changes to the chili recipe: ground round instead of chuck; omitted carrots, bell peppers and red pepper flakes; added a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes. The leftovers make great chili cheese dogs for lunch the next day.

Wow, I wish I had some reviews before making this. Ditto to another reviewer who used chili powder from an indian grocery. 1/4 Cup of this is way too much for the recipe....I LOVE spicey, but this is enough to knock you flat. I had to add more stock, more tomatoes and some brown sugar to make it edible. Please don't make this mistake! It's very difficult to turn down the heat...

Not liking to bake I passed on the shortcakes especially since tortillas are everywhere. I've been making my own chili since Davey Crocket died at The Alamo. I'm really tired of it! I tried this recipe and found it quite good. I'ts missing a little zing and the next time I will add 2 diced Jalapenos. Carrots were a first for me in chili. Did it add anything? I don't know but carrots go with most everything. Now, forget the tomato sauce unless you want to make paste for your kids or grandkids. Use a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes instead. Trust me. Now, this is the time saver and fat reducer. Sautee all the vegies except beans with meat. The juices from the vegies and meat replaces the need for oil or fat and will sautee nicely. A potato masher makes everything easier. Not liking Mid Eastern food I passed on the chocolate and cinnamon as many reviewers mentioned. Maybe next time I'll be brave and try it.

This was the best chili I've ever had and my picky Husband loved it too (although it was too spicy for my 2 year old - next time I'll go easier on the red pepper flakes). I did make some substitutions - turkey instead of beef (healthier), diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and black and kidney beans instead of just kidney beans. FYI - I put cheese and sour cream on top of mine and the sour cream ruined the flavor so I would recommend no sour cream. Very Tasty!

I'm not a huge chili fan, but decided to try this. I thought it was great. I did tone down the chili powder a tad, but not very much. I thought it had great taste and flavor. I did cook my beef in a different skillet in order to pour off some of the grease, and I did not feel that it altered the flavor at all. I also added a can of diced tomatos. My husband who loves chili throught it was great. This is a great recipie to turn up the heat or tone it down for kids. This is a keeper. The bicuits were yummy as well.

Finally, a chili recipe that I like and would make again! This was the best chili I've made. The carrots were a nice touch. The beef was just great. It was a tad greasy but I felt that's what gave it the flavor in the end. I didn't make the biscuits, but next time I will. I will definitely be making this again before the winter is over.

Bland, bland, bland! After making all this chili, we had to do MAJOR tinkering to make it tasty! Not sure if I will try this recipe again but if I do, I will definitely use some sausage meat as a previous reviewer recommended.

Simply the very best chili I had ever made or tasted. I substituted Quorn brand "Grounds" (vegetarian ersatz ground beef) and used two 28oz cans of diced tomatoes. The carrots added some subtle sweetness that rounded it out sublimely. (I also cut way down on the chili powder and the pepper flakes for my kids, and used only 1T vinegar). Superb!

I made this on a cold, snowy day, and it really hit the spot! i did reduce the amount of pepper flakes and substituted a couple of diced chili peppers, also added some chopped tomato and additional beans. and the shortcakes were yummy! i used pepperjack cheese instead of cheddar and peppers, and dropped them instead of rolling the dough, and they were a real hit.

I am not a big chili fan, but break down and make it every now and then for my partner, who loves it. This will definitely be made again! Even I liked it. The shortcakes were my favourite part. I used half beef/half turkey. I also sauted the meat in a separate pan to cut down on the grease factor.

This was a nice chili recipe. I did tweek it a little. First I added 1 can of whole tomatoes chopped, add added a bit more broth. I also decreased the amount of chili powder. I prefered to serve the shortcakes on the side. So I garnished the chili with a dollup of sour cream and a sprinkling of cheddar cheese. It was a nice hardy meal on a cold night.

Have made the recipe as written several times and really like it. Tonite, I "Somersized" it and it was even better! (If you're not familiar, it's kind of a low carb thing). Anyway, had to forgo the biscuits, but served with cheddar cheese, sour cream and green onions on top. No beans, one can of whole tomatoes (15 oz) instead, simmered for a hour. Had only 2 lb of meat, so cut spices in half and it was still zesty. Used low salt beef broth and ended up adding a pinch of salt; also a pinch of cocoa when adding spices. Good this way, good as written.

I like this recipe, but think it's missing something. It's good, but not great. Also, I think it calls for too much vinegar. I had to add about a 1/4 cup of brown sugar to cut the overpowering vinegar flavor. My other complaint is that it is quite greasy, and I next time will make this with a mix of ground turkey, pork and beef instead of all beef.P>Over all though, it is a good base recipe to play around with.

This is a really good base for chili. The biscuits are wonderful, and I took the advice of other reviewers and did 1/2 cornmeal 1/2 ap flour. The changes I made to the chili were minor. I soaked black beans the night before and they were perfect for the chili after being simmered for an hour in the morning. I used a little more tomato sauce, 1 green pepper and 1 red pepper, 2 pounds of beef chuck and 1 pound of italian sausage. The chili had a nice, spicy flavor and the biscuits were a wonderful surprise at the bottom of the bowl.

I'm in the minority here, but I thought it was hot....and I didn't even add 1/4 cup of chili powder....but was just flavorless. My husband added brown sugar, more garlic, a little more cumin, parsley and Nature's Seasoning. It is now edible but we will be going back to his wonderful from scratch recipe. I'll try the cheddar shortcakes with his chili next time we make it.

Made this recipe for several friends and received rave reviews. As do most experienced cooks, I added my own variations. I used 2 lbs. of ground beef and 1 lb. of Italian sausage meat. Also added (because I had it on hand) a tbs. of ancho chili powder. Used 3 different beans - white cannelini, red kidney and black beans, and 1 red and 1 yellow pepper, and 1 lg. 28 oz. can Italian tomatoes with puree. Seems like I made a lot of changes but the proportions stayed the same and the seasonings were right on.

I reviewed the suggested alterations and agree with most (especially more beans, less meat), but must say that 3 serrano chilis was a tad too much, even one would be fine. The biscuits were excellent...might even add another cheese and diced pancetta! Keep the fat and reduce butter; get 'em crispier.

Loved this chili. Followed the recipe exactly, down to the carrots, which I believe add a subtle sweetness and texture in the same way they do in a good stock. I did play with the shortcakes in response to one reviewer's comment that cornbread was still preferred: I substituted cornmeal for 1/2 C of the flour. They were dynamite!

It's time to give back. I've appreciated other's input as it has helped me decide on recipes. So here's my contribution: Change amounts to below... 2pd beef 1/8 chili powder 1 1/2 tbsp cumin 1tbsp paprika 1/2tbsp red pepper 1 1/2 tbsp garlic 2tbsp cider vin. 60oz beans 3 carrots 32oz tomato sce. Then taste for cumin, salt, pepper. Otherwise biscuits are PERFECT and these changes will balance out the meat/beans/sauce ratio. LOVE IT ;^)

not bad. I prefer making all of my latin american dishes from scratch and so I opted for cooked beans (pinto) and fresh tomato sauce. this takes lots more time, but I always make large amounts and spend a day preparing each. not feasible for everyone, I know, but: muy authenico, y muy delicioso!

Perhaps "carne" is Canadian for corn;)

If you lived in New Zeaaland you would sure hesitate to include cans of tomato sauce (in any recipe - may as well just ladle in the sugar)Better to use cans of chopped Italian tomatoes, preferably spiced. Also, throw out the canned beans and soak and cook your own. Black beans are the best. Don't smash the meat around. Leave it in lumps about the size of olives, but fry it first. Now we're getting somewhere. What dork was it who said 'con carne' meant 'with corn'? In this country we'd call him a drongo, not a gringo !!

I made this for a friend's family since they always order out on Sundays.. I didnt bother with the shortcakes.. too fattening and not something I'd eat in general.. I made a few changes to the recipe. I left out the carrot and only put in one green pepper instead of the two. I also used two 15 oz. cans of kidney beans, but will use 3, maybe even 4 next time, and I also used a 29oz can of tomato sauce. It turned out really good. Everyone ate it up, and there's only one bowl left for me.. =(

My husband said this was the best chili he's ever had. I liked it very much but perhaps poured off too much fat - it wasn't as soupy as I like. Instead of a 19-oz can of kidney beans, I used a 15-oz can of black beans and a 15-oz can of kidney beans. I also replaced one of the cans of tomato sauce with diced tomatoes with chilis. Next time may add 2 cans of tomatoes. The biscuits were delicious. I preferred to eat them alongside the chili instead of in the bowl with it. Used only 2 very large jalapenos in the biscuits - wish I'd used all 4. Topped the chili with sour cream. Yum!

I bought some chili powder from an Indian grocery store and it has a lot more fire power than the kinds you can buy at a regular store. I put in less than 1/4 cup and it's still quite hot, even though I have a high tolerance for spicy food. One tip I found: too cool down the hotness, add a pinch or two of brown sugar.

I added beer along with the broth and simmered for several hours. I just used plain old lager that I had in the fridge, but I think Guinness would be great too. I can't wait to try it. My boyfriend claims to dislike beans but ate up two bowls without a comment about them. The chili is better the second (and third) time around, and freezes nicely, if you're lucky enough to have any left.

This is a delicious con carne. Since I didn't have carrots on hand I did not include them. Also did not use bell peppers since we don't care for them. With the leftovers the next day, we used the chile for coney dogs...yummy! The shortcakes were good and easy to make.

Good chili. The only extra ingredients that I added were: one chopped jalapeno, one bottle Guiness beer, and some semi-sweet chocolate. Even better the next day with just the right kick. Didn't make the shortcakes, but they sound yummy!

I didn't make the shortcakes, just the chili. I used 2-1/2 lbs. of ground beef instead, and think that ground turkey would work just as well. I browned the beef first in a large skillet then added it to the cooked onions and garlic, as I don't think all of the beef would cook very quickly in the 8 quart pasta pot I was using. Other than that, I followed this recipe to the letter and it was fantastic. Perfect hearty meal for a cold night. It had the right amount of heat for my taste. If you are making this for spice-sensitive people or kids, you may want to decrease the red pepper flakes to 1 teaspoon.

Chili was a good basic recipe but I did leave out the carrots; seasoning to taste is essential here(saw one guest adding more spice to his own but that will happen with this type of dish - some like it more or less spicy).Topped chili with more cheese and sour cream. Reduced prep time with shortcakes by just molding them into "cakes" (think crab cakes)instead of rolling out to make six large shortcakes - adjusted cooking time accordingly and boy...were they good! The crowd pleasure of the two.

I doubled this recipe and made it for a crowd, and most people seemed to like it. I made it a day ahead, and the chili lost quite a bit of its zing after spending the night in the refridgerator. I would suggest adding more if you plan to keep it overnight. The biscuits were not a particular hit; most folks went for cornbread instead. Their texture was much more like a scone than a biscuit, and the cheese didn't seem to add much flavor.

Rating: 4
Absolutley loved this recipe--took some of the other reviewers advice and added double the garlic--used 2 pounds ground turkey instead of the ground chuck, which was just the right amount. Used 2 cups beef broth, but could've had a bit more. Also--used Ancho Chili Pepper and Chili Powder to add more flavor. Those chili cheddar shortcakes--oh my! So delicious. Topped off our chili w/ more cheddar and sour cream--we slept like babies after such a great fall meal.

Rating: 4
Unbelievably good, especially when served with the scone-like cakes. The chili was just spicy enough, and using tomato sauce gave it a smoother consistency than you get when using whole or diced canned tomatoes. I used ground beef instead of chunk, it's easier and just as hearty. Also left out the carrots - they don't seem to belong in chili. Probably the best homemade chili I've ever had - definitely a keeper!

the chili is great! better than the average restaurant chilis out there. i'll probably add a bit more chili powder/chili flakes next time though - just to spice things up a little. the biscuites are delicious, too - but they turned out a little bit more doughy than i like. and I had a hard time making the dough "soft but NOT sticky."

Went great as a lunch dish with a dollup of sour cream and chopped scallions, along with cheese bread, then made a fantastic set of chili dogs the next day. Yummy!

Wonderful!!! The shortcakes are worth making. Took a little trial and error, but no matter what they look like, they are delicious. Used two fresh jalapeno chilies, which was plenty. Freeze great. Just defrost and heat in oven. Just about as good as the first time. Be careful not to add all the sour cream,makes the batter to sticky. Chile is great. Didn't use the carrot or bell peppers. Used two cans of beans and one can of beef broth. Quality of spices will make the difference in this receipe. Used all Penzys (Penzeys.com)spices, plus Penzys medium hot Chile Power.

The chili was great, very meaty and just spicy enough. I did add a bottle of beer to it though, which made it even better.

The chili was good; the change i would make is to drain the meat, carrots and onions after browning so it isn't so greasy. i loved the spiciness! as for the biscuits, i had trouble rolling them out, so i formed little patties instead. they baked beautifully! (use white lily flour)

This was THE BEST! I have been making and eating chili for years and I have never had better. I substituted roasted garlic flavored tomato paste and a can of crushed tomatoes for the tomato sauce, used canned chipotle chilies in place of the red pepper flakes and substituted half of the ground chuck with whole chuck stew meat. We will be making this again and again.

Didn't even attempt the biscuits, but the chili was WONDERFUL. Had never made chili with carrots and bells before, but thought they added a lot to the dish. Anything but a bland chili, warm enough to be called a chili, but not so hot that the heat overpowered. Both kids and boyfriend loved it.

This is the best chili I've tasted. The bisquits are great too. I left out the chilies. They taste like the bread you get at Red Lobster, if yours are sticky its because you beat it too much.

This was a hit in our home. I made a few substitutes though, I used ground beef and sausage meat as that is what I already had out for dinner, also I used less tomato sauce and used whole canned plum tomatos, crushed by hand. I had trouble with the biscuits, they were too sticky, I added more flour, but they did not seem to rise very well, although they were still soft inside and tasted quite good. No complaints from my husband!

Since I first made this recipe in 1990, it's been the chili of choice in our house. Easy enough for the kids to prepare. We usually substitute ground turkey for the beef without compromising the taste at all.
