Made this with the Austrian-style crepe recipe, and I have to say I was unimpressed (rest of the recipe was good though). The texture of the sauce was thick and a little gritty, and the taste was not at all pleasant. This was just not the sweet, light sauce I was expecting, but more like baby food. My family liked it more than I, but no one raved about it.
