This recipe was actually pretty simple, I tweaked it a little and came up with one that was very simple and works! http://aplestoaples.blogspot.com/2013/01/bagels.html

My solution to the flattening issue some reviewers mention is to proof the bagels on a baking sheet after shaping them. In other words, let them rise a second time. They turned out big and tall. However, you do sacrifice a bit of chewiness due to the increased airiness. Also, I made these both with and without refrigerating the shaped bagels before baking and found that there seems to be no need to refrigerate. I threw lots of dried fruit and nuts in and they were great.

Barley, or malt, syrup, can be found at brew shops. It is used for near-authentic Bavarian pretzels as well as bagels (genuine European pretzels use lye). I paid about $13.50 for a quart (equival. 3.3lb) of BREISS CBW golden light syrup in west suburban Chicago. The brew shop said a local baker uses this one as well as one "shade" darker for their pretzels. I would never make a bagel without it. While most bagel recipes only call for a tablespoon or two at a time, you'll find you use up the quart or so before you know it! And with the right bagel recipe(!), it may come to pass that buying it in small quantities is actually rather inconvenient. Bake on!

Amazing results. I added gluten powder to compensate for protein in professional the texture was perfect.

I have reached bagel nirvana! After years of looking for the perfect bagel on the west coast, I started working on making my own. Today, on my third try, I got it exactly right, thanks to this recipe. I made a couple of minor changes based on past attempts and personal preference, but this is definitely the only NY bagel recipe I will ever need. I can now re-create a chewy, slightly-sweet, soft-but-dense bagel, reminiscent of my favorite bagel bakery (now closed), H&H. Hooray!

This is not a review it is a group of questions about this bagel recipe. I want to know how I would alter this recipe to make EGG BAGELS! I live in Colorado and I have only found 1 shop that carries Egg Bagels. Are they really that hard to make?? I was raised on Egg Bagels and need to have them! I am also curious about the Honey or Malt syrup in the recipe, does it make the bagels sweet or just allow the yeast to "grow"? I am new to "bread making" and want to try this very soon. CAN ANYONE HELP ME???

I forgot to mention two things - I don't have a stand mixer so I hand-kneaded - dough felt great and passed the windowpane test. I also made five of the bagels using hand roll method and one by poking a hole through the dough ball - the hand rolled were MUCH better looking and puffier in the end. Definitely worth it to hand roll.

These are delicious. Very NY bagel-like - except, some of my bagels flattened. I'm blaming myself rather than the recipe, but why does that happen? I used Gold Medal better for bread flour and the only variation was I didn't add as much malt to the water as called for - I was worried they'd be more like Montreal bagels. Next time I'll add all the malt though. I also wonder if the water should be more like 110 degrees and the yeast allowed to foam before malt added? I might make them that way next time to see if there's a difference in the rise. Anyway, I'll make these often, I'm from NJ and moved and am bagel deprived.

These turned out great. I made 12 small bagels instead of 8, and I added lots of "everything" seeds to the top. I will be making these again.

Great recipe! Substituted all purpose unbleached flour and honey. Other than that, followed recipe EXACTLY (even measured the depth of the water!). Turned out perfect. Only reason this recipe did not get 4 forks is that the best bagels are in NYC, and although they were extremely good, they weren't the best. I will make this many times and next time will have the malt syrup and the bread flour

Super bagels resulted from following this recipe. Very unusual for me not to make any adjustments, but followed this to treat my housemates one weekend, and all were thoroughly impressed. I thought they were great, and I'm originally from NY, so grew up with fabulous bagels. For those over here, I had my great results using Allinson Very Strong White Bread Flour, and got some Clearspring Organic Barley Malt Syrup from one of the major supermarkets, think it may have been Morrisons I found it in.

Easy Peasy! The best results I've ever had trying to make a yeast bread! For me, part of the fun of cooking is to see what I can create with my own hands, so I would never try to toss this into a bread machine to do the work for me. It's not that hard to do: I used a mixer with the dough hooks, followed the timing instructions exactly, and these turned out as good if not better than any bagel store shop! I didn't have any barley malt syrup so I used the honey instead and they turned out just fine. We ate the first batch in less than 24 hours so I made a second batch and doubled it!

Question: Has anyone tried to make the dough with a bread machine? If so, are there any modifications needed? Thanks!

Barley Malt Syrup can be found in most Health Food store and gourmet/specialty food stores.

Sounds great! I plan to use my bread machine to make the dough. Has anyone tried it? Do you think it will effect the outcome of the dough?

One reason New York City bagels {and pizzas} are unique is that the water is very, very soft. The harder waters found in most of the country changes the texture of all bread products.

In my first 2 tries, my bagels came out flat,but I tried different flour and, because the bagels passed the float test right out of the fridge, didn't let them proof any more before boiling. They came out great! Light, but plump, chewy and dense. Yum! Thanks, Peter!

This is by far the best bagel recipe I've found. It makes delicious bagels, soft on the inside, firm on the outside. My only confusion in the "water test". M bagels ALWAYS pass the water test, even right out of the fridge. Does this mean that they aren't in the fridge long enough?

These bagels are terrific. Barley malt syrup is hard to find in stores, but it is available through Amazon.com for a good price (less expensive than at King Arthur). The yeast foams better if the lukewarm water is at about 110°, instead of the recommended 95°. I otherwise followed the recipe exactly, and my bagels were picture perfect, with a dense, chewy texture and crisp exterior. Before I made these, my husband stated repeatedly that he does not like bagelshe certainly does now!

These bagels are amazing...exactly as advertised. Just a word of caution, though, regarding the baking soda. When adding to boiling water, there is quite a reaction -- my pot overflowed, sending boiling water all over the stove. Still, the bagels were worth the mess.

Delicious! Perfect texture and flavor. Followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have the malt barley syrup, used honey instead. I melted two tbsp. butter and mixed in some cinnamon and sugar and poured it over the top of three of them, wish I did it on all of them! Wife really loved them!

OMG, these are the BEST! I've been searching for a bagel recipe for years and think I've found it! They were super good eventhough I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour, used honey in the mix and no malt syrup (have no idea where to buy it but will be on the lookout for it)in the boiling water. They were light and had an even texture. A suggestion for those that were 'flat', don't put salt in with the yeast to proof, and make sure the yeast foams as another person wrote. Put the salt in the bowl with the flour (the salt counteracts the proofing of the yeast in my opinion). Also, I used the non-professional method of forming the bagels, I think less is more in the handling of the dough--though my holes closed slightly when they rose while baking, which I didn't mind. I'll try the other way (rope method)next time, as I will be making these again and again. Thank you Peter Reinhart for a wonderful recipe!!!

I have yet to make this recipe, but it looks similar to one that I do use, minus the overnight proofing. However, I do see one crucial step missing that may be why some people have flat bagels. when you make your yeast, water, malt syrup mixture, you have to wait until it foams. If it does not foam, the yeast may not be good and you need to make the mixture again. Can't wait to try this recipe. I use my other one all the time and make fabulous bagels. I think this method will get me closer to the real NY flavor. I'll update my rating once I make them. Another thing you can do is to "spritz" the hot oven with water from a spray bottle a few minutes before the bagels go in, to try to get it a little humid in there before putting in the bagels. I also agree with the previous review about making sure you are good about sealing the overlap of the ends. I try to roll it a bit to seal it. Have had my fair share of bagels opening apart.

As a New Yorker recently transplanted to Buenos Aires I often pine for tastes from home, especially bagels. I made them this weekend and think my life down here has forever changed for the better. Used honey and they came out perfectly delicious, although I think I'll also scour the stores now for "jarabe de malta de cebada." Oh, and I made an "Everything" bagel using finely chopped onion & garlic and came out great - no need to use dehydrated.

Chewy texture with slightly crisp outer layer, fairly easy to make and 100% worth the effort. Make sure to at least double the recipe because they'll be gone in seconds!

Not a convert.....we have been spoiled by a neighbor who periodically brings us NY bagels. Yum! I was excited to try this recipe but disappointed with the results. I have no idea how people get their bags to be so smooth and fat! I followed the directions and things seemed to be going well....after 60 minutes out of the oven my bagels passed the float test so I began the cooking process. At this point I wonder..even if your bagels were super fat and puffy, removing them from the cookie sheet to poach would deflate them...so, I also had flat bagels and sort of bumpy too. Decent flavor (though a little salty) and chewy but sort of an eyesore. I might try again to see if I can improve but so far I would just as soon go to Panera.

Living in a sort of bagel wasteland,I was keen to try this recipe. The bagels were very good, but they were not real bagel bakery bagels. They were kind of flat rathr than nice and round, and the crust was more chewy-crunchy than I had expected. I subsituted golden syrup for the barly malt syrup. I made one batch boiled in sweetend water and one batch with unsweetend water. My daughter and I like the sweetend batch better.

I am a believer and potentially ruined for life because I might never want to buy another bagel out again. These turned out absolutely delicious. Slightly crisper and browned on the outside and chewy and soft on the inside. You can truly taste the freshness. A few tips: you must use barley malt syrup. It really gives the bagels that authentic flavor. Secondly, if you are forming your bagels using the second "professional" method listed make sure you really focus on sealing the ends together because they may unstick during boiling (a few of mine did). Also I agree with the previous reviewer that the amount of water specified for the poaching liquid probably won't be enough for most pots. This two day process might seem daunting but it truly quite simple and well worth it!

I haven't started boiling my bagels yet - so far they look good! But the recipe says "fill a pot with 2 to 3 quarts (64 to 96 oz / 181 to 272 g) of water" which is not correct, it should be 1810-2720 g of water. Just in case someone gets the idea to boil the bagels in a cup of water:)
