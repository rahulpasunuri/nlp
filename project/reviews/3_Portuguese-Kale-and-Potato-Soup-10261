why add the carrots? first time i see Caldo Verde with carrots in my life. i did not use them, because i was trying not to ruin one of my favourite soups. the broth is also a no-no.

There's a secret to making this an incredible soup instead of bland as some people have found. Let it sit overnight! All the flavors will blend, and the soup is much better. I also added an extra clove of garlic, but the change in the soup on sitting was amazing.

When made directly as written, the soup is very bland - with just a few additions, it is one of the best sausage soups I've ever had. 1) The amount of sausage called for is about 2 links (I bought fresh ones from WholeFoods) I upped it to 3 links and I think the extra sausage was needed. 2) Look at your sausage and see what spices they add to it - and then add just a dash of those to the soup. The kielbasa that I used was made with cinnamon, clove, celery salt and coriander. So, I added just a dash of these spices to the soup broth (probably a 1/4 teaspoon total) and it really made a big difference in taste. Just look at your package of sausage and whatever it is made with, add a bit of that to the soup broth - world of difference.

Don't waste the ribs, they have nutrition just take longer to cook. Simply slice off a bit from the stem end, remove the ribs and slice like you would celery. Add ribs when you add the potatoes, stir in leaves as per recipe. Less waste, more soup, good flavor. I liked this with Italian sausage, then drizzled with a little balsamic vinegar when served instead of the oil. Gives it a great finish!

Absolutely excellent recipe and worked great for a casual dinner party. Substituted regular pork sausage for the chorizo and it was very good.

This to me is very true to the tastes of Caldo Verde, that I ordered at the many great family owned Portugese restaurants in Central Sq./Cambridge MA, where I lived for over 40 years. I used yukon gold potatoes because I love them, and eliminated the carrots ( despite my traditional French culinart training), and the yukons added at the end I sliced into very thin slices.

This is hilarious! I'm not sure how Portuguese the recipe is, but the strong opinions in the reviews are just as Portuguese as I am. Traditions vary greatly in Portugal and the Azores, but part of the Portuguese tradition is "my way is best". My family made a rustic soup called Caldo Couves - couves are a flat-leaved collard relative that we always called kale. It included whatever was available along with the greens and linguica, both cut large. Caldo Verde is an upscale version and is also traditional. It includes the chiffonade greens and just a bit of linguica or chorizo. All good.

I made this for my portuguese friend, his grandma used to make it for him. I left out the carrots and red potatoes. I also used linguica in mine. It was great. I would stick to a more portuguese style recipe.

The recipe can vary depending on which part of Portugal you or your family are from. The family recipe I use is the Azore version which also adds Ham Hocks (adds a lot of flavor) & if you have a ham bone that just adds even more flavor to it. We don't skimp on the kale, if you're making a large pot you want to use at least 3-4 bunches...torn & not cut. I ALWAYS use Linguica & pinto beans (my preference). Also, I never serve mine the first day of cooking. It's much richer in flavor as each day goes by. Your recipe just needs a little bit more love added to it.

Oh, in addition, the sausage used is called linguica. You can purchase it, here in Florida at Publix Supermarkets, my mother lives in Las Vegas now and tells me that it's also sold at Sam's club. This, is the way Caldo Verde should taste! :)

This is so far off the original version, I can't understand how they can call it Portguese. The true name, in Portuguese is Caldo Verde. There are no carrots, or chicken broth used in the recipe. My parents are both directly from Portugal and they used to own a resturant in Mass. which was featured in the National Geographic January 1975 issue, because of the food and entertainment (which so happened to be my mother, a fado singer) If you want an authentic portuguese version of this soup, google Caldo Verde.

The carrots aren't authentic and aren't necessary, but they're not an unpleasant addition. That said, the soup really doesn't need them. Also, other than the carrots, this is very close to a recipe my Portuguese friend's immigrant mom gave me, except that they would *never* use Spanish or Latin American chorizo--she considers it a more egregious error than adding carrots. If you believe her, Spanish chorizo is a totally different product from Portuguese chorizo and you *must* go out of your way to find a Portuguese store for the true thing. Newark, NJ is supposed to have a lot of them. Enjoy!

A hearty winter soup. Reminds me of The Olive Garden's Zuppa Toscana. I didn't have Spanish chorizo on hand, which is different than Mexican chorizo. I subsituted Johnsonville Cajun spiced brats and it worked out fine.

Two things, one the first time I had this soup it was in a Portuguese Restaurant in Newark, NJ which has a large Portguese population. The market and restaurant area is very Iberian. In fact, most of the restaurants have the name Iberia in it; and two, it did not carrots in it and they used collard greens, which is what I use, I also use kale because I love all dark greens had a rich garlicky chicken stock base. I modified it to my taste.

For those of you with Portuguese connections that had never heard of this your a bit lost, it is actually Caldo Verde and is considered by many to be Portugal's national dish. This recipe differs slightly as there shouldnt be carrots and only one type potatoe. If you do a search on the web you will find authentic recipes.

I have made this recipe many times as I raise kale in my garden. I have used both Portuguese sausage and kielbasa when making it.

This recipe is awesome!!! It reminds me more of an Irish kale soup, except for the chorizo and garlic, so I'd say it was and Irish/Portugese fusion recipe. I made it in a 10 qt. stockpot so I used an entire head of garlic, and tripled the amounts of carrots, onions and kale. Everything else I doubled (or a little more) the amounts in order to fill the pot, except water. Ran out of room. I also used a combination of chorizo and linguica. When I added the wax potatoes, I cut them in fairly large chunks in order to keep them from falling apart in the soup. I cut the sausage into larger chunks to match and it really came out as a hearty, "macho" soup. Like an ad says, it "eats like a meal" because you have to cut the potatoes with your spoon. I'm not sure about the suggested serving size, but I must have eaten 2 quarts by myself. I froze the leftover and can't wait to have it on the next bitter winter night.

This soup might not be authentic but it is delicious, (and there's that extra vitamin A from the carrots). Everyone loved it.

I'm not Portuguese, but I liked this very much. I made some changes, though: no carrots or russet potatoes, and I used polish sausage (cause that's what I could get!) I also added scallops at the very end, and crushed red pepper flakes. I know the sausage and scallop and kale and potato combo sounds weird, but I it was really good!

I am Portuguese and Macaunese and I totally agree with the cook from TX. Carrots?? I hate that "Portuguese" is in the title of this soup because it is anything but! If you're looking for authentic Portuguese Caldo Verde...this isn't it.

I am Portuguese and I fully agree that this is not a good recipe for the most tradicional of Portuguese soups. Carrots???? And please try to find Portuguese chourico. Spanish sausage just does not do the trick!

I am of Portuguese descent and this recipe is a poor version of the very traditional Caldo Verde soup. The soup has only kale, water, potatoes, olive oil and garnish of a single slice of Chouriço sausage. My book Portuguese Homestyle Cooking will be released in February '01 with more traditional recipes. question can be sent to me- ana@portuguesecooking.com This recipe is not the authentic version. Thank you for listening

I am also of Portuguese descent, and I agree with one of the above statements: This Soupe needs Portuguese Courico. I also think this recipe is too "fancy" for the old-fashioned Portuguese palate. Many times recipes are made from leftovers. All it needs is potatoe, kale, Chourico and a generous dolop of good olive oil and salt.

I prefer Caldo Verde to this soup. It needs more heat so I added some Tobasco sauce and hot pepper flakes It helped.

I am of Portuguese descent and am very disappointed in this recipe. My grandmother would be rolling in her grave, if she knew I was using Spanish Chorizo instead of Portuguese Chourico. If you want a real recipe for Portuguese Kale soup,instead of this bland imposter, E-mail me and I'll send you one.

USE HOT ITALIAN SAUSAGE FOR A DIFF FLAVOR MMMMM

I loved the creamy base that blending the potatoes created. A very interesting technique... but the soup seemed to be missing a flavor and I'm not quite sure what. One ripe tomato??? My chorizo was pretty good, but maybe it needed to be smokier? A more assertive soup stock? I played around with the leftovers a little bit, but still haven't figured it out.

This is a fantastic winter meal. I serve it with fresh bread and butter, and have yet to find anyone who doesn't love it.
