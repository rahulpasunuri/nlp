Simple. Quick. Great bang for the buck for both schedule and budget. Croutons add flavor and texture (and calories). Also works over rice, farro, etc. Works as side or light entree. It is what it is, made by opening lots of cans --- but it's a great fit on a chilly weekday evening. Used black beans and curly kale because that's what I had. Still a nice meal.

Don't skip the croutons, they make this dish really tasty. Also, like other reviewers, I did not have a can of diced tomatoes with onion and green pepper so I sauteed an onion and half a green pepper to add to the ragout. It's probably better to use fresh rather than canned anyway and hardly takes much extra time. Will definitely make this recipe again as a main dish for a simple vegetarian weeknight dinner.

Absolutely delicious! I have made this numerous times because it is so easy and scrumptious. I like it best with baby kale, but mustard greens work well too.

This a fantastic kale side dish, or arguably a main meal. I used 1/2 tsp of red pepper, but even that was subdued by all the veggies. A great big hit.

Extremely simple and pretty tasty. Everyone in the family ate it, but no one raved over it. The croutons are excellent and give another layer of texture to the dish that elevates it.

Made this for dinner tonight and we all loved it (my 1 yr old and 4 yr old included). I used my own homemade marinara instead of the canned tomatoes and skipped the coutons. Served it in a bowl with garlic crostinis to scoop it with/eat it on. Love!

What a great way to use kale! We had no crushed red pepper so I threw in a couple of whole dried red peppers and dash of cayenne, as well as sauteing an sweet onion. Had no italian bread, so topped with toasted bread crumbs (mixed with garlic powder, parmesan cheese, salt pepper and cayenne). Served with freshly made brown bread-yum! Super easy to make, too.

Flavorful, fresh, and hearty winter meal. Hard to mess this one up - most ingredient amounts can be varied to taste. We used regular diced tomatoes instead of ones with green pepper, etc., and it turned out great. The croutons are a perfect complement to this aromatic dish that's rich with flavor and filling but not heavy.

Fantastic, easy recipe. I used lacinato kale, skipped the croutons, reduced the olive oil to 2T, and served on brown rice. Great as a simple vegan meal.

Great way to use kale from CSA! Freezable. Definitely recommend including the croutons, adds necessary dimension to make it "dinner", otherwise would be a good side dish. My 2 year old picked out and ate the beans and tomatoes, and my meat eating husband and I enjoyed it thoroughly.

Please make this. Reviewed a year or so ago & gave 3 forks...I now crave it..definitely 4 forks. Delicious, healthy, easy, fast, cheap, few ingredients & adaptable. What more do we want for everyday fast food? I have used different beans, fresh or dry thyme, bouquet garni, different tomatoes, done the bread in the oven, rubbed with garlic & by the book. It is always gone in one day.

I added a package of sun dried tomato chicken sausage - I sliced and cooked it ahead of time and added it in with the canned tomatoes. It was a delicious mix!

Rating: 3
Super fast, easy, healthy and hearty. What more could you ask for? Used chicken broth and added water (broth was salty)to make a soup version of this. Added sliced italian sausage to make this even heartier (soup for dinner!). Toasted some sourdough that was buttered and sprinkled with parmesan cheese to go with the soup. Delish! Plan on making often with other dark green leafies, too. =)

Really good and easy to make. I added a vegan meat substitute to make it all the more hearty. Nice to see vegan options here. Will definitely make it again.

So flavorful, healthy AND easy! I didn't think my hubby would like it, 'cause he's not a fan of kale, but he exclaimed "This is gooooood!" I accidentally bought diced tomatoes with chili peppers from Trader Joes, so it ended up really spicy (didn't realize it until after I added the red pepper flakes!). I'll definitely make it again with the right tomatoes. Otherwise, it was awesome! I cooked it a little longer to break down the tomatoes a bit, used chicken stock instead of veggie, and also added some Parmesan cheese on top. Next time I might add some Italian sausage. Yummmmmy! And definitely don't skip the croutons-- they really make the meal!

I've been making this soup for about 5 years now. It is wonderful on cool fall days. The ultimate comfort food served with crusty bread. I stopped using canned beans when I found cooked dry beans add more flavor. Sometimes I add turkey sausage but I always add thyme and extra broth for the bread to soak up. Enjoy

Rating: 4
Oh, you have to do the giant croutons. Especially if you have a decent Italian bread and fresh thyme from the garden. I brushed the bread with the oil, tossed with the finely chopped thyme, then cooked as directed in cast-iron pot. Once browned on a few sides, I tossed them with a little salt and pepper in a bowl. Fantastic with the ragoût!

PS: I also double the chicken broth, which gives it more of a soupiness.

This recipe has become a standard in my arsenal. Everyone LOVES it and I've had numerous people ask for the recipe, which is very easy. I skip the crouton thing and instead serve with crusty bread. I also can't find the tomatoes w/ green pepper and onion, so I just sautee an onion in olive oil before dropping the tomatoes on it to replicate. I use chicken broth if not serving to vegans and add spicy italian chicken sausage, chopped up coarsely. It's awesome!

I made this with about twice the stock to make it soupier, and added cooked tubetti pasta. Served it with parmesan on top. It really was outstanding! My 4 yr old son devoured it!

made this today for lunch without the croutons (watching carbs} and sauted 1/2 a diced onion and red pepper cuz I had only plain diced tomatoes. worked great, it was delish.

I looked up this recipe when we got kale in our Greenling local box (and had no idea what to do with it). I added sliced kielbasa and onion and a little white wine in the beginning and skipped the croutons, but otherwise followed the recipe. My husband hates greens and was skeptical, but he LOVED this. It is amazingly flavorful and hearty for such a simple dish. We now buy kale whenever we can, just so we can make this.

Rating: 4
this is super delicious, and a great way to eat up those dark leafy greens. i added a little oregano & xtra garlic, left a little of the bean juice in it to make a thick broth. make sure to get the diced tomatoes w/peppers & onions, otherwise i can see how it might be a bit bland. but mine came out perfectly yummy.

When I made this last night, I did make some modifications--omitted the croutons, used purple kale, fire-roasted tomatoes (so I added some onion and red bell pepper to the sauteing garlic mixture). Served it over a bed of rice, and it was delicious!!! My question to any of you is: Kale is a cruciferous veggie, and it is supposed to be super healthy--does anyone know if the purple kind has as many nutrients as the green?? I can't seem to find an answer to this question... Thanks to any of you who respond. Diane

Had lots of kale so tried this one. Sort of like a light & quick minestrone. Added extra broth(soupier), used dry thyme & next time will buy fresh. Did the croutons/bruscetta in 400 oven, brushed w/olive oil & when finished, rubbed w/garlic. Delicious for soaking up the broth! Will do again. Also some romano grated over all.

Excellent, fast and EASY!! Also really nutritious. I used about half the olive oil recommended with the garlic and it came out really well. Very hearty and perfect for fall/ winter weather!

This recipe was great! I used a multi-grain baguette for the croutons. I sprinkled them with parmesan cheese when I pulled them out of the pot - they were awesome. For the rest, I sauteed 1/2 a tiny can of tomato paste along with the garlic and crushed red pepper. That gave this ragout some additional flavor. Like others, can't believe how easy and GOOD this was. Highly recommend!

Rating: 4
Give this recipe a try! I too, can't believe such a simple recipe can have such a wonderful aroma and flavor. The last batch I made had a really thick broth, probably fromm the bean's starch, and also the brand of veg broth I used. I like vegetarian food and my family likes meat...even my meat eating family loves this ragout. We have an awesome bakery nearby where I get baguettes..sliced and toasted in olive oil, then soaked in the bowls of ragout, is such a winning combination.

I'll keep it short and sweet...I loved this recipe. My husband did, too, and I will definitely make it again. Make sure you use Goya brand beans -- they stay firm.

Amazing! This was so easy to make and yet so good. The ragout smelled great and was very flavorful. And the croutons were delicious as well (I used ciabatta and left some of the crust on). I will definitely make this again.

I love this recipe: easy and delicious. Like another reviewer, I use sourdough bread for the croutons, and I cut them in smaller pieces than recommended (about 1 inch cubes). Croutons heat up well in the toaster oven.

Rating: 4
This is one of the easiest, tasty and healthy recipes I have made and I make it about once a week in the winter. Sometimes when I feel lazy, I chop up the bread, spray it with olive oil and toast it, rather than pan cook the croutons. I have found Ciabatta bread works great and is the easiest to chop into cubes. Also, on lazy days, I season the stew with dry time instead of fresh. Works fine.

Good with any strong flavored greens. I had fresh tomatoes so I used them and sauted a bit of onion and green peppers. Canned would prbably be fine too. Dinnt do the croutons

I have to agree with most of the reviews thus far. While I like kale, i have to admit I was a little skeptical if this very simple recipe was "all that." But while it doesn't look all that appetizing, to tell you the truth, one of my co-workers today couldn't believe how good it smelled, and I couldn't believe how good it was! I followed the recipe to a "t" with the exception of using sour dough bread for the croutons. D-lish.

You can really taste the health just flowing from this recipe. It's like a salad in a soup. This is the first time I've ever eaten kale, and I must say the soup was rather good. I used fresh tomatoes, stewing them with a dried basil sprig in water after frying the onion and garlic. After stewing the tomatoes, I added the kale and broth and followed the rest of the directions. I wish I had cut the kale a bit smaller and had used vegetable broth to stew the tomatoes (instead of plain water) so that I could get some more flavor out of the soup.

Rating: 4
We have made this dish three times since we found it a couple months ago. It is delicious. We used fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of those suggested. I've never made the bread, but have beefed the stew up with tubetti pasta. Try finishing it with fresh grated parmesan and a drizzle of good olive oil at the table - that puts it over the top for us. It's a perfect healthy, easy, quick and cheap one-dish meal to have in your repertoire.

This recipe was a very pleasant surprise! I had bought kale at a farmers market and didn't know what to do w/it. This recipe is not only healthy but the flavors are delicious. I didn't make the croutons but I would imagine it would only add to the flavor.

I agree with the previous reviewer that this is a good recipe for including kale in your diet. Whole Foods had a great selection of organic kale this week, although I think a dark green 'common' cabbage would also work. Making it for the first time last night, I learned that this recipe goes fast, so prepare all ingredients ahead. Also, cutting the kale into the right size pieces (not long strings or otherwise big chunks) will make it a much better meal. San Marzano canned whole tomatoes, processed in the food processor until chunky worked well, flavor-wise. I also made the croutons with sour dough bread, but choosing a more healthful bread would certainly work. This is a good weeknight vegetarian meal. Thanks, Epicurious.

Very flavorful and a great way to get your greens. I finished it with a bit of white wine vinegar and served with finely grated parmaseano reggiano. I didn't make the croutons but next time I will, to sop up all that great soupy sauce.

I wasn't in love with the texture of this ragout. I ended up with very thin, tomato-thyme broth and then the kale-tomato pieces-bean solids. Next time I will put about a third of this in the blender and then stir it back in to give it some body. I also plan to add sage to give it a little more bass note.

I'm always looking for good recipes for greens and this one is a winner. Very flavorful! I didn't bother with the croutons -- didn't feel they were needed. Did use Fire-Roasted Tomatoes and chicken broth instead of vegetable. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

I loved this soup. It was beyond compare. But, of course, I added my own special touch to it. My husband would never eat anything that didn't have meat in it so I added 3/4 lb of hot Italian turkey sausage. Didn't have any cannellini beans so I used great northern and lima beans. And to top it off, I left the croutons and use firm pollenta ... added to the pot just before serving. I can't wait to have the leftover for lunch tomorrow.

I almost missed out on this recipe because reading through the ingredients I didn't think this would anything special. Boy am I glad I listened to the other reviewers and gave it a chance. It was quick and easy to put together and was extremely flavorful, not at all bland like I'd feared. This makes a great weeknight dinner and I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch today. A perfect healthy, cold-weather comfort food!

This was great even with my modifications...my tomatoes had basil & oregano in them (not green pepper & onion), which changed the flavor but we didn't know any differently so tasted great to us! I made the whole thing with less broth than called for, and served it plated with a boneless skinless chicken breast (done in the George Foreman with salt, white pepper and springs of fresh thyme) on top. We also used whole wheat bread for the croutons and it was still great. And this whole thing looks fabulous and took about 1/2 hour to prepare (everything!)! Great winter weeknight dinner, or even casual dinner party fare.
