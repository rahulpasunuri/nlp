Fair amount of work involved with this recipe and it was a huge disappointment. Sounded great but the flavors just weren't solid as one might expect. B.J. Harrick

This is a delicious side dish! Only made some changes, such as: doubled the amount of dried porcini, used more garlic, rosemary, thyme and parsley than required. Based on others suggestions, I topped with alfredo and garlic sauce and nutmeg. I believe these changes really added more flavor to it! I also agree with others that it is not necessary to use 12 tbsp olive oil.

Although this dish is costly and timely to make, it is most definitely worth it. The combination of flavors is amazing, and adding a bit of asiago cheese really adds to the texture. definitely a keeper

I used the reviews to adapt this recipe and it turned out great. I used about 2/3 the potatoes, less than half of the mushrooms and about 1/3 the porcine. For potatoes I used fingerlings, skin-on, and for the mushrooms, shitake. The lower ratio of mushroom and porcine to potato was a good balance. I used the full herbs but next time I would cut the rosemary to thyme ratio to about 2:3. Lastly, I used about 2/3 cup cream and 1 ½ - 2 cups of Gruyere. The fluid only filled ½ - 2/3 the dish and this allowed for a nice crusty upper. Everyone couldnt get enough.

If I made this dish again (doubtful) I would double the herbs and just use portabellos (or criminis) and skip the porcinis. The porcinis were too overpowering for the yukon gold potatoes. I also think the addition of both onions and cheese would make it more flavorful. This was the one dish that was left unfinished at our Superbowl party.

I made this for Thanksgiving this year (it was my first time to cook Thanksgiving dinner) and this turned out FABULOUS! I know a lot of people added cream and cheese, but I chose this recipe specifically because it didn't have either. Our family is trying to eat healthier since my mother was diagnosed with diabetes. I also wanted to cut out some of the oil so I substituted gold potatoes for the regular ones since they have a natural butter flavor. I also used unsalted chicken broth to cook the portabellas. I think I ended up using just about 2 tablespoons of oil for the whole thing. I also added some sauteed onions for a little more depth. Let's just say, there were no left overs.

forgot too mention in my last rating that I did add cream and butter

I used this recipe at work with some changes mainly the addition of black truffles and gruyere cheese used it as starch with veal as a special and people loved it including my fellow cooks and my chef.

This has all ingredients I like so should have been delicious for me but wasn't- the Portabellos were but something was lacking in the Potatoes- I can't figure it out, I think maybe should be with butter not oil- yeah and as like someone else said should have had a cream sauce of some kind- all in all came out bland (except for the mushrooms)- will not make this particular mushroom/potatoe gratin again but hope to find a better recipe somewhere because the idea was good.

I added 2 cups of shredded paresean cheese. This was good could, even more cheese would be better! I fit the whole thing in 1 (instead of 2) 9x13 dish and it came out fine. The dried porcinis were $6.00 and ounce! They didn't add that much, I would go with the previous cooks suggestion to use a mushroom mix would would be cheaper and have the same or more flavor.

We found this to be very flavorable, but we used dried thyme and rosemary so they wouldn't lose flavor during the long cooking time. We also added shallots to the mushroom mixture. Don't be tempted to over-salt, as a previous reviewer suggested; it will overpower the dish. We used mixed dried mushrooms in place of the dried porcini and replaced half the Portobello mushrooms with regular white mushrooms due to cost. The Parma cheese on top was good.

Incredible! The flavor of this dish was amazing. We added grated Asagio cheese in between the layers for a true 'gratin'. It doesn't take quite as long to cook as the recipe says .... but it does take quite a while.

Very good recipe. I only made 2 1/2 lbs pototoes and 12 oz portobellos, but kept other ingredients almost the same. I cooked it in an emile henry oval gratin dish and only made 2 layers of mushrooms and 4 of the potatoes. I will definitely make again. Serve with grated Reggiano Parmesan sprinkled on top. Yum!

Made this for a formal dinner I catered for 106 at the Austrailian Embassy in Tokyo. My test batch was horrendous: bland and not at interesting. As I had already the made the investment of the ingredients, I made the following changes: add lots of salt and pepper to the potatoes. Use less of the mushroom liquid. Replace some of the olive oil with butter. Increase all herbs. And, as other reveiwers have said, put two batches in one 9x13 to increase volume and presentation. All and all? Lots of work but delicious with the changes.

I am not sure about this recipe ... for me a gratin needs cheese and milk/cream. This was rather bland and dry and took forever to cook. The mushrooms were also rather insipid and next time I will double the porcinis and the garlic. THis makes it quite a costly recipe, though - maybe a gratin dauphinois hits the spot better after all???

Deep, flavorful taste. Absolute heaven. One of my all time favorites. I would suggest adding double the porcini mushrooms and a lot of salt. Better when eaten fresh - does not keep well.

I recently included this dish in a Christmas dinner, and it was delicious. Quite flavorful (and I really dislike bland food.) I made 1/2 the recipe in an 8x8 dish and it had perfect height. I also forgot to peel the potatoes, and they were great ... so next time, I'll skip that step again!

Sorry folks, but for us, this turned out really bland. We kept going back over the recipe to see if we missed something. The only reason I would make it again is because since everyone else loved it so much I think I must have missed something.

Delicious! You definitely can make the entire recipe in one 13x9 dish and it will come out the perfect height.

During the last few minutes of baking I could not resist dusting the top with Parm Reggiano. I'll have to try it w/o next time, but it was excellent with it. When our dinner party was finished with dessert everyone went into the kitchen and began picking at the browned potatoes on top of what was left of the gratin. That was better than the dessert.

Wonderful flavor and relatively easy to make. My company loved it. Served it with pork tenderloin, which was a good combination. Will make it again and again!

Outstanding dish! I served this dish with grilled Tri-Tip for a hungry crowd and they just about licked the pan clean. I also made this in one dish with the full portions. It turned out perfect. The heighth was just what I expected and it did not take any longer to cook. The mushrooms added such a delicious flavor and really complimented the beef. Everyone was quite impressed. I made a smaller side dish for two children that hate mushrooms but I did add the mushroom liquid and they loved it.

A wonderful, flavorful and attractive dish to serve. Great accompiment and can be made in advance; wonderful with lamb and pork dishes.

I made this for a Passover Seder and it went over quite well. I didn't want to use two pans, so I cut the potatoes down to 3 pounds and used one pound of Portabello. Truthfully, I think I could have made the whole recipe in one pan. It didn't have the height I was looking for, so looked a little wimpy in the pan, but tasted delicious.

Loved this! Husband complained about too many mushrooms (but he doesn't like them anyway). I thought it was fabulous, but next time I may try it with 1/2 - 3/4 the mushrooms. My guess is the flavor will still be great.

I served this dish with an outstanding beef tenderloin and got raves! I recommend it for great flavor and beautiful presentation.

Served this with the Beef Roasted in Salt Crust for 9 hungry friends after a day of skiing/snowboarding in Tahoe. Came out pretty well. I used a $10 Japanese mandoline to slice the potatoes -- it worked really well!

This dish was delicious...especially for mushroom lovers like me. I followed the recipe to the 'T' but it didnt look like the picture. The potatoes turned a dark and grey. Did I do something wrong or is that supposed to happen? Any suggestions?

This dish was fantastic. I made it for Christmas dinner and there were hardly any leftovers. I am thinking about adding grated asiago cheese to the mushroom layer the next time I make it.

The combination of portobello mushrooms and potato is wonderful. This recipe makes a lot. When it says 10 servings, it's accurate.

I actually only tasted the results of this recipe. A friend made them for Christmas and brought me a sample along with some of the strip loin w/ garlic herb crust! (She said it was an easy recipe to make though the porcini mushrooms were a challenge to find). They were AWESOME! I enjoyed them so much that I searched EVERYWHERE for the December issue of Bon Appetit. Much to my dismay, the issue had already been pulled. (That schedule should be changed!!!!) Alas, I was saved by the internet!! We will be having these potatoes for New Year's day!! This is a KEEPER!

Everyone loved this dish. The portobello and porcini mushrooms add great flavor to the dish. I sliced the portobello to 1/4 inch bite size instead...it was easier to serve and enjoy. It is time consuming, it helps alot if you have a food processor or mandolin. But the raves are worth the effort.

This is a great recipe. Very good flavor. I did use less potatoes and put all the ingredients in one 13 X 9 baking dish. I made it for some French friends who are used to Gormet cooking and they loved it! I will make this again.
