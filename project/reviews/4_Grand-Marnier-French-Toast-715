Very simple, very good. I get the best results when I make it the night before and let it soak. The zing added by the orange plays very well with a mixed berry sauce that I also found on Epicurious(Challah French Toast with Berry Sauce).

And Canadian bacon does make a perfect addition!

Best French toast I had in years! My husband loved it too. I made it twice in the last two weeks. I used brioche from local bakery and it turned out amazing. My slices of bread were large, so 4 toasts used up all egg mixture. You may want to double the mixture if you using larger slices of bread. Enjoy!

If making this more decadent is even possible try having fun with the bread. i.e: Cinnamon Swirl from Great Harvest. Yep, amazing!

I have made this a few times now. This is a great recipe as is, but I have made some changes over time, which I tend to prefer. We use 6 eggs, 1/2 c cream, 1/2 c. buttermilk, for the 1/4 c orange I use a combo of OJ and Cointreau, and increased the vanilla to a full tsp. I also use a loaf of Brioche bread. I mix everything together, but the eggs, making sure the sugar is dissolved, then add the eggs, and allow the bread to absorb it all (about 35 min). Then I cook it over med-low heat, partially covered. It puffs up beautifully while cooking and tastes great.

I make this every year ( they Make me :) ) for my husbands firm breakfast. I make the recipe X8 so I reduce the sugar by half. Wonderful.

the flavor was perfect--we added salt and orange zest, omitted sugar, and used both plain challah and raisin challah. we only soaked the bread for a minute or two, but still ran out of batter even after doubling according to the amount of bread, and adding two more eggs. really extraordinary french toast!

This was delicious! I used Grand Marnier, Italian bread and I substituted 1/2 cup of half half with low-fat milk. I probably could have cut the butter in half...this recipe is a keeper!

We made this on Christmas morning and it was so good! Substituting 1% milk instead of half and half worked well with the buttermilk bread we had on hand. The Grand Marnier flavor made this meal special for the occasion, topped with confectioners sugar and real maple syrup.

I made this for the second time this weekend for my mom's birthday breakfast. It's so easy that you can make it the night before and then cook it up quickly in the morning. It received rave reviews from all. I opted for the orange concentrate version. Instead of using baguette though, i went with larger sweet batard this time, as i found the pieces quite small last time.

Made this with challah bread. Went easy on the Grand marnier, half-n-half and orange zest. Found I needed about 6-8 eggs to completely cook all the slices from the challah loaf. Everyone said it was the best french toast they had ever had!

I loved this recipe. for an extra lift after spinking with confectioner's sugar and drizzeling with real maple syrup sprinkle jack dannel's pecans chopped or un chopped sooo good. for people who don't know what jack dannel's pecans are they are a wonderful form of candied pecans involving brown sugar and jack danniels. also if you are on a time crunch and can't use the french bread. simply buy oatmeal bread from pepperridge farms dipping it quickly in mixture on both sides and put in skillet, challah or african honey bread works good as well on a time crunch with this method

I consider myself a french toast connoisseur and this is the best I've ever tasted. Granted you have to like orange flavor. If it is overpowering as directed in your first try, omit the orange zest. I've only done the recipe with grand marnier, but can't imagine it would be nearly as good with orange juice. I also use King's Hawaiian bread which has a naturally sweet taste. You can leave it out overnight to firm it up as it is quite soft otherwise. I top with fresh berries, a mint sprig, and powder sugar for a blow-you-away breakfast dish.

I made this with fresh-squeezed orange juice and did not serve any maple syrup. None was needed. They were delicious served hot off the pan (I didn't keep any warm in the oven). They weren't as tasty when I ate a cold one later, so if one didn't have people eagerly eating them hot, I imagine the oven suggestion and/or some sort of topping would be a good idea.

Recipes like this make epicurious head and shoulders above other food sites. I made this for our family for Thanksgiving morning. They are requesting it for Christmas. It's great for company because it's easy. I used the small French baguettes from Costco. They were "day or two old" and perfect. I soaked the slices in the egg mixture for 1.5 hours. I used the Grand Marnier which takes it to a new level. I promise you will get those thoughts from your guests: "Wow. She's a great cook". But anyone can do this! Try it! Serving suggestions: Thick bacon, fresh fruit, good orange juice and REAL maple syrup.

Rating: 4
This turned out fabulously! I used two whole eggs and 2 egg whites. For the grand marnier I used part cointreau and part OJ. I only let it soak for an hour and my 1" slices of french baguette had absorbed all of the batter. The slices puffed up in the oven as I cooked the bacon. This will be the only french toast recipe I use.

I made this for Mother's Day, and my parents said it was the best French toast they've had! It worked out really well. I used triple sec instead of grand marnier. I made a blueberry syrup to go with it, by boiling 1.5 cups fresh blueberries with .5 cup real maple syrup. The blueberries went great with the orange flavor of the toast.

This is the ultimate French Toast! I used orange juice once and triple sec (orange liqueur) once, and both times turned out great! Also, used challah bread, and would recommend 2x orange peel if you like the orange flavor. Made the night before, let soak in refrig. overnight, then it was ready to fry the next morning! An instant family favorite, now requested for special occasions, birthdays, sleepovers, holidays.

I have made this recipe three times. Each time, I revel in how delicious and luxurious the simple concept of French Toast can be. I've always used orange concentrate. Along with the orange rind flakes, it offers the perfect balance of orange flavor and scent - without being too fruit forward and overpowering toward other items on your breakfast plate.

One more mod I forgot to mention: I used rose water instead of vanilla extract, but with the chocolate marcarons, the rose water fragrance didn't come through at all. Next time, I'd just omit the rose water.

I made a number of modifications to this recipe when I was making it, because I didn't have some of the ingredients. I used two-day-old French bread (baguette) that was too hard to eat. I sliced it lengthwise, so that one side was the crust and the other was just the bread. I made the egg mixture and let the bread soak for a day and a half (ended up having French toast for dinner). I flipped the bread over to soak both the crust and the pillowy side. For the egg mixture, since I didn't have Grand Marnier, I used what sweet alcohol I had (Korean soju, ie whiskey), then omitted the orange zest. Also, instead of half and half, I had to make my own substitute of oat milk and butter (since I didn't have regular milk either; I love foodsubs.com for this!). Instead of either granulated or powdered sugar, I pulverized some chocolate macarons (very faint chocolate flavor due to the tiny chocolate chips inside; "tiny" as in "a little bigger than the period at the end of this sentence"). Finally, instead of maple syrup, I used organic raw blue agave syrup/nectar. It has a nice flavor and dark color. The taste is similar and costs about half as much. I served the toast with some sliced peaches that I made in a simple "bananas foster style"--with butter and again, soju. No extra sugar or spices. Overall, very good recipe, especially with old, crusty bread. The only thing is, you have to eat it hot; otherwise, when the French toast cools, the crust becomes chewy.

I made a healthier version and it was still terrific! I used 2 eggs and 1 cup of egg white (from a store bought carton) and fat free half and half. I didn't have grand marnier but used organge extract as well as vanilla. I added a lil cinnamon. I used thin Iron kids white bread but it puffed up as it cooked and was fine. Real maple syrup is a must!

In the world of French Toast this is a winner. I used challah bread and did a twenty minute soak in the egg mixture. I flipped it over at the 10 minute mark. Watch the pan, you probably want to use low heat just to be safe. The egg and sugar will brown up quicker than you might think.

When a recipe from this website comes with four stars, I generally end up in agreement. But this recipe just didn't cut it for me. It was OK, but somehow the fresh, simple taste of French toast was masked by the Grand Marnier. Your mouth wanted to taste the french toast you know and love but the Grand Marnier kept shouting "Look at me! Look at me!" If I try it again, it will be with orange juice as some others have done.

We make this every year now on Christmas morning and the whole family loves it. If you must use syrup, use real maple syrup and flavor with more orange if you like. But it needs nothing more than mimosas.

I am not sure where I went wrong. I used this recipe and several others from this site for a brunch yesterday, and I was very disappointed with this one. It just seemed a bit ordinary and no one commented on it while the others I got recipe requests. I had a burnt piece (as did my husband) because when we put it in the oven to keep warm on a dark baking pan it got overly browned on the bottom, so I feel I can't give a fork description, but for me the flavor wasn't that impressive. I also served this with a cranberry compote on the side for topping.

Rating: 4
After 43 four-fork reviews I doubt mine is required, but I have to say this is an excellent dish. I splurged on Grand Marnier and believe it was worth the expense. I made this for guests on my boat, where advance prep and convenience is always the priority. I brought the egg mixture in a jar, along with a loaf of good raisin bread. The night before, I tossed the bread into a big zip-lock bag, poured the egg mixture in, shook it to coat the bread, put it in the fridge, and went to bed. The next morning, I melted butter in a jelly roll pan and broiled it, turning once when the top was brown. I couldn't find un-sliced raisin bread for thick slices so stacked two slices per serving. Easy and perfect with no heavy-duty prep. It was one of those meals where everyone kept eating even though they were stuffed. Always a compliment...

I found this very easy to make and very tasty. We were making it for a crowd, so I baked in pans and on a sheet. Just under the broiler until it was done, flipped and then under again. Much faster than frying it. We used brioche and "Butter-Zopf" for the bread. Nearly the same thing, I didn't notice any difference in results, other than the brioche was a bit easier to slice before hand. Only other change was Cointreau instead of Grand Marnier, as that's what we have. Can't compare it of course, but the cointreau was nice. Definitely give enough batter to soak up and enough time - I found 30 minutes to be the minimum.

I have made this recipe a least a dozen times now and everyone who has tried it just loves it. I have always followed the instructions perfectly, but last time I had to make an adjustment and the result was excellent. I made this for my wife and some friends at a vaction house where there was no store really close by. I used some pretty stale (but high quality) bread and let it soak. The power then went out so I ended up letting the bread soak overnight. I made the toast the next morning and it was the best I had ever had. My recommendations are to use stale bread (I guess lots of people do that for frenh toast...) and let it soak for a long time, not just the 20 minutes on the recipe.

First found this recipe about 18 years ago. Have been cooking it ever since. Wows 'em every time. I NEVER cook it in a skillet. Melt some butter in a 9x13 ovenproof dish under the broiler, place soaked bread in pan, then cook under broiler until browned (turning pan as necessary). Flip bread slices to brown other side. I often let sit in warm oven up to 20 minutes before serving. Warm and custardy inside.

I served this as the dessert portion of a brunch for friends.

Very good. Can be made with regular (not-bakery) bread by not soaking it more than a few minutes, but the flavor isn't as great. Make sure to cook it thoroughly.
