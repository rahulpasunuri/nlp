This was a great quick meal for a week night. I used whole grain penne for the pasta,sugar peas instead of snow peas, asian chili sauce instead of the cayenne pepper for the heat, and added a half pound of already cooked shrimp. A healthy meal in a bowl...very tasty.

Quick, simple, and delicious! A perfect salty/sweet combination. I used a red, green and yellow bell pepper which made this exceptionally colorful and appetizing. One to add to the rotation!

I followed some of the recommendations in the reviews. I used Udon noodles and doubled the dressing. Also used 1 yellow pepper and 2 red peppers for color. This was a crowd pleasur for our employee picnic. It certainly makes more than 6 servings as a side dish. Very Good!

This dish is an old favourite that my family and I come back to time and again! You might want to double or triple the dressing, as the noodles just soak it up. I prefer this on the spicier side, so I add extra cayenne, plus chili paste and red pepper flakes.

I wanted a hot version of this meal, so I quickly stir-fried some onions, sliced carrots and frozen peas, leaving them in the pan, covered, while I cooked the pasta and made the sauce. I then added the sauce and some roasted chopped peanuts to the vegetables, and let it all sit for a few minutes. Then I added the hot pasta. Oh, and since it's winter and we don't have Thai basil, I threw in a couple of handfuls of cilantro - excellent! I will make this again - it was quick and really delicious. That sauce is wonderful.

This is super easy and versatile to make. I tend to use rotini instead of linguine (easier to eat at a picnic), and I tend to double the sauce. However, I use Paul Newman's Light Balsamic Vinaigrette instead of regular balsamic, and it makes it taste wonderful. I use with any veggie on-hand (broccoli, pea pods, chopped asparagus, baby corn, diced water chestnuts, green peppers), and I use cashews instead of peanuts. It's my go-to dish all summer.

I modify this recipe consistently and I love it. To make it healthy, I use whole wheat linguine. I also cut back on about a Table spoon of the sesame oil. I also don't use the peanuts or the basil, but instead toss it with shrimp. Its an elegant, easy and a nice side. I think its best when you let it marinate over a few hours before enjoying.

This is a fantastic recipe. I found this way back in 2001 and have made it at least 4 times a year. Whenever there is a potluck in the summer time this is the recipe I always fall back on. It never fails that I get asked for the recipe each and every time. Terrific, I would recommend that you give it a try. It makes quite a large salad so be prepared to use a large bowl. Making extra sauce is a good idea as it sits in the fridge it can soak it up a bit.

This recipe is great! I made it for the first time for a large BBQ this summer and everyone loved it. Several friends have since requested the recipe. I used spaghetti and doubled the recipe. Like some other reviewers, I added additional spice with chilli garlic sauce 1-2 tsps to individual taste. I also made it at a later date with sugar snap peas instead of snow peas and liked them better. This will definately remain one of my summer regulars for some time.

Rating: 3
Very easy, very pretty, and very tasty! I used thin spqghetti, one each red, orange, and yellow peppers, and added poached chicken and black sesame seeds. Next time I will make at least half more dressing, double the cayenne, and add scallions as other reviewers have suggested. It's great warm but twice as good cold the next day.

I made this for a casual at home dinner and served it with Grilled Pork with Ginger Molasses BBQ Sauce from this website. Both were very good and complimented each other nicely. I did not have the snow peas which would have been a nice addition, and I used scallions sliced on the bias in place of the red onion for additional color. Everyone liked it a lot and I know I will make it again.

I loved this recipe. You can easily double or triple the recipe for a crowd, and it looks fabulous on a buffet table. I cooked the red onion and veggies longer than the recipe called for. Everyone raved about this pasta, which will go into my "keeper" file.

Delicious; my favorite pasta salad. It is definitely not spicy, but the flavor is great and the ingredients are common. I halve the recipe when I make it for my family (of four), but the full recipe would definitely work great for a party- and the flavors are much more lively than the average pasta salad.

Rating: 4
A super salad. My husband raved, and he's a super good cook AND asian, so he knows. Definitely needed more kick - so I too doubled the dressing. Definitely use asian noodes, rice or soba or something. I don't know about the reviews that said it was difficult or time-consuming. I thought it was very easy - and I have 2 preschoolers. Go figure.

Pretty good, has potential. I made this recipe verbatim the first time. Next time I will: add more cayenne, or chili paste or fresh ginger for more zip,add some zuchinni in place of the 3rd rd pepper, add more fresh basil. This recipe makes a ton! Makes a good dish for potlucks :)

This recipe was great, and I had no problems using soba noodles.

Great flavor! After reading many reviews, I made it with double the honey, added some chili paste and ground ginger, used soba noodles and made it the night before. Everything was right on expect I shouldn't have made it the night before because the soba noodles are a more tender noodle and didn't hold up as well overnight with the dressing.

This is an excellent pasta salad. Just don't let the recipe deceive you- it makes far more than six servings!

I love to cook and made this once for a party, and now whenever someone has a gathering they request it. It's very crowd friendly and is delicious at room temp. I always make it the night before, as to allow the flavors to meld together. I also add a dab more of cayenne and honey. I am Greek and Italian and this is the only dish I ever make that is Asian. And only, because friends and family always insist.

I made the dressing just as written and thought it was wonderful - next time would add some chili paste perhaps to give it a bit more punch. Added blanched asparagus as well, that seemed to be a hit with everyone.

Rating: 3
Good but a little bland, double the honey and cut sesame oil by a third. You get a lot of the dressing. Be sure the cut veggies into bit size pieces as even thin slices are too big. Finally a pound of pasta is a lot and this really makes enough for 8 good size servings as a side dish.

Rating: 4
This was wonderful and very forgiving! I even screwed it up a bit by not sauteing the veggies before I added them to the pasta mix, so I just sauteed the whole thing and it was great. A huge hit, room temperature or cold, with kids and adults. Will definitely make this again.

I would make this again and have! Everytime I make this salad I get requests for the recipe! It is great for BBQ's and Potlucks! In fact, I originally found this recipe paired with other BBQ type offerings for the summer. Enjoy.

Great summertime recipe. I made it exactly as written except that I sliced the pea pods, added chicken that I stir fried with red pepper flakes and used spaghetti instead of linguine. Result was a light, flavorful weeknight dinner. If you want it spicier add more cayenne or add some red pepper flakes. We did not feel the sesame oil was overpowering.

Rating: 4
I've made this salad so many times for guests and it has never failed to garner requests for copies of the recipe. I can't understand how anyone would find it necessary to toss it in the disposal. For me, the amount of dressing is adequate. If I may offer some suggestions: I would not bother cooking the veggies - just slice them very thin - they remain crisp and retain their color; make it a day ahead but add the peanuts and basil just before serving; if you have a food processor, slicing the peppers and onion is a snap; try using a type of oriental noodle such as u-dong. I like them better and they cook in just a few minutes.

Rating: 3
This dish was time consuming but very good. I marinated a top sirloin steak in teryaki for 1/2 hr & grilled it & sliced it on top of the pasta. It was really good but next time I would double the sauce...it wasnt enough of the flavor. I would definately make it again, but not on a Fri after work...it took too much time.

Rating: 1
After reading the recipe and all the reviews I couldn't wait to add my kudos. I followed the recipe to the letter except doubling the dressing as suggested which made sense. WOW, what a disappointment! I found it bland and doctored it up before my guests arrived. One out of five liked it, the garbage disposal liked the rest. Since when is thinly slicing 3 large bell peppers, large red onionn and "stringing" 3 cups of snow peas simple and easy? I was reminded of something I've know, NEVER serve guests a new recipe without trying it first. After many recipes this is only my second disappointment with Epicurious.

Simple to make and delicious on a hot summer night.

Rating: 3
In addition to being delicious, this recipe gets extra points for extreme versitility. As others have noted, it lends itself well to a lot of substitution of vegetables and creativity. I threw in some julienned carrots, garlic and ginger and omitted the snow peas. I also added some raw scallions and used parsley instead of basil, because I didn't have any around. (Animals ate my herb garden in the night!) I also like this recipe because it can be made ahead, (except for the nuts, which would get soggy) and it works hot, cold or at room temperature. I didn't have to worry about soggy nuts in the leftovers, though, because there were none.

Rating: 4
It's hard to believe all the rave reviews for this pasta salad...but believe them! I just made this for a Superbowl party of fellow twentysomethings, and we all loved it. The key ingredient is pure sesame oil, and I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added powdered ginger and cilantro. Soak the pasta with dressing and let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. I substituted green beans for snow peas--steamed, with dried basil in the boiling water to impart flavor. Served with chicken, and bean sprouts as garnish. Lots of room for creativity, and very fool-proof recipe (considering I am a fool who usually only knows how to make omelettes.)

Used flat rice noodles instead of linguine. Omitted soya sauce (girlfriend allergic!) and instead used some water and extra salt/sugar. Added a wee bit of chopped ginger. Used somewhat less sesame oil than called for. Made 50-70% more sauce overall than the recipe called for, and this was just about right for the salad, with nothing left over. Overall this is a good recipe. My girlfriend loved it. The honey and balsamic vinegar give it a special, sweet taste. The only thing I would change is to cook the onion a little more before adding it to the salad - it was a little on the raw side for my taste. And of course - make up to twice the amount of sauce they want, but a bit less sesame oil.

Rating: 4
Simple & delicious!! I prepared this dish for our company's Thxsgiving Festival & it was well recieved. No leftovers or anything, I believe the bowl was almost licked clean. I added a bit of chicken as a optional addition. I cooked the chicken in a bit of the dressing, since it does have oil in the recipe, over medium heat until the meat started to caramelize. The smell was wonderful throughout the kitchen. I added half of the dressing to the pasta (I used rotini, instead of linguine) & vegetables, mixed through, covered & placed the bowl into the frig. The next morning, I added the chopped basil, chopped cashews (subsituted for the honey-roasted peanuts), the chicken & the rest of the dressing. It came out wonderful!! I've also used just the dressing on chicken alone, again cooked through & waited till caramelization & placed on top of Jasmine rice. Excellent dish!! This one's definitely a keeper. I think the honey & the balsmic vinegar really adds a sweet factor to the sesame oil which can be over-powering. Delicious!!

Excellent light summer meal. I added grilled shrimp that were marinated in half the dressing (half a double batch). Used a lot more cayenne and added Sriracha hot chili sauce to the dressing. Linguine didn't sound right, as others have noted, so I used rotini. This will definitely be one of my favorite pasta salads.

To "A Cook from Maryland horse country", Oscar Wilde described the Hunt as "The upspeakable in pursuit of the inedible". Also, as a sop to the more plebian of us who may be unaware of the finer points, you explain "Riding to hounds on horseback" - surely that's redundant! I hope you just drag hunt (feeble population-control arguments not withstanding...)

I made this for 40 women at a baby shower and everyone was a bit timid to try it until word of mouth spread about how good it was. I added shrimp and extra peanuts on top. Also surrounded the serving dish with lime wedges for those who wished to add to it. The left-overs were also good warmed up. Very easy to make!

I made this for a family picnic over the summer and it went over great. Everyone loved it. I used soba noodles instead of the linguine, and I doubled the recipe as well, not sure if I would have enough with just a single, and everyone ended up taking some home with them. They loved it so much, most of them asked for the recipe. The dressing for it was excellent.

Rating: 3
A great recipe for a tailgate picnic, since it's just as good served at room temperature or chilled. I made this for a hunt "breakfast" ( a meal actually served around 3-5pm, after a day of riding to hounds on horseback), Finding new and exciting dishes to bring to the breakfast is always a challenge- there usually are no amenities to reheat food wherever we meet. I used red, yellow and orange peppers, the snow peas and red onion, and added shrimp stir fried in a bit of the sauce, cilantro and water chestnuts. Served up in a large, plain white bowl, this dish colorfully stood out on the hunt board! Next time, as another reviewer did, I will try a shorter pasta ( like the farfalle), to make it easier to eat.

I would give this recipe 5 forks if I could. The dressing definitely should be doubled for one pound of noodles. In doubling the recipe, I used 2Tbs. toasted sesame oil and 5 Tbs. olive oil. I also used 3Tbs. balsamic and 3 Tbs. rice wine vinegar. I added 1 Tbs. finely chopped ginger. Soy sauce was doubled as was honey and cayenne. I shook the ingredients all together in a jar and left it in the frig for several days. I used 1#Japanese soma (somen)noodles. I left the vegetables raw. I used one red bell pepper, one yellow pepper, one bag of frozen sugar snaps(steamed) green onion,and matchstick carrots. I used cilantro and no basil. I add 1# frozen small salad shrimp, cooked. I mixed all together, tasted for salt, cilantro, rice vinegar additions and left in frig overnight. Next day, I brought it to room temp, placed on large oriental platter and sprinkled with cashews. It was sooooo good, colorful and everyone raved.

The first time I made this, I thought it was okay, but not worth 4 forks. Last night, however, I tried it again, and it was fabulous. I think the key subsitution for me was swapping out the linguine and using japanese soba noodles instead. I also used crimini mushrooms, scallions and red bell pepper of the suggested veggies because that's what I had in the fridge. I loved it this time around!

Just had a dinner party with many sucessful dishes from epicurious. This one was my favorite and many of my guests asked for the receipe. It was easy to make and tasted even better the next day. I did double the dressing, and added ginger, as some reviews recomended. I would not use quite double the oil next time, but would recomend the dark sesame oil. We like it spicey, so I also used more cayanne than called for. Great receipe, very easy!

This is delicious and very versatile. I made it for a dinner party of 8; 2 were vegetarians.

Next time, I'll add chopped ginger for additional flavor.

My husband I really enjoyed this one. I used Thai Kitchen's Stir Fry Rice Noodles instead of linguini. I think they natuarlly pick up the flavors of the sauce more readily. I also used regular roasted peanuts, as my grocer didn't have the honey roasted. We loved it and will make it again.

I made this on Sunday and have been enjoying it for lunch all week. Very tasty and simple to make. I've eaten it cold and warm, by itself and with the addition of cold cooked shrimp and it was great every time. I made 1 1/2 times the dressing and poured the whole amount on - would make 2 x the dressing next time to have some on the side. If you like your food spicy you'll probably want to beef up the pepper a bit. It's got a little bit of a bite but not much.

Excellent sidedish, picnic dish, buffet dish, or light supper dish. The sesame oil amount is fine, don't bother halving it. DO omit the cayenne and use 2 tablespoons of Chinese chilli paste in order to make it at least slightly spicy. I like this with green peppers instead of red (I double the amount), green onions sliced on the diagonal instead of red, cashews (double the amount) instead of peanuts, and chopped tomatoes instead of the pea pods. Use a bunch and a half of chopped fresh cilantro, and omit the basil, and use dried Japanese soba instead of linguine for the best texture.This makes a _huge_ amount, but is really good.

This landed up being a great COLD pasta salad. I was looking for something different and found it! I read all the reviews and on the advice of others reduced the amount of sesame oil. I used only 2 tablespoons. One in the dressing and the other to saute the veggies. I did cook the veggies longer than the stated time in order to get them to soften a bit. Also, use honey roasted cashews instead of the peanuts. I will say that after it sat a bit and chilled the flavors changed dramatically from when I first tossed it and it was delicious.

Even though I was forced to make several substitutions, I loved the recipe. I ended up adding two tablespoons more of honey, vinegar and soy sauce; heating the honey for 30 seconds to make it blend more easily. What a flavor! Perhaps this was necessary due to what previous critics have said: a bit too much sesame oil. I used regular vinegar and had no fresh basil. I also used scalions instead of onion and plain roasted peanuts instead of honey roasted.

I work as a caterer and I've used this receipe as a cold pasta salad a number of times, to good reviews from my customers. I did make a few changes: 1 tbsp. sesame oil & 3 tbsp. olive oil to tame the overpowering sesame taste; I didn't cook the vegetables, but rather added them to cold, cooked pasta; on occasion I omited the peanuts and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds and red peppers, diced small.

I believe there to be too much sesame oil in the recipe. I was a bit skeptical to begin with and I should have trusted my instincts. Sesame oil is so overpowering if too much is used, and believe me, too much is called for here. All my guests and I seemed to taste was the sesame oil. Perhaps blend the sesame oil with olive or peanut oil to tame the flavor a bit. Also, I took one of your other reviewer's advice and substituted a frozen stir-fry vegetable blend. This added more color and flavor to the dish. It was an easy recipe to prepare, and I will make it again, with some other substitutions.

This recipe was great, and I recommended it to my mother who made it too. It makes a lot and I found that the peanuts were kind of mushy the second day, so if you plan on eating it for more than one day, you may want to omit the peanuts, or sprinkle them on as you eat it.

This is a perfect mid week dinner idea when time is short. I have made the recipe twice already, and always vary the vegetables mentioned in the recipe. I usually just julienne whatever is in the fridge, saute quickly, then add to the hot pasta and sauce. While the name says spicy, the recipe is not - however, is could easily be adapted to suit your tastebuds. I put chicken in once, and it was excellent. This recipe is a keeper!
