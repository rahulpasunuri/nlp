Will make this again soon. For some added complexity -- used dijon instead of hot and stirred in some red pepper jelly.

Based on ingredient availability, I used a peach chutney in place of the apricot preserves and Dijon instead of hot mustard. The result was very tasty. We don't love skin, so removed that before grilling the chicken, which worked fine (kept heat at medium and made sure not to overcook and dry it out).

Very good. Mild. Almost any side dish would go well with this.

Absolutely awesome the first time and better when I tried something a little different. I used a gas grill and placed some hickory wood chips over the burners and cooked at very low heat, basting the sauce on half way through. The hickory was the perfect compliment to the apricot. Give it a try.

Really tasty. I followed the recipe exactly. Smelled wonderful, too.

This is extremely easy and pretty tasty. i don't have a grill so I used the oven broiler, put the thighs skin side down for 20 minutes, then flipped them for the last 10 minutes and they were perfectly done with a hint of crispiness on the skin. The flavor is tasty but not too sweet or strong- a nice easy weekday dish! Also, I didn't have hot mustard so I used mustard and then added a half tablespoon of hot chili garlic sauce (chinese).

I'm not a skin eater (and my husband shouldn't be) so I ripped the skin off before I grilled the thighs. I had to watch for burning on the grill, but overall it turned out great. It was relatively easy and a nice change from just grilling with BBQ sauce. Add it to your recipe box!

I used skinless, boneless breasts and just threw them right into the glaze pot. Very tasty!

Very good - and quick which is great. Used 1/2 hot mustard and 1/2 dijon since I was making for kids too. Preserves never completely melted but didn't really impact result. Good recipe to have on hand when you need to throw something together quickly. Served with corn on the cob and coleslaw. Yummy!

My family thought that this was great! I also made substitutions. I used orange marmelade instead of apricot and used Dijon mustard instead of the hot mustard. I would like to try the recipe as written, however.

I'm thinking of trying this recipe with skinless boneless breasts...has anyone out there tried it?

This was pretty good. Will make again. I didn't have apricot preserves (which I'm sure would be great) so I used what I had......cherry preserves. Seemed to work well. Nice way to spruce up boring chicken. Served with couscous dressed up with rehydrated apricots and pine nuts. Was a nice accompaniment.

Used skinless thighs. Mixed everything in together in a non-stick pan and broiled under medium-hot heat for about 30 minutes, basting frequently - especially at the end. The glaze was fantastically sticky.

Just plain foolproof. It tastes just wonderful. Mango user below is right on - a great variation. In fact, you can use peach preserves also.

This was an easy weeknight recipe! I used thighs with the drumsticks still attached. The sauce had great flavor!

Quick and very delicious...grilled chicken always sounds so boring, but this was a great variation. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and also set aside some of the sauce before I began basting (so I wouldn't contaminate the sauce with the basting brush) to pass around at the table.

Really nice flavor - sweet from the apricot and slight heat from the mustard (or in my case from 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes because I didn't have hot mustard.)

This was a great way to have chicken if you are tired of tradional barbeque sauce. I substituted Mango preserves and it was awesome. Also took other reviewers advice...used boneless thighs and let them marinate for a few hours before grilling.

Really likes the sauce for the chicken. Next time I will use boneless-skinless thighs. And maybe have the chicken marinate just a little bit before placing it on the grill.
