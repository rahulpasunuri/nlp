this dish makes no sense

I MIGHT TRY THIS RECIPE IN THE FUTURE FOR A SMALL GET TOGETHER AND PREPARE JUST BEFORE, BUT AS AN HORS D'OEUVRE FOR A LARGE PARTY IT WAS A DISASTER. THE ADVICE FROM OTHER REVIEWERS DID NOT WORK. I SOAKED THE APPLES IN LEMON WATER, BUT THEY STILL BROWNED, AND THE PUREE DID BLEED. THE RESULT WAS AN ARTISTIC REPRESENTATION OF A GUN SHOT WOUND, NOT A GOOD APPETIZER TO SERVE AT A BABY SHOWER. NO ONE ATE THEM. THE CRAB MEAT WAS GREAT.

These tasted great and looked even better. The recipe did make a lot, but I just used an extra apple and served more. To keep the apples looking good, I immersed them in lemon water after slicing, and they did not brown. Also, I thought the beet would bleed on the apple and it did not. I didn't have gloves, but I washed my hands immediately after touching the beets and they cleaned up fine. As far as finding apples large enough, this was not an issue for me. This was a two, maybe three, bite appetizer, so I didn't want huge apples.

I've already done this dish twice. Very yummy, but this recipe yielded an overwhelming amount for my guests to deal with. A couple tips--half the recipe and wear latex gloves when dealing with the beets. No fun hosting a party red handed, literally.

Great presentation, and delicious combination of tastes and textures.

Offering an impressive visual display with the red beet and green apple, these hors d'oeuvres were refreshing and unique. I found the preparation quite simple. The only problems I encountered were finding large enough apples to make a suitable bed for the beet and crabmeat and keeping them looking fresh as the beet dyed the apple.
