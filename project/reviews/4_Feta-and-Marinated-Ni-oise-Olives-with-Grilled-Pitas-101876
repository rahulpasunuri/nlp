I love this recipe. It is soooo good. Make it, you won't be sorry. Marinate the olives a few days. The flavor is incredible!

I really love this appetizer. Break off some of the rosemary and add it to your bite of pita, cheese and olive. Yum.

I made this for a party for some foodie friends of mine- I used pitted kalamatas and baby pitas. It was yummy and sooo gorgeous- and very simple.

Great flavors. Real Greek Feta is important. I used pitted calamata olives. I found it a bit awkward to eat, next time I will cube the feat and serve with toothpicks. Delicious left over, too, when the cheese soaked up the flavored oil.

This was a beautiful presentation, but I didn't like it enough to make it again.

This is a great appetizer to serve to guests, because it is beautiful. It's also very easy and very tasty. But it really does look great.

This is always a big hit and it looks way better than this photo. I put one block of feta and then tip the other one up on it at a 90 degree angle and then dump the jar with the marinaded olives on top and it looks like the cover of a magazine. I always use pitted kalamata and traditional feta instead of mild. I keep this in the fridge at the holidays and whenever I have house guests for an impromptu appetizer. I can't believe more people haven't tried this recipe. It's a keeper.

This is great. I used mini pita breads and pitted calimata olives. Not as pretty but easier to eat. Next time I think I'll use both black and green olives. Yummy!

This dish is a hit! I've made it for 3 different parties and each time my guests loved it. I cut the flatbread into wedges to make it easier to eat. I also found small bowls at Crate & Barrell with olives painted in the bottom for guests to dispose of the pits. It is so easy and the presentation is wonderful!

This was an excellent cocktail party appetizer! It was so easy to prepare and it looked great. I bought pitted kalamata olives. I would not serve this without pitting the olives first.

This was a tremendous hit at a dinner party I recently attended. I opted for pitting the olives, which may not look that pretty, but it makes the dish a lot easier to eat. Instead of using additional olive oil on the grilled pitas, I dipped a grill brush into the marinade and used that oil for the pitas. It gave them great flavor. I will definitely make this one again!

This recipe seemed like it would be great for a party and I certainly love olives, feta and grilled pita as I think most people do, however it is very messy to eat what with the oil-coated olives and having to tear off bits of pita and cut mouthsize pieces of feta. My guests hardly touched it I believe because they didn't quite know how to attack it. Anyway, it looked nice and it didn't go to waste.

I substituted Kalamata olives and marinated them 3 days. I served this dish to friends who loved it! The marinated olives change the flavor of the feta making it more interesting. Also, the grilled pitas add another interesting texture and taste. All in all, a fabulous dish, and incredibly easy to make.

I prepared the olives 3 days before our dinner party, and spooned them over the feta as guests were arriving. Instead of pita, we toasted Tuscan bread on the grill. Our guests really enjoyed the wonderful flavors.
