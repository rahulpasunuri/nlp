Made according to recipe and it was delicious! Real comfort food - hard to stop eating. Served as a side to BA's Porchetta Style roast Pork and the next day with jumbo prawns. Will definitely make again for family and company.

I have also made this basic recipe with orzo, which was terrific as well.

This recipe deserves every single fork! It was simple to make and absolutely delicious. I served it with pan-fried red snapper and a tangy cucumber/tomato salsa. Amazing!

Made this as a side dish to http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Pistachio-Crusted-Halibut-with-Spicy-Yogurt-237219 It was excellent. I did make it with brown rice which took longer to cook but the flavor was worth it.

Really easy and so good! Went perfectly with the grilled veal chops

I substituted brown long rice for white rice which takes 50-60min to cook but its healthier. Also added a little more saffron than called for. Absolutely delish. Would definitely make again!

Very good. I followed the recipe pretty much as is and mmm was the first sound from everyone that tried it, even myself, who really isnt a fan of rice in general. Definitely will add this to my list of staples.

Made this with yellow peppers and grana padano in place of parmesan as I had them on hand. Other than that, exactly as written. Even a professed non-rice-eater declared it buttery and delicious. It was a great compliment to the grilled veal chops with lemon and parsley. I will keep this in my arsenal for when I will serve any grilled meat.

Definitely a keeper! Didn't use chives, but used chopped cilantro instead. Loved every bite.

I really liked the flavors (reminds me of one of my favorite leftover turkey recipes here "turkey paella"). Paired it with the veal chops shown in the menu, but could go with many dishes. Will definitely make again.

I love any rice with saffron and parmesan so I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. My guests thought it was good but not exceptional. So to be more objective, I give it two and a half (which is noted as "good" in this rating system) to three forks ("delicious").

Mmmm!...was the sound I heard after my husbands first bite. An exceptionally easy and delicious rice dish that would go well with any entree.

I love, love, love this dish as do my husband and my son. I didn't have chives but it tastes great without them. We love Parmesan on anything, so that of course went over well. I have made this recipe many, many times, and it is definitely a keeper.

Delicious! I made the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Nice and fluffy and not a grain stuck to the pot! I was on a saffron binge, so I served with the Chicken Bouillabaise recipe on this site. Fabulous comfort food!

Rating: 3
Very tasty. But there's only about a 30-second window between too wet and too dry. It finished cooking before my main course did, and it took over 2 cups of extra stock to keep it moist!

This recipe was delicious. I ommitted the butter and used olive oil instead. I also didn't have saffron. Both my husband and I loved it. Served it with a NY strip

Rating: 3
Used mushroom broth and no cheese, turned out great. How can you go wrong with 5 tbs of butter anyway? Used brown basmati rice, package recommends 50 minutes of boiling, so had to keep it in much longer than 18 minutes - and it was still a little bit chewy.

Rating: 3
Very nice and eye-appealing. Made as is, but also added yellow peppers and mushrooms. Adding the 3 cups of broth gave me a risotto-type dish, which was great. I did also brought to a boil, then lowered the heat (took about 25 minutes to absorb). It's even tastier the next day! Will make again!

This dish was heavenly. We couldn't stop eating it. Made it "rissoto" style, so I used more chicken broth, about twice what the recipe called for. Paired it as suggested with the grilled lemon parsley veal chops. A perfect side dish for the chops.

I loved this dish! My only note for next time is it needs a ton of salt!!

So delicious with the grilled lemon parsley veal chops.

Very tasty and easy to make! Didn't have any chives handy so I substituted them for 1tbsp of each fresh dill, parsley and coriander. I served it with roasted salmon steak seasoned with salt and pepper and dotted with butter before putting in oven. 5' before taking it out, smear with mustard. Irresistible!

Great, simple recipe. It might help though if the mixture was brought to a slight boil before returning it to a simmer. Otherwise it might take much more than 18 minutes for the liquid to be absorbed.

This pilaf was so delicious. I followed the recipe precisely, with the exception of the saffron, I used annato seeds to color the butter without changing the flavor. Along with the pilaf I made stuffed chicken breast with romano cheese, basil, etc. with a red and yellow pepper sauce. The combination was splendid.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this recipe. I did make some changes to it but it's basically the same: brown rice instead of white, yellow, red and orange peppers instead of just red and a delicious vegetable stock instead of the chicken. I came out so well, I've been eating it for lunch all week!

Very Good. Used 1/2 red and 1/2yellow peppers. Took longer to cook

I liked the rice dish, however I was not in love with it. We made it as a side dish for Christmas dinner and four of us agreed it was OK, but not great. Not sure I would make it again.

I made this recipe to accompany Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Mojo Sauce from this site and it was fabulous! It would be delicious alone! I doubled the recipe to make sure there would be enough for 10, there wasn't one grain left at the end of the meal... a good testament that it was delicious! I will definitely make it again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party to serve with Grilled Sea Bass with Tropical Salsa (found on this web-site). The two made a beautiful presentation and got rave reviews. I used red, yellow and green bell peppers.

This was a great dish. We had it with salmon and it was the perfect compliment.

This was delicious, even though I substituted what I had on hand - green pepper for the red, half wild rice and half basmati, and summer savory instead of the parsley. It was a terrific accompaniment for the grilled lemon-parsley veal chops as suggested.

I served this for company and omitted the chives because I did not have any and forgot the cheese but it was still delicious! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. A keeper.

This is a wonderful, easy dish. I made it on a weeknight with salmon and my family loved it.

How can a recipe with this much butter NOT taste fantastic? I was looking for a risotto recipe but didn't have enough arborio rice so I "settled" for this one. I used basmati rice and it tasted great. It's perfect for company. We served 4 with tons leftover even after second helpings. If you're looking for a dish that is delicious and colorful then try this one.

Rice was absolutely delectable. I added chopped button mushrooms to the mix and it came out fantastic. Have also used green peppers when I don't have any red peppers around, and the dish is equally delicious. Will definitely make this a 'regular'.

Easy and fantastic. I served it with Tilapia with Lime & Chili butter.

Very good and easy dish. The rice came out so fluffy, moist and flavorful and was just as good the next day. The parmesan cheese really adds and nice balanced flavor. I added turkey sausage at the end to make this a one pot meal, which did not go very well. Will make again as a side dish for chicken or fish in the future.

I prepared this dish for dinner with my husband. We love rice and this particular recipe earned a place in our "Favorites" cookbook! When preparing this side for guests, I will serve it in a RED bowl -- the presenation should be stunning!

This rice was easy to prepare (pre-chopped pepper and onion) and caused all dinner guests to express their delight! I served it with grilled salmon, but feel it would compliment almost any fish or poultry main course.

Amazing! This goes so well with the veal chop, but it is so delightful that it could be paired with a hamburger and still shine. Superb, honestly.

Have already made this twice for dinner parties. Saffron adds an interesting flavor. It makes quite a bit, so plenty for leftovers. The saffron comes in little bullet containers, so rather than trying to measure out the amount, I used the whole small container. Goes fantastic with the veal that it is paired with in the magazine, but would also go with many other entrees.

I used a wild rice mix and omitted the cheese to make it healthier - this is a wonderful sophisticated side dish. Definitely worth making again!
