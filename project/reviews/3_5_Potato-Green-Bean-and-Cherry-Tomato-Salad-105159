Great recipe for a simple lunch or light supper salad. Very easy, and tastes great even if you don't have capers at home. Sometimes I ignore the dressing portion and just toss with olive oil and light vinegar (like champagne).

I thought this was awesome. So easy and different then the typical potato salad.

This was so easy to make and is really wonderful if you make the dressing separately and add a few things to it. I used Tarragon infused White Wine Vinegar, and added some fresh garlic. Topped it off with some Asiago cheese and served it in a tall clear glass bowl which made a great presentation. Made this for friends and everyone wanted the recipie. My first potato salad ever and what a hit!

Definately need fresh ingredients. I also think it was rather bland, missing the oomph. I added chopped red onions, and next time, I will add some dijon mustard.

I think the dressing is bland (as previous raters said) if you underseason. The line at the end to salt and pepper always leads to me underseasoning--I wish the recipe directed me to put in a specific amount of salt and pepper along with the other ingredients. That said, however, this salad is wonderful! It's a salad nicoise without the tuna. It came together quickly and looked great. I'll definitely make it again.

I made this dish to take to my womens group get together. By the end of the evening 5 had asked for the recipe. It was a great dish for a warm summer evening.

Wow, I was surprised to see the low reviews on this recipe as I love it! Have made it quite a few times, particularly spring and summer. I've used Haricort Vert, blood orange juice and grape seed tomatoes. It's always received great reviews from my guests. I'm getting ready to make it for a party next weekend. I do not use all of the dressing though, just dress lightly.

I agree with the previous reviewer who found the dressing bland. I won't try this again.

Made this dish for a brunch party. It was very easy to make and a nice change from the usual cold salads normally served. Plus the green and red colors made this dish look very festive for the holidays. The dressing has a nice lite fresh taste. I'm sure this dish would be perfect for a Bar-B-Que side dish. Just love these easy and tasty recipes!

I originally tried ths dish when green beans were plentiful in our garden. My husband loved it. He has since made it twice as a side dish for dinner parties. It is a great do-ahead dish, and since my husband doesn't usually help with the cooking, this is definitely a keeper!

I served this dish at a family barbacue and got raves. It's light and a nice change from the usual mayonaise style potato salad. I was a little sceptical of the OJ when I first read the recipe, but it was not too overpowering and blended very nicely. As I write more potatoes are boiling for another batch.

I made this salad exactly according to the recipe. In contrast to the earlier reviewers, my husband and I really did not care for the dish. The dressing is oily and bland. To spice up the copious leftovers, I added a crushed clove of garlic and some diced onion which only helped the appeal of this dish slightly.

This is a tasty salad for summer and the dressing is lite and tangy, perfect salad for a bbq and it even tastes great the next day too. Everyone liked it even my 3 year old!

This is a wonderful summer salad. I served it on top of swordfish with tomatoes...our dinner guests raved over it! A definite keeper.

I thought this was very good. The dressing could use a bit of jazzing up but the combinations of flavors was really nice. I sprinkled it with some crumbled goat cheese before serving.
