It's a production, but worth it - a perfect Thanksgiving first course for a small group (there were 5 of us). In the end, making the bisque took less than 3 hours, and that was 2.25 hours of prepping and making the stock, 30 minutes or so for pureeing, straining, etc. We ordered 2 cooked lobsters so just removed the meat and had the shells for the stock. The fennel is what really makes the difference, and the Pernod - it's a wonderful complement to the shellfish. Yum.

THIS IS THE ONE HOLIDAY RECIPIE THAT GETS EVERYONES ATTENTION, IT IS WELL WORTH THE TIME AND EFFORT. I SUBSTITUTE LOBSTER TAILS FOR THE LIVE LOBSTERS WHICH I PREFER NOT TO HANDLE USING ROUGHLY EQUAL WEIGHTS. I ALSO LEAVE MORE OF THE SHRIMP AND LOBSTER IN SMALL CHUNKS THAN IS SUGGESTED IN THE ORIGINAL.

Superb and well worth the 6 hours it took to make. To make less daunting, I substituted a pound of lobster tails and a pound of Alaskan King Crab legs for the live lobsters. Also, to save time and effort I strained it several times through a wire basket rather than forcing it through a seive. Good results. A hit with my wife and with my gourmet club.
