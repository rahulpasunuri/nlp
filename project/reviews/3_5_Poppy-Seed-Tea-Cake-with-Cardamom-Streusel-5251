I baked this recipe in a Bundt pan. I decided to spread the streusel along the bottom of the pan, and spooned the batter on top. This seemed to work out fairly well, until I sliced into it. Like other have said, the streusel cracks and falls off the cake. It is definitely not what I know of as a streusel. Streusels are supposed to be crumbly and buttery. This topping is hard and somewhat tasteless. The flavour of the cake itself is quite good; the orange matches well with the cardamom. The citrus flavour is very prominent.

I made this tea cake on Christmas morning as my family loves cardamom. I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8" springform pan. It was so easy and really wonderful - had no problem with the streusel. I used lowfat sour cream instead of full fat and it worked beautifully. Next time I might cut back on the sugar a bit and add a bit more cardamom to the cake batter as I love that flavor. A keeper!

3 & 1/2 FORKS! Excellent and pretty easy. I used plain yoghurt in place of the sour cream (since I had some). I removed the cake after 20 min & added topping & it was fine. Served with a touch of whipped cream to dress it up BUT this was NOT necessary since it was really moist on its own. Still lovely & moist 2 days later (maybe even better?). The orange & cardamom flavors made it a little above the ordinary. I don't make too many recipes twice but I'll definately make this one again!

A little heavy on the cardamom - I'd try replacing it with a bit more cinnamon, and upping the orange zest. I put the streusel on 15 minutes into baking, and it seemed to stick as well as could be hoped for a tea cake.

This was a great, moist breakfast cake. I made it in a springform pan and everyone I served it to asked for seconds

Beautiful combination of flavours (cardamon+orange), nice fluffy texture. Simple and esay to make. I was looking for a delicious poppy seed (not filling) cake for a long time, now I have found it and dfefinetely will bake it again.

I would have given 4 forks - but I had a little trouble with streusel. When I mixed the ingredients it was really wet - I added a little more dry ingredients to get moist clumps. Some of it sank - BUT it taste delicious.

Very tasty and tender cake. The flavor of the cardomom was refreshing. I followed some reviewers' advice and waited only 15 minutes before sprinkling the streusel over the cake. It came out great. Would definitely make again.

This is a great cake. I didn't have any problems with the streusel topping. I have made is many times and it gets rave reviews!

The cake is great, but there are two problems with the streusel. First, the recipe is off. There is so much butter that the streusel will melt, so reduce the amount of butter (to 2-3 tbsp) or increase the other ingredients. Second the streusel will not stick to the cake if you wait for the prescribed 25 min. Reduce the time so that the cake is still moist (~10 min).

This cake was delicious and didn't last long in my house. However, I did precook the cake before adding the streusel topping as the recipe said and the topping didn't stay on the cake. Every time I cut a piece the topping crumbled alongside the cake. Next time I may try adding the streusel earlier.

Delicious! This cake is very moist and flavorful. Although my streusel sunk to the bottom of the cake! It was still great, though. Next time I'll definitely cook the cake longer initially before putting the streusel on top. This recipe is also good with just cinnamon substituted for all the spice.
