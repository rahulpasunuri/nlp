Just made this for dinner and thought it was quite tasty. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice but made my own by following a recipe (for the spice) on allrecipes.com. http://allrecipes.com/recipe/pumpkin-pie-spice-ii/ I too served this over Israeli couscous.

I use tri-tip rather than tenderloin and it still comes out very tender.

These flavors are spectacular! A good cut of meat and fresh carrots with the spices make for a great comfort food dish. I followed another's recommendation to add cauliflower, but decided to at the last minute, and had to add frozen cauliflower. The flavors of everything else are so rich and delicious, that frozen made no difference. I will deifnitley make this again!!

I absolutely love this recipe! I use nutmeg for the pumpkin pie spice and combined with the mint, it gives this dish a wonderful unique flavor!

Our whole family loved this dish including my 3 and 5 years old boys! I served with Rice with Herb and what a simple yet tasty dish. Be sure to get a good steak beef, makes big difference. I would add additional carrots next time. Yumm....

My husband said, "This deserves five forks!" I think that basically says it all! I followed the recipe pretty closely (used the beef tenderloin -- expensive but worth it), and probably more carrots, shallots, and mint than it called for. Made my own pumpkin pie spice and served the stew with Israeli couscous. Very quick and delicious. Next time I make this I will add some cauliflower.

This was a fantastic (yet pricey) dish. I bet substituting ground lamb would well. I served it over Israeli Couscous, which was a nice base.

The cut of beef really makes a difference - we used stew beef, and it was pretty chewy. Also, I would recommend reducing the liquid by half a cup. Instead of pumpkin pie spice (because I didn't have it), I used 4 parts cinnamon, 1 part nutmeg, 1 part ginger, and 1 part cloves (I doubled the recipe so 1 part = 1/2 teaspoon).

very flavorful and easy to prepare. Sauce and seasonings were just right. In a rush and attempt to save money I grabbed one of those beef stew pre-packaged deals in the meat section of the grocery store. dumb idea. I should have gone to the butchers for a choice piece of meat, as the beef in my stew was damn near like rubber. Oh well. Still tasty! I served with cous cous and toasted pinenuts and sweet biscuits.

Very tasty, but only if you like that Moroccan kind of flavor. I doubled everything except the cumin, which I limited to 1 Tablespoon, instead of 1-1/3 Tablespoon. I also used 2 chopped onions instead of the shallots and sliced carrots instead of the whole baby carrots. I thought it needed some sweetness, so I added 2 handsful of golden raisins. At first the stew was very watery, but I boiled it down till the gravy was thick. This gave the carrots time to soften and improved the flavor considerably. I'm not sure I would make it again -- I have another Moroccan beef stew that I think is superior -- but this one is quite good. One more thought: The texture of beef tenderloin is nicer than chuck, although I doubt there's a big difference in flavor.

This is very tasty and easy. I had no stew beef, so substituted 4 griller-style, vegetarian burgers, cut up. I wasnt sure how this substitute would work, but it was perfect. I doubled the spices, added a handful of raisins, and served this over bulghar made with a beef and tomato broth. The whole thing was aromatic and delicious. In my opinion, this makes plenty for 4 servings. Joy! We can have this again tomorrow!

This was probably the best meal I've ever made. It's a bit pricey, since you need to use a good cut of meat, but since you get a healthy, gourmet meal for less money than going to a restaurant, it's worth it. I highly recommend this recipe!

This was really good. I used lower quality meat and let it cook a little longer. I had rice and used that instead of couscous. However, I had to add extra mint to teh stew to make it really pop. Good but not great. It was best the second day.

Like another reviewer, I opted to do this in the crockpot with beef chuck (i.e., grocery store "beef for stew"). I browned the meat in olive oil, threw in shallots and carrots and cooked for 3 minutes. Then I added spices and stock (left out cayenne for sake of my 3 kids) and brought to full pressure for 40 minutes. The result was fantastic with mint and a generous squeeze of lemon juice, served over couscous. Everyone loved it.

The flavors were good, but I don't think this is the best way to treat the meat, or the best cut of meat to use in the first place. I'd recommend slow cooking it instead.

All I can say is WOW!!! I am superbly impressed with this website. This meal was deliciously exotic. I added a little more cayenne and some peas,but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Absolutely delicious.

This was excellent, and even my fussy kids liked it! I will admit I used a cheaper cut of meat and a pressure cooker to save money without spending a lot more time. I just browned the meat first, then the shallots, added the spices, then poured in the broth and cooked it at full pressure for 10 min. Cooled it quickly, added the carrots and cooked at pressure for 5 min., then cooled it quickly, thickened the sauce and seasoned with salt, pepper and mint. Since stew meat is already cut up, it took no more time than the original version. Delicious!

This is a quick, tasty meal for a weeknight. I had problems getting the sauce to thicken and it had an unappetizing soupy quality. This could be easily fixed next time, and the flavour made up for it. Was filling over cous cous, and with non-fat spray instead of oil, very healthy.

I made this last night, exactly as written. It is delicious. The quantity was generous for two, with enough left over for lunch. This will definitely be a repeat at my house.

Quick and easy, and quite delicious. Great weeknight meal. User sirloin instead of tenderloin, and it was still good.

I didn't like this too much. I think it was the spices that I didn't like. The meat was good though. I used stew meat and slow cooked it for 7 hours. It came out very tender, but this recipe still didn't do it for me. My husband liked it though.

Great comfort food.

This will definitely become a staple. I went with an entire teaspoon of cayenne rather than just 1/8. That helped the stew go from "eh stew" to yummy!

Good, but not great. Would look for another recipe before making this again.

Yum! I didn't use the tenderloin as called for. I used beef stew meat and cooked it for longer. It was moist and delicious. I also added some onions in with the scallions and some peas towards the end. It was a great meal! Served over Bulgur and a bit of plain yogurt. Will make this one again.

This makes a great dish for vegetarians. Substitute Morningstar Farm's Meal Starters Steak Strips for the beef tenderloin. Defrost before using, skip the salt and pepper, and saute as directed. Both my husband and I missed having potatoes in the stew, so I roasted some to go alongside. A winner.

Great dish- while it does feel odd to use tenderloin in this way, it makes a delicious dish. Quick and easy to prepare for a weeknight meal! Used beef broth to cook the couscus and it was a great addition. I will definately make this again.

To the first person with the question, for a stew with olives, try Morrocan Beef Stew, Bon Appétit, April 2006 http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/234422

Delicious recipe -- quick and easy. But would you really want to use tenderloin this way? The advantage of tenderloin is that it makes it fast, but the meat becomes no better than if you had slow-cooked a cheaper cut.

Just a note for the request for beef stew with olives. There is a recipe for Portuguese Beef Stew with Almonds and Olives in the book "Saffron Garlic & Olives" by Loukie Werle. It uses kalamata olives and parsley.

does anyone know a recipe of beef stew with olives and maybe carrots?? Its northafrican and I've eaten it in a vol au vent aka bouche du reine. I ate it in France many times and I really want to make it.

Great flavors for a quick and easy meal. I will make this again, probably without any changes.
