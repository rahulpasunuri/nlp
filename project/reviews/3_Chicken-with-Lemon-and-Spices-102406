Just OK for me. I added garlic and substituted light coconut milk for the sour cream. It was an odd combination - the sauce looked italian with the chopped tomatoes, and with the rice had an almost risotto look. But then it was spicy and tangy like a curry. It just felt like a whole bunch of stuff thrown together by someone who didn't really have an idea of what the finished product would be. It tasted OK though and was definitely healthy (esp if you leave out the cour cream). Won't make it again though as I would prefer either to make a proper curry or something italian!

This was a great recipe. I cooked it for a group of friends. I doubled the ginger and left out the the sour cream. Terrific taste that go great together!

This was healthy, but bland. Too many other great recipe options to make it again.

I went with the Rotel, too. Thought this was a very flavorful, easy dish. A perfectly respectable weeknight meal. I added some garlic, had to use powdered cumin and ginger (plus a small dollop of jarred minced ginger), no harm done. Had it with a mixed grains/rice blend. Tangy, spicy, tasty!

Tasty, and visually attractive. As others have noted, this is a good weeknight dish, nothing fancy. I used Rotel tomatoes and chilis, a good choice here. The accompaniment was brown rice, on the dry and crunchy side, which made a good contrast. It seems a healthy dish; I was able to prepare everything with cooking spray, no added oil.

I like the tangy flavor of this recipe. Doubled most of the spices, added a bit more liquid and added julienned carrots with the tomatoes, mushrooms at the last simmer. Easy to prepare, something different for a weeknight meal. Colorful, fragrant dish.

I used about 1 1/2 pounds fresh tomatoes instead of canned, coarsely chopped, a good tablespoon of cumin and some really hot chili powder (in fact, hot Spanish paprika and some cayenne) - hold the sour cream. My boyfriend just loved it, so this is a keeper *g*

Followed the recipe pretty faitfully, but I didn't like the end result at all. It was way too acidic and it looked like a big mess as well...Definitely would not make it again.

I thought this recipe was yummy and easy -- my husband thought it was just so-so. He thought it needed garlic, but I liked it the way it was.

I give this dish four forks, because it's truly easy and tastes wonderful! Also looks really pretty. I love citrus/tomato sauces and adore the cumin and chicken, so this recipe was a no-brained for me. If you don't like tangy and the play between spicy and fruity, better look for another recipe. The flavors are bold, not at all subtle. This is a recipe for times you want something simple, fun to cook, earthy and aromatic. Great with sugar snap peas, rice and honeyed carrots.

I make this recipe often. I've never used turmeric until I made this recipe. It's a very unique mix of spices and ingredients and much different than anything I make. My husband and I both love it. I follow the recipe exactly each time and think it's perfect the way it is! I passed this along to my mother and she and my dad love it, too!

We thought this was great, and easy! I did go light on the cumin though. Great weeknight meal.

The chicken itself was perfect - flavorful and moist. But the sauce... well, it was way too strong, and once i finished eating the chicken I had to throw out the rest of my meal. I won't make this one again.

This recipe is really tough to rate because the flavors are more interesting than enjoyable. My husband liked this dish more than I did, so I would make it again for him if he requested it. The dish is not tangy in a "face pucker" sort of way but tangy in a "play with your tongue" way. It smells wonderful during preparation but doesn't live up to that aroma.

Yes, it's tangy, but it's also YUMMY! My husband and I both love this dish (the only thing I do differently is to use a bit more lemon juice -- we really do like the tang. We like it so much that I make it every couple of weeks. It's easy to make with ingredients I amost always have on hand. And it's super reheated the next day for lunch.

I agree with other review, too tangy from lemon and tomatoes!! Discard the marinade and add a sprinkle of sugar. Also try adding a bit of coconut milk for more interesting flavors.

This was really good, although a bit too tangy from the lemon juice and tomatos. I ended up adding a little bit of honey to balance it out.
