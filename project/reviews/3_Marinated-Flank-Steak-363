This was ok. I've tried three other broiled flank steak recipes in the past year, all of which I preferred to this, hence the 2-fork rating. For those who want to try this recipe, I would suggest finely mincing the shallots, increasing the amounts of olive oil, lemon juice, and red wine to 3 Tbsp. each, and decreasing the amount of thyme to only 1 tsp. Also, I had to broil a couple minutes longer than the suggested time to achieve medium- rare.

Good Marinade. I let it sit overnight, and it really tenderized the meat. Quick and easy to prepare and will make this one again.

Great! This marinade is also great in the crock pot to tenderize a tough steak.

Excellent! Not salty at all and was quick and easy to make. This is good enough to serve to company and this recipe is a "keeper"!
