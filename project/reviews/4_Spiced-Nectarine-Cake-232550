I have made this cake literally a hundred times since receiving the magazine issue in which it was first published. Yummmmy! I use peaches in the summer, and have also used other fruits including pears, plums, and a combination of nectarines and other fruits. I can't believe five ingredients can produce such a delicious cake. I am addicted-if I bake this delight when I am having a sweet tooth moment, usually late at night, other household members are lucky to even get a taste of this beauty, the following day...

i added a teaspoon rosewater which TOTALLY improved the cake. I used nectarines and it was done ten mins. early so watch out for that. serve it with cinnamin ice cream and you will not regret it!

I make this often-- for breakfast, as a lunch box snack, pot lucks. Minimal tweaking makes it even better than written. My mother taught me that a pinch of salt adds depth and complexity to the flavor of anything sweet. And how can you make a cake without vanilla? I add 1 tsp. vanilla extract, and 1/2 tsp. almond extract to the batter, and nutmeg to the cinnamon/sugar sprinkle. I served this at a dinner party, promising my kids leftovers for breakfast. . .but my friends liked it so much, they finished it. Fortunately, it was easy to make another one. Use as much fruit as the cake can hold. If you have any fresh berries on hand, drop them in the spaces between the sliced stone fruit. Yum!

I used 3 1/2 large nectarines in this recipe. The leftover cake became a soggy mess. Unless you have 8 or some very hungry people to finish this off, you might just throw the rest away. Would much rather have a cobbler or a crumble with the fruit.

Delicious. The cake is very plain, but the flavor is good. I added 1 tsp of vanilla in addition to the lemon. This would be great with almond extract & maybe orange as well as lemon. The nectarines were great & you could easily add berries to the top. Lots of thick fruit is the key to success here & be careful not to overcook to avoid dryness. My cake was actually more flavorful & moist the morning after I baked it than hot out of the oven. Simple, easy, quick & yummy. Oh, I did not bother with concentric circles, I just packed as many nectarines as I could in there & it looked & tasted great!

i have made this twice in the past week! 1st time followed directions - thought it was a tad dry, even tho i'd cooked it for 45min. 2nd time layered fruit on bottom, batter using 1c flour, more fruit on top...delicious!!!!!

This is a winner! I was asked to bring dessert to an "Oh, it's just a little dinner party."...NOT! I made two cakes and the hostess insisted on showing them to her guests before they were cut. They looked "professional". This is my go-to dessert for special occasions and "little dinner parties".

This is an exceptionally good recipe and very easy. I used a 9-inch springform pan and cut the nectarines as stated, arranging them in concentric circles, solidly covering the surface of the batter, but I was only able to use 3 1/2 medium nectarines instead of 5 as the recipe directs. Very good served warm with vanilla ice cream!

I was given a bag of white nectarines and wondered what to do with them, so I did a search and came up with this recipe. It was easy to make and came out tasting really lovely. It had a lovely flavour and just the right texture. It was perfect with double thick cream for an afternoon tea indulgence! I will definitely make it again.

This cake was a bit dry but the flavor was good.

This was fantastic, even as breakfast! To modify it for breakfast fare, I split the batter into muffin cups, reduced the butter and the sugar, and used some whole-wheat flour. The cake itself is fabulous due to the lemon flavor, and this is well complemented by the cinnamon/nectarine combination for good balance. I'd recommend this even in muffin form for a quick early breakfast! (In muffin pan, cooked ~20 min at 400 degrees)

Do try. This has become a go-to dessert for my, except I make with half the butter in a tart pan with any fruit that's handy.

Absolutely delicious! A perfect summer coffee cake. Followed directions, though perhaps added a few more nectarines, due to the bumper crop my tree was producing. Not too sweet with the right balance of flavors.

This was so good! It is an easy to make - not too sweet dessert. I would also make this for breakfast or brunch.

This was my third try at a fruit coffee cake, and by far the best. Great flavor (I added 1/2 tsp vanilla to the dough), with a nice light dough, and so easy to make. The sugar topping was a little too strong for my taste, so I think next time I'd reduce it to 2 Tbsp sugar and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. This was a real hit and a is great way to use summer stone fruit.

This is a wonderful coffee cake. Since nectarines were not available, I used a one pound bag of frozen peaches. I've also added some blueberries. I just defrosted the peach slices in the unopened bag. They worked perfectly well! I added 1 teaspoon of packed brown sugar to the topping. This has now been requested several times! It's quick and easy and delightful hot, warm or cold, with ice cream, or whipped cream or a sprinkle of powdered sugar.

PS. If you can't find self-rising flour, make it yourself! 2 cups AP flour, 2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt. I like to sift it and keep a jar on top of my AP flour to have when needed.

I made this in an attempt to use up some nectarines, and the result was beautiful and so tasty. It was so satisfying that I made it again a few days later. Simple and delightful with tea and/or ice cream. My fiance keeps asking when I'm making it again! Self-rising flour= 2 cups AP Flour, 2 tsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt. I keep a jar of it on top of my AP flour!

Here in Arkansas, the peach season is at its height. For this recipe, I used peeled peaches (both white and yellow) instead of nectarines. I also added a smidgen of ground cloves to the sugar and cinnamon. I gently pressed each slice of fruit into the sugar/spice mix, then placed the fruit on the cake batter, sugar-side-up. I sprinkled the remaider of the mixture on the cake as the recipe directs. The result was fantastic!!! I served the cake as a coffee cake for a Sunday brunch and everyone wanted the recipe.

To the Cook from Cannes : one certainly CAN get self-raising flour (popularly known as "farine à gateaux")in France. I've even found it in relatively small village groceries, though it does help if one knows what to look for. Try the "Francine" brand - look for the the following text : Gateaux, Farine de ble et poudre levante incorporee (i.e. wheat flour with raising/ baking powder included). Haven't made the recipe yet, hence no forks.

I've made this twice in three weeks-- just amazing and it makes the house smell wonderful. It even works well in a larger pan (I didn't have the size pan called for in the recipie). This makes a perfect coffee cake, because it is sweet and cinnamon with the bite of lemon. I don't know how anyone uses 4-5 nectarines in this recipe though. I've used 2 1/2 at the most and covered the top of the cake completely. I will be making this for guests often.

Like most everyone here, I had to change a few things; 3 nectarines were plenty; All-purpose flour/2tsp baking powder/1/2tsp salt instead of self rising flour; Sprinkling the cake with all the sugar/cinnamon at the end was not necessary, cut it to 1/3 of that and add just a touch of clove; please, serve with ginger whipped cream. You can use any stone fruit on hand.

Followed Vedika's modifications (below) and this cake was fantastic! I didn't end up using as many nectarines as the recipe called for, even though I used a 10" springform pan. While the batter appears VERY thick, the cake comes out moist and flavorful.

I substituted pluots for the nectarines and it was yummy. It was even better day 2. The cake had a nice lemony flavor and with the sweet pluots, it was a perfect accompaniment to my morning java.

I made this to take to a potluck and my friends just loved it (I did too)! I didn't change anything -except perhaps to use more cinnamon- and it was delicious.

Four forks only with modifications: This didn't seem like enough batter so I made 1.5x the amount. The idea of lemon zest didn't appeal to me so I used 1.5 teaspoons vanilla. For self-raising flour, I found a formula for it calling for 4 oz. of flour to 1.5 teaspoons baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt. I also added 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon to the batter. I used peaches and only needed 3 of them. It had to bake for a lot longer (1 hour; 30 minutes). The result was STELLAR.

Keep this cake in mind for occasions when you need something quick & easy. Followed recipe except for adding 2 teaspoons vanilla paste. Family loved it.

A great summer or fall cake; I only needed 4 nectarines, but could have used more batter. Took about an hour to fully bake... but turned out delicious!

Delicious! Don't have self-rising flour in France, but added baking powder and it worked like a charm. Will try with vanilla instead of lemon next time, but I loved it.

I made it using the plums and it was fabulous. Great with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, or just by itself! I used unbleached all-purpose flour and 2 Tbsp. baking powder as I didn't have the self-rising kind on hand.

This was a simple, easy and tasty dessert that we all enjoyed. I'll be making this again and may try it with plums sometime, though the nectarines were great.

I just made this with peaches, and it is wonderful and easy. I, too don't keep self rising flour, but added the teaspoon and a half baking powder and salt as a previous reviewer suggested and it was great. I skipped the lemon, and added vanilla and what a great dessert.

This cake was quick and easy and did look very nice when it was done, but I didn't think it had much flavor. If I was ever going to make it again, I'd definitely skip the lemon and add some vanilla.

This was yummy! An easy homemade dessert after a weekend family dinner. I used peaches. And, I did cut down the sugar to 2/3 cup as well. I also used more cinnamon. Perfect.

Easy to make and delicious. Real comfy type food. I made it with a mixture of nectarines and peaches. I'm sure any fruit would work well. Will put this in my to keep recipe file.

I didn't have self-rising flour, so I added some baking powder to the flour and that worked fine. It's a great recipe for using extra fruit - I substituted some ripe peaches for the necterines and the whole family couldn't get enough!

We made this with a mixture of small Ontario yellow plums and apricots and it was just delicious. I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup for the cake and it was perfect ... not too sweet and the fruit on top was very tart. I didn't have self-rising flour so I just added 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt per cup of flour. I'll definitely make it again with whatever fruit is available.

It seems like the perfect quick and easy recipe that is great for when you have lots of fresh fruit after a trip to the farmers market, but who has self-rising flour as a staple in thier pantry?

Mine turned out absolutely beautiful. It has a nice, homey flavor, the way that cobbler or buckle is homey, but is way more attractive.
