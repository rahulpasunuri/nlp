I MADE THIS RECIPE TONIGHT AND OF COURSE I FIDDLED WITH IT.TO BEGIN WITH I USED 1/4 C OF KRAFT GREEK DRESSING AND 2+TB OF OLIVE OIL.I ALSO ADDED SOME CAPERS AND BLACK OLIVES AND A FEW PEPPERONCINI PEPPERS.THIS I MIXED TOGETHER AND THEN POACHED BONELESS CHICKEN BREASTS.I SERVED THE MIXTURE OVER MESCULIN GREENS WITH THE THINLY SLICED CHICKEN ON TOP.IT WAS A HIT HERE

Excellent twist on chicken salad. However the best was when I made it with left over smoked turkey. Raised it at least 1 fork. Excellent. Try it...

I was surprised at how bland this was given the ingredients in the recipe. Maybe it was just an off day for me, but imagine my horror when people started asking for the cayenne!

This was a really easy and fast one that my daughter, who hates celery and olives, liked.
