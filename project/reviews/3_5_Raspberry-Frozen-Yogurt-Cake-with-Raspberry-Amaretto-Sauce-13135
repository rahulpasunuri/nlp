Though the cake is very tasty, it doesnt make much of a cake. Next time I would double the cake batter. I used additonal amaretto to the cake layers and to the frozen yogurt. It added a nice touch.

I have made this recipe twice, so far, for two clients' dinner parties. It's an understatement to say that this cake has been a HIT!! I have made a few additions/changes to the recipe though: I double the cake batter part & cut each layer into 2 using 3 layers for the cake (leaving 1 leftover to freeze for later use); drizzle some Amaretto liquor over each layer before "icing" with the frozen yogurt; I use Breyer's French Vanilla ice cream in place of frozen yogurt; and last of all I add shaved white chocolate to the top with the almonds & fresh raspberries. I also used frozen raspberries for the filling & sauce and they work great. It is SO decadent, beautiful & delicious! I will continue to make this for clients & family for years to come!!!
