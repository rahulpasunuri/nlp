delish - I will definately make this again. This is one of those dishes your friends will ask you to make again and again.

This has become a family favorite, I mix herbs based on what I have - it's best if you do use plenty of parsley and chives. You can roast the potatoes ahead of time but do NOT mix in the pesto until serving - it does not keep well.

This didn't work so well for me as I too, am not used to the flavor of fresh, uncooked rosemary which I mixed with thyme, dill, and parsley. It was much too sharp and pungent for my taste with these herbs. Next time, I will coat the potatoes with the pesto and roast which will mellow the herbs to my liking. Probably a good recipe for many, just not for my taste. Perhaps a different combination of herbs, milder ones, would have been a better choice I'm thinking.

it was easy to prepare and the herbs give the potatoes a fresh look. i also added some dill that i had on hand for another dish- it was great. i paired it with roasted chicken and it went well together.

I made these potatoes to accompany salmon for guests. My prep was a little different, I didn't want to heat up my kitchen so I skewered the potatoes and microwaved them for 4 to 5 minutes and then fininished them on the outdoor grill. They came out wonderful! My guests all loved them.

Really easy and amazing. Used about 1/2 of the 'pesto' on 3 lbs. potatoes. Only used rosemary and some dried parsley (all I had on hand). My new standard roasted potatoes.

Yummy, I'm not used to such a strong pesto... but this came out lovely, really fresh.

Yum! Sis made these for Easter dinner and they were delicious! Definitely going in the regular rotation.

These are so delicious! We make roasted potatoes all the time, but have never added all the herbs/spices AFTER roasting. The freshness of the herbs really came through. We added a little more olive oil to the pesto b/c it was initially dry, and doubled the garlic (b/c we love garlic!). Definitely one of the best potato recipes we've made!

These were delicious! Made the first time with red potatoes as recipe suggested. Second time used sweet potatoes. Lovely balance with the pesto! Will definately make both again.

Simply, easily delicious! This is a new staple. I had made variations of this in the past, but this is definitely the most flavorful.

Very good, however, seemed a little strong in flavor -- either too much lemon or too much rosemary.

Worked well with grilled flank steak. Everyone enjoyed it. It did require more olive oil though.

I served this with the almond crusted salmon for Easter, and it was a big hit! The pesto was very easy to make, although I looked at it, and didn't think there was much there after it was blended!! It turned out to be plenty...really gave the potatoes a wonderful flavor!

Everyone loved it! Very tasty, didn't use all of the pesto though...could use on 3-3.5 pounds of potatos

I'm thinking about making these potatoes for a dinner party. Can I make them 2 hours ahead and keep in my oven warmer without giving up the quality of the dish?

Really outstanding! Served with lamb at Easter dinner and I just wanted to eat the potatoes! Perfect for spring.

I made this with 4 pounds of potatoes, same measurements for the pesto as written in the recipe. My guests loved them. One of the best potato dishes I've ever made or eaten.

It is in my recipe file as "BEST POTATOES EVER". I think that should speak for itself! Use fresh herbs and enjoy!

The combination of fresh herbs and lemon in the pesto was delicious and very refreshing. The dish also looked very beautiful. We used a combination of white and red potatoes. The only drawback was that it did not keep well as leftovers so it should all be eaten fresh. We'll definitely make this one again.

I made this for Easter with rack of lamb and a couple of times since. It's fabulous. Make sure you use fresh herbs. Everyone loved it!

I also added green olives to the pesto for extra olive flavour and some more garlic and it tasted marvellous.

This is a very simple recipe. It accompanied a spiral ham very nicely. However, I had to add much more than 3 tablespoons of olive oil. The pesto was too dry otherwise.

I left out the lemon all together and these were still fabulous. I made them for a dinner party and they made a great no fuss side dish and I received rave reviews. I made the pesto the night before. The flavors blended nicely and it cut down on prep time at the dinner hour!

Interesting, fresh taste. Would complement lamb very well, I think. I only used 1 tablespoon of rosemary and it came out fine. Very easy to put together!

I added too much lemon juice to this recipe, but will try it again. They did come out very crispy.
