The crepes turned out perfect for me. For those of you who say the batter is too thick, are you missing the 1/2+ cup water that is supposed to be added? It's not listed in the ingredients list, but does appear in the text. I could see how the batter would be really thick without that. I make the crepes pretty often and fill them with ice cream from the local ice cream store for a super easy dessert. I've made the sauce and filling too and really like them as well.

I too thought the crepe batter was to thick and it did turn out rubbery. But the filling and sauce were amazing. The only other problem I encountered was that I had to double the filling. I was making it as a desert for a dinner party, the crepe batter made ~20 crepes and the filling only filled ~8.

The filling was delicious, but the crepes themselves turned out kind of rubbery ... ech! The batter was too thick to swirl into the pan for a nice thin crepe.

Outstanding, although an inexperienced crepe-maker could have some difficulty! Rich, smooth, delicious, with just a hint of mint.

this was a bit disasterous for me... the crepe batter was indeed too thick, and the souffle part didn't rise. the chocolate sauce is great with ice cream, though. all in all a complicated recipe that would be okay if you're concentrating on dessert, but much too labor-intensive for entertaining.

I've made several recipes from Epicurious in the past and have had much success. I wasted 4 hrs in the kitchen fussing with this recipe. The chocolate sauce is the only redeeming value. The crepe mix as listed is too thick; I had to keep watering it down. The souffle falls flat even after careful preparation. I ended up relying on good old Betty Crocker for a chocolate mousse filling.

This recipe was great (although I did skip the mint). I made the crepes for a dinner party, and it was perfect because I was able to make both the crepes and chocolate sauce the day before. I'd definitely make these again.

I made this dessert for my sister's birthday, everyone adored it! The chocolate was fabulously rich and not too sweet. A chocolate lover's dream. I omitted the mint extract and sauce the second time I made it, still smashing!
