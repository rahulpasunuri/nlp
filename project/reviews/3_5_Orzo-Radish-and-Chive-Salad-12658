Increased everything but the orzo by a bit more than 1/2, added thyme and thinly sliced shallot and served over spring mix of lettuce. Delicious!!

This was awesome! I had some leftover medium pasta shells and was looking for a pasta salad that I could quickly make for lunch and this was it. I am going to make it again and eat it for lunch tomorrow.

OMG - totally incredible - I found myself eating out of a plastic beer cup instead of filling it with beer it was so yummy :) Thanks to my coworkers wife for introducing me to it!

Yes, this dish is somewhat bland and boring. Yet I've found myself making it again and again over the years. It is quick to make, soothing, and goes with anything. Sometimes I add some asparagus just to rev up the colours alittle.

This was an absolutely delicious and comforting dish!! I did not find anything blah about it!I cooked the orzo in chicken broth and like another reviewer added generous amounts of pepper. Easy..easy..easy and quick to prepare!

Blah I was surprized that it was so tasteless. Don't waste your time.

Oh my! This dish was so simple and delicious. I made it for 8, so I multiplied all the ingredients by 6 except for the mayonnaise. I only used 5 scant tablespoons, and the end result was a tangy, lemony, and refreshing salad. This is a wonderful side dish that would also work well as a light lunch all by itself -- it's THAT GOOD!

I have made this recipe many times since I first saw it in the magazine. Tonight I'm going to make enough for 50 people for a party. It is one of my staples: so easy and fresh-tasting. It complements a lot of things. I also use fresh black pepper liberally.

I was literally astounded that a recipe with so few ingredients could taste so good! It is very rich, so I would cut down on the mayo next time. I also included a healthy dose of black pepper.
