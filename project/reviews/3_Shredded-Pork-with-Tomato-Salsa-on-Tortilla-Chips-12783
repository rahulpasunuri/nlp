I used this just for the "carnitas" portion. I thought it was very good. I think the cooking time can vary dramatically based on your interpretation of the directions. In general, the green onion and garlic tend to dissolve over the long cooking period, which is good. The only thing I removed when shredding the meat, therefore, was the lime zest. Note that the process for cooking these carnitas is very similar to that recommended by Rick Bayless and Diana Kennedy.

I served this dish for dinner on open tortillas with a side salad. Very flavorful.
