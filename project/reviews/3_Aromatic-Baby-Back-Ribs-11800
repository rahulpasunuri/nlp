I thought this was the poorest rib recipe I've every tried. The meat was dry and much too salty. It doesn't hold a candle to Alton Brown's braised baby back ribs.

I read the other reviews and decided to only use 3/4 tsp of ground cloves. I marinated them for about 5 hours - next time I'll plan ahead and do them overnight. My husband really liked these and he's a picky eater.

As a Texan, I found this recipe to be a welcome retreat from the more common wet ribs of the state. Finding all the right spices didn't prove too difficult and the overall feedback from everyone was that it was incredible. The only setback was the appearance of the ribs. I'm not sure what I would suggest to improve that. Maybe some garnishing or something. Worth making again.

I agree with the other reviewers that a whole tablespoon of ground cloves would have been way overboard. I used 1 teaspoon and the flavor was still prominent (almost dominant). Next time I'll back down to 3/4 tsp. I used thick boneless pork chops instead of ribs and garnished with fresh chopped cilantro. Mighty tasty! -- I will definitely be making this again.

I wrote this original recipe. The dry rub method with small amounts of liquid ingredients, the soy sauce and the worcestershire is almost fool proof. And yes, I agree with a reviewer that less ground cloves is appropriate for most palates. It is any easy and satisfactory and very tasty way cook ribs. No pots and pans, just one disposable foil roaster. I might add, that any great barbecue sauce, bottled or scratch, as a side "dip" is delicious.

Great Recipe, something a little different, makes a great change.

The only change I would make would be the amount of cloves. Cloves are very pungent & I found that they took over. I try only 1 tsp. or even 1/2 tsp. & I would increase the coriander a bit.
