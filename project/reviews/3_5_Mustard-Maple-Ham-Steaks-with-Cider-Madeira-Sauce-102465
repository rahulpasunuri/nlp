This was OK, but just OK. Nothing special. I'll look for something else next time, but didn't throw away the leftovers.

The pork chops turned out to be very good and moist. Will definately prepare this dish again.

I only did the sauce...tossed the ham steak on the grill. I don't think I can EVER eat ham steak and mashed potatoes again unless I have this sauce with them...mmmmm yummy!!!! Didn't have Madeira; used port instead.

Instead of using 2 tbps of mustard, I used 4. I mixed regular mustard with a great french "rustic" mustard to add an extra "kick" to the flavor. This is great and was loved by all at my last culinary club meeting.

I cannot comment on your recipe as I used it for inspiration. I lacked all of the ingredients except the ham. I substituted about a cup of dark brown sugar and 1-2 tsps powdered mustard. I rubbed that on the steaks and placed in a large corningwear baking dish. I poured a like amount of red wine(merlot) just to the edges, not to cover. I baked per your instructions and it was just wonderful. Served with long baked new potatoes(creamy!) and tender green beans. We used the sauce liberally on everything. Delicious!!!

Hate to disagree with everyone but this is just too sweet...much prefer Ham with Tart Berry Sauce.

I make this often, although I never bother with the cider sauce. The mustard-maple glaze is enough, and it's a great easy-to-make meal.

WOW! What a way to spice up a quick and easy weekday dinner. I made this dish with cheesy scalloped potatoes and green beans.

I found that adding the apple cider to the ham steak formed some liquid in the pan I used this instead of the apple cider called for in the sauce. I also added whole grain prepared mustard to the sauce it was awesome. I served it with roasted potatos. Excellent Best I ever had!

Wonderful, simple, and even my kids loved it! I doubled the number of bay leaves, and it still wasn't enough. Next time, I'll make more of the mustard/maple spread for the top - it is very flavorful and the amount in the recipe seemed skimpy. Also, note that reducing the Madeira/cider sauce is TO 1/2 cup, not BY 1/2 cup. Mine was at first too thin (until I noticed the key word). Finally, do not overcook the ham - it will be tough if you don't watch carefully.

This is great comfort food!! I served it with Barley, Corn, Red Pepper & Green Onion Pilaf (Jan. 1995 Bon Appetit) and fresh asparagus. My husband, who does not normally like ham steak, raved about the good flavors. Definitely a keeper recipe.
