This recipe was great, quick and easy! Cheap, handy ingredients too. I added fresh chopped onion and crushed garlic to the cooking olives and it tasted great! Definitely will make again!

This is one of the family's favorite weekday dishes. Make Mario Battalia's (sp?) basic tomato sauce. I have used a variety of olives, but usually kalamata as they are almost always on hand. I have always used frozen gnocchi, but am sure flavor would improve if using fresh. A can't go wrong weeknight dish.

This sauce made a piquant complement to the homemade parsley gnocchi that I had in the freezer.. Followed the recipe to a T--it's a quick and easy winner!

After reading the reviews for this recipe and being a huge Lidia fan, I made this recipe for my husband's birthday meal since it fell on a Monday night. I doubled the recipe and used two packages of air vacuumed gnocchi, a jar of Gia Russa Tomatoe Basil Sauce, a mixture of different large pitted green olives from my deli and extra basil and cheese as suggested...IT WAS FABULOUS!!! Needless to say we will be eating this as a staple and may even impress last minute company. It not only tastes really good but is beautiful on the plate. We served with crusty baguette.

This is a simple and delicious mid-week meal. Like others, I find it easier to buy the pre-made, fresh (not frozen!) Gnocchi available in my local stores. However, unlike any previous reviewers that I have read, I do not boil the gnocchi. Instead I pan fry them in extra virgin olive oil for 5 minutes or so, until they turn lightly brown and delicately crisp on the outside. Serve with a fresh green salad. Bon appétit.

This is an excellent dish, and very easy if you use packaged gnocchi and a good bottled pomodoro (I used Trader Joe's Rustico Traditional Southern Italian Sauce). I also substituted kalamata olives for the suggested green variety, and added a little extra basil. I have to add that this doesn't necessary make the best leftovers. I assume it's because the gnocchi is too delicate to respond well to reheating.

I make this all the time because it is delicious, easy, and fast. I usually make it with arrabbiata sauce, and sometimes I add mushrooms with the olives.

very nice. go easy on the cheese though, as gnocchi is already hearty.

This was excellent and very easy to make. I used sliced spanish olives stuffed with minced pimiento and it turned out great. I added more basil than the recipe called for because I'm a big basil fan, but I'm sure the recipe would be fine with the amount suggested.

This was excellent. I uses a variation of the Tomato Sauce recipe, the gnocchi (made and frozen the day before), and large green olives in garlic from the deli section of the grocery. The younger generation especially raved and were thrilled when I sent them home with leftovers.
