I've made this recipe many times, several times as a hostess. I usually subsitute Mango for the Papaya and they are so fabulous. They're also a light and easy summer time meal. A favorite in our house.

Good but uninspirational. There are other recipes out there that use essentially the same ingredients but better preparation procedures. I'll use those.

This was great! I was leery of the papaya, especially since I really didn't like the taste of the raw fruit.. But it turned out amazing. I will definitely make this again.

I was pretty unimpressed with these. Papaya didn't have enough zip to stand up to the richness of the brie (mango would have been better). It was bland and became just a carrier for salsa.

Great flavours. Everyone loved it. I also tried it with mango and it was lovely. The heat makes the fruit a bit wet so do not over-fill them.

This was OK, but a little bland. I would try to spice it up a bit if I make it again.

This is a good one - I have made many variations of it. Delish and easy.

Loved this recipes. Would recommend eating it with sour cream and homeade salsa. Ate the leftovers the next day for lunch and it reheated great.

Very well received. I will definitely make this again. This recipe went out to several people!

Made this for my first cocktail party ever and was amazed at how well this went over with my guests. Sauted the onion and jalapeno & diced the Brie the day before to save on time. Did not bother with sour cream or salsa - the dish stood fine on its own.

I was very pleased with this dish. I substituted mango and paired it with plain yogurt instead of sour cream - very delicious. Will definately make again!

Great for a crowd..I've made this several times using both mango and papaya @ the same time..it really works when I addred thin strips of roast pork loin (marinated in honey and hoison!). Forget the salsa it thrives on the richness of the sour cream.

Really good ... and really easy. I've made it twice in the last two days, and will definitely make it again. I used vidalia onion; skipped the sour cream (you really don't need it); and served with a purchased "Pineapple Salsa". Yum yum.

This is a great easy, but different sort of appetizer recipe. I've made it a couple fo times and people who say they don't usually like brie do really lik ethis recipe.

I substituted Mango for the Papaya and the results were wonderful! The sweet blended with the hot pepper is a great combination. I have made it many times during the summer months for cocktail parties and our guests always rave. It is great sliced and served without salsa or sour cream to save calories(brie has enough).

Yum, Yum and YUM. Served with a spicy pineapple-mango-cucumber salsa. Also did a variation with shredded smoked chicken...DEEEE-Lish!

I love this recipe, and have made it many times before! Try serving it with plain yoghurt instead of sour cream for a nice change.

Fabulous dish. I used a maui onion and added a little sweet chili sauce to that. Had it for a main so added some BBQ chicken ( actually huli huli). Had them with guacamole,salsa and sour cream. YUM

I have made this several times, each time using Mango -- IT IS AMAZING and a REAL crowd pleaser!

I made this for Bunco this week (along with the chicken skewers with chipotle sauce) and they were gone in a flash. I've given out the recipe twice already.

Very very good and easy. One change however. We do NOT like cilantro, therefore, I substituted fresh basil, which I think worked fine.

I have made this recipe several times and it is very good. It makes a wonderful meal when you are looking for something very quick to put together that has nice flavor.

I've made this recipe a few times for guests and they have always enjoyed it. Like others, I used mango one time when papayas were unavailable. It was good either way.

This was OK. Brie is expensive and can be put to much better use in other recipes. "Plain old quesadillas" with Payapa Salsa are better.

I made this for dinner tonight for me and my boyfriend. We both thought it was very interesting, possessing a tasty "exotic" flavor. I may not make this exact recipe again, because I don't usually have brie on hand and wasn't blown away by this recipe, but I might make a mango black-bean quesadilla, following the basic model of the best recipe I've found on epicurious, Pinto Bean and Feta Cheese Quesadillas (try them!!!). By the way, I used whole wheat tortillas, which were pretty and tasted good. Also, I cooked the tortillas on my cast iron griddle -- always a winner for good quesadillas. I agree with a previous reviewer: use a sweet onion.

This is a winner. I look forward to trying it with mango. A sweet onion is the best choice here.Serve with a fruit based salsa. Brie worked so well here I hesitate to suggest other choices but gouda or raclette would be interesting as well.

Quite different with great combinations. Served with habanero salsa. Everyone raved about them!

This was the hit dish at my dinner party. Like others, I used mango instead of papaya. I didn't have fresh jalapeno chilis so I used pickled jar ones with no problem. This will be my new "signature" appetizer dish for a long time. Yum.

This has become a barbecue standard with us, but I truly like it even better with mango rather than papaya!

Outstanding recipe! Served as an appetizer at a dinner party and it was the hit of the dinner. Very easy to make and could be brought to someone else's house if ingredients are prepared ahead and then assembled just before making. Can't wait to make again!

I have made this dish a few times now, every time I get many compliments on it and they are gone within minutes! The mixture of sweet and hot are very interesting together- I will definately make these over and over.

Great dish - will definately make it again. don't skimp on the Brie. I fried them with a little olive oil so they would be crisp. I added mushrooms and used a garlic salsa.

I agree, this wasn't so great. Everything on its own sounded good, but there were way too many competing flavors in this dish. I might try it with just the mango and brie and cilantro, but the whole thing was certainly not my favorite.

Rating: 1
Everyone has different taste preferences and this is definitely not mine. I was so disappointed, because this looked so good on paper but totally flopped on the plate. I think it was the combination of the brie and the mango (I substituted) that turned me off.

Rating: 4
Wow, made these for a party and they were devoured! I served with peach salsa. Made some without onion/jalapeno for guests w/ allergies, still great. Suggestion: after removing from oven, flip the quesadilla, so the melted cheese adheres to the top tortilla and other ingredients.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I made some with mango and some with papaya for a luncheon and they were a hit. People definitely gravitated more towards the mango though - good suggestion. I have also used camenbert cheese in place of the brie - just as good. I would recommend it to anyone looking for something different and a little more exotic.

This is a wonderful recipe. I also make one with mango, brie, fresh cilantro, and minced fresh jalapeno. I fry them in unsalted butter, a small amount. They are so delightful, but don't skimp on the brie. I prefer the flavor of mango in this dish, and no onion.

I loved this recipe, but my husband said he'd like it as an appetizer. It was great as a light summer meal.

A delightful party appetizer! My guests raved! I served it with a fruit salsa (mango, pineapple, kiwi, peach, cilantro, peppers, scallions, tomato and lime) as well as sour cream with lime zest.

Do not use purple onions...they are too strong and overpower the papaya

This was a wonderful, summery quesadilla! Very light, while the papaya gives it some meatiness. YUMMY, and I will make these again!

MADE THE RECIPE FOR CINCO DE MAYO. GUESTS LOVED IT. THEY WERE GONE IN FLASH. GREAT WITH PAPAYA SALSA. MARGARITAS
