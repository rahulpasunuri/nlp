This soup was delicious, with a few modifications! I took the advice of others who added twice the amount of garlic (sautéed in olive oil). Two cups of chicken broth, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves, along with sea salt and cayenne pepper, and a cup of milk. My husband doesn't like a thin soup; the frozen fresh pumpkin was a bit watery, so I made a roux of 2 TBS butter and 2 TBS flour, cooked, then added some of the hot soup, stirred to incorporate, and poured into the bigger soup pot, stirring until thickened. Not too thick or too thin, and tasted great!

I picked this recipe over others because it seemed less fussy but offered a 2nd chance for the Halloween pumpkin. The non-pumpkin fan in my family really liked this. I used vegetable stock instead of the water and coconut milk instead of the half/half. I also added a little sauteed onion - but don't know if that was necessary. As other reviewers suggested, I tried 1/8 tsp each of cinnamon, allspice and cayenne and found just the right amount of heat and spice. Even though I have a big sweet tooth, next time I would use a little less syrup. I skipped the butter and the mushrooms. Would definitely make again.

I made this soup and got raves from people who said they don't care for pumpkin. After reading the other reviews, I made a few changes. I sautéed the garlic first. Then I used broth rather than water. Changed the spice to curry and used 1 tsp. The result was a wonderful flavorful soup!

With a few tweaks based on the reviews, I just made this. It is INCREDIBLE!!! We love it and it is amazingly easy. The tweaks were to use rich turkey broth we had in the house instead of water, up the garlic to two cloves, use mostly cream instead of half and half (again, what we had in the house), skip the butter, and add 1/2 tsp curry instead of five spice powder. I have spice-timid children; if I didn't I'd put at least a teaspoon of curry powder in. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I followed the recipe exactly. The ingredients were so easy, but the taste just really fell flat. The soup was very watery and the Chinese All Spice seemed to be a bit too overpowering. Would not make again.

Made a half recipe (for 2 adults, 1 kid - was plenty). Also used chicken broth, double garlic, double maple syrup, and added salt. No mushrooms or 5-spice blend on hand, so I just used pinches of cloves, ginger, cinnamon, and ground anise seed.

I made this recipe with canned pumpkin, chicken broth, double garlic sauteed in butter till very brown, and the sauteed shitake mushrooms... I added about a tablespoon of sea salt. It was delicious! I didn't find it bland at all. Very tasty and I can't wait to try the 2nd day version!

I loved this recipe but made alterations. I used chicken stock instead of water and whole milk instead of half and half. I also did not have the 5 spice and so used 1/8 teaspoon each of cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, ginger, and cayenne. Tasting this before serving, I found that it needed more heat. I added 5 dashes of Tabasco. It really rounded out the flavor and left heat in the back of the throat - without it the soup's flavors were not mixing well.

I would absolutely make this again. Even with all the great reviews, i found that this turned out even better than i had anticipated. I did add some cayenne for some extra heat and some ground ginger along with the chinese 5 spice.

Great with some minor adjustments: coconut milk instead of half & half, double the garlic, siracha for extra kick, LOTS of salt and pepper. Even better the 2nd day.

I really did not like this recipe. Maybe I'm just not a fan of 5 spice and sweet (maple syrup) in my soup but I thought this wasn't so good even with a bunch more salt.

I'm surprised at the last review listed but I suppose we all have our own plates for certain flavors. I used the chicken broth sub for water and followed the suggestion to sauté the garlic. I was nervous to use my real maple syrup since its $$ but took the plunge and it made the difference.

One of the worst recipes ever... Tasted very pasty. I would not recommend this recipe at all.

I have now made this twice. First time, I followed the other suggestions (chix broth instead of water, double the garlic, more salt) and it was good. The second time, one additional change made it great: I sauteed the garlic in the butter before adding the broth, pumpkin and half & half. It eliminated the raw garlic aftertaste and made for better blended flavors. (n.b. i made it w/o the mushrooms because BF doesn't like them.)

I doubled this recipe and had to add a signifcant amount of maple syrup and spices beyond what is called for in the recipe. It turned out marvellous, but given all the syrup, I'm not sure how healthy it was! Definitely substitute broth for the water.

I served this soup as a first course on Thanksgiving, and it was wonderful. I did, however, also follow the advice of previous reviewers, and substitute broth for the water, and more than double the garlic. I also used cubed portabella mushrooms. I would not make this soup without the mushrooms -- they are a wonderful deep and earthy addition! I think next time I might add some wine or something else as a little bit of acid to make it pop more.

This was my first attempt to use fresh pumpkin after Halloween. For a simple recipe, there's lots of bang for the buck and limited number of ingredients. I used canned chicken broth for water, fat free half and half for the real stuff, and the same weight fresh pumpkin for canned. Let it sit overnight and it won't be so bland. The five spice is a winner.

This was a hit at a Halloween party! Based on previous recommendations, I used the 2 cans of pumpkin, 2 cups of veggie broth (no water), 1 can of coconut milk (15 oz) in lieu of the half-&-half, 5 chopped garlic cloves, 1-2 T of pumpkin spice, a dash of cayenne powder, SALT!, and left out the mushrooms. Wonderful, smooth texture. Great taste. Will definitely make it again for weekday dinners - so easy! I made it 2 days in advance, which worked out quite well. Definitely try this soup!

I have made this twice. Once for family and once for a luncheon. Everyone RAVED about the soup - texture, flavor, everything. You must use the chinese 5 spice powder and a good quality maple syrup. A definite keeper for winter.

Very easy recipe. I did however, take the other reviewers advise and use chicken broth instead of water, add salt and use more garlic (2 cloves). It was delicious and everyone wanted the recipe. Making a day ahead really helps the flavors blend. Also I could not find the chinese spice, so I used Emeril's Asian essence which has it in it and it worked very well.

I just pulled this out this year after having made it for several holiday season meals last year. Yes, using broth rather than water, adding salt, and doubling the garlic really help--as does making the night before so the flavors can meld and develop. It is delicious, very easy, and a favorite of my guests.

This recipe and the previous reviews inspired me to improvise. I used a can of pumpkin puree, one can of coconut milk, 2 cups of chicken broth, a tablespoon of garam masala,a teaspoon of curry powder, and a dash of cayenne. This resulted in a creamy and rich soup that took about five minutes and completely wow-ed my lunch guests. I also made a honey wheat bread (in my bread maker) and served a green salad. No need to even go to the market since all of the ingredients were on hand.

This soup was so easy and very tasty. The only changes I made was to use veggie broth instead of water and heavy cream instead of half and half (it was all I had at home). Otherwise it was perfect!

As a relative newcomer to the land of soup-making, I was delighted at how easy the dish is to prepare. By accident, I added approximately 3-4 tbsp. of cinnamon mixed with sugar. It worked REALLY well with the maple syrup. The Shitake mushrooms worked, but there must be a better compliment...

I also modified this recipe: vegetable broth instead of water, 1 tsp. garam masala instead of 5-spice, no mushrooms, added a dash of cayenne, lots of salt, and I added toasted pumpkin seeds/pepitas to the soup as a finishing touch. Served it with shredded sharp cheddar. My guests raved and all asked for the recipe- I'll be sure to include my modifications!

I LOVE this soup. I did add extra garlic, i skipped the mushrooms, and added some fresh grated parmesan cheese to top each bowl. It is a sweet soup, definitely, but utterly yummy, easy comfort food. I've made it twice, and friends were impressed, and couldn't believe it when i told them how easy it was.

I made this soup for a dinner party and all of my guests really liked it. I did substitue chicken stock as suggested. I also upped the salt quite a bit. Then again, I halved the five spice, left out the mushrooms (one guest was allergic) and added lots of grated ginger. So, I suppose it was kind of the same soup!

I substituted fresh crimini for the shiitake, and used Emeril's 5 spice mix. I also used fresh pumpkin. Maybe it would have been better had I stuck to the recipe, however, I couldn't get my human-garbage-disposal husband to finish the first bowl. The ingredients could definitely be put to a better use.

Decided to give this soup a go. It seemed so simple that it was worth a try. Used chicken stock, 3 cloves of garlic, etc. I am sorry to say, I am joining the 1 fork ratings. It was bland. I have a huge amount left -- we'll give it one more try in the next day or so. Hopefully, the review stating that it tastes better the next day is true.

First off this was so easy! It was however, pretty bland and not so yummy when it was done. But then I doubled the five spice and added a tablespoon of cayenne pepper. Then it was full of flavor : )

I tried this recipe substituting chick broth for the water as suggested by others who rated this. I added at least one tablespoon of kosher salt (probably quite a bit more) and an extra clove garlic...just because. Since the mushrooms are expensive, and I'd be the only one who'd eat them, I decided to omit. While the end result was quite tasty to my 6 year old and me, my 4 year old and my husband would have nothing to do with it. Although I thought it was very good, I personally need more texture...maybe toasted sliced almonds, and something I can sink my teeth into. The only reason my husband dipped a spoon into the soup was because our children made this themselves...to show respect for their effort. His comment was (out of earshot of the kids) was "sorry, but I can't eat runny pumpkin pie". So...great cooking project for kids, and excellent if you can get past the pumpkin-for-pie only thing.

By the way, I know that the link says 5-spice is equal parts, but the people at our local asian market tell me that the blend they do isn't. Guess that's another one we could discuss ad infinitim...

This is THE best soup I've had in my life, my husband said. I loved it, a friend loved it and my 2 kids hated it. I made it with water, it needs salt, definitely, and I used fresh pumpkin. If you like spicy stuff, you'll love it as much as I did.

Why add syrup to a savory soup? Make this like a regular cream of pumpkin or squash soup and it will be much better.

Yum! Perfect autumn soup, and soooo easy to make. It needs quite a bit of salt to bring out the flavors of the soup, and I also added about 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to enhance the pumpkin flavor, and used 4 cloves garlic, and veggie stock in place of the water. Very tasty, flavorful and balanced. If you'd like to spruce it up, spoon into bowls with 1/2 inch rims, put frozen puff pastry on top (making sure to cut it so that it drapes over bowl edges by about 1 inch, and brush underside with beaten egg so it will stick to the bowl) and bake until pastry puffs and is golden. What a wonderful (and easy) presentation, and a great flavor and texture pairing with the soup.

I was a bit reluctant to try this soup since many of the reviewers thought it was bland. However, I thought I had nothing to lose since the recipe is so easy. I'm so glad I tried it. The addition of chicken stock and SALT is the key to this soup being really, really good. I re-read some of the reviews after making it myself and I'm convinced that all the reviewers who thought it was bland, unfortunately, did not add any salt. If you are waivering on this recipe, I encourage you to try it.

I have to agree with the negative reviews (too bad I didn't see them before making the soup). My family found the soup bland and tasteless. We added some ginger, which helped to some extent.

This is my favorite soup ever. I add a lot of pumpkin pie spice and Emeril's Asian Essence (which contains chinese five-spice). I love salt on everything, and use it HEAVILY here. It gives it a suprisingly smooth bite!

This soup is perfect for a cold autumn day! It is easy and simple. The shittake mushrooms are an excellent touch. I used shittakes from the farmer's market. (By the way- the recipe in Bon Appetit magazine calls for 4c of chicken broth-not H20) salt and pepper to taste...

This is the only negative review I've written, but I feel this soup truly deserves it! It tasted watery, lacked flavor, and had a strange consistency. It was not a hit at our dinner party, but the blue cheese and walnut souffle made up for it. Now that's a great recipe. I'd stay away from this soup.

I made this the day before and fried mini-banana slices instead of mushrooms (I won't do that again: the taste was OK, but they sank to the bottom of the bowl). The reviews were a little mixed. "Pumpkins belong in pie," siad one of my guests (I guess they're not coming back); but most people thought it was nice. It was extremely easy to make.

The five spice makes it!! Try a sweeter version with pumpkin pie filling instead. If you like a thicker soup, simmer about 20-30 minutes whisking frequently. Freezes well for that special treat after the first snow shovelling.

This was ridiculously simple, but pretty good. I didn't make it with the mushrooms, since I knew my husband and 7 yr. old son would never go for it. The soup needed a lot of salt and pepper, but it did improve tremendously overnight and reheated the next day.

Though I think this recipe has potential, I was disappointed when I made it. The next time I will substitute chicken or vegetable stock for the water because I felt the recipe was somewhat bland. However, I didn't have the Chinese Five Spice powder so I substituted equal amounts of clove, ginger, and cinnamon perhaps having the Five Spice would have added the extra touch. I will agree that the recipe was ridiculously simple.
