This has become a summertime staple in our house. Remarkable, considering I rarely use the same recipe twice (or manage to follow one correctly in the first place.)

Not bad (if topped with sour cream and salsa), but probably not worth the effort.

Every time I make this dish, people argue over who get's any of the leftovers. One couple has to sit across from each other so her husband doesn't grab it off her plate when she's not looking :)

This is delicious, but the next time I make it, I will increase the cheese and add a little fresh cilantro to the mix.
