I just made these (haven't eaten it all together yet) and they made it through the browning phase, but all the meatballs fell apart as soon as I put them in the tomato sauce. ??? I didn't add egg as some other folks have. I browned them in cast iron, so maybe I was a little rough with them getting them to roll over? They seem to taste fine though.

The sauce was so simple and came out full of flavor! The meatballs need some gentle handling when being turned in the pan as they do want to fall apart if you aren't careful. The meatballs were flavorful and light. I think the step combining the milk and breadcrumbs in a bowl for 5 minutes was what made them so light. Delicious!

I've yet to be able to make meatballs that stay round. I always wind up with meat sauce, and this was no exception. I added the egg to try to assist, but alas... Still it tasted delicious, what's not to love with a meat sauce.

I made these last night. Super easy, didn't have veal so I used half beef, half pork. Also, if you cut in half, it's more than plenty for two people. No need for an egg to bind.

A basic, but excellent recipe. If serving over pasta, double the sauce.

I used half and half since I didn't have milk. I thought there would be way too many onions, but they were perfect. My picky husband loved them.

I was surprised that my 4yr old daughter LOVED this! I only had ground beef but I can't wait to try it again and I'll stick to the recipe this time.. It was a simple recipe but the texture was perfect. I chickened out and used an egg but I really don't think I have to. I will double the sauce as my hubby wanted more - LOL

The meatballs came out great but the sauce needs to be doubled if you are serving over pasta.

The meatballs are greast, the sauce isn't. I used one egg and they held together nicely. Im going to try a marinara sauce with these meatballs.

This recipe turned out great thanks to the tips from previous reviewers. The complete recipe took just over an hour, not bad. A few alterations to the original recipe: Added an extra can of dices tomatoes and tomato paste to increase the amount and thickness of sauce, also added sliced mushrooms and extra oregano and salt. Added an egg to the meatball mixture to act as a binder (works well) and Parmesan cheese. After browning meatballs in oil, placed them on a cookie sheet and baked ten minutes to cook out grease. Pasta was whole wheat and the meatballs were all beef. Tip: saute garlic with some diced onion in large pot, add mushrooms, then add tomato products and seasoning to make sauce. Boyfriend says that the dish tastes like restaurant style spaghetti and meatballs. Will definitely make again.

I liked this recipe very much, only chage I made was to add tomato paste to thicken it up, but the meatballs had a wonderful flavor and the sauce as well.

I made these meatballs for the first time yesterday and I was pleased with the results. They were easy to make and very popular with both my husband and toddler. I will never make meatballs using all beef again. Very good! This recipe will definitely be made often.

Excellent dish with great flavors. I am lactose intolerant, so I used soy milk in place of whole milk. I also used about double the amount of parsley.

Absolutely brilliant! My 15 year old Son has just made this and it was splendid. He doesn't normally cook and so it was a real treat that he did it so well and that the recipe was so clear for him to follow. The resulting meal was tasty, is now in our recipe box and has given us a new family cook!

This is easy and really yummy. I was surprised how flavorful the sauce was. I used crush seasoned croutons instead of fresh breadcrumbs and the meatballs were perfect. My kids are sensitive to spicy foods and these were just right, not too spicy!

This was excellent. I was looking for a good meatball recipe for the kids and they loved this. The sauce was very simple and very flavorful. I couldn't find the veal so I used pork and beef and the meatballs were still tender. I also used dried breadcrumbs which were fine. I added the garlic to the meatballs instead of the sauce (my mistake) but the sauce still had a nice flavor after simmering the meatballs. I will use this as my new spagetti sauce recipe!

Have made this recipe many times and it's always quick and pretty easy! I always add sugar to the sauce to counteract the acidity in the tomatoes.

We found that a medium onion makes it TOO strong, so we use a small one, about the size of a plum. We have made this several times, and last time didn't have anything to make fresh breadcrumbs with, and so we used water crackers and it was the best batch yet. We also add an additional regular sized can of chopped italian-seasoned tomatoes to the 28 oz. can of peeled tomatoes for a little more sauce. We've liked it best served with mini penne.

The recipe is simple and delicious, especially if you put it on crusty bread for a meatball sandwich. For a dairy free recipe: soak dairy free crumbled bread in tomato juice from the canned tomatoes instead of milk; it makes it taste like the sauce goes all the way through the meatballs.

Rating: 3
Some suggestions: add crushed garlic to the meat, substitute seasoned breadcrumbs for the plain,(it has parmesan in it) then you don't need the fresh parsley, add an egg, can use half and half instead of milk to hold the meat together. mince the onion so the meatball won't fall apart when frying. Adobo seasoning (by Goya) adds more flavor instead of just plain salt. Otherwise, this is a standard recipe.

Very good. A secret tip from an Italian grandmother is to add two tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese in the meatball mix. Try it- it makes for meatballs that practically melt in your mouth!

This recipe was so simple. I did nto have any veal so I just made the meatballs with pork and beef and it was still fantastic. I can't imagine what it would be like with the veal. I also added more tomatoes. I did not think that the 2 cans were enough. Great recipe and great meal! Will do it again!

This was fabulous. My wife prepared the sauce with 1 can progresso hearty tomato soup and 1 can whole peeled california tomatoes in juice. Meatballs were also fantastic. Definitely a must!

Warning: This recipe is bad. Who wrote it, anyway, Chef Boyardee? First, the garlic should be sauteed in some olive oil before adding the other ingredients for the sauce. Raw garlic in a tomato sauce that's cooked for only 20 minutes? Good grief. However, the meatballs are what this recipe is about, and they were even worse than the sauce. Unless you want a soggy mess, add more dry ingredients (and, yes, an egg). Here's a better idea: Hit the "back" button and find another recipe. Back to the drawing board, Epicurious.

I had some jar tomato sauce from W-S that I wanted to try so I made the meatballs only. They were very tasty. Used only beef and pork and added one egg as another reviewer suggested and the meatballs rolled together nicely. I'm sure I'll use this recipe time and time again.

This is my first time making meatballs,I was very pleased with the flavor. I added one egg at the suggestion of other reviewer. I also chilled the meatballs in the fridge an hour or so before I cooked them. They held together fine but I had to handle them gently.

My husband LOVES this dish!!

The meatballs were good though I wish they had held together just a little better during the initial frying. My 70 year Mother was looking over my shoulder while I made these and insisted that real meatballs HAVE to have at least one egg added to them to hold everything together. Though I stuck to the recipe, next time I'll follow her suggestion as she's one of these natural European cooks, whose cooked ever day of her life without recipes and makes the best dishes. The older generation has a lot of wisdom gleaned from watching their Mothers cook and years of experience in the kitchen.

Yummy! I only made the meatballs, they are so good. I took stale bread and sprinkled them with onion powder and put it in a blender to make crumbs. I also used olive oil to cook them instead of vegetable oil...These are the best I have ever made.

I doubled the meatball recipe and quadrupled the sauce (the recipes on this site are always skimpy on sauce). These were really good meatballs, though the sauce is nothing great. Needs a lot of doctoring. Will definitely make them again with my own sauce recipe.

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC recipe! Only deviations were 50/50 ground beef and ground pork, San Marzano style whole plum tomatoes and fat-free milk. My husband said it was a bit too onion-y (I chopped it in the food processor) so I will either use 3/4 onion or chop it fine for next meal. I also didn't taste the red pepper flakes so I'll use 1 tsp and add more garlic. This is an easy and delicious recipe I plan to use again and again!

After doubling the recipe, I made meatball subs with a little extra sauce and some provolone cheese. Then, I served a Ceasar Salad as a side dish. Great casual, family night meal. DELICIOUS!

Rating: 3
Very tasty with the extra zip from the pepper flakes. Would add about another 14oz of tomatoes to the sauce as others have done (increasing the spices as well). I did not find the meatballs too greasy, although I always seems to have problems keeping the balls as balls. But shape doesn't matter to my family.

This is my traditional way to make meatballs. Sometimes I add some romano or parm cheese.

I only made the meatballs and I browned them, then baked them in the oven for just a few minutes before putting them in the sauce. I think that meatballs in general are just too greasy to cook in the sauce - there was a good quarter inch of grease that baked out of them, and they were still tender and tasty. Good recipe otherwise, though. I used 1 pound of ground beef and a half pound of hot italian sausage meat, which made for a spicy meatball (even if some of the aformentioned greasiness was due to the sausage meat). Will probably add this to my staples since it was so easy and the ingredients are not unusual.

This was a great, easy recipe. I only used ground beef because that is all I had on hand. I planned to use this over spaghetti, so I added another 14.5 oz. can of tomatatoes and increased the garlic and oregano. I also added a little wine, a 1/2 teaspoon of sugar, and some mushrooms. I think this recipe would also be great for meatball sandwiches (with the recipe's amount of sauce). The meatballs were great--tender and flavorful. I might add a little black pepper next time. This is definitely a keeper. It is fast and easy to make, and I used a food processor for the onions, tomatoes, garlic, and bread crumbs. Delicious!

I just made the meatballs, not the sauce. I used ground beef only. These are the best meatballs I ever tasted. I doubled the recipe and froze them for future use.

There is no doubt in my mind.I would make this recipe again. I followed your recipe to tee. One fact, that was omitted, much more garlic...Even though, you kept saying more garlic, it needs more. It is the greatest I've ever made. Thanks. Marlo Miller Veracruz, Mexico

This was so good and very easy to prepare. Doubled the sauce as others suggested. Used the same grater for the onion and bread crumbs. Will be making again - a big hit with the kids.

Excellent dish and very easy to make. When I make this again, which I will, I am going to double the sauce recipe and add an additional 14 1/2 ounce can of diced tomatoes. There was definentaly not enough sauce for the amount of meatballs! I agree with a previous cook who stated that the onion needs to be chopped very finely! Overall, this was a great dish and even my picky 3 and 5 year old children enjoyed it!

My husband and I love true Italian food--and this is it. This is easy to make (I used crushed tomatoes, chopped the onions by hand, and no processor), but the flavor is OUTSTANDING and classic. I also subbed soy milk (SILK) for the whole milk. We froze the remainder and I'll definitely make it again. My daughter loved it, also.

Rating: 3
Delicious! I did, however, have to add about half a jar of store-bought Marinara sauce. I'd recommend finely chopping the onions, too. Otherwise, the larger pieces prevent the meatballs from sticking together. Otherwise, this recipe was great! I will definitely make again.

I used a can of crushed tomatoes and a can of whole tomatoes that I broke up with my hands to save using the food processor. I also chopped my onions very finely with a knife (same reason). We really enjoyed these meatballs!!!

A few months ago I made Giuliano Bugialli's "Meatballs in Tomato Sauce". As excited as I was to make and eat it, I was equally disappointed- the meatballs crumbled, it took awhile to make etc. Since this is not a dish I am generally inspired to make, it has been awhile until I felt the urge again. This recipe is really quite good. I grated the onion in a food processor using the grater blade.Gave it proper "oomph." I added lots of various newly dried fresh herbs to the can of diced tomatoes which I used instead of whole plum I think it was. Perhaps in future will add a little extra liquid to make it less chunky. Excellent clear flavor. Used basic, classic spaghetti. Really delish and way better than GB's. Simple to make too! BTW Only had skim so used that- worked fine. Lastly- I skipped the veal- i t was 11.99 a lb and this was just for home eatin'- not entertaining. Mixture made 12 2 inch meatballs.

Completely Yummy! I used mexican canned tomatoes and ground turkey. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing! We have a new family favorite!

I found the sauce to be delicious. As suggested, I doubled the sauce and it was the perfect amount. I used diced tomatoes and added a small amount of sugar to cut the acidity and cooked a whole hot pepper with the sauce to give it a bit of zing. Next time, I will add some spices to the meatballs as we found them to be a bit bland.

I substituted diced tomatoes, 100 % lean beef, and chilli powder. It worked very well, but next time I will put less milk to make the meatballs easier to handle. My husband (who doesn't like minced meat recipes)loved it. I served it over fusili pasta.

The sauce and the meatballs were delicious but next time I would double or even triple the sauce. The sauce was skimpy and I didn't use all the meatballs. I will definitely make this again!

soak stale bread (crust removed) in Half&Half, then squeez the liquid out of the bread. Try it you will taste the difference.
