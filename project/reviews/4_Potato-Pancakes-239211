Yes, this is the recipe for the best potato pancakes. Frying in a bit of bacon grease ups the flavor, but these are great as is.

My family absolutely loved this! The only negative was the salt - way too much! I added chives instead of the scallions and I also added garlic. Sprayed my skillet with Pam instead of using oil. Perfect!

I made this before and loved it so much that I'm making it again. The pancakes will pair nicely with homemade French onion soup.

added left over mashed potatoes to the mix - this is a favorite - easy and delicious!

This recipe makes an utterly delicious potato pancake! Beautiful in flavor and texture. Not to dense at all. I didn't use a non-stick pan (we don't keep any in the house, changed over to all stainless a few years ago) and it makes a right mess. Still can't get the oil marks off the walls of the skillet. Still, delicious recipe, and will definitely make again.

to the reviewer who grated the potatoes in the food processor, I always found that grating the potatoes by hand makes a much better potato pancake (I suppose it is the same principle as mashed potatoes, labour intensive, but so worth it). To the reviewer from Idaho, great idea, I will try the sweet version, with sweet potatoes next time

This made a great brunch for the whole family, and got rave reviews. The texture was not too dense, which I have experienced with other recipes. I also tried making it sweet, omitting the scallion, onion, parsley and pepper and adding a little brown sugar and cinnamon instead. Wow, an amazing alternative to the traditional savory potato pancake. Definitely a four fork for me!

I found these good but they needed a few alterations to become great. I added grated carrots and a few cloves of garlic. I believe anything without garlic is basically flavorless. I also only used 3 eggs.

These were really good. I ate them with some sour cream and homemade applesauce.

With all of great reviews I was prepared to be wowed with this recipe and just ...wasn't. Even with the food processor, this was a lot of work for not a lot of taste. We ended up eating them with sour cream just to get a little punch.

I was looking for new ideas to make potato pancakes and found this one most similar to the ones I grew up with. It is excellent. I did not add the flat parsely (though I think they would be great), added bacon crumbs to mine and served it with unsweetened apple sauce and no bacon with sour cream & smoked salmon. This is a keeper

Love this recipe! We shredded the potatoes with one Spanish onion in our Cuisinart. Made about 16 palm-sized potato pancakes. Delicious with sour cream and chives!

Very yummy! We made as directed, except we substituted finely chopped leeks for scallions. I prefer to make the pancakes thinner than directed - it makes it crispier!

Great base to play with. I agree little too much egg, maybe our taters are just too small:) Had an onion hating friend over so made some with chopped celery leaves instead of the onion, others with finely julienned carrots, more with fresh herbs( basil, oregano, tarragon), sweet potatoe added in nicely next time maybe some shredded pumpkin... Thank you.

Very good! Next time use less egg to fry easier.

Simple ingredients, super easy to do. (So THAT'S what that disc that came with the food processor does....) Really yummy. The scallions were great, but prob. just as good without. Used olive oil.

I grew up on several variations of potato pancakes... I made these tonight for my boyfriend who i thought had grown up on a better repertoire of fine foods. Needless to say, he was VERY pleasantly surprised! I fell in love with this particular recipe and my boyfriend and his roommates couldn't stop eating them! PS... I left out the scallions =)

I made this as part of the whole Pacific Northwest menu, it was delicious! It took longer than I expected to prepare with draining and drying the ingredients, but created perfect potato pancakes. The leftovers were fab with fried eggs for breakfast the next morning.
