Good but nothing like I expect out of 3 or 4 forks on this site. Made as written, except I didn't have seasoned rice vinegar so I used regular rice vinegar and added a touch of tobasco, but not really enough to add any zing to the final product. It was a good chopped salad with peanuts but no depth to it, and I wished I had twice as much dressing and that it had twice the flavor.

This is the best asian chicken salad I have ever had. My boyfriend loves asian salads and I usually just find them "ok," but this is one that we both agreed was excellent. We followed the recipe, but used asian peanut sauce instead of peanut butter, it gave it a little more tang. We will be making this again!

I thought this was yummy, not my husbands kind of food though. Didn't do the apples and lettuce, but flavor suits it. Quick and easy, and different from the same old healthy routine. Added a little more of the spicy oil, I think this would be a must to give it lots of flavor.
