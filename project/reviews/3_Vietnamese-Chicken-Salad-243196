The instructions for this recipe are so botched up I could not make it. They need to be re-written.

I made this as written and it was pretty good, especially on a hot day. But I wrapped the leftovers in egg roll wrappers and baked them in the oven...used a peanut sauce for dipping...just seemed more satisfying in a wrapper. I would definitely make this again that way.

I stir-fried my cabbage, bean sprout, peapod, and carrot mixture and layered it on the plate as if it were the rice. The vegetables had nice texture and crunch without extensive chomping. Building from others' distastes I marinated the chicken for a few hours and grilled it. I would definitely make this salad again.

I would definitely punt on the chicken prep. Use some already cooked. The chicken smelled terrible and didn't have much flavor so I had to doctor it. Otherwise I will make again.

Well, sorry, but... yuck. I was highly disappointed in this. You NEVER get a Vietnamese Chicken salad in a Vietnamese restaurant and have cooked veggies in it. I felt it was a waste of my time preparing the veg (which I did use, but raw) and a waste of chicken if I threw it out, so, after tasting it I added a few things. Mung bean sprouts, slivered mange tout, sliced red pepper, fresh coriander (cilantro) and sliced scallions and that helped. I'll keep looking for a GOOD Vietnamese Chicken salad, but, in my opinion, this isn't the one.

I made this recipe exactly as per the instructions. It was disappointing. Particularly, the Chicken ended up very bland once boiled even though it was juicy. Overall even though there should ave been a lot of flavor and kick to the dish, there wasn't even though the dressing was nice. Next time I would buy a pre-roasted chicken and just season with a variation of the marinade

I tried this recipe with the tips and suggestions from the previous reviewers. Even w/ the time saving tips, it still seemed 'labor-intensive' as another reviewer pointed out. Start to finish was definitely approx 1 1/2-2 hours, but worth it! I used 3/4 rotisserie chicken, 3/4 of coleslaw bag mix and 3/4 bag of broccoli/carrot slaw mix. I opted to use chili flakes instead of red chiles and i also experimented w/ different amounts of brown sugar and lime juice (i actually put too much lime juice and had to balance it w/ more sugar!). The time-consuming part was making sure everything was finely chopped because I did not have a blender handy for the dressing! Anyway, a great recipe overall, I would definitely recommend this (w/ the prior tips/suggestions). It also seems like it's easy to alternate or add different vegetables. The guests were satisfied - even one guest who absolutely hated fish sauce gave it a try and liked it! =)

I have not tried this recipe because my Vietnamese family and friends make this all the time; therefore, I don 't need the recipe . However, I've always curious whenever the recipe has something about Vietnamese food, and I have not seen an authentic recipe yet! This recipe is not authentic - Vietnamese Chicken Salad never have cooked, but raw vegetables. Only regular granulated white sugar not brown sugar is used in the sause.

The cook from Vancouver inspired me to try my own weeknight version of this recipe -- mine stayed closer to the original recipe, but is still cheating and should be treated as such. ;) I bought a prepared rotisserie chicken (expensive, but at my house we can get three meals out of one of those suckers), shredded some of the meat into a bowl, and marinated it in the marinade from the recipe (I halved the garlic and ginger, figuring that it might be overkill with the dressing). Proceeded as directed using bagged coleslaw mix (great idea), supplemented with the mint and basil, more carrots, cucumber and some shredded daikon that I had lying around. Tossed, garnished and dressed as directed. Someday I want to try the fancy-dress version, but my version was just right for a hot weekday evening. Great flavors in this recipe, no matter how you put it together.

For nursebriggs or anyone else who is busy : I love this salad but it is quite labour intensive. Here's the quick & dirty version: I toss a couple of chicken breasts in to poach or roast while I am doing the dishes or getting ready for work and then I stick them in the fridge to cool. When I'm ready to make the salad I just shred them into a large bowl and add a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix (cabbage and carrot), a sliced red pepper, a couple of minced green onions, a cup or so of diced cucumber, a handful of chopped mint and another couple of handfuls of chopped cilantro. If I'm feeling really industrious I will quickly blanch a package of snow peas and toss them in. If I'm in a dead hurry I snip the herbs in with scissors :) As for dressing: I buy a good Asian-style dressing (like Renee's Asian Sesame) and spike it with some lime juice and add a couple of dashes of chili oil or a bit of sambal to give it a kick (completely optional). Just toss this with the chicken and veg. This salad keeps great in the fridge overnight (it always tastes better the next day) and you can even substitute a can of good tuna for the chicken in a pinch for a great lunch. I also sprinkle in toasted sesame seeds if I've got them. I love this salad and have made a version of the one in the recipe before but I just don't always have time. Trust me: This "Express" version is just as good.

I think this is the kind of recipe I'll get better at over time. My first try, with 2 children in the kitchen, seemed a bit labor intensive. None the less - it has a great cruch, sweet, kick all at the same time - and I will make again. AND, the chicken, prior to the dressing, could be fed to children - not too spicy.

Easy to make, colorful, flavorful, most excellent.
