This was a good recipe. It is easy to make and very flavorful. Definitely serve it with some bread or pita to soak up the extra sauce. I didn't use 1/4 of oil because that is unnecessary and fattening. I also used one purple onion and white wine instead of red (because I didn't have any. It was delicious. I will make it again. It is easy to prep all the materials and then throw it together at the last minute.

Made this for my gourmet club -- total hit! I have never made squid before and this was super easy and tasty. I added a couple cloves of garlic and put it over polenta (I'm gluten free, but my friends told me it was delicious with bread). I made it with canned crushed tomatoes, which was a bit of a problem because it made it soupy, but it was good either way. Can't wait to have the leftovers over some GF pasta for lunch today!

YUM! Delicious, fast, and easy. Great with a crusty bread. And if you're watching your calories - you can't beat this one.

Well, if I had written this review the first two or three times I made this dish, I would have given it 3 forks. But tonight, I made it again and it had no taste at all! I don't get it ... was it the wine I used, the freshness of the squid? Who knows, but it literally had NO taste and yet the other times we've had it, it was delicious. But, I'm never going to make it again as I have no idea why this happened.

This was quite delicious. We used it as a sauce on al dente rigatoni and served it with roasted potatoes and sauteed brussels sprouts.

A flavorful preparation for squid. A great recipe that avoids overcooking squid (so easy to do) and infuses great flavoring. Added some minced garlic approx. 3/4 way through cooking, and made sure to cook down the wine, so it took a little longer than 5 minutes; otherwise, the sauce would have been too watery. Served in an oversized ramekin along with a Moorish-style salad, and some freshly prepared hummus. Great lunch to power through my afternoon work!

I have to strongly disagree with the last two reviewers. Is it possible they used dried spices or frozen squid? This was incredibly delicious and easy to make. I served it over baby potatoes. Yum!

I agree with the previous reviewer. This dish wasn't flavorful at all. I tried adding more basil and red pepper, but it still ended up tasting like fishy red wine. It was edible, but not necessarily enjoyable.

The other reviewers seemed to love this recipe, so perhaps it was a mistake on my part but...while it was edible, it certainly wasn't nearly as exciting or tasty as many of the other squid recipes on the site.

while I dont usually advocate reviewing a recipe unless one adheres very closely to whats written, I have to on this one. I didnt have 3 cups of onions (used one)or a full pound of tomatoes (had three romas), so i estimated the ratio on the other ingredients, as I was looking for an appetizer squid to serve with crusty bread. It was unbelievably good. I was concerned about cooking the squid for a total of six minutes, because it is known that if it is cooked too long, it becomes rubbery. No worries necessary here. If you like squid or calamari, this is a wonderful approach with room to improvise.

I would not call myself a cook but I am Italian and as such I love Italian food. This recipe came out excellent with the exception that as I was simmering I noticed that there wasn't enough squid in the skillet so by the time I was done I had triple the ingredients except for the squid. I used 5 pounds. Loved it.
