This is a follow up to my previous comment about adding additional flour.... This bread turned out DELICIOUS and received rave reviews from everyone! (I'm wondering if the fifth egg is actually meant to brush the top of the loaf before baking, and the recipe just wasn't clear?).

FYI - forgot to mention that I, too, had to add almost an extra cup of flour...came out moist and delicious!

I tried this bread for the holiday and got rave reviews - both at home and at schul. The only change I made was to make two long tubes which I then formed into a round loaf. (Came out the size of a toddler, so will probably make two loaves next time!) It was moist, delicious and light...can't wait to toast for breakfast in the morning!

To julesymd - just finished kneading, and yes, the dough was very sticky and I had to add almost another cup of flour! It's rising right now and hope it turns out as good as yours!

Made this recipe last night and have already eaten half of one of the loaves! Delicious :) Question for those that have made it, was the dough very sticky and wet? It seems that I must have added at least another 1/2C flour of more to be able to handle the dough. It turned out great regardless. Healthy and happy New Year!

Happy & Healthy...the point here is to try the recipe and review it. I really don't care about the shape of the bread and why it should be that way. You shouldn't even be giving it one fork since you haven't tried the recipe. It's a great recipe.

I have to believe the reviewers who seem to have actually made this recipe already, but 2 T. of yeast? I know it is a rich dough, but really, two TABLESPOONS for 2 loaves? I've made a lot of bread and I have never used that much yeast, ever.

This sounds delicious! For Rosh Hashanah, the loaves should be braided into a circle. And served with honey.

The recipe works. If you want the loaf to be round, shape it that way. Its the recipe not the shape that matters here. Wonderful flavor, super moist...Great addition to my recipe collection. note: Makes great french toast!!!

Happyandhealthy, if you don't like the shape, CHANGE IT! It doesn't effect the taste which is what you should be rating this recipe on! And who is to say that you can't make this challah any time or for any holiday! Therefore the shape wouldn't matter!! Rate the recipe on taste next time. BTW, its delish!

hey happy and healthy, make the bread first in the round shape you want and THEN comment on both the recipe and the instructions....that's what's called common sense!

I haven't tried this recipe, though it looks interesting. What the author fails to realize is that challah for Rosh Hashanah is round, not braided. It is symbolic of the cycle of the year and this is the only time all year when we have the opportunity to bake round loaves ... either turban style or with a unique braiding pattern akin to basket weaving. I am not a purist in all matters, but not having round challah for Rosh Hashanah would be like eating french fries instead of potato latkes for Hanukkah.
