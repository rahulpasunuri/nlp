sweet and delicious. Great on salads too.

I completely spaced when I was making this, so I just mixed all the ingredients together and poured the resulting "dressing" over the duck salad. It was still delicious and complemented it perfectly.

I upped the salt to a whole teaspoon, the pepper flakes to a whole teaspoon, and reduced the vinegar to 1/3 cup. I used seasoned vinegar and it turned out perfect. I didn't use this as a dipping sauce, but rather a marinade for thinly sliced cucumbers. This cucumber salad was fantastic and several friends have asked for the recipe. Serve with a thai dish like chicken satay.
