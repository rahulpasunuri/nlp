Loved thi!! Made a couple of changes- for instance, could not find, nor did I want to spend the kids' inheritance, on the Manchego cheese, so I just used asiago. Parmesan would probably work as well. I also used my mini Cuisinart to process the garlic to a paste, and part of the roasted pepper, then proceeded as the recipe instructed for the rest. I am not a hot dog eater, but this stuff sure made them agreeable. I will use this for other purposes in the future- tonight eyeing up the leftovers for a spread on some Italian bread.

This good topping seems more appropriate for bruschetta than hot dogs.

This recipe was awesome. If you have leftovers, make sure to let the relish come back to room temp. I think it's better that way. Oh, in response to a previous review, I agree that it wasn't "tangy" enough at first, but I just added a bit more sherry vinegar and it was perfect. I'll definitely be making this again, and I have big plans for this relish : )

The relish was a big hit at a recent cookout. I've found that the relish itself can be used in a variety of different meals. Will need to grow own garlic next season though, as it requires a good amount.

Was good, but I'm used to having some form of mustard on my dogs. So it lacked that tangy kick.

Yes, let's put $14/pound imported Spanish cheese on hot dogs! Actually, this was pretty good.
