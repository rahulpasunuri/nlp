My family really likes this recipe with some changes. I substituted olive oil for the butter, used brown rice instead of white (increased cooking time), and substituted chicken, beef or vegetable broth for the water.

Nothing to rave about. I substituted veggie stock for the water, and punched up the appearance w/ green onions, but it was still boring, boring, boring.

Great rice dish. I used vidalia onion, part wild rice, and added some sliced green onion tops at the end for color (a little parsley too). Also, I only used 1/2 tsp. of salt (1 tsp just seemed like a lot for such a little recipe) and that was plenty.

This was a great weeknight side dish. I used the same amount of liquid in the recipe, but used half water and half chicken stock to add more flavor.

I make this without the rice and my husband loves it. I cook the onions a little bit longer than the corn and it's really an interesting flavor.
