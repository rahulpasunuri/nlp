Very tasty risotto! I love beets and so was excited to find a recipe that isn't too time intensive but still gets the wonderful flavor. The only thing I would change next time is substituting some of the goat cheese, which I really love, for some parmesan. With the beets and the goat cheese, I thought this was a little on the sweet side and maybe a third parmesan would help to balance that out.

I improvised with what I had on hand and found that it was a bit bland, minus the goat cheese. It was super easy as a base recipe I'd fiddle with, but the flavors were a bit boring to my tastes. I added some red wine (prob. 1/4 cup) and because I didn't have mustard greens on hands, I used beet greens & swiss chard, adding it to the mixture about halfway through its simmering. Maybe next time I'll just do as I'm told, rather than improvise...

After listening to my sister rave about this recipe for ages, I finally made it myself. It is terrific. It seems so simple, but tastes wonderful.

I LOVE this recipe. I would make it all the time if my husband liked goat cheese! The beets give the risotto a beautiful red color. Don't sub anything--the combination of the sweet risotto, creamy cheese and sharp mustard greens are what gives this dish its zing.

This was very tasty, not difficult to make and it looks like Christmas!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe and have added to my own personal cookbook. My sister isn't that crazy about beets, but requests this dish at every family gathering. I have used shaved parmesan instead of the goat cheese and it is just as good.

I found it strange to have a risotto recipe made by boiling the rice with the liquid. I added some Cabernet to the rice before I stirred in the stock one cup at a time. I topped the risotto with chopped baby spinach and the goat cheese to solve the "uncooked mustard greens" issue.

I added about 4 cloves of garlic to the beets & onions. It seemed much more economical to use the leftover beet greens rather than mustard greens; they add a nice color and crisp texture. Beautiful to look at, tasty, and most importantly, easy!

I took the advice from the Washington, DC cook who used arugula instead of mustard greens. (Our CSA gave us lots of arugula, lots of beets, and no mustard greens this week.) My beets were variegated pink and white, and they looked a lot like salmon sushi; consequently the risotto didn't have that magenta color that others had, but it was still very pretty. And it's axiomatic that balsamic vinegar + butter = good, so this whole thing was delicious. By the way, for those wondering about the mustard greens, yes, they're meant to be uncooked, just as the Brazilians use shredded uncooked collards in their cuisine.

I have made this recipe numerous times to rave reviews. One change that I made however is that instead of the mustard greens I use fresh arugala sprinkled on top. The bitter taste is a great compliment to the sweet beets!

Absolutely delicious. I am a huge fan of mustard greens and this was a great new way to use them. The major change I made to this recipe was that I put the entire block of goat cheese in the pot at the end of cooking, to melt and incorporate it fully into the risotto. This made the dish so cheesy, creamy and rich. I think I will be making this again and again.

I thought this was very tasty. I didn't have greens. I added some Dijon mustard, as one of the other reviewers suggested, and I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon. Goat cheese definitely has more of a kick than Parmesan, so I used it, and it was really good.

I have to agree with the reviewer who pointed out that there's no info on cooking the greens. I also can't figure out why they didn't just call for beet greens. All in all, the editors dropped the ball with this recipe. That said, I sliced the beet greens thinly and stirred them in at the end so they'd cook quickly. This dish is gorgeous and I'd serve it to guests. But the flavor lacked something. I added a little red wine vinegar to my bowl to sharpen the taste. White wine might help next time. I'll make beet risotto again for sure.... but I'll find a better recipe.

This was better than I expected, and a great way to use up beets & greens which are showing up in the CSA box often these days. We stirred in some dry jack cheese (like a parmesan) to add richness. It came out a pretty dark pink and with the greens, looked kind of Christmasy.

I am giving this recipe one fork because I am not sure (given the review comments) that the recipe is complete! Are we supposed to cook the greens? If so, how? It is not mentioned in the recipe. It seems to me that the recipe calls for raw greens. Chopped. No mention of cooking. Really. Bon Appetit? They are slipping.

I used golden beets instead of red, and parmesan instead of goat cheese. Lots of strong flavors in this dish, but they all held up well - very tasty. And the smell of it cooking was incredible! I did end up with way too much cheese and some extra greens. Maybe I just didn't use enough, but I wanted to taste the risotto too.

I also used the beet greens rather than mustard. A less-slippery way to serve beets (i.e., less hazardous to clothes than sliced). Used baby beets with a slightly milder flavor.

A surprising amount of flavour for such a simple recipe! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, but using parmesan rather than the goats cheese. I had roasted some baby beets previously, so just sliced and threw in with the onions in the beginning instead of fresh ones. I've never cooked with mustard greens, but they gave this a a real kick, without bitterness. I think this would be a good dish for entertaining, it's easy yet impressive looking.

I had this made for me at a dinner party, it was so good I asked for the recipe to recreate. I must say it is very easy and quite quick to prepare! I added 1/2 cup of wine in place of some of the water, and I stirred in the beet tops and goats cheese a few minutes pefore serving. So colourful, so fragrant and great! Would make a great Christmas dish!

fantastic flavors - I added some garlic (!) and thyme to the onions and roasted the beet cubes separately and arranged them around the risotto with the goat cheese. topped with chicken and parm. Got an idea from the prev reviewer and stirred in a tbs of dijon and it really took this over the top. fyi, didn't have greens and didn't miss them at all.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to make it again. Like the previous reviewer, I made a couple of changes. I used beet greens instead of mustard greens, and I used the shaved parmesan suggested in the recipe instead of goat cheese. My fiance and I (who insists he hates beets, but loved the dish) had it as a main, and while it was fairly rich, it worked perfectly as a comfort food. I also loved that the dish was bright pink.

Wow. This one is really special. I made a couple of changes. I used the traditional risotto cooking method, where the stock is heated and added gradually -- I guess I'm superstitious about this stuff. I also used the beet greens instead of mustard greens, and added a cove of garlic with the onions. The result was fabulous -- I'd bet you could even get people who hate beets to eat it, and I'm going to try!

The beets really add a unique flavor (and color, of course) to the risotto. Like the previous reviewer, I added about a half cup of wine and added the broth slowly. I also recommend toasting the rice a little before adding the liquid and heating the broth beforehand. I added about a cup and a half of parmesan reggiano and I used the beet greens at the end instead of mustard greens.

I wasn't put off by the color at all, but my girlfriend was! I thought it was pretty bold and wonderful. Great different dish with strong (good) taste. I added the greens right at the end of cooking, to give them a slight wilt. Of course, add broth a little at a time to avoid shocking the rice! I also added about 1/2 cup of white wine to give it an extra boost.

Certainly shocking in the aesthetic department - maybe good for Christmas?? However, what a wonderful, cozy, creamy dish! My husband is not fond of beets at all and absolutely loves this dish.

this was very good, and i actually very cool looking, i thought. i subbed leeks for onions because they needed to be used, and doubled the recipe but only used 5 c. of broth, which was plenty. i'm still cracking up about the woman who subbed mustard for mustard greens  riiiiight.

I made it with spinach just thrown in at the end as I had no mustard greens. I wouldn't omit the greens as it adds a good contrast color. I used Parmesan with fine results.

Great easy recipe. I second the garlic comments. I've also made it with parmesean instead of goat cheese, which I think tastes even better.

This is a great dish. As noted by another reviewer, garlic should be used. I also used golden beets, which makes for a very appetizing golden-colored risotto.

This is a funny looking (fuschia) dish, but delicious--even my 3 year old likes it. The goat cheese is a must. Because of its appearance, I probably wouldn't serve it to company, but it's a great staple to keep around the house.

this recipe doesn't say when to add the mustard greens and goat cheese. It is assumed that is would be at the end of the cooking, but it should specify.

Great dish, everyone loved it! However despite checking out several stores including I couldn't locate the mustard greens... instead I just added about a teaspoon of dijon mustard and that seemed to work well.

This recipe was pretty good. I added some garlic (a glaring omission!), 2 cloves per cup of risotto. I also added some grilled sliced chicken with a balsamic reduction on top, it made it more of a main course.
