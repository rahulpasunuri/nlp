The dough was perfect! It was flakey and tasty and the perfect size. I used blackberries and raspberries because I thought it would be pretty. It was delicious!

These tasted just like the Jam tarts when we were kids...so delish! I didnt use the fresh fruit, the jam and the pastry make them wonderful all by themselves. I used a mini muffin pan to make lots of little tarts....bite size. Which I think tastes better than the larger sizes. Perfectly yummy, elegantly simple, and very inexpensive! I cant wait to make them again!

I cheated and used frozen pastry tarts b/c of lack of time. I will try the pastry when I have more time, but used the filling recipe. It was a hit!

A lovely summer dessert. The fresh raspberries at the store were really expensive, so I used frozen (thawed). I mixed the heated jam and lemon juice with the drained berries, then refrigerated the mix before adding to the crust -- I used one large tart pan. Everybody loved it.

Perfect! Not only perfectly delicious, but perfectly elegant in appearance, and simple, too!

My guests at the bed and breakfast just loved and raved about this treat. Thanks for a great receipt I know I will make them again!
