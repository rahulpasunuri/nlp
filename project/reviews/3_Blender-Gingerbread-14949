I must admit how surprised I was about this recipe! The blender-aspect led me to have doubts, but the gingerbread turned out moist and very flavorful! For an extra kick, I add 1/2 tsp of Penzeys Spices signature Cake Spice and served it topped with whipped cream.

My fiancee and I try to use as little butter as possible, and were told that it is possible to use applesauce in place of it in baking. I did that, using the same amount as was called for butter. I found the cooking time needed was almost double, and the only thing I can think of is because of the applesauce. It still came out tasting wonderful and the extra time didn't hurt at all. I would make it just the same again, but perhaps in a larger pan to spread the mixture out thinner, which may shorten the baking time.
