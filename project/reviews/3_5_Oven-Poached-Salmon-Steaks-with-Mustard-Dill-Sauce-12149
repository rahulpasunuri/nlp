Reliable, easy recipe. I prefer to use balsamic vinegar with the dill sauce. Ground coriander works fine as a substitute, but the dill has to be fresh.

Found the sauce pretty bland. We all liked it okay, but there are better spice combinations for poaching.

I have made this dish for company many times. I use fillets instead of "steaks". Everyone always loves it. If you are nervous about serving a dinner party, you can make it the day before and know ahead of time whether it is successfully cooked, saving you last minute anxiety! (Then there is the added benefit of having the extra day to rid your house of the fish smell) The mustard sauce is a little harsh, a problem I solved by adding some of the wine--I used Pinot Grigio.

This was bland and the mustard dill sauce was too "mustardy". I was disappointed.

The poached salmon was exquisite! My family loved the sauce; I liked it well enough. This recipe is terrific just as it is.

I just rediscovered this recipe after several years. It's great,easy and delicious. For some reason my fish store was out of salmon steaks this week, but the recipe worked fine with fillets. The sauce was terrific too. Only one drawback, my seven year old son and his best friend gobbled up the leftovers I was counting on enjoying until tomorrow. Next time I'll have to make extra.

Really enjoyed this - did not have coriander but it was still good and easy to make.
