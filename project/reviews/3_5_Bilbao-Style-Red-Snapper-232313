Caught a 2+lb yellowtail snapper yesterday and was looking for a way to cook it whole. Enjoyed this recipe, but no reason you could not do with skin on fillets. I used non-stick baking sheet (instead of baking pan) heated first in 425+ degree oven. Use wads of aluminum foil to stabilize head and tail. Listen for sizzle when laying and pressing fish skin side down onto hot baking sheet to get crispier skin. Used sherry vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and cut back to 2T vinegar to 1/4 cup EVOO. (mixture did not splatter when heated in small saucepan.) Skin on fillets would work too, be much easier to handle and more would fit on pan. Very good flavors.

Felt like I was in Spain again. Very Catalan - oily, garlicky. Snapper was problematic - so bony. I liked it but my family wasn't a fan.

Wonderful and super quick. If you use whole snapper, it's pretty bony but worth the messy eating. I have some truffle infused oil that made this extra special.

Served this on a huge platter over spinach sauteed with a tiny bit of olive oil, lemon, and garlic. Also on the platter was Spanish Potato Salad from allrecipes.com. It was a great presentation, and delicious! Guests raved!

A bony, greasy disaster. Never again.

WOW! This was fast easy and delicious. My kids devoured it, which is really a feat with fish. I served it over wilted spinach, but everybody wanted more sauce.

I made this plate using my favorite fish, Tilapia, it was one of the best fish I've ever tried and everybody loved it, asked for the recipe and congratulated me for this delicious food.

You can't really lose with this simple recipe: it's so quick and easy. Needless to say, the fish should be fresh and use good quality oil & vinegar and this will satisfy.

I didn't have the snapper, I used tilapia instead and everybody loved it. My friends asked me for the recipe.
