These cupcakes are tasty, although on the smaller side. I doubled the recipe and came out with only 18 cupcakes. I used dark chocolate chips, instead of butterscotch, and was pleased with the result!

The cupcakes turned out beautifully and didn't even cave. I added an extra tablespoon of flour because I live at high altitude and it seemed to work well. I will most definitely use this recipe again.

The cupcakes are much lighter than I expected, but they were pretty tasty. I did add vanilla to the recipe after I made the first batch and that made the texture more consistent and gave it a richer taste. Overall, I would make these again in a pinch, but this is not my favorite recipe.

I used strong coffee in place of the hot water to dissolve the cocoa and added 1 cup of melted bittersweet chocolate to this recipe. It was delicious and very moist. I omitted the icing and served it with mixed berries and vanilla ice cream.

Were very hard and not sugary enough! Better cupcake recipes out there.

I found the cupcakes to be great.They went very quickly at our fourth of July party. I added red and blue food coloring to the icing to make them very patriotic.

This is a quick and simple cupcake recipe if you are in a hurry. If I do make it again, I would double the recipe, since I only got about 6 cupcakes out of this.

This was pretty disappointing. The flavor was pretty bland, but the texture was OK. There are definitely better recipes out there.

Don't bother - I wanted to use some left-over butterscotch chips for this. Very disappointing. The cupcakes were dry, chalky and flavorless; not rich and moist as cake should be (I don't like to use cocoa for this very reason). I even added vanilla in case it lacked flavor, and that didn't even help. Plus, using 3 bowls for this was a bit to laborious. Furthermore, the so-called icing was like a sauce. The tates don't mesh and a store bought mix and icing would have been better!
