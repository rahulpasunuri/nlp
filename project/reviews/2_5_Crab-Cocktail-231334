Excellent recipe- I agree on the blandness- I find that adding twice as much wasabi paste (try Pensky Spices for wasabi powder and make your own paste!) and used 1/8 teaspoon of sesame oil. Also, prepare ahead about an hour to 3 hours at most to serve in order to allow the "cocktail" sauce to really blend well with the crab- and use the HIGHEST QUALITY you can find! I made this for Christmas and my anniversary and still have everyone raving.

This was so much more bland than the ingredients would lead you to believe. I quadrupled everything, except the mayo, and it was still just marginal.
