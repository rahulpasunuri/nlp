I discovered this recipe in the Sept 1996 issue, however had't made them since.I thought I would see if they are on this site. Sure enough!! Now I have an extra copy just in case. I have scribbled that it would be best to double the recipe next time. Going through my scrapbook, it's time to make these again. Yes, they are not cake like and awesome.

I really liked this recipe. I didn't have wax paper, so I just greased and floured the pan. The brownies came out just fine anyways. I took the advice to double the recipe and cut the sugar. The only thing I would suggest would be to sift the dry ingredients (flour, salt, etc..). Other than that, this is a great, fast recipe that I will be sure to keep on hand.

I followed the recommendations to double the recipe, and I used 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe called for - definitely both good ideas. Great brownies, just use high quality chocolate and you're set!

Fantastic! So easy and so good! I doubled the recipe as suggested and decreased the sugar a bit--added powdered sugar on top. Much easier than Joy of Cooking's recipe and just as good, maybe even better.

These brownies were simple to prepare, but way too sweet and not all that chocolatey. I bet if I left out a 1/4 c. of sugar, they might have tasted better.

These brownies are wonderfully nutty and have just the right amount of chocolate. I did find them a bit greasy (did anyone else's have slightly "deep-fried" edges?!) so I tried them again with 3 tb butter and 1 tb milk and they were perfect.

Great recipe! Having read the reviews, I doubled the recipe, but it took the brownies about 1:15 to bake. Because the brownies were difficult to cut when warm, I waited until the next day. I forgot about the wax paper, however, which by the next day was permanently adhered to the bottom of the brownies. I won't make that mistake again.

Far too easy and simple to taste this good. I doubled the recipe after hearing how thin they were -- I'd say double makes the perfect thickness. I had to bake them for an hour (at 300) and all turned out well. I've been trying to find the perfect original brownie recipe and I think I'll stick with this one.

These brownies are so yummy! Wonderfully chocolaty and moist and chewy. A snap to make and look so pretty dusted with confectioners sugar.

Coming from somebody who is probably the world's worst baker these turned out perfect! I definitely recommend doubling the recipe. I used a six muffin tin, that's it and it made 6 good size brownies so I can imagine how thin they would have been had I used what the recipe said. Very easy and delicious.

Excellent brownie to serve with icecream. Thin, rich, chewy. Quick/easy to make and makes a small enough quantity that you don't need to have lots of chocolate/butter on hand and you don't find yourself eating brownies for days. In other words, it's a good "impulse" brownie. I was skeptical of the 300 degree oven, but time and temperature worked perfectly for me.

I also found these brownies to be very thin, but chewy. I think next time I will double the recipe for a thicker brownie, and perhaps back them longer.

Unless you make the Joy of Cooking's brownies, these are the best and easiest of all. And yummy, too. Not as thick as J of C and not as choclatey--different but great. I use pecans, too.

I agree with the cook who said this came out very thin but was indeed chewy. This most approximates the Duncan Hines Delux Brownies, but are about half as thick. Next time I'll double the recipe and cook longer to see if I can recreated my favorite brownies that aren't available here. For true chocoholic bliss, try warm w/vanilla Hagen Daas and Old Fashioned Fudge Sauce.

These were as the recipe says, rich. Really quick and easy to make and tasted pretty good. Would make this recipe again.

I've been using this recipe since the '40s, when I got it in Home Ec class at junior high. It's also been published as "Brownies Hepburn." If you like fudgy brownies, this can't be beat, both for taste and for ease of preparation. Try to use a pan with rounded bottom edges for melting the butter and chocolate; it makes it much easier to incorporate the other ingredients.

These were the the thinnest brownies ever, and I guess "chewy" is subjective. I cooked them for 27 min. Ends test done chewy for me, center was on the fudgyside not truly fudgey, but not completely chewy. I guess I should have kept in for 30min,but I was afraid ends would be too try.Also, not very chocolately/sweet.

We don't have completely unsweetened chocolate in Australia, so I found it too sweet with that much sugar. Next time I make it, I may only use a 1/2 cup of sugar. Chewy is definitely good though.

When I tried these brownies, I have to say, I was a bit suspicious. I was afraid that they'd turn out nasty, but instead, they were delicious! (Yummy in my tummy! 8 P)

This was probably the most delicious brownie I've ever made. Excellent warmed and served with ice cream.

Simple recipe, makes an incredibly rich, fudgy brownie. I doubled the recipe and used a 9-inch round cake pan because I didn't have the 8-inch square pan. This isn't for people who prefer the cake-like brownies, though.

Whenever I need to satisfy a chocolate craving, and I'm too lazy to go to the market downstairs and buy a candy bar, I make these brownies. They are extremely easy to make, I usually just melt the chocolate in a 1 quart saucepan and then just mix the dry ingredients into the same pot. Clean up is a snap. The one thing that you have to watch is the timing, I've pulled them out too soon and have been left with a batter-filled center.

The best brownie recipe (if you like chewy brownies; if you only like "cake-like" brownies, this one is not for you)! It is the only recipe I use and I've had it for years. The one adjustment I make is to substitute pecans in for the walnuts. Delicious!
