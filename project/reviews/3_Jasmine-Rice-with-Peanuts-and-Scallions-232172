This is useful when you want a side dish for something that is highly spiced or heavily flavored but you don't want to serve "just plain" rice. We like it.

The recipe, as written, is fine and well worth cooking. However, if you add 2/3 cup of toasted coconut and the juice of 1/2 a large lime, I PROMISE that your guests will love it even more. I served my version with a ginger-crusted salmon and braised baby bok choy one evening and now my guests think I'm a star.

I substitute macadamia nuts for the peanuts. I love jasmine rice and this is very tasty.
