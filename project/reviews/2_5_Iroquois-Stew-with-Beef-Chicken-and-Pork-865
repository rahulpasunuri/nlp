I added double the potatoes, celery, 3 or 4 sprigs each of rosemary and thyme, added chicken gravy (already made) and my turkey broth (because I had no chicken) and lots of pepper for a little kick into my 5 quart slow cooker and it smells wonderful!! I'll have to let you know how it turns out!!! Cheers all!

Yes, kid friendly - aka totally bland! The idea of mixing different meats seemed good. I made it from some relatives from overseas (trying to do a Canadian meal without giving them salmon and maple syrup yet again); but it tasted more like English cooking than Canadian! (ps I'm from the UK, so don't get all offended. You know what I mean!)

Not too exciting...all the meat tastes the same anyway so why go through all the bother? The saving grace is the taste is kid friendly.

I had difficulty finding one pouud roasts, but could find two pounders, so doubled the recipe. It worked well and was excellent, with lots for leftovers and to freeze. We liked it a little thicker, so added a bit of cornstarch mixed with water. Probably not a "company" meal, but a great family dinner.

Yummy! Great comfort food. I didn't have any ground allspice, so I smashed 6 allspice berries and used them instead. I was worried that the allspice would be too strong a flavor, but it is extremely subtle. This dish is definitely better the next day (as are most stews), and it reheats beautifully. I added more potatoes and carrots, just because I like more veggies in my stew. The recipe is a bit labor intensive, but not if you cook it in stages (which is what I did). I sauteed the meat, then later I did the chicken. The next day I put it all together. Personally, I don't think this a good dish to serve over rice or even potatoes. Serve with either bread or maybe tortillas. It really is a one-dish meal. Everyone loved it!!!
