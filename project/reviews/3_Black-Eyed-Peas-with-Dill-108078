I've made this on a regular basis and enjoy the fact it's #1 easy #2 TASTY #3 getting more fiber into our diets! It's good with or w/o feta, sometimes I add grape tomatoes, either way, it's very good!

My god, this isn't Greek cooking - this is "slop"- you will never, ever see black eyed peas served like this in any Greek home anywhere! They are so delicious prepared the Greek way and have absolutely nothing to do with what you present here. And, just because you add Feta to something does not make it Greek - Epicurious, how about offering some REAL Greek recipes -

If anyone found this bland, maybe it was because it needs more salt. I followed the recipe exactly,using a 16 oz.pkg.of black-eyed peas, and tasted for seasoning halfway through the cooking. Very bland. Added another 1/2 tsp. salt,and it brought out the fresh flavors of the simple ingredients. Served it with Barba Yianni's grilled lamb from this site. Do try this with the adjusted salt.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish while traveling in the Greek Islands. Sophisticated it is not, but if you enjoy simple but fresh flavors, this dish is for you. For a quicker version, substitute canned blackeyed peas, omit the boilng and just toss together. Add a little lemon juice and your done!
