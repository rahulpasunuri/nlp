Filling did not set up, despite reducing the water to only 1/4 cup and using 2/3 cup of sugar. If you like a fruit soup, with a little pie crust, give this a try. It is delicious, but I'm glad I didn't make it for company! FWIW, I used a mixture of blueberries, strawberries, peaches and pears.

Absolutely perfect for dorm cooking- few ingredients to buy, only one pan required, and SO delicious!

This was disappointing after reading all the review and looking at the rating. I used fresh strawberries and blueberry. May be the small tart shell I used was substandard. May try again with a different crust but not anytime soon.

The flavor was quite nice but my glaze was 'cloudy'. I read through many of the reviews and cut down the water/sugar/cornstarch per the suggestions as my peaches were pretty ripe and I didn't want the pie to be runny. Should the fruit for the glaze be pureed vs. smashed? Perhaps my cornstarch ration was off.

I made it with splenda and used 1/4 cup of water and NO butter!!!! My husband (who turns his nose up to anything "diet") loved it. I used 2 tablespoons of corn starch and used a bit more fresh fruit. We topped it with Cool Whip and it turned into a healthy summertime dessert.

I have made this pie several times and it is always a hit, even when it doesn't set up properly. Fresh fruit is the key, and I reduced the amount of water and sugar.

I made this pie for a small dinner party this past weekend. It was so easy and good! I used early blueberries and nectarines from the farmer's market and added a little grated fresh ginger. It was delicious! I also reduced the amount of sugar and lemon juice (just eyeballed it). I'm glad I didn't add more of either one--it would have overpowered the fruit flavors. I'll definitely make this recipe again.

Best easy pie ever!!! I followed some reviewer's directions and used 1/4 cup water and a little less sugar. I used a combo of pears, peaches, and strawberries for my pie...it was delicious. Had some friends over and each one asked for the recipe. Now that is proof it's a good pie!

FANTASTIC! I made mine with a jar of lemon curd under the fruit and used mostly blueberries and some strawberries. I served it at a dinner party and my guests just raved. My husband joked about taking his piece into the bedroom, lowering the lights and putting on some Barry White in order to spend some quality time... I highly recommend this and don't forget the lemon curd!

This is a great recipe - tremendously easy to make, and as other people suggested, you can be as creative as you want with it. People are also right that this is not something that would get you a Michelin award, but hey - you can't have it both ways when it's so gosh-darn easy to make. But yes - the quality of the crust makes a huge difference. But remember to follow the suggestions of cutting back the sugar and the water. My pie got a little bit too sweet because the fruit I had was already sweet, and the filling didn't set even after chilling overnight. Will make this again with just less water and sugar.

I don't usually write reviews, but I HAD to review this recipe. With a few tweaks, this recipe is far from "pedestrian" (who uses that term anymore, anyway?). It's true, you have to use 1/4 cup of water, DEPENDING ON WHAT FRUIT YOU USE. Less fruit juice = More water needed. Also, if you use any kind of berry, adding 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom is AMAZING mixed in at end of the mixing process. Enjoy!

I made this with blueberries and strawberries; followed suggestions and cut water to about 1/4 cup and had no trouble with thickening in the 7-10 minutes directed; also left out the butter and used less sugar than directed. Spooned just the mash into the pie and saved the fresh fruit to decorate the top. Served slices on plates decorated with a little choclate sauce. Major hit with everyone. Choclate sauce was nice but not needed and I can imagine other fruit combos being just as delicious. I might try a little lemon curd on the bottom or on the side too, especially with blueberries, strawberries and/or raspberries.

This turned out wonderfully -- my kids all asked for seconds and my inlaws raved about it. I used a variety of fruits I happened to have on hand -- one plum, a dozen strawberries, two peaches, a couple of pears and even a handful of grapes (which I will leave out next time). I made a pate brisee for the crust but otherwise followed the recipe precisely. It's a simple and tasty dessert that lends itself to numerous varieties.

Fabulous!!! I used the mix of strawberries and blueberris as suggested by the other reviewer and it was awesome. I had make it for a coworkers birthday and it got rave reviews from all. Instead of using a regular crust, I bought a pre-made grahm cracker crust and it was great. Also instead of mixing the strawberrie and blueberries in with the mash, I poured the mash into the crust and cut the strawberries length wise and used the fresh fruit to create a starburst patter just to make it look more visually appealing. Will definately make again. Also it can be make and put into individual ramikins instead of a crust for friends on lower carb diets.

hmm from the reviewers' comments about using this as vegeterian gelatin I'm going to guess that I didn't use enough cornstarch for my very juicy peaches as I got nothing near a gelatinous consistency. I also tried the oatmeal crust refered to in reviews below. It was delicious out of the oven but became soggy once filled, no doubt due to my runny filling. Whole thing was still quite edible just sort of like a peach crisp upside down.

I agree with San Francisco; this was like a Jello Blueberry Pudding - if they make such a thing. It may have been easy but I'd rather take the time and have something wonderful. I'll go back to my mom's recipe.

This pie is one of the best I've made. I used half strawberries and half blueberries. It came out great! I always use Pillsbury ready-made crust..the kind you unfold. They are just as good as home-made. Extra lemon juice gave the pie a bit of a kick...I will make this again and again! Sooooo easy!

I made it with strawberries we picked today, and it was great! Followed suggestions to cut water; used 1/3 C, and it was perfect. Still wasn't completely set after 3 hours of chilling, but was solid enough to eat with a fork. Even picky kids gobbled it up.

This pie is great for summer! I made mine only with strawberries since I had a lot from my backyard and it tasted great. Look at the kitchen notes before you make it. I thought they were very helpful.

What a great versatile recipe! I tried it with just nectarines and it was delicious. I can't wait to try it with other fruits and combinations of fruits.

This was a total Grandma dessert. Boring and mushy. It was like a Jell-o mold in a pie crust. Very pedestrian.

This is one of the easiest, tastiest, and most versatile recipes I have ever had the pleasure of preparing. It was a hit at a barbeque that I brought it to, and my fiance is always eager for me to make it. Best of all, it needs no special or hard-to-find ingredients!

I have written a review for this earlier, but i must write and say, i don't know what happened but I tried the oatmeal crust a few weeks ago and, yuck! it ruined the pie....We scraped the filling out and topped it with whipped cream...stick with a classic pie crust!

Rating: 4
This is the first recipe I have ever been so impressed with I had to write a review! It was wonderful. I made it for a friend's party who is allergic to wheat, so I used the oat crust. Why bother with a regular crust after that?! I used blueberries and peaches, added cinnamon and nutmeg to the crust, and left out the butter in the fruit. The best pie I have ever made.

Rating: 4
I don't usually like Blueberry pie but this was fantastic. It was a unique combination of fresh cooked fruit mixed with fresh uncooked fruit. I threw in 2 large peaches and used the oatmeal crust as suggested by a previous reviewer. Topped it with fresh whipped cream. Excellent filling - not too sweet - very fresh tasting.

I can hardly believe my eyes! I have been making this pie (French Berry in my cookbook) for 40 years. It's a family favorite. As the reviewer before me, I use only 1/4 c of water & I add only 1/2 c of sugar. Husband doesn't like it too sweet. Because of less water, I only use 2 tablespoons of cornstarch. I also add a bit of cinnamon.

Rating: 3
Fabulous recipe. My husband (who's very, very picky) said that it was the best fruit pie he's eaten in 20 years. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut way back on the water (I only used 1/4 Cup), whatever fruit I had on hand. I think I ended up with blueberries, strawberries and peaches, topped with fresh whipped cream in a graham cracker crust. Raves from everyone!

I made this with blueberries and strawberries plus a random plum I had in the fridge. I made Erin's oatmeal crust (recipe below -- thanks, Erin!), which was very easy and delicious. The pie was excellent but next time I think I'll leave out the butter -- just didn't seem necessary.

This one is a "keeper"!! I made a few adjustments (that's what cooks do, right?), and find this easy and tasty. I use a sweet pastry dough (Gourmet Entertains,1999)in a springform pan, rather than a pie shell. I blind bake, chill, and then fill. I've used a variety of fruits, most recently blackberries (with a dash of cinnamon), topped with peach filling, to which I added a 1 inch cube of fresh ginger while cooking. I chill the berry filling in the crust for a bit, and then top with the peach, for a stunning two-layered effect. Served with brown sugar whipped cream, and garnished with additional fresh berries and mint leaves, it's a show-stopper. My best friends own a DiRONA award winning restaraunt, so I need this site to help me hold my own. Access to truly fresh, field ripened fruit helps on this recipe. Just a note: I had no difficulty getting this to set using the liquid stated. It does take patience to cook this until it's truly thickened and clear, which is the cooking time as stated, AFTER the mixture starts to bubble. YUMMM!!

I made this pie with strawberries, blueberries and the oatmeal crust mentioned in a previous review. I also lowered the amount of water as suggested by another reviewer. I started with a 1/4 cup of water, then added a bit more until I got the consistency I thought was appropriate. The pie was delicious and didn't last long in my house.

Won't set with papaya or fresh or frozen pineapple. The previous cook is correct, it's the enzymes in those fruits.

I've made this pie many times with various fruit combinations, and my family loves it. It's very easy to make, but it does take longer than 3 hours to set... I can't make it work with papaya - even with reduced water and increased cornstarch... Probably something to do with the enzymes in papaya...

Made this with the oatmeal crust (as described by another reviewer) and it was wonderful. I took everyone's advice and used 3/4 cup water and generous tbs of cornstarch. It set up beautifully. Also put sliced plums (used all my peaches in the pie!) in a circle around the pie and filled the center of the circle with blueberries. Truly lovely dessert.

I cut back the water. Made it with blueberries. It was too gummy. Next time I'll use less corn starch. Also made the oatmeal crust--it was ok, not as good as the previous reviews.

I made this yesterday with fresh strawberries. I should have heeded the advice of other cooks though, because I used the full amount of water and my pie never set. We had to eat it in bowls with spoons!! Luckily I was serving it to my neighbors, who are the least critical people on the planet when it comes to food. Anyway, I will definitely attempt this one again. Even though mine looked weird, it still tasted great! Next time I will cut the water WAY back. Also used a ready made pie crust to save time.

Amazing pie. I used fresh ripe peaches and blueberries. The fruit was so good I only needed 1/3 cup sugar. Really didnt want to fuss with a crust so I used a pre-made graham cracker crust. I can only imagine how much better it would be with a 'real' pie crust. Yumm-m-m

I made a strawberry pie yesterday and I was surprised at how delicious and easy it was. I'm looking forward to trying this pie with a variety of fruits over the summer. I also plan to make just the filling as a vegetarian jello as suggested. It certainly set up and tasted far better than any non-gelatin jello I've tried.

This is a great pie recipe. I've made it in Summer with fresh fruit and in Winter with high quality frozen fruit and it always turns out great. (Though the Summer ones are better.) We like our pie a bit tart so I usually only add in about a 1/2 c. of sugar and more like 2 T. lemon juice. Sometimes I'll add a little vanilla and cinnamon, depending on the fruit. Using a pre-baked pie crust, it's a fun activity to do with my three year old.

Um, I did something wrong. The filling never set. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but next time I'll add more cornstarch, or less water, or cook it longer. The pie is absolutely delicious (I used strawberries). Too bad I could eat it with a straw.

This pie is great made with an oatmeal crust- especially if you use berries as the fruit! Just mix 2c oatmeal, 1/3 c brown sugar and enough melted butter to make it stick together (~1/3 -1/2 c) depending on your tastes. Press into pie pan and bake 10 minutes on 400 or til golden and crispy. Then prepare filling as directed and top with fresh whip cream or cool whip! Yummy!!!

This pie is delicious and very easy to prepare. I used fresh white peaches and blueberries... 3/4 cup of water and 3/4 cup of sugar. There was plenty of filling for the deep dish pie shell. This is the perfect summer pie!

I made my own crust from another recipe, but this filling is heavenly. I used blueberries and had to add only a few tablespoons of sugar. This is very healthy as pies go, and more delicious than most. Superb.

This tastes amazing, and it works! I love pies, but hate dealing with crusts, so I used a frozen shell and pre-baked it. I used frozen blueberries and cherries, and just microwaved the portion for the sauce to thaw enough to mash. I was really impressed that something so simple actually resulted in a fresh fruit pie. I will definitely try again, probably with other fruit combinations.

This is a versatile recipe that is quick, easy & delicious. I used fresh raspberries & peaches for the cooked sauce and used peaches, blueberries and raspberries for the uncooked fruit. The second time I made it I reduced the water to just about 1/4 cup and it looked better and held together better. I also arranged the cut fruit, peaches on the outside, then a circle of blueberries and raspberries in the center. It made for a much prettier pie.

I didn't bother to make the pie shell, I used premade cookie shells sold in the supermarket. I made it four times already with blueberries and it is delicious except I do not add the butter.

This was really good. I used peaches and strawberries and less than 1 cup of sugar in the filling. And - I used Keebler individual graham cracker dessert crusts. The filling was better the next day as it had more time to firm up. Great for the summer!

Great and so easy. I didn't use sugar either - just a little brown rice syrup from the health food store (cut the water in half). Made mine with white peaches and raspberries. My husband said it was the best fruit pie he ever had.
