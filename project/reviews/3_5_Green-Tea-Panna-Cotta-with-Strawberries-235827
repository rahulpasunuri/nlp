I had wanted to try this recipe for a long time as I am a lover of panna cotta and the unusual green tea combination sounded very appealing. It was very easy to make and because I added 1/4 cup heavy cream, it was very creamy. Unfortunately, the subtlely of this flavor did not impress me, though I am never opposed to subtlely at all. So, even though it did not suit my preference, my many friends praised the dessert.

Very good. You can get matcha (green tea powder) pretty easily nowadays, especially at the Hmart. It is supposed to make about 1/4 cup servings, which is a perfect serving size. After all, it's dessert, right? I also added more green tea powder (a 1/4 tsp more, and one less spoonful of sugar) the second time I made it.

I haven't tried this yet, but am wondering how using only 1 cup half & half with the other ingredients can make enough to fill 4 2/3 -cup molds. It seems to me that this would make four 1/4 cup servings - pretty dinky...

This was very good - we all enjoyed it including my Japanese sister in law. I'm not sure what the previous reviewer meant by "thick" matcha? Matcha is Japanese green tea that instead of being dried is ground using a stone wheel for anywhere from 24 to 36 hours. The result is a powder similar to icing sugar and the tea is VERY green. When making Matcha as tea you use a bamboo whisk and water that has not reached boiling. 4oz of water mixed with 1 tsp of matcha powder makes a delicious, (albiet very "green" tasting)extremely healthy tea. Because you are consuming the whole tea leaf and not just steeping and then discarding the tea the results are a very healthy drink. Matcha is loaded with nutrients and had 70 times more antioxiants than orange juice. It is a great energy booster - no spike and crash as with sugar or coffee. For the reviewer who said it wasn't as green as she had thought I would suspect she purchased green tea powder and not matcha. Your end result should be a beautiful shade of emerald green. Real matcha is pricey - we sell it in our coffee/tea shop and my cost is $65 CND for 250g (for you Americans who don't understand the metric system that is 1 cup). Sorry to go on and on - can you tell I'm pretty passionate about the stuff! Anyway, the recipe is very good!

I really liked this recipe! It was an unexpected twist on panna cotta. Your matcha is more likely to sink if it is the "thick" type. You can click Here to find out some more information about Matcha.

Good, however not as green colored as I had anticipated and for some reason the matcha all sunk down to the bottom(don't know if I didn't mix well enough or what). Also it did not gel, or set as firm as I had expected it to. When I released it from the ramekin onto a plate, it kind of collapsed into a flat blob. It was more like very soft jello.
