Goes perfectly with the meatball recipe linked here, but probably would need a bit more flavoring if served as a side for other Mexican dishes. However, I find it works very well with the tomato-serano sauce. Easy!

This was a wonderful side dish for our Mexican food night. A few people seem to think it's a bit bland, but I thought it was perfect. Flavorful, but doesn't compete with the other intense parts of the meal.

I've made this twice, and both times it has turned out well. It's really delicious and easy! Like some of the other reviewers, I substituted olive oil for canola oil and cilantro for parsley. I think that the cilantro really makes the rice taste amazing; it might be a little bland without it. I served this with veggie fajitas and black beans and corn, and while it probably wouldn't stand on its own, it complemented the other dishes nicely. I got compliments on the rice from a lot of people and will definitely be making it again in the future.

Mexican rice is not white.

This has a surprising amount of flavor given how few ingredients it has. It's very mild, but has a nice amount of salt & onion to kick it up a notch. I did use a bit more salt & olive oil, and omitted the parsley. This would make a good accompaniment to more flavorful, hearty dishes or something with a lot of spice. I will definitely be making this again in place of plain rice when I want a bit more flavor without a lot of extra effort. However, it will not replace red rice in my Mexican cooking.

Rice was great! We added a little Cholula, garlic powder and ground pepper. Went great with chicken fajita's! :-)

I've made this a couple of times in the past with mixed results, but tonight, WOW! This is what I did different, used olive oil and the full 2 tablespoons (rarely use more than 1 1/2) rather than canola oil, one teapsoon of dried parsley (no fresh on hand) and used a smaller pan. It took a little longer with the smaller pan and it really picked up the flavors of onion and olive oil. Will make like this again soon.

I didn't find the rice to be flavorful enough. Served at a dinner party along with fajitas and sauteed shrimp and everything went quickly except this rice. Maybe I could have added something more?

This simple rice dish was great! It complemented my fish tacos perfectly. I left the garlic in, adding more of the flavor I love. I will definitely make it again.

What a kick! Didn't know there was a recipe for something I've been making for the last 25 years that I've lived in Mexico. My Mexican mother-in-law taught me to make this - the rice is fried first in the oil and then the chopped onion, chopped garlic, water and salt are added all together. I use a lot more salt than this recipe calls for, and no parsley. I probably make this twice a week to go Yucatecan food.

Very good - as others said, it's a great accompaniment to a spicy entree. I minced the garlic, sauteed it 30 seconds then added the onion - more flavorful. Will definitely make again.

This turned out exactly how I wanted it. Instead of just halving the garlic and then removing it, I gently mashed each half clove with the side of a knife (or use a mallet), and sauteed it with the onion. I also added about a half tomato, diced. I used closer to a tablespoon of sea salt (I didn't have fine), perhaps maybe even a bit more before simmering the rice. I served it with the chicken enchiladas recipe from this site.

Yes, is somewhat plain by itself, but very good with Southwestern Lime Chicken recipe from this site. Also - did not remove garlic, and used cilantro instead of parsley, as had cilantro on hand. Have already made this a couple of times and will continue to do so!

Yes, this is bland on its own but it is superb with a picante-sauced entree. I'd be inclined to mince the garlic and cook it with the rice next time.

By itself it may be bland, but I served this dish with Pan-Seared Tilapia with Chile Lime Butter (recipe on this site), and it was a perfect complement to the pepper on the fish. I liked having the onion in there, though I was hoping to have a bit more of the garlic flavor. I'll have to experiment with it some more. I was pleasantly surprised that the rice had the perfect texture and did not make a sticky mess or burn onto the bottom of the pan. This one is definitely a keeper.

turns out great. several times used the recipe and no leftovers! guests always make commnents about the rice. for a healthy version, I use brown rice and double cooking time (50 min.

This was tasty and subtle. I served it with the Pork and Hominy Stew (quite spicy) and liked the relief of the rice. I subbed chicken stock for half of the water in the recipe. I actually used long grain rice (what I had on hand) and it turned out fine...OH btw, it's not the general practice to add salt to rice before cooking (usually, it's after it's absorbed the liquid).

For those of you who think this is a bland recipe, it is supposed to be an accompaniment no stand alone. By itself, yes it is bland. But with the meatballs in the tomato-serrano chili sauce it is excellent.

Perfect with the Garlic Shrimp. Would definitely make again.

i prepared this recipe, along with garlic shrimp (also from epicurious)and it was a great meal. instead of the italian parsley, which i did not have, i used sprigs of cilantro and liked the fresh taste addition to this recipe. for those who claimed this was bland, i can see why, but having this with a dish as flavorful as garlic shrimp it seems just right. personally, i was impressed with the outcome and would definitely make this again.

A Cook from Siloam Springs, AR on 07/05/03 HELLO!! Is anyone reading the review from...let's see...MEXICO! We are so Americanized in our taste of Mexican food.(Taco Bell!) This rice is like a fresh breath after spicy or hot foods. Kind of like clearing yout pallet. It prepares your mouth to catch all the spicyness again making the meal more enjoyable!

It was delicious. I added vegetable stock to the 3 cups water to add a little depth. It was wonderful w/ the Serrano chile.

Very bland and not worth the effort

HELLO!!! This is WHITE rice, it's just Mexican style. It's not meant to be a dish on its own. White rice in Mexico is served as an accompaniament to strong flavored or heavily sauced meats. Saying this is bland is like saying that Chinese steamed rice is bland..that's the idea!!

Nothing really special on its own, but this was a nice accompaniment to some of the Mexican dishes from this special issue on Mexico. I served it with the Shredded Beef Salad and with the Chipotle Meatballs.

Found this to be very bland. Not a typical Mexican flvor. If I make it again would add jalapena or some other chile
