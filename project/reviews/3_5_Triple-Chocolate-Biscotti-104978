I have been making these for years and they're always a hit. Since the white chocolate chips make slicing difficult (they don't melt), I use slivered almonds or pecans instead, and then melt the white chocolate chips & drizzle on top of the finished biscotti. Yum!

Substituted 8oz of semisweet choc with 8of bittersweet chocolate and swapped out 1/2 c white chocolate with 1/2 cup semi sweet. Chocolate heaven!!

I'm not sure what the fuss over these is... They look like biscotti, but sure don't taste like them. The texture is all wrong. I baked mine a little longer as I wanted a crisp biscotti and while crisp, it's like a styrofoam biscuit. I won't be making these again.

This is going to be one of my favorite biscotti recipes! Instead of the semisweet chocolate chips and the white baking chips, I added toasted pecans, coarsely chopped extra dark chocolate with coffee bits and toffee pieces. I also added some amaretto. This will make an excellent gift for the holidays. Enjoy!

I guess I didn't follow the recipe that closely. I used parchment instead of foil and the second bake was 30 minutes, not 16, and then i let them cool in the oven. they're greeaaat!

Followed the recipe except for 1/2 cup of brown sugar because I was out of white and + 1/2 cup slivered toasted almonds. The biscotti turned out great. They are pretty fragile when you're slicing them so it helps to clean the knife after 2 or 3 slices to get the warm chocolate off and reduce friction.

This is excellent! Instead of chocolate chips, I roughly chopped up a bar of espresso chocolate. Coffee lovers, beware... can't stop eating it!

This recipe turned out to be fantastic! I made them to give to my co-workers as holiday gifts and they were a huge hit! I didn't have any white chips, so I just left those out. But to make them a little more seasonally appropriate, I dipped one end in melted chocolate and rolled them in crushed candy canes. They were lovely and tasted great!

This is my favorite biscotti recipe. I have made some changes though--I use 3/4 c. sugar, 1/2 c. each of the white and semisweet chips and, only two eggs. I don't bother with aluminum foil. Just grab it out of the mixing bowl, separate it into two mounds and then roll into a log and place it on a sheet with parchment paper. No problem forming it.

This was great - made for the mother's in my life for Mother's Day - this was my first experience making biscotti and I thought it was really easy, despite the reviews below that say it was too complicated - my only problem - I ate most of them and have to make more for all the moms I wanted to give them to! :-)

Just made a double batch of this outstanding biscotti. Followed the recipe to the letter and added one additional element to make it the "quad chocolate biscotti" by dipping one end in semi-sweet chocolate. I am a espresso and chocolate junky and this one is a winner! Thanks to Mary Tripoli for sharing this recipe!

great recipe. perfect for dipping in a zinfandel or a big, bold syrah. we made the following changes: 1/2 cup cocoa powder 1 tsp. chili powder 1 tsp. ground cinnamon *no chocolate chips in the dough! after the biscotti were baked, we drizzled some melted semi-sweet chocolate over the top... we baked a few minutes longer for better dunking in red wine! buon appetit - xo

I've tried a lot of biscotti recipes, and this one is ok, but not great. Despite all the chocolate - I even added some extra cocoa (subbed for some flour) - the result lacked flavor. And even though biscotti dough is supposed to be wet, this dough was unecessarily hard to handle (putting it in the fridge for a while before making logs would help). Also, the recipe is excessively complicated, in my opinion. The orange-chocolate biscotti recipe on this site is a much better introduction to biscotti - easier to handle, and the cookies have a much nicer texture.

This is my mom's favorite recipe in the world, and she asks me to make it every chance she gets. My only addition to the recipe is to coat half of each biscotti with good-quality chocolate and top with some non-pareils.

This is an extremely versatile recipe. They can be made into a hard cookie or a soft cookie by changing the baking time. To resolve the issue of them sticking to the foil is to use the non-stick foil.

I made this for a new year's party, and heeded the advice of the cooks below. I did not use the tin foil, insted greased and floured the cookie sheet, and did drop it into rough logs (dough is VERY sticky) and put logs in fridge for about 20 minutes, then molded them with wet fingers. The first batch was indeed brownie like-I was too impatient and did not cook them long enough, and the abundance of chips caused the knife to stick. For the second batch, I did 2oz white chips, 2oz bittersweet, and 2 oz macadamia nuts. First baking I went to almost 30 minutes, and the second baking stood 1/2 the batch up, and 1/2 on their sides to see what method was the best. The sides seemed to work best, and I stayed true to the 300 and 8 minutes. Perfection!!! I am going to drizzle both chocolates over them. Can not wait to bring them to the party!

The ingredients in this recipe did amount to a delicious biscotti but i found the method of prep to be more difficult than neccesary. Did not like the the use of tin foil and dropping batter onto pan. Wasted alot of batter because it stuck to the tin foil and rubber spatula. Also, needs to cook much longer than recipe stated. In the future i will chill dough and then mold onto a greased cookie sheet and later 2nd bake until crunchy.

Loved these. After flipping the cookies for the second 8 minutes, I stood them up and baked them a little longer to achieve a really dry cookie.

This was my first time making biscotti and I think they came out very well. I substituted chocolate chips for the white chips, but then I partially dipped the biscotti in white chocolate after they had cooled.

I've made this recipe several times now, and it's always a hit. I prefer a hard biscotti though, and I've found the easiest way to achieve this is simply by leaving the oven at 350 and not turning it down as the recipe suggests. Definitely a crowd pleaser.

This is my first attempt at making biscotti. I think it turned out well. I omitted the white chocolate. It is an easy recipe to make and tastes good. I like a hard biscotti or soft and chewy. This recipe turned out somewhere in between. It took a little longer than indicated to bake. I also used parchment paper to bake on and was very easy to handle for cutting.

Rating: 3
i've made this recipe several times, each time making a small (to my taste) improvement. i use all semisweet chocolate chips (i don't believe in the white stuff) and i increase the cocoa and decrease the sugar a bit. the last time i made it, i baked the slices on cooling racks set on a baking sheet. i didn't have to flip them halfway and baked for only 12 minutes or so. the result was delicious. (note-they were chewier and moister. they would probably need to bake the full 16 minutes or longer to be crisp.)

Rating: 3
I loved this recipe, but next time I will omit the white chips because it was so gooey when I cut it. Also, I will bake it on wax or parchment paper, because I had a little problem with it sticking to the foil. Also, I used an electric knife to cut it, and that worked much better then a regular serrated knife. A ++++ recipe.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I thought it was too sweet, so the second time I made it, I omitted the white chocolate and used 9 ounces of Cacao Barry Mi Amere bittersweet chocolate in it, and it came out much nicer. It is also not a super-crunchy rock hard traditional biscotti - it comes out more tender than usual recipes. Very good with a double shot of espresso!

I love this recipe! I used mini semi-sweet chips, toasted pecans and then dipped the cookies in melted Lindt white chocolate. Using a serrated knife to score the warm from the oven logs and then a chefs knife for the complete cut eliminates most of the crumbling.

Was looking for a biscotti recipe for Christmas giving, and this wowed everyone. The first batch came out deformed; I think too many chocolate chips made it a melted mess when I cut them into biscotti bars. But it tasted really good -- I gave them away anyway and people loved 'em. Second batch, I cut back on the chocolate chips by half and they came out perfect. I also used the convection oven the second time; it really dries out the biscotti just right. Also -- I added dried chopped cherries -- YUM!

As a previous reviewer suggested I let them cool down in the oven to dry them out so I had a crisp not chewy biscotti. In the future I will cook them on parchment instead of foil-after the first baking the underside was still moist and it stuck a little to the foil. This biscotti seemed sweeter than others I've made but I think I like that! I'll make these again but because this is a versatile base I would like to try them with orange zest or the espresso powder as a previous reviewer suggested.

One the most requested recipes, from both family and friends. I add a scant 1/2 tsp of espresso powder, really deepens the chocolate flavor..and always always, use the best cocoa you can find...absolutely the best!

Turned out perfect even though I used Brumble and Brown's yogurt spread instead of butter. The recipe was a lot easier than I expected, and I'll definitely make it again when I have dinner guests I want to impress; also think they'd make a great gift. Mine turned out crunch and not brownie-like even though I didn't increase the cooking time. I was really careful about precisely measuring the amount of flour I used b/c cooking shows always emphasize this is important for successful baking. The only thing I think I'd change is that I'd use mini-chips instead of full-sized one next time.

These were pukka! I made them for a Jazz and Coffee night and they were a hit- all of them were gone by the night's end. I think they might need a bit more baking time, to make them more crisp. Really lovely though. An easy, delicious variation- substitute the cocoa with ground almonds and instead of adding chocolate chips add about 175 g. white chocolate chips- Really great too.

The flavor was overall good, but they were more brownie-like then biscotti. I was also expecting a more deep chocolaty flavor having used so much cocoa and chocolate chips as the recipe called for. It's good if you don't care for the crispness of other biscotti recipes.

I have made this recipe several times for get togethers, co-workers and family. I can't count the number of people who have asked me for the recipe. They are easy to make and great to have on hand for unexpected company. Even peole who aren't crazy about chocolate loved them because they weren't super sweet.

I made this two nights back to back last week. Brought some to work and heard complaints that it was all gone too soon. Made some more the next day and remembered to keep a stash for me. Plain biscotti is nice, but this is a stick of heaven with my coffee and cream.

I've gotten raves each time I've made this recipe. I first made it for a tailgate function, and people were commenting to my husband all day about the cookies. I've also made these cookies for functions at work, and people always ask for the recipe. They're a little softer than other biscotti I've made, and I have to be careful and use a very sharp knife when I cut them. They're also a little time consuming to make since the logs must be refridgerated for 30 minutes prior to baking. I was worried that I'd have a disaster on my hands the first time I made this recipe since the technique for preparing the logs is a little unusual. However, they always turn out good, and I save any parts that have crumbled off for myself!

Yummy, although they came out more like brownies than biscotti--chewy and crumbly. Still good.

These biscotti are addictive. Try dipping them in white chocolate for contrast. They were a little more fragile during baking than other biscotti recipes I've tried, but are well worth the extra care.

Excellent, dasy biscotti recipe. I found it to be VERY chocolate-y, as I used semi-sweet chips as the recipe called for, rather than milk chocolate. These may be my favorite biscotti recipe of all, and I have a bunch! Great choice for hostess gifts and after-dinner desserts with coffe, as well.

These are as good as any I've bought! I used larger than average milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet and they didn't get really hard. They'd be great dipped or drizzled with more chocolate!

These were okay, and fairly easy, but I still expected much more of a chocolatey flavor. I used milk chocolate chips in place of the semi-sweet. Next time (if there was one) I'd dip half of the biscotti in melted chocolate, and stir in some toasted pecans to put the dish over the top.
