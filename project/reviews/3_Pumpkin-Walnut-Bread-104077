This is the first recipe where I've followed true to form (except for doubling the spices, as suggested) which did not deliver. I use an oven thermometer, and the edges burned before the centre was baked through. Flavors are good and not too sweet. Still looking for a good scratch recipe to replace the trader joe's mix that is so addictive (and nutritionally lacking).

I doubled this recipe and put the second loaf in the freezer. My family went to the freezer the very next day. The other one disappeared as soon as it was cool enough to eat. A wonderful recipe.

I've been making this every fall since 2000 and it is fabulous. Like others, I am mystified by the negative reviews. Make it with the Cranberry-Orange Preserves, also from the October 2000 Bon Appetit. Yum!

I can't understand the negative reviews for this recipe. Do not be deterred - I thought it came out wonderful. The texture is really light and with a good pumpkin flavor. I did make three minor substitutions based on what I had on hand (Fage 0% Greek yoghurt for sour cream, 2% for whole milk and cardamom for cloves). I used 1T of raw sugar on the top and it formed a beautiful crust. I hand whisked, rather than electric and it nicely filled the loaf pan it called for. It rose high, but did not overflow. I'd recommend greasing it completely to the top.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. People are cutting down on bread, but they couldn't resist eating more once they had a bite of this delicious treat.

Thankfully I made a test batch before serving this to friends. I took one bite, then threw the rest of the baked bread and dough away. It did not taste good.

I have made this bread four or five times. I find the texture to be quite lovely, I do not understand why some of the reviews find it to be "goopey". The lemon zest gives it a really interesting flavour that I had not realized was missing in other recipes that I have used. I do make one replacement in the recipe, I use yogurt rather than that of sour cream, I always have yogurt on hand. I am looking forward to making it again this season!

I have no doubt that the folks who found the recipe to be "goopy" and who said it didn't cook according to schedule made the mistake of using the entire can of pumpkin, rather than only the 1 cup called for, an easy mistake to make. The ratio is perfect as set forth in the recipe. I did made a few minor changes, due to ingredients on hand. It was a spur of the moment decision to make it and I didn't feel like going to the store. I used a glass loaf pan because I didnt have metal, and only baked one hour to compensate. I did not put all the batter in the loaf pan; I used the reserved batter to make four cupcakes, which made the loaf the perfect size (3o min. for the cupcakes). Original recipe called for all-purpose flour, unsalted butter, white sugar, and whole milk, which I didnt have; I substituted bread flour, salted butter, brown sugar, half and half, and 2 tsp. fresh lemon juice. I also increased the cinnamon to 1 tsp and the ginger to 3/4 tsp; leaving the cloves the same. I also added 6 oz. mini, semi-sweet chocolate chips in lieu of waltnuts, cuz my daughter doesn't like nuts (weirdo) and the loaf was for her. But the batter is a wee bit on the bland side so I would want to increase spices a bit more if nuts are used rather than chocolate chips. But it works with the chocolate chips as written above. I also sprinkled toasted, salted pumpkin seeds on top, along with about 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. Excellent!

Gross. Made it twice, both times gross. Gooey at the bottom and flavorless. This is after adding 20 minutes to the baking time and doubling the spices. Find another recipe, folks, this one is nasty.

Made this recipe using fresh pumpkin rather than canned. Also rather than just walnuts, used walnuts, pecans, and mixed dried berries. Was a super yummy recipe and me and my man enjoyed the new additions! Nice fall time treat.

This is a GREAT recipe! I used pureed squash instead of pumpkin and it was absolutely delicious. There was definitely too much batter for the pan, but I poured the excess in a smaller dish and baked it alongside the larger loaf. I highly recommend this recipe!

To those of you who had issues with the baking time...you may want to check to make sure your oven thermostat is working properly...sometimes ovens need a bit of tweaking as they will not heat up to the proper temp due to built up "gunk", etc. Have found that sometimes after using the cleaning function on my oven, it takes a time or two for it to ramp up to the proper temp because of the residual stuff left over after cleaning...a routine checkup from an authorized service/repair tech can fix the problem, especially if you have a gas stove/oven

Rating: 1
Way too much batter for one 9x5x3 pan. I followed the recipe as stated (with the addition of more spices) and have batter running all over the oven right now. I should have known better, but took a chance that the recipe was correct. It's not. TYhis should be for TWO loaves - not one. I've put a foil collar around the pan and we'll see how it finally comes out - but I'm not holding my breath. The batter tasted great but this is very disappointing,

This was a great recipe...but I did take the suggestions to add more cinnamon and ginger. I also added some nutmeg. The bread was very flavorful and moist.

I made the following modifications to this recipe with phenomenal results: use organic whole wheat flour instead of all purpose white flour, organic turbinado sugar instead of white sugar, boiled mashed organic butternut squash instead of canned pumpkin, organic pecans instead of walnuts, 1.5 teaspoons of all spices, organic half and half instead of whole milk, orange peel instead of lemon.

I have made this quick bread repeatedly and always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. The only modification I make is to increase the sugar from .75 cup to 1.25 cup. Otherwise all ingredients the same, as well as baking temp and time.

I had the same frustrating experience as the cook from Dallas. I tried everything to get it to bake, but the stick still comes out with raw batter after more than 2 hours in the oven. I finally increased the oven temp to 350, but it's a disaster. What a waste of time and good ingredients. Next time I'm going to use the recipe from Libby's (the canned pumpkin folks).

Recipe was good. The bread was a little dry.

This came out great. Texture was perfect. I did bake it at 350, instead of 325, for the time stated and in a metal 9x5x3 pan. I doubled the ginger and cinnamon which I think is necessary. Otherwise the recipe seems fine. I wonder if people added 1 can of pumpkin instead of 1 cup. That would explain overflowing, extra baking time, etc.

Rating: 2
Average. I followed the directions to the T except I subbed freshly ground nutmeg instead of ginger. If I do make this again, I'd double the spices too--the flavor now is pretty mediocore. I added on twenty extra minutes to the baking time; however the color, texture and size of the pan were perfect.

Rating: 4
I made this for the first time this morning and I LOVE it. I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour, but next time I would try all whole wheat flour. I also used 1 tsp each of the spices instead of 1/2 tsp after reading the reviews. 1 hour 10 minutes was the perfect baking time, as the recipe suggests. I didn't add the walnuts because I didn't have any but I plan to try adding things to this loaf in the future (nuts, chocolate chips). This loaf is so moist, dense and wonderful - exactly what I would want in a loaf. Such a great flavour - pumpkins and spice. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 2
Good base recipe, but needs a lot more punch! I increased cinnamon and ginger to 2 tsp. and I might increase it to 3 tsp. next time. 3/4 cup sugar is good if you are watching sugar or eating it for breakfast; if you want a sweeter snack I would increase it. I also added about 1/4 c. wheat germ and 1/4 c. flaxseed meal...delicious!

Rating: 2
I followed all the suggestions - reduced the sugar, doubled the pumpkin and spices, etc. Not great. It tasted horrid out of the oven, but was delicious once I had refrigerated it overnight and the texture was a bit denser, like a pumpkin fruitcake. And if you're going to double the spices, I would keep the full amount of sugar - or at best reduce it by only 1/8 cup. It tastes bitter otherwise. And this is definitely enough for 2 loaves, not the one indicated in the recipe.

This was very good and moist but I would increase the spice amount, it was not strong enough flavor for me. On the other hand I provided this bread for some people after they finished the Marine Corps marathon and they loved it!

Rating: 3
I found this simple to make and quite good. I would prefer some stronger spice flavors so I might add more next time (no, my spices aren't old). It is very moist and really does need the fully cooking time. I'm not sure what problem the one cook had, but clearly something went wrong with his process/ingredients. This is a pleasant breakfast, snack or dessert bread.

This was an absolute disaster and a complete waste of resources. I'm a fairly experienced baker, but I can't figure out what I did to make this turn out so bad. It's the first time I've ever made anything that went straight from the oven to the garbage can. After 2 hours in the oven, the inside was raw and the outer crust was tough and coarse, although I covered the whole thing in foil to prevent burning. I'm definitely going back to my Better Homes & Gardens Pumpkin Nut Bread and forgetting about this mess forever.

I'm just curious as to if any of the more negative reviews have to do with the freshness of the spices the cooks are using. Might make a big difference in the flavours.

I made this for hostess gifts at Christmas parties this year, and it was a huge hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. It's very moist, and the flavor of the pumpkin and walnuts comes through perfectly. It's so much better then basic pumpkin bread. Long ingredient list, but worth the trouble.

This a pretty simple and fantastic recipe for leftover pumpkin puree. Wonderfully complex flavor with an addictive crunchy sugar glaze. Light, cake-like texture. It makes a lot of batter so use the right sized pan or fill pan no more than 3/4 full.

Overall a good recipe. The only change I would suggest is to use two 9x5x3 metal loaf pans. I followed the exact recipe (more so than my normal off the cuff measuring/cooking) as this was my first time making this, but when I baked it almost half of the batter ended up flowing over the sides of the one loaf pan I used. (It looked like too much batter, but I thought I would give the recipe the benefit of the doubt.) Also, at least in the one pan it took about another 20 minutes to finish.

I tried several pumpkin bread recipes this year and this was by far my favorite. I followed the recipe exactly (making sure to use the correct size pan) and it produced a nice high loaf with wonderful color, texture and flavor. I served it at Thanksgiving and received rave reviews. Even a guest who was not a fan of pumpkin demanded the recipe.

I followed the advice in the other reviews and poured the batter into a 12 X 4 loaf pan just to be safe. Came out great. I used this to make bread pudding by mixing the leftover pumpkin puree with custard, brown sugar and added more spices and some currents soaked in brandy. Fantastic with Maple Ice Cream or Bourbon Sauce!!

NEAR DISASTER! Ok, I expected a soft, cake like bread, which was full of spice and nuts. When I put the batter together, I found that it was sour and not sweet enough - so no to panic ! I added 1/2 cup more sugar, 1/4 cup maple syrup and 1/2 tsp more cinnamon. I baked it for 1 1/2 hours (needed 20min more), and it turned out to be OK. Not great, but OK. I think there are better recipes out there....

As I made this recipe it seemed like a lot of batter. I took the advice of the cook from CO and used two pans. One of which was the right size. The bread cooked in about 50 minutes. After all that I didn't think it had much flavor. I'm going to look for the Betty Crocker recipe.

This is a very delicious pumpkin bread. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and I think the secret for those who had trouble with it spilling over during baking is that you need to use the correct size pan. Mine came out just perfect with the size pan the recipe indicated. I am making it again today for company that will be here for the weekend.

The recipe sounded wonderful and most of the comments were good, however, someone really goofed on the size of the pan. I think two of a smaller bread pan would be better since mine flowed all over the oven so that I never got to taste it. Didn't want to finish baking it so that it would burn onto the floor of the oven. I will try it again, but use two loaf pans.

This is my favourite seasonal recipe. It tastes like gingerbread, it's super moist and a snap to make.

Tastes great with tea and black cherry preserves.

After reading the reviews and making a loaf from the recipe, here are my suggestions. Leave out the milk and add another half cup of pumkin. I found the cake to be too walnutty, so I made a second one using 1/2 cup walnuts and 1 cup of chocolate chips. As for clairifying the amount of pumpkin, the recipe calls for 1 cup, not 1 can; I used fresh pumkin puree and the cake turned out fine, good consistency and texture.

Hi. This sounds good - especially with the orange rather than lemon rind. I'm wondering, however, what size can of pumpkin to use. I suspect that the range of comments is indicative of the different cooks using different size cans of pumpkin. Given that the recipes are used by cooks from all over, could you pls in future indicate what size cans (or packages) the recipe calls for? Thanks!

I don't know what I did wrong...was it me, or the recipe? After 1 hr. 15 min. in the oven, it was like a wet brick. I was so disappointed, as I love pumpkin bread and had substituted pecans for walnuts, which I prefer. I would be really apprehensive about making this again.

I haven't made the bread but in reading many of the reviews, it sounds like the amount of flour is a problem. Keep in mind that the amount of moisture that your flour has already absorbed can make a difference. Flour in Arizona is different from flour in Oregon because of the humidity. You sometimes have to judge on your own.

Delicious and beautiful-but-I have omitted ingredients and altered the mixing. After making this bread using the recipe as stated (but without the lemon, nuts and with 1/4 cup milk) it was tasty but mushy.Too much liquid. Here's what I did... Omit the lemon and the milk altogether. Cream butter with sugar till fluffy then add eggs. Mix in dry ingredients, then add sour cream with vanilla just till incorporated. Bake at 325 for 25 min, then about 35 min. at 350. Delicious. If my children weren't so finicky, I would have added nuts and/or currents.

My husband & I rated this recipe excellent and a keeper. I did make two little changes, used 2 tbsp powdered buttermilk and 1/2 cup water in lieu of the sour cream, and added raisins. Baked it for 1 hr 20 min came out just perfect. To the cook who wanted to modify it to low fat, that is easy just replace the 1/2 cup of butter with 1/2 cup of applesauce - Voila!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. I baked it along with my friend. First, the flavor was not intense enough. Second, we baked for 1 hour 15 minutes and still when the bread was sliced it was "gummy" on the bottom portion. I know the oven temp. was correct and we have a oven thermometer. I'm not sure if baking 2 loaves at once had anthing to do with it? I had some canned pumpkin leftover. I used a recipe from the Libby Co. and had great success with a lot less ingredients!

I'm a novice baker and this bread came out perfectly. It's not intensely pumpkin flavored, but that was good. I did cook it a little longer than the recipe called for--but that's why you need a cake tester! The oven and type of loaf pan could make a difference on time. Great for a gift .
