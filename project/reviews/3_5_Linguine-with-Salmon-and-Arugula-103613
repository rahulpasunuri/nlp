This was very tasty. I used kale instead of arugula and a red onion instead of shallots, but otherwise pretty much stuck to the recipe. A lot of chopping, but it paid off! Fresh linguine and wild salmon really made the dish!

I had made an adapted version of this before, but decided last night to make the real thing -- clam juice and all. In the end I probably slightly over-cooked the pasta - I would recommend not starting to cook the pasta until the sauce is almost complete, otherwise you risk the pasta becoming too done. But, besides slightly softer pasta than I usually like, I thought this recipe was only okay for the effort that went into it (chopping tons of garlic, shallots, including clam juice, wine, etc). I frequently make tastier pasta with just some quickly sauteed anchovies. So this wasn't bad, just not nearly as good as I would have liked, given the effort I put in.

I wanted a creamy sauce, so simply substituted the same amount of heavy cream for the clam juice. Also added cayenne as an earlier reviewer suggested. Very nice. I will definitely make this again.

I made this dish as one of my seven fishes for Christmas Eve. I was a big hit.

This works well. My guests watched me prepare it and enjoyed the show. Make sure to put more arugula than recipe calls for, 5 cups anyway. Also, sprinkle in some cayenne pepper to give it a great kick.

This recipe was super quick and very yummy. Unfortunately we had to go sans the capers because there was none on hand. I recommend it but would cut the garlic by one clove.

I made this recipe for a 20 person sit-down dinner. It was good and I got some compliments. However, it was a little difficult to time for a large group. I used wild salmon due to the environmental issues with farmed (atlantic) salmon. And used whole wheat pasta. So waiting to time the dinner resulted in slightly dried out fish and slightly too soft pasta. But in general good.

I also reduced sauce. Very tasty, but too much pasta for amount of sauce I ended up with. Will definitely make again.

Only had penne in the house and would substitute it again. A great pasta shape for soaking up all that extra liquid. Yum!

This is delicious. I gave it only 3 forks because I don't like to do all that chopping! But it's worth it. I used a generous amount of halved grape tomatoes instead of plum, and they added a sweetness that complimented the garlic and wine nicely. I'm nor sure the clam juice adds anything though. But this is a great recipe and one that I will make over and over!

I made this with fresh spinach instead of the arugula, as I didn't have any on hand. I will try it next time with arugula, as I think that will add some tartness, which was missing.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. I thought it was lacking in flavor. There's nothing terrible about it, but one could do much more with salmon, pasta, and arugula.

1 3/4 pounds of salmon for FOUR servings!!!! Half that much would be more than ample.

By eliminating the butter this dish is a terrific low fat meal. I used fresh marjoram and sweet onion instead of shallots and added 3 cups baby spinach leaves along with the arugula. I find that I prefer lighter sauces like this on pasta. This dish should be very good leftover as the pasta has had time to soak up the favorful sauce.

A great Sunday brunch recipe to share with friends. I have also substituted English Spinach for the Rocket.

This whole dish was awesome!! The sauce was great, and had just the right amount of flavor from the wine. I used slightly less salmon, and would suggest more arugala- but really the amounts are up to the chef, and modifications won't hurt a thing.

I too cooked down the sauce to make it less soupy, and I would make it again with the exact proportions for that sauce. (I did use home made fish stock rather than clam juice) However, the minute I put in the arugula, I knew it would not be enough! I added a second three cups, and it was perfect! It also improved the appearance of the dish with more green. a GREAT recipe to repeat.

A great dish. I've found that it tastes even better the next day.

Delicious. Made just as written but did not have any arugula. I will try it again with arugula, but if you don't have it, it will still be a very delicious and light pasta. Very good served chilled also.

I've made this recipe so many times! It's just wonderful - my 19-year old son's favorite. I usually mess with recipes but this one has stayed exactly as is. Too good to change!

I cooked this recipe as it's written (simmered liquids longer) but cut it in half for the two of us. We thought it was excellent. I might add some fresh sliced mushrooms with the tomatoes next time. So glad it's arugula time again!

I thought this recipe was good, but not great...I would make it again, but with a few adjustments (this time I followed the recipe exactly). I would poach the salmon in a court bouillon, by adding some peppercorns to the tomato/wine mixture and lowering the heat. The arugula & basil added a nice touch - I would probably just add both to the hot drained pasta. Some previous reviewers mentioned that they thought the recipe was a little soupy; it actually is a little like a bouillabaisse, but I liked the extra liquid for its flavor.

I used mostly parsley and basil (didn't have any arugula) and it came out very tasty. I seeded the tomato and used only 1 cup of wine. In order to avoid a soupy sauce I reduced the liquid till almost none left.

This has become one of my favorite dishes! It's delicious. I prefer a less "soupy" sauce, so I took more time to cook it down. Otherwise, it's a great dish!!!

Great dish. I cut down on the butter (1 T) and used chicken stock instead of clam juice (didn't have on hand). Also used 2 regular peeled/seeded tomatoes (no plums) and only 1 package of arugula (maybe less than 2 c.)and increased the basil a bit - and it was the perfect amount for us - I think more arugula would have been a bit too overpowering for the other great flavors to come through. Just a touch too soup-y for my taste, but my husband loved it. We'll try it on company next time!

Absolutely declicious and looked pretty with the pink salmon, red tomatoes, green arugala and cream-colored pasta. I used angel hair pasta vs linguine which gave a much lighter feel to the meal. Will keep on hand and will definitely try with scallops, shrimp and maybe chicken!

Quite easy and very tasty. Combination of flavors is great. I would definitely make this if I were having guests over.
