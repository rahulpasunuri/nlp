I forgot to mention that I also used 3/4 teaspoon of dried thyme leaves, since I had no fresh thyme.

I created a variation on this recipe, because I like a variety of different vegetables. Instead of 4 medium sweet potatoes, I used 2 large sweet potatoes, 2 large sweet white onions, and 2 large red bell peppers, and 4 garlic cloves. I cut up all the vegetables and placed in a 13 x 9 inch glass pan. I increased the red pepper flakes to 3/4 teaspoons, used 3 tablespoons of extra light olive oil, and 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt. I baked at 450 for an hour, instad of 40 minutes. The smell of the baking onions, garlic and red peppers was extremely strong, and I had to open my back door to ventilate the house. I must say this was one of the most delicious vegetable dishes I have ever tasted! The combination of the natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes and the spicy of the red pepper flakes was just incredibly delicious! I will make this recipe over and over again!!

Wow! This is hands-down the best sweet potato recipe I have ever tried. After reading the 'burned garlic' review, I covered the pan loosely with foil for the 1st half of roasting time, then removed.I didn't have fresh thyme, so used 1 T dried suggested by another reviewer. They were perfectly cooked with a slight crispy texture on the outside, and soft and moist on the inside. The flavors are fantastic! Everybody raved. Thank you Kathryn for sharing - YUMMY!!!

This was surprisingly good! I did drop the oven temp down to 425F and didn't have issues with garlic burning, etc. The red pepper flakes and fresh thyme really worked well with the sweet potatoes. It was the surprise highlight of Thanksgiving!

I knew this recipe was doomed just by reading the directions but I ignored my better judgement and followed the recipe exactly. The ingredients are sublime but you can't toss the potatoes in the garlic and then expect to stick them in a 450 degree oven for 40 minutes without burning the garlic! These were terrible...unless you don't mind burnt garlic taste. I'm baffled as to how none of the other reviews on this recipe don't have an issue with this. I will try this recipe again sometime except, I will follow my intuition and just toss the potatoes in everything except the garlic until the very end.

Delicious and easy too! I made exactly as directed and it was great. Had no idea roasted would be so good. I will try to mix it up with some other spices next time.

A really yummy way to serve sweet potatoes. Fixed them for Mother's Day and everyone loved them. The only change I made was to cut them into 1/2 inch slices instead of 1 1/2 inches.

Terrific! I didn't flip them, and wished I had, (they looked a bit burned), but still tasted excellent. Can't wait to make these again.

Simply amazing! Wonderful balance of sweet, herbal and savory. The bottoms of the rounds got some wonderful dark carmelization from the baking pan; I'm glad I didn't flip them and let them sit through the entire baking process. It has only been in the past year that I have developed a taste for sweet potatoes and this has helped sway me even further.

I made these for my Passover seder in April. I had thought they would serve as a kind of "filler" side dish seeing as I had prepared all sorts of onerous, laborious traditional dishes. To my surprise, these spicy little sweet potatoes nearly stole the show! I doubled the recipe, figuring I'd have plenty leftovers, but they were polished off before we even cleared the plates. This is a super-easy, throw-it-all-together dish that I will make over and over again!

I just threw out the rest of my fresh thyme this morning because it wasn't so fresh anymore so I used dried thyme. They were super delicious, just the right amount of crunch & tenderness combination. Will make all the time!!

Easy and made with things I always have in the kitchen - I threw in a half dozen whole garlic cloves to roast along with the potatoes, and cut the minced garlic by half. Found the nutty roaste garlic flavor to pair well with that warm potato flavor. Yum!

We thought this was very good...didn't use it for Thanksgiving (I wanted to try to Sweet Potatoes with cardamon recipe from this site)...but certainly could have. It's something I'll use with other poultry, brisket, or pot roasts in the future.

Rating: 2
I had high hopes for this dish as I love roasted veggies. However, the flavors on this weren't as pronounced as I would have liked. The dish wasn't terrible, it was just nothing exciting and served as more of a plate filler than anything else. I may play around with this recipe if I make it again, or I may just try something else all together next year.

Rating: 3
Made these with a few changes as suggested by other reviewers. I cut my potatoes into 3/4" slices and then into half moons, plus I only used two large-ish without cutting the other ingredients. For the spice mixture, I didn't have quite enough fresh thyme so I added a little dried to the mix and pounded everything with a mortar and pestle to make a sort of paste. Finally, I started the potatoes in a cold oven to encourage sweetness and roasted at a slightly lower temp to accommodate the other things in my oven. The result? Luscious, velvety sweet potatoes with blistery brown outsides and delicious garlic herb flavor. These were much more than the sum of their parts! Will make again.

Rating: 4
This is easy on the cook while preparing a main roast. So healthy and satisfying...keep the chunks at 1-1/2 inch, as directed. I strip thyme leaves off long stems of fresh sprigs...may have used a bit less than the 1/3 cup specified, but still heavenly. Used mini food prep for the garlic. Easy!

Very simple, easy dish. The sweet potato and thyme harmonize so well.

Rating: 4
This is such an easy and delicious recipe, we use it all the time. If you're pressed for time, cube/dice the sweet potatoes and it shortens cooking time making for a nice home fry effect. Although I prefer the fresh thyme, it works fine with dry as well.

Rating: 4
Forget the candied marshmallow casserole & make this sophisticated, much, much healthier side instead. Because sweet potatoes give off a lot of sugar in the oven & can stick like crazy, I used an easy-release aluminum foil. Even then I sprayed the foil with nonstick spray. Clean up was hassle-free. I've also used fresh chopped rosemary in place of thyme & I increased the Kosher salt to 1 tsp. Great any time!

My hubby is British and hates the traditional brown sugar or marshmallow recipes, so this was a great alternative - we all loved it.

Amazingly delicious. The only change that i made to the recipe was to cut the sweet potatoes in 1" rounds and then cut them in half. Cooked them for 40 minutes -- they came out nice and crispy on the outside and divinely creamy in the middle. They are a bit hot from the chili flakes -- so use sparingly.

Very simple and delicious. I halved the recipe since there were only 2 of us and somehow there wasn't quite enough red pepper flakes for me to get the "kick" other people were talking about.

This is really a fabulous, fast, easy side dish. Fast enough for weeknight dinner. I like it better, though, with the potatoes cut into about 3/4 inch thick slices, and then the slices cut into quarters. It distributes the seasoning better and as a bonus, they cook faster (more like 30 mins for me.)

How can I give this more forks! I have roasted sweet potatoes before, but this was a perfectly balanced recipe as is. I made ahead of time and served at room temp. I cut in rounds and then sliced in half (crescent) cooked at 400 deg for 38 min - perfect! Not only is the flavor delicious, but presentation nice too.

This is an awesome recipe! I made it just as directed. The combination of sweet potatoes, garlic and thyme, with just a hint of red peppers worked out wonderfully. Was a great side dish for rosemary, thyme grilled lamb chops.

These were wonderful! Even the people who only like sweet potatoes cooked with marshmallow or cinnamon LOVED these! They got voted into the highly edited Thanksgiving menu! I cubed them and the 40 minute cook time was perfect.

This is a good, simple recipe. I cut my potatoes into wedges (about 3/4" thick) and should have adjusted the cooking time. I baked them for about 37 minutes and they were burnt on the bottom. I usually use fresh herbs when a recipe calls for it, however I decided to make this at the last minute and didn't have fresh Thyme. The dried worked fine.

These are delicious! There is just enough heat to make them interesting. Red pepper flakes lose their oils that give them heat as soon as they are opened. I save the little foil packets from the pizza carryout, they are always hot! This recipe is a keeper!

What a simple and GREAT dish! Make sure you coat the potatoes really well so they carmelize a bit. The slight spicy flavor was so yummy with the natural sweetness of the yams!

The single layer is very important. I made the mistake of piling them up in a baking dish, which resulted in perfect discs at the bottom and soggy ones on the top. The browning and carmelization that happens to the sweet potato againt the pan MAKES the dish. It was wonderful!

I am now the official potato maker for Thanksgiving. This recipe was easy and packed a lot of flavor punch.

I cooked this dish hoping to get my wife and daughter to like sweet potatoes. I made them each try one after I took them out of the oven and then went to put burgers on the grill. By the time I got back they had eaten them all! This is an excellent recipe that I will definitely make again.

This is so good! Usually I make my sweet potatoes on the sweet side but ventured out because this sounded tasty. My husband and I were both very pleased I did, too! The thyme added a totally different flavor to the sweet potatoes than we're used to and it was a perfect side to my balsamic vinegar salmon!

these were delicious. i see why the recipe says to cook on the top rack though; the bottom of the sweet potatoes can easily burn by the end of the cooking time, so next time i will flip them over halfway through, or shake them around a bit, so they are browned evenly.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving & everyone who "doesn't like sweet potatoes" were amazed at how delicious this dish tasted. It was definitely a huge hit at dinner.

This recipe was excellent! My boyfriend doesn't like sweet potatoes, but I convinced him to try this, and he loved it. Like a lot of other people, I cut the potatoes thinner because an inch and a half seeemed really thick. I cooked them for a little longer than the recipe suggested, and they turned out perfect. I would warn people who don't like garlic that the recipe was pretty potently garlicky, but that might just be the way my batch turned out. Easy to make and delicious!

I didn't think I was much of a sweet potato fan until I made this recipe. The combination of thyme & red pepper gave them great flavor & by-passed all the sweetness you'd normally have by just making plain old sweet potatoes. I served them with roast chicken with spicy herbed olivada (another epicurious recipe) & the meal was simply divine!

I and many of the guests at thanksgiving thought this was very tasty, but I didn't like the 1.5 inch slices, that was too thick for sweet potato. If I make it again I will make the rounds much thinner and adjust the baking time or maybe even cut into cubes or spears. Also, a nice sprinkling of salt when they came out of the oven was a nice and necessary touch.

This is a simple, elegant, terrific dish. I cut them 1-1/2 inches thick, threw them in a large bowl with the oil, garlic, salt, and thyme, and tossed the mixture using my hands. After placing them on the baking sheet, most of the thyme leaves remained in the mixing bowl, yet each slice was nicely dotted with thyme. I had to omit the red pepper due to sensitive guests. Even so, these potatoes were delicious.

Rating: 2
The herb seasoning mixture was great. But, are the slices really supposed to be 1 1/2" thick? Or is this a typo? The chunks were too big for the herb mixture to stick. The potatoes were also a little dry, not enough fat. Next time I will either slice much thinner or cut the whole potato in half lengthwise, put the herb mixture on the cut side, and bake.

Rating: 3
This is an easy and delicious, non-sweet sweet potato dish. I thought four cloves of garlic was a lot, but the garlic and hot pepper flakes made the dish. The only thing I did differently was to cook the potatoes a little shorter than recommended because I was afraid the garlic would burn. These potatoes were a great side for Spiced Pork Tenderloin and Avocado Salsa from this site.
