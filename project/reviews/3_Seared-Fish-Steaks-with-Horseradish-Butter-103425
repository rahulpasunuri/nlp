I brushed steaks with olive oil and broiled them for 10 mins a side in my toaster oven. Served with horseradish sauce ,using lemon juice instead of vinigar.Side dish of snow peas and my Savory Sphagetti Squash. Ready in 20 mins. Excellent low carb supper.

This recipe is about TECHNIQUE not about the sauce. I made a lemon wasabi sauce for swordfish and it came out "restaurant" style. Plus it is EASY.

We're with the reviewer who found the dish tasteless. The horseradish butter lacked bite, probably because the juice was squeezed out. And shark is a fish that tastes good with a good sauce and is barely edible without one.

I loved the simplicity of the fish . . . and the butter was great - I had gotten a little too playful and added garlic rice vinegar to the mixture instead of the regular. . . not such a good idea . . .but to balance it out I added a little dill and tarragon . . . I had two guests who don't even eat fish . . . raving about it! Great with a wild mushroom rice dish!

We loved the horseradish butter really, the second time i whipped it up was for rib-eyes, yumola

I made this with fresh thresher shark. The fish came out nice and tender, but the butter did not add much to the flavor. The fish needed a more flavorful sauce to enhance it.

This is very easy and quick to make. The horseradish butter is wonderful.

I used this recipe with swordfish - absolutely delicious! Also, if you liked this recipe, you'll probably love Seared Tuna Pepper Steaks from Bon Appetit, September 1998.

I was a bit concerned about the butter being overwhelming, but it really did end up being the perfect accompaniment! I didn't vinegar on hand, so I used a bit of fresh lemon juice. Yummy!
