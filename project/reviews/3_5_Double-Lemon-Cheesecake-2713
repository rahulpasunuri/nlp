The results of this recipe were exceptional being that it was so fast and easy to make. A few minor tweaks I made was to use 2 full blocks of cheese, and limes instead if lemons. All remaining ingredient measurements I kept the same including the s. cream topping. Made a simple graham cracker crust with 10 whole graham crackers, 1/3c. rm. temp butter, and 1/4c. brown sugar. Pulse in f. processor and pack into an 8" spring form pan. Pre-bake for 10 mins. @ 350. I did bake in a ban marie as I always do with custards, and cheesecakes. Straightforward tart, creamy, and delicious.

I have been making the Double Lemon Cheesecake for several years at Passover. Instead of the crust which the recipe includes, I substitute a mixture of fresh coconut, macadamia nuts and a bit of butter. Bake for a few minutes then add the cheesecake mixture. It is a huge hit each year. I have also made the recipe exactly as outlined in the recipe and again, wildly popular. Thanks for a versatile and fabulous recipe!

I've been making this cheesecake for years and it's a family favorite. Sometimes I'll double the recipe (except for the sour cream topping,which stays the same) and omit about 1/4 or so cup of sugar (love tart stuff.) Will love this recipe forever.

Made this for Easter dinner, as an alternative to our traditional lemon meringue pie. Delicious! Instead of a store-bought graham crust, I used the graham crust recipe from the Banana Rum Cream pie on this site, seasoning it with ginger instead of the suggested curry powder.

I made this cheesecake for the first time and everyone loved it. I put a thin layer of Lemon Curd on the top as well giving it an extra lemony taste.Being unable to buy the base I made that as well. I will be making this again it is easy to do and very succesful.

I would make this dessert anytime for anyone, dinner party, casual affair, etc. The only adjustment that I made was to use only about half of the top layer, as the whole top layer seemed a bit much. I've also served this recipe with a mild blackberry or blueberry topping.

This had a different texture that I was expecting, kind of mousse-like. I used an oreo crust and I would not do that again - it just did not work with the lemon. I think a ginger crust would be great. I actually did not make the sour cream topping but used part of a can on Lucky brand raspberry pie filling. It was pretty good!

Very good, but expanded on Bloonginton Ca's comment. Didn't use the sour cream topping but took lemon curd, dalloped it around the top and swirled it into the cheesecake. Very lemony. To Joe Zollo, a full cup lemon juice? The recipe used only 1/4 cup.

We have made this numerous times since we first found it and it's always a big hit.

I would really love this recipe if it contained the second topping of a lemon curd over the sour cream topping that is originally in the recipe that is why it was called double lemon cheesecake. I tried it back in 1991 out of the bon appetit magazine and it was to die for. Can you please include the full recipe since it seems that I have misplaced that recipe and have been looking for it ever since.

Loved it. It was quite the hit. It's lighter than some chesecakes and the lemon is divine.

Not too difficult, even for this beginner. Great Flavor! But the consistency was a bit soupy, so the topping and filling mixed at that step and it has been a bit difficult to serve. Any advice from you experts? I may try again with seven-eights cup of lemon juice rather than a full cup.

This is the best recipe ever. An excellent recipe for beginners because you don't need a special pan. I use a purchased graham cracker crust for convenience. Omitting the zest does not change the flavor. Do try it!

I have one word to describe this dish....YUMMY! It's really great. I made my own crust and it still turned out great. I highly recommend it for anyone!

I liked this recipe. I doubled the recipe and baked it with a traditional crust in traditional pan. I turned out great.

Very easy and my family loves this recipe. I make my own graham cracker crust, though. I'm surprised I'm the first to rate this one. It's great!
