These were amazing! I used vanilla ice cream with added sliced strawberries instead of the strawberry ice cream. They were creamy, sweet, tart, and perfect!

This was pretty darn good!! It was a bit sweet for me, so next time I will just add more milk!

Oh boy, these are so awesome. The strawberry syrup is amazing - I used the leftovers to pour over vanilla bean ice cream later, and it is delicious. Definitely a treat to look forward to in strawberry season! I have also tried 2% milk in the shakes and it works fine. (I used slightly less so they stay thick.) For the strawberry ice cream, I used Haagen Dazs.

Very fresh and natural. Not overly sweet and heavy like most ice-cream based milk shakes that I've had. It's been a big hit with both kids and adults.
