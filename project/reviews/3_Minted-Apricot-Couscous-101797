I really thought this was OK. It was fine as a side dish, but really didn't stand up alone. I like the other dried apricot and couscous recipes on this site, so I'll just stick with them in the future!

This was very good,but I made a lot of modifications as suggested by other reviewers. I used chicken stock instead of water, added a cinamon stick, 1T honey, 2t cumin, no cucumber, and about 4 oz. of mixed dried fruit bits. With these changes, it was moist and yummy.

I made a mistake and added more honey than stated in the recipe, but it was a happy accident! The honey added flavor intensity to an otherwise light summertime dish.

This is so delicious! A great summertime side dish.

I've made this several times and everyone always raves. I do add more mint and apricots. Next time I will take the other reviewers advice and try chicken stock also. I think the cucumber is a good addition for some different texture.

I enjoyed this recipe, and would make it again--with these changes. Substitute chicken stock for the water. Double the cumin. Use 8 dried apricots instead, for more flavor. Drop the cucumber--does not add anything. Finally use 1/4 to 1/3 cup (depending on your tastes) chopped mint.

What a terrible disappointment!!I served it with the Maple Glazed Salmon and Sesame Broccoli & Spinach. It definitely added NOTHING to the meal. Won't do it again.

I made this several days in advance, hoping the flavors would have time to sink in. Even after several days, the dish was rather bland. It certainly sounded better than it tasted. I'm not sure how to add more flavor....
