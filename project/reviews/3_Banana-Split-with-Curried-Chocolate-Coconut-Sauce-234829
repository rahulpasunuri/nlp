I loved the chocolate sauce, but didn't think that the dish was worth all of the work. Perhaps I didn't use enough sauce? I thought that it tasted like a normal banana split with just a hint of spices.

I made small versions of this recipe in the plastic wine cups for a fund raising event with a Carribean theme and they were a huge hit. Then upon request I did the same thing for a graduation party and was bombarded with requests for the recipe for the chocolate sauce. I wouldn't change a thing and I will definitely make them again.

CANNED pineapple.. ugh... try a little well- drained fresh pineapple... much nicer flavor :) I love that this was SO different... no one could guess what was in the sauce! Delicious, too.

This was really nice, though we tried it without ice cream because it didn't freeze in time. The curry, rum, coconut, and lime are fairly subtle, not at all in your face. This would be a great way to introduce people to Carribean flavours. We didn't like it with canned pineapple tidbits, it seemed too acidic. Next time we'll try it with a small amount of crushed pineapple to see if that's better.

Too much rum, that plus the curry made the chocolate sauce bitter? sour?. It's only saving grace was that in combination with the ice cream and fruit it was edible, but still hardened too quickly into clumps. I won't make this again.

Unbelievable!! The chocolate sauce was "to die for"!! The subtle flavors of rum, coconut, lime and curry create an extremely intriguing and satisfying flavor. And it goes great with the banana split. Next time I make it, I would offer the pineapple on the side because I think it detracts from the intricate and fabulous flavor of the rest of the dish.
