We have had this twice in the past week because it was so tasty. Could not find the watercress so used arugula and romaine. We wouldn't change anything, especially the dressing. Yummy.

Super yummy! DH says more bacon, but it really is perfect as is. I've made it for two different special occasions and each time to rave reviews and requests for the recipe.

It's a bit of work, but worth it for special friends! The only changes I've made are to use a lot less dressing, and I substitute Maytag Blue for the Roquefort. Other than that, I make it according to the recipe!

Rave reviews from the extended family at last night's BBQ. Few minor modifications- doubled the red wine vinegar, garlic and Dijon and only used half the amount of olive oil. Grill my chicken on the BBQ with lots of BBQ sauce to add a bit of smokiness to it. Added strawberries, blueberries and english peas. Well worth the effort!

Easy and delicious! Made exactly according to recipe except we grilled boneless skinless chicken thighs for some added flavor. The salad dressing was delicious as well. We will definitely be making this again!

Truly an amazing salad. The dressing, with that fresh garlic taste, is the perfect complement. We sauted the chicken breasts in the bacon fat and then baked to finish. There's also plenty of flavor without the blue cheese. Lamb's ear is a good substitute for the watercress.

This recipe was really good. We just substituted rice wine vinegar for red wine vinegar. We also left off the blue cheese, and it still tasted great. Will make again.

This is a great go to recipe for a cobb salad. A few modification: I chopped the bacon layer coursely because I prefer bigger flavor punch of bacon. Also substituted mixed baby greens for the watercress layer and a danish blue cheese instead of gorgonzola. I steamed the chicken for 10 minutes and let set off heat covered for another 10. I also went with a less healthy homemade ranch dressing which was fantastic, except for the additional calories!

This was great - served for a light dinner at a beach house after an afternoon of grazing of the beach goers. It could serve 6 easily, 8 with sides, it would be a LOT for four people.

This was the first time I ever made a cobb salad and it was a delicious success! All of the flavors blended so well and the dressing was as good as any I've had at any restaurant. The only thing I did differently was that I layered the salads individually onto each plate instead of doing it in a big bowl. Then I spooned the dressing onto each serving. Perfect!

This salad was amazing - healthy and satisfying. I used regular red-wine vinegar, but only one tb and the dressing was creamy and delicious

Just a note for the less experienced or those of us not thinking too clearly. I used a balsamic vinegar in my first batch of dressing as others suggested. I came out looking like gravy. I couldn't bring myself to put it on my beautiful salad. Use a white balsamic. I ended up using a black raspberry vinegar and it was fabulous.

Made this salad for a baby shower for 30 people. I assembled it in a rectangular glass baking dish with about 3 inch sides. I mixed in some baby romaine leaves which gave it a great look. I doubled the dressing, using a black raspberry vinegar and feta cheese in one batch and made a sweeter dressing and blue cheese in the other batch. I made rows of each ingredient on top completely covering the romaine -first grape tomatos, halved, then bacon,then chicken, then avocados, then eggs etc. Just before serving, lightly drizzled dressing over the top with extra to be added if someone wanted it.It looked beautiful and no need to toss. Everyone just took what they wanted. Everyone raved!

Not only did this salad make a colorful and festive presentation for one of my Luncheon Salads, it was a centerpiece! Everyone loved it, and enjoyed it so very much. We live in an area where I have access to fresh pecans and I toasted some of them and added a sweet cinnamon sugar glaze, then topped the salad with them. Boy, did that ever bring it up a notch! I also used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 walnut oil for the dressing. I loved the watercress, but if you can't find it at your grocery store, I think fresh spinach mixed with arugla might be just the ticket for a substitution.

This is a great cobb salad. I add shallots to the dressing if I have them, also sub balsamic for the red wine vinegar and omit sugar as a result, and sub anchovy paste for the salt. Layered is the way to go, especially on a weeknight. My husband enjoys this salad.

I just made this for some friends and they loved it. The presentation makes it impressive and a good use of knife skills. I tweaked with the dressing, which I found slightly overpowering as written

Great simple salad! I served Roquefort, Feta and crumbled goat cheese on the side in order to accommodate tastebuds with no taste. : ) Cobb salad in ONE DISH? I'll take it! And make it again for sure!

A delightful Cobb! My husband went from "we're only going to have salad for dinner?" to "this is delicious!". Halved the recipe for 2, but used 2 hard-boiled eggs. Used balsamic. Used grilled boneless thighs. A definite keeper.

Excellent.

Delicious, just as everyone else says. Used balsamic, as advised. I used two heads of romaine, which gave me 10 cups chopped, and I thought this was a good amount. I think one average size head would be too little.

I absolutely agree with the previous reviewers that this is a delicious salad for those warm summer days. The dressing is especially nice. We don't like Roquefort so I made a successful substitution with a good Greek Feta.

I made this for a group of friends, as individual serves, then offered a choice of dressings on the side. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. It was so simple to put together that I was almost embarrassed that they would see that there wasn't any great trick to it.

I had a surprise birthday party (for about 20 people) and was unsure of what was being served. I made this and it was a HIT!!! Doubled the recipe, however, only put 1 1/4 dressing on salad. Left the rest next to the salad in case people wanted more dressing. Wonderful!!!

I love this recipe! I've made this recipe numerous times since discovering it and have placed the salad dressing in memory for use with other salads. Wonderful!

I made this for 40 woman at a baby shower and it was a big hit. I used balsamic vinegar as suggest by many reviewers and received numerous requests for the dressing recipe. I must say that making it for that many people made the prep time quite comsuming, but well worth it.

First time making or having cobb salad - it was really good! Had to make some substitutions for the greens b/c I couldn't find all of them - we used romaine and arugula.

Rating: 3
Very good. We have kept this for a year and decided to try this evening. We halved exactly for two people. Used left over roast chicken but other than that made no changes. It reminds me of the salad I had at Wolfgang Pucks at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. May try Balsemic vinegar next time, and there will be a next, but really can't imagine that it could be any better. Half of the recipe was fine for two large salad only meals. Try this one.

It looks very nice but of course you have to toss it! Flavours meld beautifully. And to Lisa from Arizona - you are so right about the avocado. Leaving it out is like omitting the chocolate chips in chocolate chip cookies!

This is a very good salad that serves well as a week day meal. It is a little on the mushy side though. Next time I will omit the avocados and see if that makes a difference. I also used the balsamic vinegar for the dressing.

This was very good. The method for cooking the chicken yielded excellent results for chicken in a salad preparation--very tender and moist. I have been using that method for many cold chicken dishes in the hot summer weather.

Fabulous salad!! I too used the balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar for the dressing; other than that I wouldn't change a thing. My husband loves Cobb Salad and he said this was the best he's ever tasted. It's definitely a keeper.

Good stuff. My end product came out on the oily side, but I think that is partially due to a a small head of romaine. When I make it again, I'll start with 3/8 cup olive oil.

Fantastic . Used leftover grilled chicken, spinach and romaine. I too enjoyed the final word in this recipe ("toss") enough to pass the beautiful picture of the layered salad around at the dinner table. We all laughed and ended up tossing anyway for lack of a glass photo-op bowl.

We really enjoyed this recipe, we used grilled chicken and thought it was great.

Outstanding! Substantial enough for a meal, yet light enough for hot weather. When watercress is unavailable, I substitute baby spinach leaves, which is just as tasty. Try baking the chicken breasts in a honey/lemon/rosemary mix for an added taste sensation. Mmmmmmm!

Terrific. The watercress was a lot of work but worth it. A nice combination of flavors. My guests loved it!

This recipe in one version or another has been my daughter's very favorite recipe since she was 5. For children I skip the blue cheese, and just use baby swiss or even american while for adults the very best blue. The whole thing is a fun meal on a hot night. I do not "layer" it but present it all on each plate allowing each diner to assemble, although my preference is to use the method presented here!

I made this salad vegetarian (without meat, but keeping the cheese) for large party and it was terrific. To answer the question about the dressing from San Jose - I just drizzled the dressing over it lightly and put the dressing on the side for those who wanted more. This is my new "fave!"

Rating: 4
This is an outstanding salad. I halved the recipe to accommodate two, and simply "layered" the ingredients on individual plates. The dressing was served separately so that each person could put on the amount that he/she desires. It's pretty and delicious and would make a great luncheon dish for a special occasion.

This recipe sounds great, but I can't help smile at the irony of having a "layered salad" that I have to toss in the end because of the dressing.

Very nice salad! I made it an easier midweek dinner by using the grilled prepackaged chicken strips from the grocery, and bagged romaine lettuce. The dressing was very tasty and the salad was beautiful. You need a glass bowl so that you can appreciate the presentation!
