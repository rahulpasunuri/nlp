I substituted crawfish for the lobster. I think that I would use a little less mayo and add something with a bit of heat, like hot sauce or Zaterain's Shrimp & Crab boil, to the filling. I found that it tasted better after it cooled down and had a bit of time to rest.

No "ñ" in empanadas, you epicurean hyperforeignists! Regardless, this recipe was not impressive at all. There are simpler ways to showcase lobster.

I used crab in place of lobster but the simple cream cheese dough on this site (which rocks, is flaky and simple). Tasty!

i didn't much care for the flavor of these. traditional chicken or beef would've tasted better.
