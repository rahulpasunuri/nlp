Well that was easy  and surprisingly good. I think it's the orange zest that makes it (I added a little more). We served it alongside a chiffonade-cut kale salad  perfect for a mid-week supper. I wish I had made extra to freeze.

To my surprise, I liked this. (I had thought that it would be bland ...) I made it as directed, with the exception of adding two cloves of garlic to the onion before adding the chili powder. Be sure to use diced tomatoes that contain green chiles and don't omit the orange zest; the zest really pulls everything together. Let it sit and meld together for the best flavor!

The flavors didn't come together for me until we added slices of vegetarian "Smart Sausages", smoked style. We enjoyed it served over bulghur.

Prepared X4 based on the reviews and glad I did. We loved it and so happy I have some to freeze for later, and some for later in the week :) Added bell peppers.

Very good, especially for how very easy it was to prepare! I used black beans in place of the pintos and cut the orange peel to 1 tsp (it's very strong). Especially good if you use a pure chili powder - not a blend

This recipe was so good. I followed the recipe exactly but added a tbs of cinnamon. It was very exceptional. It fed my little kiddos and adults without a complaint. Be bold and add the orange zest, it makes the dish.

This soup is wonderful! I've made it many times before and today I am making it for a big group. With minimal ingredients and using dried beans, it's a cheap, easy vegetarian meal to serve to a crowd!

Of course, the best thing about this recipe is the simplicity of the ingredients and the short time it takes to complete. But the results are quite lovely. A very nice autumn season alternative to the ubiquitous chili.

I liked this a lot, and enjoyed the ease of preparation/healthiness, but it was a little too sweet for my boyfriend. If you like mildly sweet things like Thai peanut curry (I do!), you would like this a lot, but if you find that too sweet, you'd probably find this too sweet. The orange flavor is really nice, but it also really brings out the sweetness of the sweet potato (and I only used 3/4 tsp). I'd definitely use less orange than called for in the recipe, and I think black beans as many have suggested would help cut the sweetness more than pinto beans do. I also think more fresh heat would help, like some serrano pepper.

I've never reviewed anything on Epicurious, but this is one amazing chili. I wasn't expecting much, as the ingredients are very simple, but this completely wowed me. The flavors are perfect together.

Rating: 4
As it stands, the town I live in is currently recovering from an epic snow storm and I therefore had to make due with Italian style tomatoes instead of the fire roasted tomatoes and leave out the cilantro at the end. After cooking the onions with jalapeno flakes, I let the sweet potatoes cook as instructed. Once the tomatoes and black beans (instead of pinto) were put in, I added about a teaspoon of cumin, a dash of dried sage, garlic powder (I had discovered that my garlic cloves died of old age), and a pinch of paprika. During this time, I browned a can of corn with crushed red pepper and added it to the mix. As a final touch, I added a splash of orange juice and proceeded to let the mixture simmer for another 5-10 minutes. After placing the chili in bowls, I spooned on a dollop of plain unsweetened yogurt and sprinkled some black pepper on top.

Rating: 4
So I read through many reviews and utilized some of the repeated favorites such as black beans, chipotle powder (1/2 dose of the chili powder), corn, garlic and fire roasted tomatoes. I did not delete anything in recipe; I also added my favorite, an anaheim chili pepper, sauted. Let me just say this may be the best chili I've ever had (except green chili which is a different animal)! I had leftover tangerine rind so that's what I used but was careful to not over-do it! It turned out perfect! Really wonderful and so many great flavours - I think the orange peel compliments the sweet potatoes!

Rating: 4
This was a great stew. I didn't have chili powder so I actually used paprika ( I think, I'm not even sure) and some chili sauce. I stewed my own tomatoes and put a little jalepeno but I don't think I had as much as the recipe called for. but anyway it was delicious (also according to my dinner companion). we put a little plain yogurt on top. highly recommended

I was looking for a interesting chili to take camping. This is a hit. I made three time the recipe, and used home made beans. Every thing froze quite well, thawed in the cooler and reheated on the camp stove. I got rave review and will make this again. I served with cilantro and sour cream for topping.

Rating: 2
This is a good, easy weeknight meal. The sweet potato makes it feel more substantial and "rib-sticking" than some other meatless chili recipes I've tried. I was worried that it would be too sweet, so I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out so complex and savory.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. I have made exactly as written several times and love it.

Rating: 3
Delicious and hearty. I followed other reviewers suggestion and used chipotle powder and cut down on the chili powder. Also added garlic, cumin, oregano in the beginning. I added half a bag of frozen spinach in the last two minutes of cooking. My carnivore husband loved it!

I've made this recipe many times since I first made it in 2002 and it never disappoints. I will say, I've never added the orange zest, it's delicious without it. I use chicken broth and Muir Glen Fire-Roasted tomatoes which add a really nice kick, along with the chili powder.

Rating: 4
This was excellent: fast, easy, and delicious. I made two very minor changes: (1) add one large clove of garlic, chopped, with the onion; and (2) add some red pepper flakes, for a bit of spice. This is a real keeper.

I didn't alter the recipe. The flavors didn't come together for me. I thought it was too sweet, but bland too. Lacked the hearty depth of a good chili. Still, okay- not bad.

Rating: 4
I made some modifications like everyone else... But I am using black beans instead of pinto, chipotle chili flakes instead of chili powder, and 2 large cans of Muir Glen Fire Roasted tomatoes and one 14 oz can of Rotel instead of the stewed tomatoes, using lime zest instead of orange peel, and started off with add celery, garlic and carrots. I quadrupled the recipe which is why the amounts above are a lot more. Used lots of cilantro at the end...that made the recipe.

Rating: 4
Great recipe to build on. I doubled the recipe starting with 3 tbsp bacon fat instead of 1 tbsp olive oil. Instead of Chili powder, I added chipotle powder and smoked paprika. Instead of all pinto beans, I did 1/2 kidney beans. At the end I added cracked pepper, fleur de sel and 1 tblsp tomato paste. Muah! Bon Appetite!

Rating: 4
A great variation on chili! I too made it with black beans, which I nearly always prefer to pinto. As written the recipe does make enough for two very large servings. With an extra diced chili and some fresh corn tortillas it was a perfect, simple dinner.

This was tasty and the best part is how fast it is to make. Perfect for an after work quick dinner. I wish I had cilantro, it would have been better with it, but what I found in the store was flavorless so I left it out.

This was a really easy recipe to make, and even the kids liked it. We loved how you could taste the hidden subtlety of the orange peel, it really added to the sweetness of the dish.

This is what I love about Epicurious- I had a can of pinto beans and some sweet potatoes so I plugged that in and got this recipe. The second time I made this I used black beans, lots of lime zest and lime juice, and hot red chili powder and it was so good! Better than with orange and pintos. Try it...

Rating: 4
I was weary about this recipe initially, but it was fantastic. I subbed black beans for pinto, upped the chili powder, and per other reviews, cut the orange in half. It was amazing. Even my meat-loving fiancee loved it. I was able to make it in my slow cooker (12 hours on low), which was a plus. It's so delicious, easy, and economical, that it will definately make its way into my regular rotation.

I liked this dish a lot. We used black beans, and garlic, and a finely diced jalapeno. At the end I thinned the chili with a tablespoon or 2 of orange juice. Delicious!

Yum! The orange peel & cilantro gave this chili a nice flavor. Made with small red beans (dry) & used the bean water for stock. Added garlic & celery. I only had a can of 'regular' tomatoes, so i also added some basil, cumin, & cayenne.

This has become a standard in my monthly meal rotation. Very easy, inexpensive, and flavorful. I prefer black beans to pintos, and always add a bit of cinnamon to the mix. Yum.

I'm with the other reviewers on the orange zest. I used probably less than half what the recipe called for, and it still totally dominated the flavors. If I make it again I'll probably leave it out altogether.

I also made this subbing plantains (ripe but not black) for the sweet potato and black beans for the pinto. For that, I used a little cinnamon and a square of chocolate (72%) to kick the flavors up.

For the spice, I used ancho chili flakes, coriander, cumin, and cinnamon. I tasted it, and it was very good! Then, against my better judgment, I added the orange zest. All I tasted was orange. I'll make this again, but definitely without the orange!

My boyfriend and I loved this for a lighter, flavorful meal. I used vegetable broth and added garlic with the onion and then baby bella mushrooms. I skipped the orange peel and added a bit of cumin and soy sauce along with kosher salt and pepper. Yum.

Surprise - we loved this chili. Made it for a vegan guest. Now I make it for meat-eaters,too. Used chipotle chili powder.

I am not a vegan, or even vegetarian so maybe just don't have the right palate for this dish. But it seemed to lack the depth that meat can contribute. All the flavors are fresh, bright, and compliment each other nicely, but I think next time I will add a hamhock while the chili simmers, or toss in some kielbasa as another reviewer suggests (hmm...I wonder if even liquid smoke might help round it out). At very least, I think I;ll top my leftovers with a bit of sour cream. A potentially great recipe, but needs some work.

I liked this dish, except that it was too sweet and not spicy enough for my taste. I think next time I will add less orange zest. I also made some modifications- I added garlic, red bell pepper and jalapeno with the oil and onion. I also added kale with the sweet potato and broth, and I added corn at the end with the beans. I really liked the addition of the kale. Yummy!

I just wanted to say that I love this recipe! It so good. But, I tweaked mine some. Instead of pinto I used Dark Red Kidney Beans. I also added garlic into the oil but took it out before adding the onion. I also added mushrooms for just a little bit more. I also upped the broth and the tomatoes to make it thicker. But, I always say that a recipe is just a starting point. Put what you know you like into something you havent tried before and almost always you will like the outcome.

Rating: 3
This was a tasty dish. I, too, followed the advice of one of the reviewers and used McCormick's Chipotle Chili powder. I failed to see that others had used 1/2 the amount called for, so my dish came out VERY spicy. Use less of the chipotle powder than the amount of regular chili powder called for in the original recipe, and the dish is an intersting combination of flavors. The orange peel is a nice compliment to the cilantro and the smokiness of the chipotle.

Rating: 3
My vegetarian boyfriend and I loved this recipe, and it was super-easy. I wasn't able to find Mexican-style stewed tomatoes in my grocery, so I substitued Muir Glen Fire-Roasted diced tomatoes and a small can of mild green chilis. Instead of chili powder, I used about a teaspoon of ground chipotle pepper plus a few shakes of ground cumin and ground oregano (for a double recipe). I have a feeling that this recipe will become a cozy fall/winter dinner staple -- quick to prepare, inexpensive, and very healthful and satisfying.

I have made this twice in the last week and each time it was a hit! I made it originally because I had limited ingredients in the house. I was skeptical at first, especially at the addition of cilantro, but I was very very pleasantly surprised. The sweet potatoes add something just amazing to this. I used Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes and a can of Milder Rotel (note: rotel is 10oz, so that's 5 or 6 oz less than recipe calls for). It was plenty spicy for a crowd. I also used vegan veg base b/c I was serving a vegan, and it worked great. Oh, and I cooked it longer than recommended b/c cornbread wasn't ready yet and I think that made a difference (but still added cilantro @ the last minute to avoid bitterness).

Mine turned out a little sweet - I didn't drain the pinto beans. My husband loved this and it took 10 min or less to assemble. Don't overdo the orange peel like I did. The cilantro is yummy. Next time I'll try the chipotle recommendation.

Rating: 3
This is an excellent dish with simple yet elegant flavors. I found a smoked chipolte chili powder at a gourmet shop near my house and used that instead of regular chili powder. The result was a richer, deeper chili taste. This recipe is great - yet I feel that it is missing something that could make it perfect - perhaps some corn or chopped carrots? In any case, it's easy and certainly worth the small amount of time it takes to make it!

We have seven non-vegetarians and one vegetarian in our book group. Our meetings are a monthly challenge to find a dinner that everyone will enjoy. This recipe was the hands down favorite so far this year. Served with cornbread and a salad with red onion, black olives and oranges it was a true feast.

I was surprised by the inclusion of orange zest, sweet potatoes, and cilantro in this chili recipe, but the reviews made me want to try it out. It was good immediately after cooking - but after allowing it to sit overnight in the refrigerator, it was excellent! The orange zest was still palpable but blended well with the other ingredients, in total harmony. I gave it to everyone and they loved it too. I'm definitely going to be making this one again. I followed the instructions exactly. Unlike most other chilis, I don't think sour cream would improve this chili.

Fantastic! I make it often, but leave out the orange zest... much better without it.

Personally, I really liked it. But I made it and served it at two barbeques (one attended be hard-core carnivores, and one attended by a lot of vegetarians), and it didn't go over well at either. My husband thought the flavor of the sweet potato was drowned out by the rest of the flavors. I love the fresh cilantro!

Rating: 4
Suprisingly VERY good. I did not care for the addition of sour cream as some suggested. It took away from the complexity of flavors in the dish. I would recommend that you try it first without, and then add if you wish. The dish is even better reheated the next day.

This is really very good!! And, very easy to put together with the canned tomatoes and beans. I doubled the recipe easy enough, but probably used the 1 and a half tsp. of orange peel still, and thought that was plenty. This was great with a little dollop of sour cream on the top. Cannot wait for leftovers for lunch tommorrow!!

Oddly enough I didn't like this much the first night we tried it. The orange zest flavour was too strong and the rest just didn't seem that interesting. However....the next day it was delicious! I guess the flavours just need time to meld. I would definitely make it again but would do it a day ahead. I thought the corn tortillas were awful (first time I'd had them) and wouldn't include them again. I'd definitely make a home-baked cornbread with this. The salad was a great side dish - even though I couldn't find jicama for love or money in any of my local markets.

I tried this with keilbasa as well and it turned out quite well. I doubled up on the recipe to save some for the future, but not the liquid and I still found it to be too much. I will probably make this again, but with half the liquid or possibly no broth. Still, the sweetness of the potatoes offsets the spicyness nicely and makes for a good dish in cool weather.

Fantastic! Sweet potatoes always seem to make the dish. Anyway, I also had to cook the potatoes for approx 15 min to attain the desired tenderness. Definitely don't skimp on the cilantro or orange peel. Fresh cilantro was a pretty garnish -- and good way to use up the leftover cilantro.

Perfect for the winter. I added some kielbasa to it ( I love meat - sue me!), and it was really excellent. I just sliced it up and added it to the onions while they were sauteing. The dish is very hearty, and the orange zest adds a very subtle and sweet overtone. Good stuff!

I made this for my vegan brother and the rest of my family (meateaters) thought it was delicious too. I doubled it and didn't add much orange peel, but you could definitely taste it--one person thought it made the dish. I had to cook mine longer for the sweet potatoes to get completely tender. I served it with the spinach salad w/ pear and avocado and green chili corn bread. Very good.

A delightfully light alternative to chili! I wound up substituting crumbled tofu for onions (my husband is anti-onion), adding a bit of cumin, and a few splashes of oatmeal stout. I also added a bit of masa harina to thicken and smooth the soupiness at the end. A great recipie to build on and get creative with! I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

Great recipe! I stay away from cane sugar so instead of using Mexican stewed tomatoes, I used plain stewed tomatoes and added Pace Medium Picante Sauce - which gave it the "Mexican" flavor.

Despite sounding odd, this turned out very well. Folks who like spicy stuff however should consider adding some additional hot stuff as the recipe itself will leave your mouth only mildly hot.
