This is a four-seasons recipe - you can always get good celery and even edible radishes no matter where you live. It's light and cool in the summertime, and a nice little side dish in the winter. I like to pair it with the shellfish chowder, a Gourmet recipe from a few years back, along with crusty bread.

Whoever loves this recipe must really like celery. I made half of the recipe and it was still too much for 2 as a side.

A wonderful summertime salad that lends itself to many variations. I had it exactly as the recipe directs; next time I'm going to try adding some feta cheese. I also like the suggestion of adding tuna to make it a complete meal. So many experiments....

I originally made this recipe as described and we loved it. I now make it with chopped radishes, an equal amount of celery, sometimes cucumber, more olives, and increase the dressing amount. I have added tuna to the leftover for lunch and it was fabulous. Highly recommended!

The celery leaves were a nice change from lettuce-based salads. I added some cucumber for extra freshness!

What a delightful little salad.. Healthy and low in calories. And so easy to make. I think next time I'll add a bit more olives. This one's a keeper.
