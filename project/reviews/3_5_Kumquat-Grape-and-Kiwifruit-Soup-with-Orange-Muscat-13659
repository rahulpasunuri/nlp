Cold fruit soup for dessert...novel idea. This was fairly quick and easy, aided by having seedless black grapes. Nice and sweet for a pleasant finish to the meal. I substituted Muscat de Baume de Venise, but it is close enough. Served the same wine with the soup. This is what to do with a whole bottle of Baume de Venise...serve a glass with fois gras as an appetizer, use some in the soup, and have some with the soup for dessert. Yum.

A wonderful, light and refreshing finish to a spicy meal. I put a small scoop of lemon sorbet in each shallow desert bowl, then ladled the chilled soup around it.
