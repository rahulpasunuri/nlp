This dish definitely needs to be cooked a little longer at a higher temperature. Perhaps adding one less egg would firm it up a bit? It needs lots of salt and pepper, and perhaps a hint of nutmeg.

I love potatoes and I like chard, but this missed the mark for me. It is an interesting idea, and the terrine looked nice, but the flavor was just not there.

This recipe tasted wonderful and looked quite pretty on a platter at the table. It is not, however, a classic terrine; the consistency was such that it could not be cut with a knife, because it was too soft. We had to use a spoon, but it tasted excellent. We ended up raising the heat by 25 degrees and cooking it for an extra 20 minutes, as it wasn't cooked through.
