This is a wonderful recipe. However, for a healthier dish reduce butter by half and use grape seed oil for the other half. My husband loved it even though we had never cooked with saffron before.

The person from San Diego who laughed so hard at 'saffron infused water' is obviously totally ignorant of the subtile yet powerful flavour of saffron.

I loved this recipe. I added extra saffron and after browning the potatoes I cooked them until tender with the lid on turning once. They were well colored by the saffron and browning. I then finished them under the broiler and they were delicious. Extra saffron is a must.

I agree with the previous reviewers. I have cooked potatoes similarly to this recipe but using turmeric in the water instead of saffron (!!!) which will also give a golden color to the potatoes but for a fraction of the price. Saffron is too delicate a flavor (and too expensive!) to be wasted like this.

This recipe looks like a complete waste of time and effort. Besides the issue that good saffron is expensive...you wouldn't be able to taste it the way the recipe calls for it. In fact, it's ridiculous....'saffron infused water"...HA! What a joke!

Frankly, I found this recipe to be rather bland and not worth the trouble. I made it because I have a ton of saffron that I need to use, but the saffron taste wasn't very strong even though I used quite a bit more than what the recipe calls for. The potatoes were fine, perfectly edible, but I would have been happier just roasting them with some fresh herbs, salt, and olive oil instead.
