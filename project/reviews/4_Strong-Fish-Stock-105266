Great stock, with rich flavourful and is fast and easy to make. I had no fish heads but used frames from halibut and replaced celery with fennel. Love it!

Excellent stock, used it as a base for bouillabaisse.

This was perfect, rich but not overpowering, just right in every way. I only had salmon heads, bones, tails and used dill (forgot to buy the parsley). It made my salmon chowder a complete success, can only recommend this!!!!!!!!!!!

This was very easy to make and perfect for the shrimp bisque I made. ( I added a pound of shrimp shells as well)

This is s great recipe. I grew up and still live in coastal New England to a family of fisherman/lobsterman. Sometimes I want to bring the family recipes into the 21st century. I used Stripper, flounder heads and bones and some cleaned out lobster bodies. The stripper was frozen from the fall. It is a great recipe. I am going to use it again and again. i love the other reviews, I am going to try it in a risotto like another reviewer suggested

I made a double recipe of this stock with a few minor changes. Did not use any bay leaf and used a couple of king mackerel fish frames along with a half of dozen fish heads. The results were incredible and this base for fish chowder is incredible. Made a fish risotto with extra five cups of stock from the double recipe. The flavors were so rich and tantalizing. Can't wait for the next fishing occasion to make more of this incredible fish stock.

Great stock. I used this recipe with a couple of additions. I sweated left over shrimp shells and lobster tail (smashed with a mallot) with the vegetables. This was done in an 8 quart pressure cooker as I was doubling the recipe. I replaced 1 onion with 1 leek. I included 1 jalapeno pepper for organic heat plus the juice of 1 lemon. A 4 X 5 piece of Kombu kelp was included to give it that "from the ocean" taste. I used 1 cup Sake instead of white wine. Since I was preparing this in the pressure cooker I used cold water. I placed the pressur cooker on medium high heat and at temperature let it steam for 10 minutes. I use this stock for my cioppino and it get raves. I'm on my 5th Annual Super Bowl Cioppino Party using this stock foundation.

I'm a professional chef and this is the best stock I've made at home. I use a combination of leftover trout and snapper frames and heads as they're available to me and the outcome is richer and more mellow than when I tried it with haddock. To be honest, to use this stock in a chowder is almost a waste as the cream overpowers the finese of the stock. I feel a better use is to do what the Hungarians do and add a little paprika and some chunks of whatever fish happens to be on sale. Simmer it until the fish is cooked through and you've got a really good, quick, and easy soup for friends or when you get home from work (assuming you made the stock ahead of time in which case all you have to do is heat it).

This made a wonderfully rich stock. My fish market sold the heads with some bones, but would not sell me just bones. Using primarily heads in this worked fine.

Phenomenal recipe--made all the difference in the world to my fish chowder. Used striped bass that I caught on a fishing trip. I didn't save the heads, so I just used about four pounds of bones, fins and tails that I chopped into large pieces with a cleaver. Make sure you pour the white wine down the edge of your pot--I initially just dumped it in and it all pooled up on the fish, so I ended up adding more...then again, what recipe isn't better with more wine?
