I made the roasted red pepper version of this recipe minus the capers. I made it the day before, and did not think it was overly garlicky. The texture was really nice, but the flavor was unimpressive. Not bad, but not noticeable. I may try making it again sticking closer to the main recipe.

I made this a day in advance. The next day the garlic was almost overwhelming. I took it to a family gathering and brought home nearly as much as I took.

SOme thought this was really good. I found it not so good. It really was muddled with respect to flavors; nothing stood out.

This was one of the most disappointing appetizers I have ever made. For all the preparation and ingredients it ended up tasting and looking like a taco dip with a few chunky bits. The texture and colour made it wholly unappetising.

This spread is wonderful. The flavors are deep and smoky, rich and unusual. I made the recipe exactly as written and would recommend it to others without reservation. I think you could serve it with crudites as well as with baguette toasts.
