I didn't make this recipe but just had to comment about the description Self gave it "Opt for those farmed in the United States". Farmed fish is the worst kind of fish you could go for! Lice breeds inside the nets. That's pretty bad advice coming from a healthy magazine...just sayin.

Quick grits can be found in the breakfast cereal area. Quaker makes a good brand.

It's hard to find real grits up in Canada. I substitute polenta - rough ground corn meal. It doesn't have the acidity of real lye-treated hominy, but in recipes like this one with other flavors like cheese, it's still tasty.

The recipe sounds delicious. However, please think twice about using farmed shrimp, domestic or foreign. Farmed shrimp have a high level of antibiotics, used to prevent diseases that would normally flourish in their densely packed farms without them. They are also fed either grain based meal grown with antibiotics and pesticides, or they are fed fish meal. Fish meal is ground up pogie (fish) which is caught by methods that wreak havock on the ocean floor and remove tons, literally, of fish from the food chain. Pogie fishing also produces tremendous by-catch of fish soon to become endangered species. Use wild caught US shrimp if you're in the USA, and keep the use of it for special occasions, as wild caught shrimp has it's own draw backs.

Shirley, grits are basically ground hominy/corn. It is located in supermarket in the hot cereal aisle with items like Cream of Wheat, Malt-o- Meal and Farina. Down South it is a very popular breakfast item.
