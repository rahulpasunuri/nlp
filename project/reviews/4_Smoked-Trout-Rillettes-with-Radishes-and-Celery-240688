This recipe works with smoked whitefish and I imagine other smoked fish. good as is but you can always add some other condiments: capers, chopped shallots, cornichons etc. we used leftovers on crusty bagettes for lunch. There is rarely any leftover. yum.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit. I use smoked albacore instead of trout just because that is what my local market carries, and sometimes red onion instead of green.

I made this with some Alaskan smoked salmon my boyfriend's mother gave us -- doubled the recipe (and generous with the lemon juice) to use as an hors d'oeuvre at my Christmas party. It was gone in no time! Amazingly delicious and creamy, yet still light b/c of the mascarpone. Pumpernickel was the perfect compliment, though a friend finished the bowl with a spoon. Will definitely make again.

Made this exactly as written and it was outstanding. The mascarpone was a nice change from cream cheese. The fresh dill and quality smoked trout makes all the difference. Served this for Thanksgiving and it's now a standard for holiday appetizers!

The flavour was nice but it wasn't very special or original for a dinner party. Worst of all, my mascarpone separated (I made it the day before as suggested) so it was watery at the bottom of the bowl. No, I won't make it again.

The key to this recipe is to follow it exactly. Made it with leftover trout from the package and guessed at the amounts and it was not nearly as good. Follow the recipe exactly and it is absolutely great.

This recipe is so easy that it is embarrassing and so good that you want to eat it with a spoon.

This was okay, but a little bland. Easy to make, though. And easy to eat at a party, especially with the celery.

As others have said, this is a dead easy recipe to make. The radishes are lovely with it as well a good dark, pumpernickel rye. I brought this to a friends and served it with a lovely New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc-Kim Crawford Estates (couldn't find the Napa wine reco mentioned). It was a lovely start to a dinner party - not filling and appropriately appetite enducing!

Brought this to our family T-Day and served with sliced radishes and endive. It was awesome! And with plenty of competing appetizers on the table, it was the first plate licked clean. Couldn't have been simpler to prepare.

I was initially skeptical about this recipe as it did not sound particularly appealing, but I was planning to make most of the other items on the menu, so I thought I'd try it. The recipe was incredibly easy to make and the rillettes tasted so good that the bowl was virtually licked clean.

Outstanding and as easy as it sounds. A total keeper. Served it in radicchio leaves, which looked lovely.

Made this for hors d'oeuvres and got rave reviews. I added some more dill and about 1 tbsp of chopped shallot. I also added some maple syrup to balance out some fo the flavours. Great dish!

I thought this was outstanding. I used less fish, but had enough left over to make the recipe two nights in a row...everyone loved it and wanted it TWICE:).

This is really good when made as written, but can easily be jazzed up a bit with hot sauce or other simple additions.
