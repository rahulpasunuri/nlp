I used plum tomatoes for the confit, and an assortment of red and yellow cherry and mini-plums for the marinated bit. I used rocket as my leaf topping, the peppery flavour worked perfectly. I thought the recipe both looked and tasted stunning, as did my guests. The leftover marinade makes a beautiful salad dressing, I just add some lemon juice or white wine vinegar to lighten it up.

Great recipe. Made exactly as written except I used a variety of tomatoes in both the confit and the marinated. I chopped the Marinated tomatoes and I did not peel them, only de- seeded them. Very pretty as well.

Based on previous reviews, I only made the confit, intending to serve it as an appetizer with some salad leaves and bruschetta. I used heirloom and roma tomatoes and ended up with a kind of sauce-like mush (I presume the heirlooms contain too much water for this recipe). We scrapped it for our appetizer and made a quick caprese salad instead. BUT, I stirred the confit through some cooked linguine and discovered the best pasta sauce I have ever made. Beautiful flavors. Oh yes, and good with champagne!

Simple, rich in flavor, gorgeous. The excess marinade can be saved as a base for bruschetta, or a salad dressing. Perfect for any party or picnic. Only make when tomatoes are in season, though, or you cheat yourself.

This is beautiful! I;m giving it 4 forks, mostly because of the tomato confit. It is fabulous!! I don't really understand the tart, though...it seemed out of place with the rest of it - too much crumbly-ness and buttery-ness. Maybe I had some wrong measurements somewhere, because there seemed to be too much thick tart. We ignored it after a while and ate the topping like salad, crumbling just a little fo the tart with it. And I wasn't sure of what to do with the marinade, so used part of it. But regardless, it was lovely and tasty, and I will make that confit over and over again. Addictive! If I were to make this salad again, I'd double the confit.

The general concept of this dish is good- the tomatoes look beautiful on the tart. The confit is excellent. Nevertheless, the marinated tomatoes left something to be desired (too oily and a bit of a waste of good tomato). Next time will make confit and serve with tomatoes tossed in just a little olive oil and basil.

A gorgeous, sumptuous first course that is surprisingly substantial. I use heirloom tomatoes for more intense flavor.

I must confess that I only made the tomato confit. It was luscious! I used an assortment of tomatoes grown in my backyard, including Roma, Brandywine and a few others, plus thyme from my herb garden and garlic grown by a neighbor. Wow!

A stunning presentation for a gorgeous, delicious starter. Various steps are easy but time-consuming; final assembly very fast and easy. The crust --which I made with European-style cultured butter, as recommended -- was delicious but extremely rich and crumbly, almost too rich for me (but I don't care for cheesecake, either, so judge for yourself). You definitely need that dry champagne to offset the richness of this tart!

Forgive me, as I haven't made this recipe in its entirety, but I feel I must comment on the tomato confit. It is SUPERB! I served it at a dinner party over sauteed sea bass, but everyone wanted more for to top their bread. A must try...and so easy!

The crust was difficult for me to roll out; but delicious as the base of the salad. Best of all was the tomato confit which could stand alone! In fact,M I made this a second time using the confit along with carmelized onions and wild mushrooms. Friends were awed at both servings!
