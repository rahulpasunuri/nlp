I found this recipe when I had some chicken in the 'fridge I absolutely had to use and a can of artichoke hearts in the pantry. This is the best thing about epicurious in my opinion; looking for a recipe using the two or three ingredients I have on hand. So, no fresh artichokes, no shallots, no fresh tarragon. Instead I used what I did have which were yellow onion, dried tarragon and my canned artichokes and you know what?...it was really, really tasty, quick and easy for a midweek meal. Capers would be good too, as suggested, but it didn't need them to give it more flavor. I can only imagine how good this would be if I'd followed the recipe but, honestly, I'll probably never go to that much trouble.

Next time I will include capers, and probably jarred artichokes-- not sure fresh was worth the effort. I used more flour and added garlic powder to the salt and pepper. I added another cup of chicken broth at the end and stirred in a pound of cooked capellini--- so good.

very nice recipe - slightly delicate in flavor from the tarragon (licorice/sweet). not my favorite, also had a lot of prep, but was good nonetheless.

Terrific. The tarragon and artichoke hearts taste almost like fennel, but more subtle - like shallots compare to onions. I didn't find the artichoke prep hard to do - about 5 minutes per 'choke if you're a quick knife. Of course, I only did 1 choke and 2 breasts, since it was just for 2 people. Free range organic chicken helped make the dish a success.

I admire anyone and everyone who actually goes through the labor of preparing fresh artichokes for this dish. I did not and instead was able to acquire freshly prepared artichoke quarters from a friend. This made a lovely little weeknight meal with all the lovely flavors of spring (or i suppose spring in southern California since artichokes are an early summer crop for the rest of the country). That said I certainly would not have and would not recommend preparing this dish if you are preparing your own artichokes. It is far too mush effort for the end result. But if you ever happen upon fresh prepared artichokes go for it.
