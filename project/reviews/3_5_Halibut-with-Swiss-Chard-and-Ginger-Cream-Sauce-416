Have made this multiple times for dinner parties and it's always been a hit. Looks elegant and with good quality halibut, flavors are sublime. The sauce is a bit thin. I add a bit more cream and have successfully substituted chicken broth for clam juice. Love this recipe!

I cannot get enough ginger so this dish was perfect. In an attempt to keep this otherwise exceptinally healthy dish a little lighter, we used half and half instead of whipping cream; it turned out fine. Also, be careful with times, we steamed for about 8 minutes but could have taken off a little sooner to keep the fish even flakier.

This dish was absolutley delicious. I am not a great fan of halibut, but if you like ginger, you will love this dish. I would recommend however, that you double the sauce. The sauce is excellent but you definitely need to double it for this dish. I would cook this dish again!

YUK! The only thing that can save this dish is to prepare your halibut some other way!

This was somewhat reminiscent of the tuna ginger cream dish on this site but delicious nonetheless. I thought it was super easy and fast too! Coincendentally I had all the ingredients on hand except for clam juice so I just doubled the wine and it came out fine. Served with the requisite asparagus, french rolls and dry Gewurztraminer as suggested and my husband said it was a "great meal"!

I'm looking forward to making this recipe, just wanted to say to the cook from Australia I always use fish stock(see recipes on this site) in place of clam juice because I think clam juice is vile. Fish stock gives good results.

yes this dish was very very good......delicious......3+ to 4...hard to rate any dish beyond compare, but I'll tell ya....rapping a piece of fresh halibut in chard & steaming it brings out a very tender, moist, healthy meal. & of course the creamy ginger garlic sauce just makes you want more! Will make it for friends & family & blow them away!

Awesome, awesome dish! I've made this at least a half dozen times and it's been a hit each time. The sauce needs to be reduced way longer than 5 minutes though. More like 15 minutes. I reduce it down until it's almost as thick as honey. This really concentrates the flavor. Be patient.

I've made this twice now and each time got great reviews. It is a bit time consuming but worth it. I was actually suprised at how much I liked it as Halibut does not rank up there as a favorite of mine. The sauce is a bit thin but this recipe is definately a keeper! But not a dish to make if you have limited time to prepare in advance.

Can anyone please help me with a suggestion for clam juice substitution. I cannot purchase this in Australia.

I liked this dish my husband loved it. I thought it was actually very simple to make. My short cuts: steam the chard in a microwavable container about 1 min on high, then let it sit a bit; I also used a pasta steamer to cook the fish <8min.; and added 1 clove of crushed garlic in the cream before boiling. In the end my sauce tasted super but looked curdled. Maybe because i used 1/2 & 1/2?

This was an excellent and extremely elegant party dish. I also heavily seasoned the fish before wrapping. I also recommend adding the ginger garlic mixture towards the end of reducing the sauce, because the flavor steams away.

This was a lot of work for a mediocre dish. The fish was very moist, but the sauce lacked depth.

The recipe had an excellent combination of flavors. The blend of ginger, garlic, clam juice, and wine was more mellower than expected and their flavors meshed quite nicely. The ginger was mellowed by the reduction of the sauce. The fish should be lightly salted before sering to enhance the flavors. I steamed the wrapped fish in a pasta cooker rather than the recommended pan, and it worked well. I would recommend leaving the stems on the chard until after they are steamed. This made them much easier to handle

Unlike the last reviewer, i like halibut. This is a very tasty, guest worthy dish that is a little time consuming if you do not do many "cabbage" roll type meals. My kids were pleasantly suprised at how well blended the tastes were.

Halibut is not one of my favorite fish, and normally I hate chard, but the combination was excellent. I think the ginger did the trick.
