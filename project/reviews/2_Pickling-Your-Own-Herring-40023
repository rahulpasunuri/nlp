The crucial salting step is missing from this and many other recipes. Here is one which has it, though: http://www.cooks.com/rec/doc/0,1617,150181-247196,00.html Brining the fish for a day causes the protiens to cross-link, preventing it from being slimy. First time I did this I had to throw the whole batch out -- so sad.

This recipe appeared in a 1949 cookbook. It is slightly different from yours in that it calls for the use of pickling spice and bringing the vinegar, water and BROWN SUGAR to the boil before pouring it over the herring, onions, pickling spice and bay leaves. I use it for pickling all firm white fish, It lasts as long as commercial pickled herring. The fish is not ever mushy

I live in Canada, but have never heard the term "Canadian herring". I'd like to know exactly what it means. The recipe says the dish will keep for weeks. How many weeks?

Recipe does not: Indicate what Canadian herring are. Any different from american herring? Were fresh herring used or previously pickled herring. Is this recipe used to pickle herring or is it a recipe using pickled herring. No salt? I used fresh herring never pickled or salted. The recipe was delicious but extreemly mushy.
