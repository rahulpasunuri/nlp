This recipe is fantastic-my changes: had fresh cherry tomatoes from garden and cut them in half; added about 1/2 cup tomato puree to kick up the tomato taste; after browning the chicken and sausages, I sauteed the mushrooms and added about 1/2 cup of chicken broth and let it cook down just a bit. Took out mushrooms, added white wine, garlic and fresh rosemary. Tomatoes+puree in cook down to thicker consistancy, mashing tomatoes a bit with the back of the spoon. Added chicken/sausage back, and cook covered another 10 min. Stirred in fresh basil. Served with rice and steamed broccoli with a bit of mustard sauce. So good!

I have made this recipe several times with very good results. Over time, I have made a few minor changes that I think work well. First, I cut the tomatoes in half before cooking (and I do not mash them) which contributes more to the sauce. Second, I add a tablespoon or two of tomato paste to punch help punch up the flavor. (I may add a couple of anchovy filets next time to add even more flavor.) Third, I add a half cup of chicken stock with the wine then reduce the sauce slightly at the end (after removing the chicken and sausage and before adding the basil).

I thought this was a wonderful recipe. I did thicken the sauce. I think next time I might even add some yellow peppers just to give it a little more colour. I served it with new potatoes and corn on the cob. This is a keeper

Some notes I made for the next time: -Use 1/2 of grape tomatoes, and substitute the other hapf with italian pear tomatoes for more flavor and thickness. -Debone chicken tighs for faster cooking (will also take less space) -Leave it for at least 20 minutes at the end insteead of 15 and check tighs for doneness. Overall, a really tasty recipe and really easy to make. I served is with an awesome polenta made with milk that took about 30 minutes or so.

Exellent and easy. I added a bit more liquid and thickened with corn starch to make more sauce.

Recipe lends itself to manipulation. Used white wine instead of red. Didn't have bread, so added a little water to the broth and threw in some couscous. After that softened, took off heat and stirred in a little ricotta for richness. The results were surprisingly pleasing.

This was delicious! Used a lesser amount of dried rosemary, which worked fine. Chicken skin was soggy by the end so I removed it before serving. Crusty bread is a must for sopping up the delicious sauce. Used crimini mushrooms, which were a nice upgrade from plain old button mushrooms.

This has become our family's "go to" dish for any occasion. The only substitution I make is to use organic, whole peeled tomatoes instead of the plum tomatoes and squish them as the recipe suggests. Our son who rinses sauce from meatballs actually grabbed a spoon to put the sauce on his pasta! Absolutely use the fresh herbs too!

Absolutely fantastic. I used all fresh on the spices and sherry for the wine. I cut back a wee bit on the oil and served it with a crisp salad and garlic bread. A keeper!

Great recipe, I used skinless boneless chicken thighs and baby portobellos as substitutes for the required ingredients. I did remove the protein at the end and boiled down the sauce to a gravy (adding a bit of butter) and added the basil just before serving. Fantastic!

Surprisingly not too heavy for the summer despite the hearty ingredients. Very good with crusty bread.

This was delicious and fresh tasting. I used turkey sausage to keep it low calorie.

Cookbook_Addict on 06/13/08 Found this in the Fast, Easy and Fresh section and it was all those things. The tomato flavour was good, not great, but hey this is june in Ontario and these little fellas came all the way from California. The hot sausage lent a good kick, the chicken was moist, (though the skin was flabby). The best part? Soaking up the tomato gravy with fresh Italian loaf.
