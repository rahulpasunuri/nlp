Fantastic recipe. Definitely a must to toast the panko. The sauce is amazing. I think it would go well with chicken or pork too.

I have made this twice now but using leftover smoked whitefish instead of the crab, and my husband loves it! No shortage of flavors, and I use the whole avacado for the sauce, too, with roasted green chile instead of jalepeno.

Oh! And I added a half to a whole teaspoon of Old Bay to the crab mixture (because I'm from near the Chesapeake and I have to!) so that might help to explain why I was satisfied with the overall flavor.

I made the crab cake only, and I thought it was excellent! I don't know if the payoff was great enough for me to toast my panko with garlic and herbes de Provence again--I normally just season "raw" panko for my coating and it tastes wonderful--but my kitchen smelled like the French riviera, and that counts for something.

This was OK, not very flavorful though when made as written. The crab cakes had too much filler and lost the crab flavor and the sauce, besides having a little bite from the chile, was otherwise pretty bland and one dimensional. We ate it, but I wouldn't make it again.

Pretty good. I did not have panko and perhaps that is why I found it average. I added a beaten egg, which perhaps made it too runny, then had to add more breadcrumbs. Didn't find them exceptionally flavorful but not bad. Next time would try with Old Bay instead of Herbes de Provence. The sauce was nice. I used a full avacado and used plain yogurt instead of the milk, so it had a thick texture that is nice as a dip as well. I also added some cumin.

I thought this recipe was a fantastic way to use leftover crab from Thanksgiving. Loved the baked crab cakes instead of fried. For the sauce: I used 3 jalepenos, substituted milk with sour cream and added chopped cilantro at the end. For the crab cakes: I did melt butter and add thyme, but then just stirred that into the crumb mixture (with one beaten egg added) chilled for an hour and a half, then formed patties and chilled them in a large flat container for another hour. I had the baking sheet in the oven so it was very hot when I put the crab cakes on to bake which gave a nice brown outside. I also flipped them once halfway through so they would brown on both sides.

For those of you adding egg to the sauce how is that safe when the sauce is not being cooked to have raw egg in it?

I just made the spicy avacado sauce and it was a huge hit. I used the whole avacado though and also added garlic and shallots. Also instead of using mayo I just put one egg yolk and some EVOO into the blender. Came out fantastic.

The Spicy Avocado Sauce was great, but I made a few changes: used the whole avocado, not 1 but 2 jalapenos (but grilled them -- so they're smoky not burning hot), added one minced garlic clove, and reduced the mayo and left out the sugar and the milk. For the crab cakes reduced the mayo again, added an egg, some Old Bay Seasoning, the zest from the lime, and one minced garlic and half of a shallot. And then cooked the crab cakes in a skillet with a mix of olive oil and a bit of unsaletd butter (4 minutes per side).

The crumbs were nicely flavored, and so was the sauce. I added twice as much jalapeno as called for in the sauce and my husband remarked that it could use more. This was a good basic crab cake recipe, not much different than my "normal" one, though the lowfat-ness of it maybe contributed to its being a bit too crumbly? Maybe add an egg to help bind?

Great avocado sauce, bland crab cakes. I used fresh crab, great texture. Really need to kick it up w/the seasoning or it will be bland-

Rating: 3
This was a pretty good recipe. I enjoyed the avocado sauce--it was nice that everyone was able to moderate how much spice they had by the amount of sauce they added to their plates. I used canned crab meat in order to save money. This made the mixture a little more watery than I would have liked. Had to add extra panko, and I might have added another egg if I were to make it again.

Rating: 4
Was absolutely fabulous! Made a few minor changes - After mixing the crab cakes (i added an egg as well), I formed the patties & cooled in the fridge for about an hour to make sure they held together well. I added minced garlic to the crab cake mixture to skip the 2nd step. I sauteed them first & finished them in the oven to give a nice crisp finish. For the sauce I substituted jarred banana peppers for the jalapeno, it was soooo delicious!!! Definitely recommend this one!

For the cakes substituted cilantro and scallions for thyme and chives, lime for lemon juice and homemade chipotle mayo for mayo/mustard. For sauce used a whole avocado and more chipotle mayo, along with a whole serrano and probably 3-4 tblsp lime juice, no milk, no sugar (why would it need sugar even in its original version?). Shaped into 6 cakes, still very substantial size but cooked slightly less, probably 11-12 minutes. Served with couscous flavored with cilantro, scallions, cumin and lime zest. A nice, moist cake that allows you to really taste the crab, and a great contrast with the crunchy breadcrumbs and smooth, creamy sauce. Will definitely make again!

I should have added some egg to the crab cakes. They could have been better, but it's my fault they weren't because I used the cheapest canned crab I could find (poor college student). The panko and sauce were good...cheap canned crab not so good. I would try this again with better crab.

I made these and they are delicious. However, I did add half of an egg to the crab cakes. Also I put some mango salsa (2 mangos, red onion, tomato, bunch of cilantro, fresh lime juice, and salt and pepper) on the plate which was a great addition.

Great Recipe - tasty & easy to make. I've made it several times, came out great each time. The recipe works well even if you pan-fry the crab cakes instead of baking. For the sauce, I usually use a whole avocado and reduce the mayo.

Easy to make and very tasty. We have used the sauce on several other items although I substitute real mayo and 2% milk.

The sauce is delicious and I plan on using it for other dishes also. Some reviewers have said that it was too thick, but I used milk to thin it as the recipe suggests, and it was perfect! The crab cakes were very good, and I was happy to find a recipe that calls for baking as opposed to frying, but they did not hold together well.

I am a cheater, I bought crab cakes at the local farmers market, so I didn't make the crab cake part of the recipe. I only made the sauce, but it was fantastic! I made it with the entire avocado and added more lime juice. I also used splenda instead of sugar. From now on when I make crab cakes, this will be my sauce!

This sauce is delicious. My husband and I don't like spicy things. One quarter of the pepper was the perfect amount to add just a touch of kick. The sauce is great on turkey burgers too!

i made these into mini-cakes to serve as hors d'oeuvres, and i substituted good-quality canned crab for the fresh as my market was out of fresh. the cakes did not hold together well, i would add a little egg next time to bind them, or as one reviewer noted, use half the mayo. but they were very tasty and the texture from the panko was terrific. i used a whole jalepeno and couldn't imagine using less. i did not like the sauce overall, just too cloying and creamy, next time i would just make real guacamole with this.

Rating: 2
The crab cakes get a better score than the sause. The panko is nice plus I added some green onion to the mixture. The sause however, is nothing but bland. The "spicy" is only the heat from the serrano and was not an asset to the dish at all. Very bland and lack luster.

Rating: 4
definately more jalapenos in the sauce and I would add some hot sauce, but the crab cakes were perfect as is. I used dungeness crab and I liked that the recipe did not take away from the flavor of the crab meat, light enough for a main course with a mixed greens and tomato salad.

I'm from VA, so we take our crabcakes pretty seriously. These crabcakes are divine. The no filler is what lifts this to new heights. The seasoning of the panko bread crumbs is perfectly balanced and adds an wonderful crispiness to a recipe that is baked (because there is no filler, they don't hold together) rather than fried. My recipe note is to increase the jalapeno. The beauty of the recipe is that each can calibrate the spiciness to his/her individual taste. These are my traditional Valentine's day dinner. I'm making them again tomorrow. I will serve with asparagus--and I found a wonderful Italian Macaroni Custard (with ham/parmesean) from my 1958 House and Garden cookbook that I found in a used book store.

The avocado sauce was very, very nice and complimented the cakes very well. My wife is not high on spicy things, so I cut the amount of pepper and left out the seeds, which left the sauce with just a hint of spicey snap. She liked it. The crab cake recipe, as is common with most crab cake recipes, was difficult to handle without breaking the cakes. Next time I will form the cakes and rest them in the refrigerator for an hour or so before cooking. I also cut back a bit on the portion of the panko used to coat the cakes. I prefer crab cakes which are not coated with breadcrumbs, but which appear to be mostly crab. We served it with the herb salad recipe also from this website.

REVIEW ON THE SAUCE ONLY. I should have known better. Avacado=guacamole...duh. I don't like guacamole on my crab cakes. My husband loved it, but I am into the more traditional Chesapeake crab cake flavor combinations.

Rating: 3
This was very good. For the sauce, definitely use a whole avocado and a whole jalapeno. I used light sour cream instead of light mayo. The sauce is thick.. you could thin with olive oil, or a little water and lime juice. Even with a whole jalapeno, this was not spicy for me (but I live in AZ). My boyfriend lives in Boston and is Asian and he found it very mild also. Don't be afraid of the pepper! The crab cakes are great, but you definitely need to double the panko mixture (whether you make 4 or turn it into 6). If you cut the mayo in half, the crab cakes hold together better. We served ours on a bed of Arugula and a few sprigs of cilantro, added crab cakes, drizzled sauce all over and then added tiny dices of tomatoes. Very yummy.. good with black beans on the side.. black beans and whole kernel corn might be even better. Definitely, I'll make again, but since I like kick, I'd add tobasco to the crab cakes and maybe another jalapeno to the avacado sauce.. or some red pepper flakes.

I used regular mayo and milk, not low-fat, and used jalapenos. I made this sauce to accompany the Louisiana Deviled Crab Cakes, and it was a huge hit. Excellent for spicy-food-lovers.

I haven't done the crabcakes yet, but I did use the avocado sauce and it was great. I added some garlic to give it some kick since I didn't have jalapeños, and some cilantro. Served it with tuna steaks and finely chopped tomatoes on top... made for a great meal. Can't wait to try the sauce with the crabcakes.

I made this with the following adjustments: shallot instead of chives, and added just a dash of hot sauce to the crab. In the sauce, I used sour cream instead of mayo, and I put in the entire jalapeno, only NO seeds, since he doesnt like hot. That way you get the flavor of the jalapeno, but not the heat. We both liked it fine, especially the panko crust. He ate all of his crab cake, which is a good thing because he's not really a seafood fan. He is, however, an avocado devotee, and said that he'd definitely eat this again, so that makes it a keeper. I thought it could have been a bit spicier myself. Bet the sauce is good with a MD style crabcakes (dijon, worcestershire & Old Bay). I'll certainly make this again, but I'll experiment a bit more with the ingredients.

I have made this recipe more than a dozen times, including mini ones for parties. As someone who grew up in New England and went to school on the Maryland border, good crab cakes are a must. I use canned crab (because I am a poor grad student and live in Ohio)-- three cans of mixed and one more expensive can of claw. Other than that I follow the recipe exactly. I usually serve it on a bed of arugala or another green. Everyone I have made it for is amazed-- even my friends and family who visit from the shore! I use the leftover sauce on salad the next day, I have never had any problem with the recipe, and it always takes less time than the recipe says.

My husband said these were the best crab cakes he's ever had. I have to agree that they are pretty wonderful and the sauce works very nicely with the cakes. What's great about these cakes is that they are all crab and not full of a bunch of fillers. I used cayenne pepper for the sauce instead of the whole pepper. Since crab cakes are the only way my husband will eat crab (he's too lazy to pick it out the meat) I'll definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe for some friends and they loved it! They could not get enough of the sauce which I did exactly like the recipe said except that I just added some olive oil to make it less thick. To the crabcakes the only changes I made was that I added cilantro, I used scallions instead of chives, and I used regular breadcrumbs instead of panko. I felt a very important step in making sure the crabcakes held together was that I made them into patties a day ahead and left them in the frigde so by the next night, when it was time to fry them they were really strongly held together (by the way that is another thing I changed, that I didn´t bake them). I made the sauce a day ahead as well and I thought it tasted better the next day.

I only used the spicy avacado sauce recipe. You can use this with homemade enchaladas or nacho dipping sauce. It's lowfat, easy and tasty! What more do you need? I will make the sauce again to use with many different dishes.

This was overall a good recipe, and very easy, I had no trouble and I've never made crab cakes. However, the sauce was definitely not spicy enough. I will probably use a habanero pepper next time, since I like spice and there was almost no kick. Also, it's a very mayanonaise-y flavor, I think I'll try plain yogurty next time instead of mayo. The panko crumbs are a must, I think regular bread crumbs would be way too thick.

I am really only reviewing the avocado sauce because I made my own crab cakes with sauteed red bell peppers, onion, s&p, and a couple of dashes of hot sauce. This sauce was the perfect compliment.

My boyfriend and I came up with many differect serving suggestions - will definitely make again.

The crab cakes had a wonderful zing to them from the chives and dijon mustard (which I doubled). And the avocado sauce was surprisingly good in combination with the cakes. This recipe did not take as long as listed (probably only 30min b/c I made the cakes somewhat smaller). Excellent dish, I will definitely make this for company.

Some improvisation worked well for me. Short of mayo, I used sour cream in the sauce. Skipped the blender/processor and also did not use milk. You could use your favorite guacamole if you wanted to and it would be great. The crabcake recipe, like many others stated, is very good for it's lack of fillers. If you love crab, the tastes come right through! Shortages meant I used lime, not lemon, true spring vidalias, not chives, and a special Mediterranean biscuit with herbs (crushed) instead of the breadcrumbs. All in all, worth the work and a big hit.

I found this recipe to be quite tasty, especially for a "healthy" version. I added some cilantro to the avocado sauce, and I would probably add more jalapeno if I were to make it again. To be honest, I was a bit suspicious of the sauce at first (milk and avocado?), but the flavor goes perfectly with the crab cakes. My one complaint was that the cakes themselves did not hold together well (too moist), but other than that, terrific!

Very tasty. I used regular bread crumbs, scallions instead of chives, and dungeoness crab. I like the fact they they are not fried, and the avocado sauce was perfectly spicy. I think next time I will omit the mayo and milk from the sauce and just add more lime juice. See how that goes since I prefer not to mix mayo and milk with avocado. I think this is a fantastic recipe.

I made this recipe with fresh dungness carb for a Christmas appetizer. I served it with a Mango salsa. I thought that the crab cakes were overall tasteless. Maybe doubling the quantity of Dijon mustard would help? Or adding a few drops of Tobasco would give it a kick? Not sure what would be best but something is required to give this dish some taste. The only thing I liked about the dish is that they crab cakes were not deep fried.

Both were great, my husband liked this one better and I like the other - try it, it's great! For this recipe I used a whole small avocado but followed the recipe otherwise. Next time I would add more jalapeno to the sauce. The panko crust is fabulous. Don't skimp on the garlic. Easy and quick and although we had it for an entree it would be a great First Course.

My husband and I thought this recipe was fantastic and will definitely make again. Without the sauce, the crabcakes might be a little plain. We loved the sauce and made it just as directed.

I also used regular breadcrumbs and they turned out just fine.

These were really good, I loved the combo of crab and avocado. My only problem was the baking of the crabcakes, they are just so much better panfried, it seems like a waste to spend so much money on crabmeat and then not make them to best way possible. I will absolutley make these again, but I will fry them. It is just is not the same in the oven.

I have to rate the sauce only so-so. I think a more chunky guacamole texture would have been more appealing-also the taste elements need tweaking. The crab cakes were appealing in that they were full of crab, not filler. They held together with gentle but firm handing-the instructions were good. But I don't know, something was missing for me with these.

Avocado sauce was too thick and creamy. There wasn't enough panko crumbs, and the cakes fell into pieces. The flavor wasn't there either. I used snow crab and was disappointed I didn't just eat it with butter....would have been cheaper, less time consuming, and tastier.

These are just the best crab cakes because they have so little filler. I used fresh Maine crab and Vidalia onion because I didn't have chives. Yum. They are tricky to keep together, but with gentle handling it does work. For the sauce, I didn't add the milk and just mashed the avocado with a fork, then stirred in the other ingedients. I used pickled jalapenos and they gave a good kick.

Great! I used a whole avocado but used only 1 T. mayo and maybe 2 T. milk. Otherwise, it would have been way too thin. I also cut back the mayo for the cakes. Definitely worth making (I paid $20 for a 16 oz. can of lump crab).

The crabcakes came out pretty well using this recipe. I used a can of crabmeat from CostCo and after letting the crab mixture chill, there was a lot of liquid in the mixture so I ended up trying to squeeze out the excess. Also, I formed 6 crabcakes and let them sit in the fridge for another hour -- they hold together better that way. I wasn't crazy about the sauce - seemed too creamy. Next time, I'll add another jalapeno.

Hmm ... seem to have a contrarian view. Didn't make avocado sauce but otherwise followed recipe 100% and still found crab cakes uninspiring. Mixture didn't hold together so made eight patties vs four. But ..... based on other comments here, will try again.

My sauce was a bit more spicy than I wanted it (my fault), but it was still fantastic. Even with chilling the crab mixture, the cakes were tricky to keep together - you just have to be very gentle. The only thing I changed was to make 2X the panko.

You want to drain any liquid from the canned crab - I used Philipp's pasteurized - it changes everything. The cakes were amazing! The spicy avocado sauce, however, was too thick, but the taste was indeed the best complement to a crab cake. Served it at a Southwestern dinner party as an entrée, with jerk pork chops, black beans salad, sweet potato fries, corn bread and bread pudding for dessert. I had also made Mint Juleps as aperitifs, we had a bold Toscany wine with the pork - an amazing time we had, all epicurious recipes. I am now thought to be the best cook in the family!

Made this for a picky couple, and they loved it. The Avocado Sauce was actually a bigger hit than the crab cakes, but both were loudly praised. I added one tablespoon extra mayo to the crabcakes, as they wasn't binding as much as I wanted with the original amount. I used plain breadcrumbs, and they worked just fine.
