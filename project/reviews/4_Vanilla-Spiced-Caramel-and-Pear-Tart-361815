I've made this 3x already...so delicious. I've made it with pears and apples. I think that it would work with pretty much any fruit that can hold up when cooked. This is my go to dessert recipe for dinner parties.

This was very yummy, but definitely 45 minutes is enough baking time! I took the spices out of the butter that goes into the filling and added those to the pear juice instead of throwing them away. It's fine without the star anise. Would definitely make it again!

I made this for Easter last year and I'm planning on making it for Easter this year again. The only change I made was that I used phyllo dough. This was really great and everyone raved.

I thought this was a lot work for a relatively tasteless dessert. I have to agree with klezcook. While it did look nice, the pastry needed a pate brisee with a little sugar to caramelize it. However, we seem to be in the minority.

Made this as written, with the exception of using a ceramic pie plate instead of a springform pan, for Christmas dinner and everyone was still talking about it the next day! Served with homemade whipped topping, terrific!

We really enjoyed this recipe. We used 4 bartlett pears. Followed the recipe as written. Next time we may try it with a bit of vanilla ice cream. Yum!

I love this tart, I've made it three times now. Splurge on organic pears and great quality spices. ( the savory spice shop.) I bought my pears unripe and left them sitting in a brown paper bag until they smelled impossibly sweet. I used trader joe's puff pasty, both sheets, and left them freezing in the spring form overnight. I also added 1/2 tsp. ground nutmeg to the filling and found that the cooking time is more like 40-45 min.

Wow. Made this with Royal Riviera pears received as a gift. Easy, and each step can be done ahead so that you can manage it over a few days if need be. I didn't have a spring-form pan, but a glass pie plate served perfectly. Keep an eye on it, I found it completely, perfectly done at 45 min; an hour would have been too much. DELICIOUS!!!!!

I made this for Thanksgiving last year, several times after that and am going to make it again this Thanksgiving! I followed the recipe, but found it did take longer to caramelize than was indicated. It's always a big hit and I'm looking forward to enjoying both the taste and aroma soon.

Just o.k., not a showstopper. Kind of disappointing after reading all the rave reviews. The finished product was a strange combination of bland-tasting yet sort of perfume-y from the vanilla and browned butter, but surprisingly not in a good way. For a truly fabulous winter fruit dessert, try instead the Prune, Cherry, and Apricot Frangipane Tart. You can find the recipe on Epicurious.

Yummmmmm! Made this for Thanksgiving to rave reviews. Was easier than I expected - just some time for all the steps. Such a great presentation.

Made it for Thanksgiving and it has now been requested that I make it again for Christmas

This tart is incredibly delicious. I was lucky my pears were ripe and firm. Buy extra pears so you can discard under-ripe ones. They are ripe if the surface juices up when you peel them. My guests were swooning and my son-in-law just asked for the recipe. Thank you!

Just divine...made once to test then made 2 at the same time..simply doubled the recipe and it worked wonders. Lots of wows and requests for the recpie. Well worth the effort and time it takes.

That low-level "mmmmmming" you heard last night was the guests at my dinner table consuming this spectacular dessert. DO splurge on the best puff pastry you can find. DO shop for fresh spices at your local natural foods store. DON'T be afraid. This is a beautifully balanced dish - the sweet and spicy aspects don't overwhelm the fruit. Definitely a signature dish.

Made this on Sunday--dry run for Thanksgiving. It was delicious and pretty. But not over the top. The syrup had the most wonderful flavor. Agree with previous reviewer that carmelization times were low. Think next time, I'll just cook the pears in the caramel sauce and serve over ice cream or with whipped cream. No need to do the rest.

This was awesome !! I had no vanilla beans so just used liquid vanilla. Followed the recipe exactly and it came out just perfect. I found the times for carmelization a bit low, but probably because I was afraid of burning it, so took my time. Just as good the next day. Will definitely make it again, and it is very impressive to look at. The recipe looks complicated, but it really isn't, just a little time consuming. Being able to do all the parts ahead of time is a real bonus.
