These are so good. The dark sesame oil makes them really special. Especially as part of an appetizer before an Asian meal. They are addictive!

I thought the sesame oil/cumin combo sounded strange so I substituted olive oil for the sesame oil and got a great middle eastern tasting chip. They were outstanding. You gotta try this!!
