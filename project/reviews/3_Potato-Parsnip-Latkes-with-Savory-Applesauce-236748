Delicious! The parsnips add great flavor to otherwise typical latkes. I fried them in oil and they came out great!

I made this recipe exactly to specifications re: ratio of potato to egg whites, and the latkes did not hold together at all. i added significantly more egg whites and some flour, which had good results. Additionally, i included sweet potatoes in the mix, which added a nice flavor.

First time I've made my own Latkes. Really happy with the result and family/testers really enjoyed and asked for more. All liked the addition of the parsnips. Will now prepare for guests.

what is WITH people rating recipes when they clearly haven't tried them? it IS possible to leave comments about a recipe without rating it; you should try it. and that way you won't mislead people who are interested in the food itself and not whether it's religiously correct.

The whole point of latkes on Hannukah is to fry them in OIL -- the the oil is symbolic of the miracle of the holiday. Making them with butter is not modern -- it's a total cop out! There are other ways to update a traditional menu without taking away all the meaning of the holiday.
