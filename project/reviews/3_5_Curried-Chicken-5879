Authentic or not, this was good and easy to make for my first foray into Indian cooking. I'd prefer something more like Tikka Masala next time though. I used grilled chicken, cut up to save time. Halved, it still made five generous portions.

A very good chicken curry recipe. The use of all the condiments reminds me of our family's old Bombay Beef Curry recipe. Here, we also add chopped hard boiled eggs, raisins, and extra chopped raw onion to the selection of condiments. As other reviewers mentioned, it took a long time to cook the chicken thoroughly. For me, about 1/2 hour with the pot covered. And also it turns out to be a mild curry. Next time I will add more hot curry spice.

We savored this tropical, southeast Asian curry. Browned the chicken before proceeding with the recipe as written, with great results. Added dash of cayene pepper to taste for increased heat. The additional accompaniments of roasted peanuts, coconut, fresh mango and cilantro made this dish zing.

I made this recipe almost as is (I had no flour or coconut milk), and it is fabulous and very easy. A one pot meal! I did saute the chicken first and added carrots to the sauce. I used Madras curry which I think works better than chinese curry and added red pepper because I like spice. I served it on a bed of sauteed spinach to save carbs and it was so yummy. Next time I would use a bit less applesauce but definitely a wonderful meal.

I loved this dish! Followed another reviewer's advice and added sliced carrots and diced potatoes, cutting back on the peas (daughter doesn't like them). Everybody raved. Added a sprinkle of cayenne to mine for xtra heat. Enjoyed it all week!

Excellent recipe which I modified to make a version of chicken curry puffs. I didn't use as much chicken broth as called for, and left out the coconut milk. Added ground chicken which I had browned first (and one scotch bonnet pepper). It ended up being a delicious mixture which I then spooned into squares of puff pastry, folded, and baked. Divine..

I made this dish last night. My house smelled so good as the curry sauce was simmering. Bottom line, I loved the end result. The only thing that I would add is that the chicken takes a lot longer to cook than noted. But, I will definitely make it again and again.

LOVE this curry. If you're a single guy or gal like I am, you can make this Sunday night with leftovers and the flavor only improves by Friday's lunch. Although it isn't authentic (in my opinion it's impossible to make a great Indian curry without FRESH spices that are not readily available) it's a well balanced dish with subtle flavor. I threw in some turmeric and a bit more heat to suit my taste.

Just finished making this recipe and it's simple and very delicious! I followed the recipe but made a few additions: 1 C diced, peeled potates, 3 sliced carrots, a little cayene pepper and a drizzle of honey at the end - I love curry to have a sweet/spicy finish to it. The best part of making this was how easy it was, I love one pot meals!

I plan on making this tonight and then leaving a review. But I wanted to note that 'curry' is a term used to cover many many types of flavorfull dishes in india and other countries. It really depends on your blend of spices in the mix that you buy or put together yourself that will determine the base. After that the other additions such as coconut make a difference too. So this may not taste like your take out because there are soo many versions and soo many regions of the country to choose from. Recipe sounds good to me, so i will leave a review tommorrow.

And BTW, to those who gave disparaging reviews with comments slamming this recipe's authenticity, and especially the culinary savvy of those of us who have given it raves: many of us ARE true epicures! We are well traveled, well read, educated in the fine arts of cooking and entertaining, enjoying with gusto the finer things Life offers. But I, personally, think it is silly to turn my nose up at a tasty gnosh because it is not "authentic", or slam someone as not having "savvy" or "taste" because they love something I don't. Keep those thoughts to yourselves, and just rate the recipes, will you??

I am reviewing this recipe again after 10 years of this being a regular dish in my kitchen. I have found that I like lots more heat and salt in the dish than it calls for, but this has gotten raves the many times I have served this for family and friends. As I am in Houston, even my Indian co-workers love this savory, balanced dish. What I love about it is the fact that it makes a LOT of curry, and also that it freezes amazingly well. Best made a day or two in advance and reheated, it is great for parties and buffet dinners for many people.

I've made this recipe several times as is and it's delicious. However, now when I make it, I change to include some ingredients that I like in curry. I use less chicken and instead add diced potatoes and carrots. In addition, I like spicy foods and add a habanero pepper based hot sauce. Yum, yummy!

This recipe was very tasty. I had all the ingredients except the sour cream and peas - which I replaced with spinach as another reviewer adviced - and it still came out great!

We really liked this recipe! I agree that it isn't all that spicy but I find it's always easiest just to add spices to taste. I liked it as is but my boyfriend added extra cayenne pepper to his. Also, we weren't big fans of the texture (I didn't chop the onions small enough) so after it finished simmering in the first step I threw it in the blender, pureed it for a minute, and then continued on. Great flavor and texture that way!!

Easy and delicious. I didn't have peas so substituted a package of frozen, chopped spinach. Also added a handful of sliced almonds. Will definately make again!

I followed the recipe and I found it a bit more time consuming than I expected. The chicken took longer to cook and I spend more time letting it reduce than I would have liked. It also made a lot of food, so I would cut the recipe in half next time. That being said, the dish tasted great and I would make it again without hesitation. I would also leave my windows open overnight, since my house definitely smells like curry.

I thought this was interesting but will leave out the applesauce and sour cream next time. I tried it before the addition of the sourcream and I though it was better than with. I may also add potatoes next time. We usually use paste to make curry for a quick meal. This is a little more work, but was a nice change.

I thought this dish was very nice, and I liked the fact that it made lots. Great leftovers! I didnt take as long to make it as the recipe suggests (dont need 30 minutes to simmer) but definitely cooked the chicken for longer than 3 minutes in the sauce. It was probably more like 10. I would not cook the chicken separately. I always do it this way with curries, and they come out tender and flavourful.

Just made this, followed the recipe almost exactly (ran out of ginger but had enough to taste it) and found it to be a very delicious dish. The coconut milk and sour cream made it rich in a delightful way, not heavy in the least. I will definitely make this again.

I want to make this recipe, but have one question. Is it sanitary to put raw meat in with the cooked sauce? The recipe suggests cooking the chicken strips in the sauce 3 minutes, but will this give the sauce enought time to 'burn off' the potential contaminants? Cooking the meat first seems better, although I'm sure it won't be as flavorful. Just curious. Thanks in advance for any guidance!

Rating: 3
This was really easy to make; just a little time consuming. If I make this again, I will probably halve the recipe, because it makes A TON! I will be eating curry for the next month! The main complaint I have is that the flavors were very mild; I will probably double the spices the next time--it could have had something to do with the fact that I used a mild curry powder (all my store had at the time), but it just wasn't very spicy (heat-wise and flavor-wise) at all. Also, maybe I would reduce the amount of chicken broth (maybe just 2 cups instead of 3), and use half and half applesauce and Major Gray chutney like another reviewer recommended. I think I will also try making this in a crockpot next time; seems like it would be easy to do.

Rating: 1
I feel that I must add that I wasn't expecting this to be a traditional curry dish but what I ended up with was really terrible. I think that the applesauce was where it really went wrong, although even without it it would have been very bland and I still probably wouldn't have eaten it. I think that curry powders are best used to add a curry flavor to various dishes rather than for actual curries. I have had much better luck using curry pastes for quick and easy at home curries.

I was really intrigued by all of the back n' forth on here about this recipe. It seemed that there were a few food snobs who pooh-poohed the authenticity of this curry, while at the same time other folks who seemed like they knew their way around the kitchen were singing its praises. I am a "foodie." I live in Berkeley. I am an avid cook. Here is my two cents: This dish is delicious. If you want to make a good, saturday afternoon curry that will feed you all week long, then you have found the right recipe. I followed it to the letter, only with the addition of a jalapeno for more heat. It tastes like curry. It does not taste like a "bunch of stuff thrown together." If you want authentic, then by all means, ride your elephant down the banks of the Ganges in search of wild cardamom pods blessed by Ganesha. More power to you. But for the rest of us-- folks like me who think cooking is fun and eating it is even funner-- try this recipe! ~Namaste

I went into this recipe with an open mind, realizing that it wouldn't be a traditional curry but hoping that it would taste good as it's own dish. I was sadly disappointed. It was bland and weird, and unlike any curry dish I've ever had. I ended up throwing it all out.

I've been cooking for most of my 60 years and this is one of the best recipes EVER! I did omit the applesauce and coconut milk because I didn't have any. I made it for my 20 something daughter and her friends and they absolutely loved it. The smell of it cooking is something else. It's akin to smelling gingerbread at Christmas.

Overall, a solid unspectacular curry. A bit too sweet for my taste, but that would probably have been improved by using Madras rather than oriental curry powder. My husband liked it much better than I did but I have better recipes that require fewer ingredients that I would rather make.

Although this is a very good recipe on its own, here's another way to kick it up! My neighbor is from Malaysia and her recipe includes a marinade for the chicken. Per 4 chicken breasts: 1 Tbsp Balsamic Vinegar, 2 tsp cumin powder; 1 tsp coriander powder, 1 tsp tumeric powder, 2 Tbsp curry powder, 1/2 cup yogurt. Marinate for at least 5 hrs. Then fry the chicken to brown. Follow the Epicurious recipe from there. Oh, I also prefer to substitute pre-steamed brocolli for the peas -- more texture.

I was rather disappointed in this dish. After all the amazing reviews I was really excited about trying it. Unfortunately, as written, this recipe was rather bland for me. I was expecting a creamier, spicier curry. It was okay, but I'll have to modify the recipe if I make it again.

Not yet matching my memory of curry takeaway in London, but getting there! I added chopped carrot and apple, wish I'd cut chicken smaller than 1", used low-fat coconut milk (what was on hand), skipped the condiments except for a watered-down Major Grey chutney (also on hand). Really hit the spot with baked brown rice from Cooks Illustrated.

Way delicious! My family went crazy enjoying this recipe. I made the first step of the sauce the night before and refridgerated overnight. I also grilled the chicken therefore not putting raw chicken to cook in the sauce. I served this dish with Jasmine white rice and fire grilled yellow squash. I also started the meal with the pumpkin bisque recipe found on the Epicurious site. It was a great way to use the coconut milk.

Who gives two hoots whether or not this is authentic... when I'm looking to put something delicious on the table for dinner, whether Indians really do use curry powder is the farthest thing from my mind. That said, this is really delicious. The best part of this recipe is that it lends itself so well to adaptation, as the comments below evidence. I personally have been making this for years, and modify to suit my mood. Epicurious purists, close your eyes from here on in: a good combination I like is half applesauce, half mango chutney rather than all applesauce, and the addition of a minced jalapeno for heat. I picked up those tips from reviews a few pages back, and if I hadn't followed everyone's excellent advice, it probably would have been very unmemorable.

This dish is fantastic. I've made it more times than I can count, since I first discovered it two years ago. I like to use less chicken and instead add carrots and potatoes. Additionally, I appreciate things a bit spicier so I add a habanero based hot sauce or dried hot chili peppers to get the heat level up. However, if you follow the recipe, it's absolutely delicious. It's a star!

I'm glad the bad reviews didn't dissuade me from trying this recipe. I halved the whole recipe, but i accidentaly added a double serving of cinnamon, so i had to kick up all the other spices to even it out. So it turned out extra-spicy, but i'm glad, otherwise it would have been too bland. Also added the whole packet of peas, and that worked great. The chicken did take more 6 minutes to cook. Otherwise i kept evrything else the same, didn't think it was too many ingridients. Loved the smell of it cooking. The chutney was suprisingly good, as well. Overall, a great recipe, even my boyfriend, who hates anything with a soupy sause, had a second serving!!

I really hope Epicurious DOESN'T start researching recipes before it puts one on this site. What I want is a recipe that tastes good, not a recipe that gets top marks for its authenticity. As for Earl Grey chutney, I think it's a wonderful addition to the salted peanuts, banana slices, pinapple chunks, toasted coconut and mandrin oranges I served this dish with. Heavenly. Will make it again.

This recipe is really all over the place. It seems like someone threw together just about everything in the pantry with some curry powder. I dont think the reviewer below was being nasty....the recipe is a "throw together" curry. Its not about being culinarily savvy....but knowing when to stop. If you throw in everything you can lay your hands on...no flavor comes across in the dish. And what is the deal with Major grey's mango chutney? People here seem to be very fond of putting it into so called "Indian dishes". No one in India knows about it and about curry powder too for that matter. It would be nice to have epicurious reserch a cuisine a little before putting out recipes. It may taste alright, but you dont know what u're missing till you taste the real deal. Since anything goes....even Indian restaurants in the US pass off anything as Indian food.

Bland and boring despite so many ingredients. It's like someone with no clue about Indian food tried to come up with a recipe. Why coconut milk AND yogurt AND sour cream? And applesauce? You can do much better with some curry paste and just coconut milk. The toppings made it edible but without them, was SO DULL. But I can see why it got such good reviews. You people have no clue. I mean, this is a YELLOW curry, not RED, and those distinctions are Thai, not Indian. Sambal is Indonesian, not Thai.

Loved it....Make sure you use the proper peanuts, unsalted...not the kind you put out for guests! Why save a few calories and reduce the wonderful texture with low fat anything in this recipe. As always use fresh, highest quality curry powder. I like using a medium or mild curry powder to give me more control. Hot curies can kill any dish like this. I put out bowls of the mango, coconut, peanuts, mango etc and the kids thought it was fantastic! I am making it tommorrow for company!

After reading the reviews, I just had to make this dish. I've developed quite a fondness for curries, and this is a very good one. I did not add the applesauce as I didn't think it would do much for the texture. Because I like things spicy, I added a few teaspoons of Sambal Oelek (Thai Chili Paste), and it gave it just the right amount of kick. I was out of sour cream, so I added a bit of neufchatel for creaminess, and it was delicious! Thanks to the suggestions of other reviewers, I also added potatoes, but diced and deep-fried them, and stirred them in before serving. My husband, an avid curry fan, loved it! I used brown rice and traditional condiments. We will certainly have this again!

I'm a lousy cook. I shouldn't even use the word cook. I'm a kitchen dawdler. I take too long to read recipes, and then when I finish it, I have to read it again. And even then that's not enough. Probably got ADDHD or whatever they call it. Plus, y'know.. I start drinking scotch when I'm cooking. Like bowling, you reach a point and then you start throwing nothing but gutterballs. But maybe not so. Flash fwd to tonight, right now there is a giant frypan of this stuff simmering on my stove, I used this recipe, but I didn't have a measuring thing, so I just whomp threw it all in using best guesses and you know what? It tastes reeeeeally good. Two thumbs, way up. It was supposed to be for dinner tonight, but my wife can't make it home coz she's still at work, so somewhere it says you can make it one day ahead.. but I'm really going nuts trying to NOT eat it. I have some leftover homestyle fried potatoes nuggets from lunch that I keep dipping in the goop. Gawd it's deelish. I'm watching this dvd The Quiet American while stirring and sampling. I like Michael Caine.. I prefer his earlier stuff, particularly The Man Who Would Be King. I would add 1979's The First Great Train Robbery, but that Donald Sutherland, or for some odd reason I get those two mixed up. OH WELL!

True, this recipe makes a veritable vat of chicken curry. Yet, while I consider other cooks' suggestions the best part about epicurious, I can't help wondering whether in this case, too many cooks spoiled the broth. I sprung for a new container of curry powder for this recipe, subbed a cup of Major Grey for the applesauce, added a pound of red-skin potatoes to my 16 ounces of browned, cubed chicken, threw in some chopped japapeno, and took other excellent-sounding suggestions of previous cooks, but the result was just plain underwhelming. Well, we still have the leftovers (boy, do we have leftovers!) and maybe they'll live up to this recipe's reputation!

Very good and fairly easy to make. Low fat yogurt and sour cream worked fine. Could use a little more heat, but not much. I think the chicken needs to be cooked much longer. Garnishes of cilantro, raisins and peanuts were delicious. Served with a sparkling wine.

I have made this recipe at least four times, to serious accolades, and then again tonight. It's just great with either chicken or shrimp, but even though I had both sour cream and coconut milk at hand each time, I didn't add them at the end after tasting the sauce. ( My husband is on a low fat diet). It tastes just perfect without them and I suspect they dilute the flavors too much. Try it this way before you start playing with the spices. For curry powder I have used Penzey's sweet curry powder, Penzey's hot, and Vong "four star curry blend"...each is outstanding.

For those vegetarians out there, we made this dish with tofu instead of chicken and it worked quite well. Buy Firm or Extra Firm tofu and cut it into about 1 inch squares. Sautee in a pan with oil until lightly browned on all sides. Then, just mix it in as you would the chicken. We also thought this was not quite spicy enough, but our curry was not too fresh, so that could be the problem.

This was as good or better as any curry I've ever had in an Indian, thai, etc. restaurant. I pretty much stuck to the recipe, though I tend to approximate the measurements. The only slight change was a sprinkling of sugar during stage one of the sauce....not enough to sweeten, but rather to help blend the flavors. I can't wait to make this for company. It's the perfect "group" recipe. For desert, try the banana ravioli (which are even better when reheated) with vanilla custard sauce. You'll truly believe there's a heaven.

A good beginner curry. I found it when searching for a way to use some extra applesauce - and it was a great use for it. I added two minced jalapeno's along with the ginger and garlic - next time I'll add more as it was still mild for our taste. The quality of the curry powder is critical. This time I used Maharajah from Penzey's - this blend with saffron and fenugreek made for a great balance of flavor. Next time I'll add a little of their hot curry blend. Also used lite coconut milk and left the peas to a side dish (for the non-vegetable lovers in the family and makes the curry more re-heatable - if you think curry is good the first day save some for leftovers! Also try basmati rice instead of long grain-there is a world of flavor difference

Has anyone tried the curry mixes from Patak's? Those are just as good as the dishes I have gotten in London and soooo easy! Their Madras Curry reminds me of a dish I used to get everytime I visited Gibraltar. To those who think the curry is harsh: my suggestion would be make your own. Find a good basis recipe and adjust the seasonings to your liking. That's the nice thing about curry; it doesn't have to be the same thing every time.

First: I love Indian food. A good curry is a treat I seek out upon arriving and just before leaving London. But: I found the curry in this to be harsh. The curry was fresh (just purchased that day) so that might have been the issue. But we needed every bit of the applesauce, coconut milk, yogurt and sour cream to mellow the harshness of the ginger and curry powder. I also found the meat proportion to be high (4 pounds for 8 people? how American) and so cut in half which meant the end product was more "sauce with meat" than traditional curry. I'll definitely continue to experiment with this, however. For those who count time -- this took an 75 minutes start to table with virtually all hands-on time.

This is my favorite chicken curry recipe. Perfect for a party (easy to make ahead of time) because guests can adjust spiciness with either my homemade chutney or Major Grey's spicy chutney. Use high quality curry powder, it will make a difference.

This was my first attempt at Indian food, and this recipe made me look and feel like a pro! I followed Toronto's suggestion doubled the garlic and halved the applesauce and replaced it with hot mango chutney. Very good suggestion! I also used lite coconut milk...another good suggestion. I agree with other suggestions that using fresh curry powder is a must because it looses its flavor over time. Maybe this was a problem with those who found the curry taste a bit lacking?

Not bad- a little too bland for my taste. You definetly want to take the user advice and add hot peppers and some kind of chutney. On its own it would be kinda bland. I also added potatoes which made it pretty hearty. In hindsight, I'd go light on the cream and yogurt and heavy on the garlic. Its good stuff, but a little to blah for all the work involved- this dish asked for roughly 10000 ingredients.

This is my first attempt making a curry dish at home and it came out great! I made half the recipe and took the suggestion of adding hot mango chutney. Since I substituted boneless chicken thighs and added 2 diced potatoes, I let the curry simmer longer at the end so the chicken was more tender and the potatoes cooked through. I also used a little more coconut milk than the recipe suggested to round out the flavor. A really good curry recipe that you can modify to suit your taste. Delicious!

My mouth is watering just thinking about this! It is FABULOUS... a dream of a dish-- easy on the wallet, tasty, fun, quick to prepare... I could go on. I took another reviewers suggestion and used half applesauce, half mango chutney... this gave the dish an appealing sweet/hot twist. Half the recipe feeds plenty. (My husband and I ate it for dinner, and then finished it off for lunch the next day). Definitely something I'll make often.

True, this dish isn't fancy fare. But it's tasty and fairly easy to make. In my opinion, each flavor was balanced-- nothing seemed overpowering to me. But if you like it spicy, you'll really have to play around with the recipe. I'll do it again and again.

I made this curry two evenings ago and was very dissatisfied. I followed the recipe to a T, and my husband and I both agreed that it was just not good. The ginger flavor was very overpowering and gave the whole dish a rather bad flavor, while other than that, the curry was bland. I haven't made a lot of curries, but I have made a few that have turned out very well. I think from now on I will stick with my Grandma's trusty recipe. According to other reviewers, this curry got good ratings, so I'm not sure what they liked and I missed, but I was very dissapointed.

Great curry! My wife and I loved it. Will make again, next time for guests.

Very good, but if you like things on the spicy side, you will have to either add a minced chili as suggested by others or use a hot curry powder. It was too mild for us, thus a little disappointing. But the overall flavor was so good I'll try it again, modified to our liking. Instead of serving this with the usual mango chutney, I added a dollop of cubed mango mixed with lime juice and cilantro atop the stew. It added a nice touch.

This is great curry - all of the extras sprinkled ontop make the dish very pro looking. We used chicken but then after added chopped veggies for a 2nd and 3rd meal.

This is a staple of mine. I add one jalapeno, with seeds, since this recipe is so mild when made as written. (I mince the garlic and ginger in the food processor, with the chili.) And it does make a ton, but the leftovers seem to taste even better. I add half the portion of applesauce, and replace the other half with hot mango chutney. Just a really good, basic curry.

This is a great dinner party recipe--it makes so much! I doubled the garlic & used a hot mango chutney to spice it up a bit. My husband & I weren't sure about the bananas, but they totally worked.

This recipe was fabu, and even better after sitting in the fridge overnight. Next time I would avoid the yogurt as it weakens the flavor, use a hotter curry, and use a light coconut milk. I would also brown the chicken slightly before stewing it for texture. The peanuts, raisins, and mangos are essential to add diversity to the flavor. This is a great recipe to perfect and start you off cooking Indian cuisine.

What a great dish. My husband said it tasted like it was right from our favorite Indian restaurant. I added cilantro chutney to the table for extra oomph! Thanks for the recipe. C Hart

I really enjoyed this curry - it's fairly time-consuming to prepare, but nothing difficult and the flavours work very well together. I would pep it up a little next time with a stronger curry powder - I used a medium curry which gave a nice flavour but lacked real bite. I also thought there was a little too much cream - I would reduce it next time, or leave it out all together as it doesn't really need to be there!

Rating: 4
Although a bit time-consuming (didnt get a chance to prepare sauce beforehand, will next time), this recipe offers a delicious end result that is well worth the effort! This is the 3rd time I've made it & this time I followed the advice of other cooks---added minced jalapeno to sauce (offers a nice 'kick') and diced potatoes 1/2way thru. Great advice!

Rating: 4
My family loved this. I didn't have applesauce; so, I substituted apple juice and it turned out fine. I think the sauce would have been too thick using applesauce anyway. I am always looking for ways to save time so I only made the sauce on the stove then poured it over the raw chicken and baked the whole thing for an hour covered with foil. I served it sprinkled with fresh cilantro and slivered almonds with basmati rice and the Curried Lentil soup from this site as side dishes and it was really good!

When Bon Appetit first published this recipe in their January 1999 edition, I was immediately curious. I made it right away and loved it. The long list of ingredients is intimidating, but there isn't anything exotic there, and the prep is easy. It has become my standard curried chicken recipe--I've made it at least four or five times. This recipe has really aroused my interest in curries, and I am starting to branch out. This is an easy, basic, flavorful dish. I've not had anything more than compliments when I serve this. One guest even asked if they could take a portion of the leftovers home. In a nutshell, if you think you love curry but don't know where to start with it in your own kitchen, this is a good place to begin.

I'v made this dish twice. I've made it using mild curry powder and hot curry powder (Sharwood's) and I prefer it with the hot powder. Next time I will use a little less sour cream. I served it to guests and they all loved it. The bananas and mangos are a nice touch. The recipe makes a lot - and it's good reheated the next day. I will definately be making this dish often!

We loved this recipe! I work with an Indian woman who helped me shop for the authentic spices in this dish. I don't know if that made a difference but when I served it to my husband and our guests they raved! I will definitely make it again. One note: We like our food spicy and I thought the flavours would become diluted if I added all of the sour cream. I think I used maybe 1/4 cup.

This is a wonderful curry recipe...I've made it several times. My husband recently mentioned to a friend that I make this awesome chicken curry recipe that my mother (who is Indian) gave me...I just smiled. The only change I make is that I cut the chicken into cubes. Either way, AWESOME recipe!

Rating: 3
I am amazed at how "polarizing" curry is to cooks - everyone has a particular flavor or heat in mind. Although I do not consider this a traditional Indian curry, I like it because it is relatively quick to prepare and the creamy-mild sauce makes it a "comfort food." The recipe has worked well with a variety of eaters in my family and I make it exactly as printed.

Rating: 3
To make this with stuff that i mostly have in my house, i made several substitutions. I used a couple of tablespoons of ground ginger instead of fresh. I used bouillon (Knorr) instead of 'real' broth. I didn't bother with the applesauce or the peas. (Due to the lack of extra liquid, the flour was not necessary.) It still turned out fabulous and surprisingly authentic-tasting. The first time i made it, i made the sauce the night before -- i highly recommend this, as it thickens the sauce considerably. (I didn't know why everyone said that it was too saucy until i made it all in one go!) Also, unless you like your food very mild, you can skip the sour cream, in my opinion. I did add a little (a teaspoon-ish)good tandoor seasoning that i have, which undoubtably boosted the flavor a bit. As an accompaniment, the cucumber raita on this website from "The Indian Grocery Store Demystified" is excellent and very simple to make.

I am a chef at a luxury villa in the British Virgin Islands. We offer several choices for a welcome dinner and this is my favorite.

This was a success in our household. Taking to heart that many reviewers found it a bit "saucey" I only used 2 cups of chicken broth and a bit more than 1 lb of chicken. I found the Major Grey's chutney but I only used 1/2 cup with 1/2 of applesauce. Next time I'll be brave and use the whole cup of chutney it was very good. This dish is excellent accompanied with bananas and mangos. We thought it sounded strange but when we tried it we were pleasantly surprised.

This was easy enough to prepare but...it just didn't taste authentic. It may have been better if prepared with homemade curry seasoning. Served with the suggested condiments as well as a side of cucumber raita and fresh naan purchased at the farmers market. There are so many other curry recipes out there to try before I settle on this one.

This was delicious! I made it with less chicken, and added a few vegetables (green peppers, asparagus, zucchini, mushrooms) which I stir fried slightly before adding to the sauce... I will definitely make this again.

I made this for a birthday dinner and while it was a big hit with our "never had indian food in their lives" guests it was less thrilling for my husband and I as it wasn't nearly spicy enough - on it's own the dish was only ok - I used double the amt of hot curry & also added a teaspoon of red pepper and it was only mildly flavorful and not at all hot - next time I would definitely increase all the spices with extra ginger, garlic and a jalapeno as someone else suggested. That said...once all the garnishes were added - the cilantro and the chutney, mango, coconut etc it WAS delicious and actually fun to talk about with the guests while everyone tried the different toppings! I was astonished to find Major Grey chutney in my local Fresh Fields thai/indian aisle (it seems nothing ever works out that easily!) it is yummy and really added the sweet dimension this dish needed to be special. The brand I found was Pataks Original and the ingredients are sugar, mangoes, salt, ginger, spices, garlic pulp & oil of ginger.

This is a winner :) I made it almost as is instead of the applesauce I add my own mango chutney. I used hot curry powder and the dish was awsome. Perhaps a little too much sauce??? It went over extremely well with my family and it made alot. Will be making again soon.....

I made this dish for a group of friends last night and got rave reviews. I've already sent the recipe to half of them, and definitely would make it again myself. I wish I'd read the reviews more carefully before cooking, though, because I'd have cut down on the amount of chicken and added a few potatoes. The bananas and mangos added a nice touch. For the cooks asking about Major Grey's chutney, it's a style of chutney (think British empire) rather than a brand. Crosswell and Black (?) makes a nice, sweeter chutney; last night I used Sharwood which had a little bite to it. Both are great with pappadums!

Rating: 3
I made this last night, and the whole family enjoyed it. Most had second or third helpings. I spiced it up as suggested by adding a jalepeno, which I minced in the food processor along with the ginger and garlic. I also used hot mango chutney, subbing that for half the applesauce. I had no chicken broth-- just used a few boullion cubes dissolved in water, and it worked just as well. To the cook who asked about Major Grey chutney-- beats me-- I've wondered the same thing. Any thoughts?

I was very leery about this recipe, but loved it with the rest of my family. We're not fans of curry powder or coriander (often an ingredient in the former), so I used a mix of spices that curries often contain and 1/4 tsp. of Thai red curry paste. I used 2 lbs. of chicken and added about 1+1/2 lbs. of peeled, diced and cooked russet potatoes when I added the 'creams'. My husband loved bananas with it and we have yet to try Chutney so I didn't buy any. The rest of us enjoyed the coconut, peanuts and cilantro.

This dish was delicious and so easy to make! I took the advice of cooks before me and cranked up the heat, but I think I may have overdone it. Next time, I'll go easier. I added 3 medium cooked potatoes at the end, which made it more authentic to me. I also reduced the amount of chicken (used only 2-3 Ibs) and it was more than adequate. Will make again for sure!

Nice depth of flavors.If you like any spice at all you may want to add more heat.I used 3 tbs curry paste but found the spicyness was lost in the coconut milk and yogurt.I Added more curry along with a jalapeno and hot chili.Other than that ,the dish was excellent.I made a mulligatawny soup to start with and served the curry with homemade naan,cucumber salad and basmati rice.Next time I'll try incorporating the mango chutney in this recipe.(good suggestion).

Very good. I cranked up the heat by adding two jalepenos, with seeds. Our mouths were burning. I've also used this sauce for a beef curry, which was also tasty. Use a good quality curry powder, otherwise the spices will be somewhat muted. Good with rice, naan, and Indian or U.K. beer.

This was a great recipe. My only change was to substitute chicken stock for the chicken broth (because I had run out). I would definitely make this again but would probably use more curry (and also probably add one teaspoon of hot curry paste as it was a little too bland for my taste). Don't omit the coconut milk as I think that it really lent a wonderful flavor to the dish.

We LOVED this recipe. The flavour is really rich and lovely, and the level of spice is just perfect. I happen to like very spicy food, so I might add a bit more curry; however, my boyfriend doesn't like things to be mouth-wateringly hot. I served this with steamed Thai rice (jasmine rice), chopped banana, chopped mango, chopped peanuts and some fresh chopped coriander (cilantro) on top. Really, really excellent recipe.

i really am not a fan of chicken, but i thought this recipe was very good and interesting. i doubled the amount of curry and might triple it next time because i like spicy dishes. needed some salt for the chicken. i may decrease the chicken broth and increase the tomato paste next time. my boyfriend and i really liked this one (he loves chicken) and i thought it was pretty easy. i will definitely keep the recipe.

I think this is one of the best recipes I've tried from Epicurious. It is easy to make and it tastes even better the next day! For those who were disappointed, make sure you are using good, strong curry powder and perhaps add some butter at the end to "deepen" the flavor.

I thought this dish was delish-capish! My family of four ate this for dinner, then fought over the lunchtime leftovers. For those who thought the dish lacked depth, I used some of the previous suggestions to liven things up a bit: jalepenos in the sauce for traditional curry heat, and a mixture of half applesauce, half mango chutney to replace the entire portion of applesauce in the original recipe. I've made this twice, once omitting the sour cream at the end. Not quite as creamy, but, on the plus side, you get more heat, and less calories. Served with steamed basmati rice, and more chutney on the side. Bon Appetit!

Very simple and easy to make. I substituted about 1/4 cup golden raisins and about 1/4 cup slivered almonds instead of the peas...a great substitute!!

I really liked this curry recipe. It tasted very complex, but still well blended/rounded, and therefore, very authentic. It had none of the harsh/raw curry powder taste that some of my other, quicker, curry recipes have. And this one is very easy to make, requiring only one pot. It also makes a lot (could easily feed 10-12 w/ rice, salad, etc.), and is even better if cooked one day ahead (I made it all the way up to adding the coconut milk/sour cream). BUT IT MUST BE SPICED UP. Either use hot curry powder/more regular curry powder, or add cayenne/hot sauce/jalepeno, or both and taste as you go along. All that yogurt, broth, etc. really dilutes the sesonings.

Rating: 4
The reader from College Place must have used a hot curry powder-- this was increadably mild when prepared as written. (And almost every reviewer agreed it needed more of a kick). Nevertheless, this was wonderful, and amazingly tasty. I added jalapenos to the sauce, and it was great. Fabulous, and charming.

Lovely, filling, and authentic. Can't wait to taste the leftovers tomorrow.

Wonderful! (I've been eating it all week, not tired of it yet!) I used to make the Knorr curry, hot it up - then it went off the market. This is a bit more work but worth every bit of it. I'll be making this for my folks at Christmas!

Quite nice. I've been looking for an easy, yet elegant chicken dish to serve at parties, and this fit the bill. I made it on the weekend, and both "curry people" and "non curry people" enjoyed it. It serves a massive amount, so it's perfect for a large group. I decided to make the whole shebang, and served this with other Indian delicicies, including naan, samosas, riata, and a homemade mango chutney. (I substituted that for the applesauce). An impressive, yet uncomplicated dish... thanks to Bon Appetit for yet another successful party.

I have made this twice, and tonight I substituted beef stew for the chicken. I browned the beef first, let it simmer in some broth, and added the meat during the last ten minutes or so of cooking time. I do think that the original chicken version is easier, and it may even be tastier, but I felt like experimenting. To kick it up, heat-wise, I sneaked in two jalepenos, with seeds, which I had minced in the food processor along with the garlic and ginger and left out the sour cream. This made prep time even quicker-- and the chilis sure got us sweating! Pairs well with a good Indian or English beer.

Simple, flavorful and delicious. My husband and I enjoy curries, but the most experience I've had in making them has been buying bottled sauces from Williams-Sonoma, and adding chicken! This recipe looked easy, and if I do say so myself, tasted just like my favorite expensive stuff. Since it was just the two of us, I halved the recipe and made the following changes: only one can of chicken broth (I couldn't find reduced sodium broth, so I omitted seasoning with salt at the end), more peas, and, to add heat (thanks to other reviewer's suggestions) a scant half-teaspoon of cayenne (could've used more). Also, I mistakingly bought sweetened applesauce, but it worked out fine. I used half applesauce and half Major Grey mango chutney, and topped the curry with lots of fresh cilantro just before serving. I served this with steamed Basmatti rice as suggested. Thanks to Bon Appetit for another easy recipe to add to my repertoire.

This recipe was a three star as written and became a four star with the reader's additions. The taste changes greatly with the addition of mango chutney, which gives the dish a hot-sweet taste.

As others have noted, this recipe works very well for parties--mostly "make ahead" and relatively inexpensive. I followed it exactly, using madras curry, and found it bland. I will certainly make it again, but would use another tablespoon of hot curry and probably leave the sour cream out altogether. I used a cucumber raita off this website as a side dish and it was a perfect accompaniment. Bought nan and samosas (as directed)and had a successful evening.

There are 4 other couples that my husband and I eat with every Friday night, and I make this on a regular basis.

Outstanding. Even better the second night! Halved the recipe and served it with Fennel-Scented Spinach and Potato Samosas. I liked the "mild" nature of this curry, though I did double the curry powder, added 1 1/2 tsp. turmeric and 1/4 - 1/2 tsp. saffron. Perhaps next time I'd add one sm. chopped jalepeno. This was a big hit with my boyfriend who is generally afraid of "ethnic" foods! Def. serve with naan to sop up the sauce, and I'd forget about the rice for the sake of filling up on this delicious curry.

Really good--a flavorful, hearty, spicy, but not overly hot curry--and the recipe makes lots of it. Hands-down the best Indian chicken curry dish I've tried to make at home, beating lots of Indian cookbooks. For a special treat, use Penzey's Maharajah curry powder; otherwise, use regular sweet curry powder. I only added 2 c chicken broth instead of 3, and instead of the applesauce I used 1/3 c homemade hot mango chutney (this added the spice the dish was otherwise completely lacking) and 2/3 c Mott's mango-applesauce. Chicken thighs worked well in this dish; carrots instead of peas; and the fresh cilantro is indispensable. You can make the whole recipe to serve four and freeze half the sauce, adding more chicken and veggies when you defrost.

Rating: 4
Very robust and flavourful, like what you would get in an Indian resturant. I cranked up the heat by adding 1 jalepno with seeds, some dried red chili powder, a pinch of saffron, a bit more cumin, and left out the sour cream. I also added carrots, squash, broccoli, mushrooms, green pepper, and fresh cilantro to make it a fuller meal. It was delicious, but it certainly cleared our sinuses and got us sweating. We cooled the burn with LOTS of plain yoghurt on the side. Perhaps a few raisins would be nice in the sauce to compliment the hints of cinnamon and applesauce.

I'm sitting here very replete having devoured a rather large bowl of this curry! It is delicious. Use hot curry powder, otherwise the 'spiceness' is not enough, all the yoghurt, sour cream and cocunut milk takes the heat out. I added pre-boiled chopped potatoes, can of chopped tomatoes and mango chutney instead of the applesauce.....yummy.

My chicken-hating husband LOVED this dish! Made the curry sauce a day in advance, and the rest was a breeze. When my rice was nearly done steaming, I added the rest of the can of coconut milk, some chopped cilantro, and a bit of grated lemon peel! Yum!

Nice! Modifications: added more yogurt instead of sour cream; added ground coriander, turmeric, fennel seed; added jalapenos, red peppers, carrots; increased the amount of garlic; decreased the amount of chicken, and used thighs instead of breasts (much more tender and tasty!). I thought the addition of curry powder and applesauce were charming, in a retro way.

Great results,will definitely make again, next time a vegetarian version...no chicken at all, just cut-up veggies! I always appreciate the other reader comments and suggestions, helps me to determine if I want to make any modifications.

Excellent and Simple. I used hot curry and I doubled the ginger and garlic. Very fragrant and delicious. Half of this recipe makes plenty. I would definitely recommend this recipe to everyone.

Wonderful! Perfect combination of spices. Can always add more curry to taste. I diced the chicken (partially frozen) and pieces absorbed flavor better. 16 generous servings with another (light) main dish. Served over jasmine rice combined w/peas & carrots, curry condiments on the side. Ditto lowfat ingredients. My dinner guests loved it!

Outstanding!! Absolutely Delicious! I made this for my wife last night and it has to be the best recipie for chicken curry I've had yet! I substituted olive oil for butter and used non-fat yogurt and low fat sour cream. Delicious!!!

This is the best recipe for chicken curry I have ever found and I've been looking for years! Leave out the sour cream and add a minced jalapeno and/or some white pepper for a lower fat, spicy version.

Fabulous curry recipe -- the best I've ever tasted. It's mild, but the combination of spices and other ingredients is just delicious. It can be "heated" up by using a hot curry powder or a little Thai curry paste, but I think it's perfect just the way it is.

I make it over and over again, my husband loves it, it freezes really well.

This dish was excellent. I halved it and it still made a ton. I served it with peanuts, cucumber, raisins, and chutney. I will try adding a little cayenne next time, but otherwise it was delicious!

This is a tasty dish. I made the sauce the day before, which made the final preparation quick and easy. Be sure to use condiments. We had chutney, mango, peanuts, cilantro, and banana - this gave an interesting play of taste and texture! I also used this as an excuse to make naan for the first time. It was a perfect compliment for the dish.

This is an acceptable curry IF you do not particularly like spicy food OR if you are not familiar with authentic curries. If you are neither of the above, you'll definitely want to tinker with the spices to make the flavors sing. As a starting point, you might want to increase the spices by one half. In theory, the applesauce was an intriguing idea but in practice, I'm not sure that it made much of an impact.

I enjoyed this meal, but found it was lacking something. Perhaps adding extra spice next time would help. I did add potatoes and I made it with basmati rice which made it even more enjoyable. I would make it again.

Would add ground/fresh turmeric as well as cloves and those really hot tiny green chillis or the bigger red ones, as well as potatoes and star anise and coconut milk, now your talking a real indian curry.

This was a great dish. I added potatoes and less chicken (I'm not a big meat eater)and they tasted great. I would be careful to use a high quality applesauce. Mine was cheap and gritty and gave the curry a weird texture- otherwise yummy recipe!

a simple curry dish with not-so-simple tastes!! absolutely wonderful!

This dish was really yummy. I substituted hot curry paste for the curry powder and found the results quite pleasing. I think I'd use extra-hot paste next time! This is the perfect dinner party dish, it travels and re-heats well. Great over sticky rice.

Like the other reviews, it was a bit mild. Next time I will add more curry to spice it up or even try the jalapenos like the other person suggested. Excellent flavor and fun to eat with all the different toppings. Great when you have guests!! I highly recommend this recipe!! Easy to prepare and smells great!! I also used papadums instead of naan bread because in Maui I can't seem to find naan bread. The papadums went great also!! :-)

My husband and I loved this dish. We added a can or two of drained fruit coctail, and a tiny bit of ground cloves. It was wonderful and was even better the next day!

This is a great party dish! I used a "hot" curry, and served fresh diced pineapple, diced fresh red bell peppers and green onions, chopped hard boiled eggs, crisp crumbled bacon, and dried cranberries along with the mangoes, cilantro, coconut, peanuts and chutney suggested. It was beautiful!

It was very delicious, complex flavors, and having naan available it great for all that sauce. Have made it several times already.

I have made this dish twice and it is excellent. Prepared according to the recipe, it is very mild, so the second time I added some heat with fresh chopped jalapenos.

I have made this dish several times, for both family and guests. Everyone loves it, though it is a bit mild for my husband. I add a bit more curry and some cayenne for him, but I like it mild

AAfter trying this dish, I may become an affectionado of Indian cuisine afterall. May I suggest serving Besmahti Rice with it. I had been told that at one time Besmahti had been reserved only for the maharajas of India. I know you will enjoy it's exquisite aroma and nutlike flavor.

Great and easy recipe! My husband, who is a self-proclaimed indian food expert, loved it - wanted seconds.

I made it for a dinner party I hosted and it was a hit. We found some "Taj Mahal" beer which added more to the Indian ambiance. Naan is a must. I bought all the spices fresh from a little gourmet shop and I also added a dash of salt to bring up the flavor even more.

It was fun to search out ingredients, fun to make and delicious to eat. My parents loved it and my sister Liz is going to make it for her family, I couldn't find the coconut milk. I love this web site, keep up the good work. ps: I am not a cook but your show and web site is making me one.

Excellent Indian dish. Added a bit more curry and cumin. Would serve naan next time with the extra delicious sauce.

Have my own version, VERY similar. Add 1/2 lb. fresh or frozen cleaned-shelled shrimp for last 15 minutes cooking, super!

Really good curry, a little too mild for my family's tastes, so I added some cayanne pepper. Everyone Loved it.
