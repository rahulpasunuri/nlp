Very good, very easy. Made a couple small changes: I baked tortilla triangles (corn and flour) at 350 with some oliver oil and kosher salt for about 15 minutes. (I like the flour tortillas better; easier to eat in a salad.) I grilled the corn, as many other reviewers did, adding olive oil, salt & sugar to the cobs prior to grilling. Next time, I think I'll add some avocado slices to garnish along with the tortillas.

Delicious as is! I used store bought tortilla chips, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

This is an awesome dish. I made it almost exactly as written however, I did not make the tortilla chips and just used store bought ones. The only other changes were that I grilled the corn and I added a bit more lime juice than was called for. I also ended up using this as an appetizer. I took a brick of cream cheese, poured over some really good raspberry chipotle grilling sauce I have and then piled the corn and pepper mix on top. Served it with chips and crackers. People scarfed it up.

We love this recipe! It's delicious. We grill our corn on the cob before cutting it off for the salad. We've made this twice already and will definitely make it again. I don't really see the point in frying your own tortilla chips, I'm sure it would be good but we just use store bought chips. The marinade is amazing and its almost unbelievable how much flavor you get from just lime juice and dried oregano. We also add some red pepper flakes, garlic & some Olive Oil to the marinade.

Have made and realized I didn't have as much corn as I thought I did. I used a jar of the Trader Joe's corn and chili salsa instead of fresh corn and the scallions. Marvelous!!! Husband who "needs" his foods separate with a main course, side, and starch, adored the flavor in this very healthy dish. We used the organic corn chips from Trader Joes as forks and had a very fun and tasty meal!

I don't have a grill so instead I crusted the chicken in a coriander/cumin mix and pan seared it with olive oil. Then I sautéed red onion, corn, and black beans in the oil and spice mix left at the bottom of the pan for a roasted flavor. I made too much cumin mix and added the olive oil and lime juice to it and then tossed with corn, beans, red pepper, and generous amounts of fresh cilantro. Topped with the chicken, the arugula was totally unnecessary. It was so good!

I think the 20 other reviews say it all, but I do think cilantro and a chili pepper, salsa or other hot sauce is just the thing this needs to make it perfect.

I have to qualify this by saying I used leftover grilled chicken, so it had a few more spices than oregano and lime. I didn't bother with the chips either. But the combination of lime, arugula, corn, red peppers and chicken was fabulous on a hot summer evening. I liked the hint of cumin too. I will be making extra chicken whenever we grill now, so we can have this the next day.

Delicious and easy!!! Instead of frying the tortilla's though, I sprayed with olive oil and baked at 350 degrees for 12 min...easier and not so bad for you!!! YUMMY!

I made this salad for my boyfriend and it was a great success...it looked and tasted great! I substituted red onion for the scallions and added black beans, cherry tomatoes, and fresh cilantro, and was fairly liberal with the lime juice. Also skipped making the tortilla chips and just broke up some store bought ones over the top. Yum!

This is a really nice recipe - easy, flavorful. I used left over chicken, cut into strips and warmed up using a little olive oil, oregano and lime juice. And - we have a Mexican bodega a town over that sells homemade tortillas. So - the meal came together relatively quick and it was ever so delish - I love this website.

Salad was delicious, I added a little chipolte pepper dressing to the center of each salad for a little kick.

Wonderful summer salad to take to a picnic. I marinated the chicken overnight, added some chopped fresh basil with the fresh oregano along with chopped orange and red bell peppers in the final mixing of ingredients. The colors were wonderful together. For extra flavor I added a little extra lime juice. Placed it over garden fresh leaf lettuce. Will definitely serve it again.

I have made this several times. Easy, quick and adaptable to what is on hand. Add tomatoes, clinatro and black beans to the corn for a change. The chicken improved with the addition of a little red pepper.

Very good, I added cilantro to the recipe. I will make it again, everyone liked it.

I made this for a group and it was a big hit. The lime juice really jazzed up the flavor. It is a simple recipe and easy to make ahead. I skipped the chips and just served with wrap bread and pita bread. Really fresh, colorful and delicious. Oh... it's healthy too.

I agree with the cook who added cilantro; however, I thought the dressing was a bit heavy on the cumin. I would add less next time. Overall, a very nice salad.

I took a few short-cuts with this one and it was still a big hit. I had half of a left-over roasted chicken, cleaned it off the bones and made it with the dressing, used fresh corn on the cob. I skipped making the chips and bought a bag of healthy low-fat ones instead. I shared it with a friend and it was a big hit. The comment: "It tasted light and healthy; but it was delicious."

This salad is nice and light. I normally don't like it when people say the added so many different ingredients that it changes the whole dimension of the recipe. However, I did on so on this occassion. In my opinion a bunch of cilantro, 1 tsp brown sugar, 1 tsp garlic and 1 tsp salt were necessary and made this salad delicious. With out these changes it would be so so. I also used red leaf lettuce, 5 chopped dates, and black beans.

A very tasty and light summer dish. I added extra cumin and fresh cilantro and substituted red onion for the chives.

I made this recipe for a summer luncheon for 20 women. It was fantastic! The chicken-lime marinade is wonderful and something I have used just for grilled chicken dinners. I added cilantro to the mix as well -- it makes the difference.

This was very good and easy to prepare. My husband AND my 3 year old son both loved it!! I followed the recipe, except I used Romaine Lettuce. I will definetly make this again.

Very tasty! I changed the recipe as follows: To the chicken marinade I added ground chipotle chile for a kick. I fireroasted the red bell pepper; added 2 jalapenos (also fireroasted and chopped) and added chopped cilantro. I didn't have arugula but used Boston. I increased the oil, oregano, etc., to adequately moisten the salad ingredients. WOW! I would highly recommend for a summer evening - it's more than enough for a light dinner. Wouild be great for entertaining!
