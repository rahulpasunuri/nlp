I applaud Bon Appetit for printing this recipe. It was absolutely incredible. I subbed regular prime beef for wagyu, and balsamic for the vinegar. It came out perfect. Will absolutely make it again. To the reviewers who want easy, "homemade" cooking with canned veggies, flank steak, and button mushrooms, you're on the wrong website. Thank God there's one safe haven left for people who truly love cooking. Thank you, Bon Appetit.

Great steak. Sauce was fairly good. Now - to comment on all the bashers of extravagant recipes in BA: ENOUGH! I love the exotic and the everyday together. It works. And you know what, some day you will be looking for a crazy recipe to try and when you go back and find one like this it'll make your day.

I cant speak for real Japanese Kobe beef, but Australian Wagyu (same breed) in stores generally comes in grades that range from Marble Score (MBS) 4 to 9: the higher the number, the higher the level of fat and tenderness and evenness of marbling. I bought a thick MBS4 strip steak today at Kem Chicks in Jakarta , priced equiv. US$28 a pound. It was superb and reminded me of the corn-fed, highly marbled steaks that were available in the U.S. in the 50s and 60s. I dont think the megabucks genuine-Kobe is necessary for one to enjoy the tenderness and flavor of this special breed of cow without taking much away from the intended luxury of the recipe. Check out bedrockmeat.com.au for a little more information and relative prices. And as for the sauce, I think any high-quality condimenti-quality (sweet) balsamic would work well. It is nice to see a luxurious recipe here and there - many of us want a recipe for a super-special occasion and heaven knows there are plenty of sites offering decent recipes for the frugal.

succulent and delicious-just like a steak should be. Fabulous.

Not very impressed. I love exotic ingredients and yes, it was expensive but that is what experimenting and indulging is all about! However, the vinegar completely drowned out the truffles and we found it was not worth the effort or the cost.

This was absolutely awesome. Granted, it was a bit pricey but it's worth it for those really special occasions. I used filet mignon instead of the cut suggested in the recipe. And many thanks to the others (who actually reviewed the recipe) for suggesting the balsamic. And let me just say....this is not a message board. Rant elsewhere.

Wow, this has been fun reading...you all made me laugh. Thank-you... I think I'll try this recipe now. I've got some New York steaks and some Black Truffle oil. Hmmm... I wonder...

I thought this was an impressive recipe, and agree with previous raters that it takes some time/investment but is worth it. Those "elusive" ingredients (vinegar and truffles) also available at www.lepicerie.com.

I tried this recipe w/ Angus beef and balsamic vinegar as suggested and it was fantastic! Maybe ytarch1 didn't realize that we're rating recipes (that we've actually tried!)here not reviewing magazines or their editors. Really - who cares about your ennui?

Certainly, it's fine to print a few recipes that require substitutions and/or a second mortgage to prepare... but I've found that in general Bon Appetit has gone downhill in quality and reasonability since Barbara Fairchild has taken over as editor. I used to love the magazine, but I've let my subscription lapse just because I'm sick of receiving the magazine and halfheartedly looking through it. Nothing really catches my interest anymore.

I also tried this recipe w/ Angus beef and subbed good quality Balsamic Vinegar from Modena for the Banyuls. The taste was fantastic; out of the ordinary and so quick! As for those who don't like this type of recipe - either skip them or go over to allrecipes where you can find plenty of recipes that use "easily found" ingredients like box mixes and cool whip! There's a reason this site is called Epicurious.

I made this for a special occasion using nicely marbled Angus steaks instead of Wagyu beef. I found that the sauce and vinaigrette complimented the beef without overpowering it. I can't understand all the complaints about a recipe featuring hard to find and expensive ingredients. It's not difficult to make substitutions and end up with a reasonable facsimile of the dish if you don't want to seek out or spend the money on the listed ingredients. This is like saying Wine Spectator shouldn't write about Chateau Petrus since you'll never find it at your local Safeway, or you can't afford it.

Okay, here's a thought. Why would you want to slather a hugely expensive piece of Wagyu beef with an intense sauce? Although I've never had Wagyu, I've had Kobe, and it's best when savored on its own without anything competing with its meltingly sweet taste and texture. If you're really going to splurge on the best, why cover it up? Second of all, recipes like this are precisely why I cancelled my BA subscription years ago. Try Cooks Illustrated. Maybe not quite as adventurous, but they design the recipes around ingredients most people can readily find, and test them 20-40 times to see what ingredients and cooking methods work best. Much better for those of us who don't have time to search the earth for arcane ingredients and try a recipe 10 times until you find the one that tastes best. Come on over to Cooks with me.

I throughly enjoyed this dish, I did substitute the wagyu beef for a more financially friendly venison tenderloin that my husband hunted and butchered himself. I think that as a self taught chef, or any other home chefs, we need to be a little creative in substituting ingredients based on our own budget or taste. These reipes are guidlines, not mantra.

If this recipe is, in the words of the previous reviewer (who told us all to relax, by the way, so we better shut up learn not to express opinions) NOT for the home cook, then what sense does it make to print it in a magazine for exactly that type of person? What exactly is Bon Appetit for, if not for someone who likes to cook its recipes at home?

Relax people- you have to put this recipe in perspective! Bon appetit only printed a recipe this decadent because they were printing recipes on some of the top food trends in 2004! Wagyu beef has been popping up on restaurant menus all over the place. While not for the home cook, it's still nice to see a recipe. By the way, I've tried Wagyu beef and believe me- it lives up to the hype. It is the most flavorful, melt-in-your mouth delicious steak I've ever had.

This is exactly the type of recipe I'm fed up of seeing in Bon Appetit. I have written to the magazine asking that reasonable, do-able, and tasty recipes once again be its main focus. It's fine to print a recipe for a dish that requires a specialty ingredient or two every few months, but expecting readers to try Wagyu beef is going too far. I counted no less than five ingredients in the January '05 issue that necessitated mail order. Whatever happened to recipes shoring up easily accessible, grocery store ingredients? I'm anxious to see those back in what used to be my favorite cooking magazine.

C'mon guys; it is nice to see the totally pricy dishes too. With a little thought one can always figure out replacements for the items which are too expensive.

How about no forks. I saved this reipe so I could mark the day that Epicurious went crazy. Please return to Planet Earth with reasonable recipes.

I too have used the Two Sisters Gourmet Black Truffle Bordeaux Sauce. It's great. And for the steak, use inexpensive beef tenderloin (17.99/lb)instead of the expensive Wagyu (119.00/lb). Better yet, have your butcher tenderize a flank steak. The flavor is in the sauce baby.

If you want to save time (and money) making the sauce, I found a Balck Truffle Bordeaux sauce that is more than excellent. You can get it from Two Sisters Gourmet at www.twosistersgourmet.com/culinarycoach

Seems pricey for sure....however, you can get a great bottle of cabernet for less than $25. if you know how to choose wine. The price of wine is not how to rate it's quality.

The reviewer from Maine forgot to add the Banyuls vinegar and cab to her mortgage. Certainly at the quality of the other ingredients, we wouldn't want a cab at less than $25. I'm surprised the recipe didn't specify the winery. Steaks from Lobels, $180.00; truffles from Marky's, $23.00; vinegar $16.00; and wine, $25.00. Total including remaining ingredients and shipping about $275.00. Who's your average reader, BA?

Am applying for a home equity loan to make this one. Are you kidding me? Get real, B.A. - Wagyu beef & truffles? How about an affordable version - dry-aged beef and porcini?
