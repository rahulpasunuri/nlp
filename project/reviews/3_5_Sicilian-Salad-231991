Was assigned this as my part of a menu and thought it sounded dull. It was, instead, terrific. Used first rate olive oil and instead of Bibb, substituted the pale centers of three heads of Boston lettuce. It was a big hit.

This was good not great. I'd make it again to go with a sicilian type of meal but other than that it's nothing special.

Delicious salad. I made as written, except substituted Romaine lettuce for Bibb. Will definately make all summer.
