DeLICIOUS. I added way more cumin and a few drops of hot sauce, and left out the onions and peppers since I'm not a pepper fan. I used one jar of Trader Joe salsa and one jar of Trader Joe Garlic Chipotle salsa which was a good choice. Used white beans instead of kidney beans and melted in some shredded cheese. Will definitely make again.

Very good with few changes. Used 1lb beef (90/10) and 1lb turkey sausage (hot Italian), and added a can of tomato paste. The frozen onion/pepper mix was a great idea and the Birds-Eye mix adds awesome color. The salsa I used was very good, preservative/soy free... which I think is important. Yum.

Made this with ground turkey and cans of Rotelle (instead of salsa) and it was great - the rotelle gave it some kick. I browned the meat and threw the whole thing in a crockpot and it was really easy.

I agree with the cook from Rowlett, Texas--this needs more spice. It's a great recipe, just kick it up a notch: BAM!

I think this is all about the salsa that you use. Go gourmet (Trader Joe's has some GREAT options!). I just threw in a bunch of spices, and even cut the recipe in half. Great quick chili, this will become a staple in our house!

This was a very easy recipe, but needs more spice. I will experiment with it next time. I might add tabasco or some chipotle peppers
