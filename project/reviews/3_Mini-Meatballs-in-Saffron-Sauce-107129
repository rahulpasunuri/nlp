I made this recipe so many times now! I lived in Spain when I was young - and they taste the exact same way our Spanish au pair used to make them... Very happy - Penelope never disappoints!

Both the meatballs and the sauce, despite using good quality ingredients, were utterly tasteless. After reading the reviews on here I was so looking forward to trying this dish. Followed the recipe with care but I couldn't have been more disappointed.

We LOVED these! I made the recipe pretty much as written, except I used 1/3 cup plain dry breadcrumbs instead of the slice of french bread, and I cut the salt in the meatballs by half. They turned out great. Not greasy at all, and the sauce was awesome. I made them and dusted them with the flour about 3 hours early, then put them in the fridge til I was ready to fry them. We had them as part of a tapas buffet, but I would definitely make them again as an entree.

I made this for a spanish tapas party. It was a more complicated version of this recipe that I found in a tapas cookbook by Penelope Casas from 1985. It is obviously where this recipe got its base. It added chopped celery and bacon to the meatball mixture and beef and chicken stock (to make a veal stock), and flour to the broth. At the end, garlic, parsley, and saffron are mashed in a mortar. This is stirred in at the VERY end. This was definitely salty. I would have used low sodium broth and not added the extra salt to the meatballs. Especially with the addition of bacon, the meatballs get enough of that salty smoky flavor.

I made this as part of a Christmas Eve tapas buffet, and it was the HIT of the night. They were very flavorful, and the sauce was great. I used a mixture of ground turkey and ground pork for the meatballs. I also used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of the bread. I made the meatballs ahead of time, dusted them flour and stored them in the refrigerator. I pulled them out to cook right before the party. YUM! I will be adding these to my New Year's Eve buffet, too.

Way too salty. Next time they will be delicious. Freeze well.

Not good. The saffron overpowered the other flavors and it just wasn't good. Fortunately I made these the day before my party and was able to throw them out and make something else. I went with the meatballs in red wine gravy instead.

I used my butcher's meatloaf mix of ground pork, ground veal, and ground beef. I also doubled the recipe but (inadvertently) only used one egg. I also substituted 1/3 cup plain breadcrumbs in place of the the French bread. The meatballs were terrific. I didn't have any trouble with their falling apart.

Great concept, but WAY too salty. I will cut the meatball salt in half next time. I added some paprika to the meat mixture. I would also freeze the meatballs for a little while before cooking them -- they were very soft and went flat while cooking. Not ball-y at all.

I am the cook from Boston who wrote the previous review, and I am amending my review. I refrigerated the leftovers and had some the next day, and these do improve quite a bit after sitting for a while. I would recommend making them a day ahead and then re-heating them with the sauce. I would also suggest using about half the salt, and keeping a sharp eye on the sauce as it simmers (mine boiled away completely and I had to re-do the sauce in a separate pot.)

Rating: 1
These taste like the sort of thing I'd eat at a cocktail party only after several drinks and if everything else had run out. Not at all what I was expecting. The only good thing was the consistency; the veal-pork mixture is perfect, so I'll be using that combo in other meatball recipes. But other than that, this is one of the strangest-tasting recipes I've ever made.

Like Swedish meatballs? Real ones? Then you're likely to appreciate this recipe. If you believe meatballs should include lots of oregano and cheese and need to be swimming in a garlicky tomato sauce, move on - these are good, too, but in another realm from this recipe. I made 200+ of these for a New Year's party and I'm returning to make them for dinner for my family. Here's a few tips: do not scrimp on the saffron or the parsley. Good saffron is worth it and the sauce NEEDS it to taste right. The brightness of the parsley is what balances the earthiness of the saffron. These can be made ahead - gently put them in a dish to hold overnight and chill them. Plan to degrease the sauce as it does separate in the cooling. Watch the recipe as 1/2 the garlic is used in the beginning and 1/2 later - recipe should be rewritten. I served it from a chafing dish for the party, tonight I will serve it with homemade spaetzle - yum. One last note: the veal is KEY here as it keeps the meatballs from turning into heavy little lumps of meat. The veal makes them light and sublime - I couldn't find ground veal that day so I bought a large piece of veal shoulder and I ground it myself in my food processor. I think I will only do it this way from now on as assured that the meat was lean. One last word: DELISH!

I have made this dish several times for my own parties, parties that I have attended, etc. The meatballs were gone usually within 10 minutes. Even my 12 nieces and nephews loved them!! Everyone begged me to make more the "next" time.

Good but not as spectacular as I had expected they would be. A little greasy (would cut back on the olive oil another time)for an appetizer but not bad over pasta as a main course. This was even with my mistake of buying veal and lean grd beef rather than grd. pork. Salt was also on the high side even with low-salt broth. I did enjoy the earthy flavor of the saffron and paprika, so will try again with the adjustments

I thought from all the previous reviews that this would have a special taste to it. I found it bland at best, boring at worst. I followed the recipe to the "T" and still disappointed.

Yum! made exactly as specified, save substituting ground turkey thigh for veal because of anti-veal guests. Savory and very impressive in a tapas spread - worth the minor effort of rolling & frying 35 wee meatballs. Easy to do ahead. Everyone loved 'em and left me no leftovers.

Loved it! I made it for the first time on Sunday, served over rice and like it so much, we had it again on Thursday, served over pasta. I did take the meatballs out of the sauce and use a paper towel to get the fat off the top.

This was delicious! I was going to make meatloaf with the ground pork/beef/veal mixture I bought, but tried this instead. I made it as a main course so I made the meatballs larger (2") and my husband wanted pasta so I boiled some orechiette pasta and then served the meatballs and saffron sauce in individual shallow pasta bowls over the orechiette, and passed grated asiago cheese. Yum! Just like a California Cafe pasta dish! My only criticism is the sauce got a bit greasy, I think I needed to use a fat-free chicken broth and also would drain the meatballs on paper-towels before adding back to the pan next time. I thickened the sauce with just a bit of flour mixed in extra broth and stirred in right at the end. Very good!

This is probably the first one-fork I've given on this site. I made these with several other finger-type foods for guests. While some of the guests seemed to like these, I just didn't care for the flavor. This really surprised me since the recipie sounded so good when I read it. I'll be looking for another meatball appetizer recipie.

Made the recipe for the firs time on New Year's Eve. It was big hit. I did use a mix of ground buffale and elk. Used three cloves of garlic and 1 teaspoon of paprika. Oh, and I mxed about a 1/3 cup of chopped walnuts into the meat. Really enjoyed and will make again.

I had problems finding ground veal so I substituted ground sirloin and it worked just fine. My company devoured every meatball. Plan on serving it again very soon!

I made this with ground turkey, half white, half thigh. I also used dried breadcrumbs because I didn't have any bread and added some extra garlic to the meatballs and sauce (inadvertent, note that the meatball portion of the recipe contains sauce ingredients). My sauce came out nice and thick -- in fact, I needed to add some additional wine. Very solid & flavorful, and different from traditional Italian or Swedish meatballs. I am a big fan of Penelope Casas' "Tapas" book (the person who did the group of recipes that included this one) and didn't find this any trouble to make on a weeknight alongside a salad. The trick of dredging the meatballs in flour is also worth taking away. Turkey tends to stew, but these came out brown and yummy.

Everyone at these at a party I gave, but I personally didn't really care for them. Something odd about the mix of flavors. They weren't awful, but I'd probably do something different with mini meatballs next time.

I made this recipe for our holiday party. It was a huge hit. I actually made it the night before the party and I had to fight my husband off who was begging to eat them that night. I did change one thing, I bought ground lamb instead of ground veal by mistake. This may have made the meatballs a bit more flavorful and interesting. I will definatly make this recipe again.

Simply awful. A bottle of sweet and sour sauce over the meatballs would have tasted much better and taken less time and money.

I made this recipe for a party and it was a huge hit - the meatballs were gone in about 5 minutes even though I had doubled the recipe and people were asking for more. Next time I will quadruple it. This is a bit time consuming to make but definitely worth it. I did not make any adjustments and the sauce came out nice and thick.

I made 6 batches of this recipe yesterday for a party tonight. As noted by others, the sauce is like a broth and isn't as thick as I'm used to seeing in a buffet-style meatball, even after adding arrowroot. Also, I had to substitute ground chuck for the pork, but the taste is wonderful! I will make this again using the pork and more flour. A note for the editors: it would be helpful to have the garlic and parsley mesurements for the sauce included in with the sauce ingredients rather than in the meatball grouping.

This recipe was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. Made them and then refrigerated over night, then froze them to serve later in the week. I made the recipe pretty much as written, used a little extra wine and broth. This recipe easily doubles. Saved the left over sauce and simmered shrimp in it a few days later. Delicious!!! Will definitely make again in some form.

These were OK, not great, not bad, just OK. I had more than enough sauce and the only thing I added more of was onion. I brought them to a cocktail party, and so I boiled the sauce off, so they wouldn't be too messy. People enjoyed them, but they weren't fabulous.

Cook from New Hampshire: Saffron should hold it's flavor a while, but you may have gotten old saffron, or if you purchased it in powder form, then what you most likely got was paprika, not saffron. Never purchase it in any other form than threads. To revive it, put the threads in a small amount of boiling water and let it sit for a few minutes. Add the water and threads to whatever you are making. Some people just don't like the taste of saffron; my husband can't stand it.

Yes, I agree, however, perhaps I just do not understand the spice. It is very expensive, and I have tried it in several recipes, I just cannot seem to ?taste? it. I did try this recipe and found it bland and unappealing. I think it is me, I cannot taste it! Annoying as it should be good. Oh well. I will admit to a love of white truffle oil! Note bene: the flavor of the oil dissipates over time, so use it in large amounts and enjoy it.

Fantastic recipe! I made the excellent dish even better by making a few changes. Cut out the pork and veal and use imported Kobe beef from Japan, which you should grind yourself. Also, add about 1/4 lb. of diced foie gras to the mix for added moistness. For the sauce, substitute Dom Perignon for the plain old "white wine" called for in the recipe. It's a subtle touch, but well worth it. Finally, shave some fresh white truffles over the top and drizzle on some truffle oil at the very end. I can't wait to make this again!

I haven't made this recipe yet, so don't clobber me! :) I just wanted to chime in on the saffron question. For those who use saffron frequently (like me), it is more economical to buy a large quantify. I bought a 1 ounce tin through the Baker's Catalogue for about $50. I've had it for several years, despite the fact I use it frequently with seafood dishes, paella, risotto and sauces (crab cakes w/ saffron aoili). It has a long shelf life, unlike other spices/herbs. A pinch mixed into cooked, buttered orzo (add to a tablespoon of hot water) is awesome. Anyway, just thought I'd mention another source for this wonderful spice.

Saffron threads are now found in most supermarkets in the little glass jars. It will look almost empty as the saffron is in a small envelope. A better source is any of your good markets. I usually get mine at an Italian specialty market which has many gourmet items. Plan to spend about $15 dollars, but it's worth it. There is no substitute for the flavor. (There are many mail-order sources for spices, too. But I'm sure you can find it someplace close to you.)

This is the first time I have actually read the reviews of a recipe. What a hoot! Sometimes you can read recipe and just know that it would not taste good to you, but how one can actually rate a recipe without making and tasting it blows me away.

I agree with the cook who said this was garlicky and redolent...very true and we liked this very much. I also served it over thin spaghetti. It's a different recipe for meatballs like the Norwegian Meatballs in Spiced Cream Sauce, which is very different and delicious. I think adding the tablespoon of crushed garlic to the sauce 10 minutes before serving makes the sauce so yummy.

This dish sounds like something that would make me want to write a comment saying that the dish seemed good. All of these "reviews" from people who actually made it just confuse the issue - now my judgement as to whether or not I think this dish would be tastey on an abstract level, is clouded by extraneous information about what this recipe is really like. Why can't people just keep their "facts" to themselves, as to not subconsciously bias our own interpretations of the essence of this recipe in it's purest state of being: unmade and uneaten?

My husband loved this recipe. It was the first time I've ever used saffron so I am not sure what its impact was. The only problem I had was that I was only able to make about 22 meatballs. I will definitely make this again and add more liquid for sauce.

After reading the reviews of those who did not try this recipe, I had to make it just to submit a 'real' review. No offense, but really, how can you rate something you've not made. This dish was wonderful. I made two batches so I could compare the actual directions to my variations. Following the recipe exactly resulted in little sauce for my families liking and it was was not thick enough. Excellent flavor regardless. In my version, I doubled the sauce and all the ingredients in the sauce (garlic, parsley onion, saffron, paprika, wine and broth) and used Arrowroot w/water to thicken it. It had much more sauce to cover the noodles. This is a keeper.

My daughter and I made this recipe last night and the whole family loved it. Next time I will try using a little more flour on the meatballs in hopes that the sauce will thicken up a little better. The parsley added a wonderful fresh flavor to the meatballs. We served it over pasta and it was DELICIOUS!

I agree with last reviewer. The previous "reviews" are hardly that. These recipes need to be tried out before one writes in this space. That's at least how it is usually done here as far as I have seen. That's the point of the forks, right?

I'm sorry, I realize you all mean well and have an opinion but the point of this forum is to rate the recipe which will in turn help other cooks who want to try the recipe.

Sounds delicious and easy to make. As a young cook in my twenties I am in a quest to find the right recipes for family get-togethers that don't take a lot of time. This is one that I am definitely adding to my recipe box. This is an easy to make recipe even for the most kitchen-challenged person. The only way to learn how to cook well is to try, try and try again. This is one recipe that will impress without the fuss. To the fellow cook in Annapolis: The bread is mixed into the meat mixture:)

Looks good to me also. I've been thinking how fun it would be to have an "all meatball" party. Everyone goes for them. The french bread is for bread crumbs to bind the meatballs together. I suppose you could use dry crumbs or fresh crumbs from white bread and not buy a baguette. For Italian meatballs, you mix bread crumbs with parmesan to bind.

Now this is going to be good, I just know. I will make it tonight. I have been rather suprised how some recipes lately are long drawn out and a bit too fussy for most. The younger crowd growing up and starting families have had no cooking experience...never taken home ec classes like we in our 50s and 60s did. Lets see more REAL dishes. I don't have the inclination to be bothered with fussy dishes, anymore. Ending on a nice note...I do however, love reading them.
