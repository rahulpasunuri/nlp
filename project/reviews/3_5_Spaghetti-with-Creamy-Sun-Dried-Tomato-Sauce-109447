I made it with wide pappardelle. The bacon needed more time to go crispy so I added it back with the onion. That needed to be turned up to full heat to go brown. I doubled the sauce quantities as everyone suggested and used some water to thin the sauce. I do feel like I ate a heart attack but it was good. I used pecorino instead of parmesan.

This is a pretty good recipe. I would add more sauce next time, because it is a little too dry. Spaghetti or Linguini is best with it. On the bright side, I would definitely make this again!

This was an easy and flavorful dish. I don't care for sun dried tomatoes so next time, I will just use canned tomatoes with a rough chop. I sauteed chopped mushrooms with the onions and they were really tasty in the end product. Last, I added some fresh thyme when I added the cream and it was a nice addition, I will definitely do that next time. This is a good dish that can be modified depending on what you have on hand (different pasta, different flavorings, etc.). My only critique is that there was not enough sauce for the pasta. Next time, I will double the sauce. There should be at least enough to coat the pasta, IMO, and be noticeable.

Lovely. Tripled the garlic (we're Greek), used loose sun dried tomatoes that I soaked in a cup boiling water to soften, 1 1/3 cup cream and about half cup of the pasta water. Would re-make!

really very good. i went for about 200 mls of cream and added all of the water, be sure to crisp the bacon nicely though, mushy bacon will want to be avoided. Very rich though, definitely not a diet food.

Loved this recipe! Took the advice of another reviewer and used pancetta, scallions, and four cloves of garlic. I used 1 cup of the heavy cream. Simmered longer than I should have and it was thick. After adding spaghetti to pan, then mixing, I added pasta water to thin the sauce. It was great. My 10-year-old daughter also loved it. I would order this at a restaurant.

I had some wonderful organic ravioli that needed a sauce to do them justice. This was an easy, delicious, decadent sauce. I sprinkled chopped basil for color and topped the pasta with it.

Yum! Heart-attack on a plate, but oh so tasty. I think I will try it minus the bacon next time, for a vegetarian variation.

This pasta dish is OUTSTANDING! The second time I made it, I increased the amounts of most of the ingredients. Especially the cream. (It was a little dry the first time) This is an excellent main dish that is sure to please all palates!

Made it with gnocci. Not saucy enough so I added more cream. Delicious!! Pancetta sounds good!

Great flavor - I did add about a Tbsp of tomato paste to "pink it up" a bit. Loved the bacon.

Rich, yummy.

I loved the combination of ingredients, but I thought the proportion was off--too little sauce for 1 lb. of pasta. I think the sauce is only enough for 8 oz. of pasta. I added a sprinkling of fresh basil.

I think this is dish has lots of flavor, and is a quick and welcome alternative to marina and other traditional sauces. Sometimes I use precooked bacon slices to shave off more prep time.

I'll give it points for being quick and easy, but otherwise, I'm not impressed. Something with so much bacon, onion, and other strong flavors should pack more of a punch.

Really yummy! I added some chicken breasts and used a tablespoon of butter to saute the onions b/c I didn't have bacon, but other than that, it was fabulous.

Delicious! We thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Will definitely make again. It was so easy. I've already been asked for the recipe.

I really liked this recipe. The flavors were subtle but very nice. I also like that it uses only a small amount of meat as flavoring. The only change that I made was to add some sliced mushrooms to the onion and garlic step. I would have liked even more, but didn't have them. I was thinking that artichoke hearts would be a nice addition as well. My only real complaint was that it was not enough sauce for the pound of pasta the recipe called for. I think I ended up using half or maybe a little more.

As most other people have said, this is very easy to make, and has a lovely subtle flavour. My kids ate it all, and they usually prefer pasta on its own! I added more cream and a few more chopped tomatoes, and let everyone else adjust salt and peper to their own liking. Definitely one for a quick meal, and one for keeps.

I made this just like South Orange County did, and also added sauteed mushrooms. Delicious!!!!! The whole family loved it!

Absolutely delicious! After browning the bacon, I poured off a lot of the bacon fat, added a bit of olive oil, then sauteed boneless, skinless chicken breasts. After the breasts were browned and almost cooked, I removed them then continued with the recipe as written. I added about 1/3 cup of fresh, chopped basil and returned the chicken while the sauce simmered, thinning as necessary with chicken broth. I served the sauce over sliced chicken on linguini -- it was both delicious and pretty. Definitely perfect for company.

Great pasta recipe, easy to make and very flavorful. Has become one of my classics. A nice change from tomato-sauce-based recipes

I used the sauce over pork tenderloins and my guests were asking for the recipe. It was a little thick for the pasta, so I mixed olive oil, garlic and parmesan cheese, sprinkled parsley over the penne and everyone was happy. I will use the sauce over meat and fish, it was delicious!

I thought this was a very flavorful dish, and it got great family reviews. I saved time by using pre-cooked bacon (gasp) but agree that using good quality sun dried tomatoes helps.

Good, easy and fast. You can't ask for more on a busy night. I used pancetta instead of bacon and garnished with lots of basil.

This is excellent! Reminds me of the pasta courses we have had in Italy. Use the best sundried tomatoes that you can find. The recipe is easy and the results are molto benne!

I am fairly accomplished in the kitchen and the recipe wasn't hard to follow, but the end result was yuck. Won't do this one again.
