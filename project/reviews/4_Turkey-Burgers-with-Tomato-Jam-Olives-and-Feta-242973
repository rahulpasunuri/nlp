These burgers are delicious. I follow the recipe exactly. You MUST make the tomato jam to go with!

These are pretty fantastic. I ended up making the recipe as written, then cooking a test batch to taste for seasonings. Like others, I decided the onions needed sauteing prior to mixing with meat. I also used half organic chicken breast and thigh meat instead of turkey. I added more olives, feta and rosemary then called for. Freeze nicely.

What wonderful flavors with turkey! I add a bit more feta to keep the burgers moist. I've made it several times and it's so good; I like this better than any hamburger.

Spectacular! Even without the jam. I can't imagine they would be the same "burger" with green stuffed olives instead of Kalimata. Try them once just as written. I was "generous" with the rosemary and the feta, but it was truly one of the best non-beef burgers I've ever had, let alone made. The Tomato Jam is a nice addition, but for just a week-night dinner, great without. I serve without a bun for hubby's low-carb diet and just a salad on the side.

These are outstanding! Everyone was obsessed with them at a cookout I hosted, even die-hard beef burger guys! The tomato jam is a must.

Wow these were good. I used goat cheese and almond stuffed green olives instead. As well, I minced a yellow onion finely and microwaved 2/3 c for a double recipie with a tsp of water for one minute. before adding.

Just made these substituting the feta with a parmesan because that's all I had. Delicious and very easy to make. I definitely see making this part of the meal rotation especially since you can freeze any remaining burgers for the week, etc.

YUM! Hubby said it was the best turkey burger ever. I changed it up a bit for my Mediterranean man. I didn't have any Kalamata olives so I used garlic stuffed green olives instead. I also added about a cup on Panko bread crumbs. Keeping with my Mediterranean theme, we used traditional hummus instead of the normal burger condiments.

Tried this last night, and it was a big winner, truly excellent. My first time with ground turkey in anything and what a great introduction. Delicious without the jam. The tomato jam was unremarkable by itself, but an incredible match/addition to the burger. Will be on the next menu with friends. Thanks!!

very tasty - use low fat feta and it would be extremely healthy. will certainly make it again.

Very disappointed with this recipe - dry and tasteless.

I was worried about the patties falling apart but they didn't. I suspect the olive oil holds them together. Onions have to be finely chopped. This was an excellent, light, tasty burger which I make regularly now.

I thought these were great.. made the recipe as written with the exception of adding an egg as one reviewer suggested for fear they might fall apart and serving them on ciabatta rolls. Will definitely make these again!

Ok so I have never written a review before, but had to with this one. I made this for some friends and they moaned the entire time. The one thing I would do different is add a bit more rosemary and my onions were a bit too big......great recipe!!!!!!!

This was the best turkey burger I have ever had. Did add an egg like one reviewer suggested. Stayed together great. Did it on the grill pan indoors (raining) and they turned out delicious! Have printed 5 copies of the recipe to give to all my friends.

So good my boyfriend ate two. Turkey burgers can tend to taste too dry, but these did not. These were flavor packed and fairly healthy. Would definitely make these again.

I was looking for something to make on a Tuesday night with the ground turkey I happened to have. I didn't want to make the standard Hamburger Helper look-alike meal, which seems to be a common application for things as unexciting as ground turkey. This recipe ended up working out really well. It tasted great and didn't feel super heavy. I didn't have olives so I used piquillo peppers. Also - although I'm a certified onion-lover, this recipe could use half the onions called for. The tomato jam worked well as a condiment. I'll definitely keep this recipe.

What a GREAT BURGER! I highly recommend this to all who read this review! The tomato jam is absolutely wonderful as a condiment for this burger and any other grilled dish such as chicken or fish!

I love this recipe. Its just a refreshing take on the whole burger story. I added jalapeno to the tomato jam and it was a welcomed addition. The sauce is otherwise mild and nice, but if you like it spicy I would recommend the fresh pepper. My boyfriend said he doesn't generally care for Turkey Burgers, but he really liked this. In fact he had one for breakfast the next day. Crowd pleaser, nuff said.

WOW! This was so good! Was a big hit at a family gathering (father-in-law asked if the beef was special... erm...). Even friends who announce they don't like turkey burgers had seconds. I enjoy these so much I periodically get a craving for them. The tomato jam, olives and feta were different and made it special. Going to try out the recipe with lamb tonight with a tzatziki sauce. Can't wait!

I used ground chicken and regular hamburger buns and it was still great. It'd be great for picnics too

Followed recipe exactly and they were AWESOME. The tomato jam is a must. For those looking to eat healthier, try Arnold Select Sandwich Thins. I used the whole-grain sandwich thins and it was delicious - tasty and healthy. I'm sure big crusty rolls would be delicious, too...

Moist and flavorful burger. Next time I'll add an egg to the meat because I had some issues with the patties not staying intact.

These are great - did them indoors in a cast iron skillet because it was pouring down rain outside, which worked just fine - med heat for 5 minutes per side. Tomato jam is essential! Didn't have thyme, used red pepper flakes. Different from intent of recipe, but turned out well.

Rating: 4
This was very good! I actually used a yellow onion instead of a red, plus I omitted the rosemary (I don't like the taste of it). It was flavorful, but I do think that the Tomato Jam helped round out all the flavors. I also made a couple small burgers and added them to a salad, topped with a red wine vinaigrette and feta. Definitely a keeper especially if you are trying to cut down on red meat.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe but have made a few slight changes. As another reviewer suggested, I saute the onions and mix in those with a small bit of uncooked onions, otherwise it's a lot of raw onions. I also use Mark Bittman's tomato jam recipe, one of the best things about summer! I also use the recipe from a recent Gourmet for homemade hamburger buns. This is always a crowd pleaser.

Excellent burger! Loved the tomatoe jam that went with it. Very fresh tasting. Will be making again.

I had never made turkey burgers before, but wanted an alternative to the beef burgers I was also serving. The whole family loved these, even my son who doesn't like olives thought they were good. The tomato jam along with the extra feta on top really complemented the burger. I'm sure we will make again.

We love this recipe and make it a couple of times a month. It's super easy, and pretty healthful, too. I leave out seasoning with salt, the feta and the olives already brought that to the party.

I love this one. Perfect combination of flavors. The slightly sweet tomato jam is wonderful with the feta and olive. My daughter does not like olives so I left them out of the burger and just topped individual burgers with the olives. My family wants this burger again, soon!!!

We loved these burgers and I have picky eaters that don't usually appreciate things that are out of the ordinary- used leftover spaghetti sauce to save time instead of the tomato jam- everyone loved it!

Yum- Yum!! Carmelized onions first. Didn't make tomato jam this time, maybe next time.

These burgers pack a lot of flavor and are easy to make. I broiled mine instead of putting on the grill, and they came out juicy and tasty when cooked all the way through. I also made the tomato jam, which was ok but not stellar to me. I'll definitely use this burger recipe again.

Rating: 4
These are absolutely fabulous as written but this last time I made a few changes. I sauteed the onions and garlic in the olive oil from the recipe and added some dried rosemary ( I didn't have fresh) for the last few seconds of the saute just to help release the fragrance a bit. The sweetness of the caramelized onions added a wonderful extra layer of flavor. I also used olive tapanade instead of the chopped olives. Delicious!

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly except I had to pan fry the burgers (no grill). With the tomato jam, these were the perfect combination of salty, savory and sweet. I can't wait to make them for friends. I'm looking forward to trying the tomato jam with other foods as well.This is a new go-to dish for me.

We love onions but felt it totally overpowered the other flavors. I would cut way back or possibly use a milder onion, like a sweet vidalia or maui. It is a good base recipe as others have noted.

It absolutely does not get any better. Always loved and people want the recipe...tomato jam though difficult to find a perfect and important accompaniment.

Wonderful! Not much else to say on this one. Hubby can be picky sometimes, he doesn't like olives and turns up his nose at tomatoes and often at different ethnic food in general. However, even he was a believer with these. All the flavors just -work- together. I found that the Tomato Jam recipe was much larger than we needed. Something some might want to keep in mind. But personally I think it's good refrigerated and used later like catchup haha.

I made these with fresh ground Lamb from Whole Foods and they were delicious. I will try it with Turkey but for those who like Lamb give it a try. I also made the tomato jam and I don't believe they would have been as good without it. Cheers

These are really great. I didn't have any issues with the patties staying together as they cooked. All the flavors work wonderfully. And the tomato jam is great, even on its own. Definitely will make these burgers again. :)

These are delicious. I'm always trying to find great tasting recipes with turkey and these are top knotch. To make them even healthier, I served them open face on a whole wheat bun and added a thick slice of heirloom tomato.

Excellent turkey burger. I didn't bother with the tomato jam, or a bun. It is delicious enough to stand alone, even without condiments. Definitely will make these again.

Very good recipe. It is healthy, tasty, and unique. I was not expecting a knock-off- your-socks recipe. This is, afterall, in the quick recipe category. It is an excellent recipe to replace beef. The tomato jam did take a bit longer to reduce than it says in the original recipe, but that's no problem.

Very good, I thought. I broiled rather than grilled. Husband said it was a bit too "herb-y" for him, but I liked it. The tomato jam was pretty meh, but didn't require much effort (like others, I also found it took longer to reduce).

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I was certainly expecting more flavor, but actually found it quite bland. The tomato jam was okay, but couldn't pull the burgers out of the basement. I wanted to love it, but....: (

Rating: 3
Boy, I sure am glad that I made the jam a couple of days before making the burgers, as it took forever to reduce. When I made the burgers, I halved the recipe. As turkey burgers go, these were GREAT. I never have any luck with turkey burgers holding together during grilling, so this time I partially froze them before putting them on the grill. Next time I would add more feta over the top of the burgers than what the picture showed. Also, I think I would just use ketchup instead of making the tomato jam.

Rating: 4
These were absolutely fantastic. I used black olives instead of kalamatas, and left out the rosemary and feta cheese since I didn't have any. I threw in a pinch of dried basil and italian seasoning and topped the burgers off with baby swiss instead. They received rave reviews, and my boyfriend didn't even know they were turkey! An added plus: the tasty tomato jam doubles as a great salsa dip for munchies, although the jam does take about a half hour to reduce, not 10 minutes.

I thought these were delicious-moist, flavorful, and interesting. My husband was not impressed, but he generally dislikes turkey burgers, and was unhappy upon learning that was what he was instructed to grill. It's O.K.; more leftovers for me the next two days!

These were awesome! I made them exactly as written with the tomato jam and topped them with feta and olives as pictured. My only complaint was that the jam took much longer to reduce and I felt I had made the patties too thick. We ate them on thin pita-like buns and they were just the perfect balance of everything!

These were excellent! Made them without the olives and they were still great. Get started on the tomato jam first! It took longer than 10 minutes to reduce (closer to 30 for me). Don't skip it, though, it definitely adds to the burger!

Delish! First time we made these, we did so without tomato jam. Made the jam the next time (simmer for 20 min) and I must say this was a nice addition to the burgers. Used oregano instead of rosemary and was happy with end result. Highly enjoyed by my family

My family was skeptical when I said we were having turkey burgers but this recipe won them over. It has great flavor and the tomato jam is so good; I think it could be used for all sorts of things. As one of the other reviewers mentioned, you do have to cook down the jam longer than the 10 min. they suggest.

Moist and delicious! I made the burgers tonight, but didn't have time to make the tomato jam. I will make more burgers tomorrow, and freeze for future meals. Hopefully I will have the time to make the jam too. May sub oregano for the rosemary next time.

Oh yum! This was divine. The burgers were so moist & flavorful. The jam was delicious as well. Took about 20- 30 minutes to reduce, not 10. Used Del Monte basil, garlic, & oregeno diced tomatoes & served the burgers on english muffins.

Awesome! Loads of flavor, our new favorite burger recipe. Super easy! I was able to prep everything while my 11 month old ate lunch. Make the tomato jam early in the day to really develop the flavors. I also used a mini processor to finely chop all the burger additions before adding to the turkey. Served with the coriander potatoes and grilled zucchini. Made a pasta dish with leftover crumbled burgers and tomato jam. My mouth is watering just thinking about it . . .

Really loved this recipe! Accidentally picked up goat cheese. The result was actually fantastic, had that great mild goat cheese taste. We served w/no bread and a spinach salad on the side. Our new favorite turkey burger recipe. Used the leftover tomato jam on salmon blt sandiches the next day.
