I wanted just the cookies, not the sandwiches, so I skipped the filling. These were okay, but seemed to have very little flavor. Other than the taste of corn syrup (which I am not crazy about.) I didn't want to finish making the double batch I made without trying to change it somehow. So I added about a scant 1/4 cup of real maple syrup, about a teaspoon of maple sugar and about a quarter teaspoon of salt. They were much improved. Especially with the salt. (I didn't really measure, just kept adding a little of each until the flavor of the unbaked batter was satisfactory.) The texture of the finished product was the same...still nice and crisp and lacy. I may omit the corn syrup completely next time and try all maple syrup and/or try brown sugar instead of white.

Really good crisp and light and very easy. They spread a lot make them very small. I used nutella as filling and was perfect. Stayed crisp for days. Told it was best cookie I ever made!

My family loves these cookies. I skip the filling, but otherwise make according to the directions. They are so easy and so good.

Make all of the dough balls while the batter is still warm. If it cools completely it seizes up. 2> With the filling, these very rich cookies are more like candy. 3> The recipe will make 9 or 10 complete sandwiches, not 18.

the cookies are great, the frosting is unnecessary. the whole point of "lace" cookies is their delicate texture (thin, airy, crunchy), which is more or less negated by this thick frosting- might as well serve it on a 'nilla wafer, you know? plus it makes for a VERY sweet mouthful, the kind that sort of makes your teeth hurt. i served these at a rehearsal dinner- i ran out of time and didn't build the sandwich cookies, but just had the frosting in a bowl next to the cookies. the cookies were gobbled in an instant (with great reviews!), but no one touched the frosting...

Ok, I made these without the filling last year and made a bunch of mistakes so that they didn't turn out well. I just tried it again and they turned out great. (I definitely ground the pecans too long last year and wound up with a pecan flour. The "batter" was too dry and it was a mess.) I spread nutella between the cookies this year and also covered some in chocolate. I'm glad I tried it again.

The flavor of these cookies is unbelievable. My only word of caution....they spread like you wouldn't believe! You don't need a whole lot in your spoonful.

These cookies are perfection: sophisticated without being difficult to make. Definitely assemble at the last minute. They also freeze well (frosting separate). When baking they definitely spread wide so stick to small dollops of dough.

These were easy to make and tasted amazing. My family freaked over these!

if they get too cool to roll onto the wooden spoon put them back into the oven for about a minute or so. i like this much better than with frosting.

this recipe sounds difficult but it really is not. i use only about 1/2t. dropped onto the baking sheet. it gives me about 3" diameter cookies which i roll around a wooden spoon handle just as soon as they cool enough to touch. put them down, they will hold the round shape. a very long time ago when i first made them i practiced on a couple on the first sheet. then i let them cool good and then dip one end into melted chocolate chips. they really are pretty arranged with other cookies in tins to give away for any occasion.

AMAZING! I don't assemble them until it's time to serve, and they're to die for, just as they are. Great cookies to make to impress a crowd :)

I have been baking these cookies for the past 3 years without the filling. Everyone loves them, they are the easiest cookie recipe I have. Make sure that you use only a teaspoon and more than 1 inch apart. They have always been perfect rounds for me. I hope you enjoy them as much as we do.

These were good. Not great. I felt like something was missing. Next time I'm using salted butter. I didn't use the orange buttercream opting for a french vanilla buttercream that I had on hand. I love rich food so I didn't find them to be "cloying", as one reviewer put it. My cookies ran together with the first tray but I wised up on the following two trays, halving the amount of batter per cookie that I'd used the first time. I just wish they cooked up perfectly round. Like I said, good but not great.

I've got to wonder what is wrong with me -- I'm one of the few that doesn't really like this cookie. It was just a little too cloying for me - and I'm not even a picky eater. I followed the recipe exactly. Oh well, I guess we all have different taste!

I have never had anyone beg me for a recipe in my life... until now!! I omitted the orange cream and just made the cookie. Wow were these fabulous! But remember to only use a little bit of batter (1 tsp) and they won't run together, especially if you refidgerate the batter before baking. They were a total hit!

These are amazing! Delicious, elegant, and so easy! I chopped the pecans in the food processor, and only used half of the buttercream to fill them--I found that a thick layer was too overwelming, so just spread a very thin layer over the cookies. Served them at a dinner party and they were a huge it! I think another filling would be great, too (like chocolate...mmmm....)

I didn't make these with the orange filling, but the cookies themselves are fantastic! Lighty, crispy, nutty, and not overly sweet. I chopped the pecans in the food processor and found the consistency to be perfect. Enjoy!

Delicious! I omitted the orange cream and they were very simple and delicious. I let the batter sit for a while (20 minutes) before baking the cookies and did not have a problem with them running together. However, I only baked the cookies for 8 minutes and they came out perfectly crunchy. A definite keeper!

I made these cookies for my holiday party several years ago and they were such a hit that I now have requests to make them as Christmas gifts for certain friends.

Phenomenal cookies! I took them to a holiday cookie exchange, and people were crazy about them!!!

I loved the cookie, but it lost some of its crispness when the icing was added. I may make just the cookies next time, although the frosting was really yummy! One other note: I used less than half a teaspoon of batter per cookie, and I ended up with about 60. And I did not have the problem of the cookies running together as some othe reviewers reported.

This recipe sounded wonderful. The cookie was good. The filling was good. But put them together and the cookie was just way too sweet.

I have been making these for 3 years now..I substituted lemon for orange. People always ask when I am going to make another batch, but I reserve this for the Holidays - they very rich!

I didn't like the filling, so I added 4 oz of cream cheese to it and filled the cookies. Very, very good.

these are easier to make than they look. just be sure to use parchment paper and not wax paper. i now know that there is a difference. i made them for a christmas gift and 7 months have gone by with my friend still asking for them again.

Over the last six weeks I've made 12 different cookie recipes and these would definitely be in the top 3. They are excellent, easy to prepare, and a nice change of pace. Only note: following this recipe exactly, I ended up with only 6 cookies! So I tripled the batter and kept the filling as described and had just the right amount to make 18. Also, I much prefer them the day they are made vs. a couple days later.

I took these to a brunch today and I was so pleased with the results. They were a beautiful sight on the plate. What a beautiful cookie. The taste was sweet and crunchy with the hint of orange. WOW

Everyone loved these cookies. Had no problems as long as you keep a good space between the cookies and don't use too much batter.

They did tend to melt into eachother while baking, I was forced to cut them apart. Very good flavor, but after a few days the cookies become soggy, so be sure to eat them right away.

super easy & very forgiving recipe- I dumped the pecans in too early (hey, these things happen if you're trying to cook with a 2 year old...) & they still tasted great. my father in-law was elbowing my mother in law @ the Chirstmas table telling her to get the recipe- what more endorsement do you need?

I made these but with marginal success. The first cookie sheet turned into 1 big cookie. The second was fine. Next time I will let the batter sit on the first cookie sheet 10 minutes before putting in the oven. I think the batter was still warm when I put it in the oven so they just ran. To salvage some I used a 1 1/2" round cookie cutter and cut out several into nice perfectly round circles. The second batch would have been perfect but they were too big. I got 9 cookies! Next time I will also drop onto cookie sheets in 1/2 teapoons. The flavor is fabulous so worth another try.

These are wonderful!! I have already made them several times...always for someone else. I do somehow make an odd number so as to have one for myself. Incredibly easy to make and a great combination of flavors. A definite keeper!!

I thought these were relavitely easy to make, and made a beautiful presentation (not to mention yummy!) I made the cookies a bit too wide, so I ended up with only about 12. Next time I'll be careful to use smaller spoonfuls.
