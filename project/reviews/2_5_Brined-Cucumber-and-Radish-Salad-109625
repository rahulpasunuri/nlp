I have made this many, many times. Love it! It is so refreshing to munch on or as a side dish for lunch. I always let it "pickle" a little longer according to my tastes. It's not extremely strong, but just a clean, refreshing dish.

I was trying this as a pickle dish rather than a salad, but with that said, I still wouldn't make it again. Very bland and boring. If you're looking for pickled veggies, try the pickled carrot recipie - MUCH better... http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/108763

I just couldn't get passed this salad not having any vinegar in it. I tried the recipe as written and added a splash of apple cider vinegar afterwords as it was too bland. Once I did that, though, it was both pretty and yummy.

Must disagree with the previous reviewer. This was so refreshing, and an excellent accomopaniment to the quick choucroute garnie at this site. Not complicated or highly seasoned, but it brought out the best in the fresh ingredients.

I hate to post a negative review of this pretty salad, but I made it tonight and it's rather bland. Not sure what it could use but I'm not investing the time to try it again.
