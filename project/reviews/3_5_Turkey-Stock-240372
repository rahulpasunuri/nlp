To the person reviewing on 12/8/09: the recipe calls for 4 QUARTS of water, not 4 CUPS. You used about 2 quarts (8 cups), so you must have gotten very strong stock.

A miracle recipe (Cana? Lourdes?)! Turn 4 C water, a turkey carcass, and some veggies into 10 C stock? I don't think so. I used 8 C water, and netted a little more than 4 C of strained stock. I will let it cool, refrigerate, and remove fat tomorrow. It is tasty, but I am loath to thin it too much. I will try 2 C water and a box of low-sodium chicken broth to get to 10 C for the turkey chowder recipe.

i've never made stock before from a leftover turkey carcass but i will surely make this again. i used some in a turkey chowder and the wonderfulness came from the yummy flavorful stock. i didn't change anything in the recipe. mmmm..good

One of the few things you can do before Thanksgiving Day! Recipe turned out perfectly and was the base for the best gravy I've ever presented.

This was an easy stock recipe for the cook who is tired after making Thanksgiving dinner. The turkey chowder recipe that accompanied it was really good, too
