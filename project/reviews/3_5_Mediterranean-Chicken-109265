Pretty good. Not great. I think the shallots and garlic should saute before the mushrooms go in. A deglaze with white wine before the stock is added makes a good difference too. Pretty for sure!

This was really delicious and even got a rare rave review from my 19-year-old daughter. Next time I will try it without adding butter; I don't think it's needed. I also did not salt as frequently as directed; the kalamata olives add so much salt that I think not much more is needed. I served it with a very simple salad of romaine, red bell peppers, and olives, dressed with red wine vinegar and olive oil. A delightful light (and easy) supper.

This dish is amazing! My husband and I are on the Paleo diet, so to eat something this good without cheating make me happy :) I would suggest letting the broth reduce for longer than the recipe suggests. I think that's why some people didn't like this as much.

I loved this! I didn't have everything so I made do. Used dried shitake mushrooms. Didn't have shallots, parsley, pine nuts or Caper berries. Had fresh local tomatoes, capers, olives and subbed Mushroom broth. We served extra sauce over noodles. My whole family loved it and I can't wait to make it for my book club.

I expected this dish to be much better considering the yummy ingredient list. I made it exactly per the recipe and my guests thought it was good but not great. I probably wouldn't make it again - only because there are plenty of great chicken recipes on epicurious.

Very good. Suggestion to substitute half of broth with wine was key (I used rose since that's what I had on hand.) I also added 1/2 tsp. herbes de provence to add depth. Needs to be served with starch to it soak up the sauce.

This was delicious and fairly easy to prepare. I used baby bella mushrooms and they were delicious. I served this on top of couscous, yum, yum.

I made the recipe taking some of the advice here: half broth and half white wine, chopped olives, and halved cherry tomatoes. The result was delicious, and got rave reviews. I also shredded the chicken, which is just a personal preference. Definitely on the list of regular recipes now.

My family loved this recipe. I did take the advice in the other reviews and chopped up the olives and the tear drop tomatoes. I also added crumbles of blue cheese on the top and it really enhanced the flavor. A real winner.

This is great but needs a bit of adjustments. Liquid should be half dry white wine and half broth. Cut the olives in quarters and the tomatoes in half so their flavors are fully released. A bit of red chili pepper in the oil when frying the chicken adds a bit of needed heat. Serving suggestion is over roasted root veggies and a few steamed asparagus.

I made this dish tonight and my husband and I loved it with the herbed potatoes. I just used regular white mushrooms and it still came out perfectly. I cooked the chicken in the sauce for the last five minutes to give it additional flavor.

Rating: 1
Not up to expectation considering I really like all of the ingredients and the mostly glowing reviews (especially considering the cost of good wild mushrooms. The flavors just didn't seem to pull together somehow. I may try to play with it one more time but the mushrooms do make it a pretty costly experiment.

Makes an appealing and delicious entree. It is very flavorful, but you and your guests must LOVE the flavor of Kalamata olives and mushrooms to enjoy this dish. I used shiitake and portabella mushrooms and added artichokes. We thought it was delicious and will serve it again.

A very tasty weeknight dinner. I made a few slight modifications. Used boneless, skinless thighs vs. breasts, added the shallots and garlic to the mushrooms while sauteeing. Finally, added a pinch of red pepper flakes near the end for a tiny bit of heat. Served over fresh linguine.

Very yummy! I always cheat on recipes....Used 3 chicken breasts instead of 6 and all Roma tomatoes. I added jarred, marinated artichokes and fresh spinach that wilted nicely at the last minute. Next time I will cut the 2 tbs of butter...I didn't think it was necessary at all. Was a big hit and I will make again!

I agree this has too much going on & makes no sense as is, however, I've some tips I think would make it worthwhile! Use only 1/4 C olives & chop coarsley; eliminate the parsley which adds only visual appeal; eliminate teardrop tomatoes.

Super flavorful and easy -- just don't skimp on the ingredients...buy the good stuff and it'll pay off with empty plates and happy guests.

And try to stay away from just plain white mushrooms, they seem to "water" down the other varieties.

I'm a new cook. No more mom, no more dining halls, and now, no more girlfriends. So, this dish - what's the deal? I agree with a prev. reviewer. It's too busy. I can't tell what the point is. The mushrooms, tomatoes, and olives can't decide who is the boss. It's a good thing the broth with butter thickens up, it mediates things a little bit. Next time (3rd time) I might try slicing the mushrooms even thinner and smaller, and maybe chopping the olives? (Although...they are far too salty to put throughout the entire sauce.)

Felt like a professional chef when I served this. It presents beautifully and tastes better than it looks.

There are plenty of variations which will not adversely affect this dish--in fact, that's one of its attributes--nothing has to be exact; whatever mushrooms, diced red and yellow tomatoes instead of teardrop or grape, a touch of balsamic vinegar, the sundried tomatoes (I used a little sundried tomato paste I found in a tube at the grocery!), don't watch the clock and just let it reduce and then hold it however long. . . it's very easy and should not intimidate any cook. We served it over grilled salmon--I have been searching for something new to top the wild salmon we eat several times a week in season; this was terrific and a very pretty presentation, sprinkled with the parsley and pine nuts. Served with green beans and ripe sliced tomatoes, yellow and red, with balsamic vinegar and sea salt. A lovely French rose wine was perfect. Yum; this is definitely a keeper. Look forward to trying it on chicken too.

Despite the delicious list of ingredients, this dish was too bland.

Rating: 3
To enhance the flavor profile and moistness of the chicken, plus avoid splatter from frying the chicken AND cut down the fat content, try soaking the chicken pieces in lowfat milk plus 1/4 cup egg substitute for a while, then dredging them in seasoned bread crumbs and bake them in a 350 oven on a cookie sheet - spray with Pam or olive oil spray. OR just skip all that and grill the chicken on the BBQ (this gets my husband involved in the dinner prep). The sauce is still as wonderful and the chicken actually stands out better.

Very tasty, but I found it a little busy - garlic AND shallots AND capers AND mushrooms AND two kinds of tomatoes. I might pare back next time I make it. I used far more garlic than the recipe called for, per earlier reviews. Make sure to have good bread on hand to sop up the juices.

Great flavor and easy to prepare and assemble. There are so many things you could do to enhance the recipe and give it different flavors (change the herbs, add :Please let me know if you have any questions."heat", use it over fish...good basic recipe.

For the small amount of time involved in preparing this, it sure had a lot of flavor. I used skinless chicken breasts with bone in and after finishing the sauce just placed the breasts back in the pot and covered, cooked over low heat for about 20 min.

The sauce is excellent, but the chicken was somewhat dry. I made it again with the following changes: I pounded the chicken breast into strips, marinated the strips in garlic and olive oil before tossing them with bread crumbs. I sauteed them lightly in butter and olive oil before adding them to the mushroom-veggie sauce. WOW!!! what an improvement, it made the chicken itself so much more flavorful and interesting. will make again!!!!

I made this exactly as written and it was good, but I can't put it in the "great" category. At the same time, I intend to keep it around to experiment with just a bit -- seems to have potential.

This dish was very tasty without the suggested garnishes (caper berries). My family has asked me to add it to the "keeper" file. Like many others, I used cherry tomatoes instead of tear drop tomatoes. Also, while I added the butter at the end, I don't think it was necessary and will omit it next time. Finally, the chicken breasts I used were very thick and I found that the cooking time in the recipe was insufficient. If using thick breasts, I would brown 1-2 more on each side before placing them in the oven. Also, I would cover the chicken in the oven to help keep it moist.

Quite a bit of effort (pitting olives, seeding/ chopping tomatoes, slicing mushrooms, etc) but well worth it!! I added some fresh spinach for color and flavor and it got rave reviews. Will definitely make it again.

To Cook from Florida: I don't mean to sound condescending, but there's no right or wrong in cooking. You can use sun-dried tomatoes if you think it sounds appealing. Recipes are guidelines or mere jumping-off points, in my opinion.

I made this recipe along with the Spinach and Roasted Red Pepper Gratin, and the Roasted Potatoes with Herbs for an excellent dinner.I followed the recipe but used a diced yellow tomato instead of the teardrops because I didn't want to buy 2 whole pints for a 2 person dinner. The added color would be nice for company.

Definitely a winner, especially over pasta. To the frustrated caterer: We all have our off-days in the kitchen, esp. with a first-time recipe. "The recipe sounded wonderful. Made it and it wasn't" doesn't tell us anything about what you think was wrong. Did you maybe not have good ingredients? Maybe you cooked it too long and it was dry? Did you think it was under- or over-seasoned? These details would let those of us who love this dish help you figure out what might have gone wrong.

This was sooooo delicious! Definitely my new favorite way to prepare chicken. I also substituted halved cherry tomatoes (no teardrops available), and due to personal preference, used extra garlic and cilantro instead of basil (which I guess makes it a little less "Mediterranean"). I followed the recipe in all other respects and it came out just perfect. I used oyster mushrooms this time because they were all I had on hand, but I look forward to experimenting with other types the next time I make this.

To the cook from NYC, 200 degrees is not a typo. You are just keeping the chicken warm in the oven until you are ready to serve it. Hope this helps.

Fan-TASTIC! I made this last night for my mother's birthday and she and my beau both loved it - as did ! The mushroom blend was savory! The chicken breasts I used were large and plump, and needed some extra cooking time, but I still took them out a little early so they would not get overdone when warming in the oven. I followed the ingredients list to a T with the minor exception of substituting halved cherry tomatoes for the teardrop tomatoes; no teardrops were available, and the grape tomatoes at the store were sickly. The cherries worked quite well! Served with a wild rice blend. Very pretty presentation! Can't wait to make it for friends.

I made several adjustments to this recipe and it was still very tasty. I omitted the capers, sauteed the chicken breasts and used sliced, toasted almonds instead of pinenuts. Very easy to make!!

This was a delicious weeknight meal! I used significantly less oil, probably a total of 1 Tbs instead of 3. I found that I had to use more broth than called for as a result, but that was fine. I also used grape tomatoes in place of teardrops, and I didn't add the butter at the end (forgot it, actually, and didn't miss it). The brininess of the olives and capers combined with the wild mushroom mixture and shallots was delicious, and it looked pretty on the plate! Served on a bed of whole-wheat couscous, which soaked up the sauce nicely.

To Tulsa, OK ...just as an FYI, cremini mushrooms and baby portabellas are the same product, just sometimes labeled differently by the grower. There is no difference. Creminis are baby bellas.

My family really enjoyed this dish. The only change I made was to use boneless thighs instead of breast meat.(I think thighs have more flavor) So I had to cook the meat a little longer than suggested. When I added the broth, tomato, olive, caper mixture I returned the chicken with accumulated juices to the pan covered and let simmer for about five minutes. Then I removed the thighs to a platter(covered with foil) and let the juices reduce. Topped chicken with the mushroom mix and garnished as suggested. Served with galic mashed potatoes. YUM!

This was quite good but could not find tear drop tomato's so just used grape instead. Very tasty.

A good, tasty dish that's easy to prepare. I used baby bella mushrooms, which I often use when a recipe calls for wild mushrooms (but doesn't specify which kind) and got good results. Cremini mushrooms would probably work very well, also. The recipe says to "salt to taste" twice. I found the first time was sufficient -- I would strongly advise that you taste before adding salt the first time, as it's very likely you won't need to add any salt at all. The kalamata olives and capers add plenty of saltiness on their own! One downside: I spent a lot of time cleaning up grease splatters. Do not put the burner on high as the recipe suggests -- a medium high setting will be more than sufficient. If you have one of those grease splatter guards make sure you dig it out.
