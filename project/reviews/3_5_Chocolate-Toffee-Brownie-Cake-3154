I read the comments of this recipe and made sure to cut out a circle of parchment paper. Thank God I did or otherwise I would have had to scrape it out with a spoon. I first laid down the circle in the cake pan and then sprayed the pan down with copious amounts of baking spray. Then I turned the circle over and pressed it flat with the pan (the spray made it adhere). I didn't powder the pan with cocoa but just sprinkled it on the bottom of the pan. It took about 30 minutes bake and I let it cool for about 10. I had to scrape around the edge to loosen the cake from the pan and then flipped it over on a cooling rack. I then pounded the top of the pan and it released. I had to carefully peal the parchment paper off the bottom while using a knife to peal melted toffee bits off but it worked out dandy. The cake was very tasty and I would make this recipe again.

My step mom made this back in '97 when it came out in the magazine and when I tried it, I was instantly in love. I remembered this cake and how amazing it tasted and last May, I called her for the recipe so I could make it myself. Perfecto!! I made several for a large b-day party and EVERYONE loved it! You must serve it with vanila ice cream! And the next day, it's better if you stick a piece in the microwave for 10 seconds. AMAZING!

I was hesitant to make this after reading of people's difficulties with pan bottom sticking. I needed to make this recipe for 8 adults and 4 kids, so here's how I succeeded: I mixed up 1.5x the recipe and split the batter between 2 disposable 8.5 x 1.5 inch aluminum pans (2 layer brownie cake!). After cooling, I was able to make 4 cut marks down the sides of each pan, invert onto a plate, and peel away the very bottom of the pan, no problem. (In favor of the kids, I left the nuts out and split the difference between the toffee and chocolate chips.) Much classier than brownie squares, and ice cream accompaniment is a MUST, mixed berries on the side recommended- Too rich to serve solo!

A big hit, very easy and it looked very professional. Would definitely make again!

I followed this recipe exactly. For the toffee bits I used toffee candies that I broke into pieces. The candy bits and the chocolate chips fell to the bottom of the pan while cooking and as it cooled it hardened. When I went to take it out of pan the brownie cake came out and the toffee stuck to the bottom of the cake tin. What a disappointment. It smelled so good. Bummer.

You're not overwhelmed with chocolate in this brownie recipe. It's a nice balance of chocolate and toffee. The presentation is beautiful when you want to impress without trying hard.

Very quick and easy cake to make. We love it. We've made it numerous times and it is always a hit. We don't like nuts so we omit them. It's very rich, don't over cook it. Perfect for informal and formal affairs.

There was nothing wrong with this recipe but there are much better uses of calories and time on this website.

This cake did not turn out well for me. The chocolate chips and toffee pieces fell to the bottom of the cake. When I tried to turn it out onto a plate, the top stuck to the pan. I tried this recipe twice and the same thing happened both times.

My husband is not a nut fan, but even he loved this. It was dense and rich and very chocolatey. And the toffee made it out of this world! This would be great to serve for guests, but I have to admit that we just kept sneaking pieces of it until it was gone! So I will definitely be making it again.

Elegant presentation--looks like it's from a bakery. Very yummy, moist cake that's sinfully rich. I would offer it at after an informal or formal dinner party. It was a big hit for me!

This was a big hit at a small dinner party. It really is best the first day it is made. I served it with garnished with whipped cream.
