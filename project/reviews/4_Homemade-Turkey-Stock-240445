This made really great gravy - best I have had in a long time.

This is a good recipe for turkey stock. Make ahead and freeze and then you don't have to worry about the gravy on Thanksgiving day. I use a bit of port wine to deglaze the pan and add double herbs. I also add cloves. Roasting the wings to a deep color adds great flavor.

I look forward to trying this recipe but cannot find turkey wings anywhere. I guess I'll just use turkey parts..

I've made this recipe twice a year for the past two years, and I will make it again this year. It's incredibly easy as-is, however, after you roast the wings you can put everything in a slow cooker instead of a stockpot on the stove. I cook it for 8-10 hours overnight, and by morning I have awesome broth.

Easy recipe. I started with leftover turkey pieces (not wings) and did not saute them. Next time I will probably follow the recipe as I imagine it would add a greater depth of flavor.

I've made this stock every year for the last four or five years and it's wonderful. I use it for gravy and for moistening stuffing that doesn't fit into my turkey. Make ahead of time and freeze.
