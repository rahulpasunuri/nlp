Quick and easy enough for a weeknight. Good as is. This is also a nice base recipe - use any herb and/or leave out the peperoncinis, throw in some white wine. Though delicious, I don't consider this dish worthy of entertaining.

This was delicious, easy and fast. Next time I'll grill the salmon with the skins on instead of frying. I like my food really spicy so I used 3 pepperoncinis without seeding them first--next time I'll use 4. As suggested by another reviewer, I added the pepperoncinis last, off the heat, and the sauce didn't curdle. I added a teaspoon or so of flour to the cream to make the sauce a little thicker. It turned out great!

This dish was a huge sucess. We cooked it for a small family dinner and received rave reviews. It was easy, quick and impressive. I will definately make it again.

I was really disappointed in this dish. Everything else I have made from epicurious that had such rave reviews I loved, but this just made my stomach hurt. I made it for my boyfriend and he also didn't like it, which says a lot since he isn't at all a picky eater. If you are trying to impress someone, don't make this dish.

Delicious and flavorful. I love pasta so decided to try this over capallini with a side of fresh vegetables... wonderful!

The flavor combinations of this recipe sound like they would never work, but my oh my how they do! The pepperoncinis tend to overshadow the subtle flavors of salmon, however, so I prefer to make this dish with the blander, farm-raised salmon.

This is amazing!! I followed the previous review's suggestion and used creme fraiche. I wished I had bought more salmon because everyone wanted seconds. I can't wait to make it for company!!

First class restaurant recipe. Bravo! Regarding peperoncinis, 4 medium sized pieces is perfect; It's a great recipe, so skip the half-and-half and use real creme fraiche, as real restaurants do. Serve with white basmati rice and steamed asparagus, as suggested. For wine, choose a Sancerre or a Bourgogne Alligote.

This was great!!! I would make it again in a second! My boyfriend couldnt get enouph of it. Some tips I just added more Dill, and used crushed red pepers instead of the pepochini cause I ran out of them. It was delicious!!!

go figure? this is awesome! use milk instead of ½ and ½. add lots of garlic. add a little flour to thicken the sauce.

Like other reviewers, the cream sauce curdled after a minute. Next time, make the cream sauce without the peperoncinis, then add them after taking the sauce off the heat. That should work.

I love peperoncinis, so knew I would like this dish! It's got a nice kick to it, and takes salmon to a whole other level.

The dish was delicious only it curdled in my stomach and also my husband. Thought we were just imagining things the first time but the second we voted never to make again. Maybe it's because the pepperoncini's made the cream curdle.

Very nice. The sauce needed significantly more dill than the recipe calls for. One of our guests couldn't eat onions or shallots so we used minced garlic instead - worked perfectly!

I not a salmon lover but this dish was great. Even though, I left out...the dill. I'm sure it will be even better next time.

Made it without peppercinis and it was great; reduced fat by using fat free half-n-half. Will definitely make again, great recipe to have when having guests - quick & easy!

Made this last night for dinner, very good. The cream sauce is really delicious. I served with roasted asparagus, wild rice & fresh french baguette! A nice meal! There are just two of us so I halfed the recipe.

I traditionally shy away from cream sauces, unless Ducasse has made them for me. However, this dish was sublime--the enchanting quality of the dill tamed the heat in the pepper. I made this recipe again for a salmon club sandwich--really awesome. FYI: I used 4 shallots and cut down on the cream.

I never thought salmon could taste so good. I made it several times sometimes i leave out the peperoncinis and it is just as tasty.

This was absolutely delicious! I baked the salmon with a little bit of olive oil and salt and pepper instead of frying it. The sauce was pretty simple and the flavors complimented each other extreemly well. I'll definately be making this again.

EXCELLENT! The ARTICHOKE BRUSCHETTA recipe is great with this!

Excellent! I used ten peperoncinis and omitted the parsley. It is a very substantial dish, however, my husband and I savored every last bite. It was a welcome break from my usual dill sauce and I will be preparing it again soon!

This was very good. I even used no fat half & half. I haven't liked the cream sauces I've tried up to now. I'll definately make it again.
