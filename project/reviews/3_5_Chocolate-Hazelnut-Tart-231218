Always a crowd pleaser - have been making it for years because I'm always asked to bring it to dinner parties. Had a problem with it for the first time today where the filling was too oily - to the point where when chilled there was visible fat on top....the only thing I did differently was use a different brand of hazelnut spread - Loaker - because whole foods doesnt carry Nutella. Not sure if that is the difference, but am remaking it and will attempt to mop up some of the oil before chilling...

My Mother- in law asked for the recipe!!!! So easy and delicious. I only caution is that it is very rich, small pieces required.

I used chocolate graham crackers instead of regular graham crackers. The resulting tart was incredibly rich and fudgy. I would definitely make this again.

Caution: this is as rich as a chocolate bar, so it will last you at least a week. But people will love it--once you get down to the last bites, chop it into chunks and eat it like toffee. Next time I make it, I think I'll do it with a lemon or raspberry sorbet, to counter the richness of the dish...

This is a total home run. So fast and easy to make and it always wows guests. I have requests from friends to make this for parties. This is my go to dessert.

I tried this recipe tonight. I used my favorite gingersnap crust (2 c. gingersnaps crushed, 5 tbls. butter). I added toasted unsweetened coconut to the batter. I served with Trader Joe's uncrystallized candied ginger and my guest loved it! I also used the 70% cacao Belgian chocolate from Trader Joe's. It was rich but delicious.

This is super rich and so good! I used a store-bought graham cracker crust, as several others suggested. I replaced the hazelnuts with 1 cup of peanut butter chips, which I added right after the heavy cream/chocolate/nutella mixture was mixed thoroughly. Sprinkle some peanut butter chips on top, too!

This is a KEEPER!!! I am all about quick but impressive, and I make this using a storebought graham cracker pie crust and mini chocolate chips--thus, no chopping chocolate, no making crust, and the hardest part of the recipe is chopping and toasting the hazelnuts! My way this recipe takes less than 10 mins to make and it is SOOOO delicious!! People go crazy for it. Three more tips: Sometimes I use half bittersweet and half semisweet--makes it a little more crowd-pleasing for those without so sophisticated palates. Also, take the tart out of the fridge about 20-30 mins before you plan to serve it so it softens up a bit for cutting and I think it tastes better when it's not so cold. Finally, serve it in skinny pie slices--it's very rich and you won't need a lot of it. This recipe is simply perfect because it's so quick, so sophisticated and can be made well ahead of time. Plus for a gourmet dinner, it goes DIVINELY with a great port. If you're busy but love to host gourmet wine dinners like me, you'll be making this recipe again and again.

I really enjoyed this dessert. However, the next time I make it, I'd use 3/4 of the filling/topping because I felt that it was too top heavy on the chocolate.

I like this fine -- it didn't rank super-high in my list of favorite chocolate desserts. It did come out just as described and looked just about exactly as in the picture. Nice, easy, tasty, others liked it very well. But I had a question for other reviewers/readers -- did anyone else find the graham cracker crumbs overly salty? Do you tend to use the crumbs you buy in the box (as I did) or make your own crumbs? I like a little salt in my baked goods but I found in this case that the crust was too salty.

I made this for my husband and in-laws, who all ate it with glee, but it did not meet my expectations as a tart, as it felt like we were eating a chocolate bar. If I were to make this again, I would serve them as little squares for people to munch at a buffet, rather then as a big slice of tart. I also used digestives biscuits instead of graham crackers as I am in the UK, which tasted good.

So easy and VERY impressive. Made it for my friends and everyone raved saying in addition to the fantastic taste, it looks like it was made by a professional pastry chef (which I am not!!!!!)Thanks Epicurious for once again making me look good ;-)

I made this tonight, and it was quite good--VERY good for something so easy to prepare (threw it together while making a spaghetti dinner). I used El Rey bittersweet chocolate wafers and forgot to chop them up before I poured in the heated cream (little too much beaujolais in the kitchen? Could be, could be . . .) but the chocolate melted fine and the whole thing was a breeze. Boyfriend and I each had a wah-fair thin slice tonight and I'll take the rest to work tomorrow. They will worship me.
