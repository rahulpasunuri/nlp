Great! Very tasty. I didn't add olives and it was a right decision.

My husand & I thought this was just okay. Not sure what all the rave reviews are about. I highly recommend the Mixed Antipasto recipe from Gourmet instead (on this site) which is outstanding and my guests always love it as well.

I used all of the ingredients in this recipe but instead of piling them on a single platter I arranged them on indiviual salad plates for a sit down dinner for six. I placed a rolled piece of prosciutto on top of the sliced tomato, topped that with a round each of mozzarella and hard boiled egg, draped 2 narrow strips of roasted bell pepper (from a jar) over the top, sprinkled green and black olives around the edges, tucked in a whole basil leaf for garnish and sparingly drizzled the basil oil over the whole thing. It made a the most colorful and appetizing presentation on a simple white plate and every single guest asked for the recipe!

The dressing makes the salad. It's one of the best I've ever had. I make the dressing as is and I omit the egg and prosciuto to serve it as a side dish. Amazing!

Fantastically good. The basil oil is superb.

I made this as an appetizer for a dinner party, as suggested by previous comment, without prosciutto and egg because one of my friends is vegetarian. For vinegar, I added balsamic vinegar and herbs (thyme, basil, oregano), salt and pepper for additional flavor. I cut the tomato and mozzarella cheese into bite size wedges and scattered them on the serving platter topped with roasted pepper and mixed olives. It created a more casual look. Since asparagus is in season, I blanched some and placed it around the platter. The whole dish was colorful and tasty.

This antipasto was loved at our dinner party, and makes a nice presentation. We also added a little balsamic on top for added color and flavor.

I found the dressing a little bland so I added black pepper and Balsamic vinegar. I served it as a first course, even the kids went nuts for the dressing.

This antipasto was so delicious!! I made it for a family gathering and it was devoured within minutes. The dish was so easy to make, however the ingredients were a little pricy. It was worth it though because the result was excellent!

Our dinner group made this as a starter - it was exceptionally good - I am making it again on Sunday for some other people. Very good flavor - a meal in itself.

I first made this as an appetizer for a casual dinner with friends. Since part of our group did not eat meat I took out the prosciutto. This would normally leave a very boring antipasto salad, but not in this case. The dressing is so flavorful and eggs add such an unusual balance that this has become my favorite do ahead, easy party dishes.

I am adding this dish to a dinner group menu I am planning. I have made this before, and my friends just raved. It is fabulous--be sure to use the best prosciutto you can find. It makes a great presentation.

AWESOME!! Cut recipe in half to serve two, but could have used the full dressing amount. Didn't bother with the peppers and they weren't missed. Very filling actually. Served with Cracked pepper foccacia (on this site).

This was good - I left out the eggs as I just am not into them, but the drizzle with basil and garlic gave the antipasto plate a great kick.
