This was a big hit - I had no idea what sumac was so I just used oregano. Everyone loved the unique flavor even people who normally don't like peas!

Have made this several times since getting this month's magazine. Absolutely delicious. Prepping the snap peas takes some time, but well worth it. Sumac adds nice tough.

I have been making a cold salad very similar to this for years (with cherry tomatoes, quinoa, and oregano), but had never thought to add sumac. That extra tart note is delicious. I omit the vinegar in favor of more lemon juice, which suits my taste better.

When I first recieved this magazine in the mail I made this recipe! My family loved it! Very quick and easy! I've made it 4 times already. I used ricotta salata for the cheese. The first time I made I forgot to buy the sumac so I grated fresh lemon zest which worked well. This now will be a summer staple in my household sor dinner or summer gatherings!

Made this fresh side dish at 4th of July to go along with grilled chicken and roasted potatoes. It was very well received and completely consumed. It is simple, but bright. I cooked the snap peas 4+ minutes as at 2 they were still raw.I added extra mint and sprinkled with plenty of sumak when serving. I used feta which was a bit "wet" when stirred in so will try it again with the ricotta salata and toss it in at the last minute next time.

Meh. This took forever to make, and the end result was pretty boring. The taste was light and refreshing thanks to the lemon and mint...but I just feel like it was missing something.

Refreshing and so easy to make! I used green beans instead of sugar snap peas just because I felt like it. I would also up the spices! But was delicious!
