A new staple of my dessert selections. YUM!! Made a day early and the compote was even better a day later. I did change up one thing using a combination of dried currants and dried peaches. Also chopped the peaches as suggested below. Basically a stupid-simple recipe that your guests will gush over. Agree with the comment below that this doesn't make 8 full 3/4 cup servings. Next time will double the recipe and maybe(?) cut the vanilla down just a touch. Either that or actually measure it next time. (LOL)

I used full fat, all natural yogurt from a local Amish farmers market. I think the quality of the yogurt makes all the difference in this recipe. It was smooth and creamy...just melts in your mouth. I also substituted the sauce with the strawberry vin santo sauce available on epicurious. The whole recipe was super easy and it will become a repeat favorite in my house.

This was sickening sweet and not at all enjoyable. I was very disappointed. I have made the Cardamom Yogurt Pudding with Orange and Cinnamon Syrup (recipe on this site) and it was outstanding! I think I'll stick to that one in the future.

Delicious - I served with fresh berries.

This panna cotta is fantastic. Made it for the first time the other night for my boyfriend and me, and we both loved it. Perfectly smooth and velvety texture, great creamy flavor with a touch of tang from the yogurt. A nice "lighter" dessert than the usual cake or pie (even though it has plenty of heavy cream). Plus, it's ridiculously easy to make. I found that 3.5 hrs was plenty of time for the dish to set, but I'm sure individual refrigerator settings vary. A few variations: I used whole milk plain yogurt instead of lowfat and made a mixed berry compote made w/ sweet Moscato wine (recipe is on this site for a diff't panna cotta recipe). Superb. Plus, I didn't have custard cups, so I divided the mixture into 8 martini glasses to set, which gave an elegant and impressive presentation. I'll definitely make this again in the future.

When we returned from our vacation in Rome, I searched for a recipe that would duplicate the delicious panna cotta we ate there. This is not quite like the luxurious full cream Roman version, but it certainly is healthier and delicious in its own right! Terrific texture and a snap to make. To further reduce the fat content, I've tried it with table cream in place of whipping cream and it is still good (although lacking some of that "mouth feel"). I use the microwave instead of stove to heat the cream. Will be great with summer fruits of all kinds.

I used regular yogurt instead of low-fat. The panna cotta was very rich and creamy. The sweet/tart cherry and peach compote was perfect with the rich panna cotta. I cut the dried peaches into bite-size pieces. This recipe only yielded six 3/4 cup portions rather than eight as the recipe indicated. I will definitely make this recipe again -- it was so simple to make, so pretty on the plate and very delicious.

We made this recipe at the college where I work in hopes of getting rid of some of our unflavored gelatin. It was a very plesant suprise. We made the compote with cherries and cranberries only because we did not have any dried peaches on hand. Everyone really enjoyed it. Some of my crew suggested that we serve it during Christmas time because of the striking appearance of the deep red compote against the white yogurt panna cotta.
