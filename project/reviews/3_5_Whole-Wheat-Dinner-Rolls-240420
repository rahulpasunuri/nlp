These are wonderful! Very soft and chewy, like old-fashioned yeast rolls somebody's Grandma might make. I will definitely be making these again, probably for an old-fashioned Sunday dinner.

My cousin made this recipe at thanksgiving this year and it was OUTSTANDING. So light and soft and fluffy -- I usually think of whole wheat as dense and heavy. But these were heavenly. Better tasting than white flour dinner rolls.

This was my first attempt at making rolls of any kind, and my previous attempts at bread making (particularly wheat breads) have produced only so-so results. Although I had fairly low expectations for these (not the recipe itself but my skills in making them), I decided to give them a try for no less than Thanksgiving dinner. I was beyond thrilled with the results. Some people asked me which bakery I had gotten them from. I will definitely be making these again.

I have been looking for a DINNER ROLL recipe that I could make at all the holiday dinners -- found it! I followed the recipe and they turned out great! Not only that, they are a healthy starch -- I used stone-ground wheat and they were light and so-o flaky. The oats topping made it look professional.

Excellent, simple rolls that are tasty and moist. I used multi-grain flour instead of whole wheat and the results were very good. By the way, it doesn't matter if you have regular or quick-cooking oats for decoration.

These rolls are beautiful. I followed the recipe as written, except that I did the initial mixing and kneading in a stand mixer. 2 1/4 tsp yeast seems to be the correct amount, and I had no problem adding it to the dry ingredients as instructed. The result was soft, light rolls. I honestly don't know how someone could get bad results with this recipe, unless they measured incorrectly or didn't follow instructions.

I made these rolls last year and will make them again this year for Thanksgiving. It's a very easy recipe and makes an excellent roll - very tender.

I was really disappointed in this recipe. It was easy to prepare, but the flavor was just eh. Definitely not as good as I think a homemade roll should be.

These were good when hot from the oven, and not too hard to make. However, they were pretty hard the next day, and make too many to waste the effort unless you have whole wheat loving company.

Followed the directions as written. Also went with the total measurement of yeast, not number of packages. Loved the texture and flavor of these rolls. Got rave reviews all around. Changes for next time: 1) blooming yeast instead of mixed in dry, 2) same amount of dough, half as many rolls.

I'm a little confused. It says 2- 1/4 tsp yeast from two 1/4-oz. packages. Fleischman's says each 1/4-oz. package is 2- 1/4 tsp. I'm going with the measurement rather than the count. Hope that's right....

I followed the directions, but I think they were messed up. The directions say to put the yeast in with the dry ingredients... Not normal but I tried it anyway and it was a total disaster. I want to try these again but need better instructions.

It is very soft and great taste. I know it is supposed to be savory, but we like plain dinner roll so I didn't put spices. I added more sugar like other reviewer said. This will be my keeper!!

I really enjoyed these rolls; they were lighter than any other whole-wheat roll I've made thus far. Only one change:I think I think I might make them just a little sweeter next time.
