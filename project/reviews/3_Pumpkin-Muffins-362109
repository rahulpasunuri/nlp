I made these exactly according to the directions, with the following two exceptions:

Used 3 cups of flour and only 1 cup of sugar to make them more of a breakfast muffin. They took a little longer to bake for me, about 15 minutes. Very delicious!

I try not to review if I don'st stick to the directions, but I think I have something to add here. I made the un-fussy version as I don't have a stand mixer. I used a mix of mostly all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole wheat. I used regular sugar. I used an egg beater to mix until I got to adding in the flour, and then switched to a wooden spoon. I made 12 very full muffins which I rounded off with my hands while adding the sunflower seeds since I don't have an appropriate ice cream scoop. And I baked them for 20 minutes at 375, no change in temp. Taste-wise, these are 3 forks (very good), but they would get 4 forks on the look of them - just beautiful!

I used 2 cups of flour instead of the 3 and it came out DELISH!! Not dry at all!!

This recipe is from Sarabeth, goddess of bakedom. I made these muffins twice and they were perfect! I think those of you who thought they were dry made too many - you must follow the directions exactly. This is from Sarabeth's website: I find it magical that you would get so many muffins. If you look at the photo in the book, these are not tiny muffins. If you had scooped them larger according to the recipe you would have had to cook them according to the recipe and they would have still been very moist inside. A small muffins can often be dry. Check the photo at the beginning of the chapter and you will see the size in its raw state. The yield is 12-14 muffins, not 24. Your muffin scoop should measure 2 1/2 inches in diameter. The baking time would have been longer and the muffins very tender. Please make them again according to the directions and send me a photo if you can. Feel free to call me at the bakery if you like.

Way too dry. The batter was like playdough. I am not sure we will be able to eat them without dunking them in milk. Reduce flour. Add milk?

I do think there is a mistake in the flour quantity as noted by other reviewers. So, I made them once with 3 cups and once with 2 2/3 cups. The 2 2/3 cups version was the best. YUM! Also, the second time I made them I sprinkle chopped pumpkin seeds on top instead of sunflower seeds. We preferred the pumpkin seeds. I will definitely make these again and again.

There must be a typo with the amount of flour in this recipe. The muffins were dense as bricks and really dry. I would not recommend making these.

The muffin batter was "tough". I felt like it was a lot of beating for a muffin batter. I did cook them, but they did not rise. No flavor. Horrible recipe and I will not make them again.
