Everyone liked this. I personally thought it needed more dressing, and I even made extra! It had a good flavor, though. I left out the bell pepper since I detest it, and used half green, half red cabbage. God Bless Cuisinart! It made the whole dish a lot faster than I could have alone...

This is the most basic recipe that I could find, which is what I wanted. It was very tart, but adding 2 tlbsp of sugar made a good remedy. I love it and have it saved away for later. FOUR FORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!

I found the celery seed gave the slaw a bitter after taste. The adults didn't seem to mind but the children left it basically untouched.

Very good but, do not make it too early it tends to get soggy.

Nice slaw. Not overly sweet like the kind you get in a deli. Perhaps I had more than 8 cups cabbage but I needed to make alittle more dressing to coat everything sufficiently.

The best slaw I've ever made. I use this for all my picnics served with fried chicken and Boston baked beans. Add a little cayenne for spice.
