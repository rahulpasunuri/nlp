Very delicious and light recipe. Used frozen corn which tasted great and saved some time! Ratio of dressing to salad is just right in my opinion. The goat cheese really makes this stand out.

Rating: 4
This was great! I had to use thawed frozen corn - obviously, fresh would have been better but it's out of season at this point. I also used basil instead of marjoram.

This is a wonderful main dish salad. The proportions of the various ingredients don't matter that much...just make it to your liking. I used basil instead of marjoram, and doubled the dressing. This is a recipe that you can play with and it is great.

This is so good. Like others have said, substitutions are so easy since everything gets cooked separately and tossed together at the end. I loved someone's suggestion of using basil instead of marjoram so I did that as well, and I subbed asparagus for green beans only because I'd cooked with green beans the night before. I will make this again and again, by following the recipe as called for, or by changing it up as I like.

Delicious! This will be a regular of mine now. Subbed basil for the marjoram and used a ready-mix of red rice, quinoa & pearl barley as I couldn't get any farro but it was fab!

Fabulous. Great healthy week night recipe. Love the nutty farro.

Rating: 4
Ok, loved this recipe. The first time I made it I knew there were going to be substitutions because I'm not a fan of green beans. As a result, I haven't made it yet with green beans. First time I made it I did 3 substitutions. The first substitution was asparagus for the beans--very tasty. The second substitution was boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breast--I like that better. I also like cooking with garlic oil instead of straight up extra virgin olive oil so I used that instead. It came out great. Could I stop there? Absolutely not! The second time I made it I used buffalo steak. Buffalo steak isn't easy to find, but I've found it at Ralphs. It's leaner than cow steak, better for you and...well, I just think it tastes good. This time instead of using garlic oil I used cold pressed blood orange olive oil (gourmet olive oil lovers beware it's expensive but GOOD). I still did the asparagus for green bean substitution. As for the meat substitution, I gave it a dry rub of cracked black pepper and sea salt before cooking. I also did one other change. Instead of goat cheese I went for blue cheese and it's fantastic. This is an incredibly versatile recipe--easy to change up, easy to make and it's great doing it for lunches during the week.

Very good, but I'd recommend increasing the chicken to 3/4 lb and I agree with other reviewers that the marjoram is a bit much. Will try fresh oregano next time.

This was sooo good. My mom has an amazing chicken salad recipe but it is mayo based so I was on the hunt for something lighter. It is a very flexible recipe and you can easily change the grain, herbs, and veggies. It is a great recipe for families too, both my husband and toddler loved it.

Great week night recipe, and perfect for spring. Easy to make and filling. Would happily double this and take to summer picnics. Didn't have fresh corn, so I subbed half a pack of frozen peas, which worked out great. This will become a regular.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I didn't have marjaram so subbed basil. Also, for more flavor, I diced raw chicken, salt and peppered it and sauted it in olive oil. Our first serving was without goat cheese because I forgot. It was excellent. Then with the goat cheese, it went over the top. Good to know if you have folks who don't like goat cheese.

Rating: 4
This is awesome! I bought some Farro at Whole Foods yesterday and was looking for somehthing to make with it, and found this recipe. Like others, I grilled the chicken and served it separately, but I can easily see putting it in the salad. I didn't have any corn, but I used some frozen peas and grape tomatoes along with the green beans and green onions. .Also, my family is on a very low fat diet, so I reduced the total amount of olive oil to 1 tbsp, doubled the vinegar--used white balsamaic, and doubled the mustard-- used spicy brown mustard. This is a true keeper.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! Have made many times as written and revised. My fave way is with lots of fresh tarragon, fresh corn kernels, and the addition of baby tomatoes. Basil also worked well. We also enjoyed it with salmon, dill, feta and grilled asparagus as substitutions.

Rating: 2
I agree with the review that said it tasted like soap. If you have never used marjoram before, I would avoid it. If you like that herb, then the recipie would be fine. I liked the rest of the dish, I suspect I will make it again with another herb such as thyme, rosemary or maybe some basil.

Rating: 4
LOVED this! The only thing I didn't like was the marjoram. It was my first time trying the herb and it gave the dressing a cleaner-like taste to it. I'll be trying oregano instead next time.

Rating: 3
Also...I doubled the dressing since I substituted the 1/2 cup farro for 3/4 cp quinoa.

Rating: 3
I used quinoa instead of farro because farro is pretty expensive. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar because it is what I had on hand. I took the suggestions of others and used dried oregano instead of marjoram (and didn't have any basil on hand). Lastly, I used frozen green beans and added 1 minced clove of garlic....all this to say even with the substitutions this recipe produced an excellent and filling dinner. Next time, though, I would add either fresh basil or mint as cooks suggested.

Rating: 4
While we enjoyed this as a meal by itself, it's an elegant side dish to a northern Italian meal. Complex flavors, very nice variety of textures between the tender Farro and crisp beans and corn. Not difficult to make and certainly more impressive than most cold Summer salads.

Wow, what a fantastic, quick summer dinner! The only change I made was substituting Trader Joe's Harvest Grain Blend for the farro. I was so good I had the leftovers for breakfast!

Looks so simple, tastes so amazing. The only thing I changed was used feta instead of goat (boyfriend's preference) and used leftover chicken that had garam masala on it. Wow.

I love this recipe! I have made it many times with several different variations. I like to make it sometimes with blue cheese instead of goat cheese. I also like to make it with israeli cous cous instead of farro. Every time it is a hit!

Really great dish. Very easy, great presentation, lots of texture, perfect for a party. Even after days of eating the leftovers, I still enjoyed it.

This one fell flat for us. I love farro; my husband does not. He thought there was not much flavor. I thought it was good, but not great, and I had to doctor it quite a bit to give it flavor. I also thought the farro got lost in all the other ingredients. Nothing offensive, but I would not make it again.

Rating: 4
As its the middle of summer and all of these veggies are in season this was delicious! I needed more dressing than the recipe called for but otherwise I followed it to pretty much the letter.

Rating: 4
Nice dish for the summer. I used wheat berries and basil since I could not find farro or marjoram, increased the amount of chicken to 1 lb, and doubled the amount of dressing. It made a very generous meal for 2 which we used as leftovers thus making generous serving for 4 in all.

Rating: 4
This one is a keeper. Made it twice already in the past two weeks. Both times have followed the recipe closely with a couple of exceptions. We used basil instead of marjoram, as others have reported doing, and used quinoa as a less expensive alternative to farro. Absolutely delicious. Next time we might shred the chicken rather than dice it for texture and presentation.

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe! We stretched it with a double portion of farro and lots of baby spinach leaves and it made a great one-dish supper. Next time will add some arugula.

This is a great dish! For some reason I could not find farro at the whole foods near my home, but decided to try it with brown rice pasta instead. It was delicious. I would recommend adding more white balsamic vinegar and definitely add cherry tomatoes.

Rating: 3
Delicious and healthy. It adapts well. I've made it as written and other times with changes depending on what's fresh. I recently made it with asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and grilled chicken, and that combination was wonderful. As others have mentioned, cherry tomatoes are a nice addition.

Rating: 4
Amazing dish. Found farro at Whole Foods, and made everything else as it called for expect I did 1 TBS of red wine vinegar and 1 TBS of white vinegar since I didn't have white wine vinegar. Couldn't imagine not using fresh marjoram, which I also found at Whole Foods, as it really infused the olive oil and brought out the flavors of the shallot and green onions. Perfect summery, light dish that really fills you up!

Rating: 3
Outstanding and simple. I served grilled chicken separately instead of dicing it in the salad. With the farro as a side, I had to tinker with the amounts of beans and corn (I used frozen because its been a bad winter for produce and there were no green bean at the market!). The dressing is so good and would go with tons of salads. This would be great for a picnic, too. And makes a good lunch leftover.

Rating: 3
I used less oil, half the chicken, frozen corn, dried marjoram, and a little less goat cheese. I might consider omitted the cheese entirely or using even less. It really doesn't need it.

Crazy good! Loved it! Used what I had...fresh parsley, dill, zucchini (sauteed), lemon juice instead of vinegar and queso cheese...served over spinach leaves. Already know I'm making it again this weekend. I am now a huge fan of farro!

Rating: 4
I use white cheddar cheese and add a little Worcestershire sauce (about a Tablespoon) to the dressing.

Rating: 4
made this last night when looking for something healthy and different. I had farro on hand from a much heavier recipe and was a bit worried this would be heavy. It was so delicious and filling without putting me to sleep! Not only that, but farro was much easier for me to make than rice (which either goes wrong or just takes too long.) It's quick to put together too - I will definitely be making it more often. Used dijon and a bit more mustard than recommended. Also used rice wine vinegar because it's what I had on hand. It tasted fine, but I think I'll try the white wine vinegar when I can pick it up.

So good! And easy! I used quinoa instead of farro and it worked like a charm...

This dish will become my weeknight regular! It is hearty yet healthy and so easy to make! I recommend doubling farro and adding cherry tomatoes. I skipped the corn. Instead of pan searing the chicken breast I marinated it cut into pieces in the mixture of olive oil, mustard, salt a little vinigar and then grilled it. Although I could have easily skipped the chicken all together. The salad is fabulous without it! Finally the dressing is amazing and makes the dish! Can't wait to make it again!

Really easy and really tasty. Plus I think it's the kind of recipe you can play with. I ended up using champagne vinegar as that's what I had, dried marjoram, and Parmesan since something was off with my goat cheese. Will be making this again and again. Our first time trying farro and it's wonderful.

De-lish! For those of you having trouble finding Farro, you may find it at your local Costco. Mine (Minneapolis) carries a 48-oz bag of organic Italian Pearled Farro branded "Earthly Delights". Ask for it!

Rating: 4
Followed recipe mostly as directly but I increased Farro to 2 cups so I had plenty of leftovers. I also sauted the corn, added diced muchrooms and raw sweet unions. Put in a handful of cherry tomatoes from the garden too. Yum! FYI - Farro can be found at Whole Foods in the bulk section.

Rating: 4
Mmmmmm. I followed the recipe to the T, using farro that I found at Costco, of all places. Try not to skip the fresh marjoram - it lends a heavenly flavor, and it goes beautifully with goat cheese. I served it as a main dish for supper and everyone loved it - father-in-law, kids, hubby. Since this is a dish that will travel well, it's going to be my go-to dish for potlucks, picnics, and teachers' luncheons! Healthy and nutritious to boot!

Rating: 4
This is fantastic! I'm not a big fan of goat cheese, so instead we used good sharp white cheddar. Also used balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. And, used stone ground mustard instead of dijon. Just personal preference in terms of flavor. This is such a great meal in one!

Rating: 4
This recipe provided a delightfully different meal for my husband and I. I couldn't find farro at the local Henry's but I imagine Whole Foods would have had it. As suggested by others, we used both quinoa and couscous instead. We also added cherry tomatoes which kicked the veggies up a notch. Overall, quite pleasing and easy to make.

Rating: 3
This was good and we enjoyed it. First, the substitutions. We couldn't find farro or fresh majoram in our small town, so we used quinoa and basil as others have suggested. I also doubled the amount of quinoa and kept the dressing amount the same, which made for a nicely pulled together salad - not over dressed. Further, we used frozen corn (cooked it along with the green beans), and I didn't have a shallot so I used half the amount, but a minced red onion. Also, I forgot to include the green onion. And I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth instead of water. I don't know how fresh goat cheese differs from feta, but i used feta, and about half the amount suggested. I realize this is a ridiculous amount of substitutions, but everything else was the same! I think the basic integrity of the salad is the same. That being said, it tasted and smelled like a good, fresh hamburger with all the veggies. It was really weird and disconcerting how much it smelled and tasted like a hamburger, and I can't explain it, but there it is. But it was really good (because I like hamburgers) and we will definitely make this again. This salad (with the extra quinoa) made a lot, and just a little filled us up really well.

Rating: 4
This recipe was AMAZING - the goat cheese really made the difference! As a vegetarian, I didn't use the chicken, and I by chance threw in some cherry tomatoes that I happened to have. I think it made a huge difference that all the veggies were in season and from the local farmers market. I also only added 1 TB oil and used 3 TB rice vinegar instead of the white wine vinegar. I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Rating: 3
This is one of my go-to light lunch dishes. I love farro. I've tried substituting chickpeas for the chicken, which was okay, but not amazing. I think I'll try edamame next and see what happens. Maybe throw in some fresh cherry tomatoes from my garden too. It's quite good just as it is anyhow.

Rating: 4
yum yum!! like others, i used quinoa instead of farro. couldn't find farro. never made quinoa before either, cooked it the same way they said to cook the quinoa. worked OK, although i salted the water too much and it tasted salty when I was done, although when mixed with everything else it wasn't a problem. Great light easy to make meal. My husband and I loved it.

We loved this dish. I changed it up by grilling a few chicken breast marinated in pomegranate, shallot, champagne vinegar, fresh marjoram, and olive oil. Served the breast whole and did a warmed salad of the farro, corn and green beans. My husband LOVED it. I am lucky enough to have some of the freshest goat cheese available and it was lovely. The flavors are amazing when it all comes together. Definite keeper.

I thought this recipe was great and absolutely delicious. I used quinoa instead of farro (just because I had some already) and replaced corn with tomatoes (for the same reason). Really filling and tastey. I saved the leftovers and had it for lunch today.

Good salad, but could use some adjustments to make it a 4-fork, IMHO. I actually used real farro perlato (happened to be in Umbria recently), and I think this recipe would be better with less corn and more farro (farro tastes great, btw, so why drown it out with so much corn?). Also, more chicken and fewer green beans. I used a goat cheese with the consistency of feta, which "crumbled" well.

This is a great recipe, lends itself to many varitions. I used oregano instead marjoram and grated parmesan instead of goat cheese, sugar snap peas and mushrooms. Also worked well with left-over steak instead of chicken.

Great salad! I made it last week and have been craving it ever since. Like other reviewers, I used quinoa. My family ate all of the fresh corn, so I substituted canned baby corn. I used basil instead of marjoram. I don't think this is a recipe where you can use "exact" amounts. You need to make enough of the dressing so that you can add it to taste. I can't wait to make it with regular corn now. Delicious.

I made this with whole wheat quinoa instead of farro (hard to find). The goat cheese is a must and really does blend the flavors quite nicely. We actually ate this warm and enjoyed it, but next time I may put less vinegar as I found this flavor a bit overpowering.

This is delicious! I used Quinoa instead of Farro (you can find it at Costco) and I doubled it to one cup instead of 1/2. I also upped the amount of chicken and used a rotisserie chicken instead of breasts. I added fresh tomatoes (a must!) and increased parts of the dressing (oil, vinegar, and mustard) by half to make up for the increased quantity of food. I substituted basil for marjoram as it's what I had on hand. Topped off the meal with a sweet fruit on the side. Excellent use for that grower's market fare!

I made this last night and it was delicious. Perfect summer dish and very healthy...not to mention, very easy.

This was nice, but not four forks for me. I served it as a main course and therefore increased the chicken to nearly one breast per person. Next time I'd skip the pan frying and poach the breasts in low- sodium chicken broth to keep them more moist. Substituted quinoa as could not find farro even in my gourmet shops - the natural foods store might be a better bet. I also doubled the quinoa to 1 cup and upped the dressing. I thought the marjoram was overpoweringly strong. Perhaps I'm just not accustomed to this flavor. Would use less, or else would sub tarragon next time.

Rating: 4
This is a great, well-balanced salad perfect to break the summer heat. Per other reviewers comments, I made 1.5x the called for dressing. I couldn't find farro so I used wheatberries instead (just cook for 1 hr w/ 3x water). Delicious!

Wow! This was very good, especially on a hot summer day. I used the farro, substituted rotisserie chicken, blanched the corn for 5 min. in hot water before cutting off the kernals, used fresh basil instead of marjoram, and sea salt instead of kosher salt. The farro takes at least 50 minutes to cook (1 cup in 5 cups water, bring to boil, simmer 50-60 min.) From start to finish, about 1.25 hours and oh so worth it!

Nice healthy dish. I grilled the chicken, and served the goat cheese per person, sparingly, as it seemed like a lot to me. Oh, and I used quinoa instead of the farro, as I couldn't readily find it at the grocery store and didn't have time to search for it.

Rating: 3
This recipe was very healthy and filling. I added more chicken (2 breasts= about 1 lb.). Next time I would add more farro as you barely noticed it and I adjusted the goat cheese to each persons liking by simply sprinkling it on top. I am not sure I am a fan of marjoram so I might substitute another spice the next time I make it. Also the faro took a little more time to cook than indicated in the recipe.

Excellent dish for hot summer days. I love anything with farro. Farmer's market veggies and herbs made this especially tasty. I favor sheep's feta cheese so that was my only substitution, which I served on the side so guests could add to taste. It was loved by all.

I made this last night for dinner for my boyfriend & I. We both thought it was great! Although I will make a couple of changes the next time I make this; I will cook up twice the amount of chicken- 8 oz = 1/2 lb & not enough. I think a full pound would do it. Also, I used farro, but farro's pretty pricey & hard to find. I think the recipe would be just as good or maybe even better with quinoa, or brown rice, or Israeli couscous instead.... Also, I wouldn't be quite as heavy-handed with the goat cheese. I love cheese and rarely hold back but 2 oz vs. 4 oz I think worked much better. I think if I had used the full 4 oz, it would've overpowered the dish to the point where all you'd be tasting is the cheese.

I made this recipe last night - it was excellent! My husband and I both loved it. I used mint instead of marjoram and added a minced clove of garlic as well. To save time, I used frozen haricots verts and charbroiled corn from Trader Joe's. Next time I'm going to double the farro - a 1/2 cup is so little, you might have missed it if you didn't know it was there. Definitely a keeper!

Really good and simple. Perfect for a weeknight recipe but tasty enough that you would serve if friends popped by. Tastes super fresh and is definitely one of those meals that tastes better the longer it sits so it would be good for a make ahead dish. To make it easy, I threw the green beans the last 4 minutes of cooking the farro, and they were fine. I also added some halved cherry tomatoes.
