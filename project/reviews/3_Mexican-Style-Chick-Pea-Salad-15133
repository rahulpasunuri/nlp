I love this recipe. It might not be 'exceptional' but it's definitely delicious. I made it for the 1st time with everything except for the hot chiles & jalepenos b/c I didn't have them on hand. I might add some sambal oelek to give it some heat, but it tastes great as is right now too. I will be making this one again for sure - so fast, easy, tasty and healthy. Love it!

The results of this recipe depends a lot on the chipotles in adobo that you use. Mine came out very spicy but tasty too. It needed a bit more salt and pepper. When I make it again, I will definitely mash about a can of the chickpeas, to add more texture variety. This recipe makes a LOT! Definitely serves more than 6 for a side dish. I wouldn't say that it's the best salad I've ever made, but it's definitely worth making again.

I'm hoping this becomes more interesting after a night in the refrigerator. The flavor is nothing special--just some heat and some chick-peas. I served it with salmon & mango salsa, and this salad was the low-point of the dinner.

Went over like a charm at our dinner club. Did not peel and deseed tomatoes, and did a lot of mincing in the Cuisinart.

I too skipped seeding and peeling tomatos, and I substituted additional chipoltes for the japaleno... was a big hit at a vegan picnic, but not so popular with a meat and potatoes crowd. I found it tasty and easier than potato salad or another labor-intensive summer classic.

A cool salad for a hot summer! Went well with quesadillas. Good textures.

This had a great flavor, and I highly recommend it. Next time I make it, however, I will not peel the tomatoes. I think that the salad loses something without the texture of the tomato peel. (Of course, it is also time consuming.)

Excellent summer fare, very appropriate for a casual patio dinner. Also, great for buffets.

This is a tried and true favorite. Guaranteed to be among the best side-salads at any summer picnic. I have been making this dish for the two years since the recipe first appeared and it always rakes in rave reviews. The ingredients are easy to keep on hand, are inexpensive, and when combined the flavors are a bit different than (but complimentary to) the usual picnic fare. Good with freshly husked corn kernels, too. Bonus: it is better made ahead and travels well so you can bring it wherever summer may lead you.
