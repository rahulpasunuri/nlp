Wonderful!!! I made this receipe for a family reunion. There was nothing left. Some even ate it on its own. Thank You! I substituted parsely for chopped basil leaves. Next time I'll tried it with parsely.

I came upon this recipe because I needed to use some Roma tomatoes and feta cheese. I modified it- I used a diced white onion, skipped the EVOO/olives/parsley, and substituted in fresh spinach (loosely chopped). It was delicious, but I think my version was a little lacking because of the white onions. Still, a fresh way to have lunch- will try the olives next time!

This is SO yummy and easy!!! And we don't even have good tomatoes in Florida. I made this with regular black pitted olives. Don't like the other kind. I thought a jar or two of artichokes cut up might be nice with it! It's a keeper for sure ;)

This hit the spot. I had tons of heirloom tomatoes from my garden and wanted to try a new spin on a tomato salad. I usually make it the Italian way with good olive oil, sea salt, fresh mozzarella and basil. I liked the addition of feta cheese and olives. Try these ingredients on a homemade pizza...yum!

Like others, I used basil in place of parsley and cut the onion into small pieces. It was delicious and we will absolutely have this again. One other comment; I love olives of all kinds but I do not think they add a lot to this salad.

Great! This has been a favorite of mine. I don't use onion, and I use regular pitted black olives. On hot nights, we eat this solely for dinner!

Simple, elegant and tasty. Feta seems to be the in cheese right now but I personally would prefer blue.

This has been a family favorite for years. Garden fresh tomatoes with Imperial Sweet onions makes a winner. It was my salad for Thanksgiving dinner and got rave comments.

Delicious and easy. I use chopped basil, no olives, a small dish of mayonaisse in the middle of the platter for those who like it in addition to the oil and vinegar, and when available a combination of red and yellow tomatoes. Looks as good as it tastes.

Wonderful. Used kalmata olives, don't over due. Suggest precutting tomatoes and letting them drain in sieve for a couple of hours. Also, substitued fresh basil for parsley. I prefer chopping tomatoes and onions, copying a recipe from The Palm Restaurant, easier to deal with on a picnic.

This one is a keeper. I substituted fresh mozzarella balls for the feta cheese.

We make this salad at our deli and it's a great hit. Rather than slice the tomatoes we just chop them and mix everything together. We even serve it on focaccia bread with turkey and alfalfa sprouts. Our customers love it.

We loved this salad - have made it with parsley, and then again with basil, as suggested by some of the cooks - we liked it both ways. Some of our guests didn't like the olives, leaving more for me!

I used finely chopped Shallot onions instead of red. I served this arranging the tomatoe salad portion on one side of the plate and chopped romaine lettuce on the other side drizzling the oil and vinegar over all of it. This would be excellent to serve with the "Filet Mignon with Mushrooms and Madeira", Bon Appetit, May 2001 found on this website.

This dish was absolutely a wonderful hit at a July4th picnic. I used some fresh green pepper rings, and used Kraft balsamic vinaigrette dressing, and used provolone and mozzarella shreds on top.

Loved this with roma tomatoes right out of the garden and using fresh basil instead of the parsley. No matter how much I make, I never have any left over...everyone loves this.

I made this for a spring lunch party and served it with a selection of salads and a piece of barbecued sirloin of beef. It was very popular and is a great addition to a salad buffet.

Excellent side dish! I've made it three times already and everyone loved it. It makes a lovely presentation on a nice platter.

A very good salad and easy to prepare. We suggest that using chopped red onion might be an improvement.

Use very thin sliced red onion, basil and capers as suggested...YES!

I left out the onions entirely (actually I forgot them, but didn't miss them). My party guests loved it and it was a beautiful addition to my buffet served on a bright yellow platter!

I made this for an end-of-summer bayside picnic. People raved. The only negative were non-olive people overwhelmed by the Kalmatas. Next time I think I'll try it with balsamic vinegar. Thanks.

This salad tasted good, but what made it great was how little time it takes to prepare. I followed a previous reviewer's advice and used fresh basil instead of parsley. Next time I'm going to use less onions (they overpowered the tomatoes)and more oil and vinegar. A great recipe for those with no time who still want tasty food.

I added a clove of minced freshe garlic. Great way to use up garden tomatoes!

Very good, BUT a more wonderful variation calls for fresh basil and oregano -- skip the parsley -- and consider adding capers!
