I absolutely love this recipe and have made it a couple times. It is a little on the salty side if you add the second addition of salt. I like to add a little extra garlic because my husband loves it. I usually serve this with some rosemary potato wedges.

Very quick and easy! Enjoyed this with a side of fresh green beans and almond rice pilaf.

Quick and easy! The beef tasted wonderful. Don't overcook the beef when first sauteeing since it will cook more when added back into wine sauce. Mine was a bit too salty. Next time I will back off on the salt that is added to the wine. Could have been the combination of salt and the white wine. I paired this with a side of sauteed mushrooms, shallots and spinach. Perfect!

Who knew! White wine for beef! Made this recipe about a month ago and it turned out great. Coating the steak in flour before cooking made a huge difference. I made it with rice and sauteed broccoli.

Lots of great recipes on this site, but I didn't really enjoy this one. Not for me. Bland!

The beef was very nice. Tender and juicy. I thought there was way too much rosemary though. Almost felt like I was eating pine! Also, did not find it too salty at all. Overall I think it is a great preparation and I would make it again but with about half the fresh rosemary. I also sauted some onions with the beef and thought that was a good addition.

I read the reviews and still forgot to take out the second addition of salt, though I completely intended too. I attempted to correct this as much as I could by increasing the addition of wine to dilute the salt and was partially successful though I still think it was too salty. I do want to try this again, though next time I will make sure to not add the second round of seasoning to the saute and I want to try this with a red wine instead.

It seems like it is really just beef stroganoff - without the stroganoff. The white wine reduction was nice, but overall - not much to it.

As, written, I give the recipe 2 stars for the amount of salt in the dish. Way too salty! Other than that, it was very tender. I will definitely try it again with less salt.

This was really delicious! I must admit I quite forgot to add the second portion of salt so now that I read your reviews I must say that the salt on the meat was definitely enough. A quick and easy recipe and a real fancy dinner!

Really tasty dish. I added a little bit of fresh lemon juice and it turned out great! Make sure not to overcook the beef. Highly recommended.

I enjoyed this dish -- and agreed, so easy to make. Thanks to the previous reviewers for the head's up on the salt. We used less than called for and felt it was just fine.

This recipe is very good. I found it quick and easy to make as well and perfect for a weeknight. I agree that it was a tad too salty and would maybe not add the salt when adding the wine.

The rosemary, garlic, and white wine were really nice with the beef, but way too much salt in the recipe. Otherwise, super easy, fast, and tasty.
