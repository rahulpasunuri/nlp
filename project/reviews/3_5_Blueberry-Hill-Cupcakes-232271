What am I missing here? This recipe was under "lowfat" but in both the batter and the frosting there is whole milk and butter....when did those two ingredients become lowfat? I'm confused. I haven't tried this recipe yet but can't say I will.

I made a few changes, I added a tablespoon of lemon zest, 3/4 cup regular sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and two cups of blueberries. Still, they came out a little bland. I couldn't taste the lemon at all. They were moist though. I topped them with sliced almonds just before baking but I am going to try the frosting.

I agree with elita1. These cupcakes are just blueberry muffins dressed as cupcakes by putting some frosting on top. They're very good if a muffin is what you are going for, but if you are hungry for a cupcake, like I was, they might disappoint.

delish... halved the recipe for twelve healthy sized cupcakes and made the frosting with turbinado sugar and a dash of maple syrup, as well as lemon zest and a touch of local blueberry honey.

I made mini-cupcakes from the recipe. I didn't change anything in the cake recipe, but used a little maple syrup in the frosting instead of the maple sugar. We didn't really like the maple flavor with the cupcakes. If I made this again, I'd add a little lemon zest and lemon extract instead of the maple. The cupcakes did look really pretty.

I almost never give 4 forks, but I have to give it to this recipe. I am baking challenged and have ruined many a cupcake and these were the best ever. Moist and light. Not too sweet. I added a little more lemon zest than called for and that added a nice note to the taste. Used turbanado sugar instead of maple and the crunchiness in the frosting was great. They were near perfection. Don't think I'd change a thing.

Very good.The cupcakes were light and not too sweet, so the frosting complimented it. However, the frosting was a little runny.

Ok, let's be honest here, this is NOT a cupcake recipe, it's a blueberry muffin recipe dressing up with frosting and pretending to be a cupcake. That being said, the muffins are pretty tasty, light and moist, but tastes better without the frosting in our household's opinion. I did make the frosting, using 2 Tbsp maple syrup, and 1/4 cup organic sugar instead of the maple sugar. It was definitely sweet enough, can't imagine needing more sugar! There was still a light crunch in the frosting, but I don't even know if more would be good, (kinda like eating sand). Overall, the frosting really seems to over powers the muffin.

I use turbinado or natural sugar as maple is hard to find and the one I use still adds the crunch. Pauline

These cupcakes are to die for! They don't brown - note!! I used Swan's Down Cake Flour and they came out moist and fullfy. Also I cooled the melted butter before adding to the oil (which I used corn since I didn't have canola). Adding something hot that is going into the oven will make it dry (same for brownies). I decorated with blueberries & mint. They look so cute! Will definitely make again!

This is hardly a cupcake. More like a muffin, and kind of a bland one at that. They're kind of dry and really dense. I recommend you skip this recipe.

These cupcakes are amazing, for a healthier version used King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour instead of white flour, also, used all natural non-fat organic vanilla yogurt instead of the buttermilk and plain version, and also used organic unrefined turbinado sugar instead of regular sugar...Also added different frosting: combining 8 oz. cream cheese (at room temperature) w/ melted 2/3 cup butter, and 1 cup unrefined turbinado sugar--this complemented the sweet blueberries in the cupcakes and was not as overpowering as I imagined the other one would have been! Big hit and will definitely make them again!!

These cupcakes were very good, even without the mint sprigs! They were moist in the middle and there were just the right amount of blueberries!

I'm not usually one to bake, so, for me, these were surprisingly easy. Like a previous reviewer, I used regular sugar instead of maple (18! no way), and added 1.5 tblsps of maple syrup. The frosting is good, and a bit crunchy. I'm not sure if that's the desired effect but it didn't detract from the flavour. The combination was really quite complex (and very sweet, too!) As far as the batter, i would add fewer berries. This is probably my own fault, as I didn't use muffin liners, but they came out a bit lopsided and too berry-y. Still tasted good!

I've made these cupcakes twice in two days. The first time I made them I substituted a cup and a fourth whole wheat flour for all purpose, used buttermilk, left out the lemon peel and used about two cups of blueberries. They were very good, leaning toward the muffin side, but that's fine with me. Today i deliberately tried turning this into muffins, using the same changes as before except I used only whole wheat pastry flour. They were still very good! I did not make the frosting.

I have made these twice and they are just wonderful. Maple sugar is hard to find, so I order it online, but it is so worth it. It is important to not serve these in a warm environment because I had a problem with the icing melting and dripping off the cupcakes once for a party in the summer. Because of the sugar, they melt easily.

YUM!! I made these for a 4th of July party and everyone raved about them. They were perfectly sweet and the blueberries added just the right amount of tartness. I used frozen blueberries for the batter and fresh for the top. I also couldn't find maple sugar so I used regular, organic sugar and put in about a tablespoon of maple syrup. Refrigerating the frosting the night before and letting it come to room temperature before applying solved the issue of runny frosting (according to some reviews). A great cupcake recipe and would definitely make it again!

Love, love, love! We can't get maple sugar in France, so I used vanilla sugar, left out the vanilla extract from the icing, and added some lemon zest. Definitely recommended, and I'll make them again... so easy!

I couldn't find maple sugar anywhere, but I wanted to have the maple taste in the frosting -- so I actually substituted a TBSP of Vermont maple syrup. The taste was great, but made the frosting a bit runny. Just meant that they needed to be kept chilled to hold shape.

These are fabulous cafe' muffins! We didn't want to do the frosting - instead, just sprinkled with sugar in the last 10 minutes of baking. Also, I didn't have buttermilk and used NonFat/Light Mixed Berry Yogurt, which I had on hand - they were fabulous! Next time, I'll double the recipe as they were gobbled up immediately!

I also made these into mini-cupcakes for a large party with other desserts. I thought they were great. Although we have great blueberries in Oregon, I opted to use frozen wild blueberries because they're smaller in size, better for the minis. I found maple sugar at the natural food store, but the price was outrageous, so I used turbinado sugar instead. I got a lot of comments on how great the crunch was. Also added some lemon zest to the frosting. Had difficulty with the frosting as it was too slippery, then too hard after refrigerating for a bit. Once they were finally frosted, the frosting stayed and was fine, but it took a little time and effort. Overall, great reception to these and I'd definitely make them again.

I made half into mini cupcakes (needed about 15 minutes cooking time). I thought they were pretty good. The sweetness of the frosting (only used a very thin layer) complemented the cake part well. I also added white chocolate chips (about 1 cup) to the batter.

I made these thinking that they would be cupcakes...not muffins! I was dissapointed about that, but they were very good as muffins. The frosting was awful and therefor ate them plain! Oh well!

One more thing I just learned from serving them is that the icing melts very quickly, so I suggest keeping them in the refrig until about 20 minutes prior to serving them. I served them on the Wilton cupcake stand and since the stand tilts the cupcakes out a bit, the blueberry garnish won't stay on. I used royal icing flowers in violet and mint leaves to garnish.

I made these for work. The icing is to die for! I was able to find the maple sugar at a gourmet food store. I didn't see it at Wegman's or Whole Foods. I highly recommend that you use this icing even with a plain old box cake in the future.

I made these into mini-cupcakes and everyone loved them. The maple sugar icing was really unique--a flavor I had never tasted before. Because the icing is so rich, it was nice to have just a small, bite-sized cupcake. The recipe made about 60 mini-cupcakes. I modified the baking time to about 14 minutes.

Yummy - although they came out a little dense. I think I'd be sure to really whisk those wet ingred. well next time to get it a little lighter. I also used frozen blueberries and I doubt it made a difference. I also used lemon oil for the zest. All in all, great flavor though. My daughter said that they were the best she'd ever had! But then she's three...

I used frozen blueberries instead of fresh, and I don't think it made any difference. I also added some lemon zest and a teaspoon or two of lemon juice to the frosting, which makes it deliciously tangy. Otherwise the maple sugar is too sweet. Very tasty and more sophisticated than a plain cupcake

I made these instead of cake for my son's birthday party. I added orange zest to the frosting and instead of maple sugar, I used "Sugar in the Raw". They were lite and very moist, the perfect treat on a hot summer day. The only trouble I had was keeping the frosting on the muffins which could have been the weather entirely. Next time I may try adding more powdered sugar but all in all a great recipe.
