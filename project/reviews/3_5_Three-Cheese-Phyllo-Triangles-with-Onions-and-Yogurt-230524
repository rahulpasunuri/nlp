I'm not Greek, so I am not in the war of words here, but I loved this recipe. I used a locally made Mexican cheese, a type of Queso Fresco, in place of Ricotta. It is a soft cow cheese but it crumbles like Feta. I used common brand named Feta and Pecorino cheeses. Anyway, this recipe was a success and my guest (my 100% Sicilian mother-in-law) loved them. There was too much mix per dough, I had to through out about 1/2 a cup's worth. Dill in the dip at the end was perfect!

These were good, but not worth either the effort or the expense of the ingredients. I used whole milk ricotta, pecorino, and high quality feta and greek yogurt. Too much pastry to cheese ratio. They really were fine, but I'd rather make some bruschetta as a pre-dinner snack or appetizer next time.

I think Miss Bouboulina should not rate a recipe when it has not been tried. I too know a thing or two about Greek cuisine, and the thing I appreciate most is how diverse the cuisine is from region to region. Diane Kochilas is so talented at finding these recipes, that could be lost some day as Greece modernizes and loses women cooking in the kitchens to becoming lawyers etc... My mother in law often uses olive oil to brush the filo, and we are from the Peloponeses. This recipe is wonderful coming from the sheparding regions of Greece, and it makes the meal that much more interesting when I can tell my non-Greek dinner guests the history and geography of what they eat in my Greek home. I do change the recipe a bit as I like the pie version better than the triangles.

OK - I'm Greek and I have to say this is not the best "tiropita"or cheese pie I have ever had - did not make it but have had it a million times in my life, both from my mother's sweet hands and at various Greek markets. I have never, ever heard of anyone in all my life, making tiropita, whether in little triangles or a pie, sauteeing onions and using oil for phyllo dough. As in Italy, and other countries I suppose, Greece has very different cooking methods and recipes by region. As for the poster who asked whether there is more than one type of myzithra --- YES, THERE ARE TWO KINDS. One is the hard kind which you obviously, and mistakenly bought - this is always put through and grater and used on our macaroni dishes - I love it more than any pecorino romano, or other cheese which is so boringly touted and marketed in this country. It is absolutely delicious. However, there is a second kind which is a soft and much milder cheese, also call Myzithra but this one we call a "table cheese" meaning you eat it with food, olives, and mezethes (Greek appetizers) really great and so different from the hard version. I hope you can get to try it some day - try to find a Greek produce market and they should have it but make sure you ask for the soft version ... Enjoy.

I too, LOVED this dish and the reference to the "damn kitchen towel". Actually, that's how most cooks feel the first few times they work with phyllo dough, but don't be afraid! I made a double batch as part of an heavy appetizer menu for a 50th anniversary party for my in-laws with 100 guests. I did use the myzithra greek cheeses but substituted one-half for whole-milk ricotta to make the filling creamier. (Try draining your yogurt in a paper coffee-filter placed in a strainer for easy results.) I also substituted unsalted(melted) butter for the olive oil for brushing the phyllo. I didn't find the recipe too salty. I DO however find the assembly directions with the phyllo needlessly complicated. Place your stack of phyllo dough in front of you "portrait" style (short edge facing you) and cut in half down the center long ways, so you have two stacks, NOT four. Cover stacks with "damn" towel and take a piece at a time and brush lightly with melted butter and fold over so the long edges meet. Place your tablespoon of filling in the lower right hand corner, and fold up so right edge makes a "triangle" with the left edge and continue folding until you have a little "pocket" triangle. Brush lightly with melted butter as necessary. Wonderful!

I am wondering if there are different kinds of myzithra. The recipe says that ricotta can be used as a substitute - but the one I bought, which was made in Greece, was a hard chunk (kind of in the parmesan family). The triangles were basically delicious and this is a very good recipe. But the consensus was that the filling was way too salty and overpowering, as a result of this cheese. I will make these again using the ricotta instead.

What happened to all of our reviews? Specifically, what about that "damn" kitchen towel. (Those of you that were here before they edited will understand)
