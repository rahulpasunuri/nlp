I cut the bread at 2" intervaks and then sliced each piece vertically through the soft middle, then I spread the parsley butter on the cut sides and put the pieces under the broiler to crisp and toast them. Crispy and tasty!!

We were really disappointed by this recipe. We found it lacking in taste, quite bland.

Well, I neglected to measure the salt and it came out far too salty... but luckily I love salt so it was still delicious! I will definitely make again (but measure the salt next time) since I could tell it was a fantastic garlic bread. Another thing we did was melt the butter, garlic, and salt in the microwave before we poured it over the bread. That seemed to work just fine, and didn't require using the blender or food processor.

The garlic butter was delicious, and I think using excellent quality olive oil was important. I would have preferred it to be a bit more crispy, so next time I will probably cut the slices right through and lie them flat on a cookie sheet.

DELICIOUS!! I used one french loaf instead of the baguettes and cut at 2" intervals for easy serving. We served as an appetizer, but would also be great with dinner.

So easy to make and everyone loves it. A great basic garlic bread for any occasion.

I usually prefer giving just three forks for excellent recipies - a dish beyond compare is hard to find... But this one certainly deserves all the praise.

I gave a surprise party for my mom, and had to prepare the meal the day before as to keep the secret. This bread was very easy; I kept it in the fridge overnight wrapped in foil, then cooked for the party. Everyone thought it was wonderful. I did substitute basil for the parsley.

We have found our garlic bread 'keeper' recipe. Very tasty.

I took previous reviewers' advice and increased the amount of butter to 3 Tbsp and decreased the olive oil by 1 Tbsp. It was very tasty and went very well with the cioppino recipe on this site. Next time, though, I'll open the bread up so that the buttered surfaces get a little crispy.

This was very easy to prepare and came out great. However, I thought it was a little heavy on the olive oil and did not have enough butter flavor when finished. In the future, I'll probably increase the butter by 1 Tbsp. and decrease the olive oil by the same amount.

Easy, and very tasty. Reminded me of my Mom's garlic bread.

I have several recipes for garlic bread/toast that I've made over the years, but my husband and I agree that this recipe is the very best. I don't change a thing, just rely on the wonderful baguettes our local Wegmans grocery provides and slavish the sauce on generously. It's wonderful.

Absolutely delicious.
