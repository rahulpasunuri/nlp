Delicious! Used Meyer Lemons and a Tahitian Vanilla bean, though the caramelized top overpowered the floral notes of the Tahitian bean a little.

This was a really simple recipe to prepare. Made a half batch and used zest from an entire lemon. I didn't do a good enough job watching the clock while I baked them so they got a little brown and frothy on top, but brulee-ing them covered that up no problem! I actually made this for a week night dinner with my best friend--following fajitas and a fresh corn salad. A quick, easy but elegant make-ahead dessert!

So elegant and easy! I made it for my husband for Valentine's Day dessert. He loves lemon flavored desserts and this fit the bill. Loved it!

This is the best creme brulee recipe I have used to date. The texture and and consistency were prefect and the lemon flavour was lovely. I made a half quantity, but used 2 tsps of lemon juice. It was wonderful and I will definitely make it again!

I used Meyer Lemons instead of regular lemons. And actually I even used three of them. I used the zest from all of the lemons and the juice from one entire lemon instead of one tablespoon. But for the rest I followed the recipe to a T, and it was fabulous, and I had rave reviews from all my guests. I will definitely serve this again, and again!

Simple and satisfying. I used Meyer lemons, erred on the generous side with the zest, and increased the lemon juice by about half. Even so, it was very subtle. I like a tart lemon flavor, so I'd probably add a lot more zest and/or juice next time. The texture is fairly soft - if you like your creme brulee firmer, increase the cooking time by a few minutes.

This is the second time I've made this. It's great but the second time I did with light cream--it made for a lighter dessert (not quite as overwhelming). I think I will stick with either light cream or a mix of heavy and light next time.

Very delicious. Made half batch of 4 dishes. Used one meyer lemon, grated the entire zest without measuring, used the specified amount of juice. Very nice flowerly lemon flavor.

I enjoyed the Cream Brulee, I've prepared it a half dozen time with in the past 3 months. I do have 1 concern with how they look after being removed from the oven, a few of the deserts have dimples and obviously moot points after youve torched them, LOL. I was curious as to why some have dimples and not all, my 1st guess was the oven was too hot, but I dont think thats it.

This was a wonderful dessert. It was very easy to make and I think the turbinado sugar is the secret to the topping--also the torch. I have made one with regular sugar under the broiler and it didn't work. Also made one using the torch with regular sugar--not as good. I'll definitely make it again.

This recipe is good. It came out creamy and smooth. The lemon flavor is just right. I will make this again, often. I have another lemon recipe, but this is much better.

Best creme brulee I've made so far, very very nice. Custard is light, delicious.

I halved the recipe and put the custard into shot glasses to serve as part of a dessert tasting plate. These would have to be the best creme brulee's I've ever had. The lemon flavour was subtle but added a nice and different taste than regular vanilla creme brulee. I thickened the custard on the stove and didn't bother with baking in the oven. I used half brown sugar and half white sugar in the custard and used caster sugar for the tops. Fantastic dessert!!

Delicious and simple to make; great for a summer desset on a slightly cool New England evening. Wouldn't change a thing. After chilling I let the ramekins come to room temp as I don't care for a warm crispy top and a cold center.

Amazingly easy recipe, got rave reviews. For the water bath, used a roasting pan lined with a kitchen towel and added warm water to it. Also used the broiler to caramelize the sugar since I did not have a torch, but cooled the cups in the refrigerator after that as they became warm.

After having creme brulee in restaurants I'm surprised how easy it is to make this great dessert. And the flavor and texture are way beyond what I've had in restaurants. Caramelizing the top under a broiler (I don't have a torch) is less than beautiful, but very satisfactory.

I made this for dessert for Valentine's Day dinner. I wanted something elegant but not as time consumptive as a cheesecake, which is one of my favorite desserts to make. Playing with a hot flame on Valentine's Day is a fun twist too! I thought this was excellent and had a perfect composition. I would definately make it again...I just hope it comes out exactly the same, 'cause it was THAT good.

Delicious and easy. Would definitely make again.

This was so easy to make and tasted great! I did not have a blow torch, but used the broiler instead and then cooled the ramekins for a few minutes in the fridge. My mother-in-law loved it so much she had seconds!

FANTASTIC!! The lemon sets off the heavy cream nicely. Creme brulee can be a bit on the custardy side, but this had a great texture and taste. We made it as a dessert for dinner guests but changed our minds, made something else and squirrled this away to enjoy ourselves. Needless to say, we ate every ounce over four nights and enjoyed all of it.

Made this receipe for Easter. It went over very well and I was pleased. Texture was on the soft side and delicious. We had fun with the blow torch with everyone offering suggestions on how close to get to the sugar. I think the closer the better

Made just one sub to this recipe, I added a fresh split vanilla bean to the heavy cream and once the simmer began I removed the bean and scrapped the seeds into the cream - I then of course did not add more liquid vanilla later - Delicious.

I made this exactly following the recipe and served at a dinner party for 8. Everyone raved about it and I can't understandteh previous comments becasue it was very lemony - not much of a creme brulee taste'texture, but fabulous none the less. One guest went into the kitchen herself and served herself a second piece!

Simple solution- throw out the lemons

I made this recipe using lime zest instead of lemon. Great flavor, although maybe could be stronger. The reason I said I wouldn't make it again is because I felt the custard wasn't quite thick enough- I like my creme brulee very thick and creamy.

Served to eight guests - who all finished their portions. I agree with another perons - this needs more lemon flavor!

Lovely, creamy creme brulee. Was liked by all. Will definitely make again. The only thing I might do differently is add some lemon oil to heighten the lemon flavor. That's not to say it wasn't lemony, as it was. I'm just a huge fan of citrus flavor and wish there had been a little more of a lemony zing.
