Very delicious and easy. I used only 1 Tbsp of butter instead of 3 Tbsp and it was fine. I'm sure it would have been even more delicious with 3 Tbsp but still great. I will definitely be making this again.

fantastic--perfect as is. great to jazz up potatoes for guests/dinner party. make more than you think you will need because they go fast!

I thought these were tasty, but for the amount of butter and sour cream in them, I thought they were surprisingly dry. It could have been my potatoes, though (I used Russet potatoes, next time I'll try Yukon Gold).

Yum! Yum! Can't get any more "comfort food" than this! Pairs wonderfully with the herbed rib roast, also on this site.

This was so easy and so good! Although I didn't put in quite as much horseradish or sour cream. I served it with sirloin with red wine sauce and my guests loved it.

I served this for Thanksgiving and like previous poster, added a little cream. The cream softened the tartness of the sour cream just a bit. These were a great hit!

This was wonderful! I will make this again and I won't change a thing.

I made these potatoes for this Thanksgiving and they were fantastic! We made them with light sour cream and extra horseradish. I had to add some extra milk and a little heavy cream just prior to serving since I made them several hours ahead of time and they were starting to dry out a little bit. Everyone went nuts for them and they reminded my husband of the potatoes he'd had in Chicago at Wildfire Grill.

This dish was awesome. I was asked to make steakhouse mashed potatos for dinner and these surpassed expectations. The horseradish gave it that bite that you dont get with traditional mashed potatos.

This was a big hit at Thanksgiving. I added a bit more horeseradish than called for, since our group loves horseradish. I served a mashed potato "bar" with four different potato selections, served with ice cream scoops. This was the favorite one!

We like horseradish with roast beef, so when I made a sirloin tip roast last night, I decided to try this recipe. It was a big hit with both my husband & myself!
