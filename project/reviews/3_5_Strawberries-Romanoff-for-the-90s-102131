The sauce was outstanding, the whole recipe was very easy. I think just using the sauce over vanilla ice cream would be equally delicious.

Excellent light refreshing summer desert. A great "do ahead" recipe for a party.

Sensational recipe for any strawberry-lovers! This dessert is wonderfully light-tasting and flavorful. I made it with Edy's reduced fat ice cream and you couldn't tell the difference. Perfect after a heavy meal.

This was a cool summer treat. The raspberries intensified the flavor of the strawberries.

I just made the berry sauce and served it over ice cream. She loved it! Leftover sauce froze well and I'm still eating it. Yum.
