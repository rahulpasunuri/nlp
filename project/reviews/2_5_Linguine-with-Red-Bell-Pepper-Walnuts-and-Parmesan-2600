My husband and I liked this dish a lot. I didn't have time to let the peppers sit for 2 hours, but it was fine. Next time I'll also use less olive oil -- a little too slick. I toasted the walnuts, and that was a good tip.

This is one of my favorite pasta recipes. I don't see how anyone could say this has no flavor. The only variation I did was toast the chopped walnuts at 350 degrees in the oven until nicely browned before adding them to the pasta dish. Toasting the nuts gives them a mucher richer flavor. This dish is light and delicious. Perfect for a summer supper!

This should be good, but is completely boring. You might as well eat pasta with sauteed onions, because that's all you're going to taste. Blah.

I modified it using 4 heads of roasted garlic instead of fresh and pine nuts instead of walnuts. The result was a creamy, flavorful "sauce" with lots of flavor. Perfect summer dish -- light but satisfying.
