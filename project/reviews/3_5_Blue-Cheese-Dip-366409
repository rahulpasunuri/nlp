Really delicious dip - a keeper for a quick, sophisticated veggie/pretzel dip. A couple of things to note: I didn't make the full recipe - there were only 4 of us, but i used the same proportions, except I still used one garlic clove. It wasn't too garlicky - in fact, it was just right. I used a mortar and pestle l to create the garlic/salt paste, and i used very, very strong blue cheese (so i used less than called for). The thyme I used was the lemon thyme in my garden (still growing under snow!). Really great. We practically licked the bowl clean.

Smoked blue cheese is not available at my grocery so used regular Saga blue cheese to make this very tasty dip. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly and all my guests loved it. It was equally delicious as a dip for veggies and a spread for toasted baguette slices. As mentioned by others, recipe as written does make a large quantity. I will definitely make this again.

This is a fantastic blue cheese dip. I have several go-to recipes but this is the new favorite. When I can't find smoked blue cheese I use smoked sea salt when mashing the garlic and for final seasoning. Makes a big flavor difference.

A good, handy blue cheese dip but not superb. I used regular blue cheese, not smoked. Perhaps that would have made a difference.

AMAZING!!! All my guests LOVED THIS! Used regular blue cheese. I will definitely make this again. Great for dipping any veggies or pretzels or pita chips into!

Just made this dip for a summer bbq. I agree that one should not rate a recipe if the recipe isn't properly followed. There's a reviewer that used "expensive" blue cheese, and gave this recipe a somewhat poor rating. I might attribute that reviewers' dissatisfaction with the cheese they selected, and not the recipe itself. I followed the recipe exactly, and the dip is perfect (if you like blue cheese!).

Yummy recipe. I liked it better as an accompaniment to a nice, juicy steak!

Yum! This was sublime. The leftovers are in my fridge and it's taking every bit of willpower I have not to sneak another bite. I don't think it is too much for veggies, but agree with previous reviewer that it would be fabulous with steak!

This was a big hit for the 4th of July. Its very easy and YUMMY. Despite a pretty fg phenomenal cheese section in Rainbow, I couldnt find smoked bleu... Point Reyes Orig Blue rocked, though, and I dont think Ill bother to look for smoked when I make this again tomorrow. The recipe makes a LOT  theyre not kidding re: the yield - so if youre not potlucking or something,1/4 to 1/3 batch is plenty for 2 to 4 people as an app with veggies.

I agree that you should start off making this as written, from there improvise as desired. This is a very nice Blue Cheese dip,I typically use just the regular crumbled blue but occasionally spring for the roquefort...talk about amazing...it's so creamy and smooth. Anyway, If you love blue cheese you will love this dip. Goes great with veggies as well as triscuits. Oh, and make sure you have your recipe handy because everytime you serve this dip you will have multiple requests for the recipe!

This is a good recipe, just use the ingredients given. I made it and it was very good and there was not a bit of it left. If you cant make the dish the way it is given, dont give it a bad rating when it doesnt turn out right.

Made 1/2 recipe but used full garlic. Couldn't find smoked blue, so used expensive blue that was recc. WAY TOO BLUE! Even my husband who likes full blown blue cheese dishes, said it was too strong for the veggies...suggested maybe more suitable for steaks. I then doubled the sour cream and mayo and it is bearable, but still not a favorite..I think it needs something to bring the blue flavor in check.
