Very pretty, particularly with a sprinkle of chopped parsley, but didn't taste like anything other than buttered potatoes.

Only okay

I liked it. I used baby red potatoes, and more saffron. A little salt to my personal taste, but none to the dish as a whole. We both enjoyed it, and they were beautiful. Used as a side to morroccan seasoned lamb chops.

Simple and delicious. Used only half the butter, and a bit of extra saffron. Didn't need salt at the end. Great with veal rib chops with caramelized fennel on this site.

This has been a standard for a few years, now. I've found that it works well as a base recipe. From there, I can roast the potatos - which I usually do simply to make life easy. I use Swanson's low sodium broth and no salt whatsoever. A few grinds of black pepper, more saffron, which I've ground with the back of a spoon, and garnish with parsley. Easy, elegant, and tasty. Had lots of compliments.

These potatoes were beautiful but not as flavorful as I'd hoped. (I made these as a side for the veal chops with figs and fennel.) Neither the flavor of the saffron nor the potatoes themselves seemed to come across--they were just very buttery.

The flavor was good, but I found the method not worth it. Some potatoes got a little mealy while all the liquid was not absorbed.

I followed the recipe exactly and both my husband and I found these potatoes utterly boring. The only good thing to be said about them was they looked nice.

Very nice, subtle flavor. Also works well using red new potatoes. I've made this dish many times and it works well as an accompaniment with just about anything...chicken, pork chops, lamb. Excellent recipe.

Very Tender. My family loved it.
