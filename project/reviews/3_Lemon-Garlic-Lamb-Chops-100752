I added a T. of Oregano and it added another dimension of flavor to this dish that was just what it needed.

I spiced this one up a bit, deglazed the pan with red wine that I always have on hand and added some fresh herbs or magic dust :) Yes do double the sauce

I haven't tried the recipe because your site has not been functional for weeks. Whatever recipe appears on screen, the only recipe that prints is Blue Cheese & Walnut Toasts. It has been like this for 2-3 weeks -- please get it fixed!!!!

We love lamb and this was very, very good. I doubled the recipe for the sauce. Served it with jasmine rice and edamane fixed with garlic salt and sour cream. We would make it again. Very simple and fast! Perfect for the working lady of the house!

This was an okay recipe (quick, easy, and made with ingredients you're likely to have on hand) but nothing spectacular. I doubled the sauce as suggested by other reviewers. My husband liked the flavor combination.

Very good if you like lamb. No fat taste with these chops. The only thing I didn't like was the splattering on the stove. Next time I'll do them on the grill.

It was okay, but nothing spectacular. I agree, the recipe doesn't make enough sauce, and that might have helped. Altogether, a nice meal, but nothing I'm going to treasure in my recipe box.

We really liked this recipe. The lemon with the lamb was fabulous! This really isn't enough sauce so I doubled the amount and it was just about right.
