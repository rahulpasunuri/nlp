Makes 24 NOT 36. A good substitution for the fresh chorizo if you live somewhere it is difficult to find is http://www.sausagemania.com/recipes2.html

I took these to a small New Year's Eve gathering and they were well-received. I used regular muffin pans and made just 12. I had to drain the chorizo - too greasy! I skipped the water and substituted chopped soaked sun dried tomatoes instead of tomato paste. I piled them with salsa, avocado and cilantro, they were beautiful and yummy.

I bought the bite sized cups for these so it made this recipe even faster. I sauted two chopped tomatoes with some lemon and a little bit of pepper. While it was warming up, I chopped the Colombian chorizo and the avocado. Then mixed the chorizo into the pan. Warmed up the cups in the microwave so they would be more tender. Served it with the cilantro and it was a beauty! Everybody loved it.

These were a huge hit at our friends' Mexican Christmas dinner. I used mini tart pans, which made nice bite-sized chalupas. I also make my own chorizo with an old "Frugal Gourmet" recipe - much better than store bought. This is a perfect make ahead dish... we just nuked the filling and filled the pre- baked shells once we got to the party.

I wanted to make these since they appeared in the Dec. issue and went for it for a New Year's Eve Party. They were a big disappointment. The dough was so easy to work with, and the chorizo filling came together easy enough, but the end result was bad. I filled half the cups and threw the rest away--will save the chorizo mixture for eggs as the previous reviewer suggested.

These were a crowd pleaser and easy to make. I didn't have mini cupcake tins so I used a regular sized cupcake pan, which worked just fine. Plus, there was a bit of leftover chorizo, which made for an excellent egg scramble the next day.
