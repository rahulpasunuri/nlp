I have made this beautiful tart for many Passovers since the recipe appeared, and everyone loves it. This year I used balsamic in place of the brandy - brilliant! It added a wonderful new layer of flavor to the filling. It was hard not to eat it by the spoonful!

I have only made the crust from this recipe but it is very versatile. One year for Passover I filled it with lemon curd and topped with a variety of berries to make a fruit tart. This year I filled the crust with a layer of dulce de leche and a layer of flourless chocolate filling. Everyone really loved it and the nut crust went well with the dulce de leche and chocolate.

I made this for passover. I used Splenda and kiwi and strawberry slices in concentric circles with raspberries in the centre. I had barely enough dough to cover my flan pan and kept my hands moist to press it in, otherwise fine. A very pretty presentation. Just remember not to assemble it too early or the crust will become too soft.

I have made this every year since it was published for passover. This year I experimented with replacing Splenda and it worked very well.

I had a lot of trouble with this one. Part of it was my own fault for not properly grinding the nuts but that made my crust too thick and overpowering. The strawberry filling never really set and although the cake looked great, it fell apart when I tried to serve it. Rather disappointing.

The best part of this tart is the crust, which I decided to turn into a recipe for Passover chocolate chip cookies. I just added some semisweet chips to the batter and then formed small patties (the cookies don't expand much in the oven) - they were so good, I would make them year-round.

Everyone raved about desert. I wish I could include a picture with this review. The tart was beautiful. I sliced the strawberries into rounds for the top and alternated with kiwi rounds. I filled the little strawberry holes with frozen blueberries. Anyway, I cooked the filling about 25-30 minutes. After it cooled, I refrigerated it for a day. It was very thick so, I had no problems with leaks. I made the crust with toasted hazelnuts but any skins that didn't easily come off I left on. I ground the nuts in a coffee grinder before processing and found the crust VERY easy to work with and didn't need to moisten my hands much to press it in. (Believe it or not, my biggest challenge was putting foil in the tart pan!) I made the tart in a 10" pan and did have the extra 1/2 cup as in the recipe which was no problem cause the dough is SO yummy!

I have made this recipe for the past 2 years for my seder, and I think it is fantastic! I used blanched toasted almonds instead of hazelnuts (easier to find when pressed for time), and I did not find the nut crust difficult to work with -- the trick is to keep your hands wet. I used an 8" tart pan and there was no dough leftover. The filling did take a bit longer than the recommended time, as another cook mentioned, but it thickened up nicely as it cooled. I layered kiwi and strawberries on the top this year for a pretty variation.

I am an experienced baker and I found this recipe to be too much effort for the end result. The crust is difficult to work with (as are many nut crusts) and lining the tart pan with foil is a nuisance. The strawberry filling needs to boil for much longer than the suggested 18 minutes to achieve the correct consistency. I also found that once the pie is assembled, the filling tends to leak, therefore making the crust soggy. There are many more and better recipes to spend my time on. I will not make this tart again.

Not great. There are many other better Passover recipes.

This tasted and looked great. All our guests were impressed. Only problem I encountered was the local supermarkets sold the strawberries in 1 pound boxes, and neither the salespeople there, my county extension office, or the strawberry company themselves were able to convert the pound package into pint baskets and 12 ounce baskets. In spite of my 'winging' the amount of strawberries, it was a success.

This tart is delicious, gorgeous, and easy! I made the filling ahead of time but got crunched for time the night of the seder--so instead of cooling the crust at room temperature, I stuck it in the freezer for 15 mins, foil and all, which worked like a charm. Absolute rave reviews from the eaters!!

When this recipe first appeared in 1992, I offered to make dessert for the seder dinner we always celebrate with dear friends of the Jewish faith. When it was served, every guest loved it!! They finally explained that although some Passover desserts look good, they all taste poorly. This tart has become a tradition which I am forbidden to change and which we all look forward to! Thank you PS My husband and I cook a lot and have had recipes featured in national cookbooks.

I modified this recipe quite a bit, but it was a great base to start from. I used frozen blueberries instead of strawberries, sherry instead of brandy and mixed fruit on the top (kiwi, strawberries, sour cherries and mango.) I also cut the amount of sugar in the crust by half and used unhulled hazelnuts. I also drizzled a very small amount of chocolate sauce on the top. This was a big hit for a seder desert.

I've used this recipe several times and it's always a winner. As long as you remember to make the filling sauce thick enough, it's fabulous. (If the sauce is too thin, it runs and leaks through the macaroon shell - a mess! Tasty, but a mess!) It's a great recipe at any time of the year, but it's an especially good dessert for Passover, when most desserts leave a lot to be desired. It's relatively easy to make, and it looks and tastes dynamite! Highly recommended.
