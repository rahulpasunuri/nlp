This review is only for the sauce. The sauce was delicious over our crepes! I used Rainer cherries that I previously frozen and 1/4 cup sugar instead of what was stated. Will make again!

Got rave reviews when I made this as a variation on a theme of black forest cake. Therefore I made the cherry sauce as well, unlike a lot of the reviews here. I don't know what people are talking about with the "sugar overkill"; there's only 3/4 cup for both recipes combined. I used the fresh cherries in the store and then loaded the pitted halves into both cup measures instead of getting frozen pitted cherries. The cherry flavor was wonderful, and far from overly sweet. My advice would be to make double the amount, because I guess they cooked down more than I thought and I ran out halfway through serving the marquise! I had some trouble with the eggs since I don't have a real double boiler, and I had trouble reaching the correct temperature; meanwhile my liquid was steaming away, so my eggs were a little scant, so I think this led to my finished product being a little crumbly. The taste was still wonderful, though, and I will definitely make it again. I missed the step involving the aluminum foil, so I had some fun trying to remove it from the pan; mom had a great idea using a hair dryer on the inverted pan, which totally saved the day. I then rewrapped it in the foil and remolded it for the next hour in the fridge. If you have enough slack, and you grab enough surface area all at the same time, the foil WILL come free from the pan. Or you can use a hair dryer!

This dessert really impresses the palette. I followed the advice of another reviewer and simply made a creme anglais and sprinkled a few raspberries across the top when serving. At least four guests asked for the recipe. Just know before you start that this takes time and diligence. I was in the process of making a few other dishes, and I had to stop everything to concentrate on this. My marquise did not set as expected; I suspect it was my boyfriend's doing when he set the fridge to a lower temperature. However, I highly suggest making this a day or two ahead. This will ensure that it sets correctly and that you will have enough time for your other dishes.

I made the cherry sauce. I didn't have the kirsch. I added some almond extract to substitute. It was excellent on top of vanilla ice cream garnished with shaved dark chocolate. Next time I will make the Marquise as well.

Delicious, indulgent, silky...um...did I mention delicious? ;-) I served it with creme anglais and a blackberry coulis, and have even adjusted the liquid proportions and added coffee liqueur to make a really special filling for a birthday cake. A luxurious dessert :- )

I've made this a bunch of times-- everyone loves it. I use unsweeted whipped cream rather than cherrysauce topping. Careful with the egg part which I overcooked one time--nasty results. non-glass loaf pan works fine.

excellent, impressive presentation and not difficult to make. High quality chocolate flavor comes through.

Has anyone tried to make this in a silicone loaf pan?

Warning!I've made this probably 10 times, but I've ruined it twice because this is a dish that needs your full attention. Not difficult, just follow directions exactly. Do not bother making this if you do not have the candy thermometer. And I use plastic wrap in place of what it calls for. It's a sinfully rich,but not too sweet awesome, memorable dessert for sure!

I just made the sauce and served it over slices of the Chocolate Whiskey Bundt Cake, also from Epicurious. The Whiskey Bundt Cake is not too sweet, they were a perfect match. The sauce was excellent.

Yes on the chocolate marquise, no on the cherry sauce. Both were tasty on their own but when combined together the two became sugar overkill. The flavor of the sauce is pretty much clobbered by the intensely dark chocolate of the marquise (yum! -- almost like eating whipped dark fudge). The sauce would do well partnered with something less potent so that it can shine (in crepes perhaps). No one wanted the cherry sauce in my first serving attempt. The second time I made the recipe, it was the winner. I made the marquise as the recipe states (increasing it to 1.5 times the stated recipe and using a glass square pan for a larger dinner party). I followed other reviewers' advice and lined the pan with parchment paper and much spray coating (both between the parchment paper and the pan to adhere it easily and onto the parchment paper before the marquise got poured into it -- it unmolded beautifully with zero stress). Instead of making the cherry sauce, I paired it with some additional freshly whipped cream (which I laced with brandy and the tiniest amount of sugar... barely sweetened) served on the side alongside fresh raspberries. The tang of the unsweetened raspberries and the creaminess of the barely sweet whipped cream were very popular counterparts to the rich deep sweetness of the chocolate "cake." This is definitely a mousse cake for chocolate lovers.

YUM!!!! I made this for Christmas dinner and all of us LOVED it!! It was definitely worth the effort. As suggested, I used waxed paper instead of foil, used cooking spray on both the loaf pan and the paper, and it came out without any trouble. I couldn't find fresh cherries in Colorado in December, so I used canned. It was okay, but a little overally sweet and didn't have the bite I had expected from the cherry sauce. I will try frozen in the future. Overall, though, really awesome!!

Ohmygosh, me and my hubby just loved this dish. It reminded me of a wonderful, rich and creamy desert we had specially made to our likings while visiting the Swiss Alps. That one was better of course, but this was still great. Since I've recipes from this site, it's really improved my love life. Thanks!

I have made this twice and it was a great hit both times. While it is a bit cumbersome to make, the results and raves are worth it. Several reviewers have mentioned the difficulty with the foil. I have sprayed a glass loaf pan lightly with cooking spray before lining with the foil and it comes right out.

This recipe could have used some editing. First of all, buttering the glass loaf dish only makes the foil stick to the pan when refrigerated. I would also be inclined to add all of the sugar to the yolk, water and butter mixture. The sugar mixed with the butter and cocoa powder did not dissolve - resulting in a little crystals in the Marquise. That said, the guests loved it and it was convenient to be able to make the dessert the day before the party.

This is just a half review as I made just the cherry sauce. Served it over some good vanilla ice cream for a nice summer dessert.

Like eating a delicious truffle. The only problem was with the foil lined pan. The foil was hard to remove from the pan and tore easily. Perhaps waxed paper or parchment paper would solve the problem

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe considering the amount of work that went into it, and the number of bowls required (4). It was ok, but nothing special.

Be sure to read full recipe before starting. I had four bowls going at once and all ingredients on hand, which made it go rather smoothly. Used Hershey's cocoa instead, which worked fine. Used cherries, lots of vanilla and a little brown sugar for cherry sauce (simpler and very good). Great chocolate lover's dessert! I used 8 oz semi-sweet along with 2 oz 99% dark chocolate and it was delicious.
