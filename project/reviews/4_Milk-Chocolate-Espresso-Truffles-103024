These are very well-liked as holiday gifts, and I just had a client make a special request to get some of these again this year! Her husband just loves them. They are easy (EASY!) to make and fool proof.

I have made these many times and they are always wonderful. It is also an easy and basic truffle recipe which can be used and othe liquids like grand manier can be substituted for the Kahlua or even espresso for many different tastes.

These are delicious! The bf and everyone at work devoured them. I rolled mine in a mixture of cocoa powder and cinnamon mmmmm. When I first melted the chocolate and cream I was a little scared because it looked grainy like the fat was separating, but as soon as I added the kalhua it tightened up nicely and looked like beautiful glossy chocolate. There a mess to make but really fun! Enjoy!

These tasted great! Would definately make them again. Give yourself time the first time you make them. And make them small. I made my truffles way too big, they have a stong taste, so make sure you dont make them large.

Outstanding and easy to make

Great recipe. I have made them a few times and everyone has loved them. I have made these with a few variations, including a hazelnut inside and toasted coconut on the outside. They will disappear very quickly!

OMG this recipe was amazing! It has become one of my trademark recipes for desserts. I initially made them for gifts for teachers at school for Christmas but after taste-testing one at home I just had to have more for myself and my family! I changed my idea of dividing the batch just for the teachers to allow for me to keep some. All of the people who received them as gifts begged for the recipe and said they were absolutely delicious! I agree whole-heartedly!

Outstanding recipe. These are simply divine, and very easy to make. I did not change anything about these -- I think they are perfect as is. Use a good quality milk chocolate.

I brought these to share at work and they were such a hit that other departments even found them at my desk. Good news travels fast!!!! Enjoy and share.

I made these as a Valentine's present for my boyfriend. I used Trader Joe's 'pound plus' chocolate and Cadbury cocoa. He liked the ones I rolled in toasted almonds best. I think they need a little texture like that. Next time I will make them smaller (I used about 2 tsp. per), they are very rich! And very messy to roll...they melt fast. I think I'll try a variety of coarse sugar, nuts, fancy sprinkles...yummy!

I lost the recipe and was so glad to find it here! I have made these two Christmas' in a row and they are always a hit! They are really messy to make though, so I made a few changes. I use instant french vanilla coffee and rum instead of Kahlua. I also make them in candy molds with some candy melts--that way you get the hard outer shell and the gooey inside.

So fabulous! I've made these a few times and everyone raves! I roll them sort of small and do a chocolate plate, with coated strawberries and dipped shortbread. Lovely, as mentioned, with a glass of champagne.

Loved these. I did, however use Callebaut semisweet chunks instead of milk chocolate. I then rolled them in raw sugar.(The coarse, beautiful stuff!). They were amazing both in taste and presentation. Served with fresh strawberries and champagne....heaven!

They were superb! I rolled some of them in finely chopped toasted almonds.

Awesome! Even my boyfriend, who is not into sweets or chocolate, kept popping these into his mouth. I did not alter the recipe at all and used Ghirardelli cocoa powder and valhrona chocolate.

Incredibly easy to make! Some said they were a bit sweet, and the cocoa can be a bit much; but if you roll the truffles in cinnamon or nutmeg/sugar, that makes for a nice change.

Delicious and easy. My 12yr. old son liked it so much, he learned how to make it himself!

Very good truffles. I substitued espresso for the Kahlua. We served these along with other flavored truffles at a wedding reception.

I don't need to carry truffles from Europe any more! Now I can make my own, Ay coffee liquor works. I used Crema de Cafe from Colombia.

I used brandy instead of Kahlua. The taste was wonderful, but the work involved was too much. It was also very messy. I tucked a macadamia nut into some of the balls and rolled those in coconut. They were delicious, but I wouldn't make them again because of the work involved.

These truffles were wonderful!! They only lasted 2 days at my house. One thing I changed was that I rolled them in cocoa powder mixed with a little powdered sugar.
