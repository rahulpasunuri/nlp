I made this for my husband and I and it is really good. Pretty simple to make too. I beat the egg a little before putting in with the greens. I used 1/4 teaspoon of anchovy paste and could have used more. For the blue cheese I used crumbled gorgonzola. I didn't make the croutons.

I'm all for adapting classics and I love blue cheese, but I thought this was a bit heavy handed for a salad (egg, anchovy, parmesan, blue cheese...???) I may try omitting the egg next time and just lightly sprinkle a bit of blue cheese on top instead of adding to the dressing. We'll see! That said, my spouse really enjoyed it.

I made this last night, loved it, had leftovers for lunch today, and still loved it! I omitted the anchovy and the egg (didn't have them) and added fresh chopped tomatoes and mushrooms (trying to up my veggie intake). Delicious!

I have made this quite a few times. It's the best caesar recipe that I have found, and I get many requests for the recipe.

I have made this salad 5 times since I found the recipe 2 months ago. It is always a hit and a fresh spin on a classic caesar.

I got some high quality blue cheese and WOW. Excellent flavor, but I will use a little less cheese next time. Should definitely be served with white wine.

Absolutely the best! We used garlic salt on the croutons and added fresh mushroom slices. Next time we'll try it without the egg, as we'd like it a bit drier. The sauce would make a great veggie dip!

One of my favorite restaurants makes a salad called "Black and Blue Caesar" which is this salad topped with strips of grilled rare sirloin. The combination of flavors is amazing. The salad is wonderful on its own, but try it with steak - a carnivore's delight. (PS - I'm not the same reviewer as below from East Lansing, but we apparently like blue cheese and Caesars around here!)

Wonderful. This is a fine restaurant quality Salad! Very easy to make. I used anchovy paste instead of anchovy. It saved opening a whole can of anchovies just for one. I made it for Christmas Dinner and am making again tonight for New Years Eve. Going to make it for my next Dinner party too! Happy New Year

I don't usually like recipies that tamper with the classics, but this is an exception. Use the best ingredients you can find, and it's wonderful. Will satisfy the soul and ward off vampires at the same time.

This is a great and easy recipe for people looking for a refeshing caesar salad dressing - lots of flavor. Definately do it again!
