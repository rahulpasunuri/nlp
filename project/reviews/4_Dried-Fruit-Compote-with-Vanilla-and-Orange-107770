Hmmm...not sure I know what all the fuss is about. I was afraid it was going to be a bit like stewed prunes and....it was. I only gave it three forks because my guests enjoyed it...or were they just being nice?

This is very similar to a traditional Polish Christmas-Eve dessert. I added a few dried peaches and pears to the fruit mixture and it was GOOD. I only added 2 T. sugar to the syrup, too sweet otherwise. This recipe is better the next day, served slightly-chilled or room temperature.

This was a very nice change from heavier and more elaborate desserts. It even tasted better the next day,cold, straight from the fridge. The only thing I'll change next time is the amount of sugar - I did find the syrup a tad bit too sweet, otherwsie it was great!

I thought this was really outstanding. The syrup is absolutely delicious, and the fruit is wonderful. The figs, in particular, are super-rich. I topped with low-fat yogurt mixed with honey. I'd definitely make again.
