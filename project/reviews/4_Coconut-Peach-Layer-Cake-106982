I made this cake for my dad's birthday and it was a big hit! Everyone loved it! It took about 4 hours to make in total. I followed the recipe exactly except I did add gelatin to the icing. The icing was still a little runny so I'm sure it would've been much worse without the gelatin. I definitely recommend doing that. Also, I refrigerated the cakes so the icing did not melt at all. The cakes were a dense put the fruit was heavy so a dense cake help it to hold up well. I did not make the cake 4 layers, I used 3 8 inch pans & that also helped the cake to not be flimsy or crumbly. I saved the juice that was drained off the fruit & drizzled it over the cake which was great for such a dense cake. I can't wait to make this cake again with different fruit. I will try it with cake flour to see how it works but I did like the dense cake for the big pieces of fruit. Oh, and if you keep it in the fridge for a couple hours before serving, it holds up much better & cuts easier. This was a fantastic recipe & I will take the time to make it again for sure!

4 forks with my revisions. Always heeding advice from experienced bakers, I made the following revisions. What resulted was a moist, tender, delicious cake that rose nicely and was perfect to frost. Cake flour instead of regular 2t baking powder 1 C buttermilk NO sour cream 11/2 c sugar 3/4 Coco Real (cream of coconut) 1t. Vanilla 2t. Coconut Sometimes I add chopped coconut to the batter. Like to know what you think. I don't think it gets any better.

Made this last weekend for a birthday party. It was wonderful. I took the advice of several reviewers and increased the baking powder to 2 tsp. and I cut the peaches into chunks . Also I used 3 nine-inch pans to eliminate having to cut the layers. The cake was VERY dense and barely rose at all, but was tasty all the same. Only advice I would add is to serve the cake at near to room temperature. It was much better after it had sat out.

I've been making this for 8 years, everyone loves it & it is constantly requested. But it is a serious labor of love. 5+ hours since I refridgerate in-between stacking the layers. This helps the cake stabilize. I've made it as a trifle... much less work plus how many times do you get to use your trifle bowl, really. You can substitute chocolate(bittersweet to cut some of the sweetness of the cake) for the peaches also! & serve it in the winter. You do want to make sure your Baking Powder is fresh or you wont be able to make 4 layers.

This cake is one of my favorites: a never fail that has a wonderful texture and taste. I have always used fresh sliced peaches in the center, gently macerated with sugar for the filling. I plan on using it as a strawberry shortcake this weekend- very versatile cake, top and fill with any seasonal fruit, and you have a winner. I omit the coconut sometimes on the sides.

I'm reviewing only the cake, which I baked in a single Bundt pan (about 1 hour 10 minutes), like a pound cake. Dense, moist, rich (don't even want to think about the fat content), yummy! Served it in slices topped with peach compote and plain whipped cream.

Although this cake was a hit with my entire party when I made it, I felt like the cake layers were too dense. I would give substituting cake flour a try next time I make it. I would also prefer a buttercream instead but that's just my personal preferrence, nothing wrong with whipped cream! It would hold up better for those who need it to sit out a while.

Fun! I used canned coconut milk and it came out well. Also tried to make it a little healthier and did only 1/2c butter and added crushed peaches to make up the remainder. Also did a lighter icing - powder sugar, coconut milk and coconut - heated and then spread over.

This cake is unbelievably moist, and the flavors are amazing. I used apricots instead of peaches, which worked out really nicely. It was even better the next day, somehow... like the coconut flavor intensified. Overall, this is a fabulous-tasting and very impressive cake to bring to a celebration.

I've been making this cake for 6 years. except not toasting the coconut, I have made it as a trifle also (much easier to transport). People love this cake. I get requests for it for every party. It's labor intensive but worth every second.

This tasted wonderful - however, despite chilling everything well and stabilizing the cream, my layers were awfully slippy. The coconut helped the overall presentation somewhat, but it ended up being pretty slumped. When I halved the layers (with dental floss, as recommended!) they cut perfectly but broke when I tried to separate them. This added to my cake's slouching problem. All this aside, this was a rich and delicious cake. I really like the idea a previous reviewer posted of serving it as a trifle. I think that will be my next strategy. No matter how you serve it, be prepared for a lot of work to complete this yummy dessert.

Wow. If you take your time the cake is easy. I froze the cake to tranport it to a party an hour away. It did not toally defrost, but it was easy to cut and was devoured!!. May try it as a trifel next time It does get a little messy to assemble. My dog was covered in coconut!

Instead of cream of coconut, I used the hardened block of coconut cream that needs to be reconstituted with a bot of hot water (can be found in the ethnic aisle of your supermarket) It works amazingly well. And yes, this is an incredible cake. To help with the sliding the first time I made it, after assembling the layers, I wrapped wax paper around the whole cake (like a collar) kept it closed with toothpicks, and put it back in the fridge until it had a solid shape. Then I finished the icing. I was able to rescue it at the last minute.

Very pretty cake, but it take a lot of time and makes a gigantic mess in your kitchen. Does anybody have any suggestions on how to use something other than cream of coconut? The cake comes out yummy, but I just think the cream of coconut is so gross and artificial that the cake would be even yummier with a real, non corn-syrupy ingredient. I stabilized the whipped cream as per suggestions with some gelatin. I needed more whipped cream than the recipe called for and next time I will cut the peaches into smaller slides. I used frozen peaches, and a fresh peach on top since it isn't peach season quite yet and the frozen peaches were super easy. You only need about 2 pounds of them, not three. I used the dental floss technique to cut the cake, which worked wonderfully. The cake came out heavier than most cakes, but lighter than a pound cake, I think some people might have had a hard time with the cake because they didn't properly cream the butter and sugar or beat the egg whites enough. Also, you should wait until the cake is completely cook before you start to assemble it, that might be why so many people had melting problems. To get the coconut on the cake, I threw it on, which was fun but messy. When you get it onto your cake plate, tuck a few sheets of wax paper underneath the sides so you can remove it when you're done. I decorated the cake with a cut peach, a cut flower and mint sprigs. It was beautiful!

Quite a bit of work but worth it in the end. I followed the suggestions to substitute cake flour & add stabilizer to the whipped cream. Peaches were out of season so I substituted with layers of raspberries & raspberry preserves. The presentation was beautiful, so much so that everyone waited in line for cake & ignored the brownies that I had also prepared. For me the cake was a bit on the dense side but one of my guests said that was exactly what made the cake a winner for him. Regardless, the taste was great & I would definitely make it again for a special occasion.

I have made this recipe a few times and everyone gets excited to hear it is on the menu. Made it with frozen peaches in a pinch and turns out just fine. The key to evenly sliced cakes is a small cut around the cake and a piece of dental floss - no leaning towers of Pisa...this is by far one of the best cakes I have made -and everyone LOVES it!

I had to used jarred peaches as they were out of season when I made this cake. I was prepared for this to be a complete disaster, because I did everything the wrong way. The frosting even began to curdle while I was spreading it on (eek!). Thankfully, the toasted coconut SAVED the presentation. It went from being quite sad and droopy to looking almost like the picture. It was difficult to cut and basically had to be served with a spoon, it's also incredibly rich so more than a few people just picked out the peaches and ate them separately before attacking the cake. All in all, very tasty and not the total failure I had predicted it would be.

This cake was excellent,served at a party and everyone loved it. I also used cake flour and did not adjust it. I made the cake and froze it a week ahead and finished it the day before the party. I purchased a whip cream stabilizer from Bakers cataloge and it kept the whip cream nice. Had several pieces 0f cake left over and itwas stir beautiful to look at and eat, the next day. I bought jar peaches at a specialty store and they worked great,they tasted like fresh peaches

OK - just had our first piece of this cake - made the PRETTIEST cake we've ever seen. Prepped the toasted coconut & the peach layer the day before & took note of aforementioned posts & so incorporated the following: 1. used cake flour instead of all-purpose & did not correctw/additional flour; 2.drained the peach mixture well & added 1/2t almond extract to the peach mixture; 3. stabilized the whipped cream w/1t gelatin to 4c whipping cream (yeah, had some leftover but hey, it's my b-day). Layers were done at 35 min (per toothpick) & were not dry. Used dental floss rec to cut the layers - worked like a charm! Layered cake with well-chilled components & chilled cake in fridge 1+ hrs before cutting - no sliding! Had great fun w/DH, throwing little handfuls of toasted coconut onto the sides of frosted cake - patting seemed to pull off frosting - almost food fight antics. Will make again - think mango &/or pineapple would be good as well.

I made this cake for the first time a few years ago and it was really good. I made it again yesterday with more culinary experience under my belt and it was unbelievable. It helps to understand the processes of making it - there are several instances where the step's purpose is to incorporate air into the batter which will eliminate all denseness. This cake topped off a meal of crab legs and ribeyes, and it still left everyone speechless. I like to cut my peaches into thinner slices and make sure to drain the peach mixture well before putting it on each layer.

This is a great coconut cake recipe. The recipe is a real keeper. The addition of peaches makes it sublime. It is an easy cake to make. Some notes: I mixed everything up in my Cuisinart, and whipped the eggwhites with my Kitchenaid. The cake would be more difficult to make if you do not have these 2 machines. The cakes bake rather dense. That makes it easy to cut the cakes in half. I asked my husband (who has a better eye) to cut the cakes in half with a very long sharp Henkle knife. I was able to pick up each half with my hands without breaking. Mixing the coconut milk with the whipped creapm stablizes the whipped cream. I toasted a little more than 3 cups of coconut - just to be sure to have enough - perhaps an extra cup, and I'm glad I did. I made the cake yesterday, and it sat in the refrigerator. I brought it to work this morning, and placed it in the fridge. We just enjoyed the cake around 3:00 PM. The icing and the cake looked beautiful. Everyone raved about the cake. It is a great cake to make for someone who coes not like chocolate cake. One other note. It is the end of September. There are no more fresh peaches to be had, and so I used 3 pounds of frozen peaches. They worked perfectly. A thought: Three pounds of any fruit (and fruit conserve) would work just as well.

I needed a smaller cake, so I made both layers, but froze one and split the other, filled, and frosted it. Stabilized the whipped cream with a little gelatin melted in water. It was yummy, but the cake was a bit heavy, as others have noted. Next time, will poke holes in the two split layers and brush some of the drained juices on, prior to frosting, to let them soak into the cake. Didn't think the cake was too difficult, and not too time consuming, especially if you make the cake and toast the coconut the day before.

I made this for a girlfriend's birthday last Summer and it was a hit - even with the non coconut lovers! I'm not much of a baker and didn't set aside enough time to let it set up. So the drive to the get-together was a little tense. Next time I'll give it more time to set up. But it wasn't too difficult, even for a beginner like me.

My friends have renamed this the 'Better than Sex Cake' and everytime we have a gathering I'm bullied into making it. I agree that once the thing is cold it will all stay together, and the colder the whipped cream the easier it's going to be. It's dense but delicious. I use 2-3 less peaches than it says to use now because I always ended up with leftovers. I also use dental floss to cut the layers in half - cut a thin ridge all around the edge and lay the floss in and then cross the strings and pull slowly..it turns out nice and even without a ton of crumbs everywhere. Maybe common knowledge but definitely a great tip for those that don't already know.

This cake is not for beginners as it really can fall apart because of the density of the cake and the number of layers. A few steps can help with the sliding, though. First, definitely stabilize the whipped cream. You can do this a variety of ways (powdered sugar, cornstarch, purchased stabilizer), but it is an even better idea to leave some extra time (a) for the whipped cream to chill a bit before you layer the cake and (b) to assemble the cake layers in a springform pan and letting it set in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours before doing the final frosting and covering with coconut. Once the cake has set, it won't go anywhere. Personally, i think the cake is too heavy for the lightness of the whipped cream and the fruit, which is also why it slides. A coconut flavored genoise would be a better cake for this recipe, but cake flour is certainly somewhat of an improvement.

Rating: 3
I made this yesterday/today, and it was wonderful. I made the cake part yesterday, but I didn't separate the eggs (for lack of time), so my cake probably is more dense than it might have been. Instead of the filling, I brushed each cake layer with some Triple Sec, and then some of the syrup from canned peaches. Then I chopped some peaches and placed them on each layer, topped with whipped cream. I stabilized the whipped cream. The toasted coconut was awesome. I didn't have any problems with the layers sliding. Another thing to note is to make sure to use "cream of coconut", instead of coconut milk, which is thinner and unsweetened.

I thought this cake was one of the best-tasting I have ever made. Recently, I had to make a dessert for a large group and had been wanting to try this cake for a long time. Because of the numbers I had to feed, I did not bake it in the round pans but, rather, in one 9" x 13" pan and baked it for about 40-45 minutes. After removing it from the pan, I used string to cut it in half horizontally and then, using 2 spatulas, removed the top layer. I used peach preserves (I didn't have any fresh peaches) and the whipped cream for the filling, then carefully replaced the top of the cake. I sliced some canned peaches to put on the top of the cake and then I frosted the whole thing with the remaining whipped cream. Everyone who tried the cake thought it was delicious. I'm going to try this with strawberries (as soon as there are some available that don't taste like wood).

I have read that for a few the cake fell apart i experinced this when i used all purpose instead of cake flour. I have made this 2 times now and is very good. ps. the cream of coconut makes your wip cream runny so no need to use it in there. also powdered sugar helps to hold the wip cream together and is not too sweet. I also made a peach purre and was easy to cut one layer paech the wip cream for every layer it makes it easy to cut ... the cake flour makes a huge diffrence.. some said the texture was like puond cake but if you leave it in the fridge overnight its more like a cheesecake consistancy. very good would always servr cold

I followed this recipe to the letter. It is for a dinner party my DH and myself are going to tonight. The cake fell apart & when I assembled it it slid all over the place. I guess we will have to eat it in bowls because I will not throw it out I spent to much time & effort & $$ on it. This is the first recipe from this site that I have tried. Not a good first impression. But maybe better luck next time. Wish I had read the reviews first - Might have got some ideas first.

I've made this cake countless times and it always gets raves. Due to a series of mishaps during a recent construction, I had the cake split apart in multiple pieces in the fridge. Disappointed but undaunted I had an idea that allowed me to save the cake and have a secondary presentation style. This works wonderfully if assembled as a trifle in a large dish with layers of cake, peaches, coconut and whipped cream, topped with a layer of coconut.

The cake was absolutely wonderful! I used three cake pans instead of cutting two in halves, 1/2 cup conf. sugar in frosting, which kept it from sliding,and two wooden sticks to keep it from sliding, cut the peaches into smaller pieces, and made it the evening before the party - thank you previous reviewers for the tips!! Everyone loved this cake - a very special dessert!!!!

I tried this cake for a special occasion, the visit of my girlfriend who I only see annually. Last visit she arrived craving southern coconut cake. We couldn't find any. THIS year I took matters into my own hands and used this recipe to come full circle in granting her a sweet wish. We made it together. It was quite tall, so it didn't fit in my cake keeper, but it kept well in the fridge. During the prep we displayed your photo of it on the computer screen for inspiration. THIS IS A keeper.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge success. It looked beautiful and tasted delicious. I reduced the sugar in the filling from 1/2 cup to 2 tbsp and it was just the right amount of sweetness. Also, I drained the filling in a colander for about 10 min. before assembling the cake and it did not get soggy or slide at all. Chopping the peaches into smaller pieces made it easy to serve.

I guess I was missing something with this cake. Everything came together ok, but it wasn't anything spectacular. The layers slide around too much, making it hard to transport and even harder to cut. The cake itself was dry even with the peach juice and was too sweet.

I can't say enough positive things about this cake. The flavors are fantastic together. The only changes I made were adding a 1/2 tsp coconut extract to the cake batter and chopping up the peaches a little more and making sure they were fairly well-drained before piling them onto the cake layers. I'll certainly make it again.

Very good. I used unpeeled nectarines because my grocer didn't have nice peaches out when I went shopping (I wouldn't have wanted to peel them all anyway).

What a beautiful, yummy cake. I didn't change the recipe a bit. I thought it was very light and refreshing with the fresh peaches and whipped cream frosting.

This cake is sooo yummy. It is a very time consuming cake to make, but well worth the effort. The cake is also very dense, which I like. I did not use fresh peaches I used canned. I did not put the peaches in the peach jam. I heated the jam and added a little almond extract to it and let it cool and then I brushed this mixture on the cake and arranged the peaches on top. Then I added some of the frosting which I had some trouble with. Using whipping cream without some type of stabilizer is hard. I sugguest adding gelein which I did not - my frosting was very runny and I didn't not put it on until the day of my party. But the cake was a success and will definately make again. This cake is very pretty too. Instead of putting sliced peaches on top I added some fresh cut flowers and with the toasted coconut it was absolutely beautiful and my guests raved!!!!!

Very impressive presentation on this one! I made for my Mother-in-law's Birthday! Everyone loved it! Since the fresh peaches at my store looked awful, I decided to substitue canned, sliced peaches. I just omitted the sugar, since the canned were sweet enough. I also took the advice of another reviewer, and chopped the peaches for the filling for easier slicing. I also added a couple of tablespoons of almond syrup to the peaches. Used the drained juices from that mixture and brushed each layer of cake before filling. Since I didn't have deep enough cake pans, I purchased the disposable aluminum ones and made 4 thin layers. Turned out GREAT! I also agree with another reviewer...make sure you beat the butter and sugar until VERY light and fluffy, and the cake will turn out great. I also had plenty of frosting by following the original recipe. By using canned peaches, you can make this anytime of year! It also cuts the time it takes to blanch, peel and slice the peaches!

The toasted coconut really makes it tasty!

I changed the recipe in the following ways after reading the feedback: I used 2 teaspoons baking baking powder, and I used extra-large eggs (at room temp). I lined my baking pans with parchment paper and had no problem removing the cake. The cake turned out like a nice pound cake. For the frosting, I used 4 cups of whipping cream and added 1/2 teaspoon coconut flavoring plus 4 tablespoons powdered sugar. Since I was serving this the next day, I stabilized the whipped cream by using unflavored gelatin. I trimmed the edges of the cake and placed the layers in a trifle bowl - no mess in serving this version plus it looked lovely with the peaches peeking out from the whipped cream. I took the completed trifle to work, and everyone who tasted it said it was absolutely terrific and wanted a copy of the recipe. That spells success to me, and I will definitely make this again!

Several people have mentioned the density of the cake. When I was putting it together it seemed to me that the amount of leavening was not right - a good rule of thumb being a teaspoon of baking powder per cup of flour. Unfortunately I stuck with the recipe and the result was reasonably tasty but much too solid. This is too expensive a dessert for it not to be perfect in all respects.

Very good taste and it did look impressive! My husband commented to me after our guests had gone, "You know I am not a big fan of "fruity" desserts, but that cake of yours was incredible!" ... And that, my friends, was the ultimate compliment. I put whipped cream icing on each layer not leaving enough to cover the entire cake. Although it looked nice coming out the sides and piled on the top, next time I would make extra. Also, be sure to have enough people to eat it the day you make it; I thought it lost flavor the next day.

I made this for my husband's birthday because he loves coconut. It looked gorgeous--I topped it with four sliced, fanned peaches and a mint sprig. The cake was not as light as I would have expected, but tasted good with a slight hint of coconut. The only issue I had was cutting--since I had to cut through the peach slices, I needed to use more effort but be very careful not to push down on the knife too hard. The next time I will cut the peaches in smaller slices and then cut them in half.

i thought this cake was great! i did make the cakes in 3 9inch pans with 1 1/2 inch high sides and didn't cut each layer in half so my cake had 3 layers - the cake that i made ended up being rather light - i think the big deal is to really beat that butter so it is very light and fluffy - also, don't get the egg whites dry - my husband loves cakes but not sweet ones - he said it was one of his new favorites! chiling the cake about an hour before serviing the first slice is key - also, make sure that the coconut is very toasted and dry - that could wreck it right there - have made twice and great each time - but it's a time consumer...

I had an excess of peaches, so decided to make this for a labor day pot luck. After reading the slicing etc issues I made it as a trifle and everyone thought it was very good - but for me not worth the effort. Coconut is not very evident in the cake (although the cake is tasty). Texture was not adequate for a trifle however. I used the drained juice from the filling to moisten the cake pieces. If making something similar again I would use lady fingers to replace the cake and speed up the preparation

This is a beautful cake!! We even bought a fresh coconut, then grated and toasted it for the topping. However, its beauty is only skin deep. This cake was very heavy, like a pound cake, but even heavier. I prefer a cake with a more distinct crumb. The taste of butter came through, but not the coconut. I lined the pans with parchment paper to avoid the sticking problem that a revious reviewer warned about (good idea). I also whipped the cream to a stiff consistency like some other reviewer said to do (another good idea). The cake held together fine in the frig until I began to slice it. Then the layers all slipped apart. Very messy and far from beautiful. If you really want to make this cake, maybe insert some discrete wooden scewers to hold the layers together. Coconut, peaches, and whipped cream are a great combo - in that the recipe should get 4 stars. But the cake ... just not right. I will stick to the Cake Bible for cake recipes. Ms. Beranbaum has never steered me wrong! I will not make this recipe again.

This cake was very good and my company loved it. I felt that it was the peaches and the whipped cream that made it. The cake seemed to be heavy and a little underdone.

I served it from the refrigerator and it seemed easier to cut that way.

this cake is sooo delicious. I can't believe people had so much trouble with this I tried it twice now and both times it has turned out wonderful.

This cake was more work than usual, I had no problems except getting cake out of the pan so will use parchment next time. I thought it was good, but I took it to work and they thought it was "fabulous", "best cake I've ever eaten in my life" -- many comments like this from a group that tells you what they really think. Agree with saving the juice, a shame to lose that wonderful flavor. Had no problems with whipped cream but whipped it really well, firm.

I agree that this cake was a little "sloppy" but those usually make the best desserts! I don't think that I got the whipped cream stiff enough, but I did drain the peaches. BUT DON'T WASTE that juice!! I added a little cornstarch and cooked the juice to thicken it up; it had a lot of flavor and a beautiful color, and added just that little bit extra!

Wow, this was time consuming but worth it! Everyone loved it. Listen to the warning on toasting the coconut -- it toasted in a few minutes. Also, I had way too much whipped cream. I like the other cook's idea about serving it like trifle although mine was not mushy and served well after sitting in the fridge for an hour.

This recipe was expensive and very time consuming, although not difficult. The worst part was that after 2 hrs and $10 of ingredients, the cake did not rise properly, the filling was too runny, and the frosting would not hold stiff enough peaks. The whole thing was a mush, although everyone agreed it was a delicious mush. It was better served in a trifle bowl than a cake plate. I would not make this again, and I would strongly recommend that you make it once before attempting to make it for company, as this attempt at a fabulous dessert earned me laughs instead of oohs and ahs. (I am an experienced cook, by the way, so I do have a clue what I am doing.)

Everyone in my family enjoyed this cake. I do think it is best after just an hour or so in the refrigerator, not a day. I used a 7 oz. package of coconut, toasted, and that was plenty.

I made this dessert for my busy breakfast restaurant. It was fabulous. I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it. Including the help! As others have said before me, watch that coconut! Once it starts to brown it goes very quickly!

It's very delicious!!! Everyone at my Dinner Party had to have the recipe before they went home. When I'm invited to a friends house I make this cake...I've made it so many times that I don't need to go to the recipe file anymore.Keep up the good work. I enjoy your recipes very much. Thank You, Rosemarie

This cake was a big hit with my family and friends. Two tips- let the cake cool longer than the 10 minutes before you take it out of the pan. Also, watch when you cook the coconut. I burned it the first time- it toasts in less time then they say.

This cake is wonderful and very Summer looking. I had fresh peaches that were perfect which must have helped. The only thing I did different was to add 3 melted marshmallows and lessened the vanilla to the frosting.It helps to hold fresh whipped cream longer because of the geletin.

The texture of this cake is like none I have made before. The cake, peaches, and whipping cream combine to make a refreshing summer desert and the coconut is just another added delight.

I loved this cake, as did everyone who tried it. It sounds like a lot more trouble to make than it actually is. The next time I make it I will do several things differently...drain the peach filling mixture as much as possible and beat the whipping cream, coconut milk & vanilla to very stiff peaks. Great presentation. Wonderful flavors!

I am not that fond of coconut or peaches but I made this cake for my mother in law who loves both items. Let me tell you I had to eat crow. This is now by far my favorite cake. I will confess I did not make it into 4 layers. I used two 10 inch cake pans and made 2 layers. FYI if you do make it into 2 layers you dont need so many peaches. Also, be careful when you toast the coconut. If you want to impress your guests this is the cake to make.
