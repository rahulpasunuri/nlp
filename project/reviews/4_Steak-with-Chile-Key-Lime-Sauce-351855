Delicious and very easy! I cooked the sauce so the flavors could meld. I did not use the seed, as recommended. Really watch the meat so it doesn't overcook. Served with asparagus with an orange blossom honey and balsamic reduction, and couscous. A good weekday entertaining meal because of it's simplicity.

Very tasty, lots of flavor! I used top sirloin instead of skirt steak, worked well. I also seared the strips in a skillet, rather than on a broiler. I used less than 1 lb of beef, but kept the sauce levels the same and it worked out very well that way. I reduced the sauce quite a bit - maybe a bit too much. It'd work best being a *bit* liquidy. Mine became a little too thick, which made the flavor a bit too concentrated.

Wow! Delicious and simple. I used Filets instead of the skirt steak and it was amazing! The filets needed a little more time under the broiler. About 17 minutes total for their 1.5 inch thickness. You get a powerful zing of the sauce at first and then it finishes softer to taste the meat. Very happy with this recipe!
