Tastes like frozen cheesecake! I always make things last minute, so didn't have lemon - used grapefruit juice and was short just under 1/2 the sour cream and substituted ricotta (I would recommend sticking with original recipe - but still YUMMY) We have made a lot of ice cream and this is my favorite.

Well, this was my first whirl with my new ice cream maker and I was sorely disappointed. I really wanted to like this but I agree with an earlier review that said it was too eggy and way too sweet.

This was the first homemade ice cream for me and I loved it- made it in my cheap little Donvier ($4 at a thrift shop) and I fell in love with the flavor and texture. Great with the pound cake and orange- strawberries in the same issue. Delish.

Doubled the batch. Made half with the grated dark chocolate as recommended in earlier review. I preferred the "Chocolate Chip" version to the plain ice cream, but my guests loved both. Easy to make.

I make this with 8 oz. of good dark chocolate added several times every summer.

Loved this ice cream. I've made it 3 times so far; have used it for entertaining. Everyone that tries it loves it. I use 1/4C less sugar in the yolk mixture--I find it better a little less sweet. So yummy!

I'd be more inclined to use castor sugar and add a bit of cornstarch. I'd melt the sugar with the mils. Seems like a lot of sugar for this recipe. Might also be interesting made with creme fraiche and cut back a bit on the sugar. With all that sugar, I don't know how it freezes, since sugar retards freezing.

WAY too rich and eggy tasting -- this from someone who loves custard AND sour cream. I did manage to use it up -- and with big smiles from everyone at the table -- by pairing it with a lemon ice whose tartness contrasted delightfully with creaminess. A perfectly ripe strawberry and a not-so-sweet Belgian truffle as garnish made it extra special and a repeat offering.

This is the perfect companion to a cherries jubilee. The flavor is a bit like cheese cake and the name provokes sufficient attention that guests are quite intrigued and then pleasantly surprised.

A delicious ice cream with a wonderful, smooth texture. Everyone in my family gave it the thumbs up! You will not be disappointed!

Everyone thought it was just OK. It was very easy to make which was nice. It's definitely not bad, but I want ice cream to be "really good" if I'm going to go to the trouble to make it. The whole sour cream flavor just seemed a little bit odd for ice cream. Different, definitely.

I added 8oz of good bettersweet chocolate to this recipe and created the best chocolate ice cream I have ever had !!!! Chocolate with the tangy sour cream is a perfect match.

I was first put off by the name, but it came out wonderful. Even my husband and sister was impressed. You couldn't really even tell it was sour cream.
