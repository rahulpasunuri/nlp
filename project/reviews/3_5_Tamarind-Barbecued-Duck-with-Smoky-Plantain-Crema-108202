I'm amazed that anyone liked this dish. It is truly the worst meal I have ever made.

Can anyone tell me what they served alongside this dish please? I'm thinking of making this for a dinner party this weekend. I'm giving it 4 forks because everyone else did and i don't want my question to bring the rating average down ... Thank you!

The duck and the marinade are unbelievably good! I made this for our gourmet group and everyone raved and wanted seconds. The marinade would be great on any kind of poultry or on pork. If you plan to make the sauce though, beware. I had to remake it because the recipe here results in a sauce that's WAY too hot - I love spicy food and think I have a pretty high heat tolerance, but it was about all I could handle, plus it would have completely annihilated the amazing flavor of the duck. I ended up using about 1/4 the peppers called for in the sauce recipe and doubling the bacon and the plantain. Result? My guests were eating the leftover sauce out of the pan with spoons.

My friends loved it.-and were big fans of the plantain sauce. I didn't have tamarind for the sugarcane marinade, so I used dates instead. Also, I added a bit of tabasco to balance out the strong molasses flavor. I am sooo making this again.

This is a LOT of work but also exceptionally good. I have successfullly frozen leftover crema and marinade (add more sauteed plantain and fresh cream when you defrost the crema)and the second time around was just as good - helps amortize the work!

This one of the most delicious, unique and tasty dishes I have ever made. I didn't have the tamarind so I left it out of the maranade but it was still terrific. The smoky plantian creme was nothing less than out of this world. My only suggestion is that you use a good quality Spanish Sherry vinegar. I was going to use generic sherry vinegar but I could smell a big difference and am glad I invested in the good stuff for this recipe. Suggest it highly for company especially if you want to impress. Fantastic....

This was fantastic, unique and wonderful. I didn't have the tamarind so I left it out of the maranade but it was still terrific. Great for a party since everthing can be made ahead. The smoky plantian creme was out of this world. Don't be afraid of the peppers...it isn't too hot somehow. Definately worth making and very impressive.
