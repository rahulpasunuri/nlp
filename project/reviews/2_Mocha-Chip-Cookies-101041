These cookies sounded interesting, but in reality, they were ugly, flat, greasy, gritty from the whole wheat, and insipid in taste.

GREAT recipe. I decreased the sugar a bit and raised the whole wheat flour. Used very hig grade chocolate pieces and added pecans. We are a health conscious lot in my family, and this recipe is now our fave chocolate chip cookie!!!! Absolutely delicious and does not get its flavour primarily from sugar!

the cookies turned out tart, I beleive they asked for to much baking soda. I'm no expert but it was extremely disgusting, and i am sorry i made it.

I agree with the cook from Ann Arbor. One tablespoon of baking soda is way too much. I wouldn't even try this recipe. Don't waste your time.

I wonder if this recipe has a typo? The cookies tasted of baking soda. Also they were very thin and fell apart when removed from the cookie sheet.

Easy to prepare. I got about 5 1/2 dozen, reasonably sized cookies. They have a soft, slightly crunchy texture. I think the coffee in the dough keeps them from being overly sweet.
