As with virtually all of Beard's recipes, this turned out beautifully. The one disappointment with the Epicurious recipe database is that it doesn't appear to have Mr. Beard's recipe for seven-hour lamb (also known as spoon lamb). This is, by far, the best lamb recipe I've ever come across - I can't remember which cookbook it's in, but it's worth looking for. Despite the long cooking time, it requires a minimum of attention to achieve a maximum result! When I make it, I add some thinly sliced fennel and a quartered and squeezed lemon (remove after cooking) and don't puree the veggies when done. Serve it with orzo and plop the veggies on the orzo; it truly is heavenly.

Hooray for old fashioned leg of lamb! My Grandmother used to make this on special occasions and I've always wanted to try. It seems like every other recipe I've seen for roast lamb involves strong spices and lots of garlic (which I generally love) but this is pure nostalgia. Bravo!

The only change I made was to insert several garlic cloves into the meat. It was an excellent roast.
