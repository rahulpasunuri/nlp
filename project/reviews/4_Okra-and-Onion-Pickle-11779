This is an easy, quick, adaptable dish that lets you make the most out of your farmers market okra. I made this dish as directed (using just one T. of olive oil) and served it with Texas-style brisket - my guests were nibbling on the okra all night long, even those who had never tasted okra before. Next time, I think I will use my favorite vinaigrette - lemon juice, olive oil and salt.

Very refreshing when chilled. I added red pepper flakes and omitted the oil. I ended up doubling the dressing recipe.
