Great simple recipe, I strained the sauce added 2T of butter and reduced it by half, it really added another layer to the dish

I successfully replaced the veal shank with pork shank, which is more readily available in my area. Also finished the recipe in my slow cooker instead of the oven...a lot less heat in the kitchen!

This was delicious - make sure you don't skip the anchovy - it adds a subtle saltiness. Can't wait to do the eggplant and veal pastitsio.

Very good, very classic osso bucco recipe. Do not skip the gremolata - it is the perfect garnish. Oh, the perfect starter for this hearty dish is pan seared foie gras served on toast points, along with garlic-butter-braised lobster chunks, but be sure you stun the lobster before shelling it live, or it might get feisty. Happy Eating to All Foodies!

Wonderful dish!!! Classic! Shame on all of you PETA/Greenies for dissing a recipe.

Personally I found the review informing me that I can purchase humanely raised veal to be quite helpful since I have given up eating veal since moving to where I could actually see the baby calves tied and bound so they couldn't move until they were butchered. Now I can endulge my appetite and feel OK about not torturing anything, no matter where it sits in the food chain. Thanks!

This was lovely. The combined zests along with white wine as an unconventionasl choice for deglazing veal worked so well. But I was especially appreciated the technique. I'll certainly make this again, and I'll make this with lamb shanks, just to see how it transfers.

If veal were human, then inhumane might actually apply. They aren't. They are very tasty animals (especially when braised and served with a nice glass of wine) way down on the food chain. The comments section is for reviewing recipes that you've acually made, not for getting on a soapbox.

Absolutely delicious. Not too much different than other Osso Bucco recipes but a great prepare ahead recipe for company and a novel way to deal with leftovers. One can substitute lamb shanks instead of veal with red wine instead of white but definitely not chicken with gremolata!

To the two so called "reviewers" of this recipe: If you wish to pontificate and spew your opinions regarding veal, go visit the PETA website. Since you started it, if you want to really be an activist, go see how chicken and cattle are raised and killed for public consumption. Otherwise, let us foodies enjoy our gluttony.

We also do not milk fed veal for humanitarian reasons. However. I often substitute chicken for veal and sometimes use grain fed veal as it is not raised in the same manner as milk fed veal.
