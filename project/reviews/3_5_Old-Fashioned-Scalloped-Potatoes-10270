Made this recipe for Christmas dinner. Made extra sauce and used Gruyere cheese instead of cheddar. They took longer to cook than expected, maybe because I used Yukon gold potatoes. This dish was the hit of dinner. Would definitely make again!

Substituted this recipe when what I'd planned, my Cordon Bleu recipe for Pommes Gratin Dauphinois, required too low a heat and too long a cooking time (for the Jacques Pepin roast chicken I was cooking at the same time). It was GREAT! I used Cheddar for the first two layers of cheese and an imported raw milk Gruyere for the last layer, plus a few sprinklings of nutmeg. My guests were ecstatic - this is a keeper!

This is a good old fashioned recipe and as many noted you can change up some things like the type of cheese and add your own style. A common problem is cooking time, many people extended the cooking time significantly. I found I needed about 30 minutes longer to get the potatoes to the appropriate softness. Tough when the rest of the meal is on the table and everyone's waiting. Make sure to allow more time.

Very good old-fashioned scalloped potatoes. Nothing fancy, but great comfort food. Goes really nicely with a roast, roasted bird or ham.

This is a favorite staple when entertaining now, my guests always love it. Having a mandolin makes this recipe a snap. I prefer other cheeses to cheddar so i use 1/3 goat cheese, 1/3 monterey jack, 1/3 parm or asiago. I have also use leftover lasagna cheese mixture (ricotta / parm) as well...I have used this recipe to clean out my cheese drawer. I have found that I have been fooled into thinking that the recipe was cooked through when it was not by the dark color of the top, so depending on your oven, I recmnd cooking uncovered for 20 minutes not 30 or 35 you definitley want to err on overcooking this dish, not undercooking. I have frequently made a few hours ahead and then re-heated. I find this bechemel recipe made more sauce than I needed...i.e when I did a double batch I only increased sauce by 1.5, there is usually sauce leftover which is great on pasta for my little one. The carmelized onions are totally key to the flavor.

Rating: 2
Solid meal food! Recipe implies that the milk is supposed to be scalded, so I heated it in the microwave. Used skim milk. Thought I had cheddar but didn't -- ended up using havarti w/chives, goat cheese and parmasan. Added a layer of fresh basil leaves. Yes, salt and pepper is essential. Yummy.

Rating: 2
As written, this recipe is boring. I carmelized the onions and added salt & pepper to each layer, per reviews. Also added sage and chopped cooked bacon. Next time, I'll def mix homemade bread crumbs with melted butter and add after removing from the oven the first time. This has potential, but not without modifications. The basic recipe is good, if all you want is basic. Modify it and it would be company-worthy. Sliced potatoes are too boring on their own, and need a bit of flavor added.

Rating: 4
great recipe. i deleted the cheddar from the recipe and added a handful of asiago cheese in the roux, instead. delicious!!!

Rating: 3
As noted in previous reviews, I would use a lot less butter to make this. Could probably make the roux with 2 - 3 tablespoons butter and an equal amount of flour. Cook the onion in a tablespoon of butter, and like other reviewers, I caramelized them. I substituted swiss cheese for the cheddar, (because that's what I had on hand), and used about three cups. It was wonderful. Would also be lovely with gruyere. I salted and peppered each layer of potatoes (as other reviewers have noted, potatoes need a lot of salt). Mixed bread crumbs with melted butter, rather than dotting, and didn't put them on top until I removed the foil for continued baking. As others have suggested, the next time, I would mix the cheese and the caramelized onion in the sauce mixture to assure more even distribution of ingredients. Worth making again, with modifications.

Rating: 4
These turned out great! I followed the advice of others to use more salt -- did so as I layered the potatoes. I used a meat slicer to get even slices, replaced the cheddar with generous amounts of gruyere and emmenthaler and put it in the pan in thinnner layers. Was a hit.

Rating: 4
Caramelizing the onions is worth the effort. Mandolin makes for thin slices that cook evenly. Baked in a 3-inch deep enamel cast iron casserole with the cover, for an hour; last 20 minutes uncovered. Absolutely needs salt and pepper. A keeper!!!

Needed more of something--maybe cheese on top along with the crumbs. Makes a lot.

Remember to read all of the instructions before posting. In addition to the 20 minutes, the recipe calls for another 30 to 35 minutes. I added another 10 minutes. I also used some Parmesan cheese. My daughter and son-in- law sneaked into the kitchen to get more. I had to send them home with two containers of leftovers so they wouldn't fight over them.

this dish garners my first review. had to improvise with heavy cream mixed with water and less cheese and onions. also only had salted butter. it came out so good that he turned back to the table as he was walking away and said, "damn, i can't believe scalloped potatoes could be that good."

delicious - I increased the cheese as well and reduced the milk. But 20 minutes to cook? In your dreams!!! Try 80 minutes and still counting, and I've cranked the heat to 500 for the last 20! The cajun snapper is cold, the bbq'd peppers in anjou pear and extra virgin olive oil is tepid, and we're still waiting for the flippin potatoes. If I make it again, I'll start on Tuesday ...

Each time I bring this to a family gathering, it gets devoured. I am now forced to buy huge aluminum pans and bring double....I used salted butter, carmelize the onions (if I have time, but they love nontheless) and a combo of extra sharp and medium cheeses. I also use toothpicks in the aluminum foil wrap so it does not stick. rich, yummy and definitely for special occasions or I would weigh a ton!

This recipe has a lot of potential to be great, but it needs lots and lots of salt! I didn't add enough and had to add more after it was done, but it turned out gorgeous and I got a lot of compliments on it when I brought it to a holiday party last night. I would also recommend more cheese. One question, how do I avoid having the potatoes turn a dark blackish color, which is what happened in mine in some spots? Is there a trick to it?

I've been making this for years and have adjusted the recipe as follows. Halve the amount of onions, 6T butter, only 1 cup of cheese. I bake it for 30 minutes covered,and about 40 minutes more to get a soft texture.

This is a good basic recipe for scalloped potatoes.

Rating: 2
Okay, first of all, I would love to know why this recipe (and lots of others I have seen for similar dishes) say to cover with foil. Why can't you cover with a regular ol' lid as long as you have one? Seems wasteful to use foil if you already have a lid. Secondly, here's a tip: (Kind of obvious but something I forget since I don't make scalloped potatoes that often.) Unless you using a mandalion, your slices of potato will not be even, so put the thicker slices on the bottom for even cooking. Insofar as this recipe is concerned: It's okay.

I, too, carmelized the onions which I would do in the future. However, though I liked this recipe, I feel that I could find a scalloped potato recipe that I would like a lot better.

I made this when we went over to friends' for dinner. None of the kids (under 7yrs old) really cared for them, which was just as well, as the adults devoured them - it says 'serves 6-8', but the four of us managed quite well. Our friends asked for the recipe and agreed that these were absolutely fantastic. I followed the recipe ~exactly, except that I carmelized the onions. Made it again several months later, and it was still good. Never any leftovers.

I halved the recipe. Left out the breadcrumbs. Good, but WOW was this rich (not a complaint, mind you, just an observation). I did add a bit of dry mustard to the bechamel and salted/peppered it heavily. I'd probably add even more salt next time - potatoes always seem to eat up salt. I cut the potatoes in the food processor, baked in an 8-inch cast iron skillet, and the cook time was perfect. We still had about half of it left over after dinner. I let it rest for about 15 minutes before serving, which I highly recommend doing. This would be a great side for a big meal like a roast or baked ham.

In fact this recipe is easy to execute, and outstanding. As a cook, to me,, nothing is tooo rich !! If you are cooking for a dieter than .. no this is not something you want to serve.

Made this dish to accompany my Easter ham and we loved it. It's the classic scalloped potatoes I remember from childhood - very creamy.

I added a little extra to this recipe-ham center steaks, cut into bite size cubes layer it after the carmalized onions & then New York extra sharp cheddar. I made my own bread crumbs w/ fresh bread. melt 2 TBLSP of butter in saucepan and break up in small peices wheat bread. I cover and bake in oven for 40 minutes not 20, and uncover for 35 minutes. I used a 13X9X2. serve w/ spinach salad and vegies(french cut string beans, carrots, broccoli), and fruit for dessert.

Theses are the potatoes I've been trying to make. I cooked them in boiling water for 3 minutes, then followed the recipe - added 20 minutes to the cooking time. Family loved them. I was taught to make scalloped potatoes with layers of potatoes, sprinkled with seasoned flour and milk poured over top to cover - they have never been great! Now I have a new technique to experiment with.

Very satisfying dish! We loved the creaminess, and the onions are definitely the key to this dish's success. I agree w/ other writers that cooking time should be extended if you prefer your potatoes to be very soft. Very rich tasting even though I used low fat milk and and low fat cheddar.

Rating: 2
One -- I don't think the cooking time is long enough as I followed the directions exactly & had to recover and bake another 30 minutes or so. Two -- if you don't have time to truly carmelize the onions beforehand & you don't increase the cooking time you should consider leaving them out.

I cooked this as part of a colon-clogging tase extravaganza. I put the potatoes in a casserole dish with a full chicken and roasted the together for an hour. The oils from the chicken made the potatoes to die for. Truly horribe nutrition-wise, but incredible to taste. I'd recommend reading ALL of the reviews for this recipe. There's some pretty good ideas for different twists on this recipe. Oh yeah, I'd definetly spice up the roux more next time.

Best scalloped taters ever! The changes I made were, carmelized the onions very slowly in a large saucepan until they are brown like caramel, make the bechemel right in the onions,and used 1/2 cup half and half for part of the milk, dump into bechemel and bring to a scald, add cheese and stir til melted and pour over taters in the casserole, sprinkel with bread crumbs. Bake as directed. Went faster than the regular recipe as I was in a hurry. Total bake time was one hour. No leftovers!!! I must add - The regular recipe has too much butter. You could use half and still get a lovely sauce. Served it with ham steaks. I am making this for the next big to do in my group of friends.

Rating: 3
I cheated a bit - instead of making a roux, I put in one can of cream of mushroom soup and one can of milk. I pre-cooked the sliced potatoes for 10 minutes and I also grated some nutmeg and one teaspoon of Dijon mustard in the sauce. I grated some Swiss cheese instead of using Cheddar. My gourmet husband LOVED it! I eliminated about 900 calories from this dish by not using the butter, flour, using only half of the cheese and 1/3 of the milk (and substituting the soup, and 10 oz. of skim milk).

This is my standard scalloped potato recipe. It's a little time-consuming to make, but oh so good! I like to use sweet onions and whatever cheese I have on hand.

I pared down this recipe a bit......9 tablespoons of butter?!! I used about 2 tablespoons to make the roux and didn't use quite as many potatoes...3 tablespoons of flour and 3 cups of milk. I added the cheese right into the bechamel and it melted nicely. Use a nice extra sharp chedder and add a pinch of nutmeg and about a teaspoon of dry mustard to the bechamel....it really gives a nice flavor. They sure did get nice and brown and bubbly...very nice.

Terrific and as rich as it seems it will be. I used up my leftover Easter ham (two cups chopped medium mixed with the onions).

This received raves from guests, and I would also be inclined to give it four forks (but gosh, it's only potatoes!) Used both sharp chedddar and extra sharp white cheddar, and really carmelized the onions to a nice medium brown color. (Didn't realize that the instructions called for adding SCALDED milk before I started adding it to the roux, but it turned out fine by just slowly bringing the combined ingredients to heat to thicken.) Made it in the morning, covered and refrigerated, then heated it up in a 325 degree oven with (whole, seared) beef tenderloins (the merlot sauce posted here was a perfect accompaniment). Added extra cheese to the top. Have often made the Scalloped Potatoes with Three Cheeses, but will probably switch my mainstain to this extra-cheesed version.

This reminded me of the scalloped potato dishes that I didn't like when I was growing up. Too much onion, not cheesey enough, potatoes crisp and undercooked. The floury roux was an unpleasant surprixe. It gets 2 forks simply because of the memories it conjured up. It makes plenty for a 6-8 servings dish (must be 6-8 hungry 300 lb construction workers). Next time, I think I'll try the "three cheese scalloped potato" recipe.

I combined this recipe with the scalloped potatoes recipe just a couple above this one... I like the cheese to be whisked in with the roux mixture...

We had this dish with a honey baked ham. Delicious. It was fun to make with my new food processor. This dish definitely tastes better the next day.

I've had some awful scalloped potatoes, some taste like they've been cooked in plain milk, some like chicken broth, yuk! This recipe looked good so we tried it for Christmas. It was great, good taste (not too bland), also nice crispy top and creamy interior. Like many dishes, it was better the next day. The only variances from the recipe that we used were that we used Yukon Gold potatoes and did not peel them, added dry mustard to the white sauce and used fresh toasted bread for the crumbs. Next time I might use another onion and another cup of cheddar. This is a wonderful dish for cold weather.
