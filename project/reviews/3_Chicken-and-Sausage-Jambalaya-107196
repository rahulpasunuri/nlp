I mistook this for a previous recipe of similar name, and by the time I noticed my mistake I was committed. It was pretty bland, even after adding a bunch of spice and some shrimp. I would not make it again, there are much better recipes out there. At least one of them is on this site. I'll look harder for that one next time.

In reading the other reviews I noticed many people found this recipe bland, so I adjusted mine accordingly with great success. I figured the 1 1/2 cups of water needed to be substituted first off, and as I try not to waste anything, I added the tomato juice in my can of tomatoes in place of it, rather than draining it. It worked great. Also added some fresh thyme, chili powder, Emeril's essence (I had made some once). The final thing was, I didn't have enough long grain rice, so for a small amount of the rice, I used some short grain Japanese sushi rice that I've had no idea what to do with. It seemed to thicken the broth in a nice way as Arborio would do in Risotto. It was enough that it was not too brothy or soupy as some had complained. This is a perfect recipe to use as a starting point, and to adjust to your own taste.

Decent recipe but I add 1/3 pound mexican chorizo in with the vegetables just to boost flavor. I also add more spices - aka jalapeno or sometimes float 2 whole habaneros, adds good flavor without blowing up the heat level

I found this dish ridiculously easy to make, and very, very easy to modify -- something I place a premium on in recipes. Tonight we're having turkey sausage & chicken jambalaya with red and yellow bell peppers, celery, onions, whole kernel corn, and both rotel and stewed tomatoes. I've used old bay spice, ancho chili powder, paprika, cumin, and black & red pepper to complete the taste.

This was such a mediocre dish - A real disappointment given how much work it and time it took. I put two bay leaves, some thyme and cumin to pump up the flavor but it was still pretty bland.

I would make this dish again but with some changes. We liked it better with skinless, boneless chicken cut in 2 inch squares. It also needed some zing. Usually cajun/creole cusine has more flavor. I added cumin,crushed red pepper, and a bit of Tabasco. I used Rotel tomatoes and green chilies instead of tomatoes. Good for a small group

Dish was good, though I added cumin and ocra. It is very time consuming and makes a lot of food. I was eating leftovers for days. I would make this dish again, but I would not follow the recipe to a t, and I would probably use skinless chicken breasts.

Was very good, but I had to add more flavor as another reviewer had earlier commented. I added 1 1/2 tsps. of cumin and everyone claimed the dish delicious! Not very tasty as made the way recipe states, but the cumin livened it up nicely.

I said that I would make this recipe again because I think I could use a little less rice to make is a little more soupy, boneless skinless chicken breasts for a more healthful dish, and a lot more curry. I like spicy.

Wonderful dish to take for a group of people. It travels well and is delicious. Great for left overs. I used chipotle chicken sausage to make it an all chicken dish. I think it would be wonderful if you added shrimp and ham.

Not a lot of flavor to this. Was pretty time consuming, but that may be how it works for jambalaya. This was my first attempt to make it. It could probably work with some tinkering.

Lots of people I know make their jambalaya in the oven and recipes all differ but one huge difference from this recipe: for 2 1/2 cups of rice, we add about 3 3/4 cups of liquid. Bake for 20 mins then stir (all the vegetables tend to float to the top)and bake for another 15 mins. My mother-in-law makes the best and that is what she does (she's been cooking for about 80 years)

There are better recipes. This was more time and trouble than it was worth.I'm sure most cooks could improvise and have a much more inspired result.

this was a great christmas eve one dish meal. the only change i made was to add a pound of uncooked shrimp to the last 5 minutes of cooking.

This is an unconventional way of making Jambalaya, but the secret to the great tasting result is cooking the dish with the chicken on top (so the juices and fat drip into the rice), and leaving the bones in. I've tasted & tried lots of jambalaya recipes having lived in Louisiana, and this is a definite keeper in our house. I remove the chicken meat from the bones at the end.

Good recipe without a lot of hassle. Feeds six people nicely. Don't forget - 5 1/2 lbs. of chicken does include bones. I would definitely make this again.

For an excellent chicken and sausage jambalaya, search here in recipes for the chicken and sausage jambalaya from Bon Appetit February 1997; halve the recipe and it makes more than enough. It's excellent

7 lbs. of meat to serve 6-8? Let's get real here! Unfortunately I purchased the ingedients prior to starting. Fortunately I came to my senses before beginning and halved everything. Lots of fuss, only "OK" results. Will only be making it again as I have half the ingredients left!

I may have a good experiment for cooking from this web-site, so I want to have many more recipe.
