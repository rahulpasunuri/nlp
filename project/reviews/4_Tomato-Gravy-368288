This is a great recipe....think Southern and eat it with ham, biscuits, instead of hollandaise on poached eggs or with scrambled eggs

This dish is works well as part of a larger menu--I made it with the crawfish gravy and biscuits--and the contrast to the crawfish gravy was very nice. On its own, however, it's not much, and needed more spice. So at the end, I doused it with a punchy seasoning salt. It can be made far ahead, which is an advantage.
