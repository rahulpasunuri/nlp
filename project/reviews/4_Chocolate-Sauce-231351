This is a fine sauce. I added a pinch of salt and a bit of vanilla at the end.

fantastic! So delicious and couldn't be easier. I used Callebaut dark chocolate and the result is divine (will be used on profiteroles)

i don't understand how something so easy and simple can be so good! takes less than 5 minutes but is exponentially better than any chocolate sauce bought in a store. highly recommended!

Valrhona Equatoriale is a semisweet chocolate. The way the recipe ingredients are listed, "Equatoriale, finely chopped" looks like a separate ingredient from the line above. It confused me, too. Can't wait to make the cream puffs/sauce later today!

Not to be an idiot, but what is Equatoriale?

This is wonderful. I made the ganache with Trader Joe's Pound Plus chocolate and was happy with the results. Instead of using semisweet chocolate, I used 6 oz. bittersweet chocolate and 2 oz. milk chocolate.

I made the profiterole recipe with this sauce and a mixture of Valrona semi- and bitter-sweet chocolates. So easy and delicious!
