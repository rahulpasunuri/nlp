The loaf variation works great. I think it is important to grease the pan lavishly, use the max amount of bread crumbs (I used some pretty hefty homemade whole wheat crumbs) and also bake it for 40-45 minutes instead of the 20-25 suggested in the recipe. That way you've baked out enough moisture for the loaf to be loaf-shaped. And for the slices to be slice-shaped. I just ate a slice-shaped slice. It was all kinds of tasty.

I made it pretty much as followed except that I also carmelized the onions and finely ground the mushroom/parsley mixture so that it was more like a meal. I had no problem with the mixture holding together with 1.5 cups breadcrumbs. My only issue is that they are kind of bland; next time I'll add a little kick to spice them up a bit. Overall I do like the texture and thought they were pretty easy to make. Not delicious as of yet, but have definite potential.

I would make it again with my changes. I also caramelized the onions thanks to another good comment.Looking at the whole mess of mushrooms in the bowl of the Cuisinart- I could not imagine they could possibly hold together with the other ingredients- so I threw the whole magilla into the frying pan 'til the mushrooms were cooked and the juices were bubbling. Then I threw in the breadcrumbs and other ingredients. The patties held together beautifully. Then I fried them on medium- medium high- for three minutes on each side 'til crisp. I mixed some honey mustard with some dijon and put it on top. Quite good.

Fantastic. I caramelized the onions and used walnuts, a mix of crimini and baby bella mushrooms, and seasoned breadcrumbs. Had no problems with the mixture being too wet and only used 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs. Practically made for a Zabar's Catskills style onion roll with avocado, heirloom tomato, butter lettuce, and spicy mustard.

This is quite good. First time I made them I I had a hard time making patties and it was more of a mushroom mush. Tasted great, but was kind of unappealing. Second time was a charm. I used almost 3 cups of bread crumbs and the patties stayed together. Also substituted scallions for the yellow onions and that was a nice touch

The taste of these "burgers" is outstanding, but they are not burgers at all. It is more of a mushroom pile of mush. They do not hold together. I'm going to work at this to figure out a way to turn them into real burgers. Perhaps adding egg?

I used the variation and made this in loaf form. While it was relatively tasty (the flavor reminded me of the stuffing I make for stuffed mushrooms), it did not hold together at all. It was almost a porridge consistency and was woefully unattractive to boot. I like the idea of a vegetarian meatloaf, but there must be a better recipe. Side note: I can't even imagine this mixture as a burger patties. The flavors are much more reminiscent of a Thanksgiving dinner, not a traditional burger.

These are really delicious. I just made them gluten free by using pecan nut thins for the cracker meal.

If you use flax seeds or some other ground seed meal, it would be gluten/wheat free. Anyway, I loved these. I took the leftovers and added taco seasoning and had burritos tonight. I think I will add taco seasoning to the burgers next time and it will give them a little more kick.

how can a recipe that calls for bread crumbs/cracker meal be considered wheat/gluten free?

I just made this recipe and really enjoyed it. My husband found it a bit "vegan" for his taste, but I thought it was quite good. Wouldn't change a thing...used pecans not walnuts. I served it with the bean- creamed spinach recipe from epicurious, whole grain bread and hummus. It was hearty and satisfying.
