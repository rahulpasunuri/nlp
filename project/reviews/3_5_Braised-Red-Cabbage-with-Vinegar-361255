Yum! I added a chopped apple. It was good the first, second ...and fourth day. I was baking something else and put it in a baking dish after getting it started on the stove top.

This is a quick easy dish that I make over and over again. I usually add more vinegar as I like my cabbage tangy. Tastes even better cold the next day.

A little bland, but delicious! I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

Followed this recipe to a tee and it was a lot of cabbage for a dinner party of 6. If you love cabbage you'll like this, just make sure you use fresh caraway seeds. Mine were old thus barely tasted them.

Love this recipe as a holiday side dish! excellent with turkey, pork, and my MIL serves it on Christmas eve with Prime Rib.

A beautiful side dish with its rich purple tones, the cabbage was delightfully crispy, and we enjoyed the hint of sourness from the red wine vinegar. I used low-sodium vegetable broth, which gave it a lighter flavor than the original recipe. This dish would work particularly well as a side to pork and baked apples.

Cabbage is not my first love but this recipe is fantastic! I had some red and green cabbage left in the crisper so decided to combine the two, following the recipe as given. This will be a standard for Fall dinners with a pork roast.
