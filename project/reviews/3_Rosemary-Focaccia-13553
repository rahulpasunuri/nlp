This failed to exicte. It tasted just like what I might buy at the supermarket. It also cooked in 20 minutes, which is probably why so many other reviewers said it came out hard and crunchy after the full cooking time given. I could not make the dough cover the jellyroll pan and had to use a pizza pan.

Couldn't be simpler or more delicious. I think this is best when it's warm, either fresh from the oven or reheated, but it's fine at room temp, too. This is very pretty simply broken into serving-size pieces, rather than cut. It's so rustic and nice.

Have made this several times now - pretty big hit with everyone. I think the salt on top makes it popular with the kids. Like other reviewers, I found the flour / water ratio a little off and added a 1/4 cup more water. Also reduced the cooking time to 20-25 mintues. This depends on the bread dimensions, not the flour amount. 2 standard loaves of bread use 6-7 cups of flour or about 3.5 cups per loaf, the same as one foccacia recipe. But a standard bread loaf is not rolled out thin like this one, hence it takes longer for the interior to bake. Same reason pizza crust takes less time.

After having read the 'dry' comments. I baked this for 20 minutes and it came out perfect, I did not add water or change the ingredients. I bake all the time and would NEVER bake a loaf of bread with this amount of flour for 35-45 minutes.

Great recipe. I took the advice of another reviewer and added 1/4 cup of water and baked it as a rough rectangle on a cookie sheet. I also used 1/2 Tblsp. dried rosemary with about 1/2 tsp. each of dried basil and oregano. A really supurb bread...

This bread come out amazing! I noticed that others said it was dry, so I added 1/4 cup water extra and then made a round loaf instead of flat. PERFECT! It had a cracker crisp crust that was less then a 1/8 inch thick and the inside was sandwich bread soft. I suggest this bread with pasta tossed with stewed tomatoes and a bottle of red italian wine. Set a plate on the side with fresh ground pepper and kosher salt drizzled with olive oil for dipping the bread. Perfect!

I also found this recipe came out hard and dry. I liked the taste of it, but I added extra garlic and also put in oregano and lemon thyme in addition to the rosemary. The consistency was the problem - very crunchy. More like a cracker than bread.

I have no idea what I did wrong but this bread turned out hard and dry. I'll try it again just because ... we'll see.
