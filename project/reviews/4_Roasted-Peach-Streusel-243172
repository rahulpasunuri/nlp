To the cook from Sandusky, you will be fine if you use frozen peaches. I wuld not recommend canned. This is a very good and easy recipe.

To the cook from Sandusky Ohio (should you still check for a response a few months later), I would recommend frozen peaches rather than canned and they should work great. This was quite good and very easy.

Could this be made with canned peaches in the winter?

Very good and incredibly simple to make. Next time I will skip the whipped cream and use ice cream instead.

Also, the skin is really easy to peel off after they are baked, if anyone has a problem with peach skins!

Wowww! I put some cinnamon in the cream I whipped!

Made these for a late summer concert in the park. Made right before we left and served warm w/the whip. Very easy, but I would suggest fork blending the crumble ingredients after lightly pulsing the nuts (used walnuts and almonds) so that the nuts keep their crunch.

Easy and delicious!

I sliced the peaches (had to stretch the recipe to serve 6) and served with vanilla ice cream rather than the whipped cream. Even easier! -- and really, really tasty.

What a delightful and easy recipe. I served this with cinnamon ice cream and it was fantastic. Nice presentation with little fuss. The skin is a little tough to eat, however. I don't know if peeling beforehand would make the peaches lose their shape as they cook. I might consider peeling them after they cook, next time, if I can do it without the topping falling off.

This was easy to make and made a great presentation. The whipped cream on top was fabulous. This recipe will definitely become a regular in my summer kitchen.

Try it again with ripe peaches. Don't skip the whipped cream. It's very nice.

I loved the topping, unfortunately my peaches weren't as ripe as I would have liked so they were too firm even after the 20 minutes. Will try again though!
