Eh, there seriously wasn't enough orange flavoring. I didn't have heavy cream so I used cool whip. The cream was too much. I had to add more orange juice into the mix and that still didn't suffice.

This is wonderful as is, but add it to a nice wine glass lined with ladyfingers and it's even better.

A definite keeper - easy to prepare, with few ingredients at hand, and a distinct orange-curd flavor. Decorate with paper-thin orange slice.
