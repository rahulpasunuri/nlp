I used leftover blackened grilled salmon - slightly warmed in the microwave, and red grape tomatoes. A very quick & tasty dish! Would definitely make it again, maybe even using the smoked salmon.

The simple combination was superb. I used Dave's line caught Alderwood Smoked Salmon....it is delicious.

I added a bit of tarragon which was nice, but not necessary. I used whole smoked salmon from our farmers market and the dressing helped make it more moist.
