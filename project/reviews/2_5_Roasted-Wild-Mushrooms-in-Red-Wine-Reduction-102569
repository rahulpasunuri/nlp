I had high hopes for this recipe as I love mushrooms, red wine, and port! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and the result just didn't "do it" for me. The sweetness of the port was predominant and the leftovers didn't pair particularly well with anything else. I think mushrooms and red wine can be better enjoyed either independently or with different execution.

The taste was ok, but not great. I didn't like the colour or the dish because of the red wine (too rosy). I think I'd just stick to white wine, fresh herbs with a dollop of butter and sauter the mushrooms.

As a side dish this recipe is not impressive. I substituted home made dark chicken stock for the red wine reduction and upped the Marsala to 1/2 cup during the roasting process. Similar to a classic chicken Marsala dish, I browned split chicken breasts in clarified butter. Plating included the Marsala roasted porcini and onions over Parmesean risotto cakes and the warm chicken breasts.

I found the red wine reduction overpowering. With all these wonderful mushrooms, I want to be able to taste the mushrooms! I served this over the porcini risotto cakes and it completely drowned out the flavor of the risotto. I would stick with a more simple butter and fresh herb treatment for the mushrooms, allowing their flavor to shine through. Pretty pricey and time consuming for so-so results.

I made this for dinner for my boyfriend, and he enjoyed it. I found the recipe to be a bit "involved" but the final product was quite good. I cut everything in half, but forgot to reduce the amoung of pearl onions (never a favorite of mine to begin with). This is one I'll attempt again.

This tasted good, but took more time than I am willing to spend on a side dish. Also, I used portobello and cremini mushrooms and they tasted just fine.

A bit stepy - I used about 1/3 less wine than suggested. Was well received.

This is great as a side dish or appetizer - easy to make, and looks great when served - the red wine reduction enhances the flavor of the mushrooms, onions and the herbs which come together quite nicely with the risotto cakes - I would also consider using this recipe for a hot mushroom salad, with fresh mushrooms only, and no onions.
