Made this with Emmenthal cheese, which was easier to find. It was so yummy!! We enjoyed it.

I was excited about this when I was cooking it, the caraway/onion/sauerkraut/cheese mixture was tasty on its own, but on the pizza I simply thought, "Why not just eat a kielbasa on a bun with sauerkraut and cheese?"

Very good and easy to make. The only thing I did different was that I bought two 12 inch pies because that's the way they came. So I used half the sausage and half the cheese and kraut mixure on each pie and it was plenty. I never had a pizza with out tomato puree on it and I was skepticle but the mustard "puree" was excellent.

I was surprised by how much I liked this recipe. I really like Reuben sandwiches -- one of the few ways in which I really LOVE sauerkraut -- and this pizza really did remind me of a Reuben. I even used sliced knockwurst instead of smoked sausage, which was very good. It's easy, delicious and fun. There were no leftovers. I put a pinch or two of sugar in with the sauerkraut while it was braising, which I think helped cut the brininess.
