Very nice soup. I caramelized the onions before adding the rest of the ingredients. I also added 1/2 t turmeric and a few dashes of cayenne at the end, and that really gave a missing depth to the flavor. I was a little disappointed that the green soup sank directly to the bottom of our deep bowls instead of giving a pretty green swirl on top. Perhaps serve this in a REALLY shallow bowl like the one pictured and you'll get the effect in the picture.

This was a simple and delicious soup. will make again. loved the beet greens on top could have that all by itself.

This was so much better than I thought it would be, even! I made a half batch to trial the recipe... used salted butter, microplaned ginger and lemon zest instead of minced or grated, and opted not to add lemon juice after pureeing. (I used an immersion blender instead of transferring to blender.) For the greens, I sauteed them in olive oil with a large clove of garlic and a dash of herbamare (salt) before pureeing. The puree really made the soup, I'm so glad I did it. Served with buttery garlic bread and an arugula salad dressed with garlic vin. Cannot wait to make again.

I belong to a CSA and got a lot of beets in my share one week. I found this recipe and made it a few times. It is delicious and easy. I've only served it chilled, but will serve it warm in the winter. I do not use the beet green topping, though I have topped it once with sour cream and dill and another time with sour cream and chives. Both are very good. I put a batch in the freezer and it was fine, though it had to be mixed well.

Has anyone tried serving this cold? I'm curious to know if it works that way (without the greens).

I loved this soup, though I made it for dinner and I think it is light enough that it would be better as a first course. I had already used the beet greens earlier in the week for another recipe, so I garnished with fresh cilantro and greek yogurt. I also roasted the beets in the oven, thinking that would give them more flavor, but I don't think it mattered - boiling would be fine. I used a mix of part red onion and leek instead of white onions, and vegetable stock. I would definitely make it again - next time I will add extra ginger and some cayenne.

Delicious! A great way to use what's fresh in the farmers markets this summer! I added a bit more lemon juice and instead of wilting the greens in the microwave, I sauteed them with some garlic and olive oil. It added GREAT flavor!

I loved this recipe ! I didn't put the tops on the soup, I shaved parm/reg cheese and chives, with a dollop of creme fraise. I will make again !

So good. A wonderful, delicate flavor. I used homemade vegetable stock to keep it vegetarian and I served it with homemade focaccia. Will make many more times.

Very, very good. Rather than peel and cut the beets while raw, I roasted them at 375 for about an hour, then easily slipped the peels off. You can skip the step in which you boil the beets and other ingredients for an hour.

I do not have to eat Kosher, so I used half butter, half olive oil instead of the margarine. For the rest, I scrupulously followed the recipe, as I usually do when it's the first time I try it. Well, the soup turned out to be very good. Very different from a typical beet soup. It has a very fresh taste, which makes it suitable for a summer meal.

I just noticed this soup has chicken broth in it which is another reason to use pareve margarine. Again, if you don't keep Kosher you can use butter. If you do then stick with the recipe as written.

To clarify for the confused goyim, pareve is a classification of food that is considered neither meat nor dairy by Kosher food laws. Eggs, fish, and some brands of margarine are a few examples. The only reason this recipe specifies using a pareve ingredient is because it was featured in a Channukah menu with lamb; since meat and dairy cannot mix in one meal, non-dairy substitutions need to be made. If you do not keep Kosher or are making this soup with a dairy meal, you can use real butter. If you are looking for a Kosher pareve margarine try Smart Balance spread.

Nucor Brand Margerine is Parve.

Here is a definition of Pareve I found. pa·re·ve (pär-v) also par·ve (pärv) adj. Judaism Prepared without meat, milk, or their derivatives and therefore permissible to be eaten with both meat and dairy dishes according to dietary laws: pareve margarine.

Where do you find pareve margarine? I've never heard of margarine with dairy or animal products.

they are just yellow beets. probably can't find them at Publix or a "normal" grocery. Whole Foods usually carries them. I am sure regular beets would work just fine- a much brighter color of course.

Would love to try it, But what are Golden Beets ????????
