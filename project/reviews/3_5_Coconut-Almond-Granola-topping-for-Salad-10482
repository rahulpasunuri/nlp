great and easy, love to add to green salads, and eat as a snack.

Leave out the 1/2 t salt, and this is a good 3.5 forks! Compared to the other granola recipes on this site, this one has some advantages, namely, the cinnamon, vanilla, and orange zest. Those really add to the flavor! This one also crisped up well without modifying the baking temp/time. Stirring not necessary. Looking forward to combining the strengths of each granola recipe on this site to come up with the "ultimate" perfect granola recipe :)
