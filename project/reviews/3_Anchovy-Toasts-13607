These are great! Great way to use up baquette as well. Wonderful as an added item to the cocktail table. So easy--certainly going to be added to my list!

This is a great add-on to a dinner party. It may not be fancy but it disappeared at our home! Much better than plain bread. I served it with Pasta Puttanesca....yummy!

It sounds wonderful in theory, but it is just plain dull. Don't bother.
