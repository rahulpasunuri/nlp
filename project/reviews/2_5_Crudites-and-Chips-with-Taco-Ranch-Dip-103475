I too was not that impressed with the flavor of just adding taco seasoning to the mix, so I also added a dry package of Hidden Valley Ranch seasoning to it, and WOW, was that delicious!

Hidden Valley IS Ranch! If you add taco seasoning to the Hidden Valley, you will be amazed at the results.

I agree that it was so tangy and salty. I did not enjoy it, but some of my guests did.

Way to 'tangy'. Much easier and cheaper to pick up a store bought dip.

I served this to about 30 people on a recent trip to the outer banks. Ages ranged from 3-50. They all raved! I will definitely serve it again. VERY EASY!!

My guests loved this dip and they're usually difficult to please. I made it with light mayo, reduced-fat sour cream and low-fat buttermilk. You really couldn't tell it wasn't made with the full fat ingredients because the flavors of the taco seasoning were so pronounced. I didn't have any problems with the consistency -- it was smooth and thick enough to stick to the chips.

I don't understand the problem the previous cooks had with this recipe. I made it with low-fat mayo and sour cream, and it turned out great. My mother made it with full fat ingredients, and it was also great. Very quick and easy; different from usual taco dips. Try it!

This was different and easy to make, and pretty tasty. The first time I made it. though, I thought it was too thin, so the next time I only added a few tablespoons of buttermilk, to still have some of that tangy taste. I also used a thicker mayonnaise. The results were much more to my liking.

Disappointing. The flavor wasn't at all interesting, and the dip was thin. I kept having to add more and more sour cream. I almost considered blending it with cream cheese.
