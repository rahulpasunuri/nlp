I keep coming back to this recipe and every time I make it, it's a real hit. The crust is very tasty, but it doesn't overpower the lamb.

Definetely worth it! This was high end restaurant quality. I really liked the sauce as well - I simmered it for 4 hours so the sauce was a tiny bit thick, but still good, maybe better off? Really impressed the boyfriend with this one on Vday

Excellent and perfect for company. The sauce is delicious, but very time consuming. With quality lamb, you don't need the sauce and then this is easy enough for a weekday dinner. I added garlic to the olive and breadcrumb mixture.

The lamb was amazingly tender - I had marinated it the day before in dijon mustard - but the olive crust didn't easily stick on the meat and I got stuck with extra olive crust in the pan. I didn't make the sauce, the lamb I was using being of the best quality possible and serving it rare. I served it with a porcini risotto and an asparagus, portabella and tomato garlicy casserole. Pair this amazing meal with a boldy Spanish wine and voilà!

I made this for my friends and a new friend who was new to my cooking for Easter. I couldn't have picked a better dish! We actually cooked the sauce for several hours and then used a hand held blender to puree it and drizled it over the racks. Superb! I would reccommend only sauteeing the shallots and rosemary for a couple of minutes so they retain their flavor. Served with a gorgeous salad and roasted herbed potatoes, it was great!
