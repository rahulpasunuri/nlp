I really didn't care too much for this, and neither did my husband. The cream cheese just didn't work for me--it made the ice cream heavy in an unpleasant way. I won't make again.

Last summer I took this to a dinner party as part of the dessert menu. Everyone loved it and thought it resembled frozen cheesecake. My son still asks for it.

I thought this recipe was easy and I enjoyed it. I did blend the apricots along with the cream cheese and milk. I'm wondering how it would be with reduced fat cream cheese.

The cream cheese is too, too evident in this ice cream. I prefer a fresher taste.
