As a kid, Mom made this for my birthday cakes. This recipe and instructions were completely clear and it is an easy recipe. It is my favorite! I love it with coconut sprinkled on it too.

the frosting has a great light taste, not too sweet and a nice change from shortening/butter based frosting. this was my second time making this kind of icing but first time with this recipe. I made it exactly as written EXCEPT used powdered egg whites vs. fresh ones since I wouldn't be able to refrigerate it. I am a semi professional baker. I did suggestion from other reviewer and used my stand mixer bowl over a med. pot instead of my double boiler which worked great since it triples in volume. I used the frosting to make ghosts on cupcakes for Halloween and they looked great. my only issue is that the icing became soft while sitting so I am not sure if I "cooked it" over a high enough heat. It was mixing beautiful and got stiff but then after sitting 20 min. it got weepy and grainy. I rewhipped it and it did it again. was still usable just had some weepy ghosts :-)

This was easy and lovely, but tasted to me like marshmallows (which is undesirable, IMHO). When it hardened it developed a "crust" which was unappealing. It made a lot, so I spread the surplus on a piece of waxed paper and I suspect we will have home-made marshmallows soon. Will not re-try this recipe unless it's for a bunch of preschoolers.

This icing is so easy to make and great in a pinch because you only need things you usually have in the house. I didn't use the cream of tartar or corn syrup and it still turned out wonderfully! I even stirred in rainbow sprinkles right at the end to make my own funfetti icing.

This frosting is amazing. I highly recommend this. It is easy to make, fat-free, and very tasty.

The frosting is yummy, make sure you let it cool. But if you have one of the ceramic double boilers this is a recipe for disaster. The odds of damaging or cracking the insert are high. If you have a stand mixer (like a KitchenAid) you can use the stainless steel mixing bowl instead, over a sauce pan of boiling water. And you can make a double batch in the bowl, too, instead of one at a time.
