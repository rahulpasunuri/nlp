this recipe is almost magic! I have made it many times and people always ask what the flavor is. It is hard to believe just lime could transform the sometimes cloyingly sweet, sweet potato into a truly elegant side dish. Great with chicken, and would be a welcome change at thanksgiving.

Yummy,easy, healthy. Texture is very smooth, which may have put off the negative reviewer. I like it and make it at every opportunity.

The texture of this dish is indescribably awful. I can't start to compare it to anything. The taste was fine, but who cared?

This is a great tasting no fat recipe. It's easy too!
