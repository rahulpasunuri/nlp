Ever since our favorite Korean restaurant closed, my husband and I have been looking for a tasty bibimbop. This recipe was perfect! I followed it exactly and it was delicious. Even though it took a bit longer to cook the vegetables individually, I would still do the same next time. In order to get an authentic taste, the hot sauce is a must.

Dish would have been perfect, had I cooked the vegetables separately. All vegetables have different cooking times and the zucchini cooked quicker than the carrots. A lovely and satisfying meal that is worth the work. My guests loved it. Use the freshest organic garden veggies for the best results.

This only has 3 flavors: salt, garlic, and sesame. I didn't care much for it, but did appreciate the use of lots of different vegetables.

Delicious! The only thing it's missing is the hot stone bowl that you get at Korean restaurants which makes the rice crispy. I used brown rice which gives it a great flavor. Next time, I will saute all of the veggies together instead of individually. I do love it presented the traditional way with individual items, but you mix it all up anyway so might as well save the steps for a weeknight dinner.

Unique and delicious. You must combine all the ingredients in the bowl with the hot sauce, vegetables, rice and egg. It's a Korean "unfried" rice. Try at a Korean restaurant first.
