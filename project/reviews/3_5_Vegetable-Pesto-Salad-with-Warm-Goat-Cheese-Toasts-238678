This was not what I expected. Sometimes it's a challenge preparing supper when you have a husband who thinks there is nothing better than iceberg lettuce and ranch dressing. Too much work for too little taste.

I made this simply to use up peppers I had in the frig. I'm not really even a pepper fan but this was surprisingly very good. My husband loved it too. Believe me, I'm critical and I loved it!

What a wonderful and tasty first course or lunch. It was much appreciated by my parents. Lots of flavor. A fancier version of what we used to eat weekend afternoons as a kid, when my Italian dad used to make his toasted cheese and I couldn't wait to eat it. A glass of wine goes well.
