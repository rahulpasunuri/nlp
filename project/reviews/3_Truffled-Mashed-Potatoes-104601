I really want to rate this a 3.5. I boiled whole, unpeeled baby reds in salted water until fork tender. Mashed whole, then added the milk, cream, chives, oil. I'm the type that likes my mashed potatoes with texture. I feel when they are creamy smooth, they remind me of instant potatoes, which totally lack texture among other things. I'm not a truffle "connoiseur" (sp?), but I have been addicted to truffle oil since my first encounter at a chef show! I can't say if the "real" thing is better than the oil since I've never had fresh truffles, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it tastes like crap. It was excellent.

I go to culinary school. I can assure you that we all know quality when we see it. When it's grilled into you eight hours a day, that generally happens. That having been said, I have had truffle oil and truffles as well. I like them both. My instructors do as well. And surprise surprise, they've gone to the most prestigious culinary schools in the world. I do believe that when fresh are not available, truffle oil is more than perfectly acceptable.

Let's face it, folks. Truffle oil tastes like crap. It's trendy, expensive, and found in many menu items in fashionable restaurants. Truffle oil, regardless of how expensive it costs, tastes unpleasantly acrid and "off". It tastes nothing like the thing it is meant to approximate. In my experience the flavor of truffle oil works better, if at all, with wild mushrooms, but otherwise forget about it. Save your money for the real thing--a genuine truffle, shaved into mashed potatoes with only butter and salt for adornment, is far superior to this recipe.

I guess I'm not a big fan of truffle oil. I didn't like the taste in the potatoes, found it to be too strong.
