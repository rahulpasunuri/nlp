Followed others advice and halved the olive oil. Paired it with the Tequila tri tip. People used it as salad dressing as well. Enjoyed by many.

Made this with for a Mexican night for company. It definitely needs to gel together. I put it together with the Cilantro dressing about a 1/2 hour prior to serving and it was good. Ate it the next day and it was excellent. I suggest making it a day ahead.

I have to agree with all the raters - it was EXCELLENT. I will double the cilantro sauce because people came back to put more!!! It was amazing - there were NO leftovers!

Yum! Very good with the delicious cilantro dressing. I was worried about the serranos for my toddlers, but they are really quite subtle so don't skip them (or add more!)

I hate it when I agree with the minority, but this rice is just okay...not very flavorful. The cilantro dressing helped, but it's too vinegary. Not sure I'd make again.

I stumbled across this recipe in 2005 and have been making this side dish ever since. I am always asked to bring this to every mexican-themed potluck and guests to my home are very disappointed if I don't serve this with our meals. 'Nuff said. Good Stuff Maynard!

I made this rice dish recently for a football party and it was a hit. I couldn't keep my family's fingers out of the rice while it was cooling, it was that good. When serving, I kept the Cilantro Dressing separate as I wasn't sure everyone would like it. That's an understatement, the guests drizzled it over everything (taco's, enchiladas, rice, etc). I did finally mix the leftover cilantro dressing and rice together and reheated the next day. It was like heaven!

Delicious! Perfect potluck dish! It goes well with grilled meat, Mexican food, and any bean dish. Friends always request the recipe. Fixing it tonight with pork tamales, heirloon beans, and a simple salad. I've been making it for years.

I'm only reviewing the rice since I haven't made the cilantro dressing yet. The rice has very good flavor. Took the advise of a previous reviewer and sauteed the onion, garlic, pepper and rice together for 10 minutes. Before serving rice added some fresh cilantro, chopped green scallions and squeeze of lime juice. Will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
Easy, flavorful, serves well hot, warm or cold and the Cilantro dressing really kicks it up! Just looking for excuses for 2nd and 3rds. Make extra, you'll be happy IF you have leftovers! Only change I made was using a "generic" red chili from my window box. It had heat and that is the fun key.

Rating: 4
I agree. This is an exceptional rice dish, with the cilantro dressing. I made it for a big Mexican buffet dinner I hosted for my daughters' college friends. They kept coming back for heaping plates of seconds and thirds of rice only! Good thing I made a double batch. I sauteed the rice with the onion mixture for a full ten minutes, as recommended by the reviewer below. The rice browned nicely and turned out very light and fluffy. Definitely will do again!

Delicious! Much better than the any reddish Spanish style rice. Served as an accompaniment to Grilled Pork Chops with Tomatillo/Apple Sauce from this site.

The flavor on this is very nice, but mine came out a bit soggy. I'll be sure to cook the rice in onions and oil longer next time for the right texture.

Made this last night and everyone raved about it. They all wanted the recipe. The dressing really put it over the top.

Pretty good base recipe. I added a few extra items. I added about 1 tsp of harissa and I used a packet of goya sazon (annatto) for colour and flavour in place of the salt. I made the suggested Cilantro Dressing to drizzle over the top and it was amazing. Next time I will chop up some fresh scallions for the top of the rice.

the tip from another poster about sauteeing the rice for 10 minutes before adding the broth was really helpful. i always end up with rice that is too wet, and with that tip, it came out perfect. i also put a little lime zest and minced lime segments in for a little extra flavor. it came out with a little asian-y taste. easy recipe.

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe except that the most important thing has not been explained... as Mexican Grandmother taught me, you MUST cook the rice in the oil and onion mixture for about 10 minutes. If you don't, it will be sticky and not light and dry and fluffy! Other than that, this recipe totally works!

I made the rice with the dressing yesterday as a side dish to Sonoran-style chicken chimichangas for a family dinner (extended family, 20 people) and whoa~ it was a resounding success. not one person *didn't* ask for the recipe. don't omit the cilantro dressing, it's the soul of the rice, LOL

Rating: 2
Everyone enjoyed this recipe, but I still prefer the easy Mexican rice...long grain rice cooked and mixed with Salsa! The Cilantro dressing is interesting, but I wish I had made half of it. I still have some left and am trying to think of a creative use for it, as it is too strong for salad greens. After all, we all know that a little bit of Cilantro goes a very long way. If I am going to this much trouble, I'd rather make Basil Pesto!

I served this for a dinner party along side fish tacos (Fish Taco Platter). It is really easy to make and can be done well ahead of time. My only criticism would be that the rice is a little oily- I would consider cutting some of the oil next time.

Not for me. I made this after reading the rave reviews but found it too wet. The flavor was okay but a very average taste. Not good enough to make me want to bother going the extra mile instead of steaming some nice, nutty brown rice. Served it with the black bean quesadilla's (recipe here and very good) and an avocado and lime salsa.

I made this last night with the Cilantro Dressing and it had great flavor and color. I didn't let it cool as long as directed and it was fine. I used extra virgin olive oil for both the rice and dressing and think the olive oil flavor was too pronounced. Next time I would try light olive oil in the dressing and use canola when frying the rice. I just had a bite of the refrigerated leftovers and the flavor is even better today. This rice could be a great base for a number of different dishes.

Who knew rice could be so good? This rice was awesome even before adding the cilantro dressing, and was even better after. This is the way I will make my rice from now on. My husband couldn't get enough of this.

From the first tiny forkful we both rolled our eyes in ecstasy. This recipe combines all of our favourite ingredients with perfect balance. It's bursting with flavour. When stirfrying the onion and crushed garlic, I also threw in some whole or half garlic cloves and cooked everything slowly. They were almost caramelized, and one of the yummiest parts. My boyfriend said, "This is spectak."

This was a hit! The spiciness of the serrano chile with the cool cilantro balanced perfectly. I added diced red pepper to the recipe and instead of the 3 1/4 c. chix. broth - I did 3 c. chix broth and 1/4 c. salsa juice for color and flavor. It was delicious!!

I just made this with my mexican themed dinner which included shredded pork enchiladas, here is what added, when the rice finished cooking, I added 1 and 1/2 cups of frozen sweet corn, the heat from the rice thawed the corn out, then I added 2 fresh chopped tomatoes. The dressing was soo good, i only used a cup of cilantro in fear of it being too strong and only about 1/3 cup olive oil. But this one will be the rice I make from now on when I make my mexican meals. So so good, all the guests loved it!

I admit I was not too sure about adding the cilantro dressing to the rice, but it was absolutely fabulous. My husband, who rarely gives rice a second thought, commented it was the best rice he's ever had. Now regarding some changes I would make next time around. First up, I think I would kick up the chiles a bit. Would like just a tad more heat. Secondly I would be sure to use regular or light olive oil in the dressing. I had only x-tra virgin, and I thought the flavor was a bit too pronounced. And finally, I failed to read the directions thoroughly and did not have time to let the rice cool (1 1/2 hours seems awfully long ~ wouldn't the rice be completely COL by then?) I just let the rice cool maybe 5 minutes, then tossed with the dressing, and it was delicious. We served with grilled skirt steak and grilled vegetables and it was a delightful combination. Will DEFINITELY make again!

I took this rice to a Cinco de Mayo party and it was devoured...even though it was slightly overcooked. Everyone, including myself, remarked how much we dislike standard boxed Mexican rice. I used 1 cup chopped onion instead of one large and 1 whole jalapeno (seeded) instead of the serrano. OUTSTANDING!

The rice was awesome. Why do people make rice with water when you can make it this way? Even with out the dressing it was good. The dressing was awesome on the rice. I would not use as much oil next time. I did get to be too greasy. I would add it to the rice a little at a time and keep tasting it as you go. That way, you wont over do it.

This dish was simple and delicious, I didn't think it was too oily, I just mixed about 1/6 of the dressing on the rice. The cilantro dressing recipe says it is enough for the rice and seafood salad, but I did not see the recipe for that. We did use the leftover dressing on fresh grouper served on a plain grilled corn tortilla. I will make this again, it would be great to take to a pot luck because it is served at room temp.

This was fantastic! I used brown rice, as I was out of white, and just cooked it about 40 minutes. Followed other reviewers' advice and reduced the olive oil. Hadn't read the recipe all the way through so didn't realize it took so long to cool-ended up stirring it in a bowl over an ice bath.

This is a great side dish, except that 4 garlic cloves is WAY too much. I tried it a second time with 1 1/2 cloves in the rice dish and the regular amount in the cilantro dressing and it was much better. Very unique.
