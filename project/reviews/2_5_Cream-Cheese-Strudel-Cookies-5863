I had no "crumbling" problem with the dough; maybe I got lucky. DEFINITELY bake these on a silicone sheet! They leak and ooze sugar and chocolate like crazy. They are very yummy: I made the variation another person suggested using cherry preserves and mini chocolate chips.

The dough was a little too crumbly, so I added a little water as if I were making a pie crust and then chilled it. I used cherry jam, mini chocolate chips and coconut to do a 'Black Forest' cookie- they turned our yummy!

Do not bother dirtying up your food processor for these cookies. They are not very good. The dough is difficult and the final result was ugly and completely mediocre tasting.

Delicious! I found it very easy. I did as they suggested and put the dough in the freezer for 15 min.. Must flour your rolling surface very well and keep moving the dough as you roll it out to make sure it stays free of the rolling surface or you 'll have to add more flour. I cut them 3/4 of an inch, a little smaller, and only baked them 22 min. Also lots of butter on the cookie sheet or they'll stick.

I made these cookies to enjoy while my husband and I decorated our Christmas Tree. They were very easy and delicious. However, the dough must be very cold before you attempt to cut them or else they do tend to fall apart. The dough would also be great filled with chocolate, raspberry preserves, almost anything. I would make them again.

This was one of the worst recipes I've tried. The dough was way too sticky, and the roll fell apart when I tried to cut it. I'm never making it again.
