This super easy and tasty recipe was even easier because I keep a container of ginger/garlic past (home made) on hand and also home made Tunisian Harrisa. All I had to chop was the onion, and I used shallots since I didn't have green scallions on hand. While the flavor isn't as complex as some Thai or Punjab dishes, I thought that it was very satisfying, esp since it was so easy. I had leftover noodles with vegetables and soy sauce from the night before and the shrimp worked perfectly with that for a 10-minute meal.

Not bad. I didn't think this had a particularly complex flavor, and the sesame oil separated from the other ingredients after cooking, which isn't very tasty. Since I couldn't get chili bean sauce, I used half miso and half sriracha (although I recommend 75%/25% next time). I also recommend making a double sauce recipe for serving with rice.

Ok, can i just say that this shrimp dish came out perfect! Even my chinese father and mother in law loved it and commented on how nice the dish was. I too doubled the sauce, which i think is an absolute must as it looked a little dry even with double the sauce. Other than that, i followed the recipe as is. DELICIOUS! Must try!!

Absolutely awesome & easy recipe! Substituted Balsamic Vinegar for Black,and Chili Garlic Sauce for the Black Bean Paste. Left out the sugar. Doubled the sauce. Next time will double shrimp - the whole family loved it, even my 7 yr old! Can't wait to try with Chicken. Yum!

Taking tips from other reviews, I used chili garlic sauce instead of black bean paste, balsamic vinegar, and pure sesame oil. I also doubled the sauce. Since I didn't want to serve it over rice, I added baby bok choy and scallions cut into 1 inch pieces. This recipe was devine and my husband and both loved the amount of spice. I'll definetly make this again and will also try with different seafood and maybe chicken.

Love love love this recipe, very spicy. Only thing is I double the sauce so there is plenty to serve over rice!

Tastes just like a dish I used to have a Chinese restaurant that I worked at 25 years ago. I'm not sure what they meant by "bean sauce" but I had Oyster Sauce on hand and it seemed to be bean-based so used that instead - added a little hot pepper sauce to taste. I think Garlic Black Bean Sauce would taste good, too.

This is a very simple but delicious recipe. I used large shrimp and substituted Hunan Red Chile Sauce for the chile bean sauce. The heat was just right for us who like it spicy. I would have liked more sauce and next time will double it. It worked nicely over rice noodles.

Oh, wow. I had no idea these shrimp would be so addictive or roundly flavored. I made them as an afterthought while cooking hot and sour soup (first time making it; I used the excellent recipe on this site, called "Chinese Hot-and-Sour Soup"), since I had all the ingredients on hand. For .61 lbs of small shrimp, I halved the aromatics and frying oil but used the full recipe's worth of sauce, effectively doubling it as per recommendations. I'm glad I did; there wasn't really any extra. I cooked everything in a regular frying pan since I don't own a wok, used cider vinegar since I'd just run out of Balsamic (a better black vinegar replacement), and substituted white pepper for black. Also, I'm assuming my Queen's brand "soy bean paste with chili" (ingredients: chili, bean sauce, salt, sugar, water), bought a major Asian supermarket in Jackson Heights, is what the recipe called for as "chili bean sauce." Anyway, the dish is wonderful and, aside from the deveining, incredibly quick; I was concerned it would be far too hot for my boyfriend, but it was perfectly balanced between his milder preference and my spicier one. We devoured it all between us.

I followed the recipe. It was all right, but I thought the tomato paste didn't work well in this dish. Also, the dish was not spicy enough for my taste. I believe that this recipe will be better if chile-garlic paste is substituted for the tomato paste.

This is a weekly staple, so fast and easy. Make sure you use chili bean sauce. I followed the recipe and did not make substitutions like other readers. Delcious served with steamed rice and bok choy.

Quite tasty, with an aroma that filled the house. But spicy? Not to me. Perhaps if ground sichuan peppercorns were used instead of black pepper. (alas, I've never found them in my area. Nor chili-bean paste. Used black bean paste and sriracha instead) Needs more heat for my taste, but I ate the entire dish myself.

I cooked some Somen Noodles (very thin-Thai store) saved some Somen cooking water to add to sauces to produce more moisture and gravy. I cut the first part of the ingredients (shrimp part) in 1/2 because it is just us 2. I used the full SAUCE measurements to have more sauce plus adding small bits of asparagus at the end (steamed first). Great dish!

Rating: 4
Great! I also doubled the sauce. I used black bean paste because it was all I had on hand, but added a spoonful or two of chili-garlic sauce to add some heat. I added in some fresh steamed broccoli at the last minute, tossed it, and served it with rice. It was fantastic.

This dish has become a regular favorite. We don't always have tomato paste at hand, but I cheat with ketchup and it works well. We always add vegetables to make a larger stir-fry -- baby bok choy is a tasty addition. The sauce is great with tofu as well as shrimp.

Really, really yummy. Like others, I couldn't find Chili Bean Sauce, so I mixed Black Bean Sauce and Chili Sauce. And, it's great over noodles!

If you are getting an odd bitter taste, it might be that you are using pure toasted sesame oil. I at first added this, then sensed something about the smell was off, and then added 2 tblsp of pure non-toasted sesame oil - the two smell dramatically different (toasted is very dull smelling, untoasted aromatic). This also helped to thin out the sauce, since I now had 4 tblsp sesame oil!

The sauce was entirely too sweet with an odd bitter aftertaste. I'd have to change around the recipe somewhat to be able to eat this again.

This was easy to make and tasty. As others noted, I would make extra sauce. It still will not be "saucy". I made it with surimi (imitation crab) to avoid the cholesterol in the shrimp.

An outstanding stir fry. Only changed 3 things, I doubled the sauce as advised which was great, I used rice wine vinegar because although I searched a 20 mile radius from my house, I could not find black vinegar (even the folks at the Asian store didn't carry it) and I added some stir fry vegggies that I sauteed up with a little garlic ginger paste and some spicy chili garlic sauce. Next time I might try lobster instead of the shrimp just to mix things up.

I'm so glad that I came across this recipe. It was fantastic! It'll be my favourite shrimp recipe from now on. so easy, and so full of flavor. I used rice vinegar (did not have black vinegar), and doubled the sauce as recommended.

Hands down, my family's favorite eating-in Chinese recipe! Also delicious prepared with extra-firm tofu cubed to about 3/4". If you don't usually like tofu, I dare you to try it here! I double the sauce because it's hurt-me good, and serve it with steamed broccoli on top for color and vitamins. I recommend having all the ingredients measured out before you start cooking, because it comes together quickly. If you have any, the leftovers will bring joy to your lunch break (as they are for me this very moment).

Liked this recipe a lot more than I thought I would. I velveted the shrimp with a little corn starch, vinegar and seseme oil before cooking. Second time I cooked it I threw in a handful of peanuts. I also used chili garlic paste. I liked the sauce a little drier than the others, but I generally don't eat it with rice.

I loved this dish. I did improvise (SORRY PURISTS!)...heated oil, sauteed 1T sichuan peppercorns for 1 min, then removed peppercorns, and added torn up tien tsin peppers to oil and proceeded with recipe as written, doubling sauce, omitting chili bean paste. Did you follow that? It was great.

I loved this meal! I doubled the recipe to make a nice sauce with pasta. I also added broccoli and half of a red bell pepper to the stir fry. It turned out great.

Stir-fry is made easy if you have your mise en place ready before starting the actual cooking. This recipe was a breeze, and a real winner. I chose to butterfly the shrimp because I prefer how it looks in the final product. A time-saver would be to combine the sauce ingredients together in a container, rather then adding one at a time. Less of a chance to overcook the shrimp. Was lacking two of the ingredients listed, so I substituted equal amounts of black bean sauce, and chili garlic sauce for the chili bean sauce, and apple cider vinegar for the black vinegar. After making this recipe I will certianly make a point to purchase them on my next trip to the Asian market. Also decided to use catsup instead of the tomato paste, as it is a common practice in several Asian cuisines. Definitely double the sauce so you can enjoy it with steamed rice. In my case, a brown jasmine variety. Am curious to try with boneless chicken breast. Served with Chinese yard long beans stir-fried with garlic, ginger, and tamari.

I made this for the first time last night and it was one of the easiest and nicest Chinese recipes I've ever made in my 30 years of Chinese cooking. It was as fast as the recipe said and outstanding. I substituted Atkins catsup for the tomato paste. Otherwise I followed the directions exactly. For 6 people I fixed a double recipe of this (2 lb of shrimp), 2 lbs of pork tenderloin in spicy sweet and sour sauce, 4 chicken breasts (lemon chicken), huge veggie stirfry, and rice. Only three shrimp left. I was so happy with this recipe that I ordered a used copy of his cookbook today. The other recipes I used were from Wok Fast by Hugh Carpenter and they were as foolproof as all of the fast wok books the Carpenters have published.

Fantastic. Quadrupled the recipe for a crowd. I had no chili bean paste and substituted chili sauce and added 3 tbsp water. Skip the sugar in this case. Otherwise made as in and there wasn't a single shrimp or bit of sauce. Even my brother in law who never touches seafood ate this.

Love it! It's a huge favorite with my husband as well. Quick, easy, spicy, and even a pretty color. I've used Lee Kum Kee Chili-Garlic sauce as a substitute for the chili bean paste. Don't know if that makes it inauthentic or not, but it tastes good.

This was easy to make. I substituted hot sauce for chili bean sauce (my husband bought Mexican chili beans by mistake, so had to improvise) and we had frozen cooked shrimp, which worked fine (just defrosted and put them in boiling water for 10 seconds) as well. I also added sesame seeds to the sauce.

This recipe was simply FABULOUS!!! Instead of peanut oil I used chili oil. I also added red bell peppers and asparagus tips to the dish. I also, as recommended, doubled the sauce ingedients and served it with jasmine rice. My mother said it was the best chinese dish she has ever tasted. I will definitly make this again. I wish all chinese dishes were this simple and good.

Loved this simple yet delicious recipe. Do double all the sauce ingriedients: served it over jasmin thai rice. I didn't have any chili bean sauce on hand, so I replaced it with 4 tbsp of black bean sauce and added some regular hot chili sauce. Also, I mixed the cooking order: Cooked the shallots first, then all the sauce ingriedients, let it cook all together for about 5 min., then put in the shrimp and finally the garlic and ginger. Let it cook until the shrimp is done, another 5 min. Delicious!

In one sentence: This is the perfect shrimp stir-fry recipe. Extremely tasty, extremely easy. I am Chinese and am impressed with how good and authentic this tastes, especially without having to marinate the shrimp. They must have updated the ingredients list recently, because garlic is in there now. I used pre-minced (in a jar) garlic and ginger because I'm lazy, but it didn't take away from the flavor at all. Also, 4 servings is a little ambitious. Maybe because we have big appetites, or maybe just because this tastes so good, but it was barely enough for the two of us. Tastes best when you can serve it immediately after it's done, be careful not to overcook the shrimp. Add the sauce before you think the shrimp is 100% done, as it still needs to cook for a while.

Thank you again Epicurious reviewers! I followed some of your suggestions and this was great! I might not have snapped to the left out garlic in the ingredient list if I had not read the reviews. I added garlic and ginger in similar ratios and substitued Vietnamese chili garlic sauce instead of chili bean sauce. Two tsp of chili garlic was just a bit hot for our tastes but it was really good with the jasmine rice I served with it. Maybe I will just have to change my heat tolerance level as it was so good. As others have said, easy and great!
