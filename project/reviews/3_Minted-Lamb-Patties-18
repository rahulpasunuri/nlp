It kept bleating at me!

Easy to prepare and flavorful, the patties make a quick everyday dinner. I think adding cilantro would boost the taste. I used a yoghurt mint sauce on top of the patties to intensify the mint flavor. My husband thought the patties were good but not great!

The chutney melted and slid off the pattie when under the broiler so I added it after, we had them as burgers, delicious and my husbands favourite!

Ya gotta love a recipe that is simple to prepare, tastes great and is inexpensive. Served it with pecan cous cous and spinach. This took longer than the 4 minutes per side to cook in my broiler; next time we'll try the grill.

This recipe was fabulous. Super easy and my family -- including my picky six-year old son -- scarffed it up. While on the grill I topped the burgers with crumbled feta and served the chutney on the side. My son says he never wants another hamburger again. We'll see about that...

This was a very easy yet absolutely delicious dish. I served it with new red potatoes and asparagus. I think this would make a great company meal.
