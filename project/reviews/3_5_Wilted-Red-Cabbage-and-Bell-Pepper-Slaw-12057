This recipe is way too complicated for the results yielded. First off, no need to cook the veggies. The crunch of the shredded cabbage was refreshing. Secondly, it is very easy to burn the mustard seeds and ruin the whole thing! I switched it up and left the veggies raw, omitted the oil and the mustard seeds, and reduced the vinegar solution before adding it to the veggies. The boiling hot solution helped to soften the veggies.

My family has been making this for years. It has a great sweet/tangy flavor and a lovely, fresh crunch for a warm salad that makes it perfect for all seasons. It's also simple, beautiful, delicious and nutritious - what more can you ask from a dish?

Very tasty - a great new way to use cabbage. Next time, I'll reduce the oil by a tablespoon - it seemed a little bit greasy. I might also add some coarsely grated carrot and some julienned snowpeas.

This was very good, and looked gorgeous. I was confused about when to add the red peppers, so I added them when I combined the cabbage and the vinegar sauce, after sauteeing the cabbage for 1 minute. I thought it was good that way, but if anyone thinks it should be otherwise and could mention it in their review, that would be great.

Excellent flavor, dazzling color. A side dish that will get remarked upon.

I've made this several times, and it's always so colorful and flavorful. I recommend using both red and yellow peppers, for a tri-color effect.
