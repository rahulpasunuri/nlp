Very dry. Sauce did not seep down through the spinach as expected and the result was a dry layer of spinach and a marginal layer of Bechamel and dry cheese. If I make it again I will use half the flour and less cheese so it actually is a sauce or just double the liquid.

To Michigan: Please stop rating and reviewing recipes without bothering to try them first. If you just want to share your own recipes, there is a great forum for them on this site, just sign up, it's free. BTW: as for this recipe, it's fab as a component in other meals (I use it as filling for a puff-pastry pie), but it needs a little more to be a stand-alone dish.

This came out ok, but it was not particularly distinctive. The dish seemed to be lacking something, but I don't know quite what. I did discover, however, when I was looking for something to do with the leftovers, that this made a wonderful filling for stuffed mushrooms.
