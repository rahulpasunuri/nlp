Rave reviews all around. I used whole wheat pastry flour for the crust. I will definitely make it again.

Awesome tart! I lowered the cooking temperature to 350 degrees and did not "prebake" the crust for as long as suggested - I did about 15 minutes with foil and weights and it was fine AND not too overdone as I imagine it would be if I followed he recipe exactly. I love that this tart is not as liquid as pecan pie - a nice change! Delicious served with whipped cream and/or vanilla ice cream!

This tart was wonderful.I too expected a more liquid centre but it is a tart and not a pie. I would also like a rendition that is more "pie-like" but this one is still a keeper. Loved it and didn't change a thing..had the last piece a week ago (I froze several pieces from thanksgiving and it was still delicious.

This tart was delicious and I will definitely make it again. However, next time, I will decrease the oven temperature for the tart crust to 350 degrees so the tart crust will not get so dark. The crust was slightly over-browned.

Oh oh oh! Soooo good! Buttery, rich, crunchy. One of the best tarts I've had.

I made this for Thanksgiving and thought it was absolutely wonderful. I used an 11" tart pan (increased each ingredient by 1/3) and I used pecans instead of macademia nuts. I used a very buttery tart crust. I'll be making it again for Christmas.

This recipe was a big hit at the Thanksgiving celebration. Although the filling is not as liquid as I normally like, the flavors blended together nicely. I would make it again, but with a few changes to make the filling more liquid.

The recipe is very easy and it is good, but that is all. I have had better. I would not make it again as there are better recipies
