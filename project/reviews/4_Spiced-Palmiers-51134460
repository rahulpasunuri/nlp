I'm a sucker for Palmiers when I see them in a bakery, but they are seldom as good as they look. These are really good, quick and easy. They are also a more moderate size. Since most of the work could be done ahead, I think they will be nice for parties as well as unusual. However, they may go really fast! I just used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry, which is what was at my grocery store, and not the same quantity as this calls for, but it's hard to mess up butter and spiced sugar. I rolled the dough pretty thin before folding it. Could probably have them cut and frozen. I'm also going to try freezing the cooked ones.
