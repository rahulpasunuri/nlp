This was absolutely amazing! I used berry jelly instead of currants and frangelico liquor instead of the framboise

This is a home-run recipe. Other than time spent baking, it comes together in about 10-minutes. I have been baking this tart for years. Pears, nectarines, and apples are all good substitutes for plums.

Fabulous. I had to improvise a tad and used about 1/3C whole wheat flour, since I ran out of white. My tart pan is 10" so I added a little extra of everything. Didn't have red currant so I used strained ligonberry preserves. Everyone loved it - the room was silent while eating and everyone ate every bit on their plates!

My family would like me to make this easy recipe daily. A family fave.

This is delicious! It's easy to make, but looks very pretty and impressive. My only problem was with the cooking times given. The crust definitely took less than 30 minutes to bake--maybe only 20 minutes. I found that the filling took about 10 minutes less to cook too. Even still, an awesome recipe overall--just check on it before the times given.

Used sliced almonds because that is what I had on hand. Next time I would toast them, though, to bring out more flavor. Will use the crust recipe for other sweet tarts. It's terrific.

Pretty good. I had to refrigerate the crust dough before I could roll it out, as it was quite sticky. My Santa Rosa plums are pretty sour; next time I make this I will have to sprinkle the tart with sugar before baking. I also strained plum jam to use instead of current, and used kirsch instead of framboise. These changes worked fine.

Delicious! Loved the combo of almond and plum. I used pear brandy instead of framboise & it tasted great. I forgot to glaze it as it was cooling so I glazed after was totally cool, & no problem. Will make again since my tree is FULL of ripe plums.
