1) Recipes are not considered original works of art, and are copyright protected. Which means that the protected wording has to be copied exactly to trigger the protection of the statute. Therefore, re-wording the recipe does defeat the copyright. 2) I added orange segments, celery and mint, - the recipe came out great.

You can't really claim that a recipe this basic (generic, if you will)is "stolen." I've been making variations on this "theme" for over 25 years! It makes a great "base" to show off your creativity. I like to add some capers, Feta, Kalamata olives and maybe a dash of Dijon and lemon juice -

This recipe is a great base, but very bland on its own. Adding fresh basil, 3T chopped capers, and a drizzle of balsamic made a huge difference in the favor quotient.

Addendum to previous review: it appeared in issue #46 not #42 as I stated.

While this is an excellent salad recipe, I am dissappointed in the fact that it is a copy of a recipe that appeared in Saveur issue #42 back in 2000. Seriously, rewording a recipe slightly does not make it an original. Proper credit should have been given.
