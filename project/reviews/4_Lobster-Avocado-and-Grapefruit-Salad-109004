This was fantastic. I made it for a first course for a dinner party for 8. I did 4 times the dressing quantities which was exactly right. I used Alaskan King Crab instead of lobster, because it was easier to get, and it was fantastic. I would like to try with lobster too but my husband says he thinks the king crab is better. Really great dish, and the dressing complements the crab/lobster perfectly - great flavour that doesn't overpower the seafood.

I took some short cuts - used frozen langostinos from Trader Joe's and the refrigerated, unsweetened ruby red grapefruit sections. I don't like grapefruit unless it's sweentened in some way which made me think I might like it more in a savory dish. Additionally, I added fresh parsley to the dressing and added toasted, sliced almonds on top. This was really tasty, light and lovely in appearance. I'll definitely be making this again over the summer.

I substituted with sauteed garlic shrimp and served immediately. LOTS of garlic. Was really good!

I gave this recipe a "good" because how can you go wrong with lobster, grapefruit and avocado but I have made a far superior version (a Martha Stewart recipe) with hearts of palm and a nicer vinagrette that includes white wine vinegar.

Absolutely amazing! I made this for a best friend's birthday dinner and she could not get enough. I used lobster tails that I esteemed for 5 minutes and chilled. Then I melted butter at low heat and place the tails on it and basted them with it right before serving to bring them at room temperature. I tripled the dressing. I also added mango that I had on had. OMG! She has requested to have this every birthday for the rest of her life.

Really great combination of flavors. Per other rvws. I doubled the dressing, although I didn't use it all. I also used an entire avocado, though that was a fairly small one as well. I cheated and bought 2/3rd lb. cooked meat. It was a lot..2-3 tails etc. I served this for our main course with some roasted potatoes and bread on the side. Definitely use arugula!

This was a perfect start to our Valentine's dinner. I used lobster claws, which was cheaper and easier than buying a whole lobster. In the future I would use the whole avocado. I did not use all the dressing, but mixing in some of the grapefruit juice is very tasty. I would even make this with just avocado and grapefruit for non-special occasions.

Light and elegant. I would have liked more dressing, and next time I will use all the avocado. I used frozen lobster tails, thawed. I cut the shell with kitchen shears down the length, and then steamed for 5 minutes, then remove shell and refrigerate. We had a lobster tail each, but as a first course we could have shared one. You really do not need to fuss with a whole lobster for this dish

Delicious! My husband grilled lobster tails for this salad which gave it a great flavor. Easy to make and take - I kept all of the ingredients in separate containers and put them together when we reached our destination. Very nice with rose wine and wowed our foodie friends.

I was searching for a special recipe to make as the entree for a Hollywood Bowl concert. This is definitely it! I made it exactly according to directions (except I used lobster tails from Costco which ended up costing only $8 each!). I steamed the tails, chilled them and put everything else together at the last minute. It is as fabulous as all the other reviews indicate. Using top quality ingredients, they all shine, right down to the olive oil, arugula and sea salt. Everything can be done ahead and arranged at the last minute. Try this.........you won't be disappointed!

Made this again with those King crab legs (I'm sure they're very nice but I didn't mean "kind" as I noted below). The dressing really makes it. Served it with the spicy corn and crab soup also from this site and it made a great summer meal. Cheese and crackers for dessert. Yum!

Made this with some left over kind crab legs (sorry! they were on sale and we steadmed tons! and everything else exactly as written. This was wonderfully balanced, refreshing and looked great. Will definitely make again.

I have made this salad now a half dozen times. It is wonderful. I have used all sorts of ingredients because they were on hand and have never been disappointed with the substitutions. Romaine vice arugula, vidalia onion vice shallot, and king crab or shrimp instead of lobster. All depending on what was in the freezer. Definitely a keeper

This was delicious. I made the dressing in a mini-prep and added fresh mint and basil leaves. (since I made for 6 people, there was more olive oil and lemon to work with). I had individually flash frozen lobster pieces from Costco. After defrosting, I tossed it with a tablespoon of warm melted butter and let it stand for a few minutes. I added marcona almonds and also shrimp. I used pre cooked frozen shrimp (not the baby ones, 30-35 size, I believe) which I marinated in olive oil and mint for ~2hrs before adding. The flavor and texture combination of the ingredients was just stellar.

Made this for my husband for Father's Day. He loved it.. . .particularly the grapefruit with the lobster and avocado. Used romaine hearts instead of arugula as that is what I had on hand, but think it would be much better with the arugula.

The combination of shellfish, avocado and grapefruit is fantastic! For more of an everyday dish, use shrimp instead of lobster.

I made this salad for my first wedding anniversary dinner and it was absolutely fantastic. We liked it so much that we made it a day later minus the lobster. Great recipe.

Simple and delicious! I made this as the precursor to my Valentine's Day dinner. It is a meal in itself!

I just made this salad with a handful of modifications. I subbed crabmeat for lobster, and pomelo for grapefruit (I just like them better.) I also added asparagus spears for crunch, and a dash of lemon pepper for an added kick. It turned out great! Paired with a glass of white wine, this is a wonderful light supper on a hot california night!

Just made this dish as an appetizer and it was execllent, receiving rave reviews. Very simple and a nice combination of flavors. I made the recipe exactly as noted. The tangy arugula is key...

Rating: 3
This is an easy-to-make, sophisticated dish that presents beautifully and tastes great! But the grapefruit, avocado, lobster and greens all fall on the soft/juicy end of the spectrum, leaving the salad begging for some crunch! Next time I make it, I'll throw in some roasted nuts or some fried onions for interest.

This was a delicious starter coarse for Valentine's dinner. Whole Foods had precooked lobsters, which saved a lot of time. Everybody loved the salad! Arugula is the right greens for this blend of flavors.

Amazingly good and easy. I bought my lobster at the supermarket and the fish counter steamed it for free while I finished my shopping (most supermarkets will if you ask). Made the prep work super simple since all I had to do was shell the dang thing! A definite keeper.

This is a really nice starter salad. I add just a little mustard to the dressing and skip the shallots. If you're like me and just can't bring myself to use a full lobster tail in a salad, never fear -- its perfectly delicious with shrimp. :o)

I have been wanting to make this for a long time, but kept wimping out because lobster is so expensive. I finally gave in and made it last night and LOVED it! It was worth the cost of the lobster. The only problem I had was sectioning the grapefruit, I ended up with tiny little pieces because I found it hard to take the membrane off. After I told a friend of mine what I had for dinner last night, she suggested next time I go to a local seafood market and ask to buy just the claws, she said they usually sell them for about $15 for 5lbs, which is a lot cheaper than buying the whole lobster. I will definitely make this again, and add toasted nuts next time.

I added cooked asparagus and substituted green onions for shallots. I thought it was delicious, light and loved the grapefruit with lobster combination.

Very interesting flavors that worked really well together. I substituted shrimp for the lobster, which was easy and worked well. I need to practice sectioning my grapefruit! I couldn't find any plain arugula so I used a "spicy" salad green mix.

I sat down to enjoy this salad, got half way through it, and smacked my forehead- I forgot the avacado. When I chopped it up and added it, the salad went from "missing something" to a perfect balance of flavours. You really need the fattiness of the avacado to contrast the tart grapefruit. The only thing I would add to this recipe is a dose of fresh cracked mixed peppercorns, and maybe some homemade, buttery croutons from a stick of beautiful, artisan french bread. Fab!

Delicious! I used rock shrimp instead of lobster (frozen raw, from Trader Joe's, which I thawed and boiled for 3 minutes and then chilled). Other than that, followed the recipe exactly. Very refreshing and satisfying!

I wanted to suggest to the reviewer from Vancouver, how to section a grapefruit. I have not tried the recipe yet, but researched it with the intent of doing so later. Take the grapefruit in one hand and use a sharp, pliable knife, preferably with a thin blade, in the other, and start to peel it, going deep enough to cut through the white part of the peel, all the way from top to bottom. Then, go back and remove any bits and pieces of white that you see. After that, take the knife to one side of a segment, very close to the visible membrane, and cut downward to the bottom of it. Tilt the knife while it is in this position, so you can pop the segment out. Go to the next segment and repeat, all the way around. When you finish, squeeze the remaining membrane part that you have left to remove all juice. You can do this with oranges as well. We winter in Southern Texas, where wonderful pink grapefruits are a daily part of our diet. I usually section out a bunch of them, so they are ready for eating with little effort. I hope this will be helpful to you, and to others who may not know how to do this.

this was a fabulous combination of tastes and textures. We may try fake crab meat as an easier and cheaper alternative next time.

To the Milwaukee cook: the dressing is the part where it tells you to combine the shallots and lemon juice, and then whisk in the oil. It's just a very basic vinaigrette. Can the cook from Maine who recommends frozen lobster suggest a brand that would be best (coming from the lobster state!). Thanks

Refreshing and elegant salad. I doubled the recipe to use as a main course and barely got that 2 1/12 lb. lobster in my pot! Also, drained the grapefruit sections in a strainer and added the juice to the dressing, giving me delicious leftover dressing to use on greens the next day.

This was really good! I actually left out the lobster and doubled the amount of avocado for a friend who doesn't eat meat and it was still great! Loved the combination of flavors, and can't wait to try it with the lobster!

I used Prawns, which were very very good. The most difficult thing that I found was cleaning the membranes off of the grapefruit.

Made this as an appetizer course for my Valentine's meal. Couldn't find precooked lobster at the market, so opted for rock lobster tails, which were killer to crack and remove the meat from! Once accomplished though, the flavors of the lobster, grapefruit and avocado were perfect together. Maybe I'll try shrimp next time for a cheaper alternative.

Instead of lobster I used some imitation crab and it was delicious. I served on valentine's day with my girlfriends and they loved it. This one is definitely a keeper!

My husband and I loved this. It was simple with nice combination of flavors. I served it on Valentines Day with the smoked salmon and herbed crepes and venison in green peppercorn sauce. I bought the lobster already cooked which made it a lot easier. I used less lobster than the recipe called for as it was just an appetizer.

I made this with shrimp because I am not very experienced and I know nothing about lobster. My husband and I loved everything about it! It is such a perfect combination of flavors.

This salad is spectacular! The grapefruit gives it a juicy touch and the dressing is perfect. I bet a couple of crunchy nuts would bring it up a notch.

The dressing is pretty simple - it's the lemon, oil, shallots in the middle of the recipe. My husband loved it. I must say, I've never cooked a live lobster in my whole life and just didn't have the guts to do it tonight (plunging a live lobster into a pot of boiling water?) and I wimped out and bought that fake lobster in the package. Definitely not the right thing to do! The recipe really deserves the real deal. Couldn't find frozen in our sparse New Orleans stores and I didn't want to venture into the Whole Foods crowd on Valentines Day.

Wow, this is awesome! Very easy and sensuous dish. We added toasted walnuts because I had them but I'll bet pine nuts would be even better........shrimp would probably be good too......definitely a make again

Easy and elegant. Made it on a weeknight for a light dinner. Had to adjust the seasonings in the dressing a few times, mostly because I didn't have any shallots on hand (used scallions which I did have) but would make it again & would serve it at a dinner party - easy & impressive. Bought cooked lobster tails from the market. Do not understand why the recipe doesn't just suggest purchased lobster meat - you can get great quality frozen now. Don't bother with the mess of cooking one lobster just for this salad.

This is a great combination of flavors, and looks incredibly elegant. And it's quick to prepare if you use cooked lobster meat, which I picked up at my local Citarella. I used a very strong, peppery arugula, and wouldn't want to use anything milder - the flavor really stands out combined with the tangy grapefruit. Sprinkling with coarse salt really makes a difference! I will make this again and again, even without the lobster for a lighter (and cheaper!) lunch.
