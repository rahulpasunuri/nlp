I have made this several times wonderfully simple, fresh and bold fresh flavor. I even have used the tomato butter pancetta on bruschetta for parties and it gets rave reviews!

Great sauce recipe. I made the filling, but also added some garlic. Also made the pasta and made a wild mushroom filling at the same time. I mixed the ravioli and used the same sauce: _divine_.

This was one of the best things I have made in awhile. My husband and I are very adventurous cooks(he's an ex-chef). I did substitute the butter for olive oil, but it was still absolutely fabulous and very easy! My husband was totally bowled over! Will definitely make this again! Yum!!!

I have made this for years, always to rave reviews...the trick to keeping the wontons intact is to not allow any air to remain within the filling...I start on one side and press outward to seal the wonton, then do the same working from the filling out.Also, just simmer them , a rolling boil will tear them up in a flash!!!! The butter issue...use a bit less than needed to keep the cooked wontons from sticking together...then I just add the whole deal to the sauce...Being a huge onion/butter fan, this recipe is right up my alley...and my family & friends also, I guess!!!! Can't wait to make again!!!!

Delicious! We made this for company as a side dish to sauteed scallops. It had rave reviews. Would definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
Loved it! I didn't add the arugala/shallot mixture to the cheeses. Instead I served it as the base layer & put the ravioli's on top, with the tomoto/pancetta butter on top of that. It looked beautiful and was a very nice melange. Also, I used egg roll wrappers so that the raviolis were big. I'll make it again just like this.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe which we have served to guests at least three times. All were very impressed. I served 1/2 of the ravioli fresh at one dinner party and, at the next, boiled the remaining frozen as recommended. They were just as good that time. The won ton wrappers make the ravioli nice and delicate. I had no problem with any of the ravioli opening during cooking either.

We made this with pasta dough and not with the wontons. We loved the filling. Definitey delicious. Didn't like the sauce though. Cut down on the pancetta and a bit on the butter. used olive oil in the bowl and it was still way too heavy. Really took away from the delicious filling we thought. Would definitely make the filling again. Maybe with a bit of simple brown butter with pine nuts and golden raisins next time.

Rating: 1
After reading such rave reviews of this, I decided to make it as a second course for a dinner party for 15 "foodies" and I have to say, I was most disappointed. I actually made the filling twice thinking I had too much shallot but wasn't too happy when I purchased everything and did everything again only to find it was still very bitter. I was lucky that enough wine had been poured by then and it wasn't too noticeable!

I hated the wonton wrappers. I found them to be slimy and unappealing. The 3 stars is for the filling recipe, which is yummy! I'm even tempted to buy a pasta machine to make real ravioli!

Rating: 3
The flavors of these ravioli are fabulous!!! However, I'm totally flabbergasted that Bon Appetit continues to substitute fresh pasta with wonton wrappers. The taste and consistency are fine but they are TOO thin! Stuffed pastas are all about creating the right ratio of noodle, to filling, to sauce--wonton wrappers just don't cut it. I made these a second time with fresh pasta and I'd give 'em 5 forks if I could.

Rating: 4
I could not find wonton or eggroll wrappers at the grocery store, but did find sheets of fresh pasta for lasanga. I cut this into squares for the ravioli casings and it worked perfectly. No problems with water leaking in as others had noted. It really does come out beautifully with great flavor.

Rating: 4
This review is solely for the ravioli as I made a homemade vodka sauce per my sister's request. The ravioli came out fabulous. I used eggroll wrappers since that seemed the only thing every grocery store I went to had. I also added some ricotta to the filling since I was serving 7 people. I ended up with a lot of filling and the making of the raviolis was pretty tedious, however well worth it. I paired this with a ceasar salad topped with lump crab meat as a starter. Perfect New Years Dinner, my guests raved!

I am assuming we must have abnormally large shallots at my supermarket because with "3 large shallots", it was a ton of shallot-ness. Two would have been plenty. I made 42 ravioli and had at least 8 oz of filling leftover (I'll add more goat cheese and arugula and make more or lasagna or something). So, other than the slightly overwhelming onion- y flavor, they were pretty darn good. Also, I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of chopping up plum tomatoes since tomatoes don't look so good this time fo year. Next time I'll use the big size can instead of the normal sized can. The pancetta was a little salty for me, but my boyfriend was LOVING it. The sauce was so easy, I will definitely make it for other pasta, it would probably be better for something that's less flavorful than this ravioli though.

Rating: 3
The pancetta was too salty for my taste, I might try reducing the amount of pancetta or perhaps use a soy bacon for a healthy alternative. I actually cut this recipe in half since I just made it for my husband and I and I still had enough ravioli for 4 people (at least for a 2nd course of a 4 course dinner). I can't wait to try a little pesto or simple butter-garlic sauce. Any tips on helping the ravioli not stick to to each other after cooking??

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe, well worth it if you use the wonton wrapper shortcut. I made pasta dough from scratch for the ravioli, and I'm not sure I will do that again for this recipe. It wasn't quite delicious enough when all was said and done to merit the fresh pasta dough. My recipe yielded 36 ravioli, using 1 1/4 lb pasta dough. I made them a day ahead and froze them until I needed them--be aware that this increases the cooking time, as the frozen pasta brings the temp of the water down. Seems obvious, but just to let you know. I also put the glass bowl with the melted butter in the oven before I put the cooked ravioli in it, to help them stay warm. Don't scrimp on pancetta/bacon...the salty crunch it brings to the table garnered several compliments.

Rating: 4
this an excellent recipe, and much easier than expected. to ensure that the mixture didn't fall out of ravioli, i crimped the edges with a fork. following other reviewers suggestions, i didn't add as much butter to the sauce and also didn't place the cooked ravioli in butter, there really is no reason. i also used tomatoes that had been canned from last summer instead of fresh, i'm sure canned from the grocery store would work just as well. it is delicious!!

This is the best!! It does require a bit of prep work - but the fact that you can freeze them, well it's worth it! I make this almost everytime we have company, per my husband's request for "the great ravioli." I have found ways to make it faster and easier - using turkey bacon instead of pancetta, canned roma tomaotes (tastes the same), and using a small cookie-dough scoop to fill the ravioli. I can't say enough about the incredible taste of this dish!!

Well, just wonderful! You have to be careful to seal off everything. I made my own pastdough and ravioli, which had a fresh flavor to it. I'm going to try and leave out the bacon next time and use ansjovis instead.

Rating: 4
This is a real winner! Have made it multiple times with the same great results. Try making extra batches of the ravioli and freezing them (uncooked). When you've got some extra summer tomatoes, just take a few from the freezer, boil them till tender and serve with a little diced tomato sauteed quickly in butter. Wonderful.

Absolutely incredible! I made this for a dinner party at which there were 2 professional chefs. They both raved and asked for the recipe! I would cut down a bit on the butter though.

Rating: 2
Wonderful flavors, but I also had trouble getting a good seal on the ravioli and the result was quite watery. Too bad, because the wonton wrappers seem like such a great trick and we enjoyed the taste very much-- just too water-logged.

Rating: 4
Unbelievable combination of flavours! Easy to make and a huge hit with all ages.

Rating: 1
I'd love it if someone could tell me where I went wrong. My filling leaked into my boiling water, despite a good seal, and the wonton wrappers had a very unappealing texture when they were cooked. The whole thing was a water-logged, squishy mess on the plate. Also, I wish I'd read the reviews before I made it. I also would have cut way back on the butter...

Amazing--and tastes like it takes a lot more work than it actually does.

This recipe is the bomb! My boyfriend and I made fresh pasta instead of using the wanton wrappers and left out the butter in favor of olive oil. We did not use all of the filling and the next day made bruchetta with the leftovers - mmmm, it was so good!

Rating: 4
I can't recommend this recipe enough - although it requires a bit of prep work, the result is amazing and tastes like something one would order at a 5-star restaurant. I use bacon rather than pancetta and it's incredible - great way to impress guests and most of the work can be done ahead of time allowing the cook to relax a bit pre-dinner. This one always leads to requests for the recipe!

Rating: 3
A really good dish. I used all olive oil--a couple of tablespoons to saute the shallots, and then just a few tablespoons to mix with the tomatoes, pancetta, and herbs--and it was still dee-lish. Could also work really well without the pancetta or bacon as a vegetarian dish.

Rating: 3
Will try this recipe again using less butter and more olive oil instead. Made it with fresh pasta rather than the wrappers. Also substituted spinach for arugula. worked out great.

Rating: 3
Delicious, but for one thing: wayyyyyyyy too much buttah. Try using olive oil in the bowl after cooking, rather than the soak in butter. The ravioli themselves, though, and the tomato sauce (with, once again, less butter, are winners. As for those who hate the wonton taste, just get the thin, non-eggy ones and you won't know the difference.

Rating: 3
delicious recipe!! I made this for my family and friends, and they all loved it. definitely one to make again. I did freeze some (because it was time-consuming to make) and cooked them after one month (fine) and about 3 months (no good!) I wouldn't freeze for more than a month.

My daughter and I made this recipe for Sunday dinner. Instead of the wonton wrappers we made our own pasta dough, a first for us! It turned out very well, and though time consuming, it was worth the effort. I think that combining the filling and the tomato-pancetta butter and serving it over fettucine would also be delicious and very easy.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I used store bought gourmet goat cheese ravioli and it was great! I could not get over how good it was. The second time I made the ravioli with the wonton wrappers. Even though it was time consuming it was well worth it!

I don't think the wonton wrappers really worked in this recipe. It was still nice overall, but I could not get away from the feel of wonton soup. The pancetta and goat cheese worked beautifully together with the sweetness of the shallots. But you should make your own pasta dough - not much more work and better results.

Although I bought good-quality wrappers from my local chinese grocery, the wonton skins ruined the dish for me. They were at best a gross approximation of fresh pasta, due to their distinctive eggy, metallic taste. Furthermore, the texture was very odd: one diner remarked that it was "squidgy," and the other, a medical student, said that it was worryingly similar to the membrane of the large intestine. The filling, however, was lovely.

After reading some reviews, I also used baby spinach, and did not do the butter sauce. Instead I just made a simple tomato sauce. I thought the ravioli's were very flavorful, and actually were not that much work to make. I made this for company and they raved. Definitely a keeper, but I recommend a light tomato sauce.

This recipe is so wonderful. So many wonderful flavors. I replaced the wonton wrappers with real fresh pasta. Bought the sheets and then cut them into squares. I have also made the sauce just to put over fresh fettuccine. Incredible and easier.

Loved the ravioli, very easy and delicious BUT the tomato-pancetta sauce was horrible. Way too greasy. I threw away the sauce and opened a can of tomatoes and diced them up some fresh basil and olive oil. Fantastic! I think these raviolis need a fresher sauce due to the goat cheese.

I followed this recipe exactly. We loved it. But after reading some of the other responses, I look forward to playing with it. I never cooked with arugula before and had my doubts about it. I don't like goat cheese at all. I think it tastes like a goat smells. So what drove me to try it? I am desperate to make my own ravioli without the hassle of pasta making. This was my intro to won ton wrappers. I am so thrilled. My husband rates my meals and this one got an A+. Thanks.

Rating: 3
This recipe was delicious. I couldn't find the wonton wrappers, so I substituted fresh lasagna noodles (blanched for suppleness). Next time I will search for the wanton wrappers so it's less time consuming. I also substitued baby spinach for the arugula and it worked like a dream! This is a great dinner party recipe as it is easy to prepare and can be made in advance. Combined with a ceasar salad - wonderful!

While preparing this dish, I was mentally writing my negative review-I thought for sure I wouldn't like it. I was wrong! I thought it was very good and very tasty. I liked that it wasn't loaded down with a tomato sauce. I made a few minor changes: basil instead of arugula, added a few cloves of garlic to the shallot mixture and cut back on the butter.

Rating: 4
This was a fantastic dish. Like another cook, I used basil in place of the arugula. I can't comment on the sauce as I used a homemade tomato sauce in place of the butter sauce. What is great about this one is that I've been using it as a springboard for different filling ideas!

Rating: 2
Hated the butter!...Made it way too greasy and not worth the effort. There is no way with the cooking instructions that it will ever look like that picture. I used Hong Kong style won ton wrappers instead of the Sezhaun.. not very tasty. Loved the filling, but I found that I wanted more filling in the ravioli itself.

I thought this recipe was great! The 2 grocery stores I went to were out of Arugula so I decided on Basil instead, which was a great addition. I am not a bacon/butter eater, so I just used regular Ragu (7-herb) sauce. I served this with a small salad for a visiting friend. She loved it! It's extremely easy to prepare. I prepared the filling and stuffed the won ton wrappers the night before -- came home from work and put it on the stove. GREAT RECIPE!

Very good. Wonderful combination of flavors, colors, and textures. With a very simple green salad and a good loaf of bread you have everything it takes for a super meal. And note: of COURSE the tomato's don't look like they do in the photograph. That photo was styled like all food photo's are for magazines. Cooking is a lot of things but one thing it's not is basing a recipe's worth on a photograph...much less a styled one.

Outstanding. This dish is a wonderful combination of tastes, which is what makes it so interesting. One note, watch the cooking time, as the wonton wrappers tend to get quite fragile, resulting in torn ravioli. The tomato pancetta butter is a hit!

A very nice weekday dinner! I prepped the ravioli the night before; it saves some time and allows the ravioli to firm up a little before cooking. I used prosciutto instead of pancetta, and like previous reviewers, used far less butter. Using the wonton wrappers in place of regular pasta also keeps this recipe from being too heavy. We enjoyed this very much.

Rating: 2
I don't have the patience to craft homemade pasta unless it's a special occasion. The won-ton wrappers are much easier to work with, but I do think the dish suffers a bit because of a dough that's meant to be fried. It's easy to end up with slimy skins. Be careful with the cooking time. An alternative might be to fry the ravioli (which is what I do). The end result is a nice appetizer.

Rating: 3
Great! I used spinach instead of arugula and made a tomato-basil sauce instead of the butter. It was lovely. I had some leftover wonton wrappers from making pork dumplings, and was skeptical that they would work for ravioli, but I would definitely do this again. They were very light.

This recipe is absolutely delicious and surprisingly easy to make. I've already made this one twice -- once using pancetta and once using proscuitto. Both results were quite good. It will, no doubt, become a standard part of my "repertoire".

The goat cheese & arugula filling was fabulous. This is a very rich dish, so next time I'll cut down on the butter and use only 2/3 of the pancetta (slightly too salty and overpowering). I had difficulty with the thinness of the wonton wrappers (a few ravioli tore), but practice may make perfect -- I'll try doubling up the wrappers with a coating of egg white between and see if that's a suitable solution. The filling is what makes this recipe a hit!

This was yummy and not that difficult but I would make some changes. I thought it was too buttery and so I would cut it way down or use a bit of olive oil instead and the sauce tastes so fresh I don't think it needs pancetta or bacon.

Delicious - have to admit to changing the sauce. Found myself without pancetta, so... I sauted the tomatoes in very little butter, added thyme and some Italian sausage (which I cook and keep in the freezer to add a little flavor to things) When done, I added about 1/4 of a cup of whipping cream, it was really good. Sprinkled on the basil leaves, but left off most of the butter. Husband loved it.

Rating: 3
This was a nice change. The wonton wrappers worked well, and the egg white really helped seal them. I cut down on the bacon (I used turkey bacon) and eleminated the butter the second time I made it. I used spinich instead of arugulla. I thought it was wonderful and I would make it again, and make some extra and freeze it. The only time consuming step was filling the wrappers. My dish didn't look like the pic, but it tasted wonderful.

We LOVED this recipe!!! We didn't get nearly as many won-ton wrappers out of the standard size package as the recipe indicates (we got about 24-25). As such, we cut the amount of butter in half. It was perfect!! Cut down on the butter and I would highly recommend this recipe! I can't wait to make it again.

We served this as a side w/ grilled tuna. It appeared that we had prepared too much of the pasta, but it was terrific and disappeared quickly. Our first attempt at ravioli, a bit time consuming even with the benefits of the wontons, but worth it. The sauce did cook down and did not appear as the picture, but was wonderful just the same. As others have suggested, we used much less butter.

Yuck. This was awful. If you like authentic Italian food, the wonton rappers just don't cut it. There was also too much butter and the tomatoes cooked down to mush (I cooked under the specified time). Wouldn't recommend it.

I thought this dish was delicious! I substituted spinach for the arugala and found it worked quite well. I made the raviolis the night before which was a real time saver. I couldn't get pancetta, so I just used bacon, which worked just fine. I din't fine it too buttery at all, but I usually don't get offended by rich foods. My dish didn't look at all like the cover picture. My tomatoes cooked down much more that they probably should have, but I thought it was delicious nonetheless. I'll definitely make this again!

This dish is like drinking butter. It is too rich and way too time consuming for the end result. The won-ton wrappers are great for ravioli, but this dish should be called butter ravioli with butter on top. Substituting margarine doesn't work, but maybe adding some wine would. There are better recipes out there.

This dish was fantastic. It is time consuming to make so do the ravioli a day ahead of time if posssible. I will definitely make this again.
