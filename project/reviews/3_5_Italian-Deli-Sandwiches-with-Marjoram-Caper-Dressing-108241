This sandwich is a big hit with my family and have made several times. I agree with the previous reviewer in regards to using oregano vs. marjoram. This is the perfect picnic/beach sandwich!!

I made this for a party and so I doubled the recipe. Rather than cutting it into four large sandwiches, I cut into smaller sandwiches and served at room temperature. They were a huge hit, and absolutely delicious! If you have trouble finding fresh marjoram, you can substitute oregano since they're in the same herb family. I had to start growing marjoram just so I can make this sandwich!
