I made this recipe to fabulous results. I did make a couple of deviations. I cannot get clam juice in Holland, so I used 1/2 cup more wine. I also added garlic and 2 chopped roma tomatoes. The result was fantastic. I high recommend this recipe.

This was fabulous! I prefer mussels in white sauce, my husband prefers red, so I added a can of diced tomatoes near the end and they were a real treat! Don't forget some good bread for soaking up the juice! This is a Friday night standard at our house.

My wife and I enjoyed this dish, but I think I'll make some changes for next time. It seemed like there were more shallots than necessary, and the sauce needed another, maybe subtle, flavor. Overall pretty good though.

This was my first time trying to make mussels and this recipe was just lovely! Simple with delicious flavors. I added some chopped tomato at the very end just before serving for some additional color. I will definitely make it again!

Fabulous made just like the recipe! My husband said it was at least as good as any mussels you'd get in a fine restaurant.

This is the best mussel dish I've found! I keep making it again and again. I use half mussels and half clams, and be sure to have a lot of crusty bread to dip in the delicious broth.

I have made this recipe repeatedly since finding it here several years ago. It remains one of the most popular, most requested dishes from my dinner guests. Absolutely wonderful and so easy to prepare! Definitely a keeper!

Mussles need Garlic, we loved this recipe but I will give it a 3 1/2 forks without the garlic... next time I make this I will add a bunch!! otherwise totally yummy!

Wow! I replaced the bay leaves with one teaspoon of fennel seeds and served it with a salad of watercress, romaine, fresh fennel & grapefruit vinaigrette (also found on this site). With a nice, citrusy Sauvignon Blanc it was a match made in heaven! My only regret was that I didn't have a fresh pan of Lemon Squares to follow it with.

A wonderful, easy to create, wholesome meal. You can't have too much fresh bread. The broth is made for sopping up. Matched with a simple green salad, and an ending of fruit and cheese, and you have a fantastic dinner. Wonderful!

I used 1 small onion and 3 large shallots; I didn't have clam juice so I used a very light chicken stock; I didn't add the cream. Given all those changes this may not count, but it was really really good.

Delicious! I made this as the main course for my boyfriend's birthday dinner (five-course meal) and he loved it! I used a mixture of both mussels and clams --a flavorful and easy dish! Not to mention the broth, it was superb!

Excellent flavor. Wonderful with crusty french bread and a good wine. Next time I will add a bit of crushed red pepper flakes to the broth to give it a little kick.

I've made this with out the whipping cream and added lemon juice instead of clam juice and it still turns out perfectly. My father, who hates mussels couldn't get enough. I also recommed adding some chopped fresh basil to the pot, it's fabulous.

This recipe is deserving of 5 forks. Try 1/2t of cayenne to enhance the great flavor. Serve with soup spoons or some crusty bread to mop up the broth. Everyone at dinner raved!!

This recipe is wonderful. A hit with all our dinner guests, they're still calling to ask for the recipe. The only change I made was to add some fresh tarragon to the broth. Fabulous!
