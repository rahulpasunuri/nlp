I definitely would make this recipe again. I don't have an aversion to using corn syryp so I substituted the honey for dark corn syrup and the squares were not too sweet. I put a heavy dose of PAM into the pan and the squares came out in a sheet, use a chopper to cut into squares. However, I strongly recommend a heavy duty baking pan, I used such a pan but used another lighter pan and the shortbread and squares were very crunchy and a bit overcooked. Next time, I will lower the temp to 325 and 20 minutes was plenty enough for the shortbread and I might use only 15 minutes for the topping. I like crunchy/chewy but will see with lower temp and less time next time.

They were really too sweet and hard to get out of the pan.

This is a wonderful restaurant; every thing you order is superb. These pecan bars are absolutely wonderful, we always add a little ice cream to the side, or whipped cream on top.

I really liked this recipe with some changes to it. First, I had only refrigerated butter so I soften it in the microwave and I mixed the dough by hand. To have the dough brown I left in the oven for 35m insted 20m. I also used walnuts insted of pecans and added 1/4 cup more of walnuts and 1/2 cup of almonds to try it out. I also followed the first cooker advice to use 1/4 cup corn syrup and 1/2 cup of honey. My husband loved it because it was not so sweet. I will make it again for sure.

like the recipe even more with 1/4 golden corn syrup and 1/2 cup honey instead of 3/4 cup honey. Makes it chewier. Dribble melted chocolate over it to dress it up too.

A shortbread base with sweetish crunchy topping. The all butter shortbread crust made it a rich treat indeed. I have problems getting correct sizes of pans and had to use slightly larger pan. Consequently, crust was a bit thinner, but overall it was a delicious treat and I would definitely make it again. For readers without a food processor, putting the shortbread ingredients on a large board and working them together to form the dough can be very therapeutic. I used to make shortbread this way before I had food processor. As it was, my small f.p. unable to handle volume of flour, butter, sugar etc. so I had to finish the combination by hand, anyway.

The honey made the bars too sweet. Also, the crust did not stick to the pecan filling.
