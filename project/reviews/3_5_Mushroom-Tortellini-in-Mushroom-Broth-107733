I decided to make this becaue 1. it sounded SOOO good but 2. It also has many, many 4 fork ratings. WEll, this was worth it. Dress me up like an alter boy and smack my bottom, this was DELISH!

Loved the filling, loved the broth. Friends slurped it up and asked for the recipe, usually a good sign. My only modifications were to use my own pasta recipe (semolina flour + eggs), and to use vegetable instead of beef stock for vegetarian guests. I'm sure beef broth would have been tastier, but the vegetable broth was great -- very mushroom-y.

How can you not fall in love with home made pasta?! And my weakness is filled pasta. I've made this special dish for my family, but used home-made tomato sauce and it was incredible. It's a special dish for a Sunday- you have to have the time to enjoy making it, put on some music, and have your family over for an incredible lunch! My husband thinks I'm a great cook, but little does he know about my epicurious.com connection!

To gabypalma from el Salvador. Amount of pasta is about 1 pound, according to the link provided to the fresh pasta dough recipe.

Try using some black truffle for the filling, too. The broth was very good, but mine didn't look that much like the picture the first time. 2nd time I added half a "toasted" onion and clarified it afterwards. It was better. I might try this with just a good consommé or maybe with no broth at all and just serving the tortellini as a main with some butter, white pepper and shaved truffle. Very good recipe, will make again for sure and it is very well explained.

The recipe doesn't say the amount of fresh pasta!!!!!!!

This was one of the best I have made since my subscription to Gourmet. I really loved it and it wasn't too difficult to prepare. For desert I made the Baked Alaska Cake. Too bad there was no one to share it with, but maybe next time.

Even though making this was time consuming, it was well worth the taste and compliments. The flavor of the broth was bold, but not too strong. I suggest making it the day before, especially if it is your first time making it. It gets easier and better each time I make it.

Try using aged gouda (1 year) in this recipe instead of parmesan. Its wonderful nutty taste really compliments the porcinis.

I had never tried making my own tortellini and it was a rather exciting process. Much more simple than I had anticipated. I can't wait to do this again. The 'opinions' regarding this recipe had me laughing considerably. Goodness. Who knew tortellini could be so political.

This is fabulous and well worth the time. I'm sure the process will go quicker after the first time. I did use wonton wrappers and it turned out wonderful - rave reviews by all!!

I haven't made this yet, but if I made the tortellini ahead to freeze (i.e. lack of continuous time) what is the best way to freeze for it to keep (and for how long will it keep?)

People who complain that cooking from scratch is "a waste of time" and "tedious" should be making dinner reservations, not tortellini.

I recently made this as a first course for a special dinner. If you are serious about cooking and want to wow your guests, I highly recommend this recipe. It is well worth the time and effort. Like the cook from London, I also make my own pasta because it is superior to most purchased egg pastas. I will definately make this again.

I always make my own pasta, and its not because I have the time, but because it tastes better than packaged. And these tortellini just make it all that much better. Incredible. Remember, these recipies aren't about time, they are about taste, and presentation. Curious.

I may be biased, since i happen to be a huge fan of any mushroom-based recipe. The comments about being time-consuming are idiotic, as one could pose the same argument with *any* home-maded item. If you don't enjoy cooking, what are you doing here? If you do, this dish is well worth the effort.

y'all are a bunch of 'tards. make it if you want, don't make it, use real tortellinis, or fake (store bought) ones. it doesn't matter. I made it and it tastes great with the real ingredients.

I have not made this receipt, but it made my day reading these reviews. What a diversity of people we have.

Absolutely delicious!! Yes, it's a laborious process to make the filling, and the pasta itself (I made homemade beef broth, as well!). The finished product is so tasty!! (premade pasta may be quicker, but compared to this, it's soulless....) I don't have the time and energy to do this every weekend, but for special events, oh yes!!!

I MUST ADMIT TO USING PRE-PREPARED MUSHROOM TORTELLINI IT SAVES PREP TIME... WONDERFUL RECIPE FOR THOSE OF US MUSHROOM LOVERS. MY GRAND-MOTHER WAS FROM TORINO ITALY, AND MUSHROOMS WERE PROMINATE IN MOST OF HER SPECIAL DISHES..

I'm just puzzled at the reviews from people who give this one star because they think this is a tedious waste of time? This is EPICURIOUS (as in Bon Appetit, Gourmet), not fastfood.com or lazycook.com. I mean, come on. Let's face it, if you know a little bit about what you are doing, it's not tough to make food from scratch infinitely better than any commercial food plant. This is an excellent recipe. If you don't think fresh pasta dough tastes better than packaged, you're either "taste blind" or you sure aren't picky.

Sorry, my mistake. I see the forks.

A tip for those unwilling or unable to make the recipe from scratch.....use wonton wrappers for the dough. It tastes great, has a good texture and you won't have to worry about "wasting" your time cooking if that is a concern. Try it, you'll love it!

I'm with Washington!! Cooking CAN be fun! If you enjoy cooking then "made from scratch" never enters into the picture. The flavor was awesome and all ingredients were listed. Keep in mind that when making the tortellinis there's no law that says you can't make a double batch and freeze one to have when you're pressed for time in the future! Wonderful!

To Washington, AMEN!!

This is delicious. I thought the whole idea of viewing recipes on this site was to find the BEST recipes out there, whether that involves time consuming recipes, or fun fast ones. If you do not have the time to spare, or refuse the time it would take, why bother taking the "time to complain" about the time, when instead, you should be "critiquing the taste", which is what the recipe review is all about!

Looks time consuming, yes...but some of us cook for the fun of it...if you are looking for fast recipes, epicurious.com might not be right for you. I have thrown several successful dinner parties, and spent many hours in the kitchen, thanks to epicurious.com and might have sipped a little wine while cooking, but was never high.

I read the recipe twice. Great recipe. All details had been included. Even the cheese crust to add to the broth. Real Italian cuisine. I didn´t do it yet. But will do it pretty soon.

Make tortellini at home from SCRATCH?! You must be high! There are too many good commercial tortellini's out there, fresh (refrigerated) and frozen, to mess with this! Sheesh! What a waste of precious time.
