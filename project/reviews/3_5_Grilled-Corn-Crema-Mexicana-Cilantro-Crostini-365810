This has been a hit all three times I've made it!! It was requested for another gathering this weekend. I love that it is so simple but delicious!!

This was a HUGE hit with the adults and kids alike! Made it for a quick neighborhood get together and they flew off the plate. I did use sour cream and found I had to double the crema mixture as well. So quick and easy! I'm making this again tomorrow night!

I absolutely love this! If you have fresh corn, this is the hors d'oeuvre. I steamed the corn, 3 mins. only, and I put the bread (love the rubbing it with garlic) in a basket, the cilantro, sour cream and feta in a bowl and then cut limes in the third. Let everyone assemble their own. So yummy! I love it when I find a appetizer that can be done ahead of time and is so creative and tasty. Don't pass this one up!

Loved it. Made exactly as written, but used fat-free sour cream and ancho chili powder. Great for a dinner party.

I loved this recipe, but do make sure you have excellent corn - it makes all the difference to the balance of the dish. I used sour cream and feta instead of crema and it turned out very well. So tasty! Also, instead of grilling the bread, I brushed it with olive oil and fried it until it was a little black around the edges, I did the same with the corn - it worked just fine!

I followed this recipe to the "T" right down to buy the crema mexicana. I really wanted to like it but when my wife goes "the after-taste is like stale cheese puffs" I knew this was an absolute failure. Sorry it was not good.

These crostini are absolutely delicious! Be sure to rub the grilled ciabatta with the garlic clove before smearing with the crema mixture-it really makes a difference. I used sour cream and it worked really well. I had to make double the crema mixture to make enough to cover the ciabatta slices. Can't wait to make this again.
