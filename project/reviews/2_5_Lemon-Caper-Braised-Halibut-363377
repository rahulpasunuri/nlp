Almost our first Epicurious disaster. There seems to be something very wrong with the cooking times. We put our lovely thick fillet on for the suggested five minutes. We could tell the cooked side was way too tough when it was turned. Another five minutes would make it boot leather. 60 seconds on the second side made the fish merely overdone. On the other hand, we cooked the tomato mixture for two minutes. The flavours were lovely and there is potential. But forget the times here and cook according to your experience of fish (which we should have known enough to do) and the heat of your particular stove.

I served the spinach as a side with some curry. Otherwise, it was an easy dish and was well received.
