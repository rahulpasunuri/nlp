This is an outstanding recipe. Four forks, because although there are not many ingredients, each serves a distinct purpose in the overall dish, and the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. It may sound weird to be waxing poetic about a sweet-potato hash, but trust me - you want to make this as written! This is on our regular meal rotation - even my 3-year old loves it.

Yu-UM! I made it for dinner - and it was a hit with my husband and 11-yr old son. I don't like watercress so I used spinach and baby bok choy. Didn't use too much mustard. Made sure the spinach and bok choy was quite cooked. My son ate it down and said he LIKED it! It's healthy, quick, tasty, and cleanup is a breeze. It would also be a snap to leave out the ham and make it a vegetarian dish (my older son's girlfriend is vegetarian). Also, I made this because I had sandwich meat that needed to be used up - I liked the thin slices mixed in.

My husband loved this! Very good and will try with bacon if I don't have ham next time. A real keeper!!

This was good, but I thought the ham was a little overwhelming. I like the idea of bacon as mentioned by a previous reviewer and might give that a try the next time I have a spare sweet potato on hand.

A wonderful, tasty way to use up leftover ham and a spare sweet potato. Makes a nice change from the usual hash brown or rosti.

This is a great hearty brunch recipe! It was so good, my boyfriend had to switch to a spoon to eat it up! (spoons ARE more efficient) I made one really significant change, substituting bacon for the ham in recipe. I fried up the bacon until soft in the frying pan, and used the bacon fat to continue the recipe as directed, leaving the bacon in the pan at the same time. It came out great, with nice little crispy bits of bacon in every bite! I recommend you try this version, if you don't have ham on hand.

Should you make this? YES! Should you make it exactly as written? YES! My husband who normally has to be asked whether or not a recipe is a "keeper" made sure I knew he wanted this one saved after the first few bites. He also doesn't like yams and was very skeptical when he walked into the kitchen and saw them. So easy and delicious. Why is this recipe not reviewed more if it has been out since 2005?

This was excellent and great the next day too. I didn't have any greens so I chopped up a green pepper and added it with the onion. Will definitely make again.

I am not giving a fork rating since I used this recipe as a starting point and modified. What I made was delicious, however! I roughly followed the recipe except used scrubbed, unpeeled sweet potatoes, a big squeeze of brown mustard (no horseradish), 1 link of chicken andouille diced and spinach instead of watercress. I added some water with the mustard to loosen it up and for better mixing. Served with fried eggs. Definitely worth making.

We made this last night for dinner using leftovers from our Easter dinner. I didn't have any Dijon mustard, so I used a couple big squeezes of coarse grain mustard. We cut back on the olive oil and left out the greens. I had some leftover buttermilk biscuits from weekend breakfast that I split, toasted and served the hash on top of along with a fried egg. This was a wonderful and quick weeknight dinner that made a big dent in the amount of leftover ham we had. Most importantly of all, it tasted awesome! I'd even go buy ham to create leftovers just to have this again!!!

OMG! This is a keeper. Served to my husband for dinner last night using fresh spinach instead of watercress. Absolutely delicious and will keep this up my sleeve for any meal.

This was really, really yummy and perfect for those thanksgiving leftovers. The mustard really gives it a nice kick.

This is a really nice change from your standard weekend breakfast. I made it with scrambled eggs and omitted the watercress. I also used pre-cut sweet potato fries (about 1/4" diameter) from Costco, and cut them into 1" matchsticks. They cooked up perfectly fine this way.

This hash was really yummy. Made the recipe as directed. Wouldn't change a thing and I will make it again.

very tasty! i used spinach instead of watercress and prociutto instead of ham (and added it at the end). i've never had sweet potatoes in a breakfast dish before... it was fantastic. very simple!

I used this recipe with what I had on hand: ham, cooked cubed sweet potatoes (from "roasted sweet potatoes with lime syrup" recipe), onions, dijon mustard, and horseradish. It was so delicious I made it again to use up the rest of the leftovers that were supposed to be dinner.
