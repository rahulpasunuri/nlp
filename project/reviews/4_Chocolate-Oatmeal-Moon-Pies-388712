These were a great hit. I didn't have dried tart cherries so I used orange infused dried cranberries. They worked well. Be careful about the cookies overcooking. Instead of 7-8 minutes, I think 5-6 minutes after the oven rack flip flop would be better. I did 7 and I think a minute or two less would have been perfect.

Made a total of 17 medium-sized moon pies. Used an ice cream scoop for uniformity. Substituted dried cranberries (about 1/2 C.), used regular chocolate chips, sub'd pistachios (about 2/3 C) and added a pinch of cinnamon. Skipped the chocolate drizzle. They turned out great and I'll happily make them again -- "plain" or as moon pies!

I didn't bother with the moon pie part because the cookies themselves were so delicious.

I made these for a birthday celebration, and they were a huge hit! These cookies have great flavor, and I honestly didn't find the marshmallow creme too sweet at all. I did assemble mine the night before out of necessity, but I watched them as I set to make sure they didn't shift too much. I also just melted bittersweet chocolate for the drizzle on top. These are very tasty solo as cookies or as Moon Pies. The whole batch is already gone!

Enjoyed these quite a bit. The marshmallow fluff oozed out, however. Next time, i will use less as a filling. The cookies alone would also be a treat but the filling and chocolate drizzle take it over the top.

These were very good cookies. I found the same problem with the marshmallow fluff oozing out of the cookies. I actually prefer the cookies without the fluff anyway, because they became too sweet.

I thought they were good but they were really big. If I make them again I'd only use about 1T for each cookie. I ended up cutting some of the cookies in half.

This is a very fun and tasty dessert. The cookies came out great although I found I needed about 5 minutes less than the called-for cooking time. My only suggestion would be to wait to assemble the cookies until you're ready to serve them. My marshmallow fluff oozed out within a few hours. This could be because I put too much fluff, but despite not looking very nice, they were still delicious.
