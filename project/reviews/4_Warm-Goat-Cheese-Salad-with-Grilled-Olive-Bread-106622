Excellent dressing. We added cold sliced beets for color and taste. Toasted the olive bread in the toaster and drizzled lightly with olive oil...it worked fine.

I did this recipe for a progressive dinner. It was SO easy and you can prepare it all ahead of time. The goat cheese was exceptional with the panko. DO NOT use bread crumbs, ugh. The dressing was so good, everyone was using the bread to soak up any drop of it. LOVE the olive loaf too. The combination of flavors with the dressing, the cheese and bread was great. I was receiving compliments days later!!!

I make this recipe over and over! My family absolutely loves it...even my teenage son. Sometimes I add salmon to the salad to make it into an entree. The contrast of the mellow cheese to the vinaigrette is wonderful.

I made half the salad recipe as written (I used my own dressing and omitted the bread). I thought there was a lot of panko to herb ratio, I would up the herbs next time. I would also use higher heat and a shorter cook time for the cheese rounds - to keep the cheese from cooking too much and changing the texture. Very tasty and would definitely try again

Outstanding salad. I made it almost exactly as described, however, I topped the salad with mini crabcakes. The dressing was nice - flavorful but did not overwhelm the goat cheese.

This was a wonderful salad. I actually have been making one similar to it for years. This time I combined the 2 recipes and it was fabulous. For my dressing I used olive oil, red wine vinegar, minced garlic, dried oregano, basil and thyme and salt and pepper. I sliced one can of pitted black olives. I actually, used California colossal black olives as they aren't quite as strong in flavour as greek olives. (Although,of course greek would be just as delicious!) I also, used regular bread crumbs as I couldn't find panko. I sauteed the goat cheese in butter and placed on the baby greens. I proceeded to add the olives and vinegarette to the pan and sauteed for 3 - 5 minutes. Letting a bit of the vinegar burn off. It warmed the dressing and the olives. I sprinkled over the greens and the goat cheese. I brushed the olive bread with olive oil and toasted the slices in the oven. This recipe has always been a hit but now it is an even bigger hit. The breaded goat cheese made my recipe that much better. ENJOY!!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. The warm, soft and crunchy goat cheese with the soft greens and silky dressing are a texture and taste treat. I use the Vinaigrette recipe for a lot of my salads with slight variations each time I make it. It's the perfectly proportioned vinaigrette.

This was really simple but good. Next time I will double the dressing. Grilling the bread didnt really add anything to the taste, I will omit that step next time.

HUGE hit! I brought as my contribution to a party, and the host in charge of main dish asked me for this recipe - what an honor! I fried the goat cheese rounds in olive oil, and had a little trouble there, but I think I probably didn't let the oil get hot enough. Dressing was perfecto!

Served for Christmas Dinner. Huge hit, would let the goat cheese rounds cool a little longer next time.

The goat cheese prepared this way is fabulous. However, like some other reviewers, I didn't care for the dressing at all--way too strong and mustardy. I will make this again but will substitute the 2T of dijon with 1 T of Traders Joe's Hot and Sweet mustard (this is a staple at my house as it is great in salad dressings and dips). I also love the idea that someone had of toasted cranberry bread...goat cheese and cranberry together is heavenly!

This is an outstanding recipe. I have made it twice so far. Both times without the olive bread. The first time I used regular bread crumbs because I couldn't find Panko, and I used my own dressing. The second time I used the Panko, but the regular breadcrumbs worked far better. I also used the dressing from the recipe for my second time and it was outstanding with the goat cheese. The first time I added candied pecans, and the second time I added grilled shrimps that I had brined first, then marinated in a spicy garlic paste. It was a meal beyond compare. Next time I will include the olive bread, use the mustard dressing, add shrimps and it will be a meal vs. an appetizer.

I ended up just making the olive bread portion of this recipe and serving it with a different goat cheese salad that I make. The bread was absolutely fabulous.

A wonderful salad and the goat cheese and olive bread complement it so well. I brushed the bread slices with garlic olive oil and then toasted them. Huge success! Served with GRILLED LEG OF LAMB WITH SPICED MUSTARD AND ROSEMARY, and a baked potato. This was a royal meal and the family was delighted. This meal would impress any guest...rich so not an everyday, regular meal, but yummmmm!

I made this for a dinner part with friends I hadn't seen in years. I didn't have panko so I ground up french bread croutons instead and they worked fine. I believe any breading will do.. panko just tends to be crisper and coat well. I added sundried tomatoes to the salad, and used honey mustard instead of dijon. I also added a bit of white wine to the dressing.. all of these dressing changes to cut the strong mustard taste down. My guests loved it so much they kept eating it after I brought in the main dish!! It was a hit and easy to make. Tip: slicing goat cheese with dental floss makes for nice even slices and no crumbling.

The cheese rounds do very well in the deep fat fryer; also panko bread crumbs aren't worth serching for, regular bread crumbs are just as good.

I only gave this 2 forks because I didn't care for the dressing. I like mustard, but it was too mustardy and heavy. Would make again with a different dressing. The warm cheese rounds made an ordinary salad special.

I have made this many times. I always use fresh basil for dressing, but have cheated and used dried herbs and seasoned bread crumbs for the breading. It's always a hit.

I made this salad for New Year's Eve and everyone loved it! Not only was it delicious, but the presentation was spectacular!! I added candied walnuts, and roasted fresh beets around the outside of the plate (not mixed in), and it just added and extra visual elegance to the salad. Give it a try for sure.

Absolutely wonderful. I have made this on numerous occasions and prefer my own dresssing of olive oil and raspberry vinegar. I also saute some grape tomatoes in balsamic vinegar (cooked down to a syrupy consistency) with a little kosher salt and serve warm on same plate. A keeper.

I didn't do the olive bread, but did the salad with warm goat cheese - got rave reviews from my guests. It was marvelous!

I have made this salad over and over again and everyone always loves it. I use the garlic/herb seasoned chevre and it is fabulous. I usually add spiced walnuts to the salad and a little honey or sugar to the dressing.

As a very lite eater, I found this salad so delicious. I loved the dresssing. It paired nicely with the cheese. I made some fried red tomatoes from the same issue, instead of making the bread & cutting out the carbs, I poured myself a lovely Sauvignon Blanc from South Africa & called it good! Really good!!

I enjoyed the crispiness of the goat cheese and the overall texture of the dish. I think next time, I would make two smaller cheese rounds rather than one big one - just for the sake of more crunch! What I wasn't thrilled with was the dressing - but that's just a matter of personal preference. Next time, I'll make one of my own instead. Overall, it is a nice salad, I only gave it two forks b/c I really did not like the dressing.

My guests said this was the favorite of their four course meal. The dressing was wonderful and the herbs on the cheese were perfectly complex. I made my own panko breadcrumbs by baking a white bread in the microwave using the following technique: oil the 9x5 microwave-safe loaf dish and place batter inside. Microwave at 50% power for 1 minute and let rest 10 minutes. Repeat this process 1-2 times until dough is just doubled. Microwave on full power for 4-6 minutes until top of dough is no longer moist. Cut slices of bread and dry for 2 days on a rack. Place in freezer bag and crush with rolling pin to make fine crumbs. I hope this helps some (one of my guests can only eat unbleached, nonbromated flour so I make this with King Arthur flour).

We tried this recipe when it first came out and have made it many times since for company and special occasions. Its just wonderful. The crunchy panko is great with the soft goat cheese. Everyone we've made this for has loved it, its become one of our favorites.

We loved the goats cheese although its consistency wasn't what I expected. I will try a different, smoother type the next time. Salad greens were OK.

This is a new favorite. Although a bit more work than I would usually put into a salad (should have done the dressing the day before) worth every minute. My guests were quite impressed and the goat cheese looked so sophisticated!

Excellent salad! Loved the dressing, and the panko coated goat cheese was delicious! I recommend using chevre goat cheese, which is mild and creamy. I served the salad with toasted cranberry bread, which complimented the cheese nicely! Great for entertaining, guaranteed compliments!

Very intense flavors. Both my picky husband and father-in-law enjoyed the salad.

This salad was a dissapointment. We love goat cheese and the picture in Bon Appetite was so beautiful. The goat cheese rounds had a very strange, almost grainy consistency - maybe I cooked them too long or maybe it was the brand of cheese I used. The toasts were really good. I couldn't find olive bread and used rosemary bread instead. I'll make those again and use with a different salad. There is another similar recipe from Bon Appetite using sauteed goat cheese rounds that also has pears and walnuts in it that is much better.
