I really like the flavor of these wraps. I usually use chicken thighs, but today I dumped all of the ingredients in the crock pot (with frozen boneless/skinless breasts), skipping the browning with butter part. I can't believe how simple it was to do this way, and it turned out so much better than the normal way. The breasts shredded so easily with tongs. I'm going to prepare it this way from now on.

I too used boneless skinless chicken breast and it turned out very nice. I made this as a main course, keeping the tortillas whole, and although it was messy it was very good. I added about a teaspoon of sour cream to each tortilla. Definitely best as a summer dish.

This was a delicious meal. I followed the advice of another cook and steamed two boneless chicken breasts and shredded in to a bowl before adding to the onion mixture. I also used a light butter and olive oil instead of the regular butter to try to lower the fat. I served this over some blue corn tortilla chips and loved every bite. I will definitely make it again.

We thought these were delicious. The shredded chicken was excellent for so few ingredients--I think I will use it again as the base for tacos. My only problem with these is that they didn't hold their shape when I cut them (I don't think I rolled them tightly enough), so I served them cut in half.

I've been making this for years but as a wrap for lunch rather than as an appetizer. Perfect to make ahead and bring along when you're invited to someones beach house or for a picnic!

This recipe was just ok. It was kind of bland, not much flavor. My guests really seemed to like it, but I was not impressed...

I live by myself in Japan so it's nice to not have to cook every evening. I cooked the chicken for this recipe and it lasted for two dinners and two lunches. I just cut the additional ingredients each day before my meal. Pleasant flavor combination. I always welcome an excuse to eat an avocado.

I used 2 small chicken breasts rather than legs, and substituted 1 TBSP olive oil and 1 TBSP margarine for the butter. I boiled the chicken breasts until thoroughly cooked, and shredded them in a bowl. Then I sauteed onions in the olive oil/margarine mixture, and added the shredded chicken. I also put the whole tomatoes in my food processor and coarsely chopped them before adding them, along with 1/2 cup boiling water from the chicken, to the chicken mixture. The only other addition I made was to drizzle some light ranch dressing on before rolling up the wraps. My husband and I are trying to eat healthier, and making these the night before makes an easy lunch the following day. Using all white meat, and substituting olive oil cuts down on the fat grams. These wraps have great flavor and are filling. I would definitely make them again.

Very good although a bit time consuming to make.

I thought this needed some fresh salsa and more salt to bring out the flavors -- with those editions, these were tasty, albeit quite messy, wraps.

Really delicious. Prepared the chicken in my pressure cooker to cut the cooking time to 20 minutes, then just reduced the sauce as directed. I cut the wraps in half, and served as the main course. Perfect warm weather, fun food.

I have made this a few times after trying it at a party and asking for the recipe. It's really delicious, especially in summer. The flavors go together nicely. Can be a little messy in preparation, but well worth it.

For the Fledgling Cook....I have not made this recipe before but something like it. The tortilla should be rolled through the spiral not just on the outside. If they are individually rolled in plastic tighly and tightly twisted on the ends, refrigerated for at least an hour before cutting then they shouldn't look like flat tires. They sound good and will try soon.

We liked these wraps a lot. We tried them with and without shredded cheddar, and didn't feel like it added anything but calories. The flavors are good on their own.

I enjoyed this recipe but have a question about how to roll the wrap. I didn't have 12 inch tortillas, so I used the ones I had, which were probably closer to 8 inches. I wrapped the tortilla around the entire contents, and it made it around the insides without too much too spare. When I cut the wrap into rounds, however, the rounds were more like flat tires. This made me wonder if you are really supposed to wrap the tortilla like a jelly roll, so that the tortilla itself is interspersed with the inside ingredients in a spiral. Is this the correct way to roll these?

Great as a low fat dinner! I used a pre-cooked rotisserie chicken and saved an hour or so!

These are a little messy and take some prep time but well worth it! Even the kids liked them!

I made this recipe to bring to a beach house party, I had many excellent reviews. The flavours are so fresh, a perfect summer dish. I have been asked to make them again and I will, the only change being to add a bit more zing to the chicken mixture with additional spices. I made the chicken mixture the day before and assembled the wraps (1 1/2" diameter) in the morning, tightly wrapped them in cling film and cut them at the party. They held together perfectly! Even the guests that did not like the individual ingredients alone loved these wraps.

I've made this several times. The wraps are pretty easy to make since you can prepare everything while the chicken cooks. I like to add a little cheese to my wraps. The shredded chicken is also a great based for "make-your-own" wrap/burrito gathering adding cheese, rice, and beans as options.

Made these for a party and they were a hit. Cooked the chicken a day ahead and prepared the wraps early in the day of the party. Will definitely make them again.

Made these as lunch-sized wraps and loved them. But can't see that they would hold together in a miniature hors d'oeuvres form. Were a little sloppy. (Then again, maybe it's just ME that's a little sloppy!)

I made this recipe twice- once as hors d'oeuvres for a party, and once as full-size wraps as part of the main course for a dinner party.FANTASTIC!They are a wonderful mixture of yummy texture and taste.I added extra cumin the 2nd time around,for an added zing..these are terrific!

Delicious. I had cooked shredded chicken on hand so I just made the sauce and stirred in the cooked chicken. I also didn't make them into hor d'oeuvres but just ate them whole as sandwich wraps.

I made the chicken the day before and that sure made these quicker to put together when I needed to. These do need to be wrapped very tightly and the ingredients well distributed. The taste is very good without salsa. I only used 1/8 tsp. of cayenne and a can of diced tomatoes undrained. I think the suggestion of using them as wraps for dinner is good. Then I would include some leaf lettuce if for immediate consumption.

These were delicious, and SO easy! ...especially if you cook the chicken mixture the night before. Just be sure to roll the wraps VERY tightly. Mine were a little loose, but I fixed them with tooth picks.

Made these for a party and they were one of the first dishes to go. These require some work so not something you just throw together, but well worth the effort. Will be making again soon.

Rather than an appetizer - I made these as a wrap sandwich. The chicken was prepared on the weekend, and then I just added the cucumbers & avocado and wrapped them - an easy, quick work-day dinner. I substituted tomato juice for the 1/2 cup water. Also was great for lunch the next day!

This is one that I make time and again. I have catered many lunches and it is one of my staples. Everyone always enjoys these and they look great. I use coloured tortillas which add to the presentation. Hot, with a touch of cool cucumber. Wonderful and EASY to make

Recipe idea is good - added Tex-Mex seasoning, garlic and cilantro to sauce; used 1/2 cup juice from tomatoes instead of water - provided better flavour. Also made wraps with jalapeno tortillas. Suggestion for sealing wrap - with a pastry brush, brush sealing edge with water, tomato juice or lime juice before rolling and wrapping in plastic wrap

The preparation was somewhat lengthy - but the results outstanding. Everyone raved about them at the party - and where the first thing that vanished! They were quite impressive looking - as well as yummy.

This was just OK. I made these for a party, and while they looked great, they didn't just disappear like everything else. I didn't like the cucumbers in the wraps, but the chicken treatment was good. Also, they didn't hold together that well. It was a pain in the rear to prepare that much cilantro, but I think with a few changes, these could go from so-so to outstanding!

This recipe has worked very well as a make-ahead appetizer that only gets better by sitting for one day (well-wrapped), and cut just before serving. Perfect party food. I can't imagine what the reviewer meant by not looking very good when it's cut, because by cutting it diagonally, one gets a spiral of brilliant colors. It is only as big as you want it to be. I cut it about 1 1/2 inches long, so that it is more or less bite size, and every bite is packed with flavor if the ingredients have been distributed as the recipe calls out. It's an incredibly easy recipe with a great flavor. The roasted cumin chicken treatment is very rich; I understand how it could not be eaten as a roll-up sandwich. When I make this app, I use different colored lavash wraps or tortillas, like pink sun-dried tomato tortillas, or green pesto lavash. The presentation is gorgeous. Put them on an oriental dish, some horizontal/some vertical on a bed of scallions, and your guests will ooh and ahh over them. It's a standard recipe on my file.

This is yummy. However, I would make it a casual meal, keeping the wraps whole or putting the mixture into shells for crunch. I would add roasted pepper salsa and cheese, and garnish with sour cream.

didn't look all that appetizing after slicing up the wraps. A little difficult to eat and frustrated that you couldn't get all the flavors in one bite. This a 2 - 3 bite appetizer

This recipe was not only quick but good as well. I added a honey mustard dressing when completed. It added a sweetness and a zing at the same time. If your pressed for time and need a quick meal this is the way to go. CookinDiva Brooklyn,NY
