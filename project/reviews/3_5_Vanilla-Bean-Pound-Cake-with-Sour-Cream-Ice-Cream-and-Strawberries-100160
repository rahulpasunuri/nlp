my baking pan thatw as holding the cake dish became covered in oil- the butter seemed to have leaked out from the cake and cake springpan. did not change recipe except did not put in vanilla extract and used only the bean.

Just a follow-up to my previous review - tried a slice today, and if anything, it tastes even better than it did yesterday - I'd say 3 1/2 forks. On top of everything else, this cake is a breeze to make - just make sure your butter and eggs are room temperature, and follow the instructions regarding beating.

This is the first pound cake I've ever made, and it turned out very well. The flavour isn't as vanilla-y as I would have liked, but I have doubts about the quality of the vanilla bean I used. Next time I think I'll double the extract as well. Lovely, dense but smooth texture, and it tastes like 'more'. My cake baked in exactly the time stated, and turned out (I used a bundt pan) perfectly. Oh, and just to note, a traditional pound cake has no chemical leavening - that is baking powder or baking soda. The leavening comes from beating the butter and sugar to trap air bubbles, which is why most recipes state it's critical to have all ingredients at room temperature. This does make a BIG cake, and I'm tempted to use any leftovers in a trifle, or in place of biscuits in a VERY decadent shortcake, as it's strawberry season.

This is a great recipe. I, too, thought it was strange that the recipe did not call for milk or baking powder but it turned out great! I made this for a children's birthday party so iced it with buttercream and served with store bought ice cream. People couldn't stop raving - several told me it was the best birthday cake they had ever had. I agree with the cook from Scotch Plains, this is a fabulous alternative to the citrus pound cake and it is much, much better. It was a bit of work, scraping the vanilla bean, zesting the lemon, etc. etc., but it was completely worth it. Last note: mine baked in only an hour. Don't depend on the listed baking time.

Overall, I liked this recipe, but I thought that it makes an obscene amount of pound cake! The next time, I think that I will cut the recipe in half and bake it in a loaf pan.

Excellent pound cake. The vanilla comes through beautifully and gives this pound cake a wonderful flavor. It's a great alternative (and I think better) than citrus flavored pound cakes. This is now my primary pound cake recipe. I cheated and used vanilla bean paste instead of a vanilla bean. Also, my vanilla extract is double strength. But I still added the full teaspoon and it was not too much. Excellent!

uhm... i believe you may have missed the part about the sour cream ice cream... i think that effectively substitutes for the milk, and it turned out just fine with the ice cream and no baking powder. i hope that helps!

I don't know what everyone is raving about. There are 2 crucial ingredients missing. 1 cup of milk and 4 teaspoons of baking powder. I searched and found three other recipes with the same sugar/egg/flour/butter proportions and they all had milk and baking powder. Hellooooo epicurious... this is weird!!

This is the only pound cake I make anymore. My husband, who is a pound cake fanatic, prefers this to all others.

Very moist and delicious. I modified the recipe slightly by adding vanilla bean instead of extract.

Cake delicious - I used sliced fresh strawberries with no added sugar and frozen vanilla yogurt
