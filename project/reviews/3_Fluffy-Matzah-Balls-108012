We made two separate batches with this recipe. Both came out great. Here's my suggestions: -Definitely refrigerate for several hours. -Use seltzer instead of chicken stock. Without any baking soda, the seltzer IS your leavening agent. -Whip the eggs REALLY well. Again, trying to create as much air in your product as possible. I used an immersion blender. -When you're making the balls, handle them as little as possible. Rolling them in your hands too much will break down any air pockets that have formed. -Don't let the mix sit for too long in the fridge. I let the 2nd batch rest overnight in the fridge and the top of the mix became firm but the bottom of the bowl was a little runny. Still made good balls, but they weren't as easy to shape. Overall though...great recipe!

OK, I'm confused. Everybody here used the same recipe. Half turned out light, the other golf balls. What caused the difference?

these were delicious matzah balls. i shaped them a bit bigger than indicated so i ended up with 11 balls of varying sizes. i used goose fat and seltzer, and followed the recipe exactly. my only complaint would be i wish i had used higher quality chicken stock for the soup, which would have made everything perfect.

I agree with the cook who said they were like golf balls. Mine turned out hard like rocks...certainly not fluffy. I followed the recipe perfectly. Use the recipe on the Streit's box...it's a sure winner.

I made these exactly as called for. I don't know what I did wrong, but they were hard dense golf balls. I'll try again using a larger pot and try the club soda instead of the chicken stock.

I only refrigerated 1.5 hours, which may have been my downfall, but there was nothing light or airy about these. They were absolutely delicious, regardless. Used previous poster's tip about the chopped fresh parsley...added a nice little herbiness.

The best I've ever made, and I don't make sinkers! I added a small handful of minced fresh parsley to add some color and flavor. Very light and fluffy. My guests had thirds.

These were wonderful, truly fluffy and so good that I plan to make them again tomorrow (even though there's a few servings still sitting in the fridge). Don't even bother with the other matzah ball recipes on Epicurious - I've tried them and they're like golf balls. These are like buttah! I added some dinosaur kale and matchstick carrots to the broth for added nutritional value. Speaking of which, don't skimp on the broth - these are quick to make but a good homemade broth is a must in order to do these floaters justice.

This is the same recipe on the back of the Streit's box.

Mom, this recipe is as good as Jewish home cooking gets.

Very good matzah balls if you like them light and fluffy!

This is almost exactly the recipe I have been using for years. I saw it in the New York Times Sunday Section, it was made by the mother of author Eric Segal. Only thing I do is use only club soda, and I add 1 tablespoon of freshly chopped parsley to the mixture.
