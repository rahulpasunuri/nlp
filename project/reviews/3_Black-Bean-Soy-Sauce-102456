Next time I will use 1/4 cup soy. this was really salty. I substituted the fermented black beans with a can of black beans. Made the sauce thick, I liked that better.

I made this sauce to go with the whole catfish and it was great! I couldn't find the Asian black beans so I substituted half a can of regular black beans and it worked fine. I figured the soy sauce was salty enough that I didn't need the salted beans too. I will use this on many different meats and not just catfish.

How would it do to substitute Teriaki Sauce for soy sauce and put over deep fried chicken wings? I had someone's "secret" recipe of Teriaki Chicken Wings over the 4th of July holiday. They were really good. I know they had black beans, Teriaki Sauce, and onions. Outside of that, the recipe was "secret"!!!!!
