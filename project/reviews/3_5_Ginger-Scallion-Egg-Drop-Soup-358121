It's OK, but we vastly prefer Hot & Sour Soup.

the eggs and chicken make it nice and filling. i didn't taste the ginger very much, maybe because i used regular, not low-sodium, broth...

Really simple & tasty. I added mushrooms.

Simple, super reliable. I also like a Japanese variation using dashi instead of chicken broth, and sometimes using tofu instead of chicken. Cut-up dried shiitake mushrooms and a smidge of miso top it off. But then it's kind of a different soup altogether...still good though. :)

I actually followed the recipe to a T for a change and the flavor is superb! Crushing the scallions was a nice touch, and the white pepper is essential. I think the chicken could be poached slightly longer than 15 min though. Very simple but impressive. I forgot to drizzle the sesame oil but will try that next time.

Very easy to make and came out pretty well, but we added some soy sauce. It's very tasty!
