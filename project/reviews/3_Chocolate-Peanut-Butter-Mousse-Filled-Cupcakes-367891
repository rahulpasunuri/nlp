These cupcakes are very good and fun to make but there area a lot of steps and the ingredients are expensive. The peanut butter filling and the chocolate ganache are both excellent and can be used with other desserts. I wasn't that happy with the way the cupcake itself turned out. It was rather dense and not as moist as I would have liked. Overall though a very delicious dessert.
