Used frozen strawberries, required additional cup of buttermilk. Flavour and texture still good.

This is beautiful and so summery! I did a really rough blend so there were still chunks of strawberry in the mixture and then I froze it in my ice cream maker. The aeration by the ice cream maker made it much easier to scoop out when it was time to serve. I added a dollop of whipped cream -- so good! I'm making the next batch tomorrow night with fresh peaches from the farmers market. Can't wait!

I've made this recipe now twice in 3 days, and it has been a major hit for everyone to whom I've served it. It is so incredibly simple and SO incredibly delicious and full of summer. I can see making this all year long with different fruits. I bet it would be fantastic with peach and raspberry. It does get rock hard in the freezer.

I've made this three times now. It is a brilliant recipe -- so fresh- tasting, and feels like a real treat even though it is guilt free. I substitute an equal amount of Splenda for the sugar and find that it tastes just as great. It's best to work in small batches when processing the frozen mixture into the creamy end product. Otherwise the machine gets bogged down and the whole process takes longer. I place the finished product into small plastic containers; that way I have individual servings that soften faster.

This was a delicious, I loved it. I layered it with lowfat whipped cream and the leftover strawberries that I marinated in some sugar and cognac. My hubby thought it was a little on the sweet side, but he sure finished all of it! I am definitely going to try this recipe with other fruit. yum yum yum!

This is so easy and delicious. It does get really hard in the freezer, but it's worth the effort of chiseling out a helping.

This is unbelievably good. My favorite version so far is to make the Ice with lychees. Beyond delicious... Oh and my tastebuds are very sensitive to sugar so I cut it down to 1/8c - 1/4 c and it was still plenty sweet (did this with both strawberries and the lychee version). It's a great way to use up your buttermilk after buying it for pancakes!!

Really great recipe. I used agave syrup instead of sugar. I will try to use melon and honey next time

We loved this! I think this will be a staple in my freezer (using one variety of fruit or another) all summer!

Delicious. I also made this with raspberries, and then I tries a blend of berries. Very yummy.

i'm in love--this is easy, delicious and healthy. i've made this with strawberries, and i'm going to try using frozen mangos tonight. i'm not sure if using frozen fruit will make a difference, but it's so easy to make that i'll give it a shot.

A great basic recipe. I also made it with peeled, pitted fresh peaches instead of strawberries - fabulous. Then I tried fresh blueberries. It would be good with any fresh seasonal fruit - but you would have to strain berries for seeds. Not like an ice cream - more like a sherbet. Okay to use low fat buttermilk.

Easy, yummy, inexpensive and healthy. Doesn't taste like ice cream, more like a gelato (or ice...). Excellent for those stinking hot days when you can't bothered eating.
