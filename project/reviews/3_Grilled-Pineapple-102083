I've made this several times; it's so easy to toss these wedges on the grill after preparing a summer meal. I now remove the peel before grilling;slice wedges crosswise before serving with high quality ice cream; and drizzle caramel or butterscotch over top.

I wasn't impressed at all with this recipe. The picture looks way more apertising than the actual finished dish. The boyfriend wasn't too impressed either.

A little tip: Try melting butter and brown sugar in pan to bubble, than add some spiced rum! Great over the pineapple to serve with BBQ OR dessert or over ice cream!YUMMMY!!

This is very good but we prefer to roast our pineapple. Peeled, cored and cut into even-sized spears, the pineapple is placed in rows on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Brush with melted butter and sprinkle with golden brown sugar. Bake in a 400 degree oven for five minuted. Turn slices over, brush with more melted butter, sprinkle with more brown sugar and return to oven for a further 5 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature. Delicious with a big scoop of Haagen-Daz vanilla icecream. Great because you can prepare it earlier in the day, plate it up, and it looks very professsional with its caramelized surface on a white platter decorated with mint leaves.

Grilled pineapple is really exotic and delicious! You can also peel the pineapple and cut lengthwise into 1/2" thick pieces.

Pineapple is a fruit that gets better with grilling. Its pretty tough so it doesn't get soggy and its acidity somehow seems to mellow out as it gets warm. Make sure not to grill it too long and its nice diced with a minty dressing.
