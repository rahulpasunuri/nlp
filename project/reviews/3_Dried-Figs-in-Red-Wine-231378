This was disappointing, and I'm glad I tested it before serving it at a Spanish dinner party. It was surprisingly challenging to find Mission figs, and I settled on those from Sunmaid. They didn't start out soft, and an hour in the oven per the recipe made no difference - the figs were dense and chewy. The accompanying ice cream was similarly dense, and, other than a faint cheese character, had no distinguishing flavor elements. The Sherry Vinegar Sauce's vinegar tang was not offset by the sugar, and so remained too tangy, even against the sweetness of the other components. Forget the vinegar, just drizzle some Pedro Ximenez over it. Guess I'll just do flan...

A friend made these for a dinner party and they were divine. Even had them cold the next day for brunch and they were still delicious.

Nice compliment to the Mahon ice cream.
