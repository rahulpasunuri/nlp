PROCESS IMPROVEMENT: clean chilies of seeds before you toast or soak them - I cut lengh-wise with scissors over the sink and the dry seeds fall out by themselves. Also, reserve the water from soaked chilies and use it with/instead of beef stock. I also found that grinding the cumin (not just the pepper) yourself makes a huge difference (I use coffee bean grinder). I also grind the corn flour to make it finer before I add it. Everyone loves this chili and no one believes that there are no tomatoes or prunes or coffee in it! GREAT RECIPE :)

I made this with different fresh chiles from the grocery store (poblano, serrano, anaheim, fresno) because I couldn't find the ones in the recipe. It was still delicious! Would made again any time!

Great chili recipe. First time to make a bowl of red. I had grown up on midwestern chili, with lots of beans and crushed tomatoes. Good, but not great. This chili is miles ahead of what I grew up with in terms of flavor. Great beef flavor and definitely complex heat from the chilis. Tried hard to stick to the recipe, but used bacon grease instead of lard and added a few canned chipotle peppers to the sauce. I cut my beef chunks a little smaller and they were a little too firm. Many that tried it wanted the recipe, so it must have come out OK. Will be making again.

Made this chili for a Super Bowl party and it was an absolute hit. I think I made have started a new tradition! I followed another person's comments about saving the chili water and I was going to add some dark beer but forgot. Will try next time.

A few tips for the inexpert cooks (like me): "Browning meat" really means you need to place each hunk of meat separately in the skillet, spaced by about the size of the chunk of meat itself. It's a lot of space, but if you don't do that, the steam from the meat cooks the meat nearby, and it turns out grey, and the browning fails. The point of browning is to add the flavor of that brown crust, from the Maillard reaction. Where the recipe calls you to "add water", use the water left over from soaking the chilis. Where it says "let the chilis drain", some might interpret that to mean "toss out the water", when actually it means to remove a chili from the water and hold it above the bowl for a second so the water it is holding can drain away.

Wow! Wonderful recipe. I didn't have dried chilies so I used fresh ones. Roasted in oven to loosen the skins before processing. I like a little bit more texture, so I browned all the meat and let some of the pieces cook crispy. I only wish I would have thought of the final consistency and cut the meat into smaller dices. Recommend partially freezing the meat to aid in the dicing and slow cooking without the vinegar & brown sugar. Add those at end like recipe indicates... enjoy!

Fantastic! What depth of flavour. I made it with the texas caesar salad (also epicurious) and it was an exceptional meal. I wouldn't change a thing.

Uh-mazing! I will never cook another chili receipe that calls for tomatoes. Hubby loved this chili the instant he put a spoonful in his mouth. The next day I added black and kidney beans to make it even more hearty.

Great Recipe! I've made this 6 times- ALWAYS AMAZING. Prefer bison chuck to beef and slow cook it an hour longer than recipe calls for.

It's difficult to find some of the ingredients in the UK, I find both the Guajillo and the Pasilla chiles but could not get the masa harina. For the latter I oven baked (to dry them) then ground up some corn totillas, I still had to use some corn flour to thicken it up. Perhaps I have missed out on some flavor because of this substitute. Despite followng the recipe to the letter, my beef was chewy and tough that was dissapointing after 2 hours of slow cooking. The taste was fantastic and I will try this again with a different cut of meat.

Made this tonight and our guests all raved. I quadrupled the recipe, added beer for a quarter of the water and the pepper liquid for half. I eliminated the remaining water and still needed to reduce for several hours to reach a consistency I was happy with. Did this by removing the beef and just heating the sauce. I will make it again, but would add some spicier peppers, as is it is quite mild. Definitely 4 stars.

WOW! What a recipe! Won neighborhood chili cook-off with it. Used beer instead of water as suggested by a previous review. Decided Modello Negro would be a good dark beer to try and it was perfect! Also added 3 dried habenero to the recipe (doubled). Added just the right amount of heat. In addition to the sour cream and lime I topped it with a few crumbles of queso fresco. This recipe is truly a keeper!

Won a chili cook-off with this recipe! Followed suggestion replacing water with dark beer in step 4. Absolutely delicious chili.

I decided to make this for SuperBowl last year and, despite the fact that the guys nicknamed it "colon blow chili," (I made it with dried habernaros), they loved it and have demanded the legedary chili to be made for SuperBowl this year! The recipe suggests making it in a skillet - I didn't have one last year, so used a pot instead, and it was much waterier than it should have been. I bought a skillet this year, and expect that the results will be much better.

Delicious! I took advice of others, and replaced bacon grease for the lard; using dark beer in lieu of water in step 4. I have fresh roasted Hatch chiles in my freezer so I used those, thus able to skip step 1. I almost always make too much food. Sad I didn't double this recipe as my family of four ate almost the entire batch. Served over rice. Salad alongside.

Made this as written with no substitutions except instead of plain old water I used the water that the chilis soaked in. This was absolutely delicious. The recipe recommends the sauce sit for 30 minutes after cooking and this is a must. In fact the longer it sits the thicker the sauce will become. I served it over white rice and with cornbread. Guests loved it. I will definitely be making it again.

Had it for New Year's Eve dinner for 8. Tried using Italian sausage meat as a replacement for 1/2 of the beef. Excellent, but will probably just use all beef next time.

Outstanding. I used 5 California chilies, three very small red chilis from my farm share (not sure what they were) and one canned chipotle in adobo sauce. The squeeze of fresh lime at the end really brings it all together.

I just won Judges Choice in a chili cook- off with this recipe. Wow! I was a little surprised becacuse I used 6 guajillo chilies and it wasn't very spicy at all. First time using dried chilies. Found it a little difficult to grind the skins all the way down. I had to use a processer because my blender died. Maybe that's why. I used pre- chopped Angus stew meat and thought that might lessen the quality but apparantly not! Thanks, Mr. Lobel

This is recipe is really quite tasty. But to me, chili equals ground beef, beans and tomatoes. That's not to say that this recipe isn't good. It's just totally different to what I'm used to. It's more like a southwestern beef stew/goulash. I used 6 dried ancho chiles as well as 2 chipotles in adobo sauce, which gave the recipe a bit more spiciness and smokiness. I also used bacon like another reviewer suggested, but I forgot to cut down on salt in the chili sauce! Oops... it was a bit too salty, oh well. Served this with sour cream and shredded monterey jack and some corn bread muffins (from the "Easy Corn Bread" recipe).

This is fabulous. I had to tone it down a little because husband doesn't care for spicey meals. I'm sure it is wonderful wioh all ing., but such is life. Anyway this is terrific and it was fun to make. However, I used Canola oil instead of lard (ick) which was my only change. I am going to use the masa harina mixture for all coating of proteins. Love, love, love the chili. Thank you Lobels and Texas.

I made this a few days ago. I loved it. I do not like "filler" in my Chili. Of course like most of you I did tweak the recipe a little.First, I tripled the recipe to no ill effect. When I go through my changes assume I mean for the recipe serving 4. (I tripled everything) I added a beer in place of 12 oz of the water. I added the following spices 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, clove, allspice, 1 tsp corriander and 1 tbs cumin. Instead of using lard or oil, I cooked a few pieces of bacon and sauted the meat in the drippings and then added the cooked bacon in at the end of the recipe. This chili really did get rave reviews. Next time I will cut back a little on the masa (my own taste). Probably use 1.5 tbs. I debated using a leaner cut of meat but was very happy that i used Chuck (it was prime). It added a great deal of flavor to the finished dish. I agree with the other reviewer that the vinegar is key. It really did balance the flavors in the end.

I only used the chile paste from this recipe to add to my own chili, including ground beef, whole pinto, black and kidney beans and sauteed onion. My husbad loves chili with rice, and this was a really, really flavorful version of a really basic recipe. I will definitely make the chili paste again, and I can see how it would go wonderfully with chopped meat. Oh, I also used corn starch instead of harina...I bet the harina would've been even more flavorful!

Sure wish this recipe had a little beef in it. Hah! Loved this. Can't wait for the opportunity to do it again. If you've got an asbestos tongue like I do you'll probably find this a little bit mild but when you're making a chili for a lot of people you've got to play it safe. I'd probably add a couple spicier chiles to the paste if I was going to make this just for myself but it's fabulous as is.

REAL Chili -the way it's supposed to be -no beans or tomatoes. When I serve this people rave. And coming from a native Texan who used to raise Longhorn cattle, I think I'm qualified to give it 4 forks :)

I made this the first time and friends loved it (my first time making chili). Made it a second time and experimented with some different chilies and entered it in a chili contest on only my second time making chili (beanless category of course) and won along with a second place/honorable mention for the most original (was during Halloween and the winner of this category used pumpkins). Needless to say, one can make some great chili while building on this recipe. By the way, I doubled the recipe and used my own judgment to make a first place chili. Try it once as is, odds are you'll like if not love it. Then make it again and have fun and enjoy some more!!

This is the second time I've made this and the same thing happened... way too much liquid. Granted I'm making it in a pot and not a skillet but still, something seems off with the amounts. I am doubling the recipe but beware doing this... you'll never be able to simmer it down and will have to toss about half the sauce.

I used half Ancho chiles and half Guajillo. Used turkey in place of the beef. I will never buy pre-packaged chili spices ever again. This is the real thing. 10x better the next day.

I just made this for the first time and while its still on the pot simmering I can honestly say that I'm impressed so far. I'm not a big fan of kidney beans so when I saw this had no beans in it I jumped on the recipe. I tasted it as it is simmering and I can only say one thing. YUM!

This is what chili is supposed to be, no tomatoes, NO beans - just meat and chillis. One tip, the greater the variety of chillis the better. I am a big fan of cascabels.

Now THIS is chili!! I used ground elk meat because that is what I had on hand. The masa makes all the difference, don't substitute that.

This is my third time making this recipe. Phenomenal! I used a little more dried Ancho chiles, more garlic, substituted ground cumin, and an extra tbsp of masa harina. But awesome either way! I'm from Chicago, but have a friend down in Houston, and she raved about this chili. Made a cornbread with it, broke up some cornbread in the chili, simply amazing. Thank you for the great, easy recipe.

Oh-my-gosh... This chili is SO incredibly good... I've never had anything like it before. The meat is so tender that you don't even need teeth -- seriously. The flavor is complex and not too spicy. I will say this, though: the presentation is rather unattractive, but if youcan get past that, you're truly in for a treat.

Made this yesterday and my wife said it was the best chili she'd ever had. I quit trying to make complicated chilis with coffee, beer, cardamom, etc. This really gets back to what makes chili good- quality whole dried chilis and good beef. For chilis, I used New Mexico, ancho, guajillo, and one chipotle, with the total weight they recommended. Toasting without burning was tricky, and I probably erred on the safe side. I think I coaxed a little extra flavor out of them by soaking them in 2c of water and then using that water with beef stock concentrate to make the liquid. If I had "fresh" beef stock, I would consider soaking the chilis in that. The whole thing had a bitter aftertaste until I added the vinegar at the end- the acid is definitely essential and really made it perfect. The recipe talks about adding "the remaining 2c water" in step 4, but never mentions where that water came from. I just kept adding liquid until the beef was mostly covered.
