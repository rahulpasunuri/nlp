I have used this recipe a couple of times and agree with some of the folks who reduced the egg amount. I went down to two, did two discs of Ibarra (about 6.25 ounces as I recall), four squares of baker's unsweetened chocolate, and maybe a couple of tablespoons of sugar to add back some of the sweetness. Also I only did 3 and 1/4 (at most) cups of half and half and the proportions were still fine. I would have done the whole vanilla pod instead of half, and more than a little pinch of ancho chili powder, but I was very happy with the results (as were our guests!). I didn't strain because our only strainer is way too fine, but next time I'll invest in the normal mesh wire strainer as I think it's worth getting rid of the graininess.

Made this for a holiday dinner (with the Burnt Orange ice cream to go with it) and it was DIVINE. I am not normally much for sweets, but this is not terribly sweet, and has wonderful layers of complex flavor. Guests and my 4yo daughter could not get enough. I followed the recipe and don't think it could have been improved at all.

I made this and love it. It froze to be too difficult to scoop so we cheerfully put it in the fridge and ate it as some of the best pudding ever. I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate, as that's what we had and yum! I love that you don't have to add sugar.

I have been looking for a recipe for mexican chocolate ice cream since Haagen Dazs discontinued the flavor several years ago. The ice cream maker I use suggests substituting egg substitute for whole eggs so I used 3/4 cup egg substitute instead of the 3 whole eggs. Since the egg substitute is already pasteurized, you don't have to fuss over the custard and monitor the temperature. I used all the mexican chocolate called for in the recipe and melted it in a double boiler. I heated the half and half, the vanilla beans (don't forget to save the pod to make vanilla sugar) and one stick of mexican vanilla. Mexican vanilla is pretty easy to find in larger supermarkets. There's usually a small section of mexican spices in sealed bags, oddly enough, I usually find these items in the produce section. I also added a healthy pinch of ancho chili powder to the mixture. I heated the mixture over low to moderate heat until the cinnamon stick started to break down and then I added the melted chocolate. I stirred regularly until the mixture was dark and the chocolate was incorporated. I then took the mixture off the heat, let it cool slightly and added the egg substitute (which I had sitting out coming close to room temperature. I added the salt, stirred to combine, strained the mixture and chilled in the fridge overnight. I froze the mixture according to my machines' instructions and it was fabulous. Take that Haagen Dazs!

I've made this twice. The first time, the product was too 'eggy' and the chocolate was overwhelming. I cut the chocolate in half and only used the egg yolks, and a total of 3 cups half & half. I also added a thai chile pepper and cinnamon stick to the half & half prior to heating, and removed them before cooling the mixture. Far better product than the original recipe, IMO.

I made this for a party. I didn't have Ibarra, so I used a mixture of Vosages 'Fire' and some other high cocoa % chocolates. I liked the flavor, but I found it to be too rich for me. I might try it again someday with 'sweeter' chocolate. The guests didn't go crazy for it, so I don't think it was a hit.

Added 1 tsp crumbled pequin chilies with the chocolate. Also, used good vanilla extract instead of the bean. It was amazing. So much easier than the chocolate chili recipe on this site. Very hot, but so tasty!!

We made it with a mixture of milk and semisweet chocolate we had sitting around, then mixed in some chopped peanut-butter cups at the very end. Excellent! Per other reviews we used 2 c. cream and 1-3/4c. whole milk. Also, only one egg as that's all I had. The flavor and consistency didn't seem to suffer at all.

I didn't use Ibarra chocolate, I used Vosges Red Fire - it has the cinnamon notes along with a little chipotle. I couldn't justify four bars, so I did half Vosges, half bittersweet. I also threw in two cinnamon sticks while whisking the chocolate with the half and half. Phenomonal. It occurs to me that you could melt any chocolate bars into this and end up with a great ice cream. I use the ice cream attachment for my Kitchen Aid mixer and I had a little trouble processing this ice cream. This makes a thick custard that gets even thicker if it's fully chilled. I had issues with the custard freezing against the bowl and stopping the paddle prematurely. I would chill it less than usual so it's still pourable. All in all, possibly the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had.

So easy and so good! I used vanilla extract instead of vanilla bean. It turned out great.

Just purchased my ice cream maker yesterday and I was so excited to make this recipe. The ice cream came out perfectly delicious! I did use 2 cups heavy cream and 1.75 cups whole milk. I also added half a cup of mini chocolate chips to the mix. Some suggestions: To break up the discs, place in a ziploc bag and use a hammer or meat tenderizer to break apart. Also, make sure you completely cool the custard (chill in fridge for about an hour) before you put it in the ice cream maker so that it freezes faster....

This was one of the best ice creams I've ever eaten, let alone made myself. I threw in a small handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips just to bump up the chocolate. Shared with friends and everyone raved. Divine!

Not as sweet as I expected, but very rich. I will definitely make it again.

I made this dish for an ice cream social this weekend. It was a huge hit. I used 4 discs of Ibarra and whipping cream, I also soaked a cinnamom stick in the custard until I was ready to put it into the ice cream maker. I had some Scharfenberger chocolate on hand so I chopped up about 3 ounces and added the chunks to the ice cream. Chocolate, chocolate ice cream. Yummy

I didn't tweak this recipe at all and thought it was great. Next time I'll let the mixture chill several hours before putting it in the machine (I was too impatient to wait longer than 30 min.) so that it freezes better in the machine. But the taste was amazing and after a night in the freezer, the consistency was fine. I'll also take the other suggestions of cinnamon and chile powder next time. Yum!

This is the best ice cream I've ever had. I did fiddle with the recipe (used a higher proportion of cream, put in three discs of chocolate, added an extra 2oz of semisweet chocolate plus an increase in cinnamon and a dash of chile/cayenne pepper), but I'm sure it would be fantastic still without all the extras (and with the vanilla bean - I replaced that with extract, thinking that the other flavors might overpower the expensive bean). My first time using the ice cream maker, and it turned out perfect!

The first time I had Mexican chocolate ice cream was in a little place in San Francisco while on vacation. I fell in Love. I was thrilled to see it in print. The second time I had Mexican chocolate ice cream was in my own kitchen! I've made it at least twice since then. So good I didn't change a thing. The hardest part was breaking the chocolate into smaller chunks. Overall, a careful patient hand is needed, but well worth the effort.

I also tweaked this recipe a bit... I followed the ideas suggested by the cook from Memphis, but I used 2 cups half and half and 2 cups cream. I melted the chocolate with the half/half and added a cinnamon stick and two pinches of powdered arboro chiles into the melting chocolate. It took a while for the custard to freeze, and ended up more in the consistency of gelato than of ice cream, but it was seriously yummy and everyone wolfed it down, including an 8-year old boy (who I'd expected to hate something so non-standard). I can't wait to make it again.

This ice cream ROCKS! I've made several types of ice cream and this consistently comes out on top -- rich, creamy, insanely good. I also used 4 discs of Ibarra, but did everything else as the recipe stated. The eggs won't scramble if you keep the heat on the low side and stir constantly. Though i did get a little coagulation at the bottom of the pot, it didn't hurt the consistency. SO good! I heartily recommend this to anyone.

This is a deliciously different chocolate ice cream. I did make some changes and had no problems with it. I used 4 cups of cream instead of half & half. Melted the chocolate with about 1/2 cup of cream & set off stove to cool some. Seperated the eggs, beating the salt with the yolks and beat the whites to soft peaks. folded the whites into the yolks, combined them with the cold cream put it on the stove and slowly brought up to about 180ºF. While cream and eggs were warming I slowly added the cocolate. Removed from heat and added 1 tablespoon vanilla. Set to cool in refregerator until completely cool. There was no need to strain the mixture as the eggs never cooked and it was cold before freezing so that freezing took the usual amount of time.

It took a while to freeze in our ice cream maker, but the taste was sublime and we didn't have a serious "scrambled egg" problem that another reviewer did. We did tweak the recipe as follows: 1. Added 4 wafers of Ibarra chocolate (not 3.5), or about 12.4 oz. 2. After boiling half & half, chocolate & vanilla bean, we slowly whisked in ~1/2 c of the hot mixture to the eggs/salt, then whisked the egg mixture back into the same saucepan with the rest of the half & half/chocolate/van. bean. This still produced some small lumps of egg, but they came out when we strained the mixture through a sieve. 3. Added ~ 1 tsp of cinnamon before freezing (it wasn't strong enough for our taste). 4. Next time, I would chill the mixture in the bowl for at least a couple hours (with plastic wrap set on the top of mixture) before putting it in the freezer, so it freezes more efficiently. It's pretty decadent, if you ask us!

a huge disappointment. I was looking forward to rich cinnamon-laced chocolate ice cream. what i got was a soupy, bittersweet slop that tasted as if a leftover omelet was thrown in by accident. until i find a winning recipe i'll keep buying the "homestyle" stuff in the store.
