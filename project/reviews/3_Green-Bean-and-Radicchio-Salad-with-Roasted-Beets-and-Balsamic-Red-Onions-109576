This is an impressive dish, beautiful to look at and delicious. I added crumbled goat cheese and used a mixture of endive and radicchio to tame the bitterness. Guests were loved it. Would use a little less thyme.

It has a nice taste but I did not like the flavor of the radicchio.

Lovely appearance and combination, but still a bit oniony for my taste. Also, my beets took at least twice the recommended time to cook.

This has to power to win over beet haters and even onion haters like me. I pre-made each item, and took it with me to a weekend at the beach. I tossed the items together just before serving. I used the 4-seasons dry Italian dressing together with balsamic viniger and olive oil (perfect). It was even more delicious on the third day - even though it was not as pretty to look at.

This salad was very good though it took a bit of work. It pays to make portions ahead just as the recipe indicates. One change I would make would be to put the onions on top rather than on the bottom where they get lost. Leftover salad worked well to be put on the dinner salad the next night for a welcome change.
