Loved having this for lunch on homemade olive bread. I cut down on the mayonnaise, and even still found that it was too much. I used goat cheese instead of blue.

Basic chicken salad with a hint of blue cheese. I made these and toasted the bread a bit which we really liked.

Fantastic sandwiches! Definitely add the dried cranberries and pecans--it adds tanginess and texture that makes the salad stand out. Use a good, creamy blue cheese. I make these every year, especially in spring and summer for picnics or casual dinners. Just wonderful!

This was AMAZING! I love making different types of chicken salads and I was a little leery of using blue cheese, but man, that was JUST what it needed. I had dried cranberries and pecans on hand so I added those as well. DELICIOUS! Instead of kaiser rolls I bought crossaints and toasted them. They were so good!

I also add dried cranberries and keep the blue cheese. I like the slight sweet of the berries to go along with the salty blue cheese and the crunch of the celery. Every time I make some sort of chicken dish, this follows not too long after.

we made this on a night that we made some homemade chicken nuggets for our daughter. so... crispy oven-baked chicken nuggets, pecans, blue cheese, smaller portion of regular mayo, green onions, celery and lemon juice on a thick slices of nine-grain bread with fresh tomatoes and sprouts. delicious!

The lemon juice provides a nice, zesty flavor to this chicken salad! I added cranberries for a little extra flavor. This has become a favorite for sure!

I added dried cranberries to it and served it on croissants sans blue cheese. It was a hit.

My celery was too limp to use so subbed some chopped red pepper. It was a crisp and colorful addition. Think I'd add it to the listed celery next time.

This was quite good, but just not in the category of great.

I'm not crazy about light mayo so I substituted a ratio of 1/3 regular mayo to 2/3 fat free greek yogurt. It made for a nice tangy taste.

Very good!! I may add some cheese next time or even stick this in a pita instead of on the roll for something different.

The blue cheese was the twist that made it tangy and special.I did throw in some more chicken,otherwise the filling would have been skimpy for the rolls. A hit at an outdoor concert.I made the whole picnic menu.

This was such a delicious sandwich and very easy to prepare. I found a wonderful foccacia and added watercress for a little more color. Next time I'll try it on brioche.

Made just a few changes in the recipe. Mixed the blue cheese (1/2 cup) in instead of putting it on the rolls separately. Instead of lemon juice used 2 tsp. Cilantro Dressing (from this site, because I had some in the fridge.) This made a great-tasting, light lunch. I don't know that it would make six sandwiches though, more like four, with the size of Kaiser rolls I used (about 6" wide). It was good as a sandwich filling but it would make a good salad without the bread. The 1/2 cup of blue cheese was just about right, glad I didn't add any more or it would have overwhelmed the chicken.
