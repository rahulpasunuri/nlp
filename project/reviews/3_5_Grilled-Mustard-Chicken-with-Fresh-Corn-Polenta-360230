Made this using boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I marinated the chicken breasts in the dijon/olive oil mixture adding enough olive oil to somewhat thin the dijon. The results were absolutely delicious. Can't wait to serve this at a dinner party.

Excellent! The polenta was really good.

Pretty good! I enjoyed the chicken - but I had added some sage, lemon zest, hot pepper, and chopped red onion and more garlic to the marinade. I also made a sour cream sauce with sour cream, mustard, chicken broth and spice. The polenta was a little bland, even after adding some parmesan. Loved the corn in it, but would probably start with a different base for polenta (e.g., with chicken broth or cream/milk). Overall, very enjoyable base to build on a nice meal.

This recipe was really good and I will be making it again. I added kosher salt to the chicken before putting the mustard mixer on and it favor was delish. Also I couldn't find polenta so I used cornmeal and it came out great. I added 1/2 cup of parm cheese to the polenta and it gave it that missing ingrediant it needed. Hubby loved it and will make it again!

Polenta is so easy to make in a slow cooker. (Just be sure to allow the extra time.) Stir all ingredients (except corn kernels and mascarpone) in a lightly greased slow cooker. Cook on high for 2 hours. Stir and add corn kernels and mascarpone. Cook for about 15 more minutes. I always make my polenta this way and it comes out perfect every time.

I really loved this polenta, which I made with frozen corn. But the chicken thighs were just okay. I'll definitely use the polenta recipe again with other cuts of chicken in different sauces. The whole recipe is quick to put together and easy to make.

Had a good chuckle at the cook fr NYC who rated this recipe without ever making it lol Anyhow... made it tonight and it was great! Had skinless drumettes and no green onions...so minced some shallot. Added a bit of sage to mustard mixture and baked this recipe. So very good! Love the lmon & dijon combo !! I def have bookmarked this recipe for the marinade alone. Nice balance. I tweaked the polenta a wee bit just because of what was available in fridge... carmelized some sweet onion and added baby lima beans with the corn... then finished with low fat cream cheese for the marscapone...a wee bit of fresh parm as well. Very good! I def will make the simple corn version as well..it adds a nice texture and I am sure the leftover polenta will be wonderful grilled. Great comfort food on a frozen night :)

This review is for the polenta only which I served with smoked chicken. I think it makes a great base for any grilled or smoked chicken. It's winter here in Minnesota so I used frozen organic corn and it was just as good.I also like to lightly break up about one third of the corn in a food processor to mix up the texture.

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly! It turned out SOOOOO GOOD! My boyfriend and I were both VERY impressed! The mustard and lemon sauce on/in the chicken was tart enough to go with the slightly bland polenta, which we put Tabasco sauce on for an extra kick! I highly recommend!

I made the polenta as side dish with grilled veal chops - this polenta is really good I love the addition of the mascarpone - I used defrosted frozen corn which was fine and added a bit of grated parmesan. I put leftovers in baking pan and will cut into triangles, drizzle with olive oil, sprinkle with grated parmesan and fresh herbs and roast with cherry tomatoes!

Simple and wonderful! I added additional spice to the polenta: pepper, sage. The base recipe is nice, but spice adding can add a personal touch. You can also use the tubes of preformed polenta: reheat, mash and add some water to get the right consistency (then the fresh corn, sugar, salt and spices) I absolutely LOVED the chicken. Used my stovetop griddle instead of a grill, and would consider roasting it next time as well with a good grill or griddle sear at the end, just to see the results/timing. Guests loved it. More importantly, I loved it. Dark meat is the key, I would not change out and use breasts.

This is by far the best dinner I have made all week. I made a few revisions (I threw capers into the mix, used frozen corn, and extra stone ground mustard). I also used chicken breasts and put them into a oven at 350 then raised it to 400 degrees. It was so good that I can't wait to try it on the grill!

This is a delicious chicken recipe. I removed all skin and used legs, breasts and thighs. I made the night before and the next day BBQ 's the chicken. The polenta was great too.

Loved the Polenta; it is worth 5 stars! Chicken was very good, but felt like a lot of work for the results.

The picture of this recipe looked exactly like something we would like, and it was. The polenta was new to us, having never made it before, and it was very good. Couldn't figure out if the corn should be cooked prior to putting it in the polenta, so we decided to let the polenta cook it, which seemed to work. The mustard on the thighs was not overly intrusive and flavored the meat nicely to my wife's relief. All in all, fun to make, and very good to eat. HSV Cook

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I used chicken leg quarters and cooked it in the oven and it was a HUGE hit at my house. No complaints and clean plates. Can't wait to make it for company!

We only made the polenta, but it was delicious and we will definitely make it again. We loved the creamy, but not overbearing flavor of the marscapone cheese. We even loved the leftovers and think they'll make great corn cake fritters.

This was really good. I used bone in skin on breasts and they were juicy and flavorful. Also used instant polenta and it was just fine. No one had ever had polenta at home before and everyone came back for seconds.( It did need lots of salt and pepper) I grilled the corn to give it more color. Served with the Green Bean/walnut salad from the same issue and dinner was a great success!

Really wonderful. I'm glad I only made half as much polenta for just the two of us...I think we would have finished it. Wow! I made a few adjustments, but nothing really significant: I spun up the marinade in a chop chop to get the scallions really incorporated, baked the chicken at 350 for 20 min so the grilling would go faster, and grilled the corn along with the chicken and then stirred the cut kernels into the polenta during the chicken's last 5 min on the grill. Super yummy.

Yummy. The polenta was easy and delicious. I used both yellow and white corn for visual appeal. I did not skewer the thighs closed and the chicken turned out great on the Big Green Egg. I garnished with a balsalmic reduction and fresh basil. I would make it again in a heart beat!

This was great + easy. I made with boneless skinless chick breasts - fileted thin, marinated an hour, then grilled (15 min?). The polenta was tasty, made as-is. Next time I'd cut down a bit on the mascarpone (quite creamy!). Husband requested we keep this recipe and make again.

I made the chicken and polenta at different times, both were delicious. For the polenta I roasted the corn before adding it at the last minute and topped it with fresh basil.

This turned out to be a hit mid week supper that the kids (ages 6 & 4) loved! Served with fresh tomoatoes and zucchini thinly sliced and drizzled with grapeseed oil. I don't have a BBQ so I just baked it in the oven. Had the August cover recipe for dessert as well. The whole family was duly impressed!

Did not make the polenta, but the chicken was DELICIOUS. My mom said it was some of the best chicken she has ever had. I added a little bit of olive oil to the mustard mixture to make it a little easier to spread. Really, really good and really easy too.

I'll remember this as a great use for leftover corn on the cob, which works just fine with quick-cooking polenta. I omitted the sugar. Also I tied up the thighs rather than investing in turkey lacers, and cooked the polenta while the chicken was on the grill. Too warm around here for the oven, even at night! It was very good, but needed some color - maybe sprinkle with chopped chives before serving? As to the repeated post controversy (if there is one), my posts have duplicated when I use the "preview" button. Never had it happen so many times, but there's definitely a glitch there.

I did not make the chicken but loved the polenta. I had fresh sweet corn and it was so good. I think it's interesting how some people love polenta but hate grits. As I was making the dish, I kept thinking how they tasted the same but with grits you can skiip 20 minutes of stirring.

This is a little deceptive, because I'm really only reviewing the polenta. I served it with 2 other dishes from the same edition of Bon Appetit - steak with a sort of salsa/tapenade, and "Corn with tons of Herbs." The combination was wonderful as well as beautiful. Even non- polenta fans were converted.The crunchiness of the fresh corn combined with the rich, creamy polenta made it memorable. Of course, the success of this dish depends on being able to get really good, fresh corn.

This was delicious! I did use yellow cornmeal as suggested and it turned out perfectly. Make sure you use toothpicks to secure chicken-almost lost the skin on the grill. Will definitely make this dish again!

Boring and flavorless. Needs some serious retooling.

Yum! Yum! Yum! Very easy and perfect for a hot summer day. The chicken came out well, but next time I make it I will start it in the oven and finish off on the grill. While this recipe is time consuming, it is not difficult, it is very flavorful and not expensive.

This was my first recipe from the website and my husband and I were very happy with this. A few recommendations from a decent home cook: follow the prior recommendation on starting the chicken in the oven, I didn't see that until after we made it and was going to recommend that. I have never made polenta before, and finished with a few squeezes of lemon juice, green onion, and lots of salt. It was delicious and we are going to fry the left overs tomorrow in little patties with flank steak. I used more garlic in the chicken's sauce and would have preferred even more, maybe 4 cloves. We cooked thighs and breasts, and made a mess of the grill. Happy cooking!

Absolutely fantastic. I needed to make about 25% more seasoning for the chicken when I ran short for spreading on top. Roasted chicken for 20 min at 425 degrees, then finished them off on the grill on medium/low heat for 15 min. Turned out perfect. The polenta is wonderful just as the recipe is.

Difficult to give this dish a rating. The chicken wsa mediocre, but the polenta was deliciour.,,thereby the three forks.

I only made the polenta, but it was amazing! Instantly a favorite of ours! I made a few modifications to the recipe, which I think really enhanced the recipe. I didn't add any sugar as I wasn't looking to increase the sweetness and I threw in two chopped green onions at the end. The result was superb! I would highly recommend the green onions as it really balanced out the flavors well. Since I still have most of the ingredients I'll probably make this again in the next few days, it was that good!

I used breasts rather than thighs. I thought the green onion Dijon mixture was ok. The reason I gave the recipe the 3 forks is for the polenta. I loved it. I added sliced fresh basil to the polenta for a nice fresh flavor. I've been eating the polenta for breakfast topped with a fried egg. Yum.

The chicken was delicious (I substituted bone-in chicken breasts for the thighs), but the polenta was only so-so. It seemed like a waste of perfect in-season corn. I will definitely make the chicken again though-- I allowed it to marinate in the fridge for 6 hours, and that really allowed the flavor to seep into the breasts. The finished result was exceptionally moist.

Looking for something healthy, so I used skinless breasts.Very yummy. Used regular corn meal & used just 4 Cups of water, it did cook faster, but kept warm on the stove top for the time needed to bar-b-que chicken. Will make again for sure.

Great dish to make for a group. Had lots of polenta left over and re-heats well. Made the chicken dish again last night in the over (baken for about 30 min at 425) and turned out just as well.

i have made both parts of this recipe on its own, and I believe the fresh corn polenta is more special than the chicken. Granted, I did use boneless skinless breasts, so this may account for less flavor punch. The polenta is impressive, fresh, and less heavy seeming than other polenta due to the inclusion of fresh kernels. However, the marscarpone is what makes it special. This makes a great accompaniment for any grilled or roasted meat. We had it with rack of lamb with balsamic syrup.

This was so yummy! We LOVED the mustard marinade/coating. I did add some coarse ground dijon along with the regular. Also, I agree with the other reviewer that the cooking time was not as long as stated, so just watch it carefully. The polenta with fresh corn was delicious!!

I made only the chicken part of this recipe, and it was delicious, even warmed up the next day. I used boneless, skinless breasts and modified the mustard mixture by adding 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 1 teaspoon dried tarragon, more garlic and the juice of half lemon, about 2 tbsp. I marinated the breasts for 4 hours, salt and peppered them, then grilled.

So far I've only made the polenta (and served with bbq's pork tenderloin) but it was amazing. We already love polenta, and this was a delicious summery twist on it. I used goat cheese instead of marscapone and found that there was too much liquid to dry ingredients here-- it cooked down eventually but to make it faster I'd go with 3 cups of water rather than 5. Looking forward to making the polenta again this week, this time with the chicken!

Just made for my picky children. They devoured the chicken and discovered a new love of polenta. The chicken was so delicious and moist, though it didn't take as long to cook on the grill as the directions stated. The polenta was incredible as well. This will definitely be added to my repetoire.
