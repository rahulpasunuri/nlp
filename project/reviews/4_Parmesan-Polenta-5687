Halved recipe for my family but made (initially) as written. Not only was it salty but tasted overwhelmingly of chicken broth. Took readers suggestions and added milk and water to try to cut broth flavor. Also could not taste parmesan at all so I ended up doubling cheese. Ended up good - not great but good. Will try again with less broth/more water at beginning - hopefully that creates a less salty, less "chicken-y" polenta :)

I made this for dinner the other night, and since it was just for myself and my girlfriend, I reduced the recipe to serve two. It's a very quick recipe, and easily prepared for ahead of time while meat etc. is cooking. Quite rich and very delicious. I used full-salt chicken broth, so I declined to add the butter, but it was still rich and creamy, and not at all too salty. Fantastic!

Very good. Rich. You could cut the broth with water if needed. I added a little milk.

I made this recipe with the following changes, and it was delicious. I reconstituted dried porcini mushrooms, saved the liquid, and diced finely the reconstituted mushrooms. I substituted the soaking water from the porcini mushrooms for half of the chicken stock. Be careful to let the grit settle in the soaking liquid, and don't use any of the liquid that has grit in it. I then browned some crimini mushrooms, diced finely, in butter, and added the reconstituted and diced porcini mushrooms. I doubled the cheese, and when the polenta was cooked, added all the mushrooms to it. I turned the whole thing out into a shallow bowl that I'd oiled and sprinkled with thyme leaves. Covered the bowl and let polenta settle for ten minutes. Then I inverted the bowl onto a platter. Gorgeous.

Best polenta recipe I have ever tried. Didn't have parmesan so I used asiago. I will definitely make this again. So delicious and easy!

Very good. I think I'll halve the parmesan next time because I don't want to cover all that yummy polenta flavor.

Delicious! I made this with manchego cheese instead of parmesan and used 2 cups chicken broth with 7.5 cups water instead of all broth and it was still very rich and creamy.

This was absolutely delicious. I made it because I know my dad loves polenta, but when I've had it in the past I haven't liked it. However, using this recipe, we both loved it. I'll definitely make this again. Also, I served this with chicken francaise, to great effect, but would also go well with tomato (or other) sauces.

Delicious and super easy! I added a bit of fresh thyme for some more flavor. Great side dish with portobella mushroom steaks.

First try at polenta went great. Used half veggie broth half fat free half-n-half for liquid, as recommended previously. Cut butter in half. Worked very well, though might increase liquid and parmesan next time. Great side dish to replace mashed potatoes that we'll make again.

This was very delicious especially considering the ease of preparation. I left out the butter and about quartered the recipe (1/4 C cheese, 1/2 C cornmeal, and 2 C low sodium broth). This made about 3 servings. I served it with osso buco.

this is a fabulous recipe, and my gf, who said she hates polenta, even liked it! I subbed half the broth for reduced fat milk and it came out perfectly. I used only half the parmesan, because my broth was quite salty. a warning for polenta newbies (as I was before last night!) - this makes a LOT of polenta! I know the more experienced cooks realized this when they saw 9.5 cups of liquid, but I must have been in denial or something!

This is sooo good. I did alter the recipe by using 1/2 vegetable broth and 1/2 FF half and half for the liquid. Very creamy and flavorful.

Nice and Easy. I added a little cream to make it a little richer,but either was it is a perfect side dish.

This is quite good. The texture was perfect, which isn't always the case with homemade polenta. Try it!

Easy and very tasty!

Very nice dish. I too served it with sauteed spinach but with grilled red pepper. Rather than pork, I prepared a succulent veal chop, french cut...(with the long bone). It was a dish worthy of a fine restaurant, both in taste and appearance.

Absolutely delicious! I served this dish topped with Sauteed Spinach and Red Bell Peppers as pictured in the September 1998 issue of Bon Appetit. The polenta, along with pork chops, made an easy, colorful, and tasty dinner!

Everyone loved this dish... and the ingredients are easy to keep on hand! I had to look up the recipe again so I could make it for dinner tonight!
