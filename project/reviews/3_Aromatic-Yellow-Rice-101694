This smelled terrific. I will say that I have made it with a cinnemon stick and with ground- I prefer ground honestly because it adds more flavor and aroma. Also, for an extra kick, an Iranian friend once served me saffron rice and added dried cranberries on top after serving. I tried this with this recipe and found it was a great finishing touch!

Served this with Chicken legs/achiote garlic sauce because of the similar spices. The combo was a Big hit at our house. I had to substitute a little lime zest for the lime leaves as none could be found in my town!

I am giving this 3 forks instead of 4, but only because there is no 3.5. The aromas were really out of this world. Unfortunately, my husband was not a fan...had he been, I probably would have gone with 4 forks, but he is a Filipino who really likes to stick with plain, white rice. I cut down on the water just a bit because I like my rice a little drier. There wasn't robust flavor-- this is about savoring the complex smells, not about dissecting layers of taste. I served this rice with the herb-marinated Thai chicken...it was smashing.

The dish was good, but not great. It did indeed taste more Indian than Southeast Asian, and as such, I found that the lime seemed a bit out of place.

We really enjoyed this rice. Some reviewers thought the rice tasted more Indian than SE Asian. For a stronger SE Asian flavor, cut the kaffir lime leaves into thin slivers rather than leaving them whole. And don't discard them at the end but feel free to eat them! They lend a distinctive Thai flavor to the rice.

Gorgeous color..easy, but lacking robust flavor. If you want rice a step or two up from plain, this is a good choice. Lime rind worked well as did ground cinnamon for substitutions. (Try "Indian Baked Rice" for more complex flavor...read the reviews first)

I thought this rice dish would be full of flavor, but it wasn't. My family did not like it, so I won't make it again. I think that regular rice pilaf is more flavorful.

This has become a true favourite in our house. I use 2 cups broth and water for the rest. I will try the suggestion of lime rind next time. Kids love this rice.

Nice colour and flavor - good when paired with a spicy Indian curry dish.

I do agree that this recipe is more like a middle-eastern or Indian recipe, although it is supposed to be Indonesian or southeast asian. The authentic Indonesian yellow rice is made using coconut milk, instead of chicken broth, fresh turmeric, fresh lemon grass, and fresh coriander. And of course, the kafir-lime leaves make it more aromatic.

This was so tasty. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and substituted the rind of a lime (in a large peel so it was easy to pull out at the end) instead of the leaves. I topped it with cuban black beans but this could very well stand alone as a delicious side dish.

This is one fabulous dish I find goes well with a chicken dish. Kaffir leaves are available at any specialty food store,thou often need to be special ordered. Ask your produce specialist or email me at store062@bashas.com or call 800-270-6494 David

Excellent dish. It accompanied a curried chicken dish well. I substituted a cup or apple juice for some of the chicken broth. This worked well.

i really liked this rice. the color was amazing, the flavor perfect - even with the full chicken stock. i couldn't find kaffir lime leaves so used lime zest in large strips so i could pull them out easily. it was easy to make and very well received at a potluck! the flavor surprisingly melded well with the other flavors at the potluck - don't be afraid to use this with different dishes than just middle eastern or indian.

This dish was actually quite good. However, it is inappropriately categorized as an asian dish. With the cumin, it tastes far more middle eastern. Also, I used half chicken broth, half water -- otherwise the chicken flavour would've been too intense. Consider trying it w/o cumin. Also, kaffir lime leaves are difficult to find (I couldn't find any) -- suggest another alternative.
