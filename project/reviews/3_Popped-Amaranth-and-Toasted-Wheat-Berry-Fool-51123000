Food texture is paramount. During the recent "Sandy" power outage, I added raw quinoa to a meal of wild salmon, red rice, and black beans. I found the quinoa quickly absorbed some excess moisture from the emergency pantry products meal AND for me, provided a much need "pop" of texture. I will repeat the technique. I look forward to your thoughts and comments. Thank you!

I really like the idea of this recipe, as I am always happy to find new ways to use whole grains, but I can't say I'm thrilled with the nutritional data. So I made it as an inspiration, rather than following it closely. I'm using the amaranth, wheat berries and fruit, but eliminating the heavy cream, replacing the refined sugar with agave syrup and substituting nonfat Greek yogurt for the full fat. My lightened version makes 3 servings at about 200 calories each; the original makes 3 servings at about 525 calories each -- and let's not even mention the difference in fat content! I was delighted with the outcome, made a delicious breakfast. Next time I'm going to try pomegranate seeds instead of berries.
