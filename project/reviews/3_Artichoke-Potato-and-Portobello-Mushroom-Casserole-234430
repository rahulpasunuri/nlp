I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and it was pretty bland :( I wouldn't say it was "dry" but it didnt have the creaminess that I expected from the goat cheese. Preparing the artichokes was fairly labor intensive, so if I were to make this dish again I would use packaged artichokes, perhaps marinated for flavor. Herbed goat cheese would also help, as would lemon juice, tabasco, or chicken broth (good suggestions previous reviewers!) Bechemel would be really good in this, too, if you're up for making it. One last note: CHOP the garlic, don't press it. It will be much easier to sprinkle evenly over the layers :)

I added chopped porcini mushrooms (available dried at most groceries-just throw them in warm water for 20-30 min, squeeze out excess, chop) and they really added some depth to this. I also used packaged, un-marinated artichoke hearts, added thyme and a little rubbed sage. I baked in individual baking dishes-they make for a nicer presentation and you can just eat out of them instead of having the mess of cutting and extra dishes. I also used roasted tomato & basil goat cheese, and half and half gruyere and parmesan. Did a squeeze of lemon juice over each layer and 1/3 cup chicken broth in each dish. This deserves a better name than casserole-it was fantastic!

I followed the recipe as it was, using fresh artichokes and yukon gold potatoes from the farmers' market, as well as fresh garlic. It was out of this world, and I will definitely make it again!

This recipe took a long time to prepare, but it was worth it - delicious! Everyone loved it. I didn't change much, just used frozen artichokes (and sliced them), and used vegetable broth instead of the wine. I was very generous with the olive oil to keep the food moist, and it worked out great.

It was a yummy vegetarian entree. After reading the reviews, I used 8 ounces of garlic & herb goat cheese, 2 pounds of non-marinated jarred artichokes, at least 6 tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, 6 garlic cloves and was free with the extra-virgin olive oil. Tasty! The guests loved it.

This tasted terrible! There is not enough liquid in it - I recommend substituting a cream sauce for the white wine.

I added sliced eggplant to the recipe and it made it really good as the eggplant adds very nice flavor to the dish. The dish turned out very hearty and flavorful.

I just made this dish and it is absolutely delicious! I changed a few things in the recipe that I think worked out for the better. I used artichoke hearts marinated in oil (from the jar), which added some flavor and was also sooo much easier, plus I didn't need extra oil in between the layers. I added two tablespoons of fresh chopped parsley and I used garlic herb goat cheese and double amount of Pecorino cheese instead of Parmesan. I din't have any white wine at home, so I substituted it for vegetable broth (made with Knorr vegetable bouillon). It turned out great; not dry or blend. I will definitely make it again.

i expected so much more out of this considering the ingredients. it was pretty blah. i think it could be improved with a goat cheese bechamel sauce rather than the crumbles. but i'm pretty sure i won't bother.

Guests loved this and took the leftovers. I thought it was dry and bland. Significant changes might help. I would work with potatoes, artichoke and parmesean; but it would be a very different recipe.

I used frozen artichoke hearts, which worked out pretty well. Nice simple flavor.

I made good use of a mandoline for slicing the portabello, potatoes, and artichoke very thin. I added the wine before the final layer of potatoes (or it would have just run off). The dish ended up very artichoky, which I liked, but my husband did not. I served it with a side of asparagus with a light, lime hollandaise for the main course along with a salad and soup as starters for a good, hearty vegetarian meal.

I thought this was too bland, so I made it again, this time using coarsely chopped, thawed frozen artichoke hearts instead of fresh, and a couple of drops of Tabasco. Lemon juice would also work. It was then a four fork dish.
