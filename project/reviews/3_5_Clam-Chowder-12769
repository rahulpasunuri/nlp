I always have the ingredients on hand if I remember to replace the can of clams. It's a quick and satisfying week night meal. I skip the bacon and don't miss it. I usually add more milk than the recipe calls for, and more potatoes, too.

Very good recipe. Even my kids loved it.

Modified a little and was SO good. I used 12 large cherry stone clams and steamed them in the bacon/onion/celery mix. Then removed and chopped and added back in with 1 can of clams, rinsed and drained. Also mashed a potato for thickness. YUM YUM

Made a 5X of this recipe for a Christmas Eve dinner party. Needs about 1 tsp of Old Bay for the listed recipe. I also suggest that you mash some of the potatoes to thicken the chowder.

Just made this tonight. It was really tasty. It was a little thick; I think I used too much potatoe. I just added a little water though, and it was fine.

This was great! I did add bay leaf and dash thyme as recommended.

This is a great recipe, but it needed more flavor in my opinion. I added fresh parsley, a few drops of hot sauce, and old bay spices. I took another reviewers advice and mashed up a few potato pieces to thicken.

A great combination: easy and delicious. I'm adding this to my regular recipes.

Excellent! I substituted half & half for half of the milk. I only had 1% milk and wanted the chowder to be a little more creamy. I also added 1/2 slice bacon the bacon flavor is a key ingredient to this chowder.

I'm very particular about clam chowder, and I loved this recipe. To thicken the soup a bit, take out some of the potatoes after they have been softened and mash, then add back into the soup. I don't use flour, since it is a flavor reducer.

Very tasty. I used fresh clams instead of canned. I also added some herbs such as paparika and thyme (no Old Bay seasoning in Japan). Will definitely make again when craving clam chowder.

I tried this with family and friends last night and now they want me to cook it again, and again, and again. Great recipe.

This was fantastic chowder. I added about 2 teaspoons of thyme as well and the salt and pepper, plus I used cream instead of milk to give it a little creamier consistency. My husband and I both loved it!

GREAT basic recipe, and easy. I used 3 slices bacon, added flour to the sauteed vegetables and used half & half. I let it simmer 20-25 minutes which really thickened it and let the flavor permeate the potatoes (Yukons). If anything, I would increase the liquid (maybe chicken stock or vegetable broth??) Some nice fresh herbs wouldn't hurt either. My family are clam chowder snobs and were skeptical but they LOVED it! My son gives it 6 forks!

Used half & half rather than milk. Really an excellent chowder and very easy to make.

I made this tonight and it really hit the spot. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! The only change I might make is to use Half & Half. This is especially good ,if you want a small amt. of chowder

This recipe is great - and so easy! I didn't have any bacon, but it still turned out very flavorful. I will definately make this again!

Clam chowder can't get much easier to prepare than this! Very good and tastes like you spent much more time in the kitchen than you did - makes a great weekday meal with salad.

This soup needs real clams instead of canned. Quahogs are inexpensive and add real clam flavor. If they're oo tough for you after they're cooked, run them through a food processor or meat grinder. It's not that much extra work and the flavor is unmatched. Try using fat free half and half instead of the milk.

This was delicious. I took some of the advice and added a bay leaf, pinch of thyme, Old Bay and a splash of Crytal's hot sauce. Also used half & half with skim milk. This is definitely a keeper.

Okay. Here's a switch. I'm reviewing some of the suggestions by other people. I added a tad of thyme, bay leaf & regular sherry. NEVER use the cooking versions of wine. Yuck! Anyway--it was okay. Not great. Not good. Okay. I did add flour & butter mixture to thicken. Glad I did that. Next time I will try the recipe as written. Because of it's ease, it gets one more shot.

So easy and so good! I would definitely make this again, but altered the recipe this time and would alter it slightly more next time. The Old Bay was a great idea, but I would add a little flour to the onion/bacon/celery mixture before i added the milk to thicken the soup.

I was looking for a quick and easy clam chowder so I tried this. The only modifications I made were using mostly 1/2 & 1/2 instead of milk and adding just a touch of thyme. It was wonderful. My whole family loved it. Our only complaint was that we should have made more. Being from the Pacific Northwest, I'm no stranger to great clam chowder (anyone had Ivar's?), but this stood up well. I will definitely make this again and soon!

I made this for the first time tonight and did make some changes to the recipe: 1) nuked (instead of frying) 3 slices of Louis Rich 65% less fat turkey bacon; 2) slightly increased the celery; 3)added about 1/4 of a medium red bell pepper, chopped, to the celery/onion mixture; 4)used 1 cup of half & half and 1/2 cup of 2% milk (instead of all milk). After adding the clams, potatoes, and milk, I used some reviewers' suggestions and added 1/4 tsp. dried crushed thyme, 1 large bay leaf, a generous sprinkle of Old Bay, and 1 Tbs. cooking sherry. It was very bland after simmering it a bit. Then I added a very generous sprinkle of black pepper, several drops of bottled Maggie Hot Chili Sauce, and 1/2 tsp. Wyler's Instant Bouillon Fish Flavoring. The thing that really made it taste like something was the fish flavoring. My husband says it was the very best clam chowder that he has ever had. I would give what I made 5 forks, but cannot be that generous with this recipe as it is written, since it needed all kinds of extra additions to make it taste like something.

Wonderful soup and very easy to make. I added 2 T sherry, thyme and a bay leaf. It was the best clam chowder I've ever had. Can hardly believe some of those so-so reviews.

This is a great recipe! Totally eliminates the need for canned clam chowder. I will be keeping clams in my pantry just for this recipe!

Was in a pinch for a quick clam chowder (was out of regular commercial stock from restaurant supply depot- I have a deli and it was "clam chowder day"). Multiplied ingredients for quantities needed and was a great success. Patrons raved and asked for this recipe again "not the other", I did use some favorite herbs not mentioned in recipe, however have no doubt that we would have been a success without them. Will definitely serve again so easy to make.

This was a fantastic clam chowder that rivals what one can find in any restaurant. We will most likely make this many times over the long winter since it is so easy to make.

This is a very tasty, quick soup. I omitted the minced clams called for, without the least detriment to the taste. I also added enough flour to the butter and onion to create a roux, so as to thicken it a bit. I also added a little left over cream to thicken it as well. It turned out great.

I substituted the milk with half and half and added 1 1/2 Tbls. corn starch. This thickened it up nicely! It was very flavorful and so easy to make. I might try it with 1/2 tsp. cream of tartar instead of the corn starch for thickness next time.

The ingredients are simple and the recipe is easy. I was able to throw them together and have a tasty soup with a minimal amount of fuss. I enjoyed the consistency, but my husband would have liked the soup somewhat thicker. This is something that can easily be changed. Overall, a good recipe that I will fix again.
