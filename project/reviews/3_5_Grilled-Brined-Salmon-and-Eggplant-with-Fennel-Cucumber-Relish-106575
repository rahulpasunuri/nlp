The salmon was excellent. The eggplant, on the other hand, was so salty that it was on the verge of being inedible. It seemed to soak up waaaay too much of the brine during the 30 minutes that it marinated. (And, yes, I did use kosher salt-- not table salt.) I would definitely use this brine for salmon again, but I'll skip the eggplant brining next time, or I'll at least try brining it for a shorter period of time.

I did not care for this at all. I'll admit that the brine did make the salmon very moist. However, the taste was very disagreeable. The brine did not provide any actual "flavor" to the salmon. I couldn't detect the brown sugar or the dill. It did provide an abundance of salt though. I am actually a salt lover, and this was WAY too salty for me to enjoy. It may be the worst salmon recipe I've ever tried. Sorry!

Way too salty! Made it with wild King salmon and no eggplant. Brined for 50 minutes in refrigerator starting with brine at 65 degrees. Maybe rinsing the filets before drying and cooking would help. I am surprised so few others had this problem.

The salmon is really complimented with this brine. I've made it several times and had friends who don't like the texture of salmon most of the time request this dish after trying it. The fish firms up a bit...The eggplant, well , I liked the recipe a reader sent in to the magazine for marinated eggplant around the same time this was on the stands...Please find that recipe and put on the website...

This is my absolute favorite way to make salmon. The colour, texture, and flavour are great. I've been making this for years and will continue to make it for years to come. I only made the eggplant one time and It wasn't good...don't waste your time with that part of the meal.

The salmon was divine - tender, moist, the relish is the perfect complement. The eggplant was still bland and was not popular with my guests.

I made this recipe to use up our kosher salt before we moved and we were pleasantly surprised. It is now one of our top salmon recipes.

My husband loved it and I didn't, thus the 2 forks. I simply couldn't taste the salmon.

I made this dish for a dinner party. Loved the way the salmon and the relish turned out. Wasn't terribly impressed with the eggplant. To me, it didn't really add much to the dish. To the reviewer who thought the dish was too salty, maybe you used regular table salt vs. kosher? I could see that contributing to it being too salty. Ours turned out perfectly, though I think I would have been in trouble leaving it in any longer than the recommended time.

Quite yummy and leftovers are great in a salad the next day.

this was a big hit and easy to do. i did not make the eggplant but made gilled peaches instead with a molasses and balsamic vinger glaze. this is perfect for a hot summer's evening dinner as well as delicious.

This is an "alright" recipe, but we like the standard lemon juice-butter-minced garlic covered barbequed fillets better.

We collected salmon recipes with a passion is Seattle, and this is one of the best I have tried. The brining plumps the salmon, it grills with a "crusty" outside and tender, delicious interior.

What a terrific dish! I've made this twice already first for the family then for guests, It was a big hit both times.

DEE-LISH! Added fresh corn to the relish for an extra-summery touch. BTW, first time I made w/o relish -- second time with. Would HIGHLY recommend that you make this dish WITH the relish, both for the sake of flavor AND presentation (definitely restaurant quality!)

I have made this twice, with equal rave reviews from the guests. I have read that someone felt that a great salmon filet was wasted and I guess that what makes the world go around. Nine of us thought this was a great way to prepare salmon.

The salmon was excellent (Coho), but would marinate the veggies in the brine for something less than the 30mins the recipe suggests.

We followed the recipe exactly, marinating both fish and eggplant the recommended time. However, it was salty, salty, salty. We were disappointed. What a waste of a lovely salmon fillet.
