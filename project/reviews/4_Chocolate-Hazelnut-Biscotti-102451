Wonderful recipe and will make again although it's not the easiest dough to work with. The dough is quite sticky and hard to work with. I found that if you refrigerate it for about 15 minutes, it's easier to work with. But it is definitely delicious. I also coated one side with melted chocolate.

pretty delicious. I ground up the hazelnuts almost all the way, and didn't bake the biscotti for the full amount of time. they were crumbly and hard to cut, but I wet the serrated knife before cutting, which seemed to help. They are probably the most delicious biscotti I have had.

This was more chewy like brownies rather than crispy biscotti.

This might be my new favorite biscotti recipe. A few changes I made that still resulted in delicious biscotti: Though I love hazelnuts, I hate husking them, so I used some raw almonds, all of which I pulsed in the food processor. (Toasting them would probably be even better.) I didn't have almond extract, so I just increased the vanilla extract. Also, I subbed wheat flour for half of the all-purpose flour. I found reviewers' comments about both the crumbliness of the biscotti and the spreading of the logs to be true, though I could still fit two logs onto one baking sheet. A bonus to these biscotti: They freeze really well.

Although not a traditional Italian biscotti, these are excellent *and* easy to make. In my oven, I needed about 10 extra minutes for the first baking and about five extra minutes for the second. These have been a huge hit.

I've made these many times...my husband LOVES them - SO good to dip in coffee on a cold day. I grind all of the nuts into fairly small pieces because the whole nuts tend to add a weak spot on the finished cookie and they fall apart. The do spread a great deal, but I still bake them as two logs on large rimmed sheet. Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! The only things I did differently was to chop the nuts slightly and also let them cool longer than 15 minutes before I sliced them. They slice better that way. Getting ready to make them again today.

While these had a wonderful flavor, I had to make adjustments in the directions for baking. They really do spread, making for a long thin biscotti. So I put them in the refrigerator for a couple hours before baking, and would recommend, as have others, of dividing the dough into 3 or 4 logs. I also had trouble with them wanting to burn on the second baking, so I have backed off the temperature to 325. I will make these again as the flavor is very good and everyone really likes them.

Followed the recipe exactly except I substituted slivered almonds for hazelnuts. Tasted good but the crumbled all over. Unusable for my cookie exchange, which is what I was hoping to use them for. Would not make these again simply because of the crumble factor.

Spectacular Biscotti, especially if you undercook it for about 5-7 minutes. Gives a slightly less dry/brittle outcome, allowing flavor to be more intense.

If you cut the logs when they are still warm, they don't crumble.

OH MY GOSH. If you love chocolate, these are fabulous! The butter makes them richer than most biscotti. I used pistachios instead of hazelnuts, and added extra choc chips.

These biscotti are fabulous! They are perfect for the chocoholic. I have made this recipe for several years and they are often requested by friends.

These are great!! I followed another suggestion to use half wheat and half white flour (I do this in most of my baking). I followed the recipe exactly and had excellent results, minimal crumbling. A great new experience in baking!

The biscottis came out spectacular. This is my first attempt at making biscotti and I used the suggestions from other cooks. I halved the recipe (used 2 egg and came out with 33 biscottis!!), used half all-purpose/ half whole wheat flour, coarsely chopped ALL the hazelnuts, made smaller logs and cooked it a bit longer. It came out tasting great and it was really easy, though it still crumbled. Using a serrated knife helped and I noticed that the ends which were more firm than the middle logs did not crumble. Maybe I'll try to them make more of a uniform shape next time. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I was very sad to find that most of my biscotti crumbled to pieces when I made this recipe. I think the crumbling is due to the amount of butter. I made the logs in the second batch much smaller, which seemed to help the crumbling issue a lot, but next time I will cut the butter by 1/4 or 1/2.

I was very sad to find that most of my biscotti crumbled to pieces when I made this recipe. I think the crumbling is due to way too much butter. I made the logs in the second batch much smaller, which seemed to help the crumbling issue a lot, but next time I will limit the butter to about 1 stick.

Here are some tips-instead of 2 logs, make 5 smaller ones about 2 inches by 6 long. They are easier to handle, transfer and cut for the second baking. Also-you can replace the hazlenuts for ground and sliced almonds-they are pretty and taste wonderful with out all the hassle associated with the hazelnuts. The sliced almonds make the cutting easier. You may loose a few to crumbling, but they are excellent over ice cream.

This recipe is pretty good, I used pisachios instead of hazelnuts and they turned out great. As far as the spreading problem that everyone else had, I think it's because there isnt enough protein in the flour, so not enough gluten is formed to hold it together. Don't quote me on this, but next time I might try substituting 1/2 the AP flour for bread flour or whole wheat flour to up the protein content. I only made half a recipe and one log, cut it in half length wise and then into strips and had lots of biscottis! I couldn't imagine how many I would have had if I made a full batch!

Wonderful with coffee or tea for dipping. Great, too, with vanilla ice cream. Freeze well.

Very delicious! If you're freezing them, you can eat them right out of the freezer. I also chopped up the nuts which worked great. Husking the nuts took a while, but was worth if for the flavor.

Have made these for years. They are excellent but do flatten a bit. That hasn't been a problem however. I cut them while still slightly warm and that seems to make them less crumbly.

I have been making these biscotti for years and they are so delicious. Every time I make them, someone asks for the recipe. I have a problem though and wonder if anyone else has encountered the same. I find it does not rise much and spreads so much, that I have to make 4 logs, not two. Even with 4 logs, and chilling the dough for hours, they come out to be very long and flat biscotti. I've made lots of biscotti and this is the only recipe I have this problem with. Can someone help?

V. excited about this recipe because of the great reviews, but was so disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly and while they tasted fine, they turned out so crumbly I could barely pick them up without them falling to pieces. No dunking going on here. :(

I made these for my daughters baby shower first time I ever made biscotti. I found them to be rich and delicious. I found that cuttting them was a bit chorefull so I thought about useing my electric knife you know the one that you carve a turkey with and it worked perfectly, and quickly.can't wait to try more recipes for biscotti.

Great biscotti - dry and crisp, exactly the way I like it. I don't bother putting in the 1/2 cup of ground hazlenuts - this might take care of the crumbly issue some folks had, and leaves more whole nuts for the biscotti, which I prefer. I also split the batter in half and make one log with toasted almonds (3/4 cup) and one log with hazlenuts (3/4 cup). And, generally use chunks of bittersweet or dark chocolate instead of chips...

Rating: 4
Wow, this is the best biscotti recipe I have made thus far. The flavour is just dreamy and the texture is perfect - crisp, crunchy, dry. I followed other reveiwers and chopped the remaining hazelnuts,. I also chilled the dough for 30 minutes before shaping it. Keeping your hands moist whilst shaping the dough is also key. For the final baking, I lowered the oven temp to 250F and left it on for an hour, then turned off the oven and left the biscotti in there over night. Perfection!

I liked this recipe, I cut it in half so I wouldn't have so many left over. I brought some into work and people seemed to like them. I would probably make them again, but I would rather try a different flavor.

Pretty good but a little too crumbly. I forgot to add the chocolate chips to the batter so i put them over the top as the biscotti was baking...it was kind of messy that way, but I think if i'd done it right, it would've been better.

I used 1 1/3 cup Ghirardelli Sweet Ground Chocolate and Cocoa and reduced the sugar to 1 cup. I also used chocolate chunks instead of chips. I am not a chocoholic, but could easily become one because of this recipe. OUTSTANDING! I would make three loaves next time as the loaves are very big.

My guests loved these and begged to take some home....the problem was the biscottis were ALL GONE! Definitely a keeper!

These cookies were delicious; they're wonderful dunked in coffee. I didn't have enough hazelnuts on hand so I used half almonds. I only managed to get about 36 cookies rather then 48. I think I made the raw logs a little too fat. Thinner would have been easier to slice.

Rating: 4
Excellent!! I made the recipe as is and served it with Cappuccino Creams (Bon Appetit 10/95). If you have trouble husking the hazelnuts, you can buy them already chopped.

Rating: 4
I haven't made the recipe yet, but have a question regarding the hazelnuts. What does "husked" mean - shelled? So does that mean the recipe calls for 1.5 cups of unshelled hazelnuts which you then toast (at what temp and for how long?) and then shell?

Rating: 4
This recipe is great and pretty easy. I give them as gifts and people always ask for more. Regarding the hazelnut question- I've found I have to buy about a 1/4 more than the recipe calls for because I have a hard time removing the husks. According to Epricurious- bake at 350 for 10-15 minutes and then rub the flaky husks off with your fingers or a dishtowel. Still- I lose about 1/4 of the nuts because the husk doesn't come off (it's bitter so too much can affect the flavor of the cookie.)HTH

Definitely a keeper! Chop the nuts before adding to batter, broke when I left whole. Also wet hands to shape the logs, not in orginal directions.

Fantastic! My family polished the batch off very quickly. I had to bake the logs a bit longer than suggested, but otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. The hazelnuts give the biscotti a wonderful flavour. Try using Ghirardelli unsweetened cocoa.

I have made this recipe three times. My husband LOVES them. I have had a few problems with the recipe. The logs crumble when they are sliced after baking and cooling. It seems to me that the whole hazelnuts are too smooth and that's where the slices tend to break before the second bake. Next time, I will try chopping up the whole hazelnuts into chunks before adding to the batter. The other problem I have had is that the slices tend to burn during the second bake. I recommend an air-bake sheet or lowering the temp. of the oven. Otherwise, a good combination of flavors and pure heaven when dipped in a good cup o' Joe.

This was a big hit in my family. I changed the recipe slightly by substituting peppermint extract in place of almond extract. Very good.

I'm sorry to say my guests and I didn't really love this recipe. I thought that the hazelnuts had a bitter aftertaste even after I toasted them before I put them in the cookies. Maybe using another kind of nut I would have liked these better. There is another recipe for chocolate walnut biscotti that I think is much better and is a little sweeter.

I love this biscotti recipe. Use to have it years ago and lost it. YEA IT IS BACK IN MY FILE:)I use pecans rather then hazelnuts. The logs really do spread out, and yea it does crumble abit. I hang onto the sides gently while cutting. I tend to bake it a bit longer both times. Just dipped in my latte......HEAVEN............

I made a couple of errors in baking these and they still turned out delicious. I overturned my bottle of almond extract and only had a few drops left so I used them with a couple of drops of anise extract and a couple drops of orange extract as a substitute. Then I discovered that I bought white chocolate chips so I dipped the cookies in them (Melted with a little oil.) instead of adding them to the batter. I also choped the cup of nuts instead of using them whole and still the cookies had a tendency to break. But rest assured, no broken pieces got thrown away. The reciped was requested by a number of persons at the party I took them to, so even with foul ups the recipe is great. The Hazelnuts are a perfect ingredient for this cookie.

Absolutely scrumptious. I couldn't stop eating them!! I found that the biscotti logs were still soft after the prescribed 35 minutes, so I put them back in the oven for an additional 10 minutes and they firmed up just fine. Also, I suggest you pay heed to the advice and make your logs 2.5" wide. I didn't, which is probably why I had difficulty cutting the logs into slices. The slices kept breaking into pieces. I'll definitely make this recipe again. Next time, thinner logs!

Rating: 2
This didn't work too well for me. I am new to baking so I'm not sure what I might have done wrong. The loaves cracked and made it difficult to slice the biscotti - and certainly was not able to slice 1/2 inch thick. I ended up with dry "brownie sticks." They did taste quite yummy - the almond extract and the hazelnuts made for a yummy flavor. The dough was drier and less dense than I expected; it almost seemed like it could use another egg. Is there supposed to be an egg wash? The other biscotti I've made have all called for an egg wash. I'm not sure if I'll give it another try.

This is an awesome recipe, and easy. I substituted macadamia nuts for the hazelnuts and they were a big hit. Hint: If the dough is too sticky, refrigerate for an hour to make it easier to handle. Question: Does anyone know how to prevent the top of th loaf from cracking while baking?

I made this recipe last week based on the reviews. I thought they were delicious and so did everyone who tried them. I did substitute toasted blanched almonds for the hazlenuts. I found the cookies crumbled too easily when I tried to slice them 1/2 inch, so I sliced them a little thicker. I would definitely make them again.

Thie recipe is a hit every time! It is easy to make and never fails. A few cooking suggestions: don't work too hard to remove the husks; having a little left won't negatively impact the flavor--the logs will be much wider than 1/2"; don't be alarmed if they join together during baking, they will come apart easily--my baking time was longer during both steps, just keep an eye. ENJOY!

This is a fabulous recipe for biscotti. I like to melt white chocolate and drizzle it all over the biscotti. It gives it a special touch!

These were a huge hit. I took most of them to work and the folks loved them. Pretty simple to make, too. I thought the dough was kind of sticky, so I chilled it briefly before I shaped the loaves. I very coarsely chopped the 1 cup of hazelnuts, rather than add them all whole. It made the biscotti easier to slice. As a matter of fact, several of the nuts left whole fell out when I sliced them. They did not really stay in when I tried to put them back. Also, I toasted each side 7 minutes - really helps to crisp these up. I make biscotti often and I have always toasted on both sides.

Out of this world. I love biscotti, but hated to pay $1.50 slice for it, so was happy beyond compare to find this recipe.I tripled the recipe and that was my gift to my best friends at christmas. Most know what a tin of biscotti cost, so they thought I had spent a lot of money on them. I just smiled, accepted their thanks, and kept quiet.Truly a gourmet's treat. Thank you so very much. I just discovered this site, am I ever delighted with it.

What a fun cookie to make! I've never made biscotti before and I had no problem at all getting the job done. I did substitute the hazelnuts for pecans and it still tasted wonderful. I was stumped, though... there's no way my batch of dough would make two 14 by 1/2 inch logs... two 14 by 3 inch logs is more like it. Great cookie anyhow!
