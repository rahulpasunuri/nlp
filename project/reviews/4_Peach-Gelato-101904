I make this every summer with fresh apricots from Wickham's farmstand on Long Island. It is absolutely sensational. I love eating it with a little heavy cream poured over the top. Heaven!

Why is this called "gelato" when it contains no dairy?

Wonderfully light taste. Perfect summer dessert. I was quite surprised at how good this was. I blended everything in the food processor before dumping into ice cream maker and it turned out perfect. I did not chill before using the ice cream maker - not sure what this adds.

Great stuff. I used 1/2 white peaches and 1/2 yellow peaches and everyone loved it. I rolled scoops of it in gingersnap crumbs and everyone was wowed.

Excellent! I thought it tasted just like sherbet. A lot different than I expected but would absolutely make it again!

This is not a gelato, but it is really really good. Use only deliciously ripe fruit

This recipe was the perfect solution to my conundrum--having a peck of perfectly ripe South Carolina peaches and a kitchen that is too hot for baking. I'm only giving it three stars, though, because I think the title is a misleading. This is really more of a sorbet than a gelato (unless I just haven't been tried enough fruit-based gelatos? I usually go for the nutty flavors and they're richer and creamier than this recipe).

Fantastic with local peaches a bit past their prime. Used slightly less of the sugar syrup; it seemed overly sweet and lemony in puree form but perfect after freezing. Completely forgot the egg white and it was still creamy, at least right out of the machine.

The flavor was good but I found it too sweet! Maybe next time I will reduce the sugar and it will be perfect.

Use really ripe, fragrant peaches -- white or yellow -- and this is simply amazing. Tastes as if it had eggs and cream, and it doesn't. Maybe add a dash of salt and a drop of almond extract.

This recipe was FANTASTIC!! All my friends loved it and ate it all up in a matter of minutes. Without milk or anything, the gelato was surprisingly creamy and all around delish. I must make this again!

Yummy. Easy. Ice cream maker or not, works both ways. Needs nothing extra but a sprig of mint.

This recipe is FABULOUS. I used white peaches, an ice cream maker, and powdered egg whites. Heaven!!

I thought this was good, but that the cantaloupe and strawberry gelato recipes in this article were much better. This recipe yields a creamier texture than I would like.

WOW! This is fantastic! It tastes just like the gelato I have had in Italy... very creamy. I used white peaches (had them on hand), it makes a very pretty gelato. The recipe doesn't tell you to push it through a sieve, but I did and it made for a very creamy concoction. Highly recommend this!!

I fell in love with Gelato at Vivoli in Florence and this is a very authentic version of the ices available in the best of all gelaterias. I did add an extra half tablespoon of lemon juice and used apricots picked right off the tree. By halving the lemon, Mango is an excellent substitute fruit.

This was so good and nice and light and I am not one to buy light ice cream ever. We have a wonderful peach tree and used the fruit from it and it was sweet and yummy. I served it with whipping cream but I thought the cream got in the way of my yummy peach ice cream, so next time I make it, I will serve it alone, because it was perfect.

YOu can make any ice cream and gelato recipe without an ice-cream maker--here's how. Instead of pouring the finished mix into an ice-cream maker, pour it into a large bowl and put this in the freezer. Stir the mix about every 30 minutes, and more often as it starts to freeze, until it's frozen. The ice-cream won't be quite as smooth as smooth, but it'll taste just as good.

I cannot wait to make this with my son, however I would like to know if there is a way to make this without an ice cream maker, please email me. Thanks

Will make it tomorrow. However I was epecting it to be more like the Gelato on your show ( made with milk)

Just wondering if there's another way to make this if you don't have an ice cream maker? Sounds delicious. Please e-mail response to LeDijon@aol.com.

Watching the program on "TV", I was impressed and will try the ice cream later on.
