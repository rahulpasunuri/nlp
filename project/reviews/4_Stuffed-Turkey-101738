I just had to come back to tell you that this recipe was not only easy but incredibly delicious! I only added raisins to the stuffing and it was great. Thank you so much.

A great one from a great American cook. Works perfectly well roasted in a pan as well, of course. Anybody else who was around and cooking (or eating) in the fifties will know how especially astonishing this recipe is given when Beard put it together.

I made the stuffing in a separate caserole. It was easy and delicious. My kids are 4 and 7 and they loved it. I made it ahead and reheated in the oven. Very yummy!
