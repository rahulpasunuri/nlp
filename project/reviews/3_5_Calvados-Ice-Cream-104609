This is a good recipe, though watch out - the Calvados flavor "builds" in the freezer. We made this for our French-themed Christmas Eve dinner. It had a mild sense of Calvados (after ~36 hours in the freezer). By the next day, the flavor of the Calvados was much stronger (still not overwhelming, but more prominent).

To answer the prior cook's question: "half and half" refers to a mixture of one-half milk and one-half cream.
