Sooo Yum, but am I the only one who needed to add salt? I was trying to mimic WholeFoods Kale and Cannellini soup for my (a new mom) niece. So I omitted the diced tomatoes, used more vegetable broth to compensate, add'l cup of beans, added a pinch or two of red pepper flakes to the onion/garlic and a dash of red wine vinegar at the end (per other reviewers suggestions- thanks!) You don't want to skip the manchego cheese. How can something so healthy be so addictive?!

Used 1 and 1/2 slices bacon for the fat (and smoky flavor) and fire roasted canned diced tomatoes. Also added Parmiggiano rinds to the mixture as it cooked and took them out at the end.Pureed a cup of the mixture and added back to the pot to thicken the broth. Before serving, topped w a little lemon zest and s squeeze of lemon juice. Served w bread. Absolutely delicious. Will probably make weekly throughout the winter months.

Did a combination of this recipe and Sauteed Greens with Cannellini Beans and Garlic. Added smoked paprika to sautéed onions and garlic, did not add tomatoes. Add 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper. Only needed 1 cup broth. Shaved parmesan into finished mixture. Sprinkled with sherry vinegar. (Used sliced homegrown young collards and mustard greens).

This is a stand-by recipe in our household. We usually use bacon fat or lard for the frying & chicken stock rather than vegi stock. I we always use the beans which we often freeze from the recipe Cannellini Beans w/ Garlic & Sage which adds incredible flavor. We've served this for big breakfasts topped with two over easy eggs in each bowl along with locally sourced bacon. We've also served this as the side dish with a steak rather than a carb intensive spaghetti.

Making this for the second time in a week. A forgiving recipe...adding red pepper flakes along with the garlic and using chickpeas instead of cannellini beans. The Manchego is a very nice addition. The dish overall is rich, but not heavy.

Loved this dish--so fast, simple, healthy and tasty! My 10 year old picky eater liked it, and it satisfied both my vegetarian teenager and my meat- eater husband. Will definitely put this in heavy rotation for weeknight suppers.

This is a good base recipe, but I felt it was a bit bland on its own. I added fresh lemon juice, sherry vinegar and liquid smoke to punch it up a bit. We had a vegetarian in our dinner group, but if I wasn't serving this to vegetarians, I would definitely add some anchovies and possibly some dry vermouth at the onion-sauteeing stage for depth of flavor.

This was hearty and delicious. I added ham and cayenne and reduced the liquid to make it a thick stew. The Manchego was key.

Delicious! I made this recipe to the letter, except instead of beans I served the kale-onion-tomato mixture over top a small portion of homemade mashed potatoes. (I absolutely love the way the broth & tomato mix with the potatoes.) The smoked paprika really brings everything together and makes this a hearty dish without overwhelming the other flavors. I did put a bit of Parmesan on top, which worked well. Fantastic with a robust Chardonnay.

By necessity, I made this southwesterny. No cannelini beans, so I used kidney. Regular paprika only, so I also added "smokey chipotle" tabasco. At which point obviously it was cheddar (or jack, if I'd had it) that needed to be grated on top. Tasty! I liked the heat.

i never made greens before trying this recipe. i LOVE it. i made no changes from the original recipe, though i may add quinoa next time. i've now made it with kale and red chard. this is a keeper.

Oh yeah, This was super good. I couldn't resist adding cubed Christmas ham to the onions and home made garlic croutons over the top along with pasta. I used kidney beans because I had it.

Delicious, but I cheated on the meatless thing and added sliced kielbasa. My husband (who can't stand greens) and my 3 yr old ate it up.

I used collard greens and it was a very satisfying weekday meal. Adding the cannellini and good amount of diced tomatoes transforms the greens from a side dish into a tasty stew. (Note that collard greens need a lot longer than 15 minutes to cook - I cook them about 50 minutes.) I doubled the garlic and added a splash of red wine (although I'd probably use a splash of balsamic next time). And don't skip the grated parm. Per another reviewer's suggestion, I also served corn bread which was a great accompaniment.

Not memorable, fairly flavorless. Needs more smoked paprik. Did not like it the southern greens mix from Trader's Joes. This recipe some additional fa

Obsessed, indeed. Made a directed this was quick, easy, warm, hearty and delicious with a batch of cornbread.

I am obsessed with this. So easy and nourishing and just right for a cold autumn weeknight meal. I also add a dash of smoked chili flakes. It works well with white cheddar cheese, or with no cheese at all.

Yum. We're trying to reduce the amount of meat in our diets and this was perfect. I added a couple slices of crispy prociutto and about a cup of quinoa. Fast and very satisfying

This is absolutely delicious. I'm giving it 3 instead of 4 stars only because I'm not sure it would be quite as delicious without the adjustments I made. I used Swiss chard instead of kale (because I prefer the texture and taste -- but will try a combination of both when kale comes back into season in the garden). And I agree with the previous reviewer that you can at least double the amount of greens this recipe calls for. We also didn't have smoked paprika, and decided at the last minute to throw in some diced ham -- yum! I'll try it without the ham once I get my hands on some smoked paprika. In any case, this has become part of our regular dinner rotation.

8 ounces of kale is next to nothing. Double the amount. Hold off on adding all the vegetable broth until you know how soupy you want it. (Good) regular paprika is fine, although not smoky of course. Would be great with cooked kielbasa or Potuguese sausage added to make a meal.
