I would agree with one reviewer who suggested soaking the potatoes (and drying thoroughly) before frying. In fact, I soak them several times briefly until the water is clear. They are delightfully crunchy every time.

I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. A few of my fries came out crispy, but most were only crispy in places. I had actually vowed never to try make my own fries again because they're always lousy and mush. But, I decided to try one more time. I found the recipe below which instructs you to put the fries in an ice bath, then rinse before drying. Additionally, it also instructs lower temperature for the first batch and higher for the second. It also gave a cooling time of about 30 minutes. I had not waited that long on my first attempt. I'll definitely be making them in the future!! http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/foo d/views/Belgian-Fries-with-Sauce- Andalouse-232003

According to the ( The One and Only Belgian Fries website ) Actually the first batch should be 320 degrees and the second 375 degrees... Quote : high time time for a (simple) definition of what makes fries Belgian Fries ( Frites ) : freshly cut, irregularly shaped cooked (fried) twice fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside a distinct potato taste at least 10 mm thick preferably served in a paper cone If 1 of these characteristics is absent, please do not use the term Belgian Fries, just call them fries (or French fries if you prefer).

Frites with a good steak and a cold Belgian beer! What could be better? Don't forget the salt immediately after the second frying and serve with mayo on the side if you must.

I don't know why the reviews digressed into ridiculousness for a while, but let's get back to business! The double cooking is so classic and so good! Do use a starchy potato (a Russet) and season immediately after second frying. I made a simple garlic aioli (commercial mayonnaise and roasted garlic) to go with them and it was yummy!

It was good overall. I did not have a fryer so I used a pot and candy thermometer. I don't know what I did wrong but the frites were a much darker brown than they are when you get them at a restaurant (but they tasted fine). Anyway the recipe didn't say this but I figured out that the temperature actually drops almost 100 degrees (from 325 down to about 225) while you are cooking the fries. At first I thought I had to try to keep the temp at 325 the whole time the frites were cooking but I don't think that's even possible. I guess that's why it says to bring the temperature back up to 325 in between batches. I used russets and safflower oil, and it's a good thing I used a heat-tolerant oil too because when I put the first batch in the pot bubbled over. Don't be cavalier and ignore the advice in the recipe: have a lid ready!

I dropped the foie gras in the deep fryer for twelve seconds and it vanished. So I took a piece of good hearty artisan bread and dunked it in the grease. Can't wait to serve it at my next dinner party. Cheers

I received a 100# bag of persimmons as a holiday gift and decided to try the belgian fry recipe. I quartered each from stem to navel. After several tries, I determined the first cooking should be at 375 degrees for 12 seconds. The second fry worked best at 400 degrees for 4 seconds. Sprinkle with bakers sugar immediately because they are really sour. The seeds remained nice and chewy.

I really didn't even expect the fries to be this good. For me the second frying took a couple of minutes longer than the recipe suggested. I also made sauce andolaise and they were wonderful together.

I made these last night for a great Valentine's day dinner - superb! My only suggestion (and this is also done by my Belgian friends) soak the cut potatos overnight in cold water. This does not discolour the fries but, takes out the excess starch which makes for super crispy fries that are golden on the inside.

These really are good. Had them with a filet mignon with blue cheese butter and Brussels sprouts. The timing is a bit tricky but kept them warm after re-fryng each batch by popping them on a cookie sheet lined with paper bags in a low oven.

This is so great and so easy. Cut the fries on the small size to be sure they get crispy. I fried mine at 350 in a deep frier for 5 minutes twice. Definately cook themn twice as directed and serve piping hot. Sprinkle with seasoning salt for really yummy ones.

Great recipe for those who are looking for real Belgian frites. Yukon Golds are good, but I found that the starchier the potato, the better. Russets work best. Make sure that you make plenty though, as they won't last long!

You can also use leftover baked potatoes for the fries. I just cut the bakers into wedges and fry them. They stay crisp for hours, even after they are cold.

Being from Idaho, I really have a hang up on all the uses of Yukon Gold potatoes that are mentioned as a choice in recipes without regards to how they perform. While the yellow flesh looks like many European varieties, it usually does not have the solids (starch content) to make the best fresh cut fries. I would recommend the Russet Burbank variety if you want really crisp golden French fries. Ideally they should have 21% solids (the ratio of starch to water) or more and typically the Yukon Gold solids available in the grocery stores are closer to a waxy red potato than a russet. Great name though...

a very basic but great recipe. make sure to salt them immediately after they come out of the oil the 2nd time. The tip on checking oil temperature by frying the bread cubes is right on point. Also, I believe they're called "french fries" because Thomas Jefferson brought the recipe back with him after a stint as ambassador to France.

The World's best fries are Belgian. Add a Blonde beer or ale and you are all set

The tip I have is this: The first fry wait until the oil is hot enough to brown a bread cube in 45 seconds, blanch the potatoes about a minute. Remove to drain on paper towels,continue to heat oil until a bread cube browns in 10 seconds refry until desired colour, enjoy! I have done this in a regular deep sauce pan although I do have a deep fryer :) A sprinkle of paprika ( and salt if you must is a nice change.

This truly is a great way to make French Fries. If I remember my past readings correctly however, traditionally the Belgians would use rendered horse fat for frying - not an appealing thought for most Americans. Also to the lady who said she wondered why they were called "French." It actually has nothing to do with a nationality. The term is a very old term refering to the cut. In colonial days anything cut thin and long was called "frenched."

The perfect fry recipe. It's amazing how quickly they brown the second time around, so be careful!

Well, what can I say, this is really the only way to make fries (it's a historical injustice that you call them French Fries !)... I've learned to make fries while working in a Belgian 'Friture' or 'Frietkot'. And yes it is true that you need to fry them a second time at a higher temperature. A tip from a pro : you can hear it when fries are done by shaking them in the basket - they should make a dry and crispy sound against the basket... Also note that the oil or fat you use allows you to give your fries a distinct taste...

This is the best way to make deep fried potatoes. The problem with it is that on the second fry you must increase the temperature to 375 or you will not get crispy fries that are desired.
