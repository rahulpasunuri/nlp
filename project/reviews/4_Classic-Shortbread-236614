Seriously? Can people NOT read? This is NOT a store-bought dough... it is a variation of an orginal recipe. Try clicking on the original recipe to see it. My goodness.....

Are you kidding me? It's hardly a recipe if you buy a packaged dough. Come on now...

These are excellent! My Mom has asked for a second batch already! I added food coloring to the sugar topping to add more Christmas 'flair'!

First of all - this is an actual recipe, it does not use store-bought dough. Second of all, the recipe is amazing. I had made it several times and recently decided to bake several batches to use as favors for my wedding. I formed the dough into logs about 1" x 2 ", sliced & baked and they are fantastic! The texture is really light and crumbly, with a good butter and vanilla flavor. Some people really need to read more thoroughly before rating something they haven't even made.

Very easy to prepare and tasted quite good. I would make the receipe again - it was handy to have a log frozen and ready (I made into two logs)- but will continue to look for the a shortbread cookie receipe that has the classic dense, buttery texture.

For all of you who think that this requires something store-bought or isn't a recipe, you need to do some clicking. This recipe is the basic baking instructions for the butter shortbread dough, which can be found my clicking on the ingredient in this recipe. I am thrilled with this shortbread. I bake a batch (1/4 of the dough recipe) every weekend, and I'm on my last roll of dough! They're incredible. I often dust mine with a little ginger and cinnamon.

lighter than most shortbread. These simply dissapear in a crowd.I baked them in a 10 by 10 square pan let them cool and cut into squares, and they came out beautifully.Perfect with coffee or tea will make these often for the holidays.Hurry and make some!

Um, *butter shortbread cookie dough* is a link. Click it, and you'll be taken to the recipe for the log. This is a fantastic recipe. I even use it for crust to cheesecake.

what makes this a recipe?

I can give this no forks because I have never purchased this product. There is not even information about where to buy it. Possibly the most disappointing recipe I have happened upon in epicurious. Bummer!

Seriously? This is just store-bought.

I love this recipe. I used it four times before entering my rating. I prefer to use 2 or 3 logs instead of 4, so I get chewier shortbread. It is heaven. If I'm out of vanilla bean, I make sure to buy more before making these cookies. I also use fleur de sel. Mmm.
