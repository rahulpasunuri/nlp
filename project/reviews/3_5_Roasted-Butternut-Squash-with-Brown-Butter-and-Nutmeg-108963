This was a great side dish I used with some Pork Tenderloin. I used brown sugar along with a smaller amount of nutmeg and it was great. the ultimate "review" for me was everyone at the table was asking for more and wanted me to make it again immediately.

Absolutely delicious. I did add some chopped fresh sage to the butter as it browned. I also sprinkled the nutmeg on the squash prior to roasting instead of adding it to the butter to help it infuse into the squash. Even the kids went for seconds!

Agree with previous posts that brown sugar should be added -- about 1/3 cup would be right. Otherwise, the nutmeg overwhelms the dish.

Wow, loved this recipe. The savory, rich taste of the butternut squash and the brown butter just marry perfectly with the nutmeg. I added a little brown sugar and fresh sage. Delicious!

All I can say is it's incredible. It may have helped that we had the most delicious locally grown butternut squash, but even so, a fabulous simple recipe.

Nice recipe; I added about 1.5 tablespoons brown sugar, and cooked for only 35 minutes, and thought both modifications worked well.

Delicious! Made this while visiting family in South Africa and they absolutely loved it!

make sure not to add too much oil when roasting, It was a little greasy by the time a added the butter. I am sure it was my fault though. guests were happy it was not the "regular" pureed squash.

I forgot that I also added a tablespoon of light brown sugar to the squash from the start as well. Can't forget that- I think it played a huge role in making this dish so delish!!

I followed the recipe but added a couple of ingredients along the way. I roasted the squash with about 1/2 tsp of fresh thyme leaves. After 30 minutes of cooking time, I added a cup of fresh cranberries over the top. After I added the brown butter and nutmeg, I also added about 1/3 cup of coarsely chopped pistachios. The end result was divine - the perfect combination of sweet, sour, salty, and crunchy. And the colors were amazing and perfect for the holiday season.

This is my favorite way to make butternut squash, and definately one of my favorite fall side dishes. Lucky for me, it's so easy and it goes with everything! Don't be tempted to use pre-ground spices; freshly grated nutmeg and ground pepper give this dish a much spicier flavor and a more pleasant aroma. Love it!

The brown butter made this recipe. You do need to adjust the roasting time according to the size of your squash pieces.

I served this last night with the roast pork tenderloin with cranberry-port sauce from this website. The pork was a huge hit; this was just okay. It definitely got too squishy in 45 minutes; I will do it for about 30 minutes next time. Also, I will leave off the butter next time and just add the nutmeg at the end.

This dish is simple and excellent! The browned butter makes all the difference. I have been roasting butternut squash for a long time, but never thought to brown the butter. It's the only way to cook it now!

This was so easy and wonderful. I love butternut squash, so I knew I would love it, but it won over my husband, not a huge winter squash fan. The browned butter smells amazing and adds just a little extra touch to make the squash that much more interesting. Mine cooked faster than 45 minutes, so I took it out early then threw it under the broiler for a few minutes to warm it back up and make it less soggy. Make sure you use enough salt, preferably kosher. Very easy for weeknight cooking or holiday. Served with pork chops with curry onions from this site and couscous with dried fruit and almonds. Perfect meal!

Tasty & very easy. Next time I'll use the already peeled and cubed fresh butternut squash available at my grocery store.

Loved this recipe! Made it just like it said in the recipe, and the squash turned out both beautiful and tasty. The butter was the perfect amount for the squash we had too -- not overwhelming, but giving the dish some body.

After 45 mins, the butternut was a little squishy. Doesn't really need the additional butter. A nice, but intense flavour.

This is a great winter dish. The roasting really brings out the flavor, but mine was ready in 30 minutes not 45 minutes the recipe stated so watch carefully so it doesn't get mushy.

This was great. I made it as part of Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it. I've since made it without the brown butter - just roast it and then grate the nutmeg over it - and it is almost as good without the butter.

Didn't make this recipe 'per se' but just improvised something very similar the other night. Two differences: 1) steamed the squash, then dressed it with the butter and 2) seasoned the butter principally with ground sage and just a pinch of nutmeg. Wonderful flavors that highlighted the sweetness of the squash. All the family asked me to make it again.
