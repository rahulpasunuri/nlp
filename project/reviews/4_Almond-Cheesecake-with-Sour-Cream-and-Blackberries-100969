followed exactly, but I substituted cherries for blackberries. Wonderful as written, everyone raved about this cheesecake. I have been informed I will need to make it again VERY SOON. I thought the crust was a little thick in spots so I'll probably use 4 Graham Crackers instead next time. Also no need to use gelatin, just cook the fruit in a 1/3 cup of similar flavored jelly and spoon it over the top. Give the cheesecake a full 24 hours in the fridge before serving.

Just served this to a group of Gourmet Club individuals to raves and "this is a keeper" exclamations. I almost made this without the almond paste in the filling, but decided I had to try the recipe as written first....glad I did. I did use fresh blueberries and blackberries with a little water. I didn't read the directions and warmed the fruit with the fluid, which worked to soften the blueberries just a touch - they nearly popped in our mouths. The sauce didn't set up, which was fine. We just ladled in on our pieces.

I made this beautiful cake for Thanksgiving a few days ago, and I look forward to making it again. I made a point of buying whole graham crackers instead of pre-crumbed ones; this payed off, as I was able to achieve a beautiful nutty, slightly course texture when mixed with the almonds (more interesting than the usual cheesecake crust). The cheesecake portion of the dish is exactly what I have been searching for in a cheesecake recipe. If I am looking to make a slightly more low-key, subtle dessert in the future, I will definitely try just the cheesecake part with less of the almond paste, maybe topped with a thin chocolate ganache? Enjoy this recipe!

Super good, especially if you love that almond flavor. Next time might skip the almond extract, because the flavor beforehand had a nice subtlety to it..

This cheesecake is really awesome. Here's my variation - I had never boiled berries before, so when I did the fresh berries + sugar (i did 1/4 cup) + cornstarch that other reviewers had suggested i got a gloppy mess. so i mixed the berry mixture (gloppy mess) into the sour cream topping and it was AMAZING and so colorful! instead of 1c. of sour cream next time I will do 1.5 cups of sour cream. MMM. the cake filling is really what makes this dessert though - it's delicious.

This is a fantastic recipe. I also did without the gelatin and instead added a little cornstarch. I, too, just made the glaze and then used fresh blackberries on top. It is delicious and also a really pretty presentation.

This was my first cheesecake and it turned out amazing! Everyone raved and especially loved the crust. I took the suggestion to use fresh blackberries simmered down with sugar and cornstrach. Turned out wonderfully well and once it was topped with more fresh berries I had a masterpiece. Everyone should try this; not as hard as it may seem. Yummy!

I made this for New Year's Eve, and it was wonderful and easy - with one exception. I followed the recipe exactly (except I increased the almond extract to 1 teaspoon). Initially, I made the fruit topping just as the recipe stated, and it looked totally unappetizing. I suppose this could be because the frozen fruit in the package I bought was pretty smushed. I didn't put in on the cake afraid it might turn-off my guests. In an effort to save it, I went back to the market and bought seedless blackberry preserves and fresh blackberries. I placed the blackberries in a circular pattern on the cake; then, I heated up 1/2 cup of the preserves until it started to boil. After it cooled for a couple minutes I spooned it over the berries, and refrigerated it as the original recipe suggested. It was absolutely fantastic. Everyone loved it. A definite keeper.

The blackberry topping for this dessert was delicious. The almond flavor was good, but I think that I would rather have the topping on a regular cheesecake without the almond paste in the filling. I love almond flavoring, but it was a bit overwhelming(it could have been the brand I used).

What a tasty cheesecake. The prep was very easy. I had plently of crust with the recipe as written. (I started by pressing the crust to the sides and finished with the bottom of the pan.) As with other reviewers, I didn't use the gelatin but the cornstarch suggested by another reviewer. Using mostly frozen berries the cornstarch-jelly was fabulous. I topped it along the rim with fresh blackberries which looked great. The only issue I had was the center didn't set fully, which I assume was my mistake, even though I cooked it a little longer to make up for a slightly smaller pan. It still tasted wonderful, just a very messy slice...

I have been making this for years, and everyone loves it, wants the recipe and requests it on special occasions. I usually leave the berries off, then top it with whatever I have on hand. Simple chocolate sauce is great! In fact, the reason I am reviewing it now: It was requested for Christmas dinner.

Made EXACTLY AS WRITTEN and it was delicious, so feel free to make this actually following the recipe, it won't be horrible :-) In fact it will be very good, best cheesecake I've made, and I've made a few! I love blackberries and the topping was a wonderful complement to the cake - which, while rich and adequately sweet for cheesecake, is not as heavy as you might think from the ingredients. Almond flavour was just enough, in fact one person found it too strong with the 1/4 tsp, the paste - and the crust. The crust is sublime and I DID NOT DOUBLE IT. It made plenty for the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan, but none for the sides. Oh, the berries were fresh - just used about 1/3 cup water in place of the thawing juices.

I've made many cheesecakes over the years, and this is the one that everyone remembers. Absolutely sublime.

I left off the blackberry topping, but I wished I had had some other flavor to go with the almond. I thought chocolate chunks could be good in it with some slivered toasted almonds on top. A very easy recipe.

WOW! I made this recipe tonight for my husband's birthday, and it was pure ecstasy! If you like creamy rich almond flavor (such as enjoying the taste of amaretto or marizpan), you will LOVE this recipe! This was my first cheesecake ever, and it was surprisingly fast and easy. Suggestions: follow the other cook's tips and double the crust recipe (otherwise, it barely covers the bottom of the springform pan). I also used one and a half teaspoons of pure, real almond extract (I really like the almond flavor, and wanted more almond flavor versus more cream cheese flavor. It was NOT too strong with this much, whatsoever. If I had used just the quarter teaspoon, it wouldn't have that distinctive amaretto flavor. Before making the recipe, I read over all the other cook's tips to collect useful ideas. I didn't use the blackberries and gelatin (I don't like blackberries that much!) so I just followed the advice of other cooks and used 1 and 1/2 cups sour cream with 1/2 cup sugar, and used that as an "icing" to really "gild the lily." Next time, I might use some red raspberries to make a coulis, but I agree with the other chef who said that the berries are unnecessary and may actually overwhelm the almond flavoring. Definitely MAKE THIS RECIPE!

My husband loves almonds so I made this for his birthday. I had never made a cheesecake before and was a little nervous. Not only was the recipe very easy but the cheesecake was fabulous! He loved it - said it was one of the best he'd ever had (and our brother-in-law is a pastry chef). I used blueberries because that's what he likes. My berry topping never really firmed up but that may have been my inexperience (or the blueberries). It was terrific spooned on top.

This is the first almond cheesecake I've seen, let alone made. It was very good and I though frozen blackberries worked beautifully since you're creating a jellified topping anyway.

Great recipe! I used lowfat cream cheese and sour cream, but no one could tell. I would definitely suggest making 1 1/2 times the amount of crust given here, otherwise you won't have enough. Next time I will use fresh berries, since I was not overly impressed with the frozen ones. For the berry mixture, I opted to use cornstarch (as suggested previously) instead of the gelatin, and also strained it to remove pesky seeds. The consistency was perfect. I found the almond flavor to be just right, and it was enjoyed by all. Overall a big hit!

I loved this recipe. However, I have to agree less almond flavors might be better. I love almond flavor but for those that do not it could be over powering. A little Chambord added to the blackberries is really nice. Very easy recipe. Thanks

My son loves almond flavored desserts and cheesecake. So I thought great birthday cake. However, the almond was overpowering. I suggest using less. I used lowfat cream cheese and fatfree sourcream...we didn't notice the fat missing in the cheese part...it was good

I've made dozens of cheesecakes and this recipe is a keeper - a great combination of crust, filling and topping. I was lucky enough to get fresh blackberries at a local farm; I melted jelly and added pectin and the berries to make the topping. We especially loved the unique crust. Yum!

I made this cheesecake for dinner party and it was a great success! You could really taste the almonds in the crust, although maybe I'll try adding more almond paste to the cheesecake part next time. I tried another cook's suggestion of using cornstarch in the berry puree (I don't like gelatin either) and it was fine.

Very delicious, and popular. I would make 1.5 times the crust the recipe calls for and put a little less gelatin in the blackberry topping. It was a little too gelatinous.

I think this is a very good recipe. For me, though, I think the next time I will strain the blackberries or use a different fruit, because I'm not crazy about all of the seeds.

I made this a couple days ago for a friend's birthday, and it was by far the best cheesecake I've ever made or eaten! I got rave reviews from everyone who tried it too :) The almond flavor was so yummy, and the creamy texture, nutty crust, and blackberry topping were amazing. I made 1-1/2 times the crust, and I thought that amount came out perfect. I also used fresh blackberries and cooked them (except for about 15 of them) with 1/2 cup sugar and a tbsp. of cornstarch, then mashed them through a strainer to get rid of the seeds and make a puree. I poured that on top of the cheesecake after chilling it and placed the extra fresh berries on top. The deep burgundy color of the puree was beautiful, and it was just thick enough from the cornstarch to stay in place when the cheesecake was cut (I don't like gelatin). Next time, I think I'll make more of the sour cream topping because I loved its flavor and would have liked a thicker layer of it :)

Okay, the double decker white chocolate raspberry recipe used to be my favorite, but this one has taken over the title of best cheesecake. It is actually very easy to make, considering how pretty and unique it is, too. The simple preparation makes it pretty foolproof, too (unlike the double decker which is more tempermental). I have made this three times and have never been disappointed.

Outstanding cheesecake! I must say that the crust made it---I'll be using this crust on other cheesecakes (love that marzipan). Great flavor combination. Gave it 3 forks only because I think a 4-forker would have to be The Ultimate, which this isn't, but it's still fabulous.

This is the most awesome cheesecake. I've made it several times. I also had trouble the first time that I made it with getting the blackberries to gel. The next time that I made it I tried 2 teaspoons gelatin, cooked it a little longer and let it sit in the fridge longer before spooning it atop the cheesecake- this worked out great. To RK in Austin- you really shouldn't review a recipe before you try it- I think you missed the whole point of a review.

I have to agree with Ellen from Chicago, RK from Austin is off his/her rocker. Your egg ratio is too low! I don't dispute that under baking will produce a creamy cheesecake but not one that is rich! This cheesecake is wonderful. I made 3 for a school bake sale - They sold immediately! I will definitely make them again for next years, not to mention other occasions.

The reviewer from Austin is clearly an overbearing snob! I don't care if you've been making cheesecakes for 50 years, perhaps you should take a cue from all of the other cooks here who have made this recipe and try it before you trash it. I've made lots of cheesecakes for many years with all kinds of recipes, both savory and sweet, and this one happened to be very very good. I will definitely make this again!

I haven't made this yet, but I can already tell you it sucks. 3 eggs to 2 blocks of cream cheese?? Yuck. No cheesecake worth eating has a cream cheese to egg ratio of less than 2 : 1. I always use 5 blocks Philly cream cheese to 2 eggs. After eating MY cheesecake, you won't go back to anything else. And yes, mine are creamy and rich NOT hard and dense. Then again, I've been making cheesecakes for 6 years now so I can understand how novices can get a little confused as to what is a good cheesecake. I do however like the idea of making an Amaretto - Almond Cheesecake.

This was my first cheesecake - and it was fantastic! I used fresh blackberries from the backyard. I cooked half the berries with 1/2 cup sugar, strained the seeds out, added the gelatin and stirred until dissolved, then added the rest of the berries. Yum!

This is probably the best cheesecake recipe I've ever made. Cetainly the easiest. I followed the recipe exactly & it turned out perfectly. The almond flavour is quite strong but complements the blackberries wonderfully. I had a problem finding frozen blackberries for the topping, so substituted fresh berries - which we served on the side - & a coulis of unsweetened, frozen raspberries which I de-frosted with 1/4 cup of sugar & then pushed through a sieve to remove the seeds. I didn't pour this over the finished cheesecake, just made a little pool in the centre of each plate & put a slice of cheesecake on top. Definitely a keeper.

This is a wonderful cheesecake. After adding the topping we covered it in fresh blackberries. It looked great and it cut the sweetness a little.

I wish I could give this recipe 5 forks! I honestly think it was the best cheesecake I've ever had. The filling is so creamy - not hard and dense like most cheesecakes. My only problem was that my berry topping didn't gel properly. I think I didn't drain the berries enough, and the additional liquid messed it all up. Also - I couldn't find blackberries, so I used frozen mixed berries.

I think that I would double the crust recipe next time. The crust was delicious, but skimpy. I've also tried it with and without the berry topping and like it both ways!

This was absolutely sinful! I have made it 4 times so far and loved it everytime. I think it is the perfect cheescake recipe. The only changes I made were to omit the geletin adding in just a little bit of cornstarch and to subsitute mixed berries in place of blackberries. It still came out perfect.

Absolutely orgasmic...! I omitted the blackberry topping and used l l/2 cups of sour cream and half a cup of sugar for the topping. The crust is truly wonderful as is the filling. I think that the blackberry topping would spoil your tastebuds to the other delights in the crust and filling.

Mmmm! This was fantastic, and a big hit with the folks at a party I took it to. It's a particularly creamy cheesecake, and very pretty when you slice into it -- the blackberry topping sort of slides down the side of the cheesecake and looks all gooey and rich and wonderful. I'll make this one again.

Great raves from all who were blessed to taste this cheesecake. I substituted half of the cream cheese with the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it makes it a little lighter in texture. I saved some of the blackberry topping without the berries and warmed it up to make a "blackberry lake" for each slice on a plate.

This cheesecake is absolutley wonderful. It was very creamy and had a lovely almond flavor. I did make a variation. I used 1 1/2 cups of sourcream mixed with 1/2 cup sugar for the topping. And omitted the whole berry idea. Also, 3 tablespoons of sugar with 1 c. of sourcream is just not sweet enough. Especially when you omit the berries. ENJOY!!!!
