While the rice worked out okay (this was my first time making sushi), I wasn't impressed by the sushi rolls. I would choose a different recipe the next time.

I made this recipe twice, both times with white sushi rice. I would love to try the brown rice version but have to get my hands on some short-grain brown rice first... The first time there were about 7 of us and this was the only course so I multiplied the recipe by 8, skipped the sprouts and also added sliced plain omelette, but ended up with way too much (perhaps x5 would have been enough). The second time I multiplied by 4, and I was having a potluck at my place and had also made some other food. I expected around 8 people but in the end we were only 4. This time I added salmon row as well as smoked salmon to some of the rolls. I substituted sugar-snap pea sprouts. I also boiled the carrots in both cases because I didn't think that my guests would like raw carrot in their sushi. Anyway, this amount ended up yielding 6 rolls, which were much appreciated at the party. I sent some sushi home with one of my guests and had some leftover that was quickly finished the next day. I learned the second time that for the white rice recipe you are only supposed to add the vinegar mixture after it is cooked (not during). That point was a bit vague. I had made sushi before and this recipe isn't much different (other than the sprouts and the brown rice, which unfortunately I haven't tried), but is just as good as any other sushi I've had.

I love sushi, especially making it! The only problem with normal sushi is the unhealthiness of the white rice. This is exactly what I've been looking for! Thank you!

I made this the other day - had to replace the short grain brown rice with a medium grain version (what I had in my pantry) and tweaked the filling (enoki mushroom, avocado, carrots and cucumbers). It was delicious... I think the main factor was the rice seasoning which the recipe provides.

Cook your brown rice with a quality brown rice cooker , the stove top method is simply to inconsistent - no need to be a martyr.

I made this recipe as written and for my first ever attempt at making sushi, they turned out pretty well. The tip about wrapping the bamboo mat in plastic wrap really made it easier to roll and clean up! Next time I may try to make separate rolls (cucumber, avocado, etc). Also, my rolls were quite bit and so I may try cutting the nori sheet in half lengthwise to get 2 smaller rolls out of one sheet.

Wow! This recipe is delicious! My kids wouldn't stop asking for more! I prefer the brown rice myself and I really think it tasted so good!

I loved this recipe except used twice as much water as brown rice instead of the ratio specified in the recipe. The sushi rolls held together perfectly. I will make this recipe again and again expecially over the summer.

Although I haven't made this exact recipe, I do occasionally make veggie sushi rolls. They do take practice, so don't get discouraged if they turn out looking more like hearts than circles like mine did! Keep in mind, it's like a burrito, but you don't want to over-stuff them. Another helpful tip is to let them "rest" before slicing, but do not refrigerate. The resting allows the moisture to soak in the nori, which is what holds them together. My favorite fillings include avocado, of course, julienned carrots & cucumbers, marinated shiitake mushrooms (I braise them in soy sauce, usually shoyu or tamari, with a little rice wine, then allow them to cool before using them.), and sliced jalapeno, which give them a nice kick. Yum!

This is a much more healthy version of sushi. The brown rice does not stick together as well as the white, but as long as your guests accomodate. It was a hit at a football party

i make this all the time. i use short-grain brown rice, which i think sticks together easier (i've never had a problem with it falling apart).

Yum! I simply love sushi and it's unique flavor but this time it is twice as unique and twice as delicious!

I've made this several times now, but decided to add my own review now that I emailed the recipe to somebody else! I love this recipe because it uses brown rice, which adds a pleasant hint of nutty flavor (and it's healthier than regular sushi rice.) I suggest the following additional and/or alternative ingredients: green onions, shredded lettuce or baby spinach, alfalfa sprouts, slivers of raw summer squash, marinated, stir-fried extra-firm tofu, cooled and cut into thin strips, lightly steamed asparagus tips (yum!), or pretty much any firm-textured vegetable that can be cut into thin strips and eaten raw or lightly cooked. Also, if you're having trouble finding the equipment - I have a little kit I bought at Barnes & Noble, called Sushi Made Easy - comes with a lovely instruction book, two rolling mats, a rice paddle, and 4 pairs of chopsticks. Handy and helpful.

I haven't made this version, but for Andrea, I suggest looking up this site's excellent avocado and crabmeat sushi which has the ingredients she used and also has easy to follow instructions.

This was great and actually pretty easy! I added some more traditional seafood sushi ingredients and it turned out great! A tip for the bamboo roller - wrap it in plastic wrap and use scotch tape to secure the wrap in place. This makes the rolling a lot easier and more sanitary.

This was my first try with sushi and they turned out nicely. I made white rice because it was in the pantry. I also bought crabmeat and added that to the rolls (so they weren't really vegetarian, oh well). I couldn't find radish sprouts or whatever it was, but used cucumber (the regular kind, not the kind tht was called for) and carrots and avos and crabmeat. They were delish. Took some practice with rolling (and some effort tracking down a bamboo mat and nori sushi wrappers) but once I got going it was smooth sailing. I trippled the recipe because I wanted to take them to a party. I did and they were a HIT. I didn't think this would be a sushi loving crowd but turns out, they vanished. Good - less for me to lug home. Give this recipe a try, even if you're intimidated by it.

I would definitely take a sushi class or get an instructional book. I thought I knew what I was doing, but this didn't really turn out the way I wanted it to. I love sushi, but i was kind of disappointed. I tried steaming the brown rice and added the required soy sauce and rice vinegar, but the rice just wouldn't stay together. very messy. Again, have a basic understanding of how to roll sushi.

This was a terrificly satisfying summer lunch. Being on the westcoast, my boyfriend and I love sushi and this recipe was quick, easy and a lot healthier than your traditional white rice rolls.
