We were on a picnic and wine tasting in Los Olivos, CA These sandwiches were a hit. I had gotten some nice crusty italian style bread, just great. Went very well with Rusack's Chardonnay. Paul K from Cabo, MX

I made this recipe because I had almost all the ingredients on hand and it sounded interesting. It was delicious. The citrus adds just the right touch to the tapenade. (Look for the citrus tapenade recipe -it seems to be a separate recipe here. In the magazine it was included with this recipe. ) Definitely a keeper - can't wait to make this again.
