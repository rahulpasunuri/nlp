Incredible! I served this at a dinner party and everyone raved about it. I used parmesan cheese and added slightly more. I used 3 ounces of bacon and used chicken stock instead of chicken broth.

After having spent all day making homemade chicken stock and then this recipe, I feel cheated. I really do not like the flavor at all, something about pureed bacon probably did it for me. I followed the recipe exaclty (except for using homemade stock instead of canned broth) and it's just bleh. It doesn't even smell good to me. I made it for a dinner party tomorrow so hopefully overnight will mellow it a tad.

Wonderful Soup! Made it for Hanukkah and it was a hit with everyone. Didn't use the cream and it was rich and fantastic without it. I recommend simmering the soup with a heel from the pecorino (the piece that looks like wax but is really just solidified hardened cheese and won't melt into the soup but imparts intense awesome flavour) and removing it before pureeing.

My family and I love this soup so much. It's become part of my regular rotation. Here are some things I've changed: A. Maybe add a little more bacon. Not a huge deal but who doesn't love bacon?! B. Leave out the whipping cream. It's not necessary. If you feel you want to add something try subbing a little sour cream. But in my opinion even that isn't necessary. C. Don't worry about the truffle oil. Just get some truffle salt instead. Urbani brand is wonderful. Also I always use low sodium chicken broth and really any hard cheese like parmesan will do.

We followed the recipe with 2 exceptions. The piece of parm we used was probably slightly larger than a 3/4 inch cube and we used 1/2 and 1/2 vs heavy cream. It was delicious and did taste like a baked potato soup. I did not drizzle with truffle oil as it seemed rich enough without. Awesome!!!

My husband and I love soup, and this hit the spot. I didn't include the cream and it was plenty creamy.

Yum! I stayed up tonight to make this for dinner tomorrow. I'm just waiting for it to cool to put it in the fridge and I can't stop eating it out of the pot! It tastes like Loaded Baked Potato soup. I used 2 small heads of cauliflower, 3 slices bacon (set aside some for garnish), half and half (you could probably use sour cream) and used 1/2 onions and 1/2 leeks. I plan to garnish with chives and bacon, and serve with a salad. After all the Christmas shopping I did today, I didn't feel like I should spring for the truffle oil!

I made this soup for Thanksgiving 2007 and it since has become part of our soup recipe rotation. I have made the recipe with both parmesan and pecorino. The 2 cheeses have a slightly different taste but both are good. To cut calories some more, I make the soup with 4 Cups of broth and 1/4 C of heavy cream.

Rating: 3
Quick + easy. A generous drizzle of the truffle oil garnish is a must, preferably white. I also followed the recipe's suggestion for garnishing with shaved cheese, but then decided it needed a sprinkle of finely chopped chives and a quick grind of black pepper. The appearance and flavor of the soup benefitted from those additions.

Wow - Just made this and it was great! I used a parmesan/romano mixture (a small handful) and lemon drizzle instead of truffle oil. Probably next time use 1/2 the cream so its a bit healthier, but this was fantastic. Not too rich, could really taste the cauliflower and the bacon (who doesn't love bacon?). Absolutely recommend!

Rating: 0
I won't rate this because I did not follow the recipe due to lack of ingredients - but I did have a head of cauliflower. Sauteed onions, celery & garlic in olive oil and butter - added the cauliflower and chix broth. After I pureed, added freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Very tasty and super low cal and I can only imagine how great if I'd had the bacon, Pecorino, cream and truffle oil (probably omit the last two next time - truffle oil is expensive and I don't have any other uses for it).

Rating: 4
This soup is extremely tasty. I never use cream because the cheese makes it so rich (used gruyere this time because it was what I had in the house). Also, I've found that a drizzle of lemon juice is much more welcome than truffle oil.

Very good, even made without the bacon, whipping cream, and truffle oil; and with parmesan rather than pecornio. I just added more parmesan to taste.

We loved this soup. It has the most wonderful flavour and silky smooth texture. We didn't find it bland in the least and thought that everything was well balanced. I followed the advice of some reviewers and added 1 scant tbsp. smoked paprika and 2 tbsp. finely chopped fresh thyme. Also used more garlic and cheese than the recipe called for. Grated the cheese. Used half vegetable broth and half chicken broth. Bacon flavour was very subtle. Had to thin the pureed soup with additional broth because it was too thick, but this may have been because of the extra cheese. Didn't add the whipping cream as the soup was so creamy without it. Garnished with shredded cheese and a pinch of finely chopped thyme.

Rating: 3
this modest little soup is fantastic. If you don't want to splurge on the truffle oil, just add toasted pecans to the mixture before you puree it. It lends it an earthiness, without the price tag. And makes the color of the soup slightly darker, which I think looked more rustic.

Rating: 4
easy, fresh and healthy - I used turkey bacon like others.

YUM! I roasted the cauliflower along w/ a head of garlic and otherwise followed the recipe. It is fabulous tasting out of the pot (still on my stove in fact). The flavors are perfect even w/o the truffle oil. Can't wait to serve it w/ the truffle oil!

I made this today without the celery (allergic) and without the truffle oil (mine was old). I also used Parm/Reg rather than Pec/Rom. I didn't realize I was supposed to leave the bacon in and add everything else so I removed the bacon to drain and went on with it. I'm not a big fan of pureed soups but this one clearly needed pureeing after the 20 min cooking time. It pureed beautifully and I liked the thickness after adding the cream without adding any more broth. I added the crumbled bacon as a garnish along with generous Parm/Reg shavings. Added a little salt & freshly ground pepper. If I were to do anything differently, it would be to cut the 3/4 inch cube of cheese into a couple of smaller pieces so it would melt better. This is divine -- even without the truffle oil (which I intend to pick up while I'm out this afternoon) and even with the bacon pieces as garnish instead of in the soup. Delicious! Easy! Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
This soup is wonderful, smokey and savory. I used more bacon than the recipe calls for which made the soup richer and more flavorful. I give it four forks with he white truffle oil as a garnish, the oil makes it truly spectacular! Without the white truffle oil it's still a respectable three forks.

Rating: 4
Very Good! I skipped the bacon and made it with 1/2 Tbs rendered bacon fat; roasted the onion, garlic and cauliflower quarters in the oven for an hour and then simmered in chx broth and pecorino. Finished the soup as written pureeing with whipping cream and black truffle oil.

Rating: 3
I didn't feel like doing bacon and I didn't miss it. But the white truffle oil is what makes this extraordinary. A snap to whip up and pairs great with a prosciutto sandwich with a smear of goat cheese and some baby arugula. Easy but impressive weeknight meal or lunch.

Made this tonight after coming home from golfing, can't golf but I can follow a recipe. Just a touch of seasoning and pinch of white pepper. This soup was delicious, savoury and each ingredient stood out in a subtle way. Didn't have 'applewood'- used regular bacon and aged parmesan then grated asiago. The truffle oil certainly complimented all of the flavours- a keeper for sure!

Everyone loved this. I omitted the celery and used normal bacon. I drizzled a touch of white truffle oil. I added around 3tsp salt which was too much, perhaps just 1 tsp salt next time.

We loved this. I used a few drops of a good, local white truffle oil and it was delicious in the soup. My 12 yr old ate two large bowls. I added about a Tbsp of smoked paprika and that added a lot to it also.

Lovely soup. Did make some changes. Sauteed veggies in olive oil & butter instead of bacon fat and used thin, crisped smoked turkey as garnish (we don't eat pork) along with shavings of Reggiano. Tasted with and without scant drops of the costly truffle oil. Hands down, truffle oil nails it - delicious (but do use sparingly or you'll taste nothing else).

This soup is really delicious and hearty. I decided to roast the cauliflower 1st in the oven to give it more flavor...but do not salt the cauliflower prior to roasting...the bacon and stock made my a tad too salty overall.

This soup was good, but certainly not outstanding. I used white truffle oil, which I thought imparted a slightly unpleasant taste. This may, however, just reflect my aversion to flavours of the fungi variety and if you are keen on mushrooms and the like, this may be for you. I used milk instead of cream, which worked fine. The cauliflower provides a creamy texture on its own and doesn't necessarily need the cream if you are monitoring fat/calorie intake.

I thought that the bacon totally overpowered the soup. But it was still pretty good. Next time I make it I will either lose the bacon entirely or use a lot less than the 2 oz. However, the pecorino and truffle oil are a MUST!

i made a rather large modification of necessity  when i got home, i discovered that the head of cauliflower i had was TINY. But i also had 5 or 6 parsnips, so I tossed those in with about 2 cups of cauliflower. Was AMAZING! Garnished with a little bit of chives and used half whole milk and half 1%  was definitely rich enough. Make this!

I never thought something so healthy could taste like such a treat! I never use the cream; pureeing the cauliflower makes the soup creamy enough, plus then I can freeze it and not worry about the cream separating. A little bit of truffle oil goes a long way. Mmmmmmm!

This soup is so good. I made this for my "non-vegetable eating" boyfriend back in January when it was first released in Bon Appetit and he scarfed it down. I have made it many times since then. It's super easy to make with only a few really basic ingredients. The flavours are wonderful. The nutty flavour from the cauliflower really shines in this soup and is further enhanced by the smokey flavour from the bacon. I usually make this with parmesan rather than romano as that is what I usually have in my fridge. And when I have one I throw in my parmesan rind too for extra yumminess. Using a hand blender saves on time, and dishes. I highly recommend this soup. It's a keeper.

I love the flavor and texture of the cauliflower and the smokiness from the bacon. I subbed leeks for onions and extra virgin olive oil for truffle oil.

This recipe is quite good and I would definitely make it again. It's a great way to get your veggies in. I kept in the bacon (using lean-cut) but put in a mix of skim milk and fat-free half-n-half, which still made for a rich soup, but not over the top. Mingling the flavors of pecorino romano and truffle oil really make this soup.

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but this soup just wasn't anything special. I didn't like the color of the soup or the flavor. Maybe it was my black truffle oil -- can it go bad?

This is an oustanding recipe. I don't care for cauliflower all that much myself -- I made this for my wife and daughter, who love it -- but even I was ga ga for the great taste. A very nice smokey flavor. I don't think this needs any salt added at the end, the bacon and cheese gave it plenty of salty flavor.

so decadent! a perfect starter to a hearty winter meal, or great with salad for lunch. I'm a vegetarian, so i used fake bacon and it gave a nice smoky flavor with out overpowering and used evo to saute the onion and celery, (i used shallots) and veg stock. I used fresh ground white pepper to season. My husband LOVED this dish. Will be a fixture in my cooking!!

3 forks instead of 4 because I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it as much without some changes. I used pancetta instead of bacon, just for kicks, and a bit more than 2 ounces. Instead of onion and celery I used one small onion and some shallots. Using real pecorino romano definitely makes a difference here, as does the truffle oil. I love creamy cauliflower soup anyway, but the cheese and truffle oil really make it special. I used black truffle oil, as I think white can be too subtle for some of the other potent flavors in this recipe. Would def. make again - with fresh bread and a glass of white wine it's a wonderful weekday indulgence.

sarahbean: a better way to add a touch of smokiness to the soup without using bacon is to use spanish smoked paprika. The soup would also be great without the added smokiness. You could also try garnishing the bowls with a fruity olive oil.

I made it as written, using my homemade chicken stock. Delicious. Very flavorful. I tried truffle oil for the first time. I am not sure if I like it. I don't think you need much.

Interesting flavors, but was a little bitter tasting. I would suggest since the cheese is a strong component of the soup, getting a good quality cheese is important for this recipe. I think adding a potato or two would also help mellow the flavor.

Simply Sensational! Did not have applewood smoked bacon so used hickory smoked instead. Otherwise, made it according to the recipe. This dish was a rave at a dinner party. Making it a day ahead gives all the ingredients time to meld together!

As a nutritionist I often pare down recipes in fat content. With this soup I decided to half the bacon but not omit as it adds a smokey flavor and only add whipped cream at the table ( approx 1 tbsp), I also added a potato to the soup to soften the taste and texture. Wonderful soup for this time of year.

A delicious soup. I tasted as I went along and think I liked it better without any cream. Also, after processing in the food processor I thought I would prefer a smoother soup so put it in my blender. This produced an amazingly velvety soup - perfect as a starter soup for a dinner party. The black truffle oil added an intriguing touch.

An excellent and classy version of cauliflower soup. I used a rind of parm. that I had waiting in the fridge - bigger than the recipe called for. The bacon is subtle but evident, very nice. The truffle oil makes it really outstanding. I'll try straining it next time for a finer texture, and maybe a small bit of watercress on top, then drizzled with the truffle oil. Serve with crusty bread, glass of wine ... heaven!

Awesome! We are on low carb diet and this recipe fit the bill perfectly. Very reminiscent of Potato Soup, but the truffle oil and romano made it sublime. I don't much care for cauliflower alone, but this soup is definitely going into the rotation.

This was absolutely delicious and fairly easy to make. I'll make it again, but next time I'll drain more of the bacon fat and use half-and-half instead of heavy cream. I'd also suggest cooking half the bacon separately and using it as a topping: a pinch atop each serving along with a pinch of shaved romano and a cauliflower floret.

This was absolutely delicious. Also, extremely easy to prepare. It was actually even better the 2nd day. I used a high quality parmasean rather than romano. The truffle oil, and you only need a few drops, makes this simply spectacular. I highly recommend this easy and fairly healthy dish (i used 1/2 and 1/2 mixed w/non-fat milk and i highly doubt this diminished the flavor.)
