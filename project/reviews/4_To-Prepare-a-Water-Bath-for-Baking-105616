I try to avoid water baths, but a lot of bread puddings call for one, as do cheesecakes. I would say that the key to limiting the sloshing of hot water is the size of the baking and roasting pans. I recently made a cheesecake, and the square baking pan went into the rectangular roasting pan. When it went into the oven, I didn't push it into the middle, and kept it toward the front. That seemed to help. As did the fact that the space between the baking pan and roasting dish was enough for my mittens to fit in and lift them gently. Ultimately, I think practice is what'll help. Just don't use one of those disposable aluminum pans to hold the bath. I burned myself doing that!

I have made the Pumpkin Flan (Gourmet Nov 05) for 3 Thanksgivings now, and always dread the part where I take it out of the water bath at the end. Pulling out the oven rack with hot water threatening to slosh into the flan-or me-is just really stressful. Is there any secret trick to getting a dish out of the water bath without burning yourself or soaking your potholders in the process? I am getting ready to put this on my menu again, and would love any tips from anyone out there...Before you tell me to forget the flan, think again. It's just too good!

For the Baltimore Cook: a water bath is supposed to provide an even-ness to the heating of the custard.

I'm displaying my ignorance here but I've always wondered...what is the actual purpose of the hot water bath called for in a recipe?

This is to Maria in Amsterdam who entered on 05/14/04 her problem with water entering the springform pans in bain marie. Maria, no matter how expensive your pan is - even those with glass bottoms - will always have some water filtering in. THIS IS WHY YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO WRAP THE OUTSIDE OF THE PAN VERY WELL WITH A LAYER OR TWO OF ALUMINUM FOIL COVERING THE PAN TO A HEIGHT GREATER THAN WHERE THE WATER WILL REACH. HOPE THIS WILL HELP YOU.

Question: I've put a springform into a hot water bath (to make a cheese cake). But water seems to always get into the springform. Any ideas on how I can stop it from leaking in?

A Silpat or other silcon baking sheet also makes a good non-slip surface in a water bath.

I found it helpful when someone told me to fold a kitchen towel and place it in the bottom of the pan. This cuts down on splashing and keeps the ramekins from sliding around quite so much.

Ok, let's be a little kind....many of us cooks know this, but as a cooking school instructor, you would be surprised how many people need to know each and every step. I am sure many readers appreciate that they explain it.
