I cannot rate this recipe since I would never cook a "sancocho" this way. It has nothing to do with the traditional puertorrican beef stew or sancocho, which must have a good sofrito to begin with. Sofrito needs cilantro, recao, garlic, sweet peppers, olives, capers and other good things. Never parsley, that's not part of puertorrican cooking tradition. And to complete a good sancocho you need root vegetables such as yam, malanga, sweet potato, also green plantains, calabaza, breadfruit if available. After prolongued, slow cooking you will have a thick broth that is the essence of a good puertorrican sancocho or beef stew. I grew up with weekly sancochos, so I know what I am talking about. Now I will have to cook a sancocho to stop my cravings.

This stew may be good but it's definitely not the traditional Puerto Rican beef stew. We do not use parsley & thyme and the flour and beef broth are absolutely unnecessary. Essential ingredients are missing (sweet chili peppers, cilantro garlic, bay leaf, vinegar, among others) and the total cooking time of approx 1 1/2 hrs will leave you with tough meat in a very watery sauce.

I'm not Puerto Rican, but I thought the same thing as many of the other reviewers...there are no "Puerto Rican" ingredients in the whole stew! Thank you, Ochie from San Juan, for your recipe. I am making yours tonight. By the way, how much water (or broth or wine)? Thanks!

Puerto Rican stew? Where's the adobo, the sofrito? My husband is PR, and this recipe has nothing in common what he calls Puerto Rican stew. I will skip this recipe.

Simple and delicious. Added some adobo and sazon, left out the thyme and added some coriander and a dash of cumin. Served with fresh bread. Easy!

This is not puertorican at all. But I made it anyways. I added oregano, cilantro, and sofrito. It was great.

To be candid, the recipe looked ordinary so I followed the review of the cook from P.R. for her stew. It was pretty good but I would not make it again. Not enough flavor. I about quadrupled the spices and added cumin, and it was satisfying but not delicious. Thank you for the recipe, though.

Why Puerto Rican? This recipe sn't ethnic at all. And it's pretty bland.

There is nothing Puerto Rican about this stew!! I haven't made it but I can see just reading the recipe that there's no Puerto Rican element to it what so ever!

Boring. Where is the Puerto Rican bit?

I forgot to add to my previous review that the recipe included is the basic recipe for Puerto Rican Stew or Carne Guisada, as we call it. You can certainly substitute beef broth for the water which is what I do when cooking for my customers and you can also add wine, if you like. Some people add the bouillion cubes to the water and bay leaves as well. Enjoy.

Why this is titled Puerto Rican Stew is beyond me. This is not the way we make stew. We don't even use thyme in our cooking. If I may, the following is the correct way to cook a Puerto Rican Stew: 2 lbs. beef for stew; 2 1/2 tsp.salt; 2 cloves of garlic, mashed; 1/4 tsp. dried mexican oregano; 1/8 tsp. black pepper; 1/4 cup olive oil; 1 tomato, 1 green pepper, 1 medium onion, about 4 sprigs of cilantro, all of this diced; 1 tsp. chopped capers; 6 olives; 1/3 cup tomato sauce; 5 potatoes, cut up into large cubes. Add salt to cubed meat. Smash the garlic, oregano and black pepper into a paste. Add 1 tblsp. of olive oil to paste and dress the meat with it. Rest 1/2 hour. Heat the rest of oil in dutch oven and brown the meat for about 8 to 10 min. Add the diced veggies, tomato sauce, capers and olives. Cook for 3 min. Add water and bring to a boil. Lower heat adn cook for 1 1/2 hours. Add potatoes and cook another 1/2 hour or until meat and potatoes are tender and the sauce has thickened. Now THAT is our stew. Serves about 6

I love this recipe, though I have made a couple of slight changes... I use a dark beer instead of the wine. I just love the taste. Also I use boullion cubes instead of the beef broth.

I've made this twice now and just love it. Browning the meat WELL is important. I use bouillon cubes and extra water--find the broth is too intense otherwise. I add cabbage at the last minute--adds a good crunch and fresh flavor.

I was disappointed. The flavor was bland and the stew was mushy. The potatoes had almost disintegrated by the time the sauce thickened and were completely undetectable in the leftovers.

This recipe was superb and reminded me of my grandfather's famous beef stew (he is not Puerto Rican by the way, he is Jewish!!). I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and some peas. It tasted much better the next day! I also recommend letting this dish cook as long as you can because everything gets softer with more cooking time and much more delicious! Definitely make this recipe!

I thought this recipe was lacked flavor. I can't pinpoint it, but I wouldn't make it again.

Very flavorful fall/winter comfort. I cut the potatoes smaller, so they got slightly mushy -- please don't repeat my mistake. Also added a sprinkle of Worcestershire sauce and one peeled, chopped tomato along with the green beens.

I loved this recipe! The wine is a key ingredient, as it provided a rich flavor. I cut the recipe in half, and I also replaced the onion with mushrooms and sprinkled in about two teaspoons of onion salt. Next time, I'll make it in the crock pot.

Fantastic! Skipped the Irish beef stew to try a simpler version and was very impressed. Would recommend more liquid (one more cup of stock) as I found when simmering that the stew began to dry out.

This recipe was DELiCIOUS and so easy to prepare. The flavors were wonderful. I omitted the green beans and it was still great. Used baby carrots for simplicity. A definite keeper.

The wine flavor dominates here. If you love wine, you will really like this stew. We used an Italian Barolo which gives a rich, full flavor.

I adapted this for my crockpot by putting the beef and flour in first and mixing well and decreasing the beef broth to 1 cup. I put all ingredients in at once. I found this to be very good and easy.

The next time I will cover the pot and cook longer to allow the potatos and the meat to tenderize a little more. Over rice is how my mother always served her stew.

a pretty basic stew. Not too interesting.
