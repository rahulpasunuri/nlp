I love this recipe though I don't add some of the ingredients. I leave out the egg, celery and peppers and the salad is so yummy! I always get rave reviews!!!!

This is NOT like any potato salad served in New York! Too many peppers! A dash of celery seed, perhaps. There are tons of good recipes out there. Pass on this one.

I thought the color (pink) was a bit unnerving and that it needed onion. It was just kinda blah.

I've had this in my files since I clipped it from the magazine, but as I love onions, just never made it because they aren't there. Last night I needed a quick potato salad and had all the ingredients but hot paprika, so threw it together. I used sweet Hungarian paprika and a dash of cayene, but otherwise followed recipe as written using small bell peppers. We loved it, and it was perfect with brats in buns that had the onion on them. Definitely will make it again.

Too many bell peppers and if it weren't for them, the salad would be bland! If this is indicative of the potato salad served in New York, I'll be sure to never order potato salad there.

This is the first bad review I have given but I think it is personal taste. Unlike others, I love celery in potato salad and I think the peppers were what I objected to and usually I like peppers. But, not in potato salad. This kind of reminded me of the kind sold in grocery stores.

A great recipe! I added just a bit more of the Hungarian hot parika to give it more of a kick. The sweetness of this potato salad is what makes it so unique. A real winner!

Loved it! Super BBQ standard side. I replaced white wine vinegar with tarragon vinegar and reduced the celery to one stalk.

I am not a celery fan so I omitted it from the recipe, but it was still a hit when I served it for the BBQ. I,too, used Colman's English Dry Mustard.

I live far from a grocery store, so I fiddled with the recipe. I decreased the celery stalk to one, because celery can overpower any dish. I used Colman's Dry English Mustard, which I think made a difference.
