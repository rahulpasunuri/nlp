I made these and the pecan Mexican wedding cakes on this site and have a couple of comments. They taste absolutely wonderful, especially these with the cherries and pistachios. The other recipe calls for refrigerating the dough for 30 minutes. This one doesn't and I would agree that it absolutely doesn't need cooling. As dry as these are, once cooled, they can't be rolled. Next time, I'll bake them immediately after mixing. Some reviewers have suggested adding more oil. I'd agree. I melted 1/4 stick butter and added it to these and it made what was just crumbs hold together long enough to bake. The powdered sugar is a mess and, since I'm making these for an actual wedding, that matters. I rolled some in sugar before baking and others after to see which I liked better and I think that rolling before will work better when the occasion is a formal one. All that being said, these are the richest cookies I've ever eaten. It was hard to finish one, they were so rich. But they were sure good.

these cookies are amazing, but for some reason I always end up with only about 48-50 cookies instead of the 80 the recipe is meant to yeild. has anybody else had this problem of am I doing something wrong?

I made these for my son's Spanish class. The teacher loved them! They were tender and the cherries added a tartness to balance the sweetness of the powdered sugar. Very good. I will make them again.

This is my favorite cookie of all time! The only thing I change is that I chop the cherries before adding them so the cookies are less brittle. The recipe doubles nicely and they are a hit with the whole family.

Very yummy! I was unsure how they would turn out after reading mixed reviews, but was happy to find they turned out wonderfully! I followed the recipe exactly except that I baked for only 13 minutes. The dough is crumbly after adding the flour, but found that didn't make any difference since the dough needed to be formed into footballs anyway. One level tablespoon of dough makes a perfect two bite cookie. When making again, I'll omit the teaspoon of salt. The cake flour adds enough saltiness.

I made this recipe for a work party and used whole wheat cake flour and did not add the pistachios and cherries/cranberries. Instead I put a little cinnamon in the coating. Everyone raved.

I made this cookie, listening to some of the advice. I added chocolate to this...i soaked hte cherries in vodka. I didn't have cake flour so just used all regular flour and reduce amt to convert to cake flour. I didn't have problems with coming together. These are very good. I took them to a training event and a huge amount of people tried them and really liked them. will make again

I thought these were wonderful. The dough is a bit crumbly, but I think it is supposed to be -it's more like pastry dough than cookie dough. If you squeeze it into shape with your fingers, it will come out just fine!

Loved this cookie. After reading all reviews, I made the following changes: (1)Used parchment paper instead of buttering. No mess and I was able to slide the paper and cookies onto cooling racks. (2)Substituted vanilla vodka for the extract, added it to the cherries, which I had chopped, and let it sit while I continued with the other prep work. (3)Toasted the nuts in preheated oven for 5 minutes, then chopped and cooled them. (4)Added 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, chopped, and left in freezer until used. (5)Spooned flour into measuring cups, then sifted. (6)Thoroughly incorporated flour into butter mixture by hand and then returned to stand mixer for a few pulses to finish the job. (7)Used a small cookie scoop and got about 8 dozen out of the batch. Next week I plan to make these again. But I will substitute cream cheese for some of the butter, cranberries for the cherries, pecans for the pistachios, add a little orange zest and perhaps some white chocolate chips. Can't wait to see how those turn out!

Rating: 4
Excellent. I rubbed the pistachios in a towel to loosen some of the hull and put them in a coarse sieve to remove the powdery stuff. I used dried cherries, chopped, and only one Tbls. vanilla (not big on vanilla). The dough was crumbly, so I formed balls instead of football shapes, worked just fine. Also, I don't like things very sweet, so I only dusted them with powdered sugar after they had cooled on a cooling rack. By the way, instead of buttering baking sheets (messy), use parchment paper. Virtually no clean up!

Rating: 4
Agreed, smaller is better, and it needs a spoon of cream to hold together. Came out nicely. Requires a lot of sugar to keep outside from being sticky. I shook off excess before serving to avoid causing sneezing! Maybe will soak cherries in rum or cognac next time for a little more oomph.

Rating: 4
Oh man! These are so delicious! They will be part of my annual holiday cookie baking from now on. I didn't have cake flour so I substituted 1 C of all purpose flour less 2 tablespoons plus 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for every cup of cake flour (something I found on the web). It worked perfectly! The cookies hold together much better than other very short cookie recipes I've tried.

Rating: 2
These tasted good (with all that butter, how could they not?) but I could not work the dough. I lost at least two batches that would not hold together. They were also a bit dry. I'll look for another recipe for a similar cookie next time. I wouldn't make this again.

Rating: 3
Like another reviewer, I was a little wary about making these after the wide range of reviews I read, but they turned out delicious. I made about 75, and a few of those were HUGE, so I'd say the 80 count is about accurate. I added a little cinnamon to the mix, and I since I didn't have a full cup of pistachios in the house, I topped it off with pecans. I did find the dough REALLY crumbly, so I added a little bit of milk as I went (probably about 1/4 cup total). Next time I'll try them with a bit of orange zest like another reviewer suggested. They were great!

Rating: 4
These cookies were a big hit! I halved the recipe but was almost immediately baking another batch. I used almonds instead of pistachios, and used 1/2 cup ground almonds in place of 1/2 cup of the flour. Also used dried cranberries and brandied cherries, and added some chocolate chips. Did not shape into footballs, just rounded teaspoons and then rolled in powdered sugar after cooling. Delicious!

Rating: 3
These were a nice twist on wedding cookies- since the cherries add some chewiness. I would have to say, though, that based on taste I prefer the traditional wedding cookie with pecans or walnuts. Pistachios are not nearly as flavorful, as others have noted. Overall pros: nice holiday colors with the green/red, very tender cookie, and an interesting change. Cons: a bit time-consuming to make the footballs (although that's a cute shape), not as nutty/toasty tasting as normal wedding cookies. If you do make them, definitely make them smaller than suggested, and if you use salted nuts and butter, just cut the salt in the dough. I had to hand- chop the cherries since the food processor didn't chop them up. Worked for the nuts but not the cherries. The dough is crumbly but I found that it formed together fine when squeezed/ formed into shapes. Nice cookie but for me, not quite as good as the original.

Rating: 4
I loved how these cookies turned out! I followed the recipe as directed, but then made the recipe again, eliminated the dried fruit and used chopped hazelnuts. They came out great this way too. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the dough was on the dry side, so I added milk by the tablespoon, till the dough came together properly. Great recipe though; this one's a keep!

Rating: 3
Wonderful and easy. I substituted chopped dried apricots, and added a bit of milk to the dough as it was very dry. Excellent, gone in minutes.

Rating: 4
Absolutely marvelous. I followed the recipe except for using only one tablespoon vanilla. I chopped the nuts and cherries with a knife, a food processor does not work. As other reviewers noted, I ended up with a crumbly dough. I refrigerated the dough for 15 min. or so to be sure the butter was cold and would not start to melt when forming the cookies. Rather than struggling to make a football shape, I made balls. For the size of my cookies (I yielded 48), it took 20 min per batch. Also, use parchment paper instead of buttering the baking sheet, far less messy.

The ends did not justify the means. Could not find unsalted pistachios, then the dough was extremely crumbly and hard to form. Tasted ok, but wanted to be blown away.

These cookies are wonderful! I love wedding cookies, and the additions really add something. I had a problem with the dough being really flaky and hard to handle. I refrigerated it for 30 minutes and it helped. But I refrigerated half of the dough for a day (ran out of time to shape all 80), and it made it more dry, flaky, and hard to work with. I'd imagine I did something wrong with the butter and it is not the fault of the recipe. They tasted great nevertheless. Also, I would have liked the pistachio flavor to be less subtle; I'm not sure I could taste them at all. Maybe a small increase in chopped pistachios would help, or a mix of salted and unsalted. A final note: I also did not use cake flour, but added 1 T of milk to lighten the batter.

These turned out beautifully. I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems. This is a nice twist on the traditional recipe. They were a big hit at my holiday party. One of my friends called the next day asking for more as she was craving them!

These are lovely and a nice change from all the chocolate we seem to consume around the holidays. I think the orange zest is essential, great suggestion. I also chopped the cherries and made smaller cookies than the recipe recommended. The flavors improve so this is a good cookie to make early in the holiday baking season.

OK so in all actuality I HATE Mexican wedding cakes they are dry and powdery in my opinion they are just bad --- now i made these this year for my sister because it is one of her favorites we just rolled them into circles like normal. they are very good and the cranberries give it a moisture I think I will make these yearly now very good!

I am shocked by the high reviews on this recipe. I think that there is too much flour.These should melt in your mouth and these cookies do not. I have been making Mexican Wedding Cakes my entire life, I have never used cake flour. Use some cream to hold together the crumby dough- or better yet use a more traditional recipe with ground pecans- you will be glad. blech!

Rating: 4
I was a little hesitant to make these cookies because of the wildly contrasting experiences people have had. Some say they are easy and wonderful, others say they are a disaster. I'm happy to report that they came out perfectly. I used flour that says "presifted" on the label, so I measured without sifting. Maybe that helped. The only change I made was to add a few drops of natural orange oil (I didn't have any orange zest). They are really special!

Me again from the 12/13 disaster. Before tossing the dough, I added flour. A lot of flour. Honestly, I think the ingredient list should have instructed you to dip & sweep the flours, THEN sift. In weight (using conversions from RLB's Cake Bible), this means 433g cake flour & 242g AP Flour -- not 333g cake flour & 190g AP Flour, as is currently written.

I made this recipe last year and had been thinking about it recently, so I tried it again. The cookies are both light and buttery- a perfect combination! I used 4 and 2/3 cup sifted all purpose flour (there was no cake flour on the Upper East Side!), and added 1 T milk with the vanilla and salt. I made the cookies teaspoon size and baked them on parchment paper for 15 minutes.

A fabulous cookie. I froze the cherries and smashed them like I would ice cubes to cut them up. Much easier this way. I also took it a step further. I rolled the cookies in the powdered sugar and then rolled them in Dutch processed unsweetened cocoa. I had my neighbors do a taste taste. They loved both but chose my "spumoni" cookies over the regular recipe. This will be a regular cookie in my collection. I can't wait to make some more. They are so fast and easy to do. They are molto bene!

Rating: 4
Delicious. This is an upgade to my mom's holiday favorite. Thanks for the tip to cut the cherries. I bought the cake flour that helped with the lightness. I also agree that the tablespoon is too big, a teaspoon version is easier to eat with one bite to reduce the flying powdered sugar!

Rating: 4
These cookies rock! I added a tablespoon of cream to the batter with the salt and vanilla and used APF in total (I didn't have any cake flour in the house). I did chop both the cherries and nuts, as suggested. These cookies are gorgeous and taste wonderful. I bet they will be better tomorrow!

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly (except I chopped the cherries) and found that a generous tablespoonful made enormous cookies. I only got 50 out of the batch, and they took more than 16 minutes to bake. A level tablespoon is more manageable. I also dusted the tablespoon with flour between each cookie and it worked well as a mold.

Rating: 1
Unmitigated disaster. There is something totally wrong with the proportions here. These liquified into flat pancakes after 7 minutes in the oven -- even after freezing them solid before baking. I'm a fairly experienced baker, and am shocked at how poorly these hold together. I checked, rechecked & weighed all ingredients, used the specified combo of cake vs AP flour. I verified my oven temp. The only thing I did differently was use Silpat instead of buttered pans. There seems to be way too much butter vs dry ingredients. The only thing I can think of is, maybe they mean to pack the flour into the measuring cups and then sift it? I can't even imagine! I won't try this again, just wanted to warn the innocent!

I just made a pile of these, and everyone loved them! I could not find unsalted nuts, but I did find instructions on unsalting the ones I had... Before you chop them slide them into boiling water for 20 seconds. Strain the nuts and pop them right into a 400º oven to firm back up. It took mine around 10 minutes to crisp up. They will still feel soft when out of the oven so let them cool, and they firmed up so I could chop them. I left them fairly big pieces. Super yummy!

These are delicious, and really easy to make. The recipie makes TONS of cookies, over 80 if you make smaller sizes. The dried cherries should definitely be chopped, as they are moist and will take the crunch out of the cookie if left whole. As well, the small cookies will crumble around the large cherries if you leave them whole.

Excellent twist on what I remember as "snowball" cookies as a child. I liked the crunch of the nuts and chewiness of the dried cherries contrasted with the tenderness of the cookie. I could not find unsalted pistachios, so I used salted and omitted the 1t of salt called for in the recipe and this worked fine. I also could only find dried cherries that included sugar, so I reduced the sugar in the recipe a bit. I would have liked the tartness of the unsugared cherries, but these were good nonetheless. I actually thought these were better after the first day. Kept them about a week. Will make again.

I didn't make these cookies but I ate them and they are SO good.
