A GoTo recipe in our household. It is super simple and tastes amazing. Also used it for an appetizer at a progressive dinner party, cutting it into bite-sized pieces and serving with picks. No recipe adjustments needed.

This was a super easy and delicious recipe. I marinated the steak overnight, and it was full of flavor once cooked. Instead of rice, I served it with German Spaetzle as a side dish, which made the whole meal come together. My dinner party was raving about it.

Absolutely fabulous! Made wild rice with it - my husband asked why so much rice - we ate every bit covered with the lovely sauce. We cooked it medium rare & sliced it much thiner than instructed. First made the recipe last week - made it again last night. Definitely a KEEPER!

This recipe is simple and very tasty. The meat on top of the veggies gives a great presentation on the plate and covers all the food categories required in a meal. I serve with fresh baked bread and it makes a perfect meal. My husband and son love it.

Very Good. Made as written, wouldn't change a thing. Veggies under the meat makes for a beautiful presentation. 4 adults ate the whole thing.

We made this for our dinner club and it was amazing! The only change we made was using shitake mushrooms in lieu of the crimini - we couldn't find them. It turned out delicious and oh so tender! We will definitely make this one again and again and again! Thanks!

It's interesting how many seemingly similar teriyaki-like sauces turn out too harsh or too sweet. The one that forms the basis of this recipe is just about perfect--mellow and flavorful. The entire recipe is a gem--great with many combinations of vegetables. Tonight I used shiitake mushrooms, carrots, string beans, broccoli and grilled onion with delicious results. I always increase the sauce by at least half what the recipe calls for--it really makes the dish.

The marinade was terrific. Robust and flavorful. I marinaded tri-tip overnight, pan fried to sear, and then put in the oven at 350 to finish. Very juicy and tender. The only addition I made to the marinade was 1/8 to 1/4 t. of cayenne. It added a nice kick. Will use again.

Really wonderful. Made the entire sauce recipe for only twoo people and it enjoyed having the extra sauce. Did not have cornstarch, so used about 1 tbs flour instead.

I love this recipe and my kids love it too I even use this marinade on chicken and steak off the grill

Rating: 2
Fair at best. Not awful but certainly not going to make the list of "serve agains". Flavor was very strong - no real taste of the beef underneath. Should have served the sauce on the side - it really was too much. Also, not much tenderizing effect from the marinade. There are better flank steaks out there - I'm not even going to bother to save the leftovers.

Rating: 3
This is one of our favorite ways to make flank steak. The marinade doesn't overwhelm the taste of the beef but the sauce is a great complement. The veggies are yummy but I will usually vary the selection, depending on how much time I have. Tonight is a sake glazed frozen stir-fry mix... (shhh)

This recipe was great. I got rave reviews... I made some changes to make it a little more summer friendly: I added 1 chopped shallot the to the marinade. I grilled the steak, peppers, and asparagus. I have a gas burner on the side of my grill so I sauted the mushrooms in a little olive oil and added the marinade to the mushrooms. Instead of crimini, I used a mixture of baby portabellas, shitake and oyster mushrooms. (I strained the marinade first to get all the little chunks of ginger and shallots out.) When the mushrooms were almost done, I added the onions and cooked for about 2 more minutes. Instead of adding 2T of cornstarch, I mixed the cornstarch with a little cold water and added about 1/2t of that to the mushroom-marinade. 2T of cornstarch would have been WAY too much. The mushroom marinade really made the dish. It was fabulous.

Rating: 4
This is such a great recipe, easy to make and so tasty. It got rave reviews from my husband, a man who always says how much he hates fresh ginger. I used a splash of bourbon and a generous splash of red wine instead of sake because the only bottle at the store was $31.99. I also made the recipe with top sirloin steak since I had just picked some up. I strained the marinade after I boiled it then I returned back to the pan and thickened it with a mixture of 2 teaspoons cold water & 2 teaspoons cornstarch and it was perfect. I plan on serving this to friends next time I entertain. YUM!

This is simple to prepare and tastes quite good. I did cook the steak on the grill, which really simplified the preparation and cleanup.

I have made this recipe several times (for as many as fifty people once). It is both impressive and easy, which makes it ideal for company and large gatherings. I have also made it with several different meats such as whole beef tenderloins and pork loins (depending on the budget) and it works equally well. Just remember to adjust cooking times accordingly.

I really liked the Asian flavors. I strained the marinade before adding the cornstarch and boiling it. I served it with the vegetables and made a rice pilaf. I cooked the steak about 4.5 minutes per side on the grill.

The flank steak is always a huge hit at dinner parties. I add chopped fresh rosemary to the marinade and let the meat sit in the refrigerator overnite (turn the meat over in the morning). I've never made the vegatables however.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe three or four times and each time received enthusiastic compliments with multiple requests for the recipe. One suggestion: the recipe directs you to prepare the vegetables first, then cook the steak. However the cooking time for both is essentially the same. I'd suggest just making both at the same time so your veggies aren't cold when it comes time to plate.

Not saying this isn;t a really tasty dish but something was missing. Not sure what it was.. Think the veggies lack flavor. My favorite part of the dish was the sauce. Think we would try making this again but not sure

Rating: 4
This is one of the best recipes I've made in a long time. Not only is the flavor amazing, it was super easy to prepare and cook! I grilled the steak instead of pan-frying it, and added some of the reserved marinade to the vegetables while they were sauteing to increase the flavor. I can't wait to make this again!

Absolutely delicious. I marinaded a tri-tip overnight and barbequed it. I'll never fix a tri-tip any other way from this point on.

Wonderful, even tho' I used a cheap chuck steak and scotch for sake. Strained the marinade and used the garlic/ginger in veg. stir fry. Served over angel hair tossed w/some of the boiled marinade, hoisin sauce, seseame oil, red pepper flakes, mint and worcestershire - a rough take on the "Vietnamese style grilled steak w/noodles" here. Looked and tasted fabulous.

Got rave reviews when I made this dish for my guests. Presentation is beautiful with the veggies - laying the steak on top makes it look so gourmet. I substituted the flank with top sirloin as I haven't had much luck with flank (usually turns out dry). I served this with the Sea Treasure Miso Soup with side of rice and light dash of plum sprinkles on top of rice. Beautiful!

EXCELLENT!!!!! This is a wonderful dish and a definite winner - it goes well with Twice Baked Potatoes with Cream Cheese and Mushrooms issued the same month as this recipe - thank you SO MUCH Bon Appetit for making it available to me - I have received rave reviews for this dish, but it would be wrong to take all the credit when I have you to thank.

I have to admit I was sceptical. I do a lot of Chinese cooking and this preparation is not traditional. But am I a believer now!!! This is definitely a recipe I'll use again and again. It would be great for company, easy but delicious and visualy appealing. Just one small thought. If the asparagus is good (and I was fortunate to be using some of the best I've had this spring) boiling for 4 minutes and then cooking for the additional time with the other vegetables sounds like overkill to me. I blanched mine for only 3 minutes and stir fried it just long enough to warm it back up and that was plenty.

Awesome!

Without a doubt, this was the best flank steak I've had. I've made it twice--once for my family and once for a special dinner with my BF--and both times everything was gone in an instant. People stopped talking at my family dinner (and it's hard to get my family to stop talking) because they were eating up the food so quickly. I added extra ginger, since it's the foundation fo the flavor, used shitake instead of crimini muchrooms, and replaced peanut oil with olive oil. The end result was breathtaking, and I don't say that lightly.

I'm really only rating the steak, since in an effort to save time, I grilled the veggies in foil packets instead of stir-frying. Next time I'll know better. Guests raved about all of it, though - and it was _so_ easy. This goes onto our list for impromptu dinner parties.

The flank steak came out very tender, however, the predominant taste was the saltiness of the soy sauce. I will use reduced-sodium soy sauce next time, and up the ginger, as I had a hard time tasting it.

Very simple, make ahead, the sauce is particularly good. (For some reason, I didn't like the leftovers, reheated... not the same at all). Have made twice so far, on grill and inside. No problems with cooking on stove--use peanut oil to avoid smoking up your kitchen.

This was terrific! I made this dish for the most picky eaters and everyone loved it! I had to do two separate steaks, as 1/2 of our household refuses to eat anything but well-done meat, and this was a hit!

Great taste overall, however,with no overhead fan on my stove, the whole kitchen got VERY smokey while cooking the steak!! Next time, will do as a stir-fry (partially freeze meat, thinly slice, marinate, drain & stir-fry in wok) - boil marinade, and use as needed to taste. Veggies were really good - none left - even 2 teenagers ate them up! (used green beans instead of asparagus)

Rating: 4
First try was great - second even better! I mixed the cornstarch with 4tbs. water before adding- sauce was not gummy this time. I also took a hint from Steven Raichlin's grill book and made criss-cross cuts on both surfaces of the meat to help the marinade get into the steak. Made extra, and tonight, with tortillas, salsa, guacamole and sour cream, the kids will have fahitas!

with all the fuss i expected more. it was good but not all that. and maybe i need a new butcher... at my little gourmet grocery, flank steak was a lot more $$ than sirloin - i had assumed it was a cheaper cut if meant to be marinated. i bought the sirloin instead and didn't find marinating overnight did much for the texture of the cut. obviously i need to learn my beef cuts a bit better.

Re: ginger: take a large root, cut up into large pieces and wash off all dirt, chop very finely in food processor. Put in screw top glass jar and pour in enough very dry sherry to cover. Stored in fridge it will last/keep its flavor a long time, makes using ginger really easy

This was delicious! To easily grate ginger, freeze the piece of ginger root. Peel it (while it's frozen) and grate away! Refreeze the remaining. Or. peel and place pieces of ginger in your garlic press...not as much fiber, but the taste comes through.

I retract my earlier comment about "overmarinating." I had this prepared for dinner, then something came up and I had to leave it marinating for almost 3 WHOLE DAYS. Rather than waste a nice piece of meat, I grilled it up...delicious. Apparently, this recipe is completely foolproof.

My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. It was very flavorful and colorful, too. The only thing I did differently was strain the reduction sauce so I didn't have crushed garlic and stringy ginger floating around. By the way, does anyone have any helpful hints about grating and/or mincing ginger that won't result in the stringy disaster I usually encounter? And one other question, does it matter what kind of Sake you use? I liked the results with my "Pear" flavored kind, but was wondering if it could have been even more fabulous with another kind.

My fiance and I had another couple over. This was a fairly easy meal to prepare for a dinner party. The taste was wonderful.

Definitely as good as everyone says. My modifications: let the steak soak for two full days, threw in a healthy dose of both red pepper flakes and chopped fresh cilantro into the marinade, and used toasted sesame oil to stir fry veggies rather than plain peanut oil. The nuttiness complimented the Asian theme well. Oh, definitely grill the steak-- much more tasty, in my opinion. Three minutes per side plus five minutes to rest worked for us. I was hesitant to make this cut of meat for fear it would be tough, but I was wrong. It was unbelievably tender, with great flavor. Served with fresh sticky white rice.

I made this recipe for a pot luck dinner. I doubled the recipe. It was absolutely delicious. I should have made more!!! The crowd loved the dish. I marinated the meat for a day.

This was very, very good. I too have a flank steak recipe I've used forever. It's similar (ground ginger,honey,soy,garlic,vinegar..) but this one is wonderful.

I made this recipe for a dinner party of 8 (doubled the amounts) and they went crazy! They said it was the best flank steak and veggies they had ever eaten. Wow! Not one bit was left. And the most impressive thing was, my presentation looked just like the picture, something that usually doesn't happen in real life, in my opinion. A few changes I made-used a pound of green beans along with the asparagus for the doubled recipe, but left the mushroom amount the same (2 and 1/2 lbs. would have been way too much). I used 2 red bell peppers, but thought that two for just one flank steak would have overpowered it. I also strained the marinade before cooking and thickening it with the cornstarch so it would be clear and smooth. Everyone asked for the recipe, it will be a requested menu here again and again.

I thought this was good but like my marinade for flank steak better (marinate 1 1/2-1 3/4 lb. flank steak overnight or for at least 4 to 6 hours ahead in a combination of: 1/4 to 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 2 Tbsp. vinegar, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce, 1 bay leaf, 1/8 tsp. each pepper, ground cloves and thyme, and a dash of cayenne. This is superb!). I didn't use bell peppers in the veggie combo but used snow peas instead. Made with rice and it was a very good dinner - one I would make again, but still think my marinade is the best!

This was delicious. I did not have any sake and did not want to buy any for just a 1/2 cup so I used a cabernet instead. Yum, yum. I'm also on a low carbohydrate diet and did not add the brown sugar or corn starch and the sauce was still delicious. Great presentation. Will add toasted sesame seeds next time as a garnish.

My husband and I loved this dish! He said it was the best oriental-flavored dish I've made.The sake gives this dish a wonderfully unique taste. My only suggestions are to grill the steak (be careful not to burn, because of the sugar) and cut the peppers a little smaller.

My husband says this is the best thing I have ever made, and he seldom likes any cooking but his own. I liked it, but prefer the brisket with dried cranberries and portobellow mushrooms (and also the spice rubbed lamb) but he thinks this is even better--and he LOVED the spice rubbed lamb! I expected it to be better than anything else given the consistency of four fork reviews, but the brisket (made last week) was more to my liking. Don't get me wrong--I'm comparing the best of the best and picking a favorite--this is still a delectable meal and the asparagus is a really tasty combination with the peppers and London Broil.

Amazingly simple to make. I grilled the steak on an indoor gril and it was amazingly tender and succulent. I added a little miso paste to the marinade. Not sure what difference it made as I had nothing to compare it to. Served veggies with a side of Wasabi Mashed potatoes. A great, easy week night meal.

This deserves the 4 forks. And thanks to all the people who reviewed this. I didn't clip it from the magazine, but after reading the reviews I decided to try it. Marinated meat for almost 12 hours and followed the recipe. Used a cast iron skillet to cook the meat and it worked really great. This is absolutely delicious and easy also. Whoever developed the marinade/sauce was inspired. Served it with a simple fried rice with egg, bean sprouts, peas and oyster sauce. Great combo.

This was fantastic... my family fought over the last pieces and we had to divy it up between us! I did not have Sake or know where to find it, so I used Dry Red Cooking Wine in its place. Marinating over night turned this what can often be tough steak into fillet mignon! My family, unlike me, hates asparagus, so I did not use that. I sauteed the other veggies listed and added some white frozen corn; about one cup. I cooked my steak on the grill directly; saved the marinade and followed the directions for making the left-over marinade. I added half to the cooked vegetables and poored the remainder sauce over the steak. A little deviation, but very very good...best Sunday dinner I have made in a long time. Will make again FOR SURE. Blessings to you all! Enjoy and don't be afraid to experiment and play with food this way!

We agree with the "Fan-Freaking-Tastic"! Marinated the steak for about 4 hours, will try overnight next time, meat was FABULOUS and tender too. Used the bbq, for even more flavour. Didn't have time to source the special mushrooms, but was excellent with regular ones. The colour of the vegetables made a super presentation. Also cut the asparagus into one inch sections. Served it with plain rice, and drowned that with sauce too! And some bread to wipe the plate. Yummy!

I will be making this entree for my daughter and her family: it's their favorite kind of a meal and I can tell it will be very good. I want to share a fresh-ginger keeping hint with others who may not have discovered it. To keep fresh ginger fresh: cut cleaned ginger into 1- or 2-in. pieces (no need to peel), place in a glass jar with a tight cover, and cover the pieces completely with dry sherry. The ginger will keep for a couple of months in the refrigerator and the ginger-flavored sherry is terrific in sauces.

I did everything but the mushrooms and peppers, and it was fantastic. My very picky boyfriend even raved about it. Two thumbs up!! I grilled it on the barbeque to cut down on the fat, I think it was even better that way.

I havent yet tried this one but will within a couple of days. May I just suggest for your next Chinese recipes which include in the ingredients "soya sauce" that you specify whether it should be 'dark' or 'light' at least. They are VERY different and there are many grades of sweetnes in the 'dark' sauce, and levels of salt in the 'light.'

Tasty and fabulous work night meal! That is if I remember to marinate the meat the night before or in the AM. :) Being a new mom who works full time it is great to have easy, healthy and tasty meals at the end of the day. It's the only time my husband and I have a chance to catch up. When the food is great it just that much better. I'd reccomed this to any one.

Only scrumptious!!! I used white mushrooms, green onions and cut the asparagus into 1 to 1-1/2 inch slices after cooking and omitted the bell peppers (personal preference). I cooked the flank stead medium rare. A yummy meal ... lick your plate clean and forget etiquette!

Fan-Freaking-Tastic! Everything, the meat, the veggies, that wonderful sauce! I am on a low carb diet so instead of adding the cornstarch, I just reduced it to a thick sauce and my husband asked if I minded if he licked the plate and I told him no because I was going to too. I think it is easier if you cut the asparagus, but I left it whole because it made a much better presentation.

My family and guests really liked the flavor of the meat. The sake glazed vegetables weren't my favorite. Marinating overnight makes the meat much more flavorful.

This is my husband's new favorite. Its very flavorful! I used minced ginger from a jar to save time and white mushrooms to save a lttle money. Next time, I will marinade it overnight instead of just the 2 hours I had.
