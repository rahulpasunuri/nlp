I thought the mashed sardines in the dressing made this much too fishy. There was no need for that. I would just add the extra sardines to the main salad next time. Otherwise, it was a refreshing change from the usual.

Ok, now that we've all weighed in on the arugula situation -- let's get back to the food! I adore the lowly canned sardine, and am always looking for a fresh way of serving them (even if it's just for me) and this is just the ticket. I think it's bright and lovely for a mid-week summer meal. I also added crumbled goat feta, which I think added a nice complexity (and color). Try it!

Pretty bland...and I even put in more sardines than called for. It tasted like tabouleh without the bulgur wheat.

Another note to Kansas. At the top of each recipe there is a row of icons. Run your cursor over LEARN and then click on Food Dictionary.You can type in your questionable item or scroll to find the item.

Note to Kansas: arugula is sometimes called rocket were you live. It does look like dandelion leaves but much more tender, like baby spinach. The older the leaf the more bitter it becomes. Can be prone to aphids if you want to plant it yourself so prepare to buy canisters of lady bugs to eat the pests.

Hello Kansas. In Germany we call Arugula "Rucola". It looks similar to the leaves of dandelion. The taste is a little bit hot. You will love it or you will hate it ;-)
