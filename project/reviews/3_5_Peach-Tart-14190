This is an exceptional recipe that tastes like it came from a bakery. The pastry has a delicate crumb that is really the sign of someone who knows what they're doing! That said, this recipe tired me out. I don't know why--it seems relatively straightforward. I prepared it along with some other recipes for a picnic, and maybe it was just too much at once. I did feel, though, that I'll reserve it only for special occasions. I loved the almond filling and don't understand why others didn't taste it.

This crust turned out terrible and I agree with the reviewer below that you could not taste the almond filling. I also thought that the recipe could use some clarification -- what are the tarts baked on? I'm assuming they are free form and flat on the cookie sheet. Will not be using this recipe again.

It was great, but I made a few changes: I made it as a single 9" tart because I wanted to use my new pan, and I used my own pastry recipe (from the Betty Crocker cookbook, its really easy and rich). There was more than enough filling, and it was very rich and almondy. I cooked it for 35min, and I didn't dot with butter because of all the butter already in the crust and filling. Great!

Sorry to disagree with everyone else who gave a good review. I made a 8" tart and three 3" tarts instead. Coudlnt' really tase the almond paste and the peach didn't look pretty after being baked and refrigerated till next day....

A dish beyond compare. The guests at my luncheon were all wowed by this relatively simple masterpeice. Making this tart was time well spent.

I made these for a dinner party last weekend and they were a huge hit! I did use my own pastry recipe, however, which is very flaky and better than any I've tried in the past. I fanned out the peach slices and added fresh, plump blackberries. I reduced a can of peach nectar down to a glaze (about 1/4 cup) and glazed the tarts when they came out of the oven. I served these warm with a sprinkle of powdered sugar, scattered berries and a scoop of Dulce de Leche ice cream. I think this will work well with rasberries & blueberries too. This recipe is a keeper!

I have not made this recipe. However, I did have it at Laurel. It was so delicious. As is every dish I have ever had there. My favorite restaraunt of all time. You simply must go next time you visit our lovely city.

I made a batch of these and gave some to my neighbor, who absolutely raved about them. They taste excellent. (With all that butter and sugar, why wouldn't they?!) I can't see making them very often, though. Very labor intensive and time consuming.

As others before me have said, this dish is a bit time consuming, but worth it. Once baked, the pastry held up wonderfully underneath the warm and luscious almond paste and peaches. The only mistake or oddity that I encountered was the recipe itself. Under the pastry ingredients it indicates that you should use "8 ounces (2 cups)" of flour. Based on the small amount of cooking that I have done, 8 oz. is the equivalence of 1 cup. I opted for the 8 oz. measurement and everything came out great.

This is an Absolutely wonderful dish. The pastry is tasty and the almond filling and peaches offer great tastes. A little time consuming, but worth it!

I made this as one large 12 inch tart using a combo of nectarines and bananas which was delicious. I doubled the almond filling which was generous, 1 1/2 times the recipe might be better as this was practically swimming in butter. Tasted wonderful though...
