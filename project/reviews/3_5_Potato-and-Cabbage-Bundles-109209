This is time consuming, but so worth the effort. I make this every St. Patrick's Day with a green salad and the Chocolate Guinness Goodness pudding - it's my husband's favorite meal.

This is really yummy. We cooked it non-dairy; it's a little long to prepare, but I 'm sure it will be much faster when I make it again (soon :-)).

Meh. Makes for a nice presentation, but not worth the extra effort IMO. You could just make the potatoes separately and chop the cabbage and saute and it would be equally as good. Also, though the recipe didn't specify the size of the muffin cups, I used my "Texas size" muffin cups and those worked well. I doubt you could use a regular size muffin cup. It would be too hard to fit the cabbage leaf in, and there'd hardly be any room for filling. I think muffin cups are like clothing in that there's been some size inflation (deflation?) over the years. This recipe takes the larger size ones.

Yeah its good, and looks cool, but WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH WORK!

Great tastes, however I would totally recommend doing the prep work a day prior. I made them in an extra large muffin tin which may have made them a little larger than the author considered. They are EXTREMELY rich and filling. I had issues with the parchment paper as a removal device as one of mine was a little imbalanced and ended up hitting the deck.

I made this for the annual family St. Patrick's day gathering, and it was a big hit. Since we had such a large crowd, I doubled the recipe and made it into a large casserole in a single dish. Everyone raved about it and said they preferred it to the standard boiled cabbage and potatoes. It's already on the menu for next year.

Preparation seemed intimidating, but the dish was actually pretty easy to make. Our dinner guests weren't that excitied about having cabbage, but this recipe changed their minds. The horseradish and extra sharp cheddar made the dish special. The "cabbage cups" made for a great presentation on the dinner plate.

Made last year for St. Patrick's Day...Making them again this year! Excellent!

After reading all the rave reviews and believing it'd be a great party appetizer, I found this recipe to be too time consuming for the end result. They just weren't that tasty. Perhaps it's because I don't particularly like horseradish, but I only used 1/4 of the recommended amount. I would also recommend using small muffin portions b/c the large ones were just overwhelming.

My husband made these for St. Patrick's Day & they were great. Will make them again. Like the cassarole dish idea - for a crowd

I have made these for St. Paddy's day for the last few years and everyone loves them. The presentation is fun and they taste great. I have also made them for everyday meals with out putting them in a bundle and it is a nice side dish.

Great presentation! A little more cheddar and this is good to go. just the right with corned beef.

This is by far my family's favorite way to have cabbage and potatoes. All four of my kids love it! If you want to save time, you don't have to individualize them into the bundles for a less formal presentation. I serve them baked in a 9x9 baking dish. AWESOME!

I made these as part of our St Paddy's feast. A fair amount of work, but I really enjoyed the idea of mixing up the plain boiled cabbage and mashed potatoes. Made according to recipe. Cooked them in ramikins. Had lots of left over mashed which i covered in the left over bread crumbs and rebaked along with the bundles. Crowd enjoyed them as well. One word of warning. while making everything tasted almost too salty, yet when paired with the corned beef, they seemed rather bland. I think it would be fun to make these and play around with different veggies.

I made this recipe for St. Patty's Day and it was a big hit, the only thing I would change is you do not need to add 3 cups of chopped cabbage, I only added about 1 1/2 cups. I made it several hours ahead and it was great!

Had this yesterday for St. Paddy's with our corned beef. First of all - it's a lot of work and time consuming. Not difficult at all but takes time and uses lots of pans. Thankfully I did it first thing in the AM and reheated for dinner. That said - these are delicious. A great way to have cabbage and barely taste it! The mashed potatoes would be good on their own too.

I made these for a dinner party last night, and they were a big hit. Left out the horseradish (because I hate it). Made ahead of time and reheated. Though not hard, it was time- consuming. Would leave myself a lot more time to do these the next time.

Good choice of side dish for St Patrick supper. Mostly for presentation.

This was so good and really not difficult to make, I used individual ramikins and although I didn't have horseradish available I added sundried tomatoes and a few extra herbs. My guys were impressed with the presentation. DB

I didn't think this was that much work! You blanch cabbage to soften leaves. Make mashed potatoes with a tasty twist and assemble with cabbage seasonings! Yum.

I gave this 3 stars for the inspiration. After making it as a tryout for St. Patrick's Day, I went a different route.Using as many as 15 leaves (cooked as the directions said), I stuffed and rolled them spring-roll style, toothpick to hold together, laid out in a 9x13" greased baking pan, brushed w/ butter and baked for 20 minutes (more if you like deeper browning). Serving them in this way enables your guests to cut silver- dollar size mouthfuls and reducing plate space and waste.

They are sometimes called "Texas Size" muffin pans and available at amazon.com

Actually, it's very easy to find larger muffin tins. I prefer the silicone - which you can locate with a simple search for 'jumbo' or 'large' muffin pans. And I really like this cabbage recipe - cruciferous veggies are so good for you and new recipes (that actually taste good) are most welcome.

1-cup muffin pans? Even my most food-savvy friends and relatives had never heard of such a thing, and an on-line trip to several kitchen specialty websites turned up nothing. Still, it worked just fine with standard 1/2-cup pans. The cheese and the horseradish make this a winner.

Ok. It was good. My husband thinks it was very good. the truth is, I made it, it was nice, kinda cute, actually, it tasted decent, but way too much work for the reward. I am like everyone else in this site, someone who loves to cook, but having little kids makes me rethink my recipes. I made the whol kit'ncabbodle for st. patricks day, the beef stew was delicious and relatively easy to make, the whiskey chocolate tart was out of this world and something i will gladly make again, this.... ehhhhh... been there done that....

I made these the day ahead of our annual St. Patty's corned beef dinner. What a wonderful presentation and flavor. Even those who regularly avoid the cabbage portion of the meal loved this version. A true keeper.

Love the reviews that say cabbage is too inexpensive to fuss with or that a recipe for a vegetable side dish contains too many vegetables. Too funny! This recipe was delicious. The combination of flavors made an excellent side dish.

Seems like a lot of work to dress up 50 cents worth of cabbage

yes! i made everyone like cabbage! each individual part of the bundle is awesome, so together its super good. i used a smaller cup-size muffin pan and it was fine, just made more bundles. such a good alternative to boiled cabbage for st pattys day.

I liked this dish a lot. It was reasonably straightforward to assemble. I only used one pot and two bowls in all. Ok, one more pan for the breadcrumbs. I used one-cup ceramic ramekins. I found that one strip of parchment paper was more than sufficient for easy removal. The packages make a lovely presentation on the plate. They were excellent complements to the rest of the Irish menu in the March issue of Gourmet.

We very much enjoyed this dish! Served with a nice center cut pork chop and apple salad, yummy! Alot of work, but worth it.

Has anyone actually made this recipe? You Vegetably Puts's?

I think the reviewer meant "putzy" rather than "putsy" To putz around means you have to go through a lot of little steps which may be more trouble than they are worth.

To the cook that says this dish seems vegatabley - uh - it is. What else would it be???? Although I have not tried it, it sounds like a terrific change up of a more traditioanl Irish Potato dish, Colcannon. We had an Irish dinner party last Saturday night and this would have been a terrific addition!
