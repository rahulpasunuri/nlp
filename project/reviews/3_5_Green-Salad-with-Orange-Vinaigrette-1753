This is really just a half- review. I used the dressing recipe over those bags of mixed spring greens. Added some mandarin orange sections, minced sweet onion and toasted almonds. They ate it up.

Delicious, refreshing, colorful and different! I served it with a cajun pork tenderloin - Perfect! I sometimes use canned mandarin orange sections, for ease of preparation. You can vary the greens, according to your liking - I often use half the spinach and throw in some of those pretty "varietal assorted greens" you can buy by the handful at the market. Lovely salad! A BIG hit!

Wow...what a wonderful salad! Made it for a party and it was a huge hit. Very light and refreshing. I am not a huge fan of spinach but absolutely love it this way. A definite keeper!

I served this to a party of 60 last week, as part of a Cuban-style menu. Left out the avocado because the rest of the menu was rich, added julienned jicama to the mix for added crunch. Received raves and many requests for the recipe. Simple and easy, especially if you have help segmenting the oranges!

I just used the dressing and paired it with fresh steamed asparagus. Way too much olive oil for the asparagus. I added some fresh sqeezed OJ to the dressing and topped the dish with orange segments and toasted pecans. It was good once I skimmed off some of the oil.
