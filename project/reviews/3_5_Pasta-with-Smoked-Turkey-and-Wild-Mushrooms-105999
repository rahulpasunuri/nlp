I'm not a fan of cream in savory dishes, so I omitted the cream and used a whole bottle of Chardonnay instead, adding it a cup at a time and cooking it down and then simmering as one would the cream. Chardonnay really compliments the smoke flavor of the turkey, and I think the wine sauce works well with the mushrooms and and red pepper.

Ok, day after Thanksgiving and tried this recipe. Wonderful! We have a Greenberg Smoked Turkey almost every year and used the leftovers for this dish. Left out the red peppers thanks to other posts here, added some fresh ground pepper about half way through. Liberal on the shallots, substituted soba buckwheat noodles for the penne and everything else as per recipe. Served with steamed spinach side. Awesome, rave reviews, enough for three hungry people.

I made this last night and pretty much followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was rather bland. I agree that it has too many calories and lots of chopping for a rather ordinary outcome. The red bell pepper is not a good addition. I think it was put in there just for color. I'd use either pimientos or dried tomatoes next time and add some herbs. Thyme would be nice. The best thing about this recipe is that the smokey flavor is balanced off by the sauce and the mushrooms. So if you're tired of smoked turkey flavor, this is a good way to use it up.

I added a little lemon juice and some chicken base. Nailed it! It was amazing.

A creative way to use up some leftover turkey from Thanksgiving! I used fewer mushrooms and added some peas instead for additional color.

Mu husband and I smoke our own turkey breast; this is one of our favorite recipes when we want something other than traditional BBQ. If you're trying to cut down on fat and calories, fat free 1/2 & 1/2 works ok as a substitute (but not as good as the real thing!)

This was okay but not great. The flavors of the bell pepper, mushrooms and turkey did not meld together very well.

There was a really nice contrast between the saltiness of the smoked turkey and the sweetness of the cream sauce. Quick,easy & tasty Pretty funny cause I used to live in Jamesburg!

Very good and simple, but too many calories for a regular dish. I cut the recipe in half, used a smoked turkey leg and dried shitake (fresh are a little pricey here) soaked in hot water for 20 minutes (added the soaking liquid to the wine), plus 1/3 tsp crushed red pepper. Sauted shitake with the shallots. Excellent flavour.

Perhaps it was the modification s I made, but for the chopping effort and the calories this was hardly worth it. I used dried portabellos, but added the reconstitution juices when cooking. I also added criminis with the shitakis. My husband I both found we wanted to add some flavour. He sprinkled his liberally with Hungarian Paprika and Salt to achieve a passable meal, I think garlic and sundried tomatoes might save the sauce!

My wife generally likes my cooking, but this, she absolutely raved about, and I agree with her assessment. While I followed the recipe as closely as possible, I suspect using my own brine-smoked turkey may have helped. This will become a staple for when we have only a few good friends for dinner. I made a mistake in opening a bottle of a favorite sauvignon blanc. Wrong wine! I bought out a bottle of chianti and that rang the bell.

First of all-- to the shouter in Ohio-- chill out, please. Living in the desert, I see nothing wrong with not having experienced fresh picked morels...where we would we find them? However, I thought this recipe was pretty good-- I smoked my own chicken in the water smoker and used a good variety of mushrooms. I left out the red pepper, because it didn't seem to go with the rest of the recipe. It was plenty mushroomy for me and my family. Decent weekday recipe

This dish was just ok at first, but was amazing when reheated the next day. The mushroom flavor is intense, so if you don't like mushrooms, you won't like this. It's easy, fast, and great for a mid-week dinner. Chicken broth can be substituted for the wine.

HAVE NONE OF YOU PEOPLE EVERY HAD FRESH WOODS-PICKED MORELS BEFORE?? This recipe, although fair, had NONE of the wonderful flavor of the forest. I could have used canned buttons instead of 8 hr. old morels and had the same experience. I think the wine killed the shrooms.

I served this for a dinner party of 16. Everyone had seconds! I substituted morels for the portobellos and added 1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper. Delicious!

This dish was quite delicious and easy to prepare. It also looks wonderful on the plate. Next time I will use some yellow pepper to give this dish even more color. The portobello and shitake mushrooms are key to this dish. I also used some crimini.
