I've made this a couple of times now. The first time I added some chocolate sauce so it's like a ribbon through the ice cream. The second time I added some nutmeg. Both versions are yummy and oh so easy.

Everyone seems to have their own slight adjustment to this simple recipe, so here's mine: 6 very ripe Bananas 1 14-oz. can Sweetened Condensed Milk 1 cup heavy cream I used the blender or stick blender and then the ice cream maker, but you can do it any way you like. It comes out very banana and not overly sweet. Great way to use bananas which are a bit too ripe which is how I found this recipe.

Is this a joke? A waste of money for sure

This recipe gets extra points for being easy and a new way to use old bananas. I added a cup of buttermilk to cut the sweetness.

Great ice cream! My family loves it.

This recipe just didn't do it for me. The condensed milk made it sickenly sweet. I added an additional cup of milk and it was still too sweet. The texture was strange and the flavor uninteresting. Won't make it again.

A remarkably easy recipe made even easier with an ice-cream maker! I blended all ingredients in a blender ( I had some really, really ripe bananas), poured into the ice-cream maker and simply turned it on. The plain banana ice-cream was a bit cloying...but after stirring in 1/2 a bottle of hot-fudge topping, and freezing overnight, it was DELICIOUS. The kids and I can't keep our spoons out of the container.

I added an extra banana and pulsed all the ingredients in the food processor, poured it into my ice cream maker and added chocolate chunks while it was churning. Nice level of sweetness and mellow banana flavor.

I used four bananas, one small can of sweetened condensed milk and one cup of whipping cream. Then pureed the bananas in the processor, slowly drizzled in the milk, covered and chilled while I whipped the cream until stiff. Then I blended the cream into the bananas in three batches. Then I poured it into a medium sized bowl in quaters. After each fourth, I used a butter knife dipped in chocolate sauce and swirled it through. Wasn't too sweet. Very very rich.

I have made this many times- now have it perfected.Squeeze whole lime over banana then freeze. Instead of just adding whipping cream, I WHIPPED the cream 'til stiff then folded it into the banana mixture, the texture was a true icecream and it froze faster. Serve it with a lime wedge to squeeze over the ice cream- cuts sweetness.

Nice alternative to banana bread to use really ripe bananas. I was afraid my bananas were "too ripe" as they were completely black and extrememly soft but they worked. I used a little less sweetened condensed milk as others noted ice cream was too sweet, so I added more half & half (substituted for the cream) to make up the difference. I had let the mixture sit for almost 6 hours before whipping it (I forgot!) but it didn't harden, just firm, so that fine. In the end, the texture was smooth and velvety (it didn't harden too much) and the flavor, though very strong, was nice.

Quite good. I also added fresh lemon juice (1 tablespoon) and increased the cream to 1 cup so as to reduce the sweetness. Throwing everything into the blender for a couple of minutes and then into an ice cream maker made short work of it. I sandwiched scoops between peanut butter cookies and then dipped the sandwiches in melted chocolate. Mmmmm...

This tastes really good, but it is a tad sweet. I wonder how you could adjust the recipe to counteract that, since you only use sweetened condensed milk. Maybe a little more cream?

Yum! This tastes similar to Bluebell Banana Pudding Ice Cream from Texas. Next time, I will add some crushed vanilla wafers. Easy and delicious

This was an easy and good receipe. I used my Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker and had ice cream in 20 minutes. Would make a great ice cream pie.

For an ice cream without an ice cream maker... this is very good. Great texture, easy to make, but a bit sweet for me. Others loved it though.

Now I know what to do when I have too many ripe bananas! This is a much tastier option than the banana bread I usually make and better yet, it is even easier. I cut back on the fat by using low-fat sweetened condensed milk and half-and-half instead of cream. It was rich and creamy and truly delicious! Did I mention easy? Very, very easy and very good!

It worked! I'm a total novice in the kitchen, but this recipe was easy. I'm really impressed!

As a banana fanatic...this ice cream was wonderful! However, I found the flavor is best when very ripe (stage 6-7) bananas are used.
