this is to die for. i also used ghirardelli semi-sweet chips -- makes this recipe so easy. the coconut gives it a nice, subtle, interesting flavor, not the same old chocolate fondue. even those who didn't like coconut loved this recipe!!

Even my kids who dont like coconut ate this up. I found it a bit too thin to stick to the dippers, next time I might omit the whipping cream.

Wonderful fondue!! I used high quality dark chocolate and this was a hit at our wine tasting party!! When making it, I thought that I was adding too much cream of coconut, but the flavor, smooth texture and color was perfect. I quickly learned that cream of coconut is kept with the mixers near the liquor section. I'm going to make it again for another holiday party!!

Great and easy fondue! Perfect for special occasions or anyday. Don't be afraid of the coconut since it's very subtle. I omitted the coconut extract and only used the coconut cream and it worked perfectly. I also used high quality bittersweet chocolate chips instead of chopped chocolate and it worked great.

This was very yummy. I was out of whipping cream, so I used vanilla ice cream. This made quite a bit so we reserved the rest and use it later for ice cream topping.

Served this wonderful fondue for New Year's Eve party - Used fresh berries and fruit, also used almond biscotti to dip in Gadiva Dark Chocolate 72% Caco. Was a HUGE hit - Fresh and yummy!

This was so amazing! I made it for Valentine's Day for my husband and I, and it was great. The coconut flavor is subtle and mixes so well with the bittersweet chocolate. My favorite dippers were pound cake, strawberries, and bananas. I served them with coconut flakes to dip in after the chocolate. Wonderful end for a romantic night!

I make this for every Valentine's day and it is AWESOME! Use dark chocolate. Also, we have found one of our favorite things to dunk in it are meringue kisses, in addition to all of the fruit, etc.

We look forward to this fondue every Christmas Eve. My daughter is on a special diet, so I make it dairy free by omitting the cream and using a dairy free chocolate. I also sub vanilla extract for the coconut and I add a pinch of salt. Absolutely sinful!

I made this fondue for a work party and everyone loved it. It was the favorite dish at the party. Quick and easy to make as well (once I figured out that I could buy the coconut cream in the liquor isle as it's used for pina coladas) We're still eating it today at office - dipping Lorna Doones into it cold...yum!

Company loved this recipe!! I would most definetly prepare this in advance and reheat. It reheats beautifully!! Prepare your fruit (everyone really liked the pineapple) and fondue in the morning so that you have time to enjoy your guests!!!

Absolute Heaven - just like a melted Mounds Bar! Great with everything we dipped in it, but incredible with frozen cheesecake bites! Can't wait to make it again...

Made this for a group of 20. It was very successful and quite a crowd pleaser. Even on their way out the door people were stopping at the fondue pot for a few more dunks. I used Green and Black's 70% organic dark chocolate and it was amazing! I did need more whipping cream to keep it flowing...up to 3/4 cup. We dipped everything from fruit to nuts to pretzels.

We had a fondue party for New Years and my husband and I were in charge of the chocolate. We dipped pound cake, strawberries, bananas, pineapple, honeydew, and apples. It was a huge hit! Extremely yummy, and dangerous for chocolate lovers!

Excellent with shredded Trader Joes dark 70% 'Pound plus' chocolate, dark coconut rum and double the cream to 1/2 cup to keep it fluid while heating. Dip everything in it, especially apricots and angel food cake.

I trippled this recipe to serve a party of about 15 adults and 13 kids. It was delicious, and worked well with the chocolate fondue machine I put it in! Couldn't really taste the coconut too much though, but that was a good thing for me considering my dad and brother don't like coconut, but even so, they loved the fondue!

A bit too sweet for my taste. I'd make it with unsweetened or very dark chocolate next time.

I've been promising my kids fondue for a while now. I'm so glad I found this recipe! Delicious. Easy. Not too thick, covers nicely. This made a lot, and it hardens up in the fridge...unfortunately ;) even THAT tastes really good. I spread some of the hardened chocolate on sourdough bread. Oh. My. God. Wayy too good. We used pretzels, marshmallows, bananas, strawberries, pound cake, bread, graham crackers and tortilla chips (oddly delicious) with the fondue. So much left over, we'll definitely be doing it again!

omit coconut extract and add coconut rum...yummy

Rating: 4
This was very easy and very very good. The secret is in the quality chocolate you use. I omitted the coconut extract because I had no experience with it and didn't want to jeopardize the great taste. We enjoyed bananas, pound cake, strawberries and apple. Delicious. You have not failed me again!

I made this for a dinner party where two of the guests were lactose intolerant, so I left out the cream and it was fabulous! Everyone really enjoyed it.

We had some problems w/this recipe. I think a way to make it foolproof is to actually heat the chocolate in a double-boiler.

Absolutely delightful! Coconut is not too strong, just a nice, rich addition. We use Dark Toblerone chocolate. Made two days ahead for easy entertaining and froze leftovers. An absolute winner....will always make sure we have ingredients on hand.

This chocolate fondue is delicious and so easy to make. I've made it twice, following the recipe as written. It was a hit both times.

Easy! I doubled the recipe for 20 people although I didn't really have to. I used Godiva semi-sweet chocolate chips and I think it was too sweet. Would deffinately use bittersweet next time. Great response anyway!

Wow--I don't know what I did wrong but it was WAY too sweet--I fixed it though by adding more cream and coconut milk and it ended up turning out great...maybe I used the wrong brand of Coconut Cream-I don't know!!!

Oh, yeah!! This recipe is *obscenely* good and *embarrassingly* easy. The key: use really good quality chocolate. I used Lindt bittersweet, doubled the recipe for a crowd but kept the 1 can of coconut. Skipped the extract. The flavor was deep and subtle. Everyone age 6 and up scarfed it down and came back for more. Our fave dippers: dried apricots, frozen cheesecake, fresh strawberries, marshmallows.

I made this recipe for a New Years party and despite all of the other choices, this was the first one finished. All of the guests asked for the recipe and were surprised when I told them how easy it was to make!

Not only a very easy dessert, but the presentation and taste are so impressive that no one could stop raving about it. I didn't have time to get creamed coconut or extract so I took a large block of dessicated coconut and diluted it in boilng water, about 2/3 - 1 ratio. When soft I beat it to make more of a sauce consistency. For the extract I followed other reviewers' advice and added toasted coconut - but since we love coconut I really added lots which was perfect because it added an interesting, flavorful texture to the fondue. Will definitely make again.

We attended a fondue party for New Years and out of many choices at the table, the forks kept dipping into this one. It was FANTASTIC and extremely easy to make.

I made this for a dinner party and people freaked out over how good it was. I omitted the coconut extract and even went light on the Coco Lopez, but found (unlike other cooks who have reviewed this recipe) that a subtle coconut flavor was optimum because, after all you're making it so you and your friends can consume LIQUID CHOCOLATE. I used Trader Joe's semi-sweet chocolate chips and they were great. For dippin: berries are awesome, bananas amazing. Very filling as well.

I made this for a dinner party I had, EVERYONE raved about the fondue, saying how good it is. Even the folks who didn't really care for fondue, they were the ones who ate most of it! :)Also we used fresh sourdough bread as another dipper.

I did not have coconut extract so I followed the suggestion of the previous reviewer and toasted coconut and added that. As a result the coconut flavor was a little bit light but still noticable. Out of 4 desert fondues this was the favorite at our fondue party. I used plain ol' store brand (gasp!) semi-sweet chocolate chips and it was still outstanding! Easy, easy, easy!

I toasted coconut in my oven and used that,and I omitted the coconut extract. It was awesome. I would recommend it to anybody that loves coconut. We used frozen cheesecake too.

This is a delicious fondue, though I agree with others... the coconut flavor is subtle and easily missed! This makes a lot, and leftovers were easily "re-fondue'd" from the fridge.

This was heavenly! The easiest recipe, too! We scoured the kitchen to see what we could dip! Our favorite things to dunk were bananas and french bread. Our kids ate it up!

This was delicious and so easy and quick to make! I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips, and it worked really well. It *does* taste like a melted mounds. My husband really likes coconut a lot, so next time I will probably add a little extra cocnut flavoring. Also, it would have been better if it were a little thicker-maybe adding more cream would help that? Both of these changes would be easy to make as you go though. I would highly recommend this recipe. It was fantastic!

Delicious and super easy! The fondue is creamy and tastes like a melted Mounds bar! Especially good with banana chunks and frozen cubes of cheesecake.

I just made this for a party of 20 people--it was a hit. I increased the cream to 3/4 cup to get the consistency i liked, and in the end both taste and consistency were divine. It was like a pot full of melted Mounds bars.
