My review is of "this" recipe; not someone's version of it; that would be a differnt recipe. I use an oven thermometer and am confident my temp was at 400 degrees. I set the timer for 11 minutes just in case, and the cakes were already over done. About 15 minutes should mean within 2-3 minutes max. I've given this another go using half vanilla extract, half almond and have reduced the cooking time by one third. But that is a different recipe.

I love anything almond. But, I found this recipe a big disappointment. I thought the cakes were just ho-hum. I made three batches, each time hoping to swoon as other reviewers had. For my taste, if you want a real almond treat, make almond macaroons. I made the accompanying licorice pudding, too. It didn't have that pudding mouth feel and, like the cakes, was just another big yawn. Oh, well. To each his own.

I love these little cakes! they are simple to prepare, don't require a great deal of ingredients and they are lovely when finished. Watch them carefully the last 5 mins, my oven may be a tad hot, but mine were perfect after 11 mins. To add to previous comments about the amounts, they are correct, using a small wire-spring scoop helps measure these out perfectly.

I keep on making this recipe over and over again. I love how simple all the ingredients are and how wonderful the mini cupcakes turn out! Bake to impress.

Great! These were soft, moist, and flavorful. The powdered sugar made them sweet, but I would rather they be sweet enough without the powdered sugar. The good thing about this recipe is that it is small enough to experiment with without wasting lots of money and time, but can easily be doubled or more to make large quantities of whatever you find out works best.

YUM - these were fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled it as suggested. Proportions worked fine for me, it made 24 bite-sized muffins. Watch the oven closely, as mine were done in only 10 minutes.

I followed the recipe exactly. Very light and flavorful. Perfect tea cakes or accompaniment with some desserts.

Very nice flavor. I made in 6 regular muffin cups, and they fell, probably because they were too deep. Hard to get out of the pan, too. But really tasty.

Fantastic. Everyone loved these. I wish I had doubled the recipe. I didn't have the licorice pudding but put licorice jellybeans along side. It was a great treat after a large Easter dinner.

Excellent recipe. I used marzipan (hate not following a recipe exactly but I couldn't find almond paste) and it worked out beautifully. Everyone loved the cakes so much that I tripled the recipe next time.

Ok, this recipe writer needs a dane to edit her stuff!! Good thing I was raised in DK. Yes - by all means please do use marzipan. Its marzipan, a little bit of confectioners sugar, and a little bit of egg white that goes together to create this recipe. Yes - you can add a little bit of flour, but we are talking only spoonfulls. The main ingredient in this cake is marzipan. My dad really perfected this recipe, unfortunately I dont have his measurements laying around. Approximately I would say: 1 250 Gram / 9 ounce roll of marcipan 4-5 tablespoons of confectioners sugar 2 -3 egg whites enough flour to not make it too sticky (but dont dry it out) 2 - 5 tablespoons. Mix together, and just make little bite size balls. Can be dusted with confectioners sugar, or a confectioners sugar glaze with water in. Also can add colored maraschino cherries. Bake at very high heat - 400 - 450 degrees for about 5 mins. You do not want to make these cakes large - you will never get them cooked through without burning the outside. The traditional danish sizes are either bite size, or in a long fairly thin roll. The thickness of the roll can be from 1/2 - 1 inch. These cakes are called Kransekage in Danish.

The proportions in this recipe are incorrect. I was only able to fill 9 of the mini-muffin tins with the batter. I suggest doubling the recipe thus you have enough Almond Cakes to share and enjoy. Other than the lack of quantity in the recipe, the actual Almond Cakes tasted wonderful. Soft, moist and light in the mouth. Easy to pop in one bite and sweet enough that you wanted more than one!

Response to previous cook's question: It makes 12 - 1/8 cup cakes - that's only 1 1/2 cups of batter, so it appears that the recipe is correct.

Sorry...I haven't actually prepared this recipe because I think the ingredients must be incorrect. It calls for 3 Tbsp. of flour?...yet it yields 12 cakes? Can someone advise if this is correct?

I'm thinking that it might be fun to try making this recipe in a madeleine pan. Might not make a full 12 cakes and might have to adjust the baking time. I will try and report back.
