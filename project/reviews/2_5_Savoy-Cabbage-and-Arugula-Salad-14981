I used Napa cabbage instead of Savoy, and changed the dressing (rice wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, sesame oil, salt/pepper). I also tossed in some sesame seeds. If I had some scallions I would have added those too, but as is it was a simple tasty salad that went well with tonight's teriyaki chicken (even my 5 year old wanted seconds).

Perhaps we had the wrong cabbage, but the combination was not a good one. There was not enough arugula to counter the roughness of the cabbage, nor was there sufficient dressing, really, to lend any flavor to this "salad."
