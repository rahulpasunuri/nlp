I never made a souffle before, and these came out beautifully! They were delicious. The only changes I made were to use 10 0z souffle cups, and to increase the amount of the simple syrup in the soaking liquid. I believe the video was really helpful and gave me confidence with the recipe.

Worked out perfectly. But I had enough leftover batter for two more souffles. The video tutorial helped explain a few of the finer points of souffle making.
