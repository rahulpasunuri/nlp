Definitely use all of the apples. I used 32 oz of broth and it wasn't too soupy.

This recipe went over really, really well with my housemates (which I was actually a little surprised to hear after reading the other reviews). I did make a few changes: - Sauteed using olive oil instead of butter - Only one tbsp of balsamic vinegar - Replaced the beef broth with veggie broth (we're vegetarians) - Replaced the red wine with probably about a cup of rum If I were going to do it again, I would probably add some potatoes and/or carrots--the one thing my housemates said was that it could have been a little chunkier and a little less broth-y. Overall, though, a really delicious recipe.

My wife liked the soup better w/o the sourcream. I liked it with, so I suggest offering it on the side.

Excellent. I used a house red table wine, and I also used two different types of apples, -- fuji and cameo.

I halved the recipe, making it for two, but found that it was a little more potent that we expected! Too much balsamic, I think - nice flavour otherwise, but I would definitely cut that down next time, and also think abotu pureeing the finished soup. Perhaps add a meaty bacon?

I didn't make this dish as a soup. I used the base ingredients to make a saute' of cabbage, apples, and onions. I omitted the caraway seeds (my husband doesn't like them). What I came up with was a buttery/tangy/sweet cabbage side dish that won even my husband over. You see, he also hated red cabbage.

Nothing special - somewhat bland. Tastes a bit like eating a pickled cabbage soup if you can imagine that. Make Borsch instead.

Just like mom used to make.....quite delicious; I used more cabbage then the recipe asked for to add substance. Quite nice as a starter.

This was an excellent soup. I received excellent reviews when I made it and people are still talking about it. I heartily recommend it as a first course starter.

I added Ardelles sun dried tomatto sausage. Thinly sliced and saured they blended nicely into the flavor.

My family and I just loved this soup. It is a very unique, rich, and flavorful soup. The caraway seed tast is string. If you like rey bread...try this. I did add a bit more cabbage for texture.

Unfortunately, this soup sounds better than it taste. Our dinner club had four different people make this soup and no one was thrilled with the results. It had a strong cabbage and caraway flavor and was not a very pleasant tasting soup.
