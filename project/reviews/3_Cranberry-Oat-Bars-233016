I prepared this as written, with the addition of a tablespoon of minced fresh sage for holiday cheer & a dash of savory. It was pretty, benign in flavor and difficult to eat. Very crumbly.

Made these tonight and we were very pleased with the results....very similar to the bars that we got from Costco, BUT much better...not as dry....so I'll be making these instead of buying @Costco. I baked in a 9x13 or so jellyroll pan and carefully spread the mix rather thin, therefore not making them real thick. Must say again, they're "quite tasty" per my John, will be great with our coffee.

These were easy to make and are pretty good, they do crumble quite easily though.

I used fresh (frozen) cranberries and just added 1/2 more light brown sugar and it worked great! The bars fall apart pretty easily but are very good!

I really liked these because they weren't too sweet. They are easy and you could use any dried fruit and nut. I think to make them look like the picture you would bake them in a larger pan so they would be thinner and maybe crisper, but I made them in a 9 in. square pan and they were moist and high. I used a little nutmag and a little cinnamon. I will sprinkle the top with a few oats before baking next time.

Very versatile recipe. Can be served warm or cold as a dessert or breakfast. I made mine with raisins just because I like them better than cranberries. The top browned but mine also came out moist than the picture showed.

Tasty. More moist than the picture leads one to believe. I used almonds instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand, as well as quick oats for the same reason. Turned out fine, and was very simple and swift to make.

Definately cook for less time -like 25 minutes or so. Also I found the bars to be very healthy tasting --which is great if that is what you are expecting. For a second batch I added some chocolate chips for an added sweetness.

Made this for a large group. There were many requesr for recipe.

What a nice easy seasonal dish. The only change I made to the recipe is the cooking time. I just took it out of the oven when it was brown (about 25 min). It didn't make sense to cook it for 30/35 minutes when the oats are already browned. Perhaps that's why some others thought it was dry. Mine turned out wonderful.

I served small squares warmed, with a dollop of vanilla ice cream. By themselves they'd be too dry. The bars would be good for breakfast with vanilla yogurt, or baked into big flat cookies for a 'to go' breakfast.

I thought it was pretty good; We decided to add 1 cup of chocolate chips, which I think made a difference -- for the better (I also decreased the pecans to 1 cup). It is definitely thick and dry - more similar to a scone or a breakfast bar. I think it is best served for breakfast, not really as a snack or dessert.

This was easy to make. I added fresh cranberries that I froze a while ago. this really worked. I squeezed out a little of the juice after I chopped them
