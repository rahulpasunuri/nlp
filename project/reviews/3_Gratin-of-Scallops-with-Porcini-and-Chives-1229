I never can follow a recipe exactly. I like to think that I have to add my own nuances; however, more often than not it's because I don't have all of the ingredients. I substituted white mushrooms for the porcini mushrooms & Armagnac for the brandy because that's what I had. After I had sauted the mushrooms I then flambed them with a splash of Armagnac & then added the 1/4 cup Armagnac & 1/2 cup water - cooked it away until the mushrooms started to carmelize. Before adding the scallops to the pan I had tossed them with 1 tablespoon of canola oil, salt, pepper, & the chives. After plating the scallops & mushrooms, I finished with truffle oil that I had warmed in the skillet. Magnifico!

I was disappointed because the ingredients sugested something much more delicious. I did not think the flavors melded well. Nothing brought them together as a dish.

I guess I don't like porcini that much after all. Aside from that, it was good. I'll make this again with another less powerful mushroom.

Easy and tasty. I've used bay scallops instead of sea scallops and a mixture of dried shiitake mushrooms and fresh white mushrooms and it'e still delicious.

GREAT RECIPE THE SCALLOPS AND THE PORCINI MUSHROOMS ARE A PERFECT COMBO. I THOUGHT THAT THE PORCINI MIGHT OVERPOWER THE SCALLOPS BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE EVERYONE RAVED ABOUT THE DISH
