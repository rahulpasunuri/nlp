Holy Oregano Batman! Made mistake of using ground oregano - should have used dried flakes. Will try again

This was a great recipe with modifications. I sauteed the vegetables (carrot, onion and garlic) is a bit of olive oil, substituted the tomato sauce, broth and wine for 1/4 cup each ketchup and dijon mustard, plus added worcesteshire and sirachi sauce to meat mixture. I used all ground turkey (no beef) and it was wonderful.

This is the best meatloaf I have ever had. It's not all greasy like normal meatloaf. I skipped the glaze. I was just going to do ketchup. But then I forgot. So then I was going to just dip it in ketchup. I didn't need it! It was so tasty that I didn't want to kill the flavor. I skipped the white wine since I didn't have any and sauteed the veggies in chicken broth. That worked well. I also skipped adding the chicken broth in the mixture because it was plenty moist.

Made this last night. Only thing I did different was add a little more oats and when I pulled it out of the oven I drained a little of the juice out of the pan. It was delicious and will definitely be making again. I've never been so excited to eat meat loaf!!

Delicious! A little too wet but as long as it sits for a few minutes before cutting, it holds together. I used 2 packages of ground turkey and winged all the measurements and added: worcestire dijon mustard ketchup tomato paste instead of sauce a lot of Italian seasoning bread crumbs (panko or similar) 3 eggs (including yolks) mozzarella cheese

LOVED this recipe! However I would suggest using Paula Dean's trick for cooking meat loaf and line a cookie sheet with white bread, and form the loaf on top of the bread. It absorbed the extra liquid and fats and it kept its shape really well! We bought Bertoli's spicy tomato sauce and it was excellent! TONS of flavor!

When i made this i didn't have the pepper flakes on had. Also i forgot it called for egg WHITES and made it with the whole eggs. i don't think you can go wrong with a basic Meat Loaf receipe like this, however, my daughter has a super yummy one made with applesauce. i will post that soon! It's the best! PS: i like to cook peeled potatoes, carrots and onion in a separate pot using chicken broth. Serve them with the Meat Loaf. It's good comfort food.

I just made this as my first try at meatloaf and loved it! It was easy to make and super tasty. All I changed was adding a little cheese, and will definitely make this again.

This is by far the best meatloaf recipe out there. Not quite the traditional meatloaf, but it's a fantastic recipe! I love it!

This recipe sounded delicious. I salivated reading it.I made it exactly as described. It tasted watery to me (do all of the liquids wash away the fat? are they necessary?)I had a second portion leftover --I LOVE meatloaf sandwiches--but again it lacked substance. Oh well.

This is absolutely delicious! I followed the the recipe but used sirloin AND turkey and added ground cumin. It turned out great!

My fiance' said it is the best he has ever had. I used 6oz tomato paste instead of sauce. Whole eggs instead of whites and sauteed the vegetables in cooking spray. Was to die for!!

This is a great low-fat turkey meatloaf; it was SO moist and flavorful! My normal meatloaf recipe is the Turkey Meatloaf in Gourmet January 2003. This one is just as good but with different flavors. Only a couple changes: 1.25 pounds of turkey as that is how much is in one pack, I also added ¼ cup oat bran and ¼ cup wheat bran to up the fiber. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe& This one is a keeper.

I served this for potluck on Wednesday night at church. It was a big hit, even with the children whose parents said they wouldn't eat meatloaf. Some even asked for seconds!! I used a can of tomato soup for the chicken broth and can of tomato sauce. I doubled the Parmesan cheese an omitted the red pepper flakes as well. For the last 10 minutes of cooking I combined 1/2 cup of pasta sauce with 3 Tablespoons of light corn syrup and poured it over the top of the meatloaf. The combination of flavors was good and the meatloaf stayed nice and moist. I will definitely add this to my recipe box for many future meals.

This turkey loaf was great! I did make a couple of alterations based on other reviews and what I had on hand. First off, I didn't cook the vegetables in white wine. I just sauteed them with a little I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray. I doubled the garlic and I used whole eggs instead of just whites. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. Instead of salt I added a couple of dashes of Worcestershire sauce. I also cooked the meat loaf in a muffin tin. The recipe as I made it gave me 11 "meat muffins." I served them with homemade ketchup (another epicurious recipe), and all my seven guests wanted seconds!

I just made this yesterday and it was very delicious - contrary to many reviewers! This was my very first experience with meatloaf and I am keeping this recipe. I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used 2 whole eggs instead of egg-whites and a little more parmesan cheese. I used ground turkey. Also, I cookied it for 1hr, then emptied out (mostly) all of the liquid around the meatloaf carefully(there was a lot!) and then cooked it for another 30 more minutes. This recipe is light and tasty.

Great higher fiber, lower fat version of an all-American favorite. But for the novice cook, it's not a no-fail recipe. A cook has gotta use your judgement on this one. This is my judgment: Saute your veggies, but don't add the liquid if it didn't cook off. Soak the oats for 5-10 min in broth, and dump excess broth. Don't add the broth called for in the recipe. Use a meat mix, such as 1/2 lean beef and 1/2 turkey. Comes out super every time. If this is one of your first meatloaves, don't start here.

I sub red pepper for green pepper and it makes it even more appealing for the whole family; I often make 1/2 with red pepper flakes and 1/2 without so the kids will eat it too. And everyone loves the potatoes!

I have made this recipe many times and i love it. I saute my veggie instead of cooking them in wine. The results are beautiful and tastey.

This is a recipe I've been looking for! I was always disappointed with meatloaf and now I know why. Pre-saute of the vegetables is the key.

My boyfriend and I made this one random evening and it was great. We used ground turkey and on the advise of previous reviewers, left out the chicken broth, cut down the wine, and upped the oatmeal just a smidge. The flavor was great but I need to work on my sauce. I will definitely make this again.

I'm surprised to see how harsh some other members were of this recipe. We really enjoyed it. I made it with some variations just because I didn't have some ingredients on hand and it was great. I didn't have bell pepper so I used chopped celery which added good texture. I sauteed the white onion, celery and carrot in olive oil instead of the white wine, and omitted the chicken broth because I didn't have any on hand, which decreased the amount of liguid ingredients. I really like the addition of oats instead of bread. I replaced the tomato sauce with the same spagetti sauce I used as a topping. I baked it for about an hour so it came out moist but firm. Served it with roasted potatoes and the textures and flavors were great together. I will definitely continue to make this.

Ottawa and Jersey City, please mind the language. It would be nice if Epicurious could moderate the review content. I do read the comments before making any dish but you have not exactly been constructive. This is the second time I've made this recipe. The first time it came out too sloppy as other reviewers have also noted. This time I skipped the white wine and the chicken broth, just sauteed the veggies in olive oil for 15-20 minutes. Two whole eggs in the meat mix, baked for an hour and it came out perfectly with no sogginess. Michael Smith commented in the Globe and Mail a couple of months ago that recipes should be treated as rough guidelines and not necessarily followed to the letter, this is probably a good example. I might have been a bit too heavy on the red pepper (actually I used cayenne) but I don't mind it a bit spicy. It is nice to see the occasional recipe like this on epicurious that is not heavy with fat, cream, etc. You can get good flavourful dishes with healthy fresh vegetables. Finally - I put many recipes to the three-year-old test. In this case my three-year-old son cleaned his plate so a three-fork rating is well deserved. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow, you guys sure were harsh. I did read the entire recipe and comments, and still decided to make the meatloaf. I don't really think I'm an idiot for trying it (sorry). This is really similar to my mom's recipe, and maybe that's why I was open to it. I left out the carrot and added celery; I substituted the wine with some random alcoholic beverage that was on hand. This was absolutely delicious, and didn't even require ketchup. I baked this in lined cupcake tins, then "frosted" it by piping on potato buds (they were smoother), and surprised my boyfriend. He loved it.

I agree with Cook From NJ. This recipe was intended as a joke. Made it for a pot luck dinner, followed the directions exactly, and all the guests stopped eating it after one or two tastes. Out of embarassment, I pretended my contribution to the party were the napkins, paper plates and plastic utensils.

The very time this dish was made for my parents, and they simply loved it. Tomorrow, I will try it again. Thank you for your concern.

Are you kidding me? This recipe is all about saving calories instead of enjoying caleroies. I wouldn't give the results to my dog.

This was great - the flavour was fantastic (though not very traditional) Perfect amount of chilis. Left out the chicken stock and used an extra egg to help it bind.

The flavor was good, but the meat loaf had way too much moisture. I had to cook it for several hours to get all of the juices out...

Being that this is a fairly low fat meal it was pretty good. The meatloaf had wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe exactly, however I did put it in a larger baking pan and flattened it out more. Thank goodness I did because it still needed a good hour to cook thoroughly. It is very, very moist. Next time I would add more oatmeal to even out some of the liquid. The potatoes were good as well, nothing I would make again only because there are many other better tasting ways to make low fat potatoes. But they did compliment the dish well.

This was my first attempt at meat loaf, and I thought it was delicious. Since I'm watching carbs as well as calories, I didn't do the mashed potatoes (made fake ones using cauliflower) and I omitted the oats. I was worried about the meat loaf being too loose and wet, though, so I also omitted the chicken stock and tomato sauce. I added about three chopped roma tomatoes to the veggies instead, and that worked well. Also, instead of using a commercial tomato sauce, I made the spicy tomato sauce recipe on epicurious. Great combination!

I made it exactlly like the recipie called and had no problems. It was so good that it's going in my recipie box laminated. I was a little concerned with how much liquid was in the meat loaf when i put it in the pan but it still turned out fine. The mashed patatos were to die for.

Very delicious, but with these notes: 1) I used equal amounts of ground chicken and turkey; 2) the meat mixture was so loose that I ended up using a pound of each meat and another 1/2 cup of oatmeal; 3) no fresh peppers around, so I used some bottled roasted red peppers; 4) I'll cut back on the red pepper flakes next time.

Fabulous. The fam loved it. I used a bit of hot chilies, and topped it with hot salsa. I was out of white wine so I softened the veggies in the usual way. Cook it for an hour and 20 though.

This dish was very good. Unfortunately, my Afghan Hound snuck a little, so I didn't get most of the meat part. It was really good with pepper lightly sprinkled on it when ready to eat. Quite different than other meat loaf dishes, but quite good nonetheless.

I think this turned out really tasty but not a huge hit with the family. I did omit the chicken broth and added a little extra oatmeal. I also did not add the green pepper. Cooked in 9x13 pan. May lessen amount of red pepper next time.

Both of these were great. Both also came out a little too moist. When I make again I'll either omit or cut down some on the chicken stock in the Meatloaf and add the milk as needed to the potatos.

I thought this was terrific! However, my daughter and my wife thought I had made better in the past. It is unusual, with the boiling of the vegetables and the hot pepper flakes, but I thought it was superb.. I ate it cold for lunch the next day and it was great on bread too!

This is a zesty, more interesting than regular, meatloaf. Heeding the warning of another reviewer, I formed a loaf in the 9x13 pan that was only about two inches high - it cooked in a little less than an hour and was delicious. (I used red wine and it was fine.)

Actually I only made the meatloaf and skipped the mashed potatoes as my husband is diabetic and needs to limit his carbs. The meatloaf was excellent, very flavorful, moist, and interesting. My husband also gave it rave reviews.

This was the first time I made meat loaf so I don't know if it was me or the recipe. I think my mistake was using a breadloaf pan. It still wasn't done after 1 hour and 40 minutes (even after raising the temp to 450) so I finally had to dump it out on a casserole dish. Finally after 2 hours 15 minutes it was done. Also, the prep time was longer than I thought. Next time I'll try a more traditional version.
