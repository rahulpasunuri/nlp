We had made this for an open house in 2012 and everyone raved about this! We made the mixture the night before After the first batch we added some old bay seasoing for a little kick. It was refreshing with the lemon juice!

Despite the reviews saying this was bland, I made it anyway to take to some friends'. Boring! Bland! Everyone ate one, some ate two to be polite. I finally said I wasn't happy with them and everyone (we're close) was relieved they didn't have to eat anymore. At $17/.5# for lump, I wasted a good $40 on this! I will not make again and will encourage you to find another recipe. (Read my reviews; I rarely give a low rating, but this just missed the mark!) Click a link somewhere and get off this page! :-)

This tasted like a fancy tuna melt to me. Next time I splurge on crabmeat, I'll make crab cakes.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2008, and it was a big hit. The crab mixture was delicious (I left out the green onions).

Love the citrus juice with the crab, makes it taste light & fresh. I didn't include the celery as I wanted it to be more crab-y and less salad-y. Only had enough fresh chives for 1 tbs so I added another green onion, used Delouis organic mayo, sour cream and a nice Cheshire cheese. Yum. It does make a ton, I recommend broiling them in batches.

I made these appetizers for Thanksgiving 2006 and everyone loved them - I thought it was a perfect fall dish for my guests to enjoy outdoors while I finished dinner. The balance of sweet crab & spice was perfect. As well as a nice balance of protein to hold off everyone's appetite for the big dinner! It made a ton - we had about 15 people and everyone had plenty. I used store bought mayo, and store bought creme fraiche and these were fantastic! I made the crostini and crabmeat mixture in advance so, it was very easy the day of. I am not sure what the "cook from california" is referring to with the mushrooms - this recipe doesn't include mushrooms.

A great, sophisticated appetizer. Don't make any inappropriate substitutions, but do use the best available ingredients (no grocery store mayo, for instance). It's also incredibly easy.

Looks good but not enough flavor. We did not like the lemon flavor with the crab. The mushrooms were $60/lb. at Bristol Farms and the crab is pricy too. I used oyster mushrooms instead and they worked well.

I prepared these appetizers for my family for Thanksgiving and they quite well received. I'd make them again.

This tasted like seafood salad on a crouton then broiled with some cheese on it. Definitely not a fall dish.
