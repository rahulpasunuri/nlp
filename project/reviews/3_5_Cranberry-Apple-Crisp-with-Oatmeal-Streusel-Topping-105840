Just ok. Tastes better next day when cold

So so so good! I added a whole, split vanilla bean to the fruit when it was cooking and left it in while baking. Added a wonderful flavour. I also added only 1 cup of sugar (not 1.5 cups) and found it was just right. A beautiful and delicious autumnal desert. We served this for our Canadian Thanksgiving dinner.

Overall, a solid recipe. It was the perfect way to incorporate cranberries into our Thanksgiving meal. As many other reviewers suggested, I reduced the cranberries (to 1, 12 oz bag, although 16 oz of cranberries would be ideal) and increased the Fuji apples to 1 1/2 lbs. I decreased the sugar in the filling by about 1/4 cup and thought it was just the right amount of sweetness. When I make this again, and I will definitely be making this one again, I will add cinnamon and perhaps some other spices to both the topping and the filling. Without the added spices there was a lack of depth of flavor throughout the dish. A delightful dessert with minimal effort.

I have made this dish every year for 25 years to serve with our Thanksgiving dinner in lei of cranberry sauce. Everyone loves it and it just is an amazing and different contribution to the whole meal.

I made this for a Christmas brunch and it was delicious. A bit tart for some but with the crumb topping I thought it was very good. I added a half cup of golden raisins.

Loved the combination of cranberries and apples. I cut down on the amount of butter slightly and also used 1/4 less sugar in the apple/cranberry mix. Next time I think I will add 1/2 cup less, as it still tasted too sweet to me. Overall a good recipe and easy to put together.

Meh. Out of six guests, only half asked for a helping. It looked beautiful but I think there are more people that don't like cranberry. I thought it had too much cranberry myself and found the sugar could be upped (I might have skimped a bit there though). Might make again, but with maybe half a bag of cranberries and double or triple the apples.

Hi! This was my first crisp!! I actually used one full bag of fresh cranberries + 6 (smaller) granny smith apples and I doubled the topping. I decided to put into two smaller sized baking pans (one for my husband + me and one for my parents) - everyone loves it! I did think it is a little sweet even though all the teeth in my mouth are sweet! =)

Just a warning-- don't use dried cranberries instead of fresh and keep the same amount of sugar in the filling. I did that, and it was horrifyingly sweet.

Rating: 3
This was absolutely delicious, but with modifications (thus the 3-fork rating). I doubled the topping, and for the filling, I used 10 fuji apples rather than the recommended 3. I also used water (a total of 4T) in place of the apple juice. Did use both bags of cranberries, however, to fill the pan and give a great tartness that worked well with the sweet streusel topping. Served alone (rather than with ice cream, which I didn't miss at all). Definitely will make again.

I have a sweet tooth, and I love crisps, crumbles, buckles, slumps, cobblers, brown bettys, pies, etc., but I found the topping on this overwhelmingly sweet and buttery. Next time I would cut both ingredients by half. The sugar level in the fruit, however, was reasonable considering the tartness of the cranberries. I used 1.5 bags of cranberries and 4 apples (a mix of Cortland, Granny Smith, and Spartan), and I doubled the topping. I spread the ingredients out over two baking dishes, one 8.5 x 8.5 and one 5 x 10.; this worked out well. I added a bit of cinnamon to the fruit as it was cooking on the stovetop. Although I found the topping too sweet and rich, I think it will be better next time with modifications.

Rating: 4
As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the apples and doubled the topping. I did not have cranberries. I found that this made way too much topping with not enough filling - my family still loved it because the topping tastes delicious - but next time I would either 1.5x the topping only or triple the amount of apples to create a better balance

Rating: 4
This was excellent. I also doubled the topping, halved the cranberries, and doubled the apples as other reviewers suggested. I used local apples and have no idea what kind they were - and it was great! So if you don't have the recommended apples, don't fret. I did add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping, and substituted water for the apple juice in the filling. I will make this again.

Loved the top but used the filling from the polenta topped recipe. Great combination

Tasted great. I needed a "dairy free" version, tho, so I substituted w soy butter, and used blueberries (not cranberries), and half the sugar. Was a great Thanksgiving dessert, everyone loved it. Can make well ahead and warm prior to serving.

Mmm this was great. I listened to the other reviewers and doubled the crust, halved the cranberries and added a few more apples. I also cut the sugar back to 1 cup and used wather instead of cider b/c I didn' have any... Delicious!

I loved this recipe! I also doubled the topping, which turned out the be a great idea. I did not use cranberries, therefore didn't cook the fruit with sugar before baking. The result was that the apples were still a little crunchy, which I really liked. This is my new go-to apple crisp recipe!

Rating: 4
I tried it in the summer with fresh berries (blueberry & blackberry) instead of cranberries plus 4 fuji apples. I reduced the white sugar in the fruit to 1/2 cup and kept the topping the same with 1 tsp. of cinnamon. Its a winner, everyone loves it.

I made the components for this the day before, took them in a cooler while we were skiing, and then assembled and put in the oven cook after skiing. It was fabulous, and not too tart, as some have complained. There was nothing left in the dish. Its very easy. One tip: buy a lot of cranberries around Thanksgiving and freeze a few bags to use later; they last a year (!) in the freezer.

Two bags of cranberries and approx. 3 apples? I used one bag of cranberries and 8 Cortland apples and it was very cranberry. I kept the sugar the same and it could have used more. Imagine with two bags of cranberries and only three apples!!

Rating: 3
With a little "doctoring" this is a great crisp recipe. Like others below, I suggest: 1) doubling the crisp recipe 2) adding cinnamon 3) adding slivered almonds 4) using 1 bag of cranberries and 6 large apples. I used Minnesota's own Honey Crisp apples and they worked beautifully.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and my daughter keeps bugging me to make it this year. I guess I'll make again. It really was delicious even the next day right from the fridge.

I couldn't find cranberries in September, frozen or fresh, so I used Craisins. I was worried about that, but it turned out well despite that. I used 1.5 times the topping and added a little extra liquid when I cooked the fruit on the stove, and then added some cornstarch to thicken it up. Overall, very tasty, I would definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
This recipe is always a hit! I highly recommend doubling the recipe for the crisp - it is the perfect ratio of crisp to fruit. Also, if you are unable to find cranberries due to the season, you can double the amount of apples and that works beautifully.

I AM A BEGINNER COOK AND I MADE THIS FOR THANKSGIVING THIS YEAR AND IT WAS A MAJOR HIT. IT WAS SIMPLER THAN I THOUGHT. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECCOMED MAKING THIS FOR ANY OCCASION. :)

I made this desert as part of my first Thanksgiving, and it was amazing. I only used half the cranberries, and also added a small shot of Apple Jack (apple brandy) to the apple/cranberry mixture. Served it with premium vanilla bean icecream and freshly made whipped cream -- delicious and easy to make! Will definitely make it again and again.

Rating: 3
I thought the recipe was really good as originally written. I did add one extra apple, but I also used the two full bags of cranberries and bought good quality vanilla ice cream to go with it. Maybe it helped that the apples I used were especially sweet, but I would make this again and keep those 2 bags of berries in there.

Rating: 4
HUGE raves at my house. My sister in law does all the pies, but I was looking for something different and not to step on her toes. This will be the 5th year in a row that I am making this and its just a tradition that everyone asks for. I have not had any problems with it being too sweet or too tart. Its just right and perfect with vanilla ice cream.

I have made this dish several times. I make it each year at Thanksgiving and Christmas for my family. There are NEVER any leftovers. While other reviewers dislike the tartness of the cranberries, I think they add a nice zing. The cranberries prevent this dish from becoming just another apple crisp you find at Friday's or Bennigans. I always, always, always double the topping, but that's just my personal preference. I just happen to really enjoy that crunchy, buttery goodness. You can server this dish fresh out of the oven or make a day in advance. Works well both ways. I've also used peaches when in season. Delicious. Serve with freshly whipped cream or homemade ice cream. Hope you enjoy this dessert as much as I do.

Made this for a family potluck. Luckily, no one there is a picky eater...but I do think they expected better of me on the dessert. Nothing remarkable here, probably won't make again.

Once found I have made this at least 8 times in two weeks. So good. Not sweet. Everyone has loved it. High quality ice cream a must. Freeze those berries for a future use. Using 3 granny smith's worked just fine. Don't get too hung upon the apple combo proposed.

The topping is excellent but a tiny bit too sweet for my taste. I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and added some more cinnamon and a dash of allspice. Yums!

I think the next time I make this, I will use 1 bag of cranberries and double the apples, a little tart for some of my guests.

I've made this recipe several times over the last few years. My family made me modify the recipe though - I only use 1 package of cranberries. I think it is a nice balance of sweet and tart. Goes great with real whipped cream.

To avoid a trip to the market, I made the following changes to this recipe based on what I had on hand: I used granola instead of oatmeal, 2-1/4# Granny Smith apples, and ~1-1/2C dried cranberries/raisins. I don't think 'Awesome' is too big a word to describe the results !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

A crowd-pleaser! Wonderful flavor with just the right fruit to crumble ratio. Great with vanilla ice cream.

Cranberries were not available, so I used blackberries. Cut the sugar in the topping down to 3/4c, and down to 1c in the filling. It was fantastic. I imagine you could use just about any combination of fruit in this recipe, and I will certainly try cranberries when Thanksgiving rolls around. (That is the only time we can get them.)

I loved this, as did my husband, mother-in-law, and even my children! It was tart and sweet at the same time. I added a touch of cinnamon to the fruit and otherwise followed the recipe. I will be makGthis again. Also, a very pretty looking crisp.

I hate to say it but I did find this a bit tart. Maybe cut down on the cranberries or increase the apple. At any rate, this was easy, delicious and lovely to look at. Vanilla ice cream is a must.

Great Fall Dessert! I factored in the past reviews and used only 6 oz. (1/2 bag) of cranberries & adding an extra apple. Since the topping already had 1 cup of brown sugar, I used 1 1/2 cups of Splenda (sugar sub.) instead of regular sugar (cuts down dramatically on calories). I also took a short cut by not peeling the apples (no one noticed!) Wonderful by itself or with ice cream! (if you are not counting those awful little calories!)

After reading the reviews, I cut down on the cranberries. I actually substituted dried cranberries and only used about 1/2 lb. I should've cut down on the sugar too. Just a little too sweet. I added a little bit of cornstarch to the mixture to keep it from being too runny. It worked!!

I made this for New Years Eve, together with brisket. After reading the reviews and having a problem finding additional cranberries I used the following: 1/2 bag cranberries, 3 fuji apples, 2 granny smith apples and 3 pears. It was delicious! Everyone enjoyed it mightily and it was a breeze to make. I had Dreamery Vanilla and Godiva Chocolate Ice Creams as toppings. Needless to say, happy guests. I will gladly make this again

I made this dish last November for a party and again this year for Christmas Eve dinner - both times it was a hit. Served it with fresh whipped cream once and then with vanilla ice cream. Next time I'll cut back a bit on the cranberries and add more apple to balance the tartness. Otherwise, simple and great.

Rating: 2
Definitely didn't look like the picture. The filling ended up mushy after the double cooking, so it was more like crumb topping on red applesauce. Kind of gross, though the tangy flavor was good. I wouldn't make this again in any case. Surely there's a better way to mix apples and cranberries.

Since I knew someone else was making an apple galette for our dessert table, I substituted pears in this recipe, and also added some fresh minced ginger. Served brandied whipped cream on the side and there wasn't a speck left.

In a word? Delish! Made this last year, without adjusting the recipe at all, brought it to my sister's house for Thanksgiving dessert and got rave reviews... even from her normally critical in-laws! I didn't experience a tartness problem like the other reviewers, but maybe it was because I made it the day before I served it, then warmed it up and served it with vanilla ice cream. I got a call the other day from my sister... the "aunties" are clamoring for it this year too! I think it's a new regular on the Holiday repetoire. Loved it!

I would definitely make this again. However, I didn't have cranberries so I made it without. Obviously I should have cut down the sugar because it was pretty sweet. Next time I'll cut down the sugar if I don't have the cranberries!!

Wish I would have taken the time to read the reviews prior to making the dish. I love cranberries, but yikes was this tart. 12 oz. of cranberries would definitely be enough. Will try it again - modified this time.

We loved this recipe! I followed others' suggestion and cut down on the cranberries--we used 12 oz., but the full amount of sugar and apples. I also added dashes of nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger to the fruit while it was cooking.

Based on the other reviews, I modified the recipe somewhat. I used the full amount of apples, but only half the cranberries. Even so, it came out slightly tart--but delicious, with beautiful ruby color from the cranberries. I also added a little cinnamon and a trace of nutmeg and cloves to the streusel mix. It was delicious with vanilla ice cream. The oatmeal gives a nice chewiness to the streusel.

This was wonderful. I used 3/4 bag of cranberrys and 1 cup sugar. I baked it in a 7 x 11 glass dish for 45min, it was perfect. My husband said that this was just as good as you would fine in a 5 star restaurant. Serve it hot w/ice cream. Yummy!!! :-)

I made this with half the amount of cranberries and the whole amount of apples. Still a bit too tart. I would suggest doubling up on the apples and using one 12 oz. bag of cranberries. Topping was delicious! The desert was a hit at our holiday dinner.

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was delicious! Not too sweet, and just tart enough. I put only one bag of cranberries instead of two after some reviewers said it was too tart. (I also cut out half the sugar in the apple-cranberry mixture.) I tried it with the applesauce instead of the butter, but found that the crust was too tough. Next time I'll stick to butter or oil. I served it with vanilla frozen yogurt - YUM! I definitely will be making these again.

I made this last night and it was really good. I added 1 tsp of vanilla and a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the cranberries and a little bit of cinnamon to the streusel topping. I do think the 9" x 13" pan is too shallow as the fruit will continue to cook down during baking, so I think next time I make this I will us an 11" x 7" baking dish instead. Also, baking time could be reduced to 30-35 minutes, the one I made last night didn't need the whole 40 minutes.

This was passed on to me by a friend. I made it fat free by substituting 1/2 a cup of applesauce instead of the butter. It was delicious and I was asked for the recipe by three people! I would definitely make this again.

This is the first recipe that I tried that had not yet had a rating. I was surprise to read that only 33% would make it again when I logged in to give my review. It was absolutely delicious and the cranberry was as cranberry as you'd expect and the topping worked perfectly with the apple/cranberry mixture. I'll definitely make this again and again.

We made this for Thanksgiving and served it with brandied whipped cream prepared for our pumpkin pie. The recipe was not sweet enough for some folks; I personally would have liked to taste more of the apples. It was very cranberry-y.
