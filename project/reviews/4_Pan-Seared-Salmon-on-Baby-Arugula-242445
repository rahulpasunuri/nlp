I agree with other reviewers that the salmon on its own doesn't seem to "pop" on its own. However, it's on an arugula salad, and when you have a bite of the salad with the salmon, the flavors blend beautifully. I made this with the carrots and brussels sprouts recipe and it was great!

Excellent, with salmon in season. I did a mixture of spinach and arugula. Washed packaged can be found at Whole Foods. I also grilled it in a grill pan, did not cover it, just flipped it. I put a pat of butter on top just as I was taking it off. Came out beautiful!

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. It is quick to make and has just a few ingredients. The combination of flavors is wonderful - good enough for company.

Someone earlier questioned whether a recipe was necessary for this as it is simple preparation. While simple, for novice cooks such as myself, this recipe was very helpful in providing a fantastic and simple preparation for salmon that yielded excellent restaurant quality results! I will come back to this time and time again when looking for a super quick and elegant dinner and when cooking for my boyfriend who prefers simple flavors - especially with salmon which is delicious on its own.

We aren't salmon eaters - don't hate it, but certainly don't love it. Every once in a while, I make a new salmon recipe because you always hear about how good it is for you, and usually I regret it. This is THE best way I've ever prepared salmon. It was simple and perfect. My husband and I both were thrilled with dinner and with salmon for the first time.

An easy way to cook salmon, moist, but not enough taste for me

I agree with a cook from raleigh, nc. I am not a super creative cook and I need the inspiration. I don't have all day to figure out what to do with the arugula in my fridge! I am glad to have found this recipe and many other simple ways to use it.

This was my first time cooking salmon. They didn't have arugula at my store so I got spinach and it was great! I'll make it again soon because I bought a huge piece of salmon!

I made it according the the recipe the first time and it was yummy. The second time I added minced shallots to the marinade and it was awesome.

Wonderful! As others have said, the key is fresh ingredients at their peak! We just made it with a Copper River filet, baby arugula we grew in our garden, a sweet spring onion from the farmers market and grape tomatos. Definitely a "do again" while the arugula is abundant!

The mix salmon and salad is great, I added lemon to the salmon mix.

This is a terrific recipe! Marinating, then pan-searing the salmon (I used Coho salmon filets) gives you a very moist, tender, flaky result. Even though I cooked it 3 min. longer when covered, to get a medium, rather than medium rare result, it still was 0utstanding. I'll use this method of cooking salmon again and again. And, it's terrific paired with the arugula salad--I substituted balsamic vinegar, which I prefer over red wine vinegar. A rice pilaf dish rounded out this wonderful meal.

Super easy and tasty. Fresh ingredients are the key. I served with rice and my 6 and 8 year olds asked for 2nds and 3rds!

Love the simplicity of this recipe! I made a simple sauce of diced green onions, parsley, 2 T. of olive oil, sea salt and pepper. Lovely spooned over the fish at the end. Usually I grill salmon but we are in a major snow storm and pan frying was a fantastic alternative. The skin was crispy and very much in demand. I served the salmon with scallion pancakes using a little of the sauce and adding it to plain yogurt was a great accomapaniment to the pancake.

I rated this 4 forks for ease, healthiness, and taste. A few readers complained that it was too simple but I actually appreciated the nudge to do more seafood--especially salmon--because I forget about it. I typically will do salmon under the broiler, but doing it in the pan, skin down, really helps to replicate the crisp skin that you get at a restaurant. I did cook the fish a bit longer than the recipe suggests because it is just too rare for my taste, otherwise. I added a few drops of balsamic vinegar to the salad and a few more onions.

What's wrong with a simple recipe using fresh ingredients? This was a great weeknight dinner.

Right on, Cook from Oakland. But what do we expect from Parade magazine?

I don't know, do you really think this is a recipe? It's just salmon with a tossed salad. Nothing special about this preparation. Do you REALLY need a recipe for this???

Great fast, tasty and healthful recipe for a weeknight bachelor dinner! I used Kalamata EVOO for a smooth flavor so not to compete with the full arugula and ripe tomato flavors. Did the salmon on gas grill- I just prefer salmon grilled.
