I enjoyed this dessert because it is not terribly sweet and has a nice light flavour. I did not use cottage cheese, but instead, I used full fat ricotta. I have also subsituted pinapple for the apple and used cystallized ginger instead of cinnamon. Anyway, the dessert is tasty.

IN MY EXPERIENCES, IT WAS TO SWEET, AND THE CHEESSE CONSISTENCY, WAS A LITTLE BIT HEAVY.
