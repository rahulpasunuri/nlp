I modified the recipe: Instead of the canned almond paste (who has that laying around?) I weighted out 5 oz slivered almonds and ground them fine in spice grinder (which was way more than 1/2 cup), only 1 stick of unsalted butter and everything else as listed. I rolled them into golfball sized balls, pressed down with a fork, sprinkled with more slivered almonds, and baked as regular cookies rather than bar cookies.

AWESOME. I didn't want to go on a quest for expensive almond paste at the store so I made some from scratch (easier than I expected!) and proceeded with the recipe. Going to be making these over and over again.

I've been making these since 2004 when they first appeared in the magazine and they are now my "signature cookie" that I am known for...although I have adapted the recipe. I use almond filling, which is sweet, so I do not add extra sugar. I use raw sliced almonds on top, so these turn out beautifully. The first time I made these, they were a sloppy mess, so I did have to modify these quite a bit. The recipe as is has too much butter and is greasy. I also now use a disposable pan when I make these, so I can pull it off easily and cut the bars versus greasing the tin foil, etc...the smell of your house while making these makes them worth the effort!

Did the 3/4 cup butter and this was still greasy.My "Batter" was a chocolate chip cookie dough consistency.I patted it into the pan and baked for 38 minutes,let cool for one hour. The almond flavor was medium,the greasy consistency ruined the whole "bar".It left my mouth feeling like it had been coated with lard. I lined the pan with foil "handles" and then lined the foil with parchment.The bar came out of the pan with no problem.

This is a four forks recipe with some adaptations. As suggested by another reviewer, I increased the flour to 1 1/2 c., used exactly 4 oz of almond paste and reduced butter to 3/4 cup. I used the amount of almond extract as recommended. I didn't make them as bars. Another reviewer recommended baking the recipe as individual thumbprint cookies which I did and they came out unbelievable.Filled them with apricot and raspberry preserves. After they cooled, I drizzled white chocolate over the ones filled with raspberry. Took them to a party....they were gone within minutes. Definitely a keeper. I wouldn't make these as bars.

Because I read 2 pages of reviews for this recipe, I read through it carefully before I started. And, like another baker, I don't like using ingredients that I have to special order. I actually didn't even have almond paste on hand--I had almond filling, which I'd bought at the grocery store, so I used that. I increased the flour to 2 cups, but used the same amount of butter. I decreased sugar to 1/4 cup, since the filling is sweetened. I wasn't happy with the consistency--they were done, but seemed more like banana bread than cookies or a bar. So I cooked it for about an hour on a low temp to get the consistency I wanted. I will definitely make these again--they're fantastic! We can't stay away from them! But I would increase the flour.

These sound so good and fairly easy to make but why have a recipe with an ingredient (almond paste) that can not be found readily at a local supermarket?

These are awesome! I used 1 1/4 sticks of butter instead of the full 2 and this last time used pecans on top with great results. No almond extract needed. plenty of flavor! rich & delicious.

Disgusting, greasy sugary mess with almonds on top I'm a decent baker. I suppose if you fooled around with the proportions enough it could be improved but why waste your time...

I love this recipe! It was recommended by my niece who is a wonderful baker. I consider myself a somewhat accomplished cook, but I don't do a lot of baking and it isn't my forte. This recipe is so easy it's practically fool proof and it has a wonderful depth of flavor that is complemented nicely bu a good cup of coffee. I may try adding a little orange zest as recommended by previous poster, but it is fantastic just as it is, a great easy dessert for company.

Just finished making these to take to a dinner party. Unfortunately they were extremely difficult to remove from buttered foil. I ended up with a lot of bottoms missing and the recipe made nowhere near 3 dozen! I love almond but these are a bit sweet for my tastes.

Rating: 3
Delicious but, to my mind, not for company. They're not very attractive and are a little greasy and chewy. I find that yummy but not to all tastes. I agree w/reviewers to top with apricot preserves.

So I used this recipe as a starting point to recreate the Raspberry Almond Boat cookies sold in the Publix bakery. I wanted to make round cookies for the holidays, so I added 1 3/4 C flour to ensure that the cookies would not spread all over the place. I rolled heaping tablespoons into balls, dipped them in beaten egg white, rolled them in almonds, pressing well to make sure the almonds stick and press a thumbprint in the middle and add raspberry jam (~1/2 tsp). I think that they are better than the original. The additional flour takes care of the greasiness commented on in the earlier reviews. I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes on parchment covered air bake pans. They really are amazing.

My Norwegian auntie love these and they have become the 'marzipan' for the family. I add orange extract instead of the almond as it adds a bit more depth to the cookie. I also cut into thin wedges from the 8x11 pan in an effort to keep all those lovely almonds on the top.

Rating: 4
Made these for a cookie exchange so I tripled the recipe and used a 9x13 and an 8x11 pan with 2 7oz rolls of almond paste. I did reduce the butter to 3/4 cups and topped with melted apricot preserves as others had suggested. I did not find them greasy at all - they were great!

These cookies are absolutely delicious! I've made them for several years and my mom always requests them. They are somewhat greasy, and very rich, so cut them into small pieces. Don't forget to line the pan with foil or parchment, because they will stick.

Okay, so I'm reposting. I've made these for three years over and over. LOVE THEM! But do NOT use convection oven for these...doesn't seem to agree with the recipe. I use 1/2 of whatever size almond paste I buy (8 oz can, usually) and have only a few times felt they were too greasy. I do cut the sugar down quite a bit. Also, try 8x11 glass pan. Small jellyroll pan made them too thin and 8x8 is too thick. I do double the recipe and then use a 9x13 glass pan. Seems I tried the mini muffin thing and it just overbaked...if someone has had luck doing that, please post, as I find cutting them a pain because almonds fall off the top! (use water w/the egg white - helps a little)

If you are looking for a rich, dense, chewy almond bar, these are it. They are divine.

QUESTION: Has anyone tried this in a mini muffin pan? Any idea on the baking time? Help! I want to make this for an event at my son's school and I think the mini muffin pan will be ideal: no cutting, no waste and a perfect rich little nibble.

Rating: 4
I did not read the reviews prior to baking, so I used all the butter called for, and I STILL loved the cookies. I doubled the recipe, and used a 9X13 pan PLUS a small loaf pan; I think this made the cookies in the 9X13 pan too small, so I wouldn't use the loaf pan next time

Rating: 4
I doubled the recipe (to use the whole can of almond paste) & baked it in a 13x9 inch glass pan. After baking, I brushed the top w/melted apricot preserves (like a fruit tart), which gave it a lovely sheen, a little apricot to play against the intense almond, and kept the almond slivers from wanting to fall off. I'm making this again as a substitute for coffee cake -- it's really excellent in the morning!

Rating: 4
These were wonderful and definitely merit a 4 fork rating. As suggested I made these with 3/4 cups butter. I may even make these with a little less butter next time. These are a keeper.

Rating: 0
I made these bars following suggestions of other reviewers used 3/4C butter instead of 1C as called for. They were incredible, fabulous and a huge hit with everyone. SOOOO I made them again a few days later using the same 3/4 C butter and they were kind of greasy!! I used to think that people who had difficulty with a recipe just messed up. I now know that you can have a bad day once in awhile...This is still an incredibly good recipe

Rating: 4
These were delicious! I used the advice of others and cut the butter to 3/4 of a cup. However, I misread the directions and added a whole egg instead of the yolk. They turned out fine. These would be perfect with a good strong coffee.

Rating: 3
I really thought these were 3.5 forks, but I love almond paste! I thought these were deeeeelicious cookies with the following changes: all whole-wheat flour, all milk instead of butter (the almond paste has enough fat to hold the cookies together), a little bit less sugar. With these modifications, they were hearty, not greasy, and full of almond flavor! I'd definitely make these again, exactly the same way.

Rating: 4
I made these for the first time just before Christmas and cut them brownie sized. Too big, these are very rich cookies and I didn't cut back on the butter. Perhaps next time I may try that. I ended up cutting them into bite sized morsels, and had loaded slivered almonds on top. All of my guests went nuts over these. I'm hanging onto this recipe.

Rating: 3
These turned out really well for me. Based on prior comments I used 3/4 cup butter, and I think that was probably best--I really don't think I would have wanted more than that! I used vanilla in place of the almond extract because I didn't have the almond and thought that they would probably be plenty almond-flavored already.

Rating: 3
Reducing the amount of butter in this recipe brings it really close to 4 forks!!!

Rating: 3
I like this recipe -- good flavor combination. I added coconut to the top as I ran out of almonds. My only complaint it is that the bars seemed too think -- I would prefer thinner/smaller bars. Perhaps use a bigger pan?

Rating: 1
I made these cookies following the recipe exactly and while I suppose that they do taste pretty good, they are so incredibly greasy that I can't even eat the ones in the center of the pan...less butter and perhaps a bit more cooking time and these cookies would be great!

Rating: 3
This was easy to make and tastes great. I would recommend it. The only thing I did not understand in the recipe was when it said to cut into circles ..not sure how you would go about doing that since they are bar cookies. (there would be a lot of waste that way) Enjoy!

Divine! If you love almond anything, you'll die over these! Made them for a picnic and my husband said, "You might want to leave these home..." He loved them so much he didn't want to share! I used the whole can of almond paste because I didn't want leftover paste around and all was fine. Probably could even leave out the almond extract as it's SO intense. They can be a pain to cut into small squares, and you do want them small, so I'm debating another type of pan to use. Either a jelly roll pan (to make them thin) or perhaps mini muffin cups to make them individually and not need cutting. Quite crumbly in the manner suggested. Will absolutely make again!!!

Here is how this recipe earned four forks: reduce salt to 1/4 teaspoon; reduce Almond Paste to 3.5 oz (half a 7 oz. log); reduce butter to 3/4 cups. Baked in 36 minutes. They were FABULOUS! Still very almond-y; not greasy; nice & chewy; not too buttery.

I've made this twice now both times to raves. I added 1/2 tsp Orange Extract both times. My guests thought I bought them at a fancy Italian pastry shop!

I'd like to try this again with some modifications. I thought these needed another flavor for contrast with the intense almond (and were also a little greasy). Next time, Kirsch in place of the almond extract? Or zest of orange or lemon?

Insanely good. I burned my first batch due to an oven malfunction, but the crumbs convinced me I had to make it again. The second batch was amazing. My mother resorted to hand gestures to explain how wonderful the cookie was and almost levitated. We do share a passion for almond.

Delicious! My family loved them. I had to make them twice over the holidays.

Well, with all due respect, if you add all of the almond paste, as other reviewers did, it takes a 4-star recipe to a 3-star. Just put the extra in a baggie and save it for the next batch of these incredible cookies. They're absolutely wonderful, especially with a cup of tea. But I'm tempted to try the champagne, as well.

Rating: 3
These were pretty good, I thought the time was right on 35 min and mine were nice and golden. I added all of the almond paste, though they are slightly greasy and quite rich, I would maybe even add some whipped egg whites to make them a little lighter. Still you can't beat the taste of almond paste -yum!

Made this to bring to a "Xmas tea" and they were well received. I used all the almond paste and cooked for longer than suggested. As earlier reviewer said - cook them until a darker golden color. Cut into very tiny squares because they are rich.

It was so good had to make it twice as it was going faster than i could make it

I liked the suggestion of the cook to use all of the almond paste, as I had no other use for the leftovers. The almond flavor was quite tasty, but I had a problem wih the topping separating from the cookie.

I think I would take the cook's suggestion to use all of the almond paste. I had a tablespoon left over with nothing to use it in. I thought the intense almond flavor was very good. I had a problem with the almond topping separating from the rest of the cookie. Very tasty however.

Yes, very buttery, but very delicious with the best butter. I've made this twice and definitely agree with the suggestion to cook a bit longer. For the almond lover.

This recipe makes very rich cookie bars. It does have an intense almond flavor, but it also has a very buttery flavor as well. Too much butter for my taste.

Rating: 1
I won't make this recipe again as written. The taste is great, but there's butter oozing out of them. They're not chewy---they're downright greasy. I'd add the other 2 oz of almond paste in the 7-oz tube, and use only 3/4 cup of butter, if that. I'll also cook them another 10 mins (50 total) until dark gold or nearly light brown.
