This dish was a big hit at a tropical Mexican gathering. Doubled recipe. Added a total of 2 tablespoons of a jalepenos/serranos, 1/4 Cup of lime juice and mixed in about 3 cups of fresh mung bean sprouts which added a nice additional fresh touch. Very festive and pretty to serve.

A tasty change from the standard pasta salad. I used frozen mangoes. Very popular at a ladies' luncheon.

This recipe was different and fun to try for a summery change, but i don't think it was amazing. I felt like the dressing could have been better, perhaps if made with fish sauce and lime suice or something like that.

This was a wonderfully light meal. I substituted tilapia for the shrimp. For the salsa I also included peeled/de-seeded cucumber and fresh tomato to add some more substance. Family enjoyed!

Great hot day salad. I made it as written but would reduce sugar by half next time. Received raves from friends and family.

We loved this and there were no leftovers! I used a peanut salad dressing instead of the vinaigrette but this was basically great! Willdefinitely be making again.

Good flavor, with a few mods. Serrano chile peppers have more spice, so we used those.I added the juice of one lime per other reviewers suggestions, grilled the shrimp, and used a mix of basil and mint. My complaint would be how difficult the mung bean noodles are to eat - quite slippery but maybe I did something wrong there.

Definitely a summer favorite. Always use clear rice noodles instead. Love the fresh flavors of the herbs and mango - and the amount of chilies varies depending upon my audience.

I loved this recipe and it was a big hit a communal picnic I attended recently. I substituted mint for basil, as suggested by another reviewer, and the dish was delightfully refreshing with just a touch of heat from the chile. This appeared to be the perfect component of a picnic menu at a fireworks display during Fiesta in San Antonio because it was gone in record time!

This was a great salad to celebrate the onset of Spring. Like another cook, I used rice vermicelli out of convenience, and found the noodles to be a little bit lacking, but still a good base. Doubled the japs, but executed the rest of recipe to the letter. Guests loved it, but I think the shrimp might be tastier marinated in the vinaigrette and then grilled. Also would add a little more kick: red pepper flake or chili oil? That would turn this Spring salad into a perfect Summer side.

This was a great dish - really fresh and clean tasting and a welcome change from the usual. I also marinated the shrimp, left out the ginger though and just used lime, garlic and olive oil and a bit of fleur de sel and then sauteed. Also, I used rice vermicelli noodles instead, because I couldn't find the mung noodles. Mint added a great flavour, but it couldn've used a bit more jalapeno (I doubled it and still had little heat).

Everyone enjoyed this salad.Something different! Used red jalapeno which added nice color.I couldn't find bean thread noodles so used thai thin rice nooldes-too starchy!would be better with the bean thread.also needed more vinegarette,I think.

Made this for an Inauguration luncheon. It went well with Mimosa's and our festive mood. It was easy to make ahead of time, a beautiful presentation on boston lettuce, but it needed a bit of a kick. Next time, I'll add more jalapenos and cilantro.

Outstanding. Per reviews, used 1/2 rice vinegar and 1/2 fresh lime juice for the sauce. Also subbed 1 tsp fish sauce for the salt. To the salad, I added fresh bean sprouts and some market-prepared matchstick carrots, for color and nutrition. Like others, added fresh coriander and mint to the basil. The mango really is essential. Fantastic result for so little effort. Oh, and I soaked the noodles in the same water I cooked the shrimp in.

I love this dish! I have made it on several occasions. It is great for feeding a large group, as it can be scaled easily. It is also great for feeding people that you expect to arrive at different times as it is a cold dish and holds well. One change I make is that I replace 1/2 of the rice vinegar with freshly squeezed lime juice. It creates a fresher lighter tasting dish.

I have yet to make this dish. But may I suggest to serve it over "Coconut Rice" to add some flavor or if you don't like glass noodles. Look up; "Spicy Wok Shrimp with Coconut Rice" for the recipe. I think you will like the contrasting flavors with the mangos.

The flavors here were STELLAR, but the dish overall wasn't. I think I just don't like the glass noodles. I'd rather eat the mango and shrimp salad alone! (The mint was a nice addition, btw.)

This was tasty and easy. I used cantaloupe instead of mango as suggested and it was great.

As suggested I marinated the shrimp in a oil, lime, garlic, ginger, soy sauce mixture before grilling them to add some flavor. I wonder if it would have been a little too bland if I had not done this. Added avocado also to the recipe. My husband loved the cellophane noodles because of the exotic look. We will definitely make this again maybe for a lunch or an appetizer in smaller portions.

What a fabulous summer salad! I changed things a bit. I marinated the shrimp in olive oil, garlic, lime juice, and ginger. And I used the marinade as part of the dressing as well. I added cilantro, avocado, and a little bit of olive oil to the salad. I would make it again, but next time I will probably dump the noodles and serve it over a mixture of spinach and baby greens.

This is a fantastic, light, healthy dish. i did make a few changes; i marinated the shrimp in lime, ginger, garlic, thai peppers, and olive oil, then grilled. I added fresh lime and replaced the salt with vietnamese fish sauce. Also added mint, cilantro, avacado and purple cabbage for more color and a little crunch. very pretty!

THis is a wonderful, bright summer supper. It's colorful, light, and tasty. I served the shrimp salad over coconut rice, but will be sure to try the cellophane noodles nenxt time. I also used less than the called-for green onions, which was fine, but probably wasn't necessary after all.

This is truly wonderful, and SO easy. I steamed my own shrimp rather than using the store-ready and is still took almost no time at all. The family LOVED it!

Super quick and easy! Perfect for a light meal out on the deck on a hot island evening. We like spicy-hot, so I added a few shakes of red pepper flakes. It's a keeper!

I can't believe how easy and delicious this is! I love the idea of adding mint, I will try that next time I make it (which will be soon). It's the perfect weeknight meal. Healthy, quick, unique and satisfying.

Fantastic, fresh flavors - the mango pairs especially well with the basil. I added some Ponzu sauce (1-2 tbsp) to the rice vinegar mixture, and it added a nice hint of soy/citrus to the overall flavor of the dish. I'll be making this dish a lot!

Easy to make. Light, refreshing, and flavorful. We used extra chilies and omitted scallions due to an allergy. This one's a winner.
