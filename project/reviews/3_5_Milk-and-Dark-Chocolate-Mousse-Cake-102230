The mousse is lovely, if a little bland - I prefer egg based mousses by far. Don't even waste your time on this genoise. If you want a nice moist genoise, make it without flour - I use Nigella Lawson's genoise recipe from her buche de noel and it is sublime - 6 eggs separated, 105 ml cocoa, .75 cups sugar and 1 tsp vanilla. Nothing more. Nothing Less.

Yum, yum, yum. A hit across the board.

I've made this at least once a week for the last six weeks or so. A HUGE hit each time. I found the genoise layers to be soft and moist but firm enough to hold up the structure. The cake is as delicous the day made as it is a week later. This is going to be my go-to recipe when asked for a chocolate cake. I found the cake and mousse to be easy to make. The directions are wonderfully clear. No embellishments or changes needed.

I made this with only bittersweet chocolate. I used Ghiradelli's 60% cocoa chips. I think the trick to this cake is letting it sit for a day (or two, or even three) before serving it. Given that sitting time, the sugar syrup soaks into the cake layers really nicely; I didn't feel that the genoise was dry at all and I didn't think the cake needed another dimension to it (meaning the milk chocolate layer). The cake seemed almost incidental in this recipe--the mousse was definitely the showcased item. But I thought that the amount of mousse was almost overwhelming, so next time I'll cut the total amount by 1/3. I did add a pinch of cream of tartar to the cream to help stiffen it and it held up really well in the 'fridge until it was all gone (about a week and a half). I'll be making this again soon, perhaps next time with one layer of framboise mousse!

I have always had dryness issues with sponge cake recipes, so I substituted cake flour for all purpose. I then leveled the cake, prior to cutting it into two thinner layers. Finally, I used all of the sugar syrup called for. To my surprise, the genoise was perfect. Dense, but very moist. Not sure if it was the cake flour that made a difference, but this will be the only genoise recipe that I will use in the future.

I made this recipe for husband and he loved it. However, I baked the cake in ramekins to make lunch-sized portions. The cake became very dense at the bottom (almost gummy) and the top too fluffy. I only used the middle part. Please advise on how to overcome this. Did I beat my eggs for too long? It became very dense. Thanks!

I have made this for friends birthdays and it is always a hit! I also divided the cake into two pans, I thought it worked better. I make it with milk chocolate mousse only, we are not big fans of dark chocolate. I do think it is important to use the syrup and I usually use some raspberry liquor to brush on the cake. By using 2 pans I end up with 4 layers. It really is special.

I have yet to try this recipe, but as a pastry chef who uses genoise on a weekly basis, it is very important to properly "punch" this traditional French sponge cake. Too little will make for a dry result.

I just tasted this in NYC at Payard's own shop (On Lexington near 73rd St). First of all, I was told that the book is old and the shop doesn't have quite the same desserts. The closest thing that they had is what I tasted, and it was DIVINE. The bottom layer is an inch of milk chocolate mousse. The upper layer is an inch of white chocolate mousse. In between is a paper thin (1/8th of an inch max) piece of genoise cake. It was QUITE DRY. On the absolute top was a thin layer (1/8 of an inch) of dark chocolate ganache/mousse and some assorted chocolate shavings and things. So it is true, the genoise in this recipe is probably dry but the way it is now done at Payard it doesn't really matter. This is a mousse recipe, not a cake one. Additionally, the cake is served in the shape of little hexagons (you can cut a large cake into hexagons with no significant waste, unlike cutting it into perfect circular pieces) and the genoise is hidden in the middle of it all (diameter is smaller than that of the mousse layers). I asked and was told that Payard uses Valrhona and Weiss Chocolate. The later I never saw in Montreal, but their website (weiss.fr) seems to suggest it is a good French chocolate. Also, I was told they use non dutch processed cocoa, which seems VERY STRANGE. I suspect they didn't understand my question (I was talking with a sous-chef). Finally, the mousse layers were the best I ever tasted anywhere, they were dense and ultrasmooth. I suspect that I am currently beating the cream a bit too much into peaks and refridgerating the whole thing for too long. From the taste I'd guess that they are using truly heavy cream, maybe 40%. SO DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE AS ABOVE OR YOU WILL BE STUCK WITH DRY GENOISE (brushing with sugar water won't help much).

This dessert was divine! The genoise was a bit dry. Really brush it well with the syrup and then make 2-3 days ahead and the cake really softens and is less dry. Well worth the dirty dishes and prepartation time.

After reading the reviews from others about the genoise being dry, I tried baking in individual pans and baking less time. That is not the answer for the dry genoise. The genoise is history, but I will use the mousses again in another venture. They were very good!

Fabulous! i did divide the genoise into two pans, and cut the baking time to 15 minutes, but the cake was still slightly dry. will reduce it a bit more next time. the mousses are wonderful- i will make again with a white chocolate layer. very easy to make, don't be put off by the seemingly complicated directions- i threw it together on the spur of the moment one evening and was finished in no time. definitely worth it!

Absolutely delicious. Both mousses had a wonderful flavor -- especially the milk chocolate mousse -- and their smooth texture worked well with the genoise. Next time I may use a little more sugar syrup to moisten the genoise, but other than that, I wouldn't change a thing!

I have to agree with Jason the bottom of the cake was a little dry. Apart from that this cake is just beautiful, the dark and light mousse blend together really well. Next time I will bake the cake in two 9 inch tins this might help eliminate the dryness. Be warned though make sure the dishwasher is empty. I used nearly every bowl in the cupboard - well worth it though.

While the chocolate garnishing was not simple to prepare, the cake and the mousse came together nicely and easily. In fact, while the directions seems lengthy and tedious, the preparation actually flowed very well, and the whole cake was completed within 2 hours. The cake seemed a little dry (on the bottom), so I would suggested baking the layers separately.

This is now our family special event cake. I made it for my wedding. After that the rest is history. I have made it 3 times in the last 3 months and get constant raves. Its more work than a box mix, but isn't it worth it?

It was very easy to make. Instead of the cake ring, I used a 9" Springform pan, and put the cardboard cake round on the bottom, which made unmolding it very easy. The chocolate mousses could use some zip, though, like a little Grand Marnier for some zing!

It was good, but not really worth the effort. The mousses were lovely and would be good on other things. The cakes did not have a very good chocolate flavor.

The mousse is delicious and has the right consistency. So easy to make!

Wow! What an easy, and impressive dessert! Don't be put off by the lengthy directions; this cake goes together very easily. I made it in three two-inch cake pans, in order to cut down on the cutting, and my favorite baker's trick worked to keep the layers flat: just sift the flour into the measuring cup directly, rather than spooning it in. Then level it off. The cakes bake flat, so trimming is minimized. One recipe makes three perfect layers, and the whipped cream mousse stiffens in the fridge beautifully. Yum!
