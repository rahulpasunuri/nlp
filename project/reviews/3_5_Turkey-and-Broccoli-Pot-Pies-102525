Very good! I liked the idea of broccoli and red pepper rather than the usual which is what made me use this recipe. Still, I added a few mushrooms, some chopped onion and some pearl onions (frozen). I saw the review that said the sauce would be thin if there were too many veggies so i added a little olive oil and put in more flour than recommended so it was quite thick. I had to add extra broth. I also added more poultry seasoning, fresh thyme and baked the puff pastry (brushed with egg)on top of the filling in a souflee dish. Easy and quick plus simple to make variations of. Will make again.

Used leftover turkey, added mushrooms and onions. Added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 can broth. Made in 9" pie pan with store bought crusts. Making again tomorrow- family loved it!

i used leftover turkey and frozen broccoli and it turned out great. i also skipped the puff pastry and made biscuits, which i baked on top of the turkey/broccoli in the oven. turned out yummy!

Very easy to make and very delicious. Used chicken instead of turkey, and marinated it with Chinese oyster sauce. My father-in-law and husband were not crazy about the crust, but loved the soup. So I repeated this recipe, but made it as a regular soup. It was delicious!

Turkey is not widely available here in Japan, so I wound up making this with a chicken thigh instead. I also made it as a proper pie rather than just slapping a pastry sheet on top. Man was it delicious! Next time I'll add mushrooms, but that's just because I love mushrooms.

YUM! Simple and delicious! Instead of using custard cups, I used a 9-inch deep-dish pie glass and made one big pot pie. This is a great leftover recipe!

These are a quick and easy way to use up leftover turkey. They are nice and light. Be careful not to add too many vegetables or the sauce gets spread too thin.

This was perfect for our leftover turkey from Christmas. I cheated and used frozen pastry shells to replace the puff pastry sheet, and the family raved about it. This also eliminated the need for custard cups; I served it on ordinary dinner plates. The filling was perfect the way the recipe reads. Keep this with your leftover recipes.
