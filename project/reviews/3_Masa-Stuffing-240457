This recipe makes WAY too much! I stuffed a 12lb. chicken and had enough left over to stuff another whole chicken, "with extra for baking alongside". Unless you a stuffing an ostrich, you should make half this recipe or even less. The flavour was definitely Mexican and tasted great with mole sauce, but the texture was very dense and mushy. It basically filled the roles of both mashed potatoes AND stuffing on my Mexican Thanksgiving plate. It was pretty good at the time, especially the part that had been cooked inside the chicken (which had been more steamed than baked, like a tamale, which I guess was the inspiration here). But the leftovers (SO much!) are dry and crumbly and completely unappetising. If I make a similar dish again, I would use the masa to make cornbread, then use that to make bread stuffing. This would give a more dry, fluffy texture, while retaining the nice Mexican flavour of the masa.

I did not like this at all. It was too dense. I could not taste any of the flavors except for the masa and it was unappetizing.

This is an amazing recipe, though the description states incorrectly that it resembles the tamale filling--it's actually similar to the outer masa layer of the tamale. I made the recipe almost exactly as is, baking it all in a large baking dish, but I did increase the frozen corn to about 2 cups for additional texture. It was absolutely delicious. Definitely needs the extra 1/2 cup- 3/4 cup of extra stock for moist stuffing. This is also great the next day--heat in a covered skillet with a little water and top with some shredded cheese--delicioso! I will be making this for early Thanksgiving this year and will be integrating some crumbled queso fresco as a topping for the final crisping in the oven. I'll let y'all know how it tastes.
