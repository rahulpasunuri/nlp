I love the dense crumb and subtle espresso flavor. I used dried cherries, pecans and cinnamon. Baking time at 325 was 80 minutes. 1/2 the glaze would be plenty or not needed at all for a less sweet cake. My husband and I are fans of tea cakes and pound cakes so this was a hit.

This is a tricky cake. First, I used walnuts, tart cherrie and cranberries in the batter. I also added a 1/4 cup bittersweet chocolate chips to give it some depth of flavor. I have a convection oven with a feature that converts standard receipe instructions to convection. The cake baked about 1hour and 20 minutes using this technique. Low and slow is best on this cake so the sugar does not cook too quickly and burn. I also used a silicone loaf pan. Using this piece of equipment, you can let the cake cool completely in the pan and take it out easily. I've made the cake twice and my family loves it. It's worth the time and effort.

The recipe sounded great, but I agree with other reviewers that it comes out dry and the crust heavy. It got passed by at a recent brunch. Disappointing.

I love the combination of ingredients. Half the glaze is plenty. But, my cake was dry at 1 hour, 10 minutes. Wish I took it out sooner.

Delicious! My one complaint is that it took over 90 minutes to bake at 325F resulting in tough side and bottom crusts. Despite this, the cake interior was still moist. I would like to make it again using a different combination of ingredients - I used cinnamon, almonds and cranberries in this one - and perhaps a higher baking temperature.
