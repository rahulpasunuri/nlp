I liked this better than bananas Foster because it had more complexity of flavor. I used plain homemade vanilla ice cream, although the cane syrup ice cream sounds good. I was worried that it'd be to sweet, though. I didn't allow the peaches to cool a little bit before serving, so I ended up with a melty mess, but I guess I'll know better next time. I would have loved to have added the rum at the end and lit it on fire, but I forgot that my rum did not have a high enough alcohol content. I added a tiny splash of triple sec at the beginning and added fresh orange juice at the end, which I thought worked well.

Very easy to make and outstanding. I used hand packed specialty store bought ice cream. I made it ahead and it turned out great.

To the cook who wanted a flavor more like that of true Bananas Foster: there's a fabulous recipe for Peaches Foster in Williams-Sonoma's "The South" cookbook. It's very similar to this one but more intensely flavored. It calls for macerating golden raisins in dark rum for about 30 minutes and adding those to the peach mixture, and also calls for flambéing the peaches right before they're spooned over ice cream. Try it!

I LOVED this ice cream and added a little more cane syrup than called for(Steen's is our favorite). I liked the peaches foster, but found the sweetness overpowered the flavor of the ice cream, which I think is fabulous. The next time I make this, I will use vanilla ice cream for the peaches and eat the cane syrup ice cream plain--a great recipe!!!

I prepared this exactly as the recipe was written and it was wonderful. Unlike the previous review it tasted amazing like Bananas Foster although with peaches.

Bananas Foster is my favorite dessert and I love peaches so I was eager to try this. I followed the recipe to the letter, used expensive rum, fresh organic peaches, etc. The results tasted more like peach pie filling and didn't have the yummy, rummy, carmelized flavor that Bananas Foster does. It was still good, but not great. Maybe I'll try setting this on fire next time! he he.
