I have only had great success and lots of compliments with this recipe! I dont use hazelnut powder and frankly have added more almond powder than listed (and have added crushed almonds when no powder is at hand). I find the thicker the wedge of fruit, the better (one nectarine = 6 wedges). Also, I have added more creme fraiche than in the recipe and varying amounts of sugar depending on the ripeness of fruit. I am thrilled with the results!

After having made this at least 20 times with various fruit combinations, I must disagree completely with the previous reviewers. This tart is the easiest, most elegant, most popular dessert ever. It works with summer or winter fruit, and the "custard" is scant enough to provide merely a compliment without overwhelming. I always substitute almond extract for the nut powders, since I don't keep them on hand. The result is sublime!

If you have good fruit, it is axiomatic that you can't improve it with any sort of custardy filling. With respect to this recipe: First of all, the puff pastry didn't - what a waste. You'd be much better off with a pate sable sucre or short sweet tart crust in this recipe. See my first comment on fresh fruit for my take on the cream. Additionally, the acids of the creme fraiche (lactic, I suppose) and the acids of the fruits (ascorbic??) clashed. If you must make the cream filling, then use a low acid fruit.

disappointing both in taste and appearance. Easy to make but had no flavor; the pastry got too brown before the fruit was done.
