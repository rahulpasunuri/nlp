Yummy! I've made this several times without finding any need to make changes.

Strange. This might be better used as an appetizer than as a sandwich spread. I omitted most of the sweet pickle and the clove flavor was still too dominant.

The butter is not necessary,. Try adding one whole Jalapeno (without seeds) and a teaspoon of horseradish for some extra zip...

I have been making a version of Deviled Ham for years. I don't use the butter - you really don't need it. I think the addition of honey and cloves would be interesting. I also use a combination of mustards - french's, Plochmans stone ground dijon so on.

I thought the mustard was overpowering, next time I'll use less. And definitely don't use all the butter, just a smidge will do ya. Overall, not bad for a ham salad.

This is a very good deviled ham recipe and can be served on crackers as an appetizer or as a sandwich filling. Took it to a football game tailgate party and everyone loved it! The addition of the butter makes it easy to spread.
