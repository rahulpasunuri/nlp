Excellent cake!! I have made this several times. Only adjustment I've made (based on other reviews), was using 1/2 & 1/2 b/w cornflour & riceflour for the 1/3c of cornflour. Excellent alone or w a berry compote topping. Excellent as a nice, light dessert at end of heavy meals and also during the (always) hot miami weather!

Excellent flavors and easy to make. I got slivered almonds and used a coffee grinder to mix in with all purpose flour to make the almond flour. Used the grinder on the corn meal to make it more fine for the recipe. Turned out excellent with none left at the end of the night.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, using blackberries, blueberries, and strawberries (it looked very patriotic for the 4th of July). For the corn flour, I just ground cornmeal in a coffee grinder. My dad even said it was the best dessert we've had in a while!

a delightful summer recipe... used rice flour instead of corn flour. Loved the texture and flavor the almond flour added. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe turned out excellent. My family loved it, although I changed a few things. Instead of corn flour I used brown rice flour and I don't really like nuts that much so instead I just used all-purpose flour.

This recipe was fantastic! It came out much fluffier and lighter than I expected.The only substitution I made was replacing the corn flour with rice flour.

I substituted maple syrup for honey in the topping, and organic golden brown sugar for the granulated sugar, otherwise I followed the recipe. Loved it! I was pleasantly surprised at the nice sponge cake texture, especially for gluten-free.

Delicious recipe! My wife must avoid gluten, but not dairy, and thus I substituted 1/4 cup butter for the olive oil. It tasted wonderful! The fruit mixture should be poured on just before serving, or the tart will become soggy, but don't avoid the "sauce" of the fruit mixture because it is fabulous.

This recipe was fantastic. Fairly easy to make, it just took a bit of time. But it was perfect for my sister who is allergic to wheat and dairy. I substituted oat flour for corn flour because it was what I had on hand and it was delicious. It should cook for the full 35 minutes.
