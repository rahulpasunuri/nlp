This was relatively easy (for phyllo) and very tasty and satisfying, especially considering the little effort put in. I too thawed the phyllo before cutting strips off. Artistically formed nests made for a lovely dessert to finish off our Greek themed evening.

This recipe is really easy to make...but you have to make a modification to the preparation instructions. You absolutely cannot work with phyllo pastry frozen...it will crumble, as other people have mentioned. So, to cut your phyllo ribbons, let the phyllo thaw according to package directions, and then begin slicing off sections. Make and work with one slice at a time, keeping the rest of the dough in the bag to prevent drying out. From then on, follow the recipe and it's not too difficult. You can Google 'working with phyllo' to find tips on how to work with it. Very handy.

I really struggled with the nests in this recipe. My phyllo basically crumbled, so I wasn't able to work with it the way it was described in the recipe. I just moistened the pieces with butter as carefully as I could and sprinkled the sugar on top. It tasted good (the phyllo with honey was yummy), but it just didn't work for me, so I'll not bother to try it again.

In general, easy to make. But they are finicky and time consuming. Worth the effort as they taste delicious and look spectacular. I loved the honey on it.

Well, mine didn't look like the picture, but they sure tasted good! I used a combination of peaches, strawberries and bananas on the "nests" and left out the honey. It made a quick, light and tasty summer evening dessert!

My friend made this for our cooking club and it was delicious. In addition, the presentation was beautiful.

This recipe is not possible. There is no way you can roll out the dough after you cut it! I ended up making little roll ups with Phyllo and topping them with strawberrys. Very disapointing.

I gave this to two friends to make for our couples dinner club. The phyllo crumbled while slicing and they weren't able to gather enough shreds to make nests. One bought tart shells and the other just cut squares of phyllo and layered those. This might work better with commercial shredded phyllo (which isn't easy to find in our area). I might try it myself this way.

This is an easy and delicious light dessert. I found it here in a search for ways to use up an opened package of phyllo. It is very versatile. You can make as many nests as needed. I needed only 3 servings so I just sliced up the last 4 or 5 phyllo sheets that I had instead of mutilating a whole package. Note: the smoked trout souffle' in a phyllo crust on this site is excellent also.
