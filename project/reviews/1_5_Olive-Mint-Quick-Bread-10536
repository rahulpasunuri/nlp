I tried this because I had a lot of fresh mint that I needed to use up. It came out better than I thought it would. The mint gave it a nice flavor but wasn't overwhelming. It's not my favorite quick bread, but I'd make it again. I had to leave out the olives because my partner won't eat them; it definitely would have been better with olives. So if you like olives, give it a try.

How would I or anyone else know because the recipe as listed was supposed to be warm chocolate tart,I believe, and it came up as Olive Mint Quick Bread. I wanted the chocolate recipe. This is the only way I could figure out how to let you know of the miss match.
