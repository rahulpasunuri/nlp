Reading the other reviews about the dough being too sticky, I threw in an extra 1/2 cup while mixing and chilled it a little over an hour. When I took it out, I put down a fair amount of flour, patted the dough down a bit and dusted it with flour too and had no problem gently rolling the dough out. I dusted the cookie cutters too which got a little sticky, but otherwise I had no issues with this recipe. It didn't help at all to try to compare to other recipes as the ratios were so totally different. But this one was quick and easy in my opinion.

Ditto with other comment. Measurements were way off.

The flavor of the doughnuts was wonderful but the batter was too thin. I ended up adding another cup of flour in order to be able to roll it out and it was still really sticky.
