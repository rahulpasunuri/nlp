This was wonderful and quite easy! I loved it...it was a bit more pan-Mediterranean than the usual bruschette, but that was not a detraction...fabulous.

Thank you "cook from San Diego" and Harry Rubenstein. Can't we all just get along. Cooking is about creativity. Save authenticity for the history books. Thank you for this recipe. It is wonderful.

To suggest that there is only one way to make a dish is absurd - ESPECIALLY for Italian food. Culture and tradition varies so much from region to region throughout Italy, that they could be almost considered separate countries! I think the barbecue analogy is quite correct, for those who want to think of it in domestic (USA) terms.

All the debates about recipe authenticity and cumin/coriander vs. garlic vs. lime juice vs. Italian know-how vs. California inventiveness makes me want to curl up on the couch with a plate of Kraft Mac & Cheese, if only to draw fire from the food snobs, who would surely knock down my door to insult me. However, this recipe was actually quite good as written. All my guests seemed to enjoy it!

This was not my favorite bruschetta topping but tasty nonetheless. I am more of a traditionalist. BTW for those who argue that this is not traditional "bruschetta" because it contains cumin or what not it might be helpful to know that bruschetta refers not to the topping but to the bread. Breschetta is a type of bread cooked in a brick oven with hot coals that is particularly crusty. Its considered a peasant bread and was, and still is, used to taste the pressing of olive oil which is likely where "brushetta" had its origins.

"BRUSCHETTE" HAS GONE THE WAY OF "SALSA" IN THAT THERE ARE SO MANY INTERESTING VERSIONS THAT CAN BE USED FOR JUST ABOUT ANY COUNTRY'S CUISINE...AND I THINK THAT MAKES FOOD SO MUCH MORE EXCITING!!! THIS VERSION WENT EXTREMELY WELL WITH A CUBAN STYLE MEAL I RECENTLY MADE...EVERYONE LOVED IT!

Thanks for the comment on the grilled bread deffinition of the word. My topping is not traditional, but I like to add capers and a few sliced black olives to my tomato, basil, oil, and I too like the balsamic taste.

This was wonderful served with a ceasar salad for a light dinner. By the way, this is not a forum to debate people's opinions of a recipe's authenticity, especially if it lays no claim to being one! To me, it is taste that is of the utmost importance, not authenticity!!!

I hate to get into the fray - but I will. I think people have different experiences with bruschette, just like people have different ideas about BBQ pork. I lived in Rome and had bruschette with several different toppings. Bruschetta comes from the verb bruscato which means toasted on the grill. So, this recipe qualifies for the title, since it is basically grilled bread. However, the topping is certainly not Italian. The classic bruschetta is a slice of bread, grilled, rubbed with garlic, drizzled with newly pressed extra virgin olive oil and sprinkled with salt. As the cook from Switzerland points out, the usual topping is chopped fresh tomato, basil, and olive oil. I have had bruschette in Italy with garlicky cannelini beans and onion as well as with other toppings. While this topping is not Italian (not to me anyway), it did have an interesting flavor. I served it as a starter for a soutwestern themed BBQ.

I haven't even made it yet, but it sounds delicious. Why don't you change the name to spiced bread or something so the silly traditionalists will keep their shirts on and not ruin it for all of us. Please!

Perhaps "bruschetta" is a misnomer because this recipe doesn't stick to the Italian tradition. However, a mistake in the name shouldn't mean you don't try the recipe. It really is delicious and, as the other reviewer mentioned, quick to make.

Just my 2 cents to add to the ingredients listed by the other cooks... I add a little bit of balsalmic vinegar and it gives it a little tang. yum.

Made this with the London Broil...wonderful flavor combo. This really wasn't all that involved, maybe the recipe LOOKED that way.it only took maybe 15 minutes to prepare/assemble and I made two sticks of bread(enough for about 12 people) The toasted spices really gave this depth. If you like to wow your guests..definitly try this.

The spices just do not belong on a bruschetta and it is way to complicated; an addition to what was suggested for the "real" bruschetta: do not chop the garlic but take the fresh, peeled glove and rip it on the freshly toasted bread like on a grater; top with chopped uncooked tomatoes, basil, salt, pepper, olive oil, a little lime juce if you like it

I haven't tried this and don't think I will. Bruschetta is a traditional Italian appetizer (please you Italians out there, correct me if I'm wrong!) and would never have cumin or coriander in it! Simply chop tomatoes, garlic, basil, a little salt and pepper - don't cook it! and serve on toasted baguette slices. Delish! I'm sure there are many ways to serve this - but cumin? and coriander? Please!
