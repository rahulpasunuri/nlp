I tried dipping these cookies in chocolate to make them more pallatable, but they were still dry. I added vanilla instead of almond extract because I thought it was silly to cover up the hazelnut flavor with almond (why not just use almonds?). But I have learned that hazelnut just tastes stale without chocolate.

These melt in your mouth. That said, I've made several of the variations on this theme, and simply for flavor, others are better. You just can't call these cinnamon crescents. There is no cinnamon flavor at all. The texture is lovely. I'd suggest at least doubling the cinnamon. Also, if I make these again, I will put cinnamon in the powdered sugar that coats the cookies. By the way, try these replacing the extract with lemon extract. I put zest in the powdered sugar a day ahead of time, cover, then sift when ready to use. Scrumptious!

Wonderful cookies. I've made a variation for years using vanilla instead of almond flavor and without the cinnamon, these were a delightful change. I think the might be equally as good with pecans or walnuts.

Delicious cookies. I had trouble finding hazelnuts in some of the stores around me, so I used almonds, and it came out great. I also added more cinnamon than they said (just cause I really like cinnamon). The cookies are buttery, airy, and really yummy!
