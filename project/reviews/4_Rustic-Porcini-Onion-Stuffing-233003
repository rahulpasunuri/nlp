I've made this twice and it was amazing. It disappeared before the other stuffings that were not vegetarian. :)) I used sourdough bread and chopped the veggies a little smaller than called for.

Fabulous!

I too was replacing a meaty recipe (the Bread Stuffing with Mushrooms and Bacon from this site) with a veggie one. I only used half an ounce of porcini, and didn't put the full amount of soaking liquid in later, and the stuffing was perfectly flavored and just the right moistness. Next time I'll chop the carrots smaller just out of personal preference.

As a new vegetarian who loved her sausage dressing at the holidays, this was a perfect substitute. I used porcini, crimini and white mushrooms and they created a great meaty flavour so I couldn't even miss my sausage dressing.

Rave reviews from everyone! Definitely keep the extra porcini liquid around for extra moistness (esp when reheating this as a leftover in the oven). Also added roasted chestnuts, threw in walnuts which made it extra special. Had a request from a friend who is a chef for this recipe!

I've been making my version of this stuffing for 3 years now and it never disappoints! I chop the celery and carrot finely, add fennel and use more liquid than called for. I use cremini mushrooms instead of white as well. This year I also added sausage to half of the batch - divine. Can't wait for the leftovers!

I have made this recipe every year for the past five, and it is a hit every time. The rustic style with the large pieces of bread, and the rough chopped veggies are a great combination. I often add more fresh herbs, but that is a personal preference. Make way more than you need, as your guests will be asking for seconds

Very nice stuffing. I wasn't able to find any porcini mushrooms, so I was forced to use plain, fresh mushrooms. Even so, the stuffing was flavorful. Everyone enjoyed it.

This is the best, most flavorful stuffing I have ever eaten. My guests loved it and I would/will definitely make it again. The Porcini mushrooms have a woodsy, earthy taste. I used round loaves of sourdough bread.

I made a half recipe of this as my vegetarian stuffing this Thanksgiving. Apart from cutting it in half, I made it exactly as written and found it to be just the right amount of moistness for my taste. The top layer got a little crispy and browned but the lower parts were moist.

Update...freezing it worked beautifully. I thawed it overnight in the fridge and baked it, dotted with butter and covered with foil. Uncovered it at end to let it crisp on top. Everyone said it was the best stuffing they had ever tasted!

I just put this together and am freezing it unbaked in zip-lock bags so that I have it ready to pull out for Thanksgiving...but I saved back a bit and baked it just to taste it today. It is sensational! I read a past review that mentioned not baking it- but I feel that the bread took on a delicious sweet carmely flavor during the baking, and wouldn't omit that step. I used one round organic crusty white loaf (1 lb) and the liquid was plenty for that amount of bread. This a wonderful stuffing recipe- so glad to finally find an alternative to my Mom's beloved stuffing recipe, which uses Peperidge Farms stuffing mix- which is so full of chemicals and preservatives that I could never bring myself to eat it anymore!

I have been making Thanksgiving since 1984 and this is the best stuffing I have ever made or served. Most important though is to have great bread.

this is an amazing stuffing recipe. it's true, it is a bit too dry. it needs more liquid so i'd recommend adding water or stock or the porcini mushroom liquid bit by bit until you get the moisture you desire. but other than that this had an amazing, complex taste. i made it for thanksgiving and it was a hit. the porcini mushrooms are what definitely make this taste so good. i didn't put the breadcrumbs in the oven, instead i cut into little squares and let them sit out on trays for a day to dry out.

I used 2 fewer cups of bread, added 1 cup of vegetarian mushroom broth and still found this to be quite dry -- there is no way the 4 1/2 cups of liquid is enough. If I were to make this again, I would add an extra 2-3 cups of broth.

I'm not a stuffing fan so I'm basing my review on the RAVES this stuffing won from my guests. Everyone said this was the best stuffing they'd ever had. I made a few changes - chopped onion, garlic, carrot and celery fine and sweated in butter, then cooked the larger pieces of mushroom and shallot. I used a baguette and let it sit out a few days instead of drying the bread in the oven. I also added extra of the porcini liquid and some chicken stock, as my guests preferred a moister stuffing, but I'm sure it would have been fine dry. Excellent!

I am always looking for a good vegetarian stuffing. My husband suggested we skip stuffing for thanksgiving, sinces he's never liked stuffing anyway....it turns out that he loved it and had 2 servings! Before i baked it i thought it would end up being dry but it stayed moist and delicious.

I needed a recipe for vegetarians and meat eaters. I was cooking a few dishes for the dinner and stuffing was one of them. This was a vegetarian stuffing and called for bread--I was in the San Francisco Bay area so fabulous bread was everywhere. This was easy to make and was absolutely the best stuffing I've ever made or eaten and I've been cooking Thanksgiving almost every year for 20 years.

Tried making it second time - it was so much better with these changes: - Forgot Porcini liquid last time so added it this time - this is key to having deep flavor - Added pecans, walnuts and chestnuts - really added some nice crunch - Made veges much smaller than described - didn't like the chunky texture of the veges first time around - Didn't bake - kept the stuffing moist out of the pot. Actually was eating lots straight from the pot it was so good!

I needed to add about 1 cup chicken broth after adding the called for liquid. I prefer a moist stuffing.

This was a very tasty stuffing recipe. I saved time by buying dried bread crumbs (1lb.), and it certainly did not compromise the flavor. I will definitely make this again.

This is a straightforward and scrumptious stuffing for omnivores and vegetarians alike. The mushroom aromas were divine. We assembled this the night before baking.

Found the mushroom taste a little strong, would probably not use all soaking liquid the next time and dilute some broth. Added 1/2 cut chopped toasted pecans, which was a nice addition

My friends and I hold a "practice thanksgiving" to test out new recipes -- all the food, none of the family drama. I made this stuffing (dressing, really) for a mixed vegetarian/non-vegetarian crowd. It went over really well -- not complicated, tasty, and not overly rich. Definitely a go-to stuffing recipe -- and I'll bet it would've been great stuffed into the bird, too.
