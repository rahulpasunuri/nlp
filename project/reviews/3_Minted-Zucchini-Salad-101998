This looked okay--definitely drain the zucchini. It was pretty bland overall. I'd say, save your zucchini for something else.

This recipe was really, really bad. It tasted like pure mint, and the texture was poor. I thought it was so bad, I couldn't bring myself to bring it to the pot-luck party.

I made this at my girlfriend's house and she doesn't cook (no shredder, definately no food processor) so I finely julienned the zucchini instead and it worked great. No wateriness and I thought it looked pretty good too. I will make this again, but I will play with the dressing. The lemon and mint make it a great light summer salad, but for me, a little lemon goes a really long way.

I really liked this salad. I peeled and seeded the tomato, then grated the zucchini and drained it in a strainer for about 15 minutes, so I didn't have the trouble with wateriness, but I did reduce the mint to 1/4 cup the second time around and it was better.

Despite the rave reviews from the other cooks, I've got to say this was a disappointment for me and my friends. Fresh mint, used as a core ingredient, has a very special, peculiar taste all of its own, and if you have always liked mint in your food, you will like this one. But if not, then you might want to cut back down on the portion of mint used. Strongly agree with the rest of the cooks who chose to drain the veggies for some time -- definitely a watery recipe. Be careful with the salting and peppering as well -- it's easy to overdo them that not even sugar or mint can overcome.

A light and fresh tasting dish, and a great way to eat zucchini. I agree with the reviewer who recommends salting and draining the vegetables...the dish became rather watery after sitting.

I thought that this was a wonderful summer salad! It was very refreshing and definitely a new (and easy!) way to prepare zucchini. Everyone liked it!

WONDERFUL. COULD BE IMPROVED BY DICING TOMATO & SHREDDING ZUCCHINIS, SALTING THEM AND THEN LETTING THEM BOTH DRAIN FOR A WHILE TO INTENSIFY THE FLAVOR. OUR SALAD WAS A BIT WATERY. WOULD CILANTRO ADD SOME ZEST? VERY UNUSUAL, VERY PRETTY, AND VERY GOOD!

Like Stephanie from Baton Rouge, I served the salad in individual bowls and my husband commented on the special effort as they looked so beautiful. Also, very delicious... I've been telling everyone I know to try it.

Fantastic recipe! I served it in individual dishes so everyone got their own mound of zucchini with tomatoes in the center. Not only does this taste wonderful, but with the bright green zucchini and red tomatoes, it is just beautiful when served. The mint and parsley really add a great flavor. Even my 9 year old daughter was asking for seconds and thirds and then promises from me that I would make this dish often!! Yes, this will be made again and again!!!

Great combination of flavors! I doubled the recipe and served it in a large shallow bowl. Guests who normally shun vegetables were asking for seconds and thirds.
