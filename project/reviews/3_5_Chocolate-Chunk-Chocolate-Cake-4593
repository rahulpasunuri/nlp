i make this cake for every event i want to impress people. it is always well received. I LOVE IT. One change i have tried with good reviews is to use 2 regular toblerone bars and 2 dark toblerone- this is good if you love dark chocolate.

This cake got rave reviews. One guest, who doesn't eat many desserts, thought it was the best cake she had ever eaten. I'm known far and wide as a chocoholic, and I really liked it. CHANGES: I used "fake" eggs and close to 3/4 cup light sour cream. In addition, for some odd reason, my nearest grocery only had white toblerone. I crushed the 4 bars in the processor instead of leaving them in chunks. The Toblerone crumbs put inside the cake melted, making for a moist cake. I let the remaining Toblerone crumbs sit atop the hot cake for 10 minutes, then I spread it like an icing. The white, unsmooth icing looked very pretty on the dark cake.

I wish I could give two and a half forks. This cake has been a standby for me for many years - I make it when I want something good that doesn't require a lot of work. However, after I made it this past weekend, I think it's time to move on. There is something definitely missing from this cake - while it is sweet and yummy, it doesn't have a lot of depth. If you just want a chocolate fix and don't have a lot of time, this is a good way to go. If you want something truly chocolatey and sublime, look elsewhere.

I would not make this recipe again. I felt the cake was to dry and it was missing something.

I have made this cake at least three times. I use a combination of dark Toblerone, white Toblerone, and milk chocolate Toblerone. It adds an extra oomph to the cake. It has a great consistency, but you must keep it covered tightly or it gets to dry. I will be making it for Thanksgiving again.

Everybody loves this cake. It is easy to make & is best served warm. After it cools you can always heat it up in the microwave!

Unexpectedly dense, reminiscent of a pound cake--but delicious nonetheless. However, it's missing a certain zip that I look for in a chocolate cake, although the flavor seemed to improve with time (my cake didn't dry out at all, and all I did was keep it covered with plastic wrap). Overall, very tasty, but the next time I make it I'll try to add a bit more kick to it (perhaps by using unsweetened chocolate instead of cocoa), and also to lighten the texture so it's not quite so heavy.

This cake was quite good on day one - moist and chocolatey - but somehow rather one-dimensional. It did dry out quickly, though, and I probably wouldn't bother to make it again. The Toblerone was expensive and I know there are better chocolate cake recipes out there.

Easy to make and very for chocolate addicts. I put 1 cup 1/4 of sugar because I thought the original recipe has too much sugar. It worked wonderfully. A little slice goes a long way as it is a little bit heavy. very good

I'm pulling out this recipe today for a special birthday party at the office. The last time I made it everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan. Easy to transport. I also added some chunk semisweet chocolate to the batter. Served it all up with vanilla ice cream.

This cake got me rave reviews ! Another sweet success.

I would really give this recipe 3 1/2 forks if I could. It was very moist which I liked a lot, but wasn't all that flavorful. I was expecting it to be a bit more exciting than it was. I used a combo of chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and peanut butter chips in the cake. The peanut butter chips were a major hit. I made this for a friend for her birthday , and we definitely finished it up. As she put it "you can't go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter!" Good easy cake for when you don't have tons of time, and the lack of frosting added to the appeal of the cake...

this cake was absolutely exceptional. the presentation was incredibly dramatic and impressive for such little effort. everybody thought it came from an expensive bakery. my only complaint is that by the time the center of the cake is baked properly, the outside edge has dried. i'm wondering if anybody has a solution to this. for the person wondering about the collapsing middle - you're underbaking the cake. cakes collapse when the batter hasn't sufficiently baked. oh, and i used only 1 and a half toblerone bars for the top. that was plenty.

i found this cake to be too heavy and dense for my liking. although it tasted great, next time i would lessen the amount of toblerone to ease up on the sweetness.

This cake is so good I would make it every week if I could find a way to burn off all the calories. Yes, it is that good.(p.s. I used a small container of berry yogurt instead of sour cream)

I cannot count how many times I have made this cake. It is a favourite of my family, my friends, and many bake sales. I mix mine with the food processor, thus getting it very consistent. I use Toblerone for occasions, otherwise, I use whatever kind of chocolate is in the pantry. (Looks great with a mix of white and dark chocolate!)

Great chocolate cake recipe, but is better when only half as much toblerone is added.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delish! I substituted chocolate chips for chocolate bar, and mayo for my lack of sour cream- It still turned out quite yummy; VERY heavy like a brownie. I spread the warm ch.chips over the top after it was done baking, forming a harm solid chocolate top when cooled. Interesting cake- I'll definately make it again- and perhaps try it with peanut butter chips, too!

I have made this cake several times and it is always well-received. It looks fantastic and the taste never disappoints. I do wonder why it always sinks in the middle as it cools. I plan to try it with semi-sweet chocolate bars next, as I prefer this to milk chocolate.

WORD TO THE WISE, WHEN HALF ASLEEP MAKING THIS, DO NOT PLACE CAKE IN FRIDGE WHEN DONE....MAKES FOR A VERY HARD CAKE---ALITTLE DRY BUT THEN AGAIN MAYBE BECAUSE OF BEING REFRIGERATED---WOULD DEFINTLEY TRY AGAIN THOUGH.

A dream of a chocolate cake. The Toblerone updates the old-fashioned quality and makes it more interesting than the classic chocolate cake. Baking is not my strong suit, but this is inspiring. It's a cross between a chocolate pound cake and a brownie, but still cakey. Delish!

I took this to a meeting for a friend's birthday. I realized after cutting and serving the cake how incredibly rich it was. I told everyone not to worry if they couldn't finish their piece of cake, I would understand, because they were not small pieces. There wasn't a crumb left on anyone's plate.
