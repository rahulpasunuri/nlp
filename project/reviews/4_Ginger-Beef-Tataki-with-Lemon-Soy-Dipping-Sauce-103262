My hubby is a huge red meat eater, and he married me, a semi-vegetarian, poor thing! I keep trying different beef recipes for him, and I think this one is his favorite. He actually swooned while eating it. I did it quite rare, and marinated for over 24 hours, and he said it was perfect.

Saved my life. Literally. The only place that serves beef tataki is a local sushi haunt that sadly prepares EVERYTHING together (cross contamination nightmare) so to enjoy the tataki - beef & tuna, I get to take my shellfish allergic life in my hands each time I go. Three benedryll coma filled nights later THIS recipe filled the craving WITHOUT the allergy hit. I'll be making this again and again.

This was pretty good. I sprung for the filet mignon, and I will admit that it wasn't a good use of the filet - this recipe could probably be used with Tri-Tip just as easily. The dipping sauce was awesome, and paired with Shiso (Ooba) leaf, it was a popular dish. But you seriously do NOT need to blow fifty bucks on filet.

Not much to this one and not worth the time. Think of a piece of beef and some grated radish...does that sound great? I must be missing something here.

This is incredible! My guests could not get enough of this.

We used this recipe for Tuna tataki. Sear a tuna steak for two minutes a side, chill with the marinade over night and serve tuna sliced thin with the lemon soy sauce. Even guests who do not like "raw" fish loved this one.

This is a terrific recipe. Bought 2 1/2 lb. tenderloin, cost a fortune, but it was worth every penny. Made it for "Gourmet Club" and there was not a bite left. Couldnt find the bonito shavings for sauce so left them out, the sauce was just okay without them, but the little piles of ginger, daikon and green onion accompanied the meat perfectly. Served this meat with crunchy lemon rice (rice with finely chopped water chestnuts, green onions and lemon peel) and snow peas with lemon tarragon butter (from this site) and for dessert we had lemon granita with fresh fruit. It was a lovely fresh meal.

Made this for a philharmonic concert in the park and got rave reviews! Plan to do it for our friends's anniversary dinner and need a WINE RECOMMENDATION for this course!!! Any suggestions?

My husband loves steak. I however get tired of eating it grilled all the time. This was a nice change and really very easy. I did everything ahead of time so when we sat down to our romantic dinner I was very relaxed.

I did this recipe last summer for a church picnic potluck and it went over very well. I wanted to make a lot of the meat, so I used a 4-lb. brisket and it was still pretty tender. The flavors soak in very nicely--not overpowering at all. I just garnished it with green onions over a bed of lettuce. I will try to get some of the pickled ginger to use as another garnish the next time I make it.

served this at a party with other asian finger foods, and it was the favorite of several guests. this is a great do-ahead recipe with little prep time. we used flank steak instead of tenderloin, and i reduced the marinade for dipping, although the meat was well flavored by itself.

My husband and I both liked this..he however prefers to have the meat reheated..I tasted it both ways and it was delicious either way.
