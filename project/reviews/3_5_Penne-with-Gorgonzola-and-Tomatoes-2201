If you like bleu cheese this is excellent. I had leftover Gorgonzola and Stilton I wanted to use up. I only had a little over 4 oz's. It still turned out good but I would prefer it with the full 6 oz's I believe. I doubled the tomatoes and both my wife and I thought it could easily be tripled. I also went 1/2 on the butter and didn't miss the other half and added 1/4 cup red wine. It was almost a little dry so I also add 1/4 cup of the leftover tomato juice from draining.

This dish is quite tasty if you pay attention to a few details. There are many different kinds and qualities of Gorgonzola cheese. Using packaged "blue cheese" is not the best choice. Look for actual Gorgonzola and if possible for a Gorgonzola Dolce. You want a creamy cheese, not a crumbly one. That allows you to leave out the butter entirely. We also added a few tablespoons of red wine with the tomatoes. Fresh basil is naturally better, but the recipe has to specify the measure of dried basil for those who can't get fresh.

I've made this since first published in 1991 and my whole family loves it. Only thing I do differently is use canned crushed or diced tomatoes which adds more liquid and always use fresh basil. Also, only cook until sauce consistency. Lastly, I add some roasted pine nuts as topping when served.

I do not recommend this recipe unless you are a fan of strong, pungent cheese and lots of it. Based on the comments of other reviewers, I used a generic blue cheese instead of Gorgonzola, omitted the stick of butter and doubled the amount of tomatoes. The blue cheese and onion flavor was simply too much.

This recipe was easy, quick and tasty. With some deviations, this recipe turned out to be 4 forks. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the amount of tomatoes, draining out the liquid. I also cut the butter down by at least half. I decided to add about 1/4 cup red wine to the tomato mixture before simmering, and simmered the sauce a little bit longer. The recipe turned out fabulous. My husband thought this was an excellent recipe. I highly recommend this recipe, with the deviations, as it is quite a tasty surprise.

A great dish but you have to use higher quality blue cheese.

As the French would say, "It lets itself be eaten" - and not much more than that. Not great; the gorgonzola taste was just OK, subdued by the butter, and didn't really do much more than that. Dried basil is pretty gross, and fresh can't take all that cooking without losing all its flavor. I made this because my boyfriend doesn't eat anchovies; otherwise, my favorite quick tomato pasta recipe is the tomato anchovy one from this site.

My niece introduced me to this dish and this site. She too added extra tomatoes, as do I. It is a very favorite of ours.

No need for all the butter. Used 1/4 and it was still great. We added double the tomatoes. Good color - good flavor. Will definitely make it again.

Very good for those that like gorgonzola. I do!! Instead of plum tomatoes, I roasted cherry tomatoes and then added them at the end. Also, fresh basil is a must. Yummy

I liked this a lot, but I cut down on the gorgonzola & butter - I only used about a 1/4 of what the recipe called for & it was still a bit much.

This is a wonderful recipe! We first had it about 10 years ago when a friend called and invited us for an impromptu dinner and this was the main course. Since then we've made it again and again with reliable results. Sometimes we cut down the butter and sometimes not. But, the inevitable outcome is that our guests practically lick clean their plates. A winner, imho.

Great recipe. Instead of all that butter, I substituted 1 Tbs. unsalted butter & some softened brie cheese. For presentation, topped with halfed cherry tomatoes, parmesan cheese & basil/Italian parsley combo. Used penne regate. Excellent.

I cut the butter in half following the advice of others. My husband and I did not care for this recipe. It sounded great, but was lacking something. We like gorgonzola a lot, but will try another recipe next time.

My friend and I made this and it was fantastico! The tomatoes really compliment the gorgonzola - so it's not too overpowering, but just right... you can tell there's gorgonzola in there, and it was totally tasty!! yes yes yes make it! I found it a little watery (my friend didn't) The next time I would drain the tomato sauce a little before adding the gorgonzola (BUT SERIOUSLY any recipe that uses that much butter and cheese HAS to be good!) buon appetito!

I chose this recipe for the convenience -- it was easy and I didn't need a lot of ingredients. I was cooking for a lot of people and this was very easy to prepare. I thought I would love this dish because I like gorgonzola cheese but I have to say this really did nothing for me. It was just very unexciting and the butter was a little overwhelming. I must say though I did get some nice compliments from my guests who enjoyed this. My personal opinion, I would not recommend this.

Really a tastey simple meal that pleased all. I wished that there was a little more sauce, but all in all was very delicious! I also cut butter in 1/2.

I love this dish and make it without the butter. Still tastes great, and not so greasy.

Very easy to make and quick! It's incredibly flavorful (I made it w/out butter) and would be great with shrimp and a pinch of red pepper. I'll definitely make this dish again.

This is an easy, but delicious dish. Will serve for a dinner party. Next time, I will add shrimp while sauteing the onions. I, also, reduced the amount of butter.

Wonderful! I made it with half the butter. I didn't have any Penne. So, I used Italian Garlic Egg Noodles. This recipe will be in my future cooking.

This was very easy recipe, but I would serve it more for a family dinner than for company. I followed the reviewers' suggestions and cut the butter amount in half, but I think it needs the entire amount to get the full flavor across. I have used better pasta recipes (see the Penne in Cream Sauce with Sausage, ca. 2/97). I'd make this again, but it's not my favorite.

Surprizingly interresting. The butter is really not necessary! Can also be made with a mixture of gorgonzola and other soft rippened chesse such as Brie or Camembert.

This was a great and easy dish. My son loves Pasta and this was a huge hit. My husband liked it too. I will make this again!

Delicious! I made the recipe with 1/2 stick of butter instead of a whole stick and it was great. Was worried that the tomato sauce wasn't going to be enough, but when I added the cheese to it, it was plenty. Will definitely make it again.

This is a excellent recipe that is sure to be a palate-pleaser. I omitted the butter entirely and found the dish wasn't lacking. Also, the sauce goes well with other pastas, grilled chicken, and gnocchi. Try the sauce spread lightly on some crusty golden-baked bread.

I doubled the tomatoes at the advice of previous critics, however, next time I make it I think I'll triple the tomatoes & increase the cheese by 50%. Easy to make! My boyfriend loved it & so did I! It made the whole house smell wonderful!!!!!!!!

Always searching for wonderful pasta recipes, we found this one to be a keeper. Since our family typically does not like 'chunks' of tomatoes, we substituted a can of crushed tomatoes. In fact, we doubled the recipe for a dinner party and used two 28-oz cans of crushed tomatoes. The sauce thickened nicely and proportional increases in onion, garlic, basil, butter and gorgonzola resulted in a tasty sauce.

Excellent flavor and makes for a nice presentation. The tomatoes, fresh basil and gorgonzola are wonderful together. I followed the recipe exactly-no need for modification. This is a keeper!

I also followed the suggestion of using a 28 oz can of tomatoes. I liked it - as did others who ate this - but I think the extra tomatoes took away from the gorgonzola taste. On the other hand, the sauce would have been skimpy with less tomatoes. Next time I'd use the larger can and a little extra gorgonzola. Chopped parsley on the top was also a good addition.

This is a quick very flavorful dish. I think adding some cut up grilled chicken would be a nice addition. The fat content is a little high. I cringed while I was combining the stick of butter and the cheese. YIKES!!!

The sauce works better if you use one 28 oz. can of plum tomatoes and lots of fresh ground black pepper. Every single person who has tried this can't wait to have it again. It's easy to make and absolutely spectacular!!!

This is an easy recipe for an unplanned dinner. It worked great for a friday in lent and was a big hit with the whole family. (two children 13 and 9) we all loved it.

My husband absolutely loves this dish. Be careful when adding the cheese and butter mixture to the heat so that the sauce does not break. Make this for your next dinner party and you will be a star.
