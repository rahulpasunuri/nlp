Yummy. I also used anchovy paste and a bit more tarragon, also a little more buttermilk to thin out to the consistency I like. It doesn't need any additional salt with the anchovy, but be generous with freshly ground black pepper.

Used anchovy paste instead of fillets and a tad more tarragon. Delicious!
