Forgot to mention - I don't know why you need 3 oranges for 1 tablespoon of orange zest??

I don't know if it was the fresh Coho Salmon that we bought or the recipe but this was fantastic! I made this for 2 of us using 3/4 pound of fish with the skin. I followed one reviewers advice and sauteed the skin side down first, removed the skin and then flipped it - no oven. I think the little crispy areas really added to the result. I rinsed and patted the fish dry before cooking and I thought it was a little salty, my husband did not. The sauce is fabo!! All so easy.

this was fabulous! In that we only had a 1.5 Lb fillet, I didn't need all the rub - made half and probably used 2/3 of what I made. Left in the fridge for several hours. The sugar melted into the fish and made a gorgeous glaze. I brushed off any large piles of kosher salt that didn't melt. In my cast iron pan, I seared the flesh side of the fillet for about 2 minutes, then flipped it to the skin side (I left the skin on) and let it cook through for another 2-3 minutes for medium rare. Served with garlic chili spinach and crusty bread to dip into the extra creme fraiche. Delish - will make again.

I cut this recipe way down to make with only 4 small fillets, I used 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 tablespoon of kosher salt along with some orange zest and black pepper, we thought the flavors were excellent. Mine ended up resting for almost 2 hours before cooking, I can only think that made it better. I halved the horseradish sauce.

This was very good, and easy to prepare, but a little too salty. Maybe next time instead of 'patting' dry with paper towels I will brush off some of the salt rub with paper towels. Or decrease the amount of salt in the rub? Good flavors overall though, and the sauce was wonderful.

Very sophisticated dinner. I served 8 for an After Christmas Dinner get together. Everyone liked it and its something I know Ill make again.

Excellent but here's what I did...since I was making this for just 2, hubby & I, I only used 3 fillets so I halved the salt mixture and based on the comments, washed it off and put just pepper on the fillets before putting in pan. Well, hubby Mike thought it needed a little salt after cooking and he did a little sprinkle at the table. I disagreed and left it off. Both were happy. Also, I decided the oven portion of the process was because of so many servings so I charred the skin side (yes, I left it on...skin on fish is like bone in meat...more flavor) and then flipped and put the top on the pan and finished on top of the stove. No oven needed. The sauce was halved and oh, so good. Hubby was very happy with whole thing. Served with a veggie melange from the freezer (home grown).

I've got to concur w/cook from brooklyn - my preparation ended up too salty. Rinsing sounds extreme, but sitting here post-dinner it kind of makes sense.

I made the whole menu and this was the only part that wasn't fantastic. My guests and I all found the salmon way too salty. Was I supposed to rinse the rub off? The sauce was very good though.

Actually, the instructions refer to the SKIN SIDE, which would be where the skin WAS. This recipe is delicious! I am a big salmon fan and always hunting down new recipes!

recipe calls for fillets of salmon skinned... yet the instructions call for the salmon to have the skin on...
