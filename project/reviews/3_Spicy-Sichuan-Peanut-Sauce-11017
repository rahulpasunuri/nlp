As a gluten intolerent person I had to omit the hoison and substituted balsamic vinegar instead. It made a great marinade for a leg of lamb (an asian banquet dinner). I then reduced the sauce over heat for about 20 minutes until it was a paste and plated the lamb with a dollop of the thickened sauce. It was terrific. Be careful that you don't burn the sauce when reducing it.

Very good. Consistency was fine too. I did double the the hoisin sauce as well as the chili paste. Next time need to use as much ginger as the recipe calls for (didn't have enough).

This recipe was a total hit at our BBQ yesterday. I made this sauce to accompany the chicken sate. I only used 1/8 cup of seseme seed oil and used chicken broth instead of water. I also added a little extra broth to thin the sauce out to a proper consistency. Everyone absolutely loved it.

It was good, s/b 2-1/2. Thick. Used more hoison because it tasted bitter w/o noodles. Other recipes are better

Made this sauce to use in the Turkey In Jade recipe, and also as a condiment. Excellent ground turkey recipe btw! Tasty recipe with a few minor tweaks. Used chunky peanut butter, tamari in place of soy, 1/8c. each of sesame, and peanut oil, seasoned rice vinegar, 2t. of sate chili paste, (contains ground peanuts as well as red chili and garlic), 2T. of hoisin, coconut milk in place of water, and 2T. of thai palm sugar, (the sweetness to balance the savory). Quick and easy with no cooking! The recipe yielded close to 3-1/2c. Will use again on upcoming meal of satay made with chicken tenders.

Excellant! We made it with Chicken Satay. With the left sauce we used it in a refreshing wrap, sandwich!

Hallelujah! I thought the perfect spicy peanut sauce recipe had eluded me forever! I used Thai hot chili paste, coconut milk (in place of the water) & 2 T lime juice. This could be a tad spicier (a bit of cayenne or more curry paste). I used this as a sauce over sautéed chicken breasts & broccoli, garnished with scallions. Absolutely heavenly & so very easy!!!

I added much more garlic, hot sauce, ginger and rice wine vinegar than the sauce called for, as well as cutting down the amount of water I put in. I used it as a dressing for rice noodles, tofu, bean sprouts and snow peas. I think the modified sauce was good - but this is definitely a recipe that should be adjusted for taste.

Makes an excellent dipping sauce for the Vietnamese style spring rolls or satay.

This sauce was too thick!!!! It tasted like I was eating out of the peanut butter jar. Flavor was good, but the consistency was bad. I was looking for a sauce similiar to the one at my favorite Thai restaurant....

The sauce was too watery, needed more soy and vinegar so that it could be really pungent. I have a huge bowl of it left cause my family didn't eat it. Next time i will reduce the amount of water by at least half. It needs to be jazzed up more.

This is a very tasty peanut sauce. It goes well over udon noodles with sliced steak on the side.
