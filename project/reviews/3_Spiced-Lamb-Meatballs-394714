I just made these and they were delicious. I left out the pecorino because we are dairy-free and didn't miss it. These would be great on the grill as well. They were pretty fast and easy to make. We will have these again. Not sure what side dishes would be best but am thinking lots of spinach, greens, cucumber - along those lines. We had potato gnocchi and sautéed black kale.
