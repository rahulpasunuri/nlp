This is a great recipe that really has wonderful flavor. I had a smaller head of cauliflower so used only 2 TB butter and 1 TB olive oil - - left fennel seeds whole and subsituted tumeric for saffron threads and reduced honey to 3 TB. Pureed roasted beets -- puree was quite thick -- was confused about adding lime juice and 'reducing liquid by half' -- I had no 'liquid' to reduce -- so I had no beet 'emulsion', but nevertheless the beets puree mixture tasted wonderful. I think the beet mixture makes this recipe. Will definitely make again.

A spicy, sweet and savory way to prepare cauliflower. Loved the combination of spices (reduced the honey by 1/2). Used roasted beets for the puree and while not necessary added a nice tart contrast and bright color.

I made this dish twice, the only substitutions were black pepper since I didn't have white pepper, and we pureed fresh roasted beets rather than canned. I accidentally added too much honey the first time. This was very spicy and sweet at the same time. I usually eat cauliflower with potatoes using Indian spices (like a dry aloo gobi), but I like this recipe for a nice change. My husband barely tolerates cauliflower, but he loved this preparation.

My husband and I loved this recipe, although I would call it spice-braised rather than spice-roasted. I served it on top of apple-parsnip puree. It's a surprising and very good combination of flavors, and looks gorgeous. The saffron really shines with the honey. My cauliflower got tender in less than 30 minutes.
