I was disappointed with the sauce. Flavor seemed to be missing something. Not bad but not great.

I will make this not only with the mango cream puffs but also for cheesecakes!

This was a great and refreshing sauce, it went very well with the mango puffs. The mint and mango compliment each other and you walked away from the table feeling a bit less 'sinful'.
