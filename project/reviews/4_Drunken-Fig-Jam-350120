It is delicious with Spanish Manchego cheese on crackers! It's a great way to use the abundant yield of Black Mission Figs from our dwarf fig tree. I have plenty of half pint jars for hostess gifts. Maybe next year, I'll try it, without the Brandy.

Like others I reduced the sugar in this recipe ... 3 cups rather than 4. Also added orange zest along with lemon zest, with the juice of the lemons added in for good measure. The zest helps reduce the flavor of intense sweetness which ripe figs naturally have, regardless of the amount of sugar! It's delicious - I will definitely keep this recipe.

As written: okay, but in two versions, fabulous. Used green (Kadota) figs. Yes, cut the sugar. Ver 1: brandy, with spices added at the end of cooking (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves). Delish. Ver 2: no brandy, & let the lemon peel candy. Tasty and tart. Both have been hits for two summers.

I found this too sweet too, but I'll try it again with less sugar and more cooking time, as I do want to learn do to something with figs that works as a relish for cheese. I also used a Tunisian liqueur, Thibarine, made from dates because I had no cognac and that may have added to the sweetness.

I've been making oodles of fig jam this season, and this one was the first I tried. It set up nicely, but it was the least favorite of all I made-- it was far too sweet-- with fresh figs coming straight off the tree, the fruit I was using was already very very rich. I'd cut the sugar significantly, use more brandy, and just cook for longer.

I've been at odds, trying to figure out what to do with the figs that arrive in my courtyard every Spring. They've been no more than a slippery mess in our courtyard for years, UNTIL NOW! Wow! Great recipe! A little sweet, yes, but I've added cranberries to the recipe and believe it is a winner.I had it w/ a rosemary, sage, thyme marinated pork roast and it was to die for. Also my first time at canning, so this was super exciting. Look forward to giving it as gifts!

Am in middle of making; taste-tested before letting it sit for an hour; this is so good I might as well just get out the ice cream and have a dollop, but I should probably wait til it's after 5 o'clock! Aw, heck, it's 5 o'clock somewhere.

I used 2/3 green figs, 1/3 black mission figs, increased brandy slightly per other reviews and used 1/2 lemon, 1/2 orange zest plus juice (too dark to go out and pick another lemon), and only 2/3 sugar. Took longer to reduce than quoted, ended up with a lovely complex flavor, kind of a caramel roast fig with a hint of brandy. I added a little low-sugar pectin since I was decreasing the sugar and it set up fine. Will try it again with just lemon as written but keeping the other changes, though the slight orange hint is nice. I may try some honey as well in place of some of the sugar, it would lend a nice note.

Very impressive, indeed! Made some substitutions: Used 2 tangerines (zest & juice) instead of lemons, 1 cup of a dessert wine (Creekstone Vignette) for the brandy, dropped the sugar back to 3 1/2 cups, and added 1/2 packet of liquid pectin. Also, I have some sort of golden figs growing here. Flavor is bright & sunny, color is too! Can't wait to share my jam during the holidays.

OMG! So good! I experimented with this recipe: left out the lemon, but added the zest of one lemon and one orange. Added raspberries (w/o the seeds), then let it simmer for an hour. Fantastic! My seven year old and I have gone through a jar just this week.

Very easy and yum. The house smelled heavenly. Didn't have brandy so I used cognac (1 cup)... think I could have used more. Also used grated lemon rind and lemon juice. Made hot pepper jelly the same day - next time I may add a few hot peppers to the figs just for a change of pace.

This jam was fabulous! I did make a few changes- I used 2 cups of honey instead of sugar, and swapped 2 oranges for the lemons. It's perfect with goat cheese, or on steak with a little blue cheese. Came out wonderful!

Made this at work and it turned out fantastic. I had 12+ pounds of figs, mostly black mission, so I made a few changes to accommodate. Stemmed and roughly cut the figs in half, microplaned all 8 lemons and used all the juice, only used 3/4 of the sugar called for, used 1 full bottle of apple brandy, and 3 tsp sea salt. Threw everything in a large rondeau and let it go on med/low heat till the figs broke down almost all the way then blended the whole thing to get the consistency I wanted. Very yum. We're planning on using it for cheese plates, foie gras, and some nutty tarts.

This is a fabulous recipe. I cooked the jam one day and then the next heated it slowly and then put it in the jars and processed. Excellent with goat cheese or at the other end of the spectrum, delicious with peanut butter.

I used grated lemon rind and Pear William brandy. Delicious.

I used 2 3/4 lbs figs from my daughter's tree (all that they birds hadn't decimated) and rounded out the 4 lbs of fruit with 1 1/4 pounds strawberries, cut in quarters. I cut the lemon peel in wide strips as per the reviewer below and removed it before I filled the jars. 3 cups sugar instead of 4. It is fabulous!!!!!

Didn't want to make such a large amount so I cut recipe in half. I didn't have brandy/cognac I used some 'apple jack' instead that I had around. Otherwise I made as written. It came out very well & has a nice flavor. Once the jam had cooled I fished all the lemon zest out. The flavor the zest imparts to the jam is very nice, but when the matchstick sized zest is eaten directly it tastes bitter and was a bit hard in texture. So next time I make this recipe I will leave the lemon zest in 'wider strips' so it is easier to fish out & remove when the jam is done cooking.

This is good and so easy. I did use 1 cup brandy and cut sugar to 3 1/2 cups. I had just picked my figs and all were not that ripe, so glad I didn't use all the suger. It would have been too sweet.My whole family just loves it, looking for any way to eat it. Also, I did add the lemon juice.

Looooooove this recipe! I made a batch a couple months ago, with more brandy and less sugar, just awesome! I have the remainder of figs from our trees frozen, am going to make a batch and can it this week for Christmas gifts, it is just perfect for the holidays. I am thinking that I will use oranges and there juice instead of lemons, although I did love it the original way too.

Not loving this jam. Following others advice I reduced the sugar a little -- 5 cups sugar for 13 cups of ripe black figs-- and upped the Brandy and lemon juice. Still it's cloyingly sweet. In it's defense, I'm new to figs, so maybe this is what jig jam is supposed to taste like? I did achieve a great consistency without pectin by boiling for 40 minutes then running a hand blender through it. It's thick but not jelled -- like a good strawberry jam.

Just finished putting up 15 pounds of brown turkey figs from my tree with this recipe. I followed the advice of others and upped the brandy, added the juice from the lemons, but left the sugar as the recipe called for. The result is total ambrosia! These will be very special Christmas gifts for family and friends.

Heavenly on goat cheese! wonderful flavors! I keep bees so used honey in place of the sugar, and used half the amount called for. I didn't see where the recipe mentions using the lemon juice, but I did and think it's essential. I also put it through the food processor (briefly). I will make this for gifts this holiday season!

What a great way to use a tray of figs from Costco! My figs were a tiny bit moldy so I removed the skins. I used a lot less sugar, a lot more brandy, and the zest from an entire lemon plus half it's juice. The figs were so soft that they just fell apart while cooking, so no mashing required. I served it straight out of the sauce pot to guests who spread the warm sticky stuff on blue cheese, goat cheese and port salut. My favorite combination was a whole wheat cracker smeared goat cheese, a few strings of caramelized onions, one toasted walnut and a drop of this fig jam...sooooo good!

Luscious! this stuff is addictive and tastes like it should cost $20 a bottle. I upped the brandy and cut the sugar by a bit- good thing I did because I loved the brandy flavor I got and it was perfectly sweet. It's great on ice cream and spread on crusty bread with goat cheese!

This is my second year making this jam which is super easy and tastes great. I can see why many people like to use less sugar, but I like the full sugared version (I unabashedly have a huge sweet tooth). My 97 year old grandmother said it was the best fig jam she ever tasted. Did I mention that she managed fig orchards until she retired?

Oh...and I used green figs, and rather than mashing the mixture as it cooks, I used the food processor at the end...just briefly...this thickened it very nicely. It is fabulous!! Definitely will do this one again!

Ooolala....What a pleasant surprise and a great way to preserve the fig crop. I served a dessert of vanilla gelato with figs roasted with honey and drizzeled this fabulous jam over it. It is like a marmelade and my guests LOVED it!

Delicious and easy! The consistancy is just perfect. Makes more than recipe says so prepare extra jars.Also, brandy taste is very light so if you like a stronger brady taste you will need too add more than recipe states. Very Yummy!

Great recipe but I think it's missing pectin as an ingredient. Following the directions, it seemed thin, so I added pectin - definitely helped make it from a syrup to more of a relish / jam.

To die for!! I used Grand Marnier and upped the sugar a bit since my figs weren't terribly sweet. A great holiday gift idea, too!

Very tasty. The mellow brandy flavor really comes through and complements the figs. Mine also turned out thin, and I used the full amount of sugar (ans also green figs, as did lamb2love from Seattle). The figs don't have enough natural pectin, apparently, and the mixture doesn't get to the jelling point, as I recall from the recipe. It's really more of a thick sauce. A delicious one though. Goes superbly with certain cheeses, and nice on rustic bread. You could also use as a dessert sauce over ice cream.

I used less sugar, ditched the salt, and swapped champagne for the brandy. It had a nice flavor but was exceptionally sweet. It smelled so good. I might try it again with even less sugar.

I will make this again, because I never know what to do with ALL the figs that my tree produces. Mine are bright green on the outside with gorgeous pink flesh, and I don't know how the taste from them would be different than the black figs. I had to use orange brandy (eg: Grand Marnier)because I didn't have regular, and the orange is a nice foil against the fig. I also reduced the sugar to 2 1/2 cups, and it is still very sweet. The jam is a tad thin, but that could be the reduction in sugar.

WOW -- and I had to improvise: I had only two pounds of figs from the backyard that had to be turned into something immediately and one regular LIME as the fruit for this recipe. I cut all the ingredients in half, cut the soaking time to 20 min and hoped the lime would be good enough. The result is delicious, smooth as butter and I haven't mashed it yet. Why waste the energy? It won't be around long enough after I stop taste testing it myself and then share it with the neighbors. Next time I doubt that I'll risk using a lemon.

Only people I love are getting this gifted to them. It's amazing, just as written. I did use a tad less sugar, as my figs from my tree were sweet and ripe. Followed cooking directions and got a wonderful gourmet product for pennies to the dollar. By the way, I did half and got 4 jars of a thick lovely jam.

This was my first time canning and it turned out lovely. I delivered a few jars to friends. And, I have been serving my own in a variety of ways ... with cheeses, crackers, nuts and apples. Such a nice recipe.
