These were a staple in a poor household. And they are better now as an adult than as a kid. Crisp, smooth, salty, sweet, warm, cool. These have it all. The sprouts sound like a no-no to me. Eating fur with this doesn't seem right. But DO experiment with the fruit. My favorite is actually with pear - bosc or comice, but I have had this with peach, nectarines, mango. Berries not so much and melon doesn't work for me. I might try adding some marshmallow and making a fluffer-nutter supreme someday.

Throughout the 1980s my mother made these sandwiches -- with apple sauce as the 4th ingredient, no sprouts -- that she read of in a parenting magazine. They are called 'Special Sandwiches.' They freeze well (they would always go from the freezer to my lunchbox) & in my 30s, they are still a hit at all my parties!

I leave off the apple & sprouts and substitute tomato (a recipe I saw in Sunset years ago). Great flavors, and it's a perfect sandwich to take skiing - no refrigeration needed and provides plenty of energy (i.e. calories).

I omitted the sprouts and I absolutely loved it. It's fun to get people to try it out too.

Is this from the Elvis cookbook?

I'm giving this 4 forks because, if you omit the sprouts and the apple, you have my favorite sandwich! It's my favorite breakfast, but I (usually) only indulge on my birthday, as I figure its probably comparable to a Big Mac in fat calories. Peanut butter and crisp bacon on soft wheat bread - YUM!! Try it - heck, maybe this year I'll add an apple and see what happens, but then again, I could just have the sandwich and an apple for dessert....

Try this with breakfast links or sweet sausage!

This was mighty tasty.

It sounded like the flavors would be great, and worth the extra calories and fat. But it was really very bland and unsatisfying. We were disappointed and won't make it again. If you're gonna splurge, eat something tasty, like ice cream. But skip this.

I tried this one my kids...surprise! They enjoyed it. How son (4) pulled out the bacon and ate it separately while my daughter (6) ate his sprouts. Peanut butter and apple seem to blend beautifully. I like it too.

I know this recipe sounds odd, but my family has been making it for years (minus the sprouts) and it is delicious.
