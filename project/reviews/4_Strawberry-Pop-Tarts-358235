Delicious! Well worth the effort and you can make them in advance for company. I followed the recipe as written. Next time I will serve them with ice cream and fresh fruit. I think it would make a nice presentation to cut them in half the size. Rave reviews!!!!!

Wonderful! Just picked our strawberries yesterday, made preserves and used some in this recipe! Kids and adults raved about these mini-pies with vanilla ice cream! Also, rolled it to 12x12 and made more tarts.

As I was making these the first time I said "never again" beacause they were so much work but they were SO good. One week later and I am eating my words.

Probably redundant to rate an already noted outstanding recipe. But, they are so good. Crust is flaky and crisp. For any pastry with a jam filling, I reduce the jam by simmering it a few minutes. It doesn't usually leak and the taste is not affected at all. I thought the dough was a little thick, so rolled it 12" x 12" and cut 3"x4" rectangles making 12 tarts. They were perfect.

Wow! Sooooooooooo sinfully good. Made just as recipe indicated and they were awesome. Didn't quite get the dough thin enough and should have been more accurate with the quantity of the filling (and spreading thereof). Pretty and delicious!

These are wonderful. I used a food processor to make the dough and they came out very light and flakey. I will definitely make again and mix it up with different fillings.

Made pastry as listed - turned out flaky and delicious! Instead of powdered sugar, I spread a thin layer of royal icing to the top of each tart, then crumbled dehydrated strawberries on top to indicate that it was a strawberry tart. I will definitely be making these again. Thinking of mango butter with fresh mango slices, also cinnamon/brown sugar. Yum!!

GREAT recipe. I used grape jam too. Not the healthiest though.

These were so delicious. I made them two nights in a row because my friends wanted to come back for more! I used a bit less salt and a bit more sugar for the pastry, and made them into small triangles the second time as an experiment, since they seemed to fall apart a bit too easily as rectangles. Great either way, and I will definitely try other fruits next time. I also sprinkled them with raw sugar before baking instead of powdered sugar after.

I made these with farm fresh strawberry preserves and it came out great. Here's what I changed: -I made them smaller than the recipe called for, since I knew they would crumble easily and would be less messy if they were smaller. -I trimmed the edges of the dough after I put the second layer on. I then re-rolled this dough to make a few more pastries. -I plan to use slightly less salt and slightly more sugar next time. DELICIOUS! Will make double next time.

Made these with my 2 year grand daughter and they were fantastic! Have made several times since and they are a hit with the "Big Folks" too!

Yummy Used blueberries made into a compote for the filling. Pastry is flaky and wonderful tasting. Great take-off on an old childhood sweet.

I made these for a brunch and they're delicious! The pastry is perfect for this application. I will never make a whole pie again.

I have been looking for a pastry recipe to make prune danish. These delightful little pockets were perfect for a prune filling. Stewed the prunes with a little sugar, then pureed and used instead of fruit preserves. Just ate one with a cup of tea. Awesome. Crust is so flaky and tender. Cooked in 365 degree convection oven for 16 minutes and brushed with a touch of heavy cream for nice browning. This one is going on my blog!

I was in the kitchen within minutes of tearing the plastic off my Bon Appetit when I saw this recipe. Nevermind that it was 5:30 in the evening and I should have been thinking savory not snack. As a Poptart lover and a realist, I knew these weren't going to be a clone of the silver packaged treats- and thank goodness for that! I made strawberry, raspberry and quince and all three were terrific!

Excellent and made for a very beautiful Easter brunch treat. I added a bit more preserves and also made it with half whole wheat pastry flour. Yum!

These were great! I used black raspberry preserved instead of strawberry, and added a light glazing. For my glaze I mixed 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2 tsp milk and 1/8 tsp vanilla extract. Just mix these three ingredients together and drizzle quickly back and forth over all the pastries. Next time I think I will try blackberry preserves or something with maple syrup.

Very Good. Much better than the regular store bought pop tarts but tasted more like a pie crust with fruit filling. I would add more filling than the recipe calls for, maybe another tsp.

Delicious, like the idea of freezing them and baking only how many you need. I did half a recipe and got four 4x4 tarts.
