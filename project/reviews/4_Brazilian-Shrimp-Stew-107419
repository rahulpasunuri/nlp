I loved this recipe and made it for my husband who said it was better than anything he ate in Brazil. I took that as quite a compliment, because I thought the food in Brazil was rather delicious.

Excellent! Simple. Ingredients easy to get. Didn't do the palm oil, because it's like injecting cholesterol into my veins. But this is just FAB!!! And SO EASY!!

This is an awesome dish! I've made it about 10 times this year. It's great for dinner parties. I follow the recipe quite closely except, there's no dende oil, and I substitute the lemon juice with 1/8 cup of fresh squeezed lime juice and some lime zest. It's always a winner!

Loved it! I used less shrimp, more coconut milk. I cut hot pepper by half and it was still too spicy (i dont like spicy food). The rest was as in recipe. Delicious!

I was not at all impressed with this recipe. I strained out the marinade before cooking the shrimp and they were still too lemony. Any good shrimp creole recipe is better than what I found here.

Rating: 3
Quick and quite yummy. Used half the shrimp and doubled the tomato coconut sauce, which I would recommend because I like a high sauce to meat ratio. Next time, I would sweat the onion and bell pepper for longer to get a nice browning going. There's not a whole lot of depth to the sauce but it's still quite good.

I made this tonight nearly as described (added some sea scallops) and it was really delicious! I had dende oil at home, which I bought last year in Rio, but I'm sure this is also great without it.

I search to find an easy, quick winter recipe. This was all these and honestly just fantastic. Had a table of 10 guest and had never made it before. It was delightful. I didn't use any lemon juice and doubled the recipe. I used brown rice. Easy on the cayenne for your guests.

I had two substitutions: used tomatoe sauce instead of stewed tomatoes, (way too strong, needed alot less)& limes instead of lemons (again way too strong). To cut dwm on the acidity, I rinsed out a lot of sauce(used colander) then added a single serving sz of applesauce w/mango and peaches and a quarter of a stick of unsalted butter. let it sit for a day and it was heavenly! I will make sure I have the correct ingredients next time.

Made w/o palm oil and delicious. I also have doubled the recipe and added chicken. I marinated the chicken for 30 min. just liek the shrimp, sauteed in a pan and then added it at the end when you mix in the shrimp.

Fabulous! This was really delicious. I could not find the palm oil as many others have not, but subbed a tbsp of peanut oil for additional flavor, although, I'm not sure it added anything. I think this would have been delicious regardless. This recipe will be kept!

One more thing... it serves 2 adults and 2 little kids as a main course. There are never any leftovers.

Exceptional- a new favorite. I've made it with and without the oil. I don't think the oil adds that much flavor and is very expensive, so go ahead and skip it (though they do have it at Whole Foods if you really want to try it). Otherwise, I've made it successfully with yellow peppers (when I didn't have a green on on hand)and I've omitted the cayenne when guests who don't like spicy food joined us - all to rave reviews. I think this might be my favorite epicurious find of all time.

the reviews sounded so good! Granted, i didnt try it with the palm oil, but i thought it was just ordinary....way too lemony for my taste....

Thought this dish was wonderful!! I made a small modification as suggested by another reviewer and used canned petite diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato puree....it was perfect, and so much easier. Loved the heat and fresh flavors in this dish. Next time I think I will use limes instead of lemons for marinating the shrimp. The palm oil turned me off at first taste, but once in the dish, it provided just a hint of a 'secret ingredient' that gave this dish a little something extra. Also added, just a pinch of sugar as it tasted just a tad bit sharp. Overall...Loved it!

Served this stew for my husband and 18 year old son on a Friday night to rave reviews. They both fought for the leftovers during the weekend. Monday night I asked my son what he would like for dinner--he requested the stew again--I complied. It is so easy and I now had all ther ingredients on hand( ordered the oil online-important)

Rating: 4
Fab. Few modifications. Doesn't need it. Since you blend the tomatoes it doesn't much matter if you buy diced or whole. We got the inexpensive dende oil in a Brazilian food store a few towns away. Great to serve w/ crusty bread for soaking up the delish sauce.

This is good, but not as good as the recipe for Brazilian Seafood Stew. Both are similiar, but the Seafood Stew is tastier!

This recipe was good. I enjoyed it but my friend did not like it so much (although he cleaned his plate...). I made it as written, but I put the shrimp in and left it sitting on the stove for a while. Bad idea. The shrimp was overcooked and rubbery. Next time I will make sure to add the shrimp right before serving!

We could eat this every week!!! My family loved it just as it is without any modifications other than using the whole can of coconut milk (Trader Joes has the best!) I served it with Jasmine rice and crusty french bread.

This is a good moqueca recipe, but you have to add azeite de dendê to get the real flavor. You can buy it online at www.sendexnet.com which is a Brazilian store that delivers across the U.S. But you have to search for the name in Portuguese, since Palm Oil won't do it.

This dish was fabulous! I couldn't find the dende oil, but it was delish all the same (I also added extra cilantro). My guests raved about it - I added some coconut milk to the rice while it steamed, so it had a lovely tropical flavor to go with the stew.

Great for brunch with the goddesses. Very easy to prepare. Did not change recipe at all (except no dende oil -- I read that peanut oil is a substitue, but forgot to add/try). Huge flavor quotient. Need a cool side dish/salad to balance the the cayenne's kick , e.g., simple avocado salad with little tomato,heart of palm, and spring onion. For wine... served with a Malbec, my current favorite.

Also someone else mentioned the movie "Women on top" it went great with the movie i think they even used a very similer recipe in the movie and I played brazilan music. My boyfriend loves brazil and loved the whole evening I dont think I would have picked this without all of its grreat reviews!!!

We've made this several times and love it. To the cook from Wayside, NJ, I found the dende oil! It is on Third Avenue in Long Branch, just off Broadway, at a little brazilian market diagonally across from the Post Office. A little bottle cost $1.40. The last time we made this was around Christmas time and had some friends over. It is easy to serve when entertaining, you can have the stew ready, enjoy your geusts, and toss the shrimp in right before you eat. It makes a pretty presentation, we use big white bowls, put cooked rice in a measuring cup, and turn it over to create a "rice tower". Then we put the shrimp & stew around it. The red and green colors of the stew were especially pretty with the red and green table setting. I agree with a previous reviewer, don't bother putting the tomatoes in the blender. I buy the petit cut, or fresh cut tomatoes and just put them in. They are about the same size as the diced green peppers.

Rating: 4
Amazing! I wish I found the palm oil, because I honestly can't imagine how this could taste any more delicious. I will make it again and again with or without the palm oil. I served it over jasmine rice and it was tremendous. It's such an impressive dish and simple to make. I love it with shrimp, but am sure it would be just as delicious with any other white fish.

Excellent dish, though I admit I haven't used the palm oil.

ATTENTION ALL WHO VENTURE THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE: This dish is amazing, but it is really not the same without the palm or dende oil. Belive me, I've made it without it. It's like making gumbo without the roux. The use of the dende/palm oil truly honors the dish. If you don't have any Brazilian or West African markets in your area (though if there are regional restaurants, you could ask them where they purchase their oil), do take the time to order from Kalustyan's (800-352-3451). It's a great spice store based in New York that ships orders all over the world. I promise Foodies: the palm oil makes ALL the difference!

We made this dish without the Palm Oil . . .The heat from the cayenne was just perfect. The coconut milk gave the sauce a smooth, soothing taste. We love cilantro, so we added extra. The colors were brilliant. Served with a Pinot Grigio, we will definitely make it again.

I was in a gourmet store last week and asked about palm oil. The chef in residence said that stores don't carry it because it is extremely high in saturated fat. He recommended avocado oil. He said it would add a very similar flavor to palm oil. I haven't tried it yet but I will.

Even though I couldn't find dende in my local grocery store, this was still very tasty. Both DH and DD inhaled it, and DH ate leftovers for breakfast the next day! I've lived in Brazil and this is a very authentic recipe. The dende (when I can find it) will give it a very distinctive flavor.

This recipe is great! I too didn't have the dende oil,didn't puree the tomoates, used low fat coconut oil and substituted lime for lemon. I also cut down the olive oil to less than a tablespoon I served it with whole wheat couscous that I had steeped in the broth I made from the shrimp shells. This one is a keeper!

This was a major hit. The entire apartment building loved this dish. I also was not able to get the dende oil, so I went without it. I did see that annato oil can be substituted for dende oil but could not find that as well. I do have a bottle of dende ordered though, as I would really like to see how the complexity of the dish changes with it. This wll be made again and again.

A WONDERFUL new way to prepare shrimp- this is a total keeper. It almost has a Thai taste to it because of the coconut milk. I wasnt able to find the palm oil & cant imagine what that would have added to this as it was great just the way it is. I also used the lite coconut milk & it was super. Served it over jasmine rice & it was just perfect. Also added another 1/4 tsp of spice to give it some kick- PERFECT!!!!

I have made this dish twice and each time it came out great. I, too, omitted the palm oil, because I couldn't find it at any of the stores near me. Next time I will take some of the other reviewers' advice and try lime instead of lemon. Sounds yummy!

I have made this twice. The first time I used lime instead of lemon and didn't blend the tomatoes. It was great. The second time I followed the recipe as written which was still good, but not as good as the first time. I love coconut milk and the first time it retained more of the coconut milk flavor. I have another Brazilian fish stew recipe that does call for mild white fish, which I think would work great in this recipe too.

Rating: 4
DELICIOUS! I was nervous about tomato and coconut flavors in the same dish, but this was incredible. I didn't puree the can of tomatoes and I liked the chunks becuase they were the same size as what my husband cut the onions to be. I bet this sauce would work with any mild white fish, and I wonder what lime instead of lemon would do since lime and coconut are married in Thai cuisine. Will definitely make this again - and did I mention how pretty it is (we have black plates and it looked awesome!)

Very tasty and different. Made sans cilantro. Husband loved it. Not so much a stew as a stir- fry with ample sauce (or maybe I simmered too briskly). Served over rice with THAI-STYLE CABBAGE SALAD.

I looked forward to this after reading these great reviews, but frankly found it just too one dimensional in flavour - the cayenne just overwhelms it, the addition of coconut is wonderful with fish but better perhaps as a curry base or chili, not cayenne..

My husband and I loved this. I added extra cayenne pepper as we both love spice. I did not have the oil so I left that out. The second time I made it I doubled the recipe and the two of us finished in 2 meals. This is one of the best recipes I've run across on this site.

This is so wonderful...I can't wait to make it again. I did an internet search on Brazilian food and found several recipes that were similar...so I combined them. I added four chopped and seeded tomatoes..chili flakes...fresh ginger...garlic..and chili oil...since I had no Dende...and lots of cilantro...plus some Tilapia (fish) and of course the shrimp. Dende is a simi-solid orange palm oil so using toasted sesame oil is totally wrong. Just use a chili oil or simply a vegetable oil. I used the chili oil...like it spicy...and it was great. Plus lots of fresh lime juice!

Rating: 3
This was a very good dish. Marinating the shrimp really gave them a lot of inidividual flavor, even after they'd been covered in sauce. I used 1/4 tsp of sesame oil instead of the palm as had been suggested by other cooks and wished I hadn't. I had been taste tasting it all along the process and I think it was much better without.

Rating: 4
The key to this dish, without doubt, is taking the time to blend the clumps out of the coconut milk. Small thing but essential. I used 16-21 Key West shrimp, 8 the serving over white & wild rice made with low sodium chix broth ipo water. Served with mixed field greens/walnut vinaigrette salad and started with chilled roasted eggplant soup garnished with crumbled feta. The Brazilian shrimp are a 100% do-again.

This dish is fantastic! Wonderful taste and extremely easy to make. I didn't have the dende oil and will try including that that next time -- although I can't believe it could taste any better. It definitely doesn't serve 6 though -- more like 4 -- and leaves everyone wanting more.

WOW, What a great dish! Served it over basmati rice and all my husband kept saying as he ate it was WOW. My son and his girlfriend who had already eaten dinner out came home and ate half the pot. Now mind you I doubled the recipe and between the four of us there wasn't anything left. Guess I'll have to make a triple batch next time. Oh darn! The only thing I did change was instead of green bell peppers I used red. I didn't have the brazilian oil so I took the advise of another cook and used toasted sesame oil. Yum,Yum,Yum!!!

If you make the dish without the oil, it´s then calle "ensopado". I"d like to inform that there is 2 types of "moquecas" in Brazil. The wonderful ones, from Bahia, my homeland, and the good ones, from Espírito Santo, called "moqueca capixaba". If you happen to go to Salvador, Bahia, make yoursef a big favor and go to a restaurant called "Yemanjá", and you'll taste the best "moqueca" or "ensopado" EVER . The locals and tourists go there. It's only a good advice, I'm not a partner or anything like that

This was great. I also use light coconut milk which came in a 14 oz can so I used the rest of it in the rice and it was amazing. The market ran out of shrimp so I added some fish fillets which came out great. I omitted the palm oil and still loved it.

Like the cook before me, I didn't add the palm oil. It just didn't seem worth buying something so perishable for one tablespoon. I guess it was needed to make this dish 'sing' because it really didn't make much noise on its own, considering the number of ingredients and time necessary to complete.

A very flavorful and easy to make stew. I skipped the palm oil at the end, but still the stew came out very good. Will be making it often.
