Pretty easy but boring; not a rich vanilla taste.

This was my first attempt at creme anglaise and it was a triumph! I had a number of left over egg yolks to use, and this fit the bill deliciously. I should note that I was going to use all heavy cream, as I had it in the house, but did not have enough. I wound up using about 3/4 skim milk and the remainder heavy cream. It was still sublime! I did follow another reviewer's advice and tempered the egg yolks.

A slightly difficult recipe to pull off following these instructions. Heat the half and half and then pour a little into the egg mixture to heat up the eggs, do this very slowly with small incriments of half and half, that way the eggs don't cook when you pour the eggs in with the rest of the half and half. DO NOT LET THEM BOIL! I made scrambled eggs the first time and was not very happy. After looking up a video on youtube though, it was pretty easy to make. Delicious!

All that half and half sounded just too rich, so I used 2% milk with a splash of cream. I increased the vanilla and added a bit extra sugar. This worked nicely with bread pudding and would probably be good with just about anything sweet.S

I used this recipe for a desert and was most pleasantly surprised. It is the perfect sauce to accompany most desert dishes.
