What an easy way to have homemade chicken wings. I only made the hot sauce. It was delicious. I omitted the cayenne. I also omitted the oil on the wings. They still crisped up wonderfully. These are every bit as good as fried wings. The long cooking time is necessary to give them the crispness.

This review is only encompasses the chicken preparation. I did not use either sauce, though hope to try them later. While nothing can beat fried chicken wings with Buffalo Sauce, this is a very laudable healthier option. We cooked as directed and they crisped up nicely. Since time was short, we just used Texas Pete's to toss them in, and served with celery sticks and a light-version blue cheese dressing. The end result was very good.

quite good! i went with the buffalo sauce. Spice hound here. i liked these pretty well but I think I will still always fall back on my favorite Old Bay Buffalo wings. That spice just does wonders. Here's the recipe I use. http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2012/07/summer-gets-spicy-old-bay-chicken-wings.html Enjoy!

neither of the sauces blew me away, but good.

Very good and easy for a group. I especially liked it that you can make the sauces in advance. We had enough left for another meal and they reheated nicely in the microwave.

Crispy and gives you a choice of what you want to make, mild ginger to spicy buffalo, and turned out great, defiantly going to make these again!

I'm from Buffalo so I know my wings, and this recipe brought me very close to it. Double the sauce and 15 minutes before done, brush both sides of wings and turn up temp to 475 to nicely crisp the wings, leaving enough sauce for those who like to dip for more. I tried brining, but I don't think it made much difference.

I baked the chicken the night before - make certain you follow the directions and use a rack to keep the chicken out of the oil and fat while baking - then the next day I brushed on the buffalo sauce and baked for 12 minutes at 400 degrees. These are the best wings ever!

Everything you could ask for in a wing. You won't mind that they're not fried. I preferred the ginger soy glaze dipped in a yogurt remoulade.

Good. Not great. But simple. Followed recipe exactly.

I went the very lazy route of no sauce and baking them on a bare cookie sheet. Very tasty!!! Moist, crisp and delicious!

I made the buffalo sauce version only. This was a big hit even with my 15 and 11 year old girls! Very easy!

Four forks because the outcome was quite exceptional for a healthier version of chicken wings, particularly if you went with the buffalo sauce - 1 tbsp of butter, not a 1/2 cup or more that is often called for and it was very tasty.

My ten year old son loves fried chicken wings as he is partial to the crispy skin. This recipe allows me to keep from having to bring out my deep fryer, using two quarts of oil and dealing with the mess upon cleanup. The results are nearly the same -- just as crisp and even it bit lighter.

Oh! Almost forgot... I marinated the wings overnight in a garlic paste borrowed from "Thai-style broiled chicken wings" (on this site) which added a little bit more flavour to the dry wings. Don't bother with the sauce from that recipe though- least favourite.

A hit!! I didn't have wire racks, so I did them on parchment and drained the fat with a turkey baster to keep them crispy and less greasy. I did a third each with the sauces and the rest just with sea salt and pepper. The perfect trio of hot, sweet and dry.

The wings turned out great, nice and crispy! It was my first time making wings at home, so I followed the recipe exactly. I made both sauces, and although the spicy one tastes good, there wasn't enough for lots of wings. I will make more sauce next time. The soy ginger sauce was okay, my husband liked it but I guess I was expecting something different. Either way, the wings are awesome!

This was really good. I clipped the tips off, but decided to leave the drummettes and flats attached. They look like little valentine hearts. Instead of tossing them in the soy sauce, I brushed the wings like I do with any barbecue sauce.
