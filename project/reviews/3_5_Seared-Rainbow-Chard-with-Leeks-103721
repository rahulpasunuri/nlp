great guidance on how to do chard. I rendered the fat from smoky bacon ends (thank you Paula) to saute the stems. I added shallots instead of leeks. Otherwise keep calm and carry on!

absolutely excellent and extremely quick & simple to make. the stated 25 minutes is a stretch, took more like 15. yum!

This was surprisingly delicious given its simplicity. I also only added 1 tbsp butter but it was lovely and so tasty on top of brown rice. This is definitely a keeper!

This is a nice side dish with pretty colors. It could have used a little something extra for flavor. Will try a squeeze of lemon next time as others have suggested.

I made this with onions instead of leaks and served it over brown rice, and it was delicious and pretty! Will try it again with leeks.

I love leafy greens, and this recipe is truly great. Esp pretty if made with rainbow chard. Like many of the suggestions, I used a little more olive oil and just 1 tbsp butter for aroma.

Simple, eye pleasing, and delicious. I omitted the butter, and could definitely see the advantage of pine nuts or pecans.

Excellent recipe. Halved it and think it would be marvelous with some ground lamb with Persian seasonings (cooked ahead) dropped in.

A great use for chard. I also omitted the butter and added toasted pine nuts. Delicious by itself or as a side dish.

I have never had chard before. This recipe was easy and delicious. I would reduce the butter next time. I like the idea of pine nuts. I thought the texture was really awesome.

I made this with onion instead of leek but do feel that it could do with more flavor. Next time I will use some of the suggestions other reviwers used like the garlic or toasted almonds. It was good but could be a tad bit more interesting.

Didn't have leeks, used half a Vidalia onion I had on hand sliced thinly. Was deliscious! Will use less butter next time.

I substituted sun-dried tomato oil for the butter and then added the tomatoes chopped to the chard and leeks. It worked well.

This recipe is simple but has a nice presentation. And it's delicious with only half of the butter. It's good on a weeknight and as a side dish for an elegant dinner. I like to cook this when rainbow chard and leeks are available at our local farmer's market.

I agree that the butter makes it too rich. After reading reviews I cut down the amount, but next time I would leave it out all together. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and a clove of garlic. I plan to make this often as a quick weeknight side dish.

I added 1-1/2 T sugar to the greens while cooking to help caramelize and threw in a generous handful of toasted pecan pieces at the last minute - it was a hit!

This was wonderful. A couple of things to add, though. I would definitely sautee a couple of cloves of garlic in the beginning with the oil before you add the leeks. I needed more than 3-5min in the last part. I would also recommend toasting some pine nuts in the end and tossing them into your finished product. This is a beautiful and tasty dish!

Very nice. While the earlier reviewer's suggestion of olives is a good one, they made this recipe "stand out" a bit too much against the main course. Just a note. Also agree with others that the butter content is a bit heavy.

I grow chard in my garden, and this is a great use for it. Tonight, I added some fresh fennel and celery to the recipe. onion would also be a great addition. I also add minced garlic. You can cut down on the oil by just sauteeing the leeks, then adding a dash of water to wilt the chard.

This is one of our favorites. Try adding some feta cheese and a few greek olives just at the end!

You can't go wrong with this great tasting, visually appealing dish. Excellent base recipe from which to add your personal touch. Try adding Shitake mushrooms, a tablespoon of your favorite mustard and a squeeze of lemon to turn this into a four-forker!

This is the perfect side to add a splash of color to a plate. I made it to go with Balsamic and Dijon Glazed Ham and it was delicious!

What a great way to use chard. We add a couple of squeezes of lemon to finsih it off.

I thought this recipe was great (my first time to make a dish with chard), though next time I will probably omit the butter and just substitute more olive oil -- the chard really absorbed the butter flavor, which tasted too rich for me.

I'd never had chard before, this was a very simple and tasty introduction! I am going to try some of the more elaborate recipes now, and will make this again. I used a cast-iron french oven instead of a skillet, it held the chard better while it cooked down.

This was an unexpected delight! I made it exactly as directed, and it was as good tasting as it was colorful. The mellow sweetness of the leek played very well off the mild taste of the chard. This is a good looking winner that might even entice kids (of all ages) to eat vegetables!

My husband would eat greens all day if he could - chard over all! He wolfed this down. I added 2 gloves minced garlic - major hit...
