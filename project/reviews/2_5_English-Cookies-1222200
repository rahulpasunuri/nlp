I've already made these cookies twice- once with pecans and once with hazelnuts. My husbands loves a not-too-sweet treat so these are perfect for him, and they are small enough to let me eat a few without feeling guilty. If you want something over the top, these are not the cookies for you.

My husband and co-workers loved these cookies and begged for more. I subbed pecans and used good quality chocolate. I also only used 1 Tablespoon of milk instead of 2. They did require a few minutes more to cook then listed. Be careful not to over cook though. I baked until they were just set and very slightly brown around the edges. The result was a cookie that was crisp on the outside but still soft and chewy in the center.

I would give this zero forks if I could. It says that one fork is "just so-so" but there is no opportunity to show that I think this recipe is really bad. Even my boyfriend didn't like them.

These cookies are GROSS! They taste like baking soda and flour. What a waste of ingredients. We threw them away. These are an insult to the British.

This was disappointing-nothing special. I found them too sweet, and they took a lot longer to bake than 7-8 minutes, even though I made them smaller. There are better cookie recipes out there.

We love these cookies! My husband raved about them. I have already made a 2nd. batch. (since we gave a few to a friend)
