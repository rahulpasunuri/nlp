I, too, greatly missed Dar Maghreb's amazing B'stilla. I decided this recipe seemed the closest, but made the mistake of utilizing reviewers' recommendations before trying the original recipe. I doubled the almond/sugar mixture -- eww!! TOO sweet! The sweetness should be hinted at, not smack you in the face. And I used only 2 eggs -- which made the filling rather dry. So today I tried again. I used the 3 eggs and recipe's amount of almond sugar. Both times I made a big pie instead of individual ones. I cooked it in a deep-dish glass pie plate at $350 for 30 minutes, until well browned. Flipped it onto a plate, dusted it with powdered sugar (as I remember it ), and tossed a few toasted almond slivers on it. Bravo! Really great recipe!

..ps -- you can make these up, wrap them carefully in paper towels and keep them in the fridge overnight if you are making a big meal and don't have time to put them together the day of the dinner. Works fine.

I've been making this for special occasions for since, well, 1994. One of my favorite recipes ever. This is the real deal. There are other b'stilla recipes out there and they are pallid imitations. It's one of the most delicious and impressive dishes I've ever made, and I often use these to start a meal at a party celebrating something and follow with a butterflied leg of lamb roasted with Moroccan spices and flavorings and the usual couscous and vegetables. It never fails to get utter raves. Yes, it's a lot of work -- that's why it's so much fun!!!

I first tried b'stilla in Marrakesh and loved it since the first bite. This recipe is well worth all the time it takes to make it. My boyfriend is Moroccan and was very impressed with it. This recipe is a keeper for me!

An important step is missing. When making the Ras el Hanout, the spices should be roasted/toasted, before grinding.

Made this almost exactly as written ( just made them appetizer side & cut the butter with half olive oil). Took them to a New Year's Eve party & folks couldn't get enough. So delicious - this ras el hangout recipe is hands down the best on this site.

to Pittsburgh cook: "To make the ras el hanout: In a spice grinder or cleaned coffee grinder GRIND FINE aniseed, fennel seeds, allspice berries, cardamom seeds, cloves, peppercorns, cinnamon stick, sesame seeds, coriander seeds, cuminseed, and red pepper flakes..."

A question: do I understand correctly that you do not remove the whole spices from the final filling?

We have fond memories of Dar Maghreb in LA-- this recipe revives them. I make an APPETIZER version: commercially available phyllo cups are filled with the chicken-egg filling and sprinkled with almonds. Bake 400 for 10-15 min. YUM!

Pretty tasty! I used only 2 eggs and doubled the amount of ras el hanout, as recommended by other reviewers. I was making this ahead of time for a supper club, so I layered the individual pies with parchment paper and froze in large freezer bags. Supper club was canceled, but a month later I took them out and they baked up great! Crispy and flaky on the outside and moist and juicy chunks of meat on the inside. Yum! See my pictures of the b'stillas at http://apricosa.blogspot.com

Like many other reviewers, I made this as one big pie. It was absolutely delicious and even better the second day. I served it with sauteed summer squash and zucchini on the side.

I first tried this dish in the south of France and was startled by the combination of sweet and savory. I stumbled across it again in SF and finally had a name for the dish. This recipe is elaborate, but the results are well worth it. I made it for a birthday party and cut the finished pastries in half so everyone could try it. Having fresh spices will make a world of difference in your finished dish, so make sure yours are not older than 6 months! I even had chicken left over and will probably make a casserole of some sort with it. Will make this again for a future feast--beautiful presentation and quite tasty.

Yes, cut it lengthwise; the wrapping works out well. The 1/3cup of filling fills each pastry well. They were excellent

Rating: 0
can anyone tell me if you really cut the phyllo lengthwise? Or do they mean crosswise? Lengthwise would appear to be very narrow and would result in a lot of phyllo wrapping.

Followed recipe exactly and it came out delicious. It was very time consuming, but worth it because I am a big b'stilla fan. Would also be worth it for company.

Delicious! My husband lived in Morocco for 2 years, and is always a little skeptical of "Americanized" Moroccan food (anything with pork in it, or paired with wine is a dead give away!). But he loved this b'stilla & said it was just right. I made one large b'stilla, instead of individual ones (a little less labor intensive that way!). I also used the other recipe on epicurious for the ras el hanout (found under Turkey B'stilla), simply because I had those ingredients on hand, and it seemed a little less complex. I accidentally added all of the spice mix (rather than just 2 teaspoons), but it turned out great! I also skipped the saffron, because I didn't have any, and it was very flavorful. Next time, I would add raisins to the filling, and add more layers of phyllo- maybe about 6 or 7. I highly recommend this recipe! ps. Some other reviews mentioned serving the B'stillas on a bed of rice. For a more traditional version, I would serve couscous with roasted vegetables (such as squash, carrots & onions) on the side! Yum.

I've made this a few times, Frankensteining a couple of recipies together to make it a little simpler. Firstly, I don't make the almond sugar. Secondly, one large split, skinless chicken breast is plenty (like 1.3 lbs), and only two eggs. If I happen to have preserved lemon in the fridge, I finely chop that into the onion mixture instead of the lemon juice. Otherwise, the recipe basically stays the same and gets baked in a 9" square pan. I layer about 8 sheets on the bottom, letting the edges hang off the sides, put the onion custard on the bottom, with the shredded chicken, parsley and cilantro on top. I butter and fold all the edges in over it, spread a layer of toasted coarsely chopped almonds on top of that, then add a few more phyllo layers. The very top gets some finely chopped almonds and a sprinkle of granulated sugar, which melts nicely into a crispy glaze when baked. I've had people love this dish, but flip out at the sight of confectioner's sugar. This way, they get that hint of sweetness without really seeing it! Labor intensive but worth it.

Wonderfully different and delicious. Prepared spice mixture and cooked chicken day before due to previous complaints as being time/labor intensive. This is great as an appetizer due to sweet and savory. Chicken filling needs a bit more crunch, will add coursley chopped almonds to filling. Also liked previous reviewers comments of serving over rice. Next time, I'll do a rice flavored with cinnamon and toasted almond slivers to incorporate the recipes flavors. Reduce chicken cooking sauce by adding roux and serve chicken/sauce on top of rice for a savory dinner.

I made changes... so bear with me. I was catering a party of 80-100 people and wanted to make finger food out of these. I have limited availabity of ingrediants in Hawaii, and was also on a budget, so I made my own phlyo cups in mini-muffin tins. I used olive oil for the phylo and I think that butter would be a bit richer, but the oil was easier! When the cups where done, I sprinkled aprox. 1/2 teaspoon of the almond sugar in the bottom, then a spoon full of the chicken filling. Baked till golden then froze for the party. Went straigt from freezer to oven, 350 for around 7-10 minutes, then dusted with powdered sugar. HUGE hit with the men. Will definately be making them as pies for smaller crowds. Not so much work, once you get your rythym down. Tasted just like our Moroccan restuarant.

This was terrific! It was a bit labor intensive to make everything for the first time, but having the spice mix and suger mix on hand will save time in the future. Anyway, it was worth the work. I loved the flavors; complex but definitely not overwhelming. Will definitely make this again.

I made this last night and it was very authentic! I agree with the cooks that doubled the almond sugar. You definitely need more almond sugar than the recipe suggests. Also, next time I will use two eggs instead of three. The final product was a little more "eggy" than normal. This one is definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe several years ago for a party of 25 I was catering. I was very pleased with the results, even though the phyllo dough was time consuming. I was asked to do a dinner for the same group again this year, and was reminded by one person how good this recipe was.

I will rank the difficulty at medium. I did not think that this recipe is that labor intensive. The flavor was interesting and delicious at the same time. I actually made it into one big pie instead of the individual packages which might have saved me some work. I agreed with other viewers that the almond sugar mixture can be doubled. I used slivered almond and just crushed up with my hand and worked really well in the pie. I can't wait to make it again.

And how, is this alot of work-think I may have had more chicken than called for, resulting in less flavorful filling. Definitely need to increase the almond sugar.

I've gone through the whole gamut twice now, exactly as the recipe says. I would never skip the phyllo, although it is true that the filling is fabulous and subtle and not like anything else in the world. I also was bowled over by the ras al hanout and will always keep a jar around. Great stuff. This is one of the best dishes I have ever made. As for the work, well, yeah, but...gee....I ENJOY cooking! And making these is tremendous fun.

i haven't made this in a few years since i have been busy having & raising babies. However, this is the single greatest dish i have made! I am quite a prolific cook & this outshines all. Made it exactly as written. It melts in your mouth. Too bad it is so labor intensive. Be sure, when the kiddies are less time consuming I will run to the kitchen to make this delicacy again

the list of ingredients is daunting, but the results are delicious. I used over rice because I didn't want to use phyllo dough. It would also be good in wonton ravioli's.

B'stillas are made with pigeon in Morocco and are considered a delicacy. To make them more authentic, I grind toasted almonds and put them in the price mixture. If it seems too dry, add some cream to the filling. You want it moist, but with no liquid runoff. I make the filling the day before and assemble the next day. You can freeze them with no problems. I also omit the sugar almond topping and replace it with a more authentic shake of powdered sugar just before serving. That is a lot less complicated and better.

This recipe is fairly time intensive, so prepare accordingly. But, it was absolutely delicious. I used puff pastry dough, which made them turn out a bit more like empanadas, rather than the flaky filo. It was easier to prepare the second time because I had saved the almond sugar and spice mixture.

Rating: 2
Yikes! What a job. It was good, but for the effort, it should have been outstanding. One tip that made it a lot less labor-intensive--I used prepared filo cups and served these as finger food for a party. I did love the ras el hanout and the almond sugar. I'll incorporate them into other recipes. As far as making these pies again, don't think so.

Good b'stilla. The almond sugar quantities given are only half of the required amount, though (you need 18 tbsp). I used olive oil on the phyllo instead of butter. It's healthier and actually easier to brush on. When placing the almond sugar and chicken mixture onto the phyllo, shift it towards the middle by 4 inches or so, so that you can fold the short end of the phyllo over top, and then roll everything up. It's easier to roll that way.

This recipe is wonderful. First I recommend getting yourself to a Moroccan restaurant and trying an authentic b'stilla. The reason I say that is that the dish can be a strange flavor to some. But if you already know that you love b'stillas, this dish is the real thing. It came out perfectly.
