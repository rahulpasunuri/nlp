Quite tasty and amazingly quick to whip up. Guests were impressed by what is essentially store-bought slices topped with tomato and drizzled over with oil and spices. No work! However, a tad too simple to be an amazing dish and smoked salmon is a little too expensive for it to be a default party dish.

Very good and fast - I will make this over and over again for company.
