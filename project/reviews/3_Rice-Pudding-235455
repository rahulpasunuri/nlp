Three forks only if you reduce the sugar and rosewater. Do it to taste. I also made a vegan version, using Silk coconut milk (not real coconut milk, as I was sick and needed a light dish) and vanilla bean. It was delicious topped with tropical fruit salad.

So sweet!! Too sweet I think. I'd cut the sugar by a lot but am not sure what that would do to the overall consistency.

The consistency was silky smooth and creamy, but the Rose Water amount was a little overpowering. I do think that a teaspoon instead of a tablespoon would be preferable, and I shall try this reduction next time. I did not add the almonds simply because I prefer fewer textures in most dishes. I'm sure they add a nice flavor, however. If one does not have Rose Water, I'm sure that vanilla extract would be a good substitution, even though you wouldn't get the "exotic" flavor provided by the Rose Water. Otherwise, this is a recipe I will make again, albeit with less Rose Water of course.

Gorgeous texture on this pudding without eggs. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and added 1/4 cup of golden raisins and 1/4 cup of dried lychees. And I used short grain brown rice. It was delicious. Only thing to watch out for is to make sure the rice is quite tender before pouring in the milk mixture. 10 minutes was not enough for brown rice.

WAY TOO MUCH SUGAR! Reduce and add to taste!

i used only 1/2 c.sugar and it was still too sweet. compared to other pudding recipes, the quantity of sugar is off the charts.

I made this dish exactly as written as part of a tasting of Egyptian foods for 4th graders. When I make it again, I will cut the sugar at least in half - it was so sweet I couldn't finish my portion. Perhaps people in Egypt enjoy sweeter desserts than those from the USA. It had great consistancy.

This would be a great rice pudding with far less sugar. It was too sweet for my taste and my guests agreed. I will try to make it again using just one cup of sugar because the consistency was just right.
