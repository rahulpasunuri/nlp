This is one of my favorite easy weeknight dinners, and I crave it quite often. Best with the long style fusilli, and I always add the juice of the lemon I've zested into the recipe. We often serve with fresh lemon wedges, because we love the lemon with the goat cheese and asparagus.

Easy and quick but not great tasting. Ok.

Very yummy! I used 1/2 of the pasta (used whole wheat pasta). I didn't have tarragon so I used fresh basil. I doubled the goat cheese. I also used a blood orange infused olive oil which was beautiful with the dish. Very simple and delicious : )

This didn't quite work. It was dry and not flavorful.

I agree with the other reviewers that tweaking this a bit makes a difference in the flavor. I've made it twice and it has been well received, others want the recipe. I have decreased the pasta by 1 cup, (otherwise not enough asparagus to pasta) increased the asparagus by half, and have done the same with the goat cheese too. I put very little, if any pasta water to this. Salt and pepper at the end is a must as well, I find.

This was good, though I think I would even use more goat cheese next time.

As with most recipes, it's all about your personal touch. I don't think I've ever followed any recipe to the "t" but with just a quick few little tweaks, this one turns out amazing. I usually add some barbecued chicken breasts (marinaded in a citrus marinade)to make this a one dish meal. I have had rave reviews and this is my go-to dish for when I have casual company. Usually all it takes is a bit more salt or lemon juice and some more goat cheese and it's got tons of flavour. Don't dismiss this recipe because of some bad reviews. It's got a lot of potential, it's a great base recipe and is great for anybody who knows how to fix up a dish. Btw, dried tarragon has way more flavour than fresh and I can never find fresh in our local grocery stores anyway.

STAY AWAYYYY!!! This recipe lacks taste. I added the sun-dried tomatoes and the herb goat cheese. It did nothing for it. What a waste of food and time:(

Should have read the reviews before I prepared this. It was BLAND. Even good goat cheese and fresh-from-the-garden tarragon couldn't elevated it beyond OK.

Locally-grown asparagus is just hitting our markets. I bought some last week, and made this recipe that evening. It was simple, elegant, and delicious! I used penne instead of fusilli, and only had dried tarragon, but I made no additions to the recipe. Fabulous, and it is now in my asparagus rotation!

I sauteed the asparagus in some olive oil, adding garlic at the end. I cooled this mixture off a bit before adding the cooked pasta, lemon peel, tarragon and goat cheese, tossing it all together with some of the pasta water and adding S&P. I also topped it off with parmesan. Quite tasty!

The fact that this recipe has gotten high ratings largely has to do with all of the people who have added to it and bettered it, and reviewed their own superior version of the dish. DEFINITELY roast the asparagus, it carries the dish much further than if you just boil it, and it also maintains greater health benefits if all of the nutrients in the asparagus don't get thrown out in the unused pasta water. I doubled the amount of asparagus and still felt like there was enough cheese to make a filling and heavy sauce. I definitely wish I had read the reviews and thought to pick up sundried tomatoes. Without it, this dish lacks any roundness of flavor. With the appropriate improvements, I will make again.

I made this for a picnic and it was a hit. I roasted the asparagus with salt and pepper and used sun dried tomatoes (I put those in with the boiling pasta instead of the asparagus). Instead of tarragon, I used basil and I also used the goat cheese that comes packaged with herbs and oil. It was nice and lemony -- very refreshing.

Great recipe "bones"; I added sauteed sun-dried tomatoes and garlic, and tossed in some fresh basil. Used dry tarragon instead. this is a keeper

We make this dish all the time and add some roasted chicken sausage. The sausage helps give it a kick!

Made this for my family and we all LOVED it! After cooking with the pasta for 3 mins, I tossed the asparagus in a pan with butter, salt and pepper for a couple mins, cut into 3rds and mixed with pasta and sauce. It was great! I added just a bit of basil in the mix and a lot of lemon because I love it so much. My family said it was a gourmet meal. ;)

I followed the recipe directly, and the outcome was disappointing. This is the first recipe from Epicurious.com that I would consider a failure. This dish requires additional flavoring, I agree with adding sun dried tomatoes, I would suggesting the not adding the 1 cup of reserve water. This recipe is rather bland for my liking.

This was alright, but needed work. I roasted the asparagus ahead of time in olive oil (400 degrees / 10 min / turn halfway thru). After the pasta was cooked, drained & mixed with the asparagus, herbed goat cheese, 1 T of some olive tapenade (would've preferred sun dried tomatoes but didn't have any), lemon peel, and a about a cup of the reserved liquid, plus only a couple T of additional olive oil (since the asparagus was coated in it), light on the salt & pepper, then squeezed meyer lemon juice on it. Not bad, but not outstanding. The roasted asparagus was the best part, and it wasn't even part of the recipe.

Very good pasta dish when asparagus is in season. I didn't want to stop eating it! The cooking time for the asparagus is just right. I used a good goat cheese (packed in oil) that made for a nice creamy dressing. I would say the salt and pepper at the end are necessary - if you need more punch from the flavor you could probably make adjustments suggested by other reviewers. A little more lemon probably wouldn't hurt, and the sun-dried tomatoes could work as well.

Very good! Very easy! I roasted my asparagus because I saw another reviewer had done that and that is how we like it at our house. I added the extra lemon juice as suggested by other. My husband and I really liked it and will make it again.

After reading some of the other reviews, I added sundried tomatoes and more lemon juice. On the whole, I think it was a great way to use a little bit of leftover asparagus! It was relatively quick and easy and my boyfriend approved!

We really like this. Squeezed lemon juice over finished dish as suggested. Used combination of tarragon and basil, as my plants were too small to yield enough. Yum.

I added 2 tbls Terragon instead of 1, 6oz of the cheese instead of 5, and the juice of 1/2 the lemon in addition to the zest. Sprinkle with salt and it jazzed it up a bit. without the extras it was a bit bland. Definently make again.

Simple and delicious. I added some precooked shrimp and it was great. Also didn't have tarragon so used italian parsley instead and worked just fine.

Not bland at all if you add enough lemon zest and good goat cheese.

I generally don't care for asparagus unless it is grilled, which is what I did, and it was worth the effort. More lemon flavor, zest or juice, also helps. Only needed a splash of cooking water. I didn't think it was bland at all. Hard not to like if you use quality ingredients.

I happened to have all the ingredients on hand for this dish. It was good and enjoyable to eat, but not spectacular. Nevertheless, I wouldn't hesitate to make it again for dinner.

I added roasted chicken breast to this dish and it made a very nice, quick meal. Based on other reviews I used whole wheat pasta, good quality goats cheese and sprinked the juice of the lemon over the completed dish. I don't like tarragon so I used a mixture of fresh rosemary and tyme with lots of pepper. I only needed about 1/2 cup of the pasta water to get it to the right texture.

Very bland - boring. Kid's hated it, and so did I.

I added extra lemon zest and juice, parmesan cheese, and used herb goat cheese and still found this recipe lacking something. I also found that 2 cups of pasta water was too much. The recipe has potential--I love all the ingredients--it just leaves you wanting a little something else in the mix...

Delicious recipe!! I added sauteed mushrooms and extra lemon zest to round it out. As on reviewer said, they added lemon juice over the whole thing - that is a great idea. Big hit, loved the fact that I only used 2 pots on a weeknight!

Came out very well, and was very quick. As I didn't have tarragon, I substituted fresh basil, and it turned out well. The important thing is to have good goat-cheese, as that's the foundation of this recipe.

I found this a little bland. The texture was nice, and the asparagus was perfect with the fusilli. I added salt, pepper and parmesan cheese, which improved it greatly (though didn't exactly make it low fat).

This was great, it had a real spring-like feel and was light but flavorful. It was also very easy to put together. I made it with whole wheat pasta which was a nice texture. I would definitely make this again, especially since it was so quick.

This dish tastes of spring. The lemon imparts just the right amount of subtle flavor. This was exceptional with fresh goat cheese made with honey.

Just okay--even with a lot of salt & pepper, including crushed red pepper it lacked a lot of flavor. The consistency of the goat cheese was good, but this recipe really needs something besides lemon & tarragon.

I have not made this yet, but I am confused by the pie crust entry in the recipe. Surely, this must be a mistake.

This was a really good, simple springtime pasta. I used a little extra lemon zest. Might need something else to make it a 4 for me, but very good.
