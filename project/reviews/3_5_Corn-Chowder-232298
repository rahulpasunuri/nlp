This is now a family favorite, but I did make a few changes, similar to other reviews. Instead of bacon, I used a a 1/4" slice of ham,cut into small cubes. I used half and half instead of heavy cream; and I pureed half of the corn with 1 1/2 cups of the broth. I also thickened it with a mixture of 1/4 cup of water and 2 tablespoons of cornstarch (instead of roux). Finally, I garnished it with a few bacon bits. Now, after reading other reviews, I plan to replace half of the onions with leeks - it was a bit sweet and I think the leeks will add another dimension to the taste.

Mmmm just sauté a bit of garlic with the onion some cream corn and red pepper flakes..is good!

I followed others' suggestions to lighten it with a mix of one percent milk and half and half, and I used diced bits of ham, sauteed in olive oil, instead of bacon. The texture, even pureed, was very thin; I ended up resorting to a roux (more fat, unfortunately) to give it body. It was much better the second day. Garnish with a bit of low fat cheese or Greek yogurt. In future, I will make it a day before serving.

This soup was good, but very average. I've made a few different corn chowder recipes and for the effort, this one did not stand out. I did make a few slight changes. I used 1 cup 2% milk and 1/2 cream to cut a few calories and I also pureed all the vegies before adding the corn, bacon, and milk/cream. I highly suggest doing this--otherwise, it's more soupy than chowdery.

This is so good! I did try a variation that I will do again, I substituted most of the cream for lite coconut milk (would be great with regular coconut milk as well) and I did add some cayenne pepper. I believe it would be great with the addition of shrimp, crab, lobster or chicken.

Very good, like many I pureed about half the soup. But, the lumpy stuff that I was left with, with its slight pinkish hue from the red pepper was, well, just not appealing to the eye. So I decided to take the pureed half and strain in. The smooth but thick soup I was left with was much better. I combined this back in with the soup and was very happy with the texture. I did not use carrots or sweet potato, I thought the onion, corn and pepper were already going to make it quite sweet. I also replaced one cup of onion with about half a cup of leek. I was very happy with the result, this will be a new staple soup for us.

Pretty good. Actually, when I made it the first time, my family wasn't thrilled. They thought it tasted more like soup than chowder. So the next time around I pureed half of the chowder after the potatoes were done, stirred the pureed portion back in, and then added the buttermilk. Now everybody liked it! I also added a 4-oz can of diced green chili and two bay leaves (remember to remove before you puree).

pretty darn good. i used an immersion blender to thicken after cooking time. i found the bacon to be the most important ingredient.

So Yummy! I made this recipe two ways. The first way I pretty much follwed the recipe, but pureed some of the soup at the end to thicken it up. It was great! The second way was better- after I sauteed the veggies, I melted 4 T of butter and added 1/2 of flour to make a roux. Then I added the potatoes and chicken broth and cream. At the end, I also added some lump crab meat and chives. The chowder was much thicker and tasted great! While I did like both ways of preparing the soup, the second way with the roux was better.

To cut down on the fat, I skipped the bacon and used olive oil to saute veggies. Also substituted non-fat milk for the cream. Pureeing at least one cup of chowder really makes it yummy!

This recipe is to die for. Have made it many times. Everyone in my family loves it--even the picky eaters. Made even better if you happen to have some crab meat on hand. Just sprinkle on top of each individual serving, voila. Instant heaven.

This chowder is so yummy and satisfying. I noticed several people commented that it could be thicker, so I made a white roux just in case, and it turned out great. I used frozen corn and substituted about 1/3 cup with cream corn, and it tasted very good but I'm guessing it didn't even need the extra sweetness of the cream corn.

im in the middle of making a chicken corn chowder with potatos and cilantro and was using this as a guide. and seeing that it doesnt thicken well i found myself asking one question...does anyone know how to use a roux on this site? i mean taking half a hot soup and putting it in a processor or blender doesnt sound like the safest cleanest way of solving this problem, i know its french, but it works...try a roux next time everyone

This is the best corn chowder recipe I have ever made. It is, obviously, not low calorie, but it is very hearty and a great hit with family and church!

Rating: 4
This recipe has become a new favorite in my household. The only changes that I have made are to use ham steak or polish sausage instead of the bacon (I feel that both of these alternatives better enhance the flavor of the chowder), and I also add a teaspoon of cayenne pepper (which just adds of touch of heat to the aftertaste).

Rating: 3
I followed most of the recipe, except substituted 1 cup of half and half for 1 cup of heavy cream. I also found the chowder to be too thin, more like soup. I pureed half the chowder, that did the trick to thicken it up to chowder level. I thought it was still missing something after pureeing, I added in 3/4 can creamed corn and a little bit more salt and that did the trick, the creamed corn added a nice bit of sweetness. A great chowder for a cold winter day!

I forgot to mention that I also added some cayenne pepper, since I'd seen many corn chowder recipes that include it. It's nice if you like a little spice.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I can't have dairy with meat, so I boiled an extra white potato in a pot with the corn cobs until tender, then pureed the potato with a cup of the boiling water and added to the soup. This made it thicker and creamier without the added cream and fat.

Rating: 4
A wonderful recipe that was easy and well worth the prep time. Succulently sweet and each ingredient had a strong presence, the flavors mingled together, but stood alone. Some chowder recipes result in a very confused and muddled flavor, but not this one. Note: I did not use the bacon and it impressed all of my guests including the vegetarians.

Really great soup. Very adaptable. I threw in extra peppers, and following other reviews, pureed a couple ladles of the soup - this thickened it nicely and gave it a deeper yellow/orange color rather than the stark white of the cream. I also blackened (is that the right verb?) the fresh corn in a dry skillet before adding it into the soup: this added a bit of smoky flavor and a bit more color. Great recipe - I will definitely make this again.

A good way to thicken chowders is to add a little instant potatoes. It won't delute the flavors of the soup or taste mealy. A lot easier than processing. Just a suggestion.

Very Good! I made it twice. The first time I followed the recipe except the bacon and it was not as thick as I would have liked. The second time I cut the stock by a cup, used 1/2 of cream, and a generous half cup of sharp cheddar. I blended half the soup - Amazing!!

Rating: 4
Very easy and yummy! I too used 1 cup skim milk and 1 cup heavy whipping cream and it was wonderful. I just made it again and used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the whipping cream. I also blended half of the recipe. It was great! Oh, and I used frozen sweet corn. :)

This turned out quite nice! I cut the amount of cream, added leftover ham, and 1 chipotle in adobo to give it a smoky kick.

Very good chowder. It didn't thicken as much as I wanted, but I used Fat Free milk instead of cream to save some calories. Tastes great even without the bacon. I know I know, Bacon is delicious, but its so damned fattening that I had to ixnay it from the recipe.

This was very flavorful. I made it exactly as printed, but my cream separated even though I pureed 1/2 of the corn with the cream.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly as directed, except I did substitute leeks for the onion and I used dried thyme, because I forgot to buy fresh. I think fresh thyme would have given it a slightly heightened herb flavour, but, as it was, it was great! Great texture, great flavour and great nutrition. Oh, I also used 10% cream instead of whipping cream and didn't miss the additional richness.

Rating: 3
Great recipe if tweaked to your liking. I doubled the bacon (smoked). Used regular white or yellow onions. Added a shallot. Added some white wine or vodka while cooking the onion mix. Made the potatoes more chunky and added a small bay leaf to the chicken broth, and removed before adding the cream. Topped with the bacon bits and cayenne/paprika mix. I skipped all salt due to the bacon and I used dried chicken stock.

Tried this with fresh ingredients and followed the recipe exactly. Boring soup. Taste more like onion soup. Tried to doctor it up with more salt, crushed red pepper and it ended up in being thrown out.

Loved this recipe, as did my guests. Would definitely make again. Used frozen corn, which worked fine. Idea of pureeing part of the soup to thicken it is good. Will try that and perhaps some of the other variations suggested here next time.

I loved this soup! And I think the sign of a good recipe is one that can stand up to some substitutions and still come out delicious. This recipe definitely falls into that category. I discovered belatedly that my sweet potato I was going to add was mushy beyond saving. I used both russets and yukon gold potatoes instead. I didn't have any bacon but I did have bacon fat so I missed out on the tasty bacon chunks, but sauteeing the veggies in the bacon grease added a great flavor, nonetheless. I didn't have any cream so I used milk (2%) and added about half a cup of good shredded cheddar cheese to compensate for any lost richness. It added a great tanginess. Also, I didn't have any peppers on hand, but I did have a jar of roasted red peppers so I threw in a few of those. And finally, I took the recommendation of others and pureed part of the soup to thicken it up. I can't wait to make it again--exactly as the recipe states or according to what I have on hand!

This is a wonderful recipe - it was such a success! I am not an accomplished cook yet found this very easy to follow. As per another reviewers suggestion, I pureed about half of the soup and then added it to the remainder in order to make it thicker. It was delicious.

This is my favorite go-to soup! I have used both slab and regular bacon and find it doesn't make much of a difference. I also use green and red peppers (in fact I probably use more vegitables then the recipe calls for), and if the group is spicy I add one (or two) seeded serrano peppers diced finely. I have used Yukon Gold and Russett potatoes but I make the pieces bigger because I simmer everything longer (which I find makes a difference). This soup freezes and re-heats well, and is my 10-year-old daughter's favorite! It's great!

Even better second day! So, my husband and I are vegetarians so I made some changes. Sautee veggies in olive oil, not bacon grease. Add 3/4 cup of white wine to veggies. Use veggie broth and simmer the shaved corn cobs in the broth for 10 minutes before mixing together as advised by another cook (is well worth it). Only use half a sweet potato. Puree half of the chowder with the cream and add it back to the other half. Add tons of white and black pepper and some sea salt. Garnish with fresh thyme, chives and scallions. Wonderful!!

Hey all, I'd say this is pretty good for a soup. I was looking for something a little more robust. I'm going to play around with the ratios and will update a version on my site later on. One thing I can say now-- pan sear fresh corn cut from the cob for this one. Worth the 10 minutes while the base simmers.

I made it for Easter and it was a big hit. I would add more bacon next time. It was worth the time it took to cut up the vegetables. The next time I might try to use my cuisenart.

Question for those of you who have made this and said it was good with either crab or chicken: Did you add the crab or chicken in ADDITION to, or IN PLACE OF the bacon?? Thank you, as I would like to try this with some meat in it...

If I'd waited a day, I'd have happily given this 3 forks. My neighbor said it was great after sitting 8 hours, I thought it was delicious after 24. Sorry for all the posts, I really wanted it to be good, was so perplexed when it wasn't.

The recipe as written is OK, but I made a few changes to improve the flavor. I only added 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper, since the 1 teaspoon would have made it a bit too spicy for our tastes. I then added 1/2 cup of white wine, plus 4 teaspoons of cornstarch mixed in a little cold water (to thicken). I think next time I will take a cup of the soup, put it through an immersion blender, then stir back in to thicken as opposed to the cornstarch. With the changes, had a nice flavor.

Another thought: It's rare to see sweet onions specified for cooking - as good as they are raw, they just don't add the oomph, nor the sweetness, of regular onions.

Rating: 1
Very bland and takes forever to make. To my view, sweet potatoes and pepper add nothing where (unpeeled) potatoes, carrots and celery are mandatory. Did use whole milk but my usual favorite corn chowder recipe uses evaporated milk which might provide more milkiness without the fat. Think San Diego's idea on corn cobs is good.

Delicious. I added some crushed red pepper to give it a little more zing.

I made this dish using left over ham, and it was really good. Although, some hams can be a bit salty, and can be sweet. So I wouldn't add peas to the dish for that reason. I also used the chicken broth with less sodium. I have also made this with crab and spiced it up with some white pepper, and a bit of white wine and this was really good, I just pureed the broth with veggies and added the cream/milk then and then added the ham or crab in last so that was chunky, but very creamy. Kids loved it too.

This is an easy recipe and one that can be made with a multitude of variations. I like the chicken broth in the recipe, but it can also be made with milk or cream and no chicken broth if needed. It's a staple in my family.

Only put the cream into the amount you're serving at that time, then it won't "break".

i loved this recipe - I used tender new vegetables, and the only (slight) change I made was to add some yellow (wax) beans and a handful of fresh, shucked peas. I removed the sprigs of fresh thyme before serving, and their remaining leaves flecked the white broth with bits of dark green - it was as pretty as it was tasty. I think you could have fun experimenting with this soup as well - it would be lovely with chunks of fresh salmon.

Thought this was wonderful but when I went to reheat, it had "broken". Any suggestions for fixing this?
