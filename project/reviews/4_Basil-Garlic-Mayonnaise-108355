This was great as written as the mayo on a grilled tomato and cheese sandwich. To the leftover mayo I added some lemon zest, roasted red pepper and buttermilk and used it as the sauce for fried green tomatoes. Even better!

I was running a little low on basil so I only used 1/2 - 3/4 cup and it was delicious. Would absolutely make this again!

This is fantastic. Was looking for something with a little zip to go on my BLT sandwiches.

Love this versatile, easy-to-prepare recipe! Tonight we ate it with steak, but I'm excited to try it out with pasta/chicken salads, as well as sandwiches. I also added a little less than a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice, and about a tablespoon or so of olive oil to thin it out. I was out of cayenne pepper, but used "Cajun's Choice" Creole Seasoning, which worked well!

This is so good. Great with a sandwich!

Tasty! But very strong. Essentially a mayonnaise pesto. Had it on turkey burgers, yum - now I get to figure out other uses for it! I think it'll be too rich for me to dip anything directly into, but I may come up with some new sandwich ideas this week... : )

I made a batch of this, then added it to cubed poached chicken breast, celery, and walnuts to make a delicious chicken salad. Wonderful!

A definite keeper! Made no changes to original recipe; served as condiment with tilapia, but also complimented fresh cut vegetables ... tomatoes, cukes, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots & celery. In future will use as pre-coating to roasted new potatoes.

I used this as a dressing for tilapia and it was fantastic. The only thing I did differently was add a small amount of cream to thin it a bit, and squeezed a half of lemon into it-really gave it a zing. This stuff is great!

Deeeelicious. This stuff could make cardboard taste good.

This recipe is fantastic, great for sandwiches, tuna or chicken salad. Also great as a dip for those garden cukes and tomatoes, we loved it.

We made this for the 4th of July barbeque to accompany grilled flank steak - everyone loved it! I would not change a thing - the cayenne pepper, basil & garlic complemented the steak and did not overpower it. It is a nice change from Peter Luger's Steak Sauce!
