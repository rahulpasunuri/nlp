Everyone else thought these were great, but I found them overwhelmingly sweet, to the point where I couldn't even taste the chocolate of the brownies. The caramel seemed tricky to me and took a long time, longer than I thought it should.

It's easier to put the toasted, chopped pecans directly onto the brownie and then top with the caramel mixture.

I think the caramel recipe could be written a little better. I changed it slightly to use light brown sugar. Stir until ingreds are dissolved, then don't touch it. Let it boil to 240 degrees on candy thermometer and then remove from heat. That way, you know it will set properly.

I also made 1 1/2 recipes for a 13x9" baking dish. My caramel-pecan layer did not set up. The cream and vanilla did not bubble up and steam. The result was wet and sticky. It may have been due to my corn syrup from the last century. Next time I will chop and toast the pecans.

Fabulous and rich recipe. It's great as written, although we toasted the pecans before using so that the pecan taste comes out more. It's definitely better chilled -- we tried them warm, but they were way too rich for us, and we are chocoholics! Easy and good!

I made the whole recipe in a 8" square pan and baked for 20 minutes. They were really really good brownies. Definitely should be careful when dealing with the caramel - I almost burned mine. I also melted the chocolate garnish with 1.5 tb of cream to make it easier to drizzle. I put the brownie in the freezer immediately after it came out of the oven and then left it to cool for an hour before I started on the caramel. I then put the whole thing in the freezer again and it was ready in another hour. I used walnuts instead of pecans, and toasted the walnuts for 5 minutes before using them. This is a real impressive looking gooey treat. Definitely would make it again, but maybe only on special occasions, because it takes quite a bit of effort.

These were really great. I was tempted to give it four forks. There are several steps involved, which was a bit time consuming, but they really were special brownies. They were really good the first day, but even better when refrigerated overnight--they get really fudgy. Yum.

Excellent. The brownie was perfect for me - nice and fudgey. I might make them without the topping. but the caramel topping was great. And it does taste like caramel, I don't know what that lady is talking about. I let mine go a shade too dark - tasted fine but the color was darker than I would have liked. Watch the caramel carefully when it is boiling!

If you didn't like it the first time, try again. Try "fork" checking the brownies after 15 minutes. When everything is done right, this recipe is fabulous!!!

This recipes was pretty good, but I don't think that the sticky nut topping tastes much like caramel. The brownie itself is nice and fudgy, but our oven runs hot and we took the pan out after 20 minutes--that was perfect for our 8X8 pan. We also made the Raspberry Hazelnut Brownies from the same issue of Gourmet and those are certainly more cakelike--plus you need to double the raspberry jam for that one. I would have been happier with a true caramel layer in between the nut topping and the brownie, but perhaps I am too decadent. Good brownie though and I will make it again.

These are unbelievably chewy and delicious! Easy to make and come out perfect every time! These were always gone too quickly, so I now make one and a half recipes and bake it in a 13 x 9 inch pan. The best!

These were good but not as good as I was expecting. I think the caramel was too sweet for my taste. Also, I think I prefer the caramel sandwiched in the middle of the brownie rather than on top of the brownie as it is in this recipe. There is a recipe w/ color photo for caramel pecan brownies found through kraftfoods.com which features baker's chocolate. It uses Kraft caramels in the recipe (which is actually more work than making the caramel sauce from scratch because you have to unwrap the little suckers!). But anyway, the other recipe results in a better tasting brownie, caramel sauce and nicer presentation than this one. I'll stick with (& recommend) the other recipe.

I am almost afraid to put this review down, given how well everyone else liked the recipe. I have had great success with other recipes on this site. THIS ONE WAS A DISASTER. I have no idea what went wrong. I double checked everything, but could tell something was wrong before I even put it in the oven. The mixture was obviously too little for a 9x9in pan. By 20 minutes it was far too burned to be enjoyed. Given how many forks this gets from everyone else, I recommend either trying the icing recipe on your standard brownies, or watching this recipe very carefully should you find that it barely covers an 9 inch pan to a reasonable depth.

I have made this recipe at Christmas every year since the recipe came out in the magazine. It is wonderful!!

OK - so I cheated and used box brownies and just made the topping - and these were still FABULOUS. Definitely a keeper. I agree with the other reviewers - watch the sugar syrup carefully because it can burn FAST. Also, be careful because it can also burn the beejeebers out of you!

Rating: 4
These are absolutely the best! The brownie is fudgy and dense and the topping is phenomenal. Everyone raves and then asks for the recipe. Two cautions: don't burn the caramel (it can burn easily) and refrigerate them; they are much better that way!

Rating: 4
These were outstanding; not elegant or refined, but a perfect version of a gooey American dessert. My guests raved. I used Ghiardelli chocolate for the brownie layer (which I baked in a 7x11 pan) and they were fabulously chocolately. The next time I might reduce a bit of the sugar/corn syrup for the caramel as it was a bit sweeter than I'd like.

Fabulous! Everyone inhaled them at my open house yesterday. There wasn't one left by the end of the night. I agree with one other reader - do not overcook and you will have ooey gooey good brownies.

The brownie part of this is delicious, moist, fudgy, not too wet, not too dry. Make it easy on yourself and microwave the semi-sweet chocolate for 40 sec on high, and just spoon-drizzle it over the top at the end. I was a little disappointed in the 'caramel' topping. Even though I boiled the corn syrup/sugar mixture forever, and it turned somewhat darker, it is goopy and not caramel-like as I would have expected.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Easy to make, but with impressive results. The only changes I made were to add 3 additional ounces of pecans to the carmel and I used several ounces of chocolate to drizzle the top. A great do-ahead dessert perfect for bringing to work or a bake sale.

The brownie is not as gooey as it should be, but the caramel is excellent. Substitute any brownie receipe you desire, and the caramel will make a wonderful addition.

One word: WOW. Since I first saw this recipe I've been making them each Christmas for family and friends. They're gone before any other dessert around. I've substituted milk chocolate for semisweet for the garnish occasionally, too.

Always a hit.

I doubled the recipe to make enough for a company potluck. The brownies were a big hit. Make sure to not overcook the sugar and syrup. Cook only until the liquid turns light brown. The mixture seems runny at first until it cools. I may never make brownies from a box again.

These were delicious, and easily made with a mix as well as from-scratch brownies (for a shortcut). I thought it would have been nice if the caramel/pecan layer were a little thicker and more gooey, though. Otherwise quite a hit at my house.

The caramel addition to this recipe is wonderful, but I'm not quite sure if I did something wrong with the rest - the brownie layer didn't taste very chocolatey or chewy to me - it was really rather average. I was hoping for a very dense brownie, but it's more like a soft cookie - anyone have any suggestions for what I did wrong?

Rating: 4
These brownies are definitely worth the extra step of making the caramel topping. This is by far the best dessert I have made. The brownie layer is very dense and the caramel was firm, yet slightly gooey. I worried it might be difficult to chew, but it wasn't. It makes a small batch, but the pieces can be cut small because it's very rich. I served with good quality vanilla ice cream and my guests raved. I will make this one again and again.

I have never taken the time to make scratch brownies, thinking (as one reviewer says here) it's not worth the trouble. I WAS WRONG. This is not only the best brownie I've ever tasted but the best dessert I've ever consumed. It is worth every second and more. At least one guest made the same comment.

My search for the BEST BROWNIE IN THE WORLD is over. This is as good as it gets! I froze a few of the brownies just to see how they hold up. The results were spectacular. Anybody who would substitute a brownie mix from a box for this recipe should be spanked with a wooden spoon. Get a life and spend a few minutes in the kitchen. Its worth it. Thank you !

Excellent dense brownie; do not over bake. Take time with the caramel and remove from heat once it turns golden. The batch was gone within minutes of presentation; and more demanded. Definitely a keeper.

Absolutely great! With nuts being so expensive, I made the caramel, added the cream and the vanilla and then poured it on the brownies. I then sprinkled the nuts on top. Otherwise, you tend to lose the nuts because they stick to the pan, when stirring in the cream and vanilla. Only problem is they are MESSY. The caramel kind of softens and starts to run. When giving as a gift, makes it difficult to wrap up.

I took these brownies to work and everyone went wild over them! Even my "I'm on a diet" husband cannot resist them! I am constantly getting requests to bring them into work and when I do bring them in I have to bring in at least 3 batches or risk the wrath of the office!

Too much effort for what it is...if I did make it again I would serve it warm with ice cream. This was too messy to take to the office for a potluck.

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! I've made it twice already. The second time, all I had handy was store-bought brownie mix and it turned out beautifully. It saved a lot of time, too. I agree with one of the other cooks, take your time with the caramel. But don't wait until the corn syrup/sugar mixture turns a dark brown before adding the cream - it might taste a little burned.

I've been on a quest for "most awesome brownie". I made these and served them at a dinner party I had and they were a BIG hit! They are very rich, so definitely cut them into 16 pieces...it was a perfect portion to serve on a pastry buffet. I think this brownie is pretty awesome!

THESE BROWNIES WERE DELICIOUS AND DECADENT!!! IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD EVER MADE CARAMEL AND IT TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULLY - JUST TAKE YOUR TIME WITH IT!!!
