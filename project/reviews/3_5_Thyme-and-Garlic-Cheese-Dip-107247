Very easy. Tastes great! Made it just as written the first time - will experiment with other herbs next time.

I used a tiny bit less thyme, only a 1/4t of salt, about 6 ounces of heavy cream, 1/4t cayenne, and 2T thinly sliced green onions after blending. I would use less cayenne next time, but other than that it was really great. Very smooth and creamy. I did fresh cut veggies; jicama was really good with it.

Wow, so easy and flavorful. My friend's 21 month old wouldn't stay out of it. I look forward to making it again and bringing to potlucks!

I thought this was great, and I didn't even use full-fat cream cheese. Why wouldn't it be good  you could basically take garlic and fresh herbs and stir them into a vat of swill and it would taste great. I'm of the school that says you can never have too much garlic or herbs, so I almost doubled both. If I'd used full-fat cream cheese it would be even more over the top. However I could see how it might benefit from a little lemon juice, which I'll try next time. Speaking of time, or thyme, stripping the leaves off the stem is so tedious, even though I try to make it meditative or sing or something. Sometimes the method of running your fingers from the top of the stem to the bottom just doesn't work so well, especially if there are a lot of offshoots. I think that only works if your stems are particularly woody, or if your thyme is crazy-fresh. As in, if you didn't grow it yourself and you picked it up at the supermarket, you'd better start stripping the leaves off on the drive home.

Really liked this dip, although I made a few changes. I used a whole, lg. clove of garlic instead of just half. I added 1/4 tsp. cayenne and a handful of fresh chives. Also, I used about 1/2 c. sour cream and about 6 oz. of cream cheese because I'm more partial to sour cream than to cream cheese. Will definitely make again!

I add a little fresh sage as well, plus some cayenne pepper. It really perks it up and makes it a dip I can call my own. Nothing but comments from friends. Great with veggies or pita chips.

An excellent appetizer -- light, tasty, delicious. I used creme fraiche instead of sour cream and, of course, fresh thyme. I let it chill several hours before serving, and that was a good idea: When first made, the garlic taste is overpowering, but mellows out over a few hours. I served the dip with baby carrots, celery sticks, and olive-oil based Italian crackers.

This was truly just so-so, but I don't think it was 'one-fork terrible'. The dip reminded me a lot of those classic tea-time cucumber sandwiches: BORING AND INSIPID. No offense to lovers of cucumber teatime sandwiches, of course. Definately won't be making this one again!

raw garlic made the dip stronger than expected, however everyone loved it, & left overnight, it was better. great with so many things.

This recipe is a great start for endless variations. I added a few green onions this time. Also, I didn't have enough sour cream (I made a double quantity) so I ad libbed with heavy cream and a bit of whole milk to make it creamier than the recipe calls for (thanks to previous reviewer for that idea). It was a hit! Future variations could include rosemary and lemon zest instead of garlic and thyme, or finely chopped black olives and sundried tomatoes and the list goes on...

I'm sure this recipe is great, but I changed it a lot and it was fantastic. I roasted 2 bunches of garlic with a little balsamic vinegar, mashed them and mixed them with the farmer cheese, and a little milk to make it creamy instead of sour cream. I uesd fresh sage and parsely instead of thyme, but only b/c i had it on hand.

I thought this dip was OK, but it wasn't a big hit at my party. Besides the taste of the fresh thyme, the rest of the ingredients and flavors were rather ordinary. I have better cheese spread recipes.

This is a great dip, and is wonderful with veggies and wheat crackers. It has become a staple for entertaining at our house.

It was just so-so. It needs more flavor or PUNCH!

Absolutely delicious and soooo easy to make!

This was very good. I made it with farmer cheese. I had to add more sour cream because it was to thick otherwise. I might try making it with the cream cheese next time.

Easy & delicious. Made a lot of dip; especially good with veggie sticks and toasted pita triangles. I used low fat ingredients which worked just fine.
