Great recipe! Everyone loves it and raves about it. BTW, no need waste time letting the cola sit - just start reducing. That's just silly! It's a great make ahead recipe. I mix the ribs while still hot w/ the sauce so it will absorb the best, then brush on during the grilling. Don't throw away left-over sauce! You can use it later in the week on Chicken or Pork.

Hmmmmmmmmmm. Just wondering A Cook from Long Valley, NJ. When did boiling crisp meat? Where you meaning to change the cooking order around? I will keep my eye out for McCutcheon's cherry preserves so :).

Love love love this recipe. Have made it for a wide variety of people, and always can never have enough. Some advice based on previous reviews - DO NOT get turned off by the sauce - something magical happens when met with the ribs! I can never find Dijon with horseradish so I just add prepared horseradish. After the baking, grilling or at least boiling is essential to crisp up the ribs so don't skip that step. I usually do that before adding the sauce then grill some more with a bit of sauce. Oh,and one last thing, I really like using whole cherry preserves which in my area (northwest NJ) the McCutcheons brand is great. ENJOY!

This is my 2nd review of this recipe. First time out i adjusted it to oven only cooking as I haven't ready access to a BBQ grill as a highrise apt. dweller. Last summer, the camping bug hit me and with it, the need to grill food readily. I must say that the technique/recipe as written, stands beautifully on it's own and was a oft requested recipe from my 4th of July visitors and fellow campers. I finally made this recipe completely as written, and although I still plan to "evolve" the technique to my own needs (Asian ribs? German ribs w/ sauerkraut?) and it still remains DA WINNER!!!!!

Not sure what went wrong.... almost burned my house down on the first attempt at this sauce. Second attempt, did not talk to neighbors with the sauce on the stove, but it turned out horrible. I am sure that I did something wrong with all the rave reviews, but I will not be making this recipe again.

Rating: 4
Holy craaaaaaaaaaap this is so amazing. I used almost 2L of Cherry Coke since I had to buy nearly 12LB of ribs...it stretched the recipe just fine and I ended up having to actually throw some sauce away (I also brushed it on while grilling instead of tossing the ribs before hand - worked well).

OMG, these were the best ribs we've ever eaten! My guests raved about them at my 4th of July party. Follow the recipe exactly but suggest you make more sauce. Plenty for the ribs but could have used some more for dipping. Yummy, yummy, yummy!

I have been making this recipe for years and each time everyone raves about it. I am able to adjust the sauce for each particular audience by the amount of additional hot sauce or horseradish sauce that I add (sweeter for kids, spicier for adults).

I've been making this recipe since its inception in 2002. It is going to appear again this Memorial Day. Our guests love it and have a lot of fun trying to figure out the "different" taste. Favorite side dish is the potato salad from the Honey Baked Ham store to which I add lots of chopped onion.

This is one of the few recipes I make over and over. I use a deeper pot, and whisk the coke to get rid of some of the effervescense prior to reducing. I agree it smells funky while simmering, but it comes together beautifully!

This recipe has become an entertainment staple at our house. We've made these 30 or 40 times since tearing the original out of a 2002 Bon Appetit. Friends never fail to ask when we might be cooking them again. Do yourself a favor and prep the sauce a day ahead of time. Then enjoy.

I made this for serveral BBQs and it is generally the first item to disappear. I think I may invite folks over for a reason to make this before the summer ends. Don't judge the sauce until its done. The conversion to the cherry glaze is a welcome suprise. Yes, there is an off-gas to the reduction. Get over it, it'll be worth it in the end.

I have never made ribs before, but had a big crew of rib-lovers coming to our home, so made this and received RAVE reviews.

Very good flavor. A little time consuming, so I used a large pot for the cherry cola instead of waiting 4 hours! I think I might try a different rib next time. Overall - very good, but would make the sauce a day ahead.

I totally had the same outcome as did rnonrun from Ca/Az Border. I took my attention off the pot and his noxious gas filled my home...I had to pull the pot off the stove and crawl out of my apartment with the pot in tow...and left it outside to diffuse. I gave it a go the next day and it turned out great and it is the only recipe I use. The noxious gas story makes the ribs not only tastey but entertaining too. GREAT RECIPE!!!

These ribs were delicious. As other reviewers commented, the glaze on its own is not very good. However, once it was combined with the ribs, it was wonderful! The sauce was not too sweet and gave the ribs a unique flavor. Baking the ribs in the oven for 2 hours made them extremely moist.

Rating: 4
This a serious keeper! I live in an apt. so BBQ-ing isn't any easy option. Made this totally in the oven.Cooked the ribs as suggested but then continued for an additional hour once the ribs were glazed at 375 degrees to crisp the meat a bit. Oh yes and I air dried the uncooked meat for 24 hours in the fridge. Final result? Still tender but a nice chew to it. Used sour cherry perserves as well as a can of black cherries that was languishing in a corner of the pantry. Drained and pulse chopped em in the food processor. Replaced 1 TB of tamari sauce for same amt. of soy. Seemed to give a more rounded flavour. Hehehehe like another I overboiled the soda which became a syrup but hadn't burned it sooo I added more cola to it and brought it back to 1.5 cups ;). I actually think I'll do this again as the syrup developed some interesting caramel notes. Like others i couldn't find Cherry Coke- so I used Dr. Pepper. Since several toddlers were in attendance I lowered the heat of the hot sauce and horseradish to 1/2 the amts in the recipe. Next time I plan to go fult-tilt boogie and kick this ribs up! I will NOT forget this recipe fer sure!

Unbelievable! To the poor soul that poured it down the sink... Even my Foodie son thought it stunk during prep but I promised it would work! Transformation occurs during infusion AMAZING!!! For those that want to speed up the process of boiling the cola, be careful! I fell asleep the first time and had a noxious bizzare science project w/a partially ruined pan. The State Fair potato salad rocks as well. --leslie

This the only rib recipe I ever use. I first made it when the recipe was published in 2002 & now it's become a bbq season staple. The method of cooking the ribs leaves them tender & melts the excess fat away. The sauce is great for people who like sweet or spicy. I sometimes add extra hot sauce depending on the crowd I'm cooking for. The sauce also freezes well, so now I make a double batch & stick the second batch in the freezer.

Rating: 4
My family loves BBQ sauce, but am not a huge fan, so this wonderful alternative that everyone enjoys. It isn't absolutely necessary to let the soda go flat if you're pressed for time. Love this cooking method for the ribs when entertaining - make them ahead of time and throw them on the grill just before you're ready to eat.

If you look through the additional reviews, you will see a person who thought it was awful and "poured it down the sink", I should mention (in addition to my review below) that after the ingredients are blended and BEFORE the ribs are cooked, the sauce does taste weird - however, when you cook the ribs the transformation is amazing - make sure you finish before you decide the sauce is no good!

Rating: 4
The recipe calls for the soda to stand 4 hours to get flat. I believe that is because the effervescence might cause it to overboil. I used a deeper pot and skipped that step, using it straight from the can and that worked fine. Save's lots of time. If anyone else knows another reason, let me know but I didnt see any difference. PS very good recipe, I always make my own St Louis style BBQ sauce to rave review and this is just as good - different, but just as good!

This is a super recipe. It has become our "house sauce" and bottled sauces do not compare. We changed the recipe a bit because of non-available ingredients. We used regular Coke and then used grainy mustard and added 2 TB horseradish because horseradish mustard was not at store. We also added more heat with 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes and 2/3 cup raspberry jalapeno jelly in place of 2/3 of the cherry preserves. To boost the brown notes we added 2 TB worcestershire sauce as well.

Yes, these were yummy (sugar and fat rarely dissapoint) but the sauce was not the knockout I was expecting. I guess I was hoping for more of a concentrated cola taste. In fact, I was suprised that I spent all that time cooking down the soda pop and what I made tasted like cheap hoisin sauce. I think combining hoisin and cherry jam would have a very similar effect and be a lot easier.

This is the best rib recipe and it never fails to impress. To the cook from Oshawa, I too have had problems finding cherry cola so I've substituted Dr. Pepper in a pinch. With the cherry jam etc, it doesn't change the taste too much.

I made this recipe several times when it was first featured in Bon Appetit. It was very different,very tasty and everyone loved it.

(I live just outside of Toronto)

This recipe I found to be beyond compare, due to the fact that since another one does not exsist. It would be most wise for one to make the decision of using raspberry vinegar as another option. Allow it to be stated that cherry preserves are very easy to find, you can even get it in those little packets from denny's. I have made other variations prior to finding this recipe and I was acctually amazed to even see that a recipe was out there. One time I made it using marachino cherries, and grinding them up in the food processor. Another time I even went to the extent of utilizing the cherry soda syrup from the BIB. This I found to have too much of a redish color, and much to sweet. This recipe looks similar to BBQ sauce. I may make this again but I think if the people I was entertaining would only tell it was good because of the fact that they do not want to be rude, which is why I figure so many people say that in 95.3% of these reviews. So all in all I love this recipe and would make it agin for policemen when they come for BBQ times. Love it a metric ton.

Excellent. Made a few changes for a make ahead version for guests. Used short ribs and rasberry vineger. After BBQing ribs to glaze placed ribs in a crook pot with a good cherry pie filling and enough of the glazing sause to liquify the pie filling. Cooked in crook pot for 6+ hours (meat falls off the bone). Served with corn bread and potatoe salad. Make ahead and serve when ready.

Finger-licking good. Great change from the heavy tomato-based bbq sauced ribs. Few people believe that the base of the sauce is cherry cola. The hot sauce adds a nice kick, but I would recommend an asian style one instead of a Texan or Mexican style one to compliment the flavors.

This recipe has become a summer staple for easy entertaining. Everyone just goes nuts over them - and I always get asked for the recipe!

I tried this recipe and was out of soy sauce so left it out. I thought it was delicious anyway. For one who doesn't care for hot, spicy bbq sauces, this was a tangy, but somewhat sweet fruit alternative. I used the reserve sauce to add some at the table and enjoyed the cherries so much.

I've made this recipe a few times now, always to raves. It is simply delicious.

Made this for a party. Ribs were so tender that I couldn't put them on the grill. Instead I cut them into 2 rib portions, covered with sauce and put them under the broiler for about 5 minutes. My guests raved about them. Everyone had seconds and 4 of my guests called for the receipe. What a success! And if you don't hae time to make your own sauce, cheat and use your favorite bottled barbeque sauce--just don't tell anyone.

Rating: 4
fall off the bone tender? yes, literally. i prebaked these babies a little too long and as a result they were in no shape as ribs per se for the final grilling. so, necessity being what it is, i pulled all the meat from the bones, tossed it around in the glaze, and then did up the final grilling on a perforated, low-ridged grill pan. oh man, when that heat and smoke got rolling i knew this was a keeper. took them off the grill just after a decent browning. at that point the meat is ready to go into your favorite roll, sliced italian bread, or whatever, and dressed up with some sliced vidalia or other sweet onion. when i make these again i'll try for rib status but won't shed a tear if i get these marvelous pork sandwiches again.

I tried everything I could to mess this recipe up. I only had half the ribs, so I halved the sauce (but forgot to half the cook times). the sauce was so hard it could've been candy. No problem - I stired in some water. The only ribs I had were cheapo "stew" ribs. No problem - still tender. The only hot sauce I had was a Thai mixture with fish sauce and frozen chilies. It was STILL wonderful. I have no idea what you would have to do to make this taste bad!

I made this for the first time Sunday evening for friends. My husband barbecued pork tenderloin, and used some of the glaze for the pork. I then mixed the cherry cola glaze into some whipping cream, and it made a fabulous sauce. With the leftover cherry cola sauce, I have decided to freeze it for further use..To anyone making this for the first time, be careful as it will burn quickly with all the sugar in the cola, and jam. Also it get quite thick and hard to spread, I nuked it just a little to get the sauce to a spreadable consistency. Have fun with this sauce....YUM,YUM, YUM

This was quite good. I am mostly rating the glaze. Like most of of us I did not exactly make this recipe. I used the Kansas City dry rub on the ribs first (also on this website). I roasted the ribs in the oven at 200 degrees for 3 hours. Then I made the glaze with what I had in the house. That included Dr Pepper and a lovely Italian wild berry fruit preserve. I grilled the ribs with the glaze for about 20 minutes. Note: the glaze can not make the ribs tender. It's the ribs themselves and cooking method.

Made this dish with babyback ribs for Easter and everyone was amazed at how tender they were.

These ribs were good. Grill them to get a nice crusty glazed finish. Some tips: 2/3 cup of mustard more or less is an entire 7.5 ounce jar. Maille had the kind called for. Cherry jam was a little hard to find but it is out there. Trimming the fat ahead of time is important. Next time, I'll splurge and try baby back ribs. My guests requested more of the sauce at the end so double or triple the sauce to pass around if you like extra sauce. Flavor is sort of sweet so add more hot sauce if you want more kick.

Question to all of you folks: what exactly are "spareribs"? In canada we have side ribs, baby back and country ribs. I'm guessing side ribs are the same as spare ribs, which are not as meaty and more fatty than back ribs... but can someone enlighten me? I've made this recipe with back ribs, deelish. Want to make more often and hoping the cheaper side ribs would work. thank you!

Though I am the chef in the family, my husband is the "rib master". These ribs tasted great! Pre baking the meat before grilling (instead of boiling ) is a great tip that I will use every time from now on!! However, the glaze did not taste as good as I expected (though time consuming!) And I got the added bonus of having to clean the sticky mess left behind by it!

Question - I don't like mustard - the smell of it actually makes me ill and since I won't use it in recipes - has anyone made these ribs eliminating the mustard and if so, what did you use instead?

Absolutely the best ribs I've ever made. Could not have been more tender. I did make them the nite before, and the sauce a few days before that. Could not have been better. No left over ribs. The next night, I used the sauce to grill chicken. Excellent. Reminded me of the cherry sauce that I sometimes have had on duck--yummy. Will be making this again. Also, the George Forman grill is a great kitchen appliance to own--but not for grilling ribs for 2 hours.

Havn't tried the recipe, although it sounds good. Cherry coke is a great short cut for creating what is crucial for good BBQ - carmelization. My problem, however, is with the George Foreman grill! Millions of people duped into laying out money for a worthless device that does nothing that your basic $12.00 cast-iron ridged grill pan can't. C'mon people - stop being sheep!

This recipe is wonderful! I have been having dreams about making this again. Fairly labor intensive, and it sound strange with all that cherry soda, but it is delicious.

Everyone was very impressed with me after I made these ribs. The meat fell right off and the sauce was dee-lish!!! I only fed 4 with this recipe and was left with plate of very clean bones.

I made this for a kazillion 14 year old boys. It was fantastic. Granted it was ribs - fatty, heavy, filling, etc. But the flavors of this recipe were excellent. It is my all time favorite rib recipe. Great for hungry men!

This recipe is definitely a keeper with my friends and family. The final result was surprisingly balanced. Although the use of cherry cola would make some worry the recipe to be too sweet, this is not at all so. The dijon mustard with horseradish gives these ribs a perfect ying-yang bang for your dollar!! One definite suggestion would be if using cherry preserves, to strain the final product through a chinoix or conical sieve. This seperates the seed and pulp and produces a smooth, velvety glaze. Try this one time and you'll be hooked.

Definitely the best ribs ever! Altered the recipe a bit... I boiled the ribs in salted water for hours, "sauced" them, grilled them on the BBQ, and glazed them right after... Best cherry jam to use is "Bonne Maman" Évidemment!

I must admit I only made this recipe because of all the rave reviews and now feel like I must be weird for really, really not liking them. I enjoy a subtle "sweet" taste with my pork, but this was a sledgehammer. It should be called candied ribs. I actually felt sick after 4 of these and couldn't eat anymore (good for the waistline at least). Maybe you are either a fan of slow-smoked, dry rubbed and mopped "authentic" ribs or not. I agree with the other reviewer who said you can't beat the Comptetition Bar-B-Q Ribs from FoodTV; which is a good oven recipe to use if you don't have a Weber charcoal grill with smoker to do the real thing.

I've made this a dozen times. The first time I eliminated the red pepper entirely. The labor intensive recipe is more than worth the effort. The second time was for the pot luck at our retirement community. I now have standing orders for the sauce!Here in Florida we find Smuckers Cherry Preserves and Publix Cherry Cola. The sauce is wonderful on pork loin, chicken, and Vietnamese Summer Rolls, just add a teaspoon of fish sauce to the original recipe and put the red peppers back in. A real winner!

WOW! My husband loves ribs and said these are his new favorite. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used baby backs, and they were excellent. I tasted the glaze right after all the ingredients were mixed together and I was skeptical. I continued though, and by the time the glaze had reduced to 2 1/2 cups, the taste had completely transformed from strange to delicious. After a friend of mine tried some, he paid me to make a batch for him (7 lbs) and he ate them all in two days. That was just last week and he's already after me to make him some more! I'm in So. Cal. and I found that Tropical brand cherry preserves are in many of the local stores - I had a harder time finding the cherry cola. Whatever you have to do, try these ribs!

These ribs were awesome - honestly, the best I have ever tasted! It was my first time making ribs (period!) and I was delighted at how they turned out - the recipe was great and easy to follow! I added crushed garlic, and doubled the hot sauce (using Vietnamese sriracha sauce rather than tabasco), and the sweet/spicy ratio was perfectly balanced. My boyfriend declared that he had never seen meat that fell off the bone so easily, and my roommates couldn't stop raving! Totally worth the hours of preparation.

My husband and I loved the glaze. I made extra glaze and used it to marinate country style ribs, chicken thighs and a pork loin. It was fantastic on all three. I will make this again and again.

I made this for my Labor Day BBQ and it was delicious. It was easy to make. I have an electric stove, so all the times for cooking down were exact for me- I didn't need to add any extra cooking time. The first batch I made was too hot/spicy with the tabasco added, so I eliminated it on my second batch. The next day I used some of the leftover marinade on chicken, then BBQ'd and it was delicious too.

These ribs were unbelievably good and a lot easier than I expected. I was afraid they'd be too sweet, but they weren't. Be careful to use cherry preserves without whole cherries in it. The jam I used had whole cherries in it. They fell to the bottom of the grill and caught on fire! (Fortunately, the ribs were already off of the grill.)

Awesome! Best ribs I ever tasted. Who new that cherry cola could taste so good. The cola reduction time varies, it only took 35 minutes. As the sauce came to room temperature it thicken greatly...almost too much. Next time, I will not reduce the sauce as much in the final stage to allow for a thinner consistency. Finger lickin' good.

Can you improve on perfection? You bet. I followed the recipe the first time I made these and they were very, very good. I had glaze left over (I had only reduced the original to 3 cups)so I made them again a couple of days later, only this time I used baby back ribs (leaner than spare ribs) and I added another tablepoon of hot sauce and a bit more vinegar to the remaining glaze. They were perfect. The extra heat and acid really helped balance the sweetness. I really like the procedure too. Prebaking the foil-wrapped ribs is easy, cuts down on splatters and ensures that ribs are perfectly tender. Ten minutes on the grill while basting with glaze and they're ready to enjoy.

Made these ribs for a Labor Day BBQ. They were a big hit. Recipe was very easy to follow. Added a touch more pepper sauce to increase the heat a notch. Thought I had bought too many ribs, but there were no leftovers.

I am making this recipe as I write, so it can't be that difficult! I made it first for July 4th. The crowd was licking the bones. 2 slabs were not enough!!! These ribs are incredibly good!

No one at our dinner party could stop raving about the glaze and how fabulous the ribs were. I found the jam at Target used Costco ribs. The only change I made is I cut the ribs up in 6" sections as my husband said he would not turn 7 lbs of individuals ribs. That made the grilling so easy, absolutely best ribs I've ever had!

Excellent. I've made this recipe twice. Very diferent from anything I typically make since I generally don't use package components (a bottle of Cherry Cola!) for my sauces. This is unique, delicious, pleased adults and children. And the concept is fun. Many requests for the recipe

I've made this twice now...the first time I made it to the letter. And it was pretty darn good. The second time, I added some garlic and five spice powder to the ribs before I cooked them and to the glaze. WOW. That was fabulous. Earned me two sticky thumbs up from my best friend. :)

I would have never made this recipe if it weren't for some many positive reviews... Cherry cola?! It was excellent. Just be careful not to leave the cola boiling at too high of a heat (as I did in my first effort). It turned into something resembling burnt plastic. Ruined that pan!

I made these spareribs for my Sunday dinner. The ribs were fork tender and with the cherry cola glaze they were absolutely wonderful. My picky kids even loved them. The cherry cola glaze was delicious by itself. I couldn't wait to try it on the ribs. This recipe is definitely a keeper and will be the only way that I will prepare ribs unless someone can come up with something better. For tose of you that had troulbe finding the cherry jam. I found it at my local Target store. And, I let the cherry cola sit out over night in an open container to flatten.

This was excellent - yes the sauce is a little labor intensive - but well worth it. I also par-boil my ribs - slather them in sauce and keep in fridge for a couple of hours before putting them on the grill. I have tried many recipes & always par-boil first with onions/crushed black peppercorns/red chile flakes & 2-3 cruched garlic cloves.

Rating: 4
Wow, the whole family loved this one. My tips: The glaze does take a lot of time, try to make it a day ahead. Rather than wrapping in foil and putting in the oven, just cook the ribs for 1 hour under medium indirect heat on the grill and then continue on with the recipe*. (Indirect heat means not over a lit burner on a gas grill, or over a drip pan in a charcoal grill.)Remove the thin, papery skin from the back of each rack of ribs by pulling it off in a sheet with your fingers, using the corner of a kitchen towel to gain a secure grip, or with pliers. *And for flavor's sake, never par-boil ribs!

I couldn't find the mustard so I used regular dijon and some horseradish. I loved this recipe, but the sauce wasn't as spicy as I wanted, so I rubbed some cayenne on the ribs before baking them. That pumped it up some too, but next time I make I might add some diced jalapeno peppers to the sauce about half-way through. I am not usually a heat maven but I think the jalapenos will get me where I want to be with these ribs. Even without them, they were a hit and I was the envy of my pals at work when I brought out the leftovers at lunch. : ) --yes I had leftovers, but now I'm ready to try these on a larger crowd)

Just great- equal to, though different from, the mustard-bourban ribs which have been my favorites for years. I think the sauce would also be great with duck. Maybe I'll try it with the leftover sauce...Tried it today, using the leftover sauce with roasted duck. It was fantastic!

This is a great recipe, and works well with modifications. I ended up subsituting cherry pie filling for half of the jam and a different type of mustard. I just ran it through the blender and it worked great! Also, bake the ribs for about 3 hours instead of 2. This recipe is very time consuming but is one of my favorite rib recipes.

This is a reputation maker!! I have prepared these ribs twice for friends, and have been begged to make them again!! They are absolutely fall-off-the-bone tender and the flavor is fantastic!! I'm thinking of adapting recipe by using Dr. Pepper instead of cherry cola

It was a hit at 4th of July and has been a requested meal many times afterwards. The sauce is really not difficult at all, it's just a lot of waiting time while it boils down, but since there is usually leftover sauce it's great for another meal!

Great stuff. Made it twice. Agree with earlier comments on time. Definitely longer to make the sauce. Cutting the ribs individually seemed like more work that necessary was well. I just dunked the full slab the second time and also made more sauce. It went tableside real fast.

These ribs are out of this world! I made my ribs in my electric water smoker, though, instead of grilling them. I rubbed them the night before with a mixture of light brown sugar, salt, pepper, a few dashes of cinnamon, some garlic powder, and some onion powder. I brushes some of the cherry cola glaze on the ribs about 45 minutes before they were done, then served the rest of the glaze on the side. This is a fantastic glaze and, even though it takes some time to make, is very easy to prepare. I even had some glaze left over, which I'll use to glaze a pork tenderloin another time. I loved this recipe, and will repeat it often!

My husband and I weren't WOWED by this recipe. It's really quite time consuming to prepare and the flavors were just o.k. I don't feel any stronge urge to make it again...I'd try something else new first. One tip, I saved the juice and fat off the pork, skimmed the fat off, then cooked Chinese egg noodles in the broth (with extra water). They were delicious with a little soy sauce over top.

I guess after reading all the reviews it's me??? These ribs were good, but not great?? The sauce did not reduce to 2 1/2 cups. I followed the recipe exactly. I guess the flame on my stove wasn't set high enough. Anyway, I had to reduce it a second time. The flavor was good but not worth all the ingredients it took. I had trouble finding Cherry Preserves. I had to go to 3 stores. I also had a difficult time finding the mustard. I won't make this again.

OK, here's my revision! While the glaze continues to taste pretty nasty by itself, I did a "test rib" in the broiler to check it out, and it was wonderful. My 8 year old told me she'd eat 100! I did the rest on the grill, and they were also good, although I actually think the broiler version was better! We'll keep this recipe, although making the sauce was pretty time consuming (with all the reduction). Has anyone tried making a double batch and freezing half for later?

A wonderful, fabulous surprise. I have to admit I thought the ingredients were a strange combination, however, tried it anyway. Everyone at our party throughly enjoyed this, and asked for the recipe. I did not have any trouble making the sauce, although it was time consuming. I will definitely make it many times again. A real crowd pleaser!

Wonderful! I got raves from Southerners, Easterners, Westies and Europeans alike. (Barbeque sauces can be so regional I was worried that everyone would like it) Everyone thought they were wonderful.

Everyone asked for the recipe.

An absolutely wonderful recipe--I will never cook spareribs any other way. THE BEST! Great to be able to cook the ribs well in advance, then throw on the barbie. RAVE reviews from our guests on the 4th! Misread the reduction amount of the cherry cola; ended up with 2 1/2 cups instead of 1 1/2 cups, but it still turned out delicious. Added more tabasco. Was a little disappointed in the State Fair potato salad, and I'm a sweet pickle lover; all the ingredients looked delicious, but only tasted so-so.

We were at our friends home for 4th of July when they pulled these ribs off the grill. I was so excited as my mouth had been watering for them since I saw the tasty treats on the cover of the July issue. They did not disappoint. Yum and a pretty presentation.

When I saw the cover recipe for the July issue of Bon Appetit - I knew I'd found the perfect dish for our annual 4th of July party at our cottage on the lake. The recipe surpassed all expectations! Each of my guests asked for the recipe and all enthusiastically said that they were the best ribs they'd ever had! The recipe is great for entertaining as everything can be prepared in advance. The recipe is very easy - I followed it exactly. Making the sauce is time consuming because of the waiting period for the cola to flatten; the reducing period for the cola; and the final reduction of the sauce (next time around, I'll simply let the cola flatten overnight) However, since this can be made ahead of time - this remains a wonderful recipe for entertaining! Baking the ribs in advance made the final grilling process a breeze. No one at our party had every baked ribs as directed in the recipe (individually wrapped in foil and slow roasted)- but the end result was so outstanding, I think this is the only way we'll be cooking ribs from now on!

I made it for Father's Day and it was a huge hit! I made it exactly as written and it was perfect as far as we could tell.

I MADE THIS RECIPE FOR A FAMILY PICNIC AND EVERYONE WANTED THE RECIPE. INSTEAD OF USING RIBS, I USED THE GLAZE ON A GRILLED PORK LOIN AND IT WAS DELICIOUS.

I made a batch as soon as I got the recipe. The sauce was great! It was sweet, but the tabasco gives a nice bite. I'd definitely make the sauce ahead of time, and watch it close so it doesn't burn. I'll be making these for my gourmet club next week! YUM! BTW, I followed the instructions exactly.

Rating: 4
this was one of the best rib recipes i have tried. you do need to start this in advance due to the cherry cola needing to "de-fizz" and for the sauce to cook for awhile. i would make more sauce than the recipe calls for..but it was very tasty. i par-boil my ribs in a big pot of water for an hour or until tender. then i place them on heavy aluminum foil..baste with the marinade, wrap the foil, and put them on the grill for 15 minutes to get hot. for the last 5 minutes, i place the ribs directly on the grill, turning once, just to crisp the up a tad. a great recipe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
