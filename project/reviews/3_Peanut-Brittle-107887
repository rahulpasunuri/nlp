I also followed the suggestion to add vanilla, butter and salt because, hey, what doesn't taste better with butter and salt added, right? This was my first try at making peanut brittle and being new to candy making, I thought this came out well. Perfect consistency, brittle but not 'crack your teeth' brittle. I think it could have been a bit sweeter to match that "See's Candy" brittle I had in mind, but actually I really liked it with this ratio. Not sure how to add more sweetness without just making more of the product. Perhaps sprinkle sugar over the top like I did the salt? Maybe mix more sugar into the butter which I added in off the heat right before putting it in the pan? Also, immediately filled the pan up with water and put it on the stove to boil, made cleaning out the pan a piece of cake. And using a silpat if you have one is the way to go!

Definitely follow comments to add salt, butter and vanilla, it's delicious! I also only used 1 tsp of baking soda based on recommendations. I used a mix of peanuts, cashews and pecans as well, and it's fabulous! It takes a lot os stirring, but not 20 minutes, thank goodness. And I live at a high altitude so things progressed at a lower level temp, closer to 200 degrees. But the mix all of a sudden turned dark and you could smell the sugar carmelizing, so trust your nose and instincts and don't let it burn.

Used the mods from Gladyce from 3/23/03 (although used 1-1/2 tsp. baking soda, ca. 3/4 tsp. vanilla). Came out perfectly. Stir and watch like a hawk, and remove it from heat *as soon* as the temp goes north of 290--this is on the hairy edge of being burnt if mishandled even slightly.

Is this a misprint? How one can boil the first 3 ingredients for 20 mins. is questionable. This recipe did not work for me ... burned in less than 5 mins...now trying to get the heavy burnt mess off the bottom of an All-clad LTD saucepan.

I've made this several times now. Very easy! I've followed the recipe (with the exception of adding a little salt and using salted peanuts) and it turned out great!

I disagree with the consensus on the baking soda; I added the suggested tbsp and I think it makes all the difference! What makes this candy so irresistable is the brittle crunch- you get that from lots of baking soda!

Based on comments and other recipes I've seen, I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and used 1 teaspoon baking soda instead of 1 tablespoon.

Following Gladyce's suggestions, this receipe came ok. Everyone loved it, but did say it could be a bit sweeter.

I agree with "gladyce" from Stamford, CT. The recipe looked so simple, but the finished product left a bit to be desired. It certainly was not my mother's old fashioned peanut brittle.

This recipe doesn't work the way it is written. The use of 1 tablespoon of baking soda yields a terrible tasting brittle. It appeared to be like a Sea Foam type of candy, but, it was very bitter in taste. After throwing out the first batch, I adjusted the recipe and got great results. I used 1 teaspoon of baking soda, 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter and 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. Adding the butter and vanilla after the sugar mixture reaches 290 degrees, and then removing from the heat to add the baking soda, stirring really well, and then pouring out on a silpat mat. Great results this way.
