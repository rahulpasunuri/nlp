Way too salty for my taste. Evidently for my guests also. People ate only one.

I thought these were OK but not great. I had a lot of them left over.

This is a tasty appetizer and the Pinot Grigio recommended is truely a great pairing. Next time will cut back on the amount of olive oil as recommended by other reviews.

I made this for a baby shower and it was a huge hit. I even forgot to put the Kalamata Olives on top and it still was great. Easy and elegant, I will make again.

I made this with black kalamata olives instead, and it was soooo good! I cut back the olive oil to about 3 tbsp like other reviews had suggested and used 2 real anchovys mashed up. The purple color is beautiful.

Every last crostini eaten at my cocktail party. Very easy, and definitely didn't miss the extra oil. Next time I would make it spicier, to suit my personal preference.

I've made this twice and it is a great hit. I substituted Cajun spicy olives instead of the red pepper and it is wonderful. I agree with previous reviewers that you can cut back on the olive oil.

I have made this recipe twice and it has been a HUGE hit each time. The spiciness adds a pleasant surprise. I set the olivada out as a spead and didn't use the kalamata olives on top. I used colossal Sicilian olives and added only 3 T. of olive oil in the processor as recommended by other reviewers.

This was very good. I made this on the spur of the moment and therefore had to substitute Kalamata olives for the green olives. I also decreased the olive oil by a third. Otherwise it would have been way too oily. I was skeptical about the anchovy paste versus using real anchovies, but it tasted just fine.

Made it for my book club--the theme was Italian--and everyone liked it. A great marrying of the olive and garlic flavors.

I served this for 6 people and it was totally sucked up. I used gourmet green olives and threw in an additional handful. I was tempted to not use the anchovy paste, but it really makes it tast e better. It only enhances the flavor. I didn't bother with the chopped olives on top though. It was really yummy!!!

I made a double batch using good Greek olives packed in water. Needed less olive oil than called for (perhaps 'cause I doubled it). Got incredible response from most everyone at the party - all was consumed. It was very easy and can be prepared in advance. What more could you ask?

Mine was too salty. I will use gourmet olives next time instead of those from the grocery store.
