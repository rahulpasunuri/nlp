I thought this was a great way to use up potatoes from the holidays. Different from regular old potato dishes. I boiled the two potatoes together, and only used 3 slices of bacon. Leftovers were yummy too.

My friends enjoyed this recipe but I wasn't impressed, I was a little disapointed because it sounded tasty. I found the dish tasted too much like bacon and was missing the flavors of the other ingredients.

Made this dish with a "gourment" meatloaf (oxymoron?) and everybody raved about the potatoes. My recommendation would be to increased the cream content but that's b/c I'm addicted to cholesterol

This has become a Thanksgiving staple at our house. The men are not bell pepper fans, so I leave it out and add a bit more onion. Still delicious!

My 13 year old son and husband thought it was delicious, I did not like it. It had the flavors of a potato soup, which I don't like. My son and husband are potato soup fans and liked it very much.

Great recipe and a nice change from the usual potato recipes. I had it with some beef and a carrot, apple and horseradish salad: delicious! Just mind the amount of cream, since there is also bacon in it. It shouldn't be too rich.

I did not make this as a side dish, instead, I made it for a Christmas brunch. It went well with the egg dishes that were served. Everyone really liked this dish, and it was easy to prepare. I would make this again.

Fabulous! Delicious and easy to prepare. I doubled the cream however. It is colorful and looked lovely on the table. Definitely a new family favorite.

I made this last week with a roasted chicken. Delicious!! My guests could not stop raving about this dish. The flavors were wonderful. A nice change from the traditional potato dish. To save time, I boil the sweet and white potatoes at the same time in separate pots. Great recipe! Leftovers were also delicious!
