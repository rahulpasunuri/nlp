That was quite bad. Stodgy and bland. Do not attempt.

We make this as a special before school breakfast as one large pancake in a cast iron skillet. Works especially well if you preheat the cast iron skillet for just a few moments (can use it to melt the butter). We have substituted orange juice for the lemon and low fat milk for the whole with great success. My family's favorite!

Always requested for breakfast when my daughter has slumber parties. The kids love 'em. Sometimes I use Granny Smiths instead of Goldens for a little more "spark" on the palate.

This has been a staple Sunday brunch breakfast since the recipe came out in the magazine. I don't make individual dishes but put it in one large dish--it takes longer to bake but the presentation is fabulous. I get requests for this from all of our friends and family.

As suggested by others, I sauted the apples with the sugar and butter, added some vanilla to the batter, and sprinkling cinnamon on top. Double the cooking time. They will be a little brown on top, but I think it's better than having them turn out eggy. The topping was yummy, but the actual pancake was a little too bland. I think I will add a little bit of sugar to the batter next time. The presentation was beautiful. The serving size is not very big so we served it alongside eggs, bacon and fruit salad. The guests were impressed.

These are similar to a Dutch pancake served at some resturants in this area. I made these this morning for Sunday Breakfast. I made the "pancakes" as stated except I added a pinch of salt and 1T of sugar. I baked without the apples. For the apples, I sliced the apples and while the pancakes were cooking I sauted them in 1T butter, 1/4 c. brown sugar, 1 t of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla. Then when the pancakes came out I served the apples over the pancakes. The only thing I was a little disapointed in was that the pancakes seemed to be solid and not have a steam hole like popovers or yorkshire pudding, which they basically are. However, they were delicious and I will make again.

Yummy! I added 1 TBSP vanilla to the batter and sprinkled additional brown sugar over apples. Granished it with a fanned strawberry. Beautiful presentation. Will make again!

These things were great! I poured the excess brown sugar mixture over the tops. A little powdered sugar on top, a small dish of hot maple syrup and some fresh fruit made this a great presentation. They really give the impression that you did a lot of work. The cooking time was too short though. Just watch till you get a good brown top after they puff.

Will add this to my file of decadent breakfasts along with Creme Brulee French Toast. The tip below regading the non-stick spray is a good one.

HELLO! Where was the pancake! CALL IT A POPOVER!!! VERY DISAPPOINTING. I, for some reason was interested in a pancake that I could bake in the oven, rather than standing over it during breakfast. This way, I could tend to everything else. In addition, it wasn't a very good POPOVER!

This has become a staple in our household. One suggestion though, spray the ramekins before adding the melted butter. The pancakes will easily fall out, making the presentation that much better.

I thought this recipe was excellent. I also cooked the apples in butter and sugar in a single pan and poured the batter over. Next time I will use a bigger skillet, it puffed up so big it alsmost fell over the sides! It makes an impressive brunch served with bacon and a field green salad.

this was good, but a little hrd to cook

This dish was so tasty! I have some big eaters in my family, so one little "puff" was not enough to suit their appetites. I had to make at least two per person. Also, I added some cinnamon to the melted butter and on top of the pancake batter before putting them in the oven. These taste very similar to the apple pancakes at the Original Pancake House for those of you who know the restaurant.

I made the following modifications to this recipe: - omitting the lemon juice, I sauteed the apple in 2T butter and the sugar in a 10 inch oven-proof skillet until caramelized (+-5 minutes) - I mixed the batter (all ingredients at room temp. + 1t vanilla) in a blender and then poured over the apple and baked in pre-heated oven for 15 mins. Sprinkled with cinnamon and served. - Pretty good!

I made this for brunch and it was a complete hit. People thought it was very time consuming and that I spend hours in the kitchen.....not so but they don't need to know that. I served it with fresh friut salad ..tasty.

I, too, had the flan-like results. Maybe it's because I used 1% milk? Willing to try it again and hope for the puff

Fabulous breakfast for a sunday morning. Fairly simple to prepare, but so tasty and creamy. Will make this again and again.

15 minutes was not enough to fully cook this dish. It came out like an over done flan. Way too eggy. We ended up cooking them in a skillet. They looked and tasted like scrambled eggs. Just proves that bacon and syrup make just about anything taste good. mmmm bacon.

My husband loved this! On a scale of 1 to 10 he gave it a 9. The presentation was awesome. The flavor great. I will definately make it again.

This recipe is very similar to one I have been making for years. Although we do several variations, most of the time I saute a pealed apple in a little butter, add brown sugar and cinnamon, and sometimes nuts. I forgo the rest of the butter. The flour, milk, and egg proportions are the same.

THis is any easy recipe with tasty results, I would definitely make it again.

I thought the pancakes tasted too "egg-y" - I would rather just make a souffle. For a garnish, I liked a fanned strawberry on top of each cake.

There are plenty of low-fat pancake recipes out there. Why make this artery-clogging one?

These are so easy to prepare but really make a great presentation - individual souffle-like puffed pancakes. =They are so delicious and will have your guests swooning - I promise!!!
