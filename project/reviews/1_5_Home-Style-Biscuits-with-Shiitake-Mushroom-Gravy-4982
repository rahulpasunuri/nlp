This is way too much thyme. I used dried and it was so much, it added texture! I would cut the amt. of thyme in half, unless you're using fresh.

I made this recipe with Portabella mushrooms sans the thyme and madeira. I sauteed 2 small minced cloves of garlic and 1/2 Tablespoon of minced red onion to the melter butter before adding the mushroom that I finely chopped. When the mushrooms were tender I added the flour, vegetable broth and added some cream to richen the gravy. Dlish.

Why on earth would you use those horrible tube biscuits when you've spent all that money on mushrooms??? Nope, wouldn't make this one again!!

Gravy was too intense - mushrooms and herbs were too much to handle.
