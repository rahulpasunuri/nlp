This was a real let-down for me. My husband says they're edible. Which isn't a very rave review. There's no flavor, even though they marinated overnight. Sorry.

Made these as an appetizer for Christmas and they were the first thing gone! They made for a beautiful presentation (look very sushi-like), but even my 7 and 9 year old ate them. Everyone was disappointed that I did not make more and made me promise to bring them to every family gathering from now on. I made them a day and a half in advanced and simply sliced before serving. Worked great.

To the cook in Australia, Saran Wrap is like regular cling wrap. Good luck with the recipe!

I am considering making this dish - but could someone please tell me what saran wrap is? Is it like regular clingfilm wrap? Thanks.

Very good recipe...looks like sush when sliced. I used red peppers already prepared in a jar with olive oil...improvised the marinade since I didn't have all the ingredients..soja, garlic, a bit of honey...marinated overnight. Should have steamed for 3.5 minutes...keeps cooking while cooling and turned out a bit dry. Everybody loved it anyway...Bon Apetit!

I prepared this recipe for a church function of 200 people. Very large free-range chicken breast were used. Flattening with a meat mallet took some time. Heavy duty Saran wrap worked best for the flattening process. Flavors were awesome and the pieces cut on the bias were served and black slate rectangles for great visual focus - both the scallions and red pepper strips retained their bright colors. Next to the homemade chocolate truffles this was the hit of the evening. For home entertaining I will compose a salad using five slices (one roll) and dress it with seasoned rice wine, canola oil with just a dash of Frank's hot sauce.
