This was OK - the spices made the sauce a bit overly grainy, and it was too sweet for me. I will use this as a jumping off point and add onions, garlic, ginger, tomatoes/tomato paste if I attempt it again. I would have the sugar and vinegar as well. I didn't get the slightly charred bottom the recipe called for using my cast iron enamelled french oven. Perhaps this affected my results?

I also made this as written (except accidentally more cardamom). Loved it, and I'm usually not a huge eggplant fan. It was so creamy and sweet, a nice foil to the spicier cucumber raita & lentils with rice we had with.

Different. Easy on the sugar and vinegar. Add red pepper flakes for a bit of zip. Serve with rice, couscous, etc. and a side of greens (kale, chard, spinach, collards, etc.) I'm making it again this week for a gathering of organic eaters. Hope they like it.

I made this twice. the first time i eliminated the vinegar, and it was a bit too sweet. the second time, i added red onion and cayenne with the spice mix, cut the sugar by half and elimated the vinegar, and it was perfect. i made some sauteed collards on the side and some rice and was very happy with it- and it was really easy to make. i'm a novice cook so that's really important- a dish that's hard to screw up!

yum! i am always looking for a new eggplant recipe, because i love eggplant! this was quick and easy and delicious. (quick and easy is a must when cooking for one (for me)). i added some red pepper flakes. i could cut back on the vinegar and sugar next time. i ate it served over couscous, but if i had access to some yogurt, i would eat it with that, too.

I didn't have a terrific result with this recipe. It was ok.

This was very easy and tasted great!! The only change I made was that I used 2 small white skin eggplant and 1 small purple skin.

I made this for a weeknight dinner and it was delicious, quick and easy to make. I tossed in a can of garbanzo beans to make it a one-dish meal and topped with yogurt and cilantro. My boyfriend said it was his favorite dinner I'd ever made...high praise for a vegetarian dish from a meat lover!

This was unbelievably delicious. I was skeptical during the cooking process--there was a point at which it looked distinctly like sludge--but in the end, it was amazing (albeit a little scary looking). Very easy, too.

The taste of this dish was wonderful. I am on a diet & had to exchange sugar for 1/2 tsp. of Stevia, used 1 tbl unsalted butter, left out the fresh coriander, added a pinch of red pepper flakes and cooked this in a non- stick pan. Otherwise I followed to the letter, I am making it again today.

The taste of this dish was really bad. I adore eggplants, and love all of the spices, but they do not get well together somehow.

Simply terrific. I actually followed the recipe as written (what a concept!) & both my husband (who's not a big eggplant fan) & I loved it. I particularly liked the touch of sweetness that the sugar brings playing off all the other spices.

I made this with some tomatoes and onions, like another reviewer suggested, and it was great. I would add more of all the spices next time, because they are great. I also added some dried red chili for some spice. I agree that more salt was needed, perhaps salting the eggplant would do the trick. It was a great left over too!

I added enough eggplant and zucchini to make this an entree with garlic/ginger basmati. I let it sit for a few hours before dinner and the condensation made a delicious sauce for the rice. We did need a little salt, next time I'll salt the eggplant before I start.

A nice side dish to grilled tandoori chicken. I used a mixture of zucchini and eggplant and added some chopped onion and diced tomato. I also added a little curry paste for some heat. It changed the recipe but I'm sure it's great as printed as well. Don't skimp on the spices (except the sugar - you don't need it).

I thought this dish was simple to make and delicious. I added onions and tomatoes to the dish.

This is...different. Not bad, but if I make it again I will decrease the salt by half. It's sweet and carmelized, the flavor is complex and pretty interesting. It would probably be good with roasted meat or poultry.

Yumm...I thought this was easy, yummy and sweet. It was my first time not ruining eggplant.

Very easy to make and delicious. I made it for a dinner party, and everyone requested the recipe. I thought the vinegar was needed, and I didn't have cardamon but it tasted fine. Not a colorful dish, so I'd be sure to have other color on the plate.

pickled eggplant was not what i was looking for... not good, the black colour was very unattractive.

Pretty good, though our super-charged chicken curry overwhelmed the eggplant completely.. next time i am going to try just a bit more coriander, cloves and cardamom, and a bit less liquid... and try to get slightly firmer eggplant... and serve with a milder main dish.

A good dish.I make it often,but always add some red chilli powder.(I noticed that it was missing in this recipe.)Also, i have never added vinegar and i usually cook it in groundnut oil and not ghee.Hmm...maybe i'll try this version for a change!Happy cooking!Bye.

I thought this was tasty -- although I think next time I will use the whole spices instead of the crushed ones -- it was a bit "gritty" this way. I added a dried red chili to heat it up a bit.

I thought it was good but my husband said it was delicious. I would make it again because the recipe was easy and it is a different way to fix eggplant. Perhaps using Garam Masala would make the recipe go quicker.

The eggplant was tasty and smooth. It was quite easy to make.

I love eggplant, but this dish just wasn't interesting. I'm surprised because I usually love the recipes I find at this site.

Eggplant is a wonderfully versatile vegetable and we love it in many different manifestations. This is one of the very best. The spice combination is delicate yet complex. Perfect the way it is. Nonetheless, next time I will add a pinch of cayenne to give it a little extra pizzazz.
