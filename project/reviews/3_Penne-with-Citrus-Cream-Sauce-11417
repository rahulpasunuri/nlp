This recipe could be sublime -- if given a major overhaul. It would be immeasurably improved with a light, delicate cream *sauce* -- instead of just dumping in undiluted heavy cream (which is also probably what produces the "gag" response; simmering cream, like scalded milk, is not a happy smell). I'd also lose the chunks of citrus fruit, unless you enjoy things like broiled grapefruit. A very light cream sauce enhanced with the juice of grapefruit & oranges -- THAT would make this dud a dream!

Years ago my roommate made this and I never forgot it. Over time, I concocted my own version as it is truly delicious and surprising. I've make it for family and friends during the ensuing years and can honestly say that every single one has loved it. For some added color, I like to use blood oranges along with the pink grapefruit and the navel oranges.

Well....my husband clapped his hand over his mouth and acted like he was going to barf. I liked it tho. I guess I'd make it again, but only for me.

As a lover of both pasta and citrus, I was very much looking forward to this recipe. Expecting a lite, smooth taste that would be perfect for a summer dish. Unfortunately, it was not to be. It see-sawed between a dessert-like pasta salad and an honest to goodness main dish. It was better when we pushed the pieces of citrus to the side and ate just the pasta, but even then only on of our group could finish it. The idea seemed so good, (as was the smell) but the application was awful.

Have been making this dish since it was first printed. We love it.
