great biscuits, made a few changes, used all butter, more cheese, was out of milk, so I added some water to sour cream and used that as my liquid, added great tang. and used rosemary and scallions instead of dill, chives. Delish..nice and flakey.

Very bland and too much flour. I may not have used enough cheese. I also did not sprinkle cheese on top, which may have been the reason why it tasted like cardboard. I also added other herbs and I couldn't really taste anything but a little hint of chives.

great biscuits... I didnt however sprinkle the extra 1/2 cup of cheese on the top. I added dried thyme and a few other herbs to the dough, also a touch of grated fresh garlic. When serving I sliced them a placed deli smoked ham slices inside. Great tea sandwiches instead of plain sliced white bread. Guests raved!! very good!

Very good and savory. Great split in half with additional cheddar and heated.

I love these biscuits and am frequently asked to bring them to cookouts, picnics, etc. As with most biscuits, though, they are high in fat. I omit the 1/2 cup of cheese sprinkled on top of the biscuits because I find the overly browned cheese unpleasant.
