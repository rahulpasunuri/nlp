This was fantastic -- hands down! I made this recipe for Valentine's Day with steak, and I think my carnivorous husband liked these better. I will definitely make again. The possibilities are infinite -- replace the bread with rice, add basil, add eggplant, etc.

Loved this- doubled the recipe for a BBQ party and everyone liked it. Very different from the usual side dish and goes great with grilled meats. Peeling the peppers takes some time (especially when you double the recipe), but it's worth it. Definitely will make again!

I used a focaccia baguette instead (only 1 I could find on short notice) and it added extra flavour. Will make again with the same type of baquette. Very good side dish.

I made this as a side dish to go with the chicken with roasted lemons, green olives and capers from this site. This dish received rave reviews, from the 20 people at my table! Everyone wanted the recipe. The only change I made was to cut the pepper halves into quarters after roasting and peeling them. I then layered them as the recipe called for. This made it easier to serve and eat.

This is absolutely the best side dish ever. The combination of the crispy bread crumbs and the peppers is wonderful. Perfect recipe as written.
