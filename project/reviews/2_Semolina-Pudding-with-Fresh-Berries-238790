Changes: Reduce butter by half Reduce sugar by 1/4 Lemon and Orange extract pinch of salt Result: I have to say after the first step of making the semolina pudding I had to hold back from just eating it - it was so warm and comforting with delicious citrus flavor. I'm not sure that the "souffle-ing" process did anything for it. It did not come out any lighter or puff up or anything. It could have been that adding all the sugar to the egg whites deflated them. The result was good - like a cake. But next time I'll save the effort and just make semolina pudding and eat it while it's soft and hot.
