I could only scrape out 13 mini cupcakes -- not the 2 dozen it claims to make. I did not halve the recipe. Luckily we only needed a couple to mark my daughter's birthday. The cupcakes are dense -- almost like a bread. We all enjoyed them but some people may prefer a more typical lighter fluffier cake. Based on other reviews, I added a touch more vanilla and found them to be just right in terms of sweetness. Whatever the cupcake lacks in sweetness, can easily be made up by the frosting.

Great recipe. Doubled the recipe and made 24 regular sized cupcakes, took about 6 minutes longer in the oven but they came out great. I put twice the vanilla it asked for, but other than that, followed everything exactly (using a stand mixer). I recommend this recipe.

Finally! I have been looking for a simple yet delicious mini cupcake recipe for two days now!! I found this recipe, it took me 15 minutes to make and was quick to bake. My family loved them and I know that these will definitley be a personal and family favorite for a while. Thank You so much epicurious.com!!! :)

I like this recipe a lot because it is almost like a rich cookie . It is less fluffy and more buttery . It is easy to make and I have made it a few times for that reason .

I find this is a good base recipe for when I really want to play around. It is a sturdy cupcake, dense and doesn't rise too much. I make these full size and include a fruit filling before baking or mix frozen diced fruit into the batter. These are fabulous with a little ganache topping too. Don't get too freaked out if they look a little small or puck-like, next time put more batter in the cup and remember they will be cuter once you add a topping

I make my boyfriend cupcakes every week and I had been using a different recipe. I decided to try these just to see if there was a difference. The batter was really thick, so I had to add more milk. I usually double the vanilla as well, and these cupcakes were so bland, and they definitely were not moist at all just dry and spongy. I had been using the Amy Sadaris' Vanilla Cupcakes recipe, that one, in my opinion, was much better.

I LOVED this recipe! These cupcakes turned out perfectly (although I did double the vanilla). I also made a simple syrup (equal parts sugar and water, boil until sugar dissolves) and painted it over the cupcakes while they were still hot. This makes them more moist and last longer without getting dry. Also, I made these into regular size cupcakes the second time, without the syrup. They turned out really yummy (of course you have to bake them about 6 minutes longer). Sub the milk with lemon juice and add the zest of two lemons, and YUM: You have yummy lemon cupcakes:-)

These are some of the weirdest cupcakes I've ever made. flavourless and just rather bland. I even bumped up the vanilla a lot more then what the recipe asks for and they were still flavorless. The batter was really thick so I ended up having to add a lot more milk just to be able to get it into the cups. I won't be making these again.

The batter tasted great but I think there is something wrong with this recipe. I think it is missing flour by maybe another cup. These never baked, it was a mess. I had made the chocolate cake with the buttercream for my daughter's Birthday and wanted to decorate it with these. I ended up making another batch of a different recipe quickly like an hour before the party started!! This cupcakes nearly gave me a heart attack. Terrible recipe.

delicious! Everyone loved them! I used store bought funfetti frosting because i didn't feel like making any and they went together perfectly! When i make these, i double the vanilla. If you thing yours are bland or lack flavor, try this!

They were OK. Kind of dry w/o much flavor. Maybe I cooked them too long. Probably will not make them again

These were absolutely heavenly!!! I am surprised by some of the other reviews. I followed the recipe closely and ended up with a light, fluffy cake. The only difference was that I halved the ingredience (just needed a dozen) and used a bit of coconut extract instead of the vanilla for both the cake and the buttercream, which, by the by, is out of this world. If you have the time to mess with it, DO! It is well worth the effort. I will definetely revisit this recipe frequently!

i'm not sure if i did something really wrong (i just looked through the recipe again and didn't find any ingredient i forgot), but my cupcakes turned out really dry. i will try again and, if the batter seems so dry again, i will add a little more water or a bit of oil. the taste was great, though! however, i prefer a chocolate cupcake to the extremely vanilla-y frosting!

They tasted good enough, but they were a bit soggy at the bottom even though they were fully cooked, and stuck to the liners even when cooled. Wouldn't make these again.

Yummy mini-cupcakes, but the buttercream frosting is a must. Easy cupcakes -- will make them again -- but if I had to choose between making these or making a cake for a special occasion, I'd still gofor the cake. I made bth for my 2-year-old's birthday party.

I made full sized cupcakes with this batter rather than mini ones and I can see why mini is recommended. It is a very dense, rich cake. I rarely have trouble finishing a cupcake and this one was a struggle. The accompanying buttercream had excellent flavor but it was a little less firm than I like. The taste of the buttercream was one of the best I've ever had.

SUPER, anybody who didn't like these are just plain CRAZY! They were light which made them taste fantastically superior to too many other nasty cupcake recipes using gross ucky cream cheese...grossness!I would say for anybody this is THE cupcake recipe you don't have to look any farther. I was just thinking actually of making another batch of these cupcakes and making the cake as well, maybe I'll do that in chocolate...that might be cool actually! OMG so sweet! By the way whenever your making frosting for your cupcakes don't ever use cream cheese cause it is also very nasty when used in frosting. An excellent job on the recipe folks and keep up the good work. By the way I tried Martha stewarts cupcake recipe, It had 6 eggs, ewww and they turned out so greasy and gross that I ended up throwing them out so trust epicurious and not Martha because she doesn't know how to make cupcakes...take my word for it. anyways as I blab on great job on the reecipe and keep up the great work, oh whoops I just said that oh well. Two thumbs up!

I made thses for the second time. They are really moist, airy cakes - not much to them. They do not keep well, as the author states. Eat them soon after you cook them. I topped them with black and white frosting from another recipe. I'll continue to look for THE vanilla cupcake recipe

These have wonderful vanilla flavour if you use pure vanilla extract. They are a nice light (almost white) colour, which is what I was looking for. I used cake and pastry flour instead of all purpose, so they rose up nice and fluffy. I did not find them greasy at all.

These were perfect for taking to school for birthdays, very easy and the kids loved them. We are doing them again for my son's birthday today!!

I needed vanilla cupcakes for my boys and this recipe was great. Easy to make, great texture and delicious. This is our new vanilla cupcake recipe of choice. One word of advice...they taste best the day they are made, so go ahead and eat up!

I made this recipe twice using a regular size cupcake pan (yeild 8-9). The cupcakes had a great texture - light and relatively moist the next morning but the flavor was so delicate it was overwhelmed by the icing. This might be a good recipe to substitute with orange liquor or other liquor in place of vanilla.

This went perfectly with the chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream. We loved the cupcakes and used fewer on the cake because we snacked on them. I would gladly make these again.

Made these for a children's Xmas party. They were good the night I made them - did not keep until the next day at all - I found nothing special about this one.

I made these into average-size cupcakes and they came out very greasy and spongy (no I didn't over mix!). As someone who bakes a lot I was pretty dissapointed in these. Still searching for a good basic vanilla cupcake recipe...

A very good, very easy cupcake recipe, which calls for simple ingredients. The vanilla flavor is pretty smooth. I didn't have a mini-muffin pan and I just had 12 average cupcakes.

Absolutely perfect cupcake! I didn't want to wake my baby so beat everything by hand, way less than 4 minutes (my arm couldn't make it) and they were so light, sweet, buttery and moist. Topped them with a cream cheese frosting b/c I didn't want to use uncooked egg whites and really didn't have the time for such an elaborate frosting. Used regular cupcake pan and yielded 10 large cupcakes.
