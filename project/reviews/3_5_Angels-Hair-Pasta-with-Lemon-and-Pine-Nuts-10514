This was a light and simple side dish. I added a handful of baby arugula to the garlic/lemon juice mixture and added the pine nuts at the end. Served along side Sauteed Sea Scallops with Mustard Sauce from this website. Delicious!

Simple, wonderful comfort food. So easy, yet so good. I served this with chicken cutlets with fried capers, also on this site; they paired perfectly. I toasted the pine nuts in a dry skillet before cooking the garlic, increased the lemon juice to 3 Tbl, and garnished the whole thing with more zest. Ill also try it with shrimp and asparagus, as others have suggested.

I changed this a bit, but came up with awesome results. Sauteed almonds, garlic, lemon zest, then added a bit of flour and lemon juice / white wine to make the sauce. Then added the cooked pasta and parsley. Awesome as main course for a light dinner or as a side for fish!

good, but nothing really special...tastes like a lemony version of scampi. I think it needs more "sauce"...added a little clam juice and a little wine plus a few red pepper flakes for kick.

Very easy. Very good. Doubles well. Served three hungry 20 somethings with a little left over.

I thought this was pretty good. I added a few things to spice it up - shrimp, chili flakes and asparagus. I think it would be pretty plain if you didn't add something. Very easy to make.

This is a very simple but tasty side dish.

Prepared it as per the recipe using a whole grain spaghetti, to accompany grilled salmon, grill-roasted green beans & sautéed grape tomatoes. It was a nice, simple side dish as is, but would lend itself well to variations and additional ingredients.

I turned this into a light main dish for summer by suateeing shrimp and asparagus in with the garlic. Also added a little chili oil in with the olive, which gave it a kick... probably like adding the red pepper flakes.

Nice for a side dish, but I wouldn't rate it over the top. I added the crushed red pepper. Good flavor.

Incredibly easy to make, and simply delicious. I served it as the main dish, along with lightly steamed asparagus and freshly grated Parmesan on the side. Everyone asked for the recipe. Just as nice at room temperature, too. I will definitely make this again.

I loved this. I cooked it as a side dish for a meal that served 20+ people. It was a highlight of the meal. I did add a few ingrediants-love adding additional things to a recipe. I added hot pepper flakes when I sauteed the garlic in oil. I also added feta-this added a wonderful saltiness. Lastly I didn't have enough pine nuts so I added toasted almonds. Also threw in a little of the pasta cooking water to help all of the ingrediants adhere to the pasta. I described the dish as zingy and delicious-it seemed everyone else agreed and a bunch asked for the recipe.

Loved it. The lemon was fresh and flavorful, the garlic & pine nuts all in perfect proportion. We added some steamed asparagus and it was a terrific side dish with some grilled lamb chops.

This is a wonderful starter recipe; you can add ingredients depending on what's in your frig. Tonight I added broccoli. My husband loved it and my kids loved it too and they are 3,3, and 6, so very picky.

Really enjoyed this recipe. Added shrimp, spinach and a small amount of parm. cheese. It was very light but flavorful!

I planned to serve this as a main dish, but once I finished making it, I thought it needed something else so I sauteed some shrimp in garlic and olive oil and added it along with sea salt and fresh ground black pepper. This is a good recipe to experiment with since it's so basic. I plan to make it with the shrimp and asparagus as recommended in an earlier review.

This is a great little easy recipe for a guy like me living alone. The combination of the lemon zest and the pine nuts is wonderful. I sometimes add a tablespoon or so of capers, for a little more zing.

We love this recipe. Double or triple it to enjoy as a main course. Perfect for guests. Sometimes we even add a bag -- or two, depending on how much we're making -- of baby spinach. Excellent!

My boyfriend and I made this last night and it turned out marvelously. I am usually not a big fan of pasta but I couldn't stop eating this! The flavor was light and a perfect antidote to the Louisiana heat. We doubled it and served it as the main dish, but other than that there were no alterations.

I had this with flounder filets and the lemon was a perfect match for the fish. And the flavors were subtle enough not to overpower the flavor of the flounder. I doubled the recipe and I also cheated a bit by adding a Tablespoon of concentrated pesto paste and some parmesan cheese tossed into it. Even after the doctoring though, I'm not so sure the flavors of this dish would be strong enough to stand up to something other than seafood. Therefore the 3 forks. YUM.

I thought this was good (and VERY easy) but my husband thought it was too lemony. I think I would reduce the amount of zest next time. I served it warm as it's still wintery here, but I will try it again this summer when I think it would be very refreshing served at room temp. The tiny amount of cooking needed (especially if you use fresh pasta) will make it a good dish for hot summer days.

Was afraid the recipe wouldn't have much flavor and kept "extras" at the side just in case. None were needed - this was excellent, refreshing, subtle. I added more toasted pine nuts and garlic, just because I like both - delicious1

This is a very rustic italian pasta dish. It's light and not heavily spiced, so it is no wonder cooks are used to very salty food find it wanting. I found it sublime in its very delicate flavors.

I thought this was great. I served it as a side dish to a variation of the "Clambake without the Sand" recipe which appeared recently in the New York Times. Guests loved it and very easy. I have vegetarian company coming tonight and I think I'll just do some grilled vegetables with it.

I very much liked this recipe and made it recently for a party for forty people. However, I used dried mint instead of parsley and served it over rigatoni (my favorite pasta) since I thought it would hold up better.

This is not a bad pasta dish, but I, like several other reviewers, found something to be missing. It was light and lemony, but I found myself adding a lot of salt and pepper and parmesan cheese to give it some flavor. I'll probably make it again because it's soooo easy but will try adding other ingredients- like the ones suggested by other reviewers (sun-dried tomatoes, chicken, etc.). It might also go well with tuna and some black olives.

Rating: 1
Something definitely was missing from this dish. All I can really say about it is that it was edible. This is the first dish from this site in which I was truly disappointed. All I can figure from the other reviewers who actually liked this is that they must have done some major dressing up of this recipe. Please, don't make this recipe as is.

I really enjoyed this pasta dish. I think I basically took the idea and created my own dish though. I used sun-dried tomatoes and basil instead of parsley. I sauteed some chicken in some garlic, pepper, olive oil, lemon juice, and lemon zest and added that. I took the suggestion about a more substantial sauce. I used the garlic and olive oil but added low sodium chicken broth, milk, and a rue to thicken as a base. It was a little creamy and the lemon was still center stage.

I have made this about 6 times now. It's a great recipe to have as a main dish or side dish. I have added shrimp, spinach, parsley and parmesan cheese in different amounts and each time it has turned out. It's very light. I used toasted almonds instead of pine nuts and have used angel hair and orzo pasta. I used orzo and served it as a side dish with grilled salmon. Everyone loved it.

I made this dish twice, and both times I felt it was missing something. I was interested in it because I had had a lemon pasta at the Maidstone Arms in East Hampton, New York about 5 or so years ago and loved it. I had never seen it again, the that chef is long gone. It was soupier and seriously delicious. This didn't take care of that need...perhaps you can find that reciepe for me, I know everyone would love it. Thanks so much

I added onion to the garlic and topped the finished dish with crisp prosciutto and still thought it was only so so.

Very good in its own right...also a versatile base for experimentation. I added shrimp and asparagus tips to transform this into an easy, elegant main dish. Don't skimp on the lemon juice!

Wonderful for a first course or light main course. I actually used whole wheat pasta and it was really good. I too, didn't mash the pine nuts. I will make this again soon.

I've been making this dish for years, but without the parsley and, instead, adding a bunch of asparagus, cut in 3/4" diagonals, sauteed until crisp tender. It's WONDERFUL!!!! I bet it would be great with the shrimp AND asparagus!

I thought this was great. I made it into a main dish by stir frying chicken in butter/margarine and I did not mash up the pine nuts. My family thought it was great.

We added tarragon in place of half of the parsley, creating a very 'unique' flavor. Although it some getting used to, we liked it quite a bit.

Half a lemon yielded 3 tbsps on juice so IN IT ALL WENT. Used 1 tbsp of chopped green onions instead of parsley. Very summery and lemony. Quick and easy. Going to be a menu staple. Required the addition of the water +plus+ the extra tablespoon of lemon juice. I don't rinse and drain the pasta before putting it into the sauce. Second helping added parmesan and it completely overwelmed all the other flavours (note to self: next time, no parmesan)

My husband said this meal was 5 star. We made this by the recipe exactly and added shromp at the end just before tossing with the pasta. A very nice combination of flavors and quick and easy to make. Do try this one.

I would make this dish again, however it needs some major change. The pine nuts and lemon are a wonderful mixture, but I found the dish to dry. Needs more of a sauce to coat the pasta.

I make this a lot - especially in summer. It's a terrific side dish to simply grilled fish or chicken, or to veal dishes like veal marsala. It's even good eaten cold as a side salad - even though I keep forgetting the small amount of cooking water! A great substitute for potatoes or rice.

This is Really good. I used 12 oz of pasta and doubled everything else, subbing basil for the parsley and adding sundried tomatoes. I made it for my brother because it's vegan (it doesn't need parmesan) and he loved it. Otherwise I might add goat cheese.

This is fab. Use good pasta, because the simplicity and subleties of flavour make you notice and appreciate the pasta.

I make this recipe when I am feeling monastic. It's very spare and simple, and thus easy to prepare, but it is also very tasty. I tend to go a little wild with the lemon zest, and I don't add the parsley. Sometimes I add a little minced basil. Oh yeah, that parmesan is a must (but the pasta water is not)

Rating: 3
Ate it warm with a good sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan and was generous with the salt and pepper. Won't bother with the addition of the pasta water next time.
