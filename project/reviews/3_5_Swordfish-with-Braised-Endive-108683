I made the endive (sans swordfish) according to the directions-- caramelized it just right-- but the outcome was just too bitter for me. Maybe it's personal preference, as I've seen other recipes that call for caramelizing endive, but I think caramel (which introduces bitterness) accentuates the bitterness in the vegetable, despite what I've read about those the same family as endive. (My endives were very mildly bitter before cooking.) Too bad.

I only made the braised endive in this recipe. It was delicious! I was confused by the instructions to cut the endive into 6 wedges length-wise. I might have had smaller than usual endive because cutting in sixths would have created very slender pieces. I quartered the endive length-wise and halved the smaller ones. The next time I make this recipe, I will separate the leaves once the water cooks off in order to create more surface area for carmelization. I was skeptical that braising might make it too soggy. It was very soft, yes, but the flavor was amazing.

I'm eating right now and it's so delicious I had to write. I had some small fresh figs so I quartered a bunch and added them while I was carmelizing the endive. YUM!

Can't figure out why this recipe has so many raves. Both swordfish and endive are favorites, but not this dish. Next time, I'll use any one of many better recipes for these expensive ingredients.

THis is a fantastic recipe. Simple, quick and delicious. I added some white wine to the braising fluid and served with white rice (cooked in chicken stock with ginger, garlic and cilantro). The mild bitterness of the endive was a perfect foil for the rich and slightly sweet flavor of teh swordfish. This will become part of my standard repetroire.

I added some fennel with the endive and it was a great addition. I wanted a little more substance to go with the fish, rather than making a side dish. It was really tasty. I also added some blood orange segments on top - a really nice complement to the fennel and endive. Light and simple, great combination of flavors. Will definitely make again.

I love this dish. I often make just the endive. Sometimes I substitute radicchio for endive if I need more color on the plate (because radicchio is more bitter, I double the sugar). Other firm-fleshed fish such as halibut are a nice substitute for the swordfish.

WARNING: This dish is DELICIOUS!!! It's true that swordfish contains more mercury than some other fish, but as long as you are not planning on or already pregnant, and as long as you're not eating it every single week, there is no danger. That being said, this dish looks and tastes like a more difficult-to-prepare dish than it really is.

I substituted the water with orange juice, halved the sugar and added fresh thyme leaves. Served the endives on top of the fish on top of a succulent pile of brown lentils. If I ate it in a restaurant I would want to meet the chef! That's how good it is!

This dish was very easy to make and was a hit with the family! Next time I will double the endives as people were asking for more!

Made this sans Swordfish. Wonderful: bitter, but sweet too, really quite easy and tasty. I expected my guests to be put off by the bitterness, but they all remarked how good it was.

I've only made the endive portion of this recipe - which is fantastic and easy to make. I added toasted walnuts and goat cheese, which made it into more of a salad. Even those who are turned off by the bitterness of endive will like this recipe.

A healty quick out of the ordinary weekday menu.Made it for two. I could have done a little better at braising of the Belgium Andive. Possibly not enough sugar? All in all we liked it a lot. Fish and vegetable a good combination. May try grilling the swordfish next time.
