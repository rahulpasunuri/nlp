This recipe was much more work than it was worth. I agree that the artichokes were tasty, but this was a lot of work for a side dish that really didn't have any flavor that couldn't have been achieved much easier.

this is a very good recipe, definitely use fresh artichokes, smaller is better, they cook faster and you can eat the choke. I made the entire menu for Passover two years ago and was delighted with the outcome. A great change of pace from traditional American Passover meals.

Gremolata was very flavorful, but overall recipe was time consuming. Substituted fresh asparagus for half the artichokes. Used frozen artichokes, which I added to the potatoes prior to final baking.

It's a lot of work for what you end up with. I used new potatoes and frozen artichokes and served this at passover. The artichoke lovers went for it but I thought it lacked punch. I probably will just opt for the potatoes and roasted garlic next year.

excellent combo of flavors -- the fresh plus roasted garlic, and the bright taste of lemon and parsley paired with slow-roasted potatoes is great. i substituted frozen artichoke bottoms (easier), which i added halfway through the potato baking time.

Easy to make and would be a wonderful company side dish.
