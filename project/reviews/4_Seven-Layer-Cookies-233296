Disaster in the kitchen! Watch out; it is very slippery transferring layers to the cookie sheet. My green layer ended up on the floor and there was no picking it up as it broke into many pieces. My dog enjoyed it... So, I have two layers. Not sure what to do. Anyway, the green layer was delicious with some apricot jam (well, obviously I picked some parts up off the floor and ate them...)

Forgot to mention in my previous review, that's way too much food coloring. It depends on how dark you want them. I use only 8 to 12 drops of each and like the outcome.

I make a similar version using a 9 x 11 pan, adjusting the measurements. Some solutions to the user comments: You can use Solo almond filling instead of paste so they're easier to mix. Doesn't change the recipe at all. When stacking, place plastic wrap in an empty pan enough to cover the tops when finished stacking. Easier to lift out for cutting. I use semisweet chocolate as well. Be sure to refrigerate for at least overnight with a heavy book on top for good adherence so they don't slide. Use parchment paper in the pans you cook them in and it's a little easier to maneuver placing them on top of each other. Also let the cookies come to room temperature before cutting so the chocolate doesn't crack. Easy to store the remainder in plastic wrap and cut when needed. Everyone loves these!

These are a family favorite that I've been baking for decades -- literally!! They are an Italian Christmas cookie known as Venetians and if I were to not make them, I would have an uprising on my hands. Family and friends can't wait for the week I start baking as I'll make several batches of these delicious cookies. I encourage anyone to give them a try, you'll be hooked. (But I have to disagree with the name -- besides I can only count six layers!)

These are great cookies (althouh really they are little mini cakes). Definitely don't use even half the amount of food coloring called for but other than that I follow the recipe to a "T". It is so much fun to play with the colors for other holidays - can't wait for Halloween! Also, to the cook who said their cookies slid, that is a result of either overbaking the layers or not weighting them long enough. Hope it is better next time!

Some of my favorite cookies. They taste a lot like seven-layer dip that you have for sporting events, like the polo championships. The only incident I had was once when I tried to double the recipe. Unfortunately it expanded width-wise, and I didn't get the 14 layer cookies that I was hoping for. The author should have make a note that this will be the outcome.

My compliments to the recipe author! Excellent! If you're organized, this becomes easy and fun to do. There's enough information from previous readers on how to improve the process. I'd definitely recommend gel color, and for us personally, we didn't like the bittersweet chocolate. Will try semi-sweet next time. Followed suggestion not to separate eggs. Worked out perfectly. Hardest part was flipping and stacking the cookie. I was too scared, so I let my husband do it. Baked between 8-9 minutes max, would not go longer otherwise it would have been too dry. Also, only kept in refrigerator for 1 hr. (8 hrs...really?) Used 1/4c cream in chocolate (also suggested), and didn't have any cracking issues when cutting. We also dusted ours with confec sugar, just for looks. :)

Wonderful. Don't be afraid to make a month ahead and refrigerate. They keep improving with age. The cookie I just ate is better than the one I ate last week and way better than the one I ate two weeks ago. I read all the reviews, which really helped. Thanks, Everyone, for invaluable suggestions, especially the last review from culinarygoddess. I followed goddess's advice and weighted the layered cookies with a baking pan and my two large Gourmet cookbooks---green cover and yellow cover. I left them like this in the refrigerator for three days. Then I did the chocolate layers, refrigerated overnight, sliced them into bars with an electric knife, refrigerated them in plastic containers, and served them throughout the holiday season. Received many compliments. People loved the dense texture, the contrasting flavors, and the not-too-sweetness. Natural food coloring from The Good Food Store produced pale pink and really pale green. Next year I am going for more brilliant dyes.

I make about 30 kinds of cookies for the holidays for my small catering business, and list AlWAYS includes these. This reipe goes much faster if you own three identical 9x13 pans - a pretty minimal and useful investment. To eliminate the problem of the layers slipping and the cookies falling apart, I weight the baking sheet on top with several cookbooks, and allow them to set for a couple days. The end result is firm and easily sliced. Also, don't trim the edges until AFTER you've done the chocolate layers - you'll have nice, clean, chocolate-free edges.

This recipe is not as difficult as it may appear and with little effort they will look as good as in the picture. BUT - my cookies would not stay together as they reached room temperature. The jam had them sliding apart. So, I can't give it a 4 forks rating. But I agree with the reviewer who said they had to work the almond paste and sugar together in a food processor. I don't see any other way to do it. My cakes came out of the oven in really good shape. The chocolate glazing worked out well. Although they are slightly expensive to make, I may try it again with a little less jam and see if they will stay together better.

Even though the 11 hour timing looks a little daunting, the majority of the time you are sitting back and letting the ingredients do the work. The final result was well worth the wait. These will definately be made again!

I started making these several years ago when I came upon the recipe on this site and saw all the great reviews. I LOVE this cookie--they are beautiful, make great gifts and stay moist. I pretty much follow the recipe, and it's part of my "cookie- baking frenzy" each year. I have a screened porch on the back of my house which serves as a great refrigerator in Ohio in December. So while one layer is chilling,another layer is baking etc. I always manage to save a few of these for myself-- they are yummy!

I'm an "I just follow the recipe and hope for the best" cook, but these cookies make people think I'm a baking genius. They are a pretty big, investment in time, but they are delicious and bring so much joy that I think they are worth the effort! I've tried not separating the egg whites, figuring the batter gets so manipulated that they must lose all their integrity, but the final product turned out denser and not quite as lovely. No one noticed but me, but I'll separate the whites from now on. Also, I tried the cream in the chocolate, which did keep the chocolate from cracking when cutting the cookies, but it makes it much harder to spread and it looks clumpy. I'll take my chances with cracking from now on, but use a warmed, wet knife!

Rating: 3
These are amazing! I have to say that mine look better than the photo! Maybe because they are diamond shaped and instead of the green layer, I made it purple (20 red drops, 5 blue) so they are pink, white, purple. I'm only giving 3 stars because the recipe makes this harder than it is. You don't have to separate the eggs and you don't need the whole jar of jam. I spreaded the jam as I would on toast--didn't use any special preserves or anything--rasberry jam. I did not have a fancy spatula so I just used a rubber spatula to spread the batter. It was a little tricky but fine. When you don't separate the eggs, the batter is thicker and harder to spread but don't be afraid, it is all wonderful in the end. It is best to freeze the layers after you spread the chocolate for 15 min so that cutting is easy. The hardest part is getting the paste all mixed in with the sugar. Maybe a food processor would have worked better than my hand mixer? or maybe using almond filling instead of the stiff paste? Anyways, I thought it was going to be terrible because I had made so many mistakes along the way but then I cut them and wow, they were tasty and beautiful

Rating: 2
These are fairly complicated. I would suggest to only add about half of the apricot preserves, since it tended to ooze out between the layers when I was cutting it up into small pieces. That said, I might actually spread the chocolate on when the cake was still fairly chilled, and cut it up soon afterwards. It looked perfect before I cut it, but the cutting kind of ruined it.

Rating: 4
Wonderful and they look like the picture when I finished. A few tips... -I have never tried to bake something "underdone" so my red layer was too wet. Make sure the layers just look dry. -I was worried after straining the appricot perserves that I didn't have enough left to spread, but it was fine. If I had followed my impulse and used more, the layers would have slid all over. -Definately warm the cake/knife before cutting (I also like the Ganache idea). -Butter the paper then put it in the pan -Wipe off the knife between each cut, or when it gets messy to keep the layers beautiful, My red tended to smear (of course it was too underdone) I'll definately do these again now that I practiced once.

Rating: 4
Made for the second time yesterday and still followed the recipe including the separation and this time I got a lighter batter (which is good). Also, better than the first time because I improved my techniques. I bought 3 Calphalon 9X13 brownie pans and an offset spatula to spread the batter. Much more even and easier than cleaning the pan each time. I also watched the oven more closely. As soon as I saw the cake set (no more gloss on the top), I took them out. Honestly, these are so good that whether they are perfectly even or not, they will be eaten!

Rating: 4
I made a major mistake on my first try with these, and they were still delicious! After I'd gently folded in my beautifully glossy egg whites, separated the batter into three bowls and added the food coloring, I realized I somehow had forgotten to put in the flour! I mixed it into each bowl, figuring my whites would be deflated and the whole thing would be ruined, but deciding to finish the cookies anyway. Much to my surprise, they still came out great! I made another batch - this time the right way - as a basis of comparison, and the only real difference was that the texture of the correctly made batch was a bit finer. But, overall, both batches of cookies were wonderful, and very impressive-looking. Aside from my own carelessness on batch one, the only other challenge I had was in flipping the layers to stack them. With one of the layers, it pretty much fell apart and I had to sort of patch it all together. In the end, no one could tell, though!

Rating: 4
These are amazing. I've done them three times now, and a couple notes: First, I didn't notice much difference if any between separating the eggs and not. I tried it both ways. The batter is a tiny bit lighter, but it "settles" quite a bit and the end cookie was the same. Second, the only reason I can see for washing out the pan in between batches is that it is really hard to spread the batter evenly in a hot pan! So the washing is maybe more for cooling off the pan.... Third, this is a very difficult recipe to do by hand. If you don't have a stand mixer, a food processor works well for the almond paste/ sugar step. I can NOT get the almond paste to mix with the sugar with just a spoon. I also tried a potato masher, a pastry blender, and a pair of knives... each of which seemed like a good idea at the time but turned out to be pretty useless. And if you don't get the almond paste mixed well, you end up with bits of it in the batter. Not a tragedy, but not quite right either. It takes lots of work, lots of different bowls, and all the counter space you've got, but definitely worth it in the end!

I grew up in an Italian neighborhood on Long Island and these evoke such memories! Just made them for the first time before reading any of the reviews. I followed recipe "as is". Here's my two cents: if you're going through the trouble (and they are worth it), double or triple the recipe. You want those layers as evenly as possibly before you bake (that offset spatula is really helpful). Make sure the batter is just set in the oven. Make each layer in a 9X9 pan (I found them too thin otherwise). Do weight the cookies. Only put chocoloate on one layer of the cookies. I would really like to know why the separation of the eggs or chilling the batter is necessary and how it changes the results (if any). Good luck.

I have been baking these cookies (or a reasonable facsimile) for over 15 years and they are definitely worth the effort. I get raves every time and if I don't bring them to a gathering, people are very disappointed! I don't wash the pan out between layers - it's lined with waxed paper, and the new batch will be baked inside new waxed paper. What's to wash? I love the idea of mixing the sugar with the almond paste in the food processor, because that has been my only trouble - getting the almond paste fully integrated without lumps. Also, if your almond paste seems hard, call the manufacturer and read the code off to them - I once bought almond paste from the grocery store that was over a year old. They took it back. I use a bit of milk to soften up the chocolate before spreading on top and I bring it to room temperature before slicing. I use a pastry scraper because it has a nice handle I can just push down evenly through the layers. For those who think it's too much work to do at Christmastime, bake them early and, before you spread on the ganache, seal them in plastic wrap then remove from the freezer and finish them up when you're ready for them.

After reading all the reviews I had to try these - they are NOT a quick cookie, but very impressive on the buffet. And they do taste like chocolate-covered cherries! My refinements to the instructions, based on other reviews, gave me cookies that didn't crack at all. First the batter - I did not divide the eggs but let the mixer beat them for quite a while (8 minutes?) Before adding the flour, I divided the dough into thirds by weighing it (to get equal layers) and put one portion back in the mixing bowl. I added the green coloring at that point, mixed it in well and then added the divided portion of the flour. While that layer was baking, I added the flour to the white layer. While the white layer was baking I prepared the red layer dough. My pan was 8x12 and so my layers were a little thicker than the photo. Per other reviews, I added a splash of cream to the chocolate to make a ganache. After letting everything chill overnight, I let the "cake" come to room temperature and then cut with a very sharp knife. Not one crack. Because my layers were thick, I cut them into squares about 1"x1" and stood them up on the platter. They were beautiful and lovely tasting.

Wow! These are so delicious, really taste like they came from a bakery. I was intimidated at first, but already made my 2nd batch in a week! Hubby loves them, says the best he's ever tasted in a seven layer cookie. I followed the directions to a t, and used the tip someone else wrote about keeping the knives hot when cutting. This is our new favorit holiday cookie!

I think Gourmet was recycling a bit here. This is almost identical to the "Rainbow Cookies" recipe on this site. The differences are that this recipe calls for (1) an extra ounce of almond paste and chocolate, (2) 1/4 tsp more salt, (3) 4 tbsp less butter, (4) apricot instead of raspberry jam, and (5) a LOT more food coloring. The differences are pretty minor, but they show you where there's room for tinkering in this recipe.

Rating: 4
This was definitely a time-consuming project, but worth it! I'm fairly inexperienced with baking, and it took me a little while to get the hang of the offset spatula, but they turned out well, and look almost as good as the picture. Based on some of the other reviews, I wiped off the knife between every cut, and ran it under hot water frequently. This seemed to keep the chocolate from cracking and make nice, clean lines. The recipe yields a lot of cookies, which also makes the time investment worthwhile.

This recipe takes a lot of time, but the cookies are so beautiful that I didn't mind. I didn't chill the batter and they were fine. I did chill them thoroughly after they were coated with chocolate, and I ran a knife under hot water before I cut them up for a sharp edge. I'll make them every year!

Amazing cookie, my new favorite. Great combination of flavors and very festive.

Rating: 4
These almond flavored cookies certainly were impressive looking, and are much easier to make than they appear to be. I essentially followed the recipe, but cut it by 1/4 and baked the layers in a 9x9 pan, which resulted in a slightly thicker cookie. I was worried after reading the reviews as I don't own an offset spatula, but I didn't end up having any trouble spreading the layers relatively neatly. I will certainly make these again next year, they looked wonderful on the Christmas cookie tray and tasted great as well.

Rating: 4
These cookies have a wonderful, albeit rich, flavor and a very festive feel. My suggestion is to be very organized and clean because it can get a little complicated if you don't plan ahead. I also tempered my chocolate so I got a nice snap with the chocolate layers. Very yummy! All 6 dozen cookies were gone in minutes and people were begging for the recipe!

Rating: 4
Just made my first attempt at these, and they were absolutely delicious. I didn't have a shallow pan or cookie sheet, so I ended up making the layers in a cake pan. A little more difficult to handle the layers, but the ultimate result was awesome. I think the cookie dough recipe is too little for 3 cookie layers in a 13 x 9 pan though. My white layer was skimpy.

Rating: 4
This is the second time I have made these- each time finessing my approach.This time, I cooked the layers for 8 minutes, sprayed the sheets with non-stick spray to avoid having the wax paper slide, and used an entire bag of Ghiardelli bittersweet chips for the coating. the look beautiful and taste better than the bakery!

I make a variation on this recipe, but will also try this. TIPS: I prepare three pans, and make the recipe three times-one for each color, so I eliminate dividing and coloring. I add the color as I add the egg yolks to avoid over mixing when folding in the whites. These freeze well, and so I have plenty for gift boxes, Christmas, New years, and for an instant, elegant dessert or coffee break in the midst od winter. grettie

I made this recipe as written, save for the use of gel food color instead of liquid (about 1/4 t. of each color) and the addition of 1/3 c. cream to the chocolate. My biggest caveat: this recipe demands a fair degree of skill with an offset spatula; if you don't feel competent with this tool, don't expect the finished product to come out looking like the photo! Sloppy spatula work will lead to unevenly thick layers, as well as a less-than-flawless chocolate coating. Take your time and try to keep the spatula warm as you go (particularly with the chocolate). And do use a *short* spatula or a low-sided pan (such as a jelly roll pan); my long spatula kept interfering with my high-sided pan. A few more comments: 1. I see little reason to trim the sides before adding the chocolate topping--if you slop some chocolate over the cut edge, as I did, you'll end up having to re-trim anyway. 2. Consider preparing 10-12 ounces of chocolate instead of just 7--you don't have to use it all, but you'll worry less about running out, and I think a slightly thicker chocolate coating could be advantageous anyway. 3. Consider using a 9x9 pan--it will yield fewer, but taller and more impressive, bars than the 9x13. 4. I questioned the instruction to use wax paper instead of parchment to line the pan, but I did use wax paper and it turned out fine. No smoke/fire in the oven and no wax on the finished product. :)

After mixing in the red food coloring or green food coloring so it isn't streaky, the dough was deflated and came out very flat. Also, these taste like chocolate covered cherries, which I do not like. My layers slid when trying to cut them. Also, the instructions should indicate to let the finished cookies come to room temperature before cutting. Otherwise, they crack, even with a hot serrated knife. I'm a pretty accomplished cook, and followed this recipe exactly. Yuck.

I grew up eating these (we called them Neapolitan cookies) and I love them. This recipe tastes just like what I remember eating. It's not difficult, but it is time consuming. I haven't seen anyone else mention it here, so let me note that the tubes of almond paste you can buy in the baking aisle of any grocery store are 7 oz - not 8 oz - and that works perfectly fine. It's certainly not necessary to buy two just to get that extra ounce. Mine are just sweet enough and perfectly almondy.

These cookies ended up being so much better than I had imagined! My boys saw them on a cookie tray during a =n episode of "Cake Boss" and both said they looked awesome. Some googling and I found out what they were called and saw this recipe had good ratings so I tried them out! The flavor is fantastic- a bit sweet but really wonderful. I read several reviews that said separating the eggs and beating the whites was a waste of time. While I had the butter and sugar in the stand mixer, I just beat the whites by hand in a bowl. They were frothy but definitely nowhere near soft peaks. The only other change I made was to use more coloring- since I was making these for my kids and they love the vivid colors! I will definitely make these again, however I will double the batch and buy some more jellyroll pans. I had to use one and it was harder to spread the batter once the pan had been heated up. These cookies are definitely worth the effort!

These were definitely worth the effort. They tasted and looked like the ones we used to get at the Italian bakeries in NY - very impressive and everyone loved them. They were beautiful and delicious. I also added a little cream to chocolate to make a crackless ganache. Will certainly make again and again.

Delicious cookies, beautiful and not too sweet. I would recommend increasing the chocolate to get a thicker coating on top & bottom. I also kept my knife hot to cut through the cookies for a nice crisp appearance. I kept a vase filled with steaming hot water, used two knives (cutting with one while the other heated up in the water), and wiped the knife clean after every stroke. Taking the extra time made the cookies worth it.

Rating: 4
Great recipe! My first time making it and the only problem I had was because I didn't butter the pan before I laid down the wax paper - I used cooking spray instead - this doesn't work because the paper slides around. The butter is necessary to keep the paper from slipping when you spread the dough. I wouldn't change a thing about the recipe. The apricot preserves were a perfect compliment to the signature almond taste, which in my opinion should be the dominant flavor, instead of the fruit. This recipe is a definite keeper; I am eager to make them for family and friends. BTW, to answer that person's question about why undercook the layers - undercook all layers, not just the red one - it's because it ensures the thin layers don't dry out, and the moistness is needed to keep the cookies together when they're layered. Underbaking, in general, is the secret to good cookies that aren't dried out and hard.

I have made this recipe several times and it is a showstopper. I made it pretty muchexactly as the recipe calls for. I did use less food coloring per another review, about 8 drops did the trick for me. I also purchased three pans and cooked them at the same time in the convection oven for about 5 minutes. It worked great and saved lots of time. I was worried about the chocolate cracking. I followed the directions exactly in regards to the chocolate and it cut perfect. I added nothing to the chocolate and easily did the top and bottom. You have to cut with a clean knife and cut as soon as you take it out of the fridge after the second layer. SOOOO worth the effort. You will be the hero at any cookie swap!

I have been making this recipe for years and it comes out great every time. I follow the recipe exactly with the exception of chilling the batter and the amount of food coloring. I use only 5 drops of food coloring and never chill the batter. I don't understand the negative reviews. I think it's an easy recipe to make if you keep organized. Also, I do not cool the layers after they have baked. As soon as you put the red layer down and get the white layer in the oven, put the jam on the red layer while it's hot. It's easier to spread. Then 10 minutes later, the white layer...etc. Do not cut into bars right out of the fridge. Let the chocolate soften a little and it won't crack.

I was really excited to make these because I thought the presentation was beautiful. It was a bit time consuming and the entire time I wasnt sure I was doing it right. The batter was much thicker than I expected, but it baked up nicely. I was more than 1/2 way through cutting before I figured out how to do so nicely. Heat your knife and let the knife melt the chocolate. Dont try and cut/or push down on the chocolate. Still though, my cookies didnt look as impressive as the picture. I think I might have used too much apricot jam because in places it was coming out between layers where cut. My layers sort of squished down and didnt keep a nice straight line of colors. I am not sure if I underbaked too much?? Too much jam?? I think they tasted great. But to me, presentation is a biggie (I decorate a lot of cakes/cookies) I might give it one more go, but if it came out the same, I probably wouldnt make again.

this did was very time consuming and did not turn out as described. After dividing the batter into 3 bowls there was only enough for a 9x9 pan for each layer. The layers did not bake as thick as the picture. The taste is great, but very dense. I would not make this recipe again.

This cookie is both fun to make and is impressive on the plate. It was a lot of work but absolutely worth it. I'll make these again next year. My one suggested modification is to cut back on the sugar a touch. The cookie is very sweet. The bittersweet chocolate balances the sweetness out but I think it would be better with less sugar.

Lots of good hints already, but here are my thoughts. I made the batter exactly as directed WITHOUT separating whites. With a good stand mixer, it just isn't necessary, particularly with the extra mixing in of color that's required. Had a jelly roll pan the correct size, and once I removed each layer from the oven with parchment paper I threw the pan in the freezer for a minute and was ready for the next layer quick. Used cardboard cake boards to move layers and it worked super. That way I could just slide the layers into place. Added a touch (maybe a third of a cup) of cream to the chocolate and had no problem with cracking. Did both sides. Kept it refrigerated. My, they're gorgeous, And tasty. If you don't like almond flavor why would you make them?

These were addictive. Make them at your own risk. And stick to 25 drops of food coloring if you want that authentic color (it's beautiful!). I used parchment paper instead of wax paper as I don't find wax tasty. :) Next time I'll be making three batches at once. My hips will never forgive me but my taste buds will sing. :)

I make these every year for family and gift boxes.To save time, clean up and number of bowls: 1. make the recipe three times, once for each color- green then plain then pink, baking the three pans of each batch at the same time. 2. blend the almond paste and sugar in the food processor before it goes in the mixer bowl. 3. I also don't separate the eggs, but run the mixer at med-high speed for 6-8 minutes to incorporate air. 4. use jelly roll pans to get the cakes out easily. 5. I use MUCH less food coloring-why should they look so artificial and radioactive? 6.let these set at room temperature; cut when the chocolate is JUST set, probably 10 minutes. (I will try adding some cream, butter as suggested by others). 7. I build the layers- green, plain, pink- but only put chocolate on the top. I usually make ahead and wrap in freezer paper. They keep well for 6-8 weeks

I am Italian and have eaten these cookies my whole life... most people make them and they have a more cake- like, spongy texture. There is a deli near my home that makes this recipe and the almond paste is the key ingredient! It gives the dough a chewier texture with more almond flavor. I substituted raspberry preserves for apricot, and only used chocolate on the top layer. I also added some sprinkles on top for additional decoration. The recipe is phenomenal, my family could not stop eating them! We were going to make cookie trays with them and decided to keep for ourselves! Definitely worth the extra effort!

Labor intensive. Wished I had put sugar & almond paste in processor first before mixing. Used half the amt. of food coloring and it had plenty of color. Made a different chocolate topping because I didn't want it to crack as I cut it into pieces. Made a ganache (half heavy cream which I warmed, and half chocolate which I stirred in off of the heat). Then, I put in refrig. until it was a spreadable consistency.

This is a really great recipe. I grew up eating these. I am originally from nyc and these taste just as good as the ones my mother used to make or the ones that I would pick up in my favorite bakery. I added milk and butter to the chocolate though so prevent the chocolate from cracking a tip from my hubby who is also a chef. I will make this recipe again and again.

This was a fun recipe to make, and it certainly did taste good. But I was disappointed that my squares didn't look as slick and polished as the ones in the recipe picture. The chocolate would crack on top when I was cutting it into bite-size pieces. Perhaps I should've let it come to room temperature after I had refrigerated it. I also found that the food colouring applied to the various layers, gave it an artificial look. That wasn't very appetizing to look at despite the fact that I was drawn to this recipe by the picture to begin with. Despite this, it was a very good tasting cookie. Would try again.

I make cookies every year, but this cookie was so good, I had to sit down and put my feet up after the first bite. And then, I had to hide them from my family so i could have my own daily holiday stash. I was fresh out of raspberry jam so i substituted black cherry jam instead. The combination of chocolate, cherry and almonds worked amazingly well. I cut the pieces then rolled each piece in chocolate to have the most chocolate possible in each bite. I highly recommend it.

I, too, am from NYC and I have so missed these cookies! This is the closest thing I have found to the original. Even the Italian bakeries here don't do them justice. They are definitely worth the effort if you have ever had them before. For those who had trouble with the layers, take the layer on the paper and fold one of the long edges of the overhang underneath the cake. Then line the exposed edge of the cake up to the edge of the layer that it will go on top of, like two pages in a book. Gently close the book. Mine didn't crack at all and it lined up perfectly. Good luck, I hope this helps!

This is a lot of work, and I like the idea others suggested of adding the eggs whole without beating the whites separately. I was worried about undercooking, but found I had to bake mine 15 minutes so they would have some stability. I would recommend adding some cream to the chocolate so it doesn't get to hard to cut without cracking

These are fabulous - both in taste and appearance. They are my husbands favorite!

My best friend Janine and I agree...these are really delicious, and pretty too! (like us) :-) Seriously, these are great cookies. The first batch I made did not come out good because I misread the sugar measurement and put in the whole cup of sugar, 1/4 cup at a time. The second batch I made, I added the correct amt of sugar and also had to bake each layer for about 15 minutes. And that batch came out great. They are time consuming, but it's nice to have a different type of cookie once in a while.

I can't wait to make these again for Christmas. They did take a while to make, but that's what made them special and everyone really loved them.

SO not worth the effort! In the amount of time it takes to make these cookies, you can make three other impressive varieties and go to an Italian bakery to get a helping of these. Don't underestimate the amount of space needed for this creation over a period of time when you'll surely need that space for other things.

I've never had these cookies before, but people tell me they tasted just like the "real" thing! And they looked beautiful - just like the picture - the chilling and cutting advice is perfect! They were time consuming, but a fun challenge to make! Making them a day or two ahead is good advice, the flavor is more pronounced when they have time to "rest". I also did not seperate the eggs, and when I was mixing in the food coloring throught to myself, why beat the egg whites to make a light batter, when you're just going to have to mix it much more after adding the coloring..Will be making these again!

BIG hit at Christmas. Yes, these aren't drop cookies, and they take some effort. But the taste, oh the lovely blend of chocolate, almond, and fruit, and their cake-like texture is worth the time. This will be on the cookie list for next year.

Beautiful! I had little faith that these would look as good as the picture but they did! I will make these again next Christmas.

Addendum to below posting -- don't bother separating the eggs. I did two batches, and it made no difference. Save yourself another bowl to clean and time!

My first attempt at these cookies. . . my experience: one, dough was very hard to work with, so I added a couple of tablespoons of milk to make it not as stiff; do expect to spread the layers out onto the pan and do so as evenly as possible (it may seem like you won't have enough dough but you will). two, make this at least three days ahead (all layered and cut into pieces; store in the refigerator), as the flavors become more subtle (less marzipan taste, which is not a liking of mine). three, do keep a pot of simmering hot water nearby to dip knife into to cut layers -- makes for less broken chocolate pieces. four, do keep refrigerated as it keeps better and i think tastes better cold than at room temperature. five, use at least the indicated amount of food coloring (i'd use more in the future). six, i used the raspberry and apricot combination, but i think using one or the other will be fine -- it's too subtle to tell. seven, i used the advice of using disposable cake pans where i was able to cook two layers at a time. finally, overall, this is a very subtle tasting cookie -- it's more impressive looking than tasting, which as a result, is a nice present for the holidays.

Wow, I can't believe I pulled this off! They came out absolutely delicious. Time consuming and nerve-wracking, but fun and challenging just the same. These were my favorite treats as a child (I'm Italian and from NYC) and I'm so happy to surprise my family with them for Christmas. I tripled the food coloring to make them really bright, and added some yellow coloring to the middle layer for extra vibrance. My husband's large strong hands came in handy for the layer flipping and chocolate cutting. I'm an amateur baker and they came out perfectly.

I loved these cookies! They're time consuming but worth the effort. Anyone have some suggestions for cutting them with out cracking the chocolate?

One more thing...i almost tripled the amount of food coloring to give it the more authentic look.

I Have been eating these cookies since I was 3 years old with my New York Italian family. I am amazed at how perfect this recipe is! Here are the changes I would make to make it closer to the authentic ones: 1)Don't separate eggs, waste of time 2)Batter wasn't stiff enough, I added an extra half cup of flour 3)Don't go by the 8-10 minute tim limit, use your eyes..as SOON as the edges turn light brown 4)Defintely weight the cake, makes all the difference before you layer with chocolate Lots of luck!

re: disposable pans: it chagrins me to even see such a suggestion, much less see it endorsed! what effort does it take to keep a soapy sponge handy to quickly pass over the pan, rinse and dry it? in my own case, i'd probably have at least one extra same-size pan handy anyway for swapping out, as do most regular (even if only xmas) bakers. there's also parchment liners, etc. (mebbe i missed something earlier...)

These cookies do require a bunch of steps, and worked out to be about the same as your typical complicated holiday cookie recipe. I definitely endorse the disposable pan idea, so you can bake all 3 layers easily. In addition, I added vanilla extract instead of almond, and used black raspberry preserves instead of the apricot. I also added a bit more chocolate, and made more of a ganache by adding some cream. Don't be afraid to give these a try!

These cookies are more work than they are worth. I love the almond-apricot combo but its just not work the work.

Plan ahead to make this because it is worth the effort. A very pretty and delicious addition to a holiday cookie assortment. I take issue a bit with the need to underbake the layers and think the cookie is better when layers are baked for the full time.

Brought these to a cookie exchange and got rave reviews. I think the cake layers were a bit dry, perhaps cooked a little too long. Didn't have any trouble assembling, the warmed knife is a great idea. Next time I think I'll try the same ingredients but using an 8x8 pan so the layers are thicker. Then I'd cut bigger pieces and serve it with ice cream.

What a great recipe! It is a bit time consuming only because three different layers need to be baked but as another reviewer pointed out you can use multiple pans and bake all at once. The finished product is very pretty and I will be making these again for Christmas. The only problem I had was putting the layers together. My husband had to help me so they wouldn't break. Definitely worth the effort!

While this was a bit time consuming it was well worth it! Next year I will definitely make a double batch to make it even more worth my time. I did add raspberry preserves to half of the cake and think the side with apricot and raspberry is better. Cutting the cookies was a bit difficult but I finally figured out the best way to do it. 1. I used my favorite, sharperst knife. 2. Keep a pot of water gently simmering and heat knife occasionally. 3. Keep a damp cloth nearby and clean knife often to avoid crumbs from getting onto the chocolate layer. 4. I found it was easiest to cut the long strips and work on one strip at a time. At first I was cutting the cookies the way you might cut a pan of brownies, going through all four strips. When I starting cutting just one strip at a time it went much easier and faster. Hope this helps!

These cookies look great, and they aren't too hard if you follow the directions carefully. But they are time-consuming and seemed to use every bowl and spatula in my kitchen. I thought they came out too sweet (and believe me, I like things sweet). If I were to make them again I would experiment with cutting down on the sugar in the batter, and perhaps use marmalade or something tangy like that between the layers.

I rated this recipe up because I didn't want to hurt the ratings, but I haven't made it yet. It sounds sort of like the rainbow cookies on this web site. If you haven't made the rainbow cookies, please do. They are really to die for. I will try these and then give a real rating.

These taste great, but pretty difficult to assemble. I had a really hard time keeping it from falling apart. Luckily the cooked dough is somewhat forgiving and lets you repair. The chocolate layer was difficult to cut throught, even with my really sharp serrated knife. Not really worth the effort, adds extra stress during the holidays!.

These cookies are wonderful -- labor intensive, but so gorgeous, delicious, and unique that they're worth it, especially for the holidays. Here's a helpful tip -- forget this whole parchment overhang business and just purchase three disposable foil cake pans, 12 x 8 inches (it's a standard size). Line the bottoms with parchment, and then just spread the batter into each of those -- much easier, and you can bake all three pans at once.

My Grandmother called these Venetian Ribbon Cookies. Her recipe is very similar to this one -- they are the BEST Christmas cookies ever! Our recipe differs as follows: 3 sticks of softened unsalted butter, 1/4 tsp. salt, and 2 C *sifted* flour. I also use much less food coloring (about 10 drops green and 8 red). These are absolutely spectacular - people rave about them. They are so worth the effort.

BEWARE! These cookies were a disaster. The batter resembled brick mortar (but harder to spread). The wax paper "overhangs" nearly smoked my family out of the kitchen. And the cookie layers crumbled into a million pieces during assembly. I am a cookie-lover and have gone to great lengths for a good sweet without regret, but in this case, the product does not justify the energy.

I love these cookies! Used raspberry jam instead of the apricot and made my own almond paste---just boil unsalted almonds till softened, rub the skins off and put in the blender with some milk and a little sugar(optional) to taste.
