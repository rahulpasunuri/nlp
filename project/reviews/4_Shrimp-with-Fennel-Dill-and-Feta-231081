This is a wonderful recipe and has become a family favorite. I've never tried fennel before and my whole family has learned to love it. It's a keeper and quick and easy too.

This recipe is awesome! I didn't think I'd care for the fennel, but combined with the flavors of sun dried tomatoes and feta, it is fabulous. I will definitely make this a part of my everyday menus.

I loved this recipe - the flavors are awesome, and it's easy to make. I didn't think I would care for the fennel, but combined with the sundried tomatoes and feta the flavors just stand out. I will definitely make this a part of my everyday menu!

I have made this numerous times and I use less fennel than it calls for and more of everything else. I make this for company - it's easy and delicious.

Definitely cook the fennel longer- at least 10 min, I say. Amazing dish.

This dish has become a family favorite for its ease of preparation and combination of flavors and textures. I use the jumbo, already shelled and cleaned shrimp. This dish has really turned us into fennel lovers too.

Simple and wonderful. Extremely easy to prepare (I bought fresh pre-shelled shrimp)and served it over capellini. Made for a very light spring meal. I marinated the shrimp for a while in salt and pepper and they were really delicious. Also I'd recommend sauteeing the fennel for more than 3 minutes so its a bit softer.

Wonderful blend of flavors and easy to make! Will definitely have this again soon!

We made this dish as a hot salad, leaving out the shrimp and tossing the greens with the sauteed sun dried tomatoes and fennel, adding the feta and dill last. It was delicious and we would definitely make it again.

I debated whether or not to review this recipe, because I accidentally used leeks instead of fennel (stupid mistake.) However, I thought it would still be useful to others if I shared my results. The leeks were good, and of course the fennel would have added spice to the flavor. My main complaint with this dish was its overall dryness. There is not enough 'sauce' or wet stuff. Also, I didn't care for the combination of feta, sundried tomato and dill. I think oregano or basil would have worked better with the mediterranean flavors. Overall, I just didn't care for the dish, and after cleaning and deveining all that shrimp it didn't seem worth the effort.

Made this for dinner last night but used small 'popcorn' shrimp since big shrimp were unavailable. Despite this fiddling on my part the taste was lovely. I will also add that if you add some fresh tomatoes and cook it a bit longer, it becomes quite 'saucey' and would be great over pasta or paired with a baked potato. I will keep this on my list as a quick, easy dinner.

This is a quick & easy dish that is EXCELLENT! I have also substituted pork and chicken for the Shrimp. I serve this on a bed of fresh spinach from my garden. TASTY!
