Delicious and distinctive. Beautiful presentation. Easy preparation. If you like German flavors, you will love this. My husband did not like the strong flavors, but enjoyed the cabbage.

This was a great way to use our neighbor's venison steaks. The cabbage was a good foil and great leftovers for another meal.

We loved this recipe. It isn't the kind of thing we normally cook, but it was wonderful and well worth the effort. I probably put a bit more vinegar in the cabbage than was recommended, but it was wonderful and bright. And the venison was surprisingly tender.

The sauce is superb !!! Use the best red wine you can afford and serve it with the meal. A french Bourgogne 2002 works well.

I do like venison and I am always looking for new ways of adding a differant favor to my ways of cooking it. This is a very unique and a change from some the usual way. I enjoyed it!

This recipe is worth the time and effort and absolutely delicious as leftovers the next day. I think with slight changes to the recipe, this could be adapted to venison stew meat. Yummy.

Very unique, peppery flavor. My husband absolutely loved it and he's a die hard plain steak eater. Nothin' but steak sauce, usually! The only thing I added was a splash of balsamic vinegar to the sauce when it was done because I thought it was kind of bitter. That really made it. We had a delicious tender cut of meat for this meal, but I think it would be a good recipe to try if your meat was too strong because the flavors in the sauce really take over. Oh - the only thing I didn't have was szechwan pepper, so I just used more regular black peppercorns.

This was great. It looks great on the plate and the whole family loved it. The only problem I had was getting a good cut of venison in Southern California.

This was the first time I attempted to cook venison, although I have tasted it before. My family raved about the venison and the cabbage was just like my mothers. Fantastic
