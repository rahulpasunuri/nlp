I just made the dough for this and then went and read the reviews. I am heartbroken! I used the 5 Tbsp of yeast called for in the recipe, and the actual amount is 5 tsp! All that kneading and wasted ingredients. I don't even know how to dispose of the dough, it's going to take over the bin! What a waste. I'm so sad.

These are time consuming but they are really good i would recommend to a friend.

Since I'm a gluten-free baker, and grew up in Sweden, I'm partial to my mother's recipe. I usually make a gluten-free Cardamon Braid. Yum!

The amount of yeast is not correct. It should be 5 teaspoons (2.5 tsp x 2)

I think these are delicious--I just tried the first one and am eager to enjoy the rest. I felt this recipe was a bit labor intensive (although I was interrupted by the phone several times), but was worth it.

We've traveled MN and WI to follow Ruth and her Jenny Lind Cardamom Rolls and bakery - the rolls grabbed us 13 years ago when she was baking them in Stockholm, WI. This weekend we head to Red Wing MN to enjoy them again made by THE Master, Ruth. I've made this recipe myself, and even though I'm a pretty good baker, I can't do them the justice that Ruth does. They are to die for!

When I make these I modified the recipe to work in my bread machine. Also my cousin who learned this recipe from her swedish grandmother after shaping the rolls, we brush them with milk and sprinkle with pearl sugar.

Delicious! I added ground cardamom to the dough and braided it into a loaf, with egg wash and sprinkled lightly with the sugar on top. A real treat.

My Swedish mother taught me to roll the dough out to a large rectangle. Spread butter on the dough and sprinkle with cinnamin and sugar. Roll the dough lengthwise to make a log. Beginning at the top of the log use clean kitchen scissors and snip about 3/4 of the way into the log every inch. Begin at the top of the log to "Flower" out each snipped piece, laying each piece left, then right. It will almost look braided on the cookie sheet.

I didn`t have any whole cardamon so I used 1 teaspoon ground in the dough & then sprinkled another 1 teaspoon over the dough with the cinnamon.....I think the amount of sugar in the dough could be increased just a smidge to 8 TLBS. The twisting of the rolls was quite vague, so I just twisted them in half from the middle & it worked, they look like figure eights. Made more than the 15 stated, more like 22. I have had better Swedish rolls.

My husband is a Stockholm native and he loved this recipe. I was struggling to find one that tasted authentic, yet utilized American ingrediants and measurements. (our yeast is different) You should top them with pearl sugar , which you can find it at IKEA or most Euro or gourmet markets. To the person who thought they were not sweet enough, I must say that typical Swedish rolls are not overly sweet. That way they go really well with hot chocolate!

Dough was excellent - but can anyone explain this double twisting figure 8. That didn't work for me so I laid them flat on a cookie sheet like regular cinnamon rolls. I rolled the dough to the exact dimensions so I have no idea what I did wrong. Also, be sure to use ALL of the sugar and spices. I thought the dough looked "full" and only used 1/2 and it wasn't sweet enough when I cooked it. Will definitely try again. The dough is really moist and fabulous.

This was a good recipe for Swedish buns, but be warned that they mean 5 TEASPOONS OF YEAST,not tablespoons! When I make this again I will add the cardamom with the warm liquid (as my Swedish mother always did) - so the spice delicately permeates the roll. The taste of the sprinkled cardamom was too harsh.

This is a versatile recipe that can handle adjusting. Since I had no cardamon, I made it with 5 spice powder. The rolls were really good. I'd like to try them with the cardamon sometime.

Very good variation of a very, very old recipe! My husband's Aunt ( a first generation Finn) passed this recipe along to me about 20 years ago! The only difference is that the rolled dough is placed in bread pans to bake-much like cinnamon bread. j

It is worth the price of cardamon, for the depth added to the taste in this receipe. Plain cinnamon will never do again.
