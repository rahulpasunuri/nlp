This was pretty tasty. I omitted the left-over turkey but kept the rest the same. It was a nice addition to a spanish meal.

My less-than-stellar rating is in large part due to the fact that, never having made paella before, I didn't realize I didn't need to cook the rice first. I did, and it ended up being very soggy and mushy. I should try this again before fully judging.

I pretty much reversed the meats, and it was delicious. i had about 1.25 lbs of leftover pork tenderloin, and some chicken jalapeno sausage  worked great. it does indeed make a lot (esp for 2!), but seems like it will freeze well.

My new fave recipe for leftover turkey! Concur prior reviewers' comments about the flexibility of this recipe - it stands up very well. Saffron a must, however.

This is a great recipe and easily adaptible to whatever you have on hand. Both turkey and sausage aren't necessary but it was very good and something I'll make again for sure. My sister lives in Nigeria and says this is remarkably similar to something called Jollef rice, which every Nigerian woman makes as a staple. Just substitute rosemary for oregano, curry powder for the saffron and take out the sausage.

I've been making this dish post-Thanksgiving since it was printed. Love it a lot. While it isn't a true paella, it has wonderful flavors and is a great way to turn tradition on its head. This recipe could feed an army, which is great if you're having guests stay over the weekend. This dish should not be made without the saffron. It can be pricey but there is no substitute and leaving it out isn't really an option you should pursue.

We loved this, especially the spiciness. Tender tummies should reduce the cayenne but if you like spicy food this is lovely. I didn't have the red pepper or frozen peas, so I used some frozen corn and sliced olives -- more for the color than the taste. This is a new favorite of ours.

This is such an easy, delicious recipe. I usually am lazy and use 2 cans drained recipe-ready tomatoes. My husband and I both love how spicy it is (as written). I also usually substitute brown rice because it's healthier and we like its nutty flavor. Just takes longer to cook. Also, rotisserie chicken from the market is fine to use here...and handy if its not holiday time.

I've made this twice, once with white and once with brown rice (boiled for 30 minutes and baked for 20). It's better with white, the flavors stand out better. Soy-rizo (kosher, vegetarian spicy sausage- like stuff) was a great stand in for pork sausage both times.

Very nice flavor and great as a weeknight meal. We omitted the turkey and used ~1 lb leftover (raw) clams. The clams took longer to open than expected, so we baked it longer which made the rice a little mushy. However, that's user error and not the recipe's fault! Will certainly make again.

Wow, delicious, easy, and adaptable. We made this last week with leftover chicken and a desire not to run to the store for any extras. We used leftover chicken and some bulk chorizo from the local grocery. I expected it would be a bit of a compromise, but this was absolutely delicious. It also seems like it would adapt quite readily to almost any leftover meat and vegetables. The rice was perfect and the level of hear from the cayenne was just about perfect. It took about a half hour to make, which is perfect for a work night, and I'm making it again tomorrow night for a potluck at work.

I quite like this and will definitely make it again, perhaps even regularly. Because I used brown rice I had to cook it an extra hour(!) but it was worth it and I think that only helped deepen the wonderful flavors. I used those split peas (dried) and we think their flavor may have made this dish, so I think I will do that again, too. BTW if you happen to be from Atlanta, the DeKalb Farmer's Market is the place to get Saffron ridiculously cheap.

I found this to be a really easy way to throw together a very tasty meal for guests. Everybody always likes it.

Paella is stretching it for a name but it was a wonderful tasty way of using leftover turkey.

It was great to use up some leftover turkey but would make it again without it. We found we didn't really need the turkey. The sausage made it good.

This recipe was good, although I made a lot of changes to it. I halved the recipe, and it still really made a lot. I also decided not to spring for saffron, so I added some paprika instead. I left out the peas, and I also used some rice that I had already cooked. So, b/c the rice was already cooked, I only added 1 cup of chicken broth when the time came, and did not boil the mixture nearly as long. The more sausage the better on this one! Overall, it was OK, tasty, but not totally scrumptious.

Oops! I forgot the spicy sausage. But the dish was flavorful nevertheless, what with the oregano and cayenne. I baked it in the oven rather than on the stovetop, stiring a few times during the cooking process (covered during first half). It is more like a pilaf really. Pilafs come out perfect every time: tender, moist, separate grains. There are possibly thousands of variations on such a dish using leftover cooked meats.

Oops! I forgot the spicy sausage! But it was a flavorful dish nevertheless, what with the oregano and cayenne. I cooked it in the oven, covered during the first half (about 20 minutes) stiring 3 or 4 times in all. It was more like a pilaf than a paella really. I love to cook rice in the oven as it seems to come out perfectly cooked, moist but not sticky.

I substituted some brown organic rice for half of the rice to make it healthier. Don't forget however that it takes longer to cook the brown rice, so start with that and when it is halfway cooked, then add the white rice.

great dish. very easy to prepare. makes much more than 6 servings though. got through most of my turkey leftovers and maybe next week I'll get through my paella leftovers. I used basmati rice and spanish sausage, and garlic powder when I realized I forgot the garlic glove...

My entire family loved this. In anticipation of it being dry, I added just a fourth cup more rice, then ended up adding quite a bit more fluid later because it was too dry, but it came out perfectly anyway. I also added corn and the tiniest bit of cinnamon to give it a nice round, full flavor and it worked out great. Simple to make.

I made this for the first time tonight and although it tasted great (my husband was raving about it), I'd probably make some changes. It came out too moist for me - rather than simmering for 15 minutes covered, next time I'll uncover and let it simmer for longer (at least 20 minutes or more) to let the liquid cook off. Other than that, the flavor was fantastic and it was a great way to get rid of turkey leftovers.

My husband isn't a fan of seafood so this is a fantastic alternative to the more traditional paella with shrimp and mussles. It also took significantly less time. I skipped the saffron because I think its flavor is too subtle for this strong dish (and it's so expensive). I will definitely make this again!

I used 1 cup of chicken broth & 1 cup of chardonnay (left over from the day before) Apart from that I stuck to the recipe and enjoyed the meal and the the leftovers. That made it leftover leftovers! (Turkey is a Christmas thing here)

Yum! This was a great hit with our family--with no peppers and no energy to get to the store, we substituted roasted peppers from a jar. This worked fine. Paella will be an annual leftover from now on!

Made this with leftovers, for dinner with friends on the Saturday after Turkey Day, and it was great! Nice change of pace from the usual use of leftover turkey. I couldn't find saffron locally, and recipe was great even without it. Left out peas because of picky eaters I was feeding. Otherwise followed recipe as written. Thought the amount of rice was fine. A definite keeper.

This was awesome. It is very easy to make and is a good hearty meal. I've printed it off and stored it with my Thanksgiving menu so that I can make it again next year. I would however lower the amount of rice to 1 1/2 cups and saffron to 1/8 tsp.

This was delicious and a welcome change in flavor after all the Thanksgiving food! I doubled the cayenne and the tomatoes and increased the number of peas. I will definitely make this again next year as its not only a great way to get rid of the extra turkey but also its yummy!

YUM!! This was a hit with my family! It was a great way to use the leftover turkey. By sunday after thanksgiving, every one is tired of the leftovers. So, this was a welcome change. We tend to do thanksgiving over a week so there are lots of family members coming and going. It was easy to make and it makes a lot (probably more than the 6 servings listed) so you can serve all the lingering thanksgiving guests.
