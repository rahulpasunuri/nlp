The flavor was good as was the puffiness. Easy to make, however, I made it twice and both times it was very watery at the bottom. Very disappointing. I suppose you would add more bread??? Or perhaps sautee the peppers and onions prior to adding them?

Not a 4, you have to change it, but good. For those who made it and it did not turn out well, you have to right to be upset. Always remember what a wise chef once told me..."Never make anything for guests you have not made before, EVER." I have lived by this and when I didnt, I have been burned! I used less milk, more egg, added crumbled goat cheese to the cheddar, added fresh garlic and sautéed with the onion, and put herbs de provence in the mix!

This is one of the easiest stratas I've ever done. I agree about adding more bread. There's a lot of liquid to soak up. End product was great!

I made this over Thanksgiving weekend for house guests using some reveiwers suggestions. For 8 I used 3 cup milk, 11 eggs, 1 T dry mustard, 1 loaf french bread, 3 cups ham etc. After baking it was perfectly set and had wonderful flavor.

I made this over thanksgiving weekend for house guests and it worked perfectly using some reviewers suggestions. I used 3 cups of milk, 11 eggs, a loaf of cut-up french bread, 3 cups ham, etc. It sat overnight and was perfectly set after baking and had wonderful flavor. Next time i would use a little less bread.

This was pretty bad. I followed the recipe exactly and there were many problems. It was far too liquidy - obviously not enough bread. It was also way too salty. It was very disappointing and I will try to find a different recipe for this type of dish. Not worth trying to tweak this one.

I agree that there is too much milk for the # of eggs - I used half. I added a little celery seed and lefover bruschetta tomatoes instead of green pepper for extra flavor. I also mixed half of the cheese with the eggs and sprinkled the remainder on top, as directed. Increasing the temp at the end makes for a crispy topping and corners. Next time I plan to use some goat cheese and olives in the mix.

I left out the green pepper (don't like 'em) and put in lots of freshly ground black pepper. In lieu of "white sandwich bread" (like Wonder) I used a sturdier buttermilk sandwich bread that was a few days old (Oroweat). Everyone loved it and it was great to make ahead and pop into the oven the next morning for a no-fuss hot breakfast.

This recipe is extremely bland and the proportion of egg/milk/bread simply don't work. This was obvious to me when I read the recipe, so I modified the mixture to 2 cups milk, 8-10 large eggs,one entire round sourdough loaf, not regular sandwich bread, increased salt to 4 teaspoons, add ground black pepper and hot chili pepper flakes. Because we like things spicy, I replaced the green pepper with a red bell pepper for color. I also increased the cheese to 2 cups, used extra sharp cheddar, and mixed it with the milk mixture, rather than sprinkle it on top. All of this, and it was still rather bland for my taste. I do not recommend this recipe to novice cooks -- it simply won't work as it is written.

Very good make ahead breakfast/brunch dish. Mine turned out perfectly set and full of flavor. I used heaping amounts of the green pepper, ham, and onion. We made a full recipe for fewer people and my husband and I ate the leftovers the next day and it was still good.

I cut this recipe in half and used an 8x8 baking pan for a family Sunday breakfast. I used stale French bread, cooked and drained bulk breakfast sausage instead of ham, red bell pepper instead of green because my kids like it better and I added freshly ground pepper. Juice, milk, coffee and fresh fruit made a complete and tasty meal!

I made this recipe for a brunch of "Moms". I followed review advice and increased bread to 12 slices and reduced milk to 3 cups along with 10 eggs. It turned out OK, and most of it was eaten, however I found it "boring". I have made other stratas that are much more flavourful.

I did not have time to soak this overnight. (I procrastinated until meal time). And I think that mistake solved the soggy, sloppy, runny mess that everyone else is having. I did increase the bread to 10 slices of slightly stale bread. Only was able to let it sit for about 30 minutes or so while I was making something else (fresh corn quiche -- on this web site-- you've got to try it!!) I used way more than the requested amount of cheese in the mixture and on top. And after baking, this turned out wonderful, not soggy at all. I think that maybe soaking it overnight is what is ruining it for everyone else. Definatly try again baking it the same day if you had trouble the first time.

I cut the milk by half and used stale bread and was very pleased with the results. Used red bell pepper for color; may add jalepeno or serrano next time for some kick! Rolled leftovers (not many!) in tortillas w/green chile for breakfast burritos the next day with great results.

Followed other reviewers advice and used 2 cups of milk and 10 eggs, and used 12 pieces of bread. Not soggy at all- just perfectly moist and delicious. Would add black pepper next time to add some more flavor, though.

Great brunch dish. My third time making, and this time took some of the advice from other reviewers. Definitely improves going to 10 slices of bread and allowing bread to go stale (we left on counter for a day) before using. Made dish much firmer. Delicious!!

We loved this! In fact, I'm downloading it again because we enjoyed it so much the first time, but I lost the recipe. We made it just like it was described, and it was wonderful.

This worked very well with several substitutions, based on what I had in the kitchen. I used a small loaf of whole wheat sandwich bread, didn't bother to cut the crusts. I had leftover coldcuts (ham, & hot cappicola, which added just the right spicy flavor), plus some provelone & swiss to accompany the cheddar. I used 2% milk, which worked fine. I agree that the recipe as written has the wrong proportions, so I used 10 eggs & 2 c. milk -- thanks to the reviewer from AK. I'm certain I used more than 1 cup of cheese. And added ground pepper on general principles. Very nice dish, we had it for supper with tomato & onion salad.

The proportion of milk to eggs and bread looks awfully high in this recipe. Cheese and Sausage Breakfast Casserole uses only 2 c. milk to 10 eggs and 8 slices of bread and was moist but not soggy. Hope this helps.

What a disaster - a soggy unappetizing mess! This recipe calls for a new rating class of half a fork, or less. It's a good thing our overnite guests were understanding.

This was somewhat soggy when I first made it. Subsequently, I increased the bread to 12 slices, and found that it works best with very stale bread. This dish is wonderfully flexible! I've added mushrooms, and used browned and well drained sausage in place of the ham. Use your imagination!

Just moved to San Diego area several months ago and have had lots of company -- I've used this at least once a month for the past four months and everyone loves it. Nice change from Cheese and Sausage Breakfast Casserole, also delicious, which is also on your website.

What happened to me?? I followed this recipe to the letter and it was barely edible due to its soggy factor. There was 1/2 an inch of water left in the pan after serving. Looking at other strata recipes I considered the bread quantity might properly read "18 slices." Any chance? Alternatively I'll blame it on the high altitude. I'm glad you all had better results.

This was so easy to put together the day ahead. The morning I served it was hassle free with no clean up, the left overs went right into the fridge in the pan it was cooked in. I got to spend my time with friends instead of busy cooking and the food was great! I used french bread and red bell pepper because it is what I had on hand. Yummy, easy, will do this again and again!

Very easy and delicious. Everyone loved it, but I thought that it was a bit salty... I would cut the salt in half at the very least, or even omit the salt altogether since the ham provides some saltiness. Also, I would use a mixture of red or yellow pepper with the green, since I thought the green peppers were a little too bitter.

This was one of three different stratas made for Easter brunch for 27 people. Of the three, this was by far the favorite of everyone present. I will make this again and again.

The perfect brunch dish - nothing to be done in the morning except throw it in the oven! Everyone had second helpings (a couple of the guys had THIRDS). Very hearty as well as delicious!

Great for brunch! Made for a party and everyone raved! About to try my hand at it again tomorrow! Also varied by adding fresh uncooked veggies which came out al-dente and perfect when baked into strata. Thanks!
