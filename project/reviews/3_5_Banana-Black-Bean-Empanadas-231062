Happened to have a brand-new nonstick pan so I fried a diced green banana in that with just a wipe of oil. The final mix seemed to need more sweetness so I added a second banana - wouldn't have objected to one more, but I think that was cause it wasn't ripe. Guests loved them & they were even better reheated in the toaster oven a couple of days later. Thanks for the lime/sour cream dip suggestion, that made them perfect.

Very easy and filling. Instead of the mini phyllo creations, I used 1 whole sheet and made a turn over. I doubled the cilantro and used a skim cheese (Jarlsberg) for a little spark, but only 1/2 the banana called for. Might use 3/4 next time but otherwise seemed too sweet. Like others, I didn't bother frying bananas beforehand. Turned out great. FrancisHaydee is correct, the spelling is wrong, it's spelled and pronounced 'empanada.'

this seems like a delicious dish but please revise your title-correct Spanish spelling for your dish is "empanada", not empañada, eliminate the "Ñ". thanks.

I made this for a potluck, and these were a hit. I bought some frozen empanada discs (small size) instead of the puff pastry, and was suprised at how easy it was to make this. The tops of the empanada crescents were brushed with egg wash to give it color. Also, I had to use shredded mozzarella at the time, but I didn't think there was a difference. I had to make a second batch on the fly, and didn't get to saute-ing the bananas, but don't think there was much of a difference when I subbed with just plain mashed bananas. Definitely a fast and easy dish to make. Great for prepping ahead and popping in the oven as well

I've made these many times and they're a great addition to a cocktail party or dinner. I've made them different ways (being crunched for time) and don't think the extra step of cooking the bananas separately is necessary. I add very hot jerk spice instead of the cayenne and add nutmeg, too, about 1/2 tsp. Lots of cilantro and a sour cream/lime dip, as someone else mentioned, make them super. Prepare for extra filling - I use it in place of refrieds in burritos. yum.

Not my favorite of the night, but pretty popular amongst our guests. It is a bit bland. The addition of sour cream does improve things

I've made these for a summer outdoor party and a winter holiday party and they've been a big hit. The bananas add such a wonderful element of surprise and complexity to this recipe. A little goes along way for the bananas, since they are essentially carmelized, making them sweeter than they would be when not sauteed. The spice is just enough to counter the sweetness. I've also tried serving with a salsa verde dip which is a nice fresh contrast to the richness of the recipe.

This was a fantastic recipe! I added a chopped, un-seeded Jalapeno pepper to the filling and served with low-fat sour cream that had lime zest and lime juice added...fantastic!!!

These were wonderful. I highly recommend sauteing the banana. It may stick to the bottom of the pan, but since you use the same pan for the beans and spices, it provides a wonderful infusion of flavors.

These are fantastic. I skipped the cheese, added one minced jalapeno w/o seeds, and used two bananas. Sprinkled with Bolivian sea salt before baking, and served with sour cream mixed with lime juice and zest. Got 14 empanadas using store- bought 4" diameter pastry puff rounds.

I made these as appetizers for a dinner party, and everyone loved them! They definitely have a really unique flavor (spicy and sweet), and I followed other cook's advice by not sauteeing the bananas first (ripe ones will mash easily with the beans). I also added some ripe mango. Will do again, for sure.

Rating: 4
I doubled the recipe and served it as a main course for 5 people- it was a huge hit. I felt that adding cheese would make them too heavy for our tastes, so I left out the MoJack. I also left out cilantro, simply because I'm cheap (we're in the process of growing our own). The amount of cayenne and cumin called for is spot-on: with the bananas it provides the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. At others' suggestions, I didn't saute the bananas (used fairly ripe ones) and simplified the process by combining with the beans before filling. I really wanted to make my own puff pastry or empanada dough, but limited time required the help of Pepperidge Farms. Even though the pre-made pastry worked great, I will try my hand at puff pastry from scratch next time. 20 minutes was exactly right for these. As a bonus, there was LOTS of extra filling, which we served with rice and roasted potatoes for a very filling vegetarian dinner.

These are absolutely WONDERFUL! A family favorite! They are putzy, but well worth it. One time I mistakenly added 1/4 cup cayenne instead of the 1/4 tsp. They were so hot that no one could stand it; I don't recommend, but it was the source of histerical laughter!! I like to sprinkle sea salt/Kosher salt to the tops after brushing with the egg mixture.

Delicious but you may consider adding a bit more spice to make the flavors come out a little more.

Rating: 4
The 4 forks come with a few modifications. I made these several times because I made them for a cooking class that I taught. Sauteeing the banana first results in a sticky, burned mess on the bottom of the pan. Just mash it uncooked into the beans at the end. Also, go heavy on the cheese. These freeze well: freeze individually before putting in a bag. Microwave briefly and then put in the toaster oven to reheat.

Sounds like a weird combination, but the banana/bean combo works great together. I left out the cheese and cilantro and it was light and simple and really let the great flavors come through.

I made a dipping sauce with sour cream, a little mayo, lime juice, choped cilantro, and salt/pepper, which complemented the dish well. However, overall these didn't work for me, the flavors just didn't really come together. There are tastier empanada recipes out there and I won't be making these again.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Tasted great, but a good bit of work to put together. The impress a party.

Rating: 3
I tripled the banana and added the cilantro after removing everything from the heat, as recommended by other reviwers. I tasted the filling at this point, and it was absolutely AMAZING. However, once I added the cheese, I felt like all of the incredibly robust flavors became less distinct, and muted to the point of blandness. I only added maybe one fourth of the cheese, so I don't even want to think of how pointless it would be with the full amount. Either way, I would definitely make this again, and just skip the cheese next time. The filling alone would make a wonderful side dish, and I think will become a staple dish in my home.

These empanadas were very good. They are best if nice and hot from the oven. I think Queso Fresco (suggestion from other reviewer) is a nice idea. I have made them more than once and they are a great complement to black bean soup.

Rating: 3
Good but not great, I thought they were a little bland but my guests seemed to like them. Part of the problem could have been that the bean mixture cooled down too much and did dry out a bit as someone else mentioned. I made the recipe as written except that I used queso fresco for the cheese and substituted the Cafe Azul pastry dough recipe found on this site (which was fabulous) to make mini empanadas, which I served as hors d'oeuvres.

I made this for a Latin-themed Christmas party in my dorm--my friend Monica held it down with an array of Cuban dishes for the main course. Definitely a HIT, and extremely easy to make. You can actually take or leave the cilantro and spices--leaving them out lets the banana flavor come out more, although I personally prefer the spicier version.

I have made these twice this week. They are amazing. The recipe is flawless but be sure to use very green bananas as they tend to get too mushy and the banana flavor is a little overpowering if they are too ripe.

Rating: 3
Following other reviewers I used more banana, about 2.5, and I found that to be a bit too much - the flavor of the beans was lost. I think it could use a jalapeno in addition to the cayenne, and more cilantro (fresh, not cooked with the beans). I used jalapeno jack cheese which was good. But overall it was easy and yummy.

Rating: 3
Loved this, I listened to the other reviews about adding more banana, and I wished I hadn't. The banana was a little to powerful, I will use less next time. We loved the banana black bean combo, very unique taste!! I will for sure make these again!!

Rating: 2
I really wanted to like this recipe, but the flavors fell short. I 2x the banana as other reviews had suggested. This is definitely a good idea because even with this quantity the banana flavor was subtle. Personally I don't find black beans, cilantro and banana to be a great combo. It didn't taste bad, but not good enough that I would make it again. But they did look like a beautiful after cooking in the oven.

Rating: 3
I used 3 large bananas and didn't bother dicing; just roughly chopped and sauteed them, then added them into the bean mixture and mashed the whole thing together with a potato masher. I liked doing smaller ones better; cutting the pastry into 16 squares instead of 9 makes a nice two-bite nibble. Simple and yummy!

Rating: 3
I wanted to make this for my son's 1st birthday party so I tried it out last week to see if it would be good. It was very yummy but definitely needed more banana. The black bean filling is not quite enough flavor just on its own and I found it was really spicy. I also found working with the puff pastry somewhat difficult (but I haven't worked with it much) to seal. It just didn't want to seal. This next time I plan to use crescent roll dough and add a LOT more banana - I thought that part would be the strangest but it was the best part of all and made my kitchen smell delicious while frying!

I made this last weekend, and everyone wanted the recipe. I had added 4 bananas instead of one because of other reviewers' suggestions, and am making them again right now, but with only 3 bananas. These are terrific! I was able to grab the last one before they were all gone!

Rating: 4
Fantastic!!! They were a smash hit!!!! I doubled up the recipe and used 5 bananas total! Then we had enough left over to have for a snack with sour cream the next afternoon! My only suggestion to anyone who wants to make these... make sure you prick the tops of the empanadas with a fork before baking. This made a world of difference between the dough being hard and crunchy and soft and flakey with!! Im off to make some more!

Rating: 3
Excellent...but considering how easy it is to make, it sure made a mess of my kitchen! I added sour cream just to make it a little moister, and used 3 bananas instead of 1. I took them to a potluck barbecue and served them cold - people raved.

Absolutely delicious!

Loved this recipe, but I made a few changes that I think made it tastier. I used three bananas instead of one, and might consider adding a fourth next time. I put the cilantro into the parcels raw, to retain more flavour. Make sure you don't skimp on the cheese. Next time I would mix everything together before stuffing, to get the proportions/mixture right. Accidently bought phyllo dough instead of puff pastry, but it's quite good on the lighter crust. If you get lazy, you can roll them up into little burritos, much quicker!

I was excited about the idea of interesting savory and sweet flavors together but ended up being disapointed by the lack of banana flavor and the general ho-hum outcome. I tried plaintains but it didn't seem to help. Maybe taking a cue from banana bread recipes and adding an overripe banana to the beans might help? I also felt they needed a dipping sauce which probably isn't authentic but they were a bit dry.

Rating: 2
I was a little disappointed by the outcome of the dish. After reading some many rave reviews, I had high expectations. I shouldn't have used phyllo sheets. Next time, I'm going to make my own dough. The filling was ok, but next time, I might try the plaintain to see if it comes out better.

I made this for a holiday party I was hosting and it was a big hit. I was skeptical of how it would turn out with the unusual combo of black beans, bananas and onions, but was pleasantly surprised.

This is a great, simple recipe that went over well at a recent cocktail party. Aside from the labor of stuffing them, they're very easy to make, and they are surprisingly flavorful (i.e. black beans, bananas, cumin, and cilantro doesn't sound too exciting, but the flavors meld very well when baked). A big hit with my guests--no leftovers!

I followed this recipe (something I rarely do) - but suspected there would be excess filling - indeed! Plan on making 24 empandas not 12 - and BTW the directions are off on the cutting out the squares. As per an earlier reviewer, I would increase the banana by 2 - their flavor is essential.

This four forker can be made even better by substituting authentic Latin American ingredients - ripe plantains for the bananas and queso fresco for the jack cheese. I have also found that the filling can become a bit dry when cooking, so save some of the liquid from your beans to add if needed. These are delicious both warm and cold.

So simple to make, with mouth-popping flavors. I made this for my book-club night and got rave reviews. One question for the reviewer who said it was horrible: Did you make it correctly? Or maybe it's just not a flavor combination to your taste. Does that make it a bad recipe? I think not. For an appetizer that is fun, flavorful and quite unique, this is a great choice.

I like black beans, I like bananas, I like cumin, and I love pastry dough. Does that mean they all taste good when mixed together? Absolutely not. This recipe was horrible. I stand guilty of the culinary cardinal sin of trying a recipe for a dinner party without a pre-taste, and we all laughed at how GOD-AWFUL these things were. No one took a second bite. That's the last time I try a 4 fork recipe that has less than ten reviews.

It was sooo delicious!!! I used it as a pass around starter for a cocktail party...HUGE hit....my husband and I ate the leftovers and I can't wiat to make it again, the sweet in the bananna adds just the touch to this faaaabulous dish....one thing, I will add more cheese later, a little less bean filling per empanada, definately less than a tablespoon.

This dish was very well-received, and I really messed it up by accidentally cooking the pastry dough when I tried to defrost in the microwave. I ended up rolling the filling into the dough and making pinwheels but everyone still loved them. I thought they would be too spicy but the plantains cut a lot of the heat.

I'm not going to rate the recipe because I made so many alterations...I had already defrosted the pastry and fried the bananas when I realized I was out of black beans. I drained a can of black bean soup and used it - and it came out great, even though I think it would have been much better with regular canned beans. I loved the filling and find puff pastry a little greasy for my tastes. Next time I will just make the fillings and use it as the insides of a burrito in a regular flour tortilla...

This was so dead easy and delicious. I was in a hurry so instead of making empanadas, I cut the pastry into 1 1/2" squares and just put the mixture on top. I baked it a bit less as the cheese was turning brown. Much quicker and a lot less pastry

Rating: 3
These turned out great, a mix of savory and sweet -- not to mention flaky with the puff pastry -- that makes these definitely not your ordinary empanadas (which I don't usually care for). My bean mixture was a bit dry by the time I was stuffing, for some reason. And I agree with the other cook who said it's a good idea to double the banana. I didn't have enough (and it's the banana that makes these yum yum, I think).

I usually make chicken or meat empanadas but this recipe was great for my vegetarian friends. I had some frozen fried plantains which are made by GOYA and you can find at markets with ethnic goods. I was out of cayenne pepper so I used crushed red pepper instead which gave it a great zing. I also used the pre-made empanada skins which you can also buy at the market hopefully. When I ran out of the black bean mixture I just used the fried plantains and cheese (queso fresco)-they cam out great as well. I will definitely make this again! They are delicious.

I replaced the bananas with potatoes in half of my empanadas and plantains in the other half. The potato and bean empanadas were delicious! I also used queso fresco instead of the MoJack. I'll definitely make them again, but maybe with some kind of spicy dipping sauce ....

Rave reviews for this one...fast and easy. Next time will use double the bananas. I also used a phyllo dough that didn't seem to have enough fat in it to make it stick to itself when trying to seal in the bean/banana mixture. Served w/sour cream, avocados, and a roasted red pepper puree...

I used a plantain, and queso blanco, but otherwise made as written. (Oh, yeah, I used pie crust instead of the puff pastry because I had it on hand, but I'll make the empanada crust next time-there are recipes on this site if you need one). The only other change next time (and there will be a next time in the near future) will be to combine the bean mixture, cheese and fried plantain together in a bowl and fill from that. Just makes it a little easier. Very good.

This is such a great recipe. Really fast, really flavorful. Served with a salad and sour cream for dinner - GREAT. I would make this again and again. I am going to try to make mini empanadas to have at my cocktail party this weekend.
