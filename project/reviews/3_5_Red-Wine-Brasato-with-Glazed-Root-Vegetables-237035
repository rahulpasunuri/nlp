First made this dish, when it came out in the magazine several years ago. Loved it then. Tonight, I made an even better tasting version. Used a moose shoulder roast and brasied it in the crock pot for 10 hours, while I was away at work. Came home, in -30 degree weather to the wonderful smell filling my house. It is most definitely "food for the gods". The moose meat has a delicate, slightly sweet taste which pairs wonderfully with the glazed root vegetables. Thank you Epicurious!!!

Even though it's a time consuming dish to prepare, it's well worth it. I didn't use sage and instead used fresh thyme. I also omitted the extra vegetable side dish at the end and made the "Creamy Polenta with Parmesan" instead: good choice! This recipe will definitely be my new "roast" recipe!

I loved this version. I also enjoyed the Gourmet version Jan 07.The readers looking for that - it is on this site as the english title of 'Beef Braised in Red Wine'. I re typed it with the title Brasato Al Barolo -

My husband and I made this on a cold and rainy Sunday and we LOVED it. What a great "comfort food" recipe this was. I now consider this my go to pot roast recipe.

This was a lot of work for an 'ok' dish. I agree that the sage can be overwhelming, especially with the vegetables.

This was good, but not unique enough to deserve 4 forks. Be careful not to over do the sage.

Fantastic. Wouldn't change a thing...including using leftoves for the Shepherd's Pie.

Excellent and easy to make. The only way my family will eat turnips.

The other recipe you are looking for is called 'Beef Braised in Red Wine'. Brasato al Barolo is in italics under the heading....that's why it doesn't come up when you search the recipes. I haven't tried this one, but the Beef Braised in Red Wine (Brasato al Barolo) is fantastic!

This dish was fantastic. A real hit with family and friends. A bit time consuming but well worth the effort. The shepherd's pie was also very delicious. Very rich flavors. Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe for my husband and in laws and everyone loved it!! I used a good cut of beef and my husband thought it was one of the tastiest roasts I'd ever made...very tender! I did not follow the recipe for the vegetables as written, but did cook them in the braisng liquid and then added them to the roast, leaving out the sugar. Delicious!

Can anyone please post the January 2007 Gourmet recipe for Brasato al Barolo? It was the BEST ever!! I accidentally misplaced it.

The end result was good, especially when the sauce was thickened a bit. However, for the time it took to cook (3 hours)I thought it was not worth it. I think traditional pot roast was easier and just as tasty. For that amount of time, I would expect a much more complex dish.

This was pretty good. The sauce was sort of thin though. I had to cook it down to almost nothing to get any body out of it. Anyway served with a side of brussels sprouts it made a nice winter meal but I'm going to have to pull out my Feb 2007 Gourmet to see what everyone is talking about. Maybe I'll try that one next time.

The recipe is OK, but not as good as the Gourmet recipe mentioned by others. The family liked it, but they loved the Shepherd's pie made with the leftovers. Great make-ahead food for them nasty Minnesnowta nights.

Wonderfully easy to make, made the house smell like home, and delicious!

Sorry about that. Searched Epicurious for Brasato and thought I was commenting on the recipe in the January 2007 issue of Gourmet, not this one from the February 2007 issue of Bon Apetit. Having now tried this one, I would say there is no comparison. Hopefully Epicurious will get the Gourmet recipe up on this site before long

I don't understand the last reviewers comments about a substitution for pancetta? I see no pancetta in this recipe.

Rating: 4
Fabulous taste, and easier than it looks. Used soprasato instead of the pancetta. I suspect any flavorful hard salami would work just fine. We are restricting carb intake, and paired with mashed cauliflower with roasted garlic, you've got a meal Dr. Atkins would have been delighted with.

I couldn't disagree more with the last review. Made this over the weekend and it was delicious! I did use a fennel bulb instead of the celery root because it is what I had on hand. The roast was very good and tender and the vegetables were fabulous!

Admittedly I was a little sloppy and didn't have the best cut of meat but didn't really like this. Much prefer another recipe on this site. Red-Wine Pot Roast with Porcini.
