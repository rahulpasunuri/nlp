I used one celeriac, 1 bag parsnips and yukon gold potatoes, maybe 10. Used 1/2 c milk and butter as listed. Lots of fresh ground pepper, little salt. It was very appealing, tasty, and held up well as a leftover and microwaved. It will be our defalt mashed potatoe recipe. That taste of celeriac and parsnip really added something to the potato.

I added a bay leaf to the boiling water, and used a hand masher to keep a slightly chunkier texture. I didn't add any milk, just butter and a bit of the cooking water was fine. I'll save that reserved water to add to a soup, I'd hate to pour all those nutrients down the drain.

This was a total waste! The flavour was less than bland, texture-terrible! I should have known better than to trust a russet. Skip this one, unless you wish to devote additional time to tinkering with hopes for the possibilty of palatability.

Delicately flavored - I used as little water as possible and drained as much as possible; I used a "butter-flavored olive-oil-based" spread instead of butter; I used half the amount of milk. (I measured out one cup, but added a little at a time to reach "mashed potato" consistency, and about a half cup was sufficient.) I served this with a spicy chicken dish. Contrasting textures and flavors work; I suspect serving this with a mild-flavored entree would not. Thinned down it could make an interesting lo-fat sauce. Thinned more it might even make a thick soup.

This side dish was bland, had poor texture, and took more time than it was worth.

What a great recipe! The celery root gives the dish such a wonderful flavor. A true hit!!!
