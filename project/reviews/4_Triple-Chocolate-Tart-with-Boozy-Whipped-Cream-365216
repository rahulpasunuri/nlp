Like yogascholarmom, I did not have enough crust, but it didn't matter - the filling was firm yet silky enough to make up for the lack of crust. Made this only because I had both chocolate stout and bourbon on hand, but it was a huge hit, so I will definitely make it again!

Delicious but I had two problems: 1) The crust instructions say to use 15 wafer biscuits but I ended up using the whole package to create a reasonable crust that filled according to directions, i.e. 1" up the sides of the pan. I used a standard springform pan. That wasn't a problem except I didn't have more almonds so the balance of almonds:cookie was off. It will still be tasty though. 2) The ingredients and shopping list say to use "heavy cream." Where I come from (Canada), "heavy cream" is different from "whipping cream." I bought what was listed in the recipe and it did not whip as it was supposed to. I had second-guessed it when I was shopping but decided to follow the instructions/shopping list as the website listed it. So now I'm going to be drinking some pretty rich coffee. ;)

Delicious, not excessively sweet. Very easy and little prep time relative to results! Roasting almonds took longer than 10 min for me, but everything else came together quickly. We keep our house at 65 degrees, and I was able to add the filling, which had already set up, to the partially cooled crust (I used oreos w/filling mostly removed), and I didn't give it a full 3 hours in the fridge, but still had excellent results.
