Alternatively, you can add a bed of kosher salt to your baking pan for an extra level of flavor. Another way to dress the beets is with a reduction of brunoise shallots, extra virgin olive oil and champagne vinegar. Take the dressing off the heat and let cool with a sprig of fresh rosemary.

Nothing special, served with Thanksgiving dinner and added nice color though!

A beet recipe for ALL. One Christmas Day dinner guest cautioned me that he dislikes beets but after tasting this recipe he is now a convert. I couldn't find baby beets but the large beets when cubed worked fine. My guests begged for more!

This was a nice addition to our annual New Year's Day rib roast dinner. I used yellow & red beets, but am hoping to find "candy cane" this year at the farmers market...can't wait!

Finding the baby beets was the hardest part (Wegman's came through with purple and yellow ones), and the second hardest part was peeling them once they were initially cooked. The end result, however, made for beautiful presentation and a nice complement to my Christmas dinner.

A wonderful beet recipe. Good tip below about wearing gloves to peel beets. Helps with clean up! I only put the beets in about an inch of water for the first roast and they came out beautifully.

A few hints, wear gloves when peeling beets, or take paper towels and rub the skins off. That is after they are roasted. I did not use the water, I simply roast them at 400 for 45-50 minutes, or until the tip of a knife easily pierces the beets. I drizzle mine with olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt and freshly ground pepper. Easy and quite delicious. I have been roasting beets, along with other vegetables for years, and roasting is my preferred method in the cold months.
