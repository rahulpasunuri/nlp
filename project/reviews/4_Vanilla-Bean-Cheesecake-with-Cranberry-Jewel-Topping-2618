I've been making this cheesecake since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. When fresh cranberries aren't in season I use canned cranberry sauce...I make it all year long! It is DELICIOUS!!!

The cheesecake was delicious. The glaze was tasty and a beautiful color but did not set up very much. I had to travel with it, and the glaze ended up sloshing over the sides even with careful driving. Great cake, but don't take it anywhere.

ooops, correction....been so many years now....I first used this recipe in '94 when it appeared in Bon Appetit and I was a subscriber. Then when I moved toward less paper in my life and stopped that, I was so happy to have found epicurious.com. I've recommended this site maybe as many times as I've made this cheesecake. Happy baking!

I have been making this cheesecake since about '93...when I met my husband. Cheesecake is his favorite dessert. I've MISTAKENLY tried a few other recipes because I was having some trouble with getting baked evenly. It would puff and crack and fall. THEN I learned a better strategy thx to Alton Brown and MArtha Stewarts recipe. Wrap the bottom and at least half up the sides with foil. Then Bake in a water bath a bit cooler at 325 for 50 minutes, then turn your oven off and let it sit for another 50 minutes. Resist the urge to peak...give it some privacy and it will come out baked perfectly even from edge to middle! Another good tip I picked somewhere is to put a dish towel in the bottom of your water bath pan. It will help to reduce the amount water you'll need and keep it from sloshing so much. And yes, it goes into the fridge hot.

I have been making this cheesecake for over 5 years at Thanksgiving and Christmas. I have received rave reviews each time I have made it. One year I ended up making 6 of them because I couldn't keep it in the house. This thanksgiving I used chocolate cookies for the crust and it was delicious!!

This was my very first time making cheesecake, and I could not be happier with the results. My boyfriend and I made this last night, and we were blown away by it. It was sooooo easy to make, and ridiculously delicious. We used vanilla waffers instead for the crust, and did not make the topping. And it was still DAMN GOOD. Will make this again as soon as I fully commit to exercising.

I bought some vanilla beans when I was Mexico and was looking for a good recipe to use them in. I used a store bought graham cracker crust, skipped the topping, and used 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese. I'm also a college student, and I had to make this in my magic bullet blender. It was fantastic. It had a great vanilla flavor and my friends gobbled it up. I made it a second time the same way stated above, but I stired in a cup of nutella in a cup of reserved batter and swirled that on top. It was even more delicious.

This is my family's favorite cheesecake and we enjoy it for dessert every Christmas. Easy to make & delicious!

I can only speak for the cheesecake and not the cranberry topping (which I'd like to try sometime). I made a ganache of 6 oz choc chips and 5 TBL heavy cream and poured on top of cooled cake (which hid the cracks). The cheesecake was wonderfully creamy and the vanilla came through beautifully. I would decrease the butter for the crust next time and eliminate the sugar or just use a graham cracker crust. The filling, however, will remain unchanged (except that I used reduced fat cream cheese without detection). A keeper for sure. Can't wait to make it again (and again and again).

I just used the filling in this recipe, but it was so easy, and came out perfectly. I will definitely use it again, and I think it would take modifications very well. I used the filling in a gingersnap crust, and for the topping used epicurious recipe for "Cranberry Sauce with Crystallized Ginger" - it was a fantastic combination!

This was a true winner! I made this for Christmas last year and can't seem to find anything else exciting enough to replace it this year. The crowd actually clapped after 1 bite, saying it was the best cheesecake they ever ate. I used 1/3 fat cream cheese and no one new the difference. The only thing is make sure to eat it all up quickly--leftovers are only so-so.

What a disappointment! This cheesecake puffed up tremendously during cooking, but then fell to 1/3 its height as it cooled. The texture was off, and the flavor was only so-so. I never made the topping because the cake was so unsightly. Perhaps it was my oven, given all the other fabulous reviews. I followed the recipe to a T. Too bad. I'm especially upset about the cost of the vanilla beans.

Rating: 4
This was probably the best cheesecake I've ever made, and I've made many. The texture was perfect, I made it in the food processor, and was careful not to overmix after adding the eggs. I cooked it at 325 convection, in a water bath half way up the sides, for 40 min. Then I turned off the oven, left the door slightly ajar, and let it cool for 30 min. Then I ran a knife around the edge of the cake/pan to make sure as it contracted it would not crack. I picked up this tip from a book a long time ago, and it is the foolproof way to prevent cracks (along with not overbaking) The topping was great contrast, its tartness playing off the sweetness and creaminess of the filling. I used traditional graham cracker crust. For presentation, I piped sweetened whipped cream rosettes on the rim of the cake and then added gold dusted cranberries and caramel angel hair. It was amazing!! Everyone at the party love it. 8 people, only one small piece left!

Rating: 4
This was an awesome cheesecake. I made a few adjustments though. For the crust I used an entire box of the shortbread girl scout cookies and a stick of melted butter. I also didn't use the cranberry topping (only because the person for whom I baked this cake didn't like cranberries). I instead topped it with a white chocolate mousse. I also recommend buying the heavy-duty aluminum foil to get a sheet large enough to covere the entire bottom of your spring form pan and bake it in a water bath.

Rating: 4
This is probably one of the, if not the best vanilla cheesecake I've ever tasted. It has a perfect consistancy and a wonderful vanilla flavour, which in perfect harmony with the flavour of the cranberry jewel topping. I made it this past Christmas and used a chocolate crust , it was awesome, everyone raved about it. I also made chocolate stars and stood them vertically on top of the cake. This made for a very impressive presentation.To date , this is my favourite Christmas dessert.

I've been making this recipe since 1994. I'm SO glad it is still online! Yay to Epicurious for keeping such a wonderful archive. I have made it with vanilla beans and vanilla wafer crust as directed and also just used (real) vanilla and graham cracker crust when I didn't have the ingredients. This is a gorgeous cheesecake and delicious. I just made the Epicurious cranberry sweet rolls yesterday and will use the leftover strained cranberry syrup for this cheese cake today.

This dish was fabulous. I made it for Thanksgiving dinner. I put water in my oven to mimick a convection oven as other reviewers suggeested. I didn't get a perfect cheesecake, but the cracks were minimal. Plus, the great topping covered up the crack! I thought the crust would be a bit sweet, but it was all perfect. I also used vanilla extract since my crazy supermarket was out of vanilla beans. I used 3 teaspoons of vanilla per bean. (ratio found on the internet) It turned out really nice. I'll definitely make this again, thank you!

YUM! This is my new standby cheesecake recipe. It's light textured and rich flavored, so if you're looking for a dense cake this probably isn't it. The flavor was perfect, though, and I'm sure I'll make it with other toppings. I saved a few unpopped cranberries from the topping and used those as rosette centers for decoration--a great tip from another reviewer. I also think the cake is versitile to make with different crusts. I can't wait to make it again.

After reading other reviews of this recipe, I thought I would add a few notes, from my experience. If you use the pan size specified the cheesecake will be very high and not thin at all. Be sure to use vanilla creme sandwich cookies, not vanilla wafers; the crust is not meant to go up the sides completely. In my experience, cracking on top is the result of overbaking, so err on the side of underbaking. Pressing the berries through the sieve is easier if you cook them much longer than indicated. Adding a whole berry to each whipped cream rosette makes a pretty presentation. This is a great cheesecake.

Family and friends demand this cheesecake for every Thanksgiving and Christmas. Be sure not to overcook the cake itself, but cook the berries a little longer than indicated, before pressing through the sieve.

I would make this cheese cake again but I might have to go on Lipitor. The vanilla beans worked beautifully. No need to add vanilla extract. I should have used light cream cheese but I must say that the cream mixed in with the whole cream cheese made a really creamy cheese cake. I tripled the vanilla wafer crust and I am glad I did because a lot of it seemed to melt away in the oven. I did not use the traditional vanilla wafers so this may be why. I merely put fresh strawberries on top but I am sure the cranberries are nice. Wonderful cheese cake but very rich.

Thank you reviewers! Most of you were 'right on' about this one. I made this cake exactly as written, for a dinner party the day prior. Not only was it delicious, but the easiest one I have ever made. The flavor, texture, crust...everything was perfect. If you like a creamy smooth cheesecake, this is it! Although it was pretty as it was....I couldn't stop myself...added a little candy art ...just a few thin curls of an orange to the very center with a couple of tall "Carmamel Squiggles"standing up. ( from a Fine Cooking magazine... made from a simple syrup cooked down) Great presentation...as the glass look went well with the stained glass look of the topping. A 'keeper' for sure! Making another for Christmas Day!

I followed the recipe exactly for the cheesecake and crust, and it was delicious. Instead of the jewel topping as directed, I combined the cranberries, the sugar and the water, simmered the mixture until it thickened and served a spoonful (which included the cooked whole berries) on each slice. It got wonderful reviews!

Made this for Thanksgiving, and everyone was very positive about it. I, too,used a plain graham cracker crust and found it delicious. I also placed a pan of hot water in the bottom of the oven while baking to prevent cracking and drying out; it was effective on both scores. The only negative aspect to this recipe is the quantity specified--we found the cake and crust a little thin and would have liked more of both. I am making this again and plan to double both for a substantial amount of cake.

I found the vanilla taste to be underwhelming and the cranberry glaze too tart, but my guests liked the cake. For the price of vanilla beans, this cake should be better. After reading all of the rave reviews, I was quite disappointed in this cake.

While this cheesecake is certainly delicious, I have found the vanilla taste to be so-so. The second time I made this I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. I also found that the cranberry topping is a little too tart and not really worth all the trouble. I broke the handle off my KitchenAid strainer trying to press the topping through it, which I was not very pleased about. Using cherry pie filling instead is a great idea. I also found that the cheesecake and crust cooked too quickly at 350 or even 325; next time I will try 300! I was only able to cook the cheesecake for 30 minutes at the temperature suggested, the crust burned around the edges and the top of the cake was brown and cracked. Fortunately the topping hid the state of the cake, and it still tasted very good.

The cheesecake part of this recipe is great. I usually just put a sour cream and sugar topping on it as I found the cranberry sauce pretty but not "wow". I have tried doing both the cranberry and the sour cream (two layers) but it dripped. I also use a standard graham cracker crust with chopped nuts and some vanilla, rather than the vanilla cookie crust (too sweet).

I liked it even though I'm not a big cheesecake fan. I will make it again if only because it got so many compliments from my guests. Better at room temperature though. Right from the fridge the crust was a little hard.

I have made this cheesecake multiple times, ever since I first read it in the 1994 issue...it was my first attempt at a cheesecake, and I was nervous.

I just copied this recipe and will try it. I love the Vanilla Bean Cheesecake served @ Red Lobster, I think it's from the Cheesecake Factory and wanted to make one myself. I read where someone is having trouble with cheesecake cracking. If you are not using a convection oven then put a pan of water in your oven on a bottom or middle rack ( whichever your cheesecake isn't on)this will allow moisture to circulate in your oven just like a convection oven and should prevent the cracking. Use a cake pan and fill it most of the way with water. I have done this after many cracked cheesecakes and it has served me well. Good luck.

This is possibly my favorite cheesecake recipe. It has a great basic filling with which one may improvise.

i have yet to make this but i wanted to respond to a comment about why cheesecakes crack..a cook from boston said that if you beat the batter until it is smooth, that it will not crack..this actually would incorporate more air into the filling, making it more likely to rise and fall in the oven, thus cracking. I think you need to gently stir the ingredients together until incorporated, not whipping a lot of air into it..

I made this dish as per the recipe and found that the crust was not "too sweet" as some might think. The Vienna Fingers really bring out the vanilla-y flavor. If you really don't want to use the creme-filled cookies, I'd suggest vanilla wafers instead of graham though. Everyone, including my sister (not a cranberry lover) and her husband (not a cheesecake fan) LOVED this dessert!

I have a bakery business from my home and 1/2 of my business is cheesecakes...this one is fabulous! I thought it acted strange in the oven in that it looked like it was puffing up before it was realy done, but after chilling it was smooth and completely set. The filling is wonderfully creamy and understated, the cranberry topping a perfect contrast and the crust was more than just "something to hold it together". I did think the topping recipe made too much and I only used about 1/3 of it. I garnished with sugared cranberries brushed with gold dust and whipped cream. I am wondering what it would be like with a ribbon of cranberry through the center and a carmelized sugar topping (like brulee)? Definately a keeper!

Although time-consuming and rich, this cheesecake is extraordinary. My family loves it so much, it has become a Christmas time tradition.

I was worried the cheesecake would be too sweet but the cranberry topping was tart enough to balance it out nicely. I adore cheesecake and am working on perfecting my own recipe and technique.

I made this with a graham cracker crust and it was delicious, though not as great as I hoped. The vanilla bean procedure was much easier than it sounds, and tasted delicious in the pot... but somehow, I couldn't really taste the vanilla bean flavor in the cake once it was all done. The cranberry topping was great, but I put it in the fridge for several hours before serving and the result was a topping that was bascially a solid jelly... in retrospect, I wish I had not chilled it because I would have preferred a runnier topping.
