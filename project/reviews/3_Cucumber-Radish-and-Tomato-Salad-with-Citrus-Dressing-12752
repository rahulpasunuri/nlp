Pretty good and certainly easy to make. Add some chopped jalapeno for a little bite and more "authentic" flavor.

I made it, but forgot to buy cilantro. So I used fresh oregano. I also ran out of limes when I was making drinks, so I only used lemons and omitted the radish. It was good, I would probably add some crumbled queso fresco.

This is, basically, Thai-style salad, only without fish sauce and hot peppers. Refreshing, tasty, but nothing special, really.

I made this with sugar snap peas instead of radishes. The dressing was kind of funky. I had to add what seemed like a lot of sugar to balance out the tartness and the garlic, though I love lemon and garlic. I liked the crunch but I'd probably make my own dressing next time.

This was a fresh dish with a fresh taste. I made it for a fiesta and added a little fresh cilantro and everyone loved it!!!
