as the recipe is, it's pretty bland, so I did what others suggested: added crushed red pepper, fresh basil, plus I put in some chopped tomatoes to give it color and a little natural sweetness which was a nice complement. this way, it becomes a 4-star recipe.

Well the reviewers who said this was just so-so are correct. This recipe was very boring and the dish didn't have much substance. There are plenty of really yummy ways to cook eggplant, but this isn't one of them. I'm deleting this from my recipe box immediately.

You'd never know this recipe is so old. It's classic. However, it serves 4 -- as a main course. I made the recipe to serve 6, and ended up with a HUGH amount of food. I would cut down on the onions a little as I found them too much. The topping is especially delicious, the best part of the dish.

followed some of the other reviewers recommendations and added 3 garlic cloves and some crushed pepper, very good indeed. next time will try adding 2 tomatoes as well, eggplant just goes so great with tomatoes. My husband especially liked it because the eggplant doesn't get soaked in oil like in so many other dishes, the steaming helps on that one.

Recipe is Ok for side dish, not very impressive. Tasty and very easy.

This recipe is simple and easy to put together. I used "Chicken-y" flavored mashed potato flakes and the result is yummy! I would definitely recommend it. Oops! Wrong recipe!

Made this to use an eggplant that was lingering in the fridge. Went well with the Parmesan Chicken (the english muffin one) and the Balsamic Roasted Carrots on this site. It is okay, not the best eggplant dish ever, but easy and few ingredients. Be sure to cook the onion until it is quite tender.

I added some chopped garlic and red pepper flakes to the onion the second time I made this. I was happier with the result. This is an easy and tasty side dish.

Certainly easy and quick, decent tasting but not exciting... I also used fresh basil and added some thinly sliced purple potatoes... next time I may add red or yellow bell peppers and maybe a balsamic redux?

I was not impressed. I think the greek style eggplant on this site was much better.

I enjoyed this, and it was incredibly easy and fast to prepare. It wasn't amazing, but it was a nice change of pace and a good side dish for the Chicken, Onions, and Tomatoes (Chicken Marengo), also on Epicurious. I will probably make it again, but with less parsley.

This was pretty good and fairly easy, but I think there are other (better) ways of preparing eggplant. It was worth making once, but it won't become a favorite in my home.

It looked delicious, but it didn't taste good. I didn't keep it long enough to try the left overs.

Great and unusual side dish, even my eggplant-hating husband liked it. I substituted basil and asagio cheese but it was still delicious.

I should probably wait and try the leftovers (which people are raving about) before rating this one, but I just wasn't that impressed. I got compliments on it, but I found that there was too much parsley and not enough cheese. Easily remedied, I suppose, but maybe not worth the trouble.

this was very easy and made a delicious dinner served with spaghetti with garlic and olive oil. I will definitely make this again soon.

liked the leftovers muuuuuuuuch more than the 'right-out-of-the-oven' product. had to do with the blending of onions and eggplant.

This is so easy and delicious. I will definitely make this again.

It was as good as the reviews said. I made it in a large glass pan with a relatively thin layer of steamed eggplant. I doubled the recipe, and it made plenty of topping.

You've done it again--another great recipe. I was even short on the cheese, and it still turned out wonderfully. Reheats easily and is delicious as a left over. Thanks, Epicurious, the recipes from your website are consistently our favorites.

You need to make this in a 3quart dish as specified. I made this in a 2 quart dish and a lot of the eggplant was not covered by the breadcrumbs. This did not ruin the dish but I could tell that it would taste better spread out more. This is a very good side dish.

I love eggplant and this is by far one of my favorite eggplant dishes. I have made it many times and never get tired of it. I used seven grain bread for bread crumbs and it gave it a wonderful flavor. One tip: make sure the eggplant is well steamed, the gratin will get watery if not.

Simple, tasty, we all loved it!

This is a very easy and delicious recipe. I used a little more eggplant and onion than was called for because of the size of both that I had. Followed the recipe for everthing else and no leftovers were available after a small salad and this dish as the main entree for my wife and I. Highly recommend this to everyone.

My husband really liked it - in fact he ate most of it. I was so-so about it, mostly because I thought it would be a heavier dish (it is very light). I also used a little too much parsley, which didn't help. I'd make it as a side dish for get togethers.

DO NOT use dried parsley. Fresh helps add moisture. I tried substituting 1/2 the amout of bread crumbs with 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 seasoned croutons. THIS WAS WONDERFUL!!!!

My boyfriend and I decided that we wanted to eat eggplant, and randomly found this recipe from the website. It turned out great - he was shouting in ecstacy to the neighbors about how delicious it was! The only change I'd suggest is using slightly less cheese and breadcrumbs.

We tried this one before Thanksgiving and are making it again for the big day! Very Good and Light too...

This is wonderful and if you have any leftovers (a big if) they are even better the next day.

Better than I expected. I have failed with eggplant before - this time I was careful to press all the water out of it after steaming. This seems to be the key. I also used bread crumbs with Italian spices in them. This dish would be nice to serve in individual ramekins.
