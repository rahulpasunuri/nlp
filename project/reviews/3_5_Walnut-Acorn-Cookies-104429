These always come out wonderful. I just made another batch for Christmas to be shipped off to family. So easy to make yet so impressive looking. You need to try these!

I am not sure that I love these cookies. Although, they present very well and have gotten compliments from other tasters. My dough was very crumbly and the finished cookie - although keeping its shape - had a very shortbread/sandy texture which I wasn't expecting. Followed recipe except to sub whole wheat flour for white and softened butter for melted.

This is a great recipe!! Easy and very tasty!! I might making my cookies a little too big b/c I can only get about two dozen cookies per batch.

These cookies are a guaraneed hit with friends and family. They look impressive and taste delicious. I make them year after year. Also, they wrap extremely well and make great gifts or thank yous for house guests.

Suddenly inspired to bake something, I searched for a recipe calling for ingredients that I already had in my kichen . . . and I came across this one. Well, one thing I lacked: chocolate. No big deal, I thought. Well, these cookies turned out to be a not-too-sweet sweet-tooth satifaction, cooked perfectly to be very slightly chewy, accompanied by the crunch of walnuts. One (other) thing lacked . . .. I really think that these could benefit from a little spice- some cinnamon, perhaps. My advice: add it if you don't intend to coat them in luxurous and decadent chocolate! Not that you would be able to satify any chocolate cravings with this pinky-nail sized cookie, stretched to make the four dozen cookies the recipe promises to yeild!

When I first entered the baking world about 5 yrs ago, this was the first cookie I made. I have not learned to make many others, as everyone wants me to make this one year after year... Fantastic!

This is my favorite cookie recipe. I've made these cookies many times, and they always turn out perfectly! I also love the cookies plain (without the chocolate topping), since you taste the walnuts a little more that way. But any way you eat them, they're AMAZING, and they make a great gift because they look fancy and hard to make (though they're quite easy).

I tried this and when I put it in the oven the dough spread like a normal cookie and did not retain its shape. They taste pretty good though, reminds me of a shortbread cookie. So I'm going to give this another try but leave out the baking powder, hopefully that will prevent it from spreading and help keep its shape.

These cookies have a wonderful buttery flavor and light, crunchy texture. The only variation I made from the recipe was toasting the walnuts for the decoration.

I've included this cookie on holiday gift plates for 2 years now, and it is always one of the most popular. The brown sugar and melted butter give a toffee-like flavor and an extra crunch to the cookies. Their simple, cute shape also make a great change from the usual gaudy red and green holiday cookies.

These cookies are a delight to the eye as they are to the tummy!! Just adorable and delicious! Adding them to my Christmas cookie collection!

Flavour isn't as good as the many other nut cookie recipes I've tried! Rather dry and hard in texture. Would not use melted butter next time (softened would work better). Although I followed instructions carefully, and used quality ingredients, I was very disappointed in the end results!

This is one of the best cookie recipes I've ever tried! I used pecans instead of walnuts and didn't melt the butter. I also chilled the dough overnight. Fun and easy to make, turned out delicious and very cute!!

These are simple and scruptious - we had "rolling and dipping" help from the kids. I'm going to make the Maple Leaf cookies to accompany these sweet little acorns.

The cookie - which I only made for a Cookie Walk because our house is named Squirrel Haven - was the smash hit of the event. Had friends begging me for the recipe.

Wonderfully easy! Delicious! Crispy buttery bottom. I preferred to flatten the cookie with the bottom of a glass dipped in water. After baking/cooling, I placed 1 teaspoon melted chocolate on top of each cookie and garnished with a halve of a walnut. I can't keep my husband out of them!

I was a little nervous while making these cookies when my melted butter, brown sugar and vanilla did not come up "light and fluffy". It was more just smoothly mixed and runny, but, not to worry! After adding the other ingredients according to the directions(make sure to measure the nuts after chopping!), and baking the first batch, we were very pleasantly surprised! I needed 11 dozen cookies to take to a cookie exchange, and was worried my family would eat too many! I did two double batches of these cookies, and got about 12 dozen cookies. Delicious! Will definitely make this part of my Christmas cookie repertoire.

I thought these cookies were easy to make and look fantastic. I got rave reviews. I also tried "frosting" the tops with nutella instead of dipping in chocolate. People really seemed to love this combination.

These cookies were outstanding. They look beautiful, and people were falling over themselves to have another one. (Mine held their shape fine... didn't do anything special.) My kindergartener helped me make them.

Absolutely fabulous!! I made these for my friends and they loved them. I made six different kinds of cookies this holiday and these were the best. The chocolate and walnuts complimented the cookie wonderfully. The best cookie I've ever made!

Wow, what a fabulous Christmas Cookie or anyday cookie for that matter. I made the dough about a week ago, rolled the acorn shapes, placed them on a cookie sheet lined in plastic and froze them. When they were frozen solid, I place them in a zippered freezer bag. I baked them last night and I can tell you they will soon be gone. Mine flattened out as well, but who cares, they are delicious. I'm enjoying one right now with my morning coffee...mmmmm

Fabulous!! I chilled dough for an an hour prior to forming shapes and baking. Gave cookies away for Christmas. Everyone is raving these are the absolute best cookie ever. This is so good I know I'll be making them year-round.

I also found that things were not right, so I came online to read any reviews - by the time I got back to my butter and sugar it had cooled. I rebeat it and it then became light and fluffy. Everything else went well - cookies held their shape beautifully - got 6 dozen instead of 4. Merry Xmas everyone!!

To paraphrase, a Walnut Acorn Cookie in any other shape tastes just as sweet! I made my cookies today after reading the earlier reviews so I chilled my dough thoroughly before baking. The cookies still flattened out and ended up looking sort of like the Pepperidge Farm Milano cookies. I used candy sprinkles on mine after dipping in the chocolate. They taste great so I will definitely make them again.

These cookies were great. Mine didn't maintain their acorn shape; they flattened as they baked. Perhaps if they were refrigerated before spooning it would solve the problem. I dipped half of the cookies in colored sprinkles after the chocolate because my children don't like nuts. Because the cookies flattened out I couldn't dip them in the chocolate, I had to spoon the chocolate over the bottom, but the end result was the same. I would definitely make these cookies again.

Saw the recipe in your December issue and decided this was a little different to bring to a cookie party. Made the dough ahead of time and chilled. Brought to room temperature. The cookies look great on a platter. Stood them up with the chocolate on edge and added a few pieces of xmas candy. I only got 3 dozen cookies but next time I will make a little smaller because they are rich.

This recipe calls for melted butter resulting in an extremely soft dough, which the recipe does not say to chill prior to forming. I tried a test cookie and it did not hold its shape. I'm chilling the dough to see if that will help, but I would recommend not melting the butter. If the chilling doesn't help I'll have to toss the dough and start over.
