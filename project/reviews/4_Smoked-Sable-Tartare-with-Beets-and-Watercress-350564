A delicious start to Thanksgiving. Sablefish is *only* packaged as black cod in my area. As the recipe says, this fish is silky and delicious - some guests said they prefered it to smoked salmon. Will probably make this with arugula instead of watercress next time as it was a little hard to eat...but so delicious.

Remarkably easy and quite elegant. A really nice flavor combo.

Had this for Thanksgiving dinner at a friend's house and it was amazing. Everything about it is fantastic.

Delicious! I'd never had smoked sable before and it's definitely worth the hunt. Very moist and the perfect combination with my fabulous farmer's market beets.
