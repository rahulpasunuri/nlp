To John re: Really? too much work to include this amazing whole grain to your diet? How about investing the half hour one time a week then gently rewarming rice on the stovetop for a weeknight dinner.

I love the contrast this rice makes with many foods. I use white rice in all its forms (basmati, jasmine, parboiled, sushi, etc) but black rice looks, tastes and feels so different. I add a dollop of seasame oil to enrich the flavor.

Far too complicated a recipe for everyday dining. Avoid.

This rice is a tad chewy and nutty and cooks in the same amount of time as white rice. I use 1.5 cups of water for every cup of rice.

love,love,love this rice! I make mine in my rice cooker and add water 2 to 1, though making it this way works fine. I serve with roasted root veggies which are soft and sweet with the great chewiness of this rice. Also called Forbidden Rice
