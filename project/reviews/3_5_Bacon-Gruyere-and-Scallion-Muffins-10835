I made these this morning and they had all disappeared by lunchtime. Quick, easy and delicious. Next time I think I'll add a bit more cheese and bacon, to boost the flavour a little.

These were really good. The only substitution I made was using buttermilk in the place of milk. I agree with another reviewer who said these don't keep very well. A day after making, they were fine but not as moist as when fresh baked.

These weren't as flavorful as I would have liked. I think I'll go back to the stilton biscuits also on this site for my brunch bread. I might try it with more cheese and bacon?

I used pancetta instead of bacon and muffins where heavenly. I will use a more flavorful cheese today when I make them again...I agree with the cook who said the guyre flavor was lost. This is a keeper.

A great birthday surprise from my budding 17 year old chef. She followed the recipe as is and made them in the silicon heart shaped muffing pan she bought as by birthday gift. We're sure to make them again with great memories of the first baking!! Thanks Epicurious for being such a great resource.

Damn yummy and smells divine while cooking. Worked fabulously with a split pea soup.

Delicious. Made as written. (Alright, I added extra bacon, but that was a no brainer.) I might add extra scallions next time around, too -- everything holds together quite nicely.

I'm not adding forks because I altered the recipe quite a bit (if I was to rate it, it would be 3 forks). I didn't have scallions, so I diced some onions and carmelized them instead. I didn't add mustard (hate the stuff) but added a little bit of diced fresh jalapenos. I also used used three cheeses (cheddar, feta, and pecorino). I thought the basic "muffin" recipe was very good and versatile -- very fluffy texture and held up all the ingredients. Went great with soup.

Forgot to add the gruyere and mustard due to preparatory confusion caused by arrival home of husband; however, the results were quite tasty anyway. Only used 4 slices of thick-cut bacon, but added fresh thyme and fresh sage and used melted butter instead of bacon fat. As a result, no trouble with heaviness. Next time, will use good extra virgin olive oil and not forget the cheese, though will probably reduce amount.

These muffins turn out more like biscuits & tasted more like an omelette. They were a little dry & the taste of the gruyere was completely lost. I will not be making this again... sorry!

I love this recipe! I made these muffins last year for Thanksgiving and for a soup party I was invited to and they disappeared! When I left a message for my friend and suggested I bring them to the soup party again this year, I got a return call in minutes and she told me her mouth was watering just thinking about them! One word - Yummy.

These muffins were aMAZing and I definitely plan on making the recipe again, but I have to say, they do NOT keep well ... I made these the afternoon before a brunch and, while they were okay after reheating, the thrill was gone. Also I think they would make the perfect accompaniment for something like split pea or white bean soup, rather than a brunch dish. As for any ingredient changes I'd recommend, I agree with the "more cheese, more bacon" review ... and I think I'll try a thicker-sliced bacon, as well.

An instant favorite at any meal! Buttermilk in the batter does add a nice flavor. Didn't find them heavy at all-- don't add wet ingredients until just before baking, and they are light and fluffy. I loved the flavor combination, so on my second try I added EXTRA bacon, cheese, and scallions. Delicious!

I really like these muffins and so have all those to whom I've served them - and I've served them a lot. I omit the salt, as I think the bacon and cheese make them salty enough, and I use buttermilk instead of regular milk for a more interesting taste. In my oven, 15 minutes is just right - and 20 is too long.

Hello? These muffins are great! Even after I stopped eating meat, I omitted the bacon and fat and made them and they're still great. I substituted the fat with butter. I have made these many times. They have never turned out "too heavy". They are moist and crumbly, the way a muffin should be.

I agree with the comment that these were not particularily flavorful. I found them kind of boring and blah.

overall it was good, although I did not think the batter/bread part was particularly flavorfull. It was very dense and filling.

These muffins are very satisfying. Make sure not to stir them too much because they have a tendency to be heavy. They were easy to make, and I like the flavors. They are a substantial muffin. Quite filling. Use the best quality ingredients for best results.

I make these muffins often, but I usually add a little more buttermilk and omit the bacon fat, for obvious reasons -
