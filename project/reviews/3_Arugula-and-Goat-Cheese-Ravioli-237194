Used this recipe for my first foray into past making. A friend brought over her Kitchen Aid attachments and expertise and introduced us. She was impressed with this dough's elasticity, as were we, and we were all impressed with the flavor and texture of the cooked ravioli. The dough was great to work with, easy to roll out and stretch onto the ravioli molds without cracking or shrinking. I thought the bitter, peppery bite of the arugula overpowered the mild goat cheese and the rich and subtle butter/pine nut sauce. If I made this filling again, I would: use the same amount of a stronger goat cheese (I used Trader Joe's creamy spread), use more ricotta, use less arugula and cut it with spinach, and not garnish with fresh arugula. I think 3/4lb of greens would be plenty and 1/4 of arugula would go a long way. Otherwise, it was delicious. Flavorful, rich, and filling!

Great combination of ingredients and a wonderful lunch or dinner outcome accompanied with a nice bottle of white wine! Thank you for sharing!

One of my favorite ravioli recipes. I have made this recipe many times, and always have great success. It really is about the quality of your ingredients. The time involved is well worth it.

This is a nice recipe. If you are relatively new to pasta making (like me), make extra dough as some gets wasted expiramenting with the rolling process. Also, I'd cook the ravioli's in smaller batches -- with just 2-3 minutes cooking time, its hard to get them all in and out in time. The filling is delicious, the sauce is very heavy, however. Be sure to pair it with something that cuts through the heaviness like a bright wine or, in my case, some carrots dressed with basalmic vinegar.

Unbelievably delicious. Served these as a first course at a dinner party to rave reviews. Beautiful presentation and unbeatable flavor! Make them when you have plenty of time on your hands. The pasta portion of the recipe has become my go-to recipe for ANY type of fresh pasta. It is smooth and has great elasticity.

I don't know why people are so mean to other bloggers. "A Cook from Salt Lake City, Utah" could have suggested a few of the filling alternatives to Cooking Lover, instead of commenting their dislike on goat cheese. not everyone likes goat cheese. I love it but i won't hold it against anyone who prefers another type of cheese. Anyway. Cooking Lover here are a few suggestions (if you read back this far, since you wrote over a year ago) use about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese with the ricotta and i would switch the rocket to spinach. (goat cheese and rocket complement each other as spinach and parmesan) you can also add a bit of mozzarella cheese, with a pinch of nutmeg. enjoy!

For the effort, I would recommend the Swiss Chard Ravioli available on epicurious.com. This was okay, but it seemed unnecessarily complicated. In the end, there were too many flavors going on at once. For example, the arugula pretty much overwhelms the goat cheese.

I confess that I have not made this filling....exactly...but I have been making ravioli for years and this pasta dough is wonderful....smooth elastic and delicious. I use it often

This recipe was a disaster. My raviolis were floppy, chewy, and had the consistancy of rubber with mushy filling. I will try to make them again though, I think I messed up the dough for the pasta.

I am now thoroughly impressed by how much work goes into ravioli. My guests thought they were quite divine, but I felt that they didn't have much taste to them.

I've made this recipe several times using different mixtures of greens (arugula/spinach even a little chard) as well as different proportions of goat cheese and fresh ricotta, depending on the bite of the greens or desired sweetness of the result. Each has been successful and raved about by diners! A great Sunday "project" meal.

If you don't like or can't abide by goat cheese (whatever that means), make something else. There are tons of recipes for fillings on this site.

My husband is not a fan of goat cheese either, so I only used ricotta. The arugula already has enough "bite"/bitterness, thus a mellow ricotta complements it well. If making ahead, be sure to follow the directions concerning laying the ravioli on floured dishcloth. I made the mistake of using wax paper which made them stick. This was my 1st attempt at ravioli, it's timeconsuming yet far superior to store-bought.

I'm sorry to rate this already since I haven't made it. I cannot abide goat cheese and am asking your opinions about a cheese that would have about the same texture as a goat cheese that would be complementary in this dish. I'm more interested in testing the technique for ravioli than I am in the filling right now, but of course something must go in between those two layers of dough! Thanks for your help.
