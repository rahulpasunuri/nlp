Love these! My go to brownie recipe. Cross between fudgy and cake. I always use regular chocolate chips and drop in a few extra.

My 15 year old son makes these all the time. He doubles the amount of chocolate chips (he doesn't like white chocolate) and leaves out the baking powder to make a fudgier brownie. He gets requests for these all the time. Yum.

They tasted good but they were far too soft. I cooked them for longer than necessary and added extra flour to the dough but their were still too liquid. There are far better recipes out there for brownies.

I've been looking for a recipe that makes a similar brownie to the box version. This one is the closest I've found. My husband is very particular about his brownies, he wants them fudgy, which these are, but still crumbly on top, which these are. The added white chocolate makes them extra special.

Very very good, liked the texture of the brownies. However I doubled the amount of white chocolate chips, because it just didn't seem like it would be enough, and in my opinion, it wouldn't have been.

My family really enjoyed these brownies and because they were so moist and cakey I did not need to add frosting. Very delicious!

these brownies serve very well with fresh fruit, (we used strawberries) and breyers vanilla ice cream. I will add walnuts to the recipe next time.

Just the right amount of moisture I think. Not too dry and not real fudgy tasting. Give them a try. .

This is my absolute favorite brownie recipe. I've been making these since the March '93 issue arrived at my house. They're cake-like, not chewy, but they're perfect for a base to add on fruit, ice cream, etc., without getting too messy. I've made them with white chips, various nuts, M&M's or just plain, depending on the occasion.

Delicious, fast and easy: three best things in a recipe! I'm sure these are great with other flavor chips, too, but I really liked the taste of the white chocolate in such a rich, fudgy brownie. I used Ghiradelli white choc. chips.

Nice moist brownies that aren't overly fudgy. For people who like their brownies more cakey.

I doubled the recipe and quadrupled the chip using a mixture of semi-sweet, white, and butterscotch. These brownies were rich and fudgy.

Surprisingly rich; I added walnuts.
