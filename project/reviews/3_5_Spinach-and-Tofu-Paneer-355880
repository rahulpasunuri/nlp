Made this dish almost exactly as written. Excellent flavor! Not bland! Used whole jalapeno with seeds (no other pepper or cayenne needed)and it had plenty of heat. Instead of steaming, I just wilted a huge head of spinach in frying pan with a little oil. Will try garam masala next time, but delicious without it!

For vegans or those not interested in learning to make - or able to readily purchase - paneer, this recipe results in a pretty satisfying substitute for the classic Indian dish. I usually increase the spices a bit. It works fine with thawed frozen spinach as well.

I wish Deborah Madison specified the size of the spinach bunch, as the bag I had, about the size of a small grocery store bag of spinach would be, cooked down to nothing at all and I had to add some broccoli I had in the fridge to get enough veggies for a meal. Also, I found the dish to be spicy and flavorful, but nothing like paneer and frankly not worth the trouble.

I added the entire jalapeno, sans seeds, and the serrano with about a 1/4 of the seeds, figuring that I could adjust the heat using the cayenne once all the items were blended and back on the pan. I would recommend this as it is sometimes hard to gauge the heat of the actual pepper and the heat varies tremendously (sometimes the pepper on its own without the seeds is plenty). Instead of half and half, I used about 1/4-1/2 cup of full fat coconut milk and about a 1/4 cup of milk. this added an amazingly round flavor in combination with the ginger and peppers...yum. I also used Greek Fage yogurt which also added great body and creaminess. Per everyone's tip I added about a tsp of garam masala. I added a bunch of just-wilted extra whole fresh spinach right before serving. the result was far from bland. Definitely would recommend and make again--quick and easy.

I just returned from India. How could anything I prepare actually come close to my current tastes for such dishes? Darned good, however - especially for tofu.

While this is certainly not an authentic Saag Paneer, I do think it is a delicious and healthier version of this dish. I agree that the heat from the chiles overwhelmed the other spices a bit (although this could be because I only used half the amount of half-and-half called for in this recipe). I think I would recommend cutting the serrano chile in half and disposing of the seeds on one half of the chile to tone down the heat a bit.

Loved this! Only changes I made were I used a whole jalapeno (with seeds) and no serrano (didn't have) and added 1T Garam Masala per other reviews. Thought it had great heat and great flavor. Will definitely make again - and even try to get my tofu averse BF to eat!

I've made this three times. I don't have a food processor, so I just use an immersion blender after adding the spinach. It's a delicious dish!

Maybe I put too much spinach in, or maybe I just don't care for paneer, but I found myself agreeing with those reviewers who found this dish bland. How could it be, with onion, chiles, cumin, and cayenne? Yet, it was. My husband did say that the flavors were sharper before adding the yogurt. I might try it again, without the yogurt. Or maybe not.

As written, this dish was good to eat but it didn't taste like saag paneer IMHO. I didn't have Garam Masala so maybe that's the secret ingredient. It was not bland at all but was missing some depth...a solid spinach dish but not what I was expecting.

This is delicious!! So flavorful and perfect over rice. I made it as described minus the chiles (plus some red pepper), and next time I will probably add more spinach and decrease the half and half (the flavor really comes from the ginger/garlic/onion mix and the spices). No garam masala as I didn't have any. Still, I love it! Yum.

We enjoyed this so much tonight! Just used jalapenos from the can, added the garam masala...Needs only Naan and you're set for dinner! This will be a repeat performance around here. Yum.

We loved this recipe! It took about an hour to prepare and, as per others' suggestions, we added 1 T of Garam Masala. Absolutely delicious (and very spicy)!

Whipped this up before some last minute dinner guests arrived. We, who eat Indian food frequently, loved it and thought it very closely resembled the "real thing." As others who had reviewed suggested, I added some Garam Masala. I doubled the recipe for 4 people and had a bit of leftovers.

Really good with a few changes. All I did was add a tablespoon of garam masala with the other spices and also a handful of fresh cilantro in with the spinach when I pureed it. I also omitted the serrano chile and just stuck to the jalepeno and the cayenne pepper for the heat (it was spicy enough with those). It tastes a little healthier and fresher than the saag paneer you'll get at restaurants. Maybe next time I'd try using greek yogurt instead of regular..the thickness was lacking a little. I'll definitely make it again.

For a vegetarian tofu recipe this was pretty good. I added more yogurt than the recipe suggested to thin it a little as it was very very thick. If you leave the seeds from the jalapeno it will be spicier. I only left the serrano seeds and it wasn't as spicy as I had hoped.

This did not taste good. The tofu was bland and the spinach mixture was spicy but lacked flavor.

My wife and I eat Indian frequently so we have a basis of comparison & we both thought this came out very good. I ate one serving and she polished off all the rest the next day on her own. Didn't find this bland at all. I used 1 pk frozen spinach because that was what i had on hand, sauteed on low heat just enough to thaw so i could cut it up. The flavor was strong but not overpowering so if you're worried about blandness that's a good amount, though I omitted the tofu which would probably soak up some of the seasoning. If i changed anything I might use a bit less ginger, masked some of the other flavors a bit.

I tried this over pasta instead of rice and it was fantastic. I don't know how anyone could call it bland if you used all the indicated spices. Taste salt and peppers as necessary, but otherwise really a wonderful simple meal.

i agree with a cook from NYC. this recipe was very bland. needs more spices and maybe potatoes or something!

Bland bland bland. There are plenty of other good paneer recipes that are far tastier than this and actually easier to prepare. I think the others who rated this may not have had good indian food - this is not it.

A bit bland, though I think it has potential to be good. I will have to experiment with the spices, and add more salt next time.

The sauce is amazing - surprisingly easy to prepare and fresh beats store (or even resturant) prep by a mile. This is something I will make often.

Unexpectedly good. I used cream and skipped one chile as well and it worked out very well.

This is a simple and yummy dish. I added a small amt of heavy cream and a small container of full cream yogurt. The result was a hit.

This is an excellent dish. My BF said it was the tastiest thing I've ever made, and he's not a big fan of tofu. I made this with red onion, skipped the serrano chili (it was still plenty spicy), and used whole fat yogurt and 2 tablespoons of table cream instead of the half & half. A few tips: Make 2x the recipe if cooking for more than two, or make the regular recipe as a side dish (it would be great with channa masala and Naan!). Also, use MEDIUM or SEMI-FIRM Tofu. The spinach itself is very soft, so with soft tofu the dish has a boring texture, and with firm tofu it's not right either. Medium tofu is closer to the texture of paneer, the indian cheese it is simulating. Also, you should have about 2 cups of cooked spinach. Anyway, I will be making this on a weekly basis. Great stuff!
