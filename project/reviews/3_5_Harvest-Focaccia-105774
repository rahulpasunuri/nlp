This was fantastic- I made it to accompany a risotto, and my guests loved it. I brought it to work the next day and got rave reviews. I don't own a food processor, so I did it all by hand- still turned out fine. Be prepared for the dough to seem a little sticky and runny- it still bakes up beautifully.

We love peasant bread and this one did not disapoint us.The combinaison of thym and rosemary with the roasted red grapes is great.I have made it a few times and now omit the sugar,lemon peel and walnuts but add more olive oil and a nice sprinkling of coarse salt when I shape the dough.I prefer to divide it into 3 breads.The biga gives a great flavor and the long beating a wonderful texture.

I made this for New Year's Eve and we munched on it all the next day. Even though there are a few separate steps involved, it's very easy to make, festive-looking and delicious.
