I love this recipe. I've made the real thing many times and i've converted to this quick recipe as my go-to. It is easy to over process using a food processor. I find popping it into the freezer for ten minutes or fridge for 20 minutes between turns is very helpful if you have the time. I also use the rolling pin like a hammer to flatten it out when it is too cold to roll. It must be baked when very cold for optimal flakiness.

Water content (of the butter) has nothing to do with the success of making puff pastry. I do it all the time. The key is practice. In fact, I would say that the water in american butter probably makes it easier to soften cold butter to the proper consistency. Buy "baking with Julia" and try to make the real stuff. This is a recipe for pie crust.

This is a really good recipe for making pseudo-puff pastry, which comes out better than most of the stuff availble in the frozen food section. I have not had great luck making true puff pastry here in the US because of the butter - the water content is too high. In France, there is "dry" butter available for this purpose. It works much better. Use Plugra European style butter for this recipe if you can find it. And DON'T knead.

I long ago gave up on ever being able to make puff pastry. However, it was truly my lucky day when I came upon this recipe - so easy and so much lighter and flakier than the frozen variety. I make half the recipe at a time and freeze what I don't use. Incidentally, a little kneading doesn't hurt. I highly recommend this recipe. Try it.
