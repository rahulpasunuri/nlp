No ratings? Maybe others knew something I didn't. I thought it sounded like an interesting recipe. Actually the scallops were good and very spicy but the combo with the cucumber just didn't work. I served this to guests as an appetizer and we all felt the same. We ate them all so it wasn't a loss just experience. That's why we like to cook, right?
