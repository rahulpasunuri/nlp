i loved this! i added a carrot and celery stalk, doubled the cumin and thyme and added a bit of cayenne. the honey is a nice touch. i think the key is to let it simmer awhile to develop the flavours.

My boyfriend and I are committing to lessen our meat intake. This was one of our first vegan meals made at home, the only substitution was vegetable broth in leiu of chicken broth. While it was cooking, my kitchen smelled so homey and warm...and it was delicious. The parsley at the end really brought it together. It was filling and nutritious. This will be a new favorite in our home.

This was a great stew; the only thing I added was grilled chicken strips plus the drippings. While it would make a good base for adding whatever veggies, herbs, or spices you have on hand, I appreciated the elegance of its simplicity. I think increasing the lemon juice is off base... it is meant to brighten the other flavors, not assert its own.

Made this for my BF for dinner and it went very well. Served with rice and mango chutney, was very filling but delicious! Making again tonight for my Healthy Lifestyles group meeting (my mom and sis). Would definitely make again and again!

This is a great recipe. Fast and family friendly. I double the garlic, cumin, thyme and lemon and add rasins to the couscous. Yummy!

I made this for friends tonight, and served it with a box of lemon couscous. Everyone at the table scraped their plates. It's a great vegetarian dish,and I also think non -vegetarians will enjoy it , as it is quite filling. I added extra red-pepper flakes to give it more flavor. This is a really easy recipe to prepare in front of your guests, chopping, boiling, and letting the stew sit, takes about 35 minutes. Healthy and filling.

This dish was delicious and very easy as well as being healthy and economical. I second the recommendation to increase the cumin (I can never get enough cumin; I buy it by the half-pound and grind it fresh) and add red pepper and carrots, and some garam masala wouldn't go amiss either. I also increased the lemon juice, and will definitely add carrots next time.

I doubled the cumin and thyme, added red pepper flakes for a little spice, and added potatoes when sauteeing the onions. I didn't have lemon juice or parsley but thought this dish was a perfect weekday supper. Fast, easy and healthy! I'll definitely make this again.

Served over rice for a nice weeknight meal. Even my 2 yr old ate it. Added additional cumin as suggested - I think some Garam Masala (a spice used in Indian cooking) would be the perfect addition to this for an added kick.

As recommended by another reviewer I doubled the cumin and thyme and added carrots. The results were still very bland. I debated adding chilli and am sorry I didn't.

I have eaten chickpeas at least twice a week for most of my life and I recon I am an expert on the subject, but this one produced the best meal of chickpeas I have ever eaten

Based on other reviews I added more spices: doubled the cumin and thyme and added cinnamon, ground corriander, chili powder, and dashes of nutmeg and allspice. I also served it over quinoa which was a nice contrast and something completely different.

I only used one can of garbanzo beans and added some cooked chicken chunks. It was super easy to make.

Sorry Charlie. My high expectations of this recipe were not met. Not sure what it needs--more spice?? But would not make it again. Disappointing considering reviewer comments.

This was delicious! When it was cooking, I thought that it would be too watery, but as it turns out, the rice soaked up everything and tasted fabulous. I grated in a couple of carrots and I can't imagine this without them.

chickpea stew sounds delicious and the reviews seem positive for this recipe, but when i viewed the photo... it's a photo of a chocolate cake???

This was very simple and very tasty. I added carrots because I had them in the fridge, and it was a great addition. You could add a variety of vegetables if you wanted

So quick, hearty, and tasty. What a fortunate combination of flavors. We avoid meat, so used vegetable broth instead of chicken. Made with our whole foods, raw honey, etc., the stew was robust and very satisfying. We've made it twice already. It's excellent with brown rice.
