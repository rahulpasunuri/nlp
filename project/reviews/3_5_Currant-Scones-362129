I'm giving these two forks because they were "good", but not exceptional (which would really have to blow my socks off). These were easy to make and had good flavor. I had to use a bit of whole wheat flour since I ran out of all-purpose, so they were a little dry and not as fluffy; I'd make them again with all purpose and see if that improves them.

Dough was far too wet. I used a drop-biscuit method instead of messing with adding more flour, but they were still too wet and spread out like big soft cookies. The search for the perfect scone recipe continues.

I was searching for a recipe to mimic the delicious scones I recently had at Victoria B.C.'s Empress Hotel tea - and these hit the mark! Not very sweet, so perfect to be accompanied by jam and clotted cream.
