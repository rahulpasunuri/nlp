A basic pate a choux, i make this once a week for me and my daughter.Boil one cup of water and add the butter also. drop in one cup of flour. Cook till pulls from side of sauce pan. Beat in each egg(with yokes) separetly. I add a pinch of nutmeg fresh grated, cracked black pepper, pinch of sugar and cayanne. Add the yokes also for richer flavor, this will compliment the parmesan nicely. And bake @ 425 for 20mins. I know! Why not just make a different recipe! LOL

These are easy and realtively fun to make and serve, though they were a bit bland and I used good Parmesean.

These were quick, easy and delicious! I used pre-grated cheese, give them a quick whirl in the food processor and they turned out just fine. Also, used a Dijon Honey Mustard Dressing to dip them in.
