I hate to state the obvious, but what in the world would you expect from bread soaked in tomatoes? That's what you get when you ask Brits what's good to eat.

My husband and I really liked the taste of this dish, but had a lot of leftovers (it is really rich, so we couldn't eat a lot of it at one sitting). A couple of days later, we sliced the pudding and pan fried it in a little olive oil -- YUM! It makes the outside cripsy while the inside stays nice and soft. For an added touch, we topped the slices with some Italian cheeses -- DOUBLE YUM!

I would have to insist that this recipe is less than so-so 7 a waste of ingredients and effort. I made it very carefully for company and when I turned it out of the dish it slumped into a red blob. Even worse,it seemed to have turned the bread into a gluey mass which may have something to say about what Pepperidge Farm bread has become.

I simplified this recipe somewhat: I used the entire tomato, and didn't bother removing the crusts. The second time I made it, I added a chopped medium-hot pepper to the tomatoes and chopped fresh basil and cilantro inbetween the bread layers.

I'm a big fan of English summer puddings made with bread and berries, so this recipe was a must-try for me, despite all the negative comments. I used vine-ripened tomateos from the garden and an excellent artisanal bread from a local bakery. The result was delicious (and it wasn't time-consuming, either).

I read this recipe, but did not attempt it. I think that you get some great bread+ tomato tastes with recipes like authentic gazpacho and panzanella (Italian salad with tomatoes, old bread and vinegar). Sounds like a lot of time for very questionable results.

My mom made this alot in the summer when I was a kid. We were dirt poor, so it was cheap to prepare being raised on a farm. It was gross then, and still is today.

um-- is there a review from anyone who's actually made this dish? I'm not interested in whether you want to make it, only how it was when you did make it. Anyone? Anyone?

I loved reading reviews that reflected my thoughts exactly. I always make my own bread and I love tomatoes but I do not think I would subject myself, family or guests to this recipe.A total waste of tasty tomatoes and good bread...and some good ingredients!!! Sorry!!!

Is there ANYONE out there that would like this dish?! Way too much work for tomatoes on bread. What's the point. Unless you have unwanted company coming for dinner....

This recipe needs at least some fresh basil--maybe a good balsamic drizzle To me I prefer fresh tomatoes, boccini, sweet onion, fresh basil, good olive oil and a good balsamic and good Italian bread to dip--definately tastes and looks better

I haven't made it, but it sure seems like a lot of fuss, mess and bother for what is essentially bread dipped in tomatoes. Looks like some cookbook author needed to fill out a recipe section.

Thanks for the warning. I'll use my heirlooms in a dish where their freshness and flavor can be appreciated.

I was really disappointed with the way that this tomato pud tasted. I was expecting something a bit more fresh tasting, on the order of a chilled tomato soup, but instead, I ended up with what tasted like cold canned tomato soup and soggy bread, and I followed the directions exactly. It was also very tasteless! It could have definitely used some herbs or something in the recipe. Definitely will not make this again!
