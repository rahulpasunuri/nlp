I've made this fondue several times. It is delicious! I have made it as written, without shallots and bacon, or without one or the other - it's always excellent. In fact, I wish I had some now!

It was a HUGE hit at the party, everyone loved the spicy, but not deadly chipotle taste. We dipped breads and veggies in it, and it was excellent.

This was excellent - none leftover. I used about one and a half Tbsp. of the chipotle chiles and no scallions or bacon. The key to keeping it a good consistency is to stir it occasionally, even when it's being served.

This is a great recipe-- I made it for a fondue party where there were 3 other cheese fondues and this is the one that got devoured. The fried shallots really make the dish.

This was awesome! A big hit at the party. I was worried that the chipoltes would not go with the swiss tasting cheese, but it tasted wonderful. I will definitely make this again - but probably make it more spicy.

This is a great recipe. Follow it to the letter and you will not be disappointed. I have not made it ahead of time to reheat, but I'm sure it won't be too bad. Definately double it for a party. I'm making it for the 2nd year in a row. Always a hit!

I made this on Christmas Eve, and everyone loved it. I wasnt sure about mixing Gruyere and Chipotle, and next time I think i'll try it with Camembert or some other cheese more suitable to Mexican because it did taste like, well, Gruyere mixed with Chipotle. It's still good though, dont get me wrong.

This is a great twist to classic fondue. The chipotle chilis give it a nice, smoky flavor. We've made this 2 New Year's parties in a row, and it's always been a hit.

This was my first cheese fondue. I don't think that I will ever make one again! I followed the recipe to the letter, and this was awful. Despite all the cheese, chipotles, bacon, shallots, etc. in this recipe, I (and everyone at my party) found this to be particularly bland. I used all of the best quality ingredients available and, $30 later, ended up with a disgusting, STINKY, slop. Gross!

I thought this was an excellent dish. I served this at an anniversity party with drinks and everyone raved about it. I agree with other readers DOUBLE it if you have a large group. I'm getting ready to go to the store and make it again. It's going to go great on this rainy cold October evening. Cheers!

Made this for a fondue party of 22. What a hit. Not a drop left. I omitted the kirsch but will try it next time.

I used everything except for the nutmeg, and it tasted great but smelled horrible. My hostess' house smelled of foul socks and everyone complained (in a good natured way) of how foul my fondue was. Once you got past the smell, it was good. The chipotle peppers added an interesting zing to it. A few people didn't care for it, so I guess it was a "love it or hate it" kind of thing.

My only mistake with this recipe is that I didn't double it!!! Our fondue party consumed all of it -- no crust at the bottom of the pot that night! The fried shallots make this dish.

This is the best fondue I (and my firends) have ever had. I would only use 1 can of chipotles though. More than that and the spice overwhelms the flavor. (and I lOVE spicy things) Its fabulous. YUM YUM YUM

This was easy to make and was very very tasty! I used Jarlsburg and Gruyere cheese, and the full 3 chipotles (as called for in the recipe). I also omitted the kirsch and nutmeg. Good snacking!

Fantastic! Wish we had made more of the this and less other types of fondue. The chilies wer hard to find until I went to local Spanish market. Enjoy.

YUCK!! I brought this to a Christmas party and no one liked it. They ate a few bites to be polite, but that's it. I was very disappointed. It had a very strong and overpowering taste. Sorry.

This was great. I couldn't find Emmanthal and substituted Jarlsburg and it was just fine. I also cut down on the amount of chilies, to just one tablespoon and it was PLENTY spicy.

This recipe is excellent! I don't recommend using too many chipotles as the taste may overpower the fondue. I have already made this recipe a few times and will do so again in the future.

This was the first time we were making fondue, and were looking for a tasty, easy recipe. This one was fun to prepare, and good to eat (second time will be better, we hope). :-)
