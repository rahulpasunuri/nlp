Too many onions. Reduce by half. Reduce green pepper as well.

I have made this salsa so many times and EVERYONE loves it and asks for the recipe. They key is to chop ingredients really fine - fine enough to top a chip with. :)

I used the small, red Thai peppers instead of jalapeno peppers and used 4 different colors of bell peppers. All ingredients were friesh from the farmers market and my garden....
