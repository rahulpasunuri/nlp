I bought Westphalian pumpernickel which is not leavened. The pumpernickel overwhelmed the salmon and was not pleasant. So I made it again as an open faced sandwich using one slice of bread and it was transformed. I toasted and buttered the bread. I layered the red onion and avocado, piled it high with salmon and topped it with a generous amount of lemon juice, capers and cracked pepper. I looks fancier and the flavors are more balanced. It was delicious.

This is an easy, light, and elegant sandwich. With the grocery store strike we did have to sub some. Used rye bread, no sprouts, and had to sub lime for lemons, otherwise exactly as written. On a smaller scale these would be wonderful appetizers as well. Simply delicious.

Absolutely delicious! When my husband and I go to New York City, we always visit Zabars and bring some of their Nova Smoked Salmon home with us - it worked out very well in this recipe!

I agree with the cook from New York.

This was delicious! Two salmon-haters abstained, leaving more for me. The tartness of the lemon, richness of the smoked-salmon, sourness of the capers and butteriness of the avocado were in perfect balance.

Served for informal Rose Bowl New Year's day Party. It was a hit.
