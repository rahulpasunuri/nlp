Nothing this easy should be this good! Next time I think I'll start with a little less water - I did fish out the plums and reduce the liquid and it was yummy but there was a lot to reduce, maybe try 3/4 cup. Didn't have the whipped cream cheese either but 3oz of regular cream cheese brought to room temp and whipped with my mixer before I added the whipped cream worked just fine.

GREAT RECIPE! VERY EASY TO MAKE AND FAST! THIS WOULD BE GREAT FOR A DINNER PARTY JUST GRANISH. THE ONLY BAD THING WAS THERE WASNT ENOUGH IN ONE RECIPE.

This had an excellent cheesecake flavour and the perfect texture. Next time, I would reduce the syrup after poaching the plums as it was a little thin.

Wonderfully easy and delicious. I used brandy instead of the rum...very good. Since I wanted to cut fat, used fat-free cool whip and cut back on the sugar in the cream cheese mixture. Served them in chocolate cups instead of goblets. Made for a wonderful presentation. Will definately make again!

Made this on 10 Sept., the night before the horrific terrorist attacks on our country. It was simple to make, and my friends and I thought it was delicious (doubles easily). It feels almost insensitive to be giving this review right now, but please give this a try when you can... KIMBER
