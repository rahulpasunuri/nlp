Tasty and easy - I made just one serving as in the recipe, but it makes easily enough for two. I also replaced the cream with half and half, to no obvious ill effect.

A favorite with any group I make this for. Have done for intimate late-night dessert suppers as well as huge family gatherings and house warmings and it is always a HUGE hit. Yumsky!

this bread pudding was great! the little spice gives it something extra and totally fits it. plus, after it's cooked it mellows out a bit so it's the same great bread pudding with a little something extra

Good, not great. When increasing the quantity, go easy on the cayenne.

This is an amazingly good recipe. It is imperative, however, to use good quality chili's. I use a home-made blend derived from my garden. I tried it with just straight cayenne, as the recipes suggests, but I found that was bitter. It makes enough for two, also.

This is a verrrrry rich dessert -- we tasted it with and without vanilla ice cream, and a la mode really is the way to go (it offsets some of that richness). Made a larger quantity and that worked well. Excellent flavor!

Why on earth would someone who is calorie counting try this one? Anyway, for contrast, I get a total of 817 calories (sans ice cream) for the whole recipe based on fitday calculator. The recipe can serve two - 400 calories is not too bad for a rich dessert.

I have made this on three occassions now and all three times have been well received. I find it makes large quanties well and I use extra large muffin tins and they turn out well. I did add a pinch more pepper but not too much. In addition, I added a Gran Mariner sauce as a topper which was a touch more elegant but not required for those who didn't want the extra flavor or sweeetness.

This was a good and easy dessert. It's rich enough that I might make miniature servings next time.

A word of caution...serving for 1 = 1260 calories!!

This recipe was pretty good, especially for a quick, informal desert. I made 1 recipe in two 3/4cup ramekins - fine to serve 2. Would be best to let bread stand longer with the chocolate mixture, as mine wasn't completely soaked through after baking. I used 1% milk and a touch of sour cream and extra butter, since I was out of heavy cream. Turned out fine and satisfied that chocolate craving...

This is quite a simple and tasty dessert. I doubled the recipe, baked it in a small souffle dish and topped each serving with some freshly whipped cream. Like many others, I won't bother to double it next time - one serving would easily feed two.

i thought this was going to be absolutely delicious when i read the recipe, but i wasn't impressed. it wasn't by any means bad, it just wasn't great.

This dish is delicious. We made it for dessert at a football party and everyone raved about it. We preferred slightly more pepper in our mix.

My husband made this for me on Valentines Day and it was wonderful. We made it again the other night. Next time I have a Latin-inspired dinner party, this will be the dessert because it is easy and fabulous.

I also expected to love it, and it was good, but not "to die for." I do like the chocolate-chile combo, the cayenne was very subtle. I put whipped cream on top, but I think ice cream would have been better.

Very easy and delicious. Every one loved it.

I really liked the chocolate/chile combination- but like some of the others, I did find that the recipe made enough for two. But it was very easy and perfct on a cold night with some red wine. I would make it again- maybe with a little more chile, even?

I doubled the recipe and made it in two 8-oz ramekins. I liked it, but, having read the reviews, I was expecting to love it. My boyfriend liked it, but we agreed that it wasn't spectacular. Admittedly, I use the chocolate-chile combination a lot in our desserts at home, and so maybe it was not as new and exciting for us as it seems to have been for other reviewers. I'd probably try it again on another cold winter's night, with -- unbelievably -- a little less chocolate in the mix.

Huge hit! Very rich, and loved the hint of spicy-ness. Served with dab of creme fraiche and handful of strawberries on side. I increased recipe by half and served in 2 6oz. ramekins.

If you enjoy chocolate, this is a great recipe. However, it is too large for one serving and next time I would use 1/2 cup dishes or make a larger recipe in a single pan. I also used a hot water bath for best results. As for the comments regarding giving instructions for multiple servings, do we actually have people who can't multiply by 2, 3 or 4?

I feel like this is THE recipe I have been searching for. What a treat on a cold evening. Most certainly rich and delicious. Serves two easily. But on a day of indulgence--serves ONE even better. We need more single-portion recipes like this one!

I doubled the recipe and found that a single serving would have satisfied both of us. Also, when I make it again, I will add more sugar and a little less cayenne. I liked the spice, but it was too much!

Very good & quite easy to make. One serving easily serves two people. A dab of vanilla ice cream is a must, to balance the rich chocolate flavor.

A single girl's heaven! It's a great twist on a classic recipe, and I'm happy to see recipes designed for a single portion. The combination of choclate and chile is delightful!

Ditto. Please multiply this by 4 if you wish to be of service on the Internet.

YUM! An individual portion dessert is perfect for some people. Very easy to make, very rich in flavor. I loved the cayenne kick. I will no doubt make this again.

This is a dream come true!I am always on the hunt for single serving desserts. Very simple to make. Very rich. I substituted reduced soy milk for the cream with good results.

All this work for ONE serving??? Sounds good, but wouldn't try it just for one. How about instructions on multiplying portions.
