Second time I have made these and they came out fabulous! Great presentation. Time consuming, yes, but so what, well worth it.

This was my second time making the spiral rolls and they were, again, delicious! I did take the time to roll each piece out. I think that using the cinnamon roll method will result in a less "puffy" and rounded spiral because you are "cutting" the tops. Cinnamon rolls are usually flat on the top. These spiral rolls have a beautiful puffy, rounded, spiral top. Yes, it's time consuming, but I didn't care. These rolls are worth the effort!

The rolls were delicous! I too felt it would be too time consuming to measure each piece, and although I did separate the dough, I was not very particular about size or shape when preparing to roll them up. They all turned out wonderful, and I think next time I will use the cinnamon roll style suggestion with butter and chives.

Time-consuming, but well worth it. Very pretty appearance and wonderfully light and flavorful.

A very good dinner roll recipe. I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix and knead. Did anybody roll out 12 pieces of dough individually? I'm such a perfectionist when it comes to cooking, I would have spent all day rolling and measuring! Instead I rolled the dough into a rectangle, spread the dough with softened butter and chives, rolled up like cinnamon roll dough and cut the 12 slices. The rolls tasted great!

Very good! Besides making pizza dough, this was the first homemade dough I'd ever made. I was wary at first when I began the kneading as the dough was quite sticky, but the recipe specifically indicates that no flour be used on the work surface. Sure enough, after about 10 minutes, the stickiness disappeared and the dough was as promised: smooth and elastic. Another excellent recipe from Gourmet!
