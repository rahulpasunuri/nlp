Love this easy recipe. I used herbs de Provence instead of lavendar, and one less tablespoon of honey (omitted it from last honey step). My duck was about 4.8 pounds, so I cooked it for 1 hour 40 min, then 16 min for higher temp. It was perfectly cooked. I do not know why they say to cut off any neck fat; it is DELICIOUS - the skin and fat is one of the best parts of duck! Surprisingly, I don't find the liver to be very good, not sure why, but I've made this twice, and it isn't very good. The boiling of the juices took about 15 min (not 5).

This is a fantastic recipe and is relatively simple. I make this every year for New Year's eve, served with kale stir fried in duck fat (with pine nuts and garlic) and roasted root vegetables. I would suggest making a broth with the neck, wing tips and giblets (carrot, parsley, etc) for the sauce. If find that the initial two hours roasting time is too long for a 6-pound duck and take the duck out at 155F.

This wasn't bad but don't cook it until it's 180F...way overcooked :-P Other recipes say to cook from 155F to 170F.

yum! I also used Herbs De Province as others suggested as fresh lavender isn't readily available this time of year. the flavors of the herbs and honey are absolutely heavenly on the duck! I also stuffed the inside of the duck with wedges of onion and lemon (instead of the liver) and trussed it up to close in the flavors. the result was a really succulent and flavorful duck with a semi-cripy and delicious skin! I will certainly be making this again soon!

Wow was this good! I didn't have lavender honey, though I did have dried lavender, so crushed it a bit and added about a tsp. to the honey, and let it sit at room temperature. I followed the recipe and had trouble putting away the leftovers, which I just wanted to keep picking at! I look forward to tomorrow and noshing more! The crushed duck liver on (homemade) bread was a great addition, though after mashing, I added some of the pan broth, and a dash of brandy... YUMMM!

So very good! Used herbs de provence as I had no lavender, and it was just perfect. Mine was a small duck and I shortened every baking time a little bit. I also trussed the duck to keep the inside moist. Very god result/effort ratio in this recipe!

First time making duck, tasted amazing and was not difficult. Followed other reviewers suggestions by reducing cooking time for 4lb duck, and substituting herbes de provence for lavender. Served 2 with enough leftovers for stock and duck risotto.

This duck was superior to anything I have ever had in my life! My MIL who said she doesn't eat duck, actually ate it and wished for more. I made a 6 1/2 pound duck for four and there was just enough, however, it was so fabulous that everyone wished there was more. Next time I roast two ducks!

I made this recipe for Christmas and it was delectable! Great dish for two! I did dbl. the lavender and used orange blossom honey for a contrast in taste. Served with crispy red skin potatos and mixed string beans. I would recommend this recipe to anyone who loves duck, and make sure you use a thermometer!! It will tell you when it's done, the color of the skin when it's done it somewhat dark. Enjoy!

This was an excellent recipe! My husband raved about the duck from his second bite. I did not find the recipe instructions to be difficult or putsy, as some reviewers did. I did, however, make some changes due to unavailable ingrediants though. I took other reviewers suggestions and used 1 Tbsp dried Herbs de Provence instead of lavender, and I added 1 tbsp Grand Marnier to the honey, since all I had was regular honey. Since my duck was only 4lb, I baked the duck at 375F for 1 hour 5 minutes, then lowered the temp to 350F and baked for 20minutes. Glazed with the honey mixture and then returned it to the oven for 10minutes more. It turned out perfect and so flavorful. This is a wonderful recipe that will be in my keeper file. Thanks to the other reviewers for the helpful suggestions.

Wow! This was great with herbs de provence. I can't wait to try it with lavender blossoms from the garden. I am a duck lover and I must agree with the reviews that this is one of the best ducks I have ever had. Even with a frozen supermarket duck. No more duck l'orange for me.

My husband calls this "velvet duck" and I grow lavendar just for this recipe. We now cook it on our Weber rotisserie, using a little grapevine or applewood for flavor on the coals. Fab! You don't smoke up the house, or spatter fat all over the oven. I end up making my own sauce using the pan drippings from the drip pan, stock made from the neck,etc. Works great.

Wonderful dish. I made this in France with Provence honey and fresh thyme from the hills we hiked in. I used duck breast, though, and overcooked it a bit. I will definitely try this again because the flavours were so good together.

We save this recipe for special occasions (Christmas and dinning with friends) we had friends over for dinner so I begged my hubby to make this recipe. We have had it at least 3 other times and it NEVER disappoints. The only things we do differently - every 30-45 mins we baste and at the end we add more honey... this is the BEST duck I have ever tasted and I have eaten $100.00 gourmet duck (at a restaurant) - this is way better. If your cooking for 4 would suggest making another duck, your company will want more! 4 forks here!!!

Wow! This was delicious and fairly simple. I, too, used herbs de Provence. I also used buckwheat honey because that is what I already had. My boyfriend said it was the best duck he ever tasted and I agree. It will now be my default duck recipe.

This duck is reminiscent of the famed dish at Lucas Carton in Paris. It is fabulous! It could be the best dish I've ever made. However, I did reduce the cooking time since the duck was only 4.5 lbs-- see Julia Child's cookbook for a guide. I used lavender salt from the farmer's market in SF (see www.lavenderfarm.com). Also used a stock made from the duck neck rather than chicken broth. This is truly an outstanding dish. Loved the 12 step program comment!

My first duck! My duck cooked much, much faster than the recipe indicated - after 90 minutes it was almost falling apart. My parner suggested it might be because I use a cast iron roasting pan and that increases the speed of cooking. Either way, I didn't get a chance to baste it with honey for the final glaze. Still, it was delicious - and might be four forks worthy if I can get the timing down. I made a stock of the bones, rendered the fat, and made a gravy from the giblets, drippings, stock, fat, and a splash of wine. It was very, very rich and strong gravy. I love gravy, so I used plenty of it. It might be too strong for common folks.

Truly delicious. I used Herbes de Provence and a little extra honey. Got endless raves from my guests.

Delicious. My 3 year olds even loved the "patay". They fought over it. I also used herbs de provencale, and used homemade rose wine and some local (dark) honey. The basting sauce/gravy didn't turn out well, maybe the honey was too dark. The honey was a black goo at the bottom, with an almost clear liquid on top, even though I whisked it. Next time I'll use thinner honey, and less of it. I used a convection oven but it still took the recommended time. I served it with roasted new potatoes and an endive salad with a mustard dressing, a la the "French K.I.S.S." website.

I would like to make this recipe using only duck breasts. How long should I roast the breasts? Thanks!

This recipe is a bit of a "process" to make but when in the mood with the time, no problem. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception that I used the duck's neck to make broth while the duck cooked, so did not use commercial chicken broth. I loved the skin, which carried the herb flavors well. The duck was, well...just duck. As for lavender (earlier reviewers wondered where to get it) I suggest you web-search on "Sequim Lavender Farms" because this Washington town is becoming the USA's "Provence" and amongst the listings you'll find shops that offer culinary lavender. (NB-Lavender varieties differ; some are better than others for culinary use.)Enjoy!

really good - some of the guys I made this for just couldn't stop picking at the bones. For a 4 1/2 - 5lb duck, you can cut the time - instead of 2h in the beginning I did 40min on one side and 30min on the other. Then the 20min as in the recipe. Didn't have lavender, but still turned out great.

Made this for Thanksgiving, and boy were we thankful. The aroma alone is enough to drive you mad, and the taste is absolutely decadent. Like many others did not have lavender so substituted herbes de provence; I used the honey baste twice as called for since my family loves honey, and was glad I did. I've been begged to make this again (and again!) and it was so good I've actually ordered lavender so I'll have it on hand when I do.

Rating: 4
Excellent. I did not have a few of the ingredients on hand (used herb de provence in place of lavender, clover honey instead of lavender honey) and Marsala wine. Came out scrumptious. Will make this again with exact ingredients to compare the difference. I agree with other comments about basting with honey only once rather than twice. Came out a little sweeter than I prefer, but still incredibly delicious.

I don't have a lot of experience with duck, and approached it with some caution. I had received warnings about how fatty it is, etc. Like others, I couldn't find lavander (it IS March in Michigan) but was able to find herbs de provence and lavander flavored honey. These worked quite well. I brined a 5lb duck overnight prior. Roasted it on a rack with a halved Granny Smith Apple in the cavity. Other than that, I followed the instructions closely. The duck came out fabulous, and will be included in our Easter menu. I usually don't like pate, but it really good. This is the kind of recipe that is so unique and delicious, you have to run a sample of it next door to the neighbor to share it. I can't wait to make this for guests!

I just made this last night.......wonderful!!! First time I ever cooked a duck before but it was an easy to follow recipe. Like other reviewers, I only had a 4 lb. young duck and could only get herbs de provence...no lavendar. An hour on 350 and a half hour on 375 was perfect for the size I had. I only brushed once with honey. Served with roasted new potatos and steamed green beans. Other half said it was the best duck he has had, better than barbequed. Will be made often.

I've had duck a couple of times and I didn't like it - I knew it had to be the way it was prepared - so I thought I'd give this a shot - was outstanding....I like Elliots comment - he's in the 12 steps program after having this. It's a great recipe.

I used young duckling 5 1/2 lbs. my boyfriend and two of our guests ate everything, i thought they'll eat the bones too. delicious aroma comming from lavender made ME hungry for it. it's easy too! will make it again soon!!!

All I can say is OH MY GAWD! I made this recipe last night and my husband and I couldn't believe how great it was. We both love to cook and have cooked duck many different ways but this is our new absolute FAVORITE.

What a beautiful, beautiful way to prepare duck...aromatic roasting aroma, attractive presentation, complex flavors.

I have made this recipe twice now - once with a whole duck and once with just the breasts. Both times were magnificent. On the second attempt, I used tawny port instead of the red wine, more lavender and brushed the breasts only once with honey. It is a pretty dish, smells wonderful and tastes out of this world. Even the kids loved it...as long as you don't tell them what that stuff spread on the baguette is!

Saw this recipe when it first came out and this Basitle Day I wanted to make it but I didn't know where to get lavendar -My significant other pointed to the purple flowers in her garden! It was the best duck recipe I've ever made-I used stock made from the gizzards-The gravy was great !!

July, my lavender is in full bloom, inspired I tried this duck. I did not skimp on the lavender, and beefed up the fresh lavender with dry. I used regular honey. This is what you alway's hoped duck would taste like!! Simply wonderful. Instead of chicken broth I made duck stock with the gibblets,wing tips, onion and italian parsley. I then made a side dish wild rice, basmatti and a cup of the duck stock in the rice water and then added shredded the duck necks and giblets into the rice.

Wonderful! Before preparing this duck recipe I was concerned about cooking with lavendar as it was previously not in my repertoire. I will use a little more lavendar next time or the lavendar honey. I used basic honey as rural east Texas doesn't stock the exotics. I used the necks & giblets from 2 ducks, for a stock which I added to the chicken stock. I also added about 1 Tbs of Grand Marnier to the sauce since the honey I was using was the basic. The ducks were visually dramatic and extremely aromatic when removed from the oven. I cooked the ducks the recommended time and they could have roasted a little longer. Next time I will believe my meat thermometer and not my eyes. As with other comments this recipe would work well with chicken. This recipe will be prepared again very soon!

If you like duck, this is excellent. Make sure to score the underside (thighs) of the duck. I was also more liberal with the wine and honey and think that helped. It is a fairly labor-intensive recipe.

This was a great hit with our wine tasting group. I was afraid that the duck would be dry after 2+ hours in the over, but it was juicy and wonderful! The lavender was available at both health food stores and the local co-op. Go for the lavender honey if you can find it--it's not cheap, but it's delicious. I usually don't like honey, but this is something differnt and very special.
