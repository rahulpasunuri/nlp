We have been using James Beard's recipes for over 40 years. This tenderloin recipe was a big hit at a recent dinner party.

Delicious. I am not sure I understood the baking instructions, so I just put the whole marinade and steak into the oven. It turns out that 45 minutes was slightly too long for medium rare, but the flavor was still great. I will make this again and again.

Wonderful easy recipe. Just marinate and pop in oven. I make this every Christmas.

This marinade was delish the first nite I served the beef. It did NOT keep well for any leftover meat. It was probably the ginger that turned, but it was really awful the second night and we had to toss the entire piece of remaining beef. Overall, it was easy to make and flavorful, but I do not recommend this recipe if you anticipate leftovers!

Have made this dish for years, being an old-time Beard fan. It is wonderful served at room temp with a sauce of sour cream, dry English mustard & horseradish. Add some large shrimp with cocktail sauce, curried rice salad & good bread or rolls- great buffet!

Pat dry and salt & papper before placing in the oven. It's magnificent. Try dome tarragon garlic butter as an adornment when serving. Buen provecho.
