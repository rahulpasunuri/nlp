Loved it! We used shrimp instead of chicken, and added frozen peas when we added the other vegetables to the pan. We also used a skillet instead of the wok. We used "A Taste of Thai" yellow curry paste which we found at Harris Teeter, and served with brown rice and naan. Great flavor. We loved it and will definitely make it again!

I used this recipe as a base and it turned out awesome!!! My hubby whom doesn't even care for chicken curry devoured it! What I did differently was I didn't use potatoes and served it over jasmine rice instead, I used about a section and 1/4 of the golden curry sauce mix that comes in like a cake form, I added a few sliced sweet peppers used an entire small can of chicken broth 1/2 can of coconut milk added a couple dashes of ground ginger and about 2 tbsp of clover honey and added a bag of sugar snap peas.My 2 year old son devoured it too even though it had a kick from the white pepper. this is going to be a regular thing on the family menu!!!

This is my very first curry and I loved it! One pan makes for easy clean up, and the chicken was incredibly flavorful. I couldn't find a yellow curry paste so I went with Patak's Hot Curry Paste. Keep in mind, even with 3 heaping table spoons, it wasn't very spicy. You may need to add more heat with chili peppers. I love the creamy texture of curry so next time I think I will add the full can of coconut milk. My next step is to make my own curry paste, any suggestions? This dish got rave reviews from the family, they all thought the house smelled like an Indian restaurant! Pair with naan and rice and you've got an incredibly delicious restaurant quality meal at home!

This is incredibly delicious. I made it exactly as the recipe stated, which is not my habit, and it was fabulous. I will cook this again.

This is a 10! OMG I steamed basmati brown rice and the house smell like a Thai restaurant. What a combination.

A suggestion for those finding their curry powder versions lacking in flavor: blend your own curry powder mix or buy a better brand of curry powder. Also, from your curry powder blend, make your own curry paste prior to cooking this dish. Curry powder added to a dish while cooking never fully develops curry flavor.

This dish is fantastic! I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs, more shallots because I had them, and Patak's Garam Masala Curry Paste. Also a little extra chicken broth to soften the potatoes. If it's too hot for them, I may end up adding a little more coconut milk so the kids can eat it too.

This was tasty and easy! Some of the reviews say the result is too bland. I can't disagee more. I think the difference might be that I used curry PASTE. And chose the hot variety. It was almost too spicey...just kidding, that's impossible for my family. Stay away from the curry powder. It does not have enough flavor. I would omit the extra salt next time however. Not needed when you have the chicken broth and the curry paste.

i think one thing to note is that curry powder itself is rather bland.

Quite bland. admittedly, we added more liquid which probably diluted the curry, but still not worth making again...

Made this for a quick weekday dinner. Very delicious. I used a whole can of coconut milk, a BEEF boullion cube for richer flavor and 1 whole onion instead of the shallot. Superb base recipe.

This recipe is a good point to build off of, but alone the flavors are unremarkable. The one wok cooking is very handy. But it's just too bland as is.

I made this recipe for dinner. Although it was good, I found it to be a bit bland. I will definitely add more spices next time.

I made this curry in a hurry...and then ate it in a flurry!!!

I would recommend some more spice in this recipe...some type of hot pepper of some sort. I found that the curry obviously blended well with the coconut, but I was expecting more of a kick...not something that might overpower the curry at all, but a nice tingling in the mouth to accentuate the flavors. I also sub'ed bell peppers, b/c I think that red bell peppers add better color than green (plus...it was all i had in the fridge!).
