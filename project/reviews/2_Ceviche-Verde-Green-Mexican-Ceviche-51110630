A very fresh and light option for dinner that I may have to make again considering I just realized I forgot the olives! But here's my take. Use fresh ahi tuna. Mine were frozen and just didn't look/taste that great. I'd also suggest searing the tuna steaks versus cooking in lime. The sear would put a nice crunch to the fish. Keep the lime juice @ 1/2 cup but I'd mix the oil & lime together and toss all together. The recipe makes alot and is great for hot days, buffet, or just a salsa (without the tuna).
