I was looking for a recipe for mushrooms sauteed with sherry to top mushroom tartlets. I had my doubts about this recipe because of the red pepper flakes and teriyaki sauce, but the other reviews were so good I just had to try it. OMG. THE BEST. I used chopped baby portabellas. The reviewer who said don't forget the parsley was absolutely right. This is a major keeper!! Well worth 4 forks!! (By the way, I recommend Yamasa teriyaki sauce--it has the least amount of junk in it.)

Excellent shrooms! I added shallots at the beginning, and they are fabulous! Great on steaks, but also make the worlds best Swiss Mushroom burgers! Enjoy!

We always make this with steak...but tonight we only had shitake mushrooms and port. I must say, it was still excellent!! We cut down on the amount of butter too. It's a great recipe and very adaptable.

These are amazing on steak and will shortly be going on top of some grilled burgers. Don't hesitate to make them.

I substituted a seeded serrano chili for the red pepper flakes and added minced shallot. A very nice finish. Maybe sweeter than I might like, but was using a store-bought teriyaki, so would try with my own.

Fantastic. I'm sure it would be even better if I'd followed the recipe exactly. As it was, I had to sub margarine for the butter to make it dairy-free. I didn't have teriyaki sauce, so I subbed soy sauce, then added some ground ginger, ground garlic, and a pinch of sugar. Used a dry Merlot instead of sherry. My husband declared he would eat a bowl of the mushrooms alone. Don't omit the parsley - it adds!

Fabulous! This is my go-to recipe when I want mushrooms with steak. Wows guests too! Simple enough. Follow the recipe, it's perfect.

I made these mushrooms to accompany a prime rib that I prepared for Christmas. Doubled the recipe and used white wine, as I didn't have any sherry on hand. I also didn't have unsalted butter so used salted and I think next time I would make sure to use the unsalted. An absolutely delicious side and my family loved them!

These mushrooms are a huge hit with everyone and go beautifully with beef tenderloin! A little fresh thyme is a nice touch.

These are by far some of the best sauteed mushrooms I've ever had, and quite easy to prepare. The sherry and teriyaki make them a bit special and worthy of any good cut of meat (I used beef tenderloin).

I have been making these for years and never make any other recipe for sauteed mushrooms. Wonderful as is!

Rating: 4
This was a huge hit, even outdid the filet mignon because the taste was so flavourful. I used sweet port instead of sherry and used large mushrooms, so that I didn't have to remove them from the skillet and let the sauce thicken. The mushrooms remained firm and dry and I didn't have more dishes to wash.

a favorite mushroom side with filet mignon. made for my bf's mother who is an excellent cook (i have the will, but lots of room for improvement). she raved. he still asks for them. i think the parsely is key but im partial to fresh herbs

This is easy and always a favorite at our house. You don't have to be super precise with the measurements either. We add onions to the recipe in addition to the mushrooms, and it is delicious!

I was pleasantly surprised at how good this was. When I read the ingredients I thought it was an odd combination but the reviews made me try it and I'm glad I did. I will definitely make this again. The only change I made is I only used 1T butter so I didn't need to reduce the sauce. Delicious.

delicious dish, would make again!!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, using Soy Vay Teriyaki Sauce which is rather thick. The mushrooms were gobbled up immediately with lots of "ooohh's" and "aahhh's" - you HAVE to try them to believe it, they're fantastic!!

Yum! Everyone loved this dish. I used porcini mushrooms because I like the flavour better and they were amazing! They look pretty too. It'll become one of my staples.

A real winner - this was so easy to make and it tasted great! I'll be serving this to guests for sure. Did not use the parsley as I didn't have any but it didn't matter because the dish was delicious!

Delicious variation for sauteed mushrooms. Have prepared this several times to accompany various beef entrees. I prefer using crimini mushrooms because they have more of an earthy, organic taste. Used both marsala and sherry interchangably with excellent results. I use Soy Vay teriyaki sauce because it's what I usually have on hand. It contains sesame seeds which goes well with the recipe. Not necessary to remove mushrooms from pan while reducing the sauce. One less bowl to wash. Haven't had the need to season with additional salt since the teriyaki is sufficient.

While these mushrooms tasted fine - they look kinda gross. The teriyaki sauce & red wine turns them into a dark browny red colour. My guests hardly touched them :-(

A big hit, made it along with steak and the favours were fabulous. I left the mushrooms in while the sauce reduced and it was great. Easy and a great compliment with meat! I am planning to make them again for my next dinner party!

this is such an easy recipe to make, and it is always a hit, unless our guests do not like mushrooms. I use Trader Joe's Teryiaki sauce for a little extra spice.

Rating: 3
Simple to do and very good. I served these with grilled boneless ribeyes. We used a 10-oz package of creminis sliced thick (halved the smaller ones). I didn't have teriyaki so I used soy,with a little fresh ginger juice, a bit of demerara sugar, and small extra garlic clove. I cut back on both the soy and sherry because I had a smaller amount of mushrooms. I only used 2 tblsp. butter, and it was perfect. I too was able to let the sauce reduce with the mushrooms in the pan. My husband went nuts over this one.

I made this for a New Years Eve party, and it was a huge hit. I didn't have to remove the mushrooms like the instructions stated, the glaze reduced and thickend perfectly while the mushrooms were cooking. A word of caution though, definately taste this one before seasoning with salt, you could easily over do it.

Outstanding!!! I made this recipe over the holidays with sirloin steaks, and we couldn't get enough of them! I doubled the recipe, and between 4 people, we easily finished them off in one meal!

We had this for dinner with some grilled T-bones. They were delicious and easy to make. We used plain old white mushrooms - large ones and we quartered them. I saw a guest using the sauce on his potatoes! A new favorite!

I wanted to make sauteed mushrooms to go with our dinner last night. I looked at the reviews for the regular sauteed mushrooms and read several reviews that recommended this recipe instead. I am so glad I followed their recommendations. This sauteed mushroom recipe is fantastic.

Sorry, I disagree strongly with the other reviewers. This dish was disgustingly salty and very spicy - the two in my book don't go together. UGH!

Made these for Father's Day. They were very easy to make and had a very intense flavor, almost too strong for me. But my husbane LOVED them. He poured the sauce all over his T-bone steak, poured a glass of Merlot, and said it was an exceptional meal. I used 1/4 t. red pepper and they still had a zing to them. I also used dry white wine (didn't have any Sherry) and it seemed to work out just fine. Make sure your butter is not too hot when you add the garlic because it burns easily.

Rating: 4
This recipe was awesome! Very, very simple to make and absolutely wowed my guests. I made this with grilled filet mignons and grilled asparagus with a roasted red pepper sauce. All the items complimented each other perfectly. One tiny adjustment I made to the recipe however, was to use a teaspoon of mashed garlic instead of minced. I've found that sometimes minced garlic can become easily burned and give dishes like this a nasty flavor whereas the mashed garlic blends smoothly into the sauce and is every bit as delicious.

My son asked for a "fancy meal like you make your friends" for his 18th birthday. I made these with filet mignon, roasted garlic mashed potatoes, steamed string beans, spinach salad with pancetta and pears...he was in heaven. He has requested the same meal ESPECIALLY THE MUSHROOMS for prom night. His friends tell me they dream about these! So, I'll be happy to oblige. These were delicious!

Excellent recipe. I have used several types of mushrooms, but prefer thick sliced portobello's. All our friends want the recipe. I do use a touch more garlic for added flavor.

WOW!! I made 1/2 recipe for my husband & myself. I thought that 1/2 would be plenty for 4 people. NOT!! After I kept tasting them, there was hardly enough to cover our strip steaks. I just may quit my day job, set up a stand & sell these. Will get back to you in 6 months when I've made my 1st million. Wonderful mushrooms!

Yummy! This was a nice treat with very little effort. I have actually wrapped this in foil with the sauce and grilled them for 20 minutes or so...it doesn't come out as thick but it still has a lot of flavor with very little mess.

If you don't have terriyaki sauce, you can substitute by using soy sauce (little less than the recipe calls for) and a teaspoon or so of sugar. I also add a bit more garlic for a more robust flavor! Delicious over grilled steak.

Superb flavor, really easy to do. Arguably better than steak-house sides of mushrooms we've had. Made for a New Years party and everyone was fully impressed. (Accompanied the Steak w/ Proscuttio and Provolone recipe - search for 'steak provone' mis-spelled).

I thought this was delicious. I made it to serve with the Ginger Soy Grilled Steak (on this website as well) and fried rice. I cut down the teriyaki a bit and added low sodium soy to make the 1/4 cup.

Rating: 3
A great side dish! You can substitute a softer red wine for the sherry if add a pinch or two of sugar. In my humble opinion, the best way to make this dish is with big beefy portobellos sliced thick. Serve it with steak and some dijon-mashed red potatoes, and you've got a serious meal.

the dish was applauded by guests. i cut the red pepper a bit, but the kick was still there. we often served mushrooms to guests & this recipe was noted as being the best of all. reducing the butter was a good idea, as noted by others.

Rating: 3
Great tasting and flexible recipe. I found that I didn't have all the ingredients available but was able to improvise with happy results. For example, in place of teriyaki sauce I used 1/8 cup (half) of soy sauce and added sugar to taste. Then for the pepper flakes I had Asian chilli sauce on hand, but I imagine fresh chillis would work just as well. Lastly I used firmer brown mushrooms and found that I could quarter these without having them get to soggy. Excellent with steak.

Overall a good recipe. My only issue is the glaze was overly sweet. Perhaps if you used less teriyaki sauce and replaced it with a low-sodium soy sauce it would be better.

A new twist on mushrooms with wine sauce. I made it with a bit more sherry and a dash of soy sauce and it didn't seem to diminish the dish at all.
