We thought this was delicious. We also added crushed peanuts to the top. We did not change any other ingredients. I don't agree with needing to use half the pasta. We used gluten free pasta as we both have gluten issues and it worked great. We will definitely make this again.

This is delicious and no need for the pasta. Less soy works, as does more ginger, and crushed peanuts or cashews on top. And do add freash cilantro. A great side dish.

a favorite at our house, I have used udon noodles, fusilli and wide flat noodles. I tend to add more ginger and soy sauce than suggested. good warm or cold.

This recipe hit my eager tongue with a dull thud. The addition of dried coriander to oil generated a grainy, unappealing dressing for this noodle salad. Too many scallions and too much oil made for a slimy train-wreck. As we masticated the dull pile of starch, the possible additions we thought of are tofu, crushed peanuts, crispy onions or shallots, or paper-thin egg strips. We would also suggest the recipe title be revised to "Coriander Noodles with Zucchini and Carrots." With standards, G+J

This was a great dish. I disagree with others about halving the pasta. It is, remember, a pasta dish with vegetables, not a vegetable dish. I experienced no discoloration of the vegetables, and I thought the seasoning was exciting. It was a real hit.

As others suggested I used 1/2 the noodles..there were still plenty. I stirred the cooked noodles into the sauce in the pan and then tossed with veggies in a bowl...prevented discoloration. Tasty dish.

It just didn't do it for me. The soy sauce colored the raw veggies an unattractive dark color. The flavor didn't thrill me, either. Needed something for more zip, crunch and texture.

Really convenient ingredients and quick. Leftovers make for an easy lunch the next day. I halve the pasta and add more vegetables.

Yummy. Substituted diced red pepper for carrots, and shallots for scallions. Added chopped fresh coriander (aka cilantro) as well.

This was good. I made it with the sesame crusted chicken and the two went well together. This would not rate as my go-to Asian noodle salad recipe, but it's a nice week night one that pulls together quickly.

A bit like a light version of cold noodles with sesame sauce.

This was quick and easy and quite good. I substituted eggplant for zucchini and added some sesame seeds.
