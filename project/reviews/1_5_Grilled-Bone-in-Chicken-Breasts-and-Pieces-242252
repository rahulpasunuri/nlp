Why all the haters? Ok its more of a set of instructions than a recipe, but its good sound grilling.

LOL at Marilou. Seriosuly, though, this is the second useless "recipe" epicurious has featured from Girls at the Grill. Give it up, Girls. You give girls everywhere a bad name.

Are you kidding? Don't grill the skin side? A grill is not an oven. With this method, you might as well bake the chicken. "Girls", this is rudimentary, and not a good way to take advantage of what grilling has to offer. How this got onto Epicurious, I'll never know. Don't grill your chicken pieces this way, it's a waste of charcoal or gas!
