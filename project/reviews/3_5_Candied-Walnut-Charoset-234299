As a converted Jew I have tried several different recipes for Charoset trying (in vain) to outdo my mother-in-law. After 12 years of trying, this recipe had both my husband and his sister secretly telling me that it was the best they had ever had. They claimed it was their mother's recipe taken up several notches. Thanks Epicurious!
