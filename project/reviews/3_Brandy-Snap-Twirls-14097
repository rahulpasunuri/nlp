These are one of my husband's favorite cookies. They are a bit tricky to manage, and once rolled, they don't stay very pretty (they kind of become a slightly crushed cylinder) but they are very good. Definitely make sure you space them out on the cookie sheet or they will merge. You could also use this as a garnish on a dessert, cut into a triangle. They are quite chewy, great flavor.

I am going to make this for a dinner party tonight and will fill with a delicious white chocolate mousse and finish off with some strawberries on the side for decoration

I'm from New Zealand and we make these all the time. We fill them with whipped cream - don't cheat and use the canned variety - it quickly sinks. Once filled they soften so have to be eaten - not a problem since they are delicious! Look online for Lyle's golden syrup (I get my mum to send it over from NZ) Good luck!

Allthough I actually didn't make this recipe, I noticed that there was no mention of what to fill the cookies with...heavy cream whipped with brandy works really well with other recipes I've tried

no suggestions as to what to put inside them!
