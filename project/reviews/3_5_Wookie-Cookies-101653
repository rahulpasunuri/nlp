when your 8 year old son says "these are the best cookies I've ever eaten," then you know it's a winner. Chewy and delicious.

I made these exactly as directed, except I only had semi-sweet chips, so just used those instead of half milk chocolate. These are a great chewy chocolate chip cookie. My usual recipe makes crispy ones, but these are nice and soft. I think this may be my new standby recipe. I think I must have made them on the small side, as they only needed about 6 minutes in the oven to be nice and golden-brown.

Fabulous! I was looking for something beyond the traditional Chocolate Chip cookie and found it! I substituted Splenda; it was wonderful. Lasted less than a day in my house!

YUM!!! I modified these to be gluten-free so my niece could eat them too - they were gone in less than 2 days (EVERYONE ate these, even people who usually shy away from gluten-free stuff)!

I found the cinnamon added a subtle flavor unique to chocolate chip cookies. A very nice cookie.

I make these all the time. Recently I used a different recipe much to the dismay of my friends and family. I think there's too much cinnamon, but they're still pretty tasty. Like another reviewer said, I'm not sure what all the fuss is about either- everyone else says these are the best ever.

I don't know what's so special about these cookies; to me they were just okay. But I made them for my office and everyone LOVED them and said they were the best chocolate chip cookies they had ever had.

These were good, but not great. They were best on the first day - somewhat crunchy rim with a soft center - but fell short the day after. I liked the cinnamon taste though.

I was looking for a classic cookies recipe, and this is definitivly it! There were are chewy, just as we like it. And the quantity is perfect, just enough to feed my little brother and his friends!

Delicious and easy to make. Soft and moist with a unique flavor. I will be making them again.

These were okay. I made a batch one night when my son had several friends sleeping over (we are talking about boy scouts, ranging from 12 to 17 years old), they ate a few, but didn't go nuts over them. I used semi sweet, white, and butterscotch chips, because that is what was in the house. It is now one week since I baked these cookies, and there are still 9 of them sitting in the kitchen. I strongly recommend the flourless peanut butter chocolate chip cookies on this site. When I make them, there are never any leftover. (they disappear as soon as anyone knows they are there)

These cookies are amazinggggggggg!!!! The second time I made these, I ran out of butter so I had to sub half of the butter with Country Crock spread instead! They tasted even better! They were much fluffier and very very delicious!

These were great! We ate them all (and hid them from our sisters). My mom said they were good also, especially with milk! We would definitely make this recipe again! The cinnamon adds a nice touch.

I thought that these cookies were a terrific change from the traditional chocolate chip cookie recipe. The addition of cinnamon really adds a unique twist, but isn't something that is too noticeable or overwhelming. The cookies come out of the oven with a nice thing layer of 'crisp', but are deliciously chewy on the inside. My only changes were to sub half of the butter with butter-flavoured shortening, as that is what I had on hand, use fewer chocolate chips (2 cups is quite a bit, I used about 1 and 1/4 cups), and I only cooked them for about nine minutes. For me, the cookies had a great chewiness and texture. Enjoy!

I thought that the addition of cinnamon was a nice twist! My fiancee complained that he liked regular chocolate chip cookies better, BUT he did eat the entire batch (What i didnt get to first that is!) within 24 hours! I give it a two thumbs up!

Rating: 3
the cookies were kinda airy and cakey.. but not dense cakey.. (maybe I don't know what I mean by cakey) anyway, everyone still thought they were really good. I like a lot of texture so I added a bunch of oatmeal, wheat germ and chopped almonds to half of the batch. they weren't too sweet either.

I made this cookies for friends (I love star wars) and they were amazing! I'd SURELY make them again! They're soft, and instead of using semi-sweet and bittersweet, i used 1 cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips, and 1 cup of butterscotch. It was very nice indeed!

These cookies are easy to make and are really a different twist on the ever popular chocolate chip cookie. My whole family loved them!

Chocolate chip cookies are not my forte. In this recipe I used semi-sweet, white chocolate, & milk chocolate chips to make up the amount called for in the recipe. Best chocolate chippers (the only truly excellent chocolate chippers) I ever made. Here's to Wookies

These cookies are really easy to make and yummy, too. The cinnamon is the key ingredient- it gives them a nice flavor- kind of different from normal chocolat chip cookies. They needed every ingredient on the recipie- no room for modification. The dough is very tasty, too. I'm sure these cookies will be in demand a lot more than i'm willing to make them!

Next time I will add a little more cinnamon but still very good cc cookies.

I divided dough in half, & patted it down in jelly-roll tins to make bars great for on-the-go people

Really great cookies! I read all the reviews and I felt pretty secure in my choice and these cookies certainly delivered. By boyfriends favorite cookies are chocolate chip and he gave these his seal of approval. Really good!

These were good chocolate chip cookies, but in my opinion nothing out of the ordinary. The recipe does make a lot, though!

Made these interesting chocolate chip cookies for my son's first grade class today. Every single child liked them, and I think that's the first time that's ever happened when I took in a treat! But don't be fooled--despite the cute name, these are not just for kids. The cinnamon makes them stand apart from other cc cookies, and I think that's a good thing. Will make these often for all the Wookies in my life!

My sons all rave about these cookies and request that I make more the moment the cookie jar begins to run low. I've made three batches in the last week (and one for the local kindergarten class -- who all raved...)! Just watch the baking time so as to not overcook -- the chewier the better.

I make these for my friends all the time- fun, easy, and delicious. A very, very good cookie.

this was a wonderful cookie. I couldn't keep them in the house more than 2 days! I'm already getting requests for more.

This was the first cookie I ever made that my family acutally ate before I could freeze them! I sacreficed some of the semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips and added white chocolate chips. Perfect "test cookie" for the 1st timer

One of the best chocolate chip cookies I have made. Doubleing the recipe is a good idea because you can never have too many of these to share or enjoy yourself. Easy enough for a dorm kitchen.

The best chocolate chip cookie bar none. I have been making them for a year or so and they have become my favorite most well known cookie.We call them Wonderful cookies. :]

Great cookies! I only had semi-sweet chips on hand and they still came out great, also used margerine instead of butter and didn't effect the plump quality at all. The only problem with these cookies- the dough is way too delectable!!

The extra vanilla and cinnamon made these distinctive and delicious...the cinnamon-chocolate combination made Nestle's morsels taste like fine french chocolate... The cookie itself was delicious...chewy and rich; it could hold it's own without any chips at all!

This is a good old fashoned chocolate chip cookie. The Cinnamon is a nice touch. If a nice chewy chocolate chip cookie is one of your comfort foods, this is it. Be careful not to overbake. I found about eight and a half minutes did it.

This is a FABULOUS recipe! The original recipe is great, but I've also changed it by adding some white chocolate chips, nuts, more cinnamon, more salt and a touch of nutmeg. This new recipe is really great too! I've had to give this recipe to sooooo many people, because once they try it....it's over....they have to be able to get their own personal supply!

I think the chocolate chips compliments the cinnamon spice flavors!! I would make them again!

These cookies are wonderful. For a real treat I used 1 cup semi sweet chips, 1/2 cup milk choc, and 1/2 cup white choc. I also added a dash of nutmeg. So yummy and chewy - these are a staple around our house now!

They didn't taste like wookies at ALL! And I like my hydrogenated trans fatty acids just FINE! But seriously - add a little nutmeg, about a teaspoon, and it's even better. And add a teaspoon more salt than suggested.

I couldn't be more disappointed. Here I sit with 37 pounds of chopped Wookie in my freezer, and this recipe deceivingly contains none! What a waste of time. :)

These have consistently rated tremendous reviews from everyone who has tried them. Better than the original tollhouse. And they stay really plump, unlike tollhouse made with butter. We make these regularly for entertaining and for everyday eating.

The cookies tasted even better 2 days later. I would add 1 cup of nuts next time but these were very good anyway.

I just read a review that advised readers to substitute half shortening for the some of the butter for "healthier" cookies. This couldn't be further from the truth. Hydrogenated fats like shortening are full of trans-fats that are extrememly detrimental to ones health. Don't believe me? Check out Dr. Andrew Weil's website to read what he says about trans fats. Sorry to put nutritional information in a recipe review but I just couldn't let that one slide.

These cookies were wonderful. We loved the how cinnamon and the chocolate complemented each other. I added a little more flour and vanilla because I inadvertantly added 1/2 cup too much granualted sugar. They were so good, even the dough was delectable!!

My family loves Wookiee Cookies better than original chocolate chip cookies now! I have brought them to numerous parties and they have been a hit.

A spiced up version of the good old fashioned original chocolate chip cookie. Too much butter for your tastes? Use 1/2 cup vegetable shortening and 1/2 cup butter. My mother did that for all her cookie recipes, they turned out healthier, chewier and delicious!

I think this is a great cookie. I am glad I found this recipe because I am a beaver leader and our theme for our Beaveree next year is on space. So I am going to make up these cookies for that day. thankyou very much.

too mush like a regular cc cookie

Wish it were a bit healthier. The added amount of butter is quite a lot and it has too much chocolate. I will try using raisins, etc. instead of all of that chocolate. Do you think Chewie will mind?

Sorry, but to me this is a sad remake of the good old chocolate chip cookie...surely someone could have came up with something original, especially for Star Wars.
