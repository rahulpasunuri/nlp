I have made this recipe several times, my brother in law has requested this instead of Thanksgiving dinner this year. My variation is I bread the chicken in dried bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper. I follow the rest of the recipe, omitting the mushrooms since they aren't my families favorite. I have also started this the night before by breading and saute'ing the chicken, putting it in a baking dish and covering it overnight. I deglaze the pan and reserve the jusices for the next day. Pre-heat the oven to 350, pour the juices and wine around the chicken, layer with lemons and bake until cooked through about 30 - 40 minutes. You may need to cover this for a bit so it doesn't dry out, but it is an excellent easy meal.

I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I substituted a cup of dried reconstituted mushroom mix. While the mushrooms were a little tough, the flavor was definitely there. I agree to more cooking time and more wine. My husband loved it.

Very easy. I added more lemon juice and used a touch of corn starch to thicken the sauce. I'm thinking this sauce would also be good with fish.

This has been in my recipe box for years -- one thing I do find is that it needs more cooking time, and more sauce, so I add an extra 1/2 cup of wine and 1/2 cup of chicken broth. My family loves this dish.

Really easy to make and very delicious! My husband cleaned his plate.

Very simple and basic recipe that tastes great. Didn't have any normal white wine, so I used vermouth instead. Also rubbed a little thyme onto the breasts in addition to tri-colored pepper and sea salt.

Loved it. Can't ask for better results from ordinary ingredients you have around the house. I did sub chopped shallots for the garlic and I did add a little Wondra at the end. Served over angel hair, asparagus on the side.

This is a good basic recipe, which allows for alterations for individual taste. I use a total of three tablespoons of unsalted butter and double the white wine, since my husband likes a lot of sauce. THICKENING: use a few shakes of WonderGravy thickening flour - it's lighter than flour and doesn't add a pasty taste to the sauce. Cut down on the lemons to cut down on bitter taste. It's the peel which adds the bitterness, so just cut down on the # of lemons you use (don't worry, there will be no lacking in flavor). It will come out smooth and lovely and not overpowered by the bittery lemon flavor. I also use white pepper. I make the sauce by itself (I add four tablespoons of chicken stock) for a nice, light but velvety sauce on broccoli Or lobster. (I use a few more "shakes" of the Wonder Gravy for broccoli and a little more butter for seafood - but I always add the chicken stock).

I wasn't super impressed with this recipe. It bordered on bitter tasting.

I make this all of the time. However, instead of leaving the chicken in big pieces, i cut it into bite size pieces and lightly coat with flour. I brown the chicken in butter and then follow the recipe. This results in a slightly thicker sauce that lightly clings to the chicken. I sometimes add capers and/or shallots to the sauce if I have them on hand.

This was a fabulous recipe! I didn't add the pieces of lemons or the white wine. Instead I added more lemon juice then the recipe called for and that combined with the chicken's juices made an exellent meal.

Has anyone tried thickening the sauce? I've made this dish many times, all successfully, but I agree... the sauce is a little runny. Just wondering what works for people.

I might try this again, however, I would make sure that I browned the chicken much more than I did. (The two minutes per side didn't do it.)It was cooked through when done, but as it didn't brown any more once I added the liquid, it had the appearance of poached chicken. Not too appetizing! The sauce was good, especially on the mushrooms.

Disappointing! I followed the recipe and was left with chicken on the dry side and a thin and insubstantial "sauce" (if you can call wine and lemon juice a sauce). There must be a better way to do lemon chicken!

We served this on our black dishes, so it looked pretty even though it's rather blah looking. The taste is fabulous, though, and don't leave out the mushrooms as they are the best part!

This is a family favorite. My children request it at least once a week. I serve over pasta with steamed spinach. It is very quick and even healthy.

Made this last night for dinner, and while OK for a weeknight dinner, it was missing something. It was rather bland, I thought.

I didnt use the mushrooms because I am not a fan of them.This dish came out very good and I will make it again.

What a great week night meal. So simple to put together. Served it over wild rice and added fresh rosemary to the pan as the sauce simmered. Defnitely a keeper! Could easily be a company meal

Very easy-although all the mushroom prep is slightly tedious. My boyfriend loved the tangy lemon and has requested it again. Next time I will add 2 additional minced garlic cloves and will saute them and mushrooms along with the chicken to add colour to the mushrooms and roated garlic taste. Given the time to cook and ingredient list, really easy and tastes as if one has gone to much more trouble. Will make again!

nice! be sure to add enough lemon juice, and be generous with the parsley.

This has the potential to be an excellent dish. I had extra thick boneless chicken breasts and they were not done cooking per the alloted time in the recipe. Cooking them longer resulted in a dish with a very pronounced bitter lemon aftertaste. Next time, I will cook everything sans the lemon slices and add them closer to the end. I think the lemons cooked too much and imparted the bitter aftertaste. Aside from that, the chicken was extremely moist and tender and it did look pretty.

This was tender and tasty, but not as good as I expected. Next time, I'd bread the chicken (so the sauce would thicken) and add tarragon or something to perk up the flavors. But it IS very easy and quick, and tasty enough to almost rate three forks.

This is a delicious dish -- and rather easy, too! I have made it with fresh everything, but it's also very good when you use canned mushrooms, jarred chopped garlic and concentrated lemon juice. I use the latter when cooking a quick but not microwaved meal for my family as these are all staples I tend to have in my house. For lemon lovers, make as is. For those who like a lighter lemon taste, skip the lemon juice and just go with the thinly sliced lemons on top. Delicious!

Found this while looking for Chinese Lemon Chicken. If someone has a recipe for it, please send it along. This was a delicious dish. I ended up adding 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream to make a creamy lemon chicken pasta dish and cut up the chicken to mix in. I also doubled the amount of mushrooms and used Italian Browns. Definitely going into the recipe box.

This was a huge hit when I served it over Rice with Dill, Walnuts, and Golden Raisins. Couldn't get enough. They compliment each other well, and the chicken is relatively easy and presents very impressively.

This was great! Very easy, yet impressive. My family enjoyed it a lot - which is hard to believe, since I'm the only one that likes mushrooms. I took the one suggestion of serving it over bowties and it was perfect. The only suggestion I have would be to reserve some sauce in a gravy boat to pass at the table. The chicken itself is bland compared to the sauce and pouring some of the sauce over the cut-up chicken on the plate easily remedies that.

Very tasty and tangy. Would certainly do it again.

Absolutely wonderful! Served it over Angel Hair pasta, with asparagus, and a baby mixed greens salad with balsamic vinagrette. In my mind the mushrooms were too lemony, but we did do 3 breasts and added extra wine and lemon juice. My boyfriend, who does NOT like chicken at all, thought it was "very good"

I just prepared this for dinner and the family loved it! I doubled the mushrooms and added extra wine and lemon juice, also added the chopped fresh parsley right into the recipe. This recipe is a keeper. Even my 2 year old liked it!

This was a very tart and tangy recipe. I added some unseasoned bread crumbs to the breasts before I sauteed them, and it turned out wonderfully! I am very glad that I did add the light coating, since the lemony sauce had a nice coating on the breasts to adhere to. I defitely recommend this recipe!

I found the sauce too watery, and a little tart. I think I was looking for something a little thicker, like a glaze. My boyfriend liked it though.

Fairly simple to prep yet the end result would never show it. I prefered to use a good beujolais (sp) rather than the dry white for the mushrooms sake.

I was looking for a recipe that was fast, easy to make, and at the same time delicious. This recipe is exactly that. Once you taste it, you get the impression that it takes hours to make. You wouldn't believe how quick it is to prepare because it has incredible flavor. I will definitely make this again.

This is not only quick, but really good. I served it on the center of the plate, and surrounded it with bow-tie pasta, then put the sauce over it all.
