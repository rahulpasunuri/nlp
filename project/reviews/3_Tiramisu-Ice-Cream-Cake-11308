Loved this recipe. Time intensive, but worth every minute. Will try cutting pound cake length wise next time. I think the finished product would look better.

I love making ice cream so when I saw this recipe a few years ago, I had to try it. I rarely make the same flavors twice because there are so many to experiment with but this is always one of a few that I keep coming back to. As time consuming as this might seem, it truly is worth the effort-eveyone eats this in absolute silence; it's THAT good. The textures and flavors of the two ice creams are perfect. I also make this lo-carb by omitting the pound cake and use chocolate powder as a light layer. It's just as yummy and simple.

Made this for a dinner party and got nothing but raves. I would make again and again. Serve with fresh raspberries and a scoop of the leftover espresso ice cream. A bit labor intensive, but well worth it.

THIS DESERT IS OF RESTAURANT QUALITY. I MADE IT FOR COMPANY YESTERDAY AND EVERYBODY RAVED ABOUT IT. A BIT TIME CONSUMING, HOWEVER, YOU CAN MAKE THE COMPONENTS AHEAD OF TIME AND PUT IT TOGETHER A COUPLE OF DAYS LATTER. I RECOMMEND IT!!

This was a very time consuming recipe but worth every step. If you are concerened about salmonella use a pasteurized egg product such as Davidsons.

This was a delicious dessert! (but not one to add to my family favorites...that's why its a 3). I made some altertations, since I don't like desserts with lots of sugar. Instead of making my own ice cream, I used Breyer's Vanilla Ice Cream (1/8 to 1/4 of a gallon) and mixed it with the marscapone cheese. Also, I used Breyer's coffee ice cream (1/8 to 1/4 of a gallon) for the expresso Ice cream. I served it when the family came over and everyone ate every last piece. Very good.

You can make this using egg-beaters and pre-packaged egg whites (available at health food stores). They are pastuerized, so there is no risk of salmonella poisoning. I use pastuerized egg products in all my ice creams for safety - still tastes great.

I would make this again with a few modifications (that's why I only gave it a 3). I for one will not eat raw egg with the health risks nowadays. You only have to get sick once from this to NEVER do it again. For the espresso ice cream I cooked the egg, sugar milk and espresso powder (omiting the water) in a double boiler until thickened. When CHILLED I added the cream (which I whipped and folded in) & vanilla. Then I froze it in the ice cream maker. For the mascarpone ice cream I combined the eggs, sugar (increasing it to 3/4 cup to sweeten enough for adding milk & cream later)) and 1/2 cup of milk. I cooked this in a double boiler until thickened. Chilled it completely. Then I beat in 1 1/2 cups of mascarpone cheese (admitedly probablly not as good as two cups called for - but the flavor came through just fine; I reduced the cheese in order to cook the raw egg with milk). Then instead of beating an egg white and adding it, I left it out and whipped 1 cup of heavy cream and folded it into the mixture. Then I froze this in an ice cream maker and continued with the recipe. With these modifications, it came out specatular and there was no worry about raw egg contamination.
