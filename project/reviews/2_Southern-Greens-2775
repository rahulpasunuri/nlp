I too was raised in the South on the overcooked slimy greens that grandma use to make. TRY this recipe before you criticize it. The greens are tender-yes in about 12 minutes, the pot likker is tasty and I am sure that the nutritional value is much higher than greens cooked for hours. SUGAR!!!!-yes if you needed to kill the bitter overcooked taste that you were use to..This recipe only benefits from an addition of vinegar pepper....

Greens, crisp? This is the least authentic southern greens recipe I have ever seen! I agree with the other reviewers recommending a good hour for cooking. I usually go for longer, if I have the time. Also, I add a pinch of sugar, some hot sauce--and Lawry's too. Don't forget the vinegar at the table.

I couldn't rate it nor would I make it. I have to agree with the others, having been born and bred in the south and raised on collards, turnip and mustard greens, that is NOT how you prepare greens! And 12 minutes "ain't" gonna cut it!!

It's interesting reading advice from folks in San Francisco and Washington on how to cook Southern dishes. How to make them crispy and add all manner of extraneous ingredients. You know less about Southern food than the turkey who wrote the recipe.

I don't even have to try this recipe tell you that it's not good. A little bit of advice, I'm a southern girl, who can't eat pork. Smoked turkey necks are just as good, but if I'm cooking for a bunch of vegetarians, I use white miso (found in asian markets or health food stores) as my flavoring. I don't know the ratio of water to miso to the greens. I go by taste. Many of my veggie friends are sooooo happy that they could eat greens that taste like they came from the south. I sauté 1 lg. onion in olive oil. Add the water that has been pre-mixed with the miso. Add salt and pep. Bring to boil. Add the greens. Add white vinegar, flavored with dried red. pepper, to taste. Cook 45 min. to an hr. Before anyone criticizes my greens, PLEASE try them before responding to this message. You'll be surprise how good these greens are.

wow i can tell that some of you are not southern. black southerners have invented this dish and let me tell you the people who say greens should be crispy and you should add olive oil and baking soda are not etnic or southern cause that is absoloutly riduclous please dont listen to them pork shoulder is wrong for this dis as well you should use ham hock or salt pork or even smocked turkey necks if you want flavor without fat and yes you need to cook them for an hour to 45 minutes at least.

I certainly wouldn't make this the way it is. It needs a chopped onion, a pinch of crushed pepper flakes and a sliced clove of garlic. Use a ham hock, not pork shoulder. To the last person who worried about losing crispness if cooking the greens more than 12 minutes - you obviously are NOT a Southerner. Greens were never intended to be crisp! If you want to cook them that way, fine. But don't call them Southern. They need long slow cooking to develop the liker, at least 45 minutes and up to several hours.

The modifications suggested by other chefs are key: Definitely use an onion (I halved mine and tied the halves with twine so they wouldn't fall apart, though a little loose onion never killed anyone). Definitely add a pinch of baking soda. Now, as for technique: Browning the pork shoulder (or salt pork, which is what I used) will add flavor. Despite the advertised "REAL" Southern flavor advertised by the chef who recommends that you boil the greens for an hour, this is just plain wrong. Simmer the greens for 8-12 minutes _at most_ if you want them to maintain any crispness. If crispness is especially important, use collards and kale instead of mustard or beet tops -- these latter two are particularly soggy even after a few minutes. Tune the seasoning at the end with red pepper and vinegar, and you can really impress your guests.

Anybody out there still use pig tails in their collards?

The gist of this recipe is right, but you need to put the greens in the pot right from the start and slow cook everything together to get the flavor and consistency of REAL southern collards.

I would only make again with these variations: add onion, garlic, crushed red pepper or a diced jallapeno; a dash of baking soda for tenderizing, and a small amount of sugar. I used lean diced ham for the meat, my sister used smoked turkey and eliminated the pepper--too spicy for her children--both were great.

Very Important: Add 1 big onion whole or in half for flavor and Lowry's seasoning salt or similar. Serve with white vinegar, hot sauce and cornbread. That's the southern way

Would like to see ham hocks or fat back smoked in the recipe.
