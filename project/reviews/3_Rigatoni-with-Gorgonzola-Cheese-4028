A winner for lovers of bleu cheese -- my husband begged for this dish on a snowy night. I made a few modifications based on the reviews here and my own preferences: I used only 8 ounces of gorgonzola and 1/4 cup of heavy cream but kept the proportion of Béchamel sauce the same. I also added a pinch of nutmeg and cayenne to the cheese sauce for a little extra warmth, and panko bread crumbs as a lighter alternative. It's perfect with steamed broccoli. Would absolutely make again.

Upon the advice of previous reviewers, I decided to mellow out the gorgonzola, which apparently many found overpowering. Rather than cutting out some of the cheese, I opted for adding carmelized onions (two large ones). I also used the butter from the onions as the base for the sauce, and I added a touch of nutmeg to the sauce. My guests loved it - I'm making this dish again tonight, by request.

This dish is very tasty by itself. I usually serve it with stewed tomatoes (with lots of garlic) and a side salad. My husband also likes the sauce served over pasta. I am thinking of trying it with sundried tomatoes in the future.

This recipe is not happening. The cheese is overpowering. No one liked this dish when we served it. It also comes out green because of the color of the gorgonzola. Yuck.

I could not find Gorgonzola cheese in the three stores I visited so I improvised with a nice mild Blue Castello cheese I found at Trader Joe's. I also used fat free milk and not as much cream as the recipe called for. I threw in a handful of walnuts and skipped the first steps of melting butter with breadcrumbs - I used just a few breadcrumbs on top of the dish before I popped it into the oven. I was also kind of annoyed that once I read this recipe thoroughly, I discovered it asks you to use FOUR pans. Ridiculous! I improvised the whole recipe but it turned out wonderfully and I can'r wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!

I find it hard to believe that anyone doesn't love Gorgonzola.

I thought that this would be much better without the bread crumbs on top. Overall, the gorganzola was too overpowering by itself, there needed to be another flavor to offset it, and as I have not figured out what that should be, I'm not making it again.

The first time I made this it seemed to dry out too much in the oven. Next time, I just increased the milk and cream and it was great.
