Update: Won the bake-off! These cookies are awesome and crowd-pleasers! I didn't end up cutting the hole in the top cookie because it was a pain. Still did the jelly (seedless red raspberry). Still delicious!

I made these cookies for a bake-off at the office and won! Am making them again this year (new company). Will let you know how I do!

I too have been making these cookies for Valentine's Day since '99. My family wouldn't know Valentine's Day with out these. I even send them to my older children who now live out of state. Yes, the dough is fragile, I suggest waiting until the cookie completely cools on tray or slide parchment paper carefully to solid surface until cool. Yes, they are time consuming, and rolling them out is rather tricky. Yes, they are sweet, but most cookies are. I use raspberry jam and a high quality chocolate for the filling (heavy on the filling). But, all that being said, family and co-workers look forward to this once a year treat.

These were pretty yummy and I made them without the filling. I cut out 2" hearts, misted them with water before attaching little tiny 1/2" hearts on the center. After cooling the baked cookies, I drizzled melted couveture chocolate with a fork. They looked lovely! Not too sweet either when omitting the filling

These looked beautiful, but they were far too sweet sweet. I think I ate 1, my husband ate a few more, and we tossed the rest. So sad.

The most divinely delicate combination of chocolate and peanut butter! These cookies are richly satisfying and will amply compensate bakers for the extra time and effort needed to bake them.

Very time consuming but good. Use flour for rolling pin and work surface, not sugar! Also, the dough was fragile so I opted for two solid hearts, which was easier than cutting shapes out of half the hearts. Finally, I saved time by making a simple peanut butter frosting. I just mixed about 6 Tbsp. butter with about 1/2 cup PB, and then added about 1 1/2 cups sifted powdered sugar. The mixture was thick so I added some light cream. Just use this and spread between the cookies.

I had rave reviews from everyone who saw (beautiful) and tasted (delicious) these cookies! However, people should know they are very rich and must be served with a tall glass of cold milk or your beverage of choice. I have to admit I don't do much baking (they nevertheless came out perfectly, it's an easy recipe), so in hindsight I would small heart shapes to make the forms. My hearts were bigger than a typical cookie, and they are so rich that most were only able to eat half a cookie at a time. I enjoyed baking these and my husband and friends enjoyed receiving them for Valentine's day.

I made these for the 1st time in Feb '99. Every Valentine's Day since I make more and more to give away. I wasn't planning to make them this year ( 2 year old + a new baby= no time) but everyone was really looking forward to them. Definetly make a double batch and wrap them in cellophane for little gifts.

I also used homemade raspberry jelly and tons of chocolate between each cookie. I don't really feel like they were PB&J cookies - maybe it is the huge amount of chocolate I use. Cooling on the cooking sheet is a must. I make them every year for Valentines Day.

These cookies are great for kids,my 3 year old really liked the cookies plain(without the chocolate and jam).Adults,however,don't seem to care for the pb&j flavor.They look great though, if I ever made them again I would use a good butter cookie recipe instead of peanutbutter.

This was a totally fun cookie to make with my toddlers. They tasted like peanut butter and jelly with a fun twist. Huge success with the four year old.

Well worth the effort, but you must have a serious sweet tooth to really enjoy these cookies. Do wait before removing them from the cookie sheet! I used a high quality homemade strawberry jam. They make a great tasting and beautiful gift.

I have made these cookies for my family the past two years and we all love them. Be careful removing them from the cookie sheet when they are warm because they break very easily.

These cookies are definitely time consuming but I received raves- I used seedless raspberry jam instead of strawberry- will again make for special occasions ( great for wedding showers )

I thought it was a lot of trouble for a good result. The recipe didn't mention this, but it worked for me: leave the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 or so minutes after they come out of the oven, then transfer them to a rack to finish cooling. I found the fresh from the oven cookies are too soft to successfully remove from the baking sheet. My yield was only about 10 sandwichs total, no where near the 22 stated in the recipe. They're good cookies, but not worth the effort to me.

Fabulous! Great Texture and wonderful satiated feeling after!
