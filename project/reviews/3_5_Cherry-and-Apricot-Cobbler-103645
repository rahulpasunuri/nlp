Excellent recipe. Easy to prepare, not a lot of ingredients. Really good flavor combinations. Loved the apricots with the cherries, and a hint of almond. Cobbler dough is rich but still light. Make sure you use a dish with high enough sides so it doesn't bubble over. You need the right ratio of dough to fruit. This will become a standby.

Icut back on the sugar to only 1/2 cup because my cherries were sweet. I also only used 2 tbs of conrstarch insteadh of 3. It was very good (even though I wish I had a cherry pitter). The combination of the apricots and the berries was very good. I added some fresh currants I had for tartness. It is true the topping soaks up a lot of the juice. I did not have spillage problems but I did use a pan with high sides - a metal one instead of a glass one.

Got rave reviews from my customers. In one batch I used frozen sweet cherries (straight from the bag); in the other, canned. Frozen is better. This crust is wonderful, very old- fashioned. I used whipping cream, no buttermilk. Great recipe!

This was fabulous! The almond and cherry aroma was sensational and the fruit colors made a beautiful presentation. We enjoyed it immensely!!!

I have already made this dish three times this summer and it was a huge hit every time! Last time substituted peaches for apricots and was still delicious!

I gave this cobbler one star as the definition was "just so-so" it's not horrible or offensive, but it is nothing to write home about either! I think it was a waste of delicious fruit. I won't be making this again. I made it in two, deeper pans per previous recommendations, and there was no bubbling over. However, here was also no fruit and juice. There is too much cornstarch in this recipe. I even had extra fruit, which was ripe and juicy and the finished product was fruit flavored biscuits. I would recommend if you want to make this, halve the biscuit portion.

I used fresh Bing cherries and frozen peach slices. I would follow one person's suggestion: add less sugar (1/2c) to the filling and maybe some lemon zest to the topping. The biscuit topping came out really well. I cooked the fruit along with my chicken dinner and cooked the topping while we were eating dinner. Timing worked beautifully.

I made this for a backyard barbecue and my guests raved -- much better than serving boring old strawberry shortcake. I made it exactly as directed. The buttermilk biscuit topping was very tasty. I placed the baking dish on a foil-lined cookie sheet because it did run over the sides.

This was a great cobbler. I made it with cherries straight off the tree and some not-quite-ripe apricots, and it turned out fine. It bubbled over, as others mentioned, making me wish I had a taller pan or hadn't filled it so full.

made this with frozen cherries and frozen mixed berries for my sister's family at Thanksgiving - really superb. She asked me to make it again that weekend - it was a big hit!

I love cobbler and this has become a family favorite. I like to split the recipe into 2 smaller dishes and have one for breakfast the next day.

VERY GOOD, I'VE MADE IT TWICE IN THE LAST TWO WEEKS, THE LAST TIME WITH CHERRIES, PEACHES AND PLUMS. THE TOPPING IS GREAT

fetched rave reviews at a fourth of july party. i echo the sentiment of the other cook who said their topping bubbled over. either line the oven with some foil, use a higher sided dish, or go lighter on the fruit (last resort, as far as i'm concerned). very easy. best served the day it is baked, however, because the topping starts to lose its texture after resting overnight.

Wonderful dish, I will make it every year. Everyone loved it, even my husband who doesn't like apricots. With so many apricots ripe at the same time it is difficult to use all of the fresh fruit. I think I will try freezing the filling in batches to use throughout the year.

This was great! The people who ate it said it was the best cobbler EVER! I used blackberries and nectarines - 2 lbs. of each. The filling bubbled over a little when I baked it with the topping. So next time I will use a little less fruit. I did not use almond extract in the filling. I only mixed it with 1 cup of sugar and 3 tbl. of cornstarch. Dee-lish!

I would not make this recipe again. Apricots are too expensive to waste on this. Make the rasperry apricot shortcake in the june 2000 issue instead.

I didn't think this is worth making again. The topping must have soaked up all the juices because the filling was dry. I did add the lemon zest to the topping which gave it a nice flavor. Maybe less cornstarch is needed.

Frozen cherries and canned apricots work fine in this recipe. A couple of comments: I found the fruit filling a little too sweet, and suggest adding only 1/2-2/3 C to the fruit mixture. Also, the topping is a bit plain. Adding 1.5 T lemon zest makes it more flavourful.

I made this today with cherries (frozen) and peaches instead of apricots (those being nowhere in sight) Two things I would change...I think it needs a bit less almond extract, and I also think less topping. With #2 cherries and #2 peaches, the topping "ate" a lot of the fruit syrup. If I make it again, I will make 1/2 the topping.

Very nice. As suggested by a previous reviewer, I used peaches and blueberries. I like a lot of fruit, but don't use much more than 7 or 8 cups of fruit total. Even though more fruit will "fit" in a 13" x 9" pan, it will bubble over and spill (and burn on the bottom of the oven), so don't get overly enthusiastic with the fruit (ah, the voice of experience... said as I am STILL cleaning the oven from this...). The biscuit topping is very nice and delicate -- I sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the "crust" before baking, which was also nice.

This was so tasty and easy to make! I too added about 2 tbsp more sugar on the final sprinkle and will try this recipe again with fresh peaches and berries.
