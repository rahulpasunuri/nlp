So so so good! The perfect way to showcase summer fruit. I had great ripe peaches, so I cut back on the sugar in the filling by 1/2. And I substituted vanilla extract for the bean. The dough did get a little sticky on me-- I think the pastry cutter is a good idea.

I made this tonight and it was incredibly good! The season for peaches is over here, but I saw some nice ones at the store so I decided to get them. I used eight large peaches, and they weren't especially ripe, but after they were cooked they were sweet, tender, and flavorful. I did not have any problem with the dough being sticky, but I did not mix the butter in by hand. I would recommend using a pastry cutter and cutting the cold butter in that way, like making a pie dough. I used all of the heavy cream and it was perfect. I did add a little fresh grated nutmeg into the filling for the biscuits. I also did not bother with the whole vanilla bean. Simply scrape the beans into the peaches and mix. It is a good "make-ahead" recipe for company. If you make the biscuit logs, peel and cut the peaches (mix them with the lemon juice, wrap tightly and refrigerate), and mix the sugar/flour ahead of time, it is very easy to assemble and put in the oven later. I served it with vanilla ice cream. I will definitely make this again, and often!!!

I've made this for several years and find it to be a wonderful recipe. I just use 2-3 teaspoons of a high quality vanilla in the filling instead of using the whole vanilla bean or even the seeds. It always takes longer to bake than the recipe says, but I serve it every year at a peach dessert party and it is always a hit (more so since I stopped using the whole vanilla bean).

Everybody LOVED this recipe! I found it super easy to make. Dough got soft as I was rolling it out so I stuck it in the fridge for a 10 minutes before making the roll. I halved the recipe but used an extra pound of peaches. Next time I'll use a couple of extra pounds to give people a more generous serving as they did cook down quite a bit. I'm definitely going to try this with other fruits! This is a great change from the typical cobbler.

I hosted a Christmas Eve gathering and served just desserts, juices and cocktails. My nine year old son, who is discovering baking and cooking, made all of the desserts. All were good, but this one proved best given that only a few spoons-full were left at the end of the evening. He added mangoes to this very easy dish to round out the peaches, and quite frankly, to make use of food we already had in the house. I worried because we used frozen organic fruit, but as I said, I worried for nothing because the empty pan was a testimony to the tastiness of this cobbler. My nine year old made this quite successfully, and found making the pinwheels an extra, fun bonus second only to licking the mixing spoon!

I cut back just a tad on the flour, and used candied ginger instead of crystallized ginger. We had leftover biscuits that wouldn't fit on top of the peaches, so I just put them on a greased baking pan and cooked for 20 minutes. They made a good hors d'oeuvre.

I made it for a small dinner party, one person there had been sick and hadn't eaten in 4 days, she ate everything and had seconds on this dessert. I used a vanilla powder instead of the bean and found it worked just as well. Even the pickiest eaters enjoyed it.

Family says this is the best cobbler yet. Had no problem with the dough, and did scrape the vanilla bean as I have no food processor. I agree that more peaches might be the thing to do next time.

great recipe! i added some blueberries because they work well with peaches and for color. i added a lot so i had a lot of juice and the biscuits soaked up all of the juice and became soggy. i just baked it for a long time so the juice thickened and the biscuits were no longer soggy. i used a whole vanilla bean ($7!!!) but it had no taste! i think the flavor was all covered up by the blueberries. next time i won't bother with the bean.

Hmmm...interesting. I used wonderful peaches from the local farmer's market, added blueberries b/c I didn't have enough peaches, but I still didn't care for it much. I felt that the fruit was too sour despite almost tripling the sugar in the filling. I also accidentally used 2/3 C. sugar in the biscuits instead of 1/2 C. This made the biscuits icky sweet, but I think 1/2 C. might have been too much also. The guests loved it and raved over it, but I just thought it wasn't that great.

I am not a confident cook or baker, and I took this recipe on with some trepidation. I was very grateful to everyone who had taken the time to write reviews so that I'd know what difficulties I might face. Here's what made my dish easy and nearly perfect: 1. I used only 1/2 cup of whipping cream for the biscuits. I rolled it on a piece of floured waxed paper and used the paper to help me roll it up. No issues - it went very smoothly. 2. I scraped out the insides of the vanilla bean instead of using the pod as well. Loved the look of the little seeds on the peaches. 3. I used about 5 pounds of barely ripe peaches (which worried me!), but they were just fine. I used an 11 1/2 by 8 1/2 corningware dish, and pre-cooked the peaches only 15 minutes (if they'd been more ripe, I'd have skipped this step altogether). 4. I baked the dish ten minutes extra so that the biscuits were very golden and the liquid at the sides was starting to carmelize. The only thing I'd change for next time is to use more peaches. The thickness of the biscuits could use a more substantial serving of the fruit. My friend, who is an amazing cook and caterer wanted this recipe, which I think is the ultimate endorsement!

We loved this! It's also suprisingly simple. I didn't have crystalized ginger, so I just used ground. Just fine. The visual of this dish is lovely, the filling easy. Perfect with vanilla ice cream.

Following previous reviews, I used less cream in the dough; it was still sticky, but manageable. I also scraped the seeds out of the vanilla bean rather than chopping up the whole bean -- I've never heard of using the pod before and didn't like the sound of the tough chunks. I made the dough log and the fruit filling the night before and refridgerated (separately) overnight, then sliced the dough and baked the cobbler the day I served it. That was a great time-saver and worked very well. The cobbler turned out really well and was a nice change from my usual apple crisp-type topping. I'll use more ginger next time.

This is a terrific and unusual recipe -- beautiful for guests and delicious for leftovers for breakfast the next morning (IF you have leftovers!). I read the previous reviews and I think I solved the sticky dough/rolling problem. No need to make your counter a floury mess. Just take a large sheet of saran wrap and roll the dough out on that (use a second sheet on top of the dough so your rolling pin doesn't stick). Worked great for me -- I didn't even need to refridge. the dough before brushing it w/butter, sprinkling with the sugar mix, and rolling it up. After I rolled it, I let it sit in the fridge for an hour before cutting. Also, like other reviewers, I just assembled the filling ingredients but did not prebake it. It turned out perfectly -- not too mushy. I agreed w/other reviewers about chopping up the vanilla bean (YUCK!) so I just scraped half a bean's worth of seeds into the filling mix. More than enough vanilla flavor for my taste. Good luck!

I had no trouble with the dough being sticky, in fact, I found it fairly dry. I think it has to do with being in a dry location. I made the dough according to the recipe, but I didn't have a vanilla bean so didn't add that to the peaches. I was half a pound short on the peaches and used a pint of blueberries to make up the difference. The only thing I will change in the recipe is to increase the amount of flour in the fruit. Peaches are in season right now, and they cook up very juicy. I may also add some chopped candied ginger to the peach mixture. Everyone was snuffling around the kitchen when it came out of the oven. When I asked if I should make this for my father's birthday, the answer was a resounding yes!

This cobbler is so unique and tasty; both in presentation and taste. I am a big fan of crystallized ginger, and it is fantastic with the peaches. The pinwheels are so good and easy to do, but I agree that less cream makes them less sticky. I baked a few leftover pinwheels on a greased baking sheet, and they are wonderful on their own! A great cookie! And, about the vanilla bean.... I have never heard of grinding the entire pod before, so did as I usually do and scraped the beans out of the pod itself. The flavor was still there as well as the little black flecks of vanilla. Will do again and try different fruits as they are available.

This is a wonderful way to use ripe peaches. i've made it twice using 2% milk, 1/2 cup of sugar in the biscuits, 1/4 cup of sugar with the peaches, and twice as much ginger. delicious!! (and even when the dough was too sticky and didn't roll up nicely it still tasted just as good)

I have made this recipe a dozen times over the last two years and it is always a hit, both at home and at the office and it's so easy and quick to whip up...I'd recommend it to anyone who loves fresh peaches and ginger because these two ingredients blend so well together in this recipe.

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!! I made this dish for my dad for father's day and he loved it. Brought the rest to my office and they loved it. The advice about refrigerating helped considering I was making it in Sint Maarten and it's extremely humid here. Definitely put less cream in it. Thanks everyone.

A big thank you to everyone who offered advice on how to make this receipe perfect!! I added 1/4 cup of chopped pecans to the sugar mixture. I only added 1/2 cup whipping cream to the dough - it rolled out perfectly and after several hours in the fridge, it cut perfectly. My peaches were very ripe, so I just put the pinwheels on top of the raw peaches and baked it for 45 minutes. It was heavenly - and got raves from my company. Thank you for helping me make this dessert such a success!

This cobbler was so tasty. Since peaches weren't in season I substituted mango for the peaches - everyone loved it. If you like mango I highly recommend trying the substitution!

Oh My Goodness! My sister, Mom, and I were at the cabin for a girls' weekend -> it was not a good idea to make the entire recipe, as not a bit went uneaten. I am a lover of desserts, but especially cobblers --> this one is amazing! I had no crystalized ginger (and there was none to be found at the local store) so I used 1/4 tsp ground ginger. I made the dough using 2/3 C whipping cream and again using 1/2 C. I agree that using 1/2 C is the way to go. I am making this for my upcoming beading party (tomorrow night) and dinner party (the next night). I will be also making a recipe for "Bill the Builder" Garrett who is so kind to hang my new door for me --> so I guess I will be baking this great cobbler tonight too!

This recipe turned out beautifully, depsite some troubles along the way. I was making this for a small dinner party at my cottage this summer, (which is not air conditioned) on an incredibly humid day. Consequently, the dough became incredibly sticky and had to be refrigerated on numerous occasions. Other than that, this turned out very well and all the guests raved about it, even the ones who generally don't eat dessert! A perfect late-summer dessert. Simple, easy and tasty.

I'm not a huge fan of peaches, but I thought it was tasty. My guests loved it so I've used their opinions for my rating. Like everyone else, I sifted the vanilla bean pieces out. The dough was a little sticky, so I rolled it out on floured wax paper; it's much easier to peel the dough off of the wax paper than off the counter. The filling need more flour (my peaches were ripe).

I baked this twice over the long weekend. I'm an inexperienced baker and had much difficulty working with the dough because of the stickiness. So much so that I almost gave up and threw it out....both times. :-) However, while my pinwheels didn't look as nice and neat as in the photograph, the flavor was all there and it was excellent. The 2nd time I got rid of the ginger and I sifted out the large pieces of vanilla. And I baked for 15 minutes without the topping and then 45 minutes with the topping. Even better.

probably one of the best peach cobblers i've ever tasted. definitely worth the extra work. i reduced the amount of whipping cream to avoid an overly sticky dough.

My guests were so impressed! I incorporated the following reviewer suggestions: Add 1/4 c chopped pecans to spiced sugar, use 1/2 c cream, sift out lg. pieces of vanilla bean, cook peaches for 15 min. then bake an additional 35 min. with the dough, serve with vanilla ice cream. Very yummy!

This was the best cobbler I have ever made. Always rave reviews from adults to children. Serve with homemade vanilla ice cream. I added pecans to the cinnamon sugar.

Very good. It fit perfectly in a 12x7.5 glass pan. Be sure to adjust the amount of flour used with the fruit, if peaches are really juicey. The dough was too soft to handle even with cold ingredients. I lined a rimmed baking sheet with plastic and dusted it with flour. Then I patted out the dough onto the plastic and refrigerated. Once chilled, I used the plastic to help make the roll. It worked fine. Next time, I would reduce the sugar in the dough as a personal preference and start with 1/2 cup cream to prevent being too sticky. Sifting out the large pieces of vanilla bean is a good idea. Even with a small food processor, some pieces were too large and turned chewy. Even still, it's great tasting.

Rating: 3
I also omitted the vanilla from the sugar and did not cook the peaches twice. I refrigerated the dough after mixing but before rolling and it was still rather sticky. Vey pretty to serve but wait full 10 mintutes as recipe states to let it set up a bit. Ginger hard to mince but worth the effort.

This recipe required alot more prep than your usual cobbler, but then again it's a level above the usual. Loved the addition of crystallized ginger in the biscuits. I prepared the dough in my food processor using the "pulse" feature so not to over-process and heat up the butter. The dough was fairly easy to handle on a well floured board. Again, the less you handle the dough the better due to our hands being warm. Didn't use the vanilla bean called for in the filling and didn't miss it. My peaches were ripe but not too soft so the amount of sugar was right on. Next time I will half-bake the filling or cut the peaches larger so they don't cook down so much. Used a 12x9x2 pyrex dish and bake time after adding biscuits was 35 mins. using convection. Very nice presentation.

Excellent! Only changes were no vanilla bean and no pre-cooking the peaches. Even though it bubbled over and made a mess in the oven, it was definately a great dish. Will definately make it again.

Following some of the other comments, I cut back a bit on the sugar, and used a food processor to pulverize the crystallized ginger and the vanilla bean, each with their associated ingredients. The dough was a bit wet/sticky, so next time I may chill it before rolling it out, then again after. Also, I thought the cooking time was rather long. SInce the peaches I used were VERY ripe, rather than have them turn completely to mush, I put the dough on top of the uncooked peach mixture, then baked the whole thing for 45 minutes. The taste...wonderful! And the smell in kitchen while this was baking was out of this world! Will definitely make again.

I felt the spiced sugar in the dough was overkill; too sweet for me. Also, the dough was so wet that I made it twice, and lowered the volume of whipping cream. It was still hard to handle. The vanilla bean was excellent, but hard to pulverize adequately. A mortar and pestle might work better. I have to say, my husband loves this recipe.

Rating: 4
Perfect! I did substitute ground ginger for the crystallized; I just don't care for the texture. I also sifted the sugar/vanilla bean mixture to get rid of the larger pieces of bean. I served this at a dinner party and everyone thought it was absolutely beautiful and delicious. I baked the peaches earlier in the day and then finished the baking so it would be warm for serving.

A little more work than my customary cobbler, but so good. I didn't have a 10 inch cake pan so I used 10 inch cast iron skillet. Worked just fine. I had a little trouble getting the vanilla bean chopped finely enough as I only have large size Cuisinart and I don't think the volume of sugar was enough to fill bowl properly. If you have a mini processor, use it. Next time I will use more peaches and cook them a little less.
