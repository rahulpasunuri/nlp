Absolutely delicious. The flavors are deep and very earthy. The shiitake mushrooms add a very hearty flavor. I used the stock in a mushroom soup. White mushrooms, portobello, green onions, and tofu.

Can someone please tell that NY resident that you just place ALL ingredients in the pot as they are listed -- and the instructions read "Add the remaining ingredients", that is just what Ms. Somerville meant. It's really just a matter of having all the ingredients ready, and just forging ahead. That's how all of us learned -- just by doing, and mistakes won't hurt the broth. We old follks just went ahead and did it. Be brave.

This is an excellent vegetarian stock. I used to to make a mushroom soup and everyone raved

Uh, I know that stocks are simple, but this recipe has NO instructions on how/when to combine the ingredients...(I'm REALLY new at cooking!) Thanks.
