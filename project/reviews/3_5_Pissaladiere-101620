Topping was good, but the crust was a bit more buttery, crumbly and shortbread-like than the doughier pissaladiere I remember eating. Perhaps my memories have been tainted by years of eating many terrible pizzas since my first nicoise pissaladiere experience.

My husband has made pissaladiere before with mixed results. I made this recipe, using capers instead of black olives (just beacuase I did not have any on hand) as well as a mixture of red and vidalia onions. I used prepared pizza dough (Publix brand is outstanding) and let it rise a couple of times before working and rolling out. I used only about 8 anchovies chopped fine and sprinkled over the onions. I added freshly cut chives, basil and thyme and a little lemon zest. It was delicious and my husband admitted that it was so much better than his! He is a wine educator and we had a Domaine de Paris Cotes de Provence rose which paired beautifully - especially since this is a dish from Provence. I will definitely make this again.

Very tasty. I used store-bought dough so I can't comment on that part, but I think next time I'll try the same toppings on puff pastry. I used 3 good-sized Vidalia onions and it was the perfect amount for a standard large pizza. I used green olives instead of the Nicoise, I think next time I will cut down on the olives a bit and keep the anchovies/capers because all of it together was a bit salty for me. Otherwise, easy and delicious.

Easy and delicious. Made exactly as shown. Looks good, tastes amazing. Had to keep anchovies to 1/4 but the capers and olives actually did provide enough salt for the other 3/4. Big party hit!

MMMMMMM. The crust was great and completely satisfied any salt craving we may have had. Made it half anchovies and half without. We found that the part without anchovies was still salty enough for our tastes. Could not find Nicois olives anywhere so subbed California blacks. We also shaped our crust like France.

My husband made this dish as an appetizer and we loved it. He used the kalamata olives, anchovies and the puff pastry. It took only 30 min. to make and it was great - the saltiness of the olives and capers against the sweet onions really worked. Next time we will serve as appetizer w/champagne.

Very easy, especially with puff pastry. I am not an anchovie fan (I found out) so I won't rate this in fairness to the recipe - but if you don't know if you like anchovies or not, you might want to add some chopped tomato to cut the saltiness. I think I would have liked it better that way, but then, I know it wouldn't have been pissaladiere.

This was excellent! The crust is delicious (and not too small, as another reviewer suggested) and kept well, due to an emergency, made TWO days in advance, as did the onion topping. I used Kalamata olives and only 8 anchovies. Some preferred with the 'chovies, most preferred w/o. Next time I'll put anchovies on one side only. This recipe is absolutely a keeper and paired well with the pear, leek & gruyer tartlets and the blue cheese-pecan crackers from this site.

the pastry was not enough for the quantity of onions. Will use puff pastry next time.

I made this recipe with Walla-Walla sweet onions and substituted 4 ounces of Feta cheese for the anchovies. I love anchovies but I can't seem to convince my family. The Feta came out toasty and added the salty element. It was a great counter point to the richness of the onions. Untraditional, but I promise I'll make it right the next time.

I enjoyed it more served cold the next day. Sliced into small wedges, it makes a nice appetizer to serve with drinks. JT

To save time, I used puff pastry sheets and they did a fantastic job. I made one with anchovies and one without. Everyone raved about them. Definitely a failsafe recipe.

I tried this dish after seeing Julia Child prepare it on her PBS program some years ago. I lost the recipe, so I'm happy to see it here. This may initially sound gross, between the load of onions and the anchovies, but if you use sweet onions, such as vidalias, it is unbelievably sweet, salty, and just plain delicious! I have prepared it at several dinner parties as a first course, and received rave reviews, even though some guests were unaware of the ingredients! Try it, you'll like it!
