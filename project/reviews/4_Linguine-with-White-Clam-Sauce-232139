We had leftover live clams from last nights' paella and wanted to make a clam white wine sauce. My first ever. I didn't necessarily need to Double the liquids. Right amount of spicy and just oh so quick and easy to make. Would be a good guest dinner. Serve with a toasted baguette. I highly recommend live clams as the shells pretty up the dish.

Great recipe! I used canned clams, added more wine and juice, and reduced the hot pepper.

LOVED IT! however next time I would 1 1/2 the sauce, needs a tad bit more. I would also only use 1/4 or a little more of the red hot pepper flakes, to spicy for the kids!

This was great. I was hungry and threw this together quick. I used canned clams, 4 small cans. The more clam juice the better. I like lots of sauce when I have pasta, and you may want to use more clam juice if your like me. This was very tasty and flavorful.

This was surprisingly good, given its simplicity. Per previous reviews, I added can of clams and some stock (lobster stock in this case). Served over freshly made homemade linguini and it was delicious!

We LOVE this recipe-we use fresh manila clams from Pike's Market-and we increase the wine and clam juice as well. Fast and easy. It's our favorite recipe for guests-we bring to the market to get the clams and then whip up the pasta.

I doubled the recipe - big fam. Like others, I increased both clam juice and wine. I also decreased the onion amount to about 2/3 what it suggested and reduced the olive oil amount slightly. It was excellent.

As many reviewers suggested, I doubled the wine and clam juice. I think I may squeeze a slice or two of lemon over the top. My husband says it was much better after it sat for 45 minutes or so. I may also attempt to not cook pasta all the way but rather immerse it in the sauce to cook for the last 5 minutes. It was exceptional as is.

The onion masks the briny flavor of the clams. It was tasty enough but I prefer a more traditional clam sauce. I agree with the others who recommend more liquid.

I used canned cherrystone clams and put the water from the can instead of the clam juice. Also topped the pasta with a little fresh grated cheese. Tasty!

Linguini with White Clam Sauce is one of my favorite Italian dishes. This recipe, for me, was ruined by the onion. It was overpowering. Even with more than 6 cloves of garlic, I could barely taste the it over the onion in the finished product.

I doubled this recipe to make for our Christmas Eve dinner. It was delicious and easy. Before adding the cockles to the liquid, I soaked them in a flour/water bath so they would release whatever grit was in them. In addition to the cockles, I also added about 1 cup of chopped clams with their juice.

I have tried two other linguine with clams recipes from Epicurious and this is hands-down the best I have tried. The consistency is not too heavy and the flavor is wonderful. I used 2 cup of chopped clams instead of fresh as that is what I had in the pantry. I doubled the liquid as others have suggested (which I feel is a must with this recipe). I added about a teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in clam juice to help the sauce adhere to the pasta. Once the pasta was added to the sauce, all of the sauce was absorbed. To moisten the pasta, I added some of the pasta water and more clam juice to get the consistency just right. I also used a bit of fish sauce at the end instead of salt to taste. Note: The is not a traditional white sauce as the title implies, all the liquid is absorbed by the pasta. Generally when it comes to pasta, I am a sauce person. However, this was so tasty I didn't miss the sauce.

Also doubled liquid ingredients for sauce (clam juice and wine) and bottom line...big hit with my family. A little tomato paste (2tsp) is a nice addition as well...cuts the heat from the pepper flakes. Bravo! Definitely will make again.

There are a lot of white clam sauce recipes. This is one of the better ones. As with most 'white sauces' made with wine and not many other ingredients, the wine you put in is what you will really taste. Don't eat what you wouldn't drink.

Great recipe but needed more"sauce".Extra clam juice and added a ladle of pasta water. Used red onion (all I had!)and it was still good. Perfect. south norwalk, ct cook

I loved this recipe! I grew up on Long Island, and have many wonderful summer memories of incredible, home made linguine and clam sauce. Living now in Seattle, I found some beautiful local, small clams, and it brought home right back to me. It's wonderful with a big green salad and fresh, warm Italian bread.

This was very good! I doubled everything but the dried hot red pepper flakes and I also substitued the cockles for a can of whole clams, small can of oysters both drained and 4 fresh calamari(sliced into rings). It was absolutely delicious!!

Very good! I used canned clams instead and it was just delicious. One could probably go a little lighter on the olive oil, but I'm not opposed to plenty of it.

Basics are good however canned baby clams are neccessary and u can also add some chicken stock. Control liquid volume to prefernce and add pasta in sauce prior to al dente and toss as the starch will aid in thickening your sauce and also sheen the sauce. Another addition at the last minute shoulbe a pinch of lemon zest to taste. Top with xtra vrigin olive oil and all is perfect. TIP: lil neck clams steam off in batches just till open then freeze off cooked for future use. U can also strain juice and use or freeze. Just add to sauce frozen or drop in pasta water 1 minute before garnishing dish. Saves trips to the Fish Market.

I agree with many others reviews here. I used little necks instead of cockles, and also added two cans of baby clams. I like the baby clams better than the chopped clams. The only criticisms I have are the lack of liquid (You can add 3-4x what the recipe calls for). I feel that white clam sauce should be pretty liquidy. Also, you can tone back the red pepper a bit. I like spicy food, but don't feel like this should be spicy. A bit of red pepper is a nice touch, but the recipe calls for a bit too much.

Quick, easy and very good. We didn't have cockles, so we used 1 lb of little neck clams and 2 small cans of minced clams. By reading reviews, we didn't think there'd be enough sauce, so we used 12 oz clam juice, 1 cup of white wine, plus the clam juice from the cans of minced clams. There was enough sauce to coat the pasta with a little extra for dipping. The red pepper flakes were a nice touch.

Simply wonderful. Made this dish on valentines day for my boyfriend - we both loved it! I not only added small clams, but also added calamari, lobster tail, and shrimp. A beautiful dinner, and not much work! I also found that about 1 and a half bottles of clam juice and equal parts wine helped this be enough sauce for 1 lb. of linguine! YUMMMMY! :)

Only change I made was substitution of white dry French vermouth for the wine. I found the quantity of sauce sufficient -- no sauce swimming under the plated pasta, but from my experience in good Italian restaurants that is normal for this particular dish.

I think this is a fantastic recipe. I can't really say it's WHITE clam sauce, but it's not red, for sure. I actually preferred it without the milk or cream that is generally used, and it wasn't as heavy, though I think 1/3 cup of olive oil is a little too much. Great with red pepper flakes and lots of clams.

Ok I really had to change this up... sorry, but when I think of white sauce, clear doesn't go in the same category. I made a roux with 2 tbs butter, minced onion & garlic, 2 tbs flour and then added 1c milk and 1c clam juice for the sauce. Separately I sauted some mushrooms with the red pepper flakes (careful! they can make it pretty spicy!) in butter with onion & garlic until the mushrooms evaporated all their juice. I used manilla clams, opened them in some simmering water, white wine & butter and threw them slightly strained on top of the pasta just before pouring the mushrooms & sauce on top. Lots of pans, yes, but it still all came together quickly with minimal prep and tasted fantastic. Add a little parmesean-reggiano and juilliened fresh basil if you want an extra punch of flavor.

I agree with doubling the ingredients for the sauce. My trick for thickening is adding a can of condensed Cream of Shrimp soup. It's a great secret!

Well it was good...I didn't follow the recipe exactly as I didn't have it on hand....but it was successful....to me it was light and tasty with a little kick from the pepper flakes....I'd do it again.

The recipe with modifications worked well. I used one cup of clam juice, two dozen little necks and a can of minced clams, mostly drained. I cut the pepper flakes back to 1/2 tsp and that seemed to still be too spicy for some. I suggest using 1 tbs. of the butter and 1 tbs of flour to make a roux to use to thicken the sauce. It coats the pasta better. If too thick, simply add more white wine. Also made the linquini. Will definitely make this again.

I used double the wine & clam juice & it still did not have enough sauce. I added a bit more garlic, less red pepper & oregano. The taste was absolutely delicious but next time I will triple the wine & clam juice. Easy to make.

WOW, this was great and very fast and easy. Believe me, we are all fussy eaters, and we all loved it. I added 1 tsp minced fresh thyme, used 1/2 tsp dried oregano, and reduced the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. I used 2 cans minced clams and used their juice [ran out of clam juice]. I added the clams when there was about 3 min cooking time left. I will add this to my regular rotation. Next time I'll reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup, but those of you who dip bread will like this as is.

I thought this was terrible. Not enough sauce for the pasta. Although the recipe said to reduce the sauce ingredients for three minutes, I certainly didn't follow that step or there would have been no sauce at all. One pound of pasta to 2/3 cup of liquid?? I don't think so!!

Yum!! I really liked this recipie. I used canned chopped clams and it still tasted good. I squeezed 1/2 a lemon to the sauce and lemon slices in the end with the parsley as a garnish. I also put more red pepper (3/4 tablespoon) on accident, but I loved the extra kick.

Delicious and a true classic recipe. In addition to little neck clams I added chicken and garlic sausage. I sliced 1/2 lb sausage and sauteed first and removed (and added the sausage back along with the clams). I quadrupled (really) the sauce for bread dipping. To add flavor to the sauce I added a teaspoon full of "Better than Bullion" chicken flavor -- although they now make clam flavor -- which would work just as well. This was as good as served in most high-end restaurants. Enjoy!

This was easily the best linguini with clam sauce I've ever tasted. Here in the land-locked midwest cockels are impossible to come by so I just used good quality canned chopped clams and a whole 8 oz bottle of clam juice. The dish was extremely flavorful. Next time I'll back off on the pepper flakes a bit as my husband found it a bit too spicy hot for his taste. Personally, I liked it. I highly recommend this recipe - I think the onions give this a big flavor boost and it's oh-so-simple to make.

This recipe was PACKED with flavor, so it's hard to believe some found it bland!? And I like lots of flavor, myself. Thought the sauce was perfect. . but I can see why some may want to add the whole bottle of clam juice in, although it's not necessary for moisture. Delicious.

i thought it was delicious but next time i would make the sauce in 2 phases. in the 1st phase i would add 1 dozen clams to the broth and once they opened i would take them out, chop them then add them back to the sauce. then i would add the rest of the clams. i did not even have too add the butter for those looking to save calories!

This dish receives a resounding So-So vote. I found it to be lacking in spice and in flavor in general. When I make a linguine vongole again, I'll look for another recipe.

I thought this was a great dish. I did add the entire bottle (8 oz) of clam juice - why throw it away especially since I like "soupy" sauce. Additionally I added a small can of chopped clams and its broth. I loved the onions in the sauce. Just as an FYI - I ended up preparing the sauce up to the point where you add the clams but my husband ended up stuck on a business call for a couple of hours. I just refrigerated the sauce and the next day brought it to a simmer and added the clams. Excellent.
