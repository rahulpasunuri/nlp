This is almost exactly how I make salsa. I like mine hotter, so I finely mince a quarter onion, and add a clove or three of garlic depending on volume, pressed with a Zyliss. A pinch of sugar and a glug of olive oil to keep the onion and garlic from standing out too much, and sometimes a little tomato paste to thicken. Perfect! (for me and mine anyways). I haven't bought salsa since I started making it this way, years ago.

This salsa is wonderful; I like spicy so I added a bit more of the chipotle peppers than it called for and also added freshly chopped onion. The addition of the onion made the salsa more rich and tasty in my opinion. This recipe establishes a perfect combination of smoky and spicy and fresh flavors - it is great and I definately recommend trying it! You won't be dissapointed!

This is an incredibly easy recipe, and it tastes great. The chipotle peppers have the perfect blend of heat and flavor.

I don't know what all the fuss is about. If you have to modify this recipe, as so many other reviewers have, what's the point? Look for a better salsa recipe elsewhere, this is just so-so, and I made it both ways; blended and fresh chopped. Not worth the quality ingredients used.

The mango suggestion is a great one, a bit of red onion also peps it up...

Added some chopped mango to it and it was great

The canned chipotle chili made the salsa too smoky for my taste. I prefer a more traditional fresh salsa.

Perfect. Smoky & fresh at the same time. Note that it (like most fresh-tomato salsa) really doesn't keep well at all, so don't make it ahead of time. Also, good tomatoes are critical.

This is everything salsa should be: tangy and spicy with just the right amount of herbal cilantro notes and a hint of earthy smoke. It's good enough to make me swear off store-bought salsa forever. I assigned this to a member of our dinner club along with Pork Picadillo Empanadas, which was a great combination. Fortunately she didn't take the leftovers home, so I've been able to enjoy it over the last couple days with everything that I can possibly dip into it! A real winner that I'll make on my own again and again.

This was very fresh and colorful. I added some fresh-from-the-garden chopped jalapeno peppers, what a zip! I also doubled the chipotle peppers and poured some of the adobo sauce right into the salsa mixture. I served this by toasting small baguette rounds, then spread a generous amount of cream cheese on top and toasted again until cream cheese was slightly browned. I then topped each round with the salsa. A beautiful presentation, and VERY VERY VERY delicious!

Made this for a party and everyone LOVED it! I served it with the homemade Chili-Lime Tortilla Triangles (in Epicurious recipe database) and together they were a big hit. You can adjust the heat and smoky flavor by adding more or less of the chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Best served at room temperature.

Very good. I like mine hot so I use 7 or 8 whole chipotle peppers. I also use a blender so it's more smooth. Yum.

We've modified this slightly (can't tell you how), and gotten rave reviews from everyone who's tried it. People always ask us to bring this salsa to parties and buffets. The best salsa I've ever eaten. If only I knew how to can it...

Great dip people at work LOVED it! It is also great with cream cheese.

Very easy to make and was a great garnish for empanadas. Use the freshest tomatoes available for the best taste.
