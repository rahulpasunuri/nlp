Made this as an appetizer for a dinner party and it was a big hit. We love tomatoes, so I used two cans of Italian diced tomatoes with juice instead of the tomato sauce. Also added some roasted butternut squash that I had on hand. I ended up with well over 8 cups. The left overs were gently heated and served on pasta. We loved all the flavors - it seemed perfectly balanced and flavorful.

Very good but I would up the fennel (the flavor gets drowned) and the raisin and cut the tomato sauce just a touch next time. I think that would really brighten the flavor.

I made this recipe for a tapas party and it went over very well. I followed the instructions, and would do the same if I made it again. Which I will!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! It makes a lot, though, or we would have eaten all of it the first day. I had caponata years ago that someone had made and thought it was absolutely delicious. I wasn't able to get the recipe, but this one looked very similar and I was not disappointed! It was pretty easy to prepare, too - just some chopping to do first. Great veggie appetizer/snack! This would be great to serve at a party.

I think the tomato sauce in this recipe is overwhelming. I would add more raisins and less tomato next time.

My husband and I "sell" a dinner each year for an Italian charity auction. We have served this caponata 2 years in a row to rave reviews. It's great as is, but try adding a dash of hot red pepper flakes for an added boost of flavor. It is also a breeze to prepare!

Excellent! Blast of taste with every bite. I made this for a party and it gained rave reviews. Much better the second or third day though.

This was fabulous. Just using what I had in the kitchen, I made some substitutes - regular raisins for the golden ones; balsalmic vinegar for the red wine vinegar; and unfortunately no fennel. It was still fantastic, people still asked for the recipe. I think the balsalmic added to the rasin sweetness. Even better after it's beenin the fridge for a few days!

Very nice combination of flavors, with a distinct sweetness as well.
