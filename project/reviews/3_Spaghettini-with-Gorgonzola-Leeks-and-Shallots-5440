I forgot to add to my review that I also added 1 cup of white wine and a little butter to the olive oil, plus added blue cheese to top of spaghetti so it melted in to dish. Excellente!

I loved this dish. I improvised and added garlic, red pepper,mushrooms and chopped turkey and served over buttered spaghetti. Delicious!!!

I liked this dish. It's definitely not a show-stopper, but I agree that it is just the thing for a simple, comforting meal with a glass of white wine, and maybe a bowl of some carrot soup. @ hillraven - your negative review cracked me up - how could you have bothered with this recipe if you don't love onions? The ingredients are almost nothing but different types of onions!

The ingredients sounded good, but it was horrible. The only part with flavor was the cheese and it wasn't enough to keep eating. Definitely never making again. If you really love the taste of onions and more onions this is for you, if not I recommend a pass...

Great basic recipe -- easy to make. I substituted a soft truffle cheese for the gorgonzola -- it was delicious.

I enjoyed the unusual and subtle sweet flavors of this dish. Like another reviewer, I sauteed a couple of cloves of garlic before adding the shallots and leeks. I also added some basil and some white wine to the pan. When tossing the pasta and vegetables, I added a small amount of half and half. I also squeezed a wedge of lemon on each bowl, and served the pasta with parmesan reggiano to taste. I think these additions helped heighten and blend the flavors.

Not bad, but not great. Had a strong onion taste, but the cheese was quite subtle, even hard to notice which makes me wonder if such an expensive ingredient should be used. I also think that the ratio of vegetable material to the cheese might be out of whack. I saved the meal with a nice Chardonnay and asparagus side dish. I will probably not make this again as described, but find a better use for the rest of the gorgonzola.

This is a really good simple recipe, the kind of thing to make on a week night when all you want is a good meal and a glass of wine. I added a little garlic (but then I almost always do) and served it with a green salad.

I didn't like it at all. Didn't eat it. Threw it away. Awful use of really good ingredients. And the money that went down the drain!

I made 1/3 of this recipe and it made 2 generous side servings. Since Hubby & I love all kinds of onions, cheese, and pasta, I had to give this 4 forks. Next time I may try adding some chopped Anaheim chile pepper to the mix. Served it with "Oven Fried Chicken II" (allrecipes.com), and a green salad. Twas a meal to die for!!!

It's just an OK dish to fix for dinner when you come home tired from work. Tastes OK and is healthy enough. Nothing to rave about though and not to be served for guests.

I thought this was a great recipe. I served it as a side dish with steak and it was delicious.

Not so sure what all the hype is about. This was an okay sidedish. Wouldn't make it for a main course. Very rich and looked somewhat plain. It was good but not a favorite.

I made this as a first course and everyone wanted more. They all rated it "4 forks". I would definitely make it again.

Though the flavor is delicious, you're looking at a plate of plain white spaghetti. Martha Stewart has a pasta recipe that reminds me of this dish, but which I think is superior. In addition to the Gorgonzola, she adds vegetables which gives the dish more interest (and more nutrition). It's called "Pasta w/Swiss Chard, Eggplant and Mushrooms". She uses orecchiette pasta, but you could use almost anything. The recipe is in one of her Quick Cook books.

The onion/leek/shallot mixture was delicious. The gorgonzola didn't melt with the past the way I would've hoped, I had cheese chunks in the pasta. It was delicious, reheated well in the microwave at work, too!

We really liked it. It was easy and quick. The 4 different onions gave it a good flavor. I used 4 oz. of Gorgonzola for 1/2 lb. of the pasta.

Delicious! We've made it many times. We have never found it to be bland although on the first and all subsequent times that we made it we increased the amount of onions and shallots by about 50%.

We found this recipe somewhat bland (in spite of the very rich gorgonzola). If I were to make it again, I'd probably add something (maybe capers) to give it a little more "bite."
