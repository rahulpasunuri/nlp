I make this chicken at least twice a month. It is so easy and delicious! I have never made the carrots and never missed them, although I'm sure they are great too. Even my kids love this chicken.

This was delicious and easy. The only thing I would do differently next time is add at least one extra onion. They were the best part!

Really delicious. The chicken cooked beautifully, and turned out moist and juicy; this is definitely one I'll make again. I marinated for about four hours, and rotated the chicken about once an hour to make sure it was nicely coated. Serve it with the recommended cumin carrots and basmati rice - topped with the onions - for an easy, complete dinner.

Definitely a keeper. Will make again. Used boneless, skinless chicken breast. Left the marinade hanging thick on the chicken during roasting, so I did not throw out any marinade. Make sure you serve the onion with the chicken, they turn out wonderful.

Really simple with great flavour. I will make this again with just chicken breasts since I like white meat, but that's the only change I would make.

I made this as part of a menu suggested in the Menu section of this site, called "Kid Friendly Chicken Masala." I was looking under the categories of (guess!) "quick and easy" and "kid-friendly." The adults in the family found it quite tasty, and the almost-3-yr-old did not complain and ate all of the components. It is not a serious Indian food recipe, the flavors are more subdued, but that's probably what makes it a child-pleaser, and it still tastes plenty good. I used chicken thighs and drumsticks instead of a cut-up whole chicken, and I wasn't able to marinate for longer than one hour, but I would definitely do that next time, I'm sure it's even better. The menu suggested some cumin-roasted carrots and a cucumber raita (yogurt sauce), both which were simple and quick to make, and my son got to help a lot with the raita. The whole thing was simple, just do plan ahead to give the chicken at least 2 hours marinating. I served some steamed basmati rice with it all--definitely saving this menu.

Best part of this dish is that everyone loves it yet it is so simple to put together. A definite staple to have in any cooks daily arsenal. The chicken is so tender and moist thanks to the marinade and slow cook method. Leftovers a day later taste better than the 1st.

Super easy dish that delivered pretty good flavor, but not spicy enough for me. I should know garam masala doesn't have enough'kick'for my taste, so next time will add some cayenne or another type of chili. I used Fage greek yogurt and boneless chicken breast. I marinated overnight. Baked about 30 mins. Will definitely make again.

I'm usually generous with my ratings. This was fair at best. The marinade gave the chicken a strange texture (I used very high quality chicken). It's a simple recipe so I can't imagine what could have caused the poor result.

If I could give this five stars I would, I could not believe how good this was!! The marinade is fabulous and the result is similar to Tandoori chicken. This is in the shortlist of the best recipes I've ever made from Epicurious. Made this with 0% Fage yogurt and used chicken breasts, the rest exactly as written. Marinaded overnight. So healthy, so easy to make, so cheap, and also a dream sandwich filler with some mango chutney... next time will be doubling the recipe for lunch leftovers!

Love this recipe! I used chicken breasts and nixed the onions altogether. Instead I used the curried couscous and zucchini raita from this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Grilled-Lamb-Chops-with-Curried-Couscous-and-Zucchini-Raita-234654 I also added more garam masala and garlic to the marinade as others did. Cooked on the bottom rack for just under an hour. Also added raisins to the couscous at the end. The cooling effect of the raita served with the chicken is like fire&ice. DELICIOUS!

Thought this was great! Made it first time, exactly as written (except I skinned the chicken). Second time I made it, I used more garlic, and more garam masala. Marinated it for 8 hours, flavors were so much more intense! This makes the whole house smell wonderful! Family gave it rave reviews!

I love this recipe! It's going to be our family Christmas recipe now rather than making turkey. My kids, 7 & 5, ate it like crazy. It is so warm and cozy and smells amazing while it cooks. It also freezes well - in the marinade, before cooking - so you can pull it out, thaw it and bake it up. Wonderful!

Rating: 4
So awesome! Amazingly easy! Used 4 chicken leg and thigh quarters on sale at local grocery store 1 container (about 6oz) of nonfat Greek (much thicker and more protein) used instead - not tangy or yogurty and picky boyfriend safe. A couple of extra garlic cloves thrown in for good measure. Marinated only an hour so but flavor wasn't lacking by any means. Served over Indian spiced multi-grain microwavable rice from TraderJoe's which was perfect with this dish for company and over simple white rice for picky boyfriend. Spooned onion-y juices onto the rice. Very, very good.

I've made this recipe a few times, and I have had the best luck with putting the tray lower in the oven. When I had it high in the oven, the chicken skin burned. We love this recipe. I used nonfat yogurt and it worked great. Definitely going into regular rotation.

Made these exactly as the recipe stated and they turned out delicious. I marinated them over night and think they turned out even better because of this. Will try them next time with chicken tenders or chicken breasts since we rarely have bone-in chicken. I expect the leftovers to make excellent sandwiches on naan flatbread.

Scratch my last comment. The tagline with the image is confusing if you didn't find the recipe as part of a whole menu. I actually made this but adapted by using parts of a recipe from Savorspiceshop.com to add flavor. Very tasty. Here's their recipe http://www.savoryspiceshop.com/recipes/tikkamas.html I only used Faje nonfat yogurt, added tomato paste, lemon and tsp of honey. Added fingerling potatoes instead of serving with rice or naan.

Great recipe. I don't know if it is the best masala recipe, but it makes a really easy, tasty dinner nonetheless.

I prepared as written, using Libertee Organic plain yoghurt, skin on and bone in chicken thighs, and increased garam masala to 4 tsp. Marinated a few hours. Cooked convection 400 to start, but saw skin starting to char - kept 400 but no convection for the remaining time - approx 40min in total. Everyone liked it! Flavour permeated meat and was great - next time increase garam masala a bit more and marinate longer. Also, try skinning a few thighs before marinating to see if this also works. Very simple to make.

Everybody ( even my picky son) ate every bit of it, it was pretty easy and I'm not a professional chef,but the flavors are great! Hubby wants this again! That makes this a super meal. With Mushroom/garlic rice, super family meal. next time with the carrots.

I've made probably 40 recipes from Epicurious and this is definitely one of my favorites. I basically followed the recipe exactly, only exception is that I only used dark meat (drumsticks/thighs) and i sprinkled just a little bit of extra garam masala, salt and a pinch of cayenne pepper on the top right before putting it in the oven. It had so much flavor, the skin was really crispy and it was DELICIOUS! This is an absolute keeper!

I love this recipe! It's incredibly easy and flavorful; definitely my go-to Indian recipe on a weeknight. I always substitute fat-free Greek yogurt and make sure I marinate the chicken for at least 24 hours. Delicious!

Delicious and super easy! I used the boneless, skinless chicken breasts I had on hand. Cut into strips, marinated and then thread onto skewers. Cooking time was about half. Served it simply with the cumin carrots and basmati rice. I'm thinking of doing bite sized skewers with some kind of chutney/yogurt dip as appetizers for a party.

My husband and I really enjoy this recipe; it has become a favorite of ours. I use McCormick Gourmet Collections Garam Masala, liberal amounts of cayenne for heat, vanilla flavored low fat yogurt. I skip the cilantro and use cut up chicken breasts. Great flavor and the chicken is very tender.

Ok . . . so don't get too lazy with this one. I threw everything in a pyrex last night to "marinate" and then got lazy today and just threw the chopped onions on top of the pyrex and threw it in the oven. Um, gross stuff happens when you bake yogurt, apparently! All the solids separate from the liquid, congeal around the chicken, and the yellowish liquid boils and looks gross. So, yeah. Still tasted ok (after draining away the yellowish liquid). Not sure I'll make this one again the proper way. But the cumin carrots? They're a keeper and super easy!

Holy cow, was this good! I am a huge Indian food fan, but can never seem to get things to taste as good at home as at the restaurants. This was restaurant-good and pretty darn easy. I used plain non fat yogurt as I had some, I am sure it would be richer with the recommended whole milk, but it was really good with the non fat. As a side I made the cumin roasted carrots and some brown basmati rice - all together gave us two days of excellent leftovers for lunch (didn't do the wraps as the issue suggested).

3.5 forks. Just wonderful. During dinner, my husband voted this one of the top-ten dishes I've ever made. This is now in the regular rotation. The marinade works especially well on smaller, dark-meat pieces, where the spices have a chance to infuse all of the meat, so tonight I'm trying it with only bone-in, skin-on thighs. I also was only able to marinade it for the minimum suggested time, and it was great. The first time I made it I had to mix up my own garam masala and used sour cream instead of plain yogurt, and it turned out just fine.

This is so easy and can be made the night before and great for casual dinner party. In Bon Appetit this recipe was listed with cumin roasted carrots and a cool cucumber raita. The chicken is good on its own, but serving all 3 together looks impressive, tates delicious and is sooo easy. I also serve with jasmine rice.

Rating: 4
Flavor was perfect and soaked completely to the bone. I marinated this dish for 24 hours, which may have made the difference. I doubled the garam masala according to other reviewers. Used a cut up whole chicken, and pureed them marinade to make sure all the flavors where released. I had to cook about 10 min longer than suggested, but this could have been my oven's doings. The onions roasted nicely under the chicken and just seemed to melt in your mouth. Definitely will make this many more times. I made cumin roasted carrots that where suggested by another person but I would have been much happier with plain old roasted carrots. Cumin carrots didn't do it for me and seemed to be more work than they where worth. You can't go wrong with this one. Oh yeah my chicken wasn't a pretty as the pictures posted. Mine turned out more of a blackish color most likely due to me pureeing the marinade but I wouldn't have changed a thing, except roasted carrots next time.

Excellent! Just made it for a dinner party. Easy - fast - and tastes very authentic. Instead of using a whole chicken, I used 3 chicken breasts and 4 thighs increasing the ingredients a bit. It did, however, take longer than 1 hour to cook - maybe 1 hour 15 minutes. To get a nice brown color, I ended it with in on broil for 5 minutes.

My chicken did not look like this at all (wasn't brown but then again I used skinless chicken tenders). I made 3 lbs of chicken for five of us and we finished it all without a problem! It wasn't too spicy at all. I made the roast carrots as an accompaniment but they were rather plain.

Made this as per recipe. Took 37 minutes at 400 in my convection oven. Chicken came out moist with a nice crispy skin but unfortunately, lacked any real flavor - next time will need to increase spice or add an different assortment. Made the carrots as a second thought and so glad I did - for us, they were the star of the show.

Make this! So easy, delicious, and inexpensive! The marinade comes together in 5 minues, and just leave it to marinate until ready to roast. It was a hit. The only thing I changed is: roasted for 1 hr exactly, I turned the chicken pieces over at about 45 minutes so they would crisp on the other side for 10 minutes,turned them back over for the last 5 mins. Next time I'll double the garlic and add 1 tsp. a cayenne pepper for a bit of a kick.

Let me start by saying, "My Husband ate this! He even enjoyed it." Baby steps folks... I used greek yogurt and had no issues with the texture of the sauce coming out of the oven. I also did a grind of aleppo pepper before serving to add some kick. I purchased the masala spice from a local eastern market and found that it was not overpowering.This went well with the cumin roasted carrots. This is a perfect way to hint at Indian cooking. I would add more garlic and aleppo next time.

Ooo- this was tasty! I marinated the chicken 6 hours (with doubled garlic, as suggested) and allowed a lot of the marinade to stay on the chicken for baking. It was very tender, flavorful and juicy.

After reading reviews, I added about a half more spices, as I know I enjoy spice. Marinate as long as you can as it will improve the flavor. I didn't have any problems with the marinade after cooking. However, instead of a whole chicken, I did 1.5 inch cubes of chicken thighs and reduced cooking time by 15 minutes - came out flavorful and juicy. Made the carrots and raita too and enjoyed the entire meal.

This was an easy weeknight dinner. I agree with other reviewers about the exceptionally mild taste - my picky 7 year old loved it, but I thought it could use more. The flavors really do come together over the whole dish though. I recommend marinating as listed - at least 6 hours or overnight. The yogurt needs time to break down the outer layer of meat.

It is serendipitous to find you have everything in the house to make a quick, easy dinner. I barely got 2 hours marinating time, though, and overnight may be ideal. I slathered the marinade on the chicken on the baking sheet and had absolutely no problem with flavor or texture. Chicken was juicy and browned. Have to watch the cumin carrots so they don't scorch on bottom. Raita is so good alongside, but I only use a pinch of salt, added radishes too. Served with Brown Jasmine rice I had onhand. Will make again, it's a nobrainer.

My family loved this whole menu. I didn't have any problems with the marinade ending up thick in places. I did bake it with convection, so I don't know if that makes the difference.

Although reasonably tasty, this dish is missing a key ingredient to any good chicken masala...tomato. I believe this dish is mislabeled as it is a version of Chicken Tikka rather than a traditional Masala. It's still tasty, but if you're looking for a masala, there's a second set of steps to turn the Chicken Tikka into Chicken Tikka Masala.

Delicious, but very mild. If you're looking for something very spicy or strongly flavored, maybe this isn't it. My 2 year old (who is a VERY adventurous eater, to be fair) loved this. Even still, my husband and I thought it was delicious. If you can throw the chicken into the marinade the night before, it makes this a fantastically easy weeknight dinner. I do understand what another reviewer was talking about with the texture of the marinade. In some places where the sauce was still thick on the surface of the chicken, it can have a weird texture. In places where the chicken was nicely browned, that wasn't a problem. Mostly on the undersides of the chicken.

Rating: 2
Followed recipe except using only chicken breasts. Too mild (yes, it's a family recipe, but still...), unpleasant chalky texture to the marinade on the surface of the chicken. Basic method is fine for a low-fuss meal. Would 1) round out the flavor profile - even for a mild curry, some cumin, some coriander, etc would help, 2) smack the chicken flatter to maximize exposure to the marinade, and 3) aggressively flick off the marinade to get rid of gritty texture. 2 stars for easy low-fuss, and because "only barely seasoned" may float other people's curry boats.
