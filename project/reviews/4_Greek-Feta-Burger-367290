Made it for my boyfriend, who loves gyros. It was great! I went heavy on the spices, and I used turkey instead of beef and Italian blend herbs instead of marjoram. I also made a "salsa" of tomatoes, the roasted red pepper, and cucumber. The "burger" was delicious and the sauce was really good.

I made these burgers last night and, while they weren't terrible, they didn't really have any flavor. I threw in extra salt, pepper, and marjoram in the burger, and used about double the amount of garlic for the yogurt sauce. I don't think I'll make them again, but would definitely recommend using a heavy hand with the spices if you choose to. The yogurt sauce was actually pretty good.

The 1st time I made this recipe I accidentally doubled the lemon juice in the yogurt sauce--the sauce was too sour, but the burger portion of the recipe was EXCELLENT. Last night I made the sauce and burger as written, deleted any optional romaine or cucumber slices, and ALL was excellent. Both times I subbed cucumber for zucchini in the burger, since I was not about to buy a whole zucchini to use 2 oz. of it, diced. (I also halved the recipe each time, and used small ciabatta rolls.) DO TRY THIS!!! DELICIOUS.

This "burger is great! I was craving a gyros when I found this recipe - this was soooo much better. I too agree that using ground lamb would be a great substitute.

Try using ground lamb instead of beef. If you like that sort of thing.
