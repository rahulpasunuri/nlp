I've made these 4-5x now and they've gotten better with a few changes. Taking other reviewers suggestions to "de-point" the edges I trimmed the wrappers with a wineglass as a guide and also stacked them after oiling so both sides got a little oil, which I think made them crisper. Briefly straining the shrimp mixture stopped the drips.

The shrimp salad is amazing! Agree with reviewers to use a little more curry paste and chutney and less lime juice and mayo, but any way, it's really delicious. The wonton cups however, I wasn't crazy about. I took the reviewer's advice to cut the wonton wrapper in rounds to avoid pointed and painful-to-eat cups, and that worked great, but thought they tasted bland. Will stick to making just the salad...

These appetizers always get rave reviews. Like other reviewers, I double up on the purchased Major Grey's Chutney, and the curry paste, and cut down on the lime juice. I drain the salad a bit before spooning into purchased phyllo cups, which I prefer to the wonton cups. They are truly bite-size, and they never last long enough to worry about the salad soaking through the phyllo dough!

Rating: 0
We love these! However, I definitely double up on the curry paste and the mano chutney and then cut down a little on the lime juice. I've served these many times and have never had anyone complain about the wonton crisps, but I'm sure phyllo cups would work well too. Taking them, by request, to the Big Game Party this weekend!

I make this when I give large parties. I take a juice glass as a template, stack the wonton sheets and cut them into a circle. This alleviates the pointy edges and difficult bite that the previous reader complained about. Then, press each circle into mini-muffin tin. The edges should be even with the top of the pan. These can be made several days in advance and stored in a zip-lock.

Shrimp filling - outstanding. Putting in wonton cups as a "one biter" - ridiculous! The wonton cups are cute, but they are crunchy and they are NOT one bite. The filling is a bit sloppy. Once you bite thru the wonton cup (if you can without stabbing the roof of your mouth) the dressing will run out and on to you. Luckily I was making everything for the next day so I had time to figure out different "vehicle". I ended up using puff pastry. Cut squares, folded over the edge to form center area. The filling itself was truly great and I added a little extra of both the curry paste and the mango chutney. I see previous reviewer tried phyllo which I was thinking would form the little cups, making a pretty presentation and could just maybe be "one bite" since phyllo is so tender, but I didn't have any on hand. The puff pastry squares were nice with it, but still two bites. I will definitely make the filling again, and again and again but I will never consider making "wonton cups" EVER again - wontons are for filling and frying.

This is the second time I made this recipe. They're all gone within the second and guests asked for recipe! First time I made with phyllo dough (3~4 layers), this time I tried with wonton wrap, way easier and taste good!

This is a great "go-to" cocktail party recipe. I didn't have any green curry paste on hand so I used a dash of curry powder. It didn't have the same heat but was delicious nonetheless. I also added a dash of coconut milk from a can that was open. I also sauteed the shrimp in sesame oil with garlic and ginger, which gave it another layer of flavor. One of the guests at the party was deathly allergic to shrimp so I made a version with chicken that was just as delicious. The one thing that puzzles me about this recipe is the instruction to cut the wonton wrapper in fourths. The pieces are so tiny and can't really make proper size cups.

Rating: 4
Made these for my 23rd birthday party and everyone loved them. Something went wrong with the wonton cups as their texture was a bit off, but the filling was outstanding. I was definitely very liberal with the chutney/curry paste as I like full flavors/spice. Will definitely make again someday, maybe sooner per the other review that suggests topping a salad with the filling!

Rating: 4
Great recipe. did it twice. first time I bought pre-cooked shrimp and drained the extra water before serving. Second time I boiled the shrimp with a little hot sauce in the water. Second time didn't have any extra water in the sauce. Up it to 3x the chutney and thai green curry paste. Also added 1/2 tsp chili sauce (or chili oil).

Rating: 4
Sometimes I omit the wonton cups and use cucumber rounds instead. I slice a hothouse cucumber a little thick, scoop it out with a melon baller and add the shrimp topping. I'm going to experiment with the chutney/curry paste portions per other reviewers. I also add green onions to this. Love it.

Just wrote the review, and got a craving for this- had some frozen cooked shrimp, so made the dressing, (cut down the proportions by 1/2) then tossed in some whole shrimp. Good on a bed of lettuce for a salad!

Rating: 4
Made this twice now, first time with the wontons, second time with the phyllo cups. Phyllo cups are much easier, and don't cut your mouth! These are a great make ahead appetizer, and also a good one to take to a party - just make the salad and as long as your host doesn't mind you quickly assembling them in their kitchen, you can just spoon the salad into the cups and serve. These were a big hit at a NYE party I attended this year. I am a little generous with the green curry paste, but the recipe as is has a nice little kick. Definitely a keeper!

Rating: 4
Outstanding flavor and easy to do. I did modify it to give it more kick. 3x the chutney and thai green curry paste. Also added 1/2 tsp chili sauce (or chili oil). For the wontons, I used a round cookie cutter so they were more bite size. Will do this again.

Rating: 4
Just want to give my thumbs up for this one too. Nice item to take to a party. I followed suggestions and used 2-3x's the curry paste and 2-3x's the chutney. Put them in filo cups (Greek-Thai fusion?) and served them up. A nice kick but no complaints from the guests. In fact, they went quite fast.

Rating: 4
I have made these a few times, and each time they get better. I double the amount of chutney and curry paste and halve the mayo. I also add chopped green onion and celery per some earlier reviewers' recommendations. To avoid sharp corners on the cups, cut the corners off of the wonton wrappers (making them octagonal) before shaping and baking.

Rating: 3
I prefer serving these in endive spears. I reduced the mayo to 2 Tbl, increased chutney to 4 tsp, and used 1 lb shrimp that I poached in 2 c water with 1 juiced lemon, peppercorns, salt, a pinch of sugar, and some parsley leaves.

Rating: 4
Excellent and so easy! Followed the suggestions and used phyllo cups and reduced the amount of mayonnaise. It makes a very nice presentation.

Rating: 3
The cups were too big and lacked flavor, so I cut them in smaller cirles using a small glass, then brushed them with sesame oil and sprinkled the oiled side with some wasabi pepper and salt I found at the asian market, what a fantastic difference it made, so now you have a cup with fantasic flavor that complements the filling. For the filling I used half the mayo to 1 lb. of shrimp, then added some fresh lemongrass, ginger, green onions and a little garlic chili sauce. Amazing taste. If you can't find the wasabi pepper and salt I think any nice not too overpowering asian spice blend would work, but the mix I found has cumin and cinammon in it as well and really adds a nice low key zing, can probably be found at any asian market. Couldn't keep them on the plate fast enough.

I've made this several times and it's always a crowd pleaser. I follow the recipe, except add more curry paste. The first couple of times I made the wonton cups, this last time, I cut the wontons into triangles and fried to make chips. This worked out very nicely.

Rating: 3
I made a few changes to this recipe since I thought it lacked character. I only used about a tablespoon of mayo, increased the amount of chutney and added ginger, following a suggestion that I read. I also used phyllo cups instead. They came out very nice and everybody loved them. Will make them again with the changes.

Rating: 3
Although people seemed to enjoy these I would make a few changes if I make them again. I would increase the shrimp to a 1 pound and drastically reduce the amount of mayo (this time I used light mayo), perhaps omitting it altogether. As suggested in some other reviews I would mix the sauce well ahead to let meld. I felt it needed a little kick so I added a little chili oil. No injuries were reported from the wonton corners. I also will try adding some fresh ginger. Unless you really love mayo consider cutting it.

Rating: 4
I make this dish several times per year and it is always a big hit. I usually make at least the sauce a day ahead to let the green curry paste meld. Then if I need to add more later I can. As far as the pointy wonton cups, I use the round wonton cups and then that isn't a problem. Plus, you don't need to cut or shape at all just use them straight from the package.

I can't eat shrimp, but hate to deny everyone else! I Made this as an hors d'oeuvre for a formal dinner party the other evening. I amde it exactly to the recipe except used the phyllo cups.

My thanks to Got2Cook1 from Maryland. I took your advice and added chopped celery to the shrimp salad for a bit of a crunch, and chose not to make the wonton cups which sound, frankly, dangerous. I had been thinking of using the mini phyllo cups instead, so was pleased to see that others had done the same with good results. With these adjustments this appetizer turned out beautifully and got rave reviews!

Rating: 4
I'm guessing on the shrimp part...but I've experimented extensively with the baked wonton part of this recipe. I tried no oil, butter and olive oil (spray). The spray was the winner. I tried using the whole wonton skin (as the recipe suggested), trimming into circles with a cookie cutter, cutting in half diagonally and putting in muffin-tin to make a wee spoon...but the BEST was cutting in half diagonally and baking flat like a tortilla chip. When made into cups, they did not acheive the right crunch--too hard. But flat, they looked beautiful, were perfectly crisp without drawing blood from the roof of your mouth, and could be dispayed with a dollop of the shrimp stuff in the middle. ......Then, I tried the flat method with sprinked thai spiced peanuts (trader joes) that I ground into almost a powder. YUM! I gave the little devils a quick spray, then sprinkled, then another quick spray. Voila, Asian wonton chips (...and baked!). When I do make the shrimp part, I plan to do it more like Thai scampi...yes to curry paste....no to mayo.

The filling is great. I added chopped celery and green onions to add texture. The wonton cups are like weapons and cut the inside of my mouth. They are too much for this shrimp salad. I used the phyllo cups, which were much easier and a better fit for this salad.

This was so yummy and very easy! The only small complaint was my finace found that the wonton cups stabbed his mouth.

Delicious and easy recipe. Easy to make ahead. Made some slight adjustments. Used whole piece of wonton wrapper (too small when cut into 1/4's), did not bother brushing oil on it, turned out crisp. And similar to another reviewer did not add the sauce to the wonton cups until it was ready to eat. Also made 2 versions, 1 spicy and 1 not spicy (w/o curry paste for a friend who couldn't eat spicy) and definitely thought the spicy one was better.

Super easy! These gets ooohs and aaaahs when served as the presentation is outstanding. Mine were a bit 'drippy' so be sure to serve with cocktail napkins. They are not a one bite treat so they're a bit awkward to eat. Next time I am going to add some diced water chestnuts for some added crunch.

It disappared quickly at the party and everyone asked how it was done, so it sounds like a hit to me..I only managed to snag one before the plates disappeared :-) Easy to make, though finding a workable mango chutney recipe was a pain (I used the one from "PORK TENDERLOIN WITH MANGO CHUTNEY" on this site). Used a pound of shrimp which filled around 38 shells (no leftover dressing), but I used the rest of the mango chutney in the remaining shells (I also topped the shrimp w/ the chutney to make it look prettier).

My friend and I made this for a Holiday Open House. They were delicious. After reading reviews, we drained the shrimp mixture overnite in cheesecloth.

Guests RAVED and requested recipe. One tip, to buy the thinniest wonton wrappers available. I purchased the thick ones and after baking were too doughy so I baked more which made them too crunchy. Followed advice of straining shrimp mixture before placing in cups to prevent runny/soggy salad. Put mango chutney in bowl so guests could top appetizers themselves. Was a huge hit and my husband requested I make again tonight!

Oh yes, very good. For wonton cups I oiled the mini muffin tins (easier, faster) & baked 9 min. Shrimp salad was quite good, but a little watered down, even after reducing mayo & lime jc by half & straining in colander a few min before filling cups. I think my problem was thawing my shrimp via cold water rinse...made the shrimp too waterlogged to take on the flavors as much as I hoped. Def make again. Pretty and tasty.

Great combination of flavors. Because other reviewers said it was too runny, after mixing and refrigerating the shrimp mixture for a couple hours, I put it in a strainer. The excess mayo drained out and the wontons stayed crunchy when filled.

I made the mango chutney from the "Pork Tenderloin w/Mango Chutney" recipe on Epicurious. It turned out very tasty. My only variations, were to use less of the mayo and substitute LF or FF sour cream (I hate mayo taste!). I used the small wonton squares, the only thing to worry about is timing from when you set the plates to when you serve to guests. Make sure not to set these out too long in advance as the cups will get soggy. The green curry does get hotter the longer it sits, so start out with a little, and increase only after it's sat a bit in the fridge. Oh, and for teh shrimp - I sauteed with garlic and shallots then threw into mixture. YUM!!

Wonderful, and easy! I used the 3-inch wontons, cut them to about 2-inch square to fit in my muffin cups. They were fine, but phyllo cups would be just as good and easier. I added more curry paste and mango chutney to the dressing, and I used reduced fat mayo. Next time I'll use half the mayo - I had way too much dressing. I used 1 pound of shrimp, which filled 36 cups, not 48. All in all, a huge hit, so easy, and one I'll make many times again!

First off, I cheated and used premade filo cups to save time so I can only honestly rate the shrimp salad itself, but I give it four stars. Couldn't really taste the mango chutney, but I trust that it added something. The flavor was fantastic and they all disappeared at the function to which I brought them. Question: what size are the wonton squares you use? The squares I have are really small and I couldn't see cutting them into quarters.

Fabulous! Many have requested this recipe from me and continue to prepare for guests. The curry gets hotter the longer it sits. A small fresh mango garnish on top of each sooths the fire. Use the round woton/gyoza wrappers to avoid the hassle of cutting. Just oil the pan & stick them in!

Light refreshing taste and looks pretty too. Didn't have mango chutney around, so I used very ripe mango cut into small cubes instead. Also used Mae Ploy brand green curry which is probably the best around, if you can find it. 10 mins on the wonton wasn't enough for my oven, and I might have overcooked it somehow cause it turned "hard" instead of crunchy,but it's something I could work around with.

This is my all time favorite recipe. I follow it to the tee except I add more chutney. I always use Major Greys hot mango chutney...yummy. I've never had the appetizer last long enough for the wonton to get soggy. There is usually always shrimp mixture left over that I serve on the side and people put it on crackers or whatever else is handy. For those who find it too watery, I suggest you make sure your shrimp is very dry before adding. Don't give up on this one! Aloha

The guests at our garden party loved these. No problems as described by others. The wontons were nice and crisp. I made them a day in advance along with the filling.

To the people frustrated with soggy wonton cups, try lining the inside of the cups with a small piece of soft lettuce (ie: Bibb or Boston) first, then add the seafood mixture. This will keep the filling from making the cups soggy and adds a nice dash of color. Also, to make things even easier, try using the premade "Siljan" crispy cups that you can find at the grocery store. They work and look great and are a real time saver!

This is soooo easy and impressive. I used tiny shrimp (didn't chop), and followed one reviewer's advice to leave out the mango chutney. The wonton wrappers were frustrating: they stayed raw in some places and were brittle and flavorless. I ended up frying them instead and serving as "chips" onto which to spoon the shrimp mixture. Mmm!

These were a hit last night. I made up my own shrimp salad recipe (shrimp, corn, and red bell pepper). They would have been better if my mini muffin pans were smaller or the wonton wrapper larger.

Awesomely easy, with few ingredients, consistently wowing guests, including the food writer for the main newspaper in this medium-sized city, who asked for the recipe which brought me to this site. Lose the mango chutney; I love the ingredient, but not in this recipe. Do not cut or trim the won-ton wrappers. Instead, spray with butter-flavored cooking spray (I use Pam)- Pan side only. Adds flavor, too. It's effortless getting the wrappers into the mini-muffin tins. I stuffed the salad into the wrappers and enjoyed wrappers with and without it! (There isn't enough salad for the # of wrappers; for a huge crowd, try doubling the salad. This recipe will serve 12 or fewer people nicely as an appetizer; an equal number of filled wrappers were eaten by 2 separate groups of 4 and 12! Use real mayo, not fat free; that, and the mango chutney, will ruin it. Note: Wonton wrappers are sold in a freezer. Make the wrappers ahead, if you wish; even a klutzy person such as I can make the whole thing fast...You must have all the ingredients in front of you when starting!

Rating: 3
I love this appetizer! I like to add just a bit more curry paste for extra spice. The shrimp mix is less runny if you pulse it in the food processor and I agree with the previous cook: Make it ahead for better flavor. I serve the won tons on the side because they get too soft if they sit with the shrimp mix in them. I've also put the mix in slices of hothouse cucumber that I hollowed out with a melon ball scoop - very yummy!

This was amazing. Everybody loved them -- the kids and the adults. I used small bay shrimp so I didn't have to chop them and I think the whole shrimp look nicer. I also trimmed the wonton wrappers individually; the 1/4 wrapper was way too small for my miniature muffin tins.

This went over really well at our cocktail party. I accidently cut the wontons off center on one of the cuts which worked out great because then 2 of the 4 stacks were a little wider and I liked how they turned out more like cups with points up in the air than flat and open. I used a plastic cutting board to oil them and after the first batch this was great beacause they stuck in place for brushing but were easy to remove too. I used Mae Ploy brand of curry paste and I needed to add more so next time I would use 1 tsp curry paste and more lime juice. Made the mixture the day before and it was better that way. These cups are perfect and could be used with a variety of fillings. People liked the bite-size and ease of grasping them on the tray and well as the kick of the curry.

I don't know what happened with this. Where did I go wrong? The flavor was fine but the texture was runny--this really grossed me out. Perhaps I didn't drain it well before mixing in the other ingredients. The wonton cups were a complete disaster and I blame no one but my own dumb self. I didn't bake them long enough (don't rely on cooking times and "color" to tell you when they're done!). Ladies and Gentlemen, learn from my mistake: taste-test the wonton cups until you get the crispy/crunchy texture. I'm glad to see that some of you other folks got this right! -t

Excellent! I couldn't find wonton wrappers at my local grocery stroe, and I didn't have time to go down to the chinese grocer, so I used Phyllo instead, with good results. I found that the cups could have used a bit more shrimp in each cup though. I'd up the shrimp to sixteen ounces next time for 48 cups.

I had a Christmas cocktail party recently and there were a lot of yummy appetizers, but this one was the first to go. Several people even asked for the recipe. I think that next time I will probably make more of the shrimp filling. I had extra wonton cups, and even though the recipe was easy... these took some time and I would have liked to have used them all.

I have made this four times to rave reviews. It has become a standard. Everyone wants the recipe. It is so easy but very impressive. I wouldn't change anything.

I brushed the wonton wrappers with high-quality unrefined corn oil, which gave them a real flavor-boost.

A quick, easy recipe with great results. I used wonton wrappers and well as "ciljans" which are tiny appetizer cups ready to go.

I just got back from a party where these were served and I couldn't wait to come home and find the recipe so I can make them for my next party. Oh heck, why wait for a party, I may just make them tomorrow because they were so good!

This met with rave reviews from everyone who sampled it. I'm making it for a party again this week, but I'm adding finely diced celery for extra texture and cutting down on the mayonnaise. Also: this is delicious served in store bought miniature phyllo cups. Forget the wontons!

These get a "wow" response that more than justifies the small amount of work required. I bought pre-cooked (but not frozen) salad shrimp to make it even easier. I did triple the amount of curry paste and chutney because I thought the taste was too "mayonnaise-y" at first. Next time, I may add only a tablespoon or two of mayo. The remaining wonton wrappers made great crackers, cut in fourths and backed for a few minutes on a cookie sheet. If your oven runs hot, like mine, you'll only bake the wonton cups for 6 or 7 minutes. I had to toss the first batch because they were burnt at ten minutes.

These are great! I made these for a party this weekend and they were well received by everyone - even those who were a little spice shy. The only problem I had was the amount of wonton. Instead of cutting each into quarters, I used a cookie cutter to ct one out of each, and used the whole pack.

I made these for a cocktail party and they disappeared in minutes. I had wonton cups leftover however, so next time I would probably increase the amount of the salad by 50 %.

This recipe definitely yields high in work/result ratio! It is very quick and easy to prepare and a nice addition to a party set-up. It was a bit spicy to some, but I didn't notice the heat in the curry paste. I will make this again.
