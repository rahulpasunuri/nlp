This was just ok. I'm not serving it until tonight, and when I reheat, I'll use some of the "doctoring" suggestions. Hopefully, that will improve it. As an aside, I used baby bellas and dried porcinis, and almost wish I had skipped the dried porcinis- either they don't seem to complement the bellas very well, or...? Not sure.

This recipe requires wild mushrooms. There are lots of great recipes out there for mushroom soups prepared with button mushrooms, but this is not one of them. Fresh shiitakes are key. Use at least 3/4 pound of these. I agree with some of the other reviews in that additional wine and white pepper is essential. Finished the dish with small croutons made from sprouted wheat bread topped with goat cheese and a small sprig of italian parsley. This added another dimension to the flavor as well as enhancing the otherwise drab presentation. Fabulous,earthy,hearty,definitavely gourmet starter course.

Without yet comparing to other blended mushroom soups I can't give it 4 forks, but with some "doctoring" (see below) it deserves a 3. Indeed it needs plenty of salt, fresh-ground black pepper, some ground white pepper, and more Madeira (as mention in other reviews). I added some balsamic vinegar (maybe a couple tablespoons), and what I think is the key missing ingredient: white truffle oil. Be careful not to put too much, but just the right amount (maybe a teaspoon) is what brings everything together and adds another dimension. I've made it several times now and routinely receive many compliments.

I probably shouldn't have made this after reading all the reviews, but I still did. Shame on me. I agree with everyone else - you have to add SOMETHING to make this worthwhile of the cost for the wild mushrooms. And yes, I still used dry porcinis, unlike the person who used fresh ones (what a waste even if it was a GREAT recipe). Anyway, heavy cream, salt and white pepper saved this from being a disaster...I'm just glad I happened to have some standing by. Be sure to stock up yourself before you attempt this recipe.

I found it to be rather bland and the resulting color was unattractive (perhaps because I used crimini mushrooms).

Delicious recipe, even with button mushrooms. Added bit more mushrooms, dash of nutmeg and tarragon. Perfect as an appetizer or main meal with bread and a salad. True mushroom flavor.

This makes a great start, but I do a few things differently. First, replace russet potatoes with yukon gold, cook separately and mash, then add to soup as a thickener. Second, using baby bella shrooms, dice but leave large enough for "chewing", and don't puree the soup. Third, add a cup of heavy cream towards the end of the simmering process.

I received many compliments on this soup, which was light and rich at the same time. Be sure to make it in advance - it was bland when I first made it, but gained depth and character after sitting for a day.

I've had this with both wild (a friend made it) and button mushrooms (when I couldn't find wild). A very hearty, yummy soup. Perfect for winter starters or lunch.

This would have been very bland indeed if I hadn't added more thyme and madeira. I even used a homemade double chicken broth, which is probably what saved it. It needed a large amount of kosher salt. It's fairly low-fat and that's the only reason I would consider doing it again, though I would probably use even more mushrooms and less potatoes. Really a waste of my extremely expensive frozen porcinis.

This recipe was fabulous for Christmas Eve. Just as good as anything served in a fine restaurant. I made it using lots of fresh, stemmed Shitake, Oyster, Chantrelles, some Portobello well trimmed of the gills and stems, and a couple packages of dried Porcini. Doctored it up by pouring in more Madeira, Cognac (which really gave it depth), Nutmeg, Salt, and topped it with a Tablespoon or more so of grated Italian Fontina cheese. Our gourmet friends loved it. Mmm mmm good!!!

I had a hard time locating the wild mushrooms, so I used regular button mushrooms. Found some porcinis, so I used more of them. Be careful when seasoning, I had to add some extra thyme and salt to prevent it from being to bland. Either way, it's hearty, yet light enough for an appetizer. The guests all loved it! Will definitely give it another shot with the wild mushrooms.

This is a wonderful soup, everyone raves about it!!! I add a dollop of sour cream on the top before I serve. I have given this recipe out to many friends and they get similar glowing compliments and requests for the recipe.

Fantastic! - even when made with button mushrooms. I'll make this one again and again.

Perhaps I used too many potatoes as the flavor permeated the soup. There have been other recipes that I prefer on this site.

Excellent!! We made it for Thanksgiving - also the first time I actually followed a recipe to the teaspoon - and it was amazing! This is a very unpretentious dish - richness of the soup and the wonderful balance of flavors makes this more than just a "mushroom soup". It's officially part of my cooking repertoire now!

This is a wonderful first course. I have also made it with 1/2 cup of wild rice to give it a little heartier texture. It was very popular at Thanksgiving dinner.

I loved this soup, made it for thanksgiving and everyone was begging for the recipe. I'm now adding it to the menu at the restaurant I work in. Try it with coffee mushrooms instead to cut costs and add a handful of dried wild mushrooms as well. ENJOY!!!!

What a delightful, hearty autumnal soup. I recommend NOT pureeing. Try thickening with oatmeal to retain the character and shape of the mushrooms. It is one of my faves.
