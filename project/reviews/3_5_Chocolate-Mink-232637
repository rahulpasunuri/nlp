This is a wonderful dessert for a cold winter night! I cooked it in little clear glass pyrex ramekins in a square pyrex dish water bath and they came out perfectly, silky and amazing. The best chocolate is a must. Will make it again this weekend for my sister who cannot eat wheat.

This is one of my favorite desserts! But be warned, it is rich! Not something you want to serve after a heavy meal.

Delicious.. we didn't let them cool an hour (we were too impatient) but it was like a thick chocolate pudding texture.. I used Lindt Bittersweet with excellent results. It is an equipment-intense recipe, but the simplicity of ingredients balances out the workload. I wanted to lick the bowl after I was finished eating.

I made this for my boyfriend and I'm pretty sure that was the night he fell in love with me. Wonderful recipe!!! As for those having trouble removing the minks, don't wait a full hour for the cool down. I've found it's easier when the ramekins are cool enough to hold. The warmth of the silk paired with the ice cream is marvelous. This has become my favorite sweet treat to make.

I made this for Valentine's Day. It was fabulous and serving it made me feel like a real gourmet chef! I can't wait to make it again as a special, impressive treat for my guests.

This is a quick and tasty dessert. It can be made a few hours ahead so it's a good choice for a casual dinner party. My guest of honor loves the dessert course and was very enthusiastic about this one. I doubled the recipe with no problems, and served the cake right in the ramekins with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. I only wish I'd remembered to sprinkle cinnamon on top, as other reviewers suggested.

People love these! Definitely serve with coffee ice cream. I've made a few times now with great results. Good chocolate a necessity.

To add to my previous comment, the quality of chocolate definitely makes the dessert. I used Lindor dark chocolate bars, and highly recommend them.

We LOVE this dessert! "This made my week!" said my boyfriend, who can be picky. It's our new standard dinner party dessert. It is so decadent, but not overly so, and relatively easy and inexpensive to make. I served it with a dollop of fresh whipped cream (no sugar added, which helped dampen the sweetness of the chocolate), a small spoonful of vanilla ice cream, and a dusting of cinnamon - an attractive presentation. I don't have ramekins, so I used a muffin tin and it worked just fine. However, I've made this twice, and the first time, the desserts were solid and crumbly, whereas the second time, they were gooey and didn't harden at all. The only difference in my preparation was that the first time, I beat the egg whites a lot longer than I did the second. Does anyone have any thoughts on why these were so different?

I did not like this recipe very much. I I kept seeing it in the Best of Gourmet cookbook and thought it looked wonderful, and I liked the idea that it only made two servings. I finally made it for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day and it just wasn't that good. It was way too rich and sweet (even though I was careful to get the right kind of chocolate). My boyfriend said it was like a half cooked brownie. Icecream was the only thing that made it worth eating, and we still didn't finish it.

I was looking for a chocolate dessert that didn't have dairy or wheat flour, so this fit the bill perfectly. I doubled the recipe successfully, and it was delicious. Served with Bailey's Irish Cream ice cream.

This was delicious!! I actually forgot to add the egg whites afterwards and just put them in with the chocolate and beat that mixture. Still turned out yummy!

We have made this several times, always with excellent results. Very rich though, particularly if you use a rich ice cream like Haagen Dazs as the accompaniment. This makes four desserts for our house.

This dish was perfect for Valentine's day for two! After reading the reviews, I was particularly attentive to the baking. The water bath and foil covering were essential parts of this recipe, making it fudgy on the inside. I cut down on the baking time a bit. I had no trouble removing the cute little cakes from the ramekins, just had to leave them dipped in the very hot water for a while (almost 30 seconds in one case) and drag a knife around the edges. Served on a plate sprinkled with cocoa powder with vanilla ice cream and sliced strawberries. Very rich...neither of us could fniish after our meal.

I made this because it was conveniently sized for two for Valentine's day. My husband actually laughed when he looked at it, but stopped laughing when he tasted it, at least! It is not very sophisticated but it is delicious -- you can't go wrong with those ingredients for a real chocolate lover.

Perfect for two people- i could barely finish mine! coffee icecream is a must- compliments the dish very nicely. soo rich and delicious!

More cozy than spectacular, but it's really simple and practical in that it serves just two (although I could only finish half in a sitting). I buttered the ramekin and the parchment and had no trouble with removal. Also subbed whipped cream for the suggested accompaniment.

Flourless chocolate cakes are one of my favorite desserts and I really enjoy this recipe, at least partially because it perfectly serves two. Serve it with a scoop of ice cream and you'll be amazed.

Fabulous, fast and easy! I used really good 60-70% chocolate!. I also tried mint chocolate -- Ymm. I would like a tip on getting the cakes to turn out of the ramkin in one piece though.

Only 2 forks because the yield was brutal. I doubled the recipe and still only ended up with 2 decent-sized servings. I had to completely redo the recipe to get 2 more servings. Weird consistency but very chocolatey. Not bad, but I wouldn't make it again

This is an outstanding recipe. I used Valhrona bittersweet chocolate and the flavor & texture were sublime. Definitely very rich but worth every bite!

The texture of this was so unusual, not sure if it turned out as it was supposed to though because my oven is ghetto. Tasted good still, and was so easy, so worth experimenting with a bit to see if I can improve.

Absolutely delicious! No problem unmolding (I lined cup bottoms with parchment paper.) Served it with one scoop each of: chestnut ice cream; hazelnut gelato; and, pear/ginger sorbet. Great presentation!

An awesome dessert! Since seeing this recipe on the cover of the September Gourmet magazine I have made it at least 4 times. My family is crazy about it. I'm able to get very high quality bittersweet Dutch chocolate and it makes a big difference. Who cares if it doesn't unmold properly? For Christmas gifts this year I'm sending recipe cards, ramekins and dutch chocolate out to friends so they too can enjoy this decadent treat.

Delicious! I baked it without the water bath for twelve minutes. When the outside bakes faster than the inside it unmolds perfectly and stays gooey. We will be having this again soon!

Loved it!!!! It's sooo fudgey and mink is the perfect description for the texture and feel of it. I will definitely make it again. Absolutely the perfect end for a intimate dinner for two.

I know I'm in the minority here, but I didn't love it. 30 minutes is WAY too long, they were too cakey. Also, the chocolate flavor was too intense (I used Lindt 85% cocoa semi-sweet bar)and I'm a chocoholic. It was good with ice cream and everyone liked it, or said they did. I like the fallen chocolate souffle cake from Molly O'neill's New York Cookbook much better, but this recipe is definitely good if you want to make dessert for 2-4 peole.

very delicious. i served the cakes with vanilla ice cream and raspberry coulis. i didn't have any problems removing the cakes from the ramekins as i lined the bottoms of my ramekins with parchment paper and placed the ramekins in a bowl of hot water prior to unmolding them.

I used a small sized ramkins, and baked for 30 minutes. It came out more like a cake. I should have baked them for 20-25 minutes instead

Rating: 4
This was terrific, even with my problems. Maybe my ramekins were too big because it came out more like a cake. I won't cook them as long next time. Also, I used splenda instead of sugar. It didn't make any difference in the taste and it made it 'good carb' friendly. I'll probably try them again tonight. And tomorrow night and ....

Very luscious. I didn't even attempt to unmold them. Why bother? Just serve them right in the ramekins.

This was rich and gooey. Ice cream is a must. Very easy to make. (I used Callebaut chocolate.) Didn't unmold perfectly, but since icecream went on top, it was just fine. I quadrupled the recipe with no problem.

Only complaint I got on this one was that I should have doubled the recipe! Instead, I made it again the next night on request! I, too, had trouble removing from the ramekins, though more so the first time because I forgot to grease them. Even greased, though, they didn't come out perfectly molded.

The taste was outstanding- I used scharffen berger chocolate, and it was so rich and delicious. Served with homemade vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce. The puddings unmolded perfectly. However, mine did not look like the picture- the surface was completely smooth and firmer. Perhaps I should have taken them out a bit sooner.

A very easy recipe to follow and it came out great. I used Lindt chocolate. No problems unmolding the cakes. Though I did not unmold them until the next day and after setting them in hot water. I can't wait to make this again.

What a great recipe! It was extremely easy to make, tasted wonderful, and will be extremely easy to make in larger amounts for company. Obviously the key is using high-quality chocolate, as the recipe calls for. My only complaint is that I did not have an easy time of it removing the pudding from the ramekins after the one-hour cool down period, and wound up having to spoon it out, ruining the look a bit. (Though once covered with the suggested coffee ice cream accompaniment, it was not noticeable at all.) I'd be curious to hear if other cooks had this problem or not.
