This recipe has some terrific ingredients and the reduction meant a little more work with no noticable results....it tasted like plain old chicken. Flavorless.

made with leeks instead of shallots, no big deal added a splash of dry white wine in the leek saute everything else was as stated except vin jaune, i used sherry, but a very nice dish, i served it over trader joe's fettucine.

This took longer than advertised and was mediocre at best. Family do not think it was one of the better chicken dishes we have had.

Another alternative to Vin Jaune is white port - much more affordable and easy to find.

A very simple and delicious dish. I began the dinner with a wild mushroom tart (see Epicurious recipe) which raised expectations on this dish. I served with peeled asparagus and a crusty French bread. I also went with the Gewürztraminer suggestion from another reviewer and wasn't let down! The leftovers were demolished by the next afternoon. Our friend's cousin asked if I had a single brother who cooks this dish...

I had fresh morels and used them for this last night. I also went with the gewurztraminer and used chicken legs and thighs. It was terrific -- my husband has moved it up to the top of his make again list. There was a little sauce left over, which I saved -- it would be good just slathered on toast!

I made this meal while visiting friends in France, last month. While their local wine merchant carried vin jaune, he suggested I use a Savagnin from the Jura region, which wasn't nearly so expensive (about 25 Euros). The results were just fabulous and my friends are still raving about the meal. We served it with simple roasted potatoes, with rosemary, and steamed asparagus. The remainder of the Savagnin went really well with the meal. Delicious!

ps. i used only chicken thighs, because i prefer dark meat... the meat was fork tender and fabulous.

WOW. as gwen stefani once said, "this shit is BANANAS!" i just made this with a gewurztraminer, and i'm so glad i did. the pairing of a sweet, tropical- fruity white was perfect with the rich meal. as perfect as a sauternes and fois gras! as far as finding vin jaune goes, GOOD LUCK! i live in a lively, sophisticated neighborhood in brooklyn, and when i asked EVERY WINE STORE whether they carry vin jaune, the response was either: "VAN JONE? WHAT'S THAT?" or "Wow, we don't carry that." Whatever, the substitution I made was terrific, and I'll be doing it again and again.

First off, vin jaune is not only hard to come by, but also rather expensive to throw into a recipe... in Quebec, the cheapest bottle is about $60. We made it with Gewurztraminer and it was great. Much like many recipes from Gourmet, don't believe the active time estimate... it's more like 30-35 minutes. But well worth the time.

I need to update my review of a day ago, which was written having only eaten the breast meat and just a taste of the dark meat. Now I am eating leftovers of the dark meat and it is truly amazing. This recipe would completely be a 4-forker if it only used dark meat, which comes out tender, falling off the bone, and packed with flavor. The breast meat was not only on the dry side, the morel flavor just did not penetrate it as thourughly. But I will definitely be making this in the future, with dark meat only.

I made this using a pale dry sherry and only 1/2 c cream, with 1/2 c homemade veggie stock added. It was very good and I didn't miss the extra cream. The time to cook is a little long, I think, and my breast pieces were a little overdone. I would remove them earlier than the other pieces next time. I found this much more elegant and tasty than coq au vin, to which it is similar.
