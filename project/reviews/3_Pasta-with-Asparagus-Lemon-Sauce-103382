I'm assuming the author didn't mean 5-6 quarts of water (=20-24 cups), because that's not an ideal amount for your average consumer size pot. I used 6 cups and it was enough. If you enjoy your pasta being extra saucy, I would suggest using 1 1/2-2 pounds of asparagus. I used 1 pound and it was hardly enough. I also added garlic, parsley, 1 fresh chopped roma tomato and a small, chopped salmon that I baked in the oven while everything was cooking. This really helped bring out the rustic flavor of the asparagus and add a little "pop" to the dish.

Typo Alert...my review should have read "both my husband and I WERE disappointed! Oops!

I was really hoping for a super fresh and sharp dish on a weeknight, and unfortunately this dish didn't do it. I expected an almost overwhelming asparagus flavor, and although there is not much else in it...it was quite diluted. The color of the puree was not the bright fresh green of just blanched veggies. I might try it again, but both my husband and I were not disappointed.

Devine! Made with zest from one Meyer lemon and 1/2 a lemon's juice. Used orecchiette for the pasta. Seasoned liberally with salt and freshly ground black pepper plus lots and lots of Parmesean. Full of interesting flavor. This will certainly become a spring time staple.

Such a yummy dish. But needs needs needs a light squeeze of fresh lemon juice (not the bottled variety). AND freshly ground pepper on each finished dish. mmmmmmmmmmmmm

This is such a great one-dish meal! We've been cooking it for years. You can double the sauce part and freeze it for later.

A lot of steps (and a lot of dirty dishes), but a tasty (if basic) dish. Pleasing to eat, and satisfying. Made as written, except for adding about 1/8 tsp garlic powder in the end. Next time, would double the lemon zest (it wasn't noticeable) and probably the cheese, too (for a thicker sauce). Also would infuse the olive oil with garlic (rather than using powder) to give it more zip. Other reviews argue for/against adding various spices and herbs. I think you could really go either way. The asparagus is extremely mild, so virtually any addition will layer it with another flavor. If you don't go overboard, I think you'll still be pleased with what the asparagus lends to the dish. If you want more asparagus presence, double it; one pound asparagus to one pound pasta is NOT a lot (especially with no other "main" ingredients).

I started this recipe before reading the reviews and I was surprised to read some of the negative (i.e. tasteless & a waste of time...). I got worried so I did add extra lemon zest, the fresh lemon juice from a half a lemon, fresh dill and 2 cloves garlic, chopped. I also added a pound of shrimp so I could use this as a main course. I doubled the sauce portion and it turned out amazing! I really was relieved and amazed. I will definitely make this again. Oh, and it makes WAY MORE than 4 servings...

The sauce was tasteless. We love asparagus, love Parmigiano-Reggiano, and love Pasta. What a waste of all three flavors.

Rating: 4
Perfect springtime pasta dish, and from now on will be one of my favorite uses of fresh asparagus! Might need a bit more salt at the very end. The lemon was subtle but anymore might take away from the delicacy. I used campanelle pasta (available from Barilla) and the bell shape perfectly captured and held the sauce. Great with a French chablis!

This is one of my all-time favorites. I follow the recipe without any significant changes, which is unusual for me since I often interpret recipes to suit my own tastes. I have used broccoli in place of asparagus, however, and found it worked just as well.

My family eats a lot of no-frills asparagus in season-- steamed, oven roasted, or grilled-- but I like to serve this dish once or twice at the height of the season, to really showcase the vegetable. The delicate flavor screams springtime freshness. Other than using less salt in the water, don't change a thing or you'll overwhelm that subtle asparagus taste. I brought the first spears of the season home from the market last week and my daughter asked when we'd have this again. She loves it! Serve with a mozzarella/tomato salad, crusty baguette, and open a bottle of rose'.

Sauteed 6-7 sliced shitake mushrooms in olive oil with 3 slivered wild leeks and added this to the sauce. Delicious. Everyone liked it.

I make this dish often and really love it. I tend to add a bit more parmesan though, and sometimes some whole or halved grape tomatoes to change it up a little. The technique is great, it really combines the flavors well.

I really wanted to love this pasta--I thought the technique was a good one and I use Faith's method for spaghetti with fresh tasting tomato sauce all the time--but I really didn't like it at all. However, my son who hates cream sauces and my husband thought it was good. That is why I gave it two forks. since I am the cook, I will try something else next time. I couldn't really taste much of any flavor and I put double the zest in it.

COOKED THIS RECIPE , LOVED IT AND LOST IT. GLAD TO FIND IT AGAIN. WE USE IT AT MY NEXT DINNER PARTY

Rating: 2
Very simple recipe, straight forward and to the point. I followed the recipe exactly, and I also found that it lacked lemon flavor and interest. The texture of the sauce is excellent however. I would make again, but perhaps would add some proscuitto,peas and pearl onions for the saltiness that the recipe lacks. I would also increase the zest, and add lemon juice as well. Don't forget to use a good cheese!

A wonderful, quick pasta dish that can even impress guests.

Very, very nice. I used juice and the zest of a whole lemon. It really made the sauce. I also used extra salt, pepper and cheese. I found that I needed the salt especially. I used a sea salt but would probably use kosher salt in the future. It was a surprisingly light dish. Good summertime fare.

I made this recipe for the second time tonight and made changes based on my first-time experience. First off, I treated the pasta as a fast, Kraft macaroni and cheese dinner substitute to go with the Polish Sausage we were grilling, rather than treating it as a stand along entre. We liked it the first time, but not well enough to make it the star of the meal. Then, to make it simple to make and serve, something the Kraft dinner is noted for, I prepared everything except the pasta ahead of time. Also, when boiling the asparagus I had ready a second pot with a colander over it so that I could pour the asparagus water into it in order to get the asparagus, thus saving the time and effort of having to spoon out by hand the asparagus stems and tips. This made the process fast and easy. I also followed other contributors' tips the second time and doubled the lemon zest. I also used the amount of salt called for. With the amount of water recommended, this wasn't too much salt and I found by cutting it in half the first time we needed to add more salt after it was served. Finally, I had the Parmesan container on the table so we could sprinkle on additional cheese if desired. This is not a complicated recipe and it took longer to explain these changes than it did to actually make the dish. For us it's a good potato substitute.

We've been making this recipe since it first came out in Gourmet - it has a wonderful refreshing flavor we don't usually encounter with pasta. It's a bit of work, but worth it!

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes...the one down-side is that it all must be put together at the last minute, but with a good parmagian cheese--delish!!

I agree with the cook from Austin; I thought this was nothing special. It was full of asparagus flavor, but lacked the asparagus texture, which I found disorienting. My husband really liked this, but I don't plan to make it again.

This pasta dish was full of asparagus flavor. My guests were not familiar with eating asparagus, but they all loved the new flavor. I altered the recipe a bit, because i was cooking for 10-12 people. I used 2 lbs of linguine pasta, 3 lbs of asparagus and did'nt use the pasta water because I liked the consistency. I served it with eggplant parmesan and Italian baked chicken. It was a real hit!

I found this VERY bland. I don't know what people were talking about with the salt? I found it NEEDED salt! Even the next day, after you expect the flavors to blend a little more, it was still bland.

This dish was so salty, it was inedible. It was difficult to determine if it could have been better, because you could taste nothing but the salt!

I just made a 1/2 version of this dish and LOVED it! I do owe a great deal of debt to the previous cooks, though. I used almost all of their suggestions -- and it turned out wonderfully. DO use more lemon zest than called for (2x worked for me). I did not use the juice and was pleased. Be careful with adding the water back in at the end as it can get watery very fast. I was shocked that this dish called for absolutely no garlic, so I substituted garlic olive oil for half of the oil called for -- it added a nice, gentle flavor which complemented the asparagus and lemon rather than overpowering it. The cheese was crucial. Don't let anyone see it before you've stirred in your cheese -- and put mor on top for good measure!

This dish was nothing special. Although the lemon flavor was nice and sauce had a good consistency, there are so many really great pasta recipes, I won't be making this again.

A good dish when asparagus in onhand and abundant. It's tasty, but I wouldn't go out of my way to make it. Like others, I used twice the amount of lemon zest. I had pecorino-romano onhand which gave it a nice salty flavor. Be sure to finely puree the asparagus. I used a mini-chopped and it was a bit chunkier than I would serve to guests. A nice, fairly quick weeknight meal that I will keep in my repertoire.

With the extra lemon and cheese suggested by other reviewers this is a pretty good dish. The method of blending asparagus was so interesting that I made a similar recipe, but instead of lemon juice and pasta water I blended the asparagus with half a can of stewed tomatoes, and added a tablespoon of red wine vinegar. It was a great, simple sauce with nicely layered flavors.

Rating: 2
This recipe was ok... I found it to be a bit bland, even extra lemon juice and salt didn't seem to revive it. w/o the cheese it wouldn't have been good at all (cheese makes anything better). I think if I would have reserved more pieces of asparagus it would have been better. The pasta to asparagus ratio was like 10:1. One note: its A LOT better luke-warm than piping hot, I'm not sure why, it just was.

Great recipe, aside from one small flaw: The cooking water adds way too much salt, so after the first 1/2 cup, I substitute white wine for the rest of the cooking water.

I really like this recipe alot. Just made a couple changes. More cheese and LOTS more lemon. I am a lemon fanatic though. It's messy to clean up, but well worth it!

This recipe is OK. I added more lemon and cheese than the recipe asked for. It took more time to make than indicated and it used a lot of dishes, so it took a long time to clean up. Overall, given the amount of work required to prepare and clean up, I would say this recipe doesn't deliver enough to make it worth making again.

I also added juice of half a lemon. Very unique colour & flavour. Not for nonadventurous eaters. Bit messy to make but would make again.

Like another reviewer, I found it to be a tad salty - I think I'll scale back on the salt next time. I used lime instead of lemon and spaghetti noodles for the penne, and it still tasted wonderfully! Next time I will definitely add some grilled chicken. Fantastic recipe!

I love this recipe and have made it countless times. I add the juice of one lemon to give it some extra zip.

After reading the receipe and all the reviews I decided to make it. It was great. I took the advice of the others raters and added more lemon (the zest of a whole lemon) and slightly more parmesan cheese. It is easy to make and one of the tastiest vegtable pasta dishes ever. I also added about a half a cup of heavy cream right at the end as I was tossing the pasta with the sauce and the cheese. One time I also added about a dozen shrimp that I had quickly saiute in a bit of olive oil. This one is definitely a "keeper".

This has become a fast favorite among family and friends. The perfect summer pasta! I made it last summer for a dinner party with just the "girls" - I was literally stalked via email until I gave them all the recipe!! My only recommendation is to add a bit more parmesan than the recipe asks for.

This was simple to prepare and a great way to enjoy asparagus. Use gemmelli pasta, the shape perfectly complements the shape of the asparagus tips. The green sauce was appealing in color, flavor, and creaminess, but next time I'd consider straining it to remove the tough plant fibers.

This has become one of our favorites, although like many of the others I add in extra lemon (I usually use the zest from a whole lemon). I also found it to be quite salty as written (maybe because of the cheese) and usually only use 1 tbsp. of salt rather than 2.

I agree with others - a more intense lemon flavor would add a lot to the recipe. I'd recommend the Lemon Asparagus Pasta on this site - it doesn't require the pureeing and is much, much better

Rating: 3
Yes, it needed a little more lemon. Did like j9andmas and grilled bonesless chick breasts (with a honey dijon), sliced and added on top of pasta. Pureed sauced was very creamy! Surprisingly rich. This makes a pretty good low-fat recipe especially if you omit the cheese. You can provide grated cheese for people with normal diets to garnish...actually, I would probably eat it that way myself to get a more powerful cheese taste than mixing it in!

Rating: 3
I improvised a bit. I sauteed boneless chix breats with olive oil, garlic, white wine, lemon juice and some mushrooms. I added this at the end and mixed everything together. I also used fontinella cheese. I think I used too much leftover pasta water when puree-ing the asparagus - it was a bit runny. I served with fresh yellow diced tomatoes on top. Overall - this was very good. Will definitely make again.

This dish is sublime!! I've already made it twice. So simple and completely delicious. It is an asparagus lover's dream come true. I love the ways in which the asparagus is used, saving the tips (the most tender part) for garnish. I used romano cheese instead of parmesan one time and it worked just as well. This is an elegant yet easy dish that can be served as a starter course, side dish or main dish. Thank you, Faith, for sharing this recipe.

We loved this dish. I heeded the advice of others and added more lemon zest, some lemon juice and plenty of salt and pepper. I also added some Knorr Aromat All Purpose Seasoning (not sure if this is allowed!). I then cooked the pasta, al dente,tossed it in the sauce and added the cheese. It came out just fine and was very easy. Will definitely do it again.

This is a very clever recipe using the same pot of boiling water for asparagus and pasta, then using the water in different stages of the recipe, as well as finishing the pasta risotto-style. These techniques infuse the pasta with flavor. However, it still seemed a bit bland. Perhaps more lemon flavor would do it as others have suggested.

This dish was so good even the kids ate it up. Next time I'm going to add more asparagus tips to the dish. I'm also wondering how this would be served cold along with a BBQ?
