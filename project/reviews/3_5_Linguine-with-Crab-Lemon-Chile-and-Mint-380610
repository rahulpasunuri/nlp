Fast and simple. I followed the recipe as written, only using more of all ingredients except for linguine. I did add a finely diced avocado at the end with the crab only because I had one that needed to be used. Next time I will add about 1/2 cup toasted pine nuts to give a little crunch. The lemon juice gives the dish a nice clean taste. The crab was perfect. I served some jalapeño slices on the side for anyone to add if they wanted more of a kick.

This recipe is really delicious as is, but there is still some room for improvement. I used two fresno chiles, but it could have used another (although my boyfriend, who doesn't like heat as much as I do, thought the spice was just fine, and borderline too spicy  so it depends on your tolerance for spicy foods). All I would do differently next time around is maybe adding a little more of all of the flavors  a little more garlic, more shallots, more mint, more lemon. Salt is to taste, but I found it needed several grinds of fresh sea salt to get it just right. All in all, a very tasty dish. Interesting flavors and relatively light tasting considering the crab and the butter.

We just tried this tonight, and it was very good. We like it on the spicy side, so would recommend 2-3 peppers, not 1-2, and it needed a little salt or romano cheese, but we really enjoyed it!

Finishing the pasta in the skillet makes it incredibly luscious and creamy. I'm not sure if it was the quality of my ingredients, but I found myself adding a little extra chile, lemon and mint in order to make this as fully flavored as I wanted. Overall it's delicious and easy to make!

Excellent pasta - great flavor combination from the ingredients. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

I used all Jumbo Lump Crab meat and it over-powered the dish. I think using a mix of Crab would have been better. The pasta was perfect and very tasty, I wished I had used a different type of crab.

Amazing! Perfect combination of spicy from the jalapeno, and citrus from the lemon juice and rind. Colorful presentation and complex flavors and fresh mint gives the added touch.

Too much pasta to crab. Also, I used one serrano chile in a double recipe and, while I liked the heat, my husband found it way too spicy. The crab/lemon/chile/mint combo is intriguing, but this recipe just didn't do it for us. Won't make again.

This was really good, rich and buttery with a lovely combination of flavors, but I'm not sure it was special enough to make again. I thought it needed a lot of salt, but we like salt. I used about one and a half serrano chiles which I thought was about the perfect amount of kick. It made two giant servings and could easily serve three.

Great recipe but BEWARE: On the iPad version, the dashes do not appear, so it looks like you need 12 chiles and to cook the shallots for 34 minutes. I caught the mistake with the cooking time but ended up adding 12 Thai chiles. Wow that was spicy!

I made this as a first course for my New Year's Eve dinner and it was absolutely amazing!!! One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had! Will use 1 1/2 chiles next time, instead of just 1. Might also try a tad more mint just for fun. I wasn't sure how the flavors would work together, but it was magical. It reminded me of Southeast Asian flavors, like a fresh Thai pasta. I used 6 oz of lump crabmeat and 2 oz. from a King Crab leg at While Foods. The high-quality crab made all the difference!!! This is the best pasta dish I've ever had...surreal!

This dish was surreal! I, like a few other reviewers, wasn't sure how these flavors would work together, but it was magical! I made this as a first course for New Year's Eve and it was perfect. Light, refreshing and incredibly tasty. It definitely had an essence of Southeast Asian flavors, like a Thai pasta, with the chiles. When I make this again, I'll probably use 1 1/2 chiles instead of just one. Will also try more mint just for fun. You need to make sure to use high-quality crab, or else this won't be as good. I used 6 oz of lump crab meat and 2 oz from a King Crab leg. The guy at Whole Foods pulled the meat out of the leg for me, so it was easy. This is one of the best pastas I've ever tasted!

without the perfect ratio of pasta to crab,mint,chili lemon, this pasta lacks flavor. I couldent measure out 8 ounces as I always make my pasta from scratch, though I dont think I was over by much more then an ounce or 2. I'll use the picture as a reference next time,because this sounds tasty... or maybe turn this into a risotto! No rating due to my error.

Wonderful recipe. Next time I will use more shallots and mint. I wasn't able to find red chilis, so I substituted serranos, taking out the seeds to make sure the heat didn't overwhelm the delicate flavors of the crab meat. Also, it needed some salt. I used fleur de sel to finish. Delicious. I think this would work well as a pasta salad as well, with a shorter noodle.

Based on the ingredients, I wondered how it would all meld into the perfect linguine recipe. And meld it did. Will make this recipe frequently as it is a gourmet delight.

I made this last night and it was terrific. The only change I might make next time around is to go with one chile instead of two. It was a great dish, though.
