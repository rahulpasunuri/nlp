WOW! This recipe was fabulous. This is so simple and so tasty. The only thing I changed was that I used Trader Joe's Homestyle Salsa Especial,(Medium)instead of the bottled red salsa. I cannot wait to try this one out on my friends, I know they will love it.

Excellent recipe and so easy and quick. I followed the recipe to a 'T' and wouldn't change a thing. Definitely company worthy.

We made this dish w/some homemade habanero pepper jelly that a friend gave us. It was delicious, and very easy to make. Perfect for a weeknight dinner. I did add a bit more orange juice to shine through the heat of the habaneros.

This is a wonderful change from regular chicken. The sweet/hot flavors are a great blend. I grilled on BBQ instead of roasting and then hens were soooo moist. Ate the last 1/2 for breakfast this am.

I made this with chicken thighs. It was nice, and different, but to me, the orange kind of overwhelmed it, and made it sweeter than it needed to be. Its already got the sweetness of the jalapeno jelly. But I tend to like things hot, and am not a big fan of orange in food, so take that into account if you're thinking of making this. Its pleasant.

I liked the flavor, the pleasant aftertaste and the juicy texture of the hens. I baked the hens in the oven, and will definitely try them on the grill next time.

This was easy and delicious. Couldn't find chipotle chili powder, so I used regular chili powder and used a chipotle salsa in the sauce. Just the right amount of heat, sweet & smoky.

We have made this recipe about 8 times. It's great! We don't use the salsa. Quick and easy!

I really liked the combination of sweet/hot with the game hens, which tend to be rather flavorless themselves. I roasted them on a rack in the oven, and they came out crispy and delicious.

These hens were a huge hit. Moist and full of flavor. Didn't find chipotle chili powder so used Gebhardt's and chipotle salsa. They were easy to make for a big group and that is always a plus! Nice presentation, too, with the cilantro visible under the skin.

My husband and I really loved this. A great new twist for game hens. I could not find the jalepeno jelly and used chipolte jelly instead which probably made it less spicy. We had a tossed salad on the side and mushroom polenta which worked just great.Definitely a keeper and one I would highly recommend to others.
