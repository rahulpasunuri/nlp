I made this cake for a party, and everyone really enjoyed it. It wasn't difficult to make, just a little time consuming given all the steps and setup time. The only changes I made were to add a little Mexican vanilla and sugar to the whipping cream, and we left off the currant jelly and didn't feel it was necessary. The cake portion is almost like a dense brownie, and the mousse is really flavorful with a great texture. Whipped cream and raspberries were the perfect toppings. I would definitely make this one again.

Hubby is a huge chocolate fan, but me...not so much. I tried this for him and found to my delight that I quite love it as well. It is so delicious, particularly given the ease of the recipe. I'm in the process of making it for our NYE dinner tonight, to go with Cava and raspberries...lovely! You can easily halve the recipe (aside from the weirdness of halving one egg for the cake, but I just eyeball it). I use a 7-inch spring form and it comes out perfectly. Buon appetito!

I'm pretty stingy with my forks and this one deserved all 4. I made this for Christmas and, while it is an involved recipe with many steps, I didn't find it to be hard. Just putzy. Give yourself a full day or split it into 2 smaller sessions over 2 days like I did and it is totally manageable. The cake, oh my gawd. Rich. Dense. Creamy. Sweet. Fantastic. You just have to try it once. It was so delicious that it gave me the giggles. Really. Just try it.

Fantastic torte, and super easy to make. I made it for a party and so many people raved about it I made it again the very next night for another event and it was devoured again there too!! This is definitely a keeper - highly recommended! The different layers and textures complement each other perfectly.

Rarely to I rate a recipe but this one needs to be shared by all. I understand how this brought the Belgian woman to tears as described in earlier post. No need for the whipped cream; the chocolate top after chilling looks beautiful as is with just a raspberry garnish. I used 70% cacoa. My dinner party and three-year old loved it.

BTW The eggs are not raw, they are cooked slowly at low temps while whisking in, cooked to 150. I used the mousse portion to make a parfait - easy to make, great texture and flavor.

To the reviewer from Burlington, VT, who was concerned that the recipe didn't mention the use of raw eggs - you are right, recipes that use raw eggs should always include a salmonella warning. However, this is how you make mousse :) You need to use raw eggs. What can I say, mousse-makers need to be willing to risk it.

I followed the recipe pretty exactly (did freak out slightly when the mouse mixture appeared broken, but it turned out perfectly)...my only additions were a bit of almond extract in the cake and vanilla bean in the whipped cream. It turned out lovely and I actually prefer the chocolate mousse recipe to others I've used in the past.

Made the cake, not the mousse, after reading other reviews. Too involved in my opinion. Made a Bailey's chocolate mousse instead with a simpler recipe. Great cake to make your own. Added 5 minutes on the baking time.

Can't rate it yet, as only half way through the process (making the recipe over 2 day period). I have only baked the cake thus far, and it was fairly painless. I didn't have a spring form pan so I used a silicone cake pan which was fine except for some cracking and some air bubbles. Smells good, hope it tastes as good as it smells!

I made this as a birthday cake and everyone loved it, but there is a big problem with the recipe that I'm surprised more people haven't commented on. That is,the egg whites in the mousse are uncooked. I decided at the last second to throw out the egg whites and substitiute whipped cream. But I kept looking back at the recipe to see if I was missing something and wondering why it contains no warning about consuming raw eggs. I served it to children and my father-in-law who is imuno-suppressed, so had there had been any salmonella transmitted to the mousee, the result might have been disastrous.

I was really excited about this cake but ended up a little disappointed. The cake part was excellent, no complaints there, but I wasn't a huge fan of the chocolate mousse. It tasted a little bit waxy and the whole thing was too sweet and not enough of an intense chocolate flavor. I think I would make it again, but using unsweetened chocolate instead of bittersweet (since you add extra sugar anyway). I also might try a different mousse recipe on top. And you definitely need something light (such as the raspberries) to cut through the heavy richness of the cake part. It's worth making again - I think it could be really excellent with a few tweaks adjusted for your own personal taste.

Just finished making this torte.The cake part turned out just fine. It did rise a little funny in just one area along the edge, it raised to the top of the pan while the rest of the cake did'nt. As it cooled it did level out. The mousse part was quite the ordeal. I didnt have the right thermometer so I had to hold it while whisking in the egg yolk and cream mixture. When it reached nearly 150 degrees I removed it and whipped it a little because it looked a little lumpy. I added the chocolate and stirred it but it wasnt hot enough to melt the chocolate so I put it over the pan of water again (with the burner off). This seemed to do the trick. when I set it a side to whip the egg whites it looked grainy and separated. I thought I really messed this up and would have start the mousse over but when I added the 1/4 of egg whites and mixed that together it looked better. After folding in the rest of the egg whites it looked beautiful. It was smooth and not grainy at all. We will be eating this torte tomarrow to celebrate my husbands 50th birthday. I hope it taste as good as I think it will.

This was very good. When I tested the cake part it was still liquidy in the center; gave it another 5 minutes, ditto. After another 5 it still didn't look quite right but seemed to be getting overbaked on the top, so I took it out. Tasted fine when it was cooled. Used an egg- free chocolate mousse with 3 TBS Kahlua for the topping and served it in a puddle of raspberry sauce with fresh raspberries and blackberries. My family really loved it; I thought it was good but not great. Note: It really needs to come out of the fridge at least an hour before serving.

This cake was amazing and so easy. Very dense, but nice contrast with the mousse and whipped cream topping. I had to beat the egg whites for the mousse for a LONG time. Great because it can be made ahead and sit over night.

I have made this cake many times and it is always a hit,with children and adults. I baked it for a colleague n Belgium and it drove her to tears... (a serious chocolate fan).

This was amazing! I cut my guests fairly large pieces and there wasn't an ounce left on any of the plates when they were finished. I used a combination of semisweet chocolate and bittersweet chocolate in both the cake and the mousse. I didn't have red currant bunches, but the cake didn't need much more. The raspberries and sauce were plenty! It is very decadent.

Great dessert and not too difficult to make! Multiple people said it was restaurant-quality. Used bittersweet Ghirardelli (one 63% and one 70% bar) for both the brownie and the mousse. Made the torte and mousse the day before without any problems. Also made sauce of pureed, strained frozen raspberries, given that fresh are out-of-season right now. Will definitely make again.

I have been making this since the day it came out in BA years ago. It's a great make ahead recipe. The dense and intense chocolate torte lingers on your tongue followed by the silkiness of the mousse. I live at high altitude so I add a little extra flour to the cake.

I received fantastic reviews for this dessert. I added a cup of chopped mango to the bottom cake layer.

I will never make this again unless I have at least 10-15 dinner guests that will eat ALL of it. It is such a wonderful chocolate dessert.......incrediable. The problem with it is that I cannot stop eating it........every meal I have, I feel like I need to reward myself with a little bit of it........I can't wait for it to be gone.....hopefully tomorrow....I used the rasberries, it was fun to make. Next time though, I would make the cake a few hours before the mousse to allow the cake to cool enough. This one was fine, but it was cold outside, so I was able to put it out on the porch......truly wonderful.....

OH MY GOD! That was the only thing people could say for several minutes after tasting this amazing dessert. That and "you made this?!". I made it over a couple of days, starting with the bottom up. I followed the recipe as written with the exception of the topping. I made a white chocolate whipped cream not unlike one on this site that is served with the chocolate pots de creme (which are also heavenly, by the way) instead. I decorated the cake simply with this topping, raspberries and mint leaves. People couldn't stop raving and I was trying my darndest to be modest but I was even impressed with myself. A winner...BIG TIME! A chocolate lover's dream come true.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner, and am making it again for New Year's Eve. I used half semi-sweet and half bittersweet chocolate in both the cake and mousse, and it was a great combination - not too sweet. Also, when whipping the egg white/sugar mixture I whipped the egg whites until almost done, then added the sugar near the end of the whipping. This is a great recipe - the kids at the first dinner were circling it like vultures!

I gave this three forks only because two of the 8 people I served it to thought it "was to die for"-otherwise it would get 2 forks. The cake portion turned out well. The mousse was grainy most likely because the yolks seperated when heating them over a hot water bath (despite recipe saying this was normal). Also, cake was still very warm when mousse was done, so let mousse sit in fridge to add on to cake the next day. WRONG-it was like a hard, cold brick. Make sure you spread the mousse on the cake as soon as you are done making the mousse.

While I read several reviews complaining about the recipe being time consuming, I like the fact it can be made in stages. I make the base two days before the "event", add the mousse on the day before and the topping and raspberries the day of serving. The raspberries definitely add a beautiful (and delicious) finishing touch. Most people think it came from a professional bakery. I send the leftovers to the office with my husband and his boss always RAVES about this - even two or three days leftover.

Simply fabulous. No dessert has ever gotten such rave reviews. Its time-intensive, and the number one quality indicator is the chocolate-my best results have been with Scharfen Berger 60%.

In the words of one of my guests, "a veritable miracle." Perhaps it helped that I used 70% Godiva chocolate in the recipe :o) A few steps were unfamiliar, but fun to do (even at 2am). The only challenge was NOT licking out every inch of the mixing bowls. I failed the challenge!

I hate to burst everyone's bubble, but this was no great shakes. I know this because there is still some left in the fridge after 3 days (which is usually not the case after 3 hours with a super dessert).

I didn't have a springform, so i made this cake in a 10-inch round cake pan and it worked fine- it was very moist.

Dense, rich (maybe too dense for some?). I used a 9.75" springform pan, and my cake didn't rise much (maybe about half an inch). Refrigerated it overnight before topping it with the mousse. The cake, I thought, was a bit too hardened by the time we ate it. Mousse was tasty though. Used 60% cocoa Ghirardelli baking chocolate chips. Perhaps my expectations were too high because of all the great ratings...

In laws, husband and I all loved this recipe. However, it did give my husband heart burn due to the richness and I was a little nervous about eating raw egg while pregnant. Therefore, the 2nd time around, I made the mousse like this: beat 2 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream to soft peaks. Refrigerate. Bring another 1 cup of heavy whipping cream to boil, and pour over 10 ounces of semi-sweet (or bittersweet) chocolate, finely chopped. Gently whisk until well blended. Let cool and gently fold into whipped cream.

This recipe has to be one of the most spectacular that I've come across in a long time. I would definitely recommend it. However, I had to make the cake twice as my springform pan required a full foil lining to keep the thin batter from leaking out. I would also be sure that the raspberries are dry next time--those near the edge started to fall off.

Rating: 4
The best chocolate cake in the world. I've been searching for a year for the "perfect" chocolate cake, and this is it. I leave off the raspberries because they bleed into the whipped cream. Instead, I use a bag of frozen raspberries to make a raspberry sauce that I serve on the side. Also, I use 1 cup of cream for the whipped cream so there's plenty--3/4 cup isn't quite enough. I have cut this recipe in half and made it in a 6-inch springform pan--(the cake has to cook a little longer). A complete crowd pleaser and a very beautiful, delicious cake.

This is the most amazing, chocolatey, sophisticated cake I have ever made and perhaps one of the best I have ever eaten. I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday. I gave him half the cake to take home and can't keep my hands off the other half (and dietetic is not a characteristic of this scrumptious delight). The cake itself is dense like a brownie, then topped by the lighter mousse and whipped cream...yum. A couple of suggestions/commments: First, I used bittersweet chocolate for the cake, then semisweet for the mousse for variety. I added a couple of tablespoons of Kahlua to the chocolate part of the mousse batter, and one to the whipping cream as well. I might add a little more next time. I topped the cake with sliced almonds and chocolate shavings as I couldn't get raspberries. I don't usually make mousse or merengues so I was surprised that the egg whites took 20 minutes + to fluff up beating by hand, even with adding some cream of tartar. Next time I will use an electic beater. Will definitely make again!!!!!

This cake is a chocolate lover's dream come true. Definetely a "special occasion cake"- a slice is a ticket to chocolate-heaven. I entirely skipped the whipped cream and fruit and loved it.

I've tried many recipes from this site, but never come across one that compelled me to write a review--until this one! WOW, this was the best cake I've had, dense and smooth, kind of a cross between a gooey chocolate brownie and a fine truffle. Mmm-MMM! My only qualm about making it again is that it's expensive--I spent about $25 on all the ingredients.

It was the highlight of my dinner party! Some of my friends came over the next evening because they wanted to fight each other for the leftover piece. It actually spawned a rumor that I was a domestic goddess. And yet, it was so easy. Just remember 1 thing: separate eggs when chilled and allow whites to come to room temp. before you beat them for max volume. I left out the fruit element all together but topped it with a little whipped cream flavored with cinnamon and bourbon (just a splash). The comments my guests uttered in delight aren't even fit to be in print...

Raves all around. I used Scharffen Berger semi-sweet, as that is what I had on hand, as opposed to bittersweet. I thought it may be too sweet, but it was just wonderful. I took another user's advice and used the white chocolate mousse recipe from "Strawberry and White Chocolate Mousse Tart". I skipped the raspberries entirely (although I think they would be very good) and simply topped it with fresh whipped cream and chocolate shavings (time was a factor, and good raspberries just aren't in yet). I rarely give 4 forks, but this deserved it.

Though a bit time-consuming, this torte is sinful and impressive (probably more impressive than the actual effort put in...once you know how to make this, it's a cinch!) For the last cook: I think that the reason why your torte came out flat is because you did not fold the mixture (the wisk could have something to do with it as well); once the egg whites are beaten (and are light and fluffy) you must fold them in with the chocolate otherwise they will lose air and your mousse will not be successful. Trust me; the first time I made this torte I didn't know much about cooking and it wasn't as fabulous as it could have been. At any rate, correct folding procedure makes this mousse fluffy and delicious. Good luck, and by all means, try again!

Could someone please tell me what I did wrong?? I followed the directions exactly but it didn't turn out right, it came out more like a giant flat (1in at most) truffle. Was I suposed to use an electric beater for the eggs to whip air into it (I used a whisk)? I'd like to try this again if someone could give me some pointers. I just don't no what went wrong.

Excellent! I took someone's advice and made a white chocolate mousse instead of the dark (mousse recipe from "STRAWBERRY AND WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE TART" on epicurious.com).

Like many others have said, this was spectacular. Since some previous cooks mentioned difficulty w/the mousse and I haven't made one in a while, I took out some insurance with 1/2 tsp cream of tartar. ;) It turned out perfectly. Covering it w/raspberries would have been too pricey, so I used strawberries & white chocolate. I made a ring around the outside and a small ring in the center, filling the center w/white chocolate curls. It looked pretty and tasted great. Next time, though, I will halve the strawberries to make for easier eating.

this was delicious and very chocolatey. it wasn't too sweet, so you could be sure to taste the chocolate. i allowed people to put on their own whipped cream and i made raspberry sauce to go along with it. everyone thought it was delicious and the other cook of the evening asked for the recipe.

This dessert is absolutely amazing! My husband and I went to a fancy restaurant and had a chocolate almond torte for dessert. I wanted to make the same thing at home it was so good. This recipe tasted just the same, if not better. I used almond extract in place of vanilla. Though I would recommend not trading equal parts vanilla for almond because almond extract is quite a bit stronger. I would use about half next time. But it was SOOOO good. Definitely a 5 fork rating! (if it existed!)

"We made this chocolate cake for a big party. It was so great! It made a wonderful magical chocolate flood ceremony inside your mouth. If you love chocolate you will love this cake. Thats what everyone said at the party". My 7 year old little insisted on submitting his review. I wish to add a grave warning...you will be bombarded to make it for every birthday, housewarming, wedding, funeral, Chess Club meating or Rutherford B. Hays Days event for the rest of your life

Turned out wonderfully, except I made some changes. My boyriend has been asking me to make a chocolate mousse cake that it covered in chocolate for a while now, so i took this recipe and made it up to the mousse part (using semi sweet chocolate for both layers) and then after it was chilled I unmoulded it and froze it as i was making a ganache with really good quality bitter sweet chocolate. I covered it with the ganache and then chilled it again. He said it was the best tasting thing I have ever made, along with others who he allowed to take a peice! definetly a winner!

I have made this several times now and have also tried different variations. When I know that the cake won't be eaten right away, instead of the raspberries, which tend to mold quickly, I use a white chocolate mousse recipe from this website. (just whipping cream and white chocolate) I think that this version is the best way to have this torte. The triple chocolate torte is absolutely AMAZING!!!

Rating: 4
FANTASTIC! This recipe is surprisedly easy, and it's great for entertaining in that practically everything can be done the day before. I used Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate which imparted a wonderful flavor -- it's worth using high quality chocolate for a recipe like this one! Looking forward to making again!

Without any sophisticated skills, just a little patience, anyone can turn out this show-stopping torte.

A nice dessert that turns out looking like the picture. I skipped the raspberries and currants. The only thing remotely difficult about this is heating the yolk mixture correctly, although if that scares you then there are many other easy mousse recipes on epicurious that would work fine on top of a torte such as the chocolate mousse pie. I would recommend making a bottom for this, you can use any of the number of black bottom recipes on epicurious or just stick some oreos into a food processor and bake at 350 for 10 minutes.

both sinful and heavenly at the same time - a chocolate cake not for mere mortals. i made 2 for a friend's birthday party - the both disappeared without problem - and was overwhelmed by the "mmmmm"s and "oh my gosh"'s and moans of ecstasy. the best compliment was the birthday boy, who, after taking the first bite, could only say "holy shit". i don't know how many people told me it was the best thing they had ever eaten or how many proposals of marriage i got. and it was so fricking easy. i didn't do the currant jelly on top but didn't miss it. definitely one to claim as your own.

I'm not a baker, but I decided to make this for a valentine's day dessert-fest. It was remarkably easy, and looked and tasted FABULOUS. Made me look like a pro! I followed someone's advice and substituted white chocolate curls for the out-of-season berries - I dusted the cream with cocoa so that the curls would show up, and it looked beautiful.

Rating: 4
Absolutley yummy - one of the best chocolate desserts I've made...AND, it actually looks just like the photo, but tastes much richer. For how decadent it is, it is fairly easy. To avoid the clumping issue, I added extra water to the jelly (I just used a mixed berry jam that I already had) so it was almost a warm runny liquid -- this gave good flavor to the raspberries and made them look festive. So easy!

WOW! In one word, this cake is amazing. The flavor is intensely chocolate. The texture is rich and creamy. Preparation was suprisingly easy. It sliced easily and presented beautifully. Because fresh raspberries were out of season, I covered the top in white chocolate curls, which looked lovely, and made the torte a triple-chocolate variety. I will never lose this recipe, and I'm certain I'll be making this torte several times a year.

I made this cake a year ago for a wine tasting and it got more rave reviews than the wine! I have made it again and there was a squabble over the last piece! I'm making it again for this year's wine tasting since several repeat attendees requested it. Not too difficult to make - be sure to allow enough time for the cooling.

I made this torte for my best friend's birthday party. The cake, for me, was rather rich--but it was a hit amongst the chocolate mousse lovers; the torte was aesthetically delectable (I topped it off with sugar coated champagne and red raspberries)and satisfying for anyone with a chocolate craving. No one wanted seconds because one slice was enough! But it is a great cake for a medium size gathering.

Fantabulous. This cake was a resounding success with all who touched it. Not a difficult cake to get rid of. People were generally impressed with the quantity of chocolate that went into it. I left out the whipped cream and raspberries because the cream doesn't transport well and my girlfriend doesn't like raspberries. The cream provided a soothing counter to the sturdy chocolatiness of it. I would make it a million times over without changing a thing if I didn't think it would kill me.

If you love chocolate, you'll love this one. I've made it several times, and it's great each time. I've never had a problem with the mousse sliding off. Could it be that it was over-whipped? Made it recently for a dessert open-house and it was the first cake finished! People swooned over it!

This cake was excellent and very easy to make. I made the cake the night before, and the mousse in the morning. It was set by noon. I used strawberries instead of respberries for a change, and didn't need the currant glaze. This will impress company....

Absolutely delicious. It made a fabulous(albeit rich) ending to a dinner party, and was also a nice change from the flourless chocolate cake/raspberry sauce combo that I usually make to satisfy my cravings for those two things. I especially liked the contrast between the dense fudgy cake and the light mousse on top. I think the fresh raspberries were indispensible, as long as they're in season, but I didn't bother with the currant jelly. To compensate, however, I added some sugar to the whipped cream on top (and used a full cup of cream). I also used just four 100g bars bittersweet chocolate (two for the top and two for the bottom - Lindt 70%) in total, which is a few ounces less than the recipe calls for, but it was plenty dark and chocolaty. I am already dreaming about making this cake again...

What a recipe! Easy to make and sinfully delicious. I am making it for the third time in one month because it is fairly simple to prepare and an absolute showstopper. However, I leave off the raspberries and currant jelly. Instead, I top it with strawberries, lightly dust it with powdered sugar and serve along side fresh whipped cream.

I made this for Christmas dinner with friends. It was amazing - everyone loved it.

Everyone who eats this torte RAVES about it. I made it for my mother's birthday and for my daughter's college graduation gathering. Praises just didn't quit coming. The recipe says it feeds 10 but I cut it into 16 pieces and feel that portion is appropriate since the torte is so rich, albeit yummy. I made the torte with and without rapsberries, the second time covering the top with sweetened whipped cream. I liked both versions equally well. This is a super recipe since the torte looks impressive, as if it is difficult to prepare, but really is quite easy to fix. A restaurant quality dessert that is heaven to chocolate lovers, this is the dish for your special occasions.

Another 4 fork review. I made this for an early Valentine's Day dinner party. My friends have come to trust getting a good dessert from me at these events but I usually stick to fruit desserts because I find that after a large meal, no one wants chocolate.

Will make again at the first opportunity.

We did have trouble with the cake sticking to the pan, and we had to use black currant preserves as red currant jelly was not to be found here in Charlotte.

I have a chocolate torte recipe that I just love, but tried this one to see if it was any better. I felt it paled in comparison, so I must reluctantly go against the grain and give this a low score. The chocolate mousse in my recipe is better and easier. Melt 1.5 cups chocolate chips, 1 oz unsweetened chocolate, 1 teasp coffee granules, .25 cup water and 2 tblsp butter over low heat and let cool. Whip 1 cup whipping cream until soft peaks form. Fold whipping cream into chocolate and spread on your base.

I recently made this recipe for a friend's birthday party, and was met with many compliments! I substituted strawberries for the raspberries ( they are not in season here yet) and made a 'strawberry Alexander' sauce ( strawberry puree sauted/flamed with Grand Marnier) to serve along with it. It was very straight forward to make, though it did take a bit of time to complete. However, the results are very well worth the effort!

Excellent flavor, easy to prepare, but I found the cake too dense, too rich, and difficult to cut (was it undercooked, it rose slightly and cracked).

Even as is, the mousse is excellent. I garnished with shaved chocolate.

I made this torte for my mother to take with her to a dinner party. She said that the other guests absolutely loved it, and there was only one tiny piece left when she went home. She even went back for a second piece, and she is on a diet! The only problem that I had was that the sugar that I used to dust the pan acted as a glue when baked, and caused me some difficulty in unmolding the torte. I would skip that step next time. Other than that, this is one that I will make again!

I made this dessert last night for a dinner party and it was one of the most succussful desserts I've ever served - and I am known among my friends for my fancy desserts. My guests raved about it all night and one guest took home a copy of the recipe that I printed out - and is looking forward to making for her friends back home in California. The cake had a wonderful consistency and the mousse was dark and creamy. Some additions: I used a little Amaretto in the mousse (2 TBS - 4 TBS). Also I did like the whipped cream - the cake needs it in my opinion - but I glazed the rasberries with a little apricot preserves warmed with about a TBS of corn syrup. I added this to the rasberries to coat and made a circular border around the edge of the cake and mounded the remaining rasberries in the middle and them piped whipped cream in between the rasberries. It looked like it came from a fancy bakery. This is now one of my all time favorites!

This cake dazzled even the most finicky of my family--me! I am extremely snobby about what is worthy of my time, and this is an A+ dessert! I opted to leave out the currants and didn't bother with the whipped cream topping (to preserve its strong flavor), and it was superb! I plan on using this (probably with white chocolate buttercream icing) as a birthday and general celebration cake--the cake deserves a celebration all its own! Not for the weak of tongue, though--SMALL slices are a must, so you get a lot out of a small cake!

I made this for a New Year's dinner party and was blown away by the reviews I got. This was the first torte I'd ever made, it was a great success. The recipe is perfect as is, I wouldn't change a thing. Being a college student and not having a wealth of experience with this genre, the recipe was fool-proof. Definetly one I'll be making again in the future.

This dessert looked beautiful, was easy to make, and recieved rave reviews from my guests, fellow chocolate lovers like myself. I topped it with whipped cream and then lightly sprinkled it with chocolate sprinkles. I will definately make it again, and look foreward to having fresh raspberries to top it with.

This is one of THE best chocolate desserts I've ever made (or eaten!). I made it for a New Year's Eve dinner party and it was a HUGE success! I didn't have any bunches of red currants nor did I have red currant jelly. I therefore substituted the red currant jelly with a strawberry jelly and it was still delicious! Fresh raspberries are such a great accompaniment to anything chocolatey! I highly recommend this recipe!

It was actually a bit harder than I thought it would be, but easy for a dessert of this quality nonetheless. (Does that make sense?) So I guess I'd have to save this for special occasions. It was a huge hit at my family New Year's Day party, pretty over-the-top compared to the other food we had. I, too, did not have raspberries but it didn't matter. The 3 different textures creates a festival in your mouth. And I'm sure all the calories go straight to your thighs!

There have been numerous chocolate desserts in my history. I think this is the best one I have ever made. Rich, but not too heavy. Chocolatey, but the two chocolate textures balance beautifully and prevent the death by chocolate feeling. Instead of raspberries, I topped it off with fresh whipped cream. Delectable and redoable.

I made this torte for a friend's birthday dinner. There was silence at first... then sighs... then raves... then requests for leftovers. It was truly delicious and easy too. I omitted the raspberries and made chocolate leaves instead, per the birthday girl's request. It was awesome.

Excellent chocolate dessert - but incredibly rich - like a candy bar. Great if you're serving one dessert to chocolate lovers ...

I served this at a dinner party and it received rave reviews. Everyone loved it. The cake is dense and chocolatey and the mousse is smooth and creamy...a delicious combination.
