I love these. I first tried them at Pambiche in Portland, OR and have been making this recipe at home ever since. They're even better when fried in coconut oil and served with banana ketchup, which was surprisingly easier to find than I expected it to be. I found a jar at my local major grocery chain.

Made these last night (did not soak, thought it was weird), smashed them flat with a big can of tomatoes, and served them with a pineapple/roasted red pepper salsa and spicy fried shrimp. Delicious.

Right on, A Cook from Bethesda! I was born in Cuba and raised in Puerto Rico. Make this all the time. If you don't own a "tostonera", try the brown paper bag route. Make sure the oil is very hot for the second round of frying. It is important to sprinkle salt immediately after 2nd frying cycle. Served IMMEDIATELY has a different meaning. It means Right away, Pronto!Buen provecho!

A good idea is to baste them with some crushed garlic before the second frying. It works wonders for the flavor

I make these all the time and we all love them! The true tostones are with GREEN plantains. The best way to flatten the cooked plantain is with a folded piece of brown paper bag. Use the palm of your hand to flatten each one. The paper will absorb some of the oil and that's how it is traditionally done. No need to "dunk" it in warm salted water. Fry tostones is hot oil until golden and sprinkle salt inmediately.

I would skip the salt water dip. My tostones turned to mush. It could have been me, but i don't remember my aunts in Puerto Rico dunking them either.

What an experience! I bought those green bananas out of curiosity and frankly I didn't really know what to do with them... then I learned about "Tostones". It is good, but more bland than sweet. Flatten the plantains with the bottom of a glass as one cook suggested, it is easier. I suggest the "Mojo sauce" as accompaniment. The recipe for the sauce is to be found on this site. If you are looking for something different, well... this is it.

Loved these. I used only 1 plantain to serve 3 people. Cooked in 2 batches.

These were delicious. I used only one plantain for 3 people, and had to do in 2 batches. Served with black bean soup and chili.

My husband makes it a little different. He omits the soaking of the plantains in the salted water. A great easy to make dipping sauce for this is the juice of 1 or 2 limes, some minced garlice cloves mashed to a paste and some coarse salt. Incredible!

These took a while to make, and made my entire apartment smell like slightly burnt vegetable oil for a week, but boy were they tasty. I brought a double batch over to a friend's place for a party, and they lasted about two minutes. They do get soggy pretty quickly, though; I recommend lightly salting them immediately after frying, then reheating them (if necessary) and salting again right before serving.

One week I picked up what I thought to be very green bananas from the grocery store. Much to my surprise they didn't ripen. It seems I had accidentally bought plantains! Well I'm glad I made that mistake because it gave me a chance to try this delicious recipe. I did some things differently however: I soaked the fried pieces in salt water first for about a minute, dried them off and then I smashed them with the bottom of a large glass (that way you can see what you are doing). Crispy, salty and very yummy!
