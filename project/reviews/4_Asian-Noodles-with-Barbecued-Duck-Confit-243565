Really enjoy this recipe. Have made it many times. I use Dartagnan duck leg confit. Like it much better with Chinese long beans if you can find them. The only subsitution that I have made is to use cider vinegar instead of the Chinese black vinegar.

I loved this dish, it was easy for a beginner cook. I made three changes to the recipe. One I used Extra Firm Tofu instead of duck. Two I did not use Sriracha in the glaze, that made it to spicy for my taste. Three I used balsamic vineger insted of black vinegar, but only because I could not find black vinegar. I soaked the Tofu in the glaze before cooking it and then soaked it again after cooking it. It was awesome. Overall I really love this recipe and will make it again.

I made this dish pretty much according to recipe, except I used a duck breast instead of leg confit, augmented with boneless chix thigh. I also substituted rice wine vinegar for black vinegar. This is a wonderful blend of exotic flavors, and the grilled and slightly charred poultry is delicious. You could make it with all chix (my wife preferred it to the duck). It's in my recipe box.

Does the test kitchen know what rice vermicelli is? Because it is not what is pictured in the photo.
