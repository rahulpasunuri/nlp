I pretty much prepared it according to the recipe, but my friend distracted me and I accidentally dropped the cinnamon into the peaches as opposed putting it into the topping. I think that was a good thing because the topping was like crisped almond paste. Big hit with the crowd.

Amaretti cookies come in 2 varieties. Make sure you get the original and not the soft (morbidi) ones

I mad this for a party and it was fabulous. We had picked up some outstanding peaches at a fruit stand which were nicely complemented by the topping. I would cut down on the butter next time, but since it was for guests I made it as is. I used home-made amaretti which turned out well. A nice bonus is that I look for gluten-free recipes, and this is a great dessert that meets that criterion.

So very delicious and so very easy! I really loved the amaretti & almond topping - subtle but wonderful. I made extra to freeze for future use.... I think this topping lends itself to MANY great fruit possibilities.

Try it with apricots or pears. Sublime and easy and, in spite of being a family dessert, very elegant on the taste buds!!!

I made this with strawberries and blueberries since peaches were unavailable. It was wonderful, and so easy. I put it in the oven to bake just as we sat down for the main course, and by the time we were ready for dessert it was done. Vanilla ice cream was perfect with it.

Canned peaches were not perfect but in a pinch they worked out just fine and I would do it again, maybe even try with pears.

This is the type of dessert I really enjoy making. Great taste, yet simple to make.
