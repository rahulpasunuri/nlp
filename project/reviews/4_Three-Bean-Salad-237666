You know you love a salad when you start looking forward to the leftovers while doing the supper dishes. Delicious and healthy too! I love cumin but was afraid this might be too much. It's the perfect amount. Bravo to the creator of this one!

Bright, crunchy and refreshing! The only substitution I made was fresh corn for the black eyed peas. This is a wonderful, healthy summer side.

This is a favorite light dinner for my husband and me. It's quick and easy to prepare, we keep most of these ingredients around in the pantry, and it's really healthy and delicious. I've made a few changes - instead of doing two cups of celery, I usually make it with one cup of celery and one cup of finely chopped carrots, which ups the nutrient factor and makes it even more delicious - plus it makes it even more colorful. I usually heat the oil and add cumin along with some smoked paprika, then throw the garlic into the oil for a few seconds to rid it of that bitter raw garlic flavor. I add a bit more garlic than called for, and increase the lime juice too. I suggest letting it sit for a while after mixing it - the longer it sits the better it gets, which also meas it's GREAT for,leftovers. A total winner in my book!

I followed the recipe exactly - no modifications - and it was fantastic. I can't imagine changing anything. I particularly don't understand why some reviewers are calling for more cumin. If I had added any more than I did, it would have totally overwhelmed the other flavors. Can't wait to try it tomorrow after it's been refrigerated overnight.

This was a hit with Mexican dinner. I didn't have black-eyed peas so I threw in a can of whole corn. Looked pretty and the group loved it.

This is a great recipe, although as written I find the other beans overwhelm the edamame. Edamame salads very popular in delis out here on Cape Cod, and so I adjusted this recipe to follow suit - cut out black beans and black-eyed peas, amping up edamame and then adding fire-roasted corn (Trader Joe's frozen works perfectly). Omitted celery, threw in chopped sundried tomatoes, added some red pepper flakes to the cumin oil for some heat. Perfect for summer snacking or picnics!

Very tasty salad. I've also used baby lima beans when I can't find edamame with good results. Will make it again.

Mmm scrumptious! Cut the oil, increased the lime and cumin per other reviews and it was a big hit. Will definitely be bringing this to pot-lucks/BBQs in the future.

Rating: 4
Be extra careful not to overcook the edamame, al dente ones are best for this salad I think. I also added a bit more lime juice and cumin then call for to up the ante and it worked nicely.

I modified this because I wanted even more of a southwest flavor and more color.

I was assigned to make Three-Bean Salad for a picnic, meaning the traditional canned green and yellow bean salad. I wanted something fresher and more complex, so I used this recipe. I didn't use canned beans; I cooked them fresh, but followed the rest of the recipe, and it was a big hit. I have had many requests for the recipe and would most definitely make it again. It will be in my permanent files for any time I'm asked to bring a veggie salad for a picnic. Such a huge step up from those canned green bean recipes.

I love this dish and the combination of flavors and textures. It's a delicious, healthy and portable lunch. I've taken another reviewer's suggestion to freeze it in individual portions, and that works well. For my taste 1 1/2 teaspoons salt is too much -

I REALLY loved the bright and complex flavors of this salad. I traded out the edamame for canneloni beans and put in 1/2 the oil. All worked well.

This was ok. Added extra cumin.

Have made this many times, both as written and with adjustments. Good both ways. Tonight had no black eyed peas, but added corn, red pepper, more lime juice and less oil. Very good!

I forgot to mention I use only 2T of olive oil instead of 1/4 cup!

This is my go to recipe for potlucks and without fail, people will ask for the recipe. I make the recipe with the listed ingredients, as is. Leftovers are TERRIFIC wrapped in a tortilla, like a burrito. Also, when I make the salad, I double the recipe and freeze leftovers in single serving portions in ziplock sandwich bags for lunches. By lunchtime it's thawed and ready to eat. Works like a charm!

This is a good summer side dish. I made it as written, but substituted garbanzo beans for the black-eyed peas. I do wish that the dressing had a little more flavor. Next time, I am going to add more lime juice, and more cumin. I may put in less oil too. I don't think that added anything.

Rating: 4
This is perfect. I just made it for the fourth time. Usually I prepare it for group picnics or potlucks, but I love it so much that I just made a big bowl all for myself -- I hope I can eat it all before it goes bad! Although other reviewers made changes, I think the recipe is just fine as-is. Try it!

Rating: 4
Wonderful! My new favorite summer side dish! Based on reader comments I decreased oil by half, increased cumin slightly, added feta cheese. This is a great alternative to baked beans for those summer cookouts. It's definately on my "keep" list!

Not sweet like the prepared product, and way better. Reduced oil by 1/2, increased lime juice by alot, added kidney, gabrnazo & cannelini beans, left out black-eyed, used shallots rather than onion, reduced celery, omitted cilantro. Big hit!

Delish! Used what I had, edamame, black beans, corn, and jar of roasted red pepper. Did not have cilantro, but looking forward to trying the recipe again when I have it in stock. Also need to use shallot instead of red onion.

I make a different bean salad with this dressing. Equal parts of vegetable OR olive oil, cider vinegar and sugar, heated until sugar dissolves, cool and poor over salad.

I used a bag of edamame, added red pepper,omitted the the black beans and black- eyed peas, used shallots instead of onions and added the salt to the cumin oil. Yummy! I also made a soup w chicken stock, chicken, ramen noodles and threw in a 1/2 cup of bean salad after it was off the stove. It was a great , light, healthy soup!

Solid, flavorful, healthy and vegan. You definitely need to cut the oil in half, as others recommended. I swapped in pea shoots for celery, but really any crunchy veggie or sprout would work. Cumin seeds and hot sauce were a worthwhile addition.

A fast, easy, and healthy salad that is definitely a winner in my book. I added a little more salt and a dash of chipotle tabasco. This salad went perfectly with grilled salmon. This recipe is a keeper.

Easy, and a hit even with bean haters. Much more interesting than the same-old 3-bean salad. Simple dressing is surprisingly flavorful.

Added a bit of a purchased green salsa and served it with torilla chips, made a good appetizer.

Liked this - certainly very healthy - but found it pretty bland. I needed to add more salt for my personal taste as well as a dousing with Crystal hot sauce. I'm by no means a 3 bean salad connoisseur, I was just expecting more.

This is a wonderful and different version of three bean salad. I brought it to a potluck and was asked for the recipe several times. Be careful when browning the cumin, 30 seconds is really the outside time, if it gets too dark it will ruin the dressing, which happened to me one time and I had to start over.

This recipe is delicious, light and healthy. I received recipe requests after taking it to a cookout. I served it with grilled sausages, but it would also be great with grilled fish or just about any type of meat. Also great on its own. I cut back a bit on the oil and added more lime juice than called for.

Just like the description: fast, easy, fresh. Made at the last minute for dinner as I had most everything on hand. Used cannelini beans instead of b/e peas, and diced hothouse cucumber instead of celery because husband can't eat the latter. Next time will try a bit less oil and more (fresh) lime juice. BTW, I hesitantly used the reconstituted lime juice in the plastic lime because I didn't have any fresh limes left, but it still worked out. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

If you like cilantro, this is the recipe for you! Used organic canned soy beans, but I'm sure the frozen would have been better. Canned are white & small. The larger, green soy beans would have been better.

Tastes fantastic and looks gorgeous! But next time I wouldn't take the time to cook the black-eyed peas from scratch ... canned would have been much easier and probably just as tasty.

Excellent. Cut back celery, added radishes and cucumbers plus decreased garlic. Feta cheese would be a great addition.

This salad is excellent! I first made this recipe because I wanted something healthier than average to bring to a holiday potluck, and it was devoured by all. I've made it repeatedly since and it's perfect for an easy lunch or dinner side. It keeps well for a few days, but I sometimes need to update the seasonings after a day or two. I only use about 2 tbsp of olive oil and add a bit more lime juice to taste and it turns out wonderfully.

I just served this at our end of summer party. My friend gave it to her finicky six year old son. "You like everything in here so please try it. He took one bite, instantly spit it all out. Then he said, "Actually, I think I do like it. ALOT!" aND THEY TOOK A HUGE PORTION HOME.

I was surprised at how good this was! My husband loved it and said it was the best three-bean salad he'd ever had. It was a great side dish to serve in summertime. I made it a couple hours ahead of time to let the flavors come together. (I tasted it 10 mins after I assembled it and it didn't have as much flavor as when I let it set.)

Excellent. I tripled it to serve 20 people for a BBQ. There was plenty of food but many went back for seconds of this salad. Will be on my list from now on. I did reduce the oil slightly and added fresh corn.

Made as per recipe, with about half the celery, which works, but probably 1/ 1/2 cups is best. Awesome, healthy dish perfect for summer picnic or dinner. Eat the left overs all week long as a delicious side dish.

I was really pleased with how this turned out. I made it for a potluck at my office because the majority of my coworkers are vegetarian. It seemed to go over very well, I have had some requests for the recipe. I did not make this exactly as directed, I neglected to toast the cumin, and I used white pepper instead of black. It had a nice kick to it.

Simple dish with interesting, fresh flavors and textures; the celery and cilantro go together well. I have to admit a couple of changes: I halved the amount of olive oil and doubled the amount of lime juice (it just didn't have enough of a kick to it). I served it on a bed of baby spinach. Not sure how it was served in the magazine, but the flavors would go well with a Mexican-themed meal or maybe even Asian.
