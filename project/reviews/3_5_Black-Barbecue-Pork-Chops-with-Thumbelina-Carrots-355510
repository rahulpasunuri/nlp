the sauce is awesome!! I was making it today for the pork I'm serving tomorrow and decided to put a little of it on the salmon I just grilled for dinner. Wow -- who'd have guessed? It was terrific on the salmon (use just a little though...)

The pork was very tender and the complexity of the sauce was surprising. Authentic Mole sauce takes a lot of time and builds flavor through multiple steps. This was a good substitute. We were very impressed. My only change was that I only used half of the jalapeno seeds. It had a nice heat.

The black barbecue sauce was excellent. It was even better the next day slathered over the pork which I pulled apart into smaller pieces. I'm not sure I used the right cut of pork chop, but it worked well.

I did not like this recipe at all. The meat was tasteless even though I left the sauce on for longer than recommended. The sauce served on the side was so hot I couldn't eat it. Bad choice for a fairly expensive cut.

I did not use bourbon or raisins. Next time I would cut the cooking time dramatically. Watch with thermometer. excellent sauce!!!!!
