A very popular addition to my Christmas cookie tray

These are a holiday favorite of mine! I got around the rolling problem by rolling out between two sheets of parchment. I then peel away the scraps around my cut out shapes and bake them right on the parchment so I don't have to worry about transferring them individually to the sheet and ruining the shapes - and I can make them super-thin.

Please help!! I loved the flavor, but could not for the life of me get the dough to roll out. I finally resorted to stretching it out directly on the cookie sheet with my hands just so I could cook and eat it! There has to be a trick.... Anyone?

The dough require attention, but the cookies rank in the top spicy-cookie category! This has been a favorite since '97.

I didn't have any of the problems described by earlier reviewers. My boyfriend and I loved the intense flavors, but my mom found them too strong. Definitely frost them-- they aren't quite sweet enough otherwise.

I approached this recipe with trepidation since I have a healthy respect for other people's baking disasters and hear the high level of frustration from Conn and Hawaii - been there! But, even though I didn't see how such a moist dough could possibly roll out, they were extremely easy to work with (I used plenty of flour when rolling them out). I wonder if type of flour or measuring technique might have made a difference for those who had problems. I know Gourmet used to specify spooning flour into measuring cups lightly, not scooping a la Julia Child. It's so much easier to bake using weight, I wish these recipes would give measurements in grams too.

I gave these out in my christmas baskets, and they were a hit. I cut them in stars and put them in star shaped boxes - paired with my canned spiced pear sauce. I have made them twice and both times they were great. I'm making them today and serving them with ginger ice cream.

Delicious! I made these with my superfly neice. Although she didn't don the baker's hat (no sweat, I was second in line), she loved playing with the dough. Perfect for the weird cookie cutters she pulled out of grandma's drawers. (Angels and reindeer circa 1945.) We didn't add the cloves only because they weren't available. But still, a winner with all the neighborhood crew. I gladly jumped in the fray to fight for the last headless elephant.

I agree with the reviewer from Hawaii (if that makes her feel any better!). I did not like this recipe at all and am very disappointed with it. I think I do not have the patience or the ability to roll the dough as thin as it is supposed to be. The recipe says that the cookies should be baked until they are "crisp." But I checked after the required time, and they were still spongy. So I baked them longer. Now they are all hard, dark brown lumps. I have one more disk of dough in the fridge, but I think I will just throw it away because these cookies are too annoying for me to bother with.

This is the only gingerbread cookie recipe my husband will eat. My son, who hates anything that isn't bland liked them. Go figure. I loved them too.

This is the first time I've made a dish from this site (and I've made dozens) where everyone else loved it and I totally disagree. I feel like maybe I did something wrong ?? but I followed the recipe to the letter - accurate oven temp, dough the right thickness, parchment paper, no overbaking. The flavor of the cookies was excellent but the texture was totally unacceptable. They were not crisp but sort of soggy chewy, when baked according to directions. So I tried baking them a minute or two more. Then they were still not crisp...but hard and totally unappealing. We threw the entire batch out. It seems like maybe the recipe needed more butter for the amount of flour called for. Who knows.

These are great - and everyone in my office seems to agree. I decorated them with colored sugars, a simple way to make them look festive. They were easy to make, and the dough held up well to several rollings without needing to be re-refrigerated. I actually replaced half the butter with shortening; this may have added to the crispness. This one is a keeper!

These turned out really well. I left out the coffee and sprinkled the cookies with sugar before they cooked. When I tasted the dough, I thought they were going to be icky, but once they cooked they were great. I also didn't do the parchment paper but used non-stick cookie sheets and reduced the temp to 325.

Although I enjoyed the cookies, I think next time I make them I'll cut the amount of black pepper in half. I was surprised that my 17-month-old liked them so much! Begged for them :-)

These ginger cookies are wonderful if you like a full spicy cookie -- they really stand out from the crowd!

These cookies have a wonderful peppery after-taste. However, I would add more ground ginger
