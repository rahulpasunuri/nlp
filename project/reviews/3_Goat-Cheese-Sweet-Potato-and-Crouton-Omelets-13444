This was ok but maybe overstuffed. As another reviewer said, roasting the sweet potatoes in your choice of herbs is one alternative. I would also dice the red onion. I find store-bought croutons too salty but next time I will make the croutons ahead of time and halve the size; they were too bulky. In fact, I might even cut out the croutons all together and just serve with crusty bread.

This was quick and easy! I, too, added the croutons last, and they stayed nice and crispy, just the right amount of give. I used the whole 4 oz. package of chevre as well as a little extra bread, 'cause that was the size I could find. Delish, and my kitchen stayed nice and cool on this hot summer day (I used the toaster oven for the croutons).

I really liked this, very interesting, and I love sweet potatoes, but my husband found them disturbing. He asked that I use white potatoes and green peppers next time, making it more traditional, but we both ADORED the goat cheese. I added the croutons last as suggested, to great effect. I will modify a bit next time.

I thought this was delicious. It's a wonderful combination of flavors--very original. The melted goat cheese was divine!

In Spring 1997, I came across this recipe which I tried with some hesitation. My family loved it! It was so easy, so light, perfect for a hot weather meal! It is still one of my favorites when I am short on time, energy, or ideas... One thing though, I add the croutons at the end because we enjoy them very crunchy!

We had had a similar dish at a restaurant in Vancouver and loved it, so we decided to try it here. Yum! Some suggestions: we used store-bought croutons to speed up the process, but they got a little soggy. Leaving them out of the filling mixture until right before folding the eggs over the top would improve the texture for a fun crunch. Also, we didn't boil the yam, we roasted them after tossing them with a mix of salt, pepper, herbes de provence and maple syrup.
