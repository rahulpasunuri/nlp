Although it is time-comsuming to make, it is delicious. It was a big hit at my book-club holiday party.

Served at a dinner party to people who cry if dessert isn't chocolate. Not only no crying but rave reviews and it was gobbled down. Used bottled bourbon caramel sauce, but will probably make my own peach ice cream and caramel sauce next time. Definite keeper.

I have made this several times, without the peaches and it is so delicious! I especially love the crust.

I made this for a Girl's Nite party and everyone loved it. I agree with others that the caramel sauce and crust were exceptional. Be careful to watch the caramel closely, and don't let it boil too hard. I used Bryers peach ice cream and thought the flavor was a delicious compliment to the pecans and crust. I will DEFINATELY make again!

Great summer dessert! I used fresh peach slices alternating with whole pecan halves to adorn the top of the pie. Yes, the crust was super!

The caramel sauce was fantastic and easy to make! I received rave reviews about the crust, although be careful about it being too thick in the corners, where the bottom of pan and sides meet. It can be a tad hard to get through with the spoon, although still crumbly and delicious to eat. The peach was definitely noticeable (I used breyers Peach ice cream). However, that was the part I could do without. In the future, I think a coffee or mocha fudge ice cream would put this pie over the top. I will make it again soon, but with that one change.

Everyone loved this. It was very easy, delicious, and made a beautiful presentation. I made it for my in-laws and they just loved it. The crust was out of this world. I used the leftover homemade caramel sauce for dipping sliced granny smith apples and also to add to my morning coffee. Yum!

This was just OK. It was very easy to make and looked impressive, but I would have been happier with just a bowl of peach ice cream.

I made this for a dinner party with children, and it was a big hit with everyone, even the toddlers. I made it with Shamrock Farms Old Fashioned Peach ice cream, which was a perfect blend with the other flavors. The recipe was very simple to make.

The first time I made this recipe I found the peach flavor lost with the caramel and crust so the second time I added some personal touches. I added diced peaches to the icecream and made a peach sauce and drizzled on with the caramel. The results were excellent.

I loved this b/c it was so easy to make and tasted great. Served it for a dinner party and the guests raved on and on. I did cheat a bit and use Mrs. Richardson's jarred carmel sauce, but I doubt it mattered. A great combination of flavors for summer.

Great dessert. Had it with 3 different groups of guests and all liked it, 2 raved. The peach ice cream seemed to get lost with the pecans and the oh so delicious caramel sauce. I think I would put some fresh diced peaches in next time.

I brought this dish to a barbeque potluck and got rave reviews. I thought the caramel sauce and the crust were out of this world. I couldn't find my favorite brand peach ice cream which would have given my attempt a four fork rating. I think this will be just as good with butter pecan or vanilla ice cream. I will definitely try again as it was easy to make but time consuming.

I made this recipe with no changes and was a bit dissapointed with the results. It was easy to make, but the crust, pecans, and caramel sauce totally overwhelmed the very good peach ice cream I used. The other flavors are great, but I was expecting to taste peach too. I'd just use vanilla next time.

I must be honest. I changed around my ingredients but it was the best dessert ever!! I used vanilla icecream and walnuts...All together it was as easy as pie and delicious!!! I served it at a dinner party and my guests were licking their plates....LOL :)

This is an easy to put together ice cream pie. I substituted sugar free carmel sauce for the carmel sauce receipe and found it to be just as good and with much less sugar. THis one goes in my file.

We had this WONDERFUL pie at a dinner party last week. It was so attractive and delicious that everyone practically inhaled their portion. I will make the pie for company this weekend, and many times after that. This is a real keeper-recipe.
