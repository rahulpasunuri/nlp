I pretty much followed the recipe , only changing the quantaties and making larger portions. I thought it was very good and both my husband and I loved the salsa and the added Yogurt. Will make again. Very quick and easy.

Dish came out four forks with the following changes: Added sliced red onion to chicken and pepper saute. Marinated chicken strips (I had thighs so used them) in the following: lime juice, olive oil, garlic salt, cajun seasoning and pepper. Then saute chicken in the marinade with pepper and onion strips till things started to caramelize. No need to put oil in the pan first, as marinade has oil in it. Also a cast iron skillet achieves good caramelization results for this dish.

Very easy and tasty. I doubled the jalapeno and it had a nice bite. Next time, I'll grill the chicken to give it even more flavor.

This is a great recipe. I have made this over and over. It tastes great and easy to make. I have also used the avacado salsa as a side dish served with chips.

I was also very pleasantly surprised at how delicious this recipe was! The only change I made was to add a bit of fajita seasonings to the chicken. The salsa was delicious (I caught my husband eating it by itself) and the yogurt added a surprising richness which was very satisfying. A great, healthy, really delicious meal! I'll definitely make this again and again.

This was a nice surprise...very tasty and the cold yogurt gave it a nice feel. I did not use cilantro and would say to add some cayanne pepper or something to spice it up if you want spicy

This recipe is fantastic and has joined "the rotation." Can easily substitute green peppers for the red or yellow. We also enjoy things a little more spicy and thus tend to add some extra hot peppers. High ratings on everything: nutrition, presentation, taste!

I wish there was a 3.5 fork rating. This was delicious. Not very spicy though. I might season the chicken a little next time or add more jalapeno to the salsa. The yogurt was surprisingly good on them. YUM YUM YUM

This one is a gem. I used about half an avocado for the salsa, and substituted green bell peppers and onions for the yellow/red peppers as I wanted a little more bite.
