I used the cake recipe to make my daughter's birthday cake. It is the second time I made this and everyone loved it. I cut down the sugar by 1/4 cup. I used a bavarian cream filling with strawberries and made a buttercream frosting and it came out amazing.

I made this cake for my mom's birthday. I'm fairly new to baking and this cake was not difficult to make. I made the almond cream filling 2 days in advance and the cake and frosting one day before it was served. I like to cut down on sugar in my cakes and pastries. I followed the recipe exactly. The cake was not too sweet and was absolutely DELICIOUS. If you prepare the filling in advance and spread your work over the course of a few days, it won't be that much work. I also like the fact that there isn't much decorating that needs to be done, since the berries go on top. I will make this again and again.

Exceptional cake! I've made it several times and it gets easier each time. Be sure to read the recipe through a few times and map out your plan. Everyone freaks out about this cake, and I won a best-tasting cake contest with this recipe!

Yes, I froze my cakes a couple of days earlier. I wrapped them in Glad Wrap and aluminum foil. I defrosted without unwrapping (to prevent condensation on the layers). So go ahead and freeze your cake layers. By the way I've frozen cake layers for a whole year with no ill effect, in fact many guests at the party said it was the best cake they ever ate in their lifves and they could not believe it had been frozen for an entire year. Just be sure to wrap your layers properly

I finally had a fitting occasion to make this very expensive cake($35 for the ingredients without including the cost of amaretto). I made my own almond paste rather than using store bought. I also substituted almond oil for extract, using only one fourth the amount since it is much stronger. My filling looked nothing like the photos in the magazaine which shows dollops of filling. Mine was like a thick custard which poured onto the layers. I was a little short on eggs so I rounded up the amount of eggs with egg yolks, but I don't think that would have contributed to the consistency of the filling. To compensate for the runny texture I chilled each layer as I constructed the cake. To the frosting I added a tablespoon of Amaretto to give the frosting another layer of flavor. As another reviewer noted the cakes do squash down with the weight. My cake did not look as high as the one in the photo. This cake was a great hit. I saved a piece for myself which I ate the following day. The frosting tasted like really good cheesecake! The cake improved with age and I would consider putting this cake together a day early. I might adapt the frosting to make a cheesecake with almond crust and using the raspberry preserves as a topping under the berries. The berries make the cake, be sure to include enough of them with every slice. I didn't have any currant jelly on hand to glaze the berries which really didn't matter.

Question: Has anyone had success with making the chiffon cake ahead of time and freezing it to fill and frost at a later time?

This cake was marvelous. It takes quite a bit of time and I needed to re-read the recipe several times during the different stages of prep. The results were worth every minute. It was fun, challenging, and delicious. I followed the recipe to the letter with great results. My custard did cook more quickly than indicated. I would not hesitate to make this again for a special occasion.

I made this cake yesterday... It was so much work that I thought it would be very good. Was a little dissapointed and definitely have cakes that I prefer. The cream cheese frosting is too sharp for the cake and overwhelms the filling, which is really good and made with marzipan and white chocolate. The cake is great too, and I would re make the cake without the custard and icing, and use with a different icing for cupcakes as other reviewers did. The fruit on top is essential to this cake otherwise it is too heavy. There is too much frosting for the cake, I would 1/2 the cream cheese icing recipe or not use it at all. Overall pretty good but not a huge fan of the frosting :) Would make the custard and the cake again :) Take four hours and try it out. :)

I made this for a friend's "garden party" and everyone raved. It is time consuming so be sure you allow plenty of time. Because there were going to be 18 guests & it only serves 14 I made a double recipe which yielded 23 cupcakes in addition to the 2 91/2' rounds. I cored out the cupcakes (get tool at Williams-Sonoma) and filled w/the almond cream filling. I only 1 1/2x the filling & frosting recipes & I had plenty leftover.

The balance of the almond and vanilla is wonderful and the icing is great. I was worried that it would be too sweet, but it was fine. I also made this in stages. It's a really beautiful cake and my guests were very impressed by the way it looked and tasted. I would make it again--maybe next time during berry season because it was also a bit expensive to make!

The filling and frosting are especially good,and I didn't have any trouble with sliding. I thought the cake was better on day 2, after some liquid from the filling had time to seep into the cake layers. The filling / frosting use a lot of vanilla and almond extract. USE TOP ingredients here - I used supermarket brand and noticed the slight chemical taste. I may use the filling / frosting recipes again and alter by adding other flavorings (Amaretto, cointreau, etc).

I made this cake for a friend's birthday. It turned out beautiful and got rave reviews!! I did not chill the filling as long as necessary after adding the whipped cream and did have a sliding probelm - I inserted 4 drinking straws to stabilize and chiled overnight. Once I removed the straws the holes were covered by the frosting and berries. I used a saw toothed edge comb (for cake decorating) on the sides and piped ruffle around top and bottom of cake. It was definelty worth the time and effort. I reccomend making it in stages as the cake and filling can be made ahead of time. This recipe is a keeper for special occasions!

I bake very often, and this is one of the very best cake recipes I have come across. It will take you a considerable amount of actual working time, but it is well worth it! You must follow the recipe exactly. Taking the shortcuts other people have suggested will inevitably reduce the cake's quality.

Delicious cake, I thought the frosting was a little heavy on the cream cheese flavor, may cut cream cheese or up extracts. Made the cake in steps....filling one day, frosting the next, as recommended by other contributors. Worked out very well. Lemon zest was a nice perk to almond in the cake. Delicious! Will make again and again.

This is possibly the best cake I ever made. Looks professional and tastes so delicious. I made as written but substituted mascarpone cheese for cream cheese in the frosting. Worth the work.

4 stars for the chiffon cake. i tweaked this recipe slightly. i did not make the almond cream cheese frosting as i felt it would be too heavy and wanted to incorporate strawberries which were in season. a strawberry mascarpone frosting and strawberry filling was used instead. for the filling, i omitted the almond paste and added about 4 tablespoons of fresh strawberry puree. if you're a comfortable baker, the cake is a fairly simple recipe. have all the ingredients ready to go, and make sure the egg whites are at room temperature. i've used this recipce for cupcakes before and they turned out light and fluffy. it's also a great recipe for roulade cake.

Delicious! I actually made a double batch of this to be used for a small three-tiered wedding cake for an engagement party. I made the filling a day in advance and chilled it overnight. I had no problems with any slipping. I followed the recipe to the letter, but I ended up with a ton of leftover filling and frosting, so you could even halve the recipe and be fine. After making the cake, I tasted more lemon than almond, but after a day, the cake had a stronger almond flavor, so I recommend making a day in advance, and letting the flavors fully develop. Doubling the recipe suggests that it would serve 28. 9 of us polished off the whole thing!

I made this for my sister's birthday. On the whole, it was a picturesque cake and a grand success. If you plan accordingly, the cake isn't too time consuming. I made the almond cream filling the day before, chilled it for more than 3 hours, returned to it to add the whipped cream and left it in the fridge for the rest of the night until ready to use the following day. I did not encounter any problems with the cream being too runny, and thus did not have any of my cake layers slide (as some other reviewers had happen to them). As long as you chill the pastry cream thoroughly, you will not have this problem. However my only criticism would be the lack of almond flavour being detected in any component of the cake... and this was after I had already made my own changes to the recipe. For the extracts, I increased all the amounts by 1/8 tsp. For the cake itself, I ground up 1/2 cup blanched almonds and incorporated that into the mixture. Even with these alterations, the almond flavour was still very faint. I used 3 9-inch round baking tins instead of the 2 10 -inch tins and it came out just as well-- but watch the baking time as it is shorter. Finally, as other reviewers mentioned, do not forget to reserve 3/4 cup of the almond cream filling for the frosting.

I have made this several times over the years, and everyone always raves about it. Even the people in my family who "don't like cake"(psh) specifically ask for this on special occasions. Everyone keeps talking about how difficult and time-consuming it is... but it's really not so bad if you plan ahead and spread the work out over a couple of days. It takes more time than simpler cakes, but it's not really more difficult... and the result is so worth it!

This cake is a fabulous crowd pleaser! I've made it three times and it gets easier each time. Now, I can whip it out in little time. The texture of the cake is light and airy, something like a twinkie. I added one layer of plum jam that was delicious with the almond. Be sure to read through the entire directions before making, as some of the filling must be saved to make the frosting, but that is not mentioned in the list of ingredients for the frosting.

I just finished making this cake for a friend's anniversary. I had made the cake itself, which was very good, but gave a butter cake flavored with almond as the gift. The cream filling and frosting were easy to prepare. However, this cake, like most cakes, takes some planning. I made the cream filling the day before the day before, as well as the cake. I filled and frosted the day of the party. The frosting was particularly easy to make and very easy to frost with. I topped the cake with red raspberries. Rave reviews from guests. I plan on making this cake again, but only if I have the time to do so. It really is spectacular, just not great if you are short on time.

Rating: 2
I can't comment on the cake itself, as I used a lemon chiffon and omitted the jam, but the filling and frosting, while delicious, were very rich, somewhat overpoweringly so: I'm glad I didn't use almond extract, as the almond flavor almost overpowered the berries! While I love the flavor of almonds, I'd have preferred it as a filling for something simpler, and the frosting makes a wonderful fruit dip, if used judiciously.

I picked this recipe before I really realized how much work it would be, and it took forever... but it was so worth it. My grandfather (whose bday I made it for) claimed it was one of the best cakes he had ever had, and made me promise to make it again. Don't skimp on the berries, and don't leave yourself tight on time, and I PROMISE you'll be pleased.

so for my grandma, i wanted to make an awesome cake that the elderly would love. and believe me they LOVED it. i thought it would be too sweet with the frosting, so i just used whipped cream. the trick with the almond paste is to food process it with the flour and sugar.or else it be all lumpy. i also first choped the chocolate, and then food process it. but not too long or else the chocolate will stick together. also i substiuted the almond extract with Amaretto liquer, and it jus made it soo much better. it took soo much patience. - _____- but in the end it was worth it.

I made this cake twice... out of necessity. The first time I followed the directions exactly and it turned into a sliding mess. It tasted great but looked awful and was time consuming. At that point I was very short on time so I used several shortcuts that made it turn out nearly as good and in about 1/4 the time. For you die-hard-cook-from-scratchers out there, I realize my method will leave me open for ridicule, so please don't. I used a french vanilla boxed cake mix, added the almond extract and a splash of vanilla extract and baked. Then, used pre-made cream cheese frosting and also added almost extract to that. When the cakes cooled, I actualyl scooped out about 1/4" of the lower layer, leaving about 1/2 rim around it. Bear with me! Then, spooned in some raspberry preserves that I'd had sitting in a little warm water to make softer, added some boxed jello vanilla pudding (which I also added some almond extract to) and a thin layer of cool whip. When I put the other cake layer on top, it effectively sealed in the filling and I was able to frost with the cream cheese frosting and add my berries. Unconventional I know, but I made it to the party and everyone RAVED about my cake and asked how I did it. Hope this helps some of you bakers who are always short on time like me.!

I made this for a Fourth of July barbeque and appreciated all the previous reviews and suggestions. There is no doubt it is labor intensive and I suggest doing this in stages. I made the almond cream two days before, the cake the night before and the icing the morning of the barbeque. It truly isn't difficult ;just takes awhile. Be sure to read the entire recipe ahead of time. It is also an expensive cake to make. It is very good but I'm not sure I would categorize it as exceptional.

There are a few huge problems with this recipe. First, it's just too complicated and it takes too long to make. Second, the recipe isn't clear. As other reviewers have noted, you need to reserve some of your almond filling for the frosting. This should be more explictly indicated. Second, the chilling times and the consistency of the fillings is CRITICAL to the success of this cake. Even if you do everything right, it still may fail. The cake is pretty good, but it's just not worth the hassle. It's not THAT good.

This is definitely an impressive looking cake, and it tastes incredibly delicious. I've tried to make it three times. It's VERY time consuming and you definitely need to make all the ingredients the day before, and assemble and frost the cake the next day. Somehow though, I've never successfully been able to make this cake without the layers sliding, even with the 3 hr chill time after putting the filling on the first layer of cake. The whipped cream in the filling makes it so soft the cake almost needs to be assembled and frosted in the refrigerator. Does anyone know how to firm up the filling so I don't have the slippage problem? What am I doing wrong?

Rating: 4
I have just made this recipe for the 3rd time and I think it is fantastic. I made one change in technique which I think solves the problem of lumpy almond paste: process the almond paste with the flour and sugar in the food processor, until you have a sand-like consistency. I even blended the eggs into it right in the bowl of the food processor, then the vanilla bean cream. Adding the warm cream to the sugar-egg mixture is called "tempering" and should prevent the cooked-egg consistency of the filling

I made this for a baby shower last summer and it was a show stopper. I got more compliments on this cake than anything else I made. It was a conversation stopper. Everyone just stopped talking and enjoyed the cake. The cake flour really is responsible for a light cake, so don't substitue AP flour. Also, buy good quality almond paste. You can make the cake and frosting a day ahead of time.

I agree that this cake might not travel well, if you follow the recipe---there might be slippage between layers. My almond filling didn't firm up after folding in the whipped cream! I must've under whipped the cream. Anyhow, I wasn't too concerned since I knew the pan would provide structural integrity (I made this into a 10 x 12 sheet cake, which I served out of the pan). It sat in a cooler with two ice packs for 4 hours, and looked and tasted great. The recipe proportions were bang on for a 10x12, although I did have frosting leftover since I only had the top to frost. That's ok, the neighbourhood kids thought it was delicious the next day on cake mix cupcakes. It is amazing how that lovely almond cream transforms the frosting from 'eew, too cheesy!' to 'mmm, is there cream cheese in this?'.

This cake was absolutely delicious. I did not use the berries, since they were not really in season and would have added a lot of cost, and not have been as good as they would be in June (& therefore not worth it). I'll use them if I make this in the summer, though. Anyhow, it was a fantastic cake....delicious and really pretty easy to make. My one thing: Be sure to sufficiently chill between layers, during assembly....I rushed it and my cake slid a little. Still was just soooo good. The filling added to the frosting was a great boost for the frosting. More like 3.5 forks....I use 4's very seldom...only for the truly remarkable, and this was close.

This is the best cake I've ever had or made. It was an incredible amount of work but so worth it! I cheated and used a white box cake mix and added almond extract for flavor and it was still wonderful. I did not leave enough time to fully chill my filling so although I did put some in the middle of the cake I also served slices with a scoop of filling and it was wonderful!! Next time I'll make sure to prepare this ahead so my layers won't be sliding around! Everyone loved it!

I made a 14-inch version of this cake to feed 30 for a graduation party. I made a yellow butter cake instead of the chiffon, I hate the taste of chiffon cake (too many box cakes fed to me as a child), but for everything else I followed the recipe. BE CAREFUL to reserve about 1/3 of the almond pastry cream for the frosting. That's not clear in the directions, until it's too late! The cake was a spectacular sucess visually and on the plate.

Twelve hours of work to make this amazing cake and most of it was devoured within one hour! I made it for my mother's birthday and received overwhelming raves. Its a special cake that takes some time but is well worth the effort. I'll bet it gets easier the more you make it, because there are a lot of steps involved. Do yourself a favor and make what you can ahead of time. The custard is sublime, the frosting, combined with the custard, is not too sweet or "cream cheesey" tasting. The layers of raspberry preserves on the sponge are the perfect compliment to the delicate- tasting custard. Instead of the fresh berries, I garnished the frosted cake with toasted, sliced almonds. Fabulous. I will certainly make it again and dear husband is already dropping hints for another one :) Enjoy!

I made this cake for the New Year party, it was delicious! The filling was alittle lumpy at first but then it came out very well. The combination of the white chocolate filling and the almond paste is delicious. Everyone still asks me to make the cake again, almost a year later. ALTHOUGH, I did not top it with fruits as I thought it would overpower the almond flavor and the filling. The berries DON'T make sense. Acording to some reviews here, I see that I made the right choice of not using the berries. But overall exceptional cake, delicate and nice flavor. Oh and the sponges couldn't be better!

Rating: 3
The flavors in this recipe are exceptional. I loved the mix of almond, raspberry and cream cheese. I recommend using a double boiler for heating the custard so that you DON'T boil the eggs. Rochester cook is right - eggs curdle. Use the double boiler to slowly heat the custard to about 160 degrees. Also, the cake layers flatten the longer you leave in the fridge. I left it for a day and don't recommend it. The layers weren't nearly as fluffy as they were the last time I made it.

The cake was fantastic, however the filling instructions make no sense. I tried to bring my egg mixture to a boil- eggs curdle, people! I imagine if you tried it in a double boiler and didn't bring it to a boil but used a thermometer to determine when the eggs are done it might be okay. The frosting was too creamcheesy, perhaps because I didn't add the filling to the frosting. A better frosting recipe includes less than half of the cream cheese called for, and much more powdered sugar. Might make just the cake again- very light/fluffy.

This cake was great. I have made it 3 or 4 times and it is always a great hit! I live in Baltimore, which during the summer months is known for high humidity. I made it last year on July 4, which was amistake. It was 104 degrees outside with high humidity. Naturally, the cream cheese frosting did not hold up well at all, but then other then a fondant topping, nothing would have held up well. As far as getting enough batter, it is truly important to whip those egg whites to a stiff peak, otherwise the batter deflates quuickly. Also important to have a absolutely clean bowl and whisk.

This cake was a gorgeous main-event for a baby-shower I hosted. It wasn't hard to make at all, just time-intensive. I could eat that Almond Cream filling with a spoon, it's so good! The cake was very well received and impressive, and while it was a little difficult to work with the frosting (I think I should have chilled it before frosting the cake; it needed more body to build up that 'high wall') it wasn't really hard to assemble. I did make 3 9-inch layers since those were the pans I have, and it turned out nice and tall. I will make this cake again, and will probably use the cake recipe as my standard chiffon cake.

After reading all of the rave reviews, I was sure I would love this cake. I thought it was all right. I like a sweeter caker than this. The filling turned out okay, not pasty. My suggestion for it is to dice the paste into pretty small pieces. My paste did not totally dissolve which left some small whole pieces in the filling. You couldn't really notice them once the cake was put together. I didn't get a strong taste of white chocolate. When I measured out the batter to out into the pans, I did not have as much as I was supposed to. Maybe I didn't beat the egg whites long enough but they still rose quite a bit. The frosting came out good although I put extra sugar in to sweeten it (still not enough for my tastes!). However, the berries on top really made the cake look pretty and the berry flavors went really well with the almond flavoring (I put 1/2 t.). I wasn't disappointed that I made it but probably wouldn't make it again. I also made the p. butter mousse cake from this site and that got scarfed down right away while this cake sat there. The p. butter one is much easier! :)

Made the cake and frosting, but omitted the almond cream due to the time commitment. This simplified the recipe A LOT due to the long chilling time required for the cream. Just simply use the frosting as a filling. The cake recipe is great! VERY light and airy - a perfect "party cake" type cake. Frosting was great too, but only if you really like cream cheese (fyi - I simply omitted the 3/4 cup almond cream from the frosting recipe and it turned out fine). I am definitely keeping this in my recipe file for "party cakes" - I think it would be fine to omit the almond extract (from the cake and frosting) for a more traditional yellow cake. Enjoy!

The filling did turn out a bit too pasty and the quantity of the batter wasn't enough to accurately fill the pan mentioned. So instead use a slightly smaller pan and use less almond paste. Otherwise the end result was a hit, looked absolutely beautiful and was gobbled up. I'd definitely make it again.... if I had a couple of days to prepare everything.

I made this cake for my church's annual cake contest/auction, the cakes are tasted then auctioned off with the winnings given to missions. The cake won first place and was sold for $210. I didn't get the chance to taste the completed cake, but I was happy to eat the leftover filling. Next time I make this cake though I'm not giving it away!

I am not a big cake fan, but this is just gorgeous and so nice and moist! (Moister than it looks, I think.) I got a lot of compliments on it and will definitely make it again.

i made this cake for a birthday party where the person wanted white cake with white frosting - well, there was nothing but raves on this cake! it has been less than a week and amiable spouse has requested it again! it is time consuming but if you space it out it's okay over a couple of days - just be sure that the cake is chilled the amount of time requested or it can slip! i varied the berry toppings according to what i found fresh from the farmer's market

What an incredible cake!! I made it for 4th of July and still can't get over how gorgeous it's looked. The almond flavor was incredible, the cake very moist. I had a lot of frosting left over for some reason and ended up eating every bit of it spoonful by luscious spoonful. Yes, it is time consuming and a bit costly but oh, so worth it!!!

I thought that this recipe was pretty good but I thought that the filling and frosting was too pasty, it didn't quite achieve that rich almond creamy taste that I expected. The chiffon cake was very tender and moist, but again, the flavor didn't live up to my expectations.

This cake was a lot of work (and took a lot of prep and waiting time), and the end result was just "eh." Definitely wouldn't bother making this one again.

I made this cake to follow a birthday dinner at a restaurant. With pleasure I told the waiter that we would be going back to my deck for cake. It took a long time to make but it was worth it and the lemon rind really made it. Everyone was blown away (and some of them are pretty fussy). People still tell me it was the best cake they have ever tasted. Definately make it!

This was a very impressive cake. I made it for a family reunion...it was the only dessert that disappeared within minutes. My uncle said that it was the best cake he'd ever eaten! The only changes that I made to the recipe were these: I used seedless black raspberry jam instead of red raspberry, I added Ranier and Bing cherries to the berries on top of the cake and I omitted the red currant jelly glaze. No, it is not a cheap or fast cake to make but I very rarely bake so I was able to justify the time and expense required to make this dessert.

Wonderful cake. Very intense flavor. Loved by all.

I served this cake at a baby shower and everyone was blown away. There was about a quarter of the cake left after the party and the few remaining friends hauld it out of the fridge and devoured it. Make sure you start this cake the day before, it was definitely labor intensive but well worth the effort!

We don't have cake flour in Australia and substituted self raising - don't think it worked as well! You don't know where I can source cake flour do you?

I first had this at a bunco party -- incredible cake!

this was the most delicious cake i have ever made myself. my family was dubious watching me slave away all day for one cake but they all agreed after serving themselves seconds it was well worth it! I am making it again next week for my dad's office party. it really is the perfect party cake!

Expensive and time consuming--but I wouldn't hesitate to make it again! This cake was perfect for summer: light, refreshing and not too sweet. It wasn't hard to make either, just be sure to set aside plenty of time to make it. Before you start, though, be sure to read the instructions carefully. Example: you have to put in an uneven amount of batter in the cake pans and part of the filling must be set aside for incorporating into the frosting. But for all the work and time you put into it, you will be justly rewarded!

I used three 9" pans and had a little frosting left over. I made this to take to work for two of my c0-workers birthdays, everyone loved it. In order to transport it, I used a dowel rod in the center to keep the layers from sliding around in the car.

This was an excellent cake. I made it just to see if I could do it. I shared it with the neighborhood and they all loved it. It was a lot of work, but well worth it. I'll make it again soon.

Haven't made this recipe yet, but it looks wonderful. Anyone know why it requires two different thicknesses of pans/cake layers ? Any harm in making 3 even 9" layers, even at the risk of making them thinner and having some left over batter ? (I don't have 10" cake pans)

I made this cake for a birthday celebration and my family loved it. I also used 9 inch pans but measured the batter for 3 equal layers. It was a bit time consuming to make, but was worth the effort.

A perfect 4th of July cake or even a wedding cake! I wanted to avoid the "heavy cake" syndrome, especially after a big BBQ dinner last night. I cut back on the frosting, using a thin coat even though I had leftover frosting. I also used low-sugar preserves for the filling layers which kept the sweetness-per-bite down. I piped a "rope" around the top of the cake to keep the fruit in place rather than building up a thick outer frosting edge. Very good recipe!

I loved this cake but had to alter the recipe because I did not read the directions carefully enough and I did not have enough time because it takes hours to chill. Next time I will plan ahead better.

Excellent recipe. I've made this cake several times now - each time to rave reviews. When I wanted to pare down the expense of the cake (which can be a bit high) I substituted regular pastry cream, used local, seasonal fresh fruit and glazed with raspberry preserves instead of currant. Overall, this is a cake with strong visual appeal and a nice combination of textures and flavors.

OOOPS! Almond Paste, White Chocolate and Vanilla beans aren't commonly found in small towns. Also 1 Tablespoon Vanilla extract sounds like an error. I like chiffon cakes done in Tube or Bundt pans. This might be good if revised.

This cake was very well received for a birthday bash. I used 2 9 inch diameter cake pans as these were the largest I had. I cut the cakes in 2 and had a wonderfully impressive 4 layer cake. The cake itself is light and delicious. I added some fresh berries between the layers and used a skewer in the center of the cake to anchor the 4 layers prior to frosting. I would not use the almond extract in the frosting next time and would substitue some additional citrus zest instead as I felt the extract overpowered the other flavors. I would definately make this again and probably will do so for a July 4th event.
