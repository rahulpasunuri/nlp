STAY AWAY! STAAAAAAAY AWAAAAAAAAY! The recipe sounds good at first glance, but this is a case where epicurious has presents a recipe that is so confusingly and erroneously written that it's sure to throw even the most experienced cook. The measurements are all off, as pointed out by many regarding the soy. And duck is rich...this isn't really a great side for it. Even my Asian friends agreed with this, and everyone found the walnut fried rice weird and not-so-great. I would skip this. There are a million, billion French and Asian recipes that use duck to far greater effect, with less hassle and with better results.

Very good, although 1/2 the salt soy sauce I find works better.

I used low-sodium soy sauce, and only half at that, which was perfect. Any more would be overwhelming! LOVED the walnuts in the rice, not so much the parsley. I made this with chicken instead of duck and cooked it together with the peaches which gave it a great sweet flavor to offset the salty. Both times I made it I got great reviews.

The duck breast came out great, but there is not much to it anyway. The fried rice was too salty, although I used for half of the soy the sauce with low salt. The nuts did not go too well with the fried rice. Also, my family thought the nectarines were overpowering the dish.

This is an excellent meal, especially around duck season! The presentation was fantastic, and the flavors of each component mingled very well. I added a quarter cup of soy sauce to the emulsion, as it started out rather bland, but other wise it needed no tweaking! Beautiful and elegant dish.
