For the cook from IL, a 50/50 bar is mixed orange & vanilla ice cream bar on a stick. And yes, the tastes here remind me of them.

My daughter and I made this for Father's Day. It was fun to make and quite good. We assembled 1/2 the first night as directed. The 2nd night we replaced the custard with lemon curds--even better. We'll surely make this again.

This was an easy way to make an impressive looking dessert. The custard was yummy with just a hint of orange. Next time I'll make the bundles bigger (so as to waste less dough and to have even more fruit in each bundle). I'm pastry impaired and it came out well for me!

This is a delicious, impressive treat! I have made this numerous times and it is always met with compliments and smiles.

I just made this dessert for my family tonight and it was a big hit - rather than go through the trouble of making the bundles round, I just divided the pastry sheets into four - it made it much easier, and gave it an stylish appearance. I also topped them off with a dallop of whipped cream! A definite for a refreshing summer sweet.

Just a question I had when I read this recipe: What in the world is a 50/50 Bar?

This dish was so beautiful and elegant. Easy to prepare the day ahead of time. That sauce, those bundles, WOW! My guest cleaned their plates with their fingers, forget manners when its this good. Follwed the reciipe exactly. Tied each bundle together with cooking string after pinching. Decorated the plate with fresh raspberries and mint. I will definitely be making this dish again!

This is a great dish. My family loved it. It looked impressive and wasn't that difficult to prepare. I would definitely make it again!
