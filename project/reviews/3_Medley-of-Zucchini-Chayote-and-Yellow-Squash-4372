I also added julienne of jicama and Italian parsley to this unctuous dish. I don't think the original description fits as this dish shouldn't be made after September--all these are summer squash. A hit of white wine and then a quick sprinkle of panko & Parmesan before broiling gave this dish a nice crunch. I really don't understand how someone who made this dish could be so negative,"Chayote, a pale green lump (Maybe they should try picking RIPE squash), mixed with ordinary squashes that take a long time to slice (Learn how to use a knife)...If you are determined to place another...vegetable on the Thanksgiving table why not this one? It came out a little bitter (Used squashes that were too old and/or too big: small = sweet--summer squash are called that for a reason--they are NOT supposed to be on the Thanksgiving table)... glucked up with butter (So use less butter--but that's enough butter for 5 lbs of squash, perhaps the cook should get a scale).

Chayote, a pale green lump, mixed with ordinary squashes that take a long time to slice. For squash afficionados this is the dish. If you are determined to place another unimposing vegetable on the Thanksgiving table why not this one? It came out a little bitter, boring, glucked up with butter.

it was a nice dish to make. my whole family enjoyed it. i left out the chayote (i could not find it at the store) it will be on my thanksgiving table every year!

This is the last thing on the stove for a big meal. I made it a little too early and the zuchinni got mush, but all in all, everyone loved it! I also made it with the Achiote Basted Turkey! Nice contrast!

This recipe has a great flavor and gives your usual squash dish a suprise with the addition of the chayote. For a "Southwest" theme Thanksgiving, this recipe goes well with the Achiote Butter-Basted Turkey.
