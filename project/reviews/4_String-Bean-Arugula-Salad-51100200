This is really tasty and the smoky-garlicky fragrance when the foil packet is opened is incredible. But 25-30 minutes is WAY too long to cook the beans. I'll try 15 minutes next time. I'd much prefer crispy/undercooked to the mushiness this cooking time produces.

Loved this!!! I also added the juice of the lemon as well as the sliced cherry tomatoes... I will be making this all summer!

Easy and delicious, and can be doctored up however you like. We used the same technique the next night with cauliflower which was also delicious!

This was dead easy & amazing. My grill was full so I open roasted the beans in the oven (425 for 30 mins). To finish I added a little extra olive oil, some lemon juice & a slight dusting of parmesan. My new summer staple dish!

Great, unique side dish if you're already grilling. Probably also pretty tasty if you cooked the beans indoors, but there was a great smoky flavor from the grill that went great with the spicy baby arugula and the zesty lemon. Had this with burgers, but it's a side that would be good with pretty much anything. Practically effortless.

Yummy! We made according to recipe and felt we could have grilled the green beans for 20 minutes. Added a bit of lemon juice to finish. Will definitely make again.

Simple, easy & delicious. Add some goat cheese and crusty bread, and this could be a meal!!

Delicious! I steamed beans (thanks to the other posts) and added tomatoes for taste and color. Pre-washed baby arugula made it super quick. Served with marinated grilled tofu. So unique; a perfect summer dish.

This was an excellent summery side. I steamed the beans, since we weren't otherwise grilling, and then warmed the minced garlic in the olive oil until fragrant and lightly colored. After that, tossed the whole thing. I did add 1 T of lemon juice and some halved grape tomatoes, which added something I thought was missing.

Glad to have this simple recipe. I'm tired of green beans on their own with Italian dressing, and adding the arugula adds a new flavor to the mix, without a lot of hassle.

A really nice summery vegetable dish. I steamed the beans on the stove and then warmed one clove (it was really big)minced garlic in the olive oil til fragrant, and tossed everything together. I also added a tablespoon of lemon juice - thought it needed that flavor boost.
