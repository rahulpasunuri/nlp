This is just one of over 200 or so versions of lumpia. My mother is from Manila, Philippines and she makes lumpia in a completely different way than this. For one, nothing is pre-cooked.

Here in the Philippines, there are also versions which call for more components/ "fixings' rather than just the meat and vegetable mix. Some, especially the Chinese-style fresh Lumpia can have with it ground peanuts mixed with sugar, minced garlic, fresh coriander leaves (what we call Wansoy), and deep fried glass noodles mixed with ground nori (gives it some[or a lot of] crunch).

These are called "fresh lumpia" to differentiate from fried lumpia. Shredded jicama or hearts of palm tastes better and more authentic than bamboo shoots. Wrappers are very delicate. The sweet garlic soy sauce is not thick like caramel, but the same consistency as gravy. Mix soy sauce, brown sugar, water and cornstarch. Cook until thick. Add garlic and chopped peanuts.

haves01 - Just wondering if you've tried this, and if so if it tastes like anything your mom makes?
