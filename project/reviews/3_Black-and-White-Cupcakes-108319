Loved this recipe. Definitely a keeper in my box. I cut down the buttermilk in the van icing a bit and halved the chocolate for the choc icing. I also used more fresh lemon in the van icing. Everything came out great!!

Loved these cupcakes! I did use a different frosting recipe (found here: http://www.epicurious.co m/recipes/food/views/10 6171) I almost didn't make these because of the bad reviews, but they came out absolutely perfect. My mother said they were the best cupcakes she ever tasted. Will definitely be making these for a holiday.

This is so dry, don't waste your time and good ingredients.

I made the frosting only and used the recipe for vanilla cupcakes. So - re:frosting, why do you need to let them sit for 1.5 hours prior to using? I had to reheat slightly, the chocolate frosting to spread it. The chocolate was good, the vanilla still has that confectionary taste that I don't care for (yes, I know, it is made of confection sugar -but the real black and white's frosting - NYC style - doesn't have that chalky taste - that is what I am looking for! Any idea's?)

My kids love cupcakes no matter what. Here is a hint: if you have no cake flour on hand, subtract 1 Tablespoon of flour for each cup called for, and use all-purpose (or I use unbleached) flour... so this recipe would use approx. 1 1/3 cups flour. Never a heavy cake again!

A great spring/summer recipe for fans of lemon desserts (like me). The first time I made these, I accidentally added an extra half-stick of butter. While they were still edible, with a very moist and tender crumb, they tasted like lemon poundcake. Second time around I was careful and they ended up tasty, but a bit dry for my taste, so when I make these a third time I'll add a bit of extra butter. I like to add extra lemon zest to the white frosting to give it more tang. Not a phenomenal recipe, but it produces a tasty and comforting cupcake. Oh - definitely makes 15 cupcakes, not 12, even if you fill the cups up to maximum capacity (not recommended as they become hard to frost).

I really liked this recipe - the cake part was wonderful & light. I also loved the lemon icing - very fresh tasting.

My daughter loves the cookies. I think we were in NYC years ago when she discovered them. Today is her 16th birthday (her surprise party isn't until the weekend) so I whipped up a batch these. I have already had a test one...and I must say that I am pleasantly surprised. The chocolate frosting is a bit thinner than I thought but after placing it in the refrigerator it has more substance. She is delighted and so am I.

I just made these with my 9 year old daughter -- she picked the recipe, and I was dubious given that some reviewers thought they were fantastic and others thought they were horrible -- quite a discrepancy! Following advice of others, I filled 15 tins instead of 12, and they came out perfect! Light, lemony, delicious. Chocolate icing is esp yummy. Easy to make, my kids devoured them -- 15 cupcakes is way better than 12!

I made these last weekend for a picnic. I don't know what happened but the batter tasted better than the cake. The icings were awesome. The cake was a little dry.

TOO MUCH BATTER---NO BAKING SODA????? WHAT A MESS IN THE OVEN.WOULD NOT MAKE AGAIN.

I too found way to much batter, but I wasn't smart enough to use another pan and had a burnt mess in the oven. And the icings tasted nothing like the typical icing on black and white cookies.

I made this recipe today- what a disaster! There seemed like too much batter for 12 cupcakes so I ended up with 18 filled about 1/2 way in each lined cup. I caught them just before running over into the oven. I had to pull the pans from the oven before I had a fire from the sugar in the batter. Also, why no baking soda?? Usually cakes with acid( buttermilk) have soda in the recipe.If someone else is making these be carefull about the number of cupcake tins you fill.
