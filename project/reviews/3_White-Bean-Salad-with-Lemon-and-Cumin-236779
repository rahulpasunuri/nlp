After reading the reviews, I also used canned beans, the zest of 3 lemons and the juice of 4. I also added a bit more cumin (I love cumin), and I thought that the dish was exceptionally light and flavorful. A great starter or lunch.

I love this recipe. Quick, easy, healthy and fresh! Perfect for a warm day with a glass of white wine and breeze.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The red onions make the recipe as they provide a crunch and color. I doubled the batch and froze half in serving size containers. It was delicious for work lunches. I even put an Indian bean and sauce over the top for a great lunch. I will make again.

I did change this recipe a bit based on other reviews of blandness. I used 2 cans of beans instead of dry and added the zest of two lemons, some white pepper and jalapeno. We found it to be delicious and will use it again and again!

I love beans and cumin and citrus, so I was excited to try this dish. It was very bland and disappointing. I added extra citrus juice (lime and lemon), red peppers, garlic, basil, extra salt and pepper the beans were still bland. I might try it once more, adding lemon juice to the cooking water.

There's nothing like a good bean salad on a hot day. It's refreshing, yet substantial. This is a nice recipe to which I added some cut up black olives and green chilies in brine. Great.

Only two forks because I liked it, my wife definitely didn't love it. It's not terribly complex, to make or in taste, but it's a good, healthy dish in my opinion. It certainly needs stirring just before serving to get the best of the dressing.

bland and uninteresting, I was very disapointed. I followed the recipe exactly, nothing what I was expecting. When it turned out so bland I even added more salt and more lemon, it didn't help. Not good in my opinion

This is one of those dishes that can go unnoticed; especially with guests who think beans belong in soup. Really interesting, tasty and pretty.

Excellent. Rushed to make this for a holiday potluck at work and was stopped by three coworkers asking me for the recipe! Next time though I will use less oil: sits in the bottom of the bowl and ruins the presentation. Delicious.

This was easy to make and went very well with the Roast Chicken with Dried Fruit and Almonds that I made for Chanukah.

Great over bitter greens with grilled shrimp!
