Well I should have read the other reviews before taking on this soup. I used 3 small habaneros that had been in my freezer, and one fresh one. WAY way too much heat! My husband couldn't eat it at all, and my son and his girlfriend who usually LOVE spicy food ate it but confessed it was pushing the limit of their tolerance. I did love the flavor combo however; I will use ONE SMALL habanero next time, and adapt the suggestion of another reviewer to garnish with sour cream and cilantro.

Absolutely delicious when made with ONE SMALL habañero. I have made this countless times with rave reviews every time. It actually looks and tastes as though it has cream in it. I serve it hot, not chilled. Don't miss this keeper!

Cut the habaneros to 2 and just tasted like drinking hot salsa!

I used 2 Habanero's and it was still very spicy. I enjoyed it but it was still too spicy for others who tried it. I wanted to use what the recipe called for because I love the delicious flavor of Habanero's but I knew that using 5 would make the soup inedible. I would recommend using 2 if you can really handle spicy food and 1 if you want some heat but can't handle too much. The flavor of the soup was great, I served it with a dollop of sour cream and some fresh cilantro.

So..I like spicy. No, I looove spicy. But I must admit, I had to put the bowl down and cool off a few minutes while eating it. I used 4 habaneros. Was going to take some to work for my coworkers butiI'm pretty sure none of them would be able to handle it. That being said, the flavors in this were wonderful -- I don't think it was bland at all -- and I will definitely make this soup again, but with less heat. So that other people can eat it.

I followed others advice and only used two habanero peppers; but I found the soup to be spicy but bland. It needs something more for a bolder flavor.

The other reviewers weren't kidding when they said this is spicy. I used 1/2 the amount of recommended habanero chiles. The soup was delicious but I felt sick the rest of the day because it was so spicy. I would love to make it again but don't think my stomach can handle it.

Thanks to the other cooks who warned about the heat. I used 2 habaneros and it was perfect. My husband grew habanero peppers for the first time this year. He told me they were "medium" hot. My fingers are still burning from not wearing gloves. They are quite a bit hotter than the red chili peppers he's grown in the past.

Great sensations on the palate. Cold and sweet, then the heat kicks in. Wonderful! I used 2 tbsps. about 3 Habaneros and it packed plenty of punch for my tastes. I've made it twice and plan on making it again.

Really, really delicious, but do heed the advice of the other reviewers and reduce the number of habaneros to 2 or 3. I had clipped this recipe from Gourmet magazine and mid- recipe hopped on to Epicurious to see if the 5 peppers I'd chopped were truly a good idea (I began to worry about the quantity as I eyed the pile on my cutting board). Swayed by the other reviews, I used 3 peppers rather than 5 and ended up with a delicious soup that was still plenty spicy. I served it with slices of country bread studded with kalamata olives.

I did scale back the amount of habaneros to two, knowing that we like hot but not incendiary. And it was gorgeous. The flavors balance perfectly: a little fruit, a little spice, a little acid from the tomatoes. I did use all produce from the farmers market, which I think was important. Oh, and I also discovered while making the soup that I only had 1 clove of Garlic left so I added some shallots which also worked nicely.

This soup is fantastic. Everyone knows his own level of heat tolerance and should adjust the amount of chile peppers to suit. I suggest grilling both peppers and tomatoes on the grill to make peeling both of them easier and also to add more smokey flavor.

This definitely had a kick to it. I would make it again, but use two instead of the four habaneros that I used. I have good tolerance when it comes to spicy food, but this was a bit too spicy as is. Served with a dollop of sour cream, which helped with the heat.

Gourmet should have warned people about this. Really, really hot, and could cause blisters in sensitive people. Beware! I would not make this again without some significant adjustments.

My husband and I love spicy food, and we'd been looking for an excuse to cook with habaneros. This soup did not disappoint: the flavors were wonderful, and it was HOT. I used 5 habaneros (minus seeds and pith), and next time I think maybe I'll use 3-1/2. We ate all of it, but we had tears in our eyes before the end of the meal. The only downside to this recipe (as far as I'm concerned) is the time and effort necessary to roast and skin the bell peppers along with having to blanch/skin the tomatoes. Nonetheless, the soup was so delicious I'm sure I'll make it again (minus a few peppers).

We love heat around here, but this was so spicy it was almost inedible, even after being thinned with extra broth and some half-and-half and garnished with half a sliced avocado. Used four habaneros, and removed the seeds and ribs. Did find a good use for it, though - heated over pasta as an arrabiata sauce!
