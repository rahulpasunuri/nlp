Where did you get this recipe - It needs to be renamed or removed. It is STEW not GUMBO - you cannot make Gumbo without a Roux.

dis ain`t gumbo cher, soup maby, ya don`t have roux, cerly, or green onions, an ya sure don`t put file in before you put it in your bowl, file is personal prefrence only, it is a thickner, very little flavor, ya forgot to say you can put eggs in it rite before its done an let them boil, give`um great flavor.

Would be nice to know about the gumbo, like how much how long to cook, and what to do with it.
