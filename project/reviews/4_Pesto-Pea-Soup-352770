I used 1/2 dried peas & half frozen which gave it a richer more authentic taste.

This soup is FANTASTIC. I made my own pesto, using Gourmet's pesto recipe, which is brainlessly simple. And there's nothing better than fresh ingredients! But this soup was awesome: the sweetness of the peas followed harmoniously by the mellow strength lent by the pesto. This recipe is SO effortless, and with such phenomenal success!!

So good! Make your own pesto (basil, garlic, pine nuts, parmesan cheese, lemon juice, and olive oil) for the best flavor.

I made this just because we didn't have dinner made and I had nothing to do so...why not? I didn't think it would be that good but it was pretty good.

this soup was great. very very easy to make. the only thing is that it needs garlic. otherwise it was a little bland. i put in like 3 cloves worth of minced garlic (from a jar). this made it taste great. everything else i made as is. will definitely make again...just with the garlic.

tried this recipe just to use up some pesto. didn't have high hopes for it but it was so good! it got better over the next couple of days. i added half and half and grated cheese which made it even better.

I found this soup good but nothing exceptional. My guests were ok with it but no one wanted seconds. I'm giving it three forks as the simplicity of the recipe makes it a quick fix soup when needed. If I make it again, I'd probably add the parm on top as others had suggested.

This is my new favorite soup! It was quick and easy but definitely doesn't taste it!

This has become one of my go-to recipes. I usually double the carrots and celery for an extra veggie boost. Because the pesto is what gives the soup most if its flavor, the results will probably vary greatly depending on the pesto sauce you use; I found one that I really like at an artisanal shop. It's expensive, but worth it. I'm always sad when the leftovers run out.

this was a good soup. it was very quick and easy to make. i think it would be better with parmesan on top, as other reviewers mentioned. maybe next time i will add some garlic, as my pesto seems light on it. or i will make my own pesto to go in it.

Quick, easy, and great tasting! This is a soup that can be made as part of a quick weeknight supper or an elegant dinner party. I added more pesto and topped with shavings of parmesan cheese.

Very tasty, everyone loved it. I added more pesto than called for and blended it sparingly to leave it chunky rather than smooth.

Really different and delicious. I made it for book club and it received high marks. A few crumbles of goat cheese are great on top. The flavor is very fresh. It freezes well, too.

I made this for my partner's parents last night and it was a hit. I came home late and had to cook and wanted something quick but nice. This was it. Didn't change a thing.

The soup is in fact very good. I like the sweet and garlic flavour in it. I put a little bit more pesto and some parmezan on the top - nice combination.

This is delicious, especially considering how easy it is to make! I wouldn't say it's the best pea soup I've ever had, but it's up there. I found I had to add a lot of salt.

I made it last night for a quick, healthy dinner. It was a tasty soup, especially considering how easy it was to prepare. It is the first time I've reviewed anything, so I'm being conservative in my rating.
