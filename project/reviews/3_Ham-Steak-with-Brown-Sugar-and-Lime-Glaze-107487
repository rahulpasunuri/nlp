This is really fast and tasty recipe--nothing special, but a keeper for a busy evening. There is a great pork farmer who sells at our local farmers market and the success of the dish depends in part on the quality of the meat. We all loved it.

It just didn't have the zing I thought it would. It was okay, but nothing special.

The flavor was good once I added a bit of salt. Due to a change in plans, I had to cook it a day later than intended so it marinated WAY too long...probably the reason it was tougher than I would have hoped. It did get great reviews from my guests, though. I will probably make it again but do it right.

I subbed the lime juice with lemon juice also and just love it. Thank you

Absolutely loved this. Quick, tender and delicious. Served with baked sweet potatoes and a salad of baby greens, grapes and apples. Will definitely make again. The sauce is great over the sweet potatoes too.

We really liked this recipe. I grill the ham steaks after letting them marinate for a few hours. The flavor is great and my kids love it, too!

This was okay, but for a change of pace a recipe I really like has a glaze of 1 c. brown sugar, 1/3 c. prepared horseradish & 1/4 c. lemon juice... it has a sweet/hot flavor!

I used fresh lemon juice in place of the lime and it was fantastic! I would definetly make it again but make it in the broiler as I usually do.

This recipe was a bit hit at our dinner table! My boyfriend absolutely loved it and declared it my second-best effort ever (right behind the beef with red wine sauce from this website). It was wonderful to make as well, quick and easy and perfect for an evening meal. I love that there's only a few ingredients as well. It's inexpensive and you can use up some supplies from the cupboard. High marks!

I have to say that it was a quick dish to make. But it was just missing the flavor that I thought it would have.

Quick, easy and very tasty. My husband loved it. Will try it on the grill when the weather gets better.

I tried this recipe because I had extra limes and ham steaks in the fridge. Simple as could be but delightful and EASY. My husband, who doesn't love ham, really enjoyed it.

Little sweet for my taste but the husband who doesn't like ham enjoyed it. It is a simple to prepare supper with baked sweets and a green veggie.

This was an easy way to dress up a simiple ham steak without too much time or effort. I had a one pound steak so I doubled the glaze recipe but I don't think that was necessary - I had a lot of glaze leftover. I will certainly make this again.

Great recipe -- quick and delicious. Make sure you cook the glaze until it is thick and clinging to the ham. I used a fresh ham steak...yummy!

Made more glaze for bigger ham steak. This was delicious. No leftovers.

I doubled the brown sugar & lime juice for a 1 1/3 lb. steak, and although I didn't get a paste, but a liquid, I marinated it for 3 hours and cooked it with the liquid and had some left to pour over the steaks. My husband and I both enjoyed it, and the lime juice was just enough to flavor it and cut the sweetness. I served it with rosemary-roasted sweet-potato wedges and corn on the cob.

"Wow Mom - you're a real good cooker-chef!" When your three year old says that, you know the recipe is a keeper. My 21 month old gobbled it up too.

Quick, easy, inexpensive and delicious - very kid friendly. My picky 5 year old loved it and asked for seconds - a rarity! My teenage son, my husband and myself thought it was great, too. We love that sweet-savory flavor, and a little mustard on the side along with the ham is good, too. I forgot about the marination time, so it only got about 15 minutes at room temperature. I ended up adding some of the marinade/paste that remained on the plate and let the ham simmer in that for a bit (of course, I doubled this to serve 4). We will definitely be having this again, and I'll remember to let it marinate next time!

This recipe was very easy to make, but it didn't do much for the ham steak. My impression was that it may be a good way to make a ham roast (there was just too much sugary taste for the steaks). My guy was surprised to have a steak that tasted like dessert, served as an entree! He didn't like this recipe either, though he is a dessert hound. I won't make this again.

Very easy - very tasty! I used a larger ham steak (about a pound & 1/2), so I upped the lime juice & brown sugar. This was great for a quick & homey meal!
