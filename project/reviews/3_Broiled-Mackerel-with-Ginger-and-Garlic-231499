Given the reviews, I was expecting this to be amazing but it was just ok. I think there are too many competing flavors in the marinade. There are better marinades for mackerel out there.

Very easy to prepare with ingredients you probably have on hand. Salt can be halved or left out; the salty nature of the mackerel and the chili powder cover that base. I like this recipe for mackerel because the fish has such a strong flavor; I probably would not sub any other fish because the flavor would be totally subsumed.

My husband had caught king mackerel and we had them the next night with the above rub- although I was a bit lazy and just grated the ginger right onto the fish, as well as sprinkled the garlic and other seasonings-then a squeeze of lime and finished w/the oil (olive) and my husband grilled it on the skin side for about 5-6minutes and flipped it over for 2 and it was delicious-- we had cilantro but didn't need it-I will do this again with other similar types of fish-

Excellent & easy Whipped together for a quick Saturday nite dinner Next time might add sliced almonds. Served w/ some frozen chopped spinach that had sesame oil & sesame seeds added. Accompanied with a 2004 Kim Crawford Marlborough Unoaked Chardannay.

I used tilapia (lacking much in the way of good fish so far from ANY type of water!)and it was delicious. It's easy and fast, with a lot of zip and it's good for you, too - who could ask for more out of a quick, easy, week-night dish?

I love mackerel and was interested in finding another way to prepare it. Tried this recipe, but found that there were too many competing flavors, especially the lime juice and the ginger. Less of both would probably help, and I'd leave the salt out completely. The fish is salty enough.

Delicious! There is nothing to add... it's just perfect the way it is, and the Fennel and Endive salad is the perfect side dish. I don't have that special slicer, so I just knife sliced as thin as I could... For starch I suggest a spoon of cooked millet and for dessert a simple salad made of fresh oranges and raspberries. A glass of white wine (Sancerre) is also a good idea. Bon Appetit!
