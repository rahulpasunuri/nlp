I've made this a few times already, and I love it! Super easy. Now I just use the recipe as a guideline and I throw in any vegetables that I have in the fridge waiting to be eaten just like I would any other stir-fry. I like to add meat if possible, cooking it before and then removing it while I cook the vegetables and adding it back again afterward, so far I've used beef and sausage. Delicious every time!

Super easy recipe, and it tasted good. Used only 2 tablespoons of oil which seemed sufficient, because I wanted Stir Fried cabbage, not stir fried oil with a little cabbage! Used rice vinegar since this was Asian. I shredded my cabbage pretty good and I couldn't keep much on my fork. next time, I'll cut it a bit bigger and cook it a bit longer.

I only used 1/8 cup oil, and that was plenty. I used peanut oil, seeing as it was a stir fry. It needs something to give it a kick, perhaps some red pepper flakes, or a drop of toasted sesame oil. It's a 1 forker with potential to be a 2, so I gave it a 2.

This is very good. In fact, my most favorite cabbage recipe to date.. I think next time I'll try cutting back on the oil a bit. Hope it does not ruin the flavor...

I would cook the cabbage a bit longer than the recipe calls for. While many vegetables are excellent, al dente, the cabbage is better when a bit softer. Otherwise flavors are superb. I used the recipe as a side dish to Corned Beef !. Had NO leftovers !

I felt that this recipe had too much liquid, and therefore, was runny as a side dish. The next night I added some chicken to it and stir-fried it and served it over rice. Overall, the vinegar taste came through for me too much.
