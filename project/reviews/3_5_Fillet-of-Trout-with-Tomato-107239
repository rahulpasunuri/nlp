This was a fantastic recipe. Great for using up fresh tomatoes. I didn't have any dry white wine on hand so I used Strongbow dry cider instead and it turned out great! I caramelized my onions slightly which also added a nice hint of sweet. The green olives totally add that zing that the fish needs.

Preparation and cleanup were easy and quick. The chunky sauce stands well on its own, and it doesn't require any additional fussing. Next time I will follow the advice of other reviewers and back off on the wine. I used the full pound of the fresh roma tomatoes called for in the recipe.

Differnt, we didn't use the capers or olives and we added lemon juice. Deliciouse though my roomates enjoyed it.

This was a great refreshing new taste and we will absolutely do this again. It can be improvised with ingredients on hand. We had found some very nice fresh trout filets to start with. I did not have plum tomatoes on hand but I did use very fresh ripe hot house tomotoes (no canned as the fresh tomatoes are essential to such a dish!). Lacking parsley, I substituted fresh chopped dill weed. I doubled the fresh garlic and added a little chopped garlic from a jar. I used half of a large red onion instead of the pearl onions and also chopped in three small sun dried tomatoes. Finally, I added 1/4 cup roasted chili salsa. I reduced the white wine to 1/2 cup.

Sorry, this didn't do it for us. I did use canned diced tomatoes but I don't think it made that big a difference.

A great quick and easy dish. I substituted shallots for the pearl onions(any onion would be fine), added a couple of cloves of minced garlic, used a can of diced tomatoes, drained of juice and cut back to 1/2 cup of wine (didn't want soup). I also used tilapia but I'm sure it would be great with trout as well.

This was delicious! I doubled the sauce since I had a little more fish and cooked it on the charcoal grill in the oiled pan. I served it with grits. It was a restaurant quality dish and looks fabulous.

I have made this several times, with trout and tilapia. Both were delicious - the tilapia being a less expensive option, at least around here. I've used shallots instead of pearl onions, and that worked fine too. Not only is this dish easy and delicious, but it's beautiful too! It really makes me feel like I'm in southern France.

Great recipe. Easy to make. Have made it twice. Second time I made some modifications that I think made it better. I backed off the wine a bit (1/2 to 3/4 cup instead of 1). I substituted dill for the parsley. I substituted tomatoe sauce for the tomatoes because I was in a hurry. Finally I used snapper instead of trout. Both were really good but I think it works better with a little less wine and a whiter fish. Enjoy!

Very easy to make. I used two chopped fresh vine tomatoes and one chopped yellow onion, instead of the plum tomatoes and pearl onions. It was beautiful and tasted and smelled delicious. I also used two whole (butterflied) white trout which tasted great. The only drawback was the occaisional fishbone, which were hard to pick out with the colorful and chunky sauce. I think I will try a fillet next time, as the recipe suggested.

The sauce was very good. We didn't have green olives, so we used kalamata -- big mistake -- overwhelmed the dish. Also, choose your fish carefully. We used steelhead trout which was just a little too gamey. I would do it again with a white fish such as snapper, halibut, etc.

Easy prep and cleanup with tasty results. Looks colorful, tastes light and delicious. Used fresh tomatoes from the garden and Sauv Blanc wine. Paired with steamed artichokes and sauteed potatoes with parsley and lemon. Yummy combo for a relatively simple, but a little special, healthy, midweek meal.

My husband and I made this and loved it. We didn't have all the ingredients but it still turned out really well. We didn't have white wine so we just added a little lemon instead. We also did not have the onions or parsley. Definitely make this again since it was so easy.

My husband and I are not big fish eaters, but tried this and loved it. Delicious and filling.

Great recipe, easy to prepare. In the two times I've made it, using different kinds of tomatoes and onions didn't seem to matter.

I thought this was a very simple and quite dish to make and followed the receipe using steel head trout. I'm preparing this dish tonight but will use talapia instead of the trout and believe it will be just as tasty.

This recipe was easy. It tasted very nice but nothing too special though. I would maybe make it again.

This tasted good and was easy to make. I used chopped onions (as the tester suggested), but they didn't cook enough. Should have sauteed them first, or used the pearl onions as the recipe had. It also seemed salty enough without adding extra salt for seasoning, probably because the olives I used were packed in brine. Double garlic as the tester suggested (which I did) was also a good idea.
