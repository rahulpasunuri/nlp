This was fine, but not exceptional. I found it to be a bit floury and light on butterscotch flavor. It was a step up from boxed pudding, but of course not as creamy and satisfying as an egg-based pudding. If you want the ultimate butterscotch pudding and have more time, try the butterscotch pots de creme from this site--divine!

Sooo much better than butterscotch pudding from a box! It is also good with a Hershey bar blended in right before chilling. That makes it a milk-chocolate-butterscotch pudding with a bit firmer consistency.

To those who ended up with butterscotch soup after chilling, it's probably because you boiled the cornstarch mixture too long. To those who had raw cornstarch flavor, it's likely you undercooked it. Be sure you follow the timing in the recipe exactly.

All of my reviews should be taken with a grain of salt...I am new to the kitchen. I was underwhelmed by this pudding. The texture was thick and a little grainy. Taste wise, it had a hint of caramel. But not much else. Reading through the other reviews, I see there are ways to mitigate some of the my criticisms with this dish. But...I think I'll just look for another pudding.

Who says this is for kids? We all had childhoods, right? This is very quick and easy to make. I added a bit of maple flavoring for a bit more depth.

This might be quick but it doesn't really taste like a true butterscotch pudding. I would highly recommend making the butterscotch pudding recipe from Bon Apetit/Dec 2002 instead.

Very easy to make (I made as written) and delicious. I didn't have any problem with a corn starch flavor in mine.

Well, this pudding is delicious, but it doesn't taste like artifical butterscotch (duh). It tastes more like a creme caramel or dulce de leche. I'm not sure what would achieve a more "butterscotchy" taste. Maybe some scotch??? I have no idea, but the recipe is still super easy and yummy.

We really liked this pudding - easy and delicious. The second time around I used 1% milk (no cream) and only 1/2 the butter. Not as rich, of course, but much more acceptable in the guilt department! I would go with the cream if it were for a special dessert, because it really does put it over the top, in taste and consistency. :)

This is an easy yet extremely tasty dessert. I make two separate batches, one exactly like the recipe and one with skim milk only. I find that it works just as well with only skim milk. I would say that the taste deserves 3 forks and the ease of making this makes it 4 forks.

Just made it and so far so good. Made with only 2% milk instead, and I whisked half the cold milk into the sugar/cornstarch mixture to smooth out any lumps before adding the remaining milk a few minutes later. Also lessened the butter by 1/2 T, and threw in a few teaspoons of scotch with the vanilla. Smooth and good flavor while warm, and even better with a dollop of whipped cream. We'll see if it makes it to the refrigerator...

This pudding is sooooooooooooo good. It's even better the second time (the first was yesterday). It's smooth, delicious and I just wish a similar recipe could be invented for chocolate pudding. The recipe I usually use (my mom's) sometimes contains tiny lumps (cornstarch related...). Mmm perhaps cutting down on the brown sugar and melting in some chopped chocolate after removing it from the heat.....

I love butterscotch pudding. Unfortunately this recipe didn't work for me. I followed the recipe to the letter, but ended up with pudding soup/liquid ice cream. Don't know what I did wrong. Before adding the butter and vanilla the mixture had thickened up nicely. However, refrigerating the "pudding" for two hours it was the consistancy of a thick liquid.

When I made this, the taste was delicious, but the consistency was too stiff. It would support a soup spoon stuck in on its handle. I think reducing the cornstarch by 2 tsp. may help.

Didn't like this at first. However, the flavors, which are complex - darkly sweet, salty, creamy - came together into something altogether different by the second day. Agree with other reviewers that the texture is a little unexpected; it's not thick and creamy like a boxed pudding would be, and while it didn't turn out liquidy as some reviewers commented, it was a bit wobblier than one would expect. The taste is so good, though, that it doesn't matter. Incidentally, what is the difference between caramel, toffee, butterscotch, and dulce de leche?

This pudding has a nice flavor, but I was disappointed that I could still taste a hint of the cornstarch. I was compensated though by how easy and foolproof this recipe was. However, for a really good butterscotch pudding, I have to recommend "Butterscotch Pots de Creme" from this site (Gourmet Oct 2003)

This was simply delicious. I only had 2% milk in the house and it was still yummy. Mine never made it to the refridgerator.

I had to say I was a bit disappointed with this recipe. The consistency was creamy and the color was nice, but as far as the flavor goes, it reminded me a bit of butterscotch maybe? It seemed like too much sugar, even after trying dark brown sugar and Turbinado in two separate tries. I'd recommend it for a younger audience, but as for a more adult crowd, maybe I'll stick to a recipe that has some actual scotch in it.

Yum! After making this, I had to laugh at others who mentioned the consistency got thicker when cooled ... ours never made it past the warm stage! My husband and I devoured the whole thing while it was cooling down. Delicious! I didn't change anything in the recipe - LOVED it!!

Excellent recipe. Simple and easy and it produces a eleganr dessert.

I have tried this recipe twice and followed the instructions exactly. The consistency seems perfect when I remove it from the stove, but after 1 1/2 hours chilling in the refrigerator it turns to liquid the consistency of melted ice cream. Has this happened to anyone else and if so what am I doing wrong???

This is my guy's favorite dessert and this recipe is his new favorite! As the cook I love it because it's soooo easy! We like it best served warm right away. If you found it became firm after cooling you probably boiled it for too long. I sometimes add one more tbsp of brown sugar for a little more color and taste - it seems to work well.

This is SO easy it gets a 4 fork rating. The taste is sweet but not too sweet and the texture is great. My whole family asked me to make more as soon as their dessert dishes were empty. A little heavy for an everyday treat but an easy, yummy recipe.

try the butterscotch pie recipe from gourmet 1996 on this site. great satisfaction in making true butterscotch the flavor is just amazing

The pudding was tasty and smooth but it wasn't as creamy as it should have been. It was firm. I followed the recipe exactly, but I don't have much experience with pudding, so maybe I cooked it a bit too long.

I assume that ButterSCOTCH refers to the flavor- I used Vanilla powder (ground vanilla beans, readily available here in Germany) and then 2 teaspoons good 12 year old Scotch in place of the vanilla extract. Gives a 'grown-up' taste to the pudding. My scotch-loving boyfriend raved!

I loved this! So easy and quick to make and it tasted light and flavourful. But next time I will whisk constantly as the previous reviewer did -- when I just whisked as directed, there were a few lumps.

I made this with light brown sugar which I had on hand. Because the mixture tasted bland and not very sweet, I added some Khalua at the end with the butter and vanilla. It was delicious! Will make again with brown sugar and may add some spices like cardamom. Maybe that will deepen the flavors a bit. It was super easy to make. I never really stppped wisking so the texture was lump free. This gets 3 forks for being a bit bland without additional ingredients otherwise it was great.

This is a very easy recipe but compared to a recipe in an old BH&G cookbook it is lacking. A larger amount of brown sugar and the addition of eggs improves the recipe but then you lose the convenience of not having to strain out bits of cooked egg.

What a breeze to make and our entire family loved it--from my ninety year old mother-in-law to my daughter and 8 year old granddaughter who are both gluten free! Very smooth and light and lots of butterscotch flavor. This one's definitely a keeper.

My 12 year old's eyes rolled back in her head, and she declared she could never eat boxed pudding again after eating this. Very easy.
