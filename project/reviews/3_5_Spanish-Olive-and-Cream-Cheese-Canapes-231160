always a hit at my annual christmas party. i never use scallions and rarely use sherry. i also mix the parm rather than sprinkling on top. like the person from norfolk says, don't forget them! i always end up having an extra crispy first batch because i always forget. cutting the bread with a cute cookie cutter is also a nice touch. looks/tastes like more work than it is.

Skip the toasts--this is a great dip for crackers, to fill celery or endive leaves, on bagel chips, whatever. I used reduced fat, whipped cream cheese and that made blending even easier. Super yummy! Might add some sun-dried tomatoes next time, esp if I don't have the roasted red peppers on hand.

Have made this recipe so many times and always get raves. Don't add the sherry because one of my group is AA. It is delicious.

I made this for Christmas Eve. My family loves olives. I used both green and black- black to tone down the salt. I also used a Christmas cookie cutter to make it fun! I made a double batch and every last one got eaten! Fabulous!!! This is a keeper!

big yawn... if you're looking for a special hors d'oeuvres, keep searching. very bland.

Easy, different, tasty if a bit salty, but that's probably the idea for something to be served with drinks. My husband refuses to eat olives but was fooled by the appearance and loved the canapes, as did our guests.

Made these for a cocktail party and they were a hit. I cheated in a couple of ways: used Melba Toasts for the base, and mixed in the parmesan in with the topping and didn't bother heating them. They still turned out great and I got lots of compliments and requests for the recipe!

This bite size canape was delish. The 1 1/2 inch cookie cutter size was perfect for popping in your mouth. The toast was perfect...I used a loaf of Franz white bread, but you only get 4 cuts out of a slice of bread. I will use the toast idea for other toppings too. By mistake, I mashed the Parm. Cheese with the cream cheese mixture and I still thought it was wonderful. I also sprinkled a bit of finishing salt on them. Maybe by including the Parm cheese it toned the saltiness down so the finishing salt was nice. Per another review, I also used roasted red pepper from the jar. I will def. make this again!

I made this for Christmas, but it didn't get served. I kept it sealed in the fridge and it was still good on New Year's Eve, so I served it with Wheat Thins Toasted Crisps in Veggie flavor and it was excellent.

I made this for my family coming in to visit, my dad and step-mother are very picky. So when they raved about them and asked what was in them I was more than happy to share! Of all the appetizers I made. I really should have doubled this! They go very very fast!!!

These are really good -- and they freeze well, which is an added bonus.

Yep, they're good. I used an olive oil pump sprayer to coat the bread rounds, which worked well and I can tell myself that the oil mitigated the rest of the animal fat in the canapes. I made them for a party and they simply vanished! I plan to try using red Ahaheim chiles to spicy things up, but the canapes are quite good with bell pepper.

Pretty good; guests liked it, but the "toasts" disappointed me. They were chewy (I made them a day in advance.) I used firm bread from the bakery. Maybe that bread was too good for this recipe.

I usually try to make recipes exactly as written the first time, and then tweak it the next time. This hors d'oeuvre is a star and I wouldn't change a thing!

This was great! I used phyllo cups instead of toast, but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I defintely will make these again.

Try these. Very pretty, unique and tasty. Even after an hour on the buffet table, still good.

I first made this about 8 months ago. Ever since I have made it numerous times. I did not add the scallions, and sometimes I use port. I also use lowfat cream cheese instead of regular.Great recipe.

Very tasty mix of ingredients and especially good on the toasted bread. Made as stated in the recipe except without the sherry, as I didn't have any on hand. Don't think it made much difference. Will be making this again.

Another wonderful hit from Epicurious. Preparation time was less than 15 minutes. I would not change a thing. Guests were asking if they were shrimp or crab - unbelievable! Linda

I only halfway made this recipe, just the dip and served it with crackers. So perhaps my rating isn't quite fair, but the mixture was pleasant but not outstanding. I also would lessen the amount of olives, as it was quite salty.

Have now made this several times, always a hit and always turns out very well.

Maybe just the combination of flavors but it didn't do much for me. The toasts were great as described but the olive mixture just didn't send me.

Have made this appetizer twice, and will make again! The first time used toast as instructed in recipe (fancy cutter instead of round), the second time used mini phyllo cups. Would recommend toast - the crunch added to the "bite" experience.

Made it for New Years Day. It was a big hit. The bread put it over the top.

Everyone at our Christmas Eve party loved these - there was tons of food and these were gone in a flash. Don't skip making the toasts, they were crunchy on the outside and soft inside - delicious! I forgot the red pepper - still yum!

Very easy and delish - used phyllo cups and it could not have been simpler. Disappeared in a heartbeat.

a big hit with the whole party. I used packaged bread toasts - plain flavor and garlic flavor (in the black bag) and they worked great for this...

I made these on Christmas night. I replaced the red bell pepper with roasted red peppers and the sweet hungarian paprika with smoked paprika. they turned out fabulous. my guests were very happy.

Great appetizer. Just make sure you watch these carefully while broiling... my first batch got a little burnt!
