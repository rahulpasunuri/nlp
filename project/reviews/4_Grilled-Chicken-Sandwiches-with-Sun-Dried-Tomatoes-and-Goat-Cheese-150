Just made this again. Used George Foreman grill and Drunken Goat cheese. It's pretty awesome.

This is seriously one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten in my life. I only marinated the chicken for a few hours and still got a nice flavor, but next time I'll try and see if going for longer makes a difference. I seriously had dreams of this sandwich after I made it. So good.

Didn't have time for the marinade, so improvised with a balsamic vinegar dressing and mixed it with honey. The mix was so the dressing would stick to the chicken, while grilling, rather than just running off. Seemed to work. Took someone's advice and bought the sun-dried tomato pesto and I definitely recommend that route as well. Over all, awesome and quick grilled-chicken recipe. Definitely having again!

A decent recipe. The marinade for the chicken is rather dull. Follow others advice and be sure to flatten the chicken breasts or use small ones. Used both french baquette and sour dough baquette and both were equally good.

Delicious! I made this as written and my family loved it! I'll experiment with other cheeses next time.

Will definitely be making again, but with a couple of minor tweaks. I'll pound the chicken flat as the thick chicken breasts made it difficult to eat. I'll also increase the "fixings" as everyone had suggested. More goat cheese, grilled onions and sundried tomatos next time!

I prepared these sandwiches for a family gathering and they were a huge hit. I toasted ciabatta rolls and happened to see sun-dried tomato pesto when shopping which made spreading simple. Will definitely do this one again. Marinated chicken breasts were excellent the next day without bread.

This is easy and delicious. I definitely recommend buying the thin-sliced chicken breast as it grills better. Very good with sweet potato fries. Yum!

This was a great recipe! Definitely double the amount of onions and use sun dried tomato paste. Fed a party of 10 and everyone there absolutely loved it!

This was exceptionally delicious. I marinated the chicken for 3 days (couldn't fix it the day I had planned originally) Used thawed Costco breasts. Cooked the onions (doubled the number) wrapped in thick foil on the grill to avoid them falling through. Used extra thick spread of goat cheese. Had a drop in guest that night and we all, including my young children raved about it.

Mmm, delicious. Also works if you substitue chick'n for the chicken.

We all loved it! I used more goat cheese and sundried tomatoes and could have used more onions. Some of my onions fell through the grill grates!

This was excellent. The grilled, marinated chicken breast was wonderful on it's own, but putting it together with the sundried tomatoes and goat cheese put it over the top. Fast, easy, and delicious!! I will make again and again.

This was a great dinner for an 'average' night with the husband. I loved it and plan to make it again!

We love this- even packed a lunch for a long Pacific flight. It was fantastic.

WOW WOW WOW. This is our favorite. I made it for a year or so as is (extra garlic in the marinade). Now I've grilled and adde portabella slices, red pepper slices, and red onion slices (all marinated) and its better than ever. This recipe will NOT FAIL to please. (Grill everything)

Fantastic and easy. I flattened the chicken breasts to an even thickness, and grilled them about 8 minutes instead of 10. Simple enough to make any time and delicious enough for guests.

A big hit at the last picnic. I will use additional goat cheese and sun-dried tomatoes next time. I'll probably also flatten the breast first.

Delightfully light but flavorful. The sun-dried tomatoes in olive oil added a zippiness. I used Wegman's cheese bread Chavrie cheese, Vidalia onions, spring mix, and sliced rotisserie chicken. I did not make the sauce but will next time. The winning combination will make this a regular in my recipe rotation.

This is the perfect panini. Delicious. I seasoned chicken with plenty of herbs first and it added to the overall flavor.

Wonderful, we all loved it! I needed a last minute recipe for dinner and found this. I didn't have the sun dried tomatoes and it was still delicious. It will be a keeper.

Great recipe and easy to prepare in advance! Make smaller sections for appetizers. I used sun-dried tomato paste which made it easier to eat...less to fall out of the sandwich.

Loved this sandwich! Hubby and I don't like white meat, so used boneless thighs, pounded thin, and herb flavored goat cheese. I usually don't like arugula but it was perfect on this sandwich. A keeper!

Easy and delicious! My husband and I both loved it.

This was great. Quick and easy too (I failed to marinate the chicken for as long as suggested and it still came out tender and flavorful). And wonderful combination of flavors, textures, colors. Don't change a thing.

Really great sandwich - our guests loved it. Was VERY large and hard to eat, though. Would really recommend pounding the chicken thinner before grilling.

Please advise if this can be prepared a few hours ahead of time. Thx!

Apparently our french bread is harder than normal - after i grilled it per the other suggestions, it was really really hard. The flavors seemed good, but the texture was a little dry - I would think about mixing the sundried tomatoes into some mayonnaise. not as lowcal, but probably tastier.

Great picnic fare! Very easy and gourmet tasting. The reviews below helped us -- grilled bread tastes better, shredded chicken is easier to bite. A keeper that will impress your fellow tailgaters!

Excellent, easy to make recipe which was the envy of not only our friends devouring the sandwiches, but of the many folks passing by us while picnic'ing at the Hollywood Bowl!

After so many great reviews my husband and I liked this sandwich but didn't love it! It was a little on the bland side. The marinade didn't seem to come through. I would suggest more sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese and red onion. Also flaten the chicken breast a little to make a more managable sandwich.

I shared this recipe with my daugbter tonight. It was wonderful! I brushed olive oil on the rolls before I grilled them. I will definitely make these again!!!

Superb! Flavorful, juicy chicken to create a hearty, yet low-fat sandwich. Even pickier eaters would enjoy it. The chicken was great alone, as well.

This is a gourmet sandwich worthy of guests. Great flavor combo. My husband really liked it. My only mistake was buying rolls too big for the chicken breasts.

This was a delicious and easy recipe! When I first looked at it I didn't think it would be that good, but it turned out wonderful!

This is a great grilled chicken sandwich and so EASY to make. I toasted regular buns on the grill and left off the arugula and it was absolutely delicious.

At first glance, this recipe sounded delicious. Then upon rereading it, I thought it would be to dry of a sandwich. I made it anyway and was glad I did. The tomates and the cheese add moisture and lots of flavor. I would most certainly make it again.

Very tasty! My husband and I are dieting and I have to keep him interested - and this certainly did not taste like a low calorie sandwich. We really liked it!
