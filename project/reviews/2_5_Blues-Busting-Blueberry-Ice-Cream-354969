This recipe was too tart. I won't make this again.

Easy to whip up.Blueberries are expensive but it was fun to get them fresh from the farmers' market. My girls loved it. I ate it at night - then used it in the morning for the girls with a banana, a little juice for smoothies.

Beautiful color, very easy. Not as tasty as a custard-style ice cream, but much less work and very rich.
