Can't believe someone reviewed these as "one- dimensional" in flavour!!!!! With the sherry, garlic, lemon, parsley... I thought it was perfect: really simple, quick, tasty, no huge budget and you can aways add your own twist to it.

This dish came out wonderful. I served it as a appetizer on christmas along with black peppercorn parm biscotti. (also from this site) It was delicious.I did buy the wrong peppers so i added a little crushed red for some spice. My guests loved them.

this was a better than "just good" base recipe. You can do add in's that work well. If you like the spice, the chiles are a fantastic touch I had to substitute dried herbs too. I modified this by adding a little cream to the sauce.

This recipe was fantastic!! It's a gem in the rough of so many ordinary recipes. Plus, it was really easy. I wanted to make it again the next day.

I'm not a clam eater, but my husband loves this recipe. I've made it several times, just like the recipe, and it's a hit every time.

Nothing special. To be honest, my favorite clam recipe is Chinese-style with black bean sauce which has a rich, full-bodied flavor. In comparison, this recipe seemed weak and the flavors one-dimensional. That's not to say this is a bad recipe; it just doesn't appeal to my taste.
