Simply amazing. Mushrooms and sweet red wine with fish? You bet! The port reduction was the only time consuming/kinda expensive part. The remainder of the recipe is pretty simple. Fresh snapper is definitely the way to go. The only substitute I used was chopped baby bellas in lieu of the cepes and it was fantastic. Don't forget the fresh chives.

Just made this after seeing it on Avec Eric. Not sure if he would agree, but I never have sweet wine at home. I substituted half aperitif wine, half fruity red (a zin) and a scant tsp of sugar. I enjoyed the sauce but found it overpowered the house with the smell of the sherry vinegar reducing. Also there is a fine line, it seems, between liquidy wine reduction and glace', so this was a little testy for me. It complimented the dish very well. I made my own 5-spice which had no anise in it and good quality spices. Excellent flavor. I did not have cepes so I used criminis with some reconstituted porcinis. All was great. I think I am going to try this next time by substituting some balsamic vinegar for the sherry. I can imagine it would be excellent on duck or other game meats.

This sauce was exquisite. I didn't use a 10 year old port but on the success of the recipe decided to buy an expensive bottle of port to do it again and - if possible - improve on it with the more quality ingredient. Can imagine the reduction also complimenting small beef cuts like filet mignon and/or drizzled over pork tenderloin. It's really versatile, really easy to make and tastes of layers that suggest restaurant quality.

Wow. This Valentine's Day has been so romantic and perfect that I'm even making myself sick. But I wouldn't change a thing, and certainly not a thing about this recipe. I made it not only because it came from Le Bernardin on high, but also because it required reduced port, which I needed to make for my famous port brownies anyway. So regarding this recipe, all I have to say is make it--it's worth the effort. Less laborious are the brownies--just buy a box of brownie mix (I prefer Duncan Hines), substitute the water with port, and serve with vanilla ice cream and reduced port (without the sherry vinegar, of course). Perfect combo!

I live in a rural area so my access to "exotic" ingredients is limited and I had to do some seemly major substitutes for this recipe. After refering to Cookwise by Shirley Corriher, I decided that talapia could replace red snapper. I used average quality red wine vinegar in place of Sherry vinegar. And I used small portobella mushrooms instead of cepes. The results were amazing. We especially like the reduction sauce. I think I will use that sauce in other recipes.

I've made this a few times and it's a rich, delicious and sinful dish that is perfect for Valentine's Day or any other special occasion. It's worth making the sauce ahead of time as it takes awhile to reduce. If you're going to make this, don't skimp, especially on the porcini mushrooms. Romantic, sinful and simple.

This was not a cheap recipe to make, but the sauce was delicious. After a lot of hard work cleaning the cepes (I bought them at Whole Foods looking like they had just come from the ground), I didn't think the mushroom portion of the dish was anything special. I've never had the dish at Le Bernadin, but I would love to compare Ripert's results to mine.

Fyi to other cooks, cepes is the French word for porcini. (I went fruitlessly to 2 markets before I thought to doublecheck!)

Wow. The combination of flavors-- meatiness from the mushrooms, sweet anise from the five-spice, rich sweetness from the port-sherry vinegar sauce, and the delicate flavor of the snapper make for a well-balanced, fabulous meal. I halved the recipe for two servings, and ended up wishing that I'd made the full batch of mushrooms. Served it with a bit of garlic spinach on the side for greens. This is a great special occasion dish. I'll be making this again for company the first chance I get.
