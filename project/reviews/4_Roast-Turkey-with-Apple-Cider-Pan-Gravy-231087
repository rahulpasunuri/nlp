This would be a good recipe if all the ingredients for the gravy were actually listed! As is, it is useless.

Here is the whole ingredient list as originally written (sorry, but it won't let me do line breaks): Gravy base: 1 tbsp butter 1 lbs turkey necks and/or wings 1 lbs onions, coarsely chopped 3 C coarsely chopped celery 2 bay leaves 4 whole cloves ½ tsp salt ½ tsp ground black pepper ¼ tsp ground cinnamon 1\8 tsp ground nutmeg 6 C apple cider 3 C low-salt chicken broth 1 8-ounce Granny Smith apple, finely chopped (including core and peel) 2 tbsp honey 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar Turkey 1 16- to 17-pound turkey 1 large onion, halved, cut into 1-inch-wide wedges 1 Granny Smith apple, cut into 1-inch-wide wedges 6 bay leaves, crumbled 7 tbsp butter, room temperature, divided 2 C low-salt chicken broth Heavens knows why half the recipe disappeared...I'm just happy I already had this one saved in my "Tastebook"! I made it last year and the pan gravy was to die for...

The turkey turned out nice and juicy. The gravy was okay - but I didn't add the honey - it would have been way too sweet! It's a nice change from the normal turkey gravy.

This was a great Thanksgiving turkey. Very flavorful and the gravy was really great. Everyone enjoyed this one.

This gravy is four forks for sure! I have never heard so many compliments on gravy before. I always make an apple bacon stuffing for the turkey so the apple flavor in the gravy really worked well. Made it the day before so adding it to the turkey drippings made quick work of the gravy -- usually a high-pressure, last minute activity because everybody's ready to eat. Gravy will definitely be returning again next year. Might skip the honey though -- a bit sweet with it and probably not really necessary.

Great recipe, we loved this and serving it with a green salad with the apple cider vinaigrette! Didn't really take that much time- we thickened up the gravy with a little cornstarch. Great on Thanksgiving!

I tried the gravy only this year and thought it was fantastic--well worth the extra effort to make the base the day before. I made two changes, though. Instead of cider and honey, I added two tbsp of good apple brandy, which kept it from being too sweet. The other thing was to get two packages of McCormick low-sodium brown gravy mix, whisk the chilled base into it, and then add this to the pan juices. As soon as it hit a boil, it started to thicken, with no sacrifice in taste. Killer gravy!

I have used this recipe to prepare my Thanksgiving turkey for the past two years. It is now my staple recipe for a long time. The turkey is rich with flavor and the gravy is exquisite!

The turkey came out picture perfect and I would rate it a 4. I added fresh chopped rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper to the Irish butter I rubbed both under and on the skin. The gravy on the other hand was just too sweet and detracted from rather than enhanced the flavors of the turkey and the accompaniments. I would give the gravy a 1.

Wow. This gravy is soooo good! The turkey was beautiful and with a very light sweet taste. I have made some great turkeys. This was probably the best!

Hands down best turkey I have ever made. In order to simplify cleanup, made the gravy base in an oven proof pan disposable , and not on the stove

It's a great dish. The turkey came out just perfectly! My wife and I agreed that the gravy was a bit too rich and overpowering (and I don't know how you'd get the right thickness without adding some flour or corn starch...) The crime in the recipe is the suggestion to discard the giblets and celery. I took all the giblets and some of the celery and put it in the stuffing, and YUM! Also, I took the apples and onions from inside the bird and served them over the meat with great success.

The turkey was good, if somewhat minimalist; we had an organic rare-breed turkey and didn't want to cover up the flavor. The gravy, on the other hand... I simmered it for a good 45 minutes and it was still well over four cups. I ended up adding flour to thicken it. It came out fine, I just quesiton the method.

I made a version of this recipe for XMAS. Since I had made in advance the gravy from "Roast Turkey with Cider Sage Gravy" (on this site), I didn't make this particular gravy, but I will next time. I did stuff the cavity as directed, rubbed the dried bird with unsalted butter and generously peppered it. In lieu of dumping broth over it, I basted it every 30 minutes with the pan drippings and a solution of 7 oz. Swanson fat-free, 1/3 less sodium broth, 1-1/2 Tbs. lemon juice, 1/8 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. each of dried crushed basil and thyme leaves (i.e. 1/2 of the recipe for "Herb Roasted Turkey" on www.swansonbroth.com). I poured the pan juices into the already prepared gravy and thickened it a bit with flour/water. This was THE MOST MOIST AND WONDERFUL TASTING TURKEY AND GRAVY THAT I HAVE EVER MADE!!!

Excellent! I would also recommend brining with a solution that includes cider - the flavor is very subtle, but it makes such a difference for keeping the meat moist. Served with the New England apple/sausage stuffing recipe for an apple-themed meal

Although I didn't follow the turkey recipe exactly (I brined it before roasting), I would like to comment on the gravy - it was delicious, a nice combination of flavors, and as mentioned before, plenty of it. I will definitely make this again!

I have now found my Thanksgiving turkey recipe. The gravy was delicious and there was, for once, plenty of it. I brined my organic turkey for 14 hours in a half gallon of apple cider, 4 cups water, 1/2 c kosher salt, 1/2 cup sugar, 3 cloves, 1 t. peppercorns, 2 bay leaves, and 1 t. whole allspice (crushed spices first). I took the turkey out of the mixture several hours prior to roasting for the skin to dry out. I then cooked the turkey as directed in the recipe. This was the first time the white meat was moist and delicious. I couldn't believe how well it turned out!

This turkey was sooo good! I recommend adding chopped fresh herbs to the butter before rubbing (I used 3 tbsp. each parsley, sage, marjoram and thyme). The turkey looked nice and made the gravy outstanding!!!

I made this for our annual beach turkey last summer and it was so good I'm making it for Thanksgiving, replacing several other excellent recipes here as our new favorite.
