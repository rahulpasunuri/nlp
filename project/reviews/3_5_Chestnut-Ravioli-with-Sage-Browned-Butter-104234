My hubby was a little skeptical of this dish at first, but was pleasantly surprised once he took a bite. My 8 year old son even enjoyed the dish (although he thought there was bit too much butter). I roasted fresh chestnuts a friend had given me for this dish and made the filling a day ahead (used a food processor to mix the filling, omitted the apple and then let it warm to room temp the day of cooking) and made fresh pasta dough for the ravioli. Was worth the time and effort. My husband even asked me to make pierogies using this filling :)

I enjoyed these--served them as a duo with some pumpkin ravioli as an appetizer--guests enjoyed them. I added a tablespoon of Calvados and flambeed them before simmering--I think this added a nice apple-y dimension. I found that after the recommended cooking time the chestnuts were still far from being cooked--they remained very waxy. I had to add a bit of water and simmer them for two or three times as long as recommended before they were at all tender. Even so, I had to use a food processor to puree them or they would have been too chunky. [I used fresh chestnuts and roasted them myself as directed]

So the stuffer flavoring is tasty, however when i boiled the raviolies they fell apart and those that did not stuck together and fell apart when i tried to put them in the butter. Anyway my whole dish turned into a goolash instead of ravioli. In the end i think you have to do each ravioli separately.

I made this dish when it was first featured in 2000 and have been making it annually as a first course for Thanksgiving ever since. Yes, it IS time-consuming and definitely a labour-of-love, but so unique & special that it is worth it. My only variant to the written recipe was to substitute applewood-smoked bacon for the pancetta for added richness(although the pancetta also works well); and to use a plastic dumpling press (Joyce Chen makes a good one), which has the added benefit of saving some time AND shapng into pretty half-moons with ruffled edges (easier to cook too). Enjoy!

well, i would definitely use pre-peeled chestnuts next time. we substituted diced veggie canadian bacon for pancetta, plus added diced mushrooms, extra parmesan and 3 tblspns ricotta-- great! a note, though: i would drain each ravioli on a rack in the sink next time instead of a colander...they all got kind of lumped together and were hard to separate from the big mass. otherwise, though, fabulous. we made a big batch and had them as an entree; lovely. cheers!

We served this at our New Year's Eve dinner and again a week later. Though it is time-consuming, it is well worth the effort. I'll make this again and again.

I made this as an appetizer for a New Years party a few years ago. It was such a HUGE hit, I'm doing it again this year. I used wonton wrappers also. Made the filling ahead. Made the raviolis ahead so all I had to do is finish the dish. I used fresh chestnuts, which increases the prep time. Yummy.

This recipe was so good. We used 1/2 can [about 8oz.) of the Whole Foods chestnut puree which made the mixture moist. We were surprised about how well the ingredients married and made such a flavorful dish. We did use wonton wrappers and probably would have been better with fresh pasta but convenient and still very good. Don't hesitate to make this for guests...we really loved it.

This recipe was excellent. I made it as a main course but think it would be better as a first course (as suggested) because it is pretty heavy. To cut down on time (it does take more than an hour) I used the pure chestnut puree available from Whole Foods. It made the filling smoother and was far easier to work with.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The filling came out very stiff and it did not "lighten" up from cooking the ravioli. The filling was very tasty but didn't seem to work in the totality. I suppose I was expecting it to be better than it was because of the rather unusual combination of ingredients.

This recipe was exquisite! I didn't change a thing. I also used the roasted chestnuts from Williams Sonoma to save time. The contrast between the "sweet" chestnut filling and the tart apple was perfect. This is a great recipe for holiday entertaining.

This took quite a bit longer then the recipe said, but I expected that. I doubled it and cut the bacon since I was cooking for vegetarians and it was hands down the favorite dish of the evening. I was also a bit liberal with the sage, which helped beef up the flavor.

I thought this was a fantastic dish, but unless you're a professional ravioli maker there's no way you're completing it in an hour. While, the other respondent took 1 1/2 hours, it took me closer to two. However, in the end it was well worth it. The apples marinated in lemon juice adds a lot of of acidity to what otherwise might be too rich a dish. P.S. don't be afraid to add salt to the ravioli mixture.

This dish is the kind of thing that I enjoy discovering at restaurants with very creative chefs. I made it last night for my family, and I am certain to make it again for guests. It took a bit longer than the recipe suggested--about an hour and a half--with a good chunk of the time spent assembling the ravioli. One warning: it is rather tricky to get the ravioli from the pot to the plate. I removed them one at a time from the pot with a slotted spoon and put them in a colander to drain as instructed, but they stuck together in the colander and it was not easy to pull them apart without tearing them. They were well worth the effort though. I may try putting them directly into a bowl with the butter sauce next time. I varied the recipe slightly, using bacon rather than pancetta. I cooked the bacon and then set it aside. I used the bacon drippings to cook the onion and garlic and so on, but didn't include the bacon in the filling. Instead, I put it in the sauce. All in all, a great dish!
