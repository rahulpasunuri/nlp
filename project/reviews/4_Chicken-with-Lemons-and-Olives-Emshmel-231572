I just arrived back from Morocco and had a very similar dish. I didn't have preserved lemons and next time I make this I will use them. I crushed the saffron into a power and used it at the end. It gives the dish more color and more flavor.

OMG. I have been wanting to make this recipe forever, but couldn't get my hands on preserved lemons, so finally made my own (Paula's recipe on this site, which was bright and terrific). This is incredible. So much better even than it looks. I was dubious since you don't brown the chicken. Thought it would have a bland flavor and the skin would be hanging but it just works. I am in Japan and the chickens don't come with livers so didn't use the livers but was fantastic anyway. Will try to get the livers next time and try that. I am just blown away by this recipe. Will serve with couscous and maybe a green salad with pomogranate seeds. Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Chicken-with-Lemons-and-Olives-Emshmel-231572#ixzz12t8YLf3W

Never cooked or touched a chicken liver before, and after they cooked in the broth, I tasted one (delicious!!!), even before I mashed it into the onions. The liver is the secret ingredient for sure. Did not take 30 mns working time. Much longer but worth it. My family LOVED this chicken. I only used breasts and legs since that's all we like.

absolutely amazing. I had this dish all the time in morocco and this recipe captures all the essential flavors. I made it in a large tagine instead of a crock pot. I also didnt have preserved lemons so i added a spoonful of indian lime relish with big chunks of preserved lime in it that i had in the fridge. This most definitely changed the flavor and made it less traditional but tasted amazing. I'm excited to make my own preserved lemon and maybe my own lime relish this summer!!!

Really loved this -- rave reviews from me and the bf. Will try to add currants next time; might also add fresh herbs at the end over the top to brighten the flavor (altho' that's hardly a problem with the preserved lemons). Might also add some kale to this to have some greens in the dish, or add them alongside.

Delicious! I made this on a weeknight and did make changes. Used a cut up chicken (1 1/2 chickens), did not marinate overnight -but rubbed the salt (~2 tsp) & minced garlic into the chicken & let it sit for about 1/2 hour before cooking. Used white wine (why use water when wine is available?) plus some broth. Also didn't have preserved lemons, so instead used grated lemon peel of 2 lemons. Finally, I thought the tangy sauce could use just a slight sweet contrast, so I threw in about 1/2 black currants. It was wonderful!!! The cilantro made the sauce at the end. Loved this one! Will make again next time w/ preserved lemons.

Very light flavor, smooth blend of flavors. We only preserved the lemons for 3 days with the spices, in a mason jar, but it came out fine. We didn't rinse the salt or garlic off the chicken after preparing it. It didn't need to be marinated overnight, since it is boiled, anyway. The couscous was really good with the sauce ladled over it.

This was absolutely wonderful! The first time I made it exactly as written, but we had to fight with the chicken bones from the oh so tender chicken. Since then I have used a homemade concentrated chicken stock for the water and boneless skinless chicken thighs and breasts. Turned out great. It is definitely worth searching out the preserved lemons. Their flavour is outstanding!

This came out perfectly. The chicken was wonderfully tender with a lot of flavour. We did not have pickled lemons so we used fresh lemons with half as much lemon juice.

This was the most delicious dish ever! I couldn't find preserved lemons, so I used lemon zest. It was very good, but I'm anxious to try it with the real thing. I can't imagine the dish being any better though. The chicken was incredibly tender and the flavors were rich and delicious. A definite keeper!

This is a truly wonderful dish. I used free-range chickens, and they were absolutely succulent and flavored to the bone. There are many variations on this recipe in Moroccan cuisine, and I enjoyed the combination of ginger and cumin. I had never cooked with chicken livers before, and (although they looked a little scary) they did wonders for the sauce. Also, don't leave out the preserved lemons -- they're amazing. I served this with couscous, Herb Jam with Olives and Lemon, Small Semolina Griddle Breads, and phyllo pastries from a local Middle Eastern bakery. This dinner was divine!

This was amazing! I did like the cumin. Next time, I'll serve with couscous. I used preserved lemons I prepared in December - but like this recipe better and happened to find Meyers lemons - so I have a batch brewing and await the results with great anticipation! For a 1st course, I served ROASTED EGGPLANT AND GARLIC SALAD WITH TOMATOES folded into romaine lettuce leaves....

I lived in Morocco and learned to make this dish there. I often cooked for Moroccans and they always said that the food was delicious and authentic, thanks to Wolfert's book. One important change: do NOT add cumin to this recipe. Cumin doesn't belong in a chicken dish with ginger in Moroccan cuisine.
