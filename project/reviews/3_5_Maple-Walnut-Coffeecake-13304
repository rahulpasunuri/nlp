Have been making this cake since 1993 and it's a favorite with family and co-workers. I use a buttered 8 x 8 x 3 pan with a parchment "sling" for easy removal. Grade B syrup (Trader Joe's) does make a big difference in flavor.

This is THE ONLY coffee cake I bake. It has been a family favorite for several years. The original recipe written in the magazine calls for a springform pan...this one does not....a bit confusing.

This recipe has been a favorite with my family since it appeared in Gourmet. The maple flavor distinguishes it from my other coffeecakes.

I loved this coffeecake. so did my family! But i don't think you need so much crumb for the top. Otherwise it was delish!

People complaining about weak maple taste: Buy Grade B syrup. You can get it in Trader Joe's in the US or on Ebay most of the time. It has a much more pronounced flavor and when I use it in baking the maple flavor is quite strong, which I happen to like a lot. If you can't get grade B, try boiling the maple syrup so that it reduces and then use the reduced syrup, it will make a big difference. I also replaced most of the brown sugar with maple sugar. This cake disappeared.

Since it was first pubished in '93, this has been my favorite coffee cake to serve with brunch -- especially for occasions such as New Year's Day. The springform pan is a must, and not using one must surely have been the cause of poor results cited by the cook from New Haven. Always moist and rich, a small piece goes a long way. I like to warm it slightly before serving, making it even moister.

There are two purely technical problems with this recipe. First, it calls for 1 teaspoon of salt in the batter, which seemed like too much to me, so I added only 1/2 tsp. The second problem is that it doesn't specify that you need to use a springform pan. I read the instructions quite a while before making the actual cake, so I forgot that it hints at this only at the end of the recipe. I used a regular 9" cake pan, and as a result I think the cake was shorter and denser that it should have been. That said, I also do not like the taste of this cake at all. It's not sweet enough, and the maple flavor is really weak. It also has an unpleasant coarse texture that makes it seem more like brown bread than coffee cake. Perhaps it was the pan I baked it in? After it was finished, I immediately proposed giving it away to friends or coworkers, but my husband persuaded me to keep it. It's been five days since I made it, and there's still half of it sitting around the house. We're not too enthusiastic about eating it. I will not be making it again, that's for sure!

Absolutely wonderful! I've made this recipe ever since it came out in '93. I usually prepare it during the holidays and it's the first one gone every time. It is a little time consuming, but so worth it!!! The topping is a little crumbly for my taste so I've been playing with the recipe a little: sometimes I add a little more maple syrup or liquid and sometimes I put a sheet of foil over the cake to keep the top from drying out. You'll love this coffee, hot cocoa, hot cider or any other warm or chilled beverage of your choice!

Fairly time consuming. In my opinion, not worth the effort. Strong butter taste as well.

While this cake was nice and moist, I was not enchanted with it. My husband and guests, however, loved it. Perhaps the problem is that for me, coffee cake requires lots of cinnamon, which this cake does not have. I would say try it, if you love maple and like a nice moist coffeecake.

Everytime I make this cake, I have to double the recipe! This cake goes FAST! The maple syrup gives this cake such a delicious flavor, along with the sour cream. It is perfect served with breakfast, lunch, or dinner! Anytime is perfect!
