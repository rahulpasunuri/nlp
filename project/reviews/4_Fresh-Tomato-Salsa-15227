This salsa is a perfect summer snack! For ease, I don't worry about seeding the tomatoes and pulse the ingredients in the food processor; if my family deems it too "juicy," we strain off a bit of the liquid and then add the lime juice.

Delicious recipe! Great way to use up seasonal produce this time of year. Love it!

This is a really good quick salsa.... I omitted the sugar as I prefer more of the lime flavor but how can you go wrong? Loved it...

Yum! At first taste it's a little unexpectedly sweet, but with a good hot pepper it's a perfect combo of hot and sweet. So glad I found this before my farmshare bounty of tomatoes went mushy.

This makes a simple yet tasty salsa, but don't make more than you need because the tomatoes break down after the first day.

Made this for our annual Halloween Bash! And it was GONE! A perfect fresh salsa, and so easy to make. So many people asked for the recipe. I did use only one small habanero. Still super spicy. It is a keeper and is now my ONLY tomato salsa recipe. No more roasting, baking or complications.

Our garden has an abundance of cherry tomatoes, so I used those coarsely chopped but unseeded. That was the only deviation I made from the recipe as given. I used one serrano pepper and one jalapeno peper, also from our garden. Declared "awesome" by my daughter-in- law. The other five people around the table must have liked it too, because the salsa was gone (save a chip with the last bit of salsa, saved for me to taste)by the time I got out to the deck with my drink. The fresh tomatoes and cilantro are key. The salsa does have a bit of a kick, which we like, but if you have a group that does not like "hot" salsa, less garlic and milder peppers would be the way to go.

This recipe was incredibly easy and delicious. I don't believe it needs any alterations though I did add sweet yellow corn which added a bit more color and sweetness.

How long can I keep this in my refrigerator? Will this freeze well?

I doubled this recipe for a crowd. Made the following modifications: 1. Doubled the garlic. 2. Omitted sugar. 3. Added half of a ripe fresh pineapple, trimmed & cored. (I used this amount for the doubled recipe, so just 1/4 for the regular recipe.) 4. Threw all ingredients in the food processor (did not pre-chop much)and whirled it around until it was salsa-like. I got RAVE reviews on this salsa & it's so wonderfully fresh. After the pineapple, the doubled recipe yielded about 6 cups.

This is a great recipe for salsa fresca. I can't mess with the stuff in jars any more, and I wouldn't change anything about this recipe. Be sure to use good tomatoes, though.

Excellent fresh salsa, so much better than store bought. I used a bit less sugar as my yellow & red tomatoes fresh from the garden were sweet. I added a little good olive oil based on other reviews, this recipe is a keeper!

I used 1lb cherry tomatoes and 1 can of chopped tomatoes, drained. No coriander. I loved it. So easy. I just pulsed everything.

This is easy and fresh---spin it Italian by using EVOO and RedWine or BalsamicVinegar and Lots of Fresh Basil replacing the cilantro for Bruschestta or spin it Mid Easterrn adding Cukes, Mint and Dill with Toasted Pitas.--Watch the oil and skip the sugar-- this is meant to be light! Summer tomatoes RULE!

This salsa is wonderful. My husband says it's the best he's had. I also left the sugar in but used about half of the amount called for in the recipe. I also added a little salt and some red pepper flakes (since I had no more jalapenos).

This is a perfect salsa. I dumped everything in the Cuisinart and pulsed a dozen times. It was delicious.

I have just made this in advance for tonight to serve with burritos. I also increased lime to 2T, added a pinch of ground cumin and halved the sugar to 1/2tsp. I also added cucumber as I like the cool flavor it lends to the dish. Tasting it now it was lovely, I'm sure by tonight it'll be magnificent!

Excellent! Simple but awesome!! I added a couple slugs of EVO at the end which gave it some added flavor and a nice finish to the salsa. You got to love the freshness of the dish. So much better than store bought it's not even close. Worth the extra effort.

Like others, I doubled the garlic, but also added some toasted cumin.

A great starter recipe with many variations to made. I omitted the sugar and added fresh corn. First time roasted-garlic too and the second with fresh steamed corn and mince garlic. Prefer red onions in it though.

This is a great ordinary salsa recipe. For more spice, add another hot pepper! I also added some cucumber to it. I think it is better served chilled.

Delicious, fresh, simple. Takes 15 mins to prepare. The cilantro and lime tastes fantastic. I've made many different grilled salsas...this fresh one is the best!

This is a great recipe! One of my favorites. I think the sugar is a great touch, it helps meld all of the flavors together. The Fresh Lime juice really makes it taste incredible. It takes forever to chop everything up, but well worth the effort. Tried it once in a food processor, but it just wasn't the same.

Awsome salsa! This one is definitely one of my favorites that I love to make all year round. I usually keep the sugar in the recipe, unless I'm adding fruit to it. The suggar adds a yummy sweetness to it!

Terrific tasting, and so easy to prepare. I increased the garlic and omitted the sugar (like others), and will definitely be using this recipe in the future. Went great with Fried Fish Tacos (on this site).

Very good salsa recipe. I doubled the garlic, added salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper, and threw in just a little oil and vinegar to meld it together. It's been such a hit, I have to double the recipe everytime I make it.

A wonderful and simple salsa. Most ingredients on hand. I added 1TBSP garlic instead of 1tsp. Glad I found this one.

I, too, played with this recipe. I omitted the jalapenos (not sure how this fares with traditionalists) and it turned out fine! I also added a dash of ground cumin seed, fine sea salt, and fresh ground pepper. Absolutely wonderful! You couldn't buy stuff this good!

Excellent salsa, especially using a variety of garden tomatoes (red, yellow, striped). I substitute Italian parsley for the cilantro, and I use plenty of lime.

What a fantastic salsa and so easy to make! I served it to my neighbors and they raved about it. I had some left over and had it the next day. It was very watery and twice as spicy but still great. We just spooned it on the tortilla chips. I used jalapeno slices from a jar instead of fresh jalapeno chilis because I had them in the refrigerator. It didn't make any difference. Fantastic!!!!

We loved this salsa. I peeled the tomatoes because garden tomatoes are easy - no blanching. Also, I seed over a strainer and save the juice for soup, liquid in machine bread intstead of water, or add salt and drink. I also added a teaspoon of olive oil. Just a small change but I thought it added to the taste. My husband is a real salsa lover and he ate most of it in one sitting. I asked him in advance to save me some and that's the only reason I got any.
