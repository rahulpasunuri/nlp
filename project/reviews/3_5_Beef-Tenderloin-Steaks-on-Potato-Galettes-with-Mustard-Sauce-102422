I've made this so many times, one of my all time favorites. I definitely recommend low-sodium broth though...

This is excellent. It is important to use broth which has not been salted or, low salt broth otherwise the sauce is too salty.

Terrific and original recipe! I also added half an egg to the potato mixture, and some cognac to the mustard sauce. The next time I will substitute the breadcrumbs for cornstarch to give the galettes a bit of sweetness. They were also much easier to make than I initially thought. They were almost instantly firm and steady, due to the fact that I had added the egg. I served it with peas.

try using your own broth, you can have it as salty as you desire. this recipe is a stepping stone so add to it. use your imagination, only use a recipe one time then try something different that goes to your taste. it was good

I found this much too salty as well and I did omit the salt on the steaks and the galettes. I added some cream to the reduced sauce and that seemed to help alot. But for the amount of work of all the different parts...I don't think it was worth it.

Wonderful dish, I prepared it for Valentine's and my husband loved it. The only thing was we found it a little too salty... so I would use low sodium chicken and beef stock to lower sodium even further. Delish!

I didn't find this too salty, but I didn't salt the galette or the steaks and used very low salt broth. My galettes were too thick... Next time I'll make them much thinner. Otherwise it was very tasty and I served with roasted carrot slices.

I've never rated a recipe and said I would not make it again. But this one was not worth the effort. The sauce was awful (far too salty - and I like salt).

As a new cook, I found this recipe to be very easy and very tasty. Everyone loved it! All my guests wanted the recipe! My only mistake was not making enough for seconds! They all wanted more! I had leftover sauce too!!

I loved this recipe! It is the first time I have made potato pancakes with success. I followed the instructions for them exactly, only substituting chives for the shallots. The sauce was also fantastic. I didn't have a problem with its saltiness. I used reduced salt chicken stock and I did not salt the steaks or the galettes. I also omitted the butter at the end. I thought this was easy, particularly because you can make the sauce ahead of time and the cooking times are short. We had it with grilled asparagus and it was done in no time.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I can't wait to make it for my friends. I added a tablespoon of cornstartch and whipping cream to my sauce.

We also really enjoyed this meal. The galettes were simple and tasty. I agree with others about the salt content and having a plain colourful veggie side dish such as carrots and snowpeas. A light fruit dessert would also be nice.

Very good tasting meal.I would like to know how to cut the salt from the broths,probably have to make my own.This meal is well worth trying,if you have not tried it SHAME ON YOU!

I've since made this several times after my first review, and it's very good. Too many martini's the first time around! The galettes make a welcomed change to the steak.

I have made this since the recipe appeared in the issue of Bon Appetit. It's fabulous! The sauce is incredible, but you really need to use the lowest low-salt broth on this one! One night, I accidentally left out the butter, but it still tasted wonderful! The galettes are super too. With the beef steaks served atop the galettes, they absorb the wonderful juices and sauce and really make the meal. I wouldn't make the beef without the galettes!

This dish is delicious, but definitely one of those "special occasion" meals that is more pricey and time-consuming to make. Its also very rich but needs a small, light side dish for variety, maybe steamed veggies. I also agree with the tip to use low-sodium broth.

Very tasty and plates beautifully. My guests were impressed. I would, however, next time, use low sodium beef broth as well, as it was somewhat salty. I served mine with a side of fried crimini mushrooms and stir fried peppers on a bed of frisee.

Made this for a romantic dinner for 2 and it was amazing. Of course, it all depends on the quality of the beef, so splurge and get the best for this.

Definete Keeper. Potatoes did brown quickly so watch them carefully. This recipe is great for a small dinner party.

I made this for my friends this past weekend and WOW - the raves were unending. I've cooked for them quite a bit, so they are used to having "elegant" fare, but this was clearly one of the all-time winners. I found this completely easy to prepare, and don't know why some reviewers found the potato prep difficult. It was a breeze. Did have to add a little more broth to reduction, but that's it. My guests had barely finished before they were asking me when I'd make it again! Thanks for a great recipe.

The potatoes were a little difficult to make, but once the dish came together, our guests LOVED it. I cooked dinner for 8, so I had to adjust the recipe accordingly. I served it with asparagus in an egg and cream sauce. YUMMY!!!

I really love this dish. I made the galettes too big once so that the potatoes weren't quite as good so make sure to get as much potatoes surface to the pan as possible.

Delicious, easy and elegant served with simple steamed vegetables for colour.

This recepie is very simiar to Emmince de vou Zurricvous.Which is a tradinonal swiss cooking only the patatoes are called "rostýe" and better than the galettes.

Its a very "K.I.S.S." recipe and I'm not saying that its bad, but It sounds like it could use a little bit more color, maby some colorful vegetables or a functional garnish in the sauce. Although it is a quick and easy recipe to make at home.
