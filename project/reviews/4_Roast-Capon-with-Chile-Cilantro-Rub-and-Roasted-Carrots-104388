Easy and delicious! Used chicken broth instead of water as recommended by others. Also added potatoes to the carrots. Excellent recipe!

The rub was fabulous. I marinated my chicken in it for about three hours before baking. Definitely serve with the colorado sauce! If I make it again, I'll add potatoes to the pan. The carrots turned out wonderfully but potatoes or parsnips would have been so tasty soaking up the sauce!!

I make this without the carrots because Hubby can't stand them. But we seriously lurv this. I make extra chili butter mixture and use it to saute plain chicken breasts, too.

This recipe deserves four forks for the concept - it's a really good one - but zero forks for the directions. The roasting time is way off. Anyone who wants a bird that's still juicy should cut the cooking time by about an hour. The recipe actually recommends cooking it to 170 degrees - which is an appropriate temperature. However, there is no way an 8-lb unstuffed bird at room temperature is going to take 2 hrs and 45 minutes in a 375 degree oven to reach 170 degrees. As another reviewer or two pointed out, the carrots don't need all that cooking either. They could go in the last hour, wouldn't need any water, and would caramelize beautifully. Instead of the Chili Sauce, I served the bird with Chipotle Cranberry Sauce (that was a real hit) and the recipe is from Epicurious. I used canned chipotles rather then the dried ones, at the recommendation of other reviewers. Rounded out the meal with cornbread stuffing and broccoli.

Tonight was the second time we've made this, and it was the best chicken I can remember ever having eaten. It was perfectly moist and wonderfully flavorful. The carrots are TO DIE for! Sweet, but complex with all the caramelization. Tried a different pepper in the sauce and it was too bitter to eat, but didn't miss it this time. Totally off season in almost-May, but delicious!

This is beautiful and delicious. I, too, used chicken broth instead of water but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The Colorado Sauce is a must. The Potato and Green Chile Gratin is an excellent side. Nothing healthy here, but who cares!

Excellent!!! I used split chicken breasts with skin and chicken stock instead of water. After roasting I reduced the sauce for about 5 min. Fantastic.

I did change something. I added no water. THere was enough butter at the bottom of the pan to cook the carrots.

Carrots and cumin work well together, for me. They are perfect with this bird. An easy and very tasty recipe that we will enjoy again and again. I didn't change a thing.

Have made this several times now, and I have a couple of refinements. I wait about an hour to put the carrots in. I splash in some chicken broth (not water) when I start the chicken, more when adding carrots, and more when basting if the liquid gets low. I always end up freezing about 1/2 the sauce for next time. This has become one of my all-time favorite recipes!

This was FANTASTIC! I used chicken and omitted the butter. I found it very quick and easy to prepare...I roasted whole cumin and then crushed it. Barbecued the chicken.

Awesome. Not a quickie, especially if you make the sauce (and do look up "Scoville units" of the chiles before shopping in case you need to substitute), but well worth the effort.

Magnificent use of the chile. Subtle yet decisive. It has won rave reviews both sides pf the atlantic

I don't know whats up with my tastebuds but I didn't like this. I couldn't find the exact peppers for the sauce so substituted one with another kind. The sauce tasted 2 dimensional to me. I ended up adding bitter chocolate to make more like a mole. Too much effort but the results.

The flavor was wonderful but the bottom side stayed very white and unappetizing looking. I carved the Capon in the kitchen and brought it to the table sliced and with the Chili Colorado Sauce drizzeled over it and everyone liked it.

Capon is a wonderful bird and traditional in France/Luxembourg around Christmas. I can't understand why there are only 2 recipes for capon in this whole collection. But this one is great, if not exactly seasonal. I did not make the sauce as there were enough pan juices for my taste. Also, I used chicken broth instead of water, which also helped. Served with polenta and green salad. Try this instead of turkey.

Absolutely fantastic. Cook on the Weber and it's even better.

Love it! Have made twice for dinner parties. Both times, huge hit. Be careful with seasoning the colorado sauce. Add vinegar and salt to tast but do it a bit a time as once it's in it ain't gettin' out. The Potato and Poblano gratin goes great with this (again, remember that poblanos vary quite a bit heat-wise. Make all the peppers but taste a bit after roasting before deciding how much to use in the gratin).

I made this in Seattle for Christmas dinner for a family that was in various stages of stomach flu recovery. They all loved it and wished they felt a bit better and could eat more. So I made it again in 2001 for Christmas dinner and it drew absolute raves. Make the whole dinner--the vegetables are wonderful!

Excellent recipe. Being from the southwestern US, we enjoyed the spicy flavor and the addition of the lime juice.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I added a little lime juice to the rub, and also squeezed some over the roasting chicken I used before putting it in the oven the first time. I also threw the squeezed limes and a cubed onion in the cavity for a little extra flavor. Added baby potatoes and more onion to the carrots. Turned out great! Everyone raved. Now I keep thinking of more people I want to make this excellent dish for.

This turns out beautiful. The cilantro/chili gives a gorgeous color to the skin. The carrots are completely saturated in fat but taste great. DEFINITELY take the time to make the accompanying colorado sauce.

Fantastic. I used the capon but I think I will try a roasting chicken next time.

We used a roaster chicken and it came out great. Tasty, juicy with a little bit of spice. My husband really enjoyed it. The Red Chile Sauce is a very nice compliment.

This recipe was fabulous. I made it for company and they raved. Though it calls for an 8lb capon, they are hard to find. Consequently the one I cooked (6.5 lbs) took about 1/2 hour less to cook.

This was the best roast chicken i have ever made! I used Ancho Powder and an extra garlic clove...and the flavor permeated throughout the whole bird. It was super duper moist..and everyone who had it could not stop eating it...it was picked clean to the bone! I highly recommend that Epicurious also put this under the Roast Chicken category..*as most people would not look up capon at first*...so all can try this incredible recipe! They will not be disappointed!

Sumptuous, definitely! My husband relented and agreed to this dish for Xmas day's main meal. It was fabulous. Basting religiously every 20mins kept the capon wonderfully moist and tender. We would definitely cook it again!

Incredible with the red coronado sauce!
