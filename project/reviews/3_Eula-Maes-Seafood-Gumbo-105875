It was interesting from a historical standpoint. This was an authentic recipe from a long line of Cajun folks. It was somewhat plain or bland unless you added tabasco. The File powder needs to be mixed into the bowl otherwise the powder gets stuck in your throat! File is crushed sassafras tree leaves. Tastes somewhat like tea leaves. I think this type of dish was improved upon by the creole influence where they added white wine, tomatoes. sausage, and okra.

The recipe for Seafood Gumbo in Eula Mae's Cajun Kitchen cookbook is more complete than the one listed here. Add some okra and chopped tomatoes and laissez les bon temps rouler!

It's a great recipe. Like others, I find a recipe for a start and then do my own thing. Even though I'm not from the south, I always use okra in my gumbo. And usually add tomatoes. But I am amazed at the comments...did those people never use or heard of peanut oil? I can't believe that they used peanut butter but it's the ONLY explanation of why their gumbo had any peanut butter taste! Ah, the things people do,ya gotta love it!

Followed this to the letter, including the long process of making the stock with the shrimp shells, frying bacon to get some of the fat for the roux, and then the tedious roux itself, and found this very disappointing. "Bland" is the best description I can come up with.

This is about the most authentic recipe I've seen. Growing up in one of New Orleans' oldest families (since 1721), I think I know what I am talking about. The only differences I can see is the use of butter instead of oil, and we used just about everything we had on hand including chicken, beef, and pork. My father only used Gulf shrimp and sometimes liked to use the same kind of salt pork he used for red beans and rice when making his Thanksgiving Gumbo. Oh, and go with the "brick" roux and file'!!!!

Listen up folks - the key to this gumbo is using bacon grease for the roux. Whenever you cook bason, let the extra grease cool and put in a jar with lid and keep in fridge. It takes alomost 45 mins for roux to be right color. Also, when you serve it, put small scoop of white rice in a mound and put gumbo around rice and sprinkle with green onion. If you can, use large prawns AND med prawns, chicken wings cut in pcs and lots of chunks of andouille sausage, lots of crab, oysters.. You wont be disappointed if you follow my directions. I make this every year and my Southern african american friends say its authentic and I'm chinese !

We thought this was an above average gumbo. Per someone else's comment I used butter to make my roux and cooked until it was a milk chocolate color. I pretty much adhered to the recipe except for the change in the type of fat used. I also added cayenne for some heat.

From a cook in New Iberia to the cook in Metarie. Cajun is roux and file while Creole is tomatoes and okra. Both versions of seafood gumbo are wonderful, but from someone who lives about 10 miles from Eula Mae, I'll go with the brown roux and file.

I'd make this again, only I have a couple of dislikes, such as oysters and I think in this case okra would do better than the file. But, of course, that's MY opinion!

Made this this weekend for our Mardi Gras event. Tripled the recipe, and it was great. But, not familiar with seafood cooking (midwest person), I cooked the gumbo far to long. I thought I could let it simmer until my guests wanted to eat. By that time, the shrimp were chewy - My mistake. Will try again, but I'll sub. butter for the oil as the last reviewer suggests (The glass of wine idea is a good one -making the roux is a bit tedious!).

The key is in the roux. Peanut oil is fine, but I use butter in a 1-1 ratio with the flour. Low and slow til it's the right color; I like to use "milk chocolate" as my color guide. Too fast and if it burns, and you gotta start over! I pour a nice big glass of white wine to keep me company while I stir a roux since it takes 20-30 minutes of constant attention. I use home made chicken stock as a base, and add my shrimp shells to it for an hour or two, then strain. This is a good recipe to build on with your own preferences. I like shrimp, chicken, sausage, okra, and some Gulf blue crab meat, with the claws hangin' out over the bowl for dramatic effect!

Ahem, dear cook from, uhm, ERIE,did you say?...first it's impolite to call someone "stupid," especially in light of your own gross misinformation, and secondly, it would be pretty difficult to make a roux that SMELLS like peanut butter, much less tastes as such. Were one to actually READ the recipe, it says to brown the roux until it is the COLOR of peanut butter. Among cooks here, it's a common reference to gauging when the color is right. Also, the use of peanut oil here in New Orleans is quite popular, especially when frying seafood. It does not in any way impart a peanut taste to food. I thought this recipe was pretty good, and I've had no less than a few dozen versions of seafood gumbo in my lifetime. It's a melange, and each cook has his or her own little tweaks to add. If anyone's seafood gumbo tastes remotely like peanut butter, it's either your imagination, or you've managed to put in something wrong along the way.

Are you stupid. You are not supposed to put peanut butter in the soup.(Make the ROUX until it SMELLS like peanut butter!) Now I followed the directions properly and th soup came out great.

I'm a transplanted Southern Boy who was homesick until I found this recipe and made it for my friends last thanksgiving.

After reading the recipe and a few reviews, I decided the key for me was to DEVIATE. Vegetable oil instead of peanut oil with the amount of oil and flour cut in half. I also added 4 plum tomatoes to the mix. Instead of oysters, I used scallops. Everything else pretty much was by your book. Extremely good. You know a dish is good when the kids ask for seconds and don't know what they're eating. A little deviation and this dish is a keeper!

What a disappointment! Despite following the recipe to a T, it ended up tasting like peanut butter soup. Very bland and boring -- I had to use tons of salt to make it even palatable. The boxed varieties tasted better than this!

I've had gumbo many times throughout the years, this one's the best i've every had. In the interest of cutting costs,I even substituted imitation crab meat for the real thing and it was still excellent. My family loved it as well, and thats saying something!

Yuck! This tasted like peanut butter paste. I followed the instructions exactly - ISH! then I added some okra, a couple of red chili peppers, more shrimp sauce and a can of tomatoes to cut the paste and give some flavor. Then we dumped it out and called for pizza. To be fair, I don't usually use much oil in my cooking, so the peanut oil was overwhelming for me. If you insist on trying this recipe, try cutting the oil to 1/2 cup and mix half and half with olive or canola oil. The okra helped.

Me OH My! This is the BEST Gumbo I've ever made! And maybe the best I've ever had (& I lived in N'awlins for 20 years). I couldn't find File, so I added okra: about a cup. I like my gumbo spicy, but in consideration of my guests, I put the Tabasco on the table. This will become the sandard by which any other gumbo is measured.

I made this dish to eat while watching the Superbowl, and my boyfriend and I loved it! The peanut oil gave the roux just that special something.... Instead of oysters, I used scallops, and it was still delicious. While in the midst of cooking, I realized that I hadn't made enough shrimp broth with the shells as suggested. To remedy this, I added a can of chicken broth as it was the only substitute I had on hand. You can mix and match meats in a gumbo, right? The result was wonderful. It's a relatively easy recipe with great opportunities to improvise and explore. I'll definitely make it again.
