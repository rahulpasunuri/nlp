Absolutely delicious. I think any small, mild white fish would work with this, we used Swai from Thailand. The brussel sprouts were perfect with it.

I substituted tilapia for sole and used chopped raw almonds instead of sliced almonds. Loved the light flavours and how simple the dish was to prepare!

Nuked the sprouts instead of steaming. Added Adobo to the flour. Fish-hating hubby had seconds.

This is a quick, simple and really delicious dish! We used asparagus because there were no fresh Brussels sprouts to be found in our local shops, but it worked really nicely with the substitute. We cooked it on the bbq burner for a lovely outdoor summer meal! Will definitely be using this recipe again!

Great simple weeknight meal. The texture of the sprouts was great and the taste and texture contrast of the fish, brussel sprouts, almonds, and lemon butter worked very well. A lot of opportunties to make the process even simpler by baking the fish rather than cooking it in a pan, using a mandolin to slice the sprouts, and steaming the sprouts in a pan rather than in a steamer. Whole meal took 15 min to prepare including prep!

Pretty cool recipe - I have used rockfish and herb seasoning for the fish instead of just salt and pepper. The b. sprouts with almonds and lemon juice. Will do this again.

Very light and uncomplicated, this dish was refreshingly simple. I quadrupled the recipe and so used far less butter, and changed the ratio so that there was more oil (olive oil, so that it's slightly more healthy). I also added some sugar to the almonds when they were browning, which I think made all the difference. It made it more original, and brought out the lemon flavour. I also replaced the brussel sprout with broccli

This was a really light and uncomplicated recipe with a lot of flavor. Since we are trying to lessen gluten in our lives, I used quinoa flakes in place of the flour and also used a dash of wine in place of a T of butter at end. Toasted the pinenuts I had on hand instead of almonds that I did not. Really tasty and quick for a busy weekday!

Will make this again, but I'll use less butter next time: it was a little too rich. I made a double recipe, and the presentation was beautiful, the sole topped with toasted almonds and draped over the sprouts on a white platter.

This was great! I was looking for something fast to do with fish and I pulled this up. 10-15 minutes later we're sitting down to dinner! I love the idea of using a little white wine and skipping the butter at the end - I'll definately be making this again!

I followed this recipe exactly as it said and it was wonderful. The tastes and textures of the almonds, fish and brussell sprout combination was really nice.

Yum! What a great eating alone meal. To make it healthy, I didn't use the 2 T butter at the end--just cooked the almonds with the lemon juice and a dash of white wine. I also just cooked the sliced sprouts in a little water in a pan until the water cooked off, then dried the pan and continued with the recipe. Despite these changes, still fantastic, and super easy and quick. The full fat version would be great for company.
