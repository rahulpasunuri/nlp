My team and I chose this recipe for our culinary competition at school and the judges deemed it "the best thing we tasted all day"!! It's a great recipe!! I tweaked it a bit for maximum flavor! When boiling the water and sugar for the simple syrup, I added lime zest and let it simmer, so the wonderful deep bitter flavor of the lime was present in the sorbet as well as the sweet flavor of the guanabana! I also used Goya brand Guanabana nectar, instead of frozen. We we the only team who earned a perfect 10 on a dish! Definitely a winner!!

Also try coconut milk instead of water for the guanabana sorbet. And a simple lime syrup for those who don't like mango.

This recie is totally delicious. You can find the guanabana pulp at any Latin American market.

Great light summer desert with a little different taste. I've made this twice now. The first time was with ganabana necter and frozen mango chunks from Whole Foods as it was all that I could find. It turned out very tastey, but the sorbet was a little icey. I found the ganabana and mango puree in a market that caters to a latin population. This was also very tastey and the sorbet was richer and smoother. While that taste might not appeal to everyone, we like it. It has a sharp citris taste that's a little different.
