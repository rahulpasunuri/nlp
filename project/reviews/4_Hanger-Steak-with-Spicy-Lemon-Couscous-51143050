Delicious. Made as written, but I upped the red pepper and substituted green onions for the fennel. Quick weeknight meal; will definitely make again.

was dubious about the combo of flavors and there had yet to be a review (i rely heavily on these! thank you people!) but this all worked out brilliantly! used skirt steak and doubled the recipe for leftovers (and the fact we are pigs) and most likely tripled the garlic and red pepper -- otherwise followed recipe completely and it was yummy!
