i cant review as i had to make many changes due to what i had on hand. i did make a very delicious salad based on the recipe but subbed apple juice for orange juice added a tad of lemon as i used slivered apple and lemon juice prevents discoloration. i skipped the reduction and the water but did add the rest of the ingredients in the dressing. i used baby spinach apples candied walnuts and a bit of crumbled bleu cheese. the dressing was sweet sour salty and savory. the salad looked great.i will make it again and also try the original orange dressing too.

The dressing was yummy. We skipped the water (I agree it would be way too thin if included). I did not add any oil and do not see the benefit of doing so in the future. I probably added a little more ginger than called for and used a larger than average shallot. The hot sauce gives it a nice kick.

Agree with the reviewers who skipped the water, reduced the OJ to a syrup, and added a bit of oil. It was still pretty thin as far as a salad dressing goes (more like a fruit dressing). It did taste yummy, but I'm not sure I'll regularly be going to all of the trouble.

Outstanding recipe. Dressing is so zesty, dynamic and full of flavor - perfect with the spinach, jicama and carrot. I added a bit more hot pepper sauce and used 1/3 hot sesame oil and 2/3 regular sesame oil - made it all the more firecracker-y :) Flavor - A- Healthy - A Easy - A- Inexpensive - A Overall - A

Dressing too watery--skip water add a little oil--otherwise it was tasty.

I would personally never use OJ concentrate. The point is a cooked syrup. I had to tinker w/proportions--nearly every ingredient. The only one I omitted was the water as recommended--useless. Needed more sesame oil and added olive oil--just a TBSP for viscosity. I had srirracha sauce and hot oil to up the flavor. It's too much of Cal SPa thing--God forbid they eat any oil...

Whyever are we reducing orange juice when frozen concentrate is available? Waste of time and energy.

Added a touch more honey for some extra sweetness, in addition to a bit of chili oil for more spice. It's a nice, light dressing that's healthier than anything mayonnaise-based and a welcome change from home made Italian or vinaigrette.

Katyat is right, reducing the orange juice to three tablespoons and eliminating the water works. Good easy salad.

First off, I would suggest everyone read Katyat's review and corrections. Reduce the orange juice to a syrup. I used McIlhenny's hot sauce and toasted sesame seeds and pecans for the salad. I didn't use the bacon, but it is an excellent suggestion. The flavor is very nice, both sweet and spicy. The Louisiana hot sauce is a great addition, but any chili paste or other type of hot sauce really works well with this recipe.

This is amazing. First, to solve the thickness issue, really reduce the orange juice. I reduced it to about three syrupy tablespoons. Next, leave out the water--not needed. I also left out the chili, because I wasn't in the mood, and would have used less ginger, since that was actually a bit hot, too. So I made the salad dressing. In Nairobi we can't get baby spinach, but I got nice spinach, which I gave a rough chop. I had some lean back bacon that I cut into lardons, then sauteed crisp in a bit of peanut oil. After the lardons were crisp, I added about 1 T of hot oil to the salad bowl, added the spinach, and tossed. In the hot pan I put segments from two oranges with about 1-2 T sugar to caramelize. I added that to the salad with the dressing, and tossed. We couldn't get enough of this salad!! This is so versatile--add toasted sliced almonds, caramelized pecans, sliced caramelized pears, maybe even gorgonzola if you go pears instead of oranges. For the version I made, I would have added toasted pine nuts, just for the flavor counterpoint. This is a seriously amazing salad. Try it, but do be sure to reduce the OJ to syrup--it will be a beautiful consistency and will coat the leaves. You want amazing concentrated sugary orange juice, so go there. It takes about 15 mins, and if it doesn't work you can always start over, right? Worth it.

Super tasty and easy! I add avocado to it. The recipe makes WAY too much dressing - I'd make 1/2 or less.

I love this recipe because it is delious! I make it every other week but my children would have it every other day if could.

Yes it is thin and runny but incredible. People will lick their plates with this one. I didn't have shallots or ginger but I added two thai chillies in the blender. Added a nice kick.

This recipe sounded delicious but I was really disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly but found the dressing to be really watery. If I were to try it again I think I would add more oil and leave out the water.

Like others here I found the taste interesting but the dressing just sinks to the bottom of the plate.

This recipe isn't Vegan at all!! I subbed the Honey for Agave Nectar.

This dressing is quite flavorful when you sample it with a spoon. But it is so runny that when you put it on the salad almost none of it sticks. so it tastes as if you're eating undressed veggies. The only changes I made were that I omitted the water and used only half the hot pepper sauce. Maybe if you added the xanthan gun powder it would work better, but who keeps xanthan gum powder in their pantry? Though we admit it is probably healthful, my husband and I didn't like this salad at all.

The dressing was absolutely delicious. Only gave 3 stars since I didn't use the salad ingredients shown. I had a lovely salad mix of rocket (arugula), watercress, and baby spinach and needed a dressing that could stand up to those potent flavors---and this was it! Just added some julienned carrots and toasted sesame seeds. Will definitely make again.

I made the salad dressing and put in over my own spinach salad with mandarin oranges, toasted almonds, shallots and orange garlic shrimp. The dressing was thin but really tasty and I plan on making it again. I did omit the water.

I used only the dressing and paired it with a salad consisting of Romaine, grilled chicken, mandarin oranges, roasted almond slices and Chinese noodles. I used an extra 1/3 cup of orange juice, doubled the honey, omitted the water, and halved the hot pepper sauce. It was good. 3 of 4 stars, I'd say (as I made it). There was a slight bit of bitterness to it...perhaps from the orange juice? next time I'd probably use better orange juice and perhaps achieve the reduction via making it from concentrate using less water rather than boiling it down.

We made the dressing only and tossed it with herb salad. We didn't add the water. The dressing was refreshing and light since it wasn't loaded with olive or vegetable oil. It would be a good dressing for any Asian meal. I imagine the extra vegetables would make it even better.

This was not very good. I had to mess with it quite a bit jut so I could serve it. The first recipe ever on epicurious that I really did not enjoy.

I found this recipe just ok. The dressing was very watery and even though I cut the recipe in half there was way more dressing than needed.

Excellent recipe! I topped it with roasted chicken, but I think it would be delicious with grilled shrimp too. I will definitely make this again!

This was great. I used veggies on hand - carrots, red pepper and red onion - added a little goat cheese and a sliced up grilled chicken breast for a light, yummy meal. will make this again

Delicious although I like a more acidic dressing so I added a tablespoon of cider vinegar. As the recipe says, it's great with any combination of leafy greens. If you add cooked chicken or shrimp, it makes a lovely meal

This was very light and refreshing & the dressing was great--really flavorful! I served this as recommended with hoisin shrimp for my husband, and tofu with peanut sauce for me. It made for a great meal--it was filling, but not at all heavy. I will definitely make this again!

Really wonderful salad. Light and refreshing and low-fat. I used mixed Asian greens in lieu of the spinach, but I'll try spinach next time. Delicious!
