We loved the flavor of this recipe. It also is very colorful and brightens up the table. It will be an annual recipe at our Thanksgiving dinner.

rather disappointing. nothing interesting, and no interesting flavor. the results didn't look that appealing either. definitely will find another vegetable dish next year.

My in-laws made this for our Thanksgiving feast and it was terrific! It's a beautiful dish, and the ginger makes it aromatic and interesting. We thought we might next like to try it at room temp with poached salmon...
