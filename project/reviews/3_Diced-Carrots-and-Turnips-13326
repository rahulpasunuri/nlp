I used a "black radish" which can be used just like a turnip. It was quite good; simple; but very fast. It was not outrageous; but good.

I found this recipe to be very bland. I needed to add a sauce or other spices to spice up this dish.

Thanksgiving wouldn't be Thanksgiving without turnips and carrots! My grandmother made a recipe similar to this one and it is always on my Thanksgiving table - and quite often when I serve other poultry. It is yummy - try it!
