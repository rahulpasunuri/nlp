Great recipe. I skip making tortillas by had and used store bought. Flavors were unusual and I almost didnt add the cinnamon and clove because it didn't sound like a good combination. At last minute decided to make recipe as writtin and so glad I did. The combination is fabulous! I've also used it to make tacos and also substituted Chicken for the pork when I had Vegetarian friends over. This is a must make recipe!

This recipe tastes like an infusion of Indian and Mexican cuisine. Very strange combinations going on here. The taste and texture of this pork reminds me of the odd flavored Mexican food offered on the buffet of a cruise ship. I will not prepare this again. In my opinion, it was a waste of ingredients.

I bought sopes dough at the supermarket and punched out 2 inch round circles - they are thicker than tortillas and made a nice bed for the pork. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. I made these as appetizers for a party and they vanished as soon as I put them out. Fantastic!

This didn't taste nearly as savory as I would have preferred and looks nothing like the photo (the filling isn't a uniform red color). I was not impressed.

Skip adding ground cloves and cinnamon you can add canned diced fire roasted tomatoes instead of doing all that extra work. Also it ca be made with chicken.

This was delicious. I served it as a main with rice and sour cream. A couple things -- I added extra adobo sauce, because I love it, and in future I'd add a bit more braising water to the pork, or else cover it for the last 15 minutes to keep it moist. Otherwise, delicious!

I made this and served it on mini-buns (instead of the tacos), at room temp for an outdoor concert and picnic. It was an excellent pairing with our Pinot Noir. The cinnamon in the pork complemented the spice in the Pinot and the wine has the body to stand up to the meat. I had not made anything with pork butt before and was curious. Although I understand that all the fat in the meat adds to flavor and probably helps to pull the pork apart, I cut off at least 1/3 of the total weight of the cut in fat before I cooked it. Next time I might try another cut of pork.

Great recipe! I didn't make the tostadas, just served in corn tortillas like regular tacos. Did the initial cooking of the pork in my favorite kitchen tool, the pressure cooker, and it only took 30 minutes. Used a can of Rotel tomatoes in place of fresh plus a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste. Topped with crumbled queso fresco. You must use the cloves and the chipotle peppers - those are the ingredients that give this dish its distinctive flavor!

I served the pork with round tortilla chips rather than pre-assembled, and with only fresh cilantro leaves on the side for sprinkling on top -- no crema or avocado. My guests raved about it and practically licked the pan clean.

WOW -- spicy and delicious! We used andouille instead of chorizo. Makes a great appetizer on corn chips. Top with small amount of smashed black beans and sour cream.

I made this for a dinner party (and I have had it at Salpicon). It was very good, but VERY spicey. I think I would change a few things - less of the peppers to start. Also I am thinking aout making it in the slow cooker and changing the tomatos - to be less chunky. Overall very good.

Served this last weekend for my housewarming party (quadrupled the recipe) and there were no leftovers. Everyone could not stop raving about how delicious it was. Instead of making the tostaditas, we used Tostitos scoops with a hint of jalepeno and I think that it was the perfect serving vessel as well as being a great slightly spicy compliment to the flavors in the pork. I would absolutel make this again

This dish was exceptional- and I'm not a big fan of pork! I used Old El Paso tostadas, sour cream, and cilantro because I had them on hand, and I would not change a thing next time I make these. My husband had leftovers the next day and made nachos, which were also delicious.

Fantastic. I don't think braise is the correct cooking term, you are really just boiling the meat. Anyway, really good stuff. I added Salsa ranchero, a canned chili sauce (jalepeno, ancho, cebolla, and cascabel chiles in tomato puree.) I also subbed Trader Joes's smoky chipotle salsa for the roasted tomatoes. I used chicken stock too to extend and prevent burning once all the ingredients for the sauce were cooking. Don't believe it detraced from the flavor at all. I tripled the recipe and still only used 1/8 teaspoon of both cinnamon and cloves. I slathered this on some crusty Italian bread and topped with avocado slice and cream fraiche. Outstanding!

Very yummy! I used purchased corn chips and served it like a dip with a spoon in it. I roasted the tomatoes on the grill for about 10 minutes, when I peeled and chopped them I discarded the seeds & juice - should of kept it as I had to add chicken stock in the end once I combined everything. I am not sure about the clove - it was a little over powering and I could taste it the next day...would probably use cloves the next time I make it because it does add a key taste, but would use like 1/8t. I skipped the chipotle chiles as they are too spicy for me, added a little ancho chili powder instead. Since I served it like a dip I did not use the crema or avocado. A good hearty appitizer and a nice change from plain old salsa.
