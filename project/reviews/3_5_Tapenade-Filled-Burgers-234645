A terrific, easy-to-make juicy burger. This is a featured recipe in the 2011 Gourmet Grilling special magazine issue, and this online recipe differs slightly from the mag. I used the mag recipe, and so used full-fat ground beef, and cooked the burgers six minutes per side until the core temperature was 160 F according to an instant read thermometer. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

Loved this! I made it with the Pasta Salad with Cherry Tomatoes & Olivada, also found on this website, and made extra Olivada to use in this recipe. I also stuffed them with some fresh mozzarella, and topped with mayo and roasted red pepper. Excellent!

These were great. Really tasty - the red onions and pickles paired great with the tapenade in the burgers. Very easy, too. Will definitely make again.

I made this for the BF with some homemade tapanade my friend gave me for christmas We really didn't think it tasted good.

These were quite tasty. I had smaller buns (i.e. cheap/supermarket/white), so I didn't want big patties, and made five out of 1lb of grd beef. They were yummy, but the olive tapenade was a little...assertive, maybe? Good, but just too much of it. But I'd make it again, although I'd want an olive spread that was smoother, both for texture and ease of assembly.

Wow. These were REALLY good. Served with melted mozarella cheese as suggested by another viewer. A definite make-again!!!

These burgers were phenomenal!! My husband hates sweet pickles, but he ate 2 burgers and never complained. Will definitely make these again and again!

Exceptional! We love these! They are easy, healthy, and way more flavourable than any other burger we have ever had! We use Extra Lean ground beef, and mix the tapenade through the meat to keep it moist. I find these burgers are even better if they are given an opportunity to marinate. We use a black and green olive paste and eat them on whole grain buns. My husband and I make these ever chance we get!

Not a hamburger lover, I eat maybe 6 a year, nearly always homemade. Tried these, because wanted something quick, had just bought the meat, and happened to have the tapenade and other ingredients on hand. What a pleasant surprise, with its burst of flavors and textures. Paired beautifully with a full-bodied red wine.

We're so lazy here that we just mixed the ingredients together and made the burgers. Otherwise, it became too much work for a buger. It was still delicious and it was more interesting to look at with flecks of tapenade showing.

This is delicious. My favorite variation has the tapenade on top of the burger as the only condiment and a hunk of smoked mozarella inside!

Simple and delicious! I made my own tapenade from another epicurious recipe to make it even better!
