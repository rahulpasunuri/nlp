This was an excellent summer appetizer! I clipped the recipe way back in Oct. 2000 and just now tried it, along with the salt and pepper shrimp w/ blue cheese & celery that it was featured with in the magazine. I followed the recipe as stated though note that cutting raw corn on the cob is a challenge. I used a chef's knife and hit it with a mallet. It didn't seem to matter whether the corn was stored in the juice or not. Served it to 8 people, and was asked for the recipe by 2 of them. Very different and very good!
