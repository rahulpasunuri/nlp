Like other people said, the sauce is really amazing. Loved the flavor combo of this sandwich--will make it again and again. It is good for casual lunches and also for more special occasions.

This is a recipe my husband actually will request time and time again. Definitely, don't waste your time with roasting the peppers, store bought drained on paper towels first is fine. The sauce/mayo is a must. Really great combo of flavors, if you like arugula you'll love these!

This was easy and packed with flavor. I used jarred red peppers to save time. The sandwiches packed well for a picnic.

The sauce was very nice. I used bought roasted chicken and a hearty German-style wholemeal bread made with carrots and pumpkin seeds. Baguette seems a little uninteresting. I think the bread made the difference.

These sandwiches were tasty, but not spectacular.

The sauce really makes the sandwich flavorful.

These were just okay -- we didn't love the recipe. Seemed like there were too many competing flavors, since both the arugula and roasted peppers are bold.

The arugula, roasted red peppers (I used store-bought out of the interest of time) and mayo/yogurt mix work so well together. And this way we don't feel so guilty about the oven-roasted fries. Very, very good.

I have made these numerous times and always get great reviews. Outdoor concert, wedding shower, afternoon picnic - always good.

This was very yummy...my boyfriend is not a mayo or mustard person so I skipped on the mayo for him and used some crumbled feta cheese instead which was delicious!!

This is a great sandwich recipe. I confess that we did cheat and just use regular mayonnaise and bottled roasted peppers. But it was still superb, especially on a freshly baked home made baguette

Awesome recipe. The mayo/yogurt/mustard mixture was a wonderful surprise - very flavorful. The peppers-prep took a bit of work - I've been told that after blackening them, dropping them in ice water (with ice cubes) and peeling them in the water makes it a lot easier. Important to use good bread. Loved it!

Loved this! My husband, who is not a mayo/spread/dip kind of guy loved this concotion and asked for more, so now I make extra. We also prefer it on seeded Italian bread best. -Janet

My grocery store was out of arugula when I made this so I substituted cilantro. It seemed to work just fine, though next time I will use the recipe as printed.

My husband loved this. I agree that you should stick to the recipe as written. It was very flavorful; the roasted red pepper really makes the sandwich.

Certainly very easy to make. I cubed the chicken after cooking and served this as a salad with the sandwich spread as a sauce instead. I garnished the salad with the roasted red peppers. I found it to be lacking in flavor. Perhaps some additional seasonings, maybe garlic and a little more salt and pepper and lemon juice or lemon pepper might liven it up a bit. I will make the suggested sandwich the next time I try this recipe.
