Wow, this cake was a showstopper! I made it for Christmas this year, and everyone absolutely loved it. The flavors of the raspberry, cream cheese, and almond/hazelnuts go together so perfectly. I've already had several requests to make it again!

Have made this cake at least 3 times over the years for special occasions. I decorated as in the original mag photo, and it was gorgeous! Have yet to have a negative review. I suspect eliminating the Chinese 5 spice, or using old spice, may be part of the problem. This ingredient gives the cake its unforgettable flavor.

I think the most amazing part of this cake is the decorating scheme - I followed the instructions, and it turned out to be one of the most beautiful and professional-looking cakes I have ever put together. However, I think the taste of this cake was less memorable - good, but not quite as flavorful as I'd hoped. This cake was time-consuming, but not all that difficult - all the steps went quite smoothly with no problems.

This was, as promised, quite good, a "keeper" in the words of one happy diner. It was not, however, the outstanding dessert that I had expected based on some of the earlier reviews. It was, also as promised, a lot of work though was fun to make (except for the nuts). Definitely really good, just don't expect the seas to part.

This cake is my husband's favorite and I've been making it for 3 years now. It is a lot of work so reserved for only special occassions. A few tips: I toast the nuts at 350 just until slightly browned; the nuts keep cooking long after coming out of the stove so don't wait too long. Make sure to buy a jam with thick consistency or be careful about dripping when it sets. Use an earlier tip to spray the foil with cooking spray when turning the cake out. It really helps to reduce tearing.

This cake is a family favorite. It is very time consuming to make, but absolutely delicious. I highly recommend making the effort - amazing.

i made this cake yesterday for my father´s birthday. everybody liked it, but i wasn´t thrilled with the results. the frosting turned out a little too soft, i whipped it to make it harder but still didn´t get the right consistency. the hazelnut cake was great, i´m totally doing it again but i´m planning on moisten it with some liqueur and frosting it with a chocolate ganache.

This is a great recipe, but it would be even better if it had a photo to go along with it. For those of us who are still semi-amateurs at making desserts look, as well as taste, wonderful, the visual aide helps a lot.

You won't regret making this cake! It's a beautiful presentation and equally delicious.A bit if work but worth it. Agree that it's better the next day.

Awesome cake. Texture and flavors of ingredients blend perfectly (I reduced sugar on frosting and cake a little bit). Not really hard to make, I followed tip on greasing foil on rack. I made this using 2 10x6 1/2 rectangular pan, so I reduced the frosting by 1/3. The white choc on the frosting was very subtle and I might increase it a bit to suit my taste. Guests were so impressed they requested to bring home the few leftover pieces. Hats off on this one!

This is an awesome cake. The flavors, the texture - cannot be compared! It's even better the next day when the layers have had time to mesh together. Definately a show stopper!!

This cake reminds me of cakes purchased at a patisserie. It's so lovely to look at and tastes as if made by a professional baker. It is tedious to put together and the cake stuck to the aluminum foil on the cooling rack so I would use non-stick spray before cooling it on the foil. Eating it was worth all the hard work it took to make it.

The hardest part of this recipe is assembly, hands down. I think assembling took me almost as long as the rest of the process. However, it was well worth it. I served it at a friend's birthday, and it was a hit with everybody. I can't really think of any suggestions other than follow the recipe exactly and you can't lose. I did not make any changes.

Although assembly is a bit difficult and I'll do a better job next time, this cake is a show-stopper, and a great change from the typical chocolate cake. Next time I'd use a bit more preserves on the 2 inner layers, as the layer above tends to absorb the raspberry, and this taste really sets off the rest of the cake. This cake was definitely better the 2nd day!

Absolutely stunning and delicious; my guest could have sworn that I purchased the cake from a bakery.

This was the most spectacular dessert I have ever made. It was a bit time-consuming and tough getting it to look as good as the cover photo, but well worth the effort. The cake was incredibly moist and the raspberry and chocolate blend was perfect! I would most definitely make this dessert in the future. Very impressive.

This was a fantastic cake. Unfortunately, I didn't cook the cake long enough and when I tried to take it out of the pan it broke in many pieces. I thought my precious cake was ruined, but I managed to save it by putting the broken pieces back into the pan, cooking it again for awhile and then putting the cake together like a jigsaw puzzle, one layer on top of the other, as directed. Luckily, after doing this and covering the cake with the frosting it looked quite splendid and I can tell you it tasted heavenly! Even after my mishap I would make this again, but next time I will be sure to cook the cake long enough!

This cake was absolutely delicious and looked beautiful, but it took me quite a while to make it. I found it a little complicated and time-consuming, but well worth it - everyone loved it! A great recipe, but just leave yourself enough time.

Very pretty, very tasty, lots of oohs and aahs and pretty easy. I made three of these in 7 days and I learned: -hazelnuts will turn into nut butter if over ground -don't over toast the hazelnuts because they get oily and the flavor over shadows the cake -I found that before transfering the cake to the cooling rack if I shook it up and down gently for several minutes to loosen the cake that it didn't rip or crumble -I put a thin layer of oil on the foil so it didn't stick as bad. Yum!

This is a truly fantastic cake. I've made it for two Christmases, and will be making it again this year. It looks gorgeous and tastes splendid. If you want people to ooh and aah at dessert time, this is the one to make. I really recommend against substitutions for the five spice powder. You want that star anise flavor that the suggested substitutions are lacking.

I've made this cake a couple of times. While it's not a difficult cake to make, it's delicious and very impressive looking.

I really enjoyed the update to the tart, which I find sticky. Any dessert that includes 5-spice powder deserves a second look. I used lingenberry preserves for a Swedish Christmas dinner.

This cake has become a Christmas tradition. I have made it every year since 1996. Also, my family and friends have requested it for special occassions through out the years. It is one of my favorite cakes to bake. It will be enjoyed for years to come.

This sounds like a pretty good cake. It's a mistake however, to call it "Viennese!" Linz, Austria is not Vienna. Linzer is something, or someone, from Linz (like the classic Linzertort). Viennese is something or someone from Vienna. Linz is near the Bavarian border - not even next to Vienna which is near the Slovak border. So, which is it, is this a "Linzer Cake," or a "Viennese Cake?"

Good cake, looks real pretty. Only one complaint.. when you turn the cake on to the foil lined rack, how do you keep the cake from sticking to the foil? I had a difficult time getting the cake off the foil. Middle layer was the toughest, and it tore nearly in pieces. Probably something I did,but we enjoyed it after our Christmas dinner. Nice textures and flavors.

This cake is so excellent, I used it for my wedding cake! Since my family is not big on cream cheese, we used white chocolate buttercream instead, and it was fabulous!!! Even the most resistant dessert eaters can't resist this!

We loved this cake, which I served after dinner on Christmas day. The guests all seemed to enjoy it, and it looked very pretty. I cut it into thirds length-wise, rather than width-wise, and then stacked the cake, so that it was only about 3&1/2" wide. This way it was a nicer size for cutting and serving. A thin slice of about 1/2" was plenty rich for everyone. I will definitely make this again!

INCREDIBLE! This cake is top quality. My gusets told me to quit my job and go into the baking business. This cake tastes great and with relatively little effort looks awesome. Every step was perfect, all measured out just so. Follow those directions and you can't go wrong.

Great recipe! I didn't have 5 spice powder in the house and substituted Penzey's cake spice plus 1/2 tsps ginger, clove and cardamom. Tasted wonderful and looked gorgeous, too. I could only fit about 1/3 the nuts on the slides...

I began baking this cake 3 years ago, and through little effort of my own--the cake is perfect just as it is written in the recipe--I have gained a reputation as the awesome cake lady. It has been the star at 2 different cake parties!

So tasty and beautiful, it started rumors about me at the office. Am i secretly in love with my boss and trying to impress him? I did not bother toasting or peeling hazlenuts and it came out fine. Five-spice powder is WELL worth the investment, especially when you use it to make amazing five-spice pecans (recipe available on this site!) I agree with other reviewer that you must follow directions to the letter, but if you do: the cake is actually simple to prepare.

This is my favorite Bon Appetit recipe of all time! It is stunning--a spectacular dessert! I have prepared this cake again and again, and it has established my baking reputation among family and friends. The Chinese 5-spice was a little too avant-garde for me, so I substituted 1t cinnamon plus 1/4 t ginger. The frosting recipe given here is an absolute dream, and it complements many cakes. I used it to frost an apple cake just this past weekend, with delightful results. Be sure to try this Viennese Linzertorte cake at least once. If you rise to the challenge, it will become your signiture dessert.
