Be careful not to overbake this. I used 1 tsp of extracts, half vanilla and half almond. I liked the crunchiness of the almonds and cornmeal. Definitely serve it with the fruit compote or it will be a bit too plain.

I liked the flavor of the cake with the peaches, but would add some almond extract to enhance that aspect of the cake. Otherwise it was a great spring treat! Not too heavy either.

Delish! Got rave reviews from the nonprofit group that received this donated dessert. I used 1/4 C brown sugar when grinding nuts, and since I only had walnuts... Still used vanilla and almond extracts. My bake time was 50 minutes. I used frozen peaches and mixed berries, skipped the wine and added only enough brown sugar to liven up the frozen peaches.

A friend of mine made this for my birthday. It was by far the VERY best cake I've had. I wanted to eat the whole thing! I will definitely make this myself.

Only note to add -- while the cake is nice warm, it is much better the next day. Wrap well after cooling. Must be because the flavors meld. Def agree -- add some almond extract in place of some of the vanilla and watch carefully while baking -- I needed 45 mins in my convection oven.

This is great! I used whole unblanched almonds, since that's what I had, and ground them slightly coarse, since my cornmeal was fine. Super easy to make, and really nice flavor. I didn't do the fruit, but served with sweetened whipped cream mixed with orange zest and sour cream. I could see tweaking this, either more refined (almond meal, fine cornmeal), or rustic, as I did it. Definitely will be a repeat here.

I baked this one evening a few years ago while staying with relatives. Their adult kids came home after the rest of us had gone to bed and scoured the kitchen looking for the source of the incredible aroma. Fortunately I'd brought it into our bedroom to keep it away from their dog, or the kids would have scarfed it for sure. This is really good, much better than you'd imagine from the simple ingredients. My variation of the fruit compote included meltingly ripe peaches, uncooked. I can't remember if I used the wine or not, but I may when I make this tomorrow for company. I think I'll top it with whipped cream, too, just to gild the lily.

I thought this was pretty good, but my husband and guests were crazy for it. I liked the flavor and texture and it was certainly easy. I wasn't crazy about the compote. I think I'd be willing to make again, but would look for an alternative to put on top--I think the fruit alone would work (without the wine).

I've made a lot of cornbreads, but this one is absolutely delicious! Especially if you like almond paste, etc. Thanks to previous comments, I used half vanilla/half almond extract to enhance the almond flavor. Also, I coarsely ground some of the almonds to give a good nexture and a nutty consistency. Lastly, I decreased the sugar by about one-third and the cake was plenty sweet. This is delicious just with fresh berries and whipped cream!

This cake is outstanding. It is the best cornmeal cake I have ever made and I have made lots of them. The cake is moist, rich and flavorful. It keeps very well. I triple the recipe and make it in a fluted bundt pan.

A big hit at the first family picnic of the Spring. Both adults and kids absolutely loved it! No peaches yet, so I just topped it with blackberries, strawberries and whipped cream. Delicious. I don't like very sweet desserts, so I might even cut the sugar a bit next time. It wasn't overly sweet, but you might want it even less so.

The cornmeal cake is wonderful! I just served it with fresh berries instead of the compote.

Soo good and you can freeze it for later use. My aunt uses this recipe at her B&B

Delicious! I made strawberry and blackberry compote, with hazelnut flavored whipped cream. It was a big hit.

Simple and sophisticated. I have made this at least 3 times for a late summer dessert, to rave reviews! The only thing I must recommend is to substitute half of the vanilla with almond extract. For the compote, last time I used some Leibfraumilch instead of Muscat and it was still great. And I've only needed 1 cup each of the berries to serve 6 or more. Wonderful!

I found this cake to be rich and dense, but not too heavy. I loved the flavour, especially with the compote. I agree, however, with comments that the baking time should be reduced slightly (to 45 minutes with my oven). I also had some sticking, so would line the bottom of the pan completely with parchment paper. I found this cake kept well in the fridge.

After reading the rave reviews, I was eager to try this recipe. Unfortunately, I found it to be o.k., but certainly nothing special. In taste and texture, the cake amounts to a dense, sweet cornbread. The almond flavor just doesn't come through. Thank goodness for the compote. It saved the dessert!

I BROUGHT THIS TO MY SIS-IN-LAW'S WHEN INVITED TO DINNER. WE ALL LOVED IT. AND I HAD TO DIRECT HER TO THIS SITE TO GET THE RECIPE. AS SO MANY OF US DO, I DID HAVE TO SUBSTITUTE,, FOR THE COMPOTE I USED BLUEBERRY PORT IN PLACE OF THE ALCO-BEV SUGGESTED.

this is lighter than one would think but I used relatively coarse cornmeal and it was a bit crunchy - a good flavor and if you keep it wrapped up it stays tasty and moist - very good w/berries - I warmed up frozen ones in the winter and then served w/ice cream too

This cake is rich, dense and delicious. The mixture of flavors of almonds and cornmeal is quite unusual and interesting. I substituted parchment paper for the wax paper, and baked in a glass loaf pan; I had no trouble unmoulding at all.

A superb, sophisticated summer dessert. The muscat lends a subtle and unusual sweetness, especially to the peaches. I recommend three minor changes: drape pan both directions with waxed paper to guarantee cake doesn't stick, bake for 5 minutes less, and top with a dollop of whipped cream. Wow! Many thanks to Gourmet for this one!
