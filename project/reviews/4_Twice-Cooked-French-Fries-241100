So glad I found this recipe! I love french fries, but rarely eat them. This was definitely worth the splurge. They turned out beautifully. I used 1/2 canola and 1/2 safflower oil. Finished with herbed sea salt.

We were going to try the twice fried method until I found this recipe. It's easy and resulted in crispy, tasty fries! I boiled the cut fries ahead of time and left them sitting until we were ready to throw them in the fryer. Now I won't bother with the twice fried method. This is the way to go!

These fries turned out fantastic, and so simple. I have tried making the twice fried version, which for some reason seemed messier and more time consuming. I think the par boiled method was easy and turned out way better than the twice fried method. Delicious!

This is easier than double frying, and produces great results. I find that there is a difference when you boil the potato strips 4 vs 5 min. The longer you boil them, the more crisp they fry up, but with one caveat: they tend to break apart when you skim them out of the water. So timing and experimentation here is key.

Excellent flavor and texture! Better than recipes requiring double frying.

This is a really easy and fast way to make great homemade fries. French fries are one of my favorite foods in the entire world, and I loved 'em. Yeah, I suppose I've had better, but definitely nothing better from my own kitchen!

i am about to try this recipe, which looks terrific. i am writing only to object to the rudeness shown by some of the reviewers. if you don't like something, don't make it. if you have an alternative, suggest it. i would hate to jump to the conclusion that belgians are nasty, ill-mannered toads, but that is what it looks like here.

I've made french fries before, but usually doing the 'twice' fried method. What a difference this technique makes! It's so much easier to boil the potatoes a bit first to soften them, then give them a final crisping in the oil. They were soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. My family devoured these!

Delicious! Added minced garlic, rosemary and sea salt to the hot fries just as they were removed from the oil. Easy and wonderful.

Easy to make and gobbled up by all - including the healthy eater member of the family. Use a lot of paper towels to absorb water then excess oil. Used Kosher salt and it was just right.

Although we added an extra minute to the cook time, we made this exactly as directed and they are fabulous!! Dashed with a bit of sea salt and some regular table salt just to be sure and these babies were scrumptious! Thanks...we will try sweet potato this way next time.

Great fries. I used a deep fryer set at 365 degrees, then dusted them with truffle salt. My guests could not keep their hands off them.

This recipe is a decadent treat. I trotted out my deep fryer for Super Bowl Sunday and these were gobbled up to rave reviews. Well worth the extra steps. The Bistro like results make it worth the artery clogging endeavour!

I have made this recipe twice now, and it is the least fussy one I have found for producing perfect fries - no soaking in ice water, no double- frying, even if you do have to boil the fries first. It has become my new standard for french fries.
