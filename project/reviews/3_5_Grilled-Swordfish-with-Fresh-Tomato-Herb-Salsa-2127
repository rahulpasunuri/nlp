Had no marjoram, so I substituted a slightly lesser amount of fresh oregano and added some chili flakes. Served the salsa over swordfish that I grilled on an oak plank. It was sublime.

This recipe is very simple and easy to do and the flavors are just lovely! The salsa with the tomatoes and basil is just so refreshing. I will definitely be making this again!

Made this dish with some changes in the salsa. I used a can of diced tomatoes and used four cubes of frozen basil as I didn't have fresh. Also substituted dried marjoram, about 1/2 tsp. I simmered the salsa to reduce the liquid somewhat, approx. 15 minutes and served it warm with the fish. It was great this way and I plan to use it with shrimp. Will also double the ingredients and use as a side dish.

Good solid recipe for summer grilling. I served the swordfish over steamed spinach and then topped it off with the salsa. I was out of marjoram, but went out on a limb with a small amount of mint---worked well. I also decided to take a tip from another recipe and marinated the swordfish in olive oil, lemon zest, lemon juice and chopped mint, for about an hour.

I made this recipe last night using fresh halibut rather than the swordfish. I also used diced canned tomatoes as suggested by another reviewer. My 16 year-old daughter thought this was the best salsa I have ever made and my husband also loved it. I think the trick is using fresh basil and fresh marjoram. This recipe will become a regular in our house!!

Reminded us a lot of the "Swordfish with Balsamic Brown Butter Sauce" recipe also found on this website (but this dish is more work).

Perfect for a summer evening. We've served this several times and everybody raves. I love the marjoram -- it adds a unique fragrance to the salsa. And the fact that it is so quick and easy to make -- and that you can make the salsa ahead of time -- means more time with your guests. We've also found that leftover salsa is delicious the next morning in an omelet.

Quick and easy--and you can save more time by using a can of diced tomatoes, drained, instea of cooking, chopping plum tomatoes. Definitely a keeper.

Nice light meal with clean,refreshing flavors.Served this with lemon couscous. I chose to grill the swordfish. Great summer recipe!

The fresh marjoram in the tomato salsa was too strong and too floral for my taste - perhaps this works better with dry, as Rick Levy suggested. Otherwise the dish was excellent.

This dish is wonderful and has the added benefit of being healthy. The salsa is a great accompaniment to the swordfish.

This is a wonderful recipe. The combination was just right. I followed the recipe to the tee but I did marinated the Swordfish in fresh lemon juice as Janice from Teaneck, NJ suggested. It was a hit.

I thought this was very good and I thought the salsa was just right with the swordfish. On it's own it was overpowering, but with the swordfish it was fine. I wish I had fresh marjoram, next time I'll try it with the fresh, it will be even better! This was great for a week-night dinner, but I wouldn't serve it to company. Something different for a change.

Appealing combination of flavors. I made the following changes: FOR SALSA: Omitted the balsamic vinegar, added dash of salt, used cherry tomatoes, removed seeds, but did not blanch or remove skin. MARINATED SWORDFISH in fresh lemon juice for 20 min. before broiling, then wiped dry with paper towels before applying oil. During last minute of broiling, piled the salsa on top of the swordfish pieces. I think the amount of balsamic vinegar in the recipe would have been too much.

This was outstanding and easy. Did not have fresh marjoram so substituted dry. Salsa had rich fresh flavor that worked well with the swordfish.

Made this for friends I was visiting on Martha's Vineyard this past weekend as they had fresh harpooned swordfish; this was the perfect "topper". Looking forward to making this simple and delicious dish again! KIMBER

I made this dish and converted my husband who previously did not like swordfish!

I broiled the swordfish and added cilantro to the tomato-herb salsa. It was very tasty! I'd make it again.

I'm not the best when it comes to a grill, so I changed the cooking method to one that works for me. I make a mix of basil, oregano, fresh cracked black peeper, olive oil and balsamic vinegar and toss in tomato that has been peeled, seeded and chopped along with sliced black olives. I put the swordfish on a sheet of foil, top with the mixture, bake on a cookie sheet in a preheated 450 degree oven for 12 minutes. Serve atop your favoritd pasta and use the juices to moisten. And don't forget to heat some crusty bread to go with this!
