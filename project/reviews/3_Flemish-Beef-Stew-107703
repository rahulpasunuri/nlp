Simple and tasty! Added more garlic, since we're garlic lovers, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Very flavorful; more so than I expected given the rather short preparation time. Ny Belgian dad would be proud!

Made this with Saison Supont -- a traditional Belgian farmhouse beer. Excellent flavours and we thoroughly enjoyed and will definitely make again.

The prep time is longer than you may suspect at first from reading the recipie, and I'm not so sure I want to stew a beef tenderloin (I can find many other good uses for it), but the results are very enjoyable and distinctly different from the more commonly known Irish, English, and American beef stews. Definetly worth a try. If you substitute a lesser cut of meat; either take a tenderizer to it first (the relatively short cook time doesn't tenderize the meat much) or make sure you try it again the next day. I personally found I enjoyed the leftovers more than the original meal.

I substituted red wine for the beer and used olive oil instead of bacon. My family & I loved the results and we will make this regularly.

I have made this twice now and both times it was absolutely delicious. I do recommend a good imported dark beer (I chose one from Belgium). Also, the first time I made it with tenderloin and the second with regular stew meat. I recommend the tenderloin the meat is so flavorful itself. It's expensive but worth it.

Not good enough for the expensive cut of meat.

My husband and I have made this twice now (with a lot of leftovers!) This is great on a cold wintery night. I liked the noodles, he didn't.

Followed suggestion of previous reviewers, and used dark beer. Also used molasses instead of brown sugar to add to the richness. I confess, I had no bacon, and used butter instead. Still very good. The noodles were an excellent accompaniment. We put the stew right on top.

This dish is often made in the area where I live in the southern part of the Netherlands (bordering on Flanders). What this dish traditionally needs is dark beer, preferably with a high percentage of alcohol (at least 7%) to give it some sweetness and body. If you use lager or ale you could add a bit of sugar to achieve the same effect. Apart from that, a nice recipe. Oh, and best wishes to skinny Joe.

This was okay, but I wouldn't make it again. The broth was a little too sweet, and although it cooks in a relatively short time, the prep work was more time consuming than I realized. And for the comment from Joe I guess he never heard of left-overs.

I liked this recipe. I think using a good beer with a strong, but not too bitter flavor is important. It is also imperative to use excellent quality beef, and when browning, to barely brown, so as not to overcook. It was great with noodles
