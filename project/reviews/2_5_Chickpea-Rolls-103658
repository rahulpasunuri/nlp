Very good. I already made it several times for buffets...gone in no time. I agree that following the amounts religiously as stated in the recipe doesn't lead to the right consistency, but knowing that the mix should be like stiff mashed potatos there should be no problem with adjusting it. I serve it with the sauce made of cucumber, avocado and yoghurt (+salt, pepper, oregano). Yum! I usually make the mix a day ahead and just fry it the day I serve it.

This was a completely abhorring recipe! The amounts must have been off. Either way, this was not a pleasing recipe!

Disgusting. The amount of cornstarch seemed wrong to me, but the rest of the recipe sounded so good I tried it anyway. It was gummy and tasted only of cornstarch. Blech.

The proportions of ingredients seemed off to me. The puree came out like very thin mashed potatos rather than thick, and I had to add at least another cup of chickpeas. Even then, the rolls turned out runny inside. Tasty, but I would use significantly less cooking liquid in the puree next time.
