This is a must have at every Thanksgiving for our family. We always have to make enough for 'doggie-bags".

Try this! The slight pickle taste makes this completely different from any other cranberry dish I've made or eaten. But keep in mind that the pickle taste may deter people from eating very much at any one time. In other words, they may eat a much smaller amount than they would if this were a traditional, sweet, cranberry dish, such as canned cranberry relish.

I was looking for something different for the cranberries this year and wow did I get it. Only my 7-year-old daughter liked them. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Maybe my vinegar was especially strong or maybe it was just not what I expected. I couldn't taste the cranberries at all--only the syrup. Luckily the gingered cranberry and kumquat relish from the same issue saved the day.

I made this for Thanksgiving and received compliments from the adults. No comments from the teenagers. It is different than most cranberry relishes and I enjoyed the "pickled" flavor which I think goes better with turkey and the rest of a traditional Thanksgiving meal than the usual sweet cranberry sauce.
