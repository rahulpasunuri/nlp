These are fantastic cookies! My only changes were adding a splash of vanilla, a sprinkle of cinnamon, reducing the cookie size and baking at 350 for 8 minutes. Everyone raved and I didn't even bother using fancy pants ingredients(just regular old Hershey's dutch process and tart dried cherries left over from my husband's Costco obsession). I really didn't notice them being overly sweet.

These sound amazing! I usually make these http://badtadmd.com/?p=303 because they're chewy and loaded and so delicious, but I love the idea of using sour cherries and pecans!! Thank you for sharing!

These were not bad. I thought they were too sweet and I already cut back the sugar in the first go round. My young daughter thought they were too sweet as well. I'll cut back to 1c. of sugar if I make these again. I replaced 1/4c of the flour with barley flour and next time I'll used bittersweet chocolate chunks. We like a deep chocolate flavor.

This is a nice, rich cookie - a grownup's chocolate chip cookie!

I found this recipe disappointing since the reviews were so great. They tasted like a boring brownie in the shape of a cookie and were not distinguished from anything that you can buy commercially. I followed the recipe exactly. Check out the Boston Globe from Thanksgiving 2009 for "Brunsli" - a flourless chocolate cherry almond cookie. I love them with chopped cherries added.

Just baked a batch of these EXCELLENT cookies and I have to admit, its one of best cookie recipes Ive ever tried. They just need a slightly lower temperature and 1-2 minutes more. Also, I had no pecans and I used almonts with very good results. I left them for around 10 minutes in the oven followed by few seconds in the food processor. Highly recommended recipe.

Yum. These are so tasty, and they couldn't be easier to throw together. I did them with Lindt dark chocolate and really liked how rich they were. I'll definitely keep these in the rotation.

These were ok. The flavour was good, but they were sort of chewy and sort of cake like. My husband took them to work and people definitely liked them, but thought they were halfway between a cookie and a mini muffin. I followed the recipe and saw the advise about the oven temp. I have a fan forced oven and always have to play around with that anyway.

I am in the minority of reviewers -- I think these are just OK. I used high quality cocoa and still came out with cookies that seemed chalky in texture. I have a much better recipe for this combo of ingredients -- I would not bother.

I agree with others about lowering the oven temp to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and watching the baking time--otherwise a great recipe. For home bakers who don't have a Trader Joe's or Whole Foods in their neighborhoods and who are willing to pay shipping charges, you can find excellent quality dried sour cherries (and other dried fruit and nuts) at www.nutsonline.com.

I don't get all the fuss. These were pretty good, but they weren't exceptional. Even though I used good quality ingredients, the taste was flat ... the dough was better than the cookies. They're not bad, but they're expensive ... there are lots of cookies that will give you more bang for the buck.

I have made these several times for parties and there are NEVER any left. I got one date invitation and always get rave compliments. I use all dark chocolate though, rather than the milk chunks. This is a magic recipe -- the nuts, sour cherries and CHOCOLATE are all so craveable in combination. And the texture of the cookie is sensual. You won't regret making them, though the ingredients are a little pricey.

Have a question for those who have made these... Does anyone know if they store well? Thinking of adding them to my Christmas cookie list. Thanks

Just made them and they are GOOD!!!! I'm not really a baker but this recipe was really easy but looks and taste like a lot of work! I would make these cookies again.

These are absolutely delicious. I used Ghirardelli milk chocolate chips (the big ones), and chopped 2/3 of the cherries as another reviewer suggested. I also did one spoonful of batter for each cookie instead of two. They are plenty big that way. You have to be careful taking them off the cookie sheet as they are a little bit fragile until they cool. Definitely going to make these again.

Really wonderful cookies! I made them exactly as written and were eaten so quickly by family that I had to make them again. Second time I soaked the cherries in cherry brandy first, used a bit of maraschino cherry juice with vanilla, used white and milk choc chips, and left out nuts. Really wonderful too! Very adaptable and delicious recipe. Had to decrease cooking time in my oven to 9-10 min.

Excellent cookies -- I swapped semi-sweet chocolate chunks for the milk chocolate, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. To increase the batch, I used a medium cookie scoop and baked the cookies for roughly 11 minutes. Worked out great - a little crispy, a little chewy, so for me, the perfect cookie!

These are excellent, big & chewy with sophisticated flavors. I didn't have milk chocolate so used something darker and I don't recommend it; I can tell they would have been better with the called-for milk choc instead (they were still eaten though!)

Wow - exceptional cookies. I took these in to work when it was my turn for "treat day" & everyone raved. One colleague said they tasted like Black Forest Cake.

The best chocolate cookie I've ever had! This cookie recipe is my new favorite. Beautiful flavors and texture. I use semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate and I add a little more cherries than the recipe calls for. I am making them way too often now!

These are the best cookies I have ever had! Chewy, not too sweet, lots of texture and flavor. Delicious! I used walnuts instead of pecans and they were still marvelous.

These are so yummy and easy to make using the recipe. I tried it once with cherries, and a second time with dried cranberries. I think it tastes great both ways, but sour cherries give it a more tart taste.

I followed the recipe as it is here, just chopped about 2/3 of the dried cherries to spread them out a little more. They are not as sweet as, say, your average Chocolate Chip cookie, are satisfyingly chewy and were enjoyed by all. Will make them again.

I LOVE these cookies! They are so chewy and chocolaty, the chocolate chunks are wonderful and you get the tart surprise of the cherries. I have made these cookies twice in the last month, and I have a feeling they will become a Daisy-family staple!

This has become my favorite cookie recipe. I use the tart dried cherries from Trader Joe's, and semi-sweet chocolate chips as milk are too sweet for me. I often add a dash of cinnamon. I have made these for house guests, office parties, christmas gifts, etc, and everyone ALWAYS loves them. I actually prefer the cookie dough before baking, mmm.

I don't know what I did wrong, but the cookies came out very flat and broke apart easily. The only substitution I made was 1 cup of white sugar instead of brown since that's what I had on hand. The dough was delicious and the flavor of the cookies are nice, but they need more flour or baking soda or something.

This is a great cookie recipe!!! I made them as directed and they were delicious. I am toying with the idea of making Cherry Garcia ice cream sandwiches but maybe too rich....

These cookies turned out great. I changed the recipe a bit. I was out of cocoa, so I melted 3/4 cup milk chocolate chips and cut down the sugar to one cup. I also did not use brown sugar, but unrefined sugar. I did not add nuts, but did add chopped up white chocolate. They were thinner than I was expecting, but were crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside with little cherry surprises!

I used walnuts instead of pecans, a mix of semisweet and milk chocolate and kosher salt. Seems like you can't go wrong no matter what you add. I don't even like chocolate all that much, and I had to use all my willpower to keep from eating a second.

These cookies are wonderful. I have been eating them compulsively since yesterday, and I think that they are even better on the second day! I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I lined the baking sheets with parchment paper and had to shorten the cooking time slightly (which probably has more to do with my oven than with the recipe.)

Awesome cookies! I'm making these for Christmas, but I hope they'll last.

These cookies are awesome!!! Used a mix of milk and semisweet chocolate and Trader Joes dried tat cherries and skipped the nouts. Very intense. Very decadent. The recipe calls for two tablespoons of dough per cookie which results in rather large cookies. As it is Christmas time, on my second batch I will make them smaller and cut the baking time.

Made these cookies for some very discerning chocolate fanatics to rave reviews. The recipe is right - use the best cocoa powder you can find and bake for precisely 15 minutes. The texture is amazing and they were actually even better the next day. And since I am not a believer of nuts in cookies I substituted with a mix of high-quality milk, bittersweet and white chocolate chunks. Each cookie received an extra- large white chocolate chunk in the ceter and the cheeries gave a unique 'tang' to the total flavor. A new favorite!

Scharfenberger cocoa, Ghiardeli semi-sweet chips (double the amount), made small scoops of dough, froze, baked at 350. amazing.

I made these for a party two weeks ago and they received rave reviews. Made them again today for another party. Few quick notes: the quality of the cocoa powder and chocolate makes a big difference here! Used Scharffen Berger cocoa powder in both batches. Used Green & Black chocolate in the first batch but it didn't quite do it. Used Scharffen Berger this time and LOVED it. Doubled the amount of chocolate this time, using one 3oz bar of semi-sweet (62%) and one 3oz bar of rich milk (41%). Now they're triple chocolate and they're delicious! So easy and so quick to make. Definitely my go-to cookie recipe from now on.

Made smaller cookies--about half the size--and baked them at 350 for 13 minutes. Deeply chocolate--as chocolaty as Oreos but much better, of course--and delicious. I used toasted walnuts, because I prefer them generally to pecans, and semisweet chips. Also used salted butter and skipped the salt because I use organic butter and unsalted organic butter is almost impossible to find here.

Very easy to make and oh-so-delicious. The dried sour cherries really make this cookie a winner. Whole Foods carries dried cherries in their bulk section.

My friends loved the mixture of cherry and chocolate. I agree about temp and cooking time. These cookies (especially with nuts added) can taste too dry if left in for too long.

These cookies are wonderful and quite different to most cookies I've tasted. The chocolate falvor is very rich and deep, but do not mask the other ingredients. The sour cherries (without sugar coating) and pecans compliment the taste, providing relief against a rich chocolatey background.

i also had to lower the cooking temp, but they came out great. the dough can handle whatever you want to throw in there. i have put white, dark, and milk chocolate all in the same batch. use a lot of cherries. they are the best part.

"Trader Joe's" market usually carries dried tart cherries. We always buy several packages and keep them on hand for cookies and granola.

These are awesome!!! I just used dried cherries because I could not find sour cherries either. I also used macadamia nuts instead of pecans. Used a Lindt milk chocolate bar. Seriously, awesome! And it's true - the cookie dough is a great starting point. You could probably put whatever additions you want in it.

these were exceptional. i left the pecans whole which gave them a great crunch. i only needed to cook them for 10 minutes total too.

This is sooooooo YUMMY! But my family didn't have any sour cherries on hand so instead we substituted the candy bar Heath bar crunch and it was delicious! We also omitted nuts in half the recipie, which I personally think, tastes better without nuts. Otherwise, this recipie is simple and classic. You will enjoy it. It comes out crispy and just perfect even the day after its baked. Enjoy!

Ingredients fine. Heads up: this cooking time too long at 375. Lower heat or shorten time. I chilled dough, used a cookie scoop and baked on parchment-lined sheets. Yummy!
