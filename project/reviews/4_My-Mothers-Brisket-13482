I read a lot of the reviews, and ended up making the following modifications: used 1/2 merlot and 1/2 beef broth; reduced the temperature to 350 degrees; cooked it fully covered for 5 hours on a Thursday night; refrigerated it, and then defatted it and sliced it on a Friday, and cooked it an additional hour before serving on a Saturday. It was tender and delicious, and everyone raved, but frankly, I thought it was bland. I am not certain that I would make this recipe again.

Absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again.

This was fantastic!! I used a combination of marsala cooking wine and beef broth (the kind in the cardboard carton) instead of the water. And the thing that pushed this over the edge was the spice rub. Instead of just salt and pepper, I used sea salt and Trader Joe's 21 spice seasoning salute. Everyone loved it!

I've been making this brisket for years now, and it's always a Hanukkah hit. It's perfectly fine as is, but it's even better with red wine in place of some of the water, and a bit of tomato paste for richness.

I love this recipe. It's very easy and tastes amazing. I took the advice of other reviewers and used half Merlot and Half Beef Stock to replace the water and added a package of Onion Soup Mix. I also added shallots to the onion mixture. I feel the cooking time was far too long. Next time I am going to cook for between 2 1/2 and 3 hours. This paired wonderfully with Mushroom Risotto.

All I can say is "divine!" As other reviewers suggested, I replaced the water with red wine and beef broth. I also seared the meat on all sides before the initial roasting. A solid four forks!

This is one recipe that is perfect just the way it is published. My aunt used to make this amazing tasting brisket every Passover, and as an adult I wanted to re-create it. This recipe did, and I've used it to bring to neighbors and for my own family. It's all in the gravy.

I made this for our Passover Seder and it was incredibly good. I went with the wine/beef broth mix but used one broth cube and then wound up adding more water and the rest of the bottle of wine to cover the brisket which I had to cut in half to fit into the dutch oven I used. We threw some mushrooms from the farmers market on top (because we love them) when we warmed it up and everyone, even my picky sister and crochety grandma loved it. When I do it again, I'll add more of the cooking liquid to the warming pan, the "gravy" was a big hit!

I made this for a dinner party along with the Roast Chiken with Grapes and Shallots from this site. Both were hits! I also replaced the water with 1 part wine (cab) and 1part beef broth. I sauteed the onions for about 25 minutes until golden and caramelized. Put them on top of the brisket and cooked for 3 hrs. I basted each hour. I removed the excess fat from the brisket then refrigerated it and sliced while cold. Much easier than when it's hot. I then blended the onion sauce and added some dried onion flakes and reheated it all at 350 for 30 mim. It was tender and yummy!

I made it twice - exactly as given, except I used a slow cooker and so reduced the amount of water. I love brisket but this one did not have enough flavor. I should have listened to some of the reviewers and added wine and beef broth instead of water.

Rating: 4
Outstanding recipe. As with other reviewers, I also substituted 1 part beef broth and 1 part red wine (Merlot) for the 3 cups of water. I basted twice in the first hour, and once per hour after that. Basting the juices over the meat made the meat very flavorful. Made and served it same day, but chilled it for a few hours. My first brisket, but not my last.

Rating: 4
This is my go-to Passover brisket, and one of the few recipes I never tinker with. Depending on how smoothly the seder runs, I sometimes end up reheating it for a lot longer than the recipe calls for, but it always turns out wonderful. This is pretty much bullet-proof, so long as you don't burn the onions.

Rating: 4
Instead of three cups of water use beef broth and red wine - I also add 1 packet of onion soup mix - Be sure the onion mixture (which I sliced thinner than the recipe suggested but did cook in a seperate pan as suggested) is piled on top of the meat- not in the sides of the pan- this will keep onions from burning into the pan and will also carmelize right on top of the meat -at the end of cooking scrape all the onions off the meat into the pan- remove the meat (after it has cooled) wrap it in foil and put in fridge over night- put all the onions and all the juice in a bowl- add a little water to the pan- scrape the bottom of the pan- swish the water around to deglaze any beef and onion goodness stuck in the pan- add to onion mixture in bowl- cover and refigerate - next day take the meat out- trim off visible fat and slice it (I used an eletric knife) Scoop off all the fat from the gravy and discard it- Then I used an immersion blender to make the gravy - put the brisket into a baking pan- cover it with the gravy and reheat the whole thing at about 200 degrees for 30-40 minutes. Got raves from family.

Rating: 4
This was sensational! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used 1 1/2 cups beef broth and 1 1/2 cups red wine (beaujolais) instead of water. The house smelled wonderful all through the roasting process. Every hour I basted the brisket with the broth. I was serving it that night so I had to make the gravy right away. I strained the onion/garlic mixture out and added the hot juices to a roux whisking constantly until thickened. The gravy was delicious and so was the brisket. I will definitely make this again!

I was going to be out of town for the weekend and I was wondering if I could make it on Friday morning and refrigerate it for two days and finish it on Sunday. Would that be okay or would it ruin it somehow?

Substituted wine and chicken broth per other reviews and cooked for about 4 hours; refrigerated it after cooking it on Wednesday, sliced it on Friday and returned to pan with gravy, and refrigerated for another 7 hours or so; reheated at about 275 for about 2 hours before serving. Amazing.

I will add my 4 forks to the others. My highly critical brisket eaters really loved this brisket. After reading a few of the other reviews, I too added beef broth and red wine to the water. I needed 5 cups total and did 1 1/2 broth, 1 1/2 red wine and the rest water. What a wonderful flavor!!

Rating: 4
Fantastic brisket. I believe that brisket is best when simple and made with good technique rather than elaborate with eclectic ingredients. Although the other commenters use of wine and stock instead of water is probably a great choice. I did not have an appropriate pan, so I found a tin roasting pan with a very flat bottom, and placed that on a very heavy sheet pan. I believe this gave a nice brown crust to the bottom of the meat that tin foil couldn't achieve. I did not remove the fat from one side of the brisket and roasted fat side up. Without adding water, I had about two cups of defatted gravy. To reheat, I added a splash of wine and a cup of chicken stock to the pan, then added the gravy. I was surprised that the slices were pink-ish in the middle prior to re-heat, but they finished perfectly, even though I lowered the temp to about 250 because I had re-heated too early. Ended up reheating for about an hour at that temp.

Really leave the lid askew and check only every hour? After about 30 minutes, the onions were burned to the bottom of the dish. I kept adding more water and covered completely, but I still had to remake the gravy after the brisket had cooked. I think the temperature is too high.

I made my first Hanukkah dinner and this was a HUGE hit (and the leftovers were yummy, too!). I followed the tip to replace the water with 1/2 red wine and 1/2 stock (I used chicken). For that second day of cooking, I added a whole bunch of quartered cremini mushrooms - a great addition. The only negative I would say was that it was pretty salty (salt in the stock, seasoned the meat, salt in the onion mixture) so I would look to reduce that next time around. Also, I realized one hour into cooking that I had forgotten to put the lid on my pot! It turned out fine though - a real keeper.

I started making this recipe several years ago and it was an instant hit. When I happen to have an open bottle of red wine, I substitute 1 cup of red wine for one cup of the water. It adds to the richness but isn't necessary. This year for Rosh Hashona I was going to try a new recipe but my brother-in-law quivered his lip so much that I caved and I'm having the brisket along with the turkey. It has become a family favorite!!

I first made this recipe for brisket several years ago. I've made several other excellent brisket recipes since that time.

This is so simple and so good. Real comfort food. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect. I served it with mashed potatoes which were enhanced with the "gravy". While, in my opinion, not a gourmet dinner party meal, it will hit a home run for entertaining family and good friends.

I've made this three times and it always turns out perfectly. If the sauce is too sweet (depends on the type of onions used) I find that 1/2 tsp of chili powder and a tsp of tomato paste mellows it out. I've passed this on to family and friends to rave reviews. This one's a winner!

I usually do the b-b-q sauce type of brisket. This was "Company-style" brisket. Never prepared one like this before and it was just so tasty and moist and delicious.

I do not have a dutch oven and I was afraid that a foil cover would not hold the liquid so I browned the meat on the stovetop and then used a turkey bag inside a large baking dish.

This is to review and comment on recipes submitted by Epicurious. What is the point of putting in your recipe for brisket? This is an outstanding recipe and it is so simple to make. Nothing complicated and a real crowd pleaser. I bake it the day ahead, refrigerate overnight and then take it back to the butcher to slice on his machine when it is cold. It slices up beautifully and it servers more people as I have found people take about 4 slices regardless of how it is sliced.

My own 'best' brisket is really quite simple. I make a paste of paprika(hungarin sweet) dry mustard,garlic powder,crushed rosemary, and Montreal Steak mixture,,,add some oil to hold all together. Cover the meat with paste.( can marinate if desired). On large heavy weight silver foil, empty i/2 pkg. Lipton onion soup, place meat on it and add remainder of onion suop. Seal foil and place in large oven proof dish. Pour water ( later I use wine) around. 375 oven. After a half hour, open and reduce to 350. There will be a great deal of liquid..baste often.Cook 2-3 hoours. Last 20 minutes, pour Maple syrup ove top of meat and raise oven to 400. Will make a great crispy layer! I also refrige overnite and slice day of use. Hope I didn't leave anything out...I make it for all hoildays and vary seasonings as to what is closest at hand. Of course one can always surround the cooking meat with onions and carrots. I prefer to make glazed carrots and parsnips seperately. On

ok but i find marinating the nite before to be most useful and i rub oil and then dry ingredients like pepper mustard and paprika and garlic no salt because if the meat is kosher its already lethally salty my recipe calls for putting the brisket in the oven covered at 350F after its been seared with a cup of water, after about an hour add kosher cooking wine about a glass and cook it for another hour, remove from oven cool ,put in fridge overnite slice it cold against grain (as previously mentioned by other reviewer)lay pieces flat in pan on the already congealed gelatin from cooking and add a little water uncovered in stove at 300F-350F(depending on oven) turning the pieces over from time to time the day of the feast for another hour

Seared the meat, added 1/2 wine and slightly steamed carrots and celery at the end. Liquid did not cook away and had to remove a large amount. Aroma was awesome while it cooked, but taste did not live up to that. Felt it was pretty intensive cooking for a 'pot-roast' type meal. Will not make it again and will resort to my old recipe.

I should have listened to the person from Sydney and stuck with this recipe. I made the Apricot and prune brisket based on the reviews and much to my dismay, my guests went too thrill.

They do not want to step out of the box as the food is all part of the tradition.

Thank you for this outstanding recipe! I used a 2.5 lb buffalo brisket which had no fat at all. I made it just the way the recipe said, except for I did what JMechanic advised, adding 3 oz tomato paste and 1 t. brown sugar, but used homemade vegetable broth instead of water and 1/2 c. of red wine. It took 5 c. of liquid in all. I will use this recipe MANY times in future.

I made this dish for Hanukkah dinner and received rave reviews! My husband talked about it for several days after the dinner. Even one of my "gourmand" relatives said this was the best brisket he ever tasted and asked for the recipe. The recipe was time consuming, but well worth it.

Rating: 3
A great, reliable recipe! As previous reviewers have pointed out, searing the meat on both sides before roasting, and using wine/broth for the liquid both contribute substantially. I tend to cook smaller cuts than the recipe calls for, so I cook it at a lower temp (300-325) and baste from time to time. I usually pull it out when the edges are just ready to pull apart, but the center is holding together enough to slice. That way, it can be sliced the next day and put back in a pan with the gravy to reheat and get to that marvelous "melting into pieces" stage.

Rating: 4
There simply is nothing more to say besdies that this is one great brisket. Oh, wait, there is a bit more to say, to take this all the way to KILLER! First, do sear the meat on both sides after salt and pepper on both sides. Take the meat out, and gently soften and brown about 3 onions, then add the garlic and some paprika and cook it up a bit. Use at least 1/2 wine with the beef stock, and also add some tomato paste and brown sugar. Put the meat back in, fat side up, and cook as written, with the top ON, not ajar. The next day, remove the meat, scraping the sauce back into the pot, heat it a bit, and taste it, and add water or a little vinegar for depth. Buzz it up with an immersion blender, then add a bunch of thick-sliced carrots, and simmer till carrots almost cooked. Return the meat, sliced while cold, against the grain, to the sauce and heat. OH MY can you say pieces of heaven.

I've made this brisket three years in a row now, and it's an excellent recipe. You won't go wrong if you make it as it's written, but I've tweaked it a little to add more flavor. First, at the recommendation of my favorite aunt, I brown the brisket on both sides on the stove until it's well caramelized. For the cooking liquid, like many others, I use wine. I strongly disagree with cooks who tell you to use "the best wine you can afford," though. Use a good, basic table wine, and not something expensive. Remember, the wine is only a small component of this dish, and the strongest flavor components are beef and onion. I recommend Columbia Crest's Merlot-Cabernet blend, which is about $7, and available everywhere. Save the Bordeaux for the table. Most of the women in my family have braised their briskets in Lipton's onion soup; this may offend some foodies, but don't be afraid to use some in your brisket along with the wine. I tried that for the first time this year, along with the wine, and it was the most hearty, old-fashioned, rib-sticking brisket I've ever tasted. Regardless of whether you use wine, broth, onion soup, or just plain old water, here's one final tip. Just before you reheat the sliced brisket in the gravy, taste the gravy. If it needs a little brightening, toss in a teaspoon or so, to taste, of cider vinegar.

Delicious, tender, and easy. Add lots of dried halved apricots and prunes, as well as large chunks of celery in last 30 minutes.

I took the advice of other reviewers and used wine. My broth was 3 cups Cabernet Sauvignon and 2 cups beef broth and then I reserved 2 cups of the mixture, after boiling it with the cooked onions, to add during cooking. I covered the pan completely during the last hour of cooking since all the liquid was cooking out because the lid was left ajar. I must say that the broth cooked out of this quickly and I used the entire extra 2 cups during cooking. I was very worried when I took it out of the oven to find a thick sludge-like brown/black layer at the bottom of the pan and no liquid at all! I had to add another 2 cups of broth to make the 3 cups for the gravy. In the end, it turned out fantasic and delicious. I used a large Le Creuset covered roaster for this dish. I would have given this 4 forks but I changed so much of the recipe and I don't think it would have been nearly as good if it was made exactly as written.

It was fantastic! The whole family flipped over the brisket. I didn't get to make the gravy because the family was so ready to eat it after smelling it in the oven all day. I cooked it at 350 for about 8 hours. When it came out of the oven it was so tender we just mixed it up with the juices and it was wonderful. The onions just disintegrated. It was great on the first day, but the second day was even better!

This was my first brisket (6.08 lbs.) and a success. I intended to follow the recommendation of slow cooking at a lower temperature over the course of 2 days, however, it was basically cooked after the first 3.5 hours. On day two, I just cooked it in the gravy at 325 for 30-40 minutes. I did use the red wine and chicken stock for the gravy as suggested by other reviewers, and it was outstanding. Next time I will make sure to have more gravy.

My fellow cooks, look no further for a Jewish brisket recipe. This recipe is the real deal! Absolutely fabulous. I used one cup of red wine, 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth. I cooked it 3.5hrs yesterday at 325 degrees, (I think 375 is too high, brisket needs long slow cooking) and 3hrs today, at 325 for 1hr, and lowered it to 200 for the remaining 2hrs, leading up to the dinner. I had more than 3 cups of liquid after removing the fat. I didn't put the gravy thru the blender - didn't have blenders in the old country! ;)

This is the second year I have made this for Passover and at the end of the Sedar, I had to print up copies of the recipe for everyone to take home. The meat was so tender that you cut it with a fork. I too, used a combination of red wine and beef broth and eased back on the salt a bit. The sauce was a beautiful rich brown which my 9 year old got caught slurping up like soup. If he only knew it was made with onions!

Not bad. I have been making brisket for oh, so many years, and receive top raves always! Very simple...place 3-4 pound brisket (fat side up) in foil.. rub with dry mustard and sprinkle onion soup mix all over. Seal and place in pan. Be sure there is water at bottom. Cover and cook for at least 3 1/2 hours. Carefully remove from oven, open foil at top ( again careful for steam) and pour some maple syrup to glaze top. Return to oven uncovered and let it get brown and crisp on top. Then the usual, cool, and slice when cold. I too add wine to my gravy( the onion soup makes tons!) and use whatever is at hand, white or red. This has been a traditional brisket that I serve on Jewish holidays! Enjoy!

I made this recipe and the apricot, prunes and aromatic spices for Passover. Both were good but when it came time for seconds, this was the dish they all went for. I have made it again but I used a cheap cut of meat (I think it was blade or round) since brisket is so difficult to find in Australia. This recipe worked well since it is cooked for so long that the meat came out nice and tender.

Everyone loves this brisket. One substitution that improves the flavor - add 1.5 cups of red wine and 1.5 cups of water instead of the three cups of water called for in the recipe. Boil for a few minutes to cook off the alcohol taste before pouring onto the brisket. Also, you can add some carrots and potatoes to the pot before cooking.

Excellent dish, simple preparation. I didn't have beef broth, as many other readers suggested, but I swapped out half a cup of water for some pinot noir we had left over from the night before. Between the wine, onions, and beef drippings, the gravy is so rich and beefy that stock seems unnecessary. This is an easy dish to make, but don't cut corners: give it a full day, as the recipe states. Somehow, it really needs the time in the fridge to come together.

I cut the meat added a touch more wine and beef broth and cooked it at 320 for about 1 1/2 hours...it's was so tender. I've cooked brisket before and never had such luck. It was great as while preparing the meal the meat was my last worry. I cooked this for Thanksgiving (yes you heard it) dinner and it was fantastic. Definitely use the 2 cups red wine and one cup beef broth. I also studded the meat with whole garlic cloves (about 6) for the first 30 min then took out all cloves but 2..left them in and used them through the whole process. Great recipe!

This is an incredible brisket recipe! I use chicken broth instead of water while sauteing the onions, then add more once the brisket is in the oven. Instead of just reheating the second day I cook the brisket at 300 for another two to three hours, then slice against the grain for the most incredibly tender and flavorful brisket ever.

Question. Haven't made yet, but do you blend the onions into the gravy? MY mother's brisket always has onions roasted along with the meat, so that when eating you get meat, onions and pan drippings/gravy. It seems that in this recipe there are no onions at the end, only onion gravy. Is this correct?

hELP: I am planning on making this next week for a birthday party. I tried it tonight, it didn't taste great. Meat seemed stringy, is 375 degrees too high? There was more liquid at the end than what I started with. How do I make it better?Thanks

Absolutely wonderful. My husband doesn't eat leftovers but he ate this! I used beef broth instead of water. Everything else the same. Very easy and extremely tasty!

I used half wine and half beef broth for the liquid and basted every once in a while. It came out just delicious. Next time I might stud the meat with garlic. The gravy was great and just so easy.

I know this sounds a little bit trailer trash, but I added a cup of Heinz ketchup and some nice left over Pinot Noir, and marinated the cooked, sliced brisket in the gravy before reheating the next day -- and it was really lovely.

To the cook from Northern New Jersey. Don't give up on brisket. If you don't slice it against the grain, it will never be tender. That is essential. Any good flat cut of brisket will be tender if braised about 3 hours and sliced after cooling (makes it easier this way). And, prepared a day ahead, slice it cold and rewarm in the oven in your gravy (whatever recipe you choose) and you'll never be disappointed.

I had pretty much given up on brisket, since it never came out tender. Well, now I really give up. This was the most disappointing recipe I have used from this website (actually, it's the only disappointing one). I basically followed the recipe, except used 2c water, 1c wine as previous reviewers suggested. The beef was very dry and the gravy was mediocre. When I am starting dinner at 1pm, and it takes appr 4 hrs, I expect to have a meal that's special. I wouldn't make this again if it only took 4 minutes.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS and easy! Made this for in-laws while we were in Marshall Texas last weekend ... we're back in Minnesota now and they're still talking about how wonderful and delicious it was. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes, squash and oven-roasted green beans and the best fresh fruit salad ever.

Excellent recipe. Used two cups wine and one cup beef broth instead of water, and skipped the one hour cool down, and it came out very well. No other changes, would make it again in a heartbeat

I love to cook, but could never get my brisket to come out just right, until now. The recipe is easy, and delicious. The gravy was wonderful, I added about a cup of red wine right before re-heating. This one is going into my recipe collection folder!

When I make this recipe, I add 3 T tomato paste, 2 carrots sliced thickly, and 1 T brown sugar. For the liquid, I use 1 cup dry red wine and 2 cups water. And I bake at 350 instead of 375. It always comes out great!

I like to try different recipes for our annual Chanukah dinner and so I tried this one after reading the reviews. I did follow previous suggestions and used 1/2 merlot, 1/2 water. Our guests liked it way better than me. In fact, they were thrilled. I was unimpressed with the gracy so after putting the first round in the blender I added a can of tomato paste to the vegies I was blending and it brought it up a notch. I also added baby carrots for the reheating. Maybe it was me, because 9 other people were thrilled and they are all serious about their brisket. P.S. I got first cut brisket at Sam's for about $1.80/lb. less than the supermarket and it was very tender

Great recipe and very easy! LOVED that I could make it the day before. My mother gave me a weird look when she saw me reheating it that night, but then later had to admit that it was delicious. The gravy was also impressive (especially to my mother who always ends up slaving over gravy at the last minute) and so quick! Big hit at dinner!

Wonderful brisket! I entertain a lot and I love to cook. So I'm pretty picky about the food I serve. This recipe really delivered. I can't believe how easy and delicious this is. The gravy is lovely. I replaced the 3 cups water with 2 cups beef broth and 1 cup water per another reviewer's suggestion. I don't think you can ruin this dish. Best of all you can make this a day ahead so that all you have to do is reheat it in the oven giving you more time to spend with your guests. All of my guests said it was terrific and that it even surpassed their mothers' briskets.

Had a regular old brisket -- not prime 'first cut' -- and went looking for a recipe for something different than my usual BBQ method. Halfway through the preparation, I realized I was out of wine -- and it was Sunday. (Blue laws here.) Muddled through with inferior brisket and broth only. Yesterday, I skimmed the recipe again just to confirm directions for processing gravy, etc., and realized I had completely forgotten to add the paprika. So I hurriedly added a tablespoon before heating. Oops...it was supposed to be a teaspoon. Despite the comedy of errors, everyone thought it was great. And tonight, when I served the leftovers, they all pronounced the brisket "fabulous"! In future, this dish is going to be a three-day project. It's worth the wait!!

I have tried many brisket recipes over the years and they are almost always good. This one is fabulous. I did the one part wine to two parts water thing. I added more garlic and paprika(good fresh Hungarian paprika) than called for and cooked the brisket covered tightly for 31/2 hours at 275. No need to baste or check the liquid levels-there is plenty. Brisket is always better the next day. I love the simple technique and minimal ingredients here-simple is often better.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times and it just gets better each time. I only cook a 3lb brisket, so I roast it for less time (20 minutes) before adding the onion mixture. Also, I adjusted the recipe down to 2 cups of water, 1/2 - 3/4 tsp paprika, a dash of ground pepper, 20 small carrots, 2 beef broth cubes and 2 - 3 onions (garlic to taste). I use a combination of yellow and vidalia onions. When baking the brisket, after 1 hour I lower the temperature to 350 and bake for another 2.5 to 3 hours. I use a rectangular glass pyrex dish and cover it completely with tin foil. Note that the meat needs to be watched each half hour towards the end to see if more water is needed. After cooking, I remove the brisket and carrots, let the gravy cool down and blend the gravy and onions in the mixer, adding some more water as needed. It comes out great! I recommend making this recipe a day ahead. It just tastes better the next day! This is one delicious brisket.

Great brisket! Husband loved it - even kids liked it (I told them it was pot roast since they think they don't like brisket). Used the wine and broth suggestion and added baby carrots during last hour. I served it with rice pilaf but I think it would be great with garlic mashed potatoes.

This was very good and my whole family loved it. I didn't do the overnight part since I didn't have time, but I did wrap it up for an hour and skimmed the fat from the top. It was still great and I pureed it in the blender and couldn't believe I didn't have to add any flour! Wow!

My husband and kids gobbled this up there was no tomorrow---my husband said it was the best brisket he ever had. I did take the suggestion of using two C. chicken broth and one C. marsala wine as a sub for the water, but other than that I followed the recipe closely. Instead of wrapping the brisket and cutting the next day, I did cut it while fairly hot----I'm not capable of planning meals that far in advance! Worked out great, although it would have been easier to cut cold, I'm sure. Even better the next day (no surprise there either). I've made Nach Waxman's recipe several times and I find this to be far superior!

Every time I make this dish it gets wonderful reviews and completely disappears. Even my brother commented on how good it was and he doesn't do things like that just to be polite.

I added 6 large carrots and substituted 2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup merlot instead of the water. I kept the dish covered the entire time and baked it at 270 for 4 hours. There was no need to add additional liquid while cooking. The brisket was so tender, it just came apart so easily. Afterwards, I just took the juices, onions and carrots and pureed them without adding more stock. It was nicy and thick enough to be a wonderful gravy. Absolutely fabulous. And it was my first time cooking a large piece of meat!

I have yet to meet a brisket recipe I don't like, and this one is as good as the others (Nach Waxman's in Silver Palate Basics is my barometer).I used red wine, beef broth and water, added a few carrots to the mix, left out the paprika and added some good quality balsamic vinegar. Delish! The whole neighborhood can smell this cooking as my oven vents to my front porch. Everyone wants some!

I have been making this recipe since it appeared in December 1995. My husband swears it tastes just like his mother's. My family won't eat any other recipe. At the holidays, I make a 15 pound brisket and with 17-20 guests have only enough for lunch the next day --- maybe

My family loved this recipe. It requires cooking a day ahead which can be inconvient but it is well worth the trouble. I substituted 1 cup of wine for 1 of the 3 cups of water.

Rating: 3
I liked this, but permit me to offer a slight amendment. Per Nach Waxman's brilliant suggestion (see the "New Basics"), spread the brisket (as if icing a cake) with tomato paste, about an hour into the cooking. Gives the brisket a nice crust, albeit you need to like tomatoes. Brisket is hard to ruin; the trick is to make it wonderful, as opposed to just fine. And probably the most important thing is to get great meat to begin with. In DC, from whence I hail, try Freshfields, as opposed to Safeway. Happy Pesach!

This was a delicious dish!! I also used red wine along with water, 2 parts wine to 1 part water. Adding portabellos the last half hour is a great addition to the meal. The herb roasted potatos, also from epicurious.com, were also a great side dish. Will be sure to make this again and again!!

This is an easy recipe with excellent results. I used 1 cup of red wine along with the water. I also had to add another cup halfway through the cooking process. After refrigeration, I had about 2 cups of suace and a little over a 1/4 cup of fat. Very tender, very good.

Absolutely fabulous. Best brisket I ever made or eaten. I didn't have to make the gravy because for some reason, I ended up with more liquid, red wine and water, than I started with. The last hour I added nice sized pieces of portabella and porcini mushrooms. Was perfect with the latkes.

What a delicious dish...I think I remember this one as being submitted by Gail Zwigenthal-editor of Gourmet at the time. I used 1 cup dry red wine in place of 1 cup water, then about half wine and half water when more liquid was needed. The onions add a wonderful depth to the flavor, and the gravy is awesome. A+++++++++++, I serve this with mashed potatoes and I also added 2 pounds of carrots during the roasting--it could easily hold 3 lbs.

This is a very good basic brisket recipe, pretty much foolproof! I replaced the water with half beef broth and half red wine. I also added chunks of carrots and celery in the beginning of the roasting and they came out delicious. Before browning, I spread the brisket with minced garlic - the aroma and flavor of the meat was incomparable! A delicious meal for family OR company!

I was out of Paprika, so I substituted cayanne pepper. As this was a bit to spicy using the recommended amount, I added 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup molasses and 1 T Balsamic Vinegar to balance the heat. The result was moderately spicy and delicious. A great recipe!

What a great receipe....Passover in the summer no less....But since I live outside of Atlanta, GA, I substituted Vidalia onions for yellow....Try it, you'll like it!....The red wine was a must (I use red wine in all "longer" cooking meat dishes, stews, pot roasts, etc)....MUCH better then the "quicky" onion soup mix trick, which is just O K by me....This is a MUST try!

This turned out incredible. The meat becomes like velvet. Be sure to use "first cut" brisket. I also substituted one cup of red wine for one cup of the water, and a couple good splashes of balsmaic vinegar. The onions took longer than 20 - 30 minutes to carmelize, just be patient. I made this in the morning, let it cool and then placed meat in foil and gravy in a bowl and placed in the frig then sliced the meat and reheated half an hour before seriving time, worked out great. Served this w/ gratin potatoes and green beans with roasted onions. Heavenly. My guests raved. Absolutely will be making this again.

My husband and I loved this recipe. It was my first time making Brisket, so I was nervous. We had friends over for dinner, and their picky four year old even asked for seconds. I recommend substituting 1 cup of red wine for 1 cup of water. Also when adding more fluid during the cooking process, I usually added 1/2 cup water and another splash of red wine. I would make this recipe again in a heartbeat

This is terrific, I've made it twice. Better than my mother's brisket -- she uses onion soup mix; the caramelized onions in this recipe had a deep sweetness and were very tasty. I used homemade beef broth instead of some of the water for more beefy flavor, and sliced the beef after 2-1/2 to 3 hours and returned to the pan so the meat wouldn't fall apart when I sliced it (my mother's suggestion). One time I added 3/4 lb. sliced portobella mushrooms when I returned the slices to the pan, which was great.

This was a hit in my house with both the children and the adults. I used only two cups of water and added a 13/5 ounce can of tomatoes. I also cooked and ate the brisket within three hours because that was all the time I had, and it was tender and flavorful. Of course, the meat was even better the next night.

I have been making brisket using my mother-in-law's recipe for the past 12 years and hesitated using another. Most recipes that I had seen used packaged onion soup mix and that turned me off. However, this recipe looked authentic and ended up being totally acceptable (and consumed whole heartedly!) by my husband and children. I cooked it for 3 hours, let it stand for 2 hours, and then after slicing it returned it to the now condensed onion mixture. It was delicions!

During the last hour, I got lazy and didn't check the water level -- big mistake. The onions burned on the bottom of the pan and the roast was black on the ends. The amazing thing is that after trimming the roast and making another round of carmelized onions simmered with reduced broth to pour over the roast during re-heating the next day, it was really good! Can't imagine how good it will be when I do it right. Warning -- take the recipe seriously when it says to check the water level; it evaporates quickly, even if it doesn't appear to have changed at all in the first 2 1/2 hours!

I have made this numerous times since I saw it in Gormet magazine. It is my brother's favorite meal. Everyone I have served it to over the years has loved it. I have made it both ways, served it the same day or chilled overnight and reheated. I prefer to serve it the same day. You can never go wrong with this one, it is just like my mother's pot roast, but the preparation is easier I think.

The first time I made this I cut all quantities in half--almost had a disaster when the liquid got very dark. But, as it turned out, it made a fantastic, very rich gravy. The next time, when I added more liquid, it was very good, but not as complex.
