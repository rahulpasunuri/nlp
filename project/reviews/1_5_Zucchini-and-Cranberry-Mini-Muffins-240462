I think this was ok...I'd finely grate the zucchini next time, though, so it didn't taste so vegetably (I've had zucchini bread before, made by my mom's friend, which was moist and didn't taste like zucchini). I mean, the point is the make it healthy without it tasting so healthy, right? I might also recommend using less zucchini, maybe 1-1/2 cups instead of 2 cups. I made a number of substitutions to make it healthier, but I'd recommend cutting out the sugar altogether if you're using sweetened dried cranberries. You can't taste the sugar in the rest of the muffin anyway, so why bother using it? My substitutions: * buckwheat and whole wheat flour (1 cup each) instead of white and whole wheat flour; * 3/4 of 1/2 cup honey instead of light brown sugar (I had to reduce the liquid (oil) by 1/4 and increase the baking powder by 1/4 tspn to neutralize the honey's acidity; *low-fat yogurt instead of sour cream *no cocoa powder

Don't waste your time with this recipe. They are tasteless, dense and blah!

Larger muffins were OK but, even after 15 minutes in the oven, needed to be split and toasted.

This was a big waste of time and ingredients. As a previous rater posted, they were pasty, tasteless. Even tried adding more brown sugar and cinnamon before I made the second batch, but they were just as bad.

dull flavor, heavy pasty texture, disappointed...

meh. good but unimpressive. i followed the recipe exactly except i made full-size muffins instead of minis. it took them 15 minutes to bake at full-size. adding more cinnamon would be an improvement.
