Delicious! ...although quite time consuming. My husband asks for this dish all the time. I agree with the reviewer who thought it was too soupy; you didn't misread, it asks for one cup of coconut milk and 1/4 cup dessicated coconut. Next time I'll reduce the coconut milk and try serving it in lettuce leaves.

I thought this was awful!!! Maybe it is because I live in Asia and make my own.

I liked this a lot, especially with the fish red curry. I have only recently learned how tasty deep fried shrimp are with the shell and all. I only gave it 2 forks because as published, I find the recipe much too soupy. I think I would have been happier with only 1/2 a can of coconut cream and perhaps even less. Opps! My fault. I must have misread the recipe. I just saw that it only calls for 1/4 cup of coconut cream. So I have also adjusted my rating as I will adjust the ingredients in the future.

Very nice flavors, the pummelo was a pleasant surprise: it is much less sour than grapefruit, and lends itself to tone down the spicyness of the sauce. The preparation was a bit long for the final result, but worth it nonetheless. I made it in advance and let it marinate in the sauce (in the fridge): I was concerned that it would ruin the flavors, but it turned out to be a good thing, it infused everything with delicious coconut chili goodness.
