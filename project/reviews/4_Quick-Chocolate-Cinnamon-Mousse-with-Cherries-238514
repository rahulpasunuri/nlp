This is an easy, wonderful mousse. I used bittersweet chocolate and I didn`t make the cherries, although I will in the future. I made this for my husband`s birthday, and I adapted it a little. I left out the cinnamon and added about 3 tablespoons of Frangelico liqueur and topped it with finely chopped toasted hazelnuts. Fabulous!

Just OK. "Mousse" tastes more like light chocolate whipped cream (cinnamon not that distinctive in final product), and it would be a great recipe for that. I was also disappointed that the cherries lost their zing/tart after being cooked. Next time I would cook the jelly/port mix and then top with fresh cherries. A very lovely dish though!

Quick, easy and definitely delicious. I did not have port on hand so made it with bourbon (which I always have!). Fantastic results. Have also made the molten chocolate cakes with cherries on this site which is wonderful but this is similar with the dark chocolate and tart cherries yet minimal effort. Will make again.

How have I not reviewed a recipe that I've been making time and again for years? This is Fabulous, and (to quote another articulate reviewer from this thread) "Disproportionately good for the slight effort to prepare it." That sums it up perfectly, really -- no thermometer needed, no tempering of eggs, no lurking anxieties of your dessert-making inadequacies because a n y o n e can do this. Just boiling and melting a couple of things and whipping some others. Fold it, spoon it, and try hard to wait the four hours for it. SO worth it :)

This is a very good recipe for entertaining, as it can be prepared quickly and just popped into the fridge until everyone's ready for dessert (plus it gets rave reviews). Tart fresh cherries complement the bittersweet chocolate nicely.

Very good. Nice silky texture, but not as light as a mousse with whipped egg whites. Didn't taste the cinnamon. Melting the chocolate in the cream is an excellent method.You don't have to make a double boiler and the chocolate will not sieze. I'm sure I'll make it again.

This was the best of both worlds - a great return on a short investment of time. Family raved about it. I did not have cherry juice or port, but used cherry brandy instead - worked out fine.

This was so easy and sooo delicious! I used raspberry preserves and goji juice instead of cherry bcs that's what I had in stock. I'm sure it affected the taste and texture, but probably not too significantly. My only recommendation would be to double the amount of cherry topping made; we only had enough for a teaspoon or so, and there was mousse left over. I am going to make again with cherries on the bottom and on top. The mousse was phenomenal; the cinnamon was a great addition without being overwhelming, and it complemented the high-quality bittersweet chocolate and tart cherries perfectly!

I simplified this a bit more by combining the 1/4 cup cream with the cinnamon and chocolate, and heating gently in the microwave. The sauce took quite a while to thicken, and the cherries cooked - next time I'd remove the cherries partway through and just reduce the liquids.

3+ So good and easy, but you definitely need to invest $6 in a cherry pitter. Increase the cinnamon and play around with the alcohol -- other liquers work well -- but this is a dessert recipe that cannot miss. You will become very popular if you make this.

I was running short on time, but decided to give it a go anyway. I used 72% bittersweet chocolate and an eighth of a teaspoon of cinnamon - couldn't really taste the cinnamon at all, but the chocolate taste was incredibly smooth and velvety. I chilled the mousse in the fridge after first chilling my long stem champagne coupe glasses whilst I made the mousse to help it set faster. Chilled cherries in freezer, as didn't have three hours! Worked a treat. Didn't have any port on hand, so used a Pinot Noir, but added a couple of tablespoons of sugar to compensate. Delicious. Guests asked for recipe after first bite. Maximum impact for minimum effort.

Will it matter if I don't have time to let it set?

Quick and easy summer dessert! I used semi-sweet chocolate chips and the chocolate intensity was perfect.I didn't have cherry preserves so I used seedless raspberry jam and would do the same next time...it couldn't get any better! The mousse was light yet so rich and the topping a perfect compliment. Both are so good they could be eaten solo! Definitely a keeper!!

Disproportionately good for the slight effort to prepare it. An easy dessert to make for guests.

I used 1/4 tsp cinnamon and whipped the cream to medium-stiff peaks, and it set beautifully. A smash hit and it took all of 15 minutes to make. I served it in chocolate shells, and this recipe made 8 of the large-sized shells. Definitely gonna be a staple.

Superb! I didn't have the cherry ingredients, so instead I used fresh raspberries, raspberry preserve and raspberry vodka. It wasn't firming, so I added some flour, which helped. I didn't have a blender for the mousse, so added some flour to that too. Flour didn't affect taste to either and used 1/4 tsp. of cinnamon. Both sat for a day to firm. Stupendous! Made a homemade mousse fan out of me!

Wow! Talk about fast and delicious! It could have used more cinnamon since it was just a hint. But you could leave it out altogether.

This is my new favorite late-night treat. I don't even bother with the cherries (don't care for brandy), but the mousse by itself is fantastic. The best part is that it doesn't use eggs, so no worries about cooking the eggs accidentally, food poisoning, etc. Wonderful stuff.

Great. Easy. I made it super easy and used a jar of brandied balton cherrries from american spoon www.spoon.com

This is my idea of dessert - simple to make with minimal ingredients, but complex in flavor and impressive when you're done. A great end to a summer bbq since you can make it ahead. I plan to try it next time with cardamom for a new twist. YUM!

This is a good summer treat. I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I was tripling the recipe and used extra cinnamon. It could have used more chocolate. I made a much greater quantity of cherry topping than called for and was glad to have the extra. I also made the sauce with a combination of more port than called for and cherry juice . I didn't have cherry preserves or fresh fruit, just canned and frozen bing, so I also added a small amount of corn starch to the syrup. It was tasty and not too sweet.
