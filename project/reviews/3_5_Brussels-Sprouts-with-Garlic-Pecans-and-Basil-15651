I have to disagree with the folks who say this recipe is for people who don't like brussels sprouts. I love brussels sprouts and also loved this recipe. I followed it exactly except used sliced almonds instead of pecans (it's all I had at the time) and served it with farro.

I use to hate brussel sprouts and now I love them thanks to this recipe. A must with Christmas dinner

I think this is a recipe for people who DON'T like brussels sprouts. My husband and I (who DO like them) thought that the flavor was entirely overpowered by the cream, garlic, basil, nuts, and especially the lemon peel. There is just too much going on in this recipe. As an alternative, we recommend the Brussels Sprouts with Shallots and Mustard Seeds, which enhance and complement the sprouts, without trying to camoflage them.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and even people who swore they hated brussel sprouts enjoyed it. The only complaint that I received was that for those who loved brussel sprouts it didnt have the strong flavour of the veggie. Depends on your point of view. I loved them and am making them again for Christmas.

The best recipe for brussel sprouts! I agree with others that it is a bit rich; perhaps can cut down on the type of cream. Made it without nuts and it was just fine.

Quite possibly the best brussels sprouts I've ever made. I made a couple of changes to the recipe, based on previous advice - I cut the sprouts in half (this is a must for sauce absorption!) and reduced the cooking time slightly and I added a squeeze of fresh lemon juice at the end. Also, I couldn't find fresh basil anywhere so I subbed in a little spinach for the color/texture and used dry basil for the flavor. The vegetarian in the group made a meal of these. Absolutely outstanding. I made them again with walnuts instead of pecans and added parmesan cheese and crumbled bacon at the end - SO GOOD!

Good recipe. It is very important to use small sprouts or cut them in half!

To my surprise, I've been asked to make this dish for the 4th year in a row for Thanksgiving! Not that I don't think it's good, but come on brussel sprouts. Seriously, these are wonderful combinations.

As some other reviewers have mentioned, these sprouts were met with surprise and delight by confirmed brussels sprouts haters. The phrase I kept hearing was, "I don't like brussels sprouts, but I like *these*!" And for those of us who loved sprouts to begin with -- sheer heaven. It is a rich dish, but perfect for special occasion meals. For simpler meals, I will try the Colorado cook's recommendation of half cream, half vegetable stock. Enjoy!

A little too rich for my taste, and lacking in zest...interesting and different though. But I was disappointed in the flavor.

Our family loves this dish! The only modification that I would recommend is cutting the brussel sprouts in half - all the better to soak up all the good stuff. This dish was a smash hit at Thanksgiving - I even substituted 1/2 almonds as I ran out of pecans and it was still great!

Great way to jazz up brussel sprouts! Great reviews from my family!

Great, albeit rich recipe! Modifications: I used 1/2 cream, 1/2 veggie stock to make the dish a bit lighter (it was still quite rich- maybe 1/3 cream 2/3 stock next time) and added about 1/2 c. of juice from the lemon I zested. Outstanding!

We served this at a dinner for 8 that was auctioned off at our church fund raiser for 1,900.00. The entire dinner was great but all the guests raved about the brussel sprouts.

I used half brussel sprouts and half baby carrots. Also omitted the basil allowing the vegetable flavors to come through.

This is our absolute favorite brussels sprouts recipe -- we have it every Thanksgiving now! Worth the little extra effort for a rich, satisfying vegetable dish.

I never liked brussel sprouts (both taste and smell), but this recipe is wonderful. The combination of ingredients is so delightful to the tastebuds.

Fantastic - I have made this two years in a row for Thanksgiving and it has become a new family tradition. I also add some blue cheese just to really send it over the edge.

This was quite simple to make, but the flavors are fantastic together. Yum!!!!! I rarely make brussells sprouts any other way now.

Made this for my b/f who only eats vegetables under protest. I hated b/sprouts as a kid, but wanted to get past that. Made it exactly as directed except I hadn't any pecans on hand so I used pine nuts instead. *I* thought it smelled atrocious, but *he* enjoyed it! Won't be making it again -- regardless!!

Based on the good sounds of the ingredients and reviews from other cooks, I made this for Christmas for my family. It was slightly bitter and definitely uninteresting. I have to give it a zero rating.

Yum, Yum. My husband, who hates brussel sprouts, loved this. My kids didn't care for it, next time I'll leave out the lemon to see if they like it better. This makes a great veggie to serve for company.

Fabulous - the cream softens the sprouts - so incredibly easy - I made in advance - the only thing I would do different would be to wait to make just before serving - since it is so easy - its best flavor is upon finish from pan to dish. I give it a 10.

We made this for Christmas last year and Thanksgiving this year. Delicious. The second time, we skipped the cream and just cooked the sprouts in water. We also put the garlic in the food processor rather than chopping it--much easier--and added about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and a bit of olive oil. Yum.

I made this recipe last Thanksgiving from my magazine and my sister who hates brussel sprouts loved this recipe! She requested it again this year!

I STILL dislike Brussel Sprouts - but everyone else liked this recipe and have asked me to make this again. I find the Sprouts to be quite bitter!

Two people who were devout sprouts "haters" now love brussels sprouts (at least in this recipe). Others asked for the recipe. It will definitely become a traditional family dish at our table.

My spouse who loves Brussel sprouts would give this dish a rating of four forks. I find that Brussel sprouts have a slightly bitter taste and would rate this recipe two forks. Lemon juice helps to counteract the bitterness for me and I opt to add it at tableside.

This is definitely worth a repeat performance. Everyone at the table raved about the sprouts and wanted the recipe.

This recipe is very good and elegant. My kids loved it. Suddenly, yucky Brussel sprouts were not so bad after all. They were sorry when they were gone. Good enough for company and holidays and so simple to make. Most of all , the family liked it and it will be an everyday dish for us.

This was a very easy dish to make. It did take about twice as long as mentioned to reduce (about 20 minutes) even though the cream was boiling as briskly as I dared. I took this to a pot luck lunch at work where it was very well received and my wife made me promise to cook it with a dinner at home very soon.
