TO THE COOK FROM SEATTLE: I've never done it but I've noticed (from reading lots of reviews on this site) that many people make this sub regularly with good results. Fermented black beans may be quite unattractive in the package but do lend a more "authentic" Chinese flavor. We really love this recipe.

Just a question: Would purchased black bean garlic sauce substitute for the fermented black beans?

Took the recommendation and used 5 tbl of balck beans. I think 3-4 would be sufficient. Also found it to be an excellent use of left over grilled chicken. Substituted yellow corn for the peas and it made an interesting color presentation.

In my opinion at least five tablespoons of black beans are required to obtain the specific black bean flavour. Apart from that a genuine Chinese recipe, to which I also added some rice vinegar and brandy (I didn't have any rice wine). I also believe that it's best to blanch the snow peas for 2 minutes first, otherwise they'll be too raw.

Decent-tasting, but too much work to justify making again.

I thought that this was a really good recipe for chicken fried rice and have made it several times. The first time I made it, the family thought it came from our favourite Szechuan restaurant! I ran out of soy for the seasoning liquid and made up the difference by using some Chinese marinating sauce that I had on hand. I also did not bother buying chinese wine and used more chicken broth to compensate. I agree that it could turn out a little on the bland side so I added some Chinese chili sauce to taste and a little extra soy. Next time I may try adding some small shrimp and green onions. Will be making this recipe again for sure!
