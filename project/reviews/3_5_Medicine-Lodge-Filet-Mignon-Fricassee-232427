This was excellent. The other reviews kind of spooked me, but I wanted to try a lowfat recipe, and this was the one. I would put more mushrooms in next time because I love mushrooms. But besides that, it's perfect.

This sauce didn't work out for me as well as I would have liked. Nothing special, in my opinion.

The 'fricassee' or topping to the steak was delicious, with very intense flavours. I used straight-out beef stock instead of the demi-glasse, and this worked very well. Note that the tomatoes need to be peeled as well as cored. Next time I will start with some finely sliced shallot and garlic. I wrapped the fillet steak with streaky bacon, and after searing, 5 minutes in the oven at 200c was a perfect medium rare steak. I served this with baked and mashed kumera with a splash of olive oil and orange juice, along with bok choy blanched very quickly with a dash of peanut oil in the water and dressed with finely chopped fried garlic and peanuts. Great meal
