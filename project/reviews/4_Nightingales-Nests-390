Made these for a book club and absolutely WOWed the ladies in the club. A very nice alternative to the overly sweet baklava. Also, it would have helped and been easier to figure out the rolling directions if there had been a picture. I thought they would look like a nest but they really resemble a cinnamon roll. An easy make ahead dessert that would work for a potluck or an elegant dinner party.
