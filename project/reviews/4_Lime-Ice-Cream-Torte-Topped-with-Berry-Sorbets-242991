Made this on a very hot day to follow a fairly spicy meal and it was perfect. Very refreshing and great for a dinner party as it can be made ahead. I made it pretty much as written but did not bother with the berry sauce. I used mango and raspberry sorbets and let the kids sprinkle blackberries and mango on top right before eating.

Wow! The flavors in this are amazing! After I served this it got very quiet at the table except for the oohs and aahs as it was devoured. I was making it for a dinner for 4 so instead of the 9" pan with ice cream size scoops I made this into 6 - 4" tarts and used the melon baller to make the sorbet & ice cream scoops. It went together really easy and I had extra crumb crust and lime ice cream left over so I think it could be stretched into 8 - 4" tarts very easily. I used homemade my strawberry, blueberry and boysenberry sorbets, grabbed some fresh blueberries from the farmers market, picked fresh raspberries and marionberries from my garden and used my backyard boysenberries to make the syrup. I didn't find the cardamom seeds so just used ground cardamom. I made the crust and lime ice cream and combined the two the night before the dinner party. I also made the boysenberry sauce. The next morning I added the sorbet scoops before work. Tips for next time: work FAST with the sorbet; take only one container out of the freezer at a time; dip the scoop or melon baller into hot water before each scoop; and consider making the sorbet balls in advance and freeze really solid on a cookie sheet to make assembly even easier. I took the tarts to the friends' home for the dinner party and put them in their freezer. To serve we just added the fresh berries and drizzled with the syrups. It was very refreshing and because the bulk of the dessert consists of fresh berries and fresh berry sorbet, it was surprisingly light. The presentation is fabulous! I really like the idea of having such a show- stopper dessert all ready to go in the freezer.
