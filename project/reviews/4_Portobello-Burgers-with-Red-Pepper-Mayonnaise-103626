Excellent! Made almost exactly as is except for the vinegar...I just put the spinach on the burger as soon as it was off the grill so that it wilted into it. Also, I used soft whole wheat rolls...was afraid that a crustier roll would be too hard for the soft fillings. The mayo was so simple and yummy and came together perfectly. Some of the people at my bbq who initially wanted a regular burger ended up wanting this instead, myself included :)

I am vegan, so I substituted vegannaise for the mayo. I don't know if that's the problem, but the mayo turned out very watery. It had a good favor, but I had to add a lot of extra vegannaise and let it set overnight in order for the consistency to thicken.

Delicious and very easy and healthy recipe; a totally hit.

Served on grilled kaiser rolls. Liked it very much - not over the top fabulous but a good solid, easy to make dish!

My husband is not a fan of mushrooms, so I changed this to a pounded flat chicken breast. It came out wonderful and was a huge hit with everyone, including our 5 and 7 year old :)

Did not do the spinach or vinegar... just the red pepper mayo (FABULOUS) served with the portobello, red onion, and tomatoes (all roasted in the oven) and served on a whole wheat bun. What a great "burger" (which my husband loved too), and a great sauce that I will use for lots of things (sandwiches, salads, etc). Thanks.

I used the red pepper mayo for roast beef sandwiches. It was wonderful. The cayenne was perfect,it added depth without being too hot.

I like the recipe and found that cooking the mushrooms in a pan with a just a drop of olive oil turns out the best.

Easy, gourmet recipe! The red pepper mayonnaise really turns the sandwiches into something special.

This recipe is delicious and the red pepper mayonnaise goes well with plenty of other types of sandwiches. I will definitely be making this again.

Wow - my husband loved this and he's a "meatman". I made the sauce the other day for veggies - it's delicious.

We loved this!. The roasted red pepper sauce is out of sight! Only change was to make burgers on whole wheat buns and use a grill pan on top of the stove. Can't wait to try the red pepper sauce on meatballs as an appetizer.

I would order this in a restaurant, off of their lunch menu.

Wonderful recipe! Cut horizontal slices of crusty baguette and served it sandwich style subbing baby arugula for the spinach. Next time may try topping the mushrooms with slices of buffalo mozerella...then again maybe not-excellent as is.

I think I partially screwed this recipe up. I don't have a blender or processor so I put roasted red peppers on the burger. Then I decided to add some fresh mozzerella. There was such a competition among the different flavors, it was good, but not stand out. I love portobellos though and am making again tonight!

Made this recipe for my "strict carnivore" husband one night and he enjoyed it thoroughly (as did I). The portabello is just meaty enough to satisfy the most finicky "meathead" and the red pepper mayo adds a nice zip. A sure fire hit!

The red pepper mayo was great. I used arugula instead of spinach. It was very easy and tasty. It didn't knock my socks off but It is an easy weekday meal.

My husband wasn't too thrilled when he read this recipe, but he was more than thrilled when he tasted it. I used quality hamburger rolls and made it as a sandwich instead. Fantastic! I'm making it again for lunch this weekend.

very good recipe that is easy and fast to make. we double the red pepper mayo/rice vinegar mixture and toss extra spinach as a great side salad with some pine nuts and a little bacon, Yummie!

Actually, I was looking for a topping for the grilled portobellos, and I only made the red pepper mayonnaise to go with it. My husband usually avoids mayo, but he added extra sauce to his "burger." I will make this again.

Very easy to make and great results. I served the portobello on a good quality whole wheat bun, sandwich-style. The red pepper mayo was very tasty.

Delicious. It was better than I expected, even after all of the raving reviews below.

Very good and easy. The rolls I used were a little on the small side, so it was a messy affair, but very good. I'll used the red pepper mayo for many other things. I added blue cheese to the burgers and thought the addition was devine!

I also grilled chicken and added it to the sandwich. It was delicious.

I had a summer solstice cookout and these burgers w/red pepper mayo accompanied the cheddar burgers with carmalized onions (epicurious) - they went over fantastically (both types did). The roasted red pepper mayo is PERFECT with the baby spinach - just an all around wonderful meal. Happy grilling!

mmm mmm good. i made sandwiches out of it too, instead of bothering to toss the spinach with the mayo (in fact i totally forgot the spinach -- woops! -- but it was still yummy). actually, to be specific, i used plain old hamburger buns, added lots more garlic to the mayo, forgot the cayenne and the rice vinegar, and went whole-hog on the mayo (low-fat? puh-lease! ;-) and it was still delicious. this is definitely a recipe that can survive lots of modification. by the way, the calorie count on this can't be right -- one thick slice of bread's gonna be 150 cal at least. but if you follow the recipe it's probably not much more than about 250-300 cal total, veggies, mayo and all.

This was amazing. A great light summer meal! :)

Also threw some vidalia onion, tomatoes, and asparagus on the grill...cut the portobellos up into large pieces and put all the veggies on the bed of spinach. UMMMM. That red pepper mayonaise is great!

My carnivorous partner and I really enjoyed this recipe. (Boy, was he surprised!) I used whole grain hamburger buns to make it more like a "burger." I tossed the spinnach with some of the sauce and used it like I would lettuce on a burger, rather than resting the burger bun on top of the spinnach. I grilled the bun tops and bottoms, and I spread additional sauce on them before serving. I also prepared fresh asparagus the same way as the onion and portobello mushrooms (sprayed, seasoned and grilled) for a tasty side dish. The flavors in this recipe are delicious!

The burgers were very good and surprisingly easy. I skipped the spinach base and used two slices of bread to make a sandwich. I will definitely repeat this recipe.

I just loved this. It was fast, easy, & tasted great. I use the red pepper mayonnaise for lots of other things also, like crab cakes!

If you have a George Foreman Grill, you can cook the mushrooms and onions that way. They turn out just as good as on a regular grill. The red pepper mayo is delicios!

This is a delicious summer supper dish. The red peppers give the sauce a wonderful rosy color and the onion adds excellent texture and contrast to the hearty grilled mushroom. It was hard to believe that so much food and flavor could be packed into so few calories. I will definitely be serving this again.
