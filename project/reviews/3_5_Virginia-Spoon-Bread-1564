A Thanksgiving tradition for our family. It's a good savory alternative to corn pudding.

Good souffle consistency, but much too salty. I'll make this again but will cut the salt in half, reduce the pepper, and add 1/2 c. shredded cheddar.

Delish!! I too used white cornmeal and milk except for about 1/2cup and made up the difference with water. I also added just a little of my own creole seasoning mixture which has less salt that store bought versions. Very much comfort food and a wonderful change. Keeper!! I too can see adding other ingredients, althought the simplicy of flavors here is very nice!

Ok, I make my spoon bread with all milk. And I use four eggs instead of 3. But I love love love this recipe. Of Course I am the onle one in my family that eats remotely adventurous stuff, but even the picky parents ate some of this. Sort of a light light cornbread souffle.

This is a family favorite - I usually make it with white cornmeal. It goes well with meats as well as with eggs for a brunch dish.

Way too much salt and pepper; never actually set, even though it was dangerously brown when I took it out of the oven. Just not rewarding enough.

Try adding a half of a red pepper chopped. It's great.
