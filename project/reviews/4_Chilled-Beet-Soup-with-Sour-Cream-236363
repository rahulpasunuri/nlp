Wow is right! This soup is great. I also cut the vinegar and sugar in half. Try to use the celery root versus celery stalks as it gives the soup a super fresh flavor!

Outstanding, was a "wow" for a dinner party for 7. Used golden beets instead of red, and halved both the vinegar and sugar. Used cream fraiche instead of sour cream and put a dollop on each bowl for serving - our guests stirred and blended themselves. Definitely will make again

From extremely simple preparation to light & delicious flavor, this is a definite keeper. Next time though I will not add sour cream to the entire pot.
