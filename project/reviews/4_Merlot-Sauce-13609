This is very tasty and easy to make, although I wish the flavors were a bit more complex. As is it's just sweet and jammy from the wine - next time I think I'd add a bouquet garnis of parsley, thyme, bay and perhaps some peppercorn.

I used my own home-made beef stock and maybe that was my downfall. It was good, but not excellent. It needed to be thicker.

I read all of the reviews before making this, and as always, I am a skeptic on whether or not to adjust or not adjust a recipe. However, I made this last night (after trying countless other red-wine reduction sauces in the past with success) and this by far is the BEST recipe EVER! It is exactly what you get when you go to a 5 star restaurant and order a steak with a red wine demi-glace. I also LOVED that you can make it in advance and loose no flavor thanks to pre-pakaged demiglace. I used a good quality balsamic vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar (found at Trader Joes, Balsamic Vinegar of Modena in the small bottle). Don't make the mistake of buying the cheapest vinegar you can find, it can ruin all of your hard work! I used Demiglace gold "classic french demi-glace" found at my local specialty supermarket. Additionally I used BV (Buena Vista) coastal Cabernet Sauvignon ($10, my favorite red to cook with, without burning my pocket). And 1 cup of shallots for the onion. I highly recommend this recipe. The vinegar and sugar carmel complement the sauce amazingly and although there is a hint of sweetness all of the flavors balance out incredibly. I was tempted to add a few herbs, but I held back and was happy with the result. Good Luck and Happy cooking!

This sauce is incredible! It demands a lot of your time, but rewards you for it. The first time I made it, I used reduced beef broth because I had it in the pantry. It was yummy, but never thickened like I thought it should. The next time I used demiglace. Definitely use demiglace if you can, it makes a huge difference in the flavor and consistency.

This sauce is so good that guests were using it as a gravy for my cauliflower puree that accompanied the filets. At first I thought this was a bit sacreligious, but I was hooked once I took a bite. An excellent sweet/tart accompaniment for a whole meal! Really quite easy to make, as well, once you've finished the caramel part of the sauce.

I wish epicurious would remove the word quick from this recipe. It is simple and easy, but I am making a large batch and it is now in it's 4th hour.....but oh the flavors that are developing as it slowly reduces! I used veal stock and then have been adding small amounts of demi-glace over the past hour. I made a "test" recipe the other day and thought it had a littly too much vinegar taste, so I have reduced a bit and used a combination of red wine vinegar and balsamic. With 30 people for dinner tonight, I will weigh in with the final rating tomorrow.

I absolutely love this sauce. I dont know what the cook from Illinois did, as I've made this with even cheap wine with excellent results. Often, I've used reduced beef stock rather than demi-glace. For those who want a thicker sauce, try pureeing the onions rather than filtering them out. (with extra butter if needed.)

I am a very experienced cook and I can always tell just by reading a recipe if it will be good. I am also a firm believer in following a recipe to the LETTER, at least first time I make something. This recipe read weirdly (vinnegar and sugar with beef) However, with all the glowing reports, I went against my better judgement and made this sauce for my christmas dinner. Started it the day before and thank God I did. It was unbelievably horrible. So much time and effort for such a bad result. If it was sweet and sour, maybe I could have handled it. However, it was bitter and the underlying sweetness was all wrong. I called a friend who is a chef for help. He suggested some mustard - which did help a little. I also added the juice from the meat - also helped a little. My husband, who will eat anything, insisted I serve it, but I insisted my guests put it on the side of the plate for tasting before ruining the delicious prime rib. I certainly will not make this again.

The flavor was excellent. Reminded me of the Beef Tenderloin bacon/shallots/port wine recipe. I was surprised I could not find a comment that gave the ratio of demi-glace paste (from williams sonoma) to liquid. I wound up using about 1 tbsp per cup of water/stock (before reducing). I also wanted a thicker sauce so I added some butter mixed with flour (equal parts each) till I got the consistency I wanted.

My daughter and I did this sauce over some filets for a special dinner. We found the veal demi glace at Williams Sonoma. Although pricey; it was fabulous. I made some of the sauce again and gave it to some friends for them to use. The compliments are still pouring out.

This sauce was excellent. Yes, it does take a little while to make and veal stock isn't cheap, but for a special occassion it is well worth it. Definately strain it before serving...looks much better that way. I served it over filet migon and it was very, very tasty.

HELP! How does one work with demi-glace? Does this recipe actually mean 2 cups of demi-glace? the 10 oz I bought cost me $30. The salesperson told me the demi-glace goes a long way. I don't want to ruin this recipe.

I made the other night and served it with sauteed venison steaks. I left the onion in because I served it with game. I also only had beef broth to work with so I reduced it significantly before putting it in the sauce. The rest of the family loved it and I will be making this again soon.

I loved this sauce, but I had a major disaster preparing it, which I want to share if it can help others. I'd never used demiglace before and did not realize it needed to be diluted before adding to the red wine. I added it straight and the sauce became one big ball of gel. I realized my mistake and had to add four cups of water to compensate. Then, I had to reduce for a half hour. I ended up with a delicious sauce, though. It was thick, too. So, maybe a (small!) bit of extra demiglace will help people who felt the sauce was too thin.

Rating: 0
People that are complaining about this sauce being too thin aren't using veal stock or demiglace. The natural gelatin in veal is much higher than in beef. Make your own veal stock and freeze it in one cup portions. You'll only have to make twice a year or so and it's the base for dozens of classic sauces. Beef stock just doesn't gel the same way.

Rating: 4
Outstanding flavor. Very, very impressive. I used the recipe for mashed potatos with pureed carrots so no one would be asking for traditional gravy. Next time -- and there will be one! -- I don't think I'll strain out the onion. While it's probably prettier without it, the taste is so memorable it seems a shame to waste even a mouthful. (If anyone has a good idea for what to do with the strained onion, please post it.)

Made this last night and wow! I do admit I altered the sauce a bit by using shallot instead of the onion and Balsamic Vinegar instead of Red Wine Vinegar. It has it's own natural sweetness. Also because of the complaints about the sauce being too thin, I added 2 TBS of Flour to the butter/onion mixture and constantly stirred so it would'nt burn and the sauce had just the right thickness. Will definately make again.

I made this sauce for a dinner party last night served with a prime rib on the grill!! It was delicious just like the reviews said! I will diffently make this again it's a keeper!! I only had beef stock concentrated for the veal stock but it was great, next time I will get the real stuff. If this was good without it can't imagine how tasty with!!

I made this for a huge dinner party. I tasted the sauce after completion and it was horrible, I mean really really bitter. Unservable. I was in a panic. So I gradually added more sugar and all of a sudden it transformed into amazing flavor. I used a very good St. Emillion wine ( which is basically a Merlot ) so I can;t explain it, but if this happens to you ADD MORE SUGAR. It was then fabulous.

A rich and flavorful sauce...excellent with filet mignon or beef wellington. This recipe is a keeper!

Absolutely wonderful, what more can I say. I've made this dish for several dinner parties and holidays, and it's always won rave reviews from my guests. This sauce is amazing... when I make it, I double, or triple, the recipe and portion it out in freezer bags. It freezes, and re-heats amazingly well, and it's ready when you are! Try it - you won't be sorry.

I didn't find it enough to flavor a filet mignon by just drizzling over it, but the sauce itself was tasty, if on the thin side. I added some sliced portobello's for the last 10 minutes, and the soaked up the flavor so well that they ended up almost overpowering the steak. it also goes well alongside roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

I've been making this sauce for about 3 years now, and it always gets a terrific reaction. I tried it without the demi glace in the past, but it makes all the difference. Plan ahead and take the time to find it! If you can't find a specialty shop locally, there are dealers online that will ship it to you.

VERY TASTY!!!! I had a similar dish at a restaurant in NC, and wanted to find a similar tast to try at home. One bite, and my family was hooked! I added cornstarch to thicken a little more, and served it with crumbled bleu cheese. Delicious!!!

Rating: 3
Took lots longer for me to make it. Needs to be reduced once again after it is strained. Is a little sweet, so it benefits from roasted garlic mashers alongside. Go easy saucing the plates. Rich veal stock and demiglace aren't available here, so I took a quart of Swanson's beef broth and reduced it to two cups and went on from there. Very tasty.

Great sauce. Made a few changes - added 1 cup demi-glace instead of 2cups and reduced it with the wine & 1/2 cup port, also. Reduced it more than recipe called for - wanted a thicker sauce. Was delicious. Will add shiitake mushrooms and shallots next time. Good recipe.

I am not a big more is better fan, but I added a tablespoon more of butter to finish the stick and it added so much flavor!! Made it ahead and once cooled you can skim off the fat. Also added chopped garlic and a little bit of red onion for due purposes. And just a TBSP of Tarragon vinager for kicks. I cooked it a little longer because veal broth is not readily available where I live and had to reduce a beef broth. Crumbled some gorgonzola over the beef and potatoes and voila!!

I chose this sauce for a special birthday dinner. It was simple and delicious served with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, carmelized shallots with snap peas, and mushroom stuffed filet of beef. I used beef flavored broth which I reduced by 50% and made the sauce the day before. No straining necessary and everyone loved it!

I made this last night over a grilled ribeye I served with roasted potatotes and grilled asparagus. Delicious! I have only one word of warning -- for those of you who can't find a demiglace, take one of the other reader's suggestions and try and boil down some regular stock. I didn't do this and just used plain beef stock. The sauce didn't thicken as it should have, and the caramel made it a tad sweeter than it should have been. The deep flavor and gelatin in a demiglace would add both of these factors. Otherwise, I was fantastically happy with this, and plan on making it again.

Sorry to be the lone dissenter here, but we didn't like this AT ALL. The recipe, followed faithfully, produced a sticky-candy-sweet sauce that belonged on ice cream, not a steak. It's my fault for actually believing that sugar added to meat sauce would be good.

This is a real keeper....what a fantastic sauce! We were grilling some beef fillets for my in-laws and I wanted to "dress up" the beef with a sauce. I followed the directions for the most part but I did take a few reader suggestions and instead of using only red wine vinegar, I used 1.5 tablespoons red wine and 1.5 tablespoons balsamic vinegar. I also added fresh garlic and shallots to the onion mixture. After straining the sauce, I added fresh mushrooms and let the sauce simmer. We poured the sauce over the beef fillets and everyone went crazy! It was so good that I made the same thing the next weekend for my own parents for Father's Day. This is a really gourmet sauce! I served the beef/sauce with garlic redskin mashed potatoes and fresh asparagus drizzled with lemon. Try it....you'll love it!

Velvety-rich sauce that is lovely with beef. I have prepared it several times, adding mushrooms into the sauce for the last 15 minutes of reduction. My dinner guests adored it!

When making this sauce, I couldn't find demiglace sauce, so I substituted twice the amount with low sodium beef stock and simply reduced it down longer to get to the 2 cups. I also used my hand blender to puree the onions rather then strain them out. It gave the sauce a thicker consistency, and was wonderful!

I have made this sauce several times and it is a staple in our kitchen. Whether for dinner parties or dinner for two it is an excellent accompaniment with any cut of beef - grilled, roasted you name it. Don't be afraid to add mushrooms and/or shallots. In fact with left over prime rib, I added sauteed mushrooms and shallots along with sour cream and served it over noodles. But it is just perfect the way it is.

I came across your sauce and decided to take a chance on it--I am so glad I did! It's been wonderful each time... I made it for our Christmas Eve dinner this year with a vegetarian demi-glace and balsamic and rosemary (as per the other reviewer's suggestions--FYI, I find the kind of balsamic used makes a huge difference in tartness). It received rave reviews--even from my vegetarian guest over his grilled tempeh steak! For those of you with interest, the vegetarian version of demi-glace is called Mirepoix, and you can find it at www.williams-somoma.com. It's about $30 for a jar, but its quite good and just wonderful if you have vegetarian family/friends to feed and still want to make stylish meals. You can also use a concentrated mushroom-based bouillon to make excellent stock. Enjoy!

I really wanted to give this recipe 2 1/2 forks & my boyfriend wanted to give it 3 1/2 forks. Anyway, this recipe was straight-forward & very easy to make. However, I will use a low-sodium beef broth the next time I make the sauce because I thought that the sauce was a bit on the salty side.
