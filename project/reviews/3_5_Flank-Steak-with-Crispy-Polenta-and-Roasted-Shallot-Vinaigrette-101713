Delicious-even though my polenta was a little lumpy-I only made half the polenta as it made alot-the balsamic was rather heavy because I used a very good, thick balsamic so would cut back on that a lttle next time. I also used skirt steak as it is a better piece of beef. Very easy and quick once the shallots are roasted.

I used some pretty thick top sirloin filets that were on sale ($4/2!!), dried thyme, and plain polenta (sliced straight from the tube). After roasting the shallots, I heated my cast iron skillet in the oven for ab 20 min while I prepped the steaks and polenta. I melted butter in a skillet, sauted some garlic until clear, then fried the sliced polenta a few min on each side (3-4 slices/person). When the skillet was good and hot, I seared the steaks a couple min on each side (over high heat), then stuck the skillet in the oven for 3 min. They were perfectly med rare...I plated them on the polenta and put a little sauce on top...it couldn't have turned out better. Now I don't really measure anything, so while the sauce worked for me I can imagine it going wrong really fast (its super acidic).

I could not find thyme but instead used rosemary for the recipe. Other than that, I followed all the directions and I LOVED the recipe. If cooked correctly, the steak comes out tender and succulent and is a truly delicious pair with the fried polenta. I made my own polenta from cornmeal and it really wasn't as hard as I expected and the flavor was great! I paired the recipe with a Tuscan kale salad from the recent Bon Appetit issue and it was perfect!! A wonderful, well rounded dish.

I used skirt steak and store bought polenta. Great combination.

An easy and delicious meal -- and you can do it all on the grill. I used pre-made polenta rolls to save time, sliced it and grilled it along side the steak. Instead of using regular olive oil for cooking the steak, I poured off a little of the shallot oil (before adding the balsamic) and used that. Can't wait to make this again.

The viniagrette really added something! It's been a few minutes but the flavor comes right back to me. I made the polenta by spreading it in a jelly roll pan and baking a tad, then cooling in the fridge to firm it up before frying. It seemed a little greasy to me but still pretty good. Even my 2 year old enjoyed it.

It might have been me but this was so so. I did reduce the oil in vinagerette quite a bit so it was perhaps too thick however it was much sweeter than I expected. Polenta is a great add to steak. I'll give this another go!

I cooked this over a fire in our fireplace on my Tuscan Grill. This added a lovely smokey taste that really went with the roasted shallot vinegrette sauce. I, too, used storebought polenta which made this a very simple recipe. I sliced the steak in thin slices rather than in big pieces. I also did agree with the other review that it was a bit too oily. Next time I'll cut down on the olive oil. But over all this was really good.

I was looking for a beef recipe that didn't require lots of marinating time and this was a big winner. I was especially surprised - and pleased by - the flavor imparted by the herb rub (to which I added some minced garlic). Only one **slightly negative ** comment is that the vinagrette was too oily for my taste so I found myself adding extra balsamic. Probably will cut down on the olive oil next go-around. As others noted, you can find pre-made polenta (basil & garlic, sun-dried tomato, etc) in a good gourmet grocery...well worth that little shortcut. All in all, a combination of surprising flavors that worked very well together.

This was really easy and good, the only thing I changed was that I marinated the steak for a couple hours with olive oil, garlic, and rosemary, and used store-bought wild mushroom polenta. The polenta was kind of a pain, but worth it. The vinaigrette was fabulous. My friends devoured this!

found this recipe searching for a way to use up our leftover polenta. wow, it was met with rave reviews and insistance that it become a regular! we were really impressed. had to substitute dried thyme and skip the chives as the local market was weak on herbs today, so look forward to that extra bump in flavor next time :)

Delicious. Used skirt steak instead of flank steak, which I feel is a more flavorful piece of meat. Had to do some experimenting with the polenta, though. I found the best way to saute it is to flour (or bread) the polenta rounds and use half butter and half olive oil in the pan.

This is a wonderful way to prepare flank steak, the sauce is to die for. I used the sauce as a dressing on fresh spinach YUM. This will be served at my next dinner party. Resturant quality

This sauce is just terrific! After reading the other reviews, I cooked the polenta (1 cup polenta in 5 cups chicken stock), added 2 Tbsp parmesan, sauteed garlic, and then let it cool overnight in the fridge. Then I baked it in a greased dish at 400 degrees for 15 minutes so it wouldnt be so hard to handle, and then pan fried it as directed. Really great recipe!

I was looking for a new recipe for flank steak that was different from all the Asian inspired ones I seem to have, I decided to give this one a try. I'm glad I did. This was really good and remarkably easy to prepare. The Roasted Shallot Viniagrette was such a good complement to the meat. The only things I'd do differently would be to cook the garlic a little longer, there were still raw garlic overtones to the polenta. And I think I might saute the polenta in olive oil instead of butter. My polenta rounds went flabby, not exactly sure why. I also found the roasted shallots were easy to juilenne using a knife with a serrated edge.

was tastey.you can buy prepared polenta in a tube in the grocery store,saves much time.

I paired this with grilled asparagus with saffron and it was a winner! Do pay attention to the confusing part re: the olive oil. The last 1/4 cup goes with the meat and the reserve stays with the shallot sauce. I'm not a big fan of flank steak so I used rib eye about an inch thick. It was my first time using polenta and I think I need practice as it was hard to handle. But it did fry up nicely and it may be important to chill it for the two hours. The recommended wine was also a hit.

The polenta was delicious and made the meal. I didn't like the lukewarm vinagrette with the hot polenta and steak.

Delicious--I loved the balsamic vinegar in the dish. However, my polenta rounds went soft and mushy when I sauteed them. Any suggestions on how to keep that from happening?

This recipe calls for "hot cooked polenta". Should I make a basic polenta from a recipe on this site or is there and easy substitution (such a store bought)? Thanks for suggestions!

I was surprised by the unique flavor and beautiful presentation of this dish. Sure to impress company. I forgot to get asperagus which I think would have been best, but served it with steamed carrots which was very good.

Excellent. Very simple. I have been cooking less than a year and it turned out just great. The polenta had an excellent garlicky flavor and went perfectly with the meal. I served with sauteed mushrooms (I also found a recipe on this site for those.)

Made this recently for my supper club and received rave reviews! The flavor of the vinaigrette is excellent. This will definitely be in the "active" section of my recipe file.
