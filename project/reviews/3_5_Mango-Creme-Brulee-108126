It is much easier to use a torch then broiling. It is faster and neater. You can get a hand held butane torch at any hardware store, and the butane at walmart in the camping section. Sometimes you can find the torch there too. I also concure that the mango gets lost in the the recipee and would be better on top, but it is a great recipee and fun to serve. You can use the mangos as a garnish with a small dalop of whiped cream. Then your dinner guest can slowly pull the fresh fruit in the the dish.

This is a great recipe. I have used it several times. You can add any fruit or berry and make it the same way. We also like it plain. It makes a great vanilla Cre`me Brue'e. It is easy to do. I also get my Vanilla beans online at my spicesage.com. This is great website if you live in a small town or community where more exotic spices and ingreegents are hard to come by.

This recipe tastes great, but i can't ever get the broiling right. I now use a flambe kit from dessertsnow.com & it comes out perfect every time. No torching & great aromas

My husband loves creme brulee, and this met his expectations. I was nervous, as I had thought it would be tough to make, but it was actually really easy. Using nice, soft, ripe mangoes made a huge difference the second time I made it. You can't go wrong with the mixture of fruit and creme brulee!!

While I love mango and I respect the simplicty of a creme brule, I was a little disappointed by this recipe. I used ripe but firm mango, which I thought would be perfect. But the flavor of the mango was completely lost, and the little bit of liquid it gave off had a slight negative impact on the consistency. I agree with an ealrier reviewer... I'd probably try adding the mango on top afterwards next time. This might produce a mixture of textures... the soft creme brule, crackly sugar top, and refreshing mango on top, as well as allow the mango to be more prominent.

I live in India and have access to delicious Alphonso mangoes..known as the "king of mangoes"..during the season. I make this dish with those mangoes and it is a great hit with all my friends. If you do not have a blow torch you can caramelize the sugar in a pan and pour on top of the creme brulee. It works just as well. I like to let it harden and then lightly crack it with the back of a spoon to get the typical creme brulee "crackle" effect.

This dessert was simple and delicious! Even my guests who said they typically don't like creme brulee said they loved it! I used a sweet, ripe mango, which I think makes a big difference. (I suspect other lesser reviews of this dish may have used underripe fruit.) Another tip is to not make the servings too large - leave them craving more!

I love fresh mango and I love creme brulee, but not baked mango. I would recommend just making the creme brulee and adding fresh cut mango to the top when serving. Noone in my family, including me, liked this dessert.

I made this recently for a special dinner. It was super easy and very tasty. It is a bit time consuming though, you need lots of lead time for chilling. I'm a bit of a purist with crème brulee and love just the custard. The mango was good, just not my thing. In response to the earlier message about re-chilling after melting the sugar... That seems like defeating the purpose of cool custard with a warm crispy top. To me that is what crème brulee is all about.

These were delicious and very easy to make. The only thing I would do different is way more sugar on the top - I like a thicker crust - and the recipe didn't mention to re-chill after you broil the sugar top which is a must. Probably going to make it again this weekend.

This is an amazing creme brulee recipe. Very easy to make (and this was the first creme brulee i've ever made at home). I even sped up the "chilling" time by putting the ramekins in the freezer for about half an hour (I couldn't wait the 4 hours). The mango is a nice surprise when eating (although you want firm mangos, since they do release a bit of juices while baking). Will definitely make this again.
