Made an okra believer out of me. Easy to make, healthy and a dinner hit.

This was really good. I added a sweet potato and lots more curry, plus garam masala. Used yogurt instead of coconut milk. Will definitely make again!

I'll make this next time with more okra instead of the chickpeas. I used ripe tomatoes instead of canned tomatoes, which contributed to the good flavor, I believe.

I too have been getting okra in the CSA box. I used plain whole yogurt instead of water, and added more garlic and curry powder. We also used frozen tomatoes from the CSA and their juice - yum!

We've been receiving okra from our farm delivery service, and a couple of times we let them sit too long, so I had to find a simple recipe so they wouldn't go to waste this time. This recipe was incredibly easy and quick. The few things I changed were 1) added extra fresh chile peppers; we like our curry spicy 2) used coconut milk instead of water as one cook recommended. 3) used 2 heaping teaspoons of curry powder, one spoon was madras curry, and the other spoon was punjab curry. This is going on my quick meals list for sure. I can imagine adding tofu to this dish for extra protein.

This was just good, not great. The curry base was tasty but I guess I didn't care for the combo with the okra? Like other reviewers, I used coconut milk in place of water and bumped up the curry powder. Also served with Greek strained yogurt and the suggested cinnamon rice which really made it better. Glad I tried this one, but I'll stick with the curried cauliflower chickpea stew which is far better in my opinion.

We made this because we had okra from our CSA and it turned out surprisingly well. We had less okra than the recipe called for, so we added some peas to compensate and that worked out well. Also, we used a can of tomatoes with chiles since that is accidentally what we purchased, but that deviation from the recipe was great because I think it gave the dish more of a kick.

This is a healthy tasty way to use okra when you have extra--which I have lots of at the moment! I had read the other reviews, and so did add more seasoning all around, otherwise I am sure it would have been bland. I used 4 garlic cloves and 2 Tablespoons ginger and 3 teaspoons curry powder. I served with plain yogurt on the side, which was delicious with it.

Yummy. Like other reviewers I added more curry powder (4 teaspoons) and 1/8 tspn red pepper and it had a nice flavor. Will definitely make again.

Great for a day to day, easy dish. Nothing to showing but quick and tasty. Great base for many dishes.

On the whole, very tasty. A simple, easy meal that worked well. I would give it 4 stars except that it wasn't too exiting... great for day to day use, though- try it. Loved the spice from the curry powder.

My two suggestions would be 1.) adding the chickpeas in earlier with the onions so they cook a bit more. (Mine still had the can texture where I like chickpeas a little charred on the outside and soft inside. 2.) I substituted coconut milk for water which gave it a creamy, delicious liquid for a sauce.

From the South I have several good okra recipes and didn't think this would be as good, but I was wrong. It's zippy and spicy and delicious with a flavor not commonly associated with okra. What a wonderful side for Indian-type meals!

Wow! woodward17 has got it right. Indian food is not even my favorite and I scarfed it right down! This recipe is a keeper.

Blah. And that's coming from someone who loves all-things-curry. I ended up adding more garlic, another teaspoon of curry, substituting butter for the oil, increasing the butter by a tablespoon, and adding a 1/2 cup of plain yogurt. By then it was tasty enough to serve to my guests, but nowhere near the original recipe. Pass on this one--or be prepared to do some major tinkering.

An excellent base to start with. Change to meet your needs. A quick and easy weeknight meal. Also a excellent meatless dish. It will be part of our meal rotation.

To a Cook from Washington, DC: regarding your inquiry "one can of chicken breast", I believe the reviewer is refering to canned chicken breast meat. It's located in the same section of the supermarket as canned tuna, turkey, etc.

I am intrigued by Woodward's own recipe and interested to try it. Question, what do you mean by "One can of chicken breast"?

I couldn't find okra, so I subbed zucchini and I served this over whole wheat couscous instead of rice. Very, very filling and flavorful (although I did add a little extra curry and garlic).

As one who has Indian heritage and experience cooking various curries, there are some obvious things missing. Here is the recipe the way I did it and to the delight of many Indian friends and family... now it's a 4 star recipe: 1 1/4 lb small fresh okra, left untrimmed, or 2 (10-oz) packages frozen whole okra (not thawed) 1 1/2 tablespoons vegetable oil (substitute butter to make much it tastier) 1 medium onion, chopped 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped 4 teaspoons finely chopped peeled fresh ginger 1 Tablespoon curry powder 1 (14- to 15-oz) can whole tomatoes in juice, tomatoes chopped, reserving juice 1 (19-oz) can chickpeas, drained and rinsed (2 cups) 2/3 cup chicken broth (use the broth from the can of chicken breasts) 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/4-1 teaspoon whole black pepper corns 3 whole cloves 1/8-3/4 teaspoon chili powder (to taste) 3 large bay leaves One can of chicken breast, reserving the broth Accompaniment: cinnamon-spiced rice or basmati rice If using fresh okra, trim, leaving tops intact, being careful not to cut into pods. Heat oil in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking, then sauté onion and garlic with ginger, curry powder, pepper, and chili powder, stirring, 2 minutes. Add tomatoes with their juice, chickpeas, and chicken with broth and boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, 3 minutes. Stir in okra, salt, cloves, bay leaves, and simmer, covered (uncovered if thicker sauce desired), stirring occasionally, until okra is tender, about 10 minutes.

Definitely good to make - easy if you have cans of Chickpeas and tomatoes lying around. And the Cayenne and Tofu are both good suggestions to bulk it up and add some kick.

Needs a little more spice--I added some extra ginger and curry powder. It was tasty and healthy, but not a dish to impress others with. Definately make the cinnamon-spice rice to accompany the dish.

This tasted like a dressed-up version of Southern okra and tomatoes to me. I added chicken, lots of extra curry and cayenne, and the dish still lacked any umph. If I made it again, it would be as a side dish rather than a main. There are better curry dishes on epicurious to try.

I make this all the time. Quick, yummy, and nutritious. I use canned black eyed peas instead of garbanzos and sometimes add tofu. Sometimes throw in some hot peppers or cayanne for a nice kick too.

Healthful, filling, and delicious. I, too, added extra curry powder, and also used all fresh tomatoes. Indian 'comfort' food. So quick and easy, I'll be making this regularly as a one-dish weeknight meal.

great quick weeknight dish. added 2t of cayenne to give it a nice kick. reminded my husband of a dish we used to order at our favorite indian restaurant. next time i will add more veggies and top with seared tofu.

Just a note to some one who suggested cutting the okra: Remember once the pods are open you get the "slime" factor. I like that about okra, but that is the quality that most people do not like about okra. A good meal for the non-meat eaters or those of us who try to get some meatless days.

A flavorful dish on its own but superb for plating a grilled salmon filet. I made the following modifications/additions: olive oil instead of vegetable, jamaica curry powder (strong ginger notes), Szego paprika, a vegetable bouillon cube, cherry tomatoes, and finely chopped parsely. I simmered the curry for one hour on low heat to develop the flavor. Then I ladled the curry onto soup plates and placed a grilled salmon fillet on top. Mm.

Very quick and easy. I also added more curry powder to the recipe. Along with the extra curry powder I added fresh cilantro and a few potatoes. My boyfriend doesn't like tomatoes so I cut back on those. Good recipe.

I don't think this dish is good. As some people had already mentioned, I added more curry powder. I could tasted curry, but it didn't have any flavor.

I loved it - my family didn't. Hence, I would make it again for myself. I would slice the okra to keep the size of all the vegetables uniform.

It was really easy to make (good for weeknights) and very tastey. It's like instant Indian food. I also added a little extra curry powder, and I liked it a little better over brown rice.

An excellent side dish or main course. I added slightly more curry powder and a few extra grinds of black pepper.
