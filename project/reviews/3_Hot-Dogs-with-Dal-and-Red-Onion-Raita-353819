Surprisingly good! I followed the advice of another reviewer and made a more complex dal (more spices, onion, also jalepeno pepper and bay leaf). I also substituted low-fat yogurt for whole milk yogurt in the raita, and just left out the lemon juice since it was a thinner consistency already. Also used chicken sausages instead of beef hot dogs. Turned out great!

Sounds odd but this was really good. I altered it slightly because this dal recipe is a bit too simple (I started by sauteeing a bit of onion in oil, then added garam masala, cayenne, the turmeric, whole cumin seeds - I then made added the lentils and water to simmer as directed). I also added more yogurt than called for. Very yummy!

Seriously? I made the raita and dal which were just ok but I refuse to waste them by putting them on a hot dog. WTF Bon Appetit?? I'd expect this from BH&G but not YOU!
