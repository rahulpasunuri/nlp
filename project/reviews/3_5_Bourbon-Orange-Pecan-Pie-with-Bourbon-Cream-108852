Tasty pie! I made a little over 2x the amount of crust for decoration. After placing the crust dough in my 9.5" glass pie dish, I used an acorn shaped die and then placed the acorn shapes pieces around the edge with a dab of water. I made leaf shapes and placed them on top of the pie filling with pecan halves ( chopped pecans were substituted in the pie filling). I had extra pastry leaves, so I sprinkled them with cinnamon and stevia and then adorned the whipped cream when serving. Note that the candied orange peels are a bit of extra work. They were fun to make and taste, buy the finished candied peels were so hard that I thought my Cuisinart was going to die when I was chopping them. I also think that my oven required a lower setting as the crust got a little more golden than I would prefer.

I loved this recipe. A couple changes I made...I subbed Gran Marnier for bourbon and I took everyone's advice and added 2 Tbls. cornstarch. I also used almonds instead of pecans. My pie set up super fast...within a half hour. I also added gran marnier and orange zest to the whipped cream. This is definitely something I will add to my menu. Loved it!

There was enough filling for two pies. At least I preserved the pecans by placing them in the pie shell and pouring over the fillling. It was good, not great.

I wasn't able to find candied orange peel, but the orange grind was enough to add the citrus taste to the pie. I definitely would recommend adding the 2 tbls of cornstarch as most people suggested. I added 4 tbls of bourbon in the pie, 1 tbl of bourbon and 1 tbl of freshly squeezed orange juice in the whipped cream. Fabulous!

First, I fat washed my bourbon with bacon fat to give it a smokey flavor. When I make the pie again, I'll use less candied orange peel or none at all because the orange zest already adds a nice citrus flavor. As is, the recipe could use a little more balance.

I added the 2 T of cornstarch, which lowered the cooking time substantially (to 35 minutes). Good pie.

A lovely pie, even without the whipped cream. Nice flavor, not overwhelmingly sweet. I, too, added corn starch to the liquid mixture, and it turned out to be too much for a 9-inch deep-dish pie plate. But I baked the overflow in a small glass bowl, and it tasted great. Butter crust was nice, too.

Flavor was great but I forgot to use the helpful information provided in the other reviews and therefore didn't add cornstarch. Guess what happened?! The pie didn't set. We ate the pie a little bit runny, but didn't want to cook any longer for fear of overdoing the crust, even with foil around the edges. The orange and bourbon addition make this pie very unique and a nice departure from the standard (kind of boring) pecan pie. I will definitely make again- with cornstarch!

This pie is delicious! However, it is not for the faint in the kitchen. It is a little high maintenance and the recipe needs adjustment. Per previous reviews, I absolutely added the 2 tbsp of cornstarch into the mix. In addition, I cooked the pie for probably 70 minutes not 50 with the last 20 minutes having the pie covered completely with foil. This pie could stand probably 2 more tablespoons of bourbon, otherwise the orange flavor is perfect. If you have to stick to a recipe, do not make this pie. If you can go with the flow, it is worth it. Much less sugary than most pecan pies and the whipped cream was quite refreshing.

Add extra bourbon to the whipped cream for an extra kick.

This is delicious. Period. It will be hard to go back to the classic pecan pie now that I know this is out there. It was a hit at Thanksgiving.

I made this recipe for thie first time for Thanksgiving dinner this year... It was GREAT! The bourbon and orange together were fantastic. I did,however, add the 2 tablespoons of corn starch that others have suggested as the mix was very runny. Also, I let mine bake an additional 9 minutes, with foil around the edges. At 50 minutes, it was still pretty loose. ( We live at about 6500 ft though and I know that the altitude plays havoc with my baking...) GREAT PIE!

This is the best pecan pie ever! Very flavorful instead of the usual ho-hum syrupy taste of normal pecan pie. Add all the orange peel (lots, you can't go wrong) and the bourbon, you'll get rave reviews, I sure do--everyone loves it!

Thanks for tip Larry - corn starch worked great. I did not add the candied orange and substituted 1 tablespoon of fresh orange juice for bourbon. Nice balance to bourbon and orange flavors.

Two comments: 1. After reading about problems with runny filling, I added two tablespoons of corn starch. The results were firm (and tasty). 2. I had trouble with the crust sticking to the pan, but I overfilled it, so some of the filling ran down between the baked crust and the pan. I suspect this carmalized goo caused the problem. Next time I'll be more careful. Meanwhile, plate it where nobody can watch, and cover with plenty of bourbon cream!

The crust fell apart the first time I made it then burned. The pecan filling was tasty, but I've made better. Overall, this was pretty disappointing.

Dear A Cook from Morristown, NJ, So sorry to hear your troubles. I made this pie last Thanksgiving, and I have just finished baking the pie I will be serving in two days. I include the candied orange peel, but diced it very, very fine. I also use Knob Creek bourbon. It is a very good balance to the citrus because it has a very oaky flavor. Yes, I do prebake the crust, but am very careful not to overcook, but cook enough so it is done (it is a dark sand color, barely browning). I use a different crust than the recipe (from Baking Illustrated-great book) and roll it out pretty thick. I didn't have any trouble with it sticking to the bottom (no fluid leaked through, maybe because it was cooked thoroughly and was thick). When baking the full pie, watch it carefully that last 5 minutes of baking time. Mine wasn't done at 45 minutes, but was browning at the bottom a little more than desired at 48 minutes and I took it out before it burned at all. Note - I put a strip of foil around the edges of the pie so the crust edges don't burn. I had that problem last year. Oh, I also keep rotating the pie because my oven has a hot spot in the back. I hope this is helpful. Oh, ps. This isn't a firm pie. Mine turned out good, but is a little loose in the filling. I really think the alcohol makes it more liquidy, but it was a huge hit anyway. Everyone begged me to make it for Xmas last year after they had it on T-giving (and these are not pecan pie lovers). You could try keeping the pie in the fridge and then take it out t-giving day to let it get to room temp.

I want to make this recipe again,but I need help...I made it last year for Thanksgiving and it tasted terrific (left out the candied orange). My problem is it did not firm up too well and the crust was totally stuck to the bottom. It came out onto a plate looking like slop even though it was completely cooled. Would it make sense to prebake the crust? Temperature adjustment? Ingredient adjustment? I would like to get this right as it was well received except for the plating. Does anyone who makes this type of pie regularly have any tips?

I do so love my pecan pie AND bourbon and was thrilled at the idea of the winning combination BUT Pecan-Pie- lovers beware! I made this pie for Christmas Eve and was unfortunately not so happy with the results...not a lot of resemblance to a pecan pie here flavor-wise, and agree with many other reviewers about leaving out the candied orange. I will say it looked absolutely beautiful, and will try again w/o the orange 'culprit'...face it folks, it is a very sweet pie and probably shouldn't be tampered with...

Made this for Thanksgiving. What a hit! It's a gorgeous flavor combination with the orange, bourbon and pecans. This will be a repeat item on future holiday menus.

I baked this pie for Thanksgiving dinner, then baked it a week later for a dinner party. I left out the candied orange and used 2-3 tbsp. orange peel zest. Everyone loved it. The Bourbon whipped cream was just as big a hit as the pie itself. Will definitely make this again.

Very easy for a novice pie maker and it got such raves for our Thanksgiving dinner. The bourbon whipped cream topped it off beautifully. Albertson's grocery has candied orange peel in it's "ethnic" food aisle, and it's not expensive. I think it really added to the flavor.

This is the 2nd year in a row that I made this pie for Thanksgiving to rave reviews! Everything about this pie is sublime, from the crust, which is easy to make, to the filling, which really is set apart by the orange zest, and good bourbon. I am telling you this is a crowd pleaser, especially when you pair it with the bourbon whipped cream! Definitely use Maker's Mark, and get ready for a beautiful, and more importatanly delicious pie!

I thought the orange and bourbon flavors were perfect! I wanted to try this because I wanted something different than the standard pecan pie, and this was exactly what I needed - a little twist, subtle, but delicious. Not at all overpowering. I used purchased candied orange peel, which made it super easy, and also perhaps had less bitterness than making my own. It was plenty sweet like regular pie, but enough richness and depth to the taste that it wasn't the same-ol'-pie. I halved the recipe and it was a good amount for a tart pan (or regular 9-inch pie).

Rating: 4
This was yummy. Contrary to other posts, I think it's just as sweet as a regular pecan pie. I did what others suggested by eliminating the candied orange peel. I also made this twice. First time I used a commercial deep-dish piecrust. With it, there was no need to pre bake the piecrust. Also the commercial deep crust is not deep enough to accommodate the entire filling. I had to use two piecrusts and cut down the baking time by a few minutes. Also I didn't see the need to toast the almonds prior to putting it in the pie either time I made this. The second time, I used the butter crust recipe suggested. I must have put too much flour in, because the crust stuck to the pie pan. Never the less, it is a really great recipe. It got rave reviews both at work and at the Thanksgiving dinner.

The whole family loves this pie. Have made it twice. Seems to not be as sweet as the usual recipe. We find it bakes perfectly without baking the crust blind.

This has become a holiday staple - and this comes from a southern girl who knows about pecan pie. The bourbon and orange give the usually "heavy" flavors of pecan pie a nice zing. Always a hit. In a rush I have substituted Marie Callendar's frozen pie crust (they aren't as sweet as some ready made crusts) and they work well.

Didn't bother with the crust from scratch, but made it from a box. It turned out well anyway. My pie didn't set up very well, so maybe I should have let it cook longer. It did have a great taste and got good reviews from guests. I spent too much time worrying about the bourbon as got differing opinions about what qualifies as bourbon. In the end i used Jack Daniels Sour Mash Whisky, which I was promised was just a finer quality bourbon than Jim Beam. It did add a lot of flavor as did the orange. I didn't find the candied orange so used about 3 Tbls. of grated orange peel, which seemed to work well.

This is the second pecan pie recipe I have used. Good Recipe. I appreciate reading the reviews before making it. (Even the older reviews are a great resource)It helps to note the changes others have made and thier results. I used half the amount of orange peel and left out the candided orange...very pleased with the results. I will make again. Thanks!!

I am a pecan pie lover, and this is really tasty. I used maker's mark burbon and doubled the orange zezt instead of candied orange peel (not a fan). My only complant was that the orange flavor was a bit too strong. I'll back it off a bit next time. Yummy otherwise.

This pie is the best! I'm usually not a fan of Pecan pie as it's usually too sweet for my taste. Not this one. Also I left out the candied orange peal and didn't miss it. There was a subtle hint of orange and bourbon (I used Jack Daniels), just perfect. I got raves.

I agree with the person from Edmonds,WA. This had to be the BEST pecan pie I have ever tasted. I left out the candied orange peel, and added a little more of the fresh orange peel. I just plain don't like candied fruits! It was perfect, and everyone who ate it, loved it just as much. It will be made for every fall/winter holiday from here on out!

If you don't have candied orange peel, you can make your own. The recipe is in Joy of Cooking. I couldn't find any either, but it is terrific if you do add it to the recipe. This one got raves at Thanksgiving!

Absolutely the best pecan pie I've tasted. I left out the candied orange peel, but didn't miss it because of the grated fresh orange peel. The 9" pie pan was full, but worked just fine. I would watch how it browns at the end of the baking period...the pecans got a bit dark. Will definitely make this again.

We, too, have made this pie several times since making it for the first time on Thanksgiving. We used very good bourbon (20 yr old-not Jack Daniels) and it makes a difference! Oh-we've always omitted the candied orange-I can't find it-and it is still delicious. We add a teaspoon of orange extract instead. We'll make some for gifts as well as for ourselves!

Rating: 4
I made this with maple syrup in place of corn syrup and rum in place of bourbon. The combination of the maple, orange and rum made the flavor far more complex and much less sickly-sweet than your typical pecan pie. A keeper!!! 2 warnings: This really needs a 10" pie pan, and I would be very vigilant about overbrowning the top.

Rating: 4
I've made this THREE times in two months and people go crazy for it. It's also very easy and you can mix the whole thing using a basic wire wisk. Once, I chopped up some orange-flavored Craisins when I couldn't find candied orange slices and it worked out well.

I did not have candied orange so I left it out. Orange flavor was complementary, not overbearing. Bourbon cut some of the usual sweetness of pecan pie. Will make this one again!

I thought this was going to be divine. The crust did puff up as the recipe indicated and when I patted it down it must have had a few cracks remaining because the filling seeped under the crust. The biggest problem was that the pie became overly browned even though I checked it several minutes before it should have been done. This was a big disappointment. I have better pecan pie recipes. Too bad this sounded so good.

Rating: 2
I was disappointed with this recipe. The orange flavor was overwhelming and the alcohol taste was odd. Some recipes are enhanced by wine/alcohol etc, but in this recipe it seemed out of place. It was also very time consuming to candy the orange peels. Next time if I want a hint of orange in a pecan pie, I will use a regular pecan pie recipe and add a tablespoon of grated orange peel.

Rating: 4
I made this for a dinner party and it got rave reviews. Perfect combo of pecan, orange and bourbon! This was a practice run before Thanksgiving, and everyone concluded this pie should definitely make the "Thanksgiving Dessert Team".
