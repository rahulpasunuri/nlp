Its a good meatloaf, tweak it as you see fit - I used sliced garlic & garlic pwdr in a mix of BBQ sauce, ketchup & chipotle pwdr. Re: Salt---Good grief I'm truly amazed how many "Cooks" have no common sense! Of course its too much salt! I assume a simple typo. What shocks me the most is that if you put 2T salt in you obviously no nothing about basic nutrition or daily sodium levels.Though coarse salt is milder than table salt 2T when added w/the other hi sodium ingredients is obviously overkill. Use your brains people. The recipe is a very good one but you s/not follow anything (In LiFe)blindly that just does not make common sense! Think for yourselves. If you don't know, then chalk it up to trial and error and you Learned something! Dont blame the chef, In any recipe some ingredient amts make sense some dont -No excuses,this 1 was obvious

I ALWAYS read the reviews before I make a new recipe, but forgot to this time. Would have been lovely in texture and flavor but for the SALT. Ugh, how disappointing.

While I enjoyed the ingenuity of this recipe, I must admit the end result can be summarized in one word: busy. I would recommend leaving well enough alone and NOT stuffing the already complicated loaf with the additional herbs and garlic at the end. The bay in particular we could have done without. Indeed, even the croutons pressed into the top seemed a bit much. Sometimes basic really is better.

I had to edit this because I didn't have everything on hand--but that said, this is great. I didn't have bacon or carrots, so those didn't go in. And, if you like spice, I chopped up a couple of canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and added them. I then substituted the adobo sauce for the barbecue sauce. Unlike others, I did put in the unpeeled garlic cloves. I stuck them deep into the meatloaf, and the result was that it was easy to slice and eat them with the meatloaf. Fantastic recipe--it's grown-up meatloaf. I'm actually a little surprised by how much I liked it.

This was very flavorful. I agree with other reviews to cut down on the mustard and salt. My meatloaf fell apart a little but I used 2.14 lbs of beef.Maybe I needed a bit more breadcrumbs. The whole crouton thing was too complicated for me.

I tend to follow a recipe exact the first time.. and regret doing so.. too much salt.. OMGoodness... and too much mustard.. it overpowered any chance of flavor. will try it again and make adjustments. did not do the crutons and garlic..

My husband is still talking about how good this meatloaf is. I try to follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it...that being said I did follow the advice about the salt. I used maybe 1/4 tsp but we watch our salt intake. Also used pork,veal beef mixture, definitely a great idea. I did not use bacon but sauteed veggies in bacon grease (I keep some in refrigerator). The flavors meld together wonderfully, no one thing stands out. I agree about the unpeeled garlic cloves..mine were still uncooked so will omit next time. Did use the bay leaves. I used too many croutons. Think you should just have enough to put meat loaf on. Used the wax paper trick also. All in all a totally delicious recipe. Will be making it over and over again.

Excellent. Makes quite a lot. Don't forget to correct the salt. I used a dash and it was more than enough.

An exceptional recipe, with a tragic misprint. There is no way the amount of salt is correct - 1 tsp is sufficient. 2 TBSP would be ghastly and inedible. I don't bother with the garlic and breadcrumbs on top, and the result is always spectacular.

Wonderful flavors. My only complaint is this: I'm a fan of coarse salt, but this has WAY too much. Remember, the bacon is going to add some serious salt as well. I'd recommend 1/2 of the coarse salt.

This was a very tastey change to the old classic, but i would still make a sauce,possibly a wild mushroom gravey.

Absolutely horrible. This recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of salt it could be a misprint 2 teaspoons would have sufficed. We couldn't eat it. Too much Dijon. A total waste of time and money.

Way too salty - the 2 Tb of coarse salt is complete overkill and hurts an otherwise creative, tasty approach to meatloaf.

Rating: 4
Even though I modified the recipe a little bit, it is still a wonderful and simple dish! Less salt for sure. I baked it in a traditional meat loaf pan. I used half beef, half veal. My husband asked me to make it again the following week! Dijon mustard and BBQ sauce are nice unexpected touches.

The best meatloaf I've ever made! Used about a tsp of salt and didn't bother with the croutons or whole garlic. Yum! I will make this again.

Delicious - get's rave reviews every time. Definitely reduce the salt by half, and don'y skimp on the breadcrumbs!

I truly do think this would be an amazing meatloaf--utterly moist and vibrant flavor--I only wish I had listened to my gut feeling or at least read all the comments before I made it. There's definitely too much salt. 2-3 teaspoons would have been plenty. Followed the suggestion to accompany it with some bland mashed potatoes. Also, I think additional black pepper at the end helped balance it out.

Made this last night -- my husband and I both loved it. I used only a teaspoon of salt, as other reviewers suggested, and the flavor was wonderful, like an improved, grown-up version of the meatloaf I loved as a kid. I'll definitely make this again, though I may halve the recipe since the overall yield was a bit much for just me and my husband. It would probably be the perfect size for a family. Tip: I used a piece of waxed paper to help shape the loaf and then transfer it to the crouton-lined pan -- it was far easier than juggling the loaf between two spatulas.

Excellent. I substituted mushrooms for carrots. Omitted the salt completely as the bbq sauce gave enough flavor. Also used meatloaf mix (veal-pork-beef) from grocery store and made it even more delicious! Also omitted horseradish. I would definitely make again and can't wait to have my meatloaf sandwich the day after!

Beware - this recipe has a misprint. There is so much salt it's inedible. Spent an hour preparing and an hour cooking and all went to waste. Perhaps 2 teaspoons of salt instead? In any case, easily the worst recipe I've tried from this website.

This is a great base for an excellent meatloaf. I made some changes and it came out as the best meatloaf I've ever had. I omitted the bacon, I only used 1/4 cup milk, I used 1/4 cup ketchup in place of barbecue sauce, I omitted the horseradish, and I seriously cut down the salt and pepper. The result was an amazingly flavorful, moist meatloaf. Served with mashed potatoes I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. For leftovers the next day I made it into an excellent Shepard's pie.

I've made this meatloaf recipe twice. It calls for two tablespoons of salt. I added it, per the instructions. The end result was an over-salted dish that ended up being uneatable. I made it again last night and added only one teaspoon of salt. Again, the result was better, but on the edge of being too salty for both me and my husband. We ate it with mashed potatoes and it cut the salty flavor a bit. If you make this recipe, I recommend using NO SALT. I question whether the recipe might have a mistake about the salt usage (2 tbl vs. 2 tsp?). Unfortunately, 2x was the charm for us and we'll be using a different recipe next time.

This was really good. Family loved it. However, I don't really get the unpeeled garlic cloves. They didn't seem to roast enough to eat them afterwards and I don't think they imparted any flavor into the meatloaf. I also used only 1 tablespoon of salt. Will make again.

The best meatloaf I've ever had! Just a few changes - I did not have BBQ sauce, so I used ketchup and my husband does not like horseradish sauce, so I just did not use it. I used less salt as well, since the first time I made it it was a bit much with the bacon I used. Will be doing this forever!

This was delicious except for the salt. It was way to salty and I will cut the salt by at least half next time I make it. I used toasted slices of baguette under the meat and they tasted OK but were too hard. I also used panko bread crumbs on top and that added a nice texture. My husband loved it and he hates meatloaf. Really good flavors but lose the salt!
