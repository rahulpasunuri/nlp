It's bland because it has no salt, which is great if that's what you want, but otherwise a 1/2 tsp the the final mix will do wonders for the taste. I used about 1/2 the parsley and onions, substituted lime juice for lemon juice, added a 1/2 tsp of salt and it was a hit.

This was good and it looked great, but I agree it was a bit bland.

This was a little bland. I tried to counter the blandness by substituting cillantro for the parsley, but it really didn't really take care of the blandness. However, I added some garlic-yogurt dip (used for the soup that was served), and it helped it alot.

I did add a clove of finely minced garlic,used fresh summer tomatoes cut into wedges, Italian parsley &cooked my own garbanzo beans. We really this salad. You could sprinkle some feta or goat cheese on top.

It's okay, but a little bland. I'd definitely use it as a side dish instead of the main attraction.
