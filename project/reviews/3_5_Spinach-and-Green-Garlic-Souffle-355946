This was fantastic. Even my 'not into egg dishes' husband really enjoyed it. Will definitely make this again.

This is a double yum! I looked it up when I found green garlic at my farmers market. I made this as written on two special occasions. My guests made it a point to rave. It was a bit more --not a lot more--work but worth every minute. Thank you Deborah Madison! PS There are many more such wonderful recipes in her Local Flavor Book.

I made this for dinner tonight and it turned out great! I've never made a souffle' before and it was much easier than I thought it would be. I made this a pantry meal by using garlic scapes instead of green garlic and cream cheese instead of goat cheese and cooked it in a 8x8 inch square dish. The garlic scapes gave the souffle' a great bit of texture. Without them, the dish would have been way too soft. It was really yummy but not cheesy enought for me so next time I will use goat cheese and probably more parmesean. Great recipe!

Great combination of flavors. The goat cheese added depth. It is quite labor intensive and made far more batter than can fit in a normal souffle dish, so have another greased and parmesan-dusted dish waiting in the wings. Overall, the recipe was delicious.
