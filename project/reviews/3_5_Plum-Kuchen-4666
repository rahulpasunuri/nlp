This is a beautiful cake, and now my go to recipe! I made the following changes: ~Double the plums (used black plums) ~Substituted vanilla Greek yogurt for the sour cream. ~Used 1/2 the vanilla (due to vanilla in Greek yogurt) ~Extra almond extract, as prev. suggested ~Extra cinnamon & 1/4 tsp. Allspice ~Extra butter drizzled on top as previously suggested. ~Cooked in a round pan and arranged plums in fan/spiral. 1/2 plum in middle for aesthetics. It looks beautiful!

Used 6 plums cut in 1/8's and it was perfect. Followed recips exactly and found plum to cake ratio good. However, find it better to eat day one as it gets soggy when a leftover. Otherwise, this is a keeper.

Love, love love this recipe! I used 9 plums instead of 5. Baked it in a 15 x 10 glass casserole dish and the cake was still kinda thick, so next time I want to try using a larger metal jelly roll pan and even more plums. Liked the vanilla and almond extracts and also used Italian Cream extract/flavoring as well. Used light sour cream to cut calories and it still tasted very rich & yummy. Dusted with cinn-sugar followed by conf. sugar. It tastes like a cross between cheesecake & coffeecake...delicous texture!

Delicious, pretty, and easy. Two thoughts: 1) double the almond extract for more pronounced almond flavor and don't make it in a smaller pan. I did and the cake:plum ratio favored cake too much.

This has more spices than I remember having in Germany. I followed other reviewers suggestions and used extra sugar and butter on top. It turned out sweet and moist. I don't think you can have too many plums. Unless the plums are really large, I don't think 5 is enough.

This cake was delicious. I received rave reviews. In order to maximize the flavor of this cake consider doing the following: 1. Use Plugra butter or another European butter. It has less water content than typical butter from US grocery stores. 2. Add two rounded Tablespoons of sour cream to the batter to add to the density and moistness. 3. Add one tsp of Cardamom to the dry ingredients. 4. Lightly dust the cake with powdered sugar just before serving. With these slight changes, the cake turned out perfectly.

As others have said, it's a very simple cake. Being in France, I made it with creme fraiche instead of sour cream, and ground cardamom instead of cinnamon. It was fine, but not better. Again as others have said, the more the fruit the better - I thought I had put loads more in than the recipe required, but it was barely enough. I should have put more cardamom as well.

Very good cake. We enjoy the tart/sweet balance. My father-in-law, who is from Germany and a great dessert man, loves it. I replace the ground cinnamon with ground cinnamon and ground cardamom in equal measure.

Very good. To make it even better (and more traditional) add streusel topping and cook the cake layer for 10 minutes at 350 first, before adding the plums and topping. I like to chop the plums coarsely in the food processor - makes it easier to cut the cake into neat pieces.

Quite different than my grandmother's, but great in its own light. Her dough, if I remember correctly was more dense... Oh. Make sure the plums aren't too ripe. Mine were and they made the cake soggy. I'm sure small Damsen plums make a big difference.

I have lived for several years in Vienna Austria and this is the closest recipe I have found to the Kuchen we can get here. I like to use the Italian plums and I use whole wheat pastry flour rather than all purpose which gives it a richer, nuttier flavor.

I loved this cake. I cut down on the cinnamon just a bit. Regular, ripe plums are much better than Italian (prune) plums and give the cake a wonderful moist crumb and tartness. When the batter rises above the fruit, the finished cake looks great. I like it as is, but a bit of confectioners sugar sprinkled on the top, will add the sweetness and festive appearance that some people may prefer.

This was pretty good, but I would add more plums. Since others hinted that the cake needed sweetening, I made a crumble topping for it and it was really good, Served with sweetened whipped cream.

My husband is from Germany and was anticipating this kuchen tremendously. He was a little disappointed though when he found there was no streusel on top. To those who wanted more of a dessert than a snack cake try making a streusel for the top. Or sprinkle the top with powdered sugar.

I agree completely with the cook who said this was nothing special. I used tart damson plums and the fruit was spectacular but the mediocrity of the cake detracted from the dessert. The cake was very light and feathery. I like cakes in this style but I've had better. I'd look for a slightly denser, moister cake.

This recipe turned out, but its boring. Pleasant but boring. I might make it again if I had extra plums and it would certainly be eaten but this recipe is in no way exceptional

i have been making this for many years and it is a much anticipated treat for my kids. They start asking in July if it is time for Prune Plums yet. I make as many cakes as i can get plums for and give them to everyone I know. It is now an end of summer tradition for all of us.

This was really good! I made it and took it to work and everyone loved it. The cake is very moist and the fruit really makes it nice. I will make this again and will try it with other fruits!

Very good and easy. Cake part is moist, plums are tangy. Agree that a little sweetened whipped cream is a nice addition.

I have made this several times and loved it every time. My husband, who does not have a sweet tooth like myself, loves this cake and even asks for it each summer.Make sure to use the unsalted butter as this is what gives the cake its truly European flavour.

I've just made this cake for the second time and it's almost gone. It makes a great breakfast or after school treat - not too sweet. I use a commercial cinnamon sugar for the top that also has cardamom in it. This one is easy and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.

I was looking for a kuchen recipe that uses nectarines,and came across this one. So I substituted two ripe nectarines in place of the plums-it was delicious! One of the best and easiest cake recipes I've ever made. I will definately make it again.

A delicious, not-too-sweet European style coffee cake that is best "mit schlag" or a dollop of lightly sweetened whipped cream to offset the tartness of the plums. Serve with coffee. I used about 10-12 Italian prune plums, quartered. Don't skimp on the fruit.
