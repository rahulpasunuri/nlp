This is a great pie but it is a lot of work. Probably best to make the praline ahead. The crust is easier to work with by using 1.5x crust ingredients. I use a spray bottle when making pie crust. Spray a little water, flip to get dry ingredients on top, spray, repeat. Mix gently with fork when nearly all dry ingredients are just moist. Too dry = cracking when rolling. Too wet = hard, not flaky crust. I usually do not chill pie dough prior to rolling. Freezing the crust in a side-by-side freezer is a challenge. I find the toughest part of this recipe is in keeping the crust from sliding down the side of the pie plate when baking. If this happens, I take it out of the oven and push it back up with a fork. Using a very hot oven (500 degrees) to start seems to help firm up the crust, but temperature must be reduced to avoid burning. Using fresh spices from a co-op or other good source always makes a difference for the filling. A 10 diameter pan seems to work well.

First, let me emphasize I did not make the recipe as written, because making praline just to grind it up seemed a huge effort, especially when I had to make everything else for Thanksgiving dinner. However, this makes a wonderfully dense, silky pumpkin custard. I increased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup, omitted the praline, used 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tablespoon bourbon. It didn't need the cornstarch. I baked it until gently set, i.e., just slightly jiggly in the center. I also used the wonderful vodka piecrust recipe from Cooks Illustrated (vodka does not trigger gluten formation, so you get a malleable crust that's still tender).

My guests in the Thankgiving dinner loved the addition of hazelnut praline in the pumpkin pie. It brings a new dimension on the otherwise very traditional taste of the pumpkin pie.

Yuck! Probably the worst pumpkin pie I have ever had. The Libby pumpkin pie recipe looks gourmet compared to the flavor of this one.

I was so exhausted cooking Thanksgiving dinner that I cheated on this one. As the recipe suggested, I made the hazelnut pralines and ground up half. I then used a frozen premade pie shell, canned pumpkin, and the recipe on the back of the pumpkin pan, except that I added the praline powder to the mix, and broke up the remaining pralines on top. Everyone seemed to like it alot. The powder give the pie a slightly caramel flavor (our brittle ended up really dark brown, yum!), and the hazelnuts gave it a slightly nutty texture. By the way, making the pralines was so much fun that we are going to put them in tins and give as holiday gifts.

I used my own crust without pre-baking it and it was fine. I found the Praline recipe to be rather tasteless and not like any praline I have ever had. It was also extremely hard and didn't break up very easily. I had my husband take a hammer to it and the chunks were still very large. The pie filling was delicious. If I ever made this pie again, I would find another Praline recipe or use a commercially available praline.

My crust was a bit fragile, but I just added more flour and it baked up just fine. The filling was delicious... although making the praline, the crust, the filling and the whipped topping was alot of work. I did not like the "tang" the vinegar added to the crust despite it being really flaky. The filling tasted great, but I don't think I would go through all the work to make this pie again.

I had the same problem with the crust as everyone else. It didn't stay together. I actually had to press it together and it then it cracked. I would use another recipe for the crust

This recipe sounds great, but the crust didn't work. The sides of it collapsed as I was precooking! I made the filling and used my own pie crust recipe.

I made the praline first, and it was very delicious, however the crust was a disaster. I didn't add all the water/cider vinegar because it already looked moist, and when i went to roll it, the crust was not held together at all. Because of the crust, I didn't made the filling...
