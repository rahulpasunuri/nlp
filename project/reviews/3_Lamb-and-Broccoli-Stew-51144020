I agree, too salty. Tasty recipe for lamb but I will try without the brine next time.

This recipe is so unhealthy, it's off the chart. It's so crammed with sodium, so high in cholesterol many people couldn't tolerate it, the rest shouldn't. Idiotically, the writers call for "3/4 cup of sodium plus" then advise the use of low-sodium broth. They also call for eggs, further boosting the cholesterol. In addition, there is so much oil, it loads up fat content. If a person wanted a stew of lamb and broccoli, they would be better off sauteing the broccoli and garlic in low-sodium broth and forget the above ingredients which are so unhealthy-- for the sake of a recipe that is really not worth it.

Delicious combination of flavours....very salty. We may try to brine it differently less time.
