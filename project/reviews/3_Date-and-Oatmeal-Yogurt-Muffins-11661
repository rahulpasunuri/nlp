Two words - dough gobs When I make muffins, I want a cake-like consistency featuring the star ingredients. These were little dense doughy gobs - a little bit better than eating raw dough. There are better healthy oatmeal muffin recipes out there.

I gave it four forks for taste, ease AND healthfulness. I made it with lowfat vanilla yogurt, 1% milk, and half whole wheat flour and ended up with 8 muffins with a total of only 2 Tbs. of butter. Yet it was moist and rich. Downed two of them right out of the oven and two more the next day for breakfast. You can use more nuts and more dates than called for, which I did.

I have been baking these since 2003. I have used apples in stead of dates yogurt cheese instead of plain yogurt. I use whole wheat flour and omit salt and add walnuts. Anyway I make these they come out moist. One secret, I use ceramic heart shaped muffin pans love them never burn any muffins I make.

Very good! I substituted steel cut oats for the rolled and 1/4 c whole wheat flour, and I about doubled the dates. I also added about a 1/2 tb flax seed, and substituted Brummel & Brown yogurt spread for the butter. I used Stonyfield plain yogurt. I only baked them for 20 minutes, but they are perfect and moist straight out of the oven. I'm on my 4th (mini) muffin now!

These muffins were wonderful but I added about one cup of diced apple and 1/2 cup dried fruit (a blend of golden raisins, cranberries, cherries and blueberries from Trader Joe's). I used turbinado sugar in place of the brown sugar. Also pumped up the cinnamon and put chopped pecans on top. Baked for 22 minutes and they had a very nice crumb!

Excellent (when altered a bit.) Recipe needs a boost. 1/8 tsp cinnamon just not enough to spice up this whole batch of muffins. I used: vanilla yogurt, whole wheat flour; I added: 4oz applesauce for moistness, 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 1/3 cup craisins. Bake 22 mins, reduce oven temp for dark pan. Produces 12 nice, moist, dense, lowfat muffins. Freeze individually. Toss in whatever you like, (but your kids don't) finely chopped. It almost disappears in the batter.

I made several changes. Used whole weat flour, no butter, added 2 tablespoons more yogurt. Used apples instead of nuts. It is a good recipe to experiment with. needs still some changes though. liked the texture. might add some apple juice concentrate for more sweetness.

I used a Greek yoghurt with a higher than normal fat content but the muffins still had the texture of cardboard, especially once they had cooled down completely. There have to be better low fat muffins out there!

This recipe produces a dense, tough muffin with zero crumb. There are better low-fat muffin recipes out there. However, if I were to give this recipe a second try, I would probably pour the batter into a loaf pan and serve it as a bread instead.

Forgot to add that you should watch these babies in the oven - they were done after 20 minutes and I probably should have taken them out sooner.

I used whole wheat flour to replace the white flour and I should have gone half and half. They were a bit *too* healthy. I think I'll throw a bit more butter in next time because they were a little dry. I didn't have walnuts or dates so I used raisins which turned out well. This seems to be a great low fat and healthy muffin mix though - good for experimenting!

I omitted the dry fruit (I didn't have it) and upped the walnuts. Served hot out of the oven, with fresh fruit and coffee, this recipe was easy yet special. Everyone agreed it was a hit!

i really liked the texture of this muffin, but after reading the reviews, i too made modifications. i used whole wheat flour for half of the flour called for. i decreased the salt by about 1/4 tsp, but still found the muffins to be overly salty (the butter i used was unsalted). next time i'll decrease the salt even more and bump up the brown sugar by a tbls or two. i also added a couple tbls of flax seed for added crunch and nutrition. i baked these for about 22 mins instead of 30 mins and they turned out nice and moist. i'll definitely try these again w/ more changes (maybe a little flaked coconut too...). this is a good base for a healthy muffin recipe.

These muffins were excellent. We substituted raisins for the walnuts, but only because our 3 year old will not eat nuts. But she loves oatmeal and dates so these were perfect muffins for her (and for us)!

Not bad with a few substitutions: More yogurt, no butter. Chopped apple and figs instead of nuts and dates. I'll try them next time with whole wheat flour - they're just a little too 'white' for me.

Recipe changers annoy me. Anyway, liked it but had to add more yogurt, added craisanettes, reduced milk and butter, added pumpkin to make up. Added zest of 2 oranges to dry. Exchanged pecans for nut. Best pumpkin muffin I've had. Bit on the dry side.

These are a great low fat muffin; they can be made with nonfat sour cream as well with excellent results, and other add-ins such as raisins or craisins.

I don't know if it's our high altitude or overmixing, but I got hockey pucks! I'll give this another shot some day....

This recipe was so good. Yes, the batter (before baking) was a bit salty, BUT this lessened after the muffins were baked. The salt is needed to balance the sweetness in the dates and to bring out the flavor of the nuts. Also, if you use salted butter, use less salt and a pinch less leavening and it should all work. Also, the muffins do not rise much, so you can overfill the tins. I filled them almost full and it made 8 muffins. More for later!-YUM

nice taste; moist; low in fat.

Not very exciting. Perhaps because I used nonfat yogurt and milk, they were dry.

I really liked this recipe. I used Mango Yoghurt as this is all I had. I felt it enhanced the flavour of the muffins. I also used self raising flour to make them bigger. Actually the taste of these muffins was like eating a slice of Nut Loaf. I heated them and then buttered. Delicious

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times. I have used raisins instead of the dates, with good results. I've also used blueberries, which was wonderful! For a little variety, try different flavors of yogurt (lemon, peach), and other "add-ins"

I used Iranian honey dates. Scrumptious!
