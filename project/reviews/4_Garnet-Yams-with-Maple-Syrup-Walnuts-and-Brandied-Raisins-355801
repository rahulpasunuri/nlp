Magnificent. Absolutely delicious and decadent.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my guests had favorable comments but I found it overly sweet. Next time I will reduce the quantity of maple syrup and brown sugar by half and consider adding lemon zest and ginger as another reviewer suggested.

This recipe has become a tradition. My family and friends simply cannot have it too often. I make no changes to the original. It is stupendous. Note i have used many kinds of Yams.....all work just fine.

I make this every Thanksgiving, and it's always a hit. I like spiced rum for the raisins, and add some lemon zest and ginger to the glaze to brighten it.

One more thing, I used pecans instead of walnuts as others suggested.

This is easy to make and delicious. I did a test run (2 weeks before Thanksgiving) and my husband and I loved it. I made a minor change with great results. I used all golden raisins because I prefer golden to dark when it comes to cooking. I soaked them in Courvoisier. I lined the casserol dish with foil which made easy cleanup. All in all this recipe is wonderful and a keeper.

Since it was in the 90's the day I prepared this dish, the thought of turning on the oven made me sweat. I cut the recipe to 1/4 of the original (2 potatoes) then boiled the sweet potatoes until tender but not mushy. I then tossed them into the saucepan with the syrup mixture until glazed, adding the nuts, raisins and remaining brandy at the very end. Fast and yummy--perfect summer go-with for pork or chicken.

This recipe is delicious and easy to make. I love the brandy soaked raisins, they add such a delicious flavor. This was a "hit" for all of my guests too.

While I was the only one to eat this side dish at Thanksgiving, I would still make it again. The result was a wonderful version of what to do with yams. I easily found garnet yams at the supermarket and I chose two rather large ones for the recipe. In the end, I only used one yam and have yet to figure out what to do with the other. Instead of walnuts, I felt the dish would be better with pecans. I was right. I also substituted dried cranberries for the raisins, which was brilliant. The leftover cranberry-brandy I used as an apertif one evening. Delicious.

Great recipe! Very ease to make. I used pecans insted of walnut and tequila insted of brandy, the result: Excellent. My friends are already asking for the recipe. I think next time I make it, I will use a little bit less of the maple syrup and sugar.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was great, didn't have brandy so used Grand Marnier instead as someone suggested.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year, and I'll be doing it again this year - really great recipe that was a hit with the crowd. I soaked the raisins in rum instead of brandy (all I had on hand), and it was still great.

This is delicious recipe. It is sweet, but not overpowering, and both simple and fast to make. I soaked the raisins overnight in the brandy, and used pecans instead of walnuts, because that is what we had on hand. Beware of boiling the sweet potatoes too long; while the dish still has a wonderful flavor, it gets a little mushy.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was awesome! I personally don't like walnuts so I made it with pecans, and used a tiny bit less of the pure maple syrup because I was afraid it would be too sweet. I also used regular sweet potatoes. All in all these were a huge hit and I would definitely make them again!

Made this for Thansksgiving. What a hit. I did make some changes, I couldn't get Garnet yams, used the old standard and used Grand Marnier rather than Brandy for soaking the raisins. Both substitutions were fine. We love sweet potatoes and I will make this again.

Wow, this was soooo good! My mom's allergic to walnuts, so I substituted pecans. Fabulous!

Very tasty. The flavors all work well together, although I suspect the brandy would not be missed, and it's sweet without being cloying. I added a light sprinkling of salt, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. I used the garnet yams as specified and liked both their flavor and the fact that they didn't get mushy and fall apart. This may make a reappearance accompanying ham at my Christmas Eve dinner.
