my suggestion if you want chocolate with your creme brulee is to cover the bottom of the ramekin with a thin layer of mini chocolate chips. They melt and form a semi soft layer of chocolate which is a nice surprise and not too overpowering--and easy. This is how I always make my creme brulee and all love it. Don't do it with regular size chips because they do not melt.

I found that the cooking times on this recipe were a bit off for my oven. When cooking the chocolate layer for the full amount of time, it came out too solid and dry. The second time I took about 5 minutes of each cooking time and it came out OK, althought I don't exactly know what a REAL creme brulee is supposed to be like. Also, the second time around I strained things through a cheese cloth as well as a seive to give it an extra silky texture.

I disagree with the others - this is a FANTASTIC dessert. Crowds of all types rage over it. This dessert is great paired with a full-bodied red wine.

The vanilla portion was good, but the chocolate was too over-powering, even my chocolate-fanatic husband didn't care for it. I followed the recipe and it set nicely, but I wouldn't make it again. There are much better creme brulee recipes out there than wasting time on this one.

The texture wasn't exactly like creme brulee and the flavor was primarily chocolate due to the marbling (vanilla didn't "float" on top but rather mixed with the chocolate. Perhaps if less of the vanilla was used to make the chocolate or if the chocolate was made further in advance and allowed to fully set...

I made this twice, wrongly assuming that I had done something wrong the first time. The chocolate was too strong-- it overpowered and was two rich. I cooked them longer than the recipe said, but they still came out a little soupy and undercooked.

I tried this recipe (per others' suggestions) with only the vanilla portion. The resulting vanilla creme brulee was absolutely marvelous- a 4-forker! It received rave reviews from all my guests (and me). Omitting the chocolate bits cut the prep and cook time in half, making it very easy to prepare. The only reason I didn't give the whole recipe four forks is because I only used the vanilla half of it.

First time creme brulee attempt. Flavor was excellent and our company enjoyed it, but the texture were all wrong. I followed the cooking times in the recipe exactly, which may have been the problem, overcooked! I too achieved a marbled effect rather than a layered effect, so the chocolate was no surprise. I'll try another recipe next time.

I made this recipe for guests after the museum and dinner out. It was excellent! It was very easy and I had all of the ingredients necessary in the pantry. I recommend Vahlrona chocolate. What I liked best is it can be done ahead and broiled at the last minute. I topped with fanned strawberries. It got rave reviews from guests. Unique, easy AND delicious. What more could you ask for?

This recipe is not bad but the chocolate overpowers the flavor of a true creme brulee. It was a good experiment but we prefer the traditional recipe.

Although the layer of chocolate was a suprise to my guests, most of us did not care for it...not sweet enough. I would not make again, the are lots better recipes out there.

I cut the recipe in half and mine ended up more of a marbled effect. Overall taste.....excellent!A very easy recipe to impress your guest!

Made the "white" half of this only due to time constraints, but was told this was hands down the best creme brulee my guest had ever tasted. I had to agree. :-) Had to be the cute little vanilla beans.

I love chocolate and creme brulee os had to try this. Loved it - but it took so much time that I would only make it for special occassions.

We loved it but I would do a few things differently next time. I thought the chocolate layer needed to be sweeter and I used 1 tsp. of vanilla paste instead of a real vanilla bean and I will increase this amount by at least 1/2 a teaspoon next time.

We loved this creme brulee recipe. In general, I prefer the standard, plain custard version of creme brulee, but I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely this recipe was. I used Valrhona semisweet chocolate, which gave the custard a smooth texture, not overly sweet flavor. I, too, prefer to use a brown sugar for the top, as the refined white sugar tends to retain a raw flavor, particularly when using a torch to burn it.

I was not pleased with the chocolate layer at all. I would make it again, but without the chocolate. It just tasted too bitter.

This was a delicious dessert - and easy to make. I was surprised by how dense the chocolate layer (made with bittersweet chocolate) was but it didn't detract from the overall effect. Everyone was surprised to find the chocolate later hiding under there - and pleased.

I have made this the way the recipe suggests, as well as omitting the chocolate and cooking it for 35-40 minutes as a traditional creme brulee. You can get away with the broiler instead of a kitchen torch, but turbinado (raw) sugar for the topping is really much better than the refined sugar suggested in the recipe. With that one change, the recipe is excellent both with and without the chocolate. However, it is far less work without the chocolate, and just as good.

Everyone raved about this dish. I let the chocolate be a surprise! The guests were delighted to find chocolate at the bottom of the custard. Serve with fresh strawberries or raspberries. I too use a kitchen torch - much better results than using a broiler.

I've made this dish many times and it is one of my favorite desserts for dinner guests. I think the chocolate is a nice surprise.

This is a nice little dessert dish, but the appeal of creme brulee is largely in its subtlety, and it doesn't really lend itself to this type of jazzing up. The chocolate and the caramelized sugar get in the way of each other, which definitely detracts. I much prefer the simpler traditional version, and will stick with that from now on.

Wonderful stuff. As a "hens night out" sweetie this went over VERY well. I think next time I will try making it without the chocolate or with orange zest instead of vanilla bean...This recipie is a keeper.

I tried to lower the fat content by using fat-free half and half for the cream and egg substitute for the egg yolks. All I can say is that it was ok but didn't taste like creme brulee, so if you're going to make this....stick with the real thing. I'm sure it tastes better.

This was great... i'm not one to alter a classic, but everyone we served it to New Year's Day just loved it. PLUS.. i got to use my new toy, a little "pencil torch" that I got from our local hardware store--- I was tickled to death to get for $15.99 what all the "gourmet stores" are touting for $40 and $50!

A wonderful recipe. I often omit the chocolate portion and make simply the vanilla portion.

I made this brulee for a Mystery Dinner Party...more people were interested in getting the recipe than "who done it"! I served with fresh raspberries and mint leaf decorations on top.

Excellent recipe. A torch is much better than the broiler. You can omit the chocolate, and cook the custard longer for a regular vanilla custard. I have also added lemon juice for a delicious twist.

A delicious recipe - though not what we expected. The chocolate layer came out more like a mousse than creme brulee - but it still tasted wonderful - light, creamy and romantic.
