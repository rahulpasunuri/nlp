Churrasco is the typical dish of Rio Grande do Sul, in southern Brazil. The traditional version is seasoned only with coarse salt. The secret is to cook the meat slowly in skewers, about 12in away from the coals (yup, churrasco takes a long time to get done). The best cut for churrasco is "picanha", which is just sirloin cap. Serve it medium-rare or rare. If the pieces of meat are too large, they can be sliced from the outside and the skewer returned to the fire. Served traditionally with potato salad, tomato and onion vinagrette and manioc flour.

Churrasco is almost always skirt or flank steak and is always marinated in a citrus-based mojo or other marinade to help tenderize it. Cuban bitter orange, lemon, or lime juices actually "cook" the meat so eight hours in the marinade is plenty. Traditionally, churrasco in many countries is served with a chimichurri sauce. Don't know why the above is called Churrasco, but it does sound good anyway.

This recipe might even taste ok, but it is NOT, by any means, real churrasco.
