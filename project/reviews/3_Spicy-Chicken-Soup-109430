The soup was terrific -- I used canned Thai chicken broth to save time, instead of making the chicken stock from scratch. One tip: I only used 1-1/2 tsp of the Thai chile powder and the soup was almost too spicy for my taste. Next time I'll use only 1 tsp, or less.

A good, basic Thai chicken soup recipe. You could add tomatoes, noodles, bean sprouts etc. for a little bulk. Be careful not to put too much of the soy and fish sauces in or it becomes too salty. Overall, delicious and can be used a base for many variants.

I add. 1 tbls Blair's after death sauce, it gave it great kick-up.

I simplified it by using regular chicken broth and store bought red chili paste - it was great!!
