I wasn't a big fan of this, it seemed that the balsamic vinegar imparted too much of a sharp taste for me. I agree with other reviewers however that 1/2 cup of oil is more than enough for an even roasting with no soggy vegetables.

This is one that I will make again for sure. Very flavorful. I'm usually not a fan of roasted vegetable, but I find using less oil and roasting just a bit longer than recommended improves the texture.

Delicious! I used a LOT more basil than is called for here...like probably 1/4 cup. Also diced up some tempeh and added that in. These veggies are great on their own, but right now I've got them stuffed into quesadillas! :D

This is my go-to recipe for roast veggies. I omit the fresh basil since most of the time I'm using winter veg (squash, brussels, roots) and it's not in season. The flavors are excellent. Don't skimp on the garlic. It may sound like a lot, but has the loveliest flavor roasted.

Delicious and easy. Will definitely make this again.

The flavor of eggplant ranges from bland to bad. This recipe did very little to change that. Eggplant is not a blank canvas upon which masterpieces are created; it's a weak foundation difficult to build upon. With any other color of skin, eggplant would be ignored as a vegetable. if you've read this far, you probably already own an eggplant. My condolences....;

Outstanding recipe - EXCEPT, 1/2 c. oil is WAY TOO MUCH, the veggies come out sopped with oil. Use 1/4 c. or less for just a light coat of oil on the veggies, they will roast perfectly. I would also recommend using slightly more vinegar and mustard.

Quite possibly the most refreshing recipe for eggplant I've ever used. Instead of spreading veggies out on baking sheets, I opted for one large aluminum lasagna tin covering with foil, piling all the veggies in to absorb that red onion goodness with the tang of balsamic. I'm typically not a squash lover, but the flavor was so zesty and fresh with a nice clean finish. I used 2-3 more cloves are garlic, more than doubled the basil, added more thyme resulting in equal parts, and added 1 tsp freshly ground horseradish - I also added a bit more EVOO. Because I cooked them all in one bin, I added 10 minutes to cooking time, but stirred veggies after the initial 35. Next time I think I'll throw in some chicken-style seitan!

This is very good. I reduced the oil to about 2-3 Tbsp and added about 3 Tbsp of white balsamic vinegar with the dark balsamic. I also added a splash of lemon juice to help keep the salt to a minimum. Lovely to look at and perfectly delicious! This makes a lot of yummy veggies!

This was very good. I added mushrooms which was a great addition. I cooked it in a convenction oven and it took longer thatn the 35 minutes. I served this at a family cookout and everyone loved it. It was good to hvae something cook inside while I was grilling out side.

I hate to be the naysayer, but my husband refused to eat it. The children said it was o.k., and I thought it was o.k. I cooked at a slightly lower temp as I had to go to the train to pick him up, but in all, I don't think that would have made much of a difference. The veggies were certainly done, and were not black as others had complained.

Wow! I found a new way to enjoy all these great veggies from the farmers market! I used only a couple of tbsp of olive oil and that was plenty for the dish. I really enjoyed how all the flavors blended together, will definitely make again.

This was fantastic. Usually I only roast the veggies with oil, salt and pepper but this mixture was great. I was not religious about using specific amounts of the vegetables, my garden is giving me zukes, eggplant, peppers and onions right now and just threw them together. I can hardly wait to make this for my vegan son. I served it with the Rice with Fennel and Golden Raisins on this site and it was perfect.

This was very yummy! I added a few Tablespoons of the mustard, and used a whole-grain kind. I like to put these vegetables over toast with mozzarella cheese. Great as a panini too!

Loved it! Changed the following: used 2 TBLSP Dijon mustard, 4 TBLSP Balsamic vinegar, added a packet of Equal sweetener,added asparagus and mushrooms, cut cooking time to 20-25 minutes. Prepared it for a dinner party and it got rave reviews from everyone!

I made this for a large dinner party and everyone loved it. I added tablespoon of Dijob instead of just 1 tsp.

I thought these were just ok as a side dish. They weren't that different from any other roasted vegetable recipe. But the next day I made vegie sandwiches with fresh mozzarella and harissa mayonnaise and they were amazing. I am making them again this week just for sandwiches.

Colorful and good flavor, but 35 minutes is way too long. I took them out after 30 minutes and veggies were already mush, especially the squash and eggplant. Next time I will double the sauce, halve the oil and check it every 5 minutes, so the veggies are still a little crisp.

Deelish, but I think you could use less oil.. I used less than half what it called for, and next time I'll use even less. Also, I used a bit more vinegar than called for, and I think next time I'll use even more.

Hard to go wrong with roasted veges. I made this for Thanksgiving using brussel sprouts, wedges of purple onion, baby carrots, yellow patty pans, red pepper and fennel. Very colorful and delish.

Big success! Made it for Thanksgiving side dish. Didn't make any changes to original, except that I used small, yellow little squashes which require slightly more time to cook. Everyone loved it!

Great vegetable recipe and would be perfect for serving to company. Once the veggies are in the dressing or on the baking sheet there's no work until you put them in a serving dish. This is really a recipe for 8+ as a side dish.

I got to kisses from the wife on this one. I've also experimented with this dish by adding chopped up shrimp and put it under the broiler at 400 for 6 minutes. Got the same effect in less time then roasting. But be careful it will burn if you don't keep a close eye on it.

Wow.... what a flavorful dish! To decrease the fat content and increase flavor, I used 1/4 cup olive oil and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar. I also doubled the amount of fresh basil and used a grainy, "strong" dijon mustard. The texture is perfect, and the flavor/aroma/color palette is exceptional!

I thought this was OK. I could have doubled the amount of fresh thyme and basil to add more flavor.

This was very easy to make and tasted fabulous. We will definitely have it often. Great with grilled meat.

I roasted the vegetables for 35 minutes and they came out blackened and unappealing. Taste was great bur I would roast "till slightly browned around the edges", much less than 35 min.

Delicious! I made the dressing a day ahead and let the flavors blend overnight. A very easy dish to make (except for all the chopping) and the aroma is mouthwatering. I also cooked it on a grillpan over charcoal and got raves. Great summer dish.

Love it! The aroma from the oven is fantastic! Along with a good bottle of merlot, it was the perfect meal.

Simple, easy, and fabulous. I made this as part of a dinner for my mother's 60th b- day. Everyone raved and it was so easy and took very little time to do. My mom, aunt and grandma have all asked me to email this recipe to them.
