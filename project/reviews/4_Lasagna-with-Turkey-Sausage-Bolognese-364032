My 1st lasagna created ever and I made this for a NYE potuck and it was good. Everyone at the party liked it better than me. I however loved it the following afternoon cold. I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: (1)I didn't have means to crush the fennel (mortar/pestle etc), so I put it in a mini-food processor and was able to pulverize some seeds, but not others. It worked in a pinch, but will invest in a crushing tool :) next time. (2) It said to cook the sauce until thickened, I like lasagna that isn't too runny, so I cooked it down to the perfect consistency (~20min), but when it baked I thought it was a little drier (though everyone thought this was a good thing, I would have liked a hint more sauciness) (3) I added about 3/4-1tsp red pepper flakes (Though I debated mixing sweet and hot turkey sausage because I thought all hot + the pepper flakes would be too much, I left it all spicy turkey sausage and the flakes. My long-time lasagna loving husband thought this was a great addtion. My gf thought it wasn't a kids dish due to the spice, but my 4yo loved it cold the next day with milk, so palate depending on spiciness.

I made this lasagna for a cozy Christmas Eve dinner, and it was fantastic. My only deviation from the recipe was to use sweet italian turkey sausage instead of spicy. This will be my go-to lasagna recipe from now on!

This was excellent! I followed it all the way through but added a little red pepper flakes like others did. I did find there was more cheese mixture then it needed so I didn't use all of it but it was delicious.

SO GOOD! No problems with the spice level, though this may be due to the brand I used (Jennie-O). I did up the amount of garlic in it (six cloves instead of 3) but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter.

My entire family loved this! Including 3 kids! I did use suggestion and added red pepper flakes to sauce but otherwise cooked as written. Next time I am going to make 2....one for the freezer.

As with any lasagna, this requires a lot of prep work, but it was worth it. I added more garlic and used spicy italian pork sausage and it was great. There was not enough heat in it for me, so next time I'll add crushed red peppers. Delicious recipe though!!!

Excellent lasagna...just the right amount of sauce,cheese and meat....you can "spice it up a bit" with extra red chili flakes and seasonings..but is pretty darn good as is !!! Will make it for the third time next week when the kids come to visit...freezes well uncooked,too!

Guests raved about it! I used pork instead of turkey sausage. Good, basic, yet tasty lasagna for any occasion.

I thought this lasagna was excellent. I will make it many times in the future.

Didn't think the extra steps (and effort) were worth the final product. I felt it needed more sauce as it seemed a tad dried out. It was good, but not something that will replace or even come close to my plain old comfort food lasagna. Sorry!

Meant to click on 4 forks below! I liked my previous lasagna recipe, but this new one is definitely worth all 4 forks!

This now my new "go to" lasagna recipe! Delicious and even better the next day. The fennel seeds in the sauce and the fresh basil in the cheese mixture added great depth to the flavors. My family and some visiting college student friends all loved this lasagna!

I generally really like the recipes from Bon Appetit magazine. This is one case where I was disappointed. I followed the recipe and each of the parts seemed fine on their own. Yet, the finished product lacked a depth of flavor. Although I bought the turkey sausage from a trusted butcher I am thinking maybe the sausage was too bland or lacked enough spice to make this special.

I made the sauce the night before and am glad I did -- this is a very time- consuming dish to make, as is any lasagna recipe. That said, it is not unlike any red-sauced lasagna you've ever had. Very chunky with vegies and I added spinach. I don't know if I'd make this again -- good but not great.

Wow! A new standard dish for our family! The kids loved it....whew! Sometimes turkey lasagna can be icky tasting, but this is just lovely. The flavors are so well balanced. And if you can make ahead the tomato sauce & cheese, then putting it together is a snap! Bravo! (And yes, I upped the garlic, but other than that stayed to the recipe)

Great recipe! I followed the recipe exactly with one exception as my husband is not crazy about the taste of fennel. Definitely worth making again!

Fantastic! The fresh basil and oregano really add to this dish. ... They ran out of spicy turkey sausage at the store so I bought mild and added some chili flake to the sauce. I will definitely be making this again.

This was the best homemade lasagna I have ever made. I stuck to the recipe and will absolutely be making this again in the future.

I made this tonight and everyone raved about it. I found it quite easy to assemble: I made the sauce and the cheese earlier in the day and put it together before dinner. I will certainly make it again.

This is a wonderful recipe made exactly as written. It did take me a bit longer than 45 minutes to assemble it, but well-worth the effort. The sauce may seem like more than needed at first, but it is perfect, and makes for easy and equally delicious leftovers.

Delicious!! This was a great lasagna recipe. I followed the recipe with one exception - mixed mild and hot sausage for a little more bite. The fennel was a great addition. Will be adding this to my 'go to' recipes!
