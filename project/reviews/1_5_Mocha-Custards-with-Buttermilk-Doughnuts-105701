This recipe was TERRIBLE!! The doughnut dough was VERY sticky - I had to use a lot more flour than the recipe called for and the custards were even worse!! Covering them before baking made them boil over into the water bath. I would NEVER make this again. It was costly and not worth the effort!! Not to mention, when I tried to get help from Bon Appetit - the customer service was useless!

Made the mocha custard, not the doughnuts. The custard was very good and not hard to make. Served in coffee cups (oven safe) with whipped cream and a chocolate espresso bean on top and Christmas cookies on the side.

Maybe it was just me, but this recipe was a disaster! It sounded great, but the doughnut batter was so soft and sticky it wouldn't roll out, and the custard was way too strong.
