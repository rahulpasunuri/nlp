According to the book "Ratio", we should use one part salt to 20 parts water. So in this case, a bit more than 3/4 cup salt to 16 cups of water.

Very salty, even when reduced salt by half. I used wild turkey and cooked it for 90 minutes, but would cook it for less time in the future. The flavor was good, but the saltiness was a bit overwhelming. Great with fresh parsley as a side.

As one other reviewer said, cut the salt by half and this works like a charm. Moist and delicious.

I used 4 turkey breasts that were on average 5 pounds each, and they were WAY too salty in the end. If you are using smaller breasts, be sure to reduce the salt by half, I would estimate.
