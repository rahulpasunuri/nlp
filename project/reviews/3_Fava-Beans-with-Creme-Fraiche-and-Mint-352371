I have made this and it was quite successful, I had no leftovers. I used frozen fava beans from the middle eastern grocery.

I love fava beans and thought this recipe was only so-so. Somehow the other flavors overwhelmed the delicate fava bean flavor. Perhaps it would be improved if less of everything other than the beans was used.

I really enjoyed this. I couldn't find fava beans but used frozen lima beans instead. I think I ended up adding more cream and used a hand blender to make them really creamy. They would be a great substitute for mashed potatoes and a lot better for you too!
