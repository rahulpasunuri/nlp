I have never made these before tonight. I have not even seen these in stores. But, I found them to be readily available. These were excellent with the steak dinner shown in the picture. We did use Filet Mignon however. They are almost like eating sugar they are so sweet. I had one guy who told me that "he isn't an onion guy." He loved them. We used nothing on them and just put them in a grill basket and cooked! Excellent!
