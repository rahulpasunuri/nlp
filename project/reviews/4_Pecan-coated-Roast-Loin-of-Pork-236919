This was an excellent comfort food in the middle of a cold, Michigan winter. You don't have to celebrate Kwanzaa to enjoy this meal. The dish is very flavorful and savory. The spices and textures of the nuts and meat really complement one another.

My first pork roast (usually do the pork tenderloin) and it was delicious. I liked how simple but flavorful it was. Also, it did not require a special trip to grocery store for all of the ingredients.

Fabulous! Literally the best pork rub/paste that I've ever prepared and eaten. And very easy to make. My entire home smelled like brown sugar!

I made this recipe for my husband and in-laws, and it was met with rave reviews. The pork was perfectly cooked to the time specified and had a different, yet delicious flavor. I served with homemade cranberry sauce, cinnamon apples and mashed potatoes. Delicious!
