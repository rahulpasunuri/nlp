I made this recipe and served them as lettuce wraps. Placed the grilled shrimp and green onions on a platter - added bowls of matchstick carrots, rice noodles, matchstick water chestnuts and the sauces. They were a great hit and very fun at our appetizer dinner party

There is way too much fish sauce in this recipe. Limit it to one Tbsp. Cut the coriander amount in half. If you use both lime juice and vinegar, double the sugar. The chili gets lost during grilling, so use crushed chilis instead. You only need 3-4 scallions. Add some sesame oil. Or simply start over with another recipe.

FANTASTIC grilled shrimp recipe. It's such a snap to prepare and SOOO flavourful. I made a double batch of the soy dipping sauce and diluted one half with a light oil to marinade tilapia. I saved some of the cumin seed mixture and sprinkled it on the tilapia too and it was also delicious. Served with edamame beans. The shrimp are also delicious served in a cauliflower red pepper chowder...
