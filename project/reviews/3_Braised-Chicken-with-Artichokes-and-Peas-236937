I liked this, but made a few changes: After adding peas, stir in 2 tsp. lemon juice, 1 tsp. zest, 2 tsp. minced garlic, 2 tsp. bacon bits. (I didn't have capers but wanted a little more salt.) Instead of transferring chicken to serving dish, lightly re-dredge in leftover flour and fry in seperate pan with a teaspoon of additional oil to re-crisp! THEN transfer chicken. Deglaze pan with additional 1/4 c. wine and additional water. Add to artichoke sauce. Serve with homemade pasta. NOW it's four forks!

Well, I am guessing if there were no tweeks it probably would have been a lot less flavorful but not awful. Using other reviews these are my tweeks. 1. Used a whole chicken cut up (b/c that is what I had). 2. Used 2 cans artichoke hearts (love them!) and added them 15 minutes into the process along with half a lemon sliced very thinly. 3. Used a tbsp of capers, rinsed with the peas. I think it would benefit from a little bit of good chopped bacon with the onions, not enough to add a ton of calories, just enough for some flavor depth. Artichoke bottoms would work in this recipe too. They would probably hold up better than the hearts. Might could also add a little parm to the flour dredge. Will def make again, using this as a base recipe.

I added about a teaspoon and a half of Dijon mustard plus lemom, as other suggested, when adding the broth. I served it all over noodles with butter and parsley. Easy and delicious!

This dish works well with the suggestions made by the other chefs for the chicken breasts, garlic, frozen artichokes and lemon. As the previous poster mentioned, I also thought the caper/pea combination was a bit strange, so I used prosciutto to add extra flavor as well as some red pepper flakes.

I thought perhaps I had prepared this dish less than perfectly because I found the flavors to be somewhat bland....but then I read reviews commenting on the blandness and I felt much better. I prepared this dish in a french oven....and made the mistake of doubling the recipe. The result was that I did not have the propper ratio of liquid to meat, etc., and had to double the liquid content. The result tasted like chicken soup. I would agree that the recipe would benefit from capers, but capers and peas seems like an odd combination? While I haven't tried it, I would be interested to see how this dish would be improved by including a celery/carrot "mash" immediately before the onion part, as well as the inclusion of lemon at some point in the process.

I make this dish using boneless, skinless breasts often-the chicken comes out moist and delicious every time. Its a great base recipe to play around with different vegetables and flavors!

really good with proposed changes: lemon or lemon zest and capers, definitely capers, along with garlic. served with broad noodles - an easy,inexpensive and lively dish for a casual company dinner.

Thanks to the inspired cook who suggested adding a thinly sliced lemon and some capers to this recipe, this is just stunning. The only change I made other than those hitherto mentioned was to dissolve a 2-cup chicken bouillon cube with half a cup of hot water in the place of the "reduced-sodium chicken broth". Oh, and I also added half a dozen thinly sliced garlic cloves with the onions. The end result is definitely coming to my next dinner party!

I used split chicken breasts and it came out great. I also added some garlic and capers. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. I will definately make this again.

This is an ideal recipe to make at the end of a busy day. Given the simplicity of preparation, it was actually quite good; however, I agree with the other cooks who judged it to be in need of a flavor boost. I used boneless, skinless chicken thighs (fat removed) and I used a box of frozen artichoke hearts (instead of canned). When I prepare this the next time, I will add a splash of fresh lemon juice, a pinch of lemon zest, fresh thyme, and garlic. I would actually consider serving it for a casual dinner party with brown rice pilaf including toasted pine nuts and a big green salad.

This was a great evening meal. Simple and delicious.

This was a satisfying and easy to prepare meal. I added four cloves of minced garlic with the onion, about two tablespoons of capers, and a meyer lemon sliced and seeded. This brightened up the dish and gave it a little needed zing. I would definitely make it again for a satisfying weeknight meal.

I thought this was pretty good for a weeknight meal. I removed all the skin from the thighs and browned them well and used 1/4 cup of white wine vinegar plus 3/4 cups of broth. Added garlic. Kept the rest the same.

I've made this twice... the first time I followed the recipe exactly and the second time I followed the advice of other reviewers. As written, the chicken is not only bland, it is far too mushy and the texture of the skin was slimy (using FRESH thighs, too). It wasn't terrible, but I felt like I wasted some of my favorite ingredients. The second time I used large, whole, skinned, deboned chicken breasts. I cooked the onion with two large cloves of chopped garlic. To the broth/wine I added some dried thyme cooked the chicken with the artichokes for about 20 minutes. The artichokes do not hold up well and almost break down entirely sitting that long in the simmering liquid. I added peas and capers towards the end, and that gave the chicken that little extra something that it was missing from before. The capers added a lot more salt to the meal (I rinsed them first) so I would adjust the added salt the next time I make it. The chicken was so tender and good that there wasn't a bite left.

I made this according to the recipe and agree with others who say it is too bland. Adding capers and garlic sounds like a good idea and I will try it again, with those additions. The chicken was very tender. Served it with polenta.

I am usually quite enthusiastic about the recipes on Epicurious, but this one was not so fabulous. I think something better can be found to do with chicken and artichokes.

Okay, but should have used a different cut of chicken. There was not much meat on the thighs and once I took off the skin it didn't have a lot of flavor. I did like the artichoke and pea combination.

This was just OK. It is a good way to cook chicken, i.e. brown and then simmer in broth/wine, but the other ingredients didn't add much, and the flavors didn't come together. In the end, what with scraping the skin off the chicken, I kind of ended up with an oily, mushy mess.

This was surprisingly good, given its simplicity. A hearty, warming supper for a cold evening. I put some shallots in with the onions for a bit more depth.

I thought this came out great. Cooked the chicken exactly as instructed and it was very tender. Used partially deboned skin on "airline" breasts as not too into dark meat. Added a few cloves of garlic but otherwise followed the recipe and it was first rate.

Nice combination of vegetables and chicken, but it needed some spiking in the flavor department. The artichoke/chicken combo suggested a pinch of cumin, some thyme, and a clove of garlic sauteed with the onion. And while we're at it, this is not a braise, it's a fricassee. That is, chicken pre-browned in butter or oil, then cooked 30 to 45 minutes in stock, a variety of vegetables and perhaps wine. Coq au vin and chicken chasseur are also fricassees.

This recipe was excellent and EZ. Next time I will try adding garlic as well for added flavor. I wouldn't have minded having more artichoke hearts too.

Very good and simple. Next time I will use boneless skinless thighs, I didn't like the texture of the skin, was rubbery even though I browned as directed.

This was an easy and quick dish, and delicious. After reading reviews, I added a Tbsp capers in with the peas, and I also added 3 smashed cloves of garlic, and when making this again I will keep these modifications.

Substituted split breasts!! Delish!! Pinch of salt, and some garlic helps.

I would give this 3 1/2 stars if I could but not 4. I think it needed some garlic or something to give it a little extra kick but in general it was quite good.

I served it with brown rice cooked in vegetable stock. My family loved it. Greazt new chicken dish to add to repertoire.

A delightfully quick and healthy dish. Not a showstopper, but a candidate for regular feeding for family and friends. I coated the chicken in corn starch (wheat allergies), and it turned out well. Throwing some rinsed capers in with the peas is a fun addition. Another substitution: frozen artichoke hearts for the canned. A lovely dish enjoyed by all, and worthy addition to the historic family recipe book.

Excellent! Like the other reviewer, I also used canned artichokes instead of frozen and used boneless skinless chicken thighs.

Just finished dinner- my husband rated it "restaurant quality" which means he would be willing to pay entree price at a better restaurant for this dish. I did make a few changes however. Took the skin off the thighs since we are trying to cut our fat intake, substituted a 9 oz box frozen artichokes for the canned, reduced the onion by half but added 2 large cloves crushed garlic and finally substituted one box frozen sugar snap peas for the baby peas (use what you have!). Served it with grilled polenta slices. We'll see who snags the leftovers for lunch tommorow!
