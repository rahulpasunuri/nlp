I will start with the bad news in that I agree with many of the other comments that this was not a recipe with huge flavor, although a heavier roast on the cauliflower may help. Almost similar flavor to potato soup. The good news is it was still pretty tasty. Add in the fact that I replaced cream with fat free half and half and replaced the butter with olive and truffle oil which made this a SUPER healthy meal. Tonight I am making it again with simple home made croutons and add a dash of crumbled bacon. A great way to sneak cruciferous vegatables into your (and family's) diet!

Totally just fine. Kinda yawn inspiring. Easy, and if you have a good knowledge of cooking, think you could add much to this.

Came back to update my earlier review with good news. This soup is MUCH more flavorful on the second day. Amazing really the difference- elevated to 3 forks. So plan to make this soup the day before you serve it and you'll be good to go.

I was disappointed with this recipe as it was a bit bland for my tastes. I suppose if I'd served it in the context of the original article (as a starter soup to a rich and flavorful pork dinner) it would have been acceptable but I attempted to serve it on its own as the main course. The recipe just cannot stand up to being the star of the show, even with additional salt and pepper to flavor.

Like everyone else, I made this my own - roasted the cauliflower and onions (big pieces) together, tossed in olive oil and salt, at 400 degrese for 30 minutes, turning once, which caramelized the vegetables. Simmered in water with only a little butter, pureed the mixture, reheated with salt & white pepper and whisked in 1/4 cup of half & half, no more butter. Sprinkled each bowl with fresh chives. Just awesome, filling and healthier (but not boring!).

i eliminated all butter, using just a bit of olive oil and roasting the cauliflower and onions at the same time in the oven. i also substituted fat-free half & half for the cream. i thought it turned out very well. i agree that the chive oil is not worth it, but i may try to make rosemary oil the next time.

Subtle, if not bland. Needs a significant amt of salt. Chive oil not worth the effort.

I roasted the cauliflower in chunks with Olive oil and salt, done that before and SO YUMMY just plain. Went with out chive oil and used about 3TBLS of butter in all and this soup was delicious!

This is just an observation (or 2). 12 tablespoons of butter + 3/4 cup oil for 8 servings???? Also - steam roasting the cauliflower for 1 1/2 hours in an oven, - not allowing it to brown for added flavour, or butter steaming the cauliflower in a pan for 20 minutes using the same amount of water (and maybe 1/2 the butter) - think of the saving in energy. I would not classify this as a 'practical recipe'

I loved the velvety texture of this soup, but it was not as flavorful as I had hoped. The chive oil created a beautiful color contrast, but I agree, did not add any flavor.

This soup is delicious even without cream and only one tsp of butter.I also used olive oil spray on the cauliflower before putting it in the oven.

I made this and served with wild mushroom and truffle grapeseed oil (which is green). I really liked it and I am making it again today. This time I am going to brown the cauliflower more in the oven to get a stronger roasted flavor. Last time I took it out when it was tender and the soup was good but didn't have the "depth of flavor" in the description.

There are better cauliflower soup recipes. Slow roasting the cauliflower was time-consuming and did not make a difference in flavor (as opposed to boiling). The chive oil made for a nice visual presentation but did not add any noticeable flavor.
