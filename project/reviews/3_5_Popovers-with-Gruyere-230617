I have never reviewed a recipe before, but felt compelled to do so here. After mom was watching a popular cooking show, she requested "Gruyère Popovers". I had never made a popover before, but wow, these were amazing! I halved the batch, which made 8, and made sure to heed the advice of other and pierce them immediately after coming out of the oven. I will make these a regular in my home, as they are perfect as they are. The texture is spot on, and there is no need for herbs/spices. Yum!!!

Top notch. The only thing that could improve this is if they were smaller- like little bites. They're very rich and I think they would be better served in a smaller quantity. The trick would be finding little muffin tins... or some substitute. Don't forget to poke some holes when they leave the over so they don't flatten.

Every year I prepare them for Oscar Night Party, and this year, 2012, my friends called to ask if I will make them again. Follow the recipe as written, use real Gruyere cheese and you will have people rave about them. As suggested for those who have "collapsed" if you slit them with a sharp knife as they come out of the oven, it will prevent their deflation. Make sure they are nice and brown.

This was VERY bland as written. I added fresh rosemary and dill with garlic and black pepper to give it some flavor. With the additions it was much better. While my guests liked it, I most likely will not make this again as I have several other options that require far fewer tweaks and proven results.

Seriously outstanding. Halved the recipe and substituted manchego. Beautifully golden, crispy cheese, rich flavor. Will make again and again.

The cheese topping was good. But the popovers deflated. I have since read other recipes for more tips on the perfect popover. Some I will try next include an initial higher temp and then lower. I will also do the slit as they come out of the oven to let out the steam.

I don't know...I made this twice and BOTH times, no pop!! Just dense flat muffins...that taste okay but a huge disappointment! BOO!! Any suggestions??

Easy, delicious, a hit with my dinner party. Can't ask for more. Make sure to grease the muffin pans well, otherwise you'll get a little annoyed.

I was so inspired by the popovers I first had at BLT Steak, I decide to by my first baking accessory: the popover pan (having never baked anything in my life). I made them for the first time tonight. I didn't have Gruyere so I substituted with parmesn cheese (freshly grated). They were absolutely perfect and huge when they came out of the oven. Tips: Fill each popover pan 3/4 of the way. Using this recipe, I was only able to make 8. I also used skim instead of whole milk and they were perfect. I also pierced a slit in each when they were done to release the trapped steam (to ensure they stay big and beautiful.

These 5 ingredients were all I had in my kitchen and I had never made popovers before... I wasn't even sure what they were and they came out AWESOME! I make half the recipe, in a 6-muffin tin, and they come out great every time... I also use good quality cave aged gruyere. yummo.

Easy, tasty, and beautiful. Thanks for the tip on poking the tops with a knife. I did that as soon as a they came out of the oven, and they kept their shapes. Used my misto olive oil sprayer on the muffin pan. Made a quarter of the recipe and it scaled down fine.

Very Good. Quick tip- if you use a very sharp knife and puncture the popovers when they come out of the oven, they will stay puffy. This is due to the steam being able to escape the popover before it cools and contracts, deflating the popover in the process.

Agreed, these are simple and tasty. As another reviewer mentioned they do deflate quickly,and I made the mistake of trying to reheat them once. Flat! won't do that again.

These popovers came out perfect. I had them at BLT Steak in NY and they added a great touch to a delicious meal. The ones at BLT are huge and these are smaller but just as tasty. In my oven they took more than 40 minutes. I'll definitely make these again.

I made these popovers VERY quickly and they still came out beautifully. I tried to buy some popover pans but couldn't find any. Trust me -- muffin pans work beautifully. My guests LOVED these popovers, though I felt the cheese sprinkled on top kept them from fully "popping." Nevertheless, they looked beautiful: golden and gooey with cheese. Because popovers have such a short shelf life (they quickly deflate and go cold), consider baking two batches -- one that comes out with the start of the meal and the second that comes out fifteen minutes later.

i'm not sure what i did wrong - but my popovers didn't popover!! they turned out like a moist, eggy muffin - tasted okay but they were not what i was aiming for.

Fast, Easy to make, Crowd pleasingly tasty. What more could you ask for? I would take up some other reviewers suggestions next time for additions, fresh herbs or some sundried tomatoes would add a lot I think.

Wonderful! My husband loved them too, alway a bonus.

I made these as an appetizer in small muffin tins. For a variety of flavors, after they were cook, I added cooked, sliced, spicy Italian sausage on top of some, sundried tomatoes on top of some and others with just the cheese. Easy, look great and taste great.

I'm so happy to see this classic Southern dish on here, as it is so easy and fulfilling. Normally I've served them in the morning, but the added cheese to this down-home favorite seems to make the recipie applicable to any meal. Nice twist.

This accompanied soup for dinner and my husband raved. He said to add it to his "favorites file of recipes". I didn't have gruyere and added asiago instead. Worked out fine.

These HAVE to be served hot, I made them for a party and then saved some for my husband, but the next day they tough like day old pizza crust. Oh well, I still loved 'em fresh and plan on making them again!

They are so easy to prepare and oh so good. A pleasant aroma drifted from the oven while they cooked and drew family members into the kitchen for a special time together. Once out of the oven many were snatched by hungry hands on route to the table, and when finally there they provided a warm comfort food that made home dining feel like a restaurant experience.

I made these as an appetizer for book club. They browned up beautifully and had great flavor. I spooned in some batter, put cheese in, then batter on top to incorporate cheese more fully.
