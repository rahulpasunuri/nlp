This has become a huge hit around the house lately, especially for us mayo haters :) My revised version is: substitute white balsamic for the red wine vinegar, omit the sugar (if using a sweet vinegar like balsamic), cut the oil in 1/2. I've been using red potatoes lately, I didn't have parsley one time so I used fresh basil instead. Every time is better than the last...I'd def suggest adding the vinegar while the potatoes are still very warm to absorb up all that delicious flavor.

This is it: a great base potato salad recipe that uses olive oil instead of mayo. Any vinegar you have will work great. Omit the sugar if you like. Instead of the 2T of parsley you can use any fresh herb you have on hand, or even use 2t of those "dried leaf" spices currently going stale on your shelf.

I enjoyed the flavour of this and so did my guests but somehow, the potatoes got a bit mushy - perhaps I cooked them a bit too long - which didn't make it look as appealing as I would have liked.

I thought this was very easy and tasted great. I used baby potatoes and did not peel them. I also used less oil, maybe 2 Tbl and added 1 Tbl reduced fat mayo and some crushed garlic.

I felt that the recipe called for too much olive oil. I will try halving the amount next time. Otherwise, the flavor was delicious. I used Jersey Royal potatoes for this recipe (readily available in late June/early July in England), and they were an absolute delight.

This is a great salad. I used baby potatoes and parsley out of the garden. I didn't think it needed anything else added to it.

everyone loves this one! No mayo so it's very light in calories. Tasty too! I've made it three times since the magazine arrived!

I would make this recipe as directed and just before serving add a teaspoon of mustard and some oil to bring it up to a taste level that suits your guests. It needs extra salt and pepper but it presents well and tastes good. It isn't missing any mayo or sour cream. I like this as an alternative to conventional potato salad.
