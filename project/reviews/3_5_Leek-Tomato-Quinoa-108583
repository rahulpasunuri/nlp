I agree with other reviewers that this dish is pretty run-of-the mill. Totally unoffensive, hearty and healthy but not four-forks good. The sweetness of the leeks gets lost in all of the other ingredients. If I'd had some feta on hand I'm sure it would have spruced things up a bit.

This is a great recipe. I don't do all the fussing around with the quinoa. I've tried rinsing and not and can't tell the different so I don't bother with that. I really don't think you need to and not fiddling makes this MUCHO easier. And it's very worth it. Really tasty and healthy. Go on! Give it a try!!

This is one of the best Quinoa dishes I have ever had. Served it with pan seared salmon and roasted asparagus. Everyone loved it. After reading the other reviews, I added a cube of vegetable bouillon into the cooking water for the quinoa and omitted the extra salt, then substituted plain water for the chicken broth. I also added a few chopped grape tomatoes for added color. It was truly delicious.

All the ingredients here told me I'd love the dish, but not so much. We are new to quinoa and my kids actually loved it plain but none of us liked it as much after I added in everything else.

A really good and tasty side dish. I find Charlie Trotter's haughty behavior incredibly annoying (ever watched his shows?) but no sense in taking it out on the dish. Oh yes, I also used regular tomatoes.

Really tasty. I used red tomatoes instead of the yellow and it was still delicious.

I really wanted this recipe to work but it turned into a bland heap of wet-cement quinoa. I followed the recipe exactly too. I don't know what went wrong but there wasn't enough flavor and the texture was not appealing. Clearly based on the other reviews this should be a good recipe but if I tried to make it again, I might try some of the suggestions like cooking the quinoa in broth instead of water.

Four forks? Really? This is a fine recipe, nice and healthy and fresh, but four forks it is not. Just pretty standard-issue stuff.

even better when you substitute veg or chicken broth for the quinoa cooking water. my 10 month old loves it too!

i made something loosely based on this recipe. instead of cooking quinoa and leeks separately i decided to make it risotto style. i cooked the leeks in olive oil (instead of butter), added 1 cup of quinoa, cooked for a minute, added 1 cup of wine white, cooked until the liquid was all gone, added 2 cups of chicken broth, cooked until liquid all gone. finally i stirred in halved grape tomatoes, green onions, chopped parsley (didnt have basil) and lemon juice. it turned out ok. enough for two for dinner. light and tasty and easy. but nothing so special in the flavours. i want to make it again with basil to be able to better judge.

Absolutely lovely! I didn't have leeks so I used red onions and it turned out great. Instead of using yellow tomatoes I used red plum tomatoes. Loved it! Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.

I made this dish with the Greek Style Mahi Mahi featured on this site. The market was completely out of basil, so I substituted half parsley and half cilantro. It was fabulous, even my 5-year old loved it! I have since made it with the basil, and it seemed bland in comparison. This recipe is a keeper, only with cilantro/parsley instead of basil!

I loved this recipe! I didn't have any basil on hand so skipped it. I topped the dish with crumbled goat's cheese, which gave it a bit of zip. I had only one leek on hand so supplemented with ~1/2 chopped yellow onion. Still was absolutely fabulous. In terms of quantity, a half recipe was not quite enough for my husband and I as a main dinner dish. This recipe is still a really nice change from pasta, and a great addition to my vegetarian weeknight menu list.

I thought that I didn't like quinoa, but I am trying things to find more healthy alternatives to couscous, pasta, rice, etc. But this is really good. My carbo-loving husband was skeptical, but about a quarter of the way through the meal he and I both decided we liked it a great deal. I added garlic and thyme.

I followed other reviews and cooked the quinoa with chicken broth - it made it much more flavorful. I also had cherry tomatoes lying around so I quartered those and threw them in instead of the yellow tomatoes - their sweetness was perfect. An extra TB of lemon juice and this was the perfect accompaniment to our tarragon-mustard grilled chicken.

This recipe is excellent! The only additions I made were the addition of marinated hearts of palm and artichoke hearts. I served this with mahimahi with charred onions and tomatoes....huge hit!

First experience with quinoa: it turned out well, but no rave reviews. Cooked the quinoa in chicken stock, tossed some broccoli in with the leeks and added some lemon zest in the end. Served with some Indian main dishes.

Served this with lamb chops. Fabulous flavor and really great color. Always love using quinoa. It has a heartier flavor than couscous.

Not bad, but not really all that great either. If I make it again I'll probably up the herb quotient, adding some mint and parsley and maybe some lemon zest.

I love this recipe and have made it many times now. I usually add a bit more lemon juice because I like a tangier taste. I've passed this recipe onto many friends to introduce them to Qunoa.

I made a slight variation of this recipe - used red instead of yellow tomatoes and dried instead of fresh basil. I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth and added water to the leeks. The result was fantastic. An excellent side dish to fish or any meat.

This was a great recipe. I cooked the Quinoa in Chicken Broth and added a couple of cloved of crushed garlic to the sauteed veggies --- good side dish

Excellent recipe! It is better with the light colored quinoa, but with the dark red quinoa it has more texture.

I substituted diced canned Artichoke Bottoms for the tomatoes and this dish was a great side for lamb and the Yogurt Garlic Sauce from this site.

Fantastic - I could not source yellow tomatoes, so substituted with beefsteak tomatoes. Refreshing to eat instead of other starch/carb with meal.

I was actually surprised at how good this was. I had everything on hand (except tomatoes) and was looking to get rid of it all. I couldn't believe I found one recipe to use them all! I had expected this dish to be awful, and I could throw it away with no guilt. But the whole family enjoyed it very much. I'm not sure if I'll ever make it again. But if I do, I'll do something to make the quinoa a little moister.

I made this for my fiance on Valentine's Day to go with Beef Tenderloin. He loved it, said it was the best quinoa recipe to date. The subtle flavors of the leeks and yellow tomatoes were wonderful. The only thing it needed was a little more olive oil, about a tablespoon, and more salt, which I let people add at the table. Everyone's tastes are different. We enjoy the nutty taste and texture of quinoa and the health benefits. It really doesn't need to be "embellished" as much as previously stated.

I made this dish with couscous instead of quinoa. I also substituted sherry and water for the chicken stock and added probably more leeks than the recipe called for. It turned out really well and definitely made excellent left-overs.

Rating: 3
I concur with other reviewers; this dish even SOUNDED bland - but thought it had potential, so... followed the basic recipe, added garlic, LOTS of chili flakes, extra tomatoes, fleur de sel and a glurg of tomato juice. sounds crazy, but it turned out fab! The fiance loved it, and he's a self-admitted grain-hater.

I steamed the quinoa (10 min boiling, 10 min over steam) for a fluffier texture and then followed the recipe as provided. However, I found the dish to be kind of bland, as did my dinner guests. I ended up using the leftovers to make a quinoa salad.

It goes very well with filet steaks and the roasted garvlic sauce. It does need plenty of seasoning. Be careful not to overcook the quinoa - I think the cooking time given here is too long.

A great recipe. Make sure you wash your leeks well to get rid of the sand.

My 5 yr. old said it best: "It has too little flavor." It's bland, very bland. Probably goes well as a side dish to a well-seasoned entree, but doesn't stand on its own. It's a good introduction on how to cook quinoa, but I'll use this recipe as a springboard for other things. You could try with couscous, but cook according to package directions.

Cook from London, quinoa (pronounced KEE-nwa) is a grain from the Andes. They are tiny round seeds. Couscous is a little bit bigger, but it could arguably work as a substitute, from what I know of quinoa. It's commonly used by people with celiac disease (who can't tolerate most grains) and people trying to avoid wheat and corn because of allergies.

Iv'e never heard of quinoa. Would cous cous be a good substitute?

Rating: 0
I'd like to try this, but is the quantity correct for this recipe? 1-1/2 cups raw quinoa, about 1 to 1-1/2 cups of tomatoes and 2 cups of leeks makes less than 3 cups...? Seems as though just the quinoa when cooked would be 2-1/2 cups...

I served this as a vegetarian entree instead of with the beef. I can see that they would go well together, but this dish stands alone nicely. If I made it again I would probably add a bit of garlic with the leeks, but that is the only modification I would make.
