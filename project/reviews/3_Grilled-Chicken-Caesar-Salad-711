I followed the dressing recipe from the cook on 5/31 and it was way too spicy. Should have guessed from the amount of tabasco, but I'm always willing to try new things. Also missed the smoothness of a caesar dressing that comes from adding mayonnaise or egg. Will try it again, but with a different dressing.

I prepared the homemade caesar dressing from the review from "a cook on 5/13" and it was top notch.

This is a great quick and easy recipe. I served the salad with Pita bread. Some people made a Pita sandwich and others just ate it along with the salad.

The BEST caesar dressing: 1/2 TB dijon,2 garlic cloves, peeled, 3 anchovies, 1 TB Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp hot sauce, 3/4 tsp black pepper, salt, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 1/4 cup fresh grated parmesan, 1/4 cup olive oil. Blend all but oil, then add oil slowly in a stream in blender creating an emulsion. Toss with romaine and croutons. Got this from Gourmet magazine and have made it at every occasion. can add grilled chicken or shrimp.

Great without the anchovy.

I confess I make my own dressing (only takes about 3 minutes, tops) but I loved this for a great summer quick meal. My recipe if anyone interested - whip 3 TBSP olive oil, anchovy oil (from tinned anchovies), 2 tsp.lemon juice and egg until consistency of thin mayonnaise. Add mashed garlic to taste, a tad of tobasco, mustard (preferably dry Coleman's)and couple drops of worcestershire sauce, stir and add anchovies. I regret above amounts are guesstimates as I don't measure, but you can play with it, taste it, and get your own combination happening.

I've made this with bottled dressing...Cardini's is our favorite...and I toss in a few whole, pitted Kalamata olives that are a perfect blend with the dressing, cheese, chicken, etc. It's a winner in our house.

Just to let you all know, all of Girard's Ceasar dressings have MSG in them. So if anyone is sensitive to this chemical you may want to avoid using it.

Bottled dressing and all (it saved me time on a Thursday night), this is a great, light meal! The anchovy toast is a pleasant plus.

I can't beleive the complete snobbs on this one, I have made this 4 times and will make it again tonight(3.12.02). I like Girard's myself and yes when I have the time I make my own, But not on a tuesday night. It's like what Emeril says... " Come'n folks it's not rocket science"!!!!! It just food, Damn!

One of the things I love about epicurious is the fact I can get sumptious and impressive recipes. But after a hard day's work I want to make something quick and tasty and if using a good quality bottled salad dressing gets my dinner to me five minutes quicker, I'm not complaining. You snobs should have a go at living in the real world.

Really, people. I discovered this while searching for a "honest" Caeser salad dressing (garlic, egg yolks, anchovies, olive oil, parmesan cheese, etc.). However failing that, I love "Renee's" line of dressing ~ rich, natural, organic ~ and probably better than anything I could do from scratch! Get over yourselves!

The best store-bought dressings are made by Girard's. They are really great. And I am not afraid to say I use them.

Food snobs probably don't think there IS such a thing as a good bottled Caesar dressing. I have yet to find one, but that doesn't mean there isn't one somewhere, and that could make this a good, quick, easy supper. Re: other reviews: please take your mean-spirited comments to a web-site more politically charged than a recipe finder, for goodness sake.

I am just now looking for a Caesar dressing recipe and I admit I will not be making this particular dish. I couldn't resist commenting anyway on the ridiculous display of snobbery in the ratings. Most great chefs and original thinkers in general do not tout complexity as the standard for excellence. The individuals who list the "store bought" component as the kiss of death in this recipe probably have the income, "staff support" and leisure time to grind their own flour if they want. And for the individual who made the 40 oz comment,don't be a hater, or as some of us edekated types call it a "bigot."

I say lighten up. There is no need for such ruffled culinary feathers. Did anyone actualy _make_ this recipie? I did and it was a good, quick weeknight meal that was just homemade enough to be comforting. I love the more complicated recipies on Epicurious, but sometimes when I get home, I just want something fast and un-complicated. This fit the bill. So c'mon guys, chill out!

Shame on Epicurious!!! While looking for a receipe for an original caesar salad I found this one which calls for a "bottled" dressing!!!! What's going on here??? I wouldn't be using this site if I was the "hamburger-helper" kind of cook. Please......

SHAME on Epicurious!! Where is a HOMEMADE caesar dressing that I am looking for?!? Like, DUH, I can go to any store and BUY dressing!! And slap that on top of chicken, who's dumb enough not to know that? Get with it.

Bottled Caesar dressing?? On this website??? Not up to Epicurious standards, to say the least. A Caesar dressing need not be complicated to be good, but it needs to be fresh, or it's just dreck. There are many excellect Caesar salad recipies on this site - why bother with this?
