I made this one evening and by mistake, forgot to do the last part omitting all the tartness of lemon juice, gin and olives. It was marvelous! I did it once more and was more thorough, finishing as directed, but did not enjoy it near as much! Try it! This sauce rendered as it is, is complex and subtle, very nice without the tartness.

This was a delicious meal. The sauce with the salmon was perfect. I also spooned the sauce over steamed asparagas and mahogany rice and the family loved it. The only change I will try next time is thickening the sauce a little.

This was wonderful! For those who had trouble with it, use a good quality vermouth and fish stock (instead of bottled clam juice). Remember you are concentrating these flavors down, so they need to be good to start with! The sauce would also be great with mixed seafood (shrimp, scallops, lobster & mixed fish as we can get in a "chowder mix" here) over rice or small pasta. Do NOT omit the juniper berries, easilly found (even in "backwoods" Nova Scotia!) they add the character the dish needs.

This entree was absolutely delicious! We couldn't get enough of the beautiful sauce. While it was very rich with the whipping cream, I might make it next time with the low fat half and half. Served it with Israeli couscous with a lemon oregano oil. Truly sumptious!

Very tasty sauce. I made a few changes though. Add a bit of corn starch to thicken the sauce. Berries are not necessary (I did not find them). At the end triple the amount of vodka, it makes a big difference. Accompany with canned new potatoes with butter and parsley.

Good recipe but the martini flavor did not come through. For the expense and difficulty in getting the ingredients, the recipe probably would have worked as well without the juniper berries and with a light chicken stock instead of clam juice. The sliced olives/pimentos in the sauce made for a nice holiday presentation. Served this with a garlic and oil angel hair and the sauce was a nice compliment.

This is no doubt my family's favorite salmon recipe. The martini sauce compliments the salmon so nicely that our guests couldn't get enough. A very good recipe for entertaining.

The sauce was acceptable, but unremarkable. And apart from using martini ingredients, we found no reason to call it "martini sauce." None of the martini flavors made it past the heavy cream and clam juice (and we love martinis). Note that the solids in the saucepan (shallots, juniper berries, green pepper) make it look as if there's a lot more liquid than there really is. I can think of half a dozen salmon sauces tasting far better and taking a fraction of the time and trouble of this mediocre sauce.

This was truly a crowd-pleaser. The sauce is rich and interesting and not too Martini-like for those who might not be fans of the drink. The gin lends wonderful flavor. Recommend serving the salmon in shallow bowls to really appreciate the sauce, as it's on the thin side (or serve over rice or another starch). I'll consider thickening it a bit next time. Enjoy.

I'm not crazy about martinis so wasn't sure that I would like this recipe when I made it for company 2 weeks ago. I'm happy to report that it not only was a hit with our guests, but I thought it tasted pretty good too...good enough to put it on the menu this week for my next party! And easy for company, I did the sauce ahead and baked the salmon.
