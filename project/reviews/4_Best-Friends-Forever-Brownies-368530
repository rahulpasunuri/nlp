Delicious. Chewiness to perfection. These are phenomenal and I make a lot of brownies always searching for that perfect combination of fudgy and chewy and cakey. These ones fit it super well.

Really excellent brownie recipe. The chewy texture and crispy edges are to die for. These brownies are universally loved by my family and co-workers. It's important that the oven be fully pre-heated for the brownies to turn out correctly. You can easily melt the chocolate down with less mess in the microwave, heating the chocolate and butter in 30 second increments, stirring in between each 30 second increment until fully melted.

Delicious brownies...as easy and far better than a mix. My husband has developed an allergy to walnuts, so I tried toasted chopped hazelnuts. They were good, but we both prefer walnuts and he is willing to risk a swollen tongue to enjoy them (Hey, I'm not his mother!)

Really, that good. Don't sneak them when they're warm; they need time to firm up.

The be-all, end-all brownie recipe. Seriously, it's the most amazing brownie you could make. Bookmarked for life.

I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan. Super moist, fudgy and delicious. I cut in small squares, served 2 per person with a tiny scoop of Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia. There was enough for about 18-20 servings. A hit!

Coming from a brownie aficionado, this is an outrageously delicious and easy recipe! I doubled the recipe using Dagoba chocolate and Ghirardelli cocoa and used a 9x13 cake pan, baking 45 minutes. The brownies have a crust and a perfect chocolatey-fudgy middle. Heaven!

An easy straight forward recipe that yields delectable brownies! I added a teaspoon of instant coffee to the batter to intensify the flavor of the chocolate. I like that the ingredients are likely to be in just about anyone's pantry.

This was a delicious recipe. It didn't take much time (butter and chocolate melt fast) or effort to clean up (bowl to mix and pan to cook) when compared to making brownies from a box. I really liked using the parchment paper. It made clean up a breeze. I much prefer these brownies over ones made from a box.
