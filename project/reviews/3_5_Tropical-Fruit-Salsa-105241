I used only a very, very ripe papaya so I added a dash of white vinegar to cancel out the sweetness - loved it! One word of warning, though. I felt lazy and threw this into the blender so it was more a liquid sauce than a proper salsa. My fault!

Though prep time isn't bad, I used tropical fruit cups for the mango and papaya. Not quite as fresh, but it gets the point across.

Fabulous salsa! Especially good with salty homemade potato chips, we make it without the jalapeno to cut the salt of the chips - delicious!

We LOVED this salsa! Would give 3.5 forks if we could. Fresh tasting, delicious and versitile. This stuff could make cardboard taste great! Served with fish burritos, would go well with chips, chicken, or pretty much anything. Great stuff!

VERY-VERY GOOD, this is a much better salsa than you can find at the Whole Foods or other gourmet supermarkets. I followed the recipe exactly and added avocado and one red tomato to make it look more colorful. Peppers are spicy, and I reduced them significantly, but it is my own preference, some like it hot and should go for it. It was great. I make it regularly now and serve on the top of any white fish, such as sea bass, swordfish or snapper. It makes a beautiful presentation and an exiting side dish.

Very tasty - made for a caribbean pot luck as an appetizer with some tortilla chips. Disappeared in seconds.

I forgot to add the orange juice- & it was still fabulous. Added 1/2 of a red pepper for extra crunch & color. It made a simple weeknight dinner of grilled chicken breast & snap peas seem like a gourmet meal. My husband thanked me for dinner!

I substituted pineapple for the papaya since I was looking for a recipe to use mango and pineapple that I had. I swapped red pepper flakes for the fresh jalapeno partly from preference but mostly from the fact that I had pepper flakes on hand. It was really good, but it got even better when I finely chopped a half of an avocado into it. It took longer than 20 minutes since I'd never worked with mangos before.

To the cook from New York: you don't like fruit with onions? So why did you make a recipe with ingredients you don't like? Just how many rocks are in your box? This is a wonderful recipe. Excellent blend of flavors, and quite different from most other salsas. Loved it! Then again, I like fruit with onions. Go figure!

Apart from cubing the mango and papaya this was one of the best salsas I ever had. Extremely easy to make and the last time I buy salsa for a while.

Oh man, this is soooo good. My sister (see below) forgot to say that she put in strawberries, so I did too, but I didn't add any other juice besides the lime, and it wasn't missed. I also used red onion instead of white.

Have made it four times and it has been devoured each time. I somehow got mixed up with another recipe and have been adding about a 1/4 of rum. Gives it a nice edge!

I made this for a caribbean-themed party and I served it with plantain chips. Everyone really loved it and it is so easy to make. I must confess, I was under time pressure so I used canned papaya and canned mango and it still tasted great.

My wife loved it so I brought some into work and everybody there loved it too and wanted the recipe. I put a little pineapple juice in it.
