I made this recipe a couple of years ago when I had some canned pumpkin to use up. It's great. Texture is nice and fluffy and the flavor is good. I've been beating egg whites and folding them into the batter ever since.

Terrible recipe and a waste of time and effort. I don't want to even give it one fork for a rating but that's the lowest you can go. Way too gooey. Why would we need to beat egg-whites? Pancakes are not supposed to be overly fluffly..... I tried to throw the batter in the waffle maker and even that couldn't cook it.

These were disgusting. Way to eggy. The texture was horrible. I threw these out after tasting them.

these are hands down the best and fluffiest pancakes!

These cooked up beautifully but...ugh, the texture was pretty revolting. All I can think is that it has too much pumpkin and egg in it to have a true pancake texture/bite. No matter how long they stayed in the pan, they were way too wet and soggy tasting inside. A real shame since I wasted a home grown sugar pumpkin on the recipe.

Rating: 3
A pancake recipe should be simple and this one was with some minor changes. I mixed everything except pumpkin spice and vanilla at once. I dumped in 2x the amount of pumpkin spice with vanilla at the end and mixed well. I used 3 eggs bc someone reviewed it as too eggy. 3 eggs were good probably be ok with 2.

Rating: 1
Very unimpressed with this recipe. They were too egg-y to be a pancake but not quite a crepe. Very unpopular with my family!

Rating: 3
These were so good and a great deviation from the usual pancake - especially in fall. The flavor is mild but definitely has that "pumpkin pie" taste. The only changes I made were a 50/50 blend of unbleached/wheat flour and I didn't separate the eggs because I was lazy to be perfectly honest here. They still turned out light and fluffy so definitely recommend skipping that step.

Rating: 4
I made them with 1c (-1T) whole wheat flour with 1/4 c. white flour and buttermilk instead of whole milk. They were a little sweet for my family's taste - I would use less sugar next time. I like the idea of making them for Thanksgiving!

Made these exactly as the recipe instructed, batter-wise. They were excellent, since I added in some raisinets on top afterwards. The actual pancake was bit rich for me. Next time, I would use 2% or 1% milk and maybe less butter. But, really nice pumpkin flavor.

Delicious recipe! I made mine a little healthier by not adding butter, but using a whole can of pumpkin. I also used whole wheat flour and only 1 cup of organic skim milk (because of the extra pumpkin). I also like to double up the spices on any recipe. I warmed my maple syrup with pecan bits on the stove for the finishing touch! =) Yummy!

This was pretty good but I think I prefer gingerbread pancakes as far as holiday pancakes go. We also made a batch of blueberry afterwards and they were better overall.

Fantastic, maybe the best pancakes we've had. Easily substituted 1/3 whole wheat flour, yoghurt for some milk. Worked fine at 6500 ft altitude. Do make sure you cook on medium, or they'll get a bit too dark before finished inside. Also: used 1 tsp cinamon, 1/4 cloves, 1/2 nutmeg instead of allspice. Yay.

Delicious Recipe, I opted for healthier options: I used whole wheat flour in stead of white, almond milk instead of whole, brown sugar, and unsweetened apple sauce instead of butter and it was a hit with my husband who's not a big fan of my healthy cooking, but he couldn't tell the difference. The recipe serving make 7 pancakes but please cook them on low b/c the pancakes burn easily. P.S. I used PAM instead of butter for the skillet. Healthy cooking can be Delish! Let's take care of our bodies from the inside out!

This recipe was excellant. The changes I made to it were: Used canola oil instead of butter, I substituted the flour with the 9 grain white flour and the kids love chocolate chips so I dropped 5-6 chips on each pancake while cooking. Don't overdue it on the chips. I also did not have pumpkin pie spice so I made my own with 4 t. cinnamon, 2 t. ground ginger, 1 t. ground cloves and 1/2 t. nutmeg.

I make these every Thanksgiving weekend. I have successfully added blueberries (2 small containers) to the batter without altering any other proportions. I have also upped the pumpkin pie spice to 1 1/2 teaspoons. I pour 1/4 cup instead of 1/3 because the smaller pancakes are easier to flip. I get 22 pancakes that are about 3 inches across. Make sure your griddle or skillet is hot enough for the first batch to cook properly.

We made these pancakes the day after Thanksgiving. They were great. We made them using a large pumpkin cookie cutter. They were smaller than normal cakes but turned out great. I used butter instead of oil because I like that butter taste on the outside. They were light yet had body - not sure if people get what "spongey" or "crepe-like" means but that is not what these are like in the slightes (WHICH IS A VERY GOOD THING). They were thick but light and had incredible texture. Thanks for the idea to whip the egg whites. Definitely trying that with other pancake recipes. Great w/maple syrup but would also would be great with some chocolate chips or choc. shavings and even a little whipped cream. A couple people complained that they were not sweet enough - I completely beg to differ. First of all - pancakes aren't supposed to be sugary - that's what the syrup is for. And second - these could be eaten w/o syrup - w/o being sugary. They were excellent. Will make again for sure.

Delicious. These remind me of my favorite pumpkin waffle recipe - http://pumpkinwaffles.wordpress.com/ultimate-pumpkin-waffle-recipe/

Rating: 2
I felt this recipe was ok, too much effort for the end result. I too found the batter to be a bit thick, similar to my homemade belgian waffle recipe(which also has separately beaten whites) I thinned a bit w/milk, and forged ahead. Taste was a bit bland, so the spices were increased. Edible, would not make again. For anyone wanting to try another similar recipe, Rachael Ray has a great pumpkin gingerbread waffle recipe.

I loved these pancakes - perhaps my favorite pancake recipe. I used 3/4 C whole wheat flour and 1/2 C all purpose, 2% milk, and was a little generous on the spices and pumpkin. They are wonderful with a little butter and pure maple syrup on top. One note -- I had to cook them a lot longer than 1 1/2 minutes per side on my griddle at 350 degrees - otherwise they were mushy inside. They would get a little darker than I would normally cook them before they were done inside. No matter, though -- still delicious.

Rating: 4
I decided to try these pancakes for breakfast on Thanksgiving - we didn't have guests, but I had extra pumpkin left over from other baking. They were incredible! Light, fluffy and oh-so-tasty. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice on hand, so I used about 1/4 teaspoon each of nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves. I also used 1% milk instead of whole. My husband and I then ate breakfast at SoNo Baking Company (owned by a chef who worked with Martha Stewart, and who also has a show on food network now) a few weeks later. We shared an order of pumpkin pancakes and agreed that this recipe was better!! (PS I recommend unsalted butter vs. oil for the griddle. Oil can easily burn and ruin the pan.)

I made these using Pamela's Pancake mix, as I am gluten free. They were incredible--airy and feathery crepe-like pancakes. I neglected to add the vanilla and realized halfway through making the pancakes, so I added some to the remaining batter and my boyfriend taste tested both. Of course the correct ones were amazing. The last of the batch is still being cooked as I write. So delicious. Even using gluten free flour!

I added a tsp of orange zest and it was delicious. I make pancakes all the time and these are special for their flavor and texture. I served with a little plain yogurt mixed with maple syrup. I also used yams bc didn't have any pumpkin puree.

Because the egg whites get beaten separately then added to the batter, the pancakes are very spongey and light. We thought they were delicious and have already made them several times.

Rating: 3
The pancakes turned out really fluffy, yet still pretty dense at the same time-they weren't crepe-like at all. I think next time, I would add a little more pumpkin puree and maybe a bit less cloves and allspice than I did the first time (I didn't have pumpkin pie spice and used cinnamon, cloves and allspice like one of the other reviewers). To make sure the pancakes don't deflate, make sure to whip up the egg whites last and whip them really well. Make sure there isn't any water egg whites at the bottom of the bowl when whisking and to fold the egg whites into the batter very gently.

I made these for some friends and they really liked them. I don't have pumpkin spice in the house so I just added nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and a little cardamom.

Some previous reviewers indicated that the pancakes were uncooked in the center and then based their review on the pancakes not cooking properly. I had no difficulty with cooking the pancakes as an experienced cook knows that if the center is not cooked the temperature needs to be turned down on the griddle. These pancakes were light and fluffy. I sprinkled chopped walnuts on the cakes as they were cooking. Delicious.

These pancakes are great. I also made my own pumpkin pie spice using 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. The recipe makes more like 18 pancakes if you are using a 1/3 cup to measure the batter.

I made these per the recipe, but must admit that I've had much better pumpkin pancakes in the past. They don't have that awesome pumpkin and spice flavor that you would expect. They seemed somewhat bland. Also, the fluffy egg whites make the batter too airy and it doesn't cook evenly in the center. I would add the eggs whole and skip the extra work if you choose to make this one.

Rating: 1
These never cooked completely through. I put them back to try to get the middle part cooked but it still came out basically raw. I think there is too much pumpkin proportionately to the rest of the ingredients for the batter to firm up as in traditional pancake recipes. So I'm still looking for another pumpkin pancake recipe...

I have a bit more to add after reading the other reviews. I wonder if the folks who had bad luck with these used baking soda rather than baking powder. Important distinction. Or, perhaps their ingredients were old. Anyway, I think it's a perfect recipe. My version of pumpkin pie spice is heavy on the ginger, followed by cinnamon, nutmeg, and a light shake of chinese five spice and poppy seeds. I didn't measure my spices. Just threw in to my heart's delight.

This is a perfect recipe that delivers light, flavorful pancakes. Plus, this recipe says you yield "about 12" cakes and that is actually true. I often seem to fall short of the suggested yield when it comes to pancake recipes. This one actually left me with more than twelve. I made one change to the recipe, however. Rather than use 3 tablespoons of sugar, I only used 1. I've made this one before and three was too sweet for me. I make these quite often, but I always serve them for Thanksgiving and Christmas brunch. At thanksgiving, I serve them with cranberry sauce. I always serve them with a yogurt sauce made from raspberry or peach yogurt, orange juice and ginger. That always gets rave reviews, even from my picky-eater friends.

This recipe was horrible. I followed the instructions exactly except for adding more spices as per the suggestion of others. They tasted bad -kind of like a chalky flavor.

I was really excited about this recipe, but I have to give it one fork ("just so-so" according to Epicurious). That's what I'd say - they are just "so-so". They are very fluffy and puffed-up, with an almost souffle-like interior texture. I didn't like that smooshy, airy texture (tried cooking them longer with another batch and it didn't matter), and frankly found them to be lacking in flavor. They smell great being made, but I just didn't love them. A lot of work for a so-so result. I highly recommend, however, the Spiced Pumpkin Bread recipe on this website. Four forks for that one!!!

I'm a college student and I made these in my dorm's kitchen with some girls I live with. It made us feel like we were at home. They were so amazing that we made a second batch!

These were very good--moist yet light, and they made the kitchen smell like fall. I didn't have pumpkin pie spice, so I used 1t cinnamon, 1/4t ginger, and 1/8t each of nutmeg and cloves. This produced a pancake with a good amount of spice (as I like it). I also used 1% milk and substituted canola oil for half of the butter. Next time, I might deccrease the total amount of fat added. The pumpkin adds so much moisture and richness, 4T fat is really not needed, and might just be weighing the pancakes down.

I made the recomendation to make cinnamon butter with these a while ago. I forgot to say it is 1/2 cup POWDERED sugar, 1/2 c butter, about 1 tsp cinnamon (I always add more), and a little orange zest blended and chilled in a parchment log. Sorry!

I'll definitely be making these again. My only complaint was that it took three bowls to make them!

Make these with the cinnamon butter recipe on this site and they steal the show!

I didn't separate the eggs, because of time constraints, but just mixed them in. I also used maple yogurt instead of the milk (I often do this with pancakes). I thought they were OK, but lacking flavor. My kids ate them, but asked why I made the pancakes with pumpkin! I'll stick to my traditional recipe. The reviewers who made these into waffles might be onto something though. Perhaps I'll try the basic recipe, with a bit more pumpkin and spice, as waffles someday.

It would be nice if the Epicurious dictionary would include a description of pumpkin pie spice, for those who would prefer to mix their own! I have no idea what is in this mixture (OK, I have an idea, thanks to other reviewers, but no ratio for mixing), and don't want to go buy something I don't use just to try a recipe. I'll try this with the spices from my own pie, but it'd be nice to know what the testers used!!!

I substituted the white flour for whole wheat flour but otherwise made these as written. I enjoyed the different texture -- these are very light, moist, thin pancakes. I was not very impressed with their flavor, however which was especially disappointing considering the extra work. This may be improved if one does not use a pre-made pie spice blend. I felt like they need strong flavors of toppings - cinnamon orange butter, or a good maple syrup in order to be really good. As printed, these were good for guests who normally do not enjoy pumpkin.

I made this for Halloween breakfast and it turned out fine with good flavor but pretty airy for pancakes. I used a bit of buttermilk mixed in with the milk because I had some and added a bit more cinnamon. I used leftover winter squash rather than open a can of pumpkin. If I make this again, I would not bother to beat the egg whites. I did cook them at a lower griddle temperature than usual since they seemed to be browning before bubbles were rising. Turned out great though.

My standard pancake recipe (and the best in my opinion) is from The Cake Bible which calls for the egg whites to be whipped separately, so I knew these were going to be light and airy. I made some adjustments, basically incorporating the 2 recipes. I ALWAYS use cake flour (with proper adjustments) because they come out more tender. I didn't have pumpkin spice so made my own: 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I increased pumpkin to 1 cup and they came out fine without thinning required with a nice pumpkin flavor that was not overbearing. I increased the baking powder to 3 tsp (the Cake Bible calls for 4 tsp), and I used buttermilk, and vanilla to 1.5 tsp. They were great! I'll make them for the holiday breakfasts.

To think I made these only because I had canned pumpkin left over from Thanksgiving! Was short on time, so I didn't separate the eggs, and they were still super. Substituted 1/2 tsp. each cinnamon and ginger plus 1/4 tsp.nutmeg for the spice mix.

These cakes are wonderful and have become a regular at our table especially in the fall.

Far and away the best pancakes ever! So moist and delicious. Even my toddler scarfed 3 whole pancakes.... and the 'squash' is a nice way to add some veggies into breakfast. Must Try!

I'd actually give it 3 1/2 forks! Wonderful pancakes. I had no whole milk so I substituted buttermilk. They were light, fluffy, and had a delicious pumpkin flavor. I will definitely make this again and again.

Other pumpkin pancakes I've had have been too moist, almost uncooked in the middle, even if they're thoroughly cooked. These are delicious - light and fluffy, not too much spice or pumpkin, but a nice pumpkin-y flavor. I've frozen them then reheated for 10 minutes in a 350 degree oven and they're almost good as new.

I have made these several times and they are wonderful. I used 1 and 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, but other than that, followed the recipe. Beating the egg whites until fluffy does make a difference.

Amazing how these were both light in texture and flavor. We were so afraid they would be heavy and taste too much like pumpkin pie but our fears were ungrounded - they were out of this world! Had to substitute for the pumpkin pie spice - 1/4 tsp each: cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and allspice.

i didn't have a mixer so i had to beat the eggs with a fork - myabe i just felt that i deserved a little more for all my troubles, but i felt like it lacked something. needed more sugar but maybe also more spice. also i think butter would be more fitting than oil. the banana syrup compote i made along side was perfect though.

I just made these this morning for Canadian Thanksgiving. They were really good - a cross between pumpkin pie and pancakes (go figure). They weren't too sweet, the batter was really easy to work with, and the kitchen smelled wonderful. I'm looking forward to Christmas morning already!

Had to substitute buttermilk for whole - should they be lighter and fluffier??! Kept them from floating off the plate by topping with maple pecan butter...

These pancakes are fanstastic. Beating the egg whites makes them very delicate (not a word I would normally use to describe something with pumpkin in it). I don't have pumpkin spice (nor could I find any in my grocery store) so I just used cinnamon and nutmeg. I will likely make these for Christmas breakfast and several times before that.

A bit more work than other pancake recipes due to the beating of egg whites, but it was well worth the effort. (I was at the home of friend who owned no mixer so I had to beat the egg whites by hand, and it was STILL worth it!) The pancakes have a wonderfully light, almost souffle like, texture, and the spices are just right - perfect for fall. Served with the best quality pure maple syrup; next time will try serving it with a warm banana / maple syrup compote and toasted pecans.

Best pancakes ever! They freeze well and can be served later in the week. I served with carmalized pecans, bananas and blueberries.

This recipe is excellent b/c they taste amazing, the texture is melt in your mouth and very easy to make...I spread soften cream cheese between each pancake and then sprinkled w/ toasted walnuts. No syrup is needed!

These have become a breakfast staple at our house. My 18 month old son can't get enough of them, so I gave them four forks. They really are delicious and the texture is so light. Always great to find something that is such a hit with the kids!

These are terrific! Not especially time-consuming, and so delicious. The taste is great, but it's the texture that really puts them over the top. They'll show up on the weekend breakfast table frequently from now on.

This recipe is outstanding! I just made them for breakfast and served them with homemade apple and pear butter, and my whole family loved them. This is going to be one of "know by heart" recipes after a couple of weekends now.

Best pumpkin pancakes I've tried. I added chopped walnuts to the batter, very good that way. Extra pancakes can be refridgerated wrapped and reheated in the toaster for a quick breakfast. Definately will make these again.

Perfection for pancake and pumpkin lovers! Wow, I didn't know pancakes could taste THIS good! The pancakes are nice and fluffy. This is a recipe good enough to use as a desert as well, in my opinion, with a little whipped topping & fruit. Thank you for the introduction to this treat!

This recipe ROCKED MY WORLD!! I made it for breakie Thanksgiving morning (..cause I had so much energy!!)Everyone raved. I served it with an amazing homemade buttermilk syrup. Make this, you won't be sorry. Email me if you want the buttermilk recipe.

This was DELISIOUS! Just what I was craving for a crisp fall morning. I even forgot to add the vanilla and they were still good. My husband loved them as well and commented that he would even add a little more pumpkin filling next time. I concur. The pumpkin flavor was very subtle but recognizable. I love pumpkin so more would be better...

Perfectly simple and good. I used a tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp ginger and a pinch of clove instead of a spice mix. They were slightly sweet with a delicate spice flavor. These were light and fluffy and moist.

Really, really good recipe. Used fresh pumpkin puree and it worked fine. A generous amoung of cinnamon and nutmeg worked fine as a substitute for pumpkin pie spice. Big hit with everyone and a great way to get the kids to eat pumpkin and eggs.

I made these for a fall breakfast for 10 and they were scrumptious! I added a little more pumpkin than the recipe called for; they turned out just right. Very fat--had to thin the batter a little actually. Served with sauteed apples,turkey sausages and of course, champagne! Will make again soon.

This was indeed a scrumptious recipe however, the pancakes were a little thinner than expected. I would definately recommend this as a typical pancake alternative. Perhaps, not for every Sunday brunch.

Just right. I was a skeptic but these really are good. My husband wants them again soon.

I followed the recipe exactly (even though I was anxious about using so many eggs) and I couldn't have been happier. They've replaced my husband's favorite pancake recipe. At least until we burn out on pumkin. (I also made the pumkin cider bread recipe,yum)

I have a lot of heart in the kitchen but I am not very skilled. But I went for it with this recipe and the results were fantastic! If I could do it anyone can. These pancakes scream fall and are absolutely delicious on a cold autumn morning.

Great recipe I had to make it for than the recipe called for 12, But it came out fluffy. Plus it was a little thick for my liking I added more milk to it.

Absolutely wonderful! Very fluffy and tastes like fall. My family loved it.

I came across this while searching for ways to use some leftover pumpkin, and I certainly found a winner with this one. The pancakes turned out perfect--light and flavorful. I used cinnamon, allspice and ginger for the pumpkin pie spice and used only two yolks instead of the four that were called for, but the end result was satisfactory nonetheless. I topped them with a homemade blueberry syrup. The pumpkin flavor was pleasing but not especially strong--next time I might use more pumpkin. But I will absolutely be making this again.

I made these for Christmas brunch, and they were delicious. I added a few more tablespoons of the pumpkin. I didn't have any pumkin pie spice, so just used cinnamon and nutmeg. I also sauteed some pelled, sliced Fuji apple wedges with sugar, cinnamon, and a touch of maple syrup that could be eaten with the pancakes. I will definitely be making these again!

I made these pancakes on Thanksgiving morning for my family, come Christmas, it was the most highly requested item! My folks purchased gobs and gobs of pumpkin in anticipation of my arrival. It's very easy to prepare and they come out perfect every time.

Boy, did I ever make a mistake in making these. My family loves them! I am having to double the recipe. I spend half of the morning in the kitchen making them. I wonder if there has ever been a pumpkin shortage caused by one family? Try them, you won't regret it.

I serve brunch to approximately 80 people once a month. These pancakes sounded just perfect for an Autumn brunch, and they were! People kept coming back for more. They are now a permanent part of my fall menu.
