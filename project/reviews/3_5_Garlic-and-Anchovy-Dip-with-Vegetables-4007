I found that adding a little flour and water paste and stirring it into the mixture while it cooks helps to thicken it and keeps it from breaking. Stir it in quickly so as to not get lumps!

We made this recipe pretty much as spec'd but we added cream (rather than using it as a substitution). Everyone used the bruschetta toast that we had with another appetizer to catch the drippings. Truly delicious.

We use to have this every New Years Eve when I was growing up. We also made it with the heavy cream. Sticks to the veggies better. Can't say this is low cal, but it sure is good and the veggies are healthy! We use all sorts of veggies...cabbage wedges, zucchine, carrots etc. But the best is eating the bread that we use to catch the drips from the veggies!

I haven't made this yet but using heavy cream in place of olive oil may help the consistancy

I made this for Christmas and I must have done something wrong ... the sauce was very liquid, and the anchovy paste settles to the bottom, making it hard to serve with the vegetables. Even though it tasted absolutely wonderful, I think the presentation needed some help. I think I would use the previous rater's suggestion and thicken it up a bit. The only reason I would make it again is because I still remember how good it tasted on a fresh, cold stalk of celery.

I was raised with this dish only we made it with a whole tin of anchovies, small bottle of olive oil, a stick of butter & 3-4 large cloves of garlic. Cook until it all turns into a paste. We used bread. Even people that don't like anchovies, loved this! This recipe is how I learned to love anchovies too. Yum!

Delicious. Great for spreading of bread...use in lieu of simple garlice and butter on a split loaf. Magnifico!
