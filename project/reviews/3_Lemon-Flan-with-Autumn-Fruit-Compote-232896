The flan was excellent -- light. Fruit was quite good. The dish makes a nice presentation.

The other reviewers are right when they say that it takes a long time to make this dish, but many of the steps involve letting it cool, simmering, refrigerating, etc., so you can go off and do other things. I made it the day before Thanksgiving, and it meshed well with my other tasks. The lemon flavor from the zest without any tartness was very pleasant. And the compote was incredible. I added extra dried figs (because I like them, that's why!), and simmered until the fruit had a lovely dark brown syrupy sauce. It was even better than the de rigeur pumpkin pie I serve every year.

Awesome! It did take a day to make but was totally worth it - the compote is just awesome. I served this as one of the desserts for Thanksgiving and people were scooping the compote off the platter - really really good.

Served at a dinner party and while people ate it, couldn't help notice the lack of ANY comment. Seemed like people were being polite to eat it. I think the fruit topping is too heavy for the lightness of the flan.

I would NOT make this recipe again, as it took a FULL FIVE HOURS to prepare!! The friends to whom I served it loved it, so that was no problem, but I just don't have the time to spend making this kind of dessert.

I finally found a recipe that tastes like home! I am originally from Spain, and although flan is something that tastes different depending on who made it, I love this particular one. It does NOT have a strong flavor to egg and it is pretty light. I made a few changes though. I have tried this recipe with whole, 2% and skim milk, and it works perfect with all of them. I also added 1/2 vanilla bean to the milk while it was boiling, reduce the sugar and although the compote is really nice, if I do not have enough time, I make instead my own caramel with sugar and water. I served it with a blueberry-cranberry sauce or with the strawberry sauce au Vin Santo that you can find here and some fresh berries. Delicious!!!

Yum! My husband made this yesterday (and we ate it without much more than a couple of hours of chilling). The flan is wonderful, creamy and lemon infused. He altered the compote (I don't know exactly what he left in, but he did add and/or substitute dried cranberries, and used acorn squash instead of the melon. The squash is incredible! The combination of flan and compote is perfect. We'll definitely repeat this easy recipe, and I'm looking forward to warming the extra compote to use as a topping for vanilla ice cream.
