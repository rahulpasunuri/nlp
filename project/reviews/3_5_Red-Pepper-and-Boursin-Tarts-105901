Yummy! Just unfolded and kept as rectangle. Made one with boursin and one with goat cheese. Added caramelized onions!!

As previously mentioned, these were good, but not spectacular. I added sauteed mushrooms and a red onion for more flavor and color, but it didn't really help. Also took the baking advice and only baked for 10 minutes at 450 on the top rack. 15 minutes would have burnt them to a crisp! Perhaps the addition of more cheese would make a favorable contribution?

Great combination of flavors! I use more Boursin than originally called for, and also cut the puff pastry into single serving rectangles or squares for easier eating, then top with Boursin and peppers, and bake.

As written, I think this is just good. I will make again, but will double the boursin cheese and add carmelized onions. Needed more salt. I also will bake at 400 degrees versus 450. It browned too quickly. I only had one oven available and tried to cook both tarts at the same time. The one on the bottom rack did not puff and was thin and greasy. I threw it out midway to save the one on the middle rack. So, recommend cooking one tart at a time or making sure both are on the middle rack in the oven.

Quick, easy, and delicious. No need to bother with cutting rounds - my rectangular tarts looked lovely, especially with yellow peppers added for contrast.

Great hit with recent dinner party! Super easy to make. As for the previous reviewer who stated that the bottom burnt, try using stoneware. I have a bunch from Pampered Chef and it never fails me.

Make things easier on yourself: skip the pastry. In a pinch I made this with just boursin and sauteed red peppers as a spread and someone actually used his finger to WIPE OUT the bowl. Great easy little appy.

Delicious! I also made individual tarts. I cut the puff pastry into triangles before baking. As one reviewer pointed out, when you do it this way, its better to have the peppers cut into smaller pieces. Everyone enjoyed these and they are very easy to serve.

The cooking time is a bit too long. Mine were blackened on the bottom. I did assemble these a day ahead of time and they held up in the fridge. I didnt bother cutting circles either, triangles are fine!

I made these for a cocktail party along with a couple of other appetizers from this site and thought they were great. I didn't bother to cut the rounds out of the pastry sheets. I used the sheets as is, right out of the package, cutting them into squares rather than wedges after they were baked. Very easy to put together and well received by the crowd.

Excellent -- I made individual rounds, pricking the area under the boursin so a crust would rise up. Very pretty on a tray. Easy but a bit time-consuming too.

I made double the recipe for a tea party, and I ended up with most of it back in my fridge afterward. The pastry just didn't puff anywhere there was topping on it, so most of it was greasy and dense. Did I do something wrong?

Easy and delicious!

This was so-o-o easy, and so delicious! I was looking for an appetizer that was different - not the same old thing. I made it as an appetizer for my Christmas dinner. Everyone loved it, and as a result didn't have much room left for the actual dinner. It does work great to make early on in the day. You can just pop them in the oven when you need them.

Served this for Christmas Dinner and it was a big hit. I made individual servings and thought it very successful. I did forget to prick the dough with a fork, which I think would have made it that much better. Will definitely do again, it was a very easy recipe.

I used a cookie cutter with the puff pastry and made smaller pieces instead. Made it very easy to serve.

My guests really enjoyed this recipe, and I was thankful I could make it ahead of time and chill in the refrigerator until guests started to arrive. This ensured I could serve them warm. I thought there were too many peppers, I'd cut the amount down by a little less than 1/2. Besides that I wouldn't change a thing. I didn't have any problems w/ the puff pastry.

I didn't bother cutting into rounds either - just sliced with a pizza cutter into wedges anyway. I didn't have any problem with the puff pastry in the middle of the tart, but I used less peppers in the very center after reading the previous review. I also pricked the pastry just before putting it into the oven.

It wasn't to die for, but it was easy, tasty and looked good. My guests were impressed. I used red peppers from a jar, previously skinned which was better with the delicate puff pastry.

First tried this when I saw it in Gourmet 2001. Pastry in center didn't puff as it should, but slicing the peppers VERY thinly has improved the outcome. Delicious and everyone raves.

Despite being incredibly easy to make, the tarts in this recipe look delicious and present very well. The addition of sauteed mushrooms and red onions adds great flavor and additional color. Experiment with your favorite veggies. It only takes 20 minutes to prepare. Kids love it, too!

We didn't fuss with cutting into rounds. This would be good with goat cheese as well.

We made this for an appetizer/cocktail Christmas party and it was the first thing to go! Very, very simple. We purchased the pastry puff that was in squares, so we cut each square into 4. Beautiful presentation that looks elegant and much more complicated. The bell peppers are great on their own.

An absolute hit with a BIG group of foodies at Christmas -- ultra easy, exceptionally delicious. I made individual tarts for easy serving (recommend slicing the peppers into smaller slices for thsi). I'm making again tonight for a pre-Easter supper/birthday celebration and plan to do again several times this week as out-of-town guests are here.

This was recipe was a big success! It was easy to make and very tasty. Make it! I highly recomend it.

This is a great recipe! I used Boursin for one tart and for the other used a spinach/artichoke cream cheese. Any kind of spreadable cheese will work...and I liked mixing pepper colors for the topping. Guests ate this up!!

This recipe was very disappointing. The edges of the pastry were all wasted as they were just plain pastry and the flavor was so-so. It was not worth the effort.

Great hors d'oeuvre! Very tasty and easy to make. My guests loved it. I used round cookie cutters to make individual pieces.

Tasty beginning, but needed more than just a red pepper. I added asparagus, yellow pepper and tomato. Perhaps some red onion would be a good addition. Good hors d'oeuvre for a cocktail party.
