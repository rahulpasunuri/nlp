This was delicious and easy to make. I halved the recipe without any problems. I omitted the raspberry sauce and served the puddings with fresh strawberries instead, which provided a nice contrast to the richness and sweetness of the blancmanges.

This was so good that I'm fighting the temptation to run to the fridge and eat the two leftover servings before dinner tonight, and it's only 8am. We thought it was absolutely delicious....this dessert really lends itself to artful presentation as well.

Excellent recipe! Very smooth with a heavenly almond flavor. After drizzling with raspberry syrup, I garnished it with orange twists. It looked as lovely as it tasted. Highly recommended!

I have made this Dessert for years to bring to my friends so that they may enjoy the finer things that life has to offer them. They ALWAYS ask for the recipe and I have extra printed copies on hand to give out.
