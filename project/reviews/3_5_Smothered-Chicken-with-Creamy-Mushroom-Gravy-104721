This was delicoius. A great comfort meal. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts. I accidentally put all the thyme in the flour mixture (guess I can't read directions), but it turned out great.

My husband just gobbled this right up, and because my husband does tend to do that, I started the chicken with a wee bit of olive oil, and added 4 tbs. butter right before I added the onions. At the end, I used fat free 1/2 & 1/2 with a scoop of sour cream instead of the heavy cream, I also deglazed the pan with brandy after sauteeing the mushrooms... and used only 3/4 tsp of thyme.

Delicious and simple. I used 1/3 stick of butter, but think I could reduce it even more. Made rice on the side to soak up the delicious sauce. Yum!

Very tasty. After I read the reviews, I made sure to salt and pepper the chicken breasts, then pounded the breasts flat. Since my son is allergic to milk, I used almond milk instead of cream then added more flour to make my gravy thicker. I let it simmer for about an hour. C'est Bon! btw..I served it with Trader Joe's Orzo/Rice Pilaf, and green beans.

Disclaimer: I used this recipe for inspiration, and made a lot of changes. First off, I didn't even have mushrooms, but wanted a chicken dish to pair with mushroom risotto I was making. Used onions only, Italian Seasoning instead of allspice & thyme, 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil, Rapunzel Vegan Sea Salt & Herbs Bouillon Cube instead of chicken broth, 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream, and deglazed with a splash of dry white wine. It was FABULOUS. Will definitely be making again - probably with egg noodle next time.

Tip! This sauce can be kicked-up in flavor by adding chicken base. Or, and this is clearly your choice, but add a nice shot of a good quality sherry or brandy to the sauce. This sauce just pops with the harmony of the sherry or brandy. Go a little at a time, and taste until you like it. And, there is no reason not to use half and half, or even evaporated milk for a nice thick silky texture to the sauce.

This is a terrific recipe! I have used it many, many times to take to friends who need a meal. Simple and easy. The leftovers are always delicious too. I generally double the recipe, to always have leftovers. Excellent served with rich egg noodles,brown rice, or even mashed potatoes. Steamed fresh broccoli and carrots make a simple side for color and nutrition. As a tip, you can cut the chicken into 1-inch cubes and serve this as a chunky chicken and mushroom "gravy" over toasted and buttered sourdough toast points. Makes a wonderful retro-type hot chicken sandwich, and serve with peas and a fruited jell-o salad for a mid-century comfort food supper!

Oh. Although this made the entire house smell like heaven, it tasted very, very bland when prepared as directed. Definitely not worth the calories, in this cook's opinion.

I didn't make this exact recipe, so I won't rate it. But for the cooks who thought it was too heavy, I suggest you use milk instead of cream and olive oil instead of butter. The flour has more than enough thickening power, and cream seems kind of like overkill to me. For those who want the deeper flavor, replace the broth with red wine (or cognac, as other reviewers did).

This recipe was fabulous. Didn't have allspice and only used 1/2 pound of mushrooms, was still excellent and I will be making it again soon.

Delicious! I used cremini mushrooms, but to those cooks who found the sauce too white or bland, white mushrooms sauteed until nice and brown should add a nice depth to the sauce. My picky kids raved about it, my husband thought it was a dish for "company".Pa

katieholmes_12134437 from Portland Or on 08/26/07 I made this for my husband and myself and it was great with a few minor changes. First I added 2x the amount of thyme to the flour, and generously salt and peppered both sides of the chicken before flouring it. I also cut the butter in half using olive oil. I used Crimini mushrooms and deglazed the chicken pan in about a 1/4c cognac. I also only used 2 chicken halfs and served over jasmine rice. It was great with really nice finish... perfect for a cozy fall night.

Yummy! I'll definately make this again. Chicken is very tender and the sauce goes perfect with any starch. Even my 2 yr old devoured it!

Very bland sauce. Tried making it with bone-in chicken thighs to give it more flavor. No luck. Additional Allspice and a few drops of lemon juice jazzed it up a bit but for the most part it was very uninspired and far too rich and heavy. Honestly not worth the calories.

Delicious! Added garlic to the mushroom mixture but deglazed the pan with wine before that. Served over rice and sauteed some frozen corn on the side.

This was just OK. It was easy to make and looked good. I know it said to season with salt and pepper at the end of the recipe, but I added much more than usual because the sauce was surprisingly very bland. My husband actually really liked it, but if I made it again, I would probably add some other seasonings or garlic to liven it up.

Pretty tasty...this tasted a little better than chicken with cream of mushroom soup. I served this recipe with the 'perfect rice' from this site, my fiancee LOVED it, while I thought i was just OK. I will keep this recipe in my recipe box, but will probably only make it once or twice a year.

Pretty tasty....it was a step above chicken with cream of mushroom soup. I used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and I served it with the 'perfect rice' from this site. I will keep this in my recipe box, but will probably only make it once or twice a year, it's not a must have.

Even using two varities of mushrooms, I found the gravy lacked depth...So I added a high quality sherry... I feel a good cognac would also have worked. This is a great base gravy..be creative with this one!

Pounded the chicken, substituted olive oil for half of the butter, and deglazed the pan with dry vermouth . Served it it with basmati rice , homemade cranberry sauce and broccoli. Simple meal, we enjoyed it BUT it needs something.

I am not a cook. I just follow directions from Epicurious and eat every night like I'm in a fine restaurant. This was delicious!! Easy to make, no hard to find ingredients. Just about the best chicken I've eaten.

This was an absolutely delicious recipe! I made this for my mom and dad and it was a hit. I served it with long grain and wild rice. I used white mushrooms and baby bella mushrooms that I found already sliced which was nice. Next time I might try using chicken tenderloins only because they could be easier to cook in a pan than the thick chicken breasts. I stored the leftover rice and chicken together and it made excellent leftovers.

Good, easy weekday dish - the allspice is a nice change of pace. I used a mixture of wild mushrooms and added a touch of dry white wine to the sauce.

Rating: 3
Delicious. Even my husband who doesn't like chicken ate it. I didn't have mushrooms on hand, so I just added more onion. Next time, I would substitute olive oil for the butter - far too fatty with half the quantity of butter called for. I think the recipe would be a success even with half the cream. I might also add garlic as well as experiment with spices. Nutmeg? Chili powder? A curry mix?

This was very good, and my husband really enjoyed it. I had extra sauce, so I baked two other chicken breasts in the sauce for him to take to work the next day. I thought that it called for to much butter, so I only used half and a little bit of olive oil. I also put some vermouth in while cooking the mushrooms. This is very easy and tasy dish.

This was fantastic, and very easy! The only thing that I added to the recipe was 1 Tablespoon of granulated chicken bouillion to the gravy. This provided a richer overall taste.

It was great. Something the whole family can enjoy. I added an extra teaspoon of thyme, by accident, but it was still a big hit. I reccomend it with a small green salad.

Realized once I started that I didn't have any thyme in the house - so made it without. My picky one year old loved it (and that matters a lot!). Next time I will make sure I have the thyme and will probably deglaze with white wine. A good weekday family dish.

Good dish and very easy to make. But my husband and I thought it was on the bland side.

I thought this recipe was delicious. I made it as written, but pounded the chicken to even thickness which made it juicy and tender and then added a few extra spices (additional allspice was one of them) when the whole thing was simmering. I thought the flavor of the thyme was perfect and not overwhelming at all as some other users stated. Next time, before I add the broth and cream, I might try deglazing the pan with either a little marsala or white wine for a little extra flavor. But even "as is", this one is definitely a keeper and will be made in my kitchen over and over again.

After all the rave reviews of this recipe, I expected something fantastic, not just ok. The mushrooms were tasty, but the chicken was pretty bland. However, at my boyfriend's suggestion (he liked it better than I did), I plan to try making just the gravy again as a soup.

This was an okay chicken dinner, but was definitely easy to prepare, which earns it points. I tenderized my chicken breasts w/ a mallet between wax paper before sauteing, which definitely make a difference. I would also recommend adding some white wine to the gravy to give it some depth... it's rather bland otherwise.

This is a great week night meal. It is very tasty and easy to make. I didn't have any thyme so substituted fresh parsley. It did take a bit longer than the recommended cooking time but the chicken still turned out moist and the gravy thickened to a nice consistancy.

Not only is this recipe delicious it is also incredibly easy and fast to prepare (under one hour preparation time). I had the chicken over white rice and it was perfect as the rice did not overwhelm the mushroom gravy. I will be making this again and again especially on busy weekdays when you don't feel like spending hours preparing a meal.

the chicken was very tasty and moist, unfortunately the cooking time approximated didnt even come close to cooking my chicken completely. I needed at least another 5 minutes. I loved the sauce, even though mine didnt ever thicken.
