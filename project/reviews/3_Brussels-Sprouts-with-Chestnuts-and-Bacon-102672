Underwhelming. Followed it to the "T". Just a little bland compared to the other sides. Maybe would add shallots next time. Gave it 3 forks because it was my first fresh chestnut experience.

There was recently a recipe in New York Magazine very similar to this, but with some added zest that made this really spectacular. You add fresh thyme and garlic with the brussel sprouts, and at the end, cook down some heavy cream and maple syrup. Delicious.

I'm giving this two stars because a few dinner party guests quite liked it. I would give it 0 stars as I found the brussels sprouts and chestnuts (jarred) mushy and unappealing. Even bacon fat couldn't save this dish in my opinion!

Excellent recipe - everyone loved it. I poured out most of the bacon drippings and threw some butter in the pan to saute the sprouts, so there was still some bacon flavor but the butter made a nice browning. Chestnuts do add to the taste, but buy jarred if at all possible. The added flavor and visual appeal from chestnuts is NOT worth the huge effort of peeling the fresh chestnuts. My husband and I spent about 20 minutes peeling and my fingers were sore and the chestnuts broke into little pieces. It would have looked much nicer with chestnut halves, so jarred would have been the way to go.

Great combo. I roast the sprouts and chestnuts in oven and tossed in the bacon at the end.

the brussels sprouts were good cooked with the bacon (tho what wouldn't be, really), but the chestnuts didn't add anything interesting. if i were to go to the trouble of peeling chestnuts, i'd definitely choose a recipe which highlights them better.

Delicious, but I didn't think that the chestnuts added enough to make it worth the effort to roast and peel them.

This was ok. Not great, not bad.

This dish couldn't miss with me! I love chestnuts and sprouts, the addition of bacon made it perfect. even my DH , who claims not to be fond of brussel sprouts had 2 servings and said we should add this to our traditional holiday dishes!

This is a classic holiday recipe in our house. I usually debate on making another version of brussel sprouts but always come back to this. I do add a splash of lemon juice or fruit vinergar sometimes with a good result. I love the chestnuts and it's a good way to introduce them into the meal besides in the holiday stuffing. And it is very easy, I nice plus for the holidays.

I did not have fresh chestnuts to roast, so I used frozen chestnuts that was boiled and saved in the freezer. Still the recipe tasted good.

Made this recipe in 1999 and had a request for it in 2001! Was a big hit each time.

Chestnuts were accidentally left to roast for 1 1/2 hours...the dish would be great with chestnuts that weren't hard as rocks. I'll try that next time. Even my two Bouviers liked it.

Loved the bacon and sprouts. The chestnuts didn't seem to add much.

Didn't really care for the chestnuts with the brussel sprouts, however maybe just the bacon would be better.

We loved it! Didn't have as many chestnuts as it called for, but it was wonderful just the same. The bacon and chestnut combo is delicious. I'd definitely make it again.

Made this for Christmas Eve--wish I hadn't. We love brussels sprouts, but not this recipe.
