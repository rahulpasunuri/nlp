I amke this a couple of times a year for special dinner parties. Have found by adding 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour helps keep the pancakes together without making them heavy. I also use a 2lb. grill press I got from Williams & Sonoma to flatten evenly and cook evenly.

Try this...grate your potatos into a seperate bowl and let them sit until they start to turn brown. Squeeze potatos to rid them of all the liquid. Add your remaining ingrediants, plus 2-3 tablespoons of flour. I come from a german background, we had potato pancakes every Friday night and this is how my father made them. Hope that helps!

I don't know if it was just me but 1 egg didn't seem to be enough. The mixture did not stay in pancake forms. I ended up with 2 pan fulls of the most outstanding gourmet hashbrowns with smoked salmon on top!!! I also substituted some of the parsnip with carrot. It was very colorful. The sour cream sauce (I used light sour cream instead of creme fraiche) was great. Next time, I will increase the amount. Although it didn't look beautiful, it was absolutely delicious!!! I'm looking forward to hearing other reviewers.
