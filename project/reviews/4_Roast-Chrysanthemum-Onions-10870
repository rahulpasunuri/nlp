A real hit at our Christmas dinner. I ignored the directions about cutting the onion (which, by the way must be peeled first) and sliced "pie fashion" from the top, leaving the bottom 1/2 inch uncut. I then fanned them out a bit with my thumbnail to ensure that they would open. It was so much easier that way and they looked beautiful!

I think this recipe should be reread by the staff. 450 degrees for 45 minutes plus 30-45 minutes extra uncovered is way too long a cooking time for the size of onions suggested in the recipe. I gave it three stars because of the taste of the dish and I did cut the cooking time. The instructions should read 'cut parallel vertical slices at 1/4 inch intervals around the onion' for more clarity. Another hint, turn the root end up and start the cutting 3/4" away from the root end avoiding any slips of the knife going through to the root end by mistake. To the reviewer to tossed it in the garbage, you could have transformed the onions into French Onion Soup. I never toss anything, I just re-invent it.

I made these to serve with corned beef and cabbage. I used white wine instead of salty, canned chicken stock, which is also vegetarian friendly, as I wanted to know how it would come out without the stock. I also used wine to deglaze the pan and pour the caramel like broth onto the platter and set the onions atop the liquid. Everyone loved this dish! Even the little kids! A diagram would be helpful for cutting the onions though. I had no problems cutting them, but noticed that others did.

I followed the cutting directions perfectly and my onions fell apart in the onion--they just collapsed so I tossed them in the garbage.

This is a wonderful dish that I have made several times over the years. I also serve it as a side dish at summer gathering too. It always draws complements even from those that usually "don't like" onions.

These were great! I made them the day before Thanksgiving, reheated them and they were still excellent! A nice addition to Turkey Day!

This became one of those dishes you slave over and then forget to serve! Such are the risks of Thanksgiving. We enjoyed it, however, with the leftovers, and plan to make it again this year.

This dish was the hit at last year's Thanksgiving dinner. Judging from everyone's response it will certainly become a family tradition.

We first made this recipe for Christmas a few years ago and have made it many times since. It works well with all different sized onions. It is just wonderful - The taste is perfect, the texture is like silk, and they are very pretty.
