R u a foodie? Are you prepared for the challenge? This is not for the faint of heart. I used the raspberry chocalte recipie (CAUSE I DON'T LIKE WHITE CHOCOLATE) then boiled dried apricots in a cardomon syrup. Put the apricots in the layers of the cake with the butter cream stayed with the whit on the outside dark on the inside theme. Hoa doggie! - the work will kill you...no seriously you will wonder are these guests that special? commit or step back from the vehicle - and you can make it eggless - for those vegans. But we reap what we sew - and goodness gracious bodacious......just do it........

Only made frosting and didn't make recipe "as is" so I won't rate it. Used this frosting on a chocolate cake with milk choc. mousse filling. Was great because the cake and filling weren't too sweet with such a sweet frosting. Not a big white chocolate fan and thought frosting would be too sweet and hard if I put in as much white choc as recipe called for. So I only used about 6 oz of white chocolate and it was perfect. Not too stiff at room temp and not too sweet. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Give 6oz a try:)

I have made this cake twice. I don't put the apricots on top or mess around with the walnuts. I also don't bake it as long as suggested. (only 20 minutes in my oven). Just made it again and served it yesterday at a ladies luncheon and it got rave reviews. It is the only non-chocolate dessert I bother to make! (serve small pieces: it is rich)

The cake was delicious, but overall much too sweet. The frosting was nauseatingly thick and rich.

1) Of course it is tooooo sweet if you dont use nuts and fruit.... they are meant to help cut the sugar 2) Please please please refridgerate... there aren't any preservatives in the icing or cake to hold the shelf life 3) yummy, i loved it, i used fresh raspberries and raspberry preserves simply because thats what my farmers market was carrying. you could switch out with any summer fruit really. Be sure to sift to avoid lumps. 4) the sugar and water is used to keep the cake moist and help crumbs from ruining your icing on the outside

Halved this recipe since there are only 4 of us in the house. Should have used parchment in my cake pans, but other than that, this was a pretty easy one to put together. Ignored the sugar syrup thing too, oh, and the nuts. ;) Used less white chocolate in the buttercream, made apricot filling from soaked dried apricots pulsed in the food processor with a dab of apricot preserves, also glazed the top of the cake with a bit of melted preserves. This was a fantastic birthday cake and the best buttercream I've ever had.

Delicious cake...I substituted raspberry jam for the filling between the cake layers and it turned out great.

Very good. Presents really nice. You must eat the whole cake in 1 or 2 days. My sat on the counter for 3 days and it started to mold (also probably better to store in the refrigerator)

I made this recipe exactly as written,and I have never been so impressed with a dessert. The appearance of the cake is just beautiful, and so well worth the effort. I served it at my sister's graduation party,not realizing that someone had already committed to providing the cake. This fantastic dessert completely upstaged the bakery-bought cake with its sweet,silky texture, balanced flavor, and eye-catching appearance. I don't bake often, so this completed cake felt like such a coup for me. You will be hard-pressed to find a dish or dessert that you can be more proud of than this cake.

I found this to be delicious, but I did make some changes to the recipe, primarily to reduce the sweetness. In the cake i substituted almost all the sugar ( 1 cup) with finely ground almonds, giving a nice moist marzipan like texture. I baked them around 23 min, in slightly larger than 9inches springform pans. Next time I`ll probably cut out the sugar entirely. I decided to go with sweetend chocolate in the cake, and semi-sweet (baking chocolate)in the buttercream, next time i`ll only use semi-sweet for both, although whit baking chocolate is hard to find and really expensive. I used canned (compote) peaches and apricots (around a pound of each) and i also added ground almonds to the buttercream. This made it more grainy, but you could still spread it on the cake just fine. For decorating I lined the sides with whole walnut halves, making it look more tidy. And finally I added more vanilla extract to both the cake and cream, around 1 half more of what was in the recipe. This was the first time I made such a time demanding cake, but it was well worth it. It made a wonderful addition to my 25th birthday feast, and everyone was blown away by it. Next time I make it, I`ll try using ganache for icing, maybe with some liqueur and fill it with raspberries.

This was the worst cake I have ever made. The white chocolate Buttercream is too heavy and rich. It is not only time consuming but expensive. Surprised this is in the top 30 cakes.

I attempted to make this with apricots, but they were total mush. I happened to have ripe mango so I swapped chopped mango instead. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough fruit to really go the distance so it was sparse. Otherwise, this is a nice cake for those who prefer a "white cake". The frosting I've used in several other recipes rather than whipped cream frostings, it is great.

I made this for my daughter's fourth birthday (kids and adults at the party)...omitted the nuts and fruit and used raspberry preserves with the white chocolate buttercream between the layers. I actually made the cake in the shape of a butterfly (per her request!) by slicing the stacked layers in half, inverting them (round sides touching) and notching out little triangles on the outside so it looked like wings. Used tinted leftover buttercream to pipe on the designs for the "wings." It was a huge hit - delicious and beautiful and perfect for all ages!

I have made this twice now, both for birthday cakes. First for my son, I used fresh raspberries to top the cake and in the middle layer as well. Phenomenal! The second cake, I substituted the vanilla with 2T lemon zest and the buttercream with 2T lemon zest and 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice. Amazing! Refrigerating the buttercream made a difference. Texture was creamy and smooth! Will continue to rely on this as a delicious birthday cake! Also, I only baked my cakes about 25 minutes. Perfect...

I have made this cake twice. It is incredibly rich, all you need is a sliver per serving. Aesthetically, the cake is awesome. The frosting when chilled on the cake is just so smooth and looks almost like fondant. Really pretty and tasty, but lots of work. Good for spring/summer extravagant picnic.

This cake is fantastic.. I made a wonderful birthday cake - just switched to a raspberry filling .. and I have also used the cake recipe for cupcakes and filled them with a raspberry cream .... delish !!! And the buttercream is absolutely fantastic! It's a lot of work .. but the compliments were worth every minute !

I made this cake years ago... I remember it being good, but not great. The white chocolate frosting tasted great by itself, but then when I put it on the cake I found it too sweet and overwhelming of the other flavors. I thought white chocolate cake sounded really interesting, but I actually couldn't taste the white chocolate in the cake part at all, in comparison with the frosting. I'm still looking for the PERFECT white chocolate frosting recipe... one that tastes sufficiently white chocolatey, but is not disgustingly sweet, and is not so whipped-creamy that it falls apart.... any suggestions?

This is a fabulous cake! It is simple to make and yummy! I added 2 TBS of buttermilk to make it extra moist and boy was it!

This was one of the best cakes I've ever tasted. I used strawberries instead of apricots and strawberry jelly instead of the simple syrup. When the jelly squished out from between the layers, I realized I might as well add some jelly to the frosting (for which I used only one pound of white chocolate as suggested by other reviewers) to give it a pink tint. It was beautiful and delicious!

I needed a white cake for my son's school party and decided to try this one, but w/ out the fruit. (needed a large sheet cake). Whoa.. this is way too sweet on it's own. The rich and sweet white chocolate is too much in the cake and buttercream without something to balance it out. I would like to try this again w/ something a little tart. The lemon and blackberry options sound nice.

This was an amazing delicate yet rich cake! My friend made it for my birthday & I couldn't believe how wonderful it was. I like the apricot filling, but would like to try raspberry too. I'm not a huge white chocolate fan, but this was really lovely.

The cake recipe made the MOST DELICIOUS CUPCAKES I'VE EVER HAD!!!!! It yielded about three dozen moist, flavorful cakes beyone compare. I just finished frosting them with a typical vanilla buttercream, but next time I think I'll add lemon or liquer. You have to try it!!!

I made this recipie as a trial run before I needed it for daughters bday. Since daughter loves lemon I used ourchasrd lemon curd the same way as the apricots. WOW what a flavor nice sweet and tart combo.I could only find Giaradelli baking choc. I thaught the buttercream was a bit too sweet. I will try using less buttercream altogeather. Next time I will serve smaller slices and there will be many next times with variations. Allentown Pa.

I made this cake for a wedding shower and it turned out great...especially the icing - YUM! Instead of apricots, I used one layer of fresh blackberries and blackberry jam, another layer of fresh strawberries and jam. Also added almond extract to both the cake and icing. Everyone raved and I would make this again for sure! Tip: Make sure not to have the water boiling when melting the chocolate.

I made this cake with strawberries. Everyone loved it. The consistency made it easy to work with. I think the buttercream needs and extra touch of flavor - maybe a tbsp. of some sort of liqueur. Will make again.

I made the frosting only, and flavored it with a bit of orange oil in addition to the vanilla to use on an orange layer cake. It was excellent! It did not need as much chilling as called for in the recipe.

To JoJo from San Francisco: What meringue? I don't see any meringue in the icing recipe.

I actually only made the buttercream to go with a different cake that I was making. I needed a white icing so that I could color it, but didn't want to make vanilla buttercream. This is white chocolate buttercream was perfect! It's really tasty, and I don't even like white chocolate! Also, there's no need to pre-whip the butter before adding it to your meringue. I've made this recipe twice with fine results just by using softened butter. With this step eliminated, this is a snap to make.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday with a few adjustments to suit his tastes. I omitted the nuts and apricots, and instead I used Bonne Maman strawberry preserve. The cake part was delicious, just a hint of while chocolate, but the frosting was extremely sweet. It is good, but I definitely needed a strong cup of coffee to go with it, as I am really not a sweettooth. I would make it again with a different frosting. If I was rating the cake without the frosting, I would give it three forks. Anybody have a frosting recipe that would work well with this cake?

i made this dish for my own birthday. it was a hit. i layered a sheet cake and used raspberry filling instead of apricot. also good quality white chocolate is expensive ( i bought lindt and used white chocolate coconut and plain white choc.) so only the filling was white chocolate and the outside was homemade buttercream that was i think damaging to the cake. i will definitely make this cake again but probably use less chocolate in the frosting. definitely a sophisticated keeper.

The buttercream is way too sweet, and the cake is too dense. I will not make it again.

This is a beautiful cake, somewhat time intensive but not difficult to make. If I were to make it again, I would make one layer instead of two - it would be more accessible, and easier to cut and eat. That being said, the full version would be FABULOUS for a wedding or baby shower. It was very sweet but I like it like that!

I omitted the apricot filling because I was cooking this for my sister's birthday and she wanted a strawberry banana custard in the middle. It was a delicious cake and moist. The only thing I would change would be to take a bar or chocolate away from the frosting recipe otherwise it's overly sweet. An awesome cake!!

My mother made this recipe when it came out in Bon Appetit the year my brother Kevin (now 14) was born. She served it at his christening party, and we call it 'christening cake' to this day. When I wanted to serve a fancy cake for a birthday party, I looked for it only to find that the updated version from an issue a few years ago doesn't feature a European (aka cooked) buttercream. I used my own buttercream recipe and paired it with the cake, and because my friend is allergic to most stone fruits I used raspberry puree in between the layers and decorated the top with whole berries. I plated the sweet confection with a pool of a tart warm fresh raspberry sauce, lightly sweetened and accented with lemon, for contrast.

This was the first cake I have every made, besides the sheet cakes that come in a box. It turned out exactly as pictured. I did however, have alot of extra apricots and almost ran out of icing. The cake itself is very moist and the icing is not over powering. A wonderful desert for those that don't like things really sweet. Be sure to take the cake out of the fridge at least 2 hours before serving, otherwise the icing is to hard and the flavors won't blend--Learned that the hard way.

I used the buttercream for cupckaes for kids. It will now be my standard. I used only so-so white chocolate (Trader Joe's chips) and it was delcious and easy to work with (I added food coloring to produce fun colors). I wonder about the preson who said it wasn't sweet enough

Delicious--and looks professionally made. One word of warning: be SURE to use high-quality white chocolate. The second time I made it I used (I'm embarrassed to admit) Nestle's White Chocolate Morsels---big mistake. Made the buttercream very hard to work with---and the texture was somewhat waxy and hard. But with the right chocolate - a smash hit!!!

This is a great recipe. I made it for my daughter-in-laws shower and it was a huge success. I made the recipe twice so I could make a double tiered cake with 4 layers in each tier. I added a few mint sprigs to the top and sides. It was moist and absolutely delicious.

Made this over the weekend. It is very labor intensive, but extremely attractive, especially when cutting slices. I gave it 3 forks because it definitely looks better than it tastes. The taste is so-so, and the white chocolate is a little bland (used high-quality Guittard chocolate, so it wasn't that). Actually needs a little sweetening to the buttercream, but still a nice cake. Loved the apricots.

wow! after finishing this recipe, i felt like a professional. the presentation was so beautiful, i was really surprised. i followed the recipe using valrohna white chocolate and toasted walnuts. it is very important to let the cake stand at room temp at least 3 hours before eating - that's when it tastes its very best. the flavors become ethereal - the tang of the apricot and the delicate silkiness of the buttercream and the crunch of the walnuts!! again i say wow!! and the texture and flavor of the cake was so delicious!

I've made this cake three times since it came out in the June 2003 issue. Rave reviews from everyone. The creamy dreaminess of the white chocolate offsets the tartiness of the apricots and walnuts. I used Lindt white chocolate, toasted the walnuts, and piped a shell border around the top edge. Beautiful and delicious!!

I made this cake for Father's Day. The directions were accurate and easy to follow. I baked the cake and made the buttercream the night before. When it came time to assemble the cake the next day the buttercream was far too hard (from the fridge) and I needed to soften it in the microwave for 10 seconds per cake layer. The end result was beautiful to look at - one of the prettiest cakes I've ever made - but only so-so for flavor (sweet, but nothing more). I wouldn't make it again due to the labor vs. flavor ratio.
