This is wonderful. Used 3/4 cup cranberries and 3/4 cup toated whole almonds and increased almond extract. Cooked a little under 30 min as it helps with ease of cutting and then dipped bottoms in chocolate. Will make a lovely christmas gift!

WOW. Just wow. FABULOUS recipe. I did tweak it slightly by using 3/4 c. cranberries and 3/4 c. pistachios instead of only cranberries, and I did not dip them in chocolate. I just sent some off to two of my friends, and I hope they like them as much as I do!

love LOVE these but DEFINITELY Reduce sugar and cranberries. I swapped in some chopped white chocolate chips for the crans in the recipe and liked that a lot. Even as written, though, its a great flavor. www.homebeccanomics.com

Excellent! Reduced sugar to 1 cup, replaced almond extract with vanilla and added 1 tsp. grated lemon zest.

These are sweet biscotti; some of the reviewers have complained that they are too sweet. I have been making these for about 5 years for Christmas and other special occasions. I get asked for the recipe every time by someone different. I don't always use the egg white wash (it looks nice) and never drizzle with the chocolate- it doesn't need anything else. I have added some chopped almonds, which was also good. Great recipe!

I made this recipe with the following modifications: Used 1/2 c white sugar and 1/4 c Splenda brown sugar. Used 1 c whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c(scant) regular flour. Finally, I added 1/2 cup of chopped cinnamon flavored almonds. Delicious!

This was the sweetest biscotti recipe I've had. These were my modifications: * 1/2 C. Brown Sugar but 1/3 C. white sugar. * 1/2 tsp of vanilla with the 1/2 tsp almond extract. *2 C. Whole wheat flour *85% Cocoa (about 4 squares) of Lindt chocolate and 1 oz of good dark chocolate I keep hidden in my freezer. *1/2 tsp. Kosher salt (it was a bit too salty. Perhaps I'd cut it down further to 1/4. tsp.) *I also divided the dough in half before i kneaded in the dried fruit. 1/2 of it had 1/3 C. Dried Cranberries and the other half held 1/3 C. Dried Sour Cherries. (Orange zest would have went along well, but I have a similar scone recipe and wanted to diverge.) The result was a nice contrast with the chocolate and sweet biscuit. The tartness of the cherries was a good subtle interjection between too much sweet and chocolaty goodness. The cranberry version blended well together. I had them with a shot of espresso with a touch of my tasty coconut creme.

Like some reviewers suggested, I reduced the amount of sugar. I also used 1 cup cranberries and 1/2 cup toasted almonds and drizzled them with semi-sweet chocolate instead of white chocolate. Delicious!

This is a fantastic recipe - I give the biscotti as holiday gifts and always get rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I think the almond extract is a must. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and decreased the amount of sugar and the amount of dried cranberries.

Huge disappointment, I am an accomplished baker and knew as soon as I added the dry ingredients to the butter/sugar/egg mixture that there was too much flour. The batter did not want to absorb it all. Never-the-less, I finished the baking and gave it all to a less discriminating neighbor. My favorite walnut-pepper biscotti has the same amount of butter, sugar and eggs, but only 1 3/4 cp flour. Big difference, This deserved no forks ib my opinion.

This is a delicious base recipe for biscotti. I followed the previous reviewers and used the 1/2 cup brown sugar / 1/2 cup white sugar combo, added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and decided to omit the cranberries for sliced maraschino cherries. The result was something that even my picky, sugar conscious mother raved about and loved. Also, for the chocolate, I added a teaspoon of vanilla extract and Kahlua coffee liqueur syrup for flavor depth. Note- watch the loaves as they are baking - depending on your oven, 35 minutes might be too long.

I have been making this recipe for years as holiday gifts. For those of you who like a little spiced up version. I soak the cranberries in brandy for at least 24 hours if not for days. I do drain them before adding them to the recipe. The other change I made is to melt the white chocolate and dip the one end of the biscotti on the horizontal then dip this in to my coffee or hot coco.

Based on other reviews, I made the following changes to the recipe: decreased the amount of sugar to 1 cup (1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup brown), used vanilla extract, 1/2 cup dried cranberries, and 1/2 cup chopped macadamia nuts. I also added 1/2 cup of white chocolate chips to the dough. With the egg white wash, these turned out perfect when baked as recommended. I agree with other reviewers that these should be cut when still warm to decrease the amount of crumbling. With the addition of the white chocolate chips in the dough, the sugar content could even be decreased slightly. I will be making these again.

I have to admit I'm a health nut, so I substituted half of the butter with ground flax (1 part butter to 3 parts flaxseed), I eliminated the sugar but still used the white chocolate. The flax made them extra chewy and they are still really sweet and delicious!

This is a great basic biscotti recipe to use during the holidays! I used one cup of dried cranberries and substituted in brown sugar for a little bit more moisture. I'd have to agree that you don't need white chocolate for this recipe, its just right on its own with tea or hot chocolate! I decided to put a twist on the recipe by adding 1/2 cup of cocoa and 1/2 cup of chopped almonds instead of the cranberries. It turned out to be amazing and just satisfied the chocolate cravings in the holidays! Happy New Years and thank you for the recipe! ~. Kaleigh

Yummy- I made them as Christmas gifts and they were loved! I made three kinds of treats and these were the most popular. I omitted the white chocolate drizzle and cut down on the sugar and they were perfect. Unless you likes things really sweet I would recommend doing this. I am making another batch today!

This was relatively easy to make and very tasty. I omitted the white chocolate, and cut the sugar down to 1 cup, as suggested. I also used a little less cranberries than the recipe calls for. Other than that I followed the recipe. The dough is very, very sticky. Put wax/parchment paper over top when forming loaves, between your hands and the dough. I had to bake the whole time, plus 5 minutes. I suggest cutting while almost cool, but not while too warm because it fell apart. I brought these to Thanksgiving dinner and everyone liked them.

Rating: 4
This is one of my most requested cookies, and I usually end up making several batches. The first year, by mistake, I put the white chocolate chips in the cookie, and they almost disappear, but are a great addition. Sugar is fine with me, but I usually add some lemon peel and use half almond, half vanilla extract.

Rating: 4
I know when we are getting close to Christmas when I start getting requests for these from friends and relatives. This has become my basic recipe, as the texture and workability of the dough is perfect (I, too, cut the sugar back to one cup). For variety, instead of cranberries, add some dutch process chocolate (1/2 cup) to the flour, semisweet chocolate chips, chopped toasted pecans and the grated peel of an orange. Another option that has worked is pistachios and finely chopped candied ginger. I find that you get a lot less crumbling if you wait till the cookie logs are completely cool when you slice them, and use a serrated knife. These are foolproof!

Rating: 4
I LOVE these and have made them (just the way the recipe calls) every year since the recipe came out. Cutting back a little on the cranberries I can agree with, but everything else is as it should be! Vanilla instead of almond extract changes the whole taste. Its not mean't to be your typical dry slightly sweet biscotti.The white chocolate on top completes the presentation. Yum!! My friends wait all year to get these at Hanukkah and Xmas.

Absolutely outstanding! I didn't have any almond extract on hand, so I used vanilla and it was very good. Adding the white chocolate drizzle made them "almost" too sweet. They're very good without.

After testing three different biscotti recipes, this was the winner. In addition to a great flavor, the dough was the correct texture; not to hard to bite on its own, yet firm enough to withstand dunking. Four of us tested the results and all voted this as the best recipe. The white chocolate I used didn't melt well. I added about 1 tablespoon of butter and two tablespoons of heavy cream to get the texture right. It worked perfectly to drizzle on the biscotti and cooled well.

Wow..these are good! I cut the sugar down to 1 cup, but will decrease it even more next time I make these. The dough was a bit too sweet. I like a less sweet dough so the flavors of the items put in the biscotti can be tasted. I added almonds and good quality chocolate pieces in the dough then drizzled white chocolate on top after they were baked...sinful! These are pleasantly crunchy without being like rocks. Two YUM's up!

I didn't really think I'd like these as I don't love craisins or raisins in my cookies, but I made them to give as a gift. They are surprisingly delicious and next time I'll make more for myself! I made some adaptations based on other reviews. I substituted Amaretto for the almond extract, and reduced both the craisins and sugar to 1 cup each. I cut them while still hot, and for the second bake, didn't bother to turn them over - just left them in for 15 minutes on one side.

This is my third year making this biscotti - and so far it is my favorite on the site. Easy to make, although I cut while still warm and find that 10 + 5 minutes is too long for the second baking step. I usually do about half that. I've done them with or without the chocolate. I like them with one end dipped in myself.

This was gross. I have made biscotti before and bake all the time, so I am not sure what went wrong. Despite all the great reviews, my results were dismal. The dough was very crumbly and hard to form, I cooked the full 35 minutes and while golden, the biscotti was raw in the middle, and the nibble I took- yuck, WAY too sweet.

Rating: 4
These are amazing. I do not add the white chocolate, they are great without it. And I sometimes only cook them once, and they are slightly chewy, not heavy, everyone loves them; they are addicting. They are also amenable to variations (e.g., golden raisins instead of craisins). Really an easy, wonderful dessert.

Rating: 4
I made this biscotti for my "cookie plate" I give out at the holidays. Everyone raved about. The only thing I did differently was added the white chocolate chips into the batter instead of melting them and dipping the biscotti and I added macadamia nuts which gave it a wonderful flavor. The cooking time worked for me but I do feel that the extra 15mins at the end was a bit much and might cut it down to 5 mins on each side next time.

I have been making this recipe for the past two years, as gifts and as a desert served with ice cream. The rave reviews were almost like a standing ovation. It is positively fantastic! I did make two changes. I added approximately 1/2 cup of sliced, coarsely chopped almonds, and added the extra egg yolk (separated from the white). This year, 2006, I used Ghiardelli (spelling?) white chocolate bits and melted them in the microwave. Spend a little more on the white chocolate; it will reward you with a fantastically rich flavor.

I substituted 1 pint fresh cranberries coarsely chopped in the food processor. It turned the batter a pretty pink and yielded a softer cookie. Delicious!

I have made this recipe ever since it came out and is always requested at the holidays. I cut the logs right after baking instead of waiting and bake the second time as the recipe calls for,but eliminate the last 5 min. baking time. I let cool upright and then with pastry bag drizzle over the tops in a zig zag pattern. They look prettier that way and boy are they yummy!

This recipe was so easy and delicious. They were disapearing from my cooling rack. One trick I do when baking biscotti is when I put the logs on the baking sheet I lightly spray with Pam (the one with flour) and put Saran wrap on top, then I shape them and use the Saran for the next one. It does not compromise the flavor at all and your hands stay clean! Great Biscotti!!

The whole family loved this cookie. It's more like mandelbread than biscotti, but either way it's delicious. I took the advice of the many reviewers who suggested cutting the sugar down to one cup and I'm glad I did because it didn't need any extra sugar beyond 1 cup. I didn't use white chocolate because I didn't have any in the house and it was still wonderful. Found a great tip on this site about scoring the logs before they are baked--really made it easy to slice while still warm. This is a keeper.

I thought this recipe was pretty good, but not great. The testure was nice, crispy and a bit chewy, not rock-hard like biscotti without eggs and butter. But the almond extract didn't suit the cranberries, IMO. And there was way too much sugar--esp. with the addition of white chocolate. Next time I'll cut back on the sugar and add orange zest instead of the extract.

Substituted dried strawberries bought at Costco for the cranberries (which I can't stand). The flavor and texture of the biscotti were amazing. Just added 2 tablespoons of vanilla and followed the directions as listed. Left half the biscotti "un"covered, and they were even better than the white choc covered ones! Easy to make and definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe and took them to a party. They went over very well. One person ate a lot of them. I chopped the white chocolate and added it into the recipe. Maybe next time I will try mini-chocolate chips and orange extract instead of the almond extract.

For high altitude cooks the first baking needs to be 40-45 min and the second only 5 minutes per side. This way they come out crunchy but not hard. Also I soaked my cranberries in cherry liquor(Chambord) then drained and added them along with 1C chocolate chips and 1/2C toasted chopped almonds. Took others advice and used only 1C sugar and didn't frost. They were a real hit with everyone.

I've been making these for several years now--they've become a staple in our house. I made this last week, ate about three of them, went to work at night, and came back the next day to find the entire batch GONE! Over 48 hours my 155-lb husband had eaten all of the rest! To prevent crumbling, slice the biscotti immediately after it comes out of the oven the first time. You'll have to protect your hands with an oven mitt, but if you use a really sharp knife you shouldn't have any problem with big crumbles.

Fantastic. I've been making biscotti for many years and have tried gazillions of recipes. This is one of the best, in my opinion. I reduced the sugar to 1C. Egg wash isn't necessary.

I LOVE this recipe, and so does everyone who eats them when i bake them. This time for the holidays i added 1 cup of pistachios. I always omit the egg wash step because i'm just not convinced it's needed. Sometimes i add 6 oz of white chocolate chips to the dough instead of drizzling it on top. Saves time, and is just as yummy. I made one big log and flattened it considerably before baking as opposed to two to make it more like the biscotti you see in the fine coffee shops. Try this recipe.

After reading the reviews, I was confident enough to double this recipe the first time I made it. No regrets! I sneaked some before I put them in the oven a second time and they were already delicious then! I omitted the white chocolate and substituted the vanilla essence for almond essence. Also nuked the butter for 20 sec in the microwave to bring them to room temp. The sweet-tartness of the cranberry defines this recipe. The dough was a little sticky when first mixed, so flour your hands liberally. Other than that, no problems at all. An elegant dessert and a wonderful gift. I made some as Thanksgiving gifts (put them in treat bags and presented them in self-painted wooden boxes) and will be making more for Christmas. Now I just have to keep myself away from them so I have enough to give away!

Without a doubt, the best biscotti I've ever baked. Brought it to Wine Club to accompany our Italian selections. What a hit!

This was the fourth year in a row I have made this recipe for Christmas gifts. Of all the biscotti recipes I've tried so far this is in the top two (Orange Almond on this site is great also). I just add white chocolate chips to the dough instead of icing afterward and that works out very well with less hassle and mess. Since I typically make three types of double batches of biscotti in one day every year that is important to me.

family fav since it first appeared in the magazine. My dad requested it again, so I went online to find it today. I used slivered almonds along with the cranberries. I cut sugar down to 1 cup. I never put the chocolate on as they are sweet enough as is, and easier to package for gifts without the chocolate, but they do look amazing with the drizzle so if serving at home, go for it!

YUM! Some notes: for those of you living at high altitudes, your first baking may take up to 45 minutes. If you substitute dried cherries, like I did, cut them into smaller pieces, whole ones make it really crumbly. I used dried tart pie cherries, if you use Rainiers or Bings, definately cut the sugar. Also if you roll your cherries in flour before adding, they don't stick to each other and adhere better to the dough.

Rating: 4
An great biscotti recipe. You'll need a heavy-duty mixer because the dough is very heavy. Rather than overmix it, add in the last 1/4C. of flour as you knead it a couple times and roll it out. The dough is so sweet that it hardly needs any icing. I will try reducing the sugar by 1/4 cup next time.

I agree with other reviewers that these were great, but a little too sweet. I don't think the biscotti would suffer much from reducing the sugar a bit. I also think this basic recipe would be a good base for other dried fruits, particularly cherries or apricots, which both go nicely with almond extract.

I have made these many times. They always get rave reviews. They are sweet--as suggested by another reviewer, I cut the sugar a bit. I also add pistachios. Yummy. The chocolate looks so pretty when it is laced on top, there is no way to NOT do the chocolate! One big suggestion is to make 3 logs rather than 2 -- they are a much better size with 3 logs.

These biscotti got rave reviews! My initial thought was that they tasted a lot like shortbread cookies but everyone loved them. I followed the suggestion to add white chocolate chips rather than drizzling the cookies with the chocolate and I'd definitely do that again.

Have definitely had better though red cranberries are quite pretty. Substituted lemon extract and added zest from a whole lemon. Specified amount of cranberries was WAY too much, used 1 cup (chopped in food processor) and wish had only used 1/2 cup. Very sweet -- would drop sugar next time as well. Didn't bother with egg white, wish hadn't bothered with white choc chips in dough since they turned brown. Would prob dip in chocolate next time, likely bittersweet. Don't cool too long or will be hard to cut for second bake, think 30 min is about right.

I used only 1 cup of sugar, and added white chocolate chips and approx 1/2 cup toasted, chopped almonds to the dough. Lower the oven temp to 325, the second baking. Also, I spooned the dough between two pieces of Saran Wrap, and formed my logs. When I had the right size, I peeled away the plastic wrap, and transfered to baking pan with no mess! Oh, one more thing: I used three eggs instead of two.

I also used just one cup of sugar, and it was plenty. I find it's easier to slice the biscotti while it's still slightly warm. The seond baking temp was too high, causing the cookies to brown too much for my taste. I baked these twice, on the second go around, I lower the oven temp on the second baking and let it bake until it's crisp. I also added orange zest to the dough, which added a refreshing flavor.

This is a wonderful recipe and have made it annually since it was published. My husband now prefers these to other holiday cookies. Terrific with coffee or alone! Happy Holidays everyone!

The biscotti were wonderful; one cup of sugar was plenty. Using the microwave, I melted white chocolate chips (about a quarter cup at a time) in a zip-lock sandwich bag, then snipped one corner of the bag and squeezed out the melted chocolate to drizzle on the biscotti.

I just made these and they are great. I didn't have cranberries so I used dried cherries instead and then I also added 1/2 cup of pistachios and they are delicious!

These are so good! I used 1 cup of sugar (perfect) and I dipped the ends of a dozen of the biscotti in white chocolate and the other dozen in milk chocolate. Beautiful.

Buttery, delicious and oh-so festive looking! The ideal biscotti.

I'm an avid cookie baker and this recipe takes the cake! I've received rave reviews from everyone who has sampled these. I add pecans to the recipe and skip the white chocolate to lessen the sweetness. I also bake a bit longer second time around to add extra crispness. They're simple and a great crowd pleaser. I highly recommend it as a cookie to bring to all holiday gatherings as everyone thinks they take forever and they can be prepared a few days in advance!

These are fantastic. They've become standard fare at Christmas for our family. My mom and I have discovered a taste for biscotti over the past few years and this recipe is our favourite of all that we've tried. I can't quite figure out why we only make it at Christmas time.

Rating: 4
I found that in hot and/or humid weather, the chocolate takes much longer to solidify. It will eventually. Freezing or refrigerating the biscotti makes them lose their crispness, though. Everyone loves these unconventional/Americanized biscotti, even my friends from Italy. Thanks!

These biscotti are fabulous, but I think they are a bit too sweet. I cut the sugar down to 1 cup. I also added the white chocolate chunks to the batter and didn't bother with the glaze. These get rave reviews wherever I bring them.

I love these biscottis and co-workers seemed to really like them too! I was looking for a good basic biscotti recipe, and this was it. I substituted dried cherries for cranberries, and added chocolate chips. I also added a little extra almond extract. I didn't use the egg wash or drizzle chocolate. This is the type of recipe that you can flavor any way you want, and add whatever you please (vanilla, orange, lemon, nuts, dried fruits, chocolate...) I made this recipe once and the dough was too wet. As a result, the logs did not hold their shape. I made it a second time with an extra 1/2 cup of flour and this worked much better. I would recommend that the dough be a stiff cookie dough and add more flour as necessary. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
Delicious! Very sweet. NExt time I will reduce the amount of sugar. I used "Cherry Craisins" and doubled the amount of almond extract. I've found that "Bakers" white chocolate melts easier that white chocolate chips. The white chocolate is not necessary, they are so good with or withhout it, but it makes a nice decoration and an added flavor. Could definitly make these for a housewarming gift or for holidays.

Yummy! Had I known biscotti was this easy to make I would have done it ages ago! I had trouble melting the white chocolate chips so I just spread them on. I also melted some bittersweet chocolate so I would have a mixture of white and dark. These are nice and sweet, but not too sweet.....

Yummmmmmy! I don't even bother with the white choc dizzle for most days, but it's great for gifts with it. I try to keep these in my biscotti jar at all time. My friends and family love them.

This Biscotti is great. I throw mini chips in the batter and omit the coating. Makes a wonderful hostess gift.

Instead of dipping the biscotti in the white chocolate, I just add white chocolate chunks into the batter. Not only does it make less of a mess, it taste better too. I also underbake it a little so it has more of a cookie texture-people love it this way.

These were good and easier to handle than the double chocolate biscotti on this website, but I added the white chocolate to the batter, and I didn't like that change. It would've been better drizzled on top.

Rating: 4
This is a very good recipe. One small comment... don't over cook the white chocolate, and if you do, just add a TBS of oil or butter to the hard chunks and it will loosen nicely. In a pinch, these are pretty good even without the white chocolate, but it certainly adds an opulant touch that is nice.

Rating: 4
Super Yummy, better than the bakery...AND easy. I doubled the PURE almond extract and threw the extra yolk from the egg white in there. Melting the chocolate is the hardest part. Drizzle with a spatula, its easier than a fork. Had no idea it was so easy. I'll be making Biscotti all the time now.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. I reduced the sugar to just over a cup and added 1 cup dried Cherry flavored craisins, 1/2 c. mini semi-sweet morsels, and 1/2 c. toasted sliced almonds (instead of the white choc. and cranberries). It was delicious. I always omit the egg white wash.

I made this for the first time during the Holiday season and my family loved them. I followed the recipe the first time, cutting back on the sugar and cranberries as suggested by others. The second time I added the full amount of cranberries, almost all the sugar and added some orange zest and orange extract. The orange/cranberry combination was delicious. Both times I omitted the white chocolate though. Will make again as they are great with tea.

This recipe is fabulous and very easy to make. There are a couple of thoughts that I would share. 1. They are pretty good if you don't bake them the second time. 2. They are good both with and without the white chocolate drizzle. They are a bit sweet with the white chocolate. 3. They are also good with dark chocolate. 4. We have mixed in chocolate chips and they are very good that way too.

This was wonderful biscotti. I made them yesterday for gift giving. I used dried apricots and toasted chopped almonds. I drizzled them with white chocolate and bittersweet. They looked and tasted great. I cut back on the sugar and limited the dried fruit to 1 cup.

This was an excellent biscotti recipe with lovely results. Simple to make and pretty to present, these are worth making for holiday gift baskets.

My first (and very successful) foray into biscotti-baking. Based upon others' recommendations, I did make a few changes. I only used 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of dried cranberries, to cut down on sweetness. I also added 1/2 cup of finely ground almonds into the flour/baking powder mixture. These looked beautiful with white chocolage drizzled on top, and they disappeared (into my husband's stomach) before I could bring them to the party I made them for!! Will definitely make these again.

Rating: 3
Great and easier than I expected. Very sweet, so must reduce sugar to 1c. I also prefer fewer cranberries, about 4 oz. Cutting the biscotti while warm seems to help reduce crumbling and breaking. Also, the chocolate was hard to drizzle, so I will try the suggestions below on thinning it. The white chocolate was very sweet, so I prefer to use bittersweet chocolate.

Rating: 4
You have to try this recipe if only to see if you like the chocolate inside the cookie or drizzled on it...or both for those with a great sweet tooth. If for no other reason...piping the chocolate onto the biscottis makes these a wonderful Christmas cookie to give as presents. THey look AND taste wonderful...truly YUMMY. I only make them once or twice a year because I could eat them all myself. ENJOY

From the Bay Area. Had a baking day w/ a friend who found this recipe here. We did everything as written except skipped the white chocolate. I, too, think it is sweet enough without it. We also made a gingerbread biscotti that will look more festive w/ the white chocolate. Everyone is asking for the recipe. We had no problems w/ cutting, crumbling; it was still warm. And I do like the look (sheen) of the egg white. I'll probably add that step to other biscottis. Thanks for expanding my repertoire! This will become a regular favorite.

A delicious new idea to biscotti. I decreased the sugar to 1 cup, added the zest of one lemon, and about 1/2 cup toasted almonds. If you cut the bars while slightly warm, turn on side,put back in turned off oven for just 5 min,it helps. I also melted dark chocolate with 1 tsp shortening and dipped one end. A yummy treat for the holidays

I included these in some cookie gift boxes I made & they got great reviews from everyone who tasted them!!! Following suggestions of previous reviewers, I cut the sugar to 1 cup, & added the white chocolate chips directly to the batter. I used dried cherries instead of cranberries, because that's what I had, and skipped the egg white part because I ran short of time. They looked fine anyway, and it made the recipe even easier, especially for such great results. Now the pressure is on for the next cookie box to live up to these high standards!

THis recipe is wonderful-- a real keeper. I took some advice from others, and the result was extremely tasty. I used amaretto instead of almond extract, which I forgot to buy. I also mixed the white chocolate chunks into the dough rather than dizzle on top of the cookie.

I've made this twice already and love this recipe. It's very easy- just make sure that you let the loaves cool completely before cutting them or they'll crumble quite a bit. These are a little more sweet than most biscotti I've had, so I cut down the sugar by a couple of tablespoons and omit the chocolate- it doesn't need it!

Rating: 4
P.S. Cut the sugar down to 1 cup and Cranberries to 1 cup. It's plenty! Excellent suggestion.

These tasted wonderful (used the white chocolate chips and less sugar) but I had a hard time keeping them from breaking into pieces as they were cut and then turned during the final baking. Any suggestions?

Absolutely delicious, with or without the white chocolate drizzle. I've made these biscotti several times, and each time I've had very good. Excellent integrity (the logs cut easily into clean slices), nice light texture. A little on the sweet side, so I'd cut down on the amount of sugar a little. Also, be careful melting the white chocolate. I find it best to heat the water until it is barely warm enough for vapour to form. I melted the white chocolate over simmering water once, and it became pasty and dry.

Great recipe. Made it as gifts for Christmas and was well received. Even people who don't like cranberries were raving about this biscotti. Personally, I found the recipe to be way too sweet and next time will cut the sugar by a third.

This was my first venture into biscotti making and I couldn't be happier! The recipie creates a sweet and not-too-hard version, although they might have turned out softer had I not increased the third baking time to 10 minutes. The base recipie is great and I will use it for all of my future variations.

I thought this recipe awesome, I read the other reviews so I bought white chocholate almond bark, melted two squares in the microwave and drizzled it on....easy, maybe it doesn't need it for taste but it is more impressive.Also next time I'll add only l cup dried cranberries...it was plenty. these are great!

I have made many biscotti recipes and this is THE BEST. The almond flavoring is what, for me, makes it so special. I added ground almonds to the dough to enhance the flavor and texture. It was wonderful. The white chocolate in ribbons on the top of the biscotti is a very elegant touch.

In agreement with the popular opinion expressed here, we LOVED these biscotti. I put the white chocolate on about half, and they're delicious either way. As a variation, I'm going to add some grated lemon zest and use lemon juice instead of the almond extract next time, as I like the lemon/cranberry combo.

This has become a favorite around our house. Both my mother and father in law beg me to make this and send it to them. I skip the white chocolate. It's really not necessary and doesn't add much, in mine, my mother's and father in law's opinions.

These were delicious. But they came out a tad less crispy than biscotti should be. I will try again and increase the time on the second baking. I didn't have enough dried cranberries and so I supplemented what I did have with currants and it tasted just great.

I tried the suggestion with dried cherries and dark chocolate! Delicious. Also, for those watching saturated fat content, I substituted half of the butter with canola oil, mainly since I had no sweet butter and needed to reduce the salt. Also substituted 1/3 of the sugar with Splenda (a sugar substitute). My kids love them and they are almost gone after one day!

These were great. I had no almond extract and substituted orange oil. A good combination with the cranberries, I think. The texture was better than a lot of biscotti: they don't crumble when you're slicing them. I didn't melt the chocolate in a double boiler but used a microwave. I took the advice about thinning out the chocolate with evaporated milk. It worked!
