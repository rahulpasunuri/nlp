These are great little puffs to accompany champagne! Do not forget to increase flour to 1 CUP. I added pinch of cayenne pepper and used Asagio cheese. After mixing in flour I used my mixer with paddle attachment to beat in the eggs which really makes the prep easy and quick. I made the dough a day in advance, covered and refrigerated. Next day completed baking the puffs. Definitely a quick, easy & impressive appetizer.

Love these!!!

Just made this and they really are delicious. I used 1 cup of flour and stirred the flour ball for about 2 minutes even though it balled up after a few seconds. Next time I'll use about 1/2 the salt but overall a hit.

Made these with 1 cup of flour and served with champagne, oysters rockefeller. Very nice.

I have made this recipe 3 times with great results. the extra flour is a good idea. (i cup instead of 1/2 cup) gruyere cheese makes me think of fondue, so i add alcohol to the batter at the end. peach brandy is what i have on hand now. 3 to 4 Tsp seems right. pear brandy, sherry, a bit of almond extract perhaps.

There is an error in this recipe - use 1c flour and these will come out perfectly!

Absolutely DEVOURED at a bridal shower... even if we overcooked them a tad (VERY golden brown). Mixture took longer to form a ball than we were expecting, but everything came together beautifully with a little patience. Highly recommended.

I have used this recipe for a couple of years now. It is always a hit at every party. I have substituted different cheeses for different flavors. Asiago is always a great hit. Easy to make!

These were dry, bland and utterly uninspired (not to mention, a waste of perfectly good gruyere). As another reviewer suggested, maybe using bread flour rather than all purpose will solve at least the texture problem - only one of the many woes of this dish!

I've made these numerous times and guests love them. Instead of 1/2 cup flour, increase to 1 cup, sifted flour. I add a dash of cayenne and nutmeg. You can add chopped herbs too.

Admittedly, I had problems with these the first time I made them. However, after becoming more experienced with making cream puffs, I realized that I needed to apply the same techniques to this recipe. So after cooking the flour mixture in the saucepan, I placed everything in the food processor and blended until smooth and shiny. With this slight modification, they came out perfect and everyone, including my husband and children loved them. As another cook stated, don't give up on this recipe just remember you're really just making a savory cream puff.

Don't give up on these!! it's not my recipe, but I do make these often. The recipe is wrong, you should use Bread flour, not AP!! Bread flour contains more protein which will take care of all of your texture problems.

This recipe is wrong! I tried it twice and it does not work. The batter was too thin, so as soon as they were placed in the oven, they became long instead of puffed. I wasted time, energy and money on this recipe twice! If you are going to post a recipe make sure it works!

I am just trying to duplicate the gougères @ bay boulangerie in San Farncisco so I can stop spending all my spare time trying to get a parking place near there and buy them! This recipe is pretty close, but even though the puffs puffed enough, they were too soft in texture. I will try a larger flour amount and see if that does it, will report back with results.

There was no "poof" in these puffs! I made them for a party while on vacation in Atlanta, maybe it was because of the humidity? They turned out really lousy. Will take off my list of things to make again.

I was really disappointed how bland and flat these came out. No puffing here. Perhaps I would use more cheese and dijan for some pizazz (and taste) but I don't think I will make these again.

I was REALLY looking forward to making (and eating!) these, based on the delicious ingredients and the rave reviews. Unfortunately, they were very bland to me and not a great texture.

I'm just browsing here, but I make these a lot and sometimes add bacon or bits of certain vegetables or go heavier on the spices or change things around a little. Its really important to have the oven temp right and to not open the oven and check them. Also, DON'T crowd them on the baking sheet. Give them more room than you think they'll need because when they bake and puff up, steam escapes and if there's plenty of room between puffs then the steam from one won't be shooting onto another (making it less crispy). It's really imortant to take your time and not cram them together on a baking sheet. Hastily, most people put too many on a pan.

Well... not sure about this one... took to a Memorial Day cook-out yesterday. Everyone said they liked them (none were left).. however, you have to eat them almost right out of the oven. I noticed by the time I got them all baked, the first couple batches weren't as good. Also, I doubled the recipe since I didn't think 40 would be enough. Mine didn't 'puff' as much as I would have liked. They were nice & light though. Probably will make again (I might add a little more gruyere than the recipe calls for)... something was just 'missing' to me! But, like I said - everyone said they were good and there wasn't any left!

These were wonderful! I made the puffs the day before my party, froze them, then reheated in my oven and they tasted just as delicious.
