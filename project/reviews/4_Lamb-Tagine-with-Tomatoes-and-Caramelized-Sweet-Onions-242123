My wife made this recipe as outlined in the recipe. She used canned plum tomatoes which made it a little too watery. The first day it was served over rice and the flavor was just OK. However, the second day the excess liquid had absorbed and the flavors had melded. We served it over couscous and it was outstanding! Recipe may benefit from being made a day ahead. ENJOY!

Very hearty dinner. Added carrot sticks and handful of prunes 45mins twds the end and that gave it a denser and sweeter flavor. looking forwards to leftovers tonight!

This is so delicious. It even tasted delicious without the tomatoes. A few changes I made: sauteed the 3 cups onions and browned the lamb before simmering, used homemade chicken stock instead of water, added sweet potatoes, diced summer squash and garbanzo beans, used canned plum tomatoes. Truly a keeper!!!

i've made it with sweet onions and yellow onions. it is delicious every time and a fairly forgiving recipe if you need to adjust to the amount of lamb/tomatoes you have on hand. just don't under caramelize the onions - they make the dish.

Fantastic! Healthy alternative to traditional lamb stew. Added few garlic crotons. Quite tasty!

I made this recipe with a few substitutions: beef instead of lamb, canned diced tomatoes instead of roma tomatoes, and omitted saffron. It came out great! I have made this meal twice and both times i loved it! I put it over brown rice. My boyfriend even liked it and he doesn't like onions! I highly recommend this dish!

I made this with beef and it was delicious! I omitted the saffron and used canned tomatoes instead. It was really yummy and easy. The caramelized onions make all the difference! My partner loved the dish as well. We put it over quinoa. I can't wait to make this again!

Everyone just loved this recipe. I added diced carrots as I thought it needed more veggies and colour. Will definitely make this again and again.

Really wonderful. I was too cheap to buy saffron and it was still very flavorful. The caramelized onions are off the charts. They make the dish.

This was quite tasty. The lamb was very tender from the braising. I ended up with bone-in stew meat so had to cut it off the bone and probably only ended up with two pounds...I also threw in a cubed sweet potato since I had one at the same time as the tomatoes. Two of my tomatoes went bad before I could make this so I added a can of crushed tomatoes...I think this was a happy accident because it made the stew very sweet. Don't skip the caramelized onions, they really make the dish. I got eight servings out of this with rice...but we're not huge eaters. Very economical too.
