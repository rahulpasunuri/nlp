My family is from Taiwan and I made this recipe for my father's birthday. Everyone was very impressed. I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I added sesame oil to the dipping sauce.

This was pretty simple and very tasty. The chicken was super juicy and the dipping sauce works really well with it. I would definitely make extra sauce though. I served it with cumin-scented herbed rice from this site (I had a lot of scallions and cilantro to use up). Yummy!

This was great - simple, flavorful and satisfying, and there's something amazingly comforting about the smell of the poached chicken that fills your house. We poached the chicken the day before so it could be a weeknight meal the next day. We used Canadian Bacon instead of Smithfield Ham. Don't think it adversely affected anything.

i personally have never made this dish, but its a common one we make all the time at home. and when i go back to china, i've had it with live chicken that was bought earlier in the day at the market. and i've also had the mistake of having this dish made with the frozen wholesale chicken you might get at albertsons, trust me, there is NO comparison.

I followed this recipe exactly and yielded wonderful results! I would double the sauce in the future. We loved the sauce so much that we used it up so fast. The flavor of the chicken was outstanding and even kept well as leftovers. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone!
