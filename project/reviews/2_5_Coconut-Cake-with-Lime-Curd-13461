The icing was a big gloppy mess. There is obviously an ingredient missing. I made the icing twice and it didn't work. The cake was too dense. The only thing I liked was the lime curd. Big disappointment.

I used the Coconut Layer Cake from Bon Appetit 1999 with the filling and frosting from this recipe and the combination is perfect. The frosting does need cream of tartar but the combination of the sweet boiled frosting and the lime is incredible.

Being a very nervy cook I made this cake as one of three tiered cakes for our wedding. (Small - just 40 people) I used a mango filling rather than lime curd. I made Buttercream Frosting with a little coconut extract and pressed toasted coconut into the sides and a tropical fruit display on top brushed with melted apricot jam. My husband is originally from India so I wanted some of the flavors at our reception to be reflective of his culture. It was very good.

This cake was really something to look at, and very tasty, too. But making the frosting made me coco-NUTS! It simply would not hold without 1/4 tsp cream of tartar--inexplicably omitted from the recipe.

I was disappointed in this recipe. The cake was more dense than I anticipated and found the frosting to be overly sweet.

Unbelievably delicious. I bought lime curd rather than make it myself, and it was hard to find.

This was interesting, but not quite what I had in mind. The cake is definitely of the pound cake variety, and didn't quite fit with the fresh flavor of the lime and coconut. I might make it again using a more typical white cake batter.
