We loved this! I added half of an onion with the chicken in the oven. Kept that righht in the gravy. Hubby asked me to keep it in rotation.

Every time I make this, I am asked for the recipe. Since finding it in Bon Appetit, I have been a raving fan. This is my absolute FAVORITE chicken recipe. Please don't make any modifications... it's perfect as it is.

I made this for dinner tonight and thought it was awful. The chicken took much longer to cook than it said it should (and I went an extra 10 minutes off the bat to begin with and it could easily have gone longer for some of the inner parts -we just microwaved them). The flavor was dull even though I used fresh Penzey's chili powder. The gravy was strange. The skin was anemic looking. After taking my first bite, I apologized to my husband who was graciously choking down some bites so I wouldn't feel bad. I'm a very good cook and this is absolutely the WORST Roasted chicken I have ever made. Went to bed hungry last night. I'll never make this again.

This has pretty much become my standard roast chicken recipe when I need to make something quick and easy. I've made it a bunch of times; it's simple, full of flavor, and the "crust" seems to keep the chicken breast nice and moist. I recommend experimenting with different chili powders if yours is too old and/or bland. Mine has a pleasant kick, but is not too hot.

Rating: 3
Despite the amount of chili powder in this recipe, I somehow was under the impression that it wouldn't turn out that spicy. Boy, was I wrong! It's delicious, but be forewarned that's it's a little on the spicy side. That chili powder really soaks into the chicken while it's baking.

I have to say I am disappointed. After reading all these reviews, I thought it would be better. The flavor was ok. I followed the directions, added the lime and still just alright. My husband and I both prefer the WW Garlic Roasted Chicken with gravy recipe MUCH better. Too bad....I thought I had found a winner here.

Delicious! I made the recipe with bone-in chicken breasts and they turned out perfectly. I didn't have sage but it didn't seem to matter; the gravy was the perfect complement. Serve it with potatoes and a vegetable and it's a great family meal (I'd say it's okay for most kids - the chicken was flavorful but didn't have a lot of heat).

Rating: 4
Further to my review (below), anyone who says this recipe is bland must have used a poor quality chili powder. I use one of the following - a hot, spicy chili powder, chipotle or ancho chili powder. I also sometimes add cumin and, if I don't have chili powder with sufficient flavor, I add cayenne. I substitute olive oil for the butter for health reasons, with fine results.

I love this recipe! It has become one of my stand-bys because it is easy and has tons of flavor. I do find it challenging not to over-cook the garlic.

I've made this recipe many times and it is always fantastic! I've read some of the below reviews and am amazed at folks saying the rub didn't do much for the chicken. Quite the contrary in my opinion; I love spicy and flavorful foods and this is high on my list of favs. Super nice.

Rating: 3
My wife and I thought this was very good. Tasty, spicy, and comforting. Would definitely make this again, the gravy alone was fantastic, and the chicken was easily up to the task. Very moist, and it did need longer than stated to finish cooking through. There were a few modifications: I did manage to mistakenly put in 3 teaspoons flour in the rub, instead of tablespoons, and I substituted half the butter for olive oil. I also spread some rub under the skin of the bird. So, no chalky coating on ours, and the skin was nice and crispy. I also didn't have plain chili powder to hand, so used hot chili powder with good results, if just a touch on the hot side.

Rating: 4
I defintely like the use substitution for olive oil for butter. the butter made the rub to pasty. The skin of the chicken worked out nicely with the olive oil. the sauce was a hit at a friend's dinner party/

The gravy was wonderful, but the rub didn't do much for the chicken. My fiance liked it, but I thought it was bland. I think I might try it with chicken breast next time to see if the flavor of the rub will set better.

I have been making this recipe for a couple years now, and it never fails to be my favorite way to roast chicken. And the gravy just makes it so much better. But, beware... you MUST love garlic to make this one!

Rating: 2
I followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came out the way it was supposed to.... BUT we didn't care for it very much. Guess you have to be a chili lover. My husband who eats any type of chicken anywhere said he would mych prefer the herb roasted chicken over this any day. So I would not make this again. A tip for the rub, soften the butter for a sec in the microwave. Then the flour and chili blend very well.

Rating: 4
I have made this at least three times and it is always excellent. The last time, I inserted a lime sliced in half into the cavity, and trussed the bird as suggested by another reviewer. I also added a little bit more chili to the gravy. I agree that if you cook the butter and flour for one to two minutes longer until golden, your gravy will be perfect. Finally, try using softened butter versus melted to make the chili rub which made it easier to rub on the chicken.

Rating: 4
I tried this for the first time today and it was absolutely delicious. Even the breasts were moist, though I only basted once. The skin did not get crispy but the flavor was outstanding, and the flour-based rub was NOT chalky or funky as the reviewer from Oregon said. I put two limes (sliced in half) in the cavity as another cook suggested, which added a wonderful note. Since I like my food spicy, I also increased the amount of chili powder in both the rub and the gravy. The gravy was superb--I cooked the flour/butter a bit longer than a minute, until golden (it's a basic roux, so the darker it gets, the more the flavor develops). Just keep stirring! I also used homemade chicken stock (made from the wingtips, neck, and giblets of the last chicken I roasted). Finger lickin' good!

I was very disappointed in this dish. Although the hot chicken was moist, the garlic and chile didn't seem to spice up the meat. The sauce was okay; however, deglazing was a terrible idea and completely ruined half of it (I tried half as written, half in the deglazed liquid). The family voted this "OK", but there were lots of leftovers. The skin never really got crisp, and it and the outside of the chicken was bland and rather rubbery the next day. There are many better recipes on this site.

This was so easy,out of wine but still delicious. Son wanted seconds & daughter thought it was the best chicken she ever had. Love the gravy! Will try it with olive oil next time.

I made quite a number of changes so please read this as a suggestion rather than a true review of the recipe. I used chicken breast instead of a whole chicken, red pepper flakes instead of chilli powder and cornflour instead of normal flour. I wasn't sure how the butter, chili and flour mixture could be easily spread over the chicken so I melted the butter in a pan over low heat instead and poured it over the chicken breast. Next I seasoned it with the red chili flakes, salt and some sugar and pepper. I turned the chicken a bit to coat it more evenly. Next I dusted it with the cornflour and again turned it to coat it evenly. I roasted the chicken breast for about 30 minutes at 180 degree celcius (slightly less than 375 degree Fahrenheit) with the garlic cloves. Despite the various changes, it turned out pretty delicious and crispy on the outside. I may even reduce cooking time slightly.

Rating: 3
we thought this was delicious. the only problem was the flour/butter/chili mixture left a chalky, funky tasting coating on the skin, even after i furiously basting the last 15 minutes. oh well! who actually eats the skin these days? gravy was WOW!

This dish is absolutely delicious. I've even made it using boneless chicken breasts. It's super easy and a hit every time!

Very good recipe as written. One important thing that I'll do differently next time is to remove the bird from the fridge and allow time to take some of the chill off before applying the chili/butter mixture. I am very aware of the salmonella risk so I'm not talking room temp here. Because the chicken was so cold, the mixture solidified and didn't spread very well. Definitely deglaze the fond on the bottom of your roaster to use in the gravy. Great with any potato side dish.

Rating: 3
We liked this a lot! I too added the limes and used some of the juice in the gravy. I'd recommend the gravy by itself for other meat dishes.

Rating: 3
makes a wonderfully tender chicken with a crispy skin. My picky sig. other loved it, and he even said it was the best chicken I have ever made. He loved the gravy. I did the gravy slightly differently-- I didn't add the roasted garlic because mine got overcooked, but I did add shallots and scallions to the pan at the beginning, and then I deglazed the roaster and used the pan juices in the gravy. I think that flavor was what allowed it to survive without the roasted garlic. It's a quick, easy dish-- not my favorite, but it certainly goes over quite well

Adding the limes was a great idea! Delicous recipe and really great gravy.

Rating: 3
This recipe was very good as written. Recently, I tried putting a few limes (cut in half) in the cavity of the bird before cooking and the resulting gravy was outstanding. Chili, lime and garlic are fantastic together. Check the bird temp before removing from the oven if you stuff the bird with limes. It may take a little longer to cook than an unstuffed bird.

Rating: 3
Very good. I did make a major substitution, though. I omitted the butter entirely and just used a little olive oil. I also sauteed the giblets etc. with onions and threw them into the roaster with the chicken, along with some onions and celery, then after the chicken was done deglazed the roasting pan and used it for the gravy.

Tried this with cornish hens and reduced the cooking time slightly. Very good!

I'm saying yes conditionally. I think I'll try New York, 3/26/02's experimental suggestion next. The chicken is good, but too greasy. The sauce/gravy is what gives this a rating of 3 - it is excellent and can be made with 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. I made chicken broth with the giblets and wing tips instead of using canned broth.

Moist and wonderful. Double the chili powder in the gravy; It needed more of a kick. The gravy took about 13 minutes to reduce.

I thought the chili rub was good and the roasted garlic gravy was great. The sage added subtle complexity to the gravy. I had to add more flour to get the gravy to thicken.

I made this last night and it was delicious and easy. I also put half the rub under the skin and the rest on top of the chicken, and I think that made a big difference. Cooked the chicken exactly the amount of time listed and it came out perfectly. But the gravy was the best part... you can really taste the garlic. My boyfriend said I can make this anytime!

i thought this recipe was absolutely incredible! my fiancee couldn't stop eating it. the only real change i made was using olive oil (instead of butter) for the rub. i forgot to baste the chicken and it still came out really juicy and flavorful. and the gravy was out of this world! this recipe is incredibly easy to make and really good, i highly recommend it!

Rating: 1
I was underwhelmed. The combination of flour, chili powder and butter does not make an interesting rub. I didn't like the flavor of the gravy either. All the flour required in this recipe should have been a tip off. But the name of this recipe was very enticing and most of the other reviews sounded so glowing. I need to repeat for emphasis: This recipe yielded unpleasant tasing results. In order to satisfy that craving for a chili rubbed chicken, I think I'll just experiment with rubbing a bird with an improvised paste made of olive oil, ancho and chipotle chilis. That's the ticket...

Rating: 2
Wow, I thought I'd found the Holy Grail when I read all the great reviews for this recipe. I made it exactly according to the directions, and was highly disappointed. The chicken didn't get crispy (even though I used butter instead of oil, as one cook suggested) and I had to cook it MUCH longer than directed, even though I only used a 3 1/2 lb. bird. Overall, I came out with soggy chicken with a gravy that was more weird than spicy. I'll stick to my old roast chicken recipe.

Rating: 4
Outstanding roast chicken! I used Wondra Flour in the rub and gravy, so the flour doesn't clump. Also added 15 garlic cloves and 1/4 c. vodka instead of white wine. We love garlic and were out of the wine. It worked beautifully. The gravy makes the dish!

My favorite recipe from Epicurious so far, and the finest roast chicken that I have ever made. I used medium-hot ground red New Mexican chile, and it was just right. I found that I needed to heat both the chicken and the chile mixture in the oven for a few minutes to get the mixture to spread. Served it with Julia Child's mashed potatoes. Just wonderful.

Rating: 4
Fabulous roasted chicken recipe! The chili flavor is very subtle so if you want it firey hot add more spice. We love spicey but this is so flavorful just the way it is. The gravy, which is to die for, can be made anytime as it is not 'tied' to the roasting of the chicken. I roasted my chicken in a convection oven and it was soooo moist. I did add a little more garlic and the gravy took longer than 8 minutes to reduce. I can't say enough good things about this recipe.... I served it with Portobello-Layered Mashed Potatoes from Cooking Light and Green Beans with Hazelnuts and Lemon from Gourmet.

This was very good, although not as spicey as I anticipated. The gravy is delicious - I didn't have any white wine on hand, but it still seemed to work.

This was the best roast chicken recipe I've ever made! I left out the aniseed and used Olive Oil in place of the butter. The rub went under the skin as well as over the skin, and I made the chicken in my Showtime Rotisserie! The gravy was to die for, and totally made the meal! I used half chili powder and half ground New Mexico chile and added a bit more cayenne to the gravy. Used the leftover chicken to make the White Bean Chicken Chili from Epicurious and got two wonderful dishes! Highest rating!

Good recipe; the chicken turned out moist and succulent, wonderful flavor. Found that the flour/chili powder mixture tended to "clump" on the chicken, so I added some olive oil to the mixture. Definite addition to our rotation of entrees.

Rating: 3
Very good. I had a problem with the butter in the chili rub congealing when it hit the cold surface of the chicken, leaving clumps of the rub on the surface. Next time I'll leave out the butter, put the chili rub on dry, then pour the melted butter over the chicken.

At the last minute I wanted to stay home for my birthday with a roaring fire on a rainy night. In the morning I put the rub on the chicken and peeled the potatoes. Total prep 15 minutes. When I came home and popped it in the oven the house filled with a wonderful aroma and I felt like someone had made me the BEST birthday dinner. My husband was seriously moaning while he ate this. I put some rub under skin and the rest on top.

I just made this dish today for my husband. I used Spanish extra virgen olive oil instead of butter and also used hot paprika instead of the chili powder. I think if I had dried mexican chili powder, I would have used it. I also added an extra head of garlic and put it inside the bird. It turned out crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The gravy was the best part and my husband said he hasn´t eaten so well in a long time. This dish will be a keeper.

Excellent recipe. When I first took the chicken out of the oven, I thought it looked dry and wondered if I had done something wrong. Well, to my surprise, it was very moist and wonderful. The flavors of the rub are so well matched with the garlic gravy. This is a definite "permanent file" recipe!

This recipee was fabulous. It turned an ordinary roasted chicken into something very special. I served it with mashed potatoes and I made a very simple bread stuffing.

Excellent. Tried this in my new Sharp convection microwave on high mix power for one hour in a pie plate atop the broiling trivet. It turned out fabulous! I recommend using butter, not oil, for crispy, delectable skin and basting every ten minutes after the first 1/2 hour.

Wow! This was fabulous and my husband can't stop raving about what a great cook I am. Win-win, don't you think? My modifications: add 1 teaspoon cayenne to the spice rub; use boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of a whole bird; use 2 tablespoons garlic flavored olive oil instead of melted butter for spice rub; use a whole head of elephant garlic; puree the gravy in the blender then add minced chives; serve with mashed potatoes, a simple green salad and french bread. Very, very good meal that's impressive enough for company (but isn't a lot of work).

The chili-roasted chicken with roasted garlic gravy was good, but I would recommend rubbing the mixture under the skin and increasing the initial roasting time to 50 minutes. We enjoyed this dish with a stuffing side dish but I think the best compliment would be croquettes or boiled potatoes.

Great recipe and super easy. As others have said, it wasn't too spicy which is what prompted me to attempt this dish. I substituted the butter in the spice rub with olive oil for health reasons. Also instead of rubbing the outside of the chicken with the rub, I put it under the entire skin. We cooked the chicken in a foil pan in the barbeque. I will definately try this again and I think I will add the potatoes as another contributor suggested.
