Very Nice recipe. Did not explore other reviews before making. If not already mentioned, add celery & 86 the mushroom.

Great recipe! Instead of crushed red peppers I added 1 jalapeno (this was great the night of, but left overs were almost too hot to eat). Will definitely make this again!

Very good and easy recipe for a weekend nite. Left out the mushrooms because I did not have them on hand and added extra cayenne. Very spicy but in a good way.

This was so easy to prepare, perfect for a weeknight dinner w/some zing. I like spicy food and only used 1/2 t of the red pepper...so I would suggest adding a little to start and then you can always add more.

VERY, VERY GOOD. PERFECT HEAT. ADDED MORE SHRIMP ALSO. SERVED IT WITH ANGEL HAIR BECAUSE WE LOVE PASTA BUT I THINK IT REALLY BELONGS WITH RICE. TO THE COOK WHO COMPLAINED ABOUT CHOPPING....GET ONE OF THOSE ONION CHOPPERS THEY ADVERTISED FOR A LONG TIME. YOU CAN GET THEM AT BB&B. CHOP EVERYTHING EXCEPT THE GARLIC IN ALL OF 5 MINUTES. (NOTE: DON'T TRY TO CHOP A HALF OF ONION. SLICE THE ONION ABOUT 1/2" THICK AND THEY COME OUT IN UNIFORM DICE.)

Excellent recipe. Inexpensive and easy to make for a dinner party. Increased the amount of shrimp as suggested by another reviewer.

Spicey? Sure, but "super-hot" is stretching it. Be careful with cajun seasoning, the more you add, the more salty it becomes - that is if you want it spicier. All-in-all, simple, easy, tasty recipe.

We made a double batch. Leftovers were served with the addition of pan seared scallops. Came out much like a chiopino. Very good!

I've made it couple of times with both shrimp and cubed redfish fillets. The cajuns sometimes call this a Kubiyahn (not spelled right). Regardless, authentic flavor, easy to make, nice spice level (not "super hot"). I'm Lousiana raised and this is as good as I have ever found especially for the effort.

Yawn. I absolutely love spicy food and I am a huge fan of shrimp, but I was dissapointed with this dish. I was skeptical about the mushrooms as I was preparing them. I think they added a weird dimension that I did not appreciate.

Top notch. Made one with cubes of redfish and sausage. Lick the bowl.

This recipe was good, but "super-hot"? Enh. Maybe to someone who doesn't eat a lot of spicy food, but this spicy food-lover, it was pretty mild. Next time, I might double the amount of crushed red pepper, or add some fresh habanero.

I did as recommended and added one diced jalepeno and andouille sausage. It was very good and I would make it again. I found that the quantity was closer to 6-8 servings.

This was great! Added EXTRA seasoning because I love spicy food and most recipes are very conservative (heat wise). Very healthy and easy will definitely be making this again!

I made this for my husband and son on Fat Tuesday and used the total amount of spice recommended. While the sauce was cooking down, I ran to change my clothes from work. I came back to find my husband standing over the pan, stirring it, smiling. Well when I served it, he actually started sweating! Apparently he thought he would try kicking it up a bit with more pepper flakes while I was changing. He loved it (too hot for my son)but will surely stay out of the kitchen for a long time.

This was awesome- simple, fast and delicious. It's not often that I pass recipes onto others, but I've already emailed this one to three friends. A great weekday dinner that's healthy and flavorful- Hooray!

I had to double the ingredients (there were 8 of us), so there was a LOT of chopping involved, I thought my arms were going to fall off, but it was well worth it. I LOVE spicy food, and think this could have been even a bit hotter. Next time I might try adding some spicy andoullé sausage or chop up a chile pepper or 2 (or 3!) as well.

I've made this recipe a couple of times now. I followed another's advice and reduced the creole seasoning to compensate for my dining partners taste.

A great dish to make if you are a spicy food fanatic. I loved it and will definitly make it again.

i added teh full amoun of cajun seasoning and crushed red pepper, and the heat was fine (i like it spicy) but the cajun seasoning made it too salty. i'd use less cajun powder and control the heat with the crushed red pepper.

We added the full amount of pepper flakes and Cajun seasoning, and the heat was just right. Hot, but not unbearable. I bucked the trend and decided to serve over angel hair pasta instead of rice. For those who complained of a "canned" taste, I used Muir Glen tomatoes with good results. Fabulous dinner, and so easy!

Easy to make, with outstanding results. If you love hot food...this recipe delivers.

This was a fun dish to prepare. I also added uncooked scallops which I tossed in with the oil, onions, mushrooms, garlic and green pepper and stir them up for few additional minutes and followed the rest of the original recipe, adding the shrimp after the sause thicken up as indicated. I made white rice and poured the stew over it. It was so delicious and all can be done within an hours time. It was a hit with friends. You can definately OD on this meal!! Enjoy!!

My husband and I love spicy food but I made the mistake of leaning toward the high end of both the cajun spice and the red pepper flakes and the sauce was so hot it was inedible. I actually put an extra can of tomatoes in it and it was still too hot. Luckily I hadn't added the shrimp yet so we ended up with stir fry instead! Beware the heat of your cajun seasoning!

This was a tasty and easy dish for dinner last night (and lunch today ;-) ). After reading some of the reviews posted, I reduced the tomato to a 14.5 oz can of Rotel Extra Hot, plus a small can of tomato paste, thinned with chicken stock. I used some Adobo plus a couple of Potebello mushrooms in place of the white. Added cayenne liberally as well. It was dynamite!

Delicious! I like pretty spicy food and found this to be not particularly spicy, but we devoured it anyway. So quick and easy, too. This is definitely a keeper, and next time I'll try it with boneless chicken breasts, then maybe scallops ...

My husband thought this was excellent - nice flavor and spicy - I made my own creole seasoning from "Emerils" recipe. Will definately go in the Tried, Tested and True recipe box

Middle-of-the-road creole. Tasted like it was made-- canned.

Bleh! This was horrible! I ended up throwing the rest of it down the drain. The horror!

This was an excellent, simple dish to prepare. In addition to the hot peppers listed, I added a diced jalepeno, as I believe my seasoning wasn't very hot. I omitted mushrooms and added a red bell pepper and carrots. It came out delicious, and seems to be fool-proof.

Very good recipe,I started on the mild side but this was to mild so I added hot sauce to taste. I think I'll go with more mushrooms next time and scallops sounds like a good idea.

Wow this was hot and I only used 1/2 tsp dried red pepper and 3 tsp cajun seasoning!

This dish was excellent. The best Shrimp Creole I've made so far. We didn't find it to be particularly hot though and I suspect this had something to do with our Cajun seasoning. If you read this and know of a good one, please share!! Enjoy.

Wonderful recipe. We don't like mushrooms so we just took those out and we spiced it up pretty hot. We also added scallops which were good, but the prawns were even better! We would DEFINITELY make this again!

HOLY COW!!!! This is a great recipe, I have altered it a bit, with red & yellow peppers, fresh tomatoes. Even if you don't like hot food, try this, you'll love it! (just tame it down a bit)

I adapted this recipe by adding one chopped sweet red pepper to the onion mixture. I also added leftover baked ham and 1-2 teaspoons tabasco. Wow, delicious! I'll definitely be making this again.

THIS IS A GREAT RECIPE. WE LIKE IT HOT AND SPICY. WE ADD EXTRA SHRIMP TO ENHANCE THE RECIPE

I have been looking for a shrimp creole recipe for a long time and i have to say that this is by far the best i've found yet. I like my creole extra spicy so i use the 1 1/2 tsp. of pepper. I love to serve this over angel hair pasta it's great . Thank You Tom
