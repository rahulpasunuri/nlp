This recipe is delicious! Rubbing the garlic halves on the bread after it is toasted makes a big difference.

Very good and simple to make. The lemon zest really boosted everything. Will definitely make again! Perfect appetizer for a wine party.

This appetizer is so easy and delicious -- everyone just loved it! It's something you could make about 1/2 hour ahead of your guests arriving with no problem.

Pan grilled the bread instead. Omitted garlic because I love burrata and did not want to overpower its subtleness. Lemon zest is key! Delicious!
