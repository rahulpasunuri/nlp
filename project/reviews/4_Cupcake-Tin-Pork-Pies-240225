As others suggested, I diced then sauteed the onions. I used panko in place of the bread crumbs. I added 1/2c grated carrot, plus a few spoonfuls of leftover creamed spinach (minced) that I wanted to use up. In addition to the fresh sage, I added about 1/2tsp of dry. Served these with Roasted Winter Squash and Parsnips with Maple Syrup and Almonds, and a green salad with avocado, grapefruit, and beets.

Really great recipe. I had been craving some pork pies and these came out just right. Personally I like to eat them cold and think they taste better after sitting in the refrigerator for a day. I've posted some pictures http://www.jaywalk.net/images/pie1.JPG http://www.jaywalk.net/images/pie2.JPG

The food was great, but be warned. Folding the dough into the cupcake pans is very difficult.

This was so much fun to tinker with and really hearty yet attractive too. I added chopped apples, a little rosemary, garlic, shallots and some minced carrots, and I added some pork sausage to the mix too. Because I thought it might be a little too fatty, I browned the meat first and added the sage and rosemary after draining, and sauteed the vegetables in a separate pan. Then I combined them and added a good dose of dry white wine. Delicious! I did find that 4 inches wasn't nearly wide enough for the bottom of the pies, so I eventually used a plastic cup to cut the circles for the bottom and used the four inch circles for the lids. Served them with homemade peach chutney.

This makes a good pork pie on its own. It's simple and tasty. I prefer to change up recipes now and again, and this is a great base to work with. I add in a little paprika and applesauce as well. The applesauce ever-so-slightly enhances the flavor and makes it moister. It's okay served hot, but it's also good served cool (not fully chilled) on a hot day. I just love this one!

My fiancée made these last night and they were amazing. He added fresh roasted garlic and used a whole wheat pie crust from the refrigerated section. They were a hit for our dinner party. Plus, mango chutney on the side. Yummy!

I made some changes including using rosemary instead of sage and adding some sauteed diced half of an apple, as well as 3 strips of chopped bacon. The apple didn't add flavor but I assume helped maintain moisture. The pork flavor was a bit strong. Halfway through the pie it was kind of overwhelming for me, but the family liked it. Next time I may use more herbs or even try using half of another type of meat (beef or turkey) to add flavor and lighten up the pork. This definitely seems like something you would make for a party or gathering because as a center piece for dinner, it's a little too much of high fat meat to have multiples (imo).

These are an awesome party food1 They're just the right size to eat easily with your hands. I made them for a Halloween party as "the worst meat pies in London" (Sweeny Todd) and they were a big hit. I used fresh rosemary instead of sage. I sauteed diced granny smith apples, onions, celery, garlic, salt, pepper, and mixed apple sauce and a little olive oil into the pork mixture to help with the dryness. I also made my own pie crust. They were super moist and delicious. I will definitely make them again and again!

We wanted to make a meat pie to fit into a 3-pie dinner for six. We made some modifications recommended by other reviewers. It worked out well. We cooked bacon and sauteed the onions and apples in the bacon drippings before mixing with other ingredients. We put in a tablespoon of dried sage (it was strong but okay) and added a tablespoon of chopped fresh marjoram (it was nice). We added red pepper flakes which worked out nicely. We were concerned about dryness, so we added a few spoonfuls of applesauce and doubled the egg. To our delight, the meat ended up moist enough. We cooked the pies in six medium sized ramekins (~1 1/2 cups). Our pie crusts were really sticky and in spite of the flour did not want to come off the wax paper without breaking, so we had to break pieces off into the ramekins to line them and then again for the top. This actually worked out fine to our surprise. They came out looking pretty good, too. We cooked at 375 for between 30 and 35 minutes. Despite all our changes and problems, this worked out nicely and was well-received. It's a good and flexible recipe.

I think I've made a few improvements. I saute the onion with diced granny smith apples and celery. I also add a pork seasoning mix of rosemary/fennel/salt/pepper sold at Urban Herbs- available on line. And finally, I initially made Minor's Pork Gravy for a topping and add a bit to the mix along with the egg to boost the moisture. They were ok-to good as written, but even better with the additions.

I made this dish into a rustic pork pie using a refridgerator pie crust and placing all the filling in the center of the crust. I then folded the crust over (it did not cover the filling entirely) and then baking for an extra 15". It cooked beautifully, and sliced without any problem. My family loved it.

This recipe is a real winner. I was so surprised at how flavorful the pies manage to be with so few ingredients -- plus they are adorable. If you have had "pasties" in the UK, this is a great approximation. The suggestion to add a finely chopped apple to the mix is a good one. Also, I cut out the same size disks for the top and bottom and found that they worked well in my oversized cupcake tins.

I was really looking forward to this recipe - but was pretty disappointed. It wasn't horrible, just edible. I sauteed an apple with the onion, and added some garlic and extra spices, and it was still quite bland. The filling was thick, mushy, pasty, and visually unappealing. They might be better with some sort of gravy. I won't bother with these again.

I usually make this with rosemary because the first few times I made it, there was no fresh sage in Whole Foods. Then I made it with sage and realized I actually preferred it with rosemary. This is always a crowd pleaser and guests are always making off with my epicurious print out of this recipe!

I made this as one pie, with home made dough. It is very nice, hubby kept cutting more! It does lack a little something in the spicing though, although I added garlic and more sage. Perhaps a pinch of chili, some sweet pepper? Something...

I've made this twice and they are awesome. With a small rice bowl, I cut 4 circles from 1 pie shell, re-roll the scraps and cut 2 more circles. I rolled these circles wider and fitted these into the cupcake tin. I pushed in some meat filling into the cups and pinched/wrapped the overhanging pastry around the top (looked like how some dumplings are pinched at the top). Very fast and easy (once you get the assembly down).

I have made these twice and I love the flavor - will try sauteing onions and adding apple as some recommend. I did also have some trouble with the pastry - first time I used top and bottom pieces - but it didn't look too "pretty", next tried with larger circle and folded over top, still not so hot - any tips?? I also think they would be great in small muffin tins as appetizer/party dish.

I made these just last night and they were delicious. I did increase the sage as others had suggested and added approximately ¼ to ½ cup of applesauce. I had exactly enough to make 12 little pies. I made my own pie crust and didnt have any trouble rolling out and cutting the tops and bottoms, my regular cookie cutters come in the recommended sizes. I did use a 3 cookie cutter on the top as I really like crust. We will be having these again soon.

I added a little over double the sage. Also sauteed the onion along with half a Gala apple to help with moisture. Used Italian bread crumbs. Had the perfect amount of dough for 12 muffin size pies and everyone loved em! Going to try these with a healthier meat next...maybe ground turkey!

This is a delicious recipe, especially with ample amounts of sage. However, my mum and I used to make something extremely similar when I was younger- pork and baked beans in a pastry shell, done exactly the same way- the recipe book called them "Cowboy Pies". I have to say that that combination will always be my favourite, they're especially cold!

i got excited to make these after reading all the reviews, but i thought these were just ok, not that great. i found them to be bland. if i made them again i'd definitely add more sage, and i'd probably saute the onion before mixing everything together. also, they weren't *that* easy to make. the lining-the- muffin-tin-with-dough step took forever, and required searching high and low for something to cut 4" circles with. (i don't know of any cups that big. i ended up using a small bowl.) also, i found that 2 9- inch pie crusts were definitely not enough for the 12 pies. just thinking about it - six 4-inch rounds out of each 9- inch round - it doesn't make sense. after lots of rerolling, i was able to squeeze everything except for the last six 2- inch tops out of it, but i had to go back to the grocery store to finish.

I really enjoyed these! Made them for an Oscar night celebration in honour of Sweeney Todd. Served with a Savory Apple Sauce which I found on this site and made at the last minute as a side dish so it was still warm. Delicious! Leftovers were great the next day reheated in a toaster oven. And the day after that cold for lunch! I sauted the onions with apple as suggested and they were not dry at all. Also used 4 in. rounds for the base & 3 in for tops. Tonight I am going to try them with ground turkey!

My family was skeptical also but as soon as they tasted them, they were hooked! I made no changes except that I used generous amounts of fresh sage and freshly ground pepper. I used fresh bread crumbs and I think that may have helped make them nice and moist.

Excellent dish. Easy, too! Didn't really take long. I actually made it as one larger pie and cooked it 15 minutes longer, as suggested by another reviewer. Because people thought it was a little dry, I added a couple of large spoonfuls of unsweetened applesauce and a bit of cream of mushroom to it. Turned out even better! It was moist without falling apart. Perfect!

I made these for a party in the fall and they were fabulous. I doubled the recipe using italian sausage, and also added fennel and some fresh rosemary. I agree that these turned out a little dry, but I think next time adding chopped apples into them will make a difference. I also did half with poppy seeds on top, and thought they were better. This is great for parties, warm and easy to eat with your hands. I will definately make these again.

These were very tasty and surprisingly easy to make. They were a bit on the dry side. I had made a cream of mushroom soup the day before and that made an excellent gravy. I also tried some raspberry jam mixed with water and heated with red pepper flakes. That made a nice contrast as well. Not sure which I like better. I will definitely be adding these to my recipe rotation.

As portable as a sandwich as a make-ahead lunch. I used ground turkey, which worked really well, and Italian breadcrumbs. The filling AND the crust were only enough for 9 pies. Still, tasty!

What a winner! I took these to a potluck and got wonderful feedback on them. I also sauteed the onion first, and I cut it in very small dice. And I cut an apple in fine dice and sauteed it before adding to the pork. I found that I needed additional pie dough and needed the circles larger. I think you could roll the pre-rolled dough out a bit to make it go further. I was stumped by the cupcake tin size (two 6-cup tins? aren't most 12- cup tins?), but found that normal-sized muffin tins are what is called for. I doubled the recipe and that worked nicely. This was delicious.

I have made this dish twice now. The first time, I made it as written plus some shredded apple as suggested by another reviewer. I didn't really care for it, but I'm not a huge pork fan. It tasted too "gamey" for me. Eager to make this dish work, I made it again but with ground chicken instead of pork. I also didn't have any fresh sage, so I used poultry seasoning as a substitute. DELICIOUS! Served w/ roasted rosemary potatoes & asparagus, it was a hit w/ my entire family - 2 year old included.

This were really tasty, and very easy! I made the recipe exactly as written, except for adding ~1T of italian spice blend (rosemary, basil, oregano, marjoram). I thought they were delicious! I just cut larger bottom pieces and folded the edges over the meat for simplest preparation and this worked great and wasn't fussy at all.

These were great! I took the suggestion to saute the onions first, and added some garlic. I was also liberal in the use of the fresh sage and pepper. I served them with a brown pork gravy and it was a nice addition. My husband was also skeptical when he saw dinner sitting in a muffin tin pan, but he loved them! They were also quite good as leftovers.

I also used Italian Bread crumbs and I thought that it added a little extra flavor. I will use more black pepper next time too and make a good gravy to serve along side. This was so good. My husband had his doubts when I showed him the recipe, but we both loved it! I didn't bother cutting the rounds, I just filled the tin with dough and folded the dough over. It may not be as pretty, but it was easy and gave a more casual presentation.

Yummy. Used extra lean pork (4% fat) with good results. Agree that the dough lining is a bit time consuming and that a 3" top crust works better than 2". I had to use a coffee cup to cut out the 4" bottoms.

An easy receipe that tastes great. I just took them to a potluck and they were gone in a flash! I doubled the receipe, used dried sage (1/2 of what's called for), and added minced apple. They are very tasty and would be good the next day as well.
