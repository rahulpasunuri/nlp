Just made this for dinner. It was really easy and tasty. I didn't have all exact ingredients, so improvised and still was good. Great for a week night meal if you have kids on different schedules.

I just made this tonight and it was delicious! I used stew meat and london broil. and braised it like some of the other commenters. I added the garbanzos in the laST HOUR OF COOKING. iT TOOK 3 HOURS AT 300 DEGREES. The meat was tender!!!!. I could not find golden raisins at the store so I happend to have dates on hand. I chopped them up and used them instead. Worked out great! I also added a can of diced tomatoes. The flavor of this stew was amzing! The cumin and the cinnamon really changed upo the everyday beef stew my family is used to

I used stew meat, but otherwise followed the recipe ingredients. I browned the meat, added the veggies, spices, but then I decided to braise and put into a slow oven at 250 degrees for 3-4 hours. I added the garbanzos with about an hour to go. Added the cilantro and lemon just before serving. Turned out great! ,

Whenever I make a new recipe, I always make it exactly as the recipe instructs. Reading the recipe, I certainly was tempted to let it stew longer, use a cheaper cut of meat or cut back on the cinnamon. But I HIGHLY recommend making it exactly as written. It was one of the best things I've made recently - and perfect, just as is (and i never think that!). The flavors come together brilliantly in that short amount of time. If you would like to make something more budget friendly with a cheaper cut of meat, why not find a receipe that is created to do that?

What a flavorful stew! Easy to make and real depth of spice and balance of flavors. I subbed the lemon peel for a teaspoon of preserved lemon and it worked wonderfully. I will add this to my recipe rotation, for sure.

This is a yummy and easy meal to make and cooks up relatively quickly, especially for a stew. Using an expensive, but tender cut of meat helps substantially with the quicker cooking time. This recipe is a keeper.

Used stew beef cut into small pieces and marinated it a day ahead using the spices in the recipe (replacing garlic with powdered). Added an extra carrot and omitted the olives on cooking day. The called for spices were used despite the marinated meat. Great looking and loved by kids. The extra BONUS? I reserved some of the stew before adding the beef: a great vegan meal over rice (of course, you'd have to use a vegan broth flavoring).

I used wild boar instead of beef just to make it a little healthier. I simmered it for 4 hours, playing around with the lid on and off so that the juices would concentrate but it was still the consistency of a stew. It was delicious with wild boar... I would try other game meats and adjust the cooking time accordingly. I omitted the garbanzo beans, both because I'm not a huge fun and also it didn't seem like it would add much in the way of flavor.

Interesting to see an old Gourmet recipe has done the rounds! Understandably - it's a great recipe but needs stew meat and long, slow braising for intense flavors. Adding the carrots later is indeed wise.

Had to shift gears when I saw that tenderloin at our local Whole Foods was close to $30 per pound. The butcher recommended a less expensive cut. Increased cooking time to 3+ hours braising in a 225-250 oven. Recommend that you saute the carrots but leave out of the pot until the last hour or so. Meat was tender, flavorful--would make it again.

i made the mistake of buying beef chunks for stew so i made the following changes: cut each chunk into smaller pieces, only cooked for 1.5 minutes in beginning of recipe and simmered the entire stew for an hour. this helped tenderize the meat somewhat but was still a bit tough for my liking. the other changes i made: 3 cloves of garlic, 2 carrots, only 1 lbs of meat, 1 tbsp of cumin, 3 cups of beef broth and 2 tbsp of tomato paste. the flavors of this dish are wonderful and i'll definitely make it with tenderloin next time!

As recommended by several others, we changed this recipe for the sake of economy and personal taste, and the result was delicious - the perfect meal for a rainy fall evening. We made this recipe with beef sirloin, 2 large carrots, 1.5 Tbsp paprika, 3 tsp cumin, a scant Tbsp cinnamon, the peel of a whole lemon, and additional beef broth to thin it down. We also served it over whole wheat couscous, which was a good complement to the dish. The only thing I might change for next time is to cut the olives in quarters instead of halves, as they stood out too much in terms of saltiness. Overall, highly recommended!

Rating: 4
The flavors in this dish were amazing! The only thing I did and would not do again is use stew meat in place of the tenderloin (its what I had on hand). I'm not a fan of frying small pieces of beef since it can sometimes be tough. Next time, I'll follow some of the suggestions and it with chicken or ground beef. But definately a recipe keeper!

This recipe was amazing! Incredibly easy to make. I used 1/2 tenderloin and 1/2 sirloin which I cooked for 2 hours. I omitted raisins because I hate them but also used preserved lemons instead of the lemon peel. Other than the above there is nothing I would change about this recipe!

I made it with chuck and it was really good; I imagine it would be phenomenal with tenderloin. Add the cilantro at the end, more as a garnish. I might try it with currants instead of raisins next time, but not because the raisins weren't delicious--just out of curiosity.

Fabulous! I used bison instead of beef (had the butcher at Whole Foods cut up some of the shoulder meat for me)... it was so tender and vey low fat (and cheap!). I also added a can of San Marzano tomatoes and some tumeric and coriander. I made a day ahead, refrigerated, and reheated slowly in the oven the next day. Will definitely make again!

Delicious! Tenderloin is very expensive, so I used have tenderloin and half sirloin. The tenderloin tasted 5 times better, so if you can afford it, use it! I used dried dates instead of raisins which was a great substitute. I especially liked the flavor of the lemon peel and kalamatas. Will make this again.

Wow, this was soooooo easy and soooooo good! Followed recipe exactly and wouldn't change a single dang darn thing. Olives are essential! Definitely one to make again and again. My friends loved it. Leftovers are MINE MINE MINE MINE! Not sharing this one! Sending recipe though! LOL!

This was outstanding! Absolutely incredible. I can't say enough good things about it. I've already shared it with a dozen people and plan on making it again next week! I omitted the olives, and added extra paprika, cumin & cinnamon. After bringing it all to a simmer, let it sit in the crockpot for an hour or so. Next time I'm gonna leave it sit all day! Served over rice and paired it with a Merlot.

Made essentially as directed but used stew beef, cooked in liquid stove top without lemon and cilantro for 35 minutes and added those sprinkled on top. Really lovely light stew for those "transition" months in Spring and Fall when cold but not heavy stew worthy. Will definitely make again!

Delicious, simple, and relatively quick. I was sort of rushed on time, but in the future I would probably let it stew longer. I used a cubed stewing meat, which was probably tougher than tenderloin, but overall the dish was great. I also skipped the olives and added a bit of tomato paste.

Rating: 4
Wow, this was a surprise. Very interesting flavor. A bit of sweet, a bit of savory. The only change I made was to braise the contents for an hour after following all other steps in the recipe (except I added the cilantro just before serving.). This is being added to my recipe book.

This was a nice twist on the usual beef stew. I cubed rib-eye steak and finished it off in the oven at 350 degrees for about an hour until the meat fell apart. I added the lemon peel and cilantro at the end and cooked it for another 5 minutes on the stove top. I served it with cous cous.

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was a hit! I didn't use carrots and don't think you really need to. My major mistake was using beef for stew, so the meat was not what it would have been had I used a more tender cut. A novice error. Next time (and I will try this one again) I will either use sirloin (as some have suggested) or lamb! Yum!

I made this once before and found the cinnamon too strong. This time I liked it much better with just 1/2 tsp. cinnamon. I also ommitted the olives and raisings and added some potato. I threw in a bit of worchestershire sauce, a little balsamic vinegar, and soy sauce. That probably sounds like a lot but it tastes good!

I love Moroccan cuisine, and this was fabulous! I followed all the steps except added two Yukon gold potatoes and cooked in slow cooker for 6-7 hours, and served over couscous. The only thing I would have done differently was to add the raisins and olives at around 4-5 hours into cooking time.

This is a terrific weeknight meal. Very flavorful. I generally make a new recipe "straight" the first time before playing with it. This one is good just as written. It is REALLY important to BROWN the meat in small batches so that you end up with a lot of fond in the pan. Also be sure to cook the spices as directed. If you do these things you will end up with a beautiful rich brown gravy and a delicious stew.

There are too many ingredients in this recipe. Morrocan food is not about mixing many ingredients/spices that look oriental. In Morocco, nobody mixes carrots, raisins and olives. But, good try!

This is a very good, simple recipe for an easy dinner . . . just add crusty bread and a nice big salad. I added the tomato paste that so many reviewers recommended plus a little red wine. I used sirloin so increased the cooking time to about one hour. I added a couple of cups of baby carrots for last 20 minutes or so. It was long enough to cook then but no so long that they fell apart. Don's skip the carrot in the earlier step, though. You need it for flavor.

Rating: 3
This is a delicious recipe that doesn't have to be as expensive as it looks. I think the reason the writer recommends beef tenderloin is because it takes less time to cook to tenderness than stew meat would. There's a happy medium available at a third the price: sirloin. I've made it both ways, and the sirloin was just as good and just as fast to make as the tenderloin. I recommend doubling the carrots.

This stew was a big hit at one of my dinner parties recently. But I did make a few changes. First, I used a finer cut of meat, which was exceedingly tender, and added a demi glace for flavor and to supplement the sauce. I also went light on the chick peas and served the stew over couscous.

Great recipe. I also used tomato paste, one tablespoon and left the raisins out, one pound of Beef, a half-pound of lamb, and a half pound of buffalo. I slow cooked the stew for three hours since I used organic stew meat and the meat came out tender. Next time I will use potatoes instead of carrots.

My family loved this one! I did make a few changes. I added one diced sweet potato to the vegetables, I didn't use olives (so you will need to add salt to taste) or garbanzo beans, used dried plums instead of raisins, and added two tablespoons of brown sugar. I simmered for an hour. YUM!!!!!!!!!!

Like others, I found it necessary to play around with the ingredients. I added the tomato paste everyone was raving about - seemed to work. I also used a full 1 litre of beef broth which absolutely was necessary. I also simmered for a lot longer in order to braise the beef.

I made this recipe with a few small changes, and multiplied it by three to serve in our pub. It was a great success and left the diners wanting more. I used braising steak and halved the size of the butcher's cubes, added tomato puree as suggested, used canned pineapple chunks and incorporated the natural juice from the cans into the stock, together with some red wine. Because of having to prepare one portion without onions, I added a few raisins and chick peas instead of the onions on this one. Served with apricot couscous and spicy Moroccan vegetables (recipes also from this site) the World Food Evening was a great success. We were even able to round the evening off with Moroccan Baked Fruit Dessert served with thick double Jersey (Channel Islands) cream.

Thanks Ann Gillespie! I loved the fragrant and subtle harmonics here which improve with keeping.

This dish was really good 3 1/2 forks. I had to make some changes due to time constraints and ingredients available. I knew I would have time to cook during the day but wouldn't have much time before the meal. So, I was searching for something I could cook in my crock pot. I made this with a rump roast that I cut into pieces and placed in a crock pot for 6 hours. I added a generous amount of S&P to the meat and browned them with a little of beef broth in the pot for about 2 hours. Then I added 2X onion and garlic. Cooked that for a couple of hours then added the spices (which I doubled). I added the raisins, cilantro and olives for the last 30 minutes (didn't have the beans or lemon). It didn't need the extra broth but I did throw in a couple of tablespoons tomato sauce (I didn't have paste) and frozen peas at the end. We thought the end result was pretty yummy. We liked the surprise of sweetness from the raisins. I don't generally like stews or pot roasts b/c I had some really awful ones as a kid but this recipe proves that a tasty flavorful meal can be made in a crock pot (even if it wasn't meant to be). Thanks Ann for the great ideas!

Totally blown away by this recipe- fast, healthy, and great tasting. I used beef stew meat, which made it a bit tough and lengthened the cooking time of the meat, but still good. I mixed golden raisins with dried cranberries which gave it a great tang. I also added 1/2 tsp more cinnamon and served over basmati rice. Great great great dish!

This stew is delectable! I made it once before leaving out the olives, because I had none, and it was great and hearty over rice. Tonight, we doubled the recipe and added more broth, more carrots, and tomato paste to make this more of a soup. My husband and I loved it even more. We will definitely make it again.

I doubled the beef broth and spices, which helped, to make this dish for a potluck at work, which I heated and served in a crockpot. I added, to the leftover portion that I took home, some tomato paste, as others had suggested, and WOW--that really helped the flavor! It didn't really add a tomato-y taste, just sort of "focused" and sharpened the good flavor already there. I'll make this again, but next time, will try a cheaper meat; at $10 a pound, sirloin is just too expensive for stew. Also, I think I might add the raisins right before serving, as their flavor was nearly gone in the finished product.

Made this for dinner last night with only a few minor changes. It was very good. I used 2 carrots instead of one, and closer to 31/2 c. beef broth than 2. Followed the advice of others and added about 2T tomato paste. I also coated the beef with flour before browning, which I think helped thicken the stew at the end. I think using tenderloin is worthwhile. You could also probably increase the spices a bit. Oddly, I served it with cous cous as shown, and thought it detracted from the stew. It soaked up too much sauce and diluted the flavor. Maybe next time with some crusty bread on the side instead?

Rating: 3
In the interest of economy, made this with beef stew meat. I used the same cooking times called for in the recipe and the meat came out, as you might expect, really tough. But we loved it anyway! Next time, I'll probably try cooking it longer, using lamb stew meat and some nice green olives (instead of kalamata). A crockpot might turn this back into a weeknight dinner!

Rating: 2
Used stew meat and it came out pretty tough even after an hour of slowly cooking... probably needed to adjust the cooking time to much longer in order to compensate for change in cut. Towards the end, I thought the liquid was still too brothy and added some tomato paste to compensate. I thought it was interesting, but I will not be making it again. As suggested by one reviewer, I can defintely see how, if the meat were excluded, this could be a very good vegetarian dish.

Rating: 0
i made a lot of changes to this recipe, so i won't bother with rating it, but i think others may find my changes useful. i used about 1/2 lb less meat, stew meat instead of tenderloin, half lamb and half beef, and i made the meat pieces smaller. i also increased the amount of vegetables (i'm also a grad student!) - two onions, three plum tomatoes (sauteed with the onion), four cloves of garlic, a pound of butternut squash instead of one carrot, and black beans instead of garbanzo (didn't have a can of garbanzo on hand). i also added 1 tsp. turmeric to the spice mix. and i used twice as much broth - enough to cover it all in the pot. the end result was pretty good, but actually i'd go further with these changes next time. the balance of spices is right-on. but the lamb tasted WAY better than the beef, to me at least, so next time i plan only to use that. despite the changes, i thought there was too much meat, so i'll probably use only 1 lb. of meat, use a couple of carrots in addition to the squash (which tasted good with the spices), and also add another can of beans (the black beans worked well, but i do also want to try it with garbanzo). i might also try using tomato paste in the beginning with the onions to increase the depth of flavor a bit more.

Usually my husband isn't fond of cumin or raisins but he loved this combination. I was looking for a quick beef stew and this fit the bill! I agree with other reviews that beef tenderloin is a bit too expensive. I used cubed beef stewing meat from the butcher and I cooked it in a pressure cooker. I prepared as indicated in the pressure cooker, and then I added the cilantro and the lemon (oops), put the lid of the pressure cooker on and brought it to full steam then reduced it to very low for about 35 minutes, then increased it to high pressure for about 10 minutes and manually released the steam. I don't think you could really overcook in the Pressure cooker, but the meat (even though it was cheap) was very, very tender. I definite keeper!!

I don't eat red meat, so we substituted Mahi Mahi, since the butcher said it would hold its shape and do well in stew. He was right-- this was FANTASTIC with the fish. This was a beautiful dish, one of the best we've ever made from this site. And we are hard to please!

A nice weekday meal. I made this with stew meat and (unfortunately) without the olives, as I didn't have any on hand. I'll try it again with the olives and with a bit of chili, as others have suggested, for a kick. I usually only make Moroccan-style dishes with chicken, so this was a nice change.

I did it with stew meat, cooked about an hour or so 'til tender.(With tenderloin $10 lb. I save that bad boy for the grill.) I used black olives instead of the kalamata.

All the reviews had me expecting something a little better. I'll give this another try though as all the ingredients SHOULD add up to something fabulous. I'll slow-cook next time (agreeing w/ mnmeadow/Portland review that quick cooking doesn't allow flavors to really blend). No fault of the recipe, but my stew meat was way too tough. This recipe does deserve a second try though with a little more attention from the cook ;-).

This dish takes approx. 40 minutes of prep time if you have good knife skills. I followed the directions up to the point of adding the beef, then I cooked it for 2 hours.

This recipe came out well and it was definitely easy. I'd have to say,though, that it seems a waste to use tenderloin (I'm a grad student too and for us tenderloin is a treat to be done on the grill). We used organic stew meat and it got nice and tender in about 1.5 hours on the stove top (more quickly than I expected). The end result was also a little flat, so I added some extra lemon juice. Vinegar would also work well-- it kind of replicates the tang of harrissa, a sauce I've used with other Moroccan stews. Overall, though, well worth making again.
