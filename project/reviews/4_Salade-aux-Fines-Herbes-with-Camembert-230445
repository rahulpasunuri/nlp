Great salad! Had a French Dinner party where this fresh light salad was the perfect selection!

Incredibly simple, yes, and just about perfect. I felt that the tarragon/chevril to chives ratio was a bit high and so reduced the tarragon and added some parsley to make up the difference. The salad perfectly matches many rich, creamy cheeses. I've tried this with Camembert, St.Andre, and Epoisses; all matched wonderfully.
