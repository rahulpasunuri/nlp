Simple but really good -- could intensify the spices if you wanted to, adding coriander, a little allspice, or other fragrant ones. Could be good served cold, room temp, or even warm, depending on the rest of the meal.

As my spouse said, "I love carrots and I love cilantro" -- what's not to like? We'll make it again, although we found that the recipe probably serves twice as many as specified.

This is a good recipe, and similar to one at our neighborhood Tunisian restaurant. Our Tunisian chef uses fresh lemon juice, garlic and caraway seeds, and that version is delicious. I added the garlic, but sauteed it with the other things, and it was delicious. It is great served topped with feta and drizzled with olive oil. Do take care with the cayenne, however. If you have a volatile variety, it will be too much initially, although the heat fades a bit over a few days. This is an excellent recipe for the vegan or vegetarian in your group.

Wonderful recipe. Great combination of spices to add some variation to a basic vegetable dish!

I have made this recipe numerous times since it first appeared in 1996. It is delicious and a nice twist on cooked carrots. As did another reviewer, I too halved the amount of water with good results.

I used half the amount of water. The combination of carrots, cumin, cilantro and hot pepper is a great one. Sort of like parsleyed carrots for North Africa. Unfortunately my group of adult eaters found that the amount of cayenne was a little overpowering. I plan to make this again but only with reduced amounts of cumin and of cayenne.

This is a great recipe, and can be used easily with other veggies--I've made it with a combo of cauliflower, carrots and peas and used it to stuff pita bread--a great spicy low cal lunch!

This recipe was really easy to make, but I did't like it. I used less water than it called for, otherwise the carrots would have been too mushy.

Very easy and delicious. I make this with the Lebanese Chicken, which is in the same article in Bon Appetit.

This is a delicious side dish, mildly exotic without croosing the line into wierdness. I have made it many times. The only adjustment I make in the recipe as written is that I add less water.
