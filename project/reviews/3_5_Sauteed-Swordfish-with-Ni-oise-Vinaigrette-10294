This recipe makes a LOT of vinaigrette and would be excellent with salad. It's OK with the swordfish and has a nice texture. The trick is to serve just the right amount of vinaigrette so as to not overpower the taste of very expensive swordfish.

I only got to make about half (olives, capers, red peppers) of the vinaigrette before my 2 & 4 yo completely distracted me.. but it was still pretty good. I would like to try the whole thing next time. For leftovers the next day I mixed the olive mixture, chopped up swordfish and mayonnaise and made a salad that was very tasty.

This vinaigrette is perfect for the meaty texture and neutral flavor of swordfish. I LOVE it, and, since it's pretty lo-fat, sometimes indulge in Greek fries to go with it--hot salty fries, sprinkled with oregano and a hefty amount of crumbled feta (we really like salty things at our house).

Didn't have roasted peppers, so I used fresh diced tomatoes -- terrific! Also grilled swordfish. A great -- and easy -- summer entree.

The vinaigrette is also exceptional with grilled tuna. I've served it w/ steamed new potatoes and string beans for a "deconstructed" traditional Nicoise salad, and gotten rave reviews.

I really liked the ingredients in the vinaigrette. I didn't measure anything - just chopped and mixed, and used basil instead of parsley as another reviewer suggested. My husband, who doesn't like fish, liked it. My mom, who loves fish, really liked it. Unfortunately, I was unable to sell my 2 year old on the vinaigrette, but he ate the fish. I also sprinkled lemon zest over the fish when it came out of the pan. Overall, tastes great and looks terrific.

This is very good and I've made it a number of times. Use a really good wine vinegar and the vinaigrette only needs a tablespoon or two of olive oil. Also, didn't have parsley last night so used fresh basil instead. Tasted great.

Simple, flavourful dish looked like a restaurant meal and took all the effort of a quick weeknight dish. Make the dressing ahead, saute the steaks just before you sit down and voila! Your guests/family will be impressed. :)

A fast, easy, elegant preparation for swordfish. The nicoise flavors hold up well against the "meatiness" of the fish. Makes a beautiful presentation as well.

Very tastey. Definately a make again 3+ forks recipe. Simple to make, but I found it took some time for all the mincing. Maybe its just my inexperience. Used only 2 tbls of olive oil for the final mixture and it seemed to be plenty. Warmed it before serving.

Fantastic dish, very easy and fun to make. Make extra sauce because it goes great on crusty bread. Steamed broccoli and rice with a crisp chardonnay brought me right back to summer - not easy to do in New England during winter. I have made swordfish every way imaginable and this was far and away the best I've had.
