I had fresh spinach and dough. Sauteed the spinach with pancetta, olive oil, and a splash of lemon juice. Didn't have fontina so used Reggiano. Thought it had good flavor.

I love this recipe, very easy and good. I usually use a mixture of ricotta, parmesan and gorgonzola. I also add garlic, fresh spinach and mushrooms. Simple and yummy.

I made this as an appetizer: 10 mini calzones with homemade crust. They tasted fine, but pretty unremarkable. The only thing that made them stand out was the Gorgonzola. Without the good marinara I served on the side, this would have been a dud. I might use this cheese base again, but add a LOT of other fillings as well.

I love it! It's fantastic. The first time I made it I used powdered crust mix and it too 15 minutes to cook, but the second time I used Pillsbury pizza crust and it refused to cook all the way through...My advice is to use the powdered mix instead of the Pillsbury. Also, this stuff does not keep well. Make it all at once and eat it all at once. It's fabulous but doesn't taste nearly as good the next day. I thought I could make the whole recipe and store what I didn't use for another day. It is still good, but not nearly as good as it was fresh.

Great, easy recipe with things easy to keep on hand. I used mozz instead of fontina. Definitely use the blue cheese. I forgot to add the green onions; some garlic might have been nice. I made whole-wheat pizza crust which was great. This is a very generous 2 servings; even after 2nds there is some left over. Good homemade marinara alongside would be great.

I didn't care for the gorgonzola but I did love the ease of using refrigerated pizza crust. I usually make my own crust and I'm kind of a stickler but in a pinch (and there are a lot of those in my family these days) this works very well. We did two kinds: this and the filling with sausage and red peppers from another recipe. Yum.

This was very good and so E-Z! I wrestled a little bit with the dough, but I'm not the smoothest cook. It came out great, though. Very similar to the calzones we get at one of our favorite italian restaurants! The blue cheese is a great choice. Can anyone recommend a good marinara sauce for dipping?

I substituted a log of goat cheese, 1 cup of shredded mozzarella and a handful of grated parmesan for the cheeses in the recipe because that was what I had on hand. I also used baby spinach, which I sauteed in olive oil with three cloves of garlic and some chopped onion (I did not bother to squeeze out the liquid and it turned out fine). It was a delicious, easy dinner -- the flavor was reminiscent of spanakopita.

Easy weeknight dinner. I followed recipe exactly for the cheese amounts, and used fresh uncooked baby spinach in the mix. It made a fluffy calzone and was very good! I wouldn't change a thing. I loved the cheese blend ... yes it was highly flavorful and rich but so GOOOD! A flexible recipe that allows for modifications ... that's always a bonus in my book. Will make again for sure!

quick and tasty. Great for weeknights. I used the cheeses I had on hand: fresh mozzarella, ricotta & goat cheese.

oh yeah, served it with the Roasted Garlic Soup from this site. If you haven't tried it, i encourage you with every ounce of my being to try it.

Yummy! it always blows my mind when i make a really simple recipe from this site and it ends up tasting out of this world. i'm really surprised that so many people subbed out the gorgonzola - that was my favorite part. but then i think i abnormally love bleu cheese. the other thing that was surprising was how big they were, considering the recipe was for two servings. i think next time, i'll cut the dough square into four squares and make smaller calzones. using homemade dough would be a good way to upgrade, and i'd like to add sliced mushrooms or other ingredients sometime.

I impressed my whole family with these, using tomato basil feta and mozarella like many other people...I though gorgonzola might be too weird for them. They've even been requested for my sister's wedding shower!

Not bad for an easy week night dinner with a bowl of soup. I used the cheeses I happened to have on hand which didn't happen to include blue, but will give it a try. I do have to wonder if it might not be a little too bitter and overpowering with the spinach. Also time I may add some of the tiny frozen Italian meatballs from a local market(the type you find in wedding soup)to one or two of them to make a more substantial meal. We need sauce with calazone, so used the pizza sauce from this site (easy and the perfect base for customizing - just be sure to use good quality tomatoes and oil.

This recipe was very good for our Super Bowl party. I followed many other posters' suggestions and used a combination of ricotta, mozarella (instead of fontina) and sun-dried tomato basil feta (instead of blue cheese). I also split the calzones up into 8 mini calzones and they were gobbled up!

Rating: 2
This recipe is OK, but not outstanding. I could not taste the blue cheese. I would recommend adding an egg to help hold the cheese together. I'd also take time to make some dough. The only refrigerator dough I could find was Pillsbury, and it stretched too thin in places, causing the filling to burst out while baking.

I REALLY enjoyed making this recipe! I used blue cheese and ricotta but substitued the mozzarella for the the Fontina. It was delicious and a hit!! I will definately make it again! It reminded me of the spinach pies of my youth!

I took the last reviewers advice and made mini-calzones for a party which worked quite well. I made them the night before and froze them so I could just pop them on a tray and cook for about 8 minutes. I used a mild blue cheese instead of gorgonzola and served with a side of marinara. My guests loved them!

These make wonderful appetizers if you make mini-calzones and serve with a side of marinara. All guests I've served them to have loved them, recipe as is with no changes.

This was a pretty good calzone. Even though my husband and I love strong flavors, we found it a bit too rich and would add some ingredients to temper the strong cheeses -- mushrooms or chicken perhaps.

Rating: 2
It was tasty (though tangy from the cheese) the first time, but when I used the leftover filling and made additional calzones the next day, the flavor of the Gorgonzola was overpowering. I would only recommend this recipe if you enjoy cheeses with a stronger flavor.

YUM! We devoured this dish a few days ago, making a lot of substitutions aout of necessity. We would make it again exactly as we had before. Substitutions were as follows: replace ricotta with mozarella; 1 cup marinara with clams; 1.5 cups chopped low-fat turkey pepperoni; 1 tbsp chopped garlic; 1/3 cup chopped onion; 5 oz sliced mushrooms; and in my husband's we put 1 sliced Adell's chicken sausage. We topped it with a pepper sauce from Belize (Maria's brand habanero sauce) and paired it with an Oregon Pinot Noir (Willamette Valley). Spice is nice!

I got rave reviews on this recipe, even the day after. I started out with a plate of cold proscuitto, black olives and marinated mushrooms as an appetizer. Then I served the calzones with the recipe on this site simply called, "Pizza Sauce". Delicious!

this recipe was fast and easy which is what i was looking for. I used my own fillings: pepperoni, mushrooms,peppers and onions. this is definitely not a gourmet food but it is great when you are in a crunch.

My kids and husband loved this recipe! I used ricotta, feta and mozzarella and I added chicken. I will definitely will make this again.

I too changed this up a bit--used feta with peppercorns instead of bleu cheese, and an Italian blend with mozzarella, parm/romano and fontina. Also added some crushed red pepper and a spoonful of pesto, and made rectangles instead of triangles (seemed easier). They came out great. I'll make them again to use the rest of the ricotta, probably trying some different variations (like more veggies or some meat).

Delicious! Better-than-restaurant quality! I used low-fat ricotta, mozarella (instead of bleu cheese), and fontina (less than the recommended 1 cup). I also used the website's pizza sauce recipe to go with, which is fab!

This is a great recipe. We like to add a red sauce on top.

I have been making this with lots of variations. My favorite is: 15oz/part skim ricotta, basil and cayenne pepper to taste,@1/8# thinly sliced Genoa salami in strips, small amount of spinach, (2handfulls taken from a bag of frozen)thawed and squeezed, 2 slices Provolone, shredded or chopped, mix above with most of one beated egg, reserving rest for eggwash (a must to finish)

I did a few modifications - added a couple a teaspoons of pesto, used the ricotta and substituted a preshredded Italian cheese mixture (parmesan, mozarella, romano, etc.) from the dairy aisle for the different cheeses. Easy and good!

I thought this was really good. I substituted sundried tomato/basil feta for the blue cheese. Seemed like a lot of filling but it seemed to cook down a little. I added some mushrooms and roasted red peppers. Next time I'll add more/different vegetables and maybe some mozzerella. Definitely a keeper.

Excellent recipe. I changed it a bit by omitting the ricotta, and adding tomato basil feta and mozzarella along with the other cheeses. Delicious, but slightly salty due to the feta. Definitely a keeper.

I've made this recipe twice, and each time I have had a lot of left-over spinach/cheese mixture. I will cut back a bit next time. It has a fairly good flavor, but it needs a little bit more spice.

Great simple recipe. I substituted the blue cheese with greek blended feta (with sundried toms and olives), added 2 cloves of crushed garlic, a bit of garlic salt, and crushed red pepper. It really woke up the flavor.

I had never tried blue cheese before and after making this dish, I decided never to try it again! It's extraordinarily overpowering! Ouch! The spinach and cheese mixture smelled wonderful until I added the blue cheese. I will gladly try this dish again but will replace the blue cheese with veggies (perhaps sundried tomatoes or roasted red peppers).

I made these calzones last night for dinner. I thought it was a little heavy on the Gorgonzola taste, even though I love blue cheese, I just thought it was overpowering. Other than that, I thought these were delicious and very easy to whip up using Pillsbury refrigerated pizza dough. I will make again, but next time, I will add a lot less Gorgonzola and more Fontina instead (maybe some Swiss), and then maybe a big fat clove of garlic. After that it would be a 3-forker (it takes a lot for me to give something 4 forks). I served with a nice fresh tomato sauce on the side and a green salad.

Delicious! I took the previous advice and added more cheese(1c ricotta, 3oz gorgonzola, 6 oz fontina), made 1 long calzone, and served with pizza sauce on the side. It was the best!

I also added 1/2 c. of toasted pine nuts and made one long calzone, added an egg wash too. This was excellent. You need to be a little more generous w/ cheese to accomodate the nuts. Everyone raved about it. It was so easy!!
