Excellent rub for tri-tip. I couldn't find Savory Leaves, so just left that out. Also, since I was going to BBQ in a smoker, I used plain paprika instead of smoked paprika. This makes enough for two trip tip roasts of about 2.5lbs each. Used 1 med chunck of mesquite and 4 small chunks of pecan- smoked for 1.25 hrs at 225 degrees for med rare (137 internal temp).

I made this for myself and as part of a Christmas basket for several friends. It was unanimous. Everybody loved it. I've used it as recommended and countless other ways, including in a fantastic cheese omelet.

I made this, along with the other rubs featured in this issue, for my husband for Christmas. The chimichurri rub is especially good on flank steak.

A friend made this for me and it's heavenly on lamb in addition to all the other meats already mentioned.

Haven't tried this as a marinade yet, but double yum on bbq'd pork tenderloin and fabulous on chicken

This was great on grilled (beer-can method) chicken. I didn't have any savory but otherwise followed the recipe. The smoked paprika is essential; it adds a wonderful smoky, earthy flavor that works beautifully with grilled meat. This would also be fantastic on fish.

I made various rubs and spice mixes as Christmas gifts. This rub is by far my favorite! I use it on everything...steak, fish, chicken, even eggs. YOU MUST TRY THIS!

I used it as a marinade for chicken. While the chicken was roasting, it smelled incredible. And the chicken came out delicious. A winner for me!
