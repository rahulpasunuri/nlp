I make this every halloween because it is just as the recipe claims - quick! I am not a Cincinnati-style chili nut so I wouldnt' try to compare but this is a great tasting dish that can easily be spiced up. It is NOT traditional tasting chili so if that's what you're looking for, try another recipe, but it beats anything canned that claims to be chili IMHO.

Also a good recipe to cook in the slow- cooker for 8 hours to 10 hours. Subbed veggie hamburger because I am a vegetarian.

This is a good quick recipe, but a few extra tweaks can really improve it. A little more chili powder, some ancho chili powder and a touch of cumin round out the spices nicely. After browning the ground beef, I add a little milk and cook it off to tenderize the meat. Makes a nice quick weeknight meal.

I don't come from a 'chili' state, so I have no particular alliegance to a method. This is simply a tasty, one- pot meal for a cold day that comes together quickly. Like another reviewer, I simmer it for a while to let the meat fall apart and the flavors blend and develop. I also add some cayenne and oregano to the spice mix, and I add a minced garlic clove to the peppers. It's really good with beans (black or kidney), but not everyone in my family likes beans so I serve them separately. My family loves it -- I have to double the recipe so there are leftovers. Suspend your preconceived notions of chili and try it. It's good.

If you are not a Cincinnati chili purist, or (like me) couldn't care less about Cincinnati chili, then you have just found a delicious and easy chili recipe. My whole family loved this. I upped the chili powder by half and added frozen corn (sauteed it with the peppers) and a can of black beans. As for complaints that it's not spicy enough, I'm confused why you would make a recipe with no spicy ingredients and then get disappointed because it's not spicy. If you want heat, add some fresh jalapeno or cayenne powder.

A lot of people are picky about "authentic" chili - Cinci, texas, etc. - and that's fine. But this recipe is quick, easy and tasty - three very positive attributes. Are there better chili recipes out there? Probably. But this one does just fine for me in a pinch.

Cinci chili this is not; I think its value largely comes from being quick. I suspect that deleting the bell peppers would bring it closer. The real thing is so fabulous that I'm willing to go the whole way. Check out the other Cinci recipe on this site; it is very close. The cinnamon makes it Greek chili, but more specifically the other items (allspice, paprika, mace, cocoa, tomato paste, simmered meat, appropriate toppings) make it Cincinnati chili. I've been a long time Ohio resident and avid fan of Cinci chili, and I think the best is Skyline chili, the fast food chain (the frozen and canned stuff is good but too salty); the spice packets sold at Kroger's make a very satisfactory and easy substitute. If you don't have a Kroger's the other recipe on this site is the closest I've tried; just delete the oregano, cut chili powder in half or even quarter it, sub an 8 oz can of tomato paste for the sauce, quadruple the cinnamon (and increase other sweet spices, to taste), add cocoa powder, and perhaps use beef broth instead of water. The large quantity of beef keeps it from being too runny. It serves 6 because everyone will want three plates. It's important to simmer the beef a long time instead of browning it; it falls apart into tiny bits so the chili is pretty homogenous in texture and taste. Most feel it should top spaghetti and have shredded cheddar on top, with beans and fresh chopped onion underneath, and ptional. While very good with saltines or oyster crackers, it is amazingly good with thin spaghetti. I thought it was weird at first too, and ate it with cheese and crackers only, but when I finally tried it with spaghetti I was floored! Like others I became addicted. Please do try it with spaghetti rather than rice, I promise you'll love it!!

This is not Cinci chili. Native of Cinci, it would take my mother all day to make, we always serve it over spagetti, with chopped raw onions and shredded cheddar cheese. Why, you ask, would we put it on spagetti? Because we aren't from Texas. No offense to Texans. What a boring world if we all did it the same. Please Epicurious, take this recipe off your site.

Is it 'authentic'? Probably not. Is it delicious and fast? You better believe it! The only changes I make: instead of green pepper, use red and yellow (or orange), and a large, seeded, deveined and minced jalapeno; add also a drained can of black beans. Sometimes, I add thawed frozen corn too. I also like to cook it longer at lower heat, as I like a thick chili.

I added a can each of red kidney beans and black beans and used 2 fresh chillis. I also took slightly less of the cocoa and cinnamon, being careful. I really loved the result!

I made this chili for a chili contest at work and it won. It is very different from what I am use to but tasty. It needs a little more heat though. The only changes I made was to add celery and more chili powder. I also used stewed italian stye tomatoes because that was all I had on hand.

This was so very bland and the cinnamon overpowered the dish. I made this recipe because I thought the idea of adding cinnamon and chocolate sounded interesting--like Mexican mole sauce--but I was so very wrong. My husband and kids loved it--go figure--but I know I'll never make this again without major revisions to the recipe.

Rating: 4
Very interesting mix of flavors. I added a dash of cayenne pepper to give it some kick. (Maybe my chili powder is just old and feeble.) Didn't have any molasses, so I substituted honey -- it worked, but the honey flavor was discernable, so I'm interested to see how it turns out with molasses.

I love this recipe!! It was so flavorful, without having too much heat. Although I like spicy food, I was looking for a compromising recipe to suit the tastes of some with very little tolerance for hot food. This recipe was a winner amongst everyone! I used stew meat cut into tiny pieces rather than ground meat, and I simmered the dish for hours. I served with shredded chedder and a dollop of sour cream, with a side of cornbread.

Sorry - this was greasy and bland, even after I added lots more chili powder, allspice, cloves, and cider vinegar, let it simmer for 3-1/2 hrs and meld overnight (I skimmed off the congealed fat). I don't understand the kudos. Easy, yes. Worthwhile, no...

O.k., o.k. - it didn't really taste anything like Cincinnati chili. It was still delicious. Perfect for a range of palates - other reviewers have criticized the recipe as too mild, but it zips up nicely with a splash of Frank's hot sauce. Serve it to guests, but don't claim it's Cincinnati chili if your guests are from Cincinnati. Great tasting and really easy.

I thought this chili was good, but lacked a bit of punch. It was rather mild. I ate it over pasta and was pretty happy with it-- my boyfriend scarfed it down. I think the next time I make it I would add some beans (because I still think chili is not chili without beans), and perhaps more chili powder.

As a native Cincinnatian, I thought ALL chili came served over spaghetti (until I got to college). In fairness to this recipe, I decided to try it before passing judgement. While it didn't taste bad, if you are trying to replicate Cincinnati chili in your own home, don't bother with this recipe. You'll come a lot closer by using one of those spice mix packets from the supermarket. Or, try the other recipe for Cincinnati chili on this site - I haven't made it yet, but the ingredient list looks a lot closer to the real thing.

FYI to 01/08/03 - 40 years ago a place called Canova's (in Akron O) served what they called chili-mac and it was just a hot spicy chili served over spaghetti with alot of shredded cheese on top and it was gooood.

A very good recipe. The aroma is wonderful. I read the reviews and chopped the ingredients finer as well as serving it on pasta with cheddar cheese and onions. What a hit! The only thing it needed was LOTS OF HOT SAUCE! But I live on spicy food!

I made this chili because I've had Skyline chili and loved the "different" flavor from regular chili. The taste of this recipe is almost the same as Skyline but there is an ingredient that is "missing" or not enough as indicated in the recipe. I didn't like it well enough to try again. By the way, my husband and I love the thought of chili on pasta...everything goes with pasta!!!

Pasta is just a vehicle for a wide range of sauces or stews (sort of like rice), including chili. I say this, and I'm Italian (if my mother only knew...)!

Chili on pasta is not nearly as odd as mayonnaise on foie gras--the tastes do go together well. In Cincy, where I lived for 4 years, they eat their chili over spaghetti. The chili itself is usually very fine grained, not too chunky, and I've never seen it with peppers, just very finely minced onion and the sauce. They top with beans, onions, and cheese, and depending on which combination you use it's a 3-way, 4-way, or 5-way. They're picky about what order they layer the toppings too! Skyline and Gold Star are the two primary chili parlor chains but there are many mom-and-pop parlors too, and each one tastes a little different. They all include cinammon in the recipe though! It's addictive.

This is easy and the combination of spices is delicious! It tastes just different enough from the chili I am used to for it to be interesting but not so different that those with picky palates will reject.

Cook on the verge: get over yourself! Cincinnati chili IS served over pasta. It's fantastic! This is a very easy recipe... my old stand-by takes 2 hours to simmer. This recipe didn't call for it, but I believe you typically serve it also with kidney beans, onions, and grated cheese to top. Also, try a touch of allspice, Worchestershire sauce, and plain white vinegar when cooking the chili. Yummy!!

Pasta and beans are not new, they're yummy together. Leftover chili is great over pasta; it's a great way to spread out the leftovers! I swear reading some of these reviews is like reading garbage scribbled on the bathroom wall of a gas station. As a person who owned her own catering business--I know food. I only quit to stay home and be a full time mother. I still get rave reviews when people eat at my house and I'm asked to bring dishes to dinners constantly. But what I don't understand or get is how you all kiss your mothers with those mouths. Grow up seriously; don't knock it till you try it. Who would have thought that chocolate and chilies would go together? And if you're such the snobby gourmet cook you try to appear. Why in the world are you surfing the web for recipes. You should be at the CIA instead!

I thought this was a good and easy chili recipe. I did add a couple of cloves of minced garlic and about a cup of drained kidney beans, but I'm sure it's fine as is. We topped it with grated old cheddar and served over rice. I have no idea what "Cincinnati chili" is supposed to taste like, so that didn't spoil my enjoyment.

I thought this chili was delicious and so quick and easy to put together. I decided to change it a bit by adding 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork, as well as black beans. I highly recommend giving it a try.

We lived in Cincinnati for 13 years, leaving 9 years ago. I tried this recipe today, here in Germany where we are now living. My daughter remembered this (she was 7 when we moved) and we enjoyed it. Remember to put it on spaghetti, topped with grated cheddar cheese.

I have never been to Cincinnati and I'm not so sure I want to after reading some of the scathing reviews of this recipe ("do us a favor and take it off the site" - give me a break!)but, here's my two cents...this was pretty darn good. Yes, not a typical chili, but then again, I've never had chili over pasta either! I made it for a party and the pot was practically licked clean. And it's so easy to make. I am making for another party this coming week.

Come on people, everyone knows that the Cincinnati style means the touch of cinnamon and sweeter flavor, which this recipe has. It has nothing to do with pouring it over anything. If you do it's not chili, it's just a glorified tomato topping.

O.K. I'm a Chicagoan, but a former frequent business traveler to Cincinnati where I had the pleasure of discovering Skyline and Gold Star. I became addicted, often having to visit Skyline's for both lunch and dinner! Now this recipe is not exact. As others have noted, the real Cincinnati 5-way version is a thin sauce served over a heaping plate of spaghetti with diced raw onions, red beans, and completely covered with mild, finely shredded cheddar. On the side there must be oyster crackers and plenty of fiery red hot sauce. Yum! This recipe is not bad, though. As I was cooking it, my wife joyfully came into the kitchen to let me know that upstairs, it smelled like Skyline's! (we had a family visit to Cinti this Summer). I knew to serve it over the spaghetti with cheese (the kids wouldn't miss the onions and the beans). The texture is much different; this recipe is much chunkier due to the quantity of chopped peppers, which I don't think are in the original. Bottom line though, the taste is a close approximation of the real thing (true Cincinnatians, please do not hate me), and even my picky kids enjoyed. The leftovers did not go to waste either. I plan on making it again.

As you can tell, us Cincinnatians are VERY paticular about what we call "our" chili. In fact, there is a huge debate over the BEST Cincinnati chili (Gold Star or Skyline, and I give Dixie Chili, Mt. Washington Chili, etc. honorable mentions). My advice for fellow Cincinnatians when seeing this recipe would be to take it for what it is - flattery that someone would come up with a recipe hoping to be as good as "our" chili.

Caveat: NB that this is CINCINNATI chili, an addictive concoction served over pasta with chopped onions and shredded sharp cheddar cheese (and often w/ red kidney beans cooked in the sauce). Don't compare this to common chili. Kroger food stores (Cincinnati based) sell a mix if you want to try something close to the original.
