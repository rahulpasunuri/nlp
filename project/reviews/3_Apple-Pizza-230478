This was great! I was looking for an appetizer, and the suggested modification of adding caramelized onions was just what I was looking for. I added them like the "sauce" on a pizza. Otherwise followed the recipe. Delicious.

Loved this recipe. Have made it twice as written now and have served it as an appetiser to rave reviews. Just make sure you slice the apples very thin.

i also skipped the bread crumbs and used brown sugar instead of white. I carmelized onions in butter, brown sugar and balsamic and used 2 different apples. I sprinkled thyme over the top of my pizza after adding the cheese. my pizza made enough to serve 20 people as an appitizer and got many compliments on it!

I changed this around and made it into an appetizer. I caramelized a large diced sweet onion in some butter,added a couple splashes of balsamic vinegar, and let it cook down a bit more. I spread the onion mixture over the pastry , did not use the bread crumbs, then followed the rest of the recipe as written. After meling the cheddar, I let it sit for 15 mintues before cutting into small squares. Everyone just raved and asked for the recipe. The mix of sweet and savory was great and unexpected. A definate keeper as an appetizer.

I also used brown sugar instead of white. Added chopped almonds and cinnamon on top, for more of a fall taste. Used three different kinds of apples to make it more interesting. Served warm with vanilla ice cream on the side. Unfortunately, it was still kinda bland and not as juicy as I would have liked. The puff pastry was flaky and makes for a nice presentation, but the taste was lacking. Easy to make though.

I really enjoyed this! It was interesting and the crust was so light!

Very tasty. Simple and good. Used 2 smaller apples which was enough and brown sugar instead of white. Also added dried currants which made it look more like a "pizza". ;) Very good, will make again.
