This is an exceptional marinade. Be careful not to marinate too long otherwise you will dry out the meat. I also use this to marinate steak tips. Put meat and marinade in a large ziploc for an hour or so. Snip a small slit on the bottom corner of the bag and drain the marinade into a small saucepan. While the tips are cooking on the grill, reduce the marinade. Place the cooked steak tips on a platter and drizzle the reduced marinade over. Yum.

Yummy, but also very salty. I did leave the chops in the marinade longer than recommended, so that might have been the issue. My husband, who said that he didn't like pork chops, came back for seconds.

This marinade was very nice. I added more garlic and a couple of tbsp of pineapple juice as well. I marinaded the meat for 2 hours. I did bbq the meat. Nice marinade that would work on fish or chicken as well. Great recipe.

A nice quick marinade for pork chops. I will try with other cuts of meat in the future. Very yum!

Wonderful marinade. We used it (doubled the recipe) on about 3lbs chicken legs and thighs. I did not realize I was supposed to cook the marinade before marinating, so I didn't. I was a little light on the Tamari soy sauce, but everything else was per the recipe. I marinated for about 3 hours in big zip lock bag and then barbequed off banked perfect coals(my son is a master barbequer). The lid was on, but vents open. The eye appeal was magnificent, so was the aroma and the taste! I simmered the marinade and basted with that. When finished, there was only a little left and we dipped the chicken in that. All the marinade was used! Very basic, and incredibly good. It is great off the barbeque, but my favorite is cold for lunch the next day.

Excellent marinade! I marinated the chops for a couple of hours and I didn't simmer the marinade the first time, only while cooking chops. It made a very light, tasty marinade which would probably be great on red meat as well. Will definitely keep around for future use.

A HUGE hit with both my husband and my 8 year old. I made this as stated, except that I marinaded the chops in the fridge for about 7 hours. I also deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup of beef broth (I HATED to waste the nice pan drippings) and added this to the simmering marinade.

This was very good. Marinaded the pork longer than the 15 minutes called for. Although the pork does look burned, it's quite moist inside. I might try cooking it on the barbique next time.

I really liked this recipe and it was easy to prepare.

This marinade/sauce is fantastic! One thing I have done to make it a little easier: I don't simmer the marinade but rather coat the pork for about an hour. After I've grilled the pork chops, I then simmer the marinade until a little thickened then drizzle over the chops as a sauce. Great with sticky rice! So easy!

The sauce was more work than I thought it was going to be, especially with having to find a meal bowl to cool it, then to momentarily later heat it. But there is little doubt the results were very good, and my dinner party voraciously ate everything served.

Just great for the BBQ. Steak nice and thick goes just great with this.

Neither my husband nor I liked this much. We didn't think the flavors really complemented the pork, and I also didn't think the sauce was as flavorful as a similar one from Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa Cookbook called Indonesian Ginger Chicken, which is made with honey, soy sauce, ginger and garlic. Not a keeper in our house.

A great dish when you don't have much time to marinate meat. I didn't have cider vinegar on hand so substituted red wine vinegar with excellent results. Also used 2 garlic cloves instead of just one. I didn't bother simmering the marinade before pouring over the chops, but did boil it the 5 min. afterwards for serving. A very tasty dish with minimal effort!

This was really delicious! AND it made the whole house smell wonderful! My husband said its definately a "guest worthy meal." I used honey for lack of brown sugar and it was great.

This was okay. I have a marinade that calls for oyster sauce that I like better. But Hey! That's me.

This couldn't be any easier or quicker! I made several substitutions to accomodate what I had on hand: 1t gound ginger since I didn't have gingerroot, Marsala for the sherry, and cognac vinegar instead of cider. Even with these changes, it was good. Next time I will try to get closer to the actual recipe. Husband liked it and he's not a pork chop fan.

I made this last night for dinner - wonderful! Really gives the pork a great flavor. I will definitely make this again. I served with wild rice & fried apples ! Really, very delicious. You don't really need the dipping sauce, it's good by itself !

I didn't have any fresh ginger, but the pork chops were delicious anyway.

This recipe was easy and absolutely delicious. Makes ordinary pork chops taste great. I used boneless chops.
