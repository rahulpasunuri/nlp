This is delightful. Easy (with a good pineapple) and lasts at least a week in the freezer. I didn't use an ice cream maker - just put it in a metal bowl in the freezer - stirring occasionally (2-3 times)- the next day whipped it in batches in a food processer then packed it in a covered plastic container.
