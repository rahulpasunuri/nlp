I'm not rating this because I didn't follow the recipe exactly as written. I couldn't find watercress, so I used arugula like many of the other reviewers. Initially the dip tasted quite bland, so I added a bit more mustard and anchovy paste. I also made it a day in advance. Unfortunately, I ended up having to throw the whole thing out. It was pretty and fresh looking and its initial flavor was nice, but there was a bitter taste at the end that was very unappealing. Might have been the arugula, or I don't know what. Just wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone else.

Very light and flavourful. I perfect dip for summer time. I couldn't find watercress in my market so I substituted arugula and it tastes fantastic.

made this w/mustard greens from my garden instead of watercress and used yogurt cheese instead of sour cream, added a hint of cream cheese and this was FANTASTIC! would definitely make again, was a hit!

This is a real winner! Used spicy arugala because I couldn't find any watercress, low fat mayonnaise and low fat sour cream and served it at my husband's birthday party. Everyone loved it.

For a health-conscious dip it was pretty good, but nothing exciting.

This was FANTASTIC. We served this at a cocktail party last night and everyone gobbled it up. We had 7 people, and if we had made twice the amount this recipe produces it would have all been gone as well. Make sure all of your herbs are raw and fresh. Very healthy, refreshing, and easy. You'll never find a dip this good at the store.
