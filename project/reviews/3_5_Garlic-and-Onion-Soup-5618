I made this for the first time last night and it was terrific. I only changed a couple things: 1. I roasted one bulb of garlic and 1/2 of a bulb of fresh cloves. 2. I used slices of toasted French bread instead of white sandwich bread. It really turned out fantastic! I pureed the soup in batches and left one batch a little choppy and it gave the soup a great consistency. I served it with a simple salad of red leaf lettuce, roasted portabella mushrooms, home-made croutons, shaved parm with a sherry vinagrette. Just what the doctor ordered on a chilly winter night! I'll be making this one again but use veg stock and soy milk. I think it has great vegan potential.

Awesome cold weather soup! Full of flavor and ridiculously easy to make.

It was all right, but I didn't think it was great. Next time I'd use less bread and maybe roast the garlic first. It tasted exactly like all the flavors mixed together; the cooking didn't seem to do any kind of special alchemy flavor-wise. Was slightly disappointed. Friends liked it, though. Good comfort food.

I agree with the suggestions made by others..I actually used a 7 grain bread and it added color and a toasty taste to the soup..it was a hit!

This was really good,esspecially for the short amount of time it took to make. I used already peeled boxed garlic and it was just as fresh tasting and much faster, also whole wheat bread and vegtable broth. My guests loved this, will make again for sure.

This soup was delicious! We love garlic, who can love to cook and not love garlic? We used heavy cream instead of half and half, wheat bread instead of white, and fresh thyme in the recipe and as a garnish. It does take longer than 45 minutes though. I think it took 45 minutes just to peel the garlic cloves.

I love garlic, but this soup seemed to be overwhelmed by the amount of garlic. It has an excellent finish and I think I would enjoy the soup if the garlic was reduced. Don't let my review scare anyone off, but you better relly love garlic if you want to give this soup a try.

A wonderful wintertime soup. I was a little sloppy about measuring the amount of onions I used, so my soup came out tasting a little more of onions. I made the soup ahead and reserved the half and half till shortly before serving. I am also going to roast the onion and garlic the next time I make it. UPDATE: I roasted the garlic and onion and it came out wonderfully. I dont think I prefer one over the other, but when you roast the onion and garlic it imparts a taste of smoke that may or may not be wanted. Give it a try!

My husband and I made this soup when we were having company over for dinner. It was so delicious that our friends keep talking about the soup and asking when we'll be making it again, so they can come over. A huge hit, but not if you don't like garlic! Make sure to buy the container of already peeled garlic. It made the whole thing so much easier. It wouldn't be worth it to try to peel 30 cloves! Also, we used more bread than the recipe called for, to thicken it a bit - about 1/2 of a sourdough baguette flute.

This was absolutely wonderful!! I thought it odd to boil the half and half, but followed directions absolutely. It was fantastic, a nice light soup that made the perfect starter for a cool autumn night. Also made a great breakfast this morning!

i have made this soup many times and it is always a hit. i use yoghurt instead of half & half and cut down on the slices of bread. It's still rich and creamy without the fat!

Our family was in Vienna this summer and we had a wonderful onion and garlic soup. My kids loved it and luckily I found it here. My youngest, who is very finicky, could eat it 3 times a week. He just adds croutons. In Vienna they added a dollop of fresh whipped cream, but in my opinion it was too rich.

Loved it! I used marsala wine instead of the sherry and topped with thin slices of baguette and a mixture of both sharp and mild provolone cheeses. Broiled for about a minute. HEAVEN!

I love this soup! Sometimes I leave out the bread and float thin slices of toasted baguette on top as a garnish instead.

Absolutely wonderful to tuck into on a chilly autmn night! I added an extra cup of chopped onion and cut the garlic by about 7-8 cloves. I also used an extra 2 slices of bread. Using a wand mixer makes it sooo easy! Really delicious.

A rich, delicious soup I could eat twice a week!
