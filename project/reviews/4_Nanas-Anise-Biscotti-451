I just made these at high altitude and am happy to say they turned out! But even doubling the anise flavoring as suggested by other reviewers - anise extract, anise liquor, anise seeds - they barely taste like anise. I will be making again, with triple or quadruple the anise extract & seeds. Also, 1/2 recipe makes plenty: 30 cookies.

My family likes a store bought brand, but when they moved states they couldn't find it locally. I made these and they were ecstatic!! They insist I should go into business selling them because they are so much better than the store bought ones they were buying. I made two changes: I subbed a mini bottle of Jagermeister for the brandy (it was just shy of the 1/3 cup required) and I upped the almonds to 1 1/2 cups and the Anise seeds to 3 T as suggested by a previous poster.

Very good - I made with pistachios and w/o anise seeds. I made this twice and both times the first baking the loaves burned. I tried using a silpat the second time and it still burned. Scraped off the burned bottoms and they were very tasty.

Having made this numerous times, thought it's time for a review. This is absolutely wonderful - gets rave reviews every time. Sometimes I substitute rum for brandy and reduce the sugar 1/4th. Comes out good nonetheless. Be conscious of your oven temp for the second baking though - experiment with how crunchy you like your biscotti. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

I love this recipe. I made a few changes to get more anise flavor, instead of brandy I use anisette liquor and add 1/4 tsp anise flavor. It goes over so well, that I make it at least once a month for family and friends. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe.

To the cook from Boston....When you slice the biscotti you slice the almonds. I have made this these a zillion times and it is a fail safe recipe..Just make em!

I love love love this recipe - couldn't stop eating these biscotti! I am allergic to almonds so they were left out - but still just delicious. If you like anise you will love this recipe - this one goes into my "permanent binder".

Not a review, a question...hoping someone sees this :) It seems like whole almonds would be huge in biscotti, after toasting, do you chop, grind or slice them?

Have made these many times. Just recently started increasing the amount of almonds and aniseeds: 1 1/2 cups almonds and 3 Tbsp aniseeds to make them more like my Sicilian grandmother's!

the biscotti are nice. My issues were: 1. I used French 45Type flour which is much weaker than american AP flour. 2. My toddler turned up the oven in the last 5 minutes without me noticing it :-), so maybe it got a little overdone and tended to crumble when slicing. I waited until the logs were completely cold and a managed to cut with a chef knife going with a quick cut down and avoiding a sewing motion. I only reduced the sugar of 25% and used white wine instead of brandy and extracts. Although delicious, these biscotti are a little too butter for my taste, I think I'd like them a little more crunchy and likely I'll try with extra virgin olive oil instead of butter (reducing the amount).

2nd batch with dried cherries, dried cranberries and roasted husked chopped hszelnuts did not work as well - I may have added too much liquid with extra extract (almond, though I reduced the brandy to compensate - I thought!), or perhaps I spread the logs too thin, or my kitchen may just have been warmer that day. Great flavor but the batter was ,uch thinner than previously, the logs spread way out, even touching, and made very long thin (pretty, but crumbly) cookies. Very very tasty so I will try this combo again. Tonight's batch with chocolate chips came out just lovely as before, and these I baked at 350 on multi-shelf convection so only took about 28 minutes first bake. Still adore this recipte and once again, rave reviews. Thanks Nana!

Love this and have gotten rave reviews; made exactly to spec and not a lick of trouble. I only let the dough cool 'til barely warm before slicing on a diagonal, but I did use a VERY sharp non-serrated knife. No crumbling at all. Drizzled tempered chocolate over the top next day; lovely. Tonight's batch of Xmas give-aways will have hazelnuts (toasted, husked), cranberries and sweet dried cherries mixed in. Next experimental batch will be chocolate. Will keep you posted, but this recipe is so easy I think it will remain a winner through many permutations.

Followed the recipe exactly as given except, like some others, I used 3 tsp aniseed. The result was fabulous. Highly recommended.

Very good, although a tad bit sweet for my taste. Next time I will take cactuswolf's suggestion: replace brandy with sambucca, reduce sugar by 25%.

Rating: 4
Great recipe, added 50% less kosher salt, increased Sambucca to compensate for lack of anise extract and added 25% less sugar. Added semi-sweet chocolate topping when cooled. For cutting the biscotti I waited about 10 minutes then used a sharpened 10" knife. Used the knife blade to lift the slices onto the baking tray for drying. Had no problems. I thought the bread knife idea was a disaster.

I have made this recipe all year round since it first came out and it is still my #1 hit. I also add 1 tsp almond extract and 1 cup of craisins and 1/2 cup pistachio and it is a wonderful addition.

I LOVE biscotti and have baked at least a dozen different recipes in the last 2 years. This recipe - while I haven't tried it yet - gets 4 forks from me because it includes 2 of the best tips for biscotti bakers. One problem that preciously plagued me with every single recipe was that if the logs were the least bit underdone on the inside, the dough would stick to the serrated knife as I cut the sllices and that would make the next slices difficult/messy. If the logs were the slightest bit too dry, any nuts inside would cause the slice to break as I tried slicing them. Recently, I was at a fabulous open hearth style bakery on a country road here in Northern California and asked them what their slicing technique was, as their biscotti were picture perfect sllices.They told me they let their biscotti cool and "sit out" for up to 24 hours before slicing and doing the second baking! (EVERY recipe I'd ever seen said to let the logs cool just 5 - 20 minutes before slicing.) I tried this long cooling and drying step, and for the first time ever, the logs sliced as crisp as if done with a laser. The wet hands technique instead of extra flour looks like a winner too. Thanks for these tips - I can hardly wait to try this recipe this weekend.

made several batches of this for the holidays and the recipe was a huge hit. as good as any from the italian bakeries in nyc that i'm used to. used sambuca instead of brandy, more vanilla extract because i couldn't find anise extract around here. used an ice cream scoop (4-5 scoops per log) and then rounded/smoothed with wet hands. brushed with water as suggested after the first baking. also used as base recipe with brandy, chopped pistachios and dried cranberries - also yum.

I have now made three batches of these in the last week and will probably make several more. These are excellent and completely authentic. Crisp without being toothbreakers. The only change I've made is to add an additional tablespoon of anise seed. This upped the anise flavor to a good level.

Rating: 3
I thought these were great, but will follow another baker's suggestion and subsitute an anise liquor for the brandy and add another tablespoon of anise seed next time around. I prefer a little more anise flavor. Great, simple recipe!

Rating: 4
Classic, simple, not too sweet, right texture, and reminisent of a bakery in Boston's North End. Excellent. I made five different bicotti recipes for holiday gifts and this one was my favorite. Personally, I would increase the anise seed and extract a bit to make slightly more pungent, but that's a personal preference. One could easily add some almond extract as well. BTW... I doubled the recipe, cooked two flattened logs on a silpat sheet side by side, and had no problems.

Rating: 4
Superb! I did make a few minor alterations: added 1 tsp almond extract (no anise extract), about 1 tbsp orange zest, only 2 tbsp brandy (all I had), a bit less flour and 1.5 cups of sugar. I had no problem at all shaping dough. I used whole almonds but they would taste as good without them. Best biscotti I've ever made.

Rating: 4
Wow! This is a great biscotti! I have been making anise biscotti for 4 italian men that have been eating anise biscotti their whole lifes. They tell me it is the best they have had! Few changes were made to satisfy their tastes. I added more anise flavor. So my changes are, I used Anisette liquor instead of the brandy. I also used 3 tbs of anise seed (1 ground, 1 crushed, 1 seed). I also tried it with 1/2 tsp almond extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla. I toasted the almonds which makes a huge difference. I baked it the requested time and it came out perfect. I sprayed the cooled loaf which did help with the crumbling. Thank you Nana for a wonderful anise biscotti receipe!

Great biscotti recipe. The "log" really expands so give it plenty of room to grow. I thought it was a little too sweet and would cut back on the sugar. Otherwise it was perfect.

Rating: 4
This recipe is equally good with or without nuts. I used imitation anise used by commercial bakeries. Used three teaspoons of the extract and one heaping teaspoon of aniseed. For second baking I left the temperature at 350 deg.F and baked for approximately 10 minutes on each side. Prior to second bake, sprinkle cooled logs with water. This minimizes crumbling.

I have always added the almonds but would not hesitate to try it without. Am sure it would be fine. Best biscotti recipe I have found!

Great recipe. Everyone loved them, even my kids. And it makes a lot. I dipped some in chocolate(even though they don't need it) just for looks, and arranged in a platter with plain ones and they looked beautiful on my Christmas dessert table. I mean picture perfect. I used more almonds and almond extract vs. anise extract. Using water vs. flour on you hands for shaping the logs works great. I did have to refrigerate the dough for a while. Will definitely make again.

This receipe is awesome! I added some almond flavoring too...and it was just sensational! I agree with one of the other reviewers, don't use extra flour on your hands when shaping the dough, use water on your hands. I tried one batch with flour on my hands and the dough became a bit too dry and broke easily. When I used the wet hand method, the dough was easily shaped and came out perfectly. The taste is over the top, especially for those that love anise!! Great recipe.

Rating: 4
Excellent recipe. Makes a lot of biscotti. I separated the dough into four logs for smaller cookies; otherwise the logs get pretty big and the cookies break easy. Use the non stick foil on the cookie sheets and chill the dough before working with it. Use water on your hands instead of flour when shaping the logs.

Wow! I've been making biscotti all week in preparation for St. Joseph's Table at my church and I am soooooooooo glad I stumbled onto this recipe. I thought the biscotti that I had already made were good but - hah - was I wrong. This is a fabulous recipe that's sure to be a hit with everyone who is lucky enough to eat them. I once ate almonds at a friends house in Italy that were like no other almonds I had tasted before and by chance I came across almonds from Italy at my local health food store which I believe kicked this recipe up a notch...not that it needed any help.

Biscotti is a much loved food tradition in our family. A staple I grew up on. This recipe is one of the best I've ever tasted--and my family quit agrees. I've made these several times, and always have rave reviews. Dough tends to be a little wet--putting in the frig for a short time-and using wax paper to handle, cuts down on some of the mess.

Good enough I had to add extra flour to make it workable (to shape it into logs) Also had no brandy so add two mandrians that I gave a whirl in my food processor. Yummy Yummy Yummy ( I ate the crumbs that occurred during cutting into slices. These are very nice

Nice & easy. Try making your fingers wet when you are ready to spread out to bake (Less Messy). Also I do not bake it a second time to dry out the pieces.

Have doubled the anise extract and did without the anise seeds. Baked a cup of coconut so it would dry out, then added at the end and folded in with the almonds. Also added more almonds to the recipe. These are the greatest. Before you know it, you'll need to make more.

Flavor was excellent. I think the brandy did it. But the biscotti crumbled too easily when you bit into them. They weren't hard and crunchy like I expect biscotti to be. I didn't underbake them (have beeen making biscotti for a long time). Perhaps it's just a personal preference...

These biscotti are great! Biscotti lovers and non-biscotti people all raved about them.

Excellent! I added 3 tabelspoons of anise seed, ground with some of the sugar in a coffee grinder then added it to the rest of the sugar and butter.I increased the almonds to 2 cups. I put all of the dough on a wax paper lined 13"x 9" cookie sheet, spread it to fit the pan, and put it in the freezer. When hard, sliced into 3 logs, baked one and returned the rest to the freezer.

I have been looking for an excellent anise biscotti recipe for two years. I finally found it!
