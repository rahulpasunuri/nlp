very tasty and easy to prepare mid week after work. the tomatoes I used were a little sad, so a shot of tomato paste gave it a nice boost.

Even w/out the capers it was a great meal!! My boys ate the whole lot and wanted more..did cheat a bit and added some chicken stock for flavour and a bit of white wine we were gonna have at dinner... Mmmmm, what a meal!

A keeper! fast and easy! I followed recommendations adding white wine and not over cooking the fish. I used 2 cans tomatos. I served it over raw spinach with a side of wild rice/mushrooms. Impressive!

Excellent dish! I added some baby spinach leaves and 1/4 c. white wine to the sauce just before pouring mixture over the tuna. It was delicious.

I kept re-reading the recipe, trying to figure out what I'd done wrong. So many people liked this, but mine turned out so bland that it made me want to cry to think I'd wasted tuna steaks in this way.

great recipe. As others have mentioned, the cooking time for the tuna is too long. We did 90 seconds each side on Med heatbut next time will try 30 seconds on Med High. Add some salt & pepper to sauce if using a Vidalia onion

I adapted the recipe, piggybacking on the improvements from other reviews, basically grilling both the Ahi and onions (to caramelize them). I also added wine and more capers. If you don't have fresh tomatoes or fresh basil, I wouldn't bother. Heat grill. Rinse the ahi and cover with 3 T Italian Salad dressing (or Basque Fish Sauce) and top with 2 T olive oil and heavy dose of fresh pepper and ground salt. Allow to marinate. Put 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil in small bowl and toss onion rings in bowl, with about 3 T olive oil and plenty of fresh ground salt and pepper. Put onions in a Pam sprayed grilling basket and grill over low heat, turning 2 or 3 times for about 10 minutes, until limp and caramelized. Meanwhile, in a heavy large skillet over medium heat add 2 T olive oil and begin to sauté an additional ¼ C onions for a couple of minutes, add the chopped garlic and cook both until tender, about 3 minutes. Add in tomatoes and cook down for 3 minutes, then add the wine and the capers. Chop the grilled onions and add to the pan. Simmer on low, uncovered until mixture thickens, stirring occasionally, about 10 or 15 minutes, while preparing Ahi. While grill is hot from onions, add the Ahi and grill 3 - 4 minutes on each side, depending on thickness but it should still be pink in the center. Cover with thickened tomato mixture and serve with ? Quinoa cooked in broth, a shallot and a few red pepper pieces and freshly steamed Red Swiss Chard, served in browned butter with a bit of Tamari (aged Soy Sauce - every kitchen should have on hand). Hope this is helpful...it turned out great and was about 30 minutes start to finish.

This is a delicious recipe--great combination of flavors. I grill the tuna to medium rare and then top it with the tomato mixture. I also use about 2 tablespoons of capers and don't rinse them--it adds to the flavor of the dish. It's even good with good quality canned tomatoes if you don't have fresh.

DO NOT cook an expensive,piece of Tuna for more then a couple of minutes per side. Tuna is not fatty and over cooking dries it out. The dish needs more of a flavor punch.I will try good canned tomatoes and more capers.

A real winner. Some prep, but it goes together quickly. If you love capers you can triple the recipe. Three minutes per side that's it for the Tuna, if it's sushi grade, do not overcook.

I made this for the second time with a few minor changes: I used grape tomatoes (cut in 1/2) instead of Roma's. I also prepared the onion and garlic in advance and then reheated it just before serving adding the other ingredients at the end...PERFECT and the flavor really popped. My only other change was to reduce the cooking time on the Tuna. The time suggested left the tuna tough and over-cooked. I now cook no more than 90 seconds per side...much nicer.

As I was making this on a weeknight, I decided to simplify. I used frozen minced onion and canned diced tomatoes. This shortens the prep time considerably and I don't think it lost much in the flavor dept (although fresh is always better if you have the time) It turned our beautifully and I will be adding it to my staple of recpies!

As suggested by some, I seared the tuna separately, drizzling olive oil and some white pepper on top beforehand. For the sauce, I also added a bit of dry white wine. Delish and so easy to make. Served it with some quinoa.

Very tasty & light! Just a few tips: The cooking time for the sauce is less than 15 minutes. Buy good tuna, sear it (or cook to your desired temp) and don't add it to the pan...just top with the sauce - that way your tuna isn't overcooked. Top with some extra chopped basil right before serving. Rinse your capers extra well!! Enjoy!

This recipe was a great variation for Ahi tuna steaks. My husband, 1 & 2-year-olds loved it! I made it with Orzo Mantecato with Asparagus and Parmigiano Cheese. The only recommendations I have for changing this recipe is to use grape tomatoes (cut in half), use sweet onions instead of white, to add white wine with the tomato/basil/caper mixture, and to thoroughly rinse the capers so they are not too salty. The orzo Italian rice is easier to make and tastes better than risotto according to my family. Here is the recipe for the Orzo Mantecato with Asparagus and Parmigiano Cheese: INGREDIENTS: 2 quarts (64 ounces)chicken broth 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil 1/2 cup chopped white onion (I like sweet onion better) 1 box(16 oz) Orzo 3/4 cup dry white wine 2 lb sasparagus, cut into 1/4" pieces 2 tablespoons butter 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano cheese 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley DIRECTIONS: HEAT chicken broth in a 4 quart pot. HEAT oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onions and saute for 2-3 minutes. ADD Orzo and wine; cook until wine evaporates. Add asparagus pieces. ADD one ladle of the hot chicken broth at a time to pot; stir and allow to cook, adding more chicken broth as needed. Once broth evaporates and Orzo is cooked completely, remove from stove. ADD butter, cheese and parsely. Continue to add more broth to thin as desired. Mix well and serve. It is absolutely delicious! May you and your family enjoy!

as is, i don't think this recipe is remarkable. i altered it quite a bit to give it some deeper, but still simple flavors. for one, i doubled the amount of garlic, added the juice of half a lemon with tuna while searing, and 1 1/2 tbsp. of chopped kalamata olive to the sauce. this is a basic recipe that can be easily altered to fit your own tastes.

This was a great recipe- lukewarm reviews made me hesitant, but no regrets. Marvelously easy, and the flavors mix brilliantly- particularly the capers, definitely don't leave them out. One comment: I agree with other reviewers to ignore cooking instructions for the tuna...way too long. Just watch it yourself to be sure it's cooked on the outside and fairly pink at the center- or it will be rock hard.

Be careful not to overcook the tuna otherwise it'll be dry. Loved the sauce and it added flavor to cook the tuna in the sauce for the last step. I enjoyed it, my son loved the sauce but the tuna was to dry and my husband loved the whole thing.

I have a house of picky eaters. They don't like "chunks of stuff" in their food. With that said, I still wanted to make this dish.

Took the previous poster's suggestion and put the basil in at the end (a couple minutes before adding the tuna). Cooked the tuna only 1 minute per side, then 2 minutes in the sauce, which was plenty even with the thick steaks I had. Easy and a nice compliment to the tuna.

I have not yet made this dish, but I am highly suspicious about any recipe that calls for cooking basil for 15 minutes. Basil is extremely heat sensitive, and a 15 minute stewing should just about kill it. If i make this recipe, I'll but the basil in at the end; but if I do this, will i really need as much basil as is indicated in the ortiginal recipe?

Great recipe! If you prepare it as directed the tuna steak is well done. Personally, I like it rare to medium otherwise you might as well be eating canned tuna. Other than that thought it was a very good recipe, I too served it over wilted spinach sauteed with garlic and onions. Very impressive presentation, dinner party worthy.

The sauce was subtle, perfect for the tuna as it did not overwhelm it. I julienned the basil and added it toward the end of the cooking time. Did the steaks three minutes on a side, placed them on a bed of wilted baby spinach that had been sauteed with finely minced garlic and ginger, and then topped with the sauce. Served jasmine rice with a drop of white wine stirred in at the end. Wow, what a meal!! The flavor of the spinach was marvelous with the tuna.

I thought this was great. Very simple to prepare, very little clean-up, extremely healthy, yet wonderfully delicious. I took the advice of other readers by adding white wine to the tomato mixture and I reduced it down.

We enjoyed it with a fruity rose wine which was an excellent compliment to the flavors.

I found the dish to be rather bland. I rarely use much salt in my cooking, but even I added some after it was served to give it more flavor. I actually cooked it less time than stated because I dislike overcooked fish, but it still came out a little overdone for my taste. Ahi tuna is great when it is a little rare in the middle.

This is the first time I've cooked tuna steaks myself, so I wanted a simple sauce that wouldn't overpower the fish. I loved the sauce. I used a can of San Marzano tomatoes and only about 2 Tablespoons of olive oil. I also added some crushed red peppers, which gave the sauce a nice kick. I also crusted the tuna steaks with a fairly heavy coating of coarsly ground fresh black pepper, before grilling (3 min/side), which added a lot. Next time I think I'll cut the grill time to 2-2.5 minutes. Very easy and fresh dinner.

This was a great dish. However, I wanted it to be low in fat so I modified the recipe. Instead of oil I used chicken broth and I also used pam spray to brown both side of the tuna. It turned out great and I recommend cooking it this way if you are looking for a low fat delicious dinner.

This is tastes excellent and is so simple and fast. I used a can of diced tomatoes since fresh ones aren't great in winter. I partially cooked the vegetables in the pan first, moved them to the side and then added the tuna steaks. By the time the steaks were cooked through, the vegetables were ready. I've made this several times and it's always great. You can add extra vegetables (zucchini, for example) and it's still great.

This is a really nice recipe which I served atop garlic mashed potatoes. I made this for one of the most finicky eaters I know and he and his wife both loved it. I also doubled the garlic but used a 1/2 tblsp less capers. I like the basil whole, it's a treat every other bite! With the tomato based sauce, it goes well with a lighter red wine. We had it with a Cote du Rhone. "Better than at a restaurant!" my finicky friend exclaimed.

I served the sauce over grilled tuna which worked out fine. My husband bought albacore vs ahi - a big mistake. Stick with the ahi. I suggest chopping the basil and adding more than the recipe calls for. The basil flavor didn't come through. I also doubled the garlic.

Rating: 3
The sauce is very tasty and easy. I used a bit less than the two cups of onions and tripled the garlic. I substituted grouper for the tuna, because personally, I think the taste and texture of tuna suffers when it is cooked, as this recipe calls for, to the point of being opaque. (When I am fortunate enough to get my hands on some fresh tuna, I prefer to sear it on a hot grill and serve it rare.) The grouper worked very well in this recipe, which I think would also be true of swordfish or halibut. I served it with a pinot grigio, which is my favorite wine to pair with provencal-type fish or poultry recipes such as this one. I find it far preferable to chardonnay, because the oak flavor that is present in most chardonnays clashes with the capers, garlic, tomato, and basil, in my opinion.
