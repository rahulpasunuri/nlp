I made this as a quick Friday night meal. It was easy to prepare and so delicious.I sustituted cognac for the anisette. The polenta was outstanding!

I expected this to be better given the Pernod. I wouldn't make it again, because there are too many other great sounding shrimp dishes to try.

I have made this twice in the last week! Once with my sister, then for my husband, he raved about it. I did not put the liquor in it as I didn't have any and it tasted great!

this was an unexpected delight and came together at the very end. i am NOT a fan of anise, so i cut the liquor in half. the result was a hint of anise, but it highlighted the shrimp. i used instant polenta with the liquid proportions from this recipe - this was incorrect. i should have maintained the liquid proportions from the polenta instructions. however, my guests raved, so i will be making it as they requested again.

Outstanding recipe. Substituted scallops for the shirmp - worked like a dream. Simple and superb. (left over Polenta worked well on the grill the next day - BONUS)
