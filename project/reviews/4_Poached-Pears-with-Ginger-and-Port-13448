Fabulous poached pear recipe. I added a vanilla bean. I had LBV port instead of tawny, so I cut back on the sugar. It was great. I made it again and let it soak for two days and it was even better.

Absolutely Delicious. I cut pears in half like another cook but mine cooked perfectly, in about 40 min. Maybe hers were too ripe? Also subbed OJ for lemon juice, but next time will use lime. Overall maybe just a bit sweet. Love the ideas of cloves and vanilla ice cream & will definitely use in future versions. Hubs said it was good (that's high praise).

This is a keeper, light, pretty and tasty and easy. I served it with some creme fraiche and everyone gobbled it up. I have made this twice and the second time I added a spoon of finely chopped crystalized ginger and syrup to each pear. It is a perfect ending to a rich meal.

This was terrific. I used both bartlett and french butter pears which were nicely ripened. They took about 30 minutes to poach thoroughly. The texture was out of this world. Somewhere between silk and velvet. Served with a dollop of vanilla bean ice cream. definitely will be making again.

This is a good recipe to play around with. I modified it heavily in order to produce some amazing flavors and to use the ingredients I had on hand. I substituted the port for a cream sherry. I did not cook the ginger as prescribed but rather used small pieces of baby ginger and allowed for them to added to the poaching liquid. I added additional flavors of star anise (2 pods), clove (about 5 pieces), black peppercorns (a small pinch). I added a teaspoon of rosewater and substituted the sugar with lightly packed brown sugar. The end result was amazing with some small green Comice pears.

i didnt use the ginger- i didnt have any and it was snowing... i switched to cloves instead... ill try the true recipe next time but the cloves were lovely, spicy and perfect for the season. Next time i will serve some vanilla ice cream alongside. it would have been lovely.

I made this with 4 small seckel pears and served it in martini glasses with a dollop of sour cream (sweetened with broun sugar) on the bottom, and a few fresh blueberries on the top. It was a smash hit. It was the perfect ending to a full meal and my guests LOVED it.

Wonderful! I made this with little tiny pears and it was a refreshing, light ending to our Thanksgiving feast. Each pear was only a couple of bites. I made it the day before and it developed the darker color than another cook was looking for. I also cored the pears from the bottom before poaching, so all that was left was the stem. Very neat and easy to eat.

Someone asked about the purpose of pre-simmering the ginger. One of the best things about this recipe is the balance and subtlety of the flavors. It doesn't simply view the pears as sponges for other tastes. Cooking the ginger keeps it from being overpowering (and it makes your kitchen smell nice). You end up tasting the port, the ginger, the pears, and the lemon. Sauce reduction is inefficient, so I'd recommend using a deep pot of narrow width and weighting the pears to reduce the pear to liquid ratio. You could also cook the sugar first to carmelize it rather than simply dissolving it in the liquid.

Help! I did something wrong. The flavor was great - but my poaching skills must need some work. I did cut the pears in half instead of leaving them whole - because I wanted it to be easier to eat and didn't have a way to core them without doing that. Maybe that is part of the problem. But the outside of the pears was turning to mush while the inner portion was still quite firm. What do I need to do to make it perfect next time? The flavor was fabulous!

Very good ... worth making for syrup alone. Skipped fuss of ginger root, used heaping T jarred minced ginger, strained after removing pears and cooking down. Used only 1/4c sugar, plenty sweet and syrupy. Love the bite of the lemon juice. Definite keeper. Do make ahead --

Excellent. I used d'anjou pears, Dow's tawny that I brought back from Portugal (which is a little younger, redder, and sweeter than many. Used the reviewers recommendation of good vanilla ice cream - were even better. A warning - wait for the sauce to cool before adding the ice cream - the ginger-vanilla soup was very tasty, but the elegance of presentation was lost.

Substituted grade B maple syrup for the sugar and served with homemade vanilla ice cream. Hours after dinner I was still receiving compliments.

These pears were wonderful, even for someone who usually does chocolate. This recipe is easy and tasty. I started early in the day- didn't have any ginger on hand, so I used some fresh bottled ground ginger (not powdered!) and put it into a fillable tea bag (which by the way are GREAT for putting spices into that need to be removed later). I didn't discard it though, and kept it in the liquid poaching the pears. The sauce was fabulous and easy- used a good tawny port. Having read the previous reviews I was concerned about getting the sauce syrupy enough, overdid it right at the end, and ended up with the sauce turning to candy!- still was good though, and will watch more carefully next time.-- oh, also, you can get the tea bags at haiTea.com.

These were fabulous. The vanilla ice cream (get the good stuff) is a great recommendation -- the creaminess of the ice cream offsets the slight ginger-spiciness of the pears in a great way. Also the ginger keeps the recipe from becoming too sweet. Thanks to the previous reviewers, I started early enough to allow lots of time for reduction of the sauce. I quadrupled the recipe and it took well over an hour of constant boiling to get the syrupy consistency -- but well, well worth the wait!

These were simple but very tasty. I served them to my friends at a dinner party and they raved. I served them hot with vanilla ice cream and gingersnaps. PERFECT!

I loved it. I didn't have ginger so I added some Dutch Cinnamon, a small piece of Star Anise and for extra color I added some Cabernet Sav. I simmered the pears for 45mins and then reduced the sauce for about another 40mins. The sauce is awesome. We also had some good vanilla icecream on the side.

I made this last night and we both thought it was very good. The only frustration was in reducing the sauce. I added the extra water in order to cover the pears, which meant that it took close to a half hour to get the sauce down to 3/4 cup. It was a bit more effort than I was up to on a week night, but the results were quite delicious.

This is more my husband's rating than mine. I thought it was too sweet, but I reduced the sauce A LOT and we used a rather cheap ruby port (they are sweeter than the tawny's). But very easy. Served with fresh whipped cream and dusted with cocoa powder. I put a piece of parchment paper over the pears to keep the moisture in and keep the pears submerged (and then weighed the pears down with a small pot cover).

Delicious and very easy to make. I used Bosc pears and an Australian Tawny Port. The pears were pale, but the sauce was a nice light amber color after reducing for quite a while. Next time I'll serve it with a scoop of French vanilla ice cream.

Very nice. To the cook in Prague: I had the same problem with my sauce, however, you may add a cornstarch mixture of 1tbs cornstarch to 1tbs cold water to the liquid to thicken. Make sure that your cornstarch mixture is cold so as not to produce lumps. I also add about 1/4tsp vanilla to the cornstarch mixture. I hope this helps. Very delicious despite my thickening flaw, and, recovered nicely with cornstarch mixture.

Where did I go wrong? The recipe sounded like a can't lose, but it lost. The sauce was far too thin and watery, the pears didn't have enough of the sauce taste, and everything was unappealingly pale. Perhaps I cooked the pears too fast, and added too much water while poaching. I would say one caveat is *be sure* to use the smallest saucepan possible so the pears are submerged without too much extra water. I'll try again but was disappointed this time. PS: Out of curiosity, why do you simmer the ginger first before adding sauce ingredients together?

Instead of discarding the water after simmering the ginger in the first step, I saved it, added sugar to taste (I added about 6 tsp) and I had a delicious ginger tea. So this recipe is really two recipes in one. Ginger is great for nausea and digestive problems (according to the Chinese)...this tea is great. Oh, so are the pears!!
