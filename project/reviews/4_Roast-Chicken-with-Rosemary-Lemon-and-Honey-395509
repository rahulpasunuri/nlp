Certainly more fragrant than your run of the mill roast chicken as it bakes, but I did not find the flavor any better or the skin and crisper than usual.

I made this recipe at the start of August and loved it. My wife then bought a chicken last Saturday and asked me to roast it whilst she was out. I started the prep work and realised I only had one lemon. So I used 1/2 lemon inside the bird and cut 2 slices off the other 1/2 and put them on top of the bird. I squeezed a little juice from the remaining lemon for the mix. Realising I didn't have enough juice I wondered what I could use. There in the fridge was a bottle of Lemoncello. I poured a nice big glug into the mix! And oh my Lord, what a result. The skin was tastier and stickier. Next time I make this recipe I am going to use Lemoncello again!

This was a great recipe. It produced really great flavors and a very moist chicken. The finishing cooking time was a bit iffy - the chicken was still undercooked at 10 minutes so I cooked it a total of 30 minutes at 425. Next time I may try substituting half the rosemary for thyme to offset the slight bitterness that rosemary imparts. But all I loved the honey, lemon and herb notes. Yum!

Delicious and easy. If you are a fan of lemon chicken, this is a superb recipe with lots of tangy shallots and lemon. I doubled the lemon juice and used Meyer lemons; I basted every 15 minutes. This paired well with a wild rice pesto pilaf and al dente steamed broccoli. Very satisfied with this recipe.
