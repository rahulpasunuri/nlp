My husband and I really enjoyed these cookies for Erev Rosh Hashanna. But could someone please explain exactly how to assemble them because I don't think that the recipe was entirely clear and I ended up with some interesting looking cookies that looked nothing like a stick (although they tasted good!!).

this was easy to make with great results, they kept well too, in a airtight container

The first time I made it, the filling came out during the baking process. I just had to try again because of the wonderful flavor. This tima I seperated the dough into 3 pieces. When I rolled them out, I rolled them quite thin and spread the mixture all the way across leaving 1/2 inch on either side then rolled it up like a jelly roll. I baked it whole for 10 minutes longer. I waited about 5-10 minutes then sliced into pieces. The results were amazing. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of rose water to the honey filling after it was done cooking plus added and extra 1/4 cup walnuts to thicken the mixture. No filling came out this time and the crust is now thin and crispy rather than thick and hard.

There is a similar recipe in The Classic Cuisine of the Italian Jews by Edna Servi. Her recipe uses olive oil, which makes a wonderful cookie. I make these every year for Rosh Hashannah. Gift idea - wrap the uncut stick in blue foil or plastic wrap and tie with a silver bow. Makes an impressive gift

These are really wonderful and a great way to impress people w/your culinary skills! They are extra work so only do it when you've the time. I rolled the dough out a bit thicker b/c it was easier to roll. When the cookies were done they looked a bit like hotdogs wrapped in a blanket and I wonder if I made a mistake at some point. Was the filling supposed to seep out slightly or stay flush w/the dough. Any suggestions? In any case, these cookies are wonderful. They taste great and look pretty. Nice for the holidays.

I have a recipe for fig filled cookies that call for yeast in the dough. I liked this one a little better as it doesn't have the yeast taste. Thanks.
