Made these for a dinner party and everyone loved them. Using quality chocolate is important, as that is the primary source of flavor. Very rich - I served with vanilla ice-cream and fresh strawberries. Definitely needed that to curb the richness. Made ahead of time. Buttered and dusted dishes with cocoa powder and cakes came out very easily. Removed from refrigerator 30 minutes prior to baking; took about 16 to bake. Will absolutely make again.

Easy! The recipe is excellent! Placed the souffle dishes in the fridge and popped in just after dinner. Waited 14 minutes and out popped PERFECT chocolate cakes, with nice mushy centers. We ate ours with HD Vanilla Bean Icecream!

This cake was a big hit. I put canned strawberries in the blender (without the juice) to make a strawberry sauce which I put under the cakes, and which cut the richness a bit. I also put whip cream on top, but make sure that you put it on immediately before serving, because since the cakes are still hot, it starts to run pretty quickly. I made the batter the day before and kept it in the fridge overnight and did not have any problems.

Fast, easy and tasty! I made them for a birthday dinner and everyone loved them. Made batter earlier in the day. Doubled recipe with no problems. Buttered ramekins, then dusted with cocoa powder. The 18 minute cook time is negotiable. I made a sample one earlier in the day to make sure they'd be ok for the party. Just mixed and alone in the oven, 18 minutes was fine. When I made the rest that evening, with batter that was closer to cool than room temperature, and with 11 ramekins on 1 baking sheet in the oven, they hadn't even begun to rise at 18 minutes. Just keep an eye on them when cooking and remove when the center (size of a quarter) is still liquid. Next time I'll try tucking a truffle in the center before baking, as a reviewer suggested.

The best chocolate cake we ever had ! We were 9, so I doubled the ingredients... all gone in less than 15 minutes. I served it with vanilla ice cream instead of the whipped cream. It was fantastic !

Absolutely delicious! Made in advance for Easter dinner - but cooked just prior to serving - came out perfect, and everyone LOVED them! Going to make again this weekend

Here is what I've learned from experimenting with most of the comments below: 1. Use great chocolate; 2. Butter the ramekins then dust with cocoa powder; 3. Oven time will vary greatly based on the oven and type of ramekin; 4. Take the cake out of the oven when the uncooked portion is the size of a quarter; 5. Remove almost immediately from ramekin to keep the cake from continuing to cook; 6. Batter can be made the day before; and 7. Simple recipe with terrific results.

I've made this recipe three times and everytime it comes out better and better. My family says it is as good as a restaurant's and that's enough for me to want to make it again. Absolutely delicious! Be sure to use good chocolate such as Ghiradelli.

I find that of all the molten/lava/warm chocolate recipes that I have tried, this one is the closest to perfection! My husband and friend won't let me even THINK about making another dessert since I first started making this cake a few years ago. Try it with ginger or pink peppercorn ice cream. Divine!

A serious chocolate lover's dream. It is very similar to the molten chocolate lava cake served at many steakhouses. The receipe was quick (under 30 minutes total) and impossible to mess up. It came out perfect.

Based on reviews, it really can get quite frustrating contemplating to try a recipe. I just want to know the basics and would like them addressed. This recipe is very straightforward. Yes, you can double it with no problem. When you butter the ramkins with softened butter, the cakes slip out effortlessly. Yes, you can make the recipe a day ahead. There really is no difference in letting it come to room temperature or baking it directly from the refrigerator. When the batter is chilled, you just need to augment the time by a few minutes. Yes, the cake was done in less than 18 minutes, so after fifteen minutes I would check on the cakes in case your oven cooks quicker. You can tell when they are done, when the middle area(about the size of a nickel), looks still soft. I hope this is helpful.

I made this wonderful dessert to top off 2005 New Year's Eve dinner. It was a first attempt, and so simple to make--we all judged it as a "keeper". The first time, I carefully followed the various tips from all the comments. My attempt #2 was not so successful! I have one important TIP to add. If you mix and refrigerate before baking (as some suggest), BE SURE you take the dishes out of the refrig. to allow them to set out for about an hour BEFORE baking. I goofed, put the dishes right from the refrigerator into the oven. What a disaster! When I tried to unmold the cakes, they each swam all over the dessert plates. I couldn't figure out WHAT!?? happened, as the first attempt at New Year's Eve produced perfectly formed, molten centered cakes. However, I included the, obviously very impt step to allow them to set on the counter for an hour before baking. Wyhen I made them for the New Year's Eve dessert, I served these wonderful desserts on a coulis sauce (made from strawberries, raspberries, blackberries and framboise), and I topped each with whipped cream, a whole strawberry on top and a mint sprig. Don't forget the little XXX bam, too! So delicious if you follow the recipe!

I am a novice cook and was very pleased with the results of this recipe! I followed some of the tips the other reviewer gave. I buttered and then chilled the ramkins prior to filling them with the batter. I then chilled the filled ramkins prior to baking. I also used high quality chocolate (Valrhona). I baked a test cake at 350 degrees for 18 minutes it came out like a chocolate muffin. The next two I only left in for 14 minutes. They were perfect. The edges were very, very slightly crisp. The cake portion was very moist and the center was wonderfully gooey! I would highly recommend this dessert. They can be made several days ahead of time, if needed and are very easy to make!

This is an absolutely heavenly dessert! Thanks go to the reviewers who suggested coating the ramekins with butter then cocoa. They slid out perfectly! I also added 1/4 tsp of almond extract which added a subtle touch. I brought the prepared batter to a friend's dinner party, then just baked them in the ramekins right before dessert. A new favorite!

I don't know how many times I've made this. It is so good. Tonight I made it with strawberry whipped cream and fresh strawbs sliced thin on top. I also just bake about 14 minutes...until just barely set (every oven is different). I barely let the ramekins/souffle dishes cool enough to handle before inverting them onto plates. I will try the technique of refrigerating them prior to baking (as others recommended)and see if the extra step is worth making the change. I may also try the higher temp, less bake time that another reviewer did...would that make the outsides crispier while retaining the molten center?? So far, mine have been turning out just fine, but I'm game for the slightest improvements, even if it's hard to imagine improving on something that already seems so perfect.

I made this for a birthday party. They were wonderful! I brushed the ramekins with butter and put them in the refrigerator as one reader suggested. This worked great. I also made Emeril's chocolate sauce, put it in a squeeze bottle and drew a lovely design on the plates. It was very elegant. I completely forgot about making the fresh whipped cream so I just dusted the dish with powdered sugar. I only baked 3 of the 6. Save the rest and baked them the next evening. They were fine.

My husband & I have been making this recipe for five years now, although our original recipe came from Wine Spectator. Our recipe suggests baking only 7 - 8 minutes, although we've baked up to 12 minutes, depending on whether we use custard cups or glass molds. This is a great recipe to make ahead of time for a gourmet dinner -- we bake for the required time, put the cakes in the fridge, plate, then put the plated cake in the microwave for 15 - 25 seconds. Works like a charm every time...

This is very easy and really delicious. I made up a batch the morning of Valentine's day and put the ramekins in the fridge. That evening my sweetie and I each had one. We ate the remaining four over the course of the next few days and they were just as good as the first ones. A perfect do-ahead dessert or one to prepare and bring to friends for a special treat.

I made this recipe a couple of times and the second time was spectaculor thanks to previous advice. I buttered the ramekins and chilled them and buttered again. I also prepared this recipe in the early afternoon before starting on dinner and refrigerate it. Also as for backing, once I smelled chocolate, I took it out of the oven, and the center was ineed molten. Will certainly make again!

Although this recipe was very easy to make, I was disappointed with the fact that I did not get a molten centre. Did it have something to do with the cooking time or temperature? Or was it the fact that I used ceramic ramekins instead of tins? I'm not sure as I had followed the recipe quite closely. I filled it into four ramekins instead of six smaller tins. I would also like to try Jean-George's recipe to see if their is much of a difference.

Absolutely delicious!!! I am a big chocolate souffle fan and this cake reminds me of the souffles I love so much. I served it with ice cream and all of my guests loved it. I followed the suggestion to make the dessert a few hours ahead of time and chill it in ramekins that were twice coated with butter. I didn't pack the ramekins with sugar and my cakes came out just fine. The first one I tried to turn over collapsed so I was a little scared about the others, but I ran the ramekins under some cool water and the rest came out just fine.

AWESOME!!!! I made this dessert for New Year's Eve and I'm making it again for a dinner party two days later. I used bittersweet Sharffenberger chocolate and it came out fantastic. I can hardly believe it came out of my oven. A definite keeper. I served it with Frangelico ice cream (taken from another warm choc. cake recipe) and raspberries. It's perfect for a dinner party because you can do all of the prep work before your guests arrive.

Im in the middle of planning my New Years Eve party and came across this recipe, which I made several years ago with delightfully decadent results. Here I pass on the best tip I can. While searching for the correct tin to use for this dessert I ended up at Bridge Kitchenware here in NYC. I actually used Jean Georges recipe. The wonderful woman said "Oh, you're making that cake", directed me to the proper size tin, and while ringing me up said "when you start to SMELL the chocolate, its done" She knew it, I followed her advice, and it was absolutely perfect. Also I used Valronna Chocolate(excuse my spelling

I agree with Helios, even some of thr better chocolates available here in Providence yielded poor results(off flavor). Godiva seems to work best here in my New England kitchen...but I guess I'm just a crotchety old lady. My 19 year old son had had good luck with this recipe, also, though he prefers a locally (New England) produced chocolate. It's a definite member of this family's Recipes To Treasure File!

First saw this in a cookbook by Daniel Vezina (chef in Quebec). A common recipe, featured on Epicurious here food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105178 and food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=104604 Made this recipe several times. First, use high quality chocolate, e.g. Callebaut or Belcolade (around $12CDN/kilogram). Avoid cheap supermarket chocolate. Chocolate chips are especially bad. There is a free PDF about this at the Cook's Illustrated website. Second, the challenge of this recipe is making sure the heat flows from outside to center in a controlled manner. The center must be molten and the outside hard and about half an inch thick. If you keep ending up with it either completely cooked through or not cooked at all and you are tired of fiddling with the oven temperature, the Vezina recipe says to keep the mixture in the fridge for a few hours and then transfer to the oven. This will allow the center to be cool as the exterior bakes. The Aperto version of this recipe (see above link) uses a hand mixer to beat the recipe for a few minutes. This introduces tiny air bubbles which acts as an insulator. Same effect. Definitely serve this with soft ice cream, at near room temperature. A mild hot/cold contrast avoids tooth pain (happens to some). In winter, serve with colorful berries. If you are going with ice cream, you want the souffle to slide easily out of the ramkin, face down on a plate. Precoat rankins with melted butter, cool in fridge, coat more, cool again, and then PACK with sugar (Cordon Bleu approach). A nearby restaurant serves this dessert in the ramkin. At the table, creme anglais is poured in by the waiter and stirred. A final trick is to take a chocolate bonbon and bury it into the mixture. Changing the bonbon each time adds variety.

WOW! These were great - made them in the morning, refrigerated the batter, brought to almost-room temp for 1 hour before popping in over ( put in for extra 4 mins). Served with raspberries and mint sprigs along with the whipped cream - they were smashing! Very easy to make, I should add. Will make these again and again. The kids loved, these, too.

This was an easy, yet impressive dish for company. Like someone noted--it was great being able to make it earlier in the day and bake it during dinner. The only problem I had was the butter at the top of the ramekins REALLY smoked up the kitchen before the cakes rose enough--this did not impress the guests as much, esp. since my husband and i ran around the house de-activating all the smoke detectors before they woke up our 6 mos. baby. Despite the smoke the cakes were great, I plopped them onto plates with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream and it really did look like something we'd order at a restaurant.

I have made this several times, and once I made the batter ahead by about 4 hours and refridgerated it, the batter "stiffened up" a bit, and the cooking time was a bit off because I was using cold instead of room temp batter, but they came out fine and tasted the same, just had to adjust cook time.

Maybe it's just me, but I followed the recipe from scratch and my cakes came out of their molds in pieces - even the ones who did come out wholly didn't have a molten center.

An outrageous amount of butter, but that's why these cakes simply melt in your mouth. Very easy to throw together and they come out more cake-like than gooey. I plan to make them again the next time I entertain.
