My book club loved it and enjoyed the oranges with it.I used cognac instead of brandy, yum.

Excellent! Even though I refroze it, the ice cream seemed a little soft, and the brandy seeped out.

I made this for our gourmet group's Spanish themed tapas dinner. I made all of the components from scratch including the two different ice creams and the butter cookies. The only substitute I made was to use Amaretto instead of Brandy in both the ice cream mixtures and the oranges and honey. Everyone loved this dessert and even I, as a chocoholic, thought it was great. The oranges and honey were a wonderful addition. The group voted that this dessert and my Paris Opera Cake are their favorites so far.

I too skipped the oranges and honey. They were not missed. I did not allow my first layer to freeze long enough. As a result, My layers were not well defined. It was still very good. Two of my guests took the recipe home.

This is a wonderful dessert. Very easy to pull together too. A high-quality ice cream is important as it will hold together and refreeze better. The oranges just on their own are delicious as well!

What a show stopper! It looks like a lot of steps, but no more than a layered jello recipe. No rocket science here. And it can be made a couple of days ahead! Guests thought it was out of this world. I did, also. I used amaretto because it's what I had. Now the oranges---I made them, but really don't feel the dessert needs them what with the orange zest. Next time I'll top with a bit whipped cream, chocolate shavings---and maybe a cherry. It served 8, but because it is so rich, it would easily serve 10. I'd make it again in a heart beat. Well--maybe 2 days before. :)

This was so yummy. Definitely allow at least 4 hours to let it refreeze, though. I substituted amaretto for the brandy. I used Hagen Daz coffee ice cream and Breyers vanilla. I also used a pyrex loaf pan and it worked just fine. I did not make the oranges, but that would be a nice garnish. I served mine with chocolate cake. Mmmmm!
