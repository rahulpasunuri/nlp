My husband and I just made this dish tonight (with a few adjustments) and very much enjoyed it. We skipped the radicchio and since we didn't have a food processor handy, didn't add the mushrooms to the roux. Instead of parsley, we used rosemary and bay leaves and the juice and pulp of a whole lemon. Finally, we subbed smoked scamorza for the smoked mozzerella. Since I'm lactose intolerant, I was very fearful that the dish was going to be too creamy, however, it came out just right.

Great recipe and tasty but very ugly! I took it for leftovers the next day. and everyone cringed but it was good! Maybe a little bitter (dont eat cold) but I thought the smoked mozz with the radicchio was great! Make it with real lasagne noodles tho, dont know why they say no-boil.

This is an unusual take on lasagne that is a definite crowd pleaser. The combo of the smoked mozzarella and radicchio is awesome! Whenever I make this I use 1.5 times the amount of cheese and mushrooms. The radicchio mellows out during cooking, but it is definitely going to taste like the combination of ingredients, so if you don't like these flavors, don't make it.

This is quite possibly the most disappointing and awful tasting recipe I have ever made. It sounded delicious and intriguing; I love radicchio, mushrooms, and smoked cheese, but this was just terrible. Inedible, actually. The no bake lasagna noodles were disgusting and the overall taste was overwhelmingly mushroom--not in a good way--and smokey. What happened to the lovely bitter taste of the radicchio? It tasted like smokey dirt. Ugh

My husband loved it and asked for seconds, it was a bit too strong for me though. Call it a draw, if I made it again, I'd probably use regular mozzarella only.

This was a huge hit at a recent dinner party. Even the non-vegetarians went back for more. The prep took a couple of hours, but it was nice to be able to assemble everything the day before.

I used four layers (12 lasagne noodles) instead of 9, other than thatI made this pretty much as described. I cannot imagine that someone had a problem with the radicchio- it pretty much disappears after it cooks down. You could probably use grass from the front lawn and no one would notice. It's pretty good. The smoked mozzarella I used gave off a lot of oil, sick your cheese carefully. I pot some parmesan and romano on top, and then broiled the whole thing at the end to brown and bubble the cheese. Don't skimp on the radicchio filling or the mushrooms-next time I will add a few more sliced mushrooms to the mix.

Was skeptical that all these strong tastes would blend, but the lasagne was a big success. I used a mix of white and cremini mushrooms. Also made the sauce a day ahead of the lasagne and then kept the finished lasagne in the frig for a day before serving. My guests loved it. My only negative comment is that the dish doesn't look very appetizing -- kind of brown/black/gray. Definitely not for kids or unsophisticated diners. But yummy!

this is really good. it takes a while to prepare. i use romano instead of mozzarella, exotic mushrooms instead of white, 3 times more garlic, added oregano and onion. made it a few times. excellent.

I hae to say, I think that this recipe is getting a bum rap here. I have made it at least 10 times for just my family, for small dinners and for large crowds. Everyone always loves it. The thing is, you don't have to use the raddichio if you dont like that flavor. Because it can be expensive, I have substituted arugula, spinach, chard all work great.

I make this dish for guests when I want to do something a little unusual, and it's always a hit. One colleague asked for the recipe for his wife and went straight home and made it. I don't find it too bitter; maybe one reviewer got an unusal batch of raddichio. Also, I don't see how it could take 7 hoursl although I do use a food processor

Unless you're using a food processor, I would set aside about 7 hours to make this thing. It's pretty good after 7 hours of labor, though. I substituted grated parmesan for the gouda and it worked well. Also added white wine to one of the mushroom mixtures. Also didn't mince but chopped the mushrooms, using portobella, crimini and button.

OK, everything I've ever made from this web site that has a 4 fork rating is usually fabulous. This recipe was the first bomb, however. It has way too much raddichio. Cut it in half, at least! I took this to a party and only 1 row was eaten. It is way too bitter. Avoid this one!

I made this dish for a dinner with my boyfriend, and was quite pleased with the results. I wasn't sure when I saw the murky grey mushroom sauce, and I forgot the lemon juice, but it turned out great and with a wonderful flavor. I'll definitely make it again, perhaps next time for a larger gathering of people, though I don't mind eathing the leftovers!

Brought this to a potluck dinner, and I have to say, it didn't look very appetizing--sickly gray color referenced by earlier cook didn't bake out. However, the intrepid guests devoured it and really liked it. I didn't even get a taste. Also, I couldn't find the smoked mozzarella, so I substituted smoked Gouda--worked out fine.

I made this several years ago and everyone raved about it.I was so happy to find it again, although I had to scroll thru hundreds of recipes to find it since it didn't come up under "Lasagne". Anyway, I'm making it again tonight and I know it will be a big hit with my guests.

Absolutely wonderful!I have made this dish three times now and my guests always rave. But, i do not mke the mushroom sauce. I saute all the vegtables (including the mushrooms)with lemon zest and garlic and then use tomato sauce in place of the mushroom sauce. YUM!

Interesting and different recipe. All the mushrooms and the radicchio, along with the smoked mozzerella, give it a very deep, earthy flavor. I would make this again when I have vegetarian friends over for dinner. Don't be put off when you're cooking the radicchio as it turns a sort of ugly gray-brown color; the finished dish looks better.
