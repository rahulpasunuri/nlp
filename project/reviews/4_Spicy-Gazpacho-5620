Sunstituted fresh jalapeno for canned chilies and red onion for green - both added extra heat. Delicious!

YUM! I'm picky about my gazpacho and this one's a winner! Just because I know my palate, I used a combo of fresh and canned tomatoes, swapped fresh jalapenos for the canned chilies, added about half of a green bell pepper and doubled the garlic. Per another reviewer, I threw it all in one big pot and went at it with the stick blender -- great way to make it the precise consistency you prefer. My husband thought he didn't like gazpacho, but now he's a convert! Putting this one in the regular summer rotation, for sure.

so good! i usually don't like gazpacho, but this was definitely a winner. i substituted a fresh tomato and roasted red peppers for one of the cans of tomatoes, and used chipotle instead of chili powder.

So easy and delicious. I used the jalepenos and it worked out well. I also put a swirl of Greek yogurt on top to take forextra flavour and presentation.

Funny, a previous review had gazpacho craving whilst pregnant. I am too. I can't get enough tomatoes! This recipe is fantastic. Loved capers so used all of them. Can't wait to see what it tastes like tomorrow.

LOVED this recipe! For simplicity I used Ro*Tel brand diced tomatoes & green chilies (also available in mild).

I tend to muck about with recipes, but I always follow this one to the letter with great results. The combination of chunky and smooth makes for a nice textureand the ease of using canned tomatoes makes it a snap. I triple the recipe as part of menu for a 50 person party every summer and it never lasts!

Craving gazpacho in the midst of a summer heatwave, I just sampled a batch of this made about two hours ago. Quite good, with just a few adjustments based on preference and ingredients on-hand: substituted green pepper for the celery, and pickled jalapenos for the canned chilies. Also used a whole-wheat hot dog bun (just an improv) for the bread, but this could easily have been left out. Also found that just 2 tbsp of capers were sufficient, and used a lesser amount of ground chipotle chili which I felt equivalent to the tbsp of chili powder. Mixed up nicely in one batch in my 11-cup Cuisinart and, when combined with the reserved vegetables, yielded exactly 8 cups. Delicious combination of smooth & crunchy textures, and just the right bite of spiciness. If husband and son don't like this, I'll gladly eat it all myself!

This one is a keeper. I left out the bread, used pickled jalapeños and fresh chives instead of the green onions. Quick and easy and filling too.

I am pregnant and was craving gazpacho and boy did this satisfy! I used 2 parts canned tomatoes and 1 part fresh instead of the full canned amount, and also used fresh jalapenos (the full 1/4 cup) instead of canned mild chiles for an extra kick. It's also great as a salsa with corn chips. SO GOOD!

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!! Wonderful, spicy flavors and easy, easy to make if you use a stick blender! I just chopped everything, threw it in a big bowl and blended with the stick blender until it was the perfect balance between chunky and smooth. I used pickled jalapenos since that is what I had on hand, but actually, they tasted great and that's what I will use again. This will be made often at my house! I'm throwing my old recipe for Gazpacho away...it doesn't even come close!!!

Absolutely wonderful and very easy! I used all fresh tomatos and hot peppers from the garden in lieu of canned, and added some seasoned rice wine vinegar at the end because I felt it wasn't acidic enough (some of our tomatos are very low acid)... with wonderful results. Also, I skipped the bread. Garnished the bowls with a scoop of yogurt. This is really a nice gazpacho recipe!

Too easy for such good flavor. Served it at a brunch with a Mexican theme. Very delicious and well received. Recommended

MMMMMM, Gazpacho. This is a great recipe for the hot humid days of late summer. I love that it just got better sittingover night. I too used jalapenos in place of the cannned chillies.... and hit it with a splash of Grey Goose vodka!

Wonderful. Use jalapeno instead of chilies. I also used only half of the capers and it was great.

A really wonderful and refreshing gazpacho recipe--perfect for summer, but I think it's hearty enough for a full meal. We served it with nothing more than some fresh French bread and butter and it went over very well. Definitely agree with the ideas of increasing the garlic (but I suppose that's a personal preference) and using fresh jalapenos--both of these tips worked out wonderfully. Also, this gazpacho absolutely benefits from a good bit of resting and chilling before eating.

This is by far the most wonderful gazpacho recipe I've ever tasted! I replaced the can of mild green chiles with two rather large, fresh jalepeño peppers, finely minced. I also used three garlic cloves, rather than the two the recipe calls for. The initial taste (before it rested) was very spicy, and I was worried about it being too spicy for me to enjoy. But, after resting in the refrigerator overnight, the heat of the spice subsided considerably ... leaving a fabulous blend of flavors. I served it with fresh biscuits, but, as the cook from Bethesda mentioned, grilled shrimp along side would be a great addition. I'm really looking forward to the leftovers tonight!

Everyone that tried this gazpacho loved it... even my husband who typically hates gazpacho! It tends to be a little spicy (not for us!) so proceed with caution if you are not a fan of spicy food. I used red onions instead of green, which turned out to provide a very strong onion flavor. I also added roasted red pepper, which added wonderful depth. Great recipe and very easy to make!

Great recipe. Really liked the consistancy of blending most of the vegetables, then adding in the reserved diced products. I couldn't resist adding a little green pepper. Also substituted white onion for green. P.S. Make sure to use a good quality red wine vinegar, as I'm convinced that's what gives the soup its snap! Can make a really elegant first course by hooking a few marinaded and grilled shrimp on to the side of each bowl.

This is a delicious and easy gazpacho recipe - the best I've ever tried. The only reason I gave it three forks instead of four is because I modified the recipe slightly - I used fewer cucumbers, substituted jalapenos for green chilies, and added cilantro and cumin. I also left all the ingredients chopped instead of using the blender, so that the soup is chunkier.
