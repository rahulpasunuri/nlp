Quick, easy, tasty, and cheap. A few tips that work for me: for 'daily' use, I use 1/4 head of cabbage at a time and it makes 3-4 side servings in lieu of a salad. Rather than break-out the food processor, I shave the cabbage with a chefs knife. I keep some ginger frozen in the freezer and just grate some with a micro plane. Light dressing - a little sesame oil goes a long way. Wish I had some Ramen noodles as one user suggested - would be a killer addition. What a pleasant change from mayo-goop (which I love!).

I think this recipe is four forks with the exclusion of the spinach and the addition of cilantro, red cabbage and toasted sesame seeds. We ate it with grilled beef and pineapple kabobs. Delicious!

I wanted to love this, but it was only ok, though I admittedly did use the pre-packaged broccoli slaw as others recommended. If I were to make it again, I would try using fresh (not pre-bagged) cabbage/carrots, add edamame and/or cashews for crunch, and add green onions. I took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the ginger to 2 Tbsp - good call.

I really liked this recipe. It was fairly easy(as long as you have a handy-dandy food processesor), and also quite a nice addition alongside a protein for a simple dinner. However, I did not have rice vinegar, so I found out that I could use apple-cider vinegar instead. I also left out the carrots, and added shredded blanched broccoli, and 1/2 cup of green onions. It came out really good, though I strayed from the recipe- but its all about the fun right? And, it must be said that purple cabbage is a heck of a lot prettier than the green... I would be proud to bring this lovely little dish to a party!

Easy and delicious. Go easy on the minced ginger; it can overwhelm the other flavors. Added cashews at the end. Next time, I might toss in toasted, uncooked ramen noodles (no seasoning), instead of cashews, for crunch.

I added edamames and garbanzo beans, and sunflower seeds (instead of the sesame seeds) to this recipe and it turned out great.

Absolutely the best coleslaw. It keeps because there's no mayo and this makes it healthier too. Hands down one of my favorite fast and healthy recipes.

This coleslaw was perfect. I'm a somewhat pickty recipe chooser because of several factors: I have a tiny kitchen, I have little extra money, and I am a single woman who works long hours and doesn't want to eat out all the time, both for financial and physical reasons. This coleslaw is affordable, healthy, delicious and easy to make. I'm still munching on the leftovers three days later. Also, the flavor is exceptional. Since it's only me, I cut the recipe in half. I will probably use a bit more vinegar and bit less sugar next time, simply because I prefer less sweet. I definitely recommend this recipe.

Made this last night. Excellent for summer. I happened to have all the ingredients on hand. I will say that sesame oil does have a strong smell in my kitchen. I made with teriyaki steak kabobs and the kabobs marinade was wayyy too strong. The salad was the shining star.

The whole family liked it, kids and all. Super easy, all ingredients are on hand. Just making for the second time again tonight, in less than a week.

I'm rating this a 4 - which I rarely do - as this is so fabulously easy to prepare and is absolutely delicious. I used packaged coleslaw mix and added cilantro and green onion which I minced in the food processor. I also minced the fresh ginger in the food processor. Took all the ingredients separately to a summer BBQ and assembled just before serving, garnishing with the toasted sesame seeds. By the time I got to the salads, this was all gone, all others were still there! Rave reviews all round.

I didn't have the mix of vegetables that the recipe called for, so I made the dressing as directed and grated carrots, summer squash, and red bell peppers. Still fantastic!

Everytime I make this dish (which is very, very easy to make), I get raves and demands for the receipe - which I hate to give cause it's SO easy to make.

This was okay, but nothing to get excited about. Really. And I am a coleslaw and cabbage fan.

Like the other reviews I thought this was a very good take on typical cole slaw. I served it to friends and everyone was really surprised at how good it was. The dressing was perfect- not too heavy, but with a lot of flavor. I added scallions and cilantro to the mix for additional flavor. I also used the packaged cole slaw mix from the store. Not sure why you wouldnt use it.

A really great recipe! Made it for a Memorial Day BBQ. Everyone loved it. I did not have the Ginger on hand, but used brown sugar, added some cilantro, peanuts, and green onion, and it was delicious! I will defintely be making again.

My dog, Sapphira, is licking the bottom of the bowl for the last savory molecule of this cole slaw. And she is not even a Pekingese! Yes, it was definitely delectable. I did use a much smaller amount of dressing and added some garlic powder to it, and used brown instead of white sugar. I also nixed the spinach but added some green onion.

I've made this about 3 times and it always gets rave reviews. It is more interesting and flavorful then just regular old slaw.

This is a great recipe. Everyone had 2 or 3 helpings. Packaged coleslaw makes it very easy.

Yum this was great! Me and my family devoured this salad because of it's great flavor. Next time I'll cut back a little on the sesame oil and not use all of the dressing in the salad because it was a little overpowering. It had a nice preperation though.

For those of you not thrilled but game to give it another go, I suggest you take a look at the Asian Coleslaw with shredded turkey. That dressing is in the same ballpark but perhaps closer to what you're looking for. Be sure to read the reviews... there are some good ideas in there I've found very helpful.

I tried this recipe as I am always looking for summer salads which don't require mayonnaise...this is my personal favorite coleslaw recipe. Packaged coleslaw is the way to go (unless you just FEEL like shredding your own cabbage). Brown sugar adds a slightly deeper flavor than plain white, and I always add cilantro and scallions too. This salad keeps for days, but don't actually TOSS the spinach into the coleslaw...the dressing makes it limp very quickly!

Cut back a little on the sesame oil and this is a great recipe. Adding cilantro was a great idea. My thanks to the reviewer who added that tip!

Excellent coleslaw and a refreshing change from the usual creamy dressings. I added red onion, red cabbage, fresh cilantro and fresh bean sprouts to the mix - a very fresh tasting and crunchy salad with a great dressing. Will certainly make again and again.

I found the dressing on this salad way to strong, maybe it was the sesame oil. We usually really like this kind of thing. I made half a recipe and threw it all out!

Great coleslaw variation. Used prepared cabbage and carrots so it was quick and easy. Ginger flavor was just right.

Maybe I'd make this again, but I think I'd be more tempted to try something else. Thanks to previous reviewers for warnings about the ginger - you were spot on. I put in only 1 tablespoon, and that was good. this is refreshing, and nice, but not really as good as I think it could be. A little less sugar maybe, and definitely less ginger could improve it.

while it was good, it was not my best effort on asian style slaws. I prefer one that is similar but adds the crunch of rice noodles and the ginger level in this recipe was borderline overpowering.

Absolutely fabulous -- and so easy! The perfect summer salad dish, and a nice change from the usual. I will definitely make this one again.

This was really quite good. I've made it twice and I have to admit the second time I was in a huge hurry so I bought a couple of bags of pre-cut coleslaw mix (with carrots in it) and it was still very, very good. (in fact, no one could really tell the difference!) We love ginger so found that to us the amount called for was perfect. I served this with the Seared Tuna with Shiitaki Mushroom Sauce.

This is nice recipe, but next time I make it I will hold back on the ginger. It was too overwhelming -- 1 to 1 1/2 tablespoons would have been plenty.

LOVE this. Even my 7-year old stepdaughter does. If I'm in a hurry, I use a bag of the pre-shredded coleslaw and just toss it with the dressing in this recipe. Its so great!

We have made this receipe at least six times. We really enjoy the Asian flavors and all of our guests have enjoyed it as well.

This light wonderful variation was tempting when I read the recipe, but man, when I made it my husband ate the whole bowl! (He is very picky as well)
