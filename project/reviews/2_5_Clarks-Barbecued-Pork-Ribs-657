Not really a recipe. More like an ad for their sauce. Should be removed as unhelpful.

Tasted a little like wet dog. The bourbon rib recipe was way much better.

Next thing you know, a chocolate cake recipe in here will simply be "buy a box of Duncan Hines Mix and prepare as indicated". How in the world are they allowing this recipe to be on this website? AND with a phone # to order product mind you!!! Ridiculous.

This is a good, basic method of preparation. You can use any kind of sauce and rub you have on hand. Water in the pan keeps the ribs moist, and finishing on the grill gives just enough char. This is a good way for us city people, who don't have big outdoor charcoal grills, to make decent ribs!

Delicious! Used my own choice of rub and BBQ sauce - took this to a Father's day BBQ where there were five different offerings of ribs - and this was the favorite! Extremely tender - steaming in the slow oven and finishing with grilling them was perfect.

You can say whatever you like about the sauce "ad" but you absolutely cannot beat the technique used here. I applied my own local store bought (oh, the horror) rub and sauce and followed the instructions to the letter. I've been bbq-ing ribs for years and have never been satisfied with the results. This technique of steaming them in the oven and finishing them on the grill is flawless. I made them twice this month and had people begging for more both times. If you are a rib-a-phobic cook USE THIS RECIPE - Just buy/make your own sauce.

This is not a recipe. This is an ad. Shame on you! If you want to sell your merchandise, buy a real ad instead of shilling on the recipe page. I won't visit your restaurant either because of this. Shame!

I'm another who expected to find this recipe to be more than an ad for bottled sauce--no matter how good. I did use the instructions with a homemade barbecue sauce and the ribs turned out delicious. My sauce included onion, jalapeno, and bell pepper minced fine and sauted in butter. I then added cider vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, brown sugar, just a touch of ketchup, and a dash of liquid smoke.

I want to learn to try new things, and that is why I come to this site...for new RECIPES, not mail-order addresses! Come on! If I wanted to make regular ribs, I could have gone to the store and bought a bottle of sauce "off the rack!" If I want to try to make a recipe from a restaurant, I will go to a copy-cat recipe site. Next I suppose this site will offer "Hungry Man Special" recipes.

The rating on this recipe is distorted by all the people that didn't make it and thought that using store bought BBQ sauce was not 'cooking'. Reviews of 'tried and true' reviewers only please! Having just moved to Dallas we went to Clark's Outpost (see Zagat's) and happened to buy the BBQ sauce and rub as called for in this recipe. I found this recipe on Epicurious and had to try it. Great flavor and easy prep.

Have the coals in the grill REAL low and grill for at least 1/2 hour, add some wood chips for smoke, that will add flavor, tenderness, and dry the ribs out a bit. I think most everyone would agree to add the sauce no sooner than 10-0 minutes before coming off the grill. As for all this fuss about BBQ sauce, who cares? Im sure Clark's sauce is fine, this is no scandal. Get over yourselves.

This cooking method for ribs really works--the ribs were very tender. I made 12 racks of ribs for my husband's birthday and everyone raved. The Asian-inspired peanut-based barbeque sauce(read: time-consuming)from Bobby Flay's cookbook didn't hurt!

Rating: 2
I used a combination of two commercial barbeque sauces for this recipe and my own rub, but wanted to try this cooking method. I was disappointed because the meat wasn't "falling-off-the-bone" tender. It wasn't because the ribs were of poor quality so I'm assuming it was the method of cooking. However, this way of baking/broiling did taste like...off the grill. I'll look for another recipe for baking ribs.

I made these ribs for the Fourth of July using Lawry's seasoned salt and Bullseye bottled sauce (available in most larger grocery chains at reasonable prices with which I have no affiliation thankyouverymuch). They were easy, absolutely delicious and I will definitely make them again. I too do not understand all the fuss about the plug for Clark's. OK so it is annoying but ultimately it's the recipe that counts right?

Rating: 4
I am surprised at the poor ratings for this recipe. I understand that people think it is more of an advertisement for the sale of Clark's products but I'd like to thank Epicurious and Clarks for publishing it because with bbq its more important HOW you cook it than what you put on it. Use your own rub and sauce, copy another recipe's sauce or eat 'em dry with just salt and pepper, but this is the way to cook baby backs in the oven, if you don't have the time or inclination to slow smoke 'em.

Made this recipe last night for dinner. Used my own rub and bbq sauce. The ribs came out very tender. Only thing i would change, would be to add garlic and onion for flavoring at the bottom of the pan(in the bbq sauce, already boiling the ribs. Bbq'd for about 40 minutes on low-i like my pork tender. The cooking method is very good. As for the seasoning-personalize.

Rating: 4
I agree with the last review - what a fuss! The cooking method is great, and making up your own rub/sauce is really not that tough. As for this website/Bon Appetit "advertising" someone's sauce: I'm not a huge fan of recipes that make you buy a certain brand, but one of the fantastic services Bon Apetit provides is they obtain recipes for individual's who have eaten a memorable meal in a restaurant and want to know how the particular dish was made. If someone ate at Clark's, and that's how the ribs are made there, using that sauce...?! I'd rather have the recipe and then decide which sauce I will use.

This recipe really sucks. Such a disappointment to the BBQ fans. Give us the recipe for the sauce and the rub, which MIGHT enhance this dish. I, like the others, do not like this site selling one's product to have a recipe listed.

I agree with other reviewers, I like to cook why would I order bottled sauce? AND...I want to make it tonite. This is the first time I've ever seen such a faux pas on this website!!

Albeit, I agree with previous reviewers about buying Clark's bottled sauce, I don't think that this was worthy of Bon Appetit, BUT... this was a great method of cooking ribs in the middle of a snowstorm! I used my own barbecue sauce that I love and then made the ribs as directed, omiting the rub and just using salt and pepper, and they came out succulunt and delicious. Crispy on the outside, moist and falling off the bone. Couldn't have been easier, will definitely use this method again and again when grilling is not an option.

My goodness, what controversy over pork ribs! I also used different spices, but I wholeheartedly embrace the cooking method. I don't want ribs that require supreme effort, I want ribs that are especially tasty and that I can easily cook at home. The water / broil method is much better than any other home rib recipe. I always do my ribs this way now. With my preferred spices, I like this recipe better than any other I've had.

I have made this at least 5 times in the last year. I am a student with no BBQ so I made some changes. I don't use a rub or the Clarks BBQ sauce. I use my favorite sauce and follow the cooking directions for the oven. These ribs are as good or better than any ribs I've ever eaten. I haven't been to Texas or St Louis to taste authentic BBQ ribs so I'm not an expert. For somebody who can't use a BBQ and want some good easy to make ribs this works. Forget the rub and the Clarks sauce, use your own. Remember people this isn't a cooking dictatorship, you can make alterations to any recipe.

Tioga, Gene Autrey's hometown, is off the beaten trail, so most folks will never have the opportunity to eat some of the greatest Q in the world at Clark's Outpost. Why Warren Clark would offer up a substitute recipe that he doesn't even use, knowing that there is NO SUBSTITUTE for real pit-smoked barbecue, is beyond me. My advice is to just forget the recipe and get youself to Tioga. It's only about an hours drive north of Dallas. Once you've tried Clark's Q, you'll be "back in the saddle again!"

Why on earth would this site include a recipe where the cook does not even have to do just that? I can't stand recipes that require anything more than a trip to the nearest Safeway-- no one I know uses any place else other than the grocery store to buy their food. Come on, Bon Appetit!

I use a similar version if I'm in a hurry. I use either beer or bourbon instead of water and set the oven at no more than 250 degrees covered using my own rub and sometimes nothing more that salt and pepper. Cook for 2 hrs. then to my grill for an other hour with smoke for the flavor. Serve with my own sauce--never commercial.

AS A HEAD COOK FOR A BBQ TEAM IN TENNESSEE MAY I SUGGEST THIS AS AN SUB FOR THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE TIME TO ORDER MR CLARKS ITEMS , ALTHOUGH I AM SURE THEY ARE WORTH THE MONEY TRY TO USING KRAFT HICKORY BBQ SAUCE(12 OZ) WITH 1 TSP WHITE VINAGER AND 4 OZ COLD WATER MIX WELL. FOR THE DRY RUB- MIX 4 TSP SUGAR, 3 TSP SALT-2 TSP EACH- GARLIC POWDER-ONION POWDER AND 1 CUP OF PAPRIKA. IT SURE ISNT BBQ BUT IT WILL BE EDIBLE MRBBQ@BELLSOUTH.NET
