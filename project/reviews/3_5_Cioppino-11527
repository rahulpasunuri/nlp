Simplest and best cioppino ever. The liquid and what-all (I don't want to know) inside the top shell transforms mundane tomato puree into a rich, complex sauce. I used reconstituted dried gypsy peppers instead of fresh green bells, because that was what I had, and I added some fennel, an ingredient of some other cioppinos. One change I'll make next time: boil the crabs for a couple of minutes so they don't die a slow, noisy death knee-deep in sauce.

Excellent! A little spicy for the "faint of heart"... but what is wonderful about this recipe is how easy it is to tinker with! Add a little more or less of any spice listed to get your flavor right for you! I would have added a little less pepper flakes but some like it hot! :)I am a garlic addict so I added almost twice as much... I also did not have any crab, etc. so I just improvised with shrimp and scallops. I cut up two nice size tomatoes into teeny pieces and added on can of diced tomatoes and let it cook a bit... I like my soups a little chunkier than most restaurants serve them so I usually skip the puree part! I also wanted to get a little more out of it so I boiled the shrimp shells in about a cup of water to add to the base after straining. Gave it a bit more fish essence (since I skipped some of the other fish add-ons) without being overbearing. We really liked it and I will definitely make it again! It will be fun to tinker with it another time.

My husband's new favorite dish.

I skipped the tomato paste & added a can of diced tomatoes instead of the whole tomatoes. Shared this meal with friends at a casual dinner party who all thought this recipe tasted better than most restaurant ciappino. I agree!

I found this recipe and my husband (who's not an experienced cook) decided he wanted to make it! He bought shrimp, crablegs, scallops, clams and tilapia. He was all proud and excited to start but he really had me nervous....it cracked me up because he is so unexperienced, he didn't know how to read the recipe. I had to explain that the ingredients are listed at the top and the instructions are below---(because when he first looked at it he went right to the instructions and was like, "how do you know how much of each ingredient to use???") I actually had to explain to look at the list above the directions and it says the amounts. I walked away rolling my eyes, and scared to death we would be throwing out a small fortune of ruined seafood. He followed the directions very closely and to my astonishment----IT WAS GREAT, REALLY GREAT! ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS, A DEFINATE 4 FORKS, I'D GIVE IT A 5 FORK RATING IF THEY HAD IT. It worked out great. It's encouraged him to try cooking more, he wants to try more recipes. I love to cook, but I love when someone else cooks too---so this recipe will always be a favorite of mine if my husband cooks us a meal or two each week!!! Besides gaining a new cook in the family this really is a great cioppino recipe!

I was talking about San Francisco and Cioppino to my husband, who is dutch, to find out he had never heard of the dish nor had visited the West coast of the States. I made this dish to surprise him and it brought back some great memories of my visits there. I did add 1 tsp thyme, more oregano, red wine instead of white wine, and used mussels instead of clams. Mussels are abundant here in Holland, clams are a bit more difficult to find. My husband loved this dish. It was a very tasty and with a nice crusty bread and salad made a lovely dinner. My husband now wants to visit San Francisco and looks forward to the next time I make this dish!

Very good! I have followed this recipe a few times, all very successful. I add more oregano than indicated (2 tablespoons) and 3 bay leaves.

Made this dish with Dungeness crab, scallops, clams, and tiger shrimp. Excellent! The sauce is phenomenal. I agree with the person who said the hardest part was putting the crab in the pot. Easy to make and delicious.

This recipe equals the best cioppino we have had in restaurants. The sauce is not too thick or soup and is great to soak bread into or to add some pasta or new potatoes. I also added chopped celery and leaves and another 14 oz. can of chopped tomatoes. Crushed tomatoes in puree adds a thicker body to the sauce. Easy to make and easy to adapt seafood to one's preference.

since i live in san francisco, fish ingredients were easy to find. Used dungeness crab, also for my version i went ahead and used red wine - pinot noir instead of white wine, it was glorious! As a companion roasted a head of garlic for 40 minutes w/drizzled olive oil in foil then spread on crusty warm bread. And of course, add fresh lemon to the cioppino! I didn't used the spicy flakes, also I used cooked fresh crab....enjoy....

This is the first time I've made cioppino, and the hardest part about this recipe was getting the live crab into the pot! It was as foolproof as you can get. Next time I'll add more crushed red pepper to spice it up a bit, and I'll throw in some calamari too.

My entire family loves cioppino and this is the first time I've made it at home. It was a huge success!! Everyone loved it and asked that I make it again. The flavor is excellent, just a bit spicy, but not too much, and it was very easy to make. I used clams, shrimp, and mussels because that's what was available. Fantastic!!

I have been preparing this dish for 20 years and this recipe is the best yet. Thanks for sharing it.

I made this recipe using mussels, scallops, shrimp, tilapia, and snow crab. Everyone in my family raved about it, even my picky teenager. Thanks for the inspiration.

I found this recipe to be very good, I increased the red pepper flakes (my husband & I like just a little more spice) and the fresh parsley. Substituted the crabs with Lobster. He loved it!

This was a fabulous recipe. It was a really simple, yet flavorful broth, and brought out all the wonderful natural flavors of the shellfish. Next time, I would add a touch more garlic, and maybe some quartered tomatoes for more texture. I served this with plain toasted bread; next time, I would definitely use garlic bread. The cioppino is very simple in taste, and a striking accomaniment such as garlic bread would have really brought out tremendous flavor. I also recommend grating some fresh Locatelli cheese; I used this and it was delicious. Overall, a wonderful recipe capable of many things!

This is a good basic recipe with correct proportions, but it's uncreative compared to others on this very site. Check out the "Spicy Cioppino" recipe based on the Rose Pistola formulation; its idea of using chopped anchovies in the soup base is bang on as far as I'm concerned. Also, think about using some out-there spices, like a dash of cinnamon or allspice; that made a huge improvement in my hands. Finally: if you have a hand blender, puree the soup base in the pot before adding the fish (removing the bay leaf first, of course); this gives a much more restaurant-like feel to the dish.

I used shrimp, clams, squid, crab and white fish and added a little Tabasco, but this is the kind of recipe that will cater to your tastes. It's delicious. Perfect for a winter night. My husband raved about it.

A perfect Super Bowl, chilly Seattle day dinner. Added saffron and dry basil. Used fresh Dugeness crab ( we can buy it live in the international district for $3.99 lb). Life fresh clams, frozen tiger prawns, frozen sea scallops, frozen calimari, fresh red snapper. Cooked the crab and the clams separately from the cioppino broth, to be added later to prevent over cooking. Clam broth can be conbined with cioppina stew. Added snapper, then the calimari, prawns and scallops five minutes before serving--this house likes under cooked fish.

The best!! Followed the receipe exact. Guests enjoyed it as much as my husband & I did - and, my husband, normally doesn't eat half the seafood in the receipe.

Simple, fun recipe. Great for company when you want to keep it casual. I also played with ingredients, adding a few, subtracting others, and it was great. My honorary Italian Aunt Joanie would approve. Good, stout sourdough is a must with this one.

This recipe was good, when I made it a second time, I put in extra fish, more scallops, and the only thing I put in with a shell, was the crab. It makes a delicious sauce to go with any of your favorite seafood. Make sure there is plenty of bread to soak up the juice.

I thought this soup was delicious....although I didn't fully follow the recipe. I oven roasted my garlic ( about 5 cloves), and I used shallots instead onion, and I made some shrimp stock by reserving some shrimp shells and the head of the shrimp. I didn't use any crabs, just shrimp and scallops...it turned out great!

I looked at a lot of cioppino recipes before settling on this one, which I felt was quick and easy once I had assembled all the ingredients. For interest I added about a cup of fennel cut into matchsticks plus a tsp of basil, which appeared in all the other recipes I looked at.

I am both retired and a begining cook. I've made this twice and it was successful both times. Used shrimp, scollops, and catfish, but I added an extra garlic clove and some canned clam sauce. It was paticularly good according to my wife.

Definitely a keeper. I would add a little garlic and some more pepper flakes, but that's only because I like mine kicked up a little more. We only had shrimp, scallops, and fish. So, left out the crabs and clams. But, not a loss. Toss in whatever you have. It will work.

The best cioppino recipe I ever used was from the Berkeley Food Co-Op. The best cioppino I ever had was in North Beach. Since that was thirty years ago, memory may be in overdrive, but yours is a rather good recreation.

This is a wonderful Cioppino recipe. I've made it many times with excellent results each time, using a variety of seafood, depending on what's available. The menu needs nothing more than a salad and garlic bread. Leftovers are also great with pasta.

THIS WAS GOOD, BUT NEEDED ADDTL GARLIC AND FLAVOR. IT IS A GOOD RECIPE FOR COMPANY. SINCE CLAMS CAN BE SO EXPENSIVE WE USE EXTRA MUSSELS.

Out of this world! Crab wasn't available, so I just left it out and increased the other seafood. I also used much more red pepper flakes than specified--about 1 Tbsp--to make it super spicy.

Used Orange roughy for fish base, added basil and rosemary, used some red bell pepper with the green - There was nothing left for the next day - It was great!
