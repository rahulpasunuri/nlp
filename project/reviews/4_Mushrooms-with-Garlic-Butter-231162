It's clearly the escargot butter that's the star of this dish. This is one to make again and again, especially if your not a fan of snails. Problem is I'm a fan of both snails and mushrooms, and I love butter. I can see my life expectancy decreasing just thinking about making this again.

I'd call this a non recipe. I made it exactly as noted and while the mushrooms were good, they are nothing like escargot and the croutons were superfluous. One good note, I made mushroom soup the next day and I used the leftover mushrooms from this recipe in the soup recipe and it was yummers.

easy to make, but i found it a bit greasy, and not as tasty as I expected; mind you, it's still good and simple, but i was expecting rave quality (i.e., four forks) and it isn't, really ... it's just good.

Yummers! I made this when I first found the recipe years ago. It's been a hit since. then again, what's not to love???

Great mushroom dish. The croutons and parsley help add contrast for presentation and the croutons also soak up the butter garlic sauce and and needed texture.

Don't leave out the croutons! They are great for soaking up all of that wonderful, garlickly butter. Very tasty recipe

I rarely rate a recipe 4 forks but this one merits 4 forks. I also used the baby bellas and no croutons- mama mia! Served New Years with my Prime rib and was a hit and make it very often now. It does remind me of escargot which I love...

This was excellent an easy. My husband said it reminded him of escargot without knowing about the intro. I would do this for a party instead of marinated mushrooms or with them. Use all kinds of mushrooms and plenty of garlic. A keeper

Fabulous. Agreed with EM4BERN and didn't include the bread. Didn't have parsley, so tossed in a dash of dried marjoram. Folks loved them and wanted the recipe.

I hardly followed the recipe at all, because our oven was smoking terribly and I wanted to cut the carbs, so I made the garlic sauce as said, tossed it with the mushrooms, and just microwaved it on medium, stirring every two minutes, until my main course was done. It was a big hit.

UP UNTIL NOW, I'VE BEEN USING A MUSHROOM RECIPE COURTESY OF JACQUES PEPIN WHICH IS REALLY GOOD, BUT IT IS NOW OUT AND THIS ONE IS IN! SO SIMPLE AND SO DELISH. IT REALLY DOES REMIND ME OF ESCARGOT. I SKIPPED THE CROUTONS; SOUNDED WIERD AND DON'T NEED THE EXTRA CALS.

I honestly wasn't very impressed by this mix. I've found much better mushroom recipes before. I wouldn't make it again based on the fact that it was good, but not great.

Superb! Everyone loved this dish! We made it with baby portabellos and button mushrooms and it was delicious.

So easy and so good. I added freshly-grated Parmesan-Reggiano just before serving like another reviewer did and all the mushroom lovers at our family Thanksgiving celebration couldn't stop raving.

When I first made this recipe,I served this dish in individual rumekins. They were such a big hit, I'll need to double the recipe when I make the mushrooms again tonight! I've tried some variations, but the original recipe is perfect!

I just made this dish with portobello mushrooms and it was fantastic. I would suggest using a bit more parsley, but otherwise perfect.

Best mushroom recipe ever! So gourmet. I used whole wheat bread for the croutons. Delicious!
