Oddly bland. Looks like a good recipe, but came out in the "edible, but why bother" range. I'm sure there are better, spicier, more flavorful shrimp stir-fry recipes out there. Suggest you find one.

This recipe is amazing! I actually made it when the magazine released and have been looking for it ever since! Can't wait to make it again, the flavors were amazing! I'm going to try adding toasted coconut to the top of the dish next time...num

The whole family loved this recipe. I used jasmine rice instead of regular white it was fabulous though I think next round I'll add a bit more coconut to it. It wasn't quite as spicy as I expected, I couldnt find the exact chili pepper puree that it called for and maybe thats why it wasnt as spicy.I used asparagus and broccolini and actually I like the asparagus in it better than the broccolini. But with that being said it was very tasty and will definatly be making this again!

OMG, this was so good. We didn't have the Sriracha sauce so used Chinese chili sauce and only used 1 tbsp (because of the kids). We also used some brocolini, but made up the difference with regular brocoli. Everyone in the family loved this recipe. The kids even said that this could be served to a President! Will definitely be making this one again. It was quick, easy, elegant and exotique!

As someone who rarely cooks with Asian flavors in mind, this dish proved to be just what I needed to propel me to search out more Asian recipies. Really, really delicious and *incredibly* simple. I too cut the amount of shrimp in half but used 2 tbsp of the chili sauce as I like a healthy dose of heat. I subbed flour for cornstarch as I didn't have any on hand (just double the amount) and used broccoli. I was deeply impressed with how everyting turned out, I'll definitely make this again.

Just made this for dinner and really liked it. I was only cooking for the two of us so cut the amount of shrimp in half and used asparagus instead of broccolini. Left everything else exactly as called for in the recipe. Probably should have cut the sriracha sauce in half as well since it came out way too spicy with the reduced amount of shrimp.

This was an excellent dish...very easy and flavorful! I used reduced fat coconut milk and thought it was great (and obviously lower in fat!). I'm adding this to my go-to dishes!

I found this recipe after a shopping spree at the local Asian grocery. Loved this! So very easy and delicious. My husband is not a fan of broccoli so I used green and yellow squash and shitake mushrooms instead. It was nice and spicy. I will make this over and over again.

Instead of the Sriracha sauce, I used Sambal, an Indonesian Hot pepper condiment. I also did not have broccolini, so I used broccoli instead. It was easy, delicious, and looked very appetizing, but maybe that was due to the sambal substitution. We will definitely be makiing this again.

Quick, easy and a hit with my husband and oldest son (my younger ones do not like spicy food.) I must confess that I did make some changes - I added chopped fresh ginger and garlic, and substituted broccoli and Sambal for the Sriracha. (Sambal is an Indonesian version of red chili paste which I did have on hand, so I thought I could use it instead.) The dish looked pretty, brite colors green and red. I don't know why the other cook did not think it looked nice. Definitely a do again recipe for my family!

Great quick nutritious meal with ingredients that are staples in my household. I exchanged the Broccolini with Broccoli and used Potato Starch instead of Corn Starch because that's all I had. My husband gave it a 2 thumbs up and ask for me to make it again.

Simple, quick and tasty. We substituted eggplant (cubed, salted and drained) and cauliflower for the Broccolini, and it was great.

I generally read through the reviews before deciding whether to try a new recipe. As is generally the case, there were differing opinions expressed, making it a little tough to decide whether this one would be terrific and tasty or bland and boring. But there were enough positive comments to convince me to give it a try and so I will now add my voice to those who gave this thumbs (or a few forks) up. It was super easy and my husband declared it a keeper after the first bite. I wouldn't say that it rose to the level of dinner party fare where you hope to wow your guests, but it made a great Sunday dinner for the two of us.

Dead easy and very good! Needs more than 2.5 tb of Sriracha though, if you want it "spicy".

I loved this recipe and have shared it with many others. I thought the coconut taste needed a little more sweetness, so when I made the rice I added a little bit more sugar and it was great.

I offen try new recipes. This was a major flop. it is tasteless. I added twice as much Sriracha sauce and still boring. Also does not display well...it looks unappetizing .

I thought that this recipe was great. I left the sugar out for health reasons, and used Squash instead of Broccolini in the spirit of fall. All the flavors compliment each other very well. I would recommend trying these modifications!

I made the recipe as is and it was a little bland, although my boyfriend's daughter liked it a lot. It has good coconut flavor but I think a little more spice and a little more flavor would suit me. The only suggestion I can think of that would not change the flavor of this dish would be more salt and more Sriracha sauce. I don't know. The coconut rice was excellent and turned out perfect for me. I will keep this inspiring recipe and try things with it.

Boring. Just not enough flavor. I'm assuming this must be one of the recipies that people are heavily modifying, because as is it tastes bland.

Easy and yummy! I had Hunan sauce and I don't know how similar that is to the sauce called for, so I cut it back to a tablespoon and a half: that was plenty for a good, lip-burning kick! Also, the broccoli (and the broccolini was AWOL)at the market looked gross, so I got green beans.

My family and I love this recipe. It sounded so good I made it withing days of seeing it. Next week I made it using cut up chicken and green beans--this combo was just great. I'm waiting for my chinese long beans in the garden to make it again. I thought the spiciness was just right and I like it pretty spicy. I do think I'll try the suggestions of adding garlic and maybe some cilantro

Good but needs adjustment. I used the red chili sauce but it wasn't spicy/flavorful enough. Next time I would add garlic, a bit of red curry paste and some scallions at the end. The coconut rice was terrific... worth the extra calories.

Follow your own intuition about cooking the shrimp; cooking shrimp 3-4 minutes is way too long. The rice was very bad, too soggy even after cooking for 25-30 on low heat. I used a regular pan to cook the rice, so you should probably use a rice cooker if you have one.

This recipe was great and fast. I made several changes- I only used half the shrimp and added 1 lb of extra firm tofu. It added a nice variety and was cheaper. I used fish sauce instead of broth- great flavor. I also subbed 2 tsp of thai curry paste plus 1.5 tblsp of garlic chili paste for the Sriracha sauce because I couldn't find it. Tasted great. I also added a couple of handfuls of chopped scallions and arugula at the end after I turned off the heat so they just wilted. I used brown rice, which required extra attention so as not to stick to the bottom of the pan, but was very tasty- almost risotto like at by the end of cooking.

Reminds me of the spicy thai coconut sauces from thai restaurants (you can probably cut 1/2TB from the menu if you want to keep it less spicy, but I found it good). To make it more Thai tasting, I'd follow the suggestions of pangloss and even add a few thai basil leaves. It's definitely not a bad base to start experimenting from...

There are now excellent mail order sources for Thai cooking (including Amazon.com for many "gourmet" items).I added the following to make it more Thai-ish but you can add whatever you have in your "Thai pantry,"including: 1)fresh lemon grass, 2) Kafir lime leaves (fresh available via mail order; keep in plastic bag in freezer, )3)fish sauce (essential), 4)fresh hot pepper with seeds removed, 5)use one of the excellent red, green, yellow curries available in can: Mae Ploy brand the best. (These curries are nearly as good as your own home-made red, green, yellow curries, and shouldn't be excluded from your Thai ingredients shelf).

I thought this was a great recipe. So easy to make (except for the time spent on peeling shrimps) and so flavorful. I don't understand what people are complaining about. Of course, i did double the amount of chili sauce and also left shrimp heads on for added flavors.

I used chicken breast instead of the shrimp. It wasn't half as hot/spicy as I thought it would be.

I am rating this dish with 2 1/2 forks. I thought it was good - not great. My child couldn't eat it...to spicy for her. And I was hoping for more Thai flavor. I will make this again, maybe using less of the Thai hot sauce next time.

I made this last night for my husband's and my dinner halving the recipe except for the Sriracha sauce (OOPS!). It was a bit too spicy so I added a couple of spoons of creme fraiche which toned it down perfectly. YUM!

Rating: 4
Excellent flavor, with just the addition of a sliced garlic clove to the recipe. I used Trader Joe's jumbo shrimp, broccoli florets, and lite coconut milk. Also, lightly scoring the shrimp down the back to butterfly them allows more surface area for the sauce. Sriracha, once available only in Asian markets, is now readily available in most well-stocked supermarkets - in a 17-ounce squeeze bottle. Also used long-grain brown rice instead of white, although jasmine rice would also work nicely. Try garnishing the cooked rice with some lightly toasted unsweetened grated coconut.

I had the opportunity to dine recently at The Spice Market in NYC and had hoped this would approach the luscious Thai flavors I enjoyed there - not to be - this dish was disappointing...can't figure out what all the hype is about.

This was a fabulous easy dish. I cut the recipe in half except for the coconut milk/cornstarch/stock at the end. I had a hard time finding the Thai sauce, but based on previous comments, I was able to find a Thai chili sauce with garlic that worked great.

What I like most about this delicious dish is that it, unlike most Asian dishes, requires relatively few ingredients. The heat is perfectly balanced by the coconut milk - and it has tremendous flavor!

This was very nice and really easy. It was a hit in our house, and it will go into the recipe notebook. My only comment is that it could be a little saucier, so I may increase the sauce to recipe ratio in the future.

Sriracha from Thailand contains no preservatives or sufates; See Wikipedia.com for an excellent description of this type of sauce. But note that a popular sriracha sauce (Rooster brand) made in the US has sodium bisulfite added.

Rating: 0
Sriracha is a Thai sauce that is basically red chile and garlic sauce with some other added things, like a bit of sugar, and I think it has sulfites. I have successfully substituted Tabasco with Garlic for Sriracha sauce. It's also basically chiles and garlic without the added preservatives.

The Sokal Blosser winery in Oregon makes a fantastic wine meant just for spicy/ethnic dishes like this, it's called Evolution Number Nine (because it's made with 9 different kinds of white grapes. Look for it in a wine shop.

Broccoli Rabe and Broccolini are not one in the same. Broccolini is actually more like a long-stemmed broccoli (think small broccoli heads on stems the thickness of asparagus). Broccoli rabe is more of a green. To the cook who used broccoli rabe (also called rapini)-- I am sure that the recipe was still very delicious-- but for future reference there is a difference between the two. Broccoli is a more suitable substitute for broccolini.

I made this exactly as called for. Used broccoli-rabe-ini and assumed that was what the recipe meant. It was very good. The final sauce was spicy but not too hot. My son-in-law called me to say the left-overs that he took home were just as good if not better than the first day. He really loved it.

Great for a fast dinner. I also subbed broccoli. Broccolini is not always available at my grocery store. I had lite coconut milk and it worked fine despite what the recipe says.

Great recipe! Easy to make. I substituted frozen broccoli florets for the broccolini. Just steamed them (not completely), reduced the cooking time, and ta-da! The coconut rice really made a difference to the dish. Husband loved it. Yummy!
