Made this with chicken thighs for an easy weeknight meal. Served with scallion rice also from this site. The flavors were nothing new, but it made for a nice change of pace from the usual weeknight chicken dinner.

An absolutely splendid marinade for a whole chicken, bone in chicken thighs, or pork chops. Real maple syrup can be substituted for the brown sugar. Kick it up a notch with a tablespoon or two of chile-garlic sauce. Quick to make and consistently earns rave reviews at parties when grilled.

I too am not a beer fan and usually do not like any dish with a hint of hops. This however was unusually good.

I'm not a beer fan, but the combination of beer with soy sauce is interesting. I used 1/8 c dark and 1/8 c light soy sauce and mixed all the ingredients together and cooked right away, didn't marinate overnight and still the chicken was very flavorful and not salty at all.

This was excellent. I marinated it overnight and cooked it in a covered roasting pan until the last 30 minutes. I use either fresh cilantro or basil in the marinating stage. Also, substitute fresh lime instead of lemon-lime goes better with the asian flavors. The chicken was moist, flavorful and absolutely delicious. My family said it was one of the best chicken they've ever had and they're extremely picky!

I made this pretty much as directed, but at the low end of the marinating time range. It was good chicken, but the beer flavor was a little strong and didn't quite seem to mesh with the other flavors. If I made this again, I would replace the beer with 6 oz of Chinese stock and 6 oz of sake for a more authentic Asian flavor.

This was very good, but not as great as I had hoped. I prepared this for guests and they complimented me on it, but I felt that it was more out of courtesy than a genuine lip-smaking delight. I marinated the chicken for 5 hours, which I thought should be sufficient time. The sauce had a fabulous smell, and a good flavor, but it didn't turn out like the other reviews indicated - in fact, without the sauce the chicken was just.... well, chicken.

Super easy. Fantastic mid-week dinner.

OK -- I had to stop myself from devouring the whole chicken. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours. My changes: I used cut up chicken and occasionally basted; used only half the marinade (I only wanted the chicken); and I broiled the chicken during that last minute of cooking to yield a crispy skin (thanks to the cook from Akron for the tip).

Excellent! Chicken was very moist and flavorful, and sauce is delicious over rice. Even the children enjoyed it!

What a surprise! This was soooo goood. At the end of roasting the chicken I turned the broiler on for a minute to brown and crisp the skin. Then, when I made the reduction sauce I added a can of well drained straw mushrooms and some half and half. This was sooo easy to prepare, looked wonderful and tasted GREAT!

My first thought was that the combination of beer and soy sauce must taste BIZARRE, but I trusted the other reviews, and tried it anyway, and I'm certainly glad I did! I used chicken legs instead of a whole chicken, and marinated overnight. The flavors worked wonderfully together. The only problem I had was that I had no pan juices left after roasting to make a sauce with - I probably had it in the oven for a bit too long. But this recipe is definitely worth trying!

I left out the ginger and for those of you who don't like overpowering sause, boil the sause for 2-3 mins instead of 6, taste faboulous!

I was not thrilled with this. It did smell good while cooking and fairly easy preperation. I cut down on the soy as well, but the sauce was still overpowering.

This is a great recipe. The flavors are unique and a good change from regular baked chicken.

This was WONDERFUL!!!I also cut the soy sauce in half and left the sesame oil out completely.I dont think we lost anything.Even the kids at it all.

I hate to sound so kleshaish (not sure I spelled that right) But OH MY GOSH! Took advice from other reviewers and cut the soy by half, took the chicken out of the marinade about 10 min. before finished and let it brown so skin was nice and crispy. Also reduced the marinade by half and added just a touch of fat-free half & half. Served the chick with the sauce and wild rice. WOW! This one just kicks butt! For the person who was worried about using the marinade for a sauce...as long as you cook it to the proper temp..which you will if you boil it during reduction, don't worry, any bacteria will cook away! Can't imagine wasting any of this great marinde! Thanks again to all you great cooks who went before me for your fabulous suggestions. You guys are great at-home-chefs@

I agree with the cook from Ottawa. The reduction doesn't produce a sauce worth its fat. The bird, however, was very nice and juicy.

Rating: 2
I am always leary of reducing a marinade (especially one that had a chicken sitting in it for 24hours!) to use as a table sauce. This recipe does create a very attractive, succulent bird, but the reduction is too overwhelming and like I mentioned, a somewhat dubious health practice. I would try again, making some marinade separately to use for the sauce, add some chicken stock to dilute, then thicken before serving.

Rating: 3
The recipe was easy to follow and the chicken smelled and tasted great. I would probably try to get a larger bird as we all prefer the white meat. I made a stock out of the remains which turned out terrific.

Execllent recipe. Instead of doing the chicken in the oven I used the grill. Add a little hickoy chips, not much, basted it every 10 minuites...Yumbo...!!!

This is a wonderful change of pace for roasting a whole chicken. The flavors are perfect together and they penetrate every part of the bird. I've already given this recipe out to several friends and they love it! I can't wait to prepare it again.

This recipe had great flavors, and the chickent was very tender and flavorful. A hit, and has already had an encore, as is.

Very very tasty! I just started cooking stuff other than oatmeal & scrambled eggs (I'm in college), and this recipe was easy to make and didn't take long (other than marinade time). Used Braggs liquid amino acids (from health food store) in place of soy sauce, as well as some homebrew pilsner (only used 1/4-1/3 cup amino acids, but replaced liquid shortage with a little extra beer) and it turned out perfect! Is definitely on my "impress a guy that you can cook well" list.

This is a great recipe! I made exactly as written and had no problem getting the skin crispy and golden [make sure to turn the bird over if using whole chicken]. Also, make sure to use a full bodied beer [all I had on hand was Pete's Wicked Ale and it worked fine]. I travel to Hong Kong and China frequently [over 50 times], and this is the first recipe I have found in the West that properly captures the subtlety and complexity of flavour that is the key to Chinese roasted meats. What a pleasant surprise. Do yourself a favor and try it, I couldn't have been more pleased. Serve with a very delicate long grain white rice such as texmati, basmati or jasmine and a quickly stir-fried chok choi with a little oil, oyster sauce and water.

I made this for 12 people using large chicken thighs still with the skins on which were marinated for about 14 hours. Extremely easy to make as you do the marinade one night then just put it in the oven the next. Skin came up crispy and sauce was delicious, if a little salty. Next time, I will reduce the soy sauce.

Just ate this with my 2 and 6 year old - OH YEAH! We used cut up pieces and reduced the sauce as the chicken roasted, otherwise there is too much sauce in the roasting pan. We served with broccoli and chinese rice, it was like being back in NY at my favorite Chinese restaurant!

My husband and kids raved over this chicken dish. It was very moist and we had no leftovers! I will make this again. The only drawback is the time needed to marinade, however, it is definitely worth the effort.

Rating: 1
Didn't like this one. The marinade was extremely salty b/c of the large amount of soy sauce. The flavor wasn't worth the time it took to chop the garlic and ginger...try Oriental Chicken...soooooo much better!

We used chicken breasts and thighs, the same pounding as a whole chicken. Marinated overnight, used half and half as suggested in the sauce. Had left overs and chopped up the chicken in very small pieces added it to Schilling Alfredo Pasta Sauce blend using 1/2 half cup Milk and 1/2 cup half and half. Poured over Lingunie Noodles. Supurb!!

Since we discovered this recipe, we've made this dish weekly, in double batches because everyone loves it so much. We use chicken parts as we're a dark meat family, but even the white pieces come out juicy and flavorful. We didn't even realize we needed to reduce the sauce the first few times and we STILL loved it--kids, very picky dad, mom--the dog goes crazy just smelling it!!!

Had this just this evening, the dinner went over with a bang. My guests raved about it and were actually fighting over the carcass to see who would be the lucky one to "pick it clean" When the bird was done, I disjoined (carved) the bird into four parts and reconstructed it on the platter to the original configuration atop a bed of steamed brown rice, covering the lot with the reduction. I then configured each plate as I did the serving platter. Everyone raved when done and it made a very attractive presentation at the table. This one is a keeper!

Really enjoyed this chicken dish. I also used boneless skinless breasts, browning them a bit under the broiler at the end. I had lots of the sauce left over, but it was really good generously ladled over the chicken. The marinade was very tasty and the chicken came out tender and moist. I will definitely be making this again. I used Blue Ridge Porter for the beer, and next time I'll try something different.

This is without a doubt the best roasted chicken recipe I have ever made. I followed the recipe to the letter on this one but marinated in the bag for a whole day. I used SouthPaw beer which has a very earthy flavor and I think that is what made it so good. My husband and I ate the whole chicken in one sitting. We have quite a bit of reduced sauce left over that we are going to marinate steaks in for the weekend. Next time a make it I will try adding half and half or cream to the sauce as a previous reviewer suggests. Served with simple rice and steamed Chinese style green beans, it was scrumptious.

Excellent recipe, but I made a few changes. First, I used split breasts, scoring them each three times about 1/2" deep. I marinated them for almost 24 hours in a 13x9" pan so they were nearly immersed. I baked them at 350 in the marinade -- skin side down -- to retain moisture until they were cooked through (40 or 45 minutes), then removed them from the pan and broiled them just enough to brown and lightly crisp the skin. I put about 2 cups of the marinade and juices in a sauce pan, added 1/2 cup half-and-half, and 1 tbsp. cornstarch mixed with water, then cooked until velvety. I strained the sauce, poured some on a serving plate, arranged the breasts on top, then used some of the scallions and ginger I had strained out as a garnish on the breasts. The half-and-half not only improved the texture of the sauce, but also the flavor. (As originally written, the reduced sauce was overwhelmingly strong.) Served with the extra sauce, couscous, snap peas, and rolls, this dish got nothing but raves from all my guests. One thing: I advise using *good* beer for this recipe, as it makes a difference.

Instead of using a whole chicken, we used skinless chicken parts and simply baked it in the oven. The chicken was tender and the flavour was appreciated by the kids. Serve with cooked grain (we like quinoa) and pour extra cooked marinade over the grain. This is a keeper!

I've had great luck with this recipe several times using chicken pieces rather than a whole chicken -- I think the marinade absorbs better, and skin (if you keep it on) is crispier (especially if you baste frequently). Also like it using chopped crystallized ginger instead of fresh.

Rating: 3
Tasty, but the chicken didn't get the crispy skin I hoped it would. I would also have liked the sauce to be thicker. I'll definitely make this one again, but perhaps with some fiddling with the ingredients . . . lime juice instead of lemon maybe.

So-so. Not much zing. Chicken didn't get golden roasted because of cooking in the marinade. I won't make this again.

Delicious! I added sliced mushrooms and about 1 tsp. of Chinese chili paste during the reduction phase (last six minutes of cooking) and it was great! Had a little more kick with the chili paste, but it was great without it as well.

This one's a keeper. Delicous and very simple. So simple, in fact, that it occurred to me while I was making it that when my son (he is 15; I am thinking ahead) is out in the world and a novice cook, this is one of the recipes I would give him. A recipe that reqires both beer and a ziploc bag would be perfect for a post-adolecsent guy, right?

This was a quick and easy one to put together. I did not have awhole chicken on hand so i used split breasts and to cut down on the fat removed the skin. my whole family enjoyed it along with white rice and asparagas.

My children ( 7, 5 and 3) loved the chicken, and so did my husband. Extremely tender and flavorful!! I strained the sauce before serving.
