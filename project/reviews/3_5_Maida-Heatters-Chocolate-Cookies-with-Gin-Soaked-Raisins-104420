really wasn't a huge fan of these. They are ok, but not as rich as I'd like a cookie to be. Also, a few ESSENTIAL tips: 1. Unless you want gigantic cookies, there is no need to make them this big. A rounded tbsp is what I used, and they were still large. 2. Absolutely do not follow the instructions for prepping the pan. The cookies stick and break and are a nightmare to remove. Much better is to use parchment paper--they peel right off.

These are fantastic! Used less batter per cookie. Baked about 13-14 minutes. YUM!

The only cookie that stays in the rotation every Christmas. Light and intense. Schaffenberger cocoa. Soak the raisins for at least a week then drain in a strainer set over a bowl for 15-20 minutes so they aren't too wet. Heaping tablespoon of dough per cookie and they will spread. I always make a kid version w the raisins soaked in apple juice too. Also adapts well to a gluten-free version by subbing fine rice flour for the standard flour.

I make these every Christmas. Every year I acquire a new fan. Definitely a winner. Never use a quarter cup per cookie. A heaping tablespoon - ping pong ball size. Yummmmmy.

These are dangerously yummy - crisp outside, chewy inside. 1/4 cup dough per cookie is MUCH too large. I made 25 out of one batch and they are still a bit too big. Lots of breakage in removing from the pan, too - more taste testing! I used regular espresso as it seems that instant is no longer available in Canada, Montreal at least.

A new favorite. Easy to make and wonderful taste and texture. I made these slightly smaller, one generous tablespoon vs 1/4 cup, than Maida recommended. I prefer a slightly smaller cookie.

use Droste cocoa, good quality gin, and Mexican vanilla (a little 'spicier'). It was the FAVORITE cookie of the five types I made for Thanksgiving. I plan on making them for Christmas gifts.

Light, chewy, dense -- these cookies are amazing.

I decided to try these to put in the company Holiday Baskets. We have a lot of european customers and I wanted them to get something different and home-made. After reading the mixed reviews, I decided not to spend any extra $ & to make them with what I already had: instead of Gin, I soaked my raisins in Vodka. Instead of Dutch Process Cocoa, I used the Ghirardelli Cocoa I already had. Didn't have any espresso-so I used the Turkish coffee I had in the cupboard. They turned out great! One of the guys I work with asked for the recipie for his wife's cookie club. Texture was good, flavor was excellent and they didn't run. I did roast the pecans first & used 10X confectioner's sugar.......

Easy and sophisticated. I used my 1/2 T. measure, and baked them for 11 minutes. I let them cool 2 minutes before prying them up. I tried parchment and Sil-pat; parchment worked much better, because you can just peel the cookies off. I used my mini-prep to chop the nuts, and about half were less than coarse, which I think helped the cookies hold together. It helps to know that these don't spread much.

I thought this recipe sounded nice for Christmas, but after following it to the letter (and soaking the raisins for five days), I think people should know the following: these cookies aren't very sweet, so as someone already commented, children won't like them, neither will many adults IMO; a quarter cup dough per cookie is too much; they really spread a lot so don't skimp on the space between; the best cocoa you can buy is a must, I think, since this recipe needs all the flavour help it can get. In general, though the texture of these is interesting (chewy, meringue-like lightness), the pecans just add crunch and little flavour (maybe from being overwhelmed by the chocolate), and the gin-soaked raisins just sounded like a good idea, they weren't all that.

Use a wet spatula to remove cookies. Run it under the faucet. It helps to get those sticky cookies off the paper or cookie sheet. Overall, a hit & miss experience. Some cookies had holes in them as the wet raisins dropped from the meringue-like dough during baking. Spraying baking sheets with Pam wasn't perfect, still hard to remove cookies --- however, using shortening & flour (like Maida Heatter recommends)worked perfectly on the cookie sheets. I used lard (leftover from baking biscochitos) and flour on the cookie sheets, washing them and re-greasing & re-flouring the cookie sheets each time. A lot of bother for a truly Adult Cookie with a lot of great taste. It makes a great gift cookie for someone with no children in the household.

I agree wholeheartedly with "moose64": These are sublime. Mine didn't spread any more than any other cookies. Tasted like concentrated, dense, very decadent brownies.

I'm not sure what the last reviewer meant. I thought these were excellent, just finished making them. I used Vodka instead of Gin and they didn't spread at all, the taste is excellent, very chocolaty and the raisins are very tasty!

I can't believe these made epicurious' Chriastmas cookie "short list." When made as large as directe4d, they spread out drastically and made a stuck-together mess. Ifound the flavor totally unappealing.

By far the most sophisticated cookied I've ever made or eaten. I brought them as my offering at a Christmas cookie party. I didn't have enough pecans, so mixed what i had with chopped hazelnuts(actually - i used mostly hazelnuts...) and they were THE hit of the night. I was asked for the recipe upwards of 5 times that night. They are sweet, so keep them small (no larger than an American quarter)and you will be thrilled with the results.

This is a really really really great cookie. Because it's base is mostly confectioner's sugar and egg white, it has a chocolate macaroon quality to it. The pecans and gin soaked raisins are killer additions. I didn't make these as large as the recipe suggested. I did heaping teaspoons on 2 cookie sheets and got about 30 cookies. The next day, they are crunchy chewy and really, really delicious.

These cookies are terrific. Like other reviewers, I soaked the raisins for a week, made them smaller, and used parchment paper to line the pan. They came off with no trouble. I also used regular cocoa since Dutch-process was not available and instant coffee instead of instant espresso powder. Absolutely delicious.

These were very good with a nice crunchy exterior and a chewy moist inside. I made them smaller, using a heaping teaspoonful and baked them for about 11 minutes. I always line my cookie sheets with aluminum foil. I sprayed the foil with pam and had no trouble removing them. Although the pecans were delicious, next time I may try using coconut instead just to experiment a little.

These cookies worked out just like they were supposed to: beautiful crackle top, gooey and crunchy at the same time. They are fragile, so do make them small and remove them from the baking sheet as soon as they've cooled enough to hold their shape when moved. However, I must agree with the previous cook about their taste: they are just *way* too sweet for me. But what did I expect from a recipe that basically uses icing sugar where other cookies use flour? The raisins were good, though.

I love these cookies. This is my favourite cookie recipe. The raisins soaked in gin are wonderful. I soak them for about a week. I make the cookies small (2-3inches in diameter) because they are very rich and break easily if they are much larger. Be careful not to overbake them.

The texture of these cookies were great. However, they were sickeningly sweet. I would use a little less confectioner's sugar next time, although I am not sure if less sugar would compromise the texture of the cookies. Like the previous reviewer, I sprayed parchment paper with Pam and I had no problem getting the cookies off the paper.

These were delicious- shiny crisp on the outside and soft intensely chocolate on the inside. Might be even better if the rasins were soaked in rum instead of gin. I had no problem with them sticking to the pan- I used Baker's Joy and they slid right off unassisted. I baked them using heaping teaspoonfuls- it made about 50 cookies.

Maybe I would make these again... They tasted delicious but spread all over the place. They really weren't presentable. But they tasted like the perfect brownie: a light crisp shell with a rich moist inside. I soaked my raisins in Grand Marinier for a week or so, and added some grated orange zest to the dough -- I'll definitely try to incorporate these raisins into another cookie recipe.

These were wonderful cookies, everyone who tried them loved them. I soaked the raisins for nearly two weeks (I actually forgot about them) The texture was great, chewy and nice chocolade flavor.

These looked beautiful. BUT I didn't care for the taste nor did my family. They were not bad however we just didn't care for them.

I'm pretty sure I screwed something up here. The dough was very dry, so I added some of the gin from the raisins. I must have added too much because the cookies didn't form well and spread on the sheet during baking (the extra gin did add a nice flavor, though). Even though they looked unsightly, they were delicious. I give this 4 forks because I'm pretty sure I made a mistake and they were still delicious.

Superb! Chewy and chocolatey and not too sweet. If only Christmas fruitcake tasted like this. These were the most popular of the holiday cookies I made.

I was hoping to taste more of the gin in the raisins. I made as directed with buttered and floured baking sheets and had no problem at all getting them off. Pretty good. I'd make again. They taste better the next day.

I made 5 types of cookies for a dinner party last night and these were the hands down winners. I am going to make them again before Christmas!

This cookies are beyond devine, but use plenty of butter and flour on the pan as they are sticky sticky sticky...they even stick to silpat. These will become a standard in my repetoire.

The "dough" was actually very syrupy. I think I had large egg yolks, and perhaps it was too humid a day. I think more flour might have solved the problem. Also, getting them off the parchment was a challenge! The best solution seemed to spray the parchment heavily, then let the cookies cool completely, before carefully peeling away underneath each cookie. A wonderful flavor, though! I'll make them again, with another tablespoon or so of flour.

these are among the best cookies I have ever made, and, without egg yolks or butter, surprisingly safe to eat. You can also hold onto any leftover gin-soaked raisins and keep snacking on them...

A big hit at our Christmas egg nog party. I also made some w plain raisins that were delicious. 1/4 cup was much too big, but tablespoons worked well.

This was well received by family & friends over the holidays. I let the raisins soak a week and made them with heaping soup spoons to stretch it. A winner.

Super yummy. Like the best parts of a brownie--the chewiness, the crackly top, the gooey middle. But I agree that 1/4 cup for each cookie was way too much--I actually only got 9 cookies out of it. Will definitely make this recipe again!
