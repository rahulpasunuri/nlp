I changed it up a bit because I have fresh veggies now. I used a pound of fresh tomatoes quartered and put it in the food processor with the balsamic, olive oil and brown sugar no capers, but a bit of salt and pepper and put in the BBQ. Great summer meal, family loved it.

Made for a quick dinner, only had one chicken breast so I ate the eggplant slice w/ sauce only. Still tasty!

I've been regularly making this recipe exactly as instructed since receiving the book in 2001 or so. The absolute perfect recipe for fussy eaters since the eggplant and even tomato can be picked off (am I the only person with these people in my family?). A little bit of effort put into presentation and it can look quite elegant. Yes, it is a tad sweet, however, I find balancing with a good bitter green salad makes it a winner. Throw in potato mash and my

Not a knock-your-socks off dish but perfect for a quick healthy weeknight dinner. My 14-year-old daughter loved it. I added kalamata olives before I cooked it and added a dash of feta at the end. Next time I'll use a little less sugar as well as it leaned toward the sweet side. I served it with saute arugula/spinach and roasted potatoes.

I'm confused by all the great reviews - I made this as written and we found it inedible. The combination of balsamic and capers was especially bad somehow. The eggplant, even after an extra 20 minutes of cooking, was flavorless and cardboard-like. Disappointed.

This is our favorite quick dinner - easy to assemble for those nights you don't really want to cook. We double the sauce and bake it another 5-10 min. using boneless chicken thighs. Awesome!

Fabulous! Although, I did grill (indoors) the main ingredients first, the combination of canned diced tomatoes, brown sugar, balsamic vinegar and capers was SUPERB. Okay, not for company, but easy and delicious.

This was good. I used leftover cooked chicken, so i just added it at the end with some parmesan cheese. I made a little more sauce than the recipe called for and served the dish over pasta with the extra sauce. It would also have been good with the arugula as a warm vinaigrette. Hubby liked it and he typically does not care for eggplant. Might not serve it for company, but it was a perfect weeknight meal.

Great idea, but the balsamic and blue cheese overpower the chicken. My guests said they liked it, but I know it could have been better had I used a milder blue cheese and less vinegar. I completely agree with the Pinot Noir match up vs. a white wine. Arugula or spinach salad makes this complete.

I got this recipe years ago from the book. I use zucchini instead of eggplant, slice one in thirds. I also add some garlic and chili flakes to the vinegar. I've also added dried basil to the vinegar if I don't have any fresh basil around. It's a wonderful weight watchers recipe. If I'm in the mood to rich it up, I add some goat cheese to the top.

This is not my absolute favorite chicken recipe ever, but it was quite good. It made me wish there was a 2.5 forks option. I'm not a huge fan of eggplant and it seemed unnecessary anyway, so I just ommitted it. I used stewed tomatoes because it's what I had on hand and I think it made the dish better. I'll make it again, but next time I'll double the fresh basil and put it in with the chicken while cooking. It was my favorite part, and blended beautifully with the other flavors.

All around a very nice and different way to prepare chicken breasts - good for an average weeknight... IF you happen to have eggplant on hand. I grow some in my garden in the summer, but otherwise it is not something one would have unless going out of one's way. Having said that, I did go out of my way on this cold January day in CT, and was pleasantly surprised with this dish. Nice flavors (don't rinse the capers, otherwise make sure to season eggplant and chicken with plenty of s&p), we really liked it.

Delicious. I used whole boneless chicken breasts, cooked it at 350 for 45 minutes, and added sliced provolone on top for the last 5 minutes.

This recipe is easy and has lots of flavour. I didn't use the capers...don't like them. And I used a can of chopped tomatoes instead of whole and cutting them. Would definitely make again.

Easy and delicious. I food processed all the ingredients except for the tomatoes (to hide the capers...my partner doesn't like them!), and threw in a garlic clove & a little red wine. I spread some of the sauce on the eggplant before topping with chicken. Also, I used some butterflied chicken breasts, so I put some S & P & some sauce inside them before putting the rest of the sauce on top.

Very bold in flavor. In addition to some of the modifications below I also pounded the chicken breasts flat. I didn't have enough time to marinate the chicken, so flattening the chicken increased the surface area for the sauce to cover. Next time I will also peel the eggplant. Very good!

Full of wonderful flavors and very easy to put together for a weeknight meal. I added peppers and onions on top of the eggplant and it was amazing. I used diced fire roasted tomatoes for an extra layer of flavor. Even my picky 9 year old daughter loved the sauce!

After reading all the reviews, I made the following modifications which made this recipe one I'll make again (which is rare for me - I'm a trier!): double the sauce, I made only two breasts, but all the sauce; add the sauteed peppers and onions first under the chicken, just lovely; don't skip the sugar! might try sorgum, maple syrup, or molasses in the future.

This is a great recipe as is - no changes. I've made it about 4-5 times now and everyone has loved it. It's very simple and has great flavors. Took the suggestion for a rocket salad side and paired it with the Warm Arugula Salad With Garlic Croutons (Bon Appetit, 2/01) - fantastic!

This was quick, but I think the thick slices of eggplant are a mistake. Either slice the eggplant thin or nix it altogether in favor of veggies like peppers and onions. Also, there could've been a lot more tomatoes; I would use two cans. Altogether the dish was not bad, but definitely not great.

This was so good and easy to boot! I had some grape tomatoes & fresh fennel I wanted to use up. I cut the tomatoes in 1/2 & the fennel in about 1/4" slices. I also diced the eggplant. Marinated the chicken in the sauce for several hours. Cooked the vegies for 20 minutes by them selves (with evoo, s & p)& then placed the breasts on top with the marinade/sauce. My fillets were on the small side & 25 minutes was too long. A tad dried out. But the flavor was great!

I took the advice to saute onions and red bell peppers to put on the eggplant slices. I also added some dried basil and herbes de Provence to the tomato muxture (I used drained diced tomatoes). It was a hit. A left over breast even tasted great with some rice the next day.

Surprisingly good dish! I sauteed yellow onions and red bell peppers with some garlic and olive oil, then put that mix on top of the eggplant, then the chicken on top of that, also, I tented the pan with foil just so it wouldn't dry out. Will definitely make again.

I made this without the eggplant as I had a different vegetable side. Besides the fact that I had to drain excess liquid from the roasting pan mid-way through cooking, the chicken came out great. It was very popular with my guests and family. An easy recipe that tastes delicious!

Yummy! Marinating the chicken a few hours beforehand makes it really juicy.

I have made this several times as I have Donna Hay cookbooks. The first time, I adapted it using yellow squash instead of eggplant, and olives instead of capers. I also am generous with the balsamic and I add basil before I put it in the oven. A great weeknight dish and one you can make without having to go to the market.

This took longer then anticipated to cook, about 45 min. the eggplant was not cooked in 20-25 min. however I loved the taste of the balsamic and the tomato. Very good. I would make this again.

Loved what this recipe did for the chicken, but I could have passed on the eggplant that came with it. I might make it again and do a seperate veggie dish as a side.

Excellent dish. I marinated the chicken for about 6 hours prior to baking. It was delicious!

It was a good recipe and would enjoy making/eating it again. Next time I would probably let the chicken marinate for a bit before baking.

A second from the states - can't believe that a tester didn't understand "chicken breast fillet" means "boneless skinless chicken breast."

I find it hard to understand how the tester was confused by a chicken breast fillet.. a fillet has no bone- is it that complicated?? This recipes if fantastic, light and simple, like all of Donna Hay's recipes! I'll make it again and again...
