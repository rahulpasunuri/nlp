Definitely a keeper recipe from this reviewer too - I have already made two batches (and yes, it is worth the investment) and will give these jars out for Christmas gifts this year. I love that another reviewer did not peel their nectarines as this is the most obnoxious part of the recipe. I might have to try just using one box of pectin, as the leftover and added cost is a small deterrent. Overall, an amazing recipe.

Wow! This is a keeper. We used nectarines from our tree, followed the instructions exactly except we didn't peel the fruit, the skin was fine and we think added some extra beautiful color. I used the entire box of low sugar pectin, 1.75 oz, and it worked out fine. A keeper, we'll making this all summer!

Have already made this twice. Perfect accompaniment for a cheese course at the end of the meal.

I used peaches instead of nectarines, but it turned out ok; instead of 7-8 jars, I had 5. It's still good, just didn't have as much as I expected. Also couldn't find "lower sugar" pectin, so used the kind that's ok for use with or without sugar, but followed the rcipe otherwise.
