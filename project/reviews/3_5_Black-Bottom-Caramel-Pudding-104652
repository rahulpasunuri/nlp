This was so yummy! The caramel pudding was fantastic! I put it in my crystal wine glasses. It was very pretty but a bit roomy. I'll use regular white wine glasses next time...very good and relatively easy.

I have been making this pudding for years and reviewed it about 7 years ago...I still love it as much as i did the 1st time i made it. Practice makes perfect with the caramel; I have made it so many times that at this point i can do it with my eyes closed. It is very rich as a previous reviewer pointed out, but SOOOOO worth it.

This is a good recipe. I didn;t have a problem with getting the caramel dark enough, which I usually do. I did find it to be a bit on the sweet side, though, hence, only 2 forks.

I have made this pudding now 3 times, and it's been delicious each time. My husband usually complains about calories when I make any dessert; this one, he just lick the bowl and keep quiet.

This was very good! After I'd eatten about two bites I was going to ask my husband what he thought, but I didn't have to since he was almost finished already. He actually licked the bowl! I bought special footed glasses just for this dessert. It was very attractive. I did add about a cup and a half of the carmel pudding to the chopped chocolate because it seemed to me it might be a typo to only add a 1/2 cup - you would barely have any chocolate in each cup. I will definitely make this again!

A delicious and elegant pudding. (It looks best in pudding goblets similar to the one in the photo -- short, rounded, squat cups don't do the pudding justice.) I agree with the cook from Viersen that the caramel layer can be tricky; it's a good idea to resist pulling it from the heat too quickly. Increasing the chocolate layer worked for me, too. Simply divine.

An excellent desert - it quickly went to the top of my favorites list. It is also a "go-to" recipe when we have dinner parties given its relative ease and high flash factor. Before I made this, I thought all pudding came out of a box.

This is a truly irresistable desert; too bad I can't make it every weekend, due to its seemingly high calories. (I wish the Epicurioans would unveil for us the caloric content of recipes, but I understand it's against the philosophy!) The only problem here seems to lie in getting the caramel right. Because the recipe warns you not to get it burned, you tend to stay on the safe side and end up with a vanilla cream at the top. Next time I'll make it as dark as it gets. I used brown sugar which worked out perfectly fine, except that since it is dark-colored from the start, it's even harder to tell the consistency of caramel. My other alteration was to add, instead of the mere half-cup suggested in the recipe, half of the caramel pudding to the chocolate and increase the chocolate amount accordingly - this is especially important if your caramel has turned out pale :-). I would be interested to know if it's possible to substitute part, or all of the cream with milk. Has anyone tried?

This was a big hit at a small gathering a few months ago. Now it is requested!! Delicious! Caramel is rich and buttery. REAL PUDDING!! YUMMY!!!

Easy to make, but the result seems flat. The chocolate pudding is rich and my family liked it a lot but the caramel part is just too subtle, even though I caramelized the sugar to a deep brown as the recipe suggested.

Pudding did not thicken for me. This is the first time I have made something like this before. I may have needed more hand-holding with the recipe. Perhaps the recipe should have required wisking over heat until thickened? The taste was good, but it all ended up going down the drain--and the night before a party too.
