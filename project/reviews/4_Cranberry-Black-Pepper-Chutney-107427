I make it every thanksgiving. it is very easy and tastes fantastic. I usually serve it with seared foie gras. I do think the chutney needs way more sugar than the recipe states. I find it too tart. It is also too peppery to give to the kids but they will come to appreciate it one day as all the adults do!

Very, very nice. I made it six times. Regular salted butter softens the sweetness.

Why would you ever make regular cranberry sauce again when you know that this recipe is out there? Its so very tasty.

Very nice. I used this as a topping on some halibut. My husband was leery, but tried it together the last few bites and liked it. Or maybe he was humoring me? It has a great flavor, nevertheless.

Fabulous chutney. Not only is it pretty (red and jeweled) it has the perfect combination of tart and sweet. It easily goes well with chicken.

This chutney was not overly sweet or vinegary, it just had a nice complex flavour that was very complementary to the roast turkey I made. Much better than classic cranberry sauce.

A wonderfully tasty, easy to prepare recipe. Fantastic with duck confit, would also complement other game meats, or would be a perfect, upscale cranberry sauce substitute with roast turkey.

Excellent and easy. The extra hint of pepper adds a nice, subtle spiciness. I usually keep the cider vinegar in cranberry sauces to a minimum. Too bad no one else seems interested in this recipe. Definitely a keeper - one of the best I've made and tried from this site.
