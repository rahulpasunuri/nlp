This is really tasty! Nothing crazy out of the ordinary, but well-balanced, delicious, asian-flavoured marinated beef. Yum.

I have made this recipe for the past 2 summers. Everyone loves them. The scallions are not necessary. The beef is tender and delicious. Give it a try.

Not all that interesting. Very basic. It lacks something. Maybe some cilantro and something spicy would give it an extra kick, but other than that I'm looking for a better recipe.

This marinade was terrific with venison. We included veggies (pearl onions, red and yellow sweet peppers, crimini muchrooms), pineapple and unmarinated shrimp in a do-it-yourself kebab smorgasbord with friends. The marinade received many raves.

This was very good but keep in mind it is basically beef teriyaki. It is very good for teriyaki but if you are looking for more in a kebab it is lacking. I think it would have been better with chicken but that is probably because I prefer chicken teriyaki. I also used additional veggies.

Like many other reviewers, I added more veggies to my skewers (assorted peppers, onion, mushrooms, grape tomatoes). Served with grilled new potatoes (par-boiled first) and waldorf coleslaw (also from this site). A good recipe.

I substituted scallions for some veggies (onion, mushroom and red pepper and it came out great) definetely would do again. We served a big house red (Ca' del Solo table wine) with the meal wich went well.

Easy and delicious! Perfect for summertime grilling. I've made these quite a few times and everyone loves them!

Made this for our annual whitewater rafting/camping trip and got rave reviews. It's really easy to make. I skewered the beef ahead and then marinated the skewers.

The marinade = YUM. This recipe is superb, I didn't have to change a thing. The presentation is also attractive....I made these for a kebab party---along with "Chicken Tikka" kebabs and "Prosciutto-wrapped shrimp with garlic dipping sauce"(all recipes from this site). What a hit!

First time out, I made this for a group of 12 - and it was a great success with basil and pine nut pilaf. I've made it since for the family - always very tasty. Like others, I marinate the meat for 3 to 4 hours. Once some meat was left in the marinade overnight and the ginger overpowered the taste when grilled.

This recipe was selected from five others for a very large dinner party. Used hot sesame oil instead of toasted oil (gives it a little kick) and regular chopped garlic straight from the jar. 8 skewers were prepared with stew meat, pork, lamb and vegetables and marinated for 12 hours. Once cooked, you could barely tell the difference in meats. Along with a nice syrah, this dish will be served at a large dinner party to be held in July.

I marinated the beef for approx 4 hrs with excellent results. Very flavorful. I took another reviewer's suggestion and boiled the remaining marinade a an additional sauce. I am thinking of having a kebab party and this one's on the list.

I hardly ever give a recipe four forks but these are delicious. They turned out great, I would make no changes. This marinade would be awesome with flank steak too!

I added mushrooms, cherry tomatoes & pineapple to the kebabs and served same with rice pilaf. I also marinated the beef for 4 hrs. Turned out great! The marinade is one of the best beef marinades out there -- even without the toasted sesame oil! (I am not a fan of sesame oil. So, I left it out altogether.)

Absolutely perfect marinade!!!! Great for the beef but also a perfect complement to the veggies I kebabbed and brushed as well - mushrooms, scallions, orange and green pepper, zuchinni - YUM. I was counting on leftovers for lunch the next day but everyone ate them up. Thanks alot epicurious.

This was very good. We loved the marinade so much we boiled it for several minutes and served it with rice.

I've made this recipe a number of times and it comes out wonderful each time whether I marinate it for 1/2 or 4 hours. I've used both tri-tip and NY steak -- both were great. This recipe becomes a simple and nice dinner with some white rice. I highly recommend it!

These kebabs were a hit. I marinated them for more than 4 hours, added several other vegetables (green/yellow squash & peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, etc.)and they were a hit. Suggest using a good cut of meat (top round or the like). Originally I thought it might have a bit more pepper than needed but it turned excellent. Great party appetizer! Highly recommend. Would make again, no doubt.

We east kebabs often and this is a nice change of pace. We added more veggies to the kebabs for color and taste including halved tomatoes, green, yellow and red peppers, whole mushrooms, etc. Made this for ten people. Everybody loved it.

These beef kebabs are delicious and easy. I especially recommend using a nice cut of beef like beef tenderloin for this recipe. Perfect for the barbeque season!
