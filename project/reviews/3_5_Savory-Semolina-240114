This dish is called Upma in India and is a regular breakfast dish. Yes, the semolina absolutely must be roasted to a light brown before adding all the ingredients. In the oil, after the mustard seeds, a pinch of asafoetida and a pinch of turmeric are also traditionally added before the curry leaves. The garlic is rarely used and the proportions of water are 1 cup semolina, 11/2 cups of water.

This is indeed a superb and filling, yet light lunch. However, I find it that a better flavour is released if the farina (soji) is roasted in about 2 tbsp ghee till it smells fragrant and changes colour (be careful, you don't want to burn it, just gently roast it). Keep aside and follow the recipe, adding water to the vegetable-spice mixture and slowly pouring in the roasted farina, stirring all the while.

this is like the ur-recipe for the comfort food of my childhood! i was missing the ginger and the cashews but it still came out sooo good. i also added diced potatoes, cos my mom does. i'm eating my second bowl right now. oh, and a note on semolina - you can use cream of wheat, it's the same thing (or at least, similar enough.)
