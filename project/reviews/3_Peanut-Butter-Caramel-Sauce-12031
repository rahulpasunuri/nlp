We really enjoyed this on ice cream, but we had to use more sugar to get the sauce as sweet as we wanted. We used organic creamy peanut butter, so maybe that was the problem.

This sauce was entertaining to make and was absolutely delicious in the sundaes I made. I got wide eyes and a huge grin from my husband, too. Would've rated it 3.5 forks if available. Will definitely make again!

This one is declicious and easy. I was wary of this recipe because I really wanted to find (and haven't yet) a true peanut butter topping like they have at Serendippity in NYC, plus I love caramel sauce and couldn't see the two mixing well. I was wrong. My very picky and opinionated (regarding food) 13 and 10 year olds loved it and my husband who previously declared that he disliked both caramel and peanut butter sauces (only bitter sweet chocolate sauce for him, thank you very much!)said, "Wow!" and widened his eyes upon tasting it. It worked for him because it's different from anything you've ever had and it stands alone very successfully. Also, it tastes much better than the sum of its ingredients; the kind of sauce that if you had it in a fancy restaurant you'd be scratching your heard trying to figure out how they made it.
