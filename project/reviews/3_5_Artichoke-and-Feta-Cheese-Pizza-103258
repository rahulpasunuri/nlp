This is an amazing recipe that I make quite often now. For a bit more of a twist I add pesto to the dough in place of the artichoke marinade and as an extra topping I include proscuitto. A great combination with a nice salad of oil & balsamic mixed greens.

I forgot to mention that i added Kalamata olives which I consider critical to the recipe. I would not make it without Kalamata olives.

This was fantastic -- and so easy. I sprinkled fresh basil before baking and put about 1 tsp olive oil on the crust before adding toppings. My kids loved it. I will definitely make again.

Well, I did change one thing. I added 1/4 cup parsley instead of the mint called for, and I added it before I put the pizza in the oven. It was vert good.

This is a straightforward and delicious recipe. I don't make pizza often, but this was worth it. I doubled the amount of tomatoes but other than that made exactly as called for. Unfourtunatly, my pizza didn't cook all the way in the middle. I think I will pre-bake the crust next time.

Excellent quick meal, particularly if you're cooking for veggies. Couldn't find fresh pizza dough so opted for puff pastry which worked just as well. Would definitely make it again.

I forgot to add tomatoes. I added sliced mediteranean olives, roasted red pepper, and red onion. Came out great. Next time, I'll definately add the tomatoes.

Different, tasty and healthier than other pizzas. Even my 9 year old enjoyed it.

Just so-so--quick, easy, good for a weeknight, but probably wouldn't make it again because there are other, better pizza recipes on this website.

We tried this recipe and absolutely loved it. Adding grilled shrimp to the last few minutes of cooking gave this pizza great complex flavors! Also, instead of using the refigerated pizza dough we bought a premade pizza crust! Will make it again for a quick and easy dinner.

I made this pizza a while ago for my boyfriend and I, and other than the artichoke hearts causing us so much disturbance that not even the cats would sleep in the same room as us, it was great! I can see a lot of different permutations coming from this basic recipe.

My husband and I had a "pizza party" with friends recently. We gave each person a small crust (bought at an Italian deli) and we laid out different prep stations with the ingredients for several kinds pizzas (including instructions) for each to make their own. This was one of the options available and it got good reviews overall, although it was not as exciting as the other flavors we offered. This will make a great appetizer in the future, but I won't serve it again as a main dish.

My husband and I keep coming back to this recipe--it has definitely become one of our favorites. We have experimented with other toppings such as peppers and ricotta. We have also substituted the mint with fresh basil.

I used a pita instead of the pizza dough and it still turned out absolutely delicious!!! My friends loved it and took the recipe from me.

Excellent variation of pizza. Well received by numerous dinner party guests.

Added a crushed clove of garlic, sauted mushrooms, and olives. It seemed a bit bland to me. But, it does have potential.

This is perfect for a summer party as an appetizer or main dish - truely delectable. I usually have a hard time coming up with ideas for the vegetarians in my family and this really fits the bill!

I make a similar recipe that I concocted one night by adding smoked gouda, mozzerella/parmesan to the existing mix and then putting suteed mushrooms on top. Everyone raves about it.

We loved this -- I will definitely make it again. I liked how easy it was.

Good Pizza , made this and several other types for a super bowl party...they all were hits. I also added olives (Greek) to this pizza. It went well with a Greek salad I made too.

I made this for my husband for his birthday. He LOVED it (as did I). I added kalamata olives, which gave it an extra kick. Would definitely make again. The two portions were enormous!

YUM! It was fast and easy and impressive to my husband on a week night. The marinade from the artichoke hearts was a nice touch and I doubled the amount called for.

I thought this was a great pizza. I made the crust extremely thin because that's how I like my pizza. I also think that in terms of prepackaged dough,frozen pizza dough is sometimes the best option, especially if you rub it with olive oil before you defrost it.

I tried the basic recipe and found it interesting. Needing more, though, I added mushrooms, black olives, and two crumbled veggie burgers. WOW!!!

This was delicious and easy. I used a little less feta cheese and artichokes because I added shitake mushrooms and they all have such strong flavors. I also added mozzarella cheese because I love lots of cheese on everything, especially pizza. Next time I won't use the tube of dough. I found it to be rather bland. Otherwise this is great.

This is one delicious pizza! I too did a little adjusting by adding sauteed mushrooms and green pepper,as well as a part of the sweet onion. I'm just a big fan of the more the better on a pizza I guess, but this one is great!!

not only will I make it again.. I'm making it right now! I put more than 5 oz. of feta on instead, because I'm a cheese-oholic.

Very easy and tasty. I substituted sun dried tomatoes for fresh tomatoes and fresh basil for mint. I highly recommend using the refrigerated pizza dough over bobli.

This pizza was excellent & SO easy. Thanks for the tip about using a Boboli pizza base from a previous reviewer ; we used this (plus the sprinkling of cornmeal) & it worked out perfectly. We used the sun-dried tomato & basil flavoured feta cheese & cherry tomatoes, instead of the plum tomatoes (at this time of year, cherry tomatoes seem to be the only ones with any flavour in this part of the world). Altogether, a great, quick, and easy meal, served with a big salad, & a glasss of wine.

I thought this pizza was great! Not being an Onion lover, I skipped the sweet onions and added mushroms and banana peppers. I also sprinkled the crust with garlic pwder, and topped the pizza with freash basil and oregano instead of mint.

This recipe is SO easy to make and the resulting product is delicious! Artichoke hearts and Feta Cheese are among some of my favorite ingredients, as are these "Bistro-Style" pizzas, so this dish was practically a hit with me before I even made it. In place of the tubed pizza dough, I had a standard sized thin crust Boboli crust in the pantry, so I used that with good results. I wasn't sure just what "6 ounces of plum tomatoes" amounted to. I found, however, that 3 "average" sized Romas worked very well. The 6-1/2 ounce jar of marinated artichoke hearts did not provide quite enough marinade, so I christened the Vidalia onions with a sprinkling of Extra Virgin Olive Oil.Not being a mint lover, I topped the completed product with 2 T. of chopped fresh tarragon and I thought the result was excellent. P.S: If you like this recipe, go to the "FIND RECIPE" section of this Web Site and type in "Pizza With Roasted Garlic, Bell Peppers And Two Cheeses." It is also an excellent "Bistro-Style" pizza!
