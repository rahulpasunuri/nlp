The granita is very tasty and worked well with musk melon (cantalope). Both mint and basil fresh and from my garden.

Yum! Use a simple syrup (homemade mint simple syrup even better). If using to entertain- make 1 hour before guests arrive and assemble/garnish as they arrive.

Have made this several times ( in the summer)and it is wonderful. It sounded weird to me, but the combination is really refreshing. I have no idea about conversions between sugar and corn syrup, but several basic cookbooks devote pages to it.

to the lady from Canada: she said is better to use cornsyrup instead of sugar, but in what proportion!!!

Love the marriage of contrasting flavours but prefer the use of a syrup instead of white sugar, I used clear white cornsyrup and the Granitas texture was more professional
