Very good. I used plain Greek yogurt, and did not strain. Added very finely diced red onion...yum! Served with toasted naan bread and chicken and veggie skewers.

Simple way to strain the yogurt: Line a strainer with a coffee filter(s) and let sit overnight. Keep some of the reserve liquid in order to reconstitute as necessary.

I like to use bigger cubes of cucumber for a heartier salad and instead of mint, I use dill. It is a delicious healthy snack.

Excellent with a grilled leg of lamb. I use 5 cloves of garlic and no mint. The greek strained yogurt makes this very easy to make. It makes a ton so cut the recipe in half unless you are cooking for a large crowd.

This recipe gets four forks especially if you use Greek yogurt. I've used other types of yogurts and they don't even compare to the thickness, texture and flavor the Greek yogurt gives to this tsatsiki. I live in Astoria, NY so this type of yogurt is readily available. Try to find it: it doesn't need strained and makes all the difference. I am a garlic fiend and added more, but other than that followed the recipe exactly. My guests couldn't get enough of it!

I've made this several times and do modify it a bit - I like a tad of cider vinegar and a pinch of sugar - just tastes great. Willy Wonka - it's completely ridiculous idiots like you that make this site amusing - thanks for your absolute lack of intelligence!! It's so fun!!

if you can find yiaourti sakoulas which is a greek yogurt there is no need to stain it through a sieve. it's thicker and richer than regular yogurt. it made a big difference...delicious. p.s. add more garlic

At last a tsatsiki recipe which recommends draining the yogurt and squeezing out the excess liquid of the cucumber. If you don't do that, it will turn out no more than a creamy cucumber juice instead of a thick sauce. A perfect recipe, I only tripled the amount of garlic, but that's just a matter of taste.

Too hard. I didn't even try it. We ordered pizza. If anyone has the same experience, write it down and stick it in a box somewhere, cause I sure don't give a damn.

I have a recipe from my Greek sister-in-law for this which calls for 8-10 cloves of Garlic. I highly recommend using that many. It really makes it what it is. Also, use whole milk fat yougurt and you don't necessarily have to strain it. It's still good. We leave out the mint and add a couple tablespoons of Apple Cider Vinegar. VERY tasty. Great with pita or a nice fresh loaf of french bread...

I used more garlic, more salt, and added pepper and crumbled feta cheese, but left out the mint. I also substituted half of the amount of yogurt with sour creme. This can be used as a dip, sauce, or baked potato topping
