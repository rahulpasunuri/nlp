Following the advice of other reviewers, I made this cake exactly according to the recipe, using 8" pans. It was terrific! The cake is very delicate and delicious.

This was the strangest cake. It didn't brown at all and it came out incredibly dense. I haven't tasted the baked product but the batter tasted extremely sweet. I don't plan to bake this again.

I made all kinds of substitutions and this *still* came out fabulously! Used AP flour, salted butter (omitted salt), and light soy milk. Don't have a mixer so I used my bare hands to smoosh sugar and butter et. al together. Served with lemon icing. Guests and I were thrilled!

No cake flour in the house but I did the remove 2tbsp rule from each cup of AP flour. Delicious. Very much like the Duncan cake mix (and like my favorite cornbread recipe), right down to the 3 eggs, the butter, etc.

I made this last year with wonderful results as noted below. I've made it again this year for the same event, with the same ingredients including fresh baking powder, also the same pans, and it has done the 1-inch thing that so many complain of. I have no idea what I did differently. The only thing I can think of is that I might have used bread flour last time, and I might have hand mixed rather than using the food processor (I don't have a mixer) - I will try again at some point as this was a fabulous recipe when it worked! At least the 1-inch cake still tastes good.

Hey this recipe does not require special mixing I just mixed all of the wet and then just threw in the dry. I did alternate mixing flour and milk (cause its easier), but I just put in the salt and baking powder in the first cup of flour that I added. I do not own an electric mixer. I just beat it by hand until smooth. I made it for cupcakes and doubled the recipe and got 42 cupcakes. Yummy cake.

This is a small recipe, using only 2 cups of flour when the usual 9" layers use 3 cups of flour. It is therefore best to make this in small pans, no larger than 8". It will also bake quickly. Good sized recipe for 10-12 cupcakes.

Allergies prevent me from using a store bought cake mix so I'm on the hunt for a good from-scratch recipe. There are no shortcuts here... you really do have to do all the beating. It makes a usable cake but a bit on the dry side... not a ringing endorsement. (One time I didn't adhere to the mixing times; it was so dry I just threw it away.) The cake expands nicely during cooking but 5 minutes of cooling shrinks it into a patty roughly the size of the batter I poured into the cake pans. The eaters didn't complain, but I'm convinced there's something better out there. I'll keep looking.

This recipe was pretty good... but extremely small. It reminded me of pound cake, and was not as moist as I would like. But it was delicious. I would not recommend making it in the two 8- or 9-inch pans, because they came out so small (almost less than 1'') . But again, it was a great cake.

Just made and ate this. Yum! Nice dense texture, moist. Served it with Rhubarb Compote on top. If you want thicker layers, just double the recipe.

I can't understand the bad reviews. I adore this cake, it is moist and crumb-y and buttery and vanilla-y. Prefect, it does rise with good, fresh baking powder. Definitely my go-to all-purpose yellow cake.

This has worked well and I'll happily use it again. The batter roughly doubled in volume as it rose, making a perfectly satisfactory cake. I used plain flour and this was fine.

This is my go-to recipe for children's birthday cakes. I usually make two batches for a substantial, two-layer 13 X 9 cake. It is perfect for making 3-D cakes (fire trucks, space-ships, castles etc.) because of its texture. As others have said, it doesn't rise very much but this is more than offset by the great, mild vanilla flavour and the dense consistency.

Rating: 2
This is a flavourful cake, however small and dense. I used it as a base for peanut butter cake (added 1/2 cup of peanute butter) and it was outstanding. So I tried it with 1/2 cup sour cream, and the result is superb. The texture is light and fluffy and the flavour is wonderful.

I made this recipe despite the negative reviews. While not an awful recipe, it's really not stellar. Like many people discovered, the cake came out flat, dry, and dense for me too. The batter, in my opinion, didn't yield enough for a good sized layer cake. The search continues . . .

I loved this recipe!! Even though it didn't rise like the other commenters said, it was still wonderful!! I love to create different things with cakes. I was looking for a cake recipe to bake so I could put a small gift in the center of it for christmas. I baked 2 9 x 13s and cut each in half. It ended up being a 4 layer cake only 2 inches thick (a half an inch thick each layer). Much of the cake was cut away to make room for the gift, but the remaining scraps that where left where eaten so fast I didn't know what happen to them. I was asked to make the recipe again only without a gift inside this time! It was so easy to make and to my surprise so easy to cut and shape into what I needed. I will be using this recipe again for my more harder designs. It is tasty and moist yet very sturdy! Thats very hard to come across! A regular out of the box can't do what this cake can't do! If your creative or your just looking for a great taste thats not out of the box this recipe this for you, just remember it doesn't rise ( at all ) so plan accordingly!

I made this recipe with a couple of modifications. I did not have cake flour on hand, so i substituted it with all purpose flour (two cups of flour - 4 tbs) + 4 tbs corn starch. I baked in two six inch tins. It took ~ 26 minutes, although my oven temp may have been off. Each layer is about 1.75 inches thick and is moist and airy. I sandwhiched the two together with whipped cream and strawberries! Delicious and a nice summertime presentation.

I have not used this exact recipe, but I use a very similar one that turns out well and probably addresses some of the concerns mentioned. It calls for only two eggs, but three teaspoons of baking powder and 1 tsp. salt. I also use only one tsp. vanilla flavor. The cake flour should be sifted before measuring and then sifted with the other dry ingredients. This cake turns out moist and flavorful. The layers are not huge, but big enough. I always use 2 percent milk because that's what we drink and it's fine. It's a great base for a coconut cake with pineapple filling and buttercream frosting.

Well, I did not expect to see so many negative comments. I had been saving this recipe for some time to see how it would stand up to the boxed version. Overall, it was better -- but if you are looking for that taste (and smell) that you get from the box, it will not be there. Firstly, mine came out really moist. One person commented that it might have to do with the humidity in the air. Well, it was ridiculously humid, so I guess that could have been why. As for taste, while I was not looking for that taste that you get from the box, I was hoping for something a little more buttery. It was a bit bland, but good for a birthday cake with homemade frosting. Perhaps I will use salted butter, as suggested by other reviewers. True, it did not rise very much. If I want to make one of those very high, impressive looking cakes, next time I would make a third layer. My take: It is not the best cake out there, but for a frosted birthday cake, I would make it again.

This cake is perfect! It's easy to make and delicious - so moist! Whenever I make yellow cake I turn to this recipe. Everyone loves it. I always have to double my recipe because it goes so fast. If you are looking for a simple recipe that tastes like you slaved in the kitchen all day this is for you!

I've searched everywhere for a simple yet tasty yellow cake recipe, and this is it. I sifted the flour 3 times, as recommended by other reviewers, and I think this added to the tenderness of the cake. I also used 1/2 skim milk, 1/2 heavy cream for the liquid (I think the added fat helped keep the cake moist). Because I was baking a very large cake (triple the recipe in an extremely large rectangular pan) I added just a tiny bit of vegetable oil along with the eggs (due to the longer baking time, it can get dried out very easily). I also used more vanilla than the recipe called for, because I'm fond of the flavor, and I didn't want it to taste too eggy. The texture of the cake was delicate, with very small and evenly formed air bubbles. The flavor was subtle but pleasant, and not overly sweet (this is a very good cake to use with a more complex tasting filling). I filled mine with strawberry mousse, and it was great. I think it's very important not to overmix the batter during the addition of the milk and dry ingredients, or you will end up with a cake with a coarse consistency. The actual color of the cut cake is white (I assume yellow cake mixes are yellow because they add some kind of artificial coloring).

I followed this recipe exactly and it was terrible. The flavor was so-so, it was heavy & dense and did not rise at all. I will not make this again, a cake out of the box would be better.

I followed directions exactly and this cake was so-so with flavor and a bit on the dry side even though I underbaked it slightly. It didn't have the boxed aftertaste of course but still wasn't what I was hoping for. I used a simple whipped cream frosting and still needed ice cream with it. I will look around for a better yellow cake recipe.

Great recipe! I have never been able to make a layer cake without it falling before this. I followed the suggestions of sifting dry ingredients 3 times, and added the last ingredients (dry/milk alternating) by hand so they wouldn't be overmixed. Worked like a charm, even with half whole wheat pastry flour.

This turned out to be a simply excellent recipe and there are many helpful hints in the review list. I sifted the dry ingredients three times, added the 1/4 c. heavy cream, 1/4 c. vanilla soy milk and 2% milk combo. I doubled the vanilla and added 2 tbls of fresh orange zest along with 1 tbl of fresh squeezed orange juice. Mixing the batter as directed is very important. I used the ginger cream cheese icing recipe from Epicurious, but without the ginger. Delicious!

This was a tastey little cake. I used a rectangular pan. Only rises to about 1 1/2 ". I sliced it in half and made a square layer cake. I can see where the extra beating is critical with this recipe. Any bit of batter that I scraped from the bottom of the bowl that wasn't completely smooth created a pocket when baking. I will definitely try it again and bake for only 20 minutes not 25. Used icing recipe on back of can of Ghirardelli Unsweetened chocolate. Delicious.

I might have made a mistake by baking cupcakes for 22 min - my oven is not very hot. They turned out very tough & dry. Will try again and reduce the baking time & may add the whip cream.

I have made several differnt homemade cakes and this one is in the top 10 for sure. I did however follow the advice of one of the other people who rated this recipie. I used salted butter,sifted dry ingriedents (flour, salt and baking pwd.) 3 times and used 1/4 c.heavy cream, 1/4 c.vanilla soy milk and 2% milk. Cke comes out moist not crumbly. Also pull out of oven right away if oven runs hot leave in less time. I made this cake for my dads b-day and homemade not box yellow cake with homemade choc. frosting is his favorite he and everyone at the party loved it and wants the recipie. YEAH! FINNALLY FOUND A RECIPIE FOE MOIST YELLOW CAKE

I love these kinds of recipes: they remind me of something basic my mom would kick down that I can play with. I made this cake yesterday in big cupcake tins and it turned out delicious- light, moist and spongey- not crumbley, with a distinct butter-and-eggs flavor. It left you with a good full but not heavy feeling.:) I did a few things different- 1)I sifted dry ingredients 3xs as was suggested by other cooks. 2) I used regular flour instead of cake flour. 3)Salted Sweet cream butter instead of unsalted. 4)I replaced 3/4 cup milk with 1/4 heavy whipping cream, 1/4 lowfat milk, 1/4 vanilla soy milk. I do this often with my baked goods and it seems to help the texture. The batter was very fluffy when I was done mixing it and I transferred it directly to pan and oven, and took it out when the top was very light blonde... I can see how any delay in getting to oven would cause it to lose air and become a denser cake, and how letting it brown would cause it to get crumbly. How long was it in the oven? I dunno, sorry, I go by smell. This recipe made 9 big cupcakes.

I used Swans Down cake flour, sifted it 3 times, and added extra vanilla, as suggested by the cook from Sherborn, MA. It was delicious!! Very moist!! My mother-in-law who is picky about yellow cake fought the grand kids over the last slice. I made a 2 layer cake and then sliced the layers in half (making 4 layers) and then iced it with the chocolate frosting recipe from Bon Appetit Dec. 95. My MIL asked me to make it every time she visits.

This is a very easy and delicious cake. I followed the directions exactly and added a little bit of orange and lemon zest. It is so much better than a boxed cake- no box aftertaste. I will definitely be making this cake again. This time it will be used for a strawberry shortcake but it is very versatile and could be used for any icing/filling combo.

This is an excellent recipe, with the following modifications: 1) sift the dry ingredients 3 times. The tender texture is worth the effort. 2)Double the vanilla (and use good vanilla!) Also make sure ALL ingredients are at room temp!

This cake was very disappointing. It came out bitter tasting, flat, and dry. I made one substitution of 1% milk for whole milk and do not think this would account for how terrible it turned-out. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The recipe was also way too involved. Next time I will definately buy a mix!

This cake was very disappointing. It was dry and very flat. I thought the flavor was subtle and nice, but my husband thought it tasted like sawdust. In reading other peoples' reviews perhaps it might have helped the texture a little if I had mixed the dry ingredients in by hand instead of on the lowest speed of my mixer. Perhaps the key is the level of humidity in the air while making this cake?

Yet again, another bad review from a person that didn't follow the recipe. If you don't follow it 100%, don't DARE to give it a bad review, you just look like an idiot!!! "I used margarine (gag!!!)and soy creamer (more gag!)" but it didn't come out right. Gee, wonder why??

Bay Area is right about adjusting ingredients in baking. A little extra milk is not really going to make the cake moister. This cake is how cake should be, not an artificially flavored, artificially moist cake from a mix. But...if you are looking for the cake to be moister: Check to see if the cake is done a few minutes before the recipe states(if your oven temp is off slightly, a few minutes can make all the difference) Substituting vegetable shortening for some of the butter will make the cake moister, although you lose some of the flavor. Please do not use the butter flavored shortening! (All butter can lead the cake to seem dry instead of moist.) Another option is lightly brushing with a simple syrup (spiked if you want to add flavor) when you take the cake out of the oven.

I would suggest NOT adding more milk to the list... you can't just start tweaking the amounts of liquids/eggs/flour/etc. as each performs a distinct duty and upsetting the balance causes chaos! (well, maybe not chaos, but a poorly textured cake at least) The ingredients & amounts are correct but make certain to use room temp. butter & soft pastry flour and after the dry ingredients are sifted in incorporate it very gently, by hand to avoid gluten build up in the batter (causes toughening... great for crusty country style bread, bad for delicate pastries & cakes.)

I made this cake last night for a dinner party. Big mistake! I followed the instructions implicitly, but it came out somewhat dry. The only plus was that the flavor was wonderful so I was able to save it with a scoop of ice cream. My suggestion would be to add 1/4c of milk if you venture to make it.

I noted the mixed reviews before choosing this recipe for a birthday cake, but thought I'd give it a try. I used a non-hydrogenated margarine and soy creamer instead of milk - my birthday girl is dairy-free. The cake was pretty dry and unremarkable. The upshot is that it provided a nice, solid surface for the mocha filling and fudge frosting.

I think this is a great recipe for yellow cake. Mine always turns out moist and fluffy. The article in the August '02 Gourmet is absolutely right on the money...making this cake is just as easy as making one not from scratch. And, it is free of chemicals, artificial colors and flavors, and preservatives. Use this recipe for the Peanut Butter Chocolate Cake on this Web site; that way, you can avoid using a boxed mix (YUCK!). I will definitely make this again!

I made this cake twice over the holiday. The first time it came out great but I thought it was a little dry. The second time I added a box of vanilla pudding and 1/4 cup milk at the end and mixed just to get combined well. It was fantastic!! Kids and husband loved it.

I made this for my husband's birthday instead of the usual Devil's Food from scratch and it was a big disappointment. Not enough batter for two "normal" sized layers, only two very flat layers. Seeing the small layers, I cut the frosting recipe in half and had more than enough. Very dry with not much flavor. The only positive thing I can say is the crumb was very velvety and fine.

I just made 3 yellow cakes to test the recipes prior to my son's first birthday. I'm glad I did because the first two were dry and awful. This one was moist and good. Its a little flat though. I made it as a sheet cake and I think I'm going to make a layer cake for the real event so it doesn't look so sad and flat.

To tell the truth, I haven't tried it, but maybe you food mavens can give me some help. WAY back in the '60's I got a recipe for sherry cake which was better than any plain old yellow cake: 1 package yellow cake mix, 3/4 cup oil, 3/4 cup sherry, package instant vanilla pudding, 4 eggs and some nutmeg. Beat it with a mixer for 4 minutes, put in prepared ring pan or bundt, bake at 350 degrees till done (about an hour), invert on rack to cool. Then the cake mix makers started "new and improving" by adding pudding to the mixes, but not the same ratio. The results were not as good without the pudding and not as fluffy with it. Any ideas on how to get there from here?
