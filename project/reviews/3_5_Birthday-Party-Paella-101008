It was good, but nothing special.Definitely makes a lot. Half the recipe will easily serve 8. Made for Bunco and the family was eating left overs for days.

Really good. I don't usually measure much when I'm cooking and I'm prone to making my own adjustments to recipes. For this one, I made it almost exactly as directed except I used chicken breasts and shredded them in big chunks and I subbed peas for the zucchini. I have a family of 5 and one is a teenaged boy who eats A LOT. We have enough leftovers to feed a small country. It makes a ton. I'll definitely make this the next time I have a crowd.

I LOVED this! Easy and delicous. Made ahead like suggested, then just put it all together and baked! Like other reviews, I used long grain rice. I would do without the zucchini next time and maybe use green pepper instead. I used SMOKED paprika which added a wonderful flavor!

I poured over paella recipes looking for one that could be put in the oven instead of on top of the stove, so that I could enjoy my own party. This one fit the bill. It was delicious, but here were my problems. I was serving 9 people, so I upped the recipe to serve 10. But I had a paella pan that served 8 (the larger size wouldn't fit in my oven). I followed a lot of the modifications mentioned in various reviews, such as cutting the red peppers into smaller strips, sauting them with onions, deglazing the pan with a little wine, substituting peas for zucchini. All were good suggestions. But the pan was too small to hold all the liquid, so I put about a quarter of the mixture in a smaller casserole pan and piled it on top of the paella pan for serving. We had a ton of rice leftover, so I think the rice (and consequently the liquid) could be cut down a bit. It cooked a lot longer than the recipe, mainly because I forgot it, but it didn't seem to hurt things. I did stick to the cooking time for the last bit with the shrimp. I found Vallencia rice at Trader Joe's, and it was delicious. The smoked paprika was a good addition--there is quite a difference in smell between that and my regular paprika. All in all, a good dinner party dish as long as your pan is big enough!

We will definitely make this again, but we'll go with a good long-grain rice instead of arborio rice, which is a bit too creamy.

Nice recipe, decent, i made some significant changes by substituting chicken and sausage for ocean Perch making just a seafood paella. It could have used a little bit more of a punch. The taste was very nice, but a little bland. I would definitely make it again and probably play around with more paprika and maybe cayenne pepper.

This has become a staple in my house. I love to make this when I am having guests because everything can be done ahead of time and it allows me to enjoy our company. I use peas instead of zucchini, skinless boneless chicken thighs, and add mussels with the shrimp. It's delicious. I agree with some reviews about the arborio rice but can rarely find calisparra and never remember to order it far enough in advance. We love this recipe!

Rating: 3
I've been making this recipe for years. And, since I've never had authentic paella, this is my standard. It does take a lot of prep so I've now substituted the Cosco rotisserie chicken right before I serve because its so tender and cheaper than if I bought chicken and cooked it myself. Very flavorful and colorful. Sometimes I also add scallops and a firm white fish. There's a bit of something to please every palate.

Made this for 14 guests at our New Year's Eve party this year - 2010. Everyone had positive feedback, many went back for seconds and one guest said it was the best paella he ever tasted! I'm a direction follower, so I kept to the script using a few suggestions from other reviews- I used Uncle Ben's rice and green peas instead of zucchini. My batch did not fit in the suggested size pan. So I used the 13x9 and a 9inch round. Also, I'd say this makes closer to 20 servings unless some people just eat REALLY large servings. I loved the make ahead factor and felt the end result was well worth the advance work.

wow i was really looking forward to this, after reading all of the great reviews. I prepared it for my 40th birthday party and was very underwhelmed, despite roasting the red peppers beforehand and using chorizo and peas like others had suggested. I dont get what all the fuss is about! I wish I had made something else, or maybe a more authentic paella... I am giving it one fork because it was just "OK."

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe that I have made several times. I always use peas instead of zucchini. THe one thing that I find is that it takes a lot longer than 1 hour to cook. I always cook for 1.5 to 2 hours and it is perfect with some nice crunchy pieces. It is never fully cooked after 1 hour.

This recipe was delicious, although I disagree with the reviewers who said that it would serve 12 people. I think that unless you have several courses, it will serve 8 nicely. I made a couple changes based on a recipe for chicken, chorizo and brown rice from the Saveur website. (It's very similar, and it's fantastic. You should try it.) I think it's really annoying when people review recipes that they've made a lot of changes to, but my changes make sense. So here goes: I first pan-seared the chicken (but didn't cook it through, which keeps it moist), and drained the drippings. I then sauteed the sliced chorizo, removed it with a slotted spoon, and added the veggies to sautee. I added the rice (not arborio--that doesn't make any sense) to the hot pot and sauteed it for a couple minutes, and then I deglazed the pan with white wine, which I then simmered until it was absorbed/evaporated.I would highly recommend adding the wine because it added a very nice flavor. From there on out I followed the recipe, except I added mussels and clams. It's just not paella with only shrimp. I thought that 20 minutes might be too long to cook the seafood, but it turned out perfect. I did add 10 minutes to the cooking time before the addition of the seafood, though, and I think I may add more next time. Next time I will also either sautee the red peppers with the onions, or I will use roasted red peppers. The way they're cooked in this recipe makes them turn out mushy, watery, and bland. Overall, this is a great recipe for company, or you can cut it in half for fewer people. It's really not as much work as some people have made it out to be. P.S. Don't use zucchini--that's gross. Use peas like everyone else.

Rating: 4
What a hit! I served it with a tomato salad and a platter of grilled vegetables to a party of 12 and we had so much left over. I do think that you need to use extra large or jumbo shrimp so the shrimp make a statement and don't get lost in the rice. Three people have already asked for the recipe, they wanted to know why it never looked as though I was cooking!

I have never taken the time to review a recipe before ( shame on me), but I am compelled to sing the praises of this one. Everyone who ate it can't stop talking about it. I don't know how authentic it is, but who cares, as it is sublimely delicious.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe when it first came out in 3/99 and I absolutely love it and so have all my guests over the years. It's a great make ahead meal that lets you visit with your company while your entire meal is baking in the oven. I've always made it with the Italian sausage and Uncle Ben's rice. Without question I give it 5 stars.

Rating: 2
Nice flavor but I would not make this again with Aborio rice. My whole family agreed that the creamy, sticky Aborio ruined the recipe, but they all said they would like to try it again with a different rice. My Cooks Illustrated did a paella test with different types of rice and their testers liked Valencia even more than Calasparra. I'll try this recipe with Valencia next time. Also, I did rinse the Aborio very thoroughly, until the water ran clear and it was still too starchy, creamy for us. Good for a risotto which is meant to be creamy, but in my opinion, not for Paella.

This was wonderful. I also used green peas instead of zucchini,and added 1/2 tsp. of dried red chili peppers for a little heat. Perfect for company, as the prep work can all be done ahead of time. My guests loved it!!!

This is always well received. Sometimes use peas instead of zucchini. 3 forks for taste + 1 for ahead ease.

I made this for a dinner party last night and it was a huge success. I took other reviewers' suggetions and substituted peas for zucchini and Spanish chorizo for the sausage. I also used Calasparra rice. It was so creamy and delicious one of my guests ate three servings. I gave this 4 forks for three reasons. First, the taste was great Second, it was a great make ahead dish. I was able to spend time with my guests rather than spending time in the kitchen. Finally, the presentation was beautiful--everyone at the table was wowed. I will make this again and again.

What a find! I thought paella would be hard to make. I love this dish so much, that I've already made it 4 times, and I've got it down. One change that makes it easier: as directed, I sequentially cook the sausage, chicken, and vegetables in a dutch oven on the stove. But instead of layering it all into a baking dish, I just layer everything back in the dutch oven, cover tightly with foil, and bake in the oven. I also add about a dozen small, whole, fresh crimini mushrooms. They're not authentic (neither is the zucchini), but they're yummy treasures to happen upon in the rice. Once I bought huge tiger prawns because they were the only wild shrimp the store had. I cut them each into 2 pieces after cleaning so they were a better size. I also like to use the hot Italian chicken sausage made at our food coop.

Rating: 3
My first time making paella. It was wonderful, although I made a few changes. First, we live in Utah now(transplants from NH), and try to steer clear of most fish as it is very difficult to find good quality here, so the shrimp were out. I also omitted the zucchini based on another reviewer's feeling that it threw off the balance of flavor. I used chorizo sausage which lent a nice subtle, smoky flavor. I also used approximately twice the amount of saffron suggested. A note to the reviewer regarding the overpowering starchiness of the rice: I rinse the arborio rice at least several times in cold water until the water runs nearly clear to remove some of the starch. Finally, I would suggest buying saffron online rather than at a market. Unless you are married to the idea of the highest-quality saffron available, good Spanish saffron is available at sites like Spicebarn.com at a fraction of the price.

I have made this several times, sometimes halving the recipe for just the family or increasing the proportions for a crowd. But for a crowd, I have used a crock pot to cook it rather than the oven, following all the other directions as written, after browning and precooking the meat and sausage. Then I put the rice and tomatoes and other ingredients in the crock pot and cook on high for about an hour, or until the rice is cooked, or on low for longer. You have to check according to the type of rice you use or the quantity of the paella. But leaving it on low for awhile while the guests are there is not a problem, it just keeps it warm. So you can start it earlier, just to be safe. Just such an easy way to entertain and not have to time anything. But one word on the rice, use a medium grain rice of good quality. It makes a big difference.

Rating: 4
Tastes great and, honestly, guests always rave about it. We've cut the receipe in half when there's only two of us - and there's still lots left over. Best feature (besides the taste) - put together before guests arrive, bake after they show up, continuing entertaining, and serve when done. You're not stuck in the kitchen. I've made this recipe about 6 or 7 times. It's always turned out and people really enjoy it as much as I do. Fantastic recipe.

I made this dish last night. It was great. I got an All Clad 17 inch oval roaster for the look. It filled up to the top with this recipe. I used three cups of rice with the original 5 cups of broth, it took an extra 30 minutes for the rice to cook. After that, I added steamed clams and mussels along with the raw shrimp for 20 minutes. It was perfect! This recipe feeds more than 10 people for sure. I will be making this over and over again.

Made this for my brother's b-day, he said it was the best thing I ever cooked him. Make sure you read through and prepare well & organize, and it's not that hard, technically speaking, just takes time. Deveining shrimp is a pain. I reduced excess liquid from cooking onions, tomatoes & pepper (after leaving in bowl for a while)with 1 cup clam juice & shrimp shells to get 1 cup of delicious broth, added that to 4 cups chicken stock... Also, I put sugar-snap peas instead of Zuchini. It gave it a fresh, sweet, springtime flavour..yummy!!!

Rating: 4
This one's a winner! I undercooked the chicken & sausage, which very moist, even though my arborio rice took 30 extra minutes to absorb the liquid. Used one fewer pepper and smaller onions. Added shellfish with the shrimp in the last stage which made for a nice presentation. Will definitely make this again, especially for a crowd because it feeds enough for an army!

I have made this 2x now and really love it. I would however rate it 4 forks if it didn't taste so starchy. I have used arborio rice both times - would rinsing the rice first help? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

I hesitated giving three forks, but decided against giving four. The dish became superlative, but because of modifications. First of all, drop the zucchini as other reviewers suggested. The bitterness that most zucchinis have will throw this entire dish off balance (taste and texture wise). Use peas as other reviewers have done. Cut the peppers (I used two small ones and it was plenty) into far thinner (1/4 inch) strips - 1 inch ruins the presentation and is hard to eat. Also, use chorizo if you can find it. Italian hot sausage has fennel seeds which, again, will overpower the suble flavors (read: saffron) in this dish. Lastly, use CALASPARRA rice (Williams-Sonoma carries this in their stores as do other high end kitchen stores, or purchase online). In Spain, paella is a rice dish that is enhanced by fish, meat, etc. The focus is on the rice. Use mediocre rice and you will get mediocre results. Sometimes you can't cut corners and this is one of those times. One final thought: this dish takes some time to prepare - cook the chorizo and chicken ahead of time and pre-chop all your veggies). With these modifications, your family, friends, etc. will be practically licking their plates clean (mine did!)

I made this for New Years Eve and it was very well received. Oven cooking is a bonus for this recipe. I would agree with suggestions to reduce veggies- I halved the red pepper and used 4 cups onions and they still seemed too plentiful. I don't eat chicken so I used vegetable broth instead and added 2 lbs of salmon cut into large pieces with the shrimp. I added a cup of water with the seafood and cooked for about 30 minutes longer instead of 20.

Wonderful! Just made this for the first time. I remember seeing this recipe when it appeared in Bon Appetit...I'm kicking myself that I have let 5 years go by before making it! I made this for my husband's birthday, and it was a hit. Delicious and very simple to make. I definitely recommend using aborio rice if you have it. Thought it seemed sort of wierd to be putting in such large pieces of zucchini, but after it had baked I could see that small pieces might have become too mushy.The big pieces give the finished dish a nice appeareance. A perfect, stress-free, make-ahead dinner party meal. Easy to halve or double, etc.

This is delicious. I made everything the day before, since I was travelling with the dish...I combined the chicken, sausage, veggies, and rice and put into my roasting pan and into the fridge. Then the next day, I added the boiling saffron/chx broth mixture. I was very worried about the quality of the rice this way, but it turned out great!

I had a chance to savor this dish at a dinner party and was so impressed that I asked for the recipe. However, when I make it I will add a bit more saffron for color and flavor. And substitute the succhinni for peas. Paella is an authentic spanish dish. succhinni is an italian vegetable.

Great for a dinner party as you can make ahead, then assemble and bake when guests arrive. I cut onion back to 2 onions, and diced the red pepper and made crescent shapes for the zucchini - they made a lovely presentation. Doubled, even tripled, the garlic and saffron. Used 4 cups chicken broth, one cup clam juice. Used Spanish chorizo which is milder than Mexican chorizo - it had great flavor. Also added clams and mussels at the beginning, but waited until the end to add shrimp. Next time I would probably steam the clams and mussels separately in the clam juice chix broth saffron mix (make extra), then add at the end. Delicious meal, great presentation, and this made enough for at least 10 people (and I cut back to 8 chicken thighs!).

I have had lots of paella both in Spain and in Spanish restaurants in the States and I think this is pretty darn close to the real thing--despite it's not being made in the traditional paella pan. However, I did make it with peas and chorizo instead of the zucchini. And I did cut down on the bell pepper and used 2 onions instead of what was called for. If there was any difference, it was that this might've been a little more moist than the typical paella. But given how no two paellas are alike--even in Spain--I consider the difference very minor. It tasted very authentic to me.

Rating: 3
Despite some comments that it was too much work, I didn't feel that way at all, given that you can feed an army with it, and there is literally something for everyone in it. I used cut up chicken breasts, and they did turn out a little dry, so I probably won't brown them again in the future. I followed the cooking instructions to a tee, and my white rice was definitely not finished. I'm going to cook it for longer next time, and hopefully the rice will be more edible! I used peas, and cut up the red pepper really small. Overall, however, everybody loved the dish, and my 12 month old son has been eating leftovers since.

This was my first time making paella. I halved the recipe and there was more than enough for 5. It's quite filling. I used skinless, boneless thighs and they were tasty and juicy. I added some spices to them before cooking (cayenne,chili,garlic,onion,paprika)which i think added a bit of added flavour. And as someone suggested i undercooked just slightly so it wouldn't dry out in the oven. I used hot italian sausage. I also added some calamari rings. I didn't use zucchini and meant to put in the peas but forgot, it was fine without it. Probably added more saffron than called for but i don't think it made a difference. My family loved it and i'm going to make it for a girls anti-valentines valentines dinner!! LOL!! Enjoy it, it's a great dish.

I was looking for a recipe that could be made ahead for company and reheated at serving time. This was perfect. I did not have saffron but used a pinch of tumeric for the colour. I wish I had a large deep oven dish instead of the roasting pan. It would look so much better to go from the oven to the table. This is a keeper.

Rating: 4
I know this is not authentic, but it is delicious! I like things a little fiery and zesty so I use chili oil instead of olive oil and I use a little red peppr flakes in the broth and when I marinate the prawns. I also bolied 15 mussels in white wine and added them onto the rice during the last 10 minutes. Along with the broth, I also pour in any leftover white wine or rose wine to give the rice a nice favour. I have made this a few times with arborio rice but I may try using short grain next time just because arborio makes a "mushier" paella. Definatley a keeper!

This is fabulous! Not only is it delicious but it's ridiculously simple to make. Instead of using canned tomatoes, I used leftover homemade roasted salsa. I also prefer using chicken breasts instead of thighs. The recipe halves easily for a smaller group ... I'm making it again this weekend and am going to add lobster tails.

I've made many a paella and recommend this recipe,but with some minor changes. This is a very easy recipe since it can be made ahead and baked in the oven. However, i recommend using chorizo or other spanish sausage. Forget the zucchini and add forzen peas instead. Our family prefers white meat so i used cut up chicken breasts.I suggest undercooking the chicken.it just needs to be quickly browned. It will finish cooking in the oven and will stay moist that way. Adding clams and mussels will make it more authentic.Add at the same time as the shrimp Use less bell peppers since these can really overwhelm. Arborio rice really makes a difference. And use as much saffron as you can afford. The rice should be quite yellow in color. Nothing is quite the same as eating this dish in Spain, but it's a festive party dish.

I don't dislike this recipe, but just don't think the result justified the effort. Like many have noted, adding more spices did make for a tasty dish; but, it still just doesn't taste like authentic paella. It's missing something- I can't figure out what it is.

This recipe rocks! I also halved the recipe and it made at least 5 servings. I made some minor variations: frozen peas instead of zucchini, 2 1/4 cups med. grain rice, instead of 1 1/4 cups, chorizo, extra seasonings (about 1 tsp. each cayenne pepper, garlic salt, onion powder) etc. To save time, I'm going to skip browning the chicken next time and only saute the chorizo for a few minutes. It turned out a little dry and tough. Even with the extra rice, it still fit into a 9x13inch cassarole dish and the rice still cooked perfectly. The taste was incredible and fairly easy, although a bit time-consuming, to make. My only advice is to please try it and have fun experimenting and altering the recipe to fit your tastes!

Served this last night and it was fabulous...and paella is such a beautiful dish. I used half hot and half sweet Italian sausage. Absolutely add clams at the end and skip the zucchini and use peas...that's the authentic paella. I wanted to have a "complete" Spanish menu so from this site I also made for tapas sourdough bread with marinated manchego cheese & roasted peppers,..easy and very yummy...and assorted olives and also the salad sevillana. A truly memorable meal and all of my guests called this morning to rave again. This is a keeper!

I made a half recipe as a trial run for a dinner party this weekend. It turned out nice--maybe a little bland.

Wow! It's as good as everyone else said. Did add another 1/2 cup rice and 1 cup broth, follow-up to other cooks' comments. Also added 2 lobster tails (cut into medallions) when I added shrimp. And replaced zucchini with peas. Absolutely a "4-fork" dish!

This morning, my husband requested paella for dinner, so I did a search at Epicurious. I settled on this dish, even though I was cooking for just the two of us and this recipe makes enough for an army. I halved the recipe and made a few alterations based on reading the previous reviews and our own preferences: -Instead of only shrimp, I also added lobster tail, scallops and clams. -I used chorizo sausage from the best butcher. -I added a healthy dose of red pepper flakes to the boiling stock, to the rice and to the seafood mixture. This addition, along with a little garlic powder and onion salt gave the dish a surely needed kick. This paella is a tasty, satisfying, though not authentic dish. It was a perfect choice for a cold winter night when I desired a long, but not too complicated cooking project for a night at home. (I would have given it 3.5 stars, but this rating is not offered.)

I made this paella for my husband's birthday party. There was more than enough for 9 people. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and peas. Unfortunately, I left it in the oven for too long - the rice was overcooked. I think the amount of time specified in the recipe is just right. The guests didn't seem to mind though. The paella went over very well with salad Sevillana and Sangria from this web site. Next time I will add scallops and maybe some other seafood and won't cook it as long.

This was wonderful, colorful and very flavorful. Taking the suggestions of others, I also added peas, although otherwise I made it exactly as written. The timing worked out perfectly, and the rice was great, better than it usually comes out when I make other paella recipes. I plan to put this in my file of recipes to serve as part of a large buffet, but with a minor modification. When making it for a crowd, I will use skinless boneless chicken thighs cut into chunks. That will make it easier to eat without a knife and will also mean I won't have to worry about matching the number of chicken thighs to guests.

SO delicious! I made this almost entirely the night prior to the dinner party, and just combined the elements that evening. I even peeled and dressed the shrimp. The prep took a little bit of time, but the following night, it was ready to eat in no time, with no added work. And my guests all loved it, and said it was a definite keeper. I did add peas, and used spicey sausage. Also halved the recipe, and it still served 6 adults easily. Will definitely add to my list of recipes that are a big hit.

This recipe feeds a huge crowd! On both occasions I made this recipe I needed to cook the rice longer than suggested on recipe. Make sure to test rice for softness before adding shrimp. Allow an extra 30-45 minutes of cooking. Also added peas and used spicy italian turkey sausage. Added chicken breasts for extra meat. Also rinsed the rice first. This was the main course on a Spanish themed dinner party. Menu: tapas ("Salted Almonds" this site), "Salad Sevillana", "Yellow Tomato Gazpacho", and for dessert the "Fresh Lime Tart with Meringue Lattice." Impressive meal that wowed all my dinner guests.

After reading the other reviews, I added an additional 1/2 cup of rice and found it to be far and away too much rice. The rest was wonderful, got raves. I substituted thawed frozen pea for the zucchini and added some canned artichoke quarters. The best part was that in spite of the heavy duty prep work, it was done and in the oven when everyone arrived, thus freeing me to be a hostess.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I used all of the make-ahead hints (such as doing the vegetable and meat mixtures ahead, so added these ingredients straight from the fridge into the raw rice in the roasting pan. As a result, when I then added the boiling broth, the broth cooled off so much that the rice did not cook properly, even though I added extra time. Any advice on how to avoid this?

This was very good, and makes a nice presentation. I will make it again. I did make a few slight changes. Didn't use zuccini, but added a cup of thawed frozen peas when I added the shrimp. I also added a half cup of dry white wine in place of some of the chicken stock. I halved the recipe because I only had six people, but it seemed like there was not enough rice in proportion to the rest of the ingredients. Still plenty of leftovers though. I also agree with one of the other reviewers to use skinless chicken thighs. The skin doesn't stay crisp anyway, so it doesn't add anything.

This recipe was a big hit both times that I have made it. I omitted the zucchini and added about 1 1/2 cups frozen peas. I also used a combination of sweet Italian sausages and chorizo for the hot Italian, and I mixed in 3T fresh oregano to the vegetable/rice mixture. The steamers that I put in with the shrimp for the last 20 mins were appreciated as well. This recipe makes a really nice presentation for your guests. I have served this with the Williams-Sonoma Sangria recipe, serrano ham, marinated olives, some Spanish cheeses and crusty bread. For an appetizer the Grilled Bread with Catalan Butter (from this website) is spectacular as well as the Flan recipe from the recent Barbecue Issue. This easily serves 10-12 very hungry people.

This recipe is excellent! It got rave reviews from my guests, both on presentation and taste. It is a huge recipe. I estimate that it would serve 12/15 average eaters! I made just as given, but drained each piece of chicken and sausage to reduce fat! Would probably use skinless thighs next time. Didn't use 3 peppers since mine were huge. Very successful dish and loved not having to cook on top of stove as tradional paella's are cooked. I am adding it to my party repetoire.

My guests liked this dish very much. I served six people (including three big guys) and there was plenty left over. I found several complementary side dishes by entering "Spanish" into the recipe search. I used a large calphalon turkey roaster pan for the paella and it worked very well.

Wonderful!My tweeks to the recipe were: whole chicken cut up, no zucchini, about 1 cup edamame, sausage, and some shrimp. I carmelized the onions and garlic before adding the rice. I made a half recipe and the rice was so good next time I will make the entire rice recipe and use the same amount of meat and shrimp. My husband loved it! Can't believe it took me so long to make a paella.

Authentic paella is made similar to risotto, in a pan on top of the stove. I was relieved to find this recipe since I was making a party for six families and I did not want to cook at the party. I was surprised to discover that the dish resembled risoto! Next time I would bake everything minus the seafood way in advance since it tasted great days later(I fussed with it at the party more than I would have liked). Remove the foil cover if it takes too long to cook out liquid. To keep the chicken tender I did not saute it first. I didn't use any vegetables except peas and peppers and I put in every kind of seafood possible. I served it with Sangria, we had a great time!

I have a monthly dinner party with friends and this has become our favorite dish. To make the dish a little healthier I use chicken breast, low-sodium chicken broth and spicy italian turkey sausage...it is just as amazing!!! For you weight watchers out there...this is a low point meal!

I served this last night for a group of 7 ladies. I only used about 9 pieces of chicken. It was very good and colorful. I used red and yellow peppers and did stick with the zuchinni instead of peas as some readers have substituted. The cooking time did need to be increased by about 10 min. or so as the broth was not completely absorbed. I thought the rice was alittle blah...I was thinking about using a different type. I have used the seafood, ssusage and bell pepper paella also from this site (Bon Appetit June 90)and I liked that better. But my guests raved about both of these recipes each time. I like the do ahead directions in this recipe though.

My Guest loved this recipe, I made several changes but I always do with paella, to beable to use the freshest seafood available. To make it easy I used skinless, boneless chicken legs, green peas, frozen mussels, scallops & clams. I used more saffron and red pepper. It was delicious.

Made this for a group of 8 adults. Lots of leftover rice which was great the next day. Most of the shrimp, sausage and chicken was eaten. Everyone loved it, though it did take longer to cook than the recipe stated. Could be because I had to transport it from one location to another in between the first baking and the second baking.

I made this for 4 friends with a little less saffron than suggested (I'm not a huge saffron fan). It came out delicious! Everyone loved it. Make sure the dish you bake it in is deep enough to hold everything-- and give a little extra room on top so when you serve it you can actually get a spoon in there. Delicioso!

I made this dish on New Year's eve, and everyone raved over it. I used peas instead of zucchinis according to another review plus I cooked some clams in garlic/olive oil/white wine separately and added them in at the last minute with the shrimp. It was excellent and I would make this dish again. Great for a crowd.

Have made this twice now. One large onion is plenty. I also added some hot sauce to the vegetable mixture to kick it up a notch. Made it first time with Italian Sausage and second time with Chorizo. Chorizo seems to be more spicy -- but both were good. Receives rave reviews every time and great for a crowd! Nice to be able to do most of prep work beforehand so I can enjoy the party too!

I made this for a luncheon today for 6 girlfriends. It was good, but needed more taste, so will play with it next time. I had never made paella before so didn't know what to expect. Maybe serving it with a chutney as an accompaniment?

Great. Made it for a party of 30 and was able to do most of the work before anyone got there. Added the shrimp mix 20 minutes before I served dinner and it tasted great. Some asked for Tabasco sauce.

We did the paella on the BBQ on a summer evenning and it was an amazing dish. We also added lobster. But, a "top chef" friend, told me the paella tastes much better without vegetables, just rice, onions, meat and fish.

I made this for a gourmet group dinner, and it transported well: I cooked it for the first 40 minutes, then put the pan in a newspaper lined box and took it to the host's house. Just before the main courses were served, I put in the shrimp and then baked for another 15 minutes. (I used a very large heavy pan, and all the liquid cooked away in the first 40 minutes so I had to add liquid with the shrimp.) I followed the recipe except reduced the red peppers from three to two (based on another reviewer's comment)and used peas instead of the zucchini. It is a colorful, aromatic, and delicious main dish; everyone seemed to like it, and nothing was overdone or underdone--quite a feat under the circumstances.

Rating: 4
It's true that this is not authentic paella, but it's so delicious, who cares! I used peas instead of zucchini and about half the chicken. It made about eight very large servings. Everyone loved this dish, even those who have had authentic paella. The prep time is manageable, and it's nice to have the option of doing part of it ahead of time. I'm definitely making this again.

This ranks right up there with the very best recipes we've tried from this website. We halved it, using chicken breasts cut in chunks instead of thighs, 3 sausages, and a full pound of shrimp. We cut the zucchini in fourths crosswise as well as lengthwise to achieve a more manageable size. Also used another reviewer's excellent suggestion to cook the shrimp shells in the chicken broth. For a half recipe, we used one 14 oz. can chicken broth, 1/2 cup water, and 1/4 cup sherry, and simmered the shells for 10-15 minutes until the mixture reduced to 2 1/4 cups, then strained out the shells. The liquid was absorbed and the arborio rice tender in the time specified in the recipe. Half is enough to serve six. The recipe lends itself well to the whim of the moment and to what is available at the market. Next time I might try clams and/or mussels and substitute peas for the zucchini. This is just awesome - a great addition to our "favorites" collection.

This was great! I added the sausage & prawns (shrimp) right at the end and cooked for 15 minutes - they held their individual flavours. Converting the measures was a trial but it didn't really matter. I divided the whole recipe by 4 (there were only 2 of us eating) and there is enough left over for another 2 meals.

This recipe was incredible. I used already cooked spicy cajun saugage and it didn't change the taste on bit. I question the number of people this says it feeds. I made if for a house warming party that 57 people showed up for and it went the distance.

This was a very easy recipe to put together and the results were impressive. I've made it twice; the first time I made it exactly as directed, the second time, I added some mussels and clams and some sweet peas for color. Both times, it was delicious. This is a recipe that lends itself to some creative adaptations, but is great just the way it is.

I made this for my brother's surprise birthday party. Everyone thought it was very good. I used arborio rice and the only comment I have is that I would have baked it longer. Some of the rice was not cooked all the way through.

Rating: 2
Although this went over well with my guests, I was really not that pleased with it. The taste of the peppers is too overwhelming, and I felt that it really lacked the authenticity of a true Spanish paella. The flavors of the shrimp, chicken and sausage create a lovely aromatic rice, but the pieces of sausage, shrimp and chicken themselves become nearly flavorless.

This recipe was a winner with my 8 guests for New Years Eve. I took the suggestion from one of your reviewers and used a paella pan and cooked it partially on top of stove and it did cut oven cooking time down to 20 min. I also used basmati rice. I will definitely make this one again everyone was impressed with it - I love a recipe that looks good, tastes delicious and you can prepare ahead of time so you can enjoy your guests at a dinner party.

I really enjoyed making this dish. Everyone raved how good it was. I really like the fact that you don't have to stir the rice while it's cooking; once everything is prepped, you put it in the roaster and away you go! I would definately make this again.

I thought this recipe was both delicious and easy. However it was a little more time consuming than the recipe suggests. The wait was worth it though,because it was a big hit with my family.

Great recipe. I found that by partially cooking the mixture in a paella pan that can go on a stove top then when you see that the broth is being absorbed, cover it (foil is OK) and place it in a pre-heated oven 375, cut the cooking time to 20-25 mins in the oven. Careful not to burn the rice on the stove. Also once you take it out of the oven, keep it covered for an extra 5 mins to allow the steam to finish cooking the rice. There is a saying in Spain, the guests wait for the rice, not the other way around. Enjoy.

Delicious and easy to prepare. My only suggestions are to use dry chorizo sausage instead of italian and to use basmati rice instead of arborio. Neither type of rice is authentic, but I've tried both and find that basmati gives a better texture.

I did not use shrimp in my dish. This was absolutely delicious!!! I used a chicken sausage which I bought at the local Farmer's Market. I was a little worried about using brown rice, but I just used a little extra chicken broth and it made the dish very moist and tasty.

I prepared this dish for people who I thought might not eat shellfish or sausage, hence, I only used 2 cut-up whole chickens - I cut the breasts in half so that all the pieces were managable and carefully trimmed. The "down-side" to this recipe was of my own doing in that I doubled it and it took a LONG time to prepare (Preparing 11 garlics takes me so long - any suggestions on cutting the time for this process w/out buying the prepared minced garlic?) I didn't do it in "steps" but all in one shot. I would say it took about 4 hours in total. I used arborio rice which while not "authentic," becomes to plump and tasy that it was worth the cheat. I used red, orange, and yellow peppers to make it even more colorful and lots of saffron. There was so much liquid that it ended up spilling over the sides even though I wrapped each dish in heavy-duty alum. foil and my oven was SMOKIN' from the drippings.. what a mess it made!!! I made one dish for a friend who ended up freezing it) and another for a dinner I'm giving in 3 nights. It took 1 1/2 hours for the rice to absorb all the liquid - no 40 minutes! So, although very time-consuming, the piece I tasted with some rice was yummy and I would make this again. Why the name "Happy Birthday?" Oh, and one more thing .. I ended up having to do a wash afterwards to clean all of the rags and sponges I had to use to mop up the floor and oven from all the juices that spilled over the top.

I made this dish for Easter and the family loved it. I also browned a prok tenderloin and cut it up w the rest of the meat. I topped the dish with julienned red pepper, capers, and a sprinkling f fresh green peas. I also boiled the bay leaves in the homemade chicken stock to enhance the flavor. I will definitely make this again.

king You don't need to go to Spain to learn how to make a good paella.I always start with the stock. Add all of the shrimp shells (rinsed) to the chicken broth, bay leaves, saffron and white wine to a stock pot. I prefer Uncle Ben's long grain (sorry Spain) so when I strain the shrimp stock into a large measuring container I MAKE SURE I have enough liquid for a 2-1 ratio. Add more wine if needed. Meanwhile, after the sausage(get the chorizo!) has browned, remove it from your pan and add chicken(dark meat w/skin and bones intact-flavor!) to chorizo grease. Simmer.

This is a delicious, colorful and sort of playful recipe terrific for dinner parties. I love it and have received rave reviews from friends -- it's sort of a unique thing to serve. One tip -- if using arborio rice (which I like best, good texture) it may take 5 - 10 minutes longer.

Rating: 3
Finally, a recipe with enough garlic and onions to qualify for a reasonably authentic paella! Although I cannot understand why aborio rice is even suggested, as it is not authentic. Goya and Viga make a prepackaged yellow rice that has a very good flavored seasoning with it and is less expensive than Saffron, which is the most expensive herb in the world averaging over $1,000 a lb. I find it hard to believe it is in a Basque Sheep Herders budget. The zucchini wasn't in the version I had in Spain. I also prefer to use boneless, skinless chicken, light or dark. Keep the sausage whole and slice it before browning. While I prefer the sweet Italian sausage, I have also used Hillshire Farms beef smoked sausage for a heartier flavor. Other wise, enjoy!

This dish was a hit with my bookgroup, and it was my first experience with both making and eating paella. I was pretty sure that others were having trouble with rice/absorption because they were using arborio instead of white rice, but the white rice I used could have used at least another 15 minutes. I used mussels instead of shrimp.

Just had this recipe for dinner. My wife and I are big paella fans and have found this to be the best one that we have had since we came back from Spain. It is very easy to make. You may successfully half the recipe, cook the same amount of time. We also substituted wings for the thighs and got good results. Enjoy!!!

Agree with all of the above posts. This was delicious, relatively easy (due to being able to prep ahead), and definitely takes longer than an hour in the oven (closer to 1-1/2 hours for us). It got rave reviews from all 10 guests at our "Gourmet Dinner Club"!

This is a great dish for a party, everyone loves it. I have substituted lamb and pork for the chicken which worked great. I save some time by throwing in the shrimp without shelling them. I also found that it takes a little bit longer for the liquid to absorb. But, it is worth the wait!

Very tasty! This is especially good company food because you can prepare most of it beforehand and because it can be served rather dramatically from the oven. For those who like seafood, I would recommend adding more shrimp. They seemed to disappear quickly.

This was a great paella! There was a lot of preparation, but it could be done beforehand. The one thing that I liked about this paella was that it remained moist. Others that I have tried, were quite dry. I agree with the other rating, it did take a little longer for the moisture to be absorbed.

A great dish for entertaining since it is a do-ahead. For those people on a budget, this can be expensive...saffron, shrimp. But the dish looks wonderful on the plate, smells and tastes delicious. I found that the timing was just a bit off. It took longer than one hour to cook the rice and absorb the liquid (at least in my oven)
