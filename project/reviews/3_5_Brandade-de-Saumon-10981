It's funny, I made this dish a couple of years ago and I remembered it as being delicious... and it IS delicious... but I just don't know what to DO with it... it's too heavy as an appetizer (all that bread and potato!) and it doesn't really make all that much of a meal... Chalk it up to "comfort food" I guess -- and whip it up again.

Well, this one was okay, but Gourmet published another version later (August 1997) that calls for a cured fish (add 1/4 cup kosher salt and 1 teaspoon of sugar, coat the fish and chill for 2 hours, wash the fish and prepare from the poaching phase) that I give 4 forks.
