Very good, but I made it with chicken, and didn't marinate too long (20 mins) as I was concerned flavors would be too strong.

Great quick dish to prepare...full of flavour and chops come out very moist. I also skipped the food coloring. I have prepared these then frozen them in the marinade, when ready to eat i just thaw them and put them on the BBQ - tastes great!

EXCELLENT!!! I bought the BEST 1 1/2- inch thick rib pork chops; marinated 2 1/2 days and we grilled them. Taking a reviewers advice we seared them on high and then finished them on indirect heat.They were so moist and tender and the marinade flavor really came through. I did not use the food coloring - thought it was pointless.

This was good and enjoyed by all in our household, including our 2 and 4 year olds. I used slightly thinner pork chops (on sale) and marinated for 3 days. I didn't use the food coloring, and I was unexpectedly out of black bean garlic sauce so I added a bit of teriyaki sauce instead.

Delicouse, easy to prepare, and healthy.

Good not great. Made exactly as written, except that I couldn't find food coloring in my grocery store. Probably wouldn't make again.

Unusual recipe and unusually tasty! A keeper! Didn't change a thing, but do us rib pork chops because they are much juicier than the loin chops we threw in for test.

Make sure you like hoisin sauce. I made this exactly as the recipe instructed, which I found simple. It was received by my guests as "just OK", but I think they were being kind. Meat was moist, but I just didn't care for the flavors.

I should have gone with my gut because I thought the ingredients seemed a bit overpowering and I was on the money. A waste of pork - I did it for 4 days, it was awful and everyone in my home was on my page. Sorry, it just didn't work for me. I'm glad I didn't make it for friends.

I marinated for 5 days and cooked them up using my george foreman grill. I did find them too salty...next time I will only marinate for 3 days. Also, I wouldn't serve this as an entree again. However, I would slice it up and use it in a stir fry, noodle dish, soup, etc.

I have made this dish several times since I first tried. I usually start marinating it on the weekend for a midweek meal. Delicious!

This is a new "company" dish. Unexpected guests gave me 48 hours notice (recipe calls for 72+ hours in the marinade) but I couldn't tell the difference. Easy to make, and was so popular that there weren't any leftovers.

Delicious recipe--marinated very thick boneless chops for almost 3 days. Next time, if again using thick chops, I would marinate them five days. Mine were delicious, but the marinate flavor could have been stronger. Also, didn't goof with the oven's broiler--seared the chops on each side on high a few minutes on the gas grill, and then cooked them on low over indirect heat until they were done. Had these with "Champ" (green onion mashed potatoes), "Marinated Vegetable Salad", and "Strawberries with Chocolate Caramel Sauce" (over dulce de leche ice cream), all from this site. It was really an Epicurious meal to remember for Hubby's Father's Day this year. I truly thank all the people who make this site happen! Thank You, Epicurious, for all the wonderful recipes!!!

I use tenderloins and no dye and I make a lot; roast all in the oven in the winter or BBQ in the summer and keep the left over for fried rice and awesome sandwiches. This is akin to BBQ chinese pork or duck.

This is a winner. 3 days marinating; thick boneless chops and broiled. Skip the food coloring...Served with the spiced applesauce in the magazine plus baby bok choy steamed with a touch of sesame oil and organic tamari.

Really moist and delicious. Broiled chops first time and they were good, even better second time when grilled.

Very tasty and simple to make. I marinated the pork for 4 days and found the meat to be a bit too salty for my liking. I'll try this again but will marinate the chops for 3 days next time.

Great dish and beautiful too. Marinated it for 4 days and we grilled the chops instead of broiling. They were very flavorful and moist. I'm going to use the marinade for chicken and salmon next time (but marinate for less time).

this was wonderful on easter dinner on the green egg (grilled). Very flavorful and the garlic and ginger offered good bursts of flavor! Looked beautiful as well.

This pork was sooooo tender! I only marinated it for 2 days! everyone has to try this one!

Great recipe - so easy (other than patience!). Lots of flavour, and pork didn't dry out. Would definitely make again.

This is the part where I totally change the recipe and still rate it! I had a four pound pork shoulder so I marinated that instead for FOUR days! I took a clue from the other (inferior) hoisin slow-roasted pork shoulder recipe and browned the shoulder in some oil in a dutch oven, then dumped the marinade on top, added 1/4 cup Jack Daniels whiskey for good measure and roasted it for 3 hours at 300 degrees. I shredded it and topped it with the sauce and it was a BIG HIT!

Excellent!! We loved this recipe, I used center loin cuts of pork and extra ginger and garlic, bbqueing in the rain and it was still wonderful. This is a keeper to my growing Epicurious recipe box!

this sounds delicious and pretty easy to do. to the cook in AZ - look for the black bean sauce in the international foods section of your grocery with all the other stir fry sauces, hoisin sauce, oyster sauce, etc. mine's in a jar - may just say 'spicy' instead of 'garlic'.

This recipe is only char siu, the red pork used in many Chinese dishes. I make a batch of it with pork tenderloin and freeze some for future occassions. Not sure I would like it as a dinner entree.

I make this recipe already with skin on chicken breasts (and a few more ingredients). People always ask for the recipe!

Based on the reviews I'm anxious to try this, though I'm not sure where to find black bean garlic sauce. Any substitutions?

This recipe was awesome! Perfectly safe to eat after 5 days. I'm tempted to try this marinade with a whole chicken too. I'll marinate that for probably 3 days.

This was great. I also used the marinade (though not as long) for salmon and then put that on the grill. Yummy!

My whole family absolutely loved this recipe. I've made it twice and both times it was a big hit. I marianted the pork chops for the 3 days. I was a little worried about keeping the pork in the fridge for longer than that. I made my own version of vegetable fried rice to go with it. It was a great meal!

Not sure what all of the hype is regarding a 3-day marinade. We made it, ate it, LOVED it and are all still alive. Please try it BBQed! Enjoy

This was yummy. Marinated the chops for 3 days. Next time I'd like to go longer to get that ring around the meat that looks like a smoke ring in smooked brisket. I used bone-in chops that were 1 and 3/4" thick. They were hard to find but so worth it. Next time I'll probably use thick cut boneless chops because they are easier to find. Great dish to make ahead, beacaue all you have to do is broil.

These were outstanding. I marinated for 4 days and am still alive to tell about it. Chops on the bone were juicy and flavorful, but next time might use thick boneless ones because they are easier to find. This is a great dish to make ahead.

I used 1" rib chops and marinated for four days and the result was excellent. Rib chops are less lean than the more common loin chops and are therefore more moist. Note: In spite of the rants in a previous review, this recipe is perfectly safe assuming you start with fresh meat that hasn't been sitting around the meat department or your refrigerator for days. The vinegar and salt in the condiments used in the marinade ensure that the bacteria level won't get out of hand over the stated marinating times. If you cook the meat to 145°F as directed and let it rest tented, the carryover cooking will take it over 150°F--a safe temp for pork. Also, the interior of the meat is naturally sterile; the only bacteria concerns are on the surface which, under a broiler, reaches temperatures high enough to ensure any bacteria is killed.

I used chops that were 1" thick - thinner than the recipe calls for. Kept them in the coldest drawer of the refrigerator at 1 deg C while marinading for 5 days. They were tasty and tender, but slightly dry. Next time I'll buy thicker chops. And everyone feels fine, thank you.

This recipe is a farce. Marinate fresh meat for 5 days? Yes you can get food poisoning. I tried this recipe. Knew after one bite it was truly inedible and most likely dangerous. I would reccomend epicurious consider a retraction.
