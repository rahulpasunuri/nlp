I discovered my butcher sells beef tenderloin tails at a significant discount to the tenderloin (like $12.99 vs. $20.99). So I ask, and the butcher cut me a tail to cook quick, hot and only to rare. Much better than tri-tip. I don't like store bought noodles for stroganoff because it doesn't grab and hold the sauce. The bread didn't seem right, so I made spaetzle.

Great recipe and super easy. I followed recipe for my first time through, with the exception of using beef tenderloin versus tri-tip. Next time I'll just use sour cream or cream cream frache' not both just to ease the grocery cost. And we did just combine the beef and mushroom mixture. I think the bread with tomato paste was nice, but not necessary. The meat mushroom mixture is great on it's own. I most likely will just serve with a great crispy bread and salad next time.

This was actually a PAIN IN THE BUTT to make, and my kitchen was a disaster afteward, but everyone loved it. Too afraid of the mess for a do-over anytime soon, but it was delicious.

Does the recipe really call for 11 1/2 pounds of meat or should it be 1 1/2 pounds?

This was a wonderful recipe. I have never made Stroganoff before but I don't see myself ever using a different recipe. The only thing that I would add is that the actual cook time from start to eat was 45min. Awesome, Awesome, Awesome

The best strog I've had. I only had plain button mushrooms, which did the trick. Really yummy sauce. I used grass fed tri tip...very tasty, but I might splash out on tenderloin next time. Will defo make this again.

Probably if I followed the recipe it would be 4 forks... I omitted the butter and used all olive oil, omitted the cream and used soy milk, used white mushrooms, and used light sour cream. Was still very good and more to our everyday tastes. For an occasion or company might go with the full blown version. A little baffled by some of the other comments. We use tritip a lot, buy the chubs at a big box store and freeze in gallon ziplocks. We also do that with filet. We like both because of the very nearly zero waste. Not sure what that commenter got, but if it had a lot of waste it wasn't a typical tritip. In most cases I have no trimmings at all. Contrasting this to a chub of boneless ribeye where there are typically 20-30% trimmings. I think tritip at half the cost of filet and near zero waste is about the most economical steak cut you can find. Tritip and tenderness: Well, it is certainly a more robust cut than filet, but we find them nearly always suitably tender... if you don't overcook, cut crosswise, and enjoy the robustness. If you try treat it like a stew meat or traditional roast it is not so good... tough and dry. We grill the roast cut, marinated or not, 20-22 minutes a side (to 140 F), use it cubed in a pan fry or shish kebab, flash fry it (like this recipe) in chinese stir fry's and find it to be remarkably good. but the key is to cook it just done, up to medium well I think, if you like, and no more. In any event, opinions will differ, but we enjoyed the recipe and we enjoy tritip.

I have made Beef Stroganoff in the past using the NY Times Cookbook recipe, and found it to be a bit dull. What I like about this recipe: briefly browning the meat (I used top sirloin, which happened to be on sale) made it much more flavorful and tender; cooking the mushrooms separate from the beef meant that I could serve plenty of mushrooms to the mushroom lovers, and just the tasty meat to the mushroom-hating teenager! I did not make the sourdough toasts; I served the sauced beef over buttered noodles, and topped with the mushrooms. My family really enjoyed the meal. This is a much tastier version of Beef Stroganoff than I have ever made, and will definitely make it again.

This recipe was very good, very popular, and I will make it again -- for special occasions. The trouble is, tri-tip is far more expensive than buying a whole tenderloin, and since none of the tenderloin goes to waste, far from being an economical recipe, this is relatively costly. Also, maybe I'm lazy, but I thought it was more work than seemed justified by the results. This is relegated to company meals, available only by request.

Excellent! I made with ground turkey. Took it to a potluck, and got a good bit of compliments.

Used buffalo steak rather than tri-tip roast, otherwise followed recipe exactly with homemade sourdough. The sourdough and tomato paste really add depth to this recipe and I would absolutely recommend using it rather than just egg noodles.

The sauce was to die for. I didn't need to use sour cream. For some reason I had creme fraiche in my refigerator. I'm giving this a three because I will never use tri-tip again. It was so tough. Next time tenderloin for sure!

This was good! I used (a half) leftover london broil which had already been grilled med-rare and sliced it thin. I also used regular white mushrooms and onion instead of fancy mushrooms or shallots. Otherwise, I stuck to the recipe and cut it back to 4 servings instead of 6. The sourdough bread worked well with it. A small side of spaghetti tossed with butter and parmesan went well with it also. It took lots of steps and I had lots of clean-up, but it was worth the effort.

This was really good, I would definetly make it again. I used Heavy cream in both places and no sour cream. I used seitan in place of the beef and just sauteed it in the shallot mix for a little while. I also served over pasta and not on bread.

I also used sour cream and heavy cream mixture to give a more creme fraiche flavor, also i toasted the paprika and added lemon zezt to taste at the end for a little acidic punch at the end, otherwise it's a solid and easy recipe i love the sourdough idea way better than noodles.

I deviated from the recipe and did a more traditional preparation with pasta. I doubled the sauce portion, but not the meat and mushroom portions. I used 1/2 Shitake and 1/2 Baby Portobellas for the mushroom mix, and at the end instead of adding 1/2 cup sour cream (remember I doubled the sauce amounts) to the beef broth and shallot mix, I added 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup whipping cream...that definitely softened the sour cream taste. And finally since I was doing pasta not the sourdough I mixed the mushroom mix and the beef mix into a more traditional Stroganoff sauce. I did end up thickening it just a little bit with another tablespoon or so of flour. Went over bow tie pasta...why not :) It came out very tasty; my wife, who doesn't really like Stroganoff or mushrooms, says "It was really good!"

Enjoyed it and easy to put together. Used regular paprika, maybe that was why it didn't have enough kick. Felt like it needed a little more flavor to it.

Great recipe, although I didn't like the sour cream added at the end.

Delicious! I made this gluten free for my family by omitting the flour and serving over Tinkyada brown rice pasta. Approval all around!
