YUM! I use this recipe over and over again! I make this ahead of time and put it in the fridge to cool. Then I start with a dollop of berry sorbet in a wine glass, add assorted berries and the ladle the zabaglione on top. Top with a dollop of whipped cream and a roll cookie and you have a very elegant dessert!

this looks quick and wonderful. Is it served warm or can it be ade in advance and kept cool?

This is a wonderful recipe. Try it--practice it--add it to you permanent set. (Remember, this recipe costs less than $1, so try it on a weeknight so that you are ready for your next dinner party.) We had a Christmas dinner on a 8 hour notice and I used this with a store bought panettone. It was a huge hit.

An absolutely fantastic and incredibly simple recipe. I layered it in glasses alternating with berries, parfait style, and it was a hit. Everyone who tasted it was blown away. I'll definitely make it again!

This was so easy that my sister and I made it while juggling an 8-month-old and a 17-month-old, without even referring to the recipe again once we'd read it! And so delicious, and elegant... Also, a great choice for me because I needed a special dairy-free Easter dessert. We served it over strawberries, with purchased delicate wafer cookies on the side... and drank the rest of the Moscato d'Asti!

Most recipes tell you to use a hand whisk, however, the electric mixer mentioned in this recipe made a great zabaglione in 1/2 the time. I served this with rasberries. wonderful! Some may want to cut the sugar by 1/3 for a more adult sweetness.

On a whim, I tried making it with a egg substitute. I had to adjust the sugar and wine. I used a Multiquick with the whisk attachment. When I was whisking it, I only heated the corner of the saucepan and alternated it on and off the heat. It turned out beautifully.

I haven't made this particular recipe, however I use the same techniques and ingredients and have to admit, it is absolutely divine. I have also been guilty of varying the liquor and flavoring sometimes even going as far using brandy extract when non-alcholics are my guests. The electric handmixer makes life so much easier.
