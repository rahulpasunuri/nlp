I was looking for something I could make without buttermilk, and quickly, so this looked perfect. The flavor was Ok, but the cakes were too dense and a bit gritty, though I did use yellow corn meal. Maybe if I'd let it sit for awhile it would've softened the cornmeal a bit and they would've been tender, but this is probably the least favorite corn cake recipe I have made in a long time.

This is my favorite corn cake recipe. It has a really good corn taste, and it's easy and fast.

i halved the recipe (using stoneground yellow cornmeal and a really little egg) and served with maple syrup and fresh peaches. a delicious and easy breakfast! cakes have nice, mild corn taste, would be lovely with a variety of toppings.
