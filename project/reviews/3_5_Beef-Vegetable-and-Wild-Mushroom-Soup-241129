Overall this is a great recipe! I agree with other reviewers that the soup doesn't taste very good the first day--I felt that the acidity in the tomatoes was a little too overwhelming. For whatever reason it tastes 100% better after sitting overnight and skimming the fat off the top. And there's a lot of fat to skim off! Next time I make it I'll let it sit overnight for sure. I'll also make a few changes: 1) I'll use less olive oil, it will taste just as good with about 2 Tablespoons instead of 1/4 cup; 2) I'll use only 1 or 1.5 cans of tomatoes instead of 2; 3) I'll cut the meat into slightly smaller cubes 1" is too big; 4) I'll substitute 1 russet potato for the parsnip; 5) I might add in 1 cup of fresh cut green beans.

This was an outstanding soup. I followed it how it is written except that I substituted a 1/2 lb. osso buco for the shank, and used fresh cremini and shiitake mushrooms. Seriously delicious!

Rich beef flavor! I used only 1/2 the amount of tomatoes, about twice the dried wild mushrooms (which I reconsituted first), and a couple of cloves of garlic. Really good! Also, used a package of mixed wild mushrooms, which enhanced the taste. In terms of fattiness, I first trimmed the bone of some of the fat, and only used a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. Glad I did.

This is a great recipe. I made a few tweaks of my own...as I always do. I added crushed garlic, sweet basil, potatoes, 2 serrano peppers, shitake mushrooms and substituted sweet italian sausage for the beef flank. This turned out to be a nice flavorful soup on a cold and rainy day.

It's snowing and sleeting outside. Perfect day for this soup. I used beef oxtail instead of the shank: more flavor, less fat. I also used very little olive oil. The result: not fatty at all!

Delicious! Perfect for the cold weather. I didn't add mushrooms nor parsnips, and I added only 1 can of diced tomatoes. The soup had more than enough vegetables. I also used lo sodium chicken broth because I didn't have beef broth available.

I changed the parsnips for zucchini and was delighted. It is perfect for a cool night at home.

Like others said, it has potential. First, simmer the porcini in the beefstock for a while and then strain the mixture. Second, add sub a cup or two of the broth with a good red wine. Also let the soup sit for a day or two.

Not the best I've ever made. I thought it was a little bland and could have used more veggies as it was 'thin'. I reconstituted the mushrooms before adding to the soup and strained the liquid to remove sediment. The meat was so tender and moist the big bonus!

Most soups benefit from being prepared a day ahead, and as others have said, this allows you to skim the fat off the top for much healthier eating.

We loved it.

Great soup recipe and the kids loved it too! Don't exclude the soup bones! Refridgerate the soup and skim off the hardened fat that surfaces

Fantastic soup, a big hit for a luncheon. Our local supermarket only had 1 package of porcini, so we used a mixed bag and cut in some Portobellas (We were doubling the recipe). I would agree that the oil may be too much, we used the 1/4 cup in a doubled batch and it was still more than it needed. My wife also liked the taste before adding the tomatoes so we only added half what was called for. Still wonderful.

This soup has potential. Next time I will not use the beef shank, while I know it adds flavor, I did not like how fatty the soup ended up. Will increase the stew meat by 3/4 lb. Will also increase the celery, carrots and mushrooms (maybe not all porcinis; perhaps shitake). We also added tabasco sauce, which greatly enhanced the flavor.

I thought this recipe had good flavor. However, will tweek the next time. I will not use the beef bone shank next time. Am sure it does add some flavor, but is not worth how fatty it made the soup. Would increase the celery, carrots and mushrooms (maybe not all porcini, perhaps shitake). We added tabasco to our bowls when we ate this and it greatly enhanced the flavor.

If by "earthy" you mean gritty from the dried porcinis then yes - it's definitely earthy. I reduced 1 c of pinot noir to 1/2 c and added it with the beef broth which was very good. The flavor of this soup is great, I think next time though I'm going to reconstitute the mushrooms first and then add them with some of the water and leave the rest of the sediment behind. I also cut the amt of olive oil by half - no need for all the oil when there is plenty of fat from the beef and shank bone. Definitely a good one for a chilly winter's day (with a few changes)...

I make many soups,this soup is at the top of my list. The aroma throughout the house when cooking is delicious.

Wow! I'm the first to rate this great recipe. I've made lots of similar soups, and this recipe is a winner. I added other wild mushrooms to the porcini, one fennel bulb, and a little cayenne, but otherwise followed the recipe. Perfect for a cold wintry New England day.
