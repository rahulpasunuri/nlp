I really like the whole combination of scallops, leeks, cumin and cauliflower, and I use light cream or milk so I can taste them all. Mates wonderfully with herby roasted dishes. Simple enough to finish up when company arrives. Always a pleasure to make, except for "patting dry" those scallops and leeks.

Scallops and cumin flavor was great - cauliflower added nothing, some other vegetable may be a better choice. Sauce was too thin - add less water and really dry the scallops well. We served this over couscous, which was a good fit.

Dry roast the cummin seeds until they pop, then put them in a pestle and mortar and crush them to give a more defined flavour
