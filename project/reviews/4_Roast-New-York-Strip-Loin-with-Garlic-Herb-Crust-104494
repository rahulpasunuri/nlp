This is an update to my 1st review. The recipe was perfect except for the cook time as a lot of reviews have stated. I also had to cook longer than the original recipe called for. I had a 5.5 lb. beef and I had to cook about 1 hour and 15 minuets to reach 140 degrees after the 15 minute searing. It seems the cook time is 15 - 20 minuets per pound as I have found on other sites.

This turned out to be the best beef I have ever had at home. I recommend this for everyone that is a novice at cooking. This year, my wife and I wanted to have something different for our Christmas dinner as we always have had ham. We decided to have roast beef and I got involved in the process after talking to a friend of mine about cooking. I have never cooked a beef roast from scratch and this turned out terrific. I was very proud as a novice cook.

This was a fabulous Christmas Dinner. I made this with a 14.5# boneless ribeye roast. I made a double recipe of the garlic paste using only half the salt. I rubbed it on both sides of the roast the day before. I brought the roast out of the fridge and let it sit at room temp for 2.5 hours before cooking. I seared it in the oven at 450 for 25 minutes and then lowered heat to 325 and cooked for another 2 hours till the internal temp was 133. The meat was perfectly pink and juicy, just like the picture above. So simple and so delicious. Great way to make a fabulous meal. I served 19 and could have easily served 25. I also made a cabernet pan gravy with the drippings. This will be Christmas dinner next year too.

Made this on Christmas Day. It is an easy no-fuss recipe with wonderful results. Cut back on the salt and roasted to 126 degrees and let the meat rest. Roast was a perfect medium rare. Took longer to cook than directions state. This will be my new "go to" holiday roast!

Absolutely delicious !!! I followed the suggestion of making a larger cut, and upped the herb rub to 1 1/2 but kept the salt at 4 tsp. I increased the time at 450 degrees to 25 minutes, and the cooking time at 350 degrees to 40 minutes....let sit for 20 minutes covered in foil....turned out just right...will definitely make it again !

Rave reviews from all on Christmas evening. 8 pound roast, doubled recipe except kept salt the same and used some rosemary to make up for the fact that when I doubled the recipe I did not have enough Thyme. Put the rub on the day before so about 26 hours before I cooked it. Roast sat at room temperature for about 3 to 4 hours before cooking. Time needed for medium rare was 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for, and the meat came out on the rare side which was fine as I'd rather it be rare than medium. Good meat should not be over cooked. Would make again.

Delicious, easy, will make again. Followed recipe exactly. Used suggestion to increase the size of the roast to allow for leftovers which also increases the estimated cooking time.

Excellent roast I served for Christmas...BUT...the listed roasting times I found were not accurate...I needed an extra 45 min. added on to the time listed for medium and it still came out more medium rare...my oven thermometer I believe to be accurate so not sure what the problem was.

This roast has become a Christmas Eve family tradition. I also use an 8 lb roast. The only problem is cooking time. I really struggle to get the cooking time correct. I even bought a professional grade meat thermometer and had trouble getting the temperature right. As said below, the cooking time in the recipe is way off unless you want really rare meat. In the future I will plan on at least two hours after searing for medium rare in middle/ medium at ends.

After making this 4 years ago for Christmas/Chanukah, it has become a tradition. We love it. I do have to say as others that it does take longer to cook. 40 minutes would make it rare and bloody. I can't stand the snob who insinuates that the meat is ruined if cooked longer or that we don't know enough to take it out and cook at room temperature. I ate lamb at a restaurant with a friend who ate it so bloody I almost couldn't have a conversation with her. She was sick all night and I, who had mine a perfect medium, (and cooked to a SAFE temperature) had a fun night!!

There isn't many times one sees a recipe with consistent high reviews, and this one did not disappoint. An amazing recipe for a fine cut of meat. Followed the recipe to a "T" with a 4/lb roast and it was perfect (like cutting into butter). It is nice having it on the cutting board asking guests, "How thick would you like your steak?" The only thing I had to do was extend the cooking time to almost an hour to get to 130 degrees - a minor inconvenience (and it could be my oven).

This was the first time I had ever made a New York strip loin. Used this recipe for Christmas dinner and it was awesome! I had an 11 pound roast for 11 people, which gave me plenty of leftovers. I followed the directions exactly. I took it out when the internal temp was 130. It ended up sitting for 1-1/2 hours, my sides took longer than planned. However, it ended up looking exactly like the photo, perfectly pink. I ended up doubling the recipe twice. The first batch was much, much too salty. In the future I would probably use half the salt called for. I mixed a second double batch and combined it with the first, this was perfect.

Beautiful. Simply marvelous. I've made this roast a few times now and just today, for Christmas Eve Dinner. We didn't have any thyme so rosemary from the garden just had to do - wonderful! Have used Choice and regular New York Loin ($10 per pound vs $4.50) and felt that either cut does just fine (the more expensive cut having quite a bit more marbling). Very little leftovers for tomorrow - that is my only regret. DO ALLOW FOR EXTRA TIME - not sure if it is my oven, but the cooking time just wasn't long enough - took an extra 15 minutes at least - but then perfectly medium rare.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. The flavor was great and the beef turned out just perfectly! I followed the cooking instructions in the Best Recipe cookbook, as that is my go-to for preparation techniques and it had me cook at 250 until the internal temperature read 110, then turn the oven to 500 until the internal temp reached 130. Take it out and tent it for 15 minutes or until it reaches 145 and it was perfectly medium rare. Great for a dinner party and the meat was not that expensive.

Excellent! I sliced thinly for steak sandwiches to celebrate my daughters 22nd birthday. Rave reviews from our 12 guests, all asking for the recipe. Toasted ciabatta rolls with grilled onions and a simple horseradish sauce made for a mouth watering delight. Our Au jus was constructed form beef bouillon paste simmered in in two cups of water with onion, thyme, and celery was delicious.

Made this for NY eve, and though the meat was room temp, it did take longer in my oven. Did it to 138 and served it at a gorgeous medium. Started garlic mashed at 110 degrees, broccolini when the roast came out. This is easy enough for a newer cook, just be sure to use a meat thermometer and you will be fine. I will never do another tenderloin!!! This was more flavorful and half the price!

Made a whopping 14 pounder for Xmas Day dinner for 22 guests. It was delicious. I suggest starting it at 500 for 15 minutes and then turning it down to 325 for the remainder of time. It was perfect. All the comments on how the roast takes longer than the recipe says tells me people like it over cooked or they are not getting the roast out of the fridge to warm up early enough.

I was totally nervous to make my first real roast for Christmas - so this one seemed do-able and fail-proof (if you watch your meat thermometer)! This recipe is totally easy and turned out well.

Boy, was this good! I made it for Christmas dinner, and there was literally five minutes of silence (very unusual!) while everyone chowed down. It took much longer than the time in the recipe - about 2 hours for medium rare. I did have two 5-pounds roasts, so that may have increased the time. This cut of beef is amazingly tender, and the rub was really delicious.

AWESOME recipe! I cooked this for Christmas dinner and everyone raved about it. I cooked a 9 lb roast for 14 adults with no leftovers! The meat was that delicious! I followed the recipe exact (doubling), except I seared the meat on my griddle on all sides first. Then I put it in a 350 oven until it got to 135 degrees. It took about an hour and 15 minutes all together. It turned out to be cooked perfectly medium. The meat was juicy, tender and very tasty. I'll be making this again very soon!

This recipe was FANTASTIC! I made this for a Christmas dinner with 13 people (ironically). Everyone raved about how good it was. It took a little longer to cook, but I had a much bigger cut of meat. This will make a repeat performance at other dinner parties for sure! Also, I put half sage and half rosemary in the herb rub. Still delicious!

Absolutely delicious! The butcher didn't get my order right, so I ended up with a roast with the bones still intact, but cut through so that I would have 10 steaks when serving. I doubled all rub ingredients, but only used 4 teaspoons total of salt, and marinated overnight. The roast sat at room temperature for about 2-1/2 hours before I roasted it. Oven time was 2 hours for medium-rare, the end pieces came out medium, which was great for the non-medium- rare eaters.

I am late in reviewing but we made this for over 20 people during the holidays and it was amazing. I had trouble figuring out how to fit 2 roasts in the oven but settled on one large heavy cooking sheet on a drying rack. I thought they would take much longer than called for but checked on them 10 minutes after original time and they were both done. Let rest, and perfection. I followed the recipe pretty much exactly and must say I will again. The NY roast was pricy but EVERYONE raved... It was like having a steak house steak. I will make this again.

Substituted rosemary for sage. The garlic herb crust was a very flavorful addition to this wonderful roast. Following the time the recipe dictated, I was surprised that the roast was done so quickly. It came out very bloody, and very delicious. Paired this with yorkshire puddings.

Rating: 3
Great recipe as long as you ignore the temperature and cook it at no more than 250F after the initial searing. To end up with a uniform pink colour (like the picture looks like) it would probably need to be cooked even lower, at 200F to 225F for several hours. I could be wrong  Ive never tried cooking large pieces of beef at very high temperatures like 350F. Also, searing on the stovetop is an alternative to starting the oven at 450F.

This roast was unbelievably delicious. I had expected the cut to be tender, but I had no idea how wonderful the flavor would be. I made a 7 lb roast for 12 for Christmas dinner and everyone went crazy for it. There were no leftovers. Use a thermometer and don't cook it past medium rare. This recipe is a winner!

I must tell you, many a roast beef recipe have I made - and this was bar-none the best. I made this Christmas Eve for new guest and everyone kept coming back for more. Served it with a mushroom/merlot sauce over the top and it was a beautiful presentation. there is just nothing else to say - wouldn't change a thing!

Rarely have I had a chorus of raves - and loud ones - for a roast of beef, but this recipe is simply superb, worthy of the chorus of "awesome!'from around the table. I had the strip loin roast and went online to find a recipe to roast it perfectly - and found this. I didn't have a drop of oil of any kind in my kitchen, so used clarified butter instead (the only substitution). It is utter heaven to smell while roasting, even better when enjoying with enthusiastic guests who consumed the entire roast, plus the jus that accompanied it - pan juices with the addition of port wine, simmered and lightly thickened. Sweet perfection. Definitely a 4 fork+ recipe!!

I made this last night for Xmas Eve. Everyone loved it. Simple to make. Got the beef loin from Sam's Club. They cut it special for me with no problem. $30.00 for a five pound roast. Cooked it for a total of one hour and it came out rare-med.rare. I made a madeira sauce I got from a Prime Rib recipe on Epicurious. It was also delicious. I will make this for company again!

I've never made this cut before either, my husband bought it by mistake--he was supposed to get a tenderloin. This was fabulous, the flavors were perfect. I did add some rosemary to the herb mixture. The roast cooked in just about an hour and I agree with other posters about the leftovers, the sandwiches are divine! We served this with creamed spinach and mashed potatoes.

This is just the best thing I could have done with that bison new york strip loin I had. Mine was only 1-1/2 lb so I cut all of the seasonings in half (which was still too much for the small piece of meat, which is why it was so awesome). My cut did not have 1/4" fat on the top. More like 1/8 or 1/16--just a sheath of it. I adjusted cook times for the size and it was so perfect and delicious. I've never bought this cut before in a roast rather than strips. I will do it again! I made this with the potato broccoli soup and parmesan croutons. I am still in heaven.

Holiday Winner! I ordered the New York Strip Loin cut from our Restaurant kitchen where I work, enough to feed 18+, not sure of weight but was approx. 18L x 12W. I bought a remote probe digital thermometer. Doubled recipe, except light on salt. Room temp for 3 hours prior to cooking. Cooking time was about 2.5 hrs, removed when temp was at 133 deg, covered with foil, internal temp climbed to 145 deg. after removal. Meat was perfect, tender, moist and very flavorful. Served with garlic roasted red potatoes, oven roasted mushrooms in white wine & garlic. Used mushroom liquid to make White Wine Sauce from Loin juices & Demi-Glace, as optional Meat sauce YUM!

We made this this weekend for my pseudo in laws and assorted other family. We did 1.5 the herb amount and increased olive oil to about 4 tbsp as things weren't going together that well until we added more liquid. However when that was all said and done, this was absolutely delicious. With the meat thermometer in we ended up roasting for another 20 mins longer than recipe called for, even though we were using 2 smaller pieces of tenderloin as opposed to one larger cut. However as others have mentioned was still delightful. Served with skin on mashed organic red potatoes, salt and pepper roasted green beans, and a sauce I made from the (scant) drippings, thyme, garlic, sauteed shallots, beef stock, some dark sweet cherries and the shiraz I was serving alongside. So good, will definitely be pulling this recipe out again in the future!

Spectacular. So flavorful and delicious. It did take a little longer than I expected -- about 25 minutes longer than the recipe called for for medium rare (and we had a smaller roast, too -- 3 3/4 lb). Made it exactly as written and it was perfect. I threw in some potato wedges coated in olive oil to the bottom of the roasting pan and they came out perfectly roasted along with the meat, even with the added cooking time. Will definitely make this again and again. And leftovers make amazing sandwiches with a little mayo, lettuce and cheddar. YUM!

I made this recipe for the first time when I met my new brother in law for the first time. It was such a big hit that eveytime we come over he asks my sister if the two of us are cooking dinner! I have made it several times since then and it is a big hit every time. Using the strip loin is too expensive, I use cheaper roasts, and let sit in the fridge overnight for best flavor. I cut the salt in half, as several previous tips recommended. I cook it so the outside is medium well and the inside is medium, so those who like it a little more well done are happy (my husband). the cooking time always varies, so keep an eye on it. Excellent roast with loads of great flavor!

I just made it for the second time last night and we absolutely loved it (again)! The roast was about 4-1/2 pounds and after I chilled it with the herb paste, I had it out of the fridge for 1-1/2 hours before putting it in the oven. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out exactly how we liked it (15 minutes at 450 degrees, 35 minutes at 350 degrees - medium on the ends and medium rare in the middle). The first time I made it, it was a bit too rare for some reason perhaps the meat was too cold when I put it in the oven and/or it was too big (over 5 pounds). This is really easy to make and as long as you don't overcook it, definitely impressive to serve for a special dinner.

Rating: 4
Would have been 4 Forks if it wasn't overcooked. For true medium rare, take it out of the oven at no more than 120 degrees ( I would do 110) and let it sit for a no more than 15 minutes.

This recipe is a Christmas tradition for us and has been since 2000 when it was featured in Bon Appetit magazine. The New York Strip is our favorite steak, so when we saw a recipe for a roast from our favorite cut of meat for a steak, we knew it would be good. It is wonderful served with Green Beans with Bacon & Shallots which was also featured in the same article in Dec 2000. This year we put the rub on 2 days before because that worked for our busy schedule. It was wonderful! The rub permeated the meat, but did not overwhelm the flavor of the meat. It was just perfectly seasoned.

JUST COOKED THIS FOR CHRISTMAS DINNER. GRILLED IT INDIRECT ON A WEBER CHARCOAL GRILL AT 450 DEGREES UNTIL MEAT THERMOMETER READ 130 DEGREEES. IT WAS FANTASTIC.

I've made this roast three Christmases in a row now, and no-one will let me try anything else (not that I really want to). Guests walk into the house, take a big whiff, and say "Oh, boy - THE ROAST!" For those who don't want to wade through all the reviews, many people comment on the cooking time and the amount of salt in the marinade. First, the cooking time very much relates to the size of the roast and the temperature of it when you put it in the oven. The difference between refrigerator and room temperature is huge in terms of time in the oven, so include that in your time calculation. As to the salt, it penetrates more as the meat marinates, so if you apply the marinade just before roasting, the crust will be saltier and the meat itself will have absorbed less of the flavor of the marinade. Adjust accordingly if you are inclined to make changes to the recipe, but my recommendation is to follow it. Cheers to all!

Great, easy to make roast! I did make a couple of minor changes because of what I had on hand. I used dry sage, fresh rosemary & thyme from the garden. I did not measure the seasonings (I tend to be one of those "eyeball-it cooks") but I do know that it was not as much salt as was called for. I also used an inexpensive cross rib roast - again...it was what I had on hand. The only other major change was that I just mixed the ingredients and rubbed it on the roast. I did NOT pulse it into a paste...I did not feel like taking the time to clean up the blender!

I have made this dish for Christmas dinner for several years in a row. I make it for a lot of people so the cut has cost me up to $150, but well worth it. There are never any leftovers. It's also easy. I use a meat thermometer to achieve just the perfect temperature.

Made this for Christmas Eve last night. It was delicious. Thanks to all you wonderful reviewers I doubled the herb paste and used half the salt, and it was great. My only complaint comes as an inexperienced roaster. I took the roast out at 138 degrees but by the time it sat 20 minutes it was all medium and gray. Still delicious but not what I had hoped for. I will try it again someday. Next time I will take out at 130.

What a delicious roast! I substituted fresh oregano for the sage (to mesh better with other items I was serving), but that was the only change I made. The cooking time was spot on. (My roast was 4.5 pounds, brought to room temperature before cooking.) My guests positively raved -- both about the flavor of the rub and the tenderness of the dry-aged, grass-fed meat. This is truly a special roast -- but one you'll want to enjoy frequently!

This is a terrific recipe and easy, easy. It has been my Christmas dinner for three years and gets raves every time I serve it. It truly must be a special occasion, however, because this cut of meat is very pricey--typically $10 - $14 per pound.

This was an awesome receipe, easy and tasty. Make sure you marinate it over night for full flavor. Just as the past reviews I also cut back on the salt and used 3 tpsns. I cooked a 15 pound for over 30 people and purchased the meat at Costco for $70.00. Well worth the money next time I will try it with other types of meat.

A show-stopping, impress-your-guests dinner! Easy to make, so you don't have to be slaving away when people arrive, either. Like many other reviewers, I reduced the salt somewhat, and needed to cook the roast a little longer. I would also agree that the quality of the meat does make a big difference. Enjoy!

Very tasty - adds a nice subtle herbed flavor. I made with prime rib but have decided that I personally like the taste of prime rib better seasoned with just garlic salt and onion salt. SO, next time I will make with the new york strip loin roast. I did halve the salt.

Rating: 4
Second time making this for a Holiday: Be sure to REDUCE the salt amount (I used 1+ teaspoons)!! The cost of the strip-loin is reflected in the taste and texture of the meat. Although I think it would be good, tenderloin just does not match up in flavor. A keeper recipe; it just doesn't get easier than this.

I cooked this last night for our family's Christmas Eve dinner using a 4.5-lb. prime rib roast. I also wasn't able to marinate it beforehand, but it still turned out very nicely and everyone cleaned their plates. (I did reduce the amount of salt to 3 teaspoons and would reduce it to 2 next time.) It was embarrassingly easy to prepare, and the wonderful smells filled the house during our Christmas Eve cocktail hour. I am looking forward to making this roast again when it can be properly marinated, as I am sure that it would greatly improve what was already excellent. NOTE: The cooking time IS ACCURATE, despite what other cooks have said. Every cook who complained used a larger roast, so of course the cooking time has to be 2-1/2 hours for a roast that weighs nearly 11 pounds! As the recipe directed, we cooked ours to 140 degrees and let it stand for 20 minutes before slicing, and it was PERFECT. Just adjust your cooking time to the size of your roast. Happy eating!

Rating: 4
This is a new favorite in our house. It's extremely easy to prepare, which made it perfect for our dinner party, and tastes excellent. The herb crust is amazing, might decrease the salt slightly next time, and would be good on other types of meat as well. We let it cook a little longer, to about 150 degrees and it was perfectly medium. It won rave reviews from guests. We'll definitely make again, the meat was a bit pricey ($11.59/lb. for Angus Strip Steak) but worth it for a special occasion.

Rating: 4
excellent dish!!! i doubled the garlic, and let it marinate for about 6 hours. i also added more juice by drizzling the loin with white wine every 15 minutes or so. a great do ahead too...just cook it to really med rare and take it out of the oven. put foil on top of roast and it will continue to cook. once guests come, reheat for about 15 min and then slice. do not slice before hand, otherwise the juices will escape.

I made this recipe using a top round roast, $3.69/lb. I saw the NY strip loin - $9.99/lb! I had to make 2 batches of the garlic - herb paste, as one wasn't enough to cover the roast. Even two didn't completely cover it. I was confused as to whether completely covering it was the goal. I halved the amount of salt, and it was plenty flavorful. My family and guests agreed that using the amount of salt called for in the recipe would have been way too much. The roast looked great, and tasted wonderful. You definitely have to cook it longer. And on my instant read thermometer, at 130 degrees the meat was actually rare, not medium rare.

Excellent !! I wouldn't change a thing. I doubled the seasoning as I had an 8 lb. loin. Let it cook all day,baisting every now and then. It was the hit of the party.

I have made this recipe on special occassions over the past three years. My friends have approached me three years later to remind me how wonderful this piece of meat really is. I consider myself a harsh critic of food and strongly disagree with the last critic who said the meat is not worth the money. This cannot be compared to a beef tenderloin and is by far the single, best meat dish I have ever had.

Rating: 1
I printed out everyone's comments, read them thoroughly and was convinced this was going to be the most fabulous meal. WRONG. Don't waste your money on this cut of beef. The garlic-herb crust was lovely but next time I'd use it on a whole beef tenderloin.

Excellent dish! I used twice the rub for a 5.5lb roast. It took a REALLY long time to cook - do not pay any attention to what the recipe says! I must admit it is even better cold as leftovers than hot out of the oven! I served it with twice-baked goat cheese potatoes (See epicurious recipe) and the meal was a huge Mother's Day hit!

This dish is a family favorite. I have made it for Christmas dinner and served it at many dinner parties. It is very easy to prepare and makes an impressive presentation. It does take a bit longer to cook than the recipe indicates, even for rare meat. I serve it with roasted asparagas and simple mashed potatoes with sour cream, cream cheese and butter.

I made this for christmas dinner and I'd definitely make it again. I think it would be tastier on a smaller roast than what I cooked. The roast was a little over 5 lbs and I think I'd be happier with the results if it had been a 3 - 4 lb roast.

Rating: 3
Definitely a solid entree for Christmas Eve dinner. As previous reviewers had suggested, I probably will double the garlic rub next time and the meat took slightly longer to cook than the recommended time allotment.

Rating: 2
Everyone loved it but me. The reviews made me have much higher expectations. My husband loved the rub so much that we made it last night with extra olive oil and diced tomatoed and tossed it with pasta. Yum. The meat took MUCH longer to cook and I was dissapointed, but I would make it again with twice the rub.

Not sure what else I can add other than one more review saying this is an outstanding recipe. We quadrupled the amount of garlic and marinated overnight - out of this world. Elegant and easy, but we found it needed to cook a little longer than stated (for med-rare).

The marinade for this recipe is delicious! I made it the day before and allowed the meat to absorb the flavors for 24 hours. I used a boneless rib-eye roast and cooked it according to the directions for medium rare. To have it reach medium rare would require more than than the time indicated in the recipe. My guests were all fans of very rare and medium rare meat so they were happy. Next time I will bring the meat to room temperature before roasting and perhaps the time indicated will yield the medium rare results that I am looking to achieve.

Followed the recipe and it looked EXACTLY like the photos! Tasted even better! Buy Choice grade beef or better for maximum flavor and tenderness but even supermarket grade is delicious. Cooked more than medium is a waste, however, unless Choice+. Too dry and chewy.

I thought this was wonderful- I guess I got really lucky as well, the 4lb roast the butcher cut and trimed for me was on sale, 21 dollars, regularly 47 dollars. This was perfect, I was able to marinate it, clean up the mess from the roast, get my pumpkin soup and morrocan veggies ready, and pull it all together with perfect timing like a pro, and the kitchen was cleaned up by the time I was ready to put dinner on the table. Plus it was amazing, ,and is still making great snacks!

We've made this twice, and have found that the more rub, the better. We doubled the recipe, and it was an improvement over an already pretty good recipe.

The first time I made this recipe I used the NY Strip Loin and it was great. Its all in the crust folks. I cater, and I now use this recipe repeatedly with one exception...I use a whole beef tenderloin and slice it to serve on rolls as little sandwiches. My guests absolutely rave! I cook it pretty rare and its by far the best beef recipe I have ever had! Enjoy.

This was delicious! A definte keeper! I cut the salt to 3 tsps as some others suggested and it was perfect. In fact this rub would be wonderful on any other cut and pork as well. My guests loved it. Also, I got my roast at Sam's for $4.49/pound...

Yes, it's a little bit salty, takes longer to cook than the recipe indicates and is very expensive(our 6.5 lb roast was $80!)...but, boy is it good! The carnivores at the table LOVED it! I wouldn't change a thing!

Although my guests liked this roast, I was disappointed with the results. For one thing, the herb rub was much too salty. But more importantly, the cut of meat was really disappointing. I went to two well-known butchers in NYC, and both said they didn't sell this cut as a roast, only as steaks. I never cook beef, so I wanted to follow the recipe exactly, instead of experimenting with a different cut. The second butcher agreed to do a roast-style cut for me, and I paid through the nose for the meat (nearly $20 per pound!!). But even though it came out a perfect medium-rare, the texture of the meat seemed sort of mealy or grainy -- not tough, exactly, but not succulent and buttery, as I would expect for that price. That said, the herb and garlic mixture was tasty, and I would use it again (minus half the salt). If I do ever make this recipe again, though, I will just follow the butcher's advice, and buy a cut that is normally used for a roast, and that doesn't cost so much!

Great, easy recipe; bought meat at Costco for $3.99/lb so it was especially great. Takes about an hour an half, though, not 45 min. Meat was tender but flavorful and tasty. Easier to deal with than prime rib.

I had made this recipe for Christmas last year and Mother's Day. Everyone raves. Even the kids like it (it is tender enough for them to eat). Just note that the recipes cooking time is not long enough. My lion was about 10-11lb and it took about 2 1/2 hours. I am making it again this year for Christmas by request.

I prepared the roast with the coating the night before and let it set in the refridgerator. I then roasted this on my Weber gas grill. Everyone raved and said it was the tastiest roast they had ever eaten.

I am not quite sure what the excitement is over this dish. I made it exactly as the recipe stated and found it to be nothing at all extraordinary. Four forks means " a dish beyond compare" ! Everyones four forks is exceedingly misleading. I find this frequently happens on epicurious. The only reason I gave it 2 forks instead of 1 fork is because of it being so easy and you can do it in advance. Grillling NYstrips is also easy and alot more tasty!

Tip: My butcher cut all the fat off the meat including the membrane between the fat and the meat; then tied 1/4 in of fat back onto the roast...made it even more tender than before...if that's possible.

I cook gourmet style meals all the time and this still recieved rave reviews from everyone. it was excellent! I cooked it a little bit longer than suggested (about 20 min). I agree with other reviwers it is an exspensive meal. I paid 65$ for the meat. I served 7 adults and head a small dish left over. I figure it was well worth any 20-30 meal at a fancy restaurant and it cost less than 10$ per plate. definitely worth it.

I used the New York Strip Loin and was very satisfied with the results but didn't expect the cost. I didn't see it available at the butcher so I asked and he happily cut me a 4lb roast but my jaw dropped when I saw the price sticker he applied to it. Probably worth it, but pretty shocking.

I made this for a ladies' lunch and all loved it. Two made me give the recipe immediately! I cooked it on my rotisserie (like on TV!) instead of the oven and it was fabulous!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious! The flavor of a New York Strip loin far surpasses that of a tenderloin roast. I was afraid the cut would be hard to find in this area but all I had to do was ask the butcher not to slice all of his loin into steaks but rather leave a piece whole. I was able to get the exact size that I needed. I would suggest for all those who weren't quite satisfied with their results to try this recipe again with the recommended New York Strip Loin!

I included this on my V-day menu. It was good, but not absolutely fabulous. It was hard to live up to all this praise. The butcher gave me a Sirloin Roast, I believe, and do think it would be better with just a tenderloin. It did take me longer to cook than the recipe specified, but as others said, it did cook more while resting. The thing that most surprised me is that I liked the medium/medium well ends better than the medium rare middle. The taste of the marinade seemed intensified or something.

A CAUTION on Polder and similar thermometers: I incinerated mine by using it at high temperatures. The maximum oven temp (as stated by Polder) is 390 degrees. I think that you could probably insert the thermometer after lowering the oven temperature in this recipe

Rating: 4
A fabulous and easy recipe that can be made ahead of time and takes less than 15 minutes to prepare. I've made it 3 times in various sizes but I recommend using more of the garlic herb marinade and scoring the meat to allow it to soak in while marinating in the fridge for as long as possible. Also, don't overcook as it ruins the flavor of the crust and meat! It will continue to cook while standing!

Thanks to the cooks from Sequim, Washington and New Orleans. This thermometer sounds like a worthwhile investment, much better than the electric liquor and vinegar maker and cheap at the price.

This is a GREAT recipe. The coating gives the meat a wonderful flavor. I marinated it about 6 hours. I think overnight would be even better. I ordered the thermometer previously discussed from cooking.com. Can't wait to try it. They have two models available, $24.95 and $34.95.

To de-Wolfe from N.J.....LOL, no I wouldn't even know where to begin writing a cookbook. I do keep a journal where I jot down things that worked and things that didn't. The thermometer/alarm has saved my life more than once. It's made by Polder and it's called the Cooking Thermo Timer. My son gave it to me but I think you could find it in any cookware catalogue like Williams Sonoma or Cooking.com. It has a probe about the size of an instant read thermometer attached to a wire lead that you thread outside the oven door. The other end of the lead attaches to the base which has an LCD screen with settings for present temp. and desired temp. It really helps to keep track of how the temperature is rising without having to open the oven door. The alarm is not too loud and it goes off about a minute after it reaches the set temp. Good luck.

I made this using a beef tenderloin and it was wonderful. I marinated it 12 hours and thought it was a little strong in the garlic department. Next time I will just cut it to 2 or 3 cloves and let it marinate 4 to 6 hours. Wonderful flavors and aroma.

Unbelievable! My husband and guests went crazy over this dish and it was so easy to make!

As noted by other reviewers, New York roasts are hard to find and are very expensive - so I substituted a prime rib roast and halved the cost. It worked out great! I served this to a crowd of 20 and everyone loved it. The leftovers were just as good. I've already given the recipe away and I will definitely be making it again. Only one criticism - the roast took much longer to cook than the recipe indicated, throwing the timing off for the rest of the menu.

I made this as the main course for my family on Christmas Eve. It was spectacular!!!! The meat was expensive (I had my brother-in-law, who is a butcher, get me the roast.) It was so easy to set up the night before and it impressed everyone so much, that I imagine it will become a tradition for our family every year! (My ENTIRE dinner came from Bon Appetit Magazine, as a matter of fact, and nothing was disappointing!) I highly recommend trying this recipe for any kind of a meal where you want to impress your guests!

I cooked this until my Polder thermometer reached 132 degrees. My starting temperature was 53 degrees. I must say it was a bit on the rare side for me. I would make this again and bring the temperature up to 140 as suggested for medium. I also doubled the herb crust and added a bit of brown sugar to help carmalize. I am planning to gently warm the leftovers in a wine sauce I also made -- perhaps that will cook the meat just a tad more without ruining it!

I made this dish for family on Christmas Eve to rave reviews. It is quite simple to prepare and makes a lasting impression with guests. I highly recommend the use of an instant read thermometer when cooking large cuts of meat. I bought a 7lb roast and cooked it to 132 degrees. This should have been medium rare, but the roast continues to cook while you let it rest, so it was cooked to medium. It was still delicious!
