I have NOT made this cake or the frosting but by just looking at the ingredients for the frosting I can say that it's a delicious one. I made frostings similar to this & they are divine paired with my carrot cake & my banana cake. Because there is already some sweetness to the white chocolate, try adjusting the amount of powdered sugar that you will add into it to your preferred sweetness. & to those complaining that the frosting came out too runny, try putting the frosting in a metal bowl & beat it over another bowl containing ice. This method helps thickens the frosting to your desired spreading consistency. Or after you have beat all the frosting ingredients together, store it covered in the refrigerator for about 15 to 30 minutes then beat it till it softens to your desired consistency.

Eww. Ick Ick Ick Made as written. Not pretty, not tasty. I like the idea of bumping up the box mix but this wasn't it. Not worth tweaking.

The frosting was quite runny and was difficult to handle. After chilling it in the refriderater for a while and laying the cake pieces sideways on the plate when sliced it hid the problem rather well. I think next time I would try adding more powdered surar.

I thought this cake was very moist and tasted very good. I made it for a friend's birthday dinner and everyone loved it. I doubled the amount of white chocolate and added nuts to the batter.

The muffin mix saved a little time, but if you're going to go to the trouble of adding the other ingredients, might as well make a cake from scratch. I'd use regular cream cheese frosting in the future; The white chocolate didn't add anything worth noting, just sweetened the frosting even more. The best thing about the recipe are the toasted walnuts pressed to the side of the cake, that touch I'll use again.

This cake was personally not one of my favorites. The cake part was very good, but I did not like the frosting. The frosting was really runny, and when I spread it on the sides it all fell down and clumped at the bottom. So the presentation was not that great either. However those at my house who tried did like it.
