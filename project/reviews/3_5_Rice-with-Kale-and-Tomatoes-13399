This was surprisingly simple and tasty for a quick lunch made up of stuff I needed to use up. I used 2 cloves of garlic, 2 cups of brown rice cooked in chicken broth that was left over from a few nights ago, a box of baby kale I bought last week, 4 big tomatoes that needed to be used up and about a half cup of crumbled feta cheese that needed to go. I wasn't bad. I didn't rate this recipe but I'd give it 2 1/2 forks (pretty good) for my version. Including the prep it took me about 15 minutes to make.

This is my first recipe review but the deliciousness of this one compelled me to write about it. I doubled the recipe , used brown rice cooked in chicken broth and added a pack of orange-colored cherry type tomatoes. At the end, I added feta, and I only cooked the tomatoes for 2 minutes after adding the kale and garlic. I added the chopped garlic along with the kale in the sautee and it turned out fine. I ground lemon pepper at the end because I was out of regular pepper in my grinder. It turned out both delicious and VERY flavorful!!

A good, basic and tasty recipe. This one allows for lots of personal modification. First time I made it, I cooked the rice in chicken broth for added flavor, added more garlic and kale, and used fresh Roma tomatoes instead of plum. Easy and delicious. Even the husband who doesn't like greens went back for more. Win!

I am surprised at how many positive ratings this recipe received. Very basic and pretty bland. Added more garlic, a little tabasco and it was edible, but will definitely not be on the make again list.

I gave this four forks because I am amazed at how yummy it is, considering how simple and healthy it is. It would be great with feta, I'm sure.

So simple and satisfying. I doubled it, added a Vidalia onion, a can of chick peas and some hot sauce to bulk it up as a main dish. Next time I might try adding cumin or smoked paprika.

I used diced tomatoes instead of plum (plum tomatoes are too sweet for me) and approx. 1 cup of leftover rice that had been a little overwatered, so it was mushy. i tried folding it into the mix for a few minutes to crisp it up, but it only made it more watered-down, so realizing that what i assume was the intended crispness of the dish was impossible to achieve, i threw in 1 beaten egg and some asiago cheese in an act of desparation. DELECTABLE. Do it.

Loved it, though we did change quite a bit. Making an Italian version of the Spicy Kale and Chickpea stew on this site, we sauteed shallot and garlic first, then added the tomatoes, kale, and some chicken broth. Tossed in basil, parsley, oregano, crushed red pepper, and cannelini beans. Made the rice in chicken stock, too. When served, we grated some parmesan over the top. Tasty!

My family really liked this. I added about a cup of blackeyed peas the second time I made it, and I love it that way too.

This is one of the best rice side dishes I have ever made. My boyfriend is a picky eater and a health nut and he loves this dish. I give it four forks and will definitely make it again. I may try adding tofu for a one dish meal.

I give this dish four forks b/c it tastes good AND it's good for you. I always add sliced kielbasa for a more substantial meal. This is the only way we eat kale. I don't know of another other good kale recipes that are this easy to make. A truly great easy dinner to make any day of the week!

I have made this lots of times, and even my kids will eat it. We like it with a bit of crumbled feta on top.

A yummy, simple combination, this recipe has an excellent value in taste-per-unit-effort. Thus, 4 forks. Increased garlic, served over couscous.

Definitely a very good recipe though I couldn't give it four forks as it is not "a dish beyond compare". After reading the reviews, I used brown rice as the tomoatoe would be able to work with the nutty flavour. I added a vegetable boullion cube and some butter to the rice while it cooked. I increased the garlic and added some oregano and hot pepper sauce to give the mixture a bit more flavour and a dollop of honey to cut the acidity a bit. I couldn't get kale but substituted swiss chard which was fine. My husband thought it was really good.

Four forks may seem excessive for such a straightforward recipe, but this is a dish you can make for the rest of your life. It's easy, delicious, healthy, and doesn't require any outlandish ingredients. I find that couscous is also a nice accompaniment to this dish, as are a few black olives tossed into the mix.

Thank you to the reviewers that advised doubling the recipe, which I'm glad I did. My husband and I almost finished it ourselves. I'll add beans to the leftovers for a another meal as was also suggested. I did add more garlic and some crushed red pepper at the end and it was delicious.Also I used chard as that's what I had on hand. We try to eat chard and kale often as they are verrrrry healthy! EAT YOUR GREENS!

This was our first experience with kale and we loved it. The flavor was intense and the texture was very nice. My rice took much longer to cook than the directions indicated and I had to add more liquid. After cooking it in water for the first 20 min., I added chicken broth and let it continue to cook until the rice was more tender. I think this added some really nice extra flavor. We will definitely be making this again!

Simple yet good rice dish.

This was very good. I used brown rice and Swiss chard, which is what I had on hand, instead of kale. Also used fresh tomatoes because I had them. Doubled the recipe, so there would be leftovers. It was easy and yummy, and I'll make it again.

We're just two people, but I NEVER cook just for two. We're in our late 80's, and it's easier to cook enough for more meals ahead. You use the stove or oven just once, and you're done for two or three days ahead. So double or triple ingredients and, for better health, always use BROWN rice. Just takes longer to cook -- abt. 45 min.

I'm a 15 year old girl, and can't cook all too well...but this was a piece of cake, and sooooo good!!! :) My family loved it, and my mom especially loved how healthy it was -- rice, vegis, and only a little bit of olvie oil (i used extra light). Only thing was that there wasn't enough for the three of us...it says it serves two...but i know that i could eat it all by myself, so go by that :) enjoy!!!

This dish isn't bad, but the rice is very bland.I added a bit of chopped Kalamata olives and parmesan, which helped, but not quite enough. I like lots of flavor. I plan to try making this dish again, but will add some white wine and/or chicken broth to cook the rice, rather than just water.

I made this because I had kale & was looking for something different to do with it. It's so simple that I didn't have terribly high expectations, but it was surprisingly good. I also added a bit of lemon juice, & shall again. Quick & easy enough for weeknights, but interesting and different enough to use as a side dish for guests. A definite keeper.

Tasty, easy to make dish. I think it serves 4 as a side dish; went nicely with fish

I agree with the others--this is very quick and easy. I made it with black beans, but I think sausage would be better. It needs some additional seasoning that was lacking with the beans. I thought a spritz of lemon juice would be a nice touch.

I love kale. Combining tomatoes and kale just makes it even better. I will make this again and try different twists also.

Fast, easy and yummy, this will become a regular weeknight meal for us. I sauted a couple of "fake" italian saugages in the garlic, then chopped them up when I added the kale and tomatoes.

Delicious! To make a meal, we added 3/4 c. rinsed canned black beans and it was fantastic. Also added another clove of garlic. Be sure you don't overcook the kale -- its crunchy texture is a real plus.

Very easy and quick. I used fresh tomatoes and the color and texture were great. Very fresh and flavorful, might need additional spices if vegetables were less than ideal.

To make this a full meal, I added veggie burgers, chopped up. It was wonderful!
