Very easy and nice, refreshing flavours, although I try to marinate this for at least an hour.

My husband and I loved this! We made 4 big skewers and ate two each for a very filling meal. We didn't bother with the dipping sauce (trying to eat healthy) and skipped a starchy side. We will make this several more times! Can't wait to make this when we entertain next!

I substitute fresh squeezed orange juice for the fish sauce (about 1/4 cup). I also add 1 tbsp of grated orange rind to the dipping sauce.

I don't like the fish sauce either so just omit it. The sauce taste fantastic anyway

I really want to make this recipe, but I despise fish sauce... Does anyone have a suggestion for a substitute?

This sauce is sooooo good. Perfect summer bbq meal. Had it with friends on the roof - they're still raving about it and always ask fro the recipe. I forgot to make the Dipping Sauce; dish was amazing without it but I'm going to try next time.

Wow, this was good. Hate the taste of cilantro so substituted basil and replaced siracha with korean red pepper flakes - otherwise followed recipe exactly. Was leery of the dipping sauce but it turned out to be really good and was a nice complement to the flavors. Will make this again.

Absolutely loved this recipe with minor changes: for the dipping sauce I used non-fat yogurt with a spoonful of mayo and added a squirt of sriracha and a bit more fish sauce for a little more zing. Used my electric grill for the meat and veggies (added onion) without putting on skewers. Served in grilled nan bread with the dipping sauce on top.

The beef was absolutely delicious, very tender and flavorful for only a 30 min marinade!

Excellent. Considering the ease of preparation, this recipe is really good. Added some sweet onions to the skewers, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

This is GREAT and you really only need the 30 mins of marination as the recipe calls for which is awesome for last minute dinners. I buy both sirloin and ribeye so there is a mix of tender and regular beef on the plates. I also skip the grilling and instead broil these guys for a couple minutes each side. Everybody raves about both the sauce and the meat.

Sorry you didn't enjoy this as it is just delicious. My family loves this recipe and I make it often.

To be honest, all I can say is 'Yuck'. Maybe I am missing something? I can not understand why this recipe is rated 4 forks. I have eaten in several of JGV's restaurants and was very excited to try this recipe. My husband gave it 4 forks down, as well, and is declaring he is so ill from the dinner that he is only eating plain rice for the remainder of the week.

These were really excellent. I love the spice. I didn't have beef, so I used pork and the flavors combined nicely. Great for summer grilling.

Easy, flavourful, healthy - and even the boyfriend liked it!

I've made this a number of times and everyone loves it. I also substitute yogurt for the mayo and, because I have vegetarians in the family, I substitute extra- firm organic tofu for the beef. A great vegetarian meal with baked yams.

This was great. Took the suggestion for substituting yogurt for mayo (we aren't mayo lovers) and it worked beautifully. Took the suggestion to double the sriracha in the marinade- I like heat, but this almost overpowered the dish- next time would keep it to 1 1/2 t in the marinade.

I couldn't stand the mayonnaise-y taste of the dipping sauce, so I added sriracha and extra lime juice to overpower it a bit. Unless you are a garlic addict, there is WAY too much garlic in the marinade!

Made these with friends for a cocktail party to rave reviews of the guests. Served on mini skewers with smaller portioned beef/veggie pieces (about 1/2" squared). Though a lot of work for assembly, definetely worth the end result. Many guests asked for the recipe.

Just made this and really enjoyed it. Followed the recipe except took other reviewers suggestion and doubled the sriracha. Also added sriracha to the dipping sauce. Easy and tasty.

I had to cook it much longer than 3 minutes, BUT it was FANTASTIC! We were amazed that each serving was only 122 calories. Didn't change a thing.

Very easy and very tasty. It tasted like actual Thai food, rather than simply having one or two Thai seasonings. We're sriracha addicts so I added an extra teaspoon to the marinade. Also for the dipping sauce instead of mayo I used non-fat plain yogurt and it was very refreshing and delicious.

Absolutely delicious. Quick and easy. Family couldn't get enough of it. Will be making this often this summer.

This was a great dish as the recipe reads. The family loved it and will be on the table often. If you really want to appreciate this recipe use it as it was given, go buy the ingredients needed to prepare it, or any dish for that matter. Dont review someone elses recipe after changing it with other items because then you are not reviewing the original recipe and that my friends is what this forum is about isnt it? Try the original and review it, change it and write your own recipe for review.

Very good summer recipe. The marinade makes the beef taste very much like larb from a Thai restaruant. I added Sriracha to the dipping sauce to spice it up more. Very tasty dish! Will be making this a lot this summer.

Really good. The dipping sauce makes the dish. I added add'l sriracha to the marinade, but felt it could still use more.

I've made this twice in a week because it is fast, healthy and good. It's important to have low sodium soy sauce. I use splenda and molasses as my brown sugar. I used chicken instead of beef because that's what I had. I used chili powder instead of spiracha, but this might have been a bad substitution. Oh and I used lemon zest instead of orange and red bell peper instead of yellow because I had it those ingredients already. Nice flavor and pretty presentation

Wow! What a tasty and impressive meal. Next time I will add only slightly a little more sriracha and after it's all cooked, I might might try sprinkling a handfull of finely diced peanuts to add some Asian crunch to the meat when done. Highly recommended to impressive yourself and your guest!

Great recipe - my wife loved it. So easy and so, so good. The only change I will make next time will be to slightly increase the sriracha as it was a little on the subtle side for us. Take care not to over-cook the meat. I left one of the skewers on for slightly too long and it made a big difference - I would say that leaving them cooking until there is no pink meat as the recipe suggests would be the maximum. The dipping sauce was also a revelation - extremely easy to make and tastes great - I'll be using it for other dishes as well.
