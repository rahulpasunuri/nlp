Strangely addictive, with some adjustments. I halved the ketchup, skipped the sugar, added garlic and went heavy on the cumin. The sauce is strong, I recommend using it as a dip, as pictured, rather than as a coating for the florets, as directed.

Delicious, and I don't particularly like cauliflower. Very nice appetizer.

Perhaps as a way to disguise cauliflower for children, but otherwise, give this a miss. The sauce was way too ketchupy, even though I used only half a cup, didn't add the sugar, and kept the other spices at the same level. Moreover, I added some turmeric and red chili flakes to up the spiceness, then coated the cauliflower sparingly. It was a good sauce, but not for cauliflower. A far better recipe for roasted cauliflower is here using coarse mustard and lemon juice and will go back to that one. This was hideous. Wish I could have given it no forks, since okay does not describe it.

Made this without sugar, but alas I should have read the reviews more thoroughly. The cauliflower was delicious but the sauce was way too ketchuppy. I will double the cumin and half the ketchup. Other than that, my guests loved the roasted caulifower and broccoli which I added.

Roasting cauliflower is a wonderful way to make it universally (almost) appealing. The sauce here is pretty fantastic too - the spices are divine, but I have to agree the sweetness is way too high. I did not use the sugar, and even then, the ketchup added too much sweetness. I therefore increased the toasted cumin until it felt balanced. Make sure to let the sauce cook for 60-90 seconds once everything is combined - that's when the flavors really come together. Overall, a really great side dish.

I'm not much of a recipe follower,when I read the recipe my brain generally forgets to take down the quantities, instead it breaks down the recipe in my head to each individual flavor. So when I started I completely omitted the ketchup, instead while preheating I put my oven on grill setting and roasted tomatoes till the skin came off easily, meanwhile I chopped a little onion, upped the ginger and garlic in this recipe to double, and separately crushed some red pepper and mixed it with powdered cinnamon, powdered cumin and coriander powder, and soy sauce, and made my sauce out of this, I also added a little sugar, vinegar and very little AP flour to it. I pulled out the cauliflower from the oven at about half way through the roasting time, coated it with all the sauce and put it back in the oven, and dropped the temp so it slow cooked it the remaining time.... turned out delicious...

Nom, nom! Kids will dig it! Agree w/most reviewers about the sugar. I didn't add any and cut back on the ketchup. Used full power soy sauce for the richness but thought it a little too salty too. I'm a salty-spicy person. Maybe a skosh less soy next time. Calorie/fat watchers- You can do without oil in the sauce. Used a blast of cooking spray to lightly dress the cauliflower for roasting.

Like the reviewers before me, I recommend halfing the ketchup.

When you can get a brown crunch on cauliflower it is elevated to a heavenly taste level. This is very easy and could be made even easier using powdered ginger, powedered garlic and untoasted cumin. Toast cumin in the same saucepan you will make the sauce in - you don't need to dirty a skillet. I didn't add sugar (ketchup has enough sweetness for me) and it tasted great! My new favorite cauliflower recipe. Would make a nice app. with sauce served on side for dipping.

I roasted carrots and red bell pepper along with the cauliflower. It added color and blended well with the rest of the flavors.

Made the recipe as is and thought it was plenty flavorful and didn't need any adjustments.

LIke most, I omitted the sugar and that is the correct choice. I also doubled the ginger, doubled the cumin and halved the catsup. My guests found it still too tangy, so i added 1 cup of fat free sour cream to about one cup of the sauce. This made it a little smoother and more Indian-like. Next time I'll add coriander and use tomato sauce instead of catsup. BTW: I served it with Chicken Masala, over jasmine rice.

Not bad- I, too, found it too ketchup-y and would probably make it again with tomato paste instead. I omitted the sugar per others' suggestions and was glad that I did. I also upped the garlic and ginger a bit, and added a touch of garam masala. It was a very good, exotic bbq sauce, and I'll make it again to accompany something, but I would rather have had another type of sauce with the cauliflower.

Really good! I did not add the sugar and it was plenty sweet. In fact, the ketchup alone made it a little too sweet for me, so next time I may sub out some crushed tomatoes or tomato paste instead. It does make a lot of sauce!!

This recipe is a delicious way to serve cauliflower. I made it warm per instructions only adding extra ginger, cumin and garlic to taste and applying the sauce to cauliflower sparingly. This also works as a salad with cilantro and chickpeas added after dressing the cold roasted cauliflower with the sauce. The sauce seems to convert even cauliflower haters to cauliflower lovers.

I loved this dish! If you enjoy stronger flavors try doubling the amount of garlic and ginger. I also added a bit of jalepeno to the dish...I minced about a half an inch and fried it with the ginger and garlic. I also sauteed the cauliflower instead of roasting...it cuts the cooking down significantly and they tasted just as delicious! (after they are a bit seared add a smidge of water to help them get a bit softer).

Following the advice of the other reviewers, I halved the sauce and increased the proportions of soy sauce & spices relative to ketchup. I ended up with plenty of sauce, but the ketchup taste was still a bit strong... Overall, this was good - the BBQ goes well with the roasted cauliflower - but the sauce still needs a bit of tweaking.

Great dish! I love the flavor of roasted cauliflower, and this is a unique spin on a relatively boring vegetable. I used about half of the recommended oil and made about 2/3 recommended amount of sauce because I was low on ketchup. It still turned out great, and I will definitely take this to my next potluck.

This dish is a run-away crowd pleaser at potlucks and other meals. Plan to quadruple the recipe. (I like to add extra soy sauce and ginger.) Diners always ask for the recipe, so be prepared.

My kids love this recipe. It's the only way to get all of them to eat cauliflower. To lighten it I only use half the oil called for; 1 T for the cauliflower & 1 T for the sauce.

I've made this several times and really enjoy it. The BBQ sauce is nice on grilled chicken. I'm not sure if it's Authentic Indian' but it's fast and easy.

Delicious! I made the whole back and my husband and I split it for lunch. As written it's 3 forks but I added some garam masala and hot sauce which made it 4 forks. I will make this with my changes often.

This was good but there was WAY too much BBQ sauce! I didn't even use half the sauce. What a waste

Pretty good as a side, if you temper the astringency of the sauce with something savory. I might halve the sugar next time.

This recipe is really good. I was short on ketchup, so I only put in one cup of it. It still was rather ketchup-y so I added more soy sauce to balance it out. Worked like a charm.

The BBQ sauce was way too sweet. Since ketchup already has sugar in it maybe 1 tsp of sugar may have been enough.

We are an Arab family but starting to like Indian food since our neighbors are Indians and beginning to explore this cuisine. But this one is a NO! NO! The taste wasn't good as the other Indian food the family had tried. I don't recommend this and sure won't be doing again....

very good. i would recommend cutting down the barbecue sauce by about half; its a very strong sauce. or just use the sauce as a dip rather than tossing the cauliflower in it.

I made this tonight for my Indian husband, who loved it. Before I told him the name of the dish he exclaimed, "The sauce tastes just like a sauce I ate at family gatherings growing up!" Like others who made this, I did not use all of the sauce on the cauliflower, but the extra went really well with the Indian potato patties we ate with the meal.

I made this for a dinner party and it was a hit. I would probably decrease the ketchup next time but it wasn't too overpowering as written. It did make a lot of sauce, but I used the leftovers on barbequed chicken the next day and the kids LOVED it!

Not a very good recipe and certainly nothing Indian about it. BTW has anyone tried roasting the florets after dipping them in tikka masala and then roasting them. Lower the temperature to 180 degree centigrade.

I loved this. I agree that the recipe makes WAY too much sauce, and I increased the proportion of all the spices to ketchup. I'm giving it 3 forks because it needs a little doctoring and isn't necessarily something I'd make for company, but it's a wonderful, healthy and makes a great substitute when I'm craving fries or something starchy.

*Indian* barbecue sauce? With ketchup and soy sauce? Come on folks. Good? Not very. Indian? Not at all.

I saw this recipe on my homepage today and decided to try it since I had 1/2 a cauliflower that needed using up. I didn't have any cumin or ginger on hand, but the sauce tasted good anyway. It was my first time roasting cauliflower, and I really liked it. I agree with others that the recipe made too much sauce. I halved it and still had leftovers. This was tasty and I will probably make it again.

It was my first time roasting cauliflower, and I loved the preparation. Sauce was extremely easy to make, though I agree with previous reviews that it was too ketchupy.

I frequently roast cauliflower--but add ground pepper and a few scrapes of nutmeg before cooking. Remember, don't salt that cauli before roasting, or you'll have a soggy mess. Salt after. The BBQ sauce was good, but not my favorite way to enjoy roasted cauli. Skip the sauce, enjoy the veg.

The sauce tasted too ketchupy, even after doctoring it up. I cut the amount of sauce in half and still had leftovers. Personally, I prefer cauliflower roasted simply with olive oil, salt and garlic. An excellent recipe for sauce lovers is the roasted cauliflower with mustard and lemon butter found here on Epicurious.

I cut down the bbq sauce to 1/3 of the recommended amounts and it was more than enough for one average head of cauliflower. Good side-dish recipe - I served it with chicken tikka masala.

I made this recipe last night to accompany tandoori chicken, and it was fantastic! The roasted cauliflower smelled and tasted incredible by itself, and the sauce was sublime. (Note though, that this recipe makes a ridiculous amount of BBQ sauce, maybe two cups, and I used two tablespoons of it for one medium-sized head of cauliflower. I put the rest in the fridge for use later this week.) I will definitely be making this again!
