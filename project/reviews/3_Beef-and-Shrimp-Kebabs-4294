This was okay for a quick weekend meal. I followed the recipe the first time I made it. I like it better with the Herb-Garlic marinade recipe from this site, red bell peppers, and pineapple.

This was good, but not exceptional. One could do better.

Not bad and easy to expand the recipe. will try again with chicken and mushrooms.

This is very good, but we found it was much better if you used a quality french dressing instead of Italian. Mix the garlic and french together (we also add a dash or worchire(sp) sauce) and baste the kebabs as they cook. Got rave reviews for this recipe served over rice.

This turned out very well, but instead of using bottled Italian dressing, I used the marinade from Grilled Flank Steak with Rosemary. I did marinade the filet chunks that I used, as well as the shrimp for about 2 hours. I have kebab baskets that worked very nicely for this recipe. And I also added some chunks of zuchini.
