Wow, what a great recipe. I have Never successfully made pie crust before. I followed another reviewers suggestion and used half butter and half crisco, just one teaspoon of sugar and it turned out very flaky and tender.

I halved this recipe to make an apple pie with a cinnamon sugar topping. It worked great! I made it gluten-free by using garbanzo, fava and brown rice flours and it was delicious. My new go-to pie crust.

I always subtitute a stick of Crisco for one of the sticks of butter. In other words, 50% Crisco and 50% unsalted butter. This makes the crust even flakier, and it also seems to reduce shrinkage and premature browning when baking. Don't worry, the buttery taste is still there -- even with just half of the butter! [n.b., Crisco sticks are MUCH easier to deal with than the tubs!]

This has been my go to recipe for pie crust. It is very forgiving and easy to handle. I have taught many people who are terrified of pie crust to make this one with great results. You do need pie weights and it does shrink a bit. It consistently gets rave reviews!

This crust is truly wonderful. It is incredibly flaky and has just the right amount of buttery flavor. I've used this for pot pies and dessert pies, and it works beautifully each time. This is definitely my go-to crust recipe from now on!

I really don't understand how ppl think this is so easy to roll out after it has chilled. When I took it out of the fridge it was as hard as a rock, and I can't roll it out at all. Am I missing something? Help!

Perfect, rich, and flaky. This is the only pie crust recipe I'm using from now on. Previous "failsafe" pie crust recipes I'd tried involved eggs and vinegar, but those gave me only okay results--much less flaky than this recipe. I did use a food processor as the recipe instructs, rather than a manual pastry blender.

Excellent! I add a capful of vinegar. It is great without it too. This couldn't be any easier to make, especially if you use a Kitchen Aid mixer. When I make pot pies, I make about 8 pies, so I need 4 batches of this for tops and bottoms. There is plenty extra to use for ornaments (cut outs/mini cookie cutters) such as leaves and acorns for delicious decorating.

This crust was excellent. After making all-butter pie crusts that tasted like cardboard, I was very careful to keep everything cold (even the flour, measuring cups, rolling pin, etc.) and not overwork the dough. I refrigerated the dough overnight and rolled it between sheets of parchment paper. It rolled out nicely and tasted delicious.

this recipe is good because it uses things that one usually has on hand, however for some reason, i ended up with tiny crispy bits throughout the dough. it wasn't a bad thing, just a weird texture and something i did not expect. i used less water than the 6 tbsp, so that probably altered my result.

My husband called this the best crust I've ever made. It got even better when I substituted vodka for 1/3rd of the water. The vodka evaporates off more than the water - leaving an even flakier crust. A huge hit on apple dumplings.

Made a great crust! So much better than store bought!

Excellent recipe. Does need pie weights as prone to puffing, but super-flaky and delicious!

This is the one to use. Generous size, easy to handle, yum butter! Also easily enough done by hand if necessary, just mixing the butter in with fingers to cornmeal-like texture.

Ummm...what about baking? Any instructions on that? Oven temp? Time? Did I miss that somewhere?

Perfect pie crust. Go to recipe.

This crust is the bomb! Very flaky and has a great buttery flavor. I substituted 1 cup of cake flour. I'm not sure if that's what made it sooooo good or it's just a killer recipe. Next time I'll try using 100% AP flour.

I've been experimenting with the different pie crust recipes here and this is the best tasting one I've made. I will be using this recipe from now on. It's easy to make and tastes much better then a frozen Pillsbury crust. Mind you, frozen crusts are great when pressed for time, but making this doesn't take much time at all.

This is the recipe from "Martha Stewart's Pies and Tarts" except that Martha uses a teaspoon of sugar and this recipe uses a tablespoon. I have been making this for many years and it always turns out well.

This is my default pie crust recipe. I've been making a pie a week for a couple of months and this is the one I like the best. It makes a generous amount of dough for a nice overhang, and is easy to work with. Also, I've frozen the dough and it still comes out nicely after thawing. Also, once I accidentally left the dough sitting out all night, then put it in the fridge and then rolled it out and it still came out well. One note: be sure to freeze/chill all flour, food processor bowl/blade, utensils, everything you use, when putting together the ingredients.

Extremely easy to make and has a great taste. I cut the recipe in half for only one shell and used 1/4 t salt and added 1/8 t of baking powder, you might need three to four tablespoons of water for the half recipe.

great, forgiving pie crust recipe! first time i made it came out perfect! when i tried to halve the recipe for just one pie crust it was too sticky-too much water, but still chilled, rolled and baked well!

Excellent pie crust. Light, flakey, easy to roll out, delicious tasting. I plan on using this recipe often.

Nice easy method, came together beautifully and easily with about 4 T. of water (if it were any more humid today, it would be raining). It was easy to handle, tender, soft and smooth. Rolled out and baked up great! An excellent update for a less labor intensive but equal in quality classic multipurpose pie dough. The method was clearly described and easy to follow too.

Very good crust. Actually enough for two 10-inch pie crusts. I left out both the sugar and the salt (used salted butter). Depending on the day's weather, the amount of added ice water varies. Chilling overnight produced the best results - time for gluten to form to make a nice crust that was easy to roll out on a floured board. Have made multiple times and will surely make again!

Tastes good, flakey and buttery. Have made it several times. Good to have on hand in the freezer.

This crust rolled out perfectly and tasted great. I used european butter (Plugra) which added rich flavor.

This is the best and easiest crust I have ever made. It is so easy to roll out and you can even make it in the food processor.

Good crust but I used half non-hydorgenated shortening and half butter.
