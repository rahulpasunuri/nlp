This is delicious. I made with the eggs on brioche that the recipe originally ran with in Gourmet. It made a lovely breakfast. This is not a difficult recipe--the apples are sliced and covered in sugar so that the sugar comes through with each bite. I'd definitely make again--this is a great accompaniment to a nice egg dish.

Maybe the reason no one has tried this recipe is that the directions are so screwy. It is way easier to core the apple then cut it up than it is to cut it in slices then core each piece. This is one of the fussiest procedures I've ever seen for such a simple idea.
