Followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar for the meringue to 1/2 cup. Quick yet impressive recipe that is easily assembled with ready made cake and icecream.

Made these last week and everyone loved them! The only change I made to the recipe was I only added 1/2 Cup sugar to make the meringue rather than the recipe's 3/4 cup. Also, it took closer to 4 minutes of beating to get the meringue to the "very thick and billowy" stage. Being patient with that process pays dividends! The meringue was perfect! I plated them with warmed chocolate sauce and fresh berries.

Tasted great, but - I found the meringue very frustrating to work with and if I use this recipe again I will go back to a traditional meringue added just before baking. Also, I found it much more effective to broil the meringue rather than bake.

Awesome. I used boxed cake and it was no time at all. Perfect dessert for after thanksgiving. Meringue prep was flawless and very tasty. Never made it this way before.

It is amazing how simple this recipe is to yield such impressive results! You can make it even more delicious by using homemade ice cream, but it's not necessary. One important note: it's important to make sure the cake and ice cream are COMPLETELY frozen before completing the last step. For me, 2 hours is not enough; I usually freeze them at least overnight. Other than that, I've followed this recipe exactly and it is great. I can't wait to try it with other flavors too.

Great straightforward recipe. Made one large instead of 6 small and it worked great. Molded the ice cream in a heart shaped pan and cut out the cake base in the same shape. After removing from the oven, flambe´d it with cognac which was dramatic and doubled as the 'birthday candle'. Will make again as individuals too, may even adapt to mini by using chocolate cookie wafers as the base and a small scoop for ice cream. Can really do a lot with this recipe.

This turned out even better than I dared hope it might for a first Baked Alaska attempt. I baked the chocolate base rounds in 6 individual small pans, used homemade strawberry ice cream, drizzled the plate with hot fudge prior to plating, and served the desserts with fresh strawberries on the side. Everything about it turned out perfectly -- lovely browned meringue, soft brownie, and a surprisingly hard ice cream center after 5 minutes in a hot oven. This is a definite keeper.

I used the recipe for the base to make one large baked alaska. I found a little too dense for my liking. Makes it difficult to cut especially after it's been frozen overnight. Not sure I would use this as a base again. The rest of the baked alaska turned out fine.

the cake base is really exceptional. I was looking for a base that would freeze well for an ice-cream cake. This base worked great! It was delish just coming out of the oven, and cut into two layers very smoothly. The top got a bit hard and was brownie-like but the inside was very soft. It maintained its flavor and chewy texture even after being frozen for 48 hours, and then defrosted and re-frozen for a number of times as the cake was gradually eaten. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but added 1 egg more, and used only 1/2 cup sugar.

This is little more than a good brownie and ice cream. However, the presentation is fun and impressive. My 10 year old daughter was astounded and thought it the best surprise ever when it came out of the oven and had ice cream inside. A buttered and floured pan can be used instead of parchment for baking the bottom. I found it easiest to cut an oversized base out of a cardboard cereal box, place everything on it before freezing. Its an easy way to transfer the baked alaska from freezer to cookie tray to serving platter. Heated knife needed for cutting. So easy, I'm making it a second time ahead for company.

This took rather a long time; my mistakes were not letting the egg whites come to room temp before making the meringue, and not refreezing the ice cream + cake before applying meringue (a bit messy). I like this for a basic recipe, but found the flavor combo underwhelming; I'll try a different icecream flavor underneath next time.

Excelleent! I made as the recipe indicated but only got 4 out of my cake base because I baked it in an 8x8 pan. I wish I would have put a piece of parmchment on the baking sheet before baking the alaskas. Removal would have been easier. The only other thing I found is that one pint of ice cream was pretty skimpy for 4 desserts but no one seemed to mind. Next time I might try taking the alaskas out for a few minutes before baking to let the cake and ice cream soften a bit. They were stil pretty hard. Otherwise this was easy and looked and tasted great. I would definately make again.

My first time also for baked alaska and it was spectacular! I was surprised to find that it wasn't that difficult to prepare. I made the cake and ice cream portion the night before and the meringue the following morning. I place the alaskas on the bottom of a spring form pan and used a short wide spatula to move them to the serving dishes - very easy. I substituted cherry vanilla almond ice cream and the result was incredibly delicious. This will go in my recipe box and I will prepare again and again for my favorite guests. What a wonderful dessert - give it a try!

This was my first time attempting a baked alaska and it turned out beautifully. I used a raspberry gelato and served it on a plate drizzled with dark chocolate. I used 70% cocoa chocolate for the bittersweet, and 85% for the unsweetened (couldn't find 99% and I hate cheap chocolate). This was a lovely presentation and not as difficult as I'd feared. The hardest part was transferring the baked alaskas from the baking sheet to the serving plates without messing up the meringue. I was a little concerned about freezing the meringue, but it worked perfectly and was great to make up in advance.

I made this for a party of 24 and it was a absolute hit. Made it in advance like someone earlier suggested and served it straight from the freezer. Really stunning!! Definitely a wow dessert. Also made my own strawberry ice cream. The cake can be made in a 9x12 pan so you get more cake rounds then the 9x9.

Enjoyed this summery dessert much better when I served it the second night. Didn't like it as much when served straight from the oven. Was much crisper after I put it back in the freezer overnight.

This dessert was so good. I made four 3 1/2 inch alaskas but they were too big a serving because they were so rich so next time I will stick to the 6 serves. The chewy chocolate cake is more like a brownie, which just meant that I enjoyed it that much more. I only used 1/2 a cup of sugar for the meringue and the sugar definitly wasn't missed as the cake and ice cream were sweet enough. All in all a wonderful dessert.

This was beautiful and delicious! My guests oohed and aahed when I brought it to the table. I must admit, though, that to save time I made one big baked alaska. I baked the cake layer in an 8 inch cake pan, and mounded about 2/3 of a quart of ice cream on top before adding the meringue. One great tip from Bon Appetit: soften the ice cream in 10 second increments in the microwave so that it softens evenly. If you leave it on the counter, the outside gets runny and melty while the inside remains hard, making it a big mess to plop on top of the cake. Enjoy!
