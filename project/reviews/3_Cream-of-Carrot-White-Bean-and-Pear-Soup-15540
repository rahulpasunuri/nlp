I really enjoyed this soup. I loved the flavors together. Like most people, I did make some changes as even reading the recipe sounded bland. I added an additional pear, a touch of ginger, as well as a bit more rosemary (dried). Delightful. I also did not add the cream as the final puree was already pretty creamy. Try it. It's good!

This soup is an enigma. It has a complex combination of flavors, yet it's still a bit too bland. I substituted 1 part dry white wine and 3 parts chicken broth for the water. Rather than chopping the rosemary, I cooked the soup with a couple whole sprigs in it.

Being diabetic, it's wonderful to find a recipe that actually lowers blood sugar while tasting great! Four stars for sure!

I forgot to add that I used chicken broth instead of water and added more leeks to add some flavor since the reviews suggested that this was bland.

Almost a 4 star! Excellent flavor. My only complaint was too much rosemary. Made this for Christmas Dinner and everyone loved it.

This soup is very good with a few modifications. I use chicken broth instead of water, and I use about 2-3 stalks of rosemary bound together, cooked, then taken out before pureeing. This gives the soup a nice, subtle rosemary flavor without the stringy, chewy bits of herb. This soup doubles and triples nicely.

BLAND!!!!! I thought the results were so boring and couldn't figure out how to make some quick adjustments at the last minute. I tried adding cayenne and a little nutmeg which gave it a little more depth, but I would definitely not try this recipe again.

I made this for a dinner party. It was a big hit. Unusual. Few people could pick the ingredients. I'm making it again this week!

I used onion instead of leek, and plenty of rosemary. The resulting soup was almost sweet in taste, and quite aromatic.

The soup was ok, but I had to add much more and varied spices to take this beyond pureed carrots. And I could barely taste the pear. If I were to ever try this again, I'd change it quite a bit, adding maybe fennel and cayenne, maybe a bit more cream, and deleting the pear.

I hoped for more pear flavor in this soup. To give it a little something extra, I made some changes including adding a cup of cubed squash (since it is in season here), using yogurt instead of half and half, and adding a half of a cup of Muscat, a sweet white wine, which really added an interesting flavor. With crusty bread, this was a hit.

Quick and easy. I used chicken stock instead of water and omitted the half and half. I also thought it needed a little acid at the end, so I added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of rice vinegar (although I would have used white wine if I'd had any around). Plain yogurt might also be good to finish it (especially since I left out the half and half).

Good, easy and quick soup. A real sneaky way to get beans into your family's diet as once pureed, this does not taste 'beany'. I cut down on the fat by using 1T butter (& a spray of Pam) to sauteed leeks and used skim milk to thin. I also added 1 small clove of garlic, chopped, to leeks. Finally, I saved some of the rosemary to add freshly minced at the very end. Blue cheese crumbled into each bowl was a good addition from another cook!

Thought this was awfully bland. I've been making pureed soups for a friend who had mouth surgery so I couldn't even spice it up. I did add a little sour cream, honey, sherry, and allspice and that helped - sort of.

I loved this soup. Next time I will leave out the half and half...it's not needed. I crumbled bleu cheese on top as a garnish. It was out of this world.

Paired with a salad, this makes a great fall or winter meal. Next time, I think I'll skip the half and half and stir some sour cream (or maybe lemon juice) into each bowl.

A delicious find---quick and easy too! My husband thought the combination of ingredients sounded strange but once served thought "this is a dish to serve company, not Sunday supper." I substituted evap. skim milk for the 1/2 & 1/2 and used fresh rosemary. This was a definate save to my epicurious recipe file.
