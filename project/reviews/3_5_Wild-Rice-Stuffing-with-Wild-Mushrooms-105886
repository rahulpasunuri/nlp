Excellent recipe! I found a rice blend that included white and brown basamati as well as red and wild rice. For some added sweetness I added dried cranberries. The Superstore carries dried shitake mushrooms (in the int'l aisle) for a reasonable price which was wonderful in this dish. Diced onions worked well too. I will make it again and again!

Made it with dried cranberries instead of pears, took a hint from another wild rice recipe and used some apple cider and veg stock for the liquid, and button/'baby bella' mushrooms with a small pack of dried wild mushrooms. It was a hit at thanksgiving dinner and the "leftovers" party the next day - I'm keeping this recipe!

The carmelized onions are truly the flavor base for this dressing. I liked the wild rice and mushrooms, but I didn't care for stringy texture of the onions. They just didn't distribute well into the dish. Next time, I'll puree the onions with an immersion blender using a little bit of chicken stock to make a slurry. Then, this mixture can be poured over the rice/mushroom mixture. I used dried apples but had a hard time dicing them to the right size, so next time i'll use fresh apples or pears to add some texture/crunch and flavor.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to use brown rice instead of white and to leave out the pears. It was good but not amazing, I felt like it needed something so maybe it was a mistake to leave out the dried pears. Also if I make it again I will definitely add in some walnuts or pecans. Texturally it was just a bit blah. Also maybe some celery or fennel to wake it up. I don't know, I just thought the flavor profile was a bit one note.

Love this stuffing! Have been making it regularly since it came out. Sometimes leave pears out as difficult to find. Just need to cook wild rice longer than recipe calls for as it can come out a bit too "crunchy".

This was fantastic! I also added some leeks in place of the onions and some black truffles and chopped hazelnuts. It was to die for! Everyone loved it

Although I am a confirmed bread stuffing maker, I tried this and loved it ! I used a wild/brown/ sweet rice blend bought in bulk at my local co-op, shitake and crimini mushrooms, and leeks for some of the onions. I can't imagine anyone could find this bland if they used the herbs and the wild mushrooms. As I believe is true for bread stuffings, cooking IN the turkey is essential. YUM!!!

I have prepared this for the past 6 years for Thanksgiving. I have changed it up a bit. I use crasins instead of pears (I like the tart) I also add Pine Nuts for a little extra crunch. While wild mushrooms are great it works just as well with the commercially grown fresh mushrooms. Also I fine chop the onions. This is even better the second day.

This recipe will be a Thanksgiving tradition from now on. The tip about the apples was a good one. I couldn't find pears either so bought a package of dried fruit mix and used the pears & peaches finely chopped with an almost-ripe bosc pear finely chopped. I also added 1/4 cup minced celery to the cooking onions and used portabello mushrooms. All 32 people raved and there was little left. I baked it by itself for 40 minutes and crisped it for 20 at the end, and used a heavy Portmerien cast iron/ceramic baking dish to prevent scorching.

Very tasty indeed! My family has a huge problem with the pears (although I liked them very much) My suggestion for those who have texture issues with pears should try throwing a few dried cranberries in the mix. It would be perfect for Thanksgiving!

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It was a huge hit! Even the "breadstuffing" purists loved it. I used a blend of wild and brown rices instead of just wild rice. After much, much searching I finally found dried pears in a specialty grocery, I used a cup of dried cranberries with the pears for added holiday flair, I used a blend of 5 really meaty wild mushrooms that tasted divinely earthy. I used a few more cups of chicken broth than was called for as I found the rice too tough. I made the dish about 8 hours before dinner, stuffed the bird with some of it and baked the rest right before the meal. Absolutely wonderful, our new Thanksgiving tradition!

THis is now our preferred stuffing for the holidays. I make small changes, mainly because we have duck for the holidays so I make some amendments to make it fit duck. Like I use duck broth instead of chicken broth. This is a great recipe though, we love it.

A while back there was a similiar recipe with danish sausage in Gourmet. How could I add danish sausage to this recipe and keep it great? I would leave out the fruit, I think.

I made this for a group of 16 as a side dish and still had quite a bit left over. I used a mix of fresh and dried wild mushrooms which worked well. I searched the city, but could not find any dried pears. I did find a bag of mixed dried fruit, so I used the pear and some apple from that and also some dried bing cherries I found. Next time I would try to find pears and still use some cherries. Very moist and a nice blend of flavors; a great accompanyment to pork tenderloin.

I don't know how this could be bland!! Between the mushrooms, fruit and herbs it has a wonderfully rich flavor. I used dried cherries instead of pears, which was not only delicious but beautiful in presentation as well. I didn't get it started in time to stuff my turkey, and instead just served it unbaked as a side-dish. Everyone loved it, even the non-mushroom lovers. Wonderful!

I don't know how this recipe could come out bland for anyone! It is the best wild rice recipe I have ever tried. I used regular white mushrooms and portabello mushrooms, skipped the pear altogether and didn't bake it. It came out amazing and everyone loved it.

I cut back on the butter and added bacon. The bacon really gives the dish a richness and flavor that might otherwise seem a little bland. For added flavor, you can also substitute chive for some of the parsley... but it is not necessary.

Wow! I made this for Thanksgiving this year, and we never did get tired of the leftovers! The stuffing gave the turkey meat a wonderful flavor and the gravy I made with it was divine! I ran out of chicken broth, I only had 4 cups, so I substituted 3/4 cup of water and 1/4 cooking sherry. I'm going to make it again for Christmas!

This is by far my favorite wild rice recipe. I cooked it as a side dish for dinner with mouth-watering result full of earthy flavors. Dry cranberies gave it a little zing, not that it was even needed, and made the dish look pretty - scrumptious! A few observations: 1) unlike bread based stuffings, this recipe is ready and cooked through before you even put it into the turkey, thus baking it is not required at all. 2) If you do decide to bake this stuffing in the turkey, you don't have to worry about the stuffing reaching a certain temperature, thus avoiding dryer turkey meet usually associated with longer cooking time. In my opinion you can't go wrong with this recipe.

I made this a couple of times already and everyone loves it. Since I'm a vegetarian I used vegetable broth, and as other reviewers I could not find dry pears, so I used dry cranberry and apples and it was delicious!!! As far as rice goes, you could buy a package of mixed rice (brown, wild, red, etc.), it makes it easier to prepare and gives this dish a REALLY nice presentation! and remember, you MUST use broth and FRESH greens (as recipe calls). I think that's the key for this dish NOT to be blant. Great a easy side dish

Blah. This recipe sounded great but was a disappointment. Several at my Thanksgiving table liked it alot, but most of us thought it didn't have a lot of flavor. As another reviewer said, you couldn't even taste the mushrooms. Definitely not worth the effort.

This Thanksgiving I stuffed my turkey with this recipe instead of the usual bread-based variety. I used dried cranberries instead of pears, a few shallots instead of onions, and crimini and portabella mushrooms. I thought it turned out well and plan to make it again, but it does need a little bit more salt or flavoring. My husband and I both liked it better with a few dashes of soy sauce. The leftovers are also a lot more useful in other recipes than a casserole dish full of bread!

This was a wonderful recipe. I made it as a main course for vegetarians at Thanksgiving and added lots of yummy mushrooms - a little more than it called for. I also didn't bake it in the oven, just cooked it like rice and everyone raved - even the meat eaters!

My husband made this for Thanksgiving. I was looking forward to it, even though we searched everywhere and couldn't find the dried pears. The recipe does say they're optional, so he made it without. It was not good! All I could taste was the thyme, and it seemed more like a pilaf than a stuffing to me. It was a waste of really good mushrooms (which you couldn't even taste!)

This was simply outstanding. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone raved. I will be making this again and again!

This was a fantastic stuffing. However, I suggest substituting at least 1 can of regular chicken broth for 1 of the low sodium cans, as I had to add quite a bit of salt to make it taste right. Didn't have dried pears, so I used ripe chopped pears instead, but the flavor didn't stand out. Then I added a 7oz bag of dried cranberries which worked well. We also added homemade sourdough croutons seasoned with butter and dried Italian herbs to give it more body.

Maybe it was me - hate to admit cooking failures, but this was overly viscous. I probably undercooked the wild rice, which resulted in hard little shards, well below crunchy. Though the ingredients were terrific, the result was sub-par. Sigh.

Thought this was good, but not as wonderful as the other reviews. Simply, it seemed a bit bland. That may have been because I served it w/ a chili cornbread stuffing and a deep fried cajun turkey - but it seemed to be a bit like simple mushroom pilaf, even w/ the pears.

Out of 30 people at a New Year's Eve dinner party, literally 15 begged ne for this recipe. Several people were spotted wolfing it straight from the pan so noone would see how much they were eating. Wow! I used dried cranberries b/c I couldn't find the pears.

Phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal!! I made this as the side dish to my Christmas dinner (Prime Rib) and I could not possibly have been more pleased. The variety of flavors was extraordinary--and not one guest failed to "ooh and aah" about it. I have already added it to my collection of favorite family recipes, because it was such a hit!! Thanks Epicurious!!!!

My whole family liked this dish, despite not being so fond of wild rice in general. I'm fortunate that I live in the bay area, where the diversity in produce is phenomenal. I used shitake, cremini, and oyster mushrooms and instead of using white rice, a mixture of California wild rice and a blend of wild rices. The carmelized onions added the sweetness but the pears added depth to the flavor, another dimension that most people could not identify. It was great.

This stuffing was fantastic! I used shitaake mushrooms, baby portabellas, and a few regular mushrooms. I couldn't find dried pears, so I used dried apples instead. I was only able to get long grain and wild rice that came in a box with its own seasonings already mixed in, so I sifted out the extra seasoning as best I could and added a little brown rice to make sure it was enough. It came out perfectly, as far as I'm concerned. I wouldn't wait for Thanksgiving to make it again!

The hit of our Thanksgiving meal! Couldn't find the dried pears, so I dried my own. Well worth the trouble, but next time I think I'll try the mixed dried fruit. Will definitely be permanent Thanksgiving dish.

I made a complete Bon Appetit Thanksgiving dinner and this was one of the favorites of the entire meal. The texture and flavor really made this a standout dish. Used shittake and crimini as suggested and included the dried pears which gave a nice subtle sweetness. Couldn't find dried pears on their own so I bought a packaged dried fruit mix that included them.

I will definitely be making this recipe again! It received raves from everyone at Thanksgiving dinner, and the recipe was extremely easy to make. I used a combination of portabello, cremini and enoki mushrooms and they were great. Next time, I will add shitaki as well--very earthy. And I used vegetable stock because we're vegetarians. Still extremely flavorful!

I loved this so much and am making it again for Thanksgiving.The dried pears are great. I also added dried apples and apricots. You don't need to bake it at all, it's ready to eat right out of the pot. Yum Yum Yum!!!
