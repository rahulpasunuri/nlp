Just made this as a valentine's dinner along w/ other courses. Great. I loved it. Used demi glace concentrate in the stock aisle of Whole Foods.

I made this recipe last night for a special meal for my son and his girlfriend. It was delicious. The merlot sauce does take quite a bit of time to make--if you can, make it the night before. I prepared filets as suggested, and they were fork tender. This steak dinner is as good as any steakhouse recipe. The pearl onions are a nice touch and make a nice presentation too.

love the recipe - the merlot sauce does take some time - so better if it is prepared ahead - but it is so worth it! I was afraid that the steaks would be too done - but prepared as stated and they turned out rare - just the way we like them!

My husband and I have made this recipe numerous times since 2002 and it has always been a hit. We make the sauce the night before or the morning prior to the dinner since it is time consuming. The best way to do it is make sure all of the ingredients are shopped and/or prepared so that the sauce can be made flawlessly. This is particularly important because of the caramel. I usually transfer some of the sauce to a squeeze bottle to be able to ensure beautiful plating. The onions are fantastic but we've done without them the last few times we've made this dish. The potatoes are also fantastic. It is important to cut them a little thicker so that they come out the perfect size after baking. I can't wait to make this again.

The steaks turned out perfectly juicy and medium rare. The merlot sauce definitely took more time than I had planned. I haven't used caramel in a sauce before, so I struggled a bit with it. It hardened immediately after removing it from heat. I turned the heat back up under it before adding, and it melted enough to add to the sauce. I think my pan was too shallow, as it reduced much more quickly than the recipe suggested. The sauce had a wonderful flavor, especially with the horseradish mashed potates I prepared as a side. I'm not sure I would make it again due to the expense of the ingredients and time involved.

Since I always overcook steaks and I didn't want to ruin my New Year's Day filets, I tried cooking them according to this recipe. They turned out perfect! Very tender and juicy. I didn't make the sauce; just served with sauteed onions and mushrooms.

I just made this for my husband's birthday, and he declared it the best filet recipe he's ever tried. This is a relatively easy recipe, that presents beautifully. I definitely recommend it for special occasions.

Where is the Merlot Sauce?

I made this last night and wow! I admit I did alter the sauce a bit by using shallot instead of onion and Balsamic Vinegar instead of Red Wine Vinegar. Balsamic has it's own natural sweetness. Also because of the negative reviews on the thickness of the sauce I added 2 TBS of flour to the butter/onion mixture and it turned out great. Will definately make again.

This dish was fantastic, both attractive and delicious! I made it for a birthday dinner... the guests of honour were delighted. If you spend the time prepping before guests arrive the meal comes together easily. I wouldn't change a thing!

this was a good recipe, not great. filet mignons tend to be a bit bland on their own (I usually marinate them) and simply pouring the sauce over them didn't seem to do enought for the steak, especially since the sauce is so thin.

I agree that the sauce was time consuming. I expected it to thicken, which it didn't, but I'm not sure if it was suppose to. The pearl onions were a great touch. My store didn't have yellow pearl onions, but white ones. I found out that the white pearl onions tasted better with the meat than the purple ones. I would make again, but add a thickener to the sauce.

Everytime I make this dish I say I'm going to submit a review and then I procrastinate... This is so wonderful! My husband is feeling "whiny" this a.m. and thinks this dish will make him feel better...so off to the stove!

I made this dish a long time ago, and lost the recipe! I am so pleased to have it again! The first time I made it I brought some back down to the butcher, and the wine seller to let them try. It just explodes in your mouth!

Absolutely delicious - will definitely make it again. I made the sauce ahead of time and reheated it. Next time I would double the sauce recipe. My husband raved about it.

excellent!!! I highly suggest making sauce beforehand...a little time consuming...served with a wild mushroom ragout, sauteed baby carrots and yellow/orange/red cherry tomatoes
