This is so good! My husband is a veggie, and so meatless dishes are high on our list, and this one is definitely a winner! I used phyllo do and it made ALL THE DIFFERENCE. Highly recoomended.

Used puff pasrty. Each sheet made 10 appetizer sized triangles. Husband hates mint, so I substituted dill. Baked for about 30 minuted in 350 degree oven. Puff pastry is very forgiving. As long as the edges are crimped tight, the triangles bake up perfectly. This took me about twenty minutes to assemble. Will use as a signature appetizer from now on.

Yum. I chopped four artichoke hearts (canned, not marinated) and decreased the amount of spinach. Used a can of crescent rolls. This works fine but beware- cook at 375 and check after 7-8 minutes or they'll be blackened.

I've made this several times. I prefer to use puff pastry instead of the canned dough. I don't usually have mint (don't like dried - don't have an herb garden for fresh) I have had great success using the packaged feta cheese with herbs.

This recipe was disappointing considering the rave reviews it got. I made it one more time adding a red onion to balance out the flavours and this improved but not enough to make this a "keep" recipe.

Taste amazing!!! I used fillo dough- very hard to work with, but pretty and yummy!The filling is incredible, I used feta with herbs in it. The pepper really makes a difference, and the mint is the magic ingredient, giving a light flavor.

LOVED IT! Only difference was using a full 4 oz. container of the feta. These are quick and easy to make, and very flavorful. The salad suggestion was a good one and nice compliment to these tasty treats. Do try and ENJOY! KIMBER

I used puff pastry for a good result. Very easy dinner.

Outstanding! Made this last night and I too, used phyllo instead of pizza dough as suggested by others. I think it would also be good with canned crescent roll dough (already in triangles). A definite keeper!

This is excellent . My family loved it. I used Spelt Fillo dough instead of pizza dough.

This is a favorite at my house. Forget the refrigerated pizza dough and use phyllo instead. Wonderful!

This was delicious, I made smaller versions cutting the pizza dough into 9 smaller pieces and served as appetizer, was perfect!

Very good. I made this with fillo dough and in appetizer-sized triangles. Can freeze just before cooking. Bake 45 minutes in 350 degree oven.

This recipe turned out great, but the 2 cloves of garlic was a little much. I'd use one next time.

This was a great weeknight meal. Very easy! I agree with a previous reviewer that "a little mint goes a long way." Next time I will cut back on the mint and maybe add a little extra feta.

This was wonderful. I too made small appetizers with puff pastry sheets and got rave reviews.

Excellent and easy...I also used Puff Pastry Dough and made small turnovers as appetizers. It took a while to stuff them, but it was worth the effort!!

I have been making this dish for years with two variations: I use Pepperidge Farm puff pastry dough and I make small appetizer size triangles. It's not hard to make and is a HUGE hit at parties.

Instead of two large turnovers, I made several smaller appetizer-sized ones and and fed them to my frineds. They loved them! When making them, though, remember a little bit of mint goes a long way!
