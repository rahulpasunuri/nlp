I loved this recipe, especially the reduction sauce. I used cranberry jelly instead of the red-currant, and it was really good. I also used balsamic vinegar because I was out of red wine vinegar. As for the lamb itself, having never cooked a rack of lamb before I didn't know how much of the lamb fat to cut off. I should have cut off more as it was left to the guests to do the job (rather messy). Plus, it must have added to the time to have that thick blanket of fat on there because it was more like 45 min. before it hit 125 degrees. but it was delicious and of course very moist.

Made this last night as a trial run for Christmas Eve dinner. It was absolutely delish, and I will definitely be making it for our big family dinner. The other reviewers are right about the sauce taking quite a long time to make. That being said, it's totally worth it. I did make a few changes...used lamb shank because I couldn't find lamb neck bones, balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, and pomegranate jelly made by a friend instead of red currant. Just wonderful! I plan on using pomegranate seeds and a light dusting of Italian parsley as a garnish for a festive presentation.

Absolutely delicious!

I made the sauce a day ahead and it couldn't have been easier. Very nice flavor. My lamb took a little bit longer to cook than the directions and so I recommend the meat thermometer.

As the consensus reveals, this was amazing. Worth every minute for the sauce, which was low-maintenance but time consuming. The sauce made the dish - really something you would expect from a top restaurant. I can't wait to make it again!

The reduction sauce takes two hours as warned by other reviewers but well worth it. Perhaps I didn't brown the lamb enough because I had trouble getting it to cook through to the center once in the oven.

Delicious! The sauce takes time to reduce so do it the day before or in the morning. Very special entree.

Delicious dinner and the sauce was heavenly good. I used balsamic vinegar instead of redwine vinegar but otherwise followed the recipe closely. After browning the meat I put small cooked new potatos and mushrooms on the pan frying slowly while the rack was in the oven and resting afterwards. Perfect sidedish!

This tastes amazingly similar to something you'd get from a good restaurant, and although the sauce seems involved, it doesn't take that long to make. The only thing I do differently from the recipe is roast the neck bones (with a little olive oil and fresh rosemary if I have it) in the oven for about an hour while I'm roasting garlic for the mashed potatoes I usually serve with it. Roasting the bones imparts a gorgeous richness to the sauce, sort of a home made demi glace sort of effect. Use this recipe if you really want to impress someone but you don't have time to drive yourself crazy cooking all day...it will work.

Amazing dish!! Best lamb I've ever had. Everyone I make this for has raved about it. Simple to make. My girlfriend is a very picky lamb eater (she loves lamb but she also knows a great lamb presentation/recipe from a good to average one) and said that this is hands down the best lamb she has had over any restaurant. Only helpful tip is to make sure the currant is jam with parts of the currant still in it as opposed to jelly which is not a flavorful (I've made it both ways).

I followed this recipe to the letter, and the resulting sauce was inedible. There's a weird vinegar taste that never goes away (and doesn't jive well with the lamb). From now on, I'm sticking to the mustard-thyme crust recipe.

Wonderful but easy! I used lamb shanks for the broth - the reduction took closer to 1.5 hrs. I also added an extra T of red currant jelly to make the flavor more pronounced, but not too sweet. We had plenty of extra sauce which I froze for the future. Delish.

This recipe is superb! I also used a lamb shank for the sauce and then froze it for future use. It took five extra minutes cooking time to get a med-rare result. Everyone raved over Christmas dinner this year.

Love it. Have made it 4 or 5 times now. I had some extra sauce last year and stored it in the freezer. One year latter, tastes as good as the day I made it. To make the sauce a little fruitier, without overpowering the lamb, I add about 3TBL apricot jelly to the sauce... one word: ambrosia

I too used lamb shanks for sauce.I marinated lamb chops in olive oil, red wine, garlic, thyme and rosemary for several hours and then grilled them on the BBQ grill. Spooned sauce over before serving. My guests raved and raved and everyone wanted recipe for sauce. Serve with grilled asparagus and chive/goat cheese potato cakes(from this site) as another reader suggested. It was truly an outstanding meal! This sauce is so divine.

Very easy to make, and if you use lamb shanks instead of the neck bones (shanks were all our butcher regularly carries) you'll have a second dish for later. Not sure why they call this red currant WINE sauce, for there is only a spoonful or two of wine in it but about the best lamb dish I've ever made, bar none. Do GRILL the lamb though, on the BBQ-cut in double chops. Stunning!!

The sauce was a lot of work. I expected it to be sweeter but then again I did double the recipe and may have gotten the portions wrong. It was a strong flavor though and I did like it. It tasted better to me the next day.

Supurb! Party of 25 people all raved for this dish and asked for the recipe. The sauce is not difficult to make and it worths all the effort to see all those smiling faces and gave their complimence. Thank you for sharing this creation!

Wonderful recipe! I found I had to cook it longer than the recipe called for, though, even to get medium-rare.

Made this for my darling wife and two best friends, using fresh Quebec racks. Don't let anyone discourage you by suggesting that this sauce is hard work because it isn't, and it is definitely worth it. Remove from the oven when your meat thermometer hits 122 degrees and let sit for ten minutes. Everyone raved. We'll make this again!!

Sauce was good, but took forever to make. I don't think it was worth the effort.

I do not give out 4 forks very often, BUT this recipe deserved it. I actually served it as an appetizer (at $38.99 per pound for a rack in Boston, you'd want to die. Robber barons they are...) The sauce was superb! i made it ahead of time and the smell lingered for a few hours, which really got my guest revved up to eat. Did not alter anything.

This is an excellent dish -- flavors blend beautifully. I did add more flour/butter thickener, and a bit more chicken broth , , , other than that, I followed the recipe. Enjoy!

I was anxious to try this recipe from this very popular restaurant in our area, and it did not disappoint. My dinner guests raved about the sauce, and it truly is worth the time it takes to make. Since it can be made ahead of time, it is a perfect recipe to use for company. I used broiled lamb chops sprinkled with thyme, and they turned out fine.

I substituted lamb shanks for the neck. The sauce is outstanding but I would cook the lamb a bit more.

This recipe needs a lot of preparation, but it is time worth spent. Sophisticated to look at, delicious to eat, this recipe is perfect for special dinners. The red currant sauce is great. If you cannot find lamb neck bones, ask your butcher for a substitute. It works just as well. I served it with Potato cakes that had goat cheese and chives -- a perfect compliment to the sweetness of the red currant sauce. An awesome recipe, but, I would recommend getting a head start if preparing for a large crowd.
