Best ribs I've ever had. Fall off the bone tender, and instead of having it with so much sweetness I added a lot more spiciness, try it with more cayenne pepper if you prefer spicier food, it definitely tones down the sweetness of the sauce.

Our first time making bbq. I appreciate that the recipe is for baked ribs. We don't currently have a grill so that wsa why we choose this. THe sauce was definitely too sweet for me, and that is saying a lot. We worked pretty hard to tone that down. Other big problem was that I like my sauce smootheas Onion had a nice flavor but it made for a lumpy sauce.

Very disappointing no one liked these ribs. Maybe I did something wrong but doubt it. I will not make these again.

I really like this preparation method. However, I wasn't overly impressed with the sauce. I will look for a different sauce next time.

I've been doing this recipe for years as is except roast the ribs for half the time in the oven and finish off on the bbq. Also instead of the sauce (too sweet), we just use a hot sauce (like Franks Hot Sauce) for basting while on the grill - it gives it a Buffalo Wing effect. The marinade and seasonings are excellent for these ribs.

Try lowering the oven temp to 300 and roasting for 3 hours on a rack over some water. The meat will be falling off the bones. Fantastic!!

Fabulous! I replaced the chili (oddly enough, since it is the recipe's namesake) with Garam Masala Powder for extra flavor and it was excellent. Didn't use sugar in the rub and halved the recipe. Sauce was the best ever, bottled kind can't compare!

Best ribs I've ever had. We used pork ribs and they were delicious. All my guests were trying to figure out all the flavors. So complex with all the spices. Smokey, sweet, savory... What more could you ask for!!!!

I hate to disagree with the majority here, but neither my husband nor I liked these ribs-way too sweet!

We LOVE this recipe. I've always been disappointed with ribs I've done at home, but not this time. They're as good as any I've had in a restaurant. Don't scrimp on the roasting time, though! We used pork ribs this time rather than baby backs and they were still as tender as could be.

This is a GREAT recipe. I was afraid that it would be dry after 2.25 hrs in the oven - no way - it was succulent, tender and quite tasty. The recipe, as given, is perfect for those that do not like spicey food. The next time that I make it I will double the red pepper quantity.

I have made this recipie many times- and each time received rave reviews. It is easy and extremly flexible. Definitely a party staple.

I thought this recipe was great, but i didn't have cinnamon on hand so i substituted with granular sugar. additionally, i didn't marinate the ribs. lastly, i added some browning sauce to the sauce recipe to make it darker and used maple syrup instead of molasses. after all that, the ribs turned out excellent. it's flexible enough to permit changes.

I made these on a whim because my dh is a big rib fan but I didn't think that any that I made at home would be as good as ones from the rib joint. I was very wrong! These turned out really great. I didn't have liquid smoke so I omitted that and I finished them up on the grill. We really enjoyed them and I know I'll make them again in the near future. I was shocked how well they went over. Tender and very tasty.

Even if you don't make the bbq sauce, this is the best rib recipe. I have made this over and over again for years. The kids love them and request them frequently.

Our absolute favorite rib recipe, worth keeping all of the spice rub ingredients on-hand.

Rating: 4
The ingredient list does not include sugar for the rub, but the instructions say "mix chili powder, cumin, sugar, onion powder and cayenne" to rub over the ribs. That would give the sweetness another reviewer referred to. How much do you think should be used? I put in 3 tbls. last time. Everyone loves this dish.

Made these for a party recently. Got great reviews and the ribs were gone in no time. The nice part of the recipe is that they can be made in the oven, great in winter. As suggested by a reviewer earlier, I baked them at 300 deg over pan with water.

This is an amazing recipe!! It has become our new "fav"..They are going to be the Super Bowl Ribs for sure.

Used the pan of water technique recommended by another reviewer and these came out just perfect after 3 hours at 300 degrees. Substituted 2 Tbl of Hot Paprika for 2 Tbl of the Chili Powder, and also added some Garlic Powder to taste. Both gave a nice kick. Only thing missing in the rub was some sweetness (the brown sugar), but the sauce offset it nicely. I used country ribs.

WOW. The sauce is amazing--my friend and I made ribs for 30 and it was an ordeal, but everyone raved about the sauce.

Have been making these ribs since the recipe was published. I made a few modifications on the method based on our old family recipe. I remove the membrane from the back of the ribs, rather than scoring it. Just slip the tip of a sharp knife under the membrane, working it until you loosen enought to grab it and pull it off. Then I brush on the vinegar mixture and put on the rub and let them set in frig. I put the ribs on a rack over a pan, then put the pan in a 250 degree oven, then add hot water to the pan, then cover loosely with foil. I let the ribs cook until tender, somewhere around 2 1/2 - 3 hours. You do have a very messy pan to clean, but the steam and gentle heat produces 'fall off the bone' meat. Be sure the ribs do not extend over the rack. Then I finish them on the grill. I do not change the rub or sauce. We think it is perfect the way it is.

I never go wrong when I listen to the reviews...This is a great recipe. I did not have the liquid smoke or onion powder (I substituted garlic powder) and only marinted for an hour, it came out great. This recipe seems indestructable . Thank you to the reviewer who noticed that the 1 tblsp of brown sugar was missing in the rub ingredients - like I said you can always count on the reviewers in this site...

Awesome and so easy! I served these with Pinto Beans with Tortilla-Cheese Crust and Spicy Slaw from Epiurious. Someone said that I could open my own rib restaurant with these. Definitely a keeper!

Made these for a date, made them for 50 people. Worth it. Awesome. Caramelize the onions in the sauce carefully and cook the sauce real slowly. I usually make several times the amount of sauce, save it for other applications.

Best oven-baked ribs I've ever had. Don't let the "chili" in the title fool you - they are not spicy. Just simply very good bbq flavor from the oven. I think I've found my "winter" rib recipe! Yummy!

These ribs are absolutely fantastic! They were falling off the bones--and the sauce was wonderful! Everybody went crazy for them! Will definately make again and again...

Even my picky hubby liked it! I'm making it again today, so I guess that says it all. I didn't boil the sauce enough the first time I made it, so I left the water out and didn't boil it at all this time. Will post again to tell you how it came out!

This really should be 2.5. My fiance loved it ALOT. I liked it but not amazingly so... I'm not a fan of the strong chili taste, but it was super easy to prepare and cook. Nice not having to fire up the BBQ and tend it. Halved the recipe since we only had 1 rack of ribs. Will probably make again.

I have tried many rib recipes and this is hands down the best. My kids and husband couldn't get enough. I can't wait to serve to serious BBQ rib fans.

Our family has stopped eating bar-b-q as we are always dissapointed...not with these. Made them for my husbands homecome, he had been gone to the war zone for 7 months, and there aren't a lot of rib joints out there, and he and my in-laws (from the south) couldn't eat enough. I used pork country style ribs and left the vinegar/liquid smoke on overnight for do-aheadness. Everyone agreed, you could open your own rib restuarant with these!

Forget about the way you used to make ribs....this is better. We make them about once a month or even more. The best.....hands down.

These were excellent-- definitely THE recipe for ribs at our house from now on. As another reviewer suggested, we baked them for about 10-15 min. less at the beginning.

Just a few weeks after attending the local Rib-Fest I was craving ribs. I made this recipe and can say that nothing I have ever had compares to these ribs. By far the best ribs I have ever had. My copy of this recipe has five big stars and some barbecue sauce on it.

These ribs are phenomenal!! I had never made ribs before but decided to try these last Labor Day. You will be astounded at their succulence. The only change I made was finishing them on the grill for the last 20 minutes. I am making them again this Labor Day! I can't wait!!

Very tender, excellent tasting ribs. Despite all of the chili powder, cumin, and cayenne, we did not find these overpowering or spicy. Nonetheless, this is a "keeper" for baby back ribs lovers. Beats the heck out of Masterpiece or Open Pit, I can tell you that!

These were excellent falling-off-the-bone ribs with a strong chili flavor. I grilled them for the last 15 minutes or so. Finger-licking good!!!

I have always made my ribs on the grill, but never again. These were great and were falling off the bones. I did not use babybacks so I cooked them a little longer and slower. Everyone loved them and my sister-in-law had me run off a copy of the recipe to take home. I am certain that this will be a repeater in my house this summer. I give it my highest recommendation.

The amount of brown sugar omitted in the rub is 1 Tablespoon. Great recipe!

Rating: 4
You can believe the good reviews here. The sauce is the star. After the rub, before baking, I'd suggest omitting the salt which tends to toughen meat. Not all the rub mixture needs to be applied. Also, 2+ hours in the oven is along time for baby backs. I cooked them to perfection in about 1 1/4 hour.

Made these for Father's Day...my husband didn't care for the overwhelming chili powder taste...he asked that I find another rib recipe so won't be making this again. However, I found this recipe to very easy.

Best ribs ever. Try a couple of variations: use boneless country ribs and bake for 3 hours or more (last hour & half covered); finish on the grill with the sauce instead of in the oven. Heavenly!

this recipe is one of the best bbq's i have ever tried. I make this every summer and my quests always ask for the recipe. the pinto beans and the cheese cake are perfect with it. I also make the sauce and roast a whole chicken with the rub. shreed the chicken add to the sauce to make pulle bbq chicken sandwiches. Tooo good.

Simply Fabulous and EASY! We enjoy these COLD at the beach or HOT for today's Super Bowl Game. We love them and have been making them since the recipe appeared in 1995. I could not find my magazine so I printed it off the internet. I do have a suggestion, the recipe I printed off the intent omits how much sugar to add for the dry rub. The paragraph indicates chili powder, cumin, sugar, onion powder and cayenne. Please tell how much sugar to use and is it Brown sugar or granulated sugar? I hope this will clear up some confusion. Thank you for this finger licking GOOD recipe!
