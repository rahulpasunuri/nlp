Absolutely fabulous. Followed the directions and everyone loved it however when cooking the fish used 1 tblsp olive oil and one of veg oil.

This recipe was incredibly easy to put together. My husband was really impressed. Before I cooked the bass, I ran my knife along the skin to remove extra liquid. This made the skin really crispy when I cooked it.

A really nice way to serve fish. Super easy and really tasty. I made it pretty much to directions and it was great. I added croutons to the side which was nice and I wonder if adding them into the salad would be good. I'm also curious if mint would be good instead of the basil.
