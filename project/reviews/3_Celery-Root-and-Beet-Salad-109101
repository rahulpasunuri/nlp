Although a beautiful dish, if I hadn't been pickling beets and had leftovers, I would agree with another reviewer and would have used canned.This dish lacked a flavor profile. I added a couple teaspoon of some excellent balsamic and it became a wonderful dish.

Never again! Quick and easy, my foot! All that chopping into matchstick pieces was a hell of a lot of work. I tried using the mandoline and sliced my finger. All that for something bland and boring. No one took seconds; that's for sure.

I love beets -- and this salad is easy and quite good. A nice variation is the addition of tart green apple matchsticks. Very refreshing and a nice sweet & tart combination.

This time around I decided to use canned beets that are chunked instead of the throes of baking,slicing and dicing. Not as good but sure is easier. Tried it with celery instead of celeriac and it wasn't as good. It is not always available. Sometimes when it is available it is so homely it looks like moon scape. But this time I was able to get a nice size slice for the recipe.

Someone in our cookbook club brought this salad and we all enjoyed it! I've never thought I liked beets, but the way they are roasted and then cut into matchstick sized pieces made me a convert for sure! A beautiful dish that I hope to make soon.

This would be a lovely holiday addition to the table as it is very colorful. Don't work so hard cutting up the celerac. Peel. Then sliced and stacked three or four slices. Then cut the match sticks all the way across. Easy. Definitely better if made the day before. I was wondering if celery could be used instead of the celerac. It isn't always available. I would remove the strings with a potato peeler. Then slice into match sticks. Might work in a pinc.

This dish was really a lot of work between the cooking of the beets and the work needed to get the celery root trimmed and cut up but was well worth it in terms of taste and presentation. Some of my dinner guests went for seconds - not typical for a beet dish. The colors and texture make for a great presentation served.

We enjoyed this colorful, easy salad. The youngest child, who has never like beets before, had two servings.
