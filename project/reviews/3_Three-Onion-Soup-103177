i read the reviews before making this, so i knew to kick up the flavors. after cutting the stems off the leeks, i infused & simmered them in chicken stock instead of using any plain water. i substituted a cup of beef stock as well. i also toasted french bread brushed with olive oil to put on the bottem, and baked it traditionally with plenty of gruyere. i understand why bread was not intended in this recipe. because of the potatoes. i will definitely make this again, but without the potatoes, or a lot less of them. probably because i need bread in my onion soup.

I liked this soup but it was a bit too fussy for me, I don't like the idea of pureeing the soup either... This is my favorite onion soup recipe: http://joelsfoodblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/easiest-english-onion-soup-ever.html

I have made this a few times and it always gets rave reviews. Wonderful served as a first course with a fall season menu. I use an imersion blender. What a wonderful find. Lots less clean up than using a regular blender!

This was really delicious--I'd have given it 3.5 forks if I could. I think the key is browning the onions--this step gives the recipe good flavor. I needed to saute the onions for about 20 minutes to get them browned. I'd definitely make it again, and I'd double the recipe next time.

The flavor is definitely subtle, which is not what you want from an onion soup, especially one that takes this amount of preparation. Using red wine instead of water to deglaze helped, but for the effort you might as well make a traditional French onion soup.

Good soup... I added a small beef boullion for a little extra flavor. Next time maybe a little bit of wine in the cooking of the onions. I followed another review and pureed a bit more than the recipe calls for, but next time I'll puree less to give it less of a chowder consistency. My husband is VERY picky & he loved it.

If not for the balsamic vinegar, this soup would have no flavor whatsoever which is a real shame considering all the work that went into preparing it. The only thing I'm faced with now is what to do with the leftovers - hopefully some packaged onion soup mix can save this.

This soup was wonderful. I used the type of onion that is in the stores now that is a cross between a shallot, garlic and onion instead of the regular onion. It gave it a great flavor.

I would make this soup again only if I knew I wouldn't be seeing anyone for a good 48 hours. This soup made me smell for days!

I was disappointed after reading most of the fabulous reviews. The soup was excellent up until I added the vinegar - then it took a drastic nose dive. The vinegar overpowered the other flavors. If I do make the recipe again, the vinegar is out.

We loved this soup! I agree with a previous reviewer - there's no need to use two pans/pots. I just started it in a good size pot and finished it there. One comment - we either we very hungry and/or it was just great - but the two of us easily finished what was supposed to serve 4 people!

After reading all of the reviews, I couldn't wait to make this soup. Then I made it and was very disappointed. It was very time consuming to make and I did not enjoy the taste. Neither my husband nor I finished it. I ended up throwing it away. I love onion soups, but this one was not for me!

This soup was better the second time around when I added two potatoes and pureed more than one cup.

This is delicious soup! I saw no need to use two pots for this I prepared it more simply by using only one pot for the whole preparation. I used a hand blender for the pureeing part. Its a lot easier than the blender. It turned out wonderfully and the balsamic is a fabulous touch!
