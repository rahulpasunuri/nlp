Poaching seafood for Ceviche? I've never heard of such a thing. Ceviche is made by the lime juice 'cooking' the desired raw seafood, after it marinating for a few hours, the shrimp and scallops with turn opaque. I wouldn't dare try this recipe. Good waste of seafood.

This was truly awful. I have never rated a recipe so low before but the flavors and textures just aren't there. The scallops were fine but I really didn't like the texture of the shrimp in the dish. And although I love saffron in many things, I now know that ceviche is not one of them... it just doesn't work with everything else going on. I served this on a bed of lettuce surrounded by garden cherry tomatoes and chunks of avocado (all with a little lime juice and olive oil) and my bf ate it and said it was good. I'm not sure that I believe him. To me the most frustrating thing was that I spent almost $30 on good seafood that was then rendered inedible. Sigh...

For a summery and more interesting presentation, I placed the ceviche on a bed of cubed avocado. I also added ripe mango chunks. The ripe mango goes well with all the onoins and peppers. Otherwise, the ingredients are well balanced. A fresh and healthy meal...

I made the recipe according to instruction - it turned out decent, but not great. I've had several varieties of ceviche/seviche/cebiche in my time, and I have to agree with those who would choose not to poach. While there is no such thing as a pure recipe, and every variation is not only allowed but encouraged (how else are we to grow?), it is possible to argue that the point of ceviche-type dishes - what sets them apart - is partially made by the citrus-cooking of the fish. Poaching makes the dish rather dull, perhaps 'common', and this recipe is better off without it. A last note - the link provided in the review below was useless.

I have not yet had the provilege of trying this recipe, but I took some exception with the previous post that argued about the variety of spellings for this dish. Sometimes, it is not a good thingb to be too "cynical" or too "know-it-all" See :http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CevicheNotes.htm

We served this at our wedding. 10 lbs of scallops were gone in an instant, it was fantastic

As a Latin American I get to be chauvinist about few things, but one of them is ceviche, which can also be spelled "seviche", "ceviche", or "cebiche" according to region. The spelling is variable, but one thing is not: no heat allowed! No one will ever convince me poaching does not reduce flavor.

I boiled a half vanilla bean with the clam juice and saffron, added 2 Tbsp of pineapple juice, and some avocado. A little olive oil also helps to cut the sharpness. Great base for endless variations.

I have only read the 3 recipes which spell the dish, "ceviche". I have not yet read any spelled, "seviche". While these dishes sound tasty, I would certainly not call them ceviche. I might call them seafood cocktails or some such, as ceviche is basically seafood pickled (sometimes called cooked) in acid, specifically LIME JUICE. Any precooking of the seafood is NOT ceviche....period.

We loved this - a few comments - okay to make the night before - serve as cold as possible - the color is a little "bright" from the saffron - rest assured that the greens tone it down a bit - served in martini glasses - very cool.

The first time I had tried Ceviche, it was at the Yacht Club in Lima, Peru. This tastes just like that. It brought back a flood of memories from one of my favorite places in the world.

Does anyone know how much this makes? I was going to make it again tomorrow (party of 35), but noticed I'll have to wing it with the quantity. Overall, loved this recipe - took it to a party before and people loved it. Instead of shrimp and scallops, I used calamari (cut into strips from tenderized steaks), scallops and mahi mahi. I also substituted Asian chili sauce for the aji, since I had it on hand. I served the Ceviche in Margarita glasses with a dollop of homemade spicy guacamole on top, and lemon, lime or small orange wedges on sides of glasses. Served it with homemade Mexican-spiced flour tortilla chips.

I haven't tried the recipe, but I can comment on the Aji. It's a South American chili that is quite tasty. Aji Amarillo is a yellow-orange paste. Very good in home-made salsa also. Find it online at: http://www.salsasetc.com/catalog/d-740b.html

Excellent. Made this a couple days in advance of the weekend and had it with croustini. Added a yellow pepper and used asian chile sauce instead... a nice light hors d'ouevre!
