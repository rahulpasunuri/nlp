Its a good idea and the concept is there but the dressing is waaaaaay to heavy. The veggie oil was too overpowering. perhaps a different oil or maybe unsalted butter.

This pear and blue cheese thing is totally new to me - I've come across it a few times since moving to the States, and it's really growing on me. The shallot dressing is the best thing about this recipe though, deliciously sweet and a great balance to a stronger cheese taste.

I liked the combo of flavors. My husband did not like the dressing. Easy, but nothing too unique.

This was a real winner. We made it for Hanukkah because we like something fresh and light next to our latkes! A couple of days later, I brought it to a Christmas buffet and it was likewise delicious with the leg of lamb! Non-denominational and delicious!

I have made this dressing twice this week. Both times I left the cheese out and added chopped avacado instead. My family loved it!

This is very easy to prepare and can be made in much less time that the 45 minutes suggested. It is great as a first course with wine, because it is a salad that does not contain vinegar. It is worth buying the best gorgonzola you can find. Delicious. Even my 14 year old daughter loved it.

My guests raved about this salad. When the dressing was done, it seemed to have way too much shallot in it. i strained it, and added about 2 Tbs. of the sauted shallots back into the dressing. it was plenty shalloty I think. i dispensed with the fancy presentation,put it all together in a bowl, much easier, still pretty.

It was a great variation for the gorgonzola, pear, nut salad... I wouldn't use use all of 1/3 cup of the vegetable oil. But will definately do it again.
