Tried this recipe for lunch today, and it was delicious. I did not use the salad because I had some steamed spinach in the fridge. I made some applesauce and served the warm applesauce with the steamed spinach. Great combination of flavors. I would think that the cutlets would also work well on the grill, minus the breading. The grated/shaved cheese could be added at the table to either the cutlets or the salad. Very easy workday meal. Everything could be prepared ahead and refrigerated; The cutlets could be sauteed just before serving time.

Made the cutlets, not the salad. Tasted good and different but not something I would eat often... just a change of pace once in a while. I did not find it tough or stringy.

We liked this meal, though I feel it needed one more flavor. It was a bit light. Don't know what I would add.

Very good and simple. But, I too varied the recipe. Rather than parmesan in the bread crumbs we shaved fresh parmesan on top of the salad, figuring we'd use less cheese. Also, we think it its tastier that way. We also threw in fresh cherry tomatoes, which adds good flavor and color. The red onions leave something to be desired. Unless not too strong they dominate the dish (and I had soaked them in water and vinegar to take out the pungent bite). Maybe scallions next time. Don't overcook. If pounded thin they really only take 2-3 minutes per side. Leftover cutlets always good too. Finally, add salt when they are hot right out of the pan, makes life very simple re: seasoning at multiple steps.

Please, please tell me Teresa from Los Angeles is kidding...Honey, you didn't make turkey cutlets milanese, you made Chicken Parmesan. Which is fine, but it ISN'T THIS RECIPE!!!

Loved this recipe but did not make the salad. I used chicken breasts rather than turkey and only about 1 tablespoon of the cheese with the bread crumbs which I made with a hamburger bun with sesame seeds then lightly toasted the crumbs. After cooking the cutlets, I topped with pasta sause and mozzarella cheese melted under the broiler. Yum!

I love this dish - I've made it with chicken and veal with admirable results. When I can't get my hands on watercress (which, sadly, is often), I use baby spinach with great success.

I made the cutlets only, not the salad. The cheese/bread crumb covering gave a nice flavor and texture to the turkey cutlets, which normally are quite bland. The recipe was also very easy and quick to prepare. I will definately add this to my weekday repetroire. I also soaked the cutlets in a mixture of about 2 tablespoons salt to 2 cups water for about six hours (brined them), then rinsed, as an experiment. This really seem to remove some of the stringingness/toughness that they can sometimes get.

Used baked turkey slices; served with Garlic Spinach, baked potato and Fleurie Red Beaujolais wine. Will definitely make it again.
