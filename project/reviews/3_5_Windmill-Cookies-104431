I made these at a friends house, and her children are allergic to nuts so we replaced the nuts with oatmeal, and they were so good, we have never made them with nuts again!

I have made these cookies every year since 2000, it wouldn't be the holidays without them. Yummy.

This is a bad recipe. I hated the flavor so I added double the cinnamon, and it tasted great. Toasting the almonds really helped too. However, the texture of the baked cookie was awful-too tough. I did get the best results with thinner cookies. Also, I tried remaking this dough with less flour, and it did not help.

These aren't really any better than the storebought kind, unless perhaps they develop more flavour as they age. If I made them again (unlikely), I would add more spices, possibly including cardamom and ginger, and perhaps orange rind and vanilla. At that point they wouldn't be traditional anymore, but might be more flavourful.

I think these cookies would be better if the spices were doubled--seemed bland to me. Also, slicing thin makes a much better cookie.

To the cook from North Carolina- I haven't rolled this dough, but if you do find that you can, a "wind mill" like shape can be achieved by cuting the dough into 1 1/2 inch squares and making a diagnal cut from each corner into the center. Then fold in every other corner(just like making a paper pin wheel) and viola! A windmill. I'm guessing this may change the baking time! Good luck

I made this recipe for Christmas because my daughter has always loved the windmill cookies sold in the supermarket. Naturally, these were so much better and gave a new meaning to windmill cookies. My only thought is that I wonder if there's a way to perhaps roll them out and cut them into shapes rather than just rounds? I haven't tried this, but I'm just wondering if it's possible and, if so, how to go about it. Then they would be not only delicious but pretty, too. Any thoughts?

Ice with a simple confectioner's sugar and water combination. Very good.

EXCELLENT! I was born in Holland, and made these for my mum and dad. They loved them also. The biscuits don't stick to the tray if you loosen them while warm. Allow them to cool on the tray for extra crispness.

all my life I've been looking for a recipe for dutch spice cookies and this one is it. I made a few adjustments to it though. Since I was only making these for myself I halved the recipe and found that two cups flour was entirely too much. I only used 1.5 cups intead. I also added a tiny bit of pure almond extract and upped the cinnamon LOTS. when I tried them I was absolutely amazed. they tasted just like the ones from the store. EXELLENT cookies I'll definately make these ones again and again.

This reminds me of the cookies I used to eat in northwestern Germany. They are very good. And the trick to getting them off the cookie sheet is to use parchment paper. I didn't do that with the first batch and it wasn't pretty!

Very similar to the kind you can buy in the store but lacking something..... The trick is to bake them for at least 13-15 mins so they are real crispy.

MY GRANDFATHER WAS DUTCH, COMING TO THE U.S IN 1916. THIS RECIPE HAS BECOME THE NEW FAMILY FAVORITE - WE EVEN LOVE TO EAT THE DOUGH FROZEN!!!! I DON'T COOK AS LONG THOUGH, MAYBE ONLY 10 MIN. OR SO - WE LIKE A LITTLE SOFTER. A REALLY GOOD RECIPE!

The BEST!!!! Just as tasty as they used to be years ago. A huge hit with everyone who recieved them in their Christmas Cookie Gifts. I did bake them abit longer, to crisp them...but not browned. I also froze a log for 2 days & was fine.

These cookies are very delicious! They're easy to make too. I will make them again but not too soon because when I start eating them I can't eat just one!
