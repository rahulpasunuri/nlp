Excellent, quick recipe. A keeper. Simple to make and a very nice blend of flavors.

I have made this several times which is very rare for me (with so many epicurious recipes, why bother?). For me to remember it well enough to come back again really means something! I just made it again and substituted escolar for the swordfish, it was delicious, very Sicilian. I served it over couscous with orange and mint. Also, I only needed 2 T of olive oil.

Okay, I'm in the minority here, but my husband and I thought it was bad - real bad. Here's why: First, the flavors of the capers and olives completely overwhelmed the raisins, etc. Second, the entire combination completely overwhelmed the flavor of the fish. (I followed the recipe exactly.) Third, the bits were too chunky; probably would have been better if everything had been thrown into a food processor and pulsed for a few seconds. Last, there was far too much relish for four, swordfish steaks. It could have accompanied at least eight. Typically, when something is a bit off, especially if it gets three or four stars, I'm willing to re-try the recipe with a bit of tweaking. This one, however, may just go into the Do Not Ever Make Again pile.

Fantastic! This is going to become one of my favorite recipes for impressing guests. It's colorful, reasonably easy, and unusual. I made it with mahi-mahi which requires a bit more oil due to it's shape but just use a paper towel to absorb the excess. Served it with garlic creamed spinach and fried plantin. WOW!

This recipe is easy to make, delicious, and a good way to use up mint.

The ingredients, in combination with each other, sound terrible but I couldn't believe the taste. The olive, raisin, & caper topping serves as a kind of relish or "salsa" for the mild tasting fish. It's become a staple in our household and surprise, guests like it at much as we do. Great with the "Spaghetti w/Pesto Trapanese."
