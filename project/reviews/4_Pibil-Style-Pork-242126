Do yourself a favor and use a gas grill. I ended up replenishing the charcoal every 20 minutes for 4 hours. Very tedious. I didn't bother with the chimney. The charcoal I used was supposed to be great for slow cooking, but burned up pretty fast. The meat came out great (I like a little smokiness) but wasn't falling apart in the middle. I used boneless pork shoulder and thought it would cook faster but maybe the bone heats up the inside better. After taking off the easy stuff, I put the rest back on the grill for another hour and a half and it still wasn't falling apart. I would make it again with a gas grill or maybe in a dutch oven with foil over the pot. I also think I would use two 2-pound pieces of meat. I use a similar marinade for fish tacos using red snapper. I put achiote paste, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, cilantro and a little water in a cup and use an immersion blender. Then marinate the fish for 1/2 hour. Grilled or on the stove, it's great and you can't get that color any other way than achiote, which I have only been able to find in large Mexican supermarkets.

While I have yet to make this recipe exactly as written, I've done several variants thereof. Regardless, it's a simply amazing set of flavors. I would suggest anyone considering making a pibil- style pork watch Robert Rodriquez's youtube clip. It sums up the whole recipe in a few short, informative minutes: "http://www.youtube.com/watc h?v=gO8EiScBEjA"

simply fantastic. Served it with homemade salsa, corn tortillas, and little bit of shredded cheddar though queso fresco or cotija would be very nice as well.

I did simmer the roast first on low heat (on advice from owner of local Latin grocer) with 4 heads of unpeeled garlic and 4 whole dried pasillos, salt, pepper, and Cumin, until tender but not falling apart. Then followed recipe regarding Marinade - marinated overnight - and bbq'd wrapped in foil. This was incredibly tender and flavorful. I did make my own Achiote Paste - it was very flavorful and worth the extra step. This was devoured at a Mexican themed party - will definitely make again.

In response to "A Cook from the Rockies" Achiote paste has nothing to do with the ancho chile. Finding the proper ingredient will be well worth the effort...it is, after all, the dominant flavor in the dish and quite a unique one at that. On a separate note, I wouldn't aim for 195 degrees as the recipe suggests. I'm pretty certain that's a mistake, and cooking it to that temperature would take an enormous amount of time and would kill the delicious meat.

Excellent! No oil recipe! Would cut the salt by 1/2 next time, added 1/4 cup pineapple juice, 1/2 seeded serrano chile,(instead of paste)used 1 dried Ancho chile - rehydrated in the juices warmed up. Braised in oven 1 1/2 hours at 3:25. Cubed pork chops - did not marinate at all.

This is really good and worth the effort it took to find: 1 achiote paste. 2.Figuring out the charcoal grill set up and paying attention to it for 3.5 hrs..

Is it a keeper?  Yes After reading this recipe in the May 2008 edition of Bon Appetit magazine while on my way to Mulege , Baja California this seemed like one recipe that should be made. Coincidently, we just happen to be graciously invited to a party where the main course was an oven roasted whole pig. The residents of the Orchard had prepared this is a traditional way with garlic, salt and a basic spice mix. After some thought I believe this hog could have been served in this Pipil style marinade. I pretty much followed the recipe as written. The only changes I made was in using organic pork from Whole Foods. One great find was a brand of corn tortillas from WF. These were thick, fresh and better than most of the brands found and the average Hispanic grocery store. We thought this recipe was great. I cant wait to make this for group of people and include margaritas and refried beans with chorizo.

After reading similar recipes for cochinita pibil, I marinated this overnight and cooked it in a crockpot with the marinade. I also added 1/2 cup of grapefruit juice to the marinade.
