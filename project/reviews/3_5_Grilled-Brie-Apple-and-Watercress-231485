Instead of making a sandwich, I made it as a pizza. It worked out great. I also went a little light on the watercress. I used only the leaves. After the pizza dough was cooked and the brie was bubbling, I added watercress that was lightly tossed with salt and extra virgin olive oil. I drizzled honey and a little more oil over the pizza and cracked pepper over it. This is a great summer lunch or dinner that you can make on the grill and keep your house nice and cool!

Made twice, found that it was more interesting with thicker slices of apple (which stayed crispier) and cooking for less time to maintain crispness on the apples. Went light on the watercress as I found it a bit overwhelming in larger doses. Overall delicious though, really how can you go wrong with melted brie and apples?

These little sandwiches make a perfect light lunch or side dish to a nice soup. We skipped the watercress and didn't think it was lacking anything. Also tried adding a little ham, which worked very nicely. We would highly recommend trying this recipe!

Made this with a girlfriend of mine on 'baking day'. Couldn't find watercress, so we used arugula. We loved it. Her 'non-gourmet' husband even liked it. Don't know how the watercress would behave but we would chop the arugula next time for easier bite-taking. :)

I make these sandwiches regularly, but with sourdough and carmelized red onion instead of the watercress. (Believe it or not, it's a Weight Watcher's recipe -- use Pam instead of butter for the lower cal version.) Delicious!

Nice with really thin slices of apple. I prefer this dish with smoked bacon and fresh ground pepper.
