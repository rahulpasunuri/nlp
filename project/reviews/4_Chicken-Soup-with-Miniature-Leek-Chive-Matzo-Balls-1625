These matzo balls were delicious and a complete hit at my seder. I love the addition of the ginger and greens. My only regret was not making more! I used a small cookie scoop (2t) to portion them out and was able to get ~40 out of a double batch. They cooked up to a perfect size (1.5in? 2?).

Yum! I forgot to make them mini- I imagine they would've been better mini. I cooked mine right in the chicken broth. I think next time I will make homemade though.

First time making this, but certainly not the last. I added chicken and carrots. Made for a very nice meal. Great on a cold evening!

Made this for last night's dinner - everyone loved it. I usually make chicken stock myself (use the chicken for a salad). Didn't have ginger ale, so I used other soda. I would definitely try it again with the correct ingredients. http://wonderlandwithlove.blogspot.com/

This was great! Made my own broth. I think this was the second time I've made matzo balls. The first time they were huge and must not have been all that good as I didn't make them again. I will be using this recipe again. I served this for dinner one night with a salad.

This recipe is awesome, delicious, and unmessupable. I've done it with all different fats (margarine, butter, schmaltz) and aromatics (chives, tarragon, green onions, etc.). The matzo balls are always fluffy and flavorful no matter what!

These are exceptional-- the lightest, fluffiest and most flavorful matzoh balls I've ever had (much less made!). I made them for Passover this year and followed the recipe substituting freshly grated ginger for the powdered version with no adverse effect. The ginger ale is a quirky addition, but I think it really works. I've used seltzer in years passed, but there's something to the ginger-- the mixture bubbles like crazy when it's added. I suggest making these a day or two ahead to allow for ample cooling time, and minimal hassle on the day of serving. Boil in salted water (don't waste liquid gold on the boiling!), cool and refrigerate. Add to the broth to reheat and serve. Yum!

Wonderful! My husband claims these are the best Matzo Balls he's ever had! Didn't change enything in the recipe, except added some carrots, celery and some fresh spring onion to the soup.

would like to try this but there are no instructions for the chicken broth. Do these matzoh balls go well with traditional chicken soup (with dill, celery etc.)?

Wonderfully light and flavorful little knadelach - I could feel my nana kvelling from heaven as I prepared these yesterday for our Seder tomorrow night. I've doctored up 3 quarts of Trader Joe's organic chicken broth with the addition of simmered vegetables and shredded roast chicken breast. Taste tested the whole schmeer this afternoon - a mechayah.

This was my first try at matzo ball soup and it turned out great! Definitely a keeper. I doubled the recipe for a big seder and I probably should have used a few extra chives and maybe a little more ginger for a little more kick. But it was great as is!

Addendum: These do freeze well after completely cooled and placed in a container or zippered plastic freezer bag. Easy to take out for meals

I originally came across this recipe and decided to try it in an attempt to break away from some of the traditional items that have graced the Passover table in my family. I got great feedback both years from adults and children alike. The kids liked the matzo balls because they were nice and small. They serve well reheated as a side-dish for fish, chicken meals during Passover. I have made them during the High Holidays as well. A nice change from big "matzo bombs" I have followed the recipe pretty closely, but have made some of the following adjustments with great results: If not keeping Kosher, can use unsalted sweet butter. I like using more Leek than called for. I have used eggs and also Egg substitute with out an appreciable difference. I use Club soda in place of ginger ale. I have a small cookie dough scoop that makes it easy to make uniform balls. Also, for the calorie conscious, I performed some nutrient calculations on these (based on 48 matzo balls and 12- 4 ball servings using unsalted sweet butter). With eggs: Total recipe: ~1529 calories Per 4 ball serving: ~127 kcal Carbs/serving: 9 Pro/serving: 3.8 Fib/serving: 1.2 Fat/serving: 7.2 Satfat/serving: 4.2 With Egg substitute: Total recipe: ~ 1289 calories Per 4 ball serving: ~107 kcal Carb/serving: 9 Pro/serving: 3.1 Fib/serving: 1.2 Fat/serving: 7.2 Satfat/serving: 4.2

I've never made matzo ball soup before and was craving it! Thankfully I found this recipe!!! It was so delicious and so easy to make! I did make a few adjustments. First, I took the advise of another reviewer and bought a roasted chicken from Costco, took all the meat out and shredded them. Brought the carcass to a simmer with about 10 cups of broth and 2 cups of water. Added cut up carrots and chopped celery to the stock. After that, I followed the recipe as written. Oh, I didn't have ground ginger, so sub it with fresh grated ginger and sub scallions for chives. Adding the shredded chicken and vegetables definitely made this a very hearty meal! The matzo balls were fantatic! Oh, another thing, becauce of time, I also had to skip the second step of refrigerating the balls. Nevertheless, the matzo balls came out perfectly! Definitley a keeper!!!

OY these matzohs were fantastic! I did a lot of time-savers- bought a chicken from Costco, cut off the meat and boiled the carcass in organic chicken broth with carrots, celery, parsley, chives and leek. I made the matzohs according to directions but put the mix in the freezer for 45 mins. Because of poor planning, I didn't have time for the second rest in the frig. Just made them and put directly into boiling salted water. The result? My brother said they were better matzohs than the famous, local deli. Ginger ale, eh? I wonder how they would come out without it, but I wouldn't risk not having this perfection.

This was awesome. I didn't have any ginger... but didn't miss it at all. I added chicken, carrots, celery, and leek to the chicken broth (great way to use up the rest of the leek).

This recipe was my first attempt at matzo ball soup, and i had only eaten once before about 15 years ago and thought it was awful. But i had a request for it so i found this recipe and made it and now this is my most favorite chicken soup recipe. i added carrots and celery and small cubes of chicken, i am not sure if that is authenic, but it sure is good. i have made this over and over and it always turns out great.

It's my turn to make the matzo ball soup for Passover this year, so I made this soup in advance to test it. THIS IS THE BEST MATZO BALL RECIPE EVER!!! The matzo balls are the lightest I've ever had (sorry Mom) and it's so easy. I used kosher lemon/lime seltzer instead of ginger ale and I added diced carrots and celery to the soup. I can't wait to make this for the family on Passover.

I've made these Matzo Balls every year for the last 8+ years. They always come out nice and tender and because they are small, we like them better than the usual giant ones. The chives & leeks add a great flavor.

These mini matzo balls were delicious! To reduce the fat and calories, I omitted the margarine and sauteed the leeks in a spray of PAM, and used egg whites. My husband, who is not a great fan of dumplings, loved them. Will definately make again.

These matzo balls are superb. I made my own homemade stock with kosher chicken, and then added my vegetables the next day for the soup, and prepared the matzo balls to add to the finished soup. Wonderful and will definitely make these again!

Iam not kosher but have always loved matzo balls . The prep. for these is what has always been needed..i.e. refrigeration for half an hour..I did not have leeks or chives..nor did I use butter but added a dash of poultry seasoning....Unbelieveable!

I was making matzo balls for the first time for finicky eaters so I needed a good "basic" recipe. I had to substitute finely chopped onion instead of the leek for my finicky eaters. But I found that the recipe made a very light fluffy matzo ball that everyone raved over - a very good "basic" recipe even if you have to leave out the leek and chive.

The matzo balls came out very light and fluffy as other reviewers indicated (which is a huge improvement over the dense and heavy version) and they definitely had some taste into it (thanks to all the chives and leek). Still, if you're not a matzo balls fan that's only matzo balls...

The first time I made this I did not have any chives, so I made it with leeks only. Next time I used chives. I prefer the leek only version. I served both the packaged variety and my 'from scratch' version at passover sedar,(everyone did a taste comparison test). This recipe won hands down, they were light as a feather and just delicious. AND THEY SAY IT COULDN'T BE DONE! GREAT RECIPE.

I made this for our Passover seder in 1998 and it was a big hit. The chives and leeks added a good flavor. It reminded me of Chinese wonton or egg drop soup and had much more flavor than traditional recipes, yet it was still "traditional" enough. I will make it again this year.
