loved it, great to make for a casual summer dinner, the prep is not so casual....a little bit of time but you'll have happy guests.

This is a wonderful dish! Its complex flavors of acidic tomato sauce, creamy cheese pudding and parmigiano-reggiano cheese come together with the red bell peppers for a POP! I served this with delicious tiny chicken meatballs courtesy of Ina Garten and crusty Italian Boule bread. Dont let anyone tell you its an easy dish to prepare. It is time consuming but well worth the effort. I did a little creative cal-cutting. Used non fat "cream" and "non fat milk" to make the sauce. Also used low-fat ricotta to bulk up the "pudding" . Egg beaters instead of real egg. Perhaps I am fooling myself, and that is possible, but it was delicious.

This dish was very good, but I don't think the results warranted the amount of time it took to make. When I spend that kind of time on a dish I want it to be more unusual or interesting. If you're looking for a vegetarian dish for somewhat mainstream eaters - it is a good choice. One word of caution - check the vegetables before the alloted time for roasting. I just saved mine from being over-charred. And I thought the amount of sauce was just right. Wouldn't want to overpower the other veggies with the sauce. Finally, I did think it improved when reheated after a couple of days.

This recipe is excellent! I made it for a dinner party of 12 and everyone raved about it. A guest even thought there was meat in the dish. I doubled the recipe and made extra custard as the reviews suggested and I also added extra garlic and herbs to the sauce as I felt it was a little bland. The end results were fabulous! I can't wait to make it again!

This was great; well worth the time and energy. I made it for a potluck tonight and couldn't stop eating it. I actually thought the amount of sauce that the recipe called for was about right; I was working with an oddly-sized pan, so the veggies just barely fit. If I had tried to use as much sauce as the reviewers recommend, it would have spilled. With a bigger pan, I would use more custard in order to have a more layered dish. As it is, I've got sauce left over that's looking for a home...

Delicious - but, as others have noted, time consuming. Make 1.5x sauce (was great with soy milk) and roast all the veggies together to save time.

Rating: 4
I made this last night for my son's birthday. It was fantastic! There were only 4 of us so we have about 5/8 of it left. The only thing I would do is as some of the other reviewers say, make extra sauce. I would make 1.5 to 2 times the amount (ie. use 1 1/2 cups milk and 1 1/2 cups cream and 4-5 eggs depending on size plus the extra butter and flour). A bit of spice if your family likes spice would work too. It is time consuming but I roasted the eggplant and peppers in 4 pans in my double ovens and then grilled the zucchini on my Jennair to speed up the process. This is definitely a keeper and I think you can change it to vegan if need be.

Absolutely delicious. Zucchini, tomatoes & egg plant came from a neighbour's garden. The fresh herbs from mine. I followed the recipe exactly and I thoroughly enjoyed dinner. It took time to do make the components but worth the effort. I will make this again.

My husband and I made this for supper tonight, half quantities for everything, and we worked together so it did not take too much time - roasted all veggies at the same time, made the tomato sauce while the veggies cooked. We were short on parmiggiano so put some good Vermont cheddar in the cream sauce (made with milk, not cream). It was delicious, and enough for leftovers tomorrow night.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! I halved the veggie portion of recipe, but because of other reviews, kept the cheese sauce at full recipe (and used the real deal: Parmigiano Regiano). Would absolutely do the same the next time. Since we also have a large oven, I did all the veggies at the same time, taking 60 min of baking time down to 20. (We HATE overcooked veggies!) I'm sure we'll be fighting over the leftovers for tomorrow's lunch!

Truly wonderful and very easy, if time-consuming; I recommend roasting the veggies in advance if possible. (To be fair, I also prefer to roast eggplant until pretty crisp and brown.) I halved the entire recipe and for some reason ended up with a small quantity of thin, not custard-like, sauce. It didn't end up mattering, though, and I drizzled it sparingly on each layer I placed in a glass pie pan. The sage and thyme combination really bring the summery vegetables and rich sauce together, so definitely use sage; I had some once-fresh stuff that I had dried beforehand and used fairly large chunks of it. Use the best canned tomatoes possible, and cook the sauce down a lot if you want this not to be too runny. Mine came out very intact, and everybody mopped up their plates with bread.

Yes time consuming but homemade dishes take time to prepare. I am making it again for Thanksgiving, my mom says it tastes "gourmet"... Enjoy

Rating: 4
I did halve the recipe, but it was a big hit in our house. Definitely a keeper, and will be made many a time for our up coming summer months when eggplant and peppers are in season. I did make more sauce than called for, as per other reviews, and I`m glad I did, I really feel there would not have been enough to top the dish otherwise. Omitted sage as we had none. Can`t wait to try it out on my friends.

Rating: 1
This was far too rich for my tastes. Sure, the veggies tasted good, but I could have eaten them roasted straight out of the oven and been just as happy and had no stomach ache! I did add sauted fresh corn off the cob to the cream sauce, which i liked... but again, no need for the cream and cheese to make these local and fresh veggies taste delightful.

Rating: 4
This is an exceptional recipe. The flavors marry together even better than you'd expect. Yes, it is time consuming--this took me three hours. You can save a little time by making the tomato mixture and making the white sauce while roasting the vegetables. It is definitely a lot of work, but it is worth it.

Rating: 4
This is excellent especially the next day. I have made it exactly as written and loved it. 2nd time I made it, to save time I grilled the veggies and due to fat and cholestrol concerns used egg beaters and nonfat milk and it came out just as good as the full fat version (a little more egg then called for fluffed it up very nicely).

Rating: 3
This recipe is great. It is well worth the effort. It's not THAT time consuming if you prepare for the work such as chopping the veggie the night before.It's very filling. However, don't accidentally use whipping cream instead of heavy cream--it won't become a torte.

Rating: 3
This was a pretty good dish on the first day I made it. However, it was 100 times better when I heated it up over some linquine the following day. It was a little too mushy and watery on it's own for my taste. The pasta definitely helped it out. I also halved the recipe and baked it in a deep dish pie pan which worked perfectly. I did not follow the advice of others to add more custard and I thought that it turned out fine. Also, this is a great recipe to assemble now and bake later.

Rating: 4
This was unbelievable! My meat eating family looked at me like I was crazy, but even my 7 and 9 year old loved it! It is a bit time consuming, but after making it once, so much could be done ahead of time and prepare the custard right before assembled. This is definately a keeper!

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe. The flavors combine in a way that you would not expect. It was more time-consuming than I expected, so when I do it again, I will either do as a main dish or as a side with a very simple main dish. The parmigiano-reggiano adds so much flavor -- do not skimp and sub a regular parmesan, use a nicely aged cheese for this. Delicious and well worth the effort!

Rating: 2
Disappointed after reading all the rave reviews. My vegetarian guest enjoyed it though. Lots of prep time for a limited success.

Rating: 3
This is wonderful as written and I agree worth the effort. I think the red bell pepper should be roasted and then placed in a paper bag for 5 minutes to make peeling easier, not just placed on paper towel or buy the jar of roasted peppers. It is a winner, regardless.

Rating: 4
This is a superb combination of vegetables that seems like a cross between vegetarian lasagne without the pasta and moussaka... Absolutley no need to change ANY of the ingredients or quantities if you do what you're told. The best advice given by others here is to combine roasting the vegetables as much as possible to reduce prep time. Other then that, this is as good as it gets.

Rating: 4
This is an awesome vegetarian dish! I halved the recipe, because it's just two of us. It was plenty for dinner and lunch the next day. I agree with others, that it's better the next day. The tomato sauce is awesome: Make it! I had to stop my husband from sneaking some while I was assembling the torte! All in all, I did not find it too time consuming; it took about an hour, plus baking time. The baking time allows one to clean up the kitchen and set the table. I also roasted all of the vegetables at once, and used a jar of roasted red peppers. I can't wait to make this for my vegetarian friend!

Rating: 4
Thank goodness for the grill and bottled sauce. It still took some time. However, this is a great combination for an entree or side dish. And, yes, it's more flavorful the next day and even good cold.

This is not a quick, week-night meal. It is, however, fantastic for weekends. There ARE ways to make fixing this dish a little easier. I prepared the tomato sauce the morning of my supper party, which got it out of my way and gave it time for the flavors to settle in. I roasted the veggies all at once (or at least, as many as I could fit in my oven at once), and prepared the egg-cheese mixture while the veggies cooked. Also, I layered everything in individual dishes lightly sprayed with Pam (the disposable, tin dishes sold in the grocery store - they were out of round ones so I had to settle for the squares). After each little "loaf" was puffed and golden they were easy to spatula right out. I arranged all of them on a large serving plate and garnished it with fresh basil. I served this as a vegetarian meal with crusty bread, salad, sauteed mushrooms, and red wine. Dee-licious!

We'll be making this again! Tastes better than similar recipes we've tried. I think it would be good as a side dish with a simple grilled meat.

Rating: 3
Really delicious. I followed the recommendation to increase the custard by 1/3, but I actually thought it came out a little custard heavy as a result, without as much of the tomato sauce flavor. Next time, I'll follow the recipe as is. Also, even with the extra custard, it still fit easily into a 3-qt dish--no need to use a larger one.

Rating: 3
Very impressive looking and tastes great. Even taste good leftover. Be sure to leave plenty of time between cooking and serving so that it has time to firm up and can be cut more easily.

Loved the recipe. Instead of all of the roasting in the oven, I did all of the veggies on a very hot grill. I started with the red peppers and charred them black. Rub them under running cold water to remove the char, and then slice them. All of the veggies can be done at one time on a large grill. I know, leave it to a guy to find one more way to use his grill.

Rating: 3
Very, very good. Mine is a little dryer than I would like... next time I will use more tomatoes and fresh ones instead of canned. I also would increase the amount of peppers, zuchini and custard, I had to spread everything a little thin to fill the pan. Excellent recipe though, very tasty.

We're not veggetarian, but was craving a veggie main dish. This is AWESOME! Used a combo of peccorino-romano and fontina cheese, also added some red wine to the tomato concoction. Hope the leftovers are as good as the first night, as I cut in half for two, but still have enough left over for another dinner and a half. Served with a nice merlot, caesar salad and garlic bread. YUMMERS!

Made this recipe exactly as written (I did peel the red peppers though) as the main course for a vegetarian dinner party. It was awesome, probably the best vegetarian dish I've ever made. I didn't think it was that time consuming - I made the tomato sauce and prepped the custard while roasting the veggies. I think it's important to cook the tomato sauce long enough so that the flavor gets really concentrated. A great make-ahead party dish since it reheats well.

Rating: 4
Great dish was a popular comment at a recent dinner party. I made it for a couple of vegetarians at the party but it also went over very well with everyone else. I took the suggestion of increasing the custard by 1/3, and also the recipe doesn't mention removing the skins from the peppers after roasting which is very important. Will be making this again soon, since I only got to taste about 1 tbsp. of it.

This was an excellent dish. A great way to use up extra zuchinni from the garden. Takes a little time, but is very easy to make. Bake all veggies together. While veggies are baking, make sauce to save on time. I've made several times, great reheated next day.

A decadent vegetarian meal -- so good! I agree with the previous reviewer that it is vital to get the moisture out of the vegetables. Also, each layer should be adequately seasoned. The only drawback to this recipe is the number of pans to wash: roasting pans, saute pans, casserole dish, etc. I subbed basil for the sage - (and loved it) and Asiago for the Parm (and also loved it).

Rating: 4
This was a great dish!! I didn't feel as though it was that much effort: It really doesn't have to take all day to make it: First cut the veggies. Put them in to roast while making the onion/tomato mix. While that cools, make the custard. Pull the veggies out of the oven and cool them while the custard cools down. Then assemble and bake the torte while you clean up! It took me about an hour all together. Totally worth it! It's a great do-ahead dish, great served room temperature... great for picnics at the beach or on the boat. You can make it the day before, and refrigerate. You Pull it out of the fridge a few hours before serving, or just pop it into the oven and serve hot. p.s.: The second time I made it, I did increase the custard quantity by about 1/3 based on another reviewer's suggestion, and felt this was even better tasting!

This was very very good. A couple of notations I made on my copy of the recipe: 1. If you have a couple of ovens, roast all the veg in big pans at once. Just keep an eye to see which are cooking quicker. Don't cut veg too thick or over-roast them. I cooked the peppers long enough to skin them. Make sure to drain all veg well or you'll have too much liquid in final product. 2. I could have used more custard to cover all the veg I had. Next time I'll increase egg+milk mixture by 1/3, and maybe cut down the cheese a little. It easily fed 8 with another side dish.

This was a HUGE hit at my dinner party. A bit resource-intensive, as there is a lot of prep work, and many steps. Don't be anal when roasting the veggies, as I was- it doesn't have to brown etc.- just bake for the time noted. But it was definitely worth the work. Just leave yourself enough time

I was looking for an eggplant parmesan recipe that my eggplant-hating husband might like, and boy, this was it! He said it was 1000 times better than eggplant parmesan and I must agree, it was very tasty (I notice that it comes from an English restaurant and my husband is English. He loves eggs and I think that's what did it for him!). I halved the amount for the two of us. I didn't have squash but didn't miss it. But I wished I added more eggplant...I'll remember for next time. Great meal!

Rating: 3
Yummy! I cut the recipe in half to make a smaller amount, and there was still quite a bit leftover. I used yellow summer squash in place of the zucchini. I roasted the eggplant and squash together and used jarred roasted peppers. This cut down the prep time drastically. It was delicious and, to me, tasted better the next day after allowing the flavors to blend. Would definitely make it again.

"What wimps!" I thought, as I read the comments for this recipe. "Not worth the work?!?! Time consuming?? hmmph! They must not be REAL cooks like me. I LAUGH in the face of time consuming. . .and this recipe sounds FABULOUS!" And so I began. But you were right. The resulting dish is NOT worth the time consumed to make it (and I love spending hours in the kitchen cooking) -- there are THOUSANDS of recipes in this collection that are superior to this one. And the longer I work on a recipe, the better I expect it to taste. . .I was disappointed. Use these same ingredients in a different dish that will do them justice.

Eggplant parmesan is one of my absolute favorites- the custard added a whole new delicious dimension. I used my single huge eggplant from my garden and salted it before roasting to "sweat" out any bitterness. I also used yellow squash and a handful of fresh herbs, including lots of basil. I added roasted yellow peppers, and baked several single-layer tortes in individual ramekins. I'll make it again as soon as I have the time...

I have made this recipe several times because it is a hit in my house. To make the preparation a bit less onerous, I sometimes make it in stages; one night I roast the vegetables, storing them on a plate,covered in the refridgerator, and the next night I make the tomato sauce and the custard and assemble and bake. I have also prepared it ready for baking and then refridgerated it overnight and baked it for dinner guests the next day.
