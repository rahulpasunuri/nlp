The previous reviewer's comment about not stirring is correct. In addition. You can also rub the cut side of a lemon around the inside of the pan before adding the ingredients. Works every time and doesn't affect the taste.

Love this recipe. Took advice from fellow reviewers, thanks everyone! Turned out splendid.

I havent made this but the reviewer that said that the caramel was grainy was because water was added or overcooked is not correct. the reason is because sugar cant be stirred when it is cooking, until it gets to the caramel stage. it will crystalize, which is what happened to the previous reviewer.

when caramel turns grainy it's generally because it got wet or it's been overboiled. Also, the first reviewer probably didn't use grade B maple syrup.

I'm not sure what happened with the other reviewer's experiment - mine turned out wonderfully creamy, thick and quite maple-ish, with a twist - and not a bit gritty! Sounds like previous reviewer didn't cook it correctly as the sugar should have dissolved quickly and easily. I've been looking for this recipe for a couple of years - a wonderful little local cafe uses this with strawberry and blueberry romanoff on top of challah-bread french toast. Yummy. (Toppings are dribbled over toast in stripes w/the maple/caramel in the middle).

What a waste of my fabulous Massachusetts maple syrup -- a nasty, greasy, grainy mess, and zero maple flavor. Ugh.
