delicious! we cooked a 700 kg / 1.5 lb fish in a dutch oven for 27 min. the fish was absolutely divine - so moist and basically the right amount of rare in the very centre. lightly sprinkled water on the top of the salt before cooking, per a suggestion through BBC online.

i've been looking for a recipe to take the fear out of cooking whole fish, and this did it. wonderfully simple, i wouldn't even call this a recipe, but a lesson for how to get people to get the most out of a fish without over-complication.

I just baked two beautiful dorade night before last and am again amazed at how simple, flavorful and magical this cooking method is. Other than squeezing lemon juice into the olive oil for serving, I wouldn't change a thing. Wonderful.

I find the salt crust works much better when mixed with a few egg whites. The texture is more like wet sand that hardens and peels off without too much salty transfer to the fish. Check the recipe here for salt-baked branzino (a divine recipe) to get the proportions.

Delish! I did exactly as the recipe called for and added some pink himalaya salts as well. I also cooked it for 30 minutes instead of 25 b/c usually the head of the fish takes a little bit longer to cook then the tail. Next time I am going to use only the pink himalaya salts b/c they are so tasty! I also used a huge rockfish and put it on a bakng sheet. After cutting the meat out, I used some of the meat for fish tacos. I warmed some torillas, stuffed it with fish, squeezed lemon and added some cilantro. YUM!

Excelent recipe, I stuffed the whole fish with parsley, onions, garlic slices and lemon slices. The drizzling of olive oil at the end is key to elevate the natural flavors of the fish. Next time will cut baking time to 20 minutes instead of 25, i believe it would have been better with 5 minutes less.

This was not a winner. We found it too salty. I used rock salt specifically because I thought it would be easier to remove, but it wasn't, and even on the pieces with no salt left, the meat was just too salty.

Had trouble with this. Used a red snapper and a striped bass and baked them in the same dish; as other reviewers mentioned, some of the salt formed chunks and came off easily, but the "non-chunked" salt rained down onto the fish. Even as a ardent lover of salt, found this too salty, although others didn't. As another reviewer pointed out, it doesn't look like much on the plate, as you're left with a pile of flaky fish meat run through with little bones. Overall, not impressive; I won't make it again, until I can get a Mediterranean master over here to show how to get this right!

I made this for our non-turkey Thanksgiving dinner and it was delicious! I've always used kosher salt for the salt crust and I blend 2 egg whites into the salt mixtures to help it form a tight seal on the fish. I cooked a couple of black sea bass and a porgy. Both came out exceptionally moist with just a hint of salt flavor. I also add a lemon to the fish's cavity which helped to keep the fish moist and tender! So easy, yet it looks so impressive!

Delicious! I prepared a 2 1/2 lb. river trout and cooked it for 32 min. instead of 25--came out perfect. Served it with creamy grits, roasted summer vegetables, spinach peach salad, and homemade blueberry sherbert. A perfect summer meal!

This is so easy to do! Easy enough for a weeknight dinner even. We did two trout together in one roasting pan, a regular trout and a golden trout. We cooked it for 30 minutes and it was perfect, flaky, moist, and delicate. It goes well with a buerre blanc sauce or an aurora sauce. It's impressive to serve at the table, but fairly unexciting on the plate. Garnish would be a good idea, and serve it with an interesting side or salad to dress up the presentation.

For as easy as it was to make, this was really good. It also looks great when you serve it.

Baked 2 - 2lb whole fish for 20 minutes following the recipe. The fish were moist and very easy to serve. I was afraid that the salt would spill onto the flesh while I was serving, but no problem - it stayed crusty. It was very helpful to watch the "Serving Fish" video offered on this site, which made it so much neater and easier to serve.

Very simple and elegant. The bay leaves are a must - they add a wonderful subtle flavor to the dish. I was intrigued when taking the fish out of the oven. They looked like they were buried in snow.

I made this with whole Porgy and Striped Bass at the same time - for a party of 5. I placed them side by side and added chopped garlic and olive oil to the peppercorns stuffed inside the fish. The fish came out tasty and moist. Everyone loved it! I served it with an Ethiopian vegetable stew. The two seemed to go together well.

A classic way of preparing fish in Italy. The fish should, of course, be right out of the sea fresh, otherwise, it's not worth it. Also, there is a big difference between natural, wild fish and those from fish nurseries. The wild fish are worth the increased price. Most important for this recipe, have the fishmonger gut the fish, but don't remove the scales. The skin with the scales on makes a tighter seal and is reasier to remove for serving. Garnish with a good, fruity extra virgine olive oil, not one that has been overly refined.

Amazing recipe! My Spanish husband did it with nothing else but sea bass,coarse salt and a squeeze of lemon on the fish before covering it with salt. Served it with baked potatoes, tomatoes and onions, drizzled with olive oil. Exceptionally healthy and delicious!

this was an easy preparation. very simple flavor, moist, obviously best with the freshest of fish. some may wish for more herbs or flavors, but very nice. fun to do.

Very good. I had patted the fish (sea bass) dry, which was a mistake as it made it more difficult for the salt to stick to. Forgot the bay leaves for the bottom of the fish but remembered them for the top, and they added a nice flavor. I stuffed the middle of the fish with parsely and thyme. Hard getting the salt off! The big pieces came off okay but there were smaller ones that were more difficult to get rid of without the salt going into the fish itself. But overall very successful, and fun.

Simple, easy and delicious. This is a wonderful way to cook whole fish and even my husband and kids (who normally don't like fish) enjoyed this.

My husband and son said this is the way I should make whole fish from now on! They really liked the golden trout I cooked. The fish was 2 1/4 pounds and I cooked it for 35 minutes and let it sit in the hot oven for 10 minutes more. The fish was probably cooked at 35 minutes and it was moist and tasty, but not salty. You know salt has been added, however. I used kosher salt and increased the spices according to the weight of my fish. This is a simple, yet delicious recipe.

I've had the dish a few times in Provence where it is referred to as "cout de sel" or salt crust. The restaurants use a fish shaped mold for the salt so it comes out of the oven in a fish shape. A big production is made of removing the salt and fileting the fish at the table.
