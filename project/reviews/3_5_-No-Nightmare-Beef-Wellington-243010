I probably should have given 2.5 forks, but my gripe with this dish was that the sauce was so sweet and powerfully vinegary it overwhelmed all the other flavors. Next time I would double the pate and make it without the sauce.

Great recipe! Using the correct cut of meat is key. The tenderloins from Costco would work well too. The reduction / sauce is fantastic, really really delicious. I chose to nix the pate and put the wilted spinach on top of the steak then drizzle the reduction...yummy. Served with rosemary roasted potatoes and green bean casserole (fresh green beans of course!)

amazing!! i made this for a dinner party, at the last minute i decided to go the traditional route, and went en croute.. but knowing that i had a simpler option gave me the courage to try this dish which had daunted me for years. a note... being unable to uncork the wine for the reduction, i substituted pomegranate juice, along with the balsamic and sugar... it MADE the dish! now i only have to explain to my family where this dish has been all their lives! thank you!!!

I probably over-reduced the sauce. The result was similar to molasses -too sweet for my tastes. It also hardened once it hit the plate and cooled. I would be inclined to reduce the sugar and keep the sauce more dilute, thinning with red wine if necessary.

Its always been my dream to make Beef Wellington, but I've never had the guts to make it. This recipe was perfect! It was a great twist on the original Beef Wellington, and even though there were many steps to make it, it was worth it!

I recently made this dish for my family and it was a big hit. I left out the pate since my family doesn't like it and the result was still fabulous. I would make this again for sure!

Although I did like this recipe, I found it to be far from no nightmare. It took me a very long time to make and it wasn't at all an enjoyable process. I loved the red wine/vinegar reduction but will not be making this again - it felt as complex as making the original Beef Wellington.

This recipe was good,providing you like all of the ingredients because they are all flavorful.I know that sounds kind of silly, but each taste is strong and distinct. You will have leftover duck liver/mushroom mixture, especially if you don't prefer the overpowering taste of pate. Be very careful with the vinegar sauce because if you let it sit for too long it will harden to candy.... so drizzle quickly. I used mini puff pastry shells, dabbed a bit of the pate mixture on each one, and topped it with a cube of cooked filet. I drizzled the balsamic on top and it looked awesome.

Excellent dish. I made this for dinner parties twice with rave reviews from everyone. Tried to do it one time as a Beef Wellington using a chateaubriand and that was not as good- probably my fault in some of the prep

Sorry Tuscon had a problem...maybe the heat was too high? I made this tonight and got RAVE reviews from the guests! An EXCELLENT deconstructed version of Beef Wellington. The duxelle and pate mix would make a great appetizer! The red wine/balsamic sauce will be so good on other meats! And the roasted veggies and creamed onions were SOOOO good! You really should try this for a special meal!

no forks! I have just made the sauce and it is burned. I am very disappointed!

I watched Kelsey Nixon & Shane Lyons during their television presentation of this recipe. They worked well together and I will try their recipes for my next guest dinner. They were the most positive and inspiring of the three presentations. The recipes are definitely "no Nightmare". Thank you.
