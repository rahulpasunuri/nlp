My Husband 'loved' this and I 'liked' it. I used Kirschwasser {cherry liquer} because thats all I had on hand. We served each peach along with some of it's liquid and also drizzled with some cream for a 'peaches and cream' effect in leu of vanilla ice cream because we had none in the freezer. My Husband loved it and he's not usually a fan of any stewed fruit.

Excellent!!! My non-peach loving boyfriend licked his plate. The only thing I added was a little bit of nutmeg. Definately a keeper!

Verrrry tasty! Used firm thickly sliced nectarines and then finished with a tablespoon of Grand Marnier. I 've been nipping away at the finished but still warm fruit and hope that there will be enough to serve tonight. Absolutely lovely and works well with less than perfectly ripe fruit.

This was very good, and easy, although next time I think I will try it with Amaretto. Did this with the Pistachio Blancmanges, as suggested, but didn't find the flavors that compatible. I will serve them separately in the future.

Being a peach lover this recipe was perfect! The sauce was divine!
