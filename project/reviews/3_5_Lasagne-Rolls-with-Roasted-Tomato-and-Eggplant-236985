I really liked the sauce and have been adding some egg plant to tomato sauce more often because of this recipe. I thought the ricotta filling was too nutmeggy, though. I used excellent ricotta but all I tasted was eggnog...yuck. This is my problem, I bet, but I am a pretty good cook but can never seem to boil lasagna noodles without them all sticking together. I've tried many suggested tricks... does anyone else have this problem? Any solutions?

These rolls were delicious. My husband requested that I make them again.

This was great. I actually used no-boil noodles and had no problem. I also have made the sauce and used with penne / other chunky pasta with great success - I put the ricotta mixture in the end. If you make with regular tomatoes instead of plum, use the juice instead of the water. If you roast the tomatoes and eggplant the day before, the reheat time will be longer.

Too basic. Needs more flavour. Rolling the lasagna is a cool idea but with just ricotta and tomatoes, it doesn't hit home hard enough. The nutmeg is a nice touch but the 4 cloves of garlic is a false move. With a bit of flair and additions, it could be turned into a great recipe (addition of fresh herbs, another cheese, etc) but as it stands it is a dissapointment. The photo is also not for this recipe so don't be fooled.

Excellent. Added chopped basil to the ricotta mixture to give it more life. Next time, I will deglaze the roasting pan with wine rather than using water in the sauce.

Very, very good. I served this with Marcella Hazen's grilled shrimp to a very pleased crowd. Easy as well. The only change (sorry purists) is that I made the ricotta myself (the Homemade Fresh Ricotta recipe on this site). Other than that, I followed the recipe. My friend went home and soon thereafter made the recipe for her bookclub, where it was a hit as well.

First of all, the photo attached to this recipe is incorrect. It is for a different recipe from the same article. This dish was pretty yummy. I'll need to make it again with a few changes. The ricotta mixture needs more "something" maybe just salt. The nutmeg was a nice note. I think I would add in some more tomato sauce to the sauce part as it seemed a bit dry for my preference. But, very good overall.
