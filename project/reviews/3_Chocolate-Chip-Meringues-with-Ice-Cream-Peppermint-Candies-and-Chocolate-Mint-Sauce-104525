My kids didn't like this either, as another reviewer mentioned--even too sweet for them. The sauce was excellent.

My family thought this was excellent.I used very dark chocolate (Guittard 72% cacao) and this kept it from being too sweet.We did not put the candies on top.We are using the leftover bittersweet chocolate sauce on peppermint ice cream post- Christmas and it is just superb.

Too sweet for us and weird combination of textures.

I too, added the green food coloring (thanks for that tip) and they were so festive for Christmas. They melt in your mouth and are so decadent. A true holiday dessert to become a tradition for our home.

This recipe is pretty to look at, but ugh! Absolutely too sweet with the combination of meringues, ice cream, fudge sauce, then candy. I even served it to kids who didn't like it. The adults could only take a few bites--and I'm someone who doesn't find much too sweet!

Made this for dessert last Christmas Eve for my family, including 4 young men between 19 and 28. They couldn't get enough, especially of the meringue (surprisingly) and chocolate sauce (not surprisingly). The meringue would be good just as light cookies if made smaller. I added a drop of green food coloring to the meringue just for eye appeal. A very nice, casual holiday dessert.
