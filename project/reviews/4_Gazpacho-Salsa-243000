I have prepared this salsa several times. I always get compliments on it. I do not consider it bland. If spicey hot salsa is what you want than do try something else. But, I have found that for large family gatherings, it provides a fresh taste that can be enjoyed by all.

The Gazpacho Salsa is a delious recipe that is not labor intensive at all, if you have good quality knives to work with. This recipe was well thought out. The flavors all blend wonderfully. So, I would recommend following the recipe as is. This salsa can be enjoyed as a side for a casual meal at home or hit at any social gathering. But within saying that; My husband and I have even made the salsa using Sweet Hungarian Paprika, Door County Oilere Cherry Balsamic Vinegar, and minusing the cucumbers. That little twist in the salsa recipe, has us enjoying it as a topping on warm butternut squash for a wonderful fall meal. Enjoy!

Lots of chopping time involved. Although it is good, I'll only do this again if I have either lots of help in the kitchen or lots of extra time.

Labor intensive with all the careful dicing of ingredients and I had mixed reactions to the salsa. Added some Worcestershire sauce and a small can of tomato juice. Added avocado and shrimp and drizzled with lime juice. White wine, breadsticks, what a nice dinner. Might do it again if I feel like devoting 1 hour + to prepping.

I made this for a beach picnic and it was VERY popular! I served it as bruschetta and it was a hit. The smoky paprika really added to the flavor.

Cilantro! Without it this is bland, with it - fantastic. I served thiss as an appetizer in martini glasses, with fried tortilla strips, wowed the guests. Oh, and I nixed the olives.

This was a big hit! Light and refreshing. I added grilled shrimp and diced avacado to the leftover salsa and served as a main dish the next day.

A bit of preparation to chop everything but definitely a hit as I had many people ask me for the recipe after a party.

A fabulous array of flavors -- crisp and hearty, with just the right bite from the olives and vinegar. Makes a fabulous pasta salad when tossed with some rotini.

Fresh flavors and simple preparation. Used it as a condiment for fajitas. Would suggest reducing the salt to a half teaspoon since the olives impart a unique and salty flavor by themselves.

pureed salsa and simmered talapia in it covered for 5-6 minutes as suggested. It was really great. Will try bruschetta with what's left.

I've made this twice and continue to enjoy it. First time I did not have the smoked parprika so added a few drops of liquid smoke and used new mexico paprika.

Loved it!

I made this for my book club. Everyone loved it. I agree that it wouldn't be the same without the spanish paprika. We ate it with tortilla chips, but I love the idea of bruschetta. We will do that next time. And believe me, there will be a next time!

Forgot to mention. I used Nicoise olives instead of Kalamata because I prefer them. I imagine it would be great either way.

Yum!! This salsa disappeared very quickly. I can't wait to make it again. Smoked paprika is amazing and really makes this dish. I found some at the Spanish Table in Santa Fe. It has the word "fume" on it. I don't think it would be as good without, though a combo of chipotle powder and paprika might be OK. It needs that smokiness to set it apart.
