Excellent. Try using a star shaped biscuit/cookie cutter and serve split with strawberries and/or raspberries and blue berries and whipped cream for a lovely July 4th shortcake! Leftover reheated biscuits are excellent with jam too!

Amazing flavor & texture - love these! I used the food processor to combine the dry ingredients & work in the butter, then mixed in the wet stuff in a bowl. Worked great, and wasn't too sticky to knead lightly. Chilled it for a few minutes before kneading/cutting. Lots of ingredients (4 cups flour seemed a lot to me too), but worth the effort! Froze most of them unbaked for later.

The dough was a little sticky, but these biscuits were worth the trouble. They had a nice flavor and were a little lighter in texture than most biscuits. I used 2 teaspoons of cinnamon (rather than the 1/2 teaspoon called for in the recipe).

I had the worst time with this recipe - the dough was so extremely sticky that it was a mess trying to do anything with it. In the end, I ended up just dropping 1/4 c. fulls of the dough onto the cookie sheets. I also sprinkled them with cinammon sugar, rather than just sugar. They taste great, but are a little unsightly!

I have made this several times in the past few months, for my biscuit-crazy roommates and non-Southern guests who aren't used to good biscuits. (It's almost embarassing above the Mason-Dixon line with this delicacy. What good is a French culinary background, really, if you can't make a good biscuit?) Using a cup and a half of buttermilk or soymilk instead of yoghurt yields excellent results, as does adding the sugar as the very last ingredient, in a second knead. (Here you have to be careful not to knead too much before you add it, though.) This way the sugar doesn't incorporate as much into the dough and when it bakes on the pan, the bottoms caramelize. It's a beautiful thing.

No - cake flour and self-rising flour are 2 different things (as are bread flour, all-purpose flour, etc.)

Is cake flour the same as self raising flour?

Thanks to the reviewer that clarified the "sugar" issue! These are great...but do yourself a favor and read the reviews first!

We love these biscuits! We serve them with mixed berries and a dollup of whipped cream. A great a dessert in the summer. I also use 2/3 cup of sugar.

I really liked these. I loved them in the heart shapes. It seemed weird to me that they required four cups of flour. I made them in the morning before work and I put 2/3 cup sugar in them instead of 1/8 (quite a difference) but it didnt seem to make any difference-they were still good. Of course they were delicious with butter on them (everything is -why IS that??) but would have been good without too. I think they could have been cinnamon-ier-I think next time I'll put more cinnamon in. Nevertheless these biscuits made me want to open my own bed and breakfast so that I could make them for my guests!

The recipe in the magazine calls for 2/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
