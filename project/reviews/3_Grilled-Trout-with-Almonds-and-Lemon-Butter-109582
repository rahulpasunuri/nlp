I thought this recipe was terrific. I used parsley because I didn't have mint.

Something get's lost in this recipe. I might suggest pan frying this instead of grilling to not lose the lemon butter. I did not like this recipe.

Good fresh trout has a delicate flavor that doesn't need to get buried under lemon, garlic, mint and almonds. I think I'll stick to delicately sauteed trout when I have a very nice fresh piece.

I accidently bought Steelhead trout instead of salmon (it looked like salmon). I never cooked trout before so I decided to try this recipe. I didn't have any fresh mint so I used fresh parsley instead and about 1 tsp of dried mint. It was fabulous! Very easy. Huge hit. And nothing bland about it (that person must have forgotten the garlic or something). Am now a fan of trout and will defintely make again.

This recipe was very good. The only fish my kids will eat is salmon, but they even ate and liked this recipe. However, the mint did not add a whole lot to the flavor. I used a fish cage for grilling which worked perfectly.

This was great, but mostly because we started with great fish: mountain trout. The recipe itself wasn't too surprising. Buy local, buy fresh, and you won't go wrong.

In total agreement with the cook from Barnesville, MD - this dish is extremely bland. I won't be making it again.

This recipe is perfect. You have to do it on the grill, and you have to use the mint. The mint gives it a "fresh" flavor that is special. I would use a little more, in fact. Trout can occasionally taste bland or "muddy"; the mint elevates it in this recipe. The person who used this recipe with haddock is a neophyte, at best. (I was actually thinking of another word.)

Even though I didn't follow the recipe exactly, it proves that simple is best. I used haddock, cooked it in a fry pan on medium high heat, and did not use the mint. Butter, lemon and almonds is the perfect compliment to any fish. Excellent. Makes me wonder why I go to any other trouble when something so easy tastes so good.

I did this last night and got rave reviews! A nice and easy way to prepare trout. The grilling really adds a great dimension to the taste. Will do this again!

My husband came home today, after a day of fishing, with three beautiful rainbow trout. I prepared this recipe and we both decided it was "a keeper". It was the perfect subtle enhancement to our fresh fish. The next time he's a successful fisherman I'll use the recipe again.

I thought this dish was fantastic. I forgot the almonds until jsut now, however, and I'm sad that I did. I served it on a bed of asparagus, spinach, and shitake mushrooms. Definitely a hit.

Made as per recipe. Cut ingredients in half for two. Bland, Bland, Bland. Needs help to perk it up. Mint and lemon just didn't come through.

My girlfriend and I made this during the week and we were surprised at how quick and easy it was. I don't usually like nuts in my dishes, but the almonds added a wonderful change of pace in terms of texture. We choose to use chives in lieu of the mint. Quick and delicious, I definitely recommend.
