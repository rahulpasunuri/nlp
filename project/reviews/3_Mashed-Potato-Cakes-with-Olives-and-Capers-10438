I made this dish using leftover mashed potatoes and the potatoes were almost impossible to handle. I tried chilling them in the freezer and that seemed to help form the cakes. However, the cakes themselves had an odd taste. I would not reccomend this. I could have fried old sneakers and they might have tasted better.

A little on the bland side. I feel this dish could easily use twice the amount of capers and olives for a better flavour. Serving capers for each person to add on top as they wished helped, but next time I would definately double, or even triple, the caper/olive amounts.
