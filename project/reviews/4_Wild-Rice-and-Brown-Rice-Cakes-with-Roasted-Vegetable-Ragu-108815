Great tips! I chilled and cut into 12 portions as suggested and it worked great. I used chevre instead of mozzarella because that's what I had. Yum! :)

The best way I have found to make the cakes hold together is the following: after cooking, spread the rice out on a cookie sheet or foil-lined cutting board and use a spatula to smooth the sides and top of the rice. Let it sit until cool. Then take a knife or pizza cutter and cut the rice into manageable squares (3" or so worked for me), dredge them in the bread crumbs (using more than the recommended amount makes the process easier) and cook. I used to try and form them into round cakes after letting the rice cool, but the square method is so much faster and less messy. (Also, you can make the rice as directed or you can just add the wine, boil, and add all the broth at once. I didn't notice a difference - do be conservative with the broth, though - you might not need that much liquid.)

This was very good! I didn't read the reviews first and had a hard time getting the patties to hold together - I will try putting the rice in the fridge next time. I ended up making smaller patties, like most other reviewers, as there was no way I was going to get a 3.5" patty to hold together. I also had way too much liquid and had to boil it off for about 20-30 minutes. The ragout was great; I used the tomato juices and less than 1C of veg broth, as the full amount just didn't seem necessary. I wasn't sure it would work; I thought the fennel seemed a bit out of place, but everything melded together quite well (I managed to completely forget the mushrooms, though!). I also roasted the veggies for less time, and finished on the stove (added tomato and zucchini and simmer). I didn't roast the garlic, as I was worried it would burn, so I started the pot off with some minced garlic, then adding the tomatoes and veggies.

Takes a LONG time to make, but it's worth it - this recipe is delicious, beautiful, and extremely unique.

Good flavors, but definitely make the cakes smaller--they are unwieldy and break apart very easily when large. Also, I recommend chilling the rice before trying to make the cakes; it's easier to work with when colder. Finally, don't add the broth to the veggies. With the tomato juice alone it took a while to thicken.

We made the rice cakes without the ragu as a meatless alternative for my vegetarian daughter on Thanksgiving. She still wanted traditional veggies, so we didn't need yet another veggie dish. I made 12 smaller cakes - had to double the breadcrumb mix for that. Everyone tried them and loved them! No problem with the patties sticking together, but I took the advice and chilled it before making the patties and then again after. Warmed up the leftovers in the microwave the next day - added a little cheese to melt on top. Still delicious! This will now be a regular dish at our house. Not just for T Day.

This tasted good, but just took too much time and effort. Leftovers were good in a pita pocket the next day. Even though I won't make this again, it does inspire me to use the recipe for a yummy risotto and just stop short of making it into patties.

Excellent!! We roasted the vegetables for only 40 minutes in the first step instead if 60 minutes, and added only about one cup of vegetable broth to the vegetables.

We all loved these, I even froze them. Other reviews did suggests making them smaller, which was the only way it worked for me. When I reheated the cakes I served them with pineapple cranberry sauce with chiles and cilantro (Epicurious), also with a specialty store bought Raspberry Chipotle! so so good and different!

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner. A couple of notes: definitely chill the mixture both before and after making the cakes. Also, get creative with the ragu vegetables -- we opted for sweet potato, fennel bulb, parsnip, pomegranate seeds, d'anjou pears, and fingerling potatoes. We baked it with dollops of honey and pesto butter, and a cup of veg broth at 425 for 45 minutes.

Lovely. As mentioned by New England, the cakes freeze well. I cooked the rice while prepping another meal and then made and froze the cakes the next morning. The 2nd time around, I made the cakes half again as small (a total of 12 cakes rather than 6; this requires a little extra of the breadcrumb/ parmesan mix) -- they held together better and had more crust. Skipped the ragu, and paired the cakes with the roasted vegetables with tarragon recipe on this site -- delicious. Any roasted, grilled vegetable or a hearty salad would be a great combo.

Loved it and didn't expect to. My vegetarian guest liked it, but my husband who turned his nose up at the name of the dish was the biggest fan. If you don't like root veggies, you won't like the ragout, but I loved it. The tip on chilling mixture completely, then chilling patties worked because I had no problem getting them to hold together. They also froze VERY well. I simply unthawed and proceeded with cooking instructions.

THe rice cakes are great. Not crazy about the ragu. Next time i will serve them with veggies of my own.

This is a very good recipe. The crispy outside and creamy inside of the rice patties is very unique and works well with the bold flavors of the ragu. Modifications: I added a sweet potato to the ragu and some chili flakes to the rice mixture. The rice patties worked for me, as I made them the day before. As other reviewer mentioned, the key is to completely chill the rice mixture before forming patties, probably didn't hurt that I chilled them after as well.

I haven't made this recipe but since it is similar to my grandmother's rice ball recipe I thought I would share a helpful hint: Completely cool the rice mixture before forming into cakes. This, along with chilling the cakes after they are formed, should help them stay together. Hope this helps!

The TASTE of this recipe is wonderful, a very nice risotto type of dish, however my patties didn't hold their shape. It also made 12 patties and I couldn't put bread crumbs on them until they had been chilled and then just could only sprinkle it on. I thought that the saute might help them stay together but it did not. I perhaps needed to add breadcrumbs to the rice mixture to help bind it.
