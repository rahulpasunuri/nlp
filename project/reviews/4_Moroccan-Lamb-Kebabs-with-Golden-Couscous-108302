Disappointing - it turned out rather bland, even though I followed the recipe and even added preserved lemons from Morocco. If I were to try it again, I would double all the spices.

Made just the lamb ( no couscous). I skipped the red onions and apricots as I served with a different fruited couscous. After marinating for most of day, this lamb was excellent! Fantastic flavor on the spices. Everyone from my husband ( who does not like lamb ) to my 9 year old loved this. Even if you think you don't like lamb, you've got to try this!

Made this as a thank-you-gift for my sister-in-law who is an amazing cook so the crowd was tough, but won over by this meal (served with the recommended Coucous dish). I used Turkish apricots and grilling them was a surprise and a delight.

Delicious and beautiful. The apricots are like little discs of yum! I appreciate that they put the onions on separate skewers since they always take longer to grill. Next time I make this I'm going to try grilling the lamb as a whole roast rather than kebabs.

The marinate was fantastic for the lamb, and I used on chicken as well, which was also great. The apricots were good, but I think the onions would need to be cut much smaller to cook fully at a reasonable rate.

Awesome! I replaced the lemon rind with diced preserved lemons, which I think added terrific flavor. I also marinated the lamb with zucchini, mushrooms, onions, and red peppers, then alternated meat and veggies on skewers. I put the dried apricots (diced) in the couscous. All suburb.

absolutely fantastic. essentially halved the sauce recipe and thirded the meat/skewered items. probably still could have used a bit more sauce. didn't have cumin and coriander at the time, so used curry powder instead, which is almost the same thing. don't remember what cut of lamb i used, but it wasn't the specified type; not sure it really mattered.

We made this as part of our Moroccan-themed night at cooking club. It got rave reviews. I marinated for about 4 hours in the fridge, then left at room temp for a bit. So good, I am making the marinade again tonight for chicken.

I made these the other night and it was one of the best dinners I've had in a long while. The taste is literally exactly the same as this great Mediterranean place in town. Instead of apricots and onions, I used chunks of red and green bell peppers, which came out really well basted with the marinade. Also, I picked up lamb tenderloin instead of leg of lamb since I was only making it for two people. I halved the marinade as well. You can really taste all the flavors in the marinade, the mint, the lemon, and the garlic especially. It's a nice balance. Will definitely become one of my staples!

Made with chicken instead of lamb and it was fantastic. Served with tzatziki on the side and Golden Couscous. Squeezed fresh lemon over the couscous before serving and it really brightened the flavour. Will make this again.

Great tasting recipe. I used one tsp salt instead of four, which is a bit much. Had lamb haters love it!

We made this for an Easter brunch last year and it was a huge hit. It's so easy to make that it has become a favorite of the family. The 32 apricots are a little hard for us to get through, but my family loves the grilled onions, so we tend to cut back a bit on one and substitute with the other

love this recipe! Have tried it with lamb, as well as chicken and beef. I use the recipe as is. I add dried apricots, dried cherries, and almonds to the couscous.

I can't say enough about how fabulous this recipe is! It will make a convert of lamb nay-sayers. The only thing I have changed is to use the smaller inside portions of the onion for their even size and manageability to eat without being overwhelming.

Made for a party, having never cooked lamb before. Great success- made chicken also. Used lamb loin that the butcher cut into 2 inch bits for me (no hassle) and - as it was cold outside, used grill pan on stove top, searing kebabs on both side, baked in oven at 350 till lamb was cooked to just under how guests liked it ..rare. Lamb cooked slightly longer after being removed from oven and was done just right when dinner was served. Served with couscous... modified significantly, review posted at site.

This was really easy and yummy. The combination of textures and flavors had nice depth. LOVED the grilled apricots! Cous cous turned out great. I toasted pecans rather than almonds. I'm thrilled to have made cous cous "from scratch" for the first time. The recipe yields a lot of food and the leftovers are fantastic.

Wonderful, and so easy !!!! I used lamb chops as that's all I had on hand, and then instead of grilling on the barbeque I did it in the oven on the grill function and sprinkled the onions and abricot over it the last 5 mins. Will definitely try this again as I always have these things on hand. What an easy dinner.

This was very good. I didn't have boneless lamb, so made it with shoulder chops. I didn't have enough lemon rind, so only used half that, but still very flavourful. I halved the salt as well and probably could have used even less.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite recipes. I typically use boneless skinless chicken, and always marinate overnight. I follow the recipe for the meat marinade exactly (have never tried the apricots and onion skewers) and it always gets rave reviews from guests. Try this - you will not be disappointed.

I made this recipe last night and it was absolutely delicious. I used lamb chops instead of the meat called for because that what was available at the store, and they combined wonderfully with the marinade. Only change to the marinade was to cut the amount of salt in half. Accompanied by couscous w/ feta and mint raita, this dish is easy enough for weeknights and impressive enough for weekend dinner parties.

Fantastic -- I also marinated for 24 hours. I took the advice of another reviewer and cut back on the salt, and I think it was still a little too salty (I use sea salt also). A great meal that was easy!

This earns a rare four-forks. Each time I serve this, I get raves - one guest said it was the best food he has ever eaten, period! Definitely serve with the Golden Couscous, it's divine.

I liked it very much. However, I used my usual non-iodized sea salt in this recipe, and it came out way too salty! You can't taste any of the other spices because of the salt. If you're using anything but normal, iodized table salt, I would cut salt down by at least one teaspoon. However, I will be making this again.

Used chicken, marinated overnight, and, yum, these were amazing! The apricot/onion skewers were fine, but the meat was the best part. Served with couscous and a cilantro yogurt sauce (from a falafel recipe on this site) on the side. Can't wait to make again!

Excellent and so easy to make. I made it once with lamb - great, and once with boneless chicken thighs - even better. The sauce was a real hit.

FAB! TO DIE FOR! Don't change a thing! Served it with a simple salad of tomatoe, pepper, avacado, cucumber, onion, feta, olive oil and salt and pepper. There was nothing left!!

The relatively simple recipe for the marinade belies how good this dish is. The combination of flavors was just spot-on. I used it for lamb and also chicken (boneless thigh meat) with 24h marinating time and both came out really very good. I will definitely be making this again!

This was a hit! I didn't do the apricot skewers and I used the marinade for chicken! It was wonderful and tangy...and yes, excellent with the Golden Couscous (another superb dish!)

This marinade is really excellent. I marinated my lamb overnight and it was practically melting in out mouths it was so good. Next time I will increase the amount of spices just a bit.

Fantastic and easy! I could eat the marinade with a spoon. I used Israeli couscous instead of the regular. Needs to be cooked longer.

Yummy delicious! Very easy and impressive entreé for a dinner party. Lamb was unbelievably flavorful and tender (even though I cooked it well past medium by mistake!). Definitely a keeper!

I rated this 3 forks earlier but had made it without the mint. I have made this dish about 4-5x in the past few months and it is always a hit!! Absolutely delicious. Would however disagree with the person who said marinate overnight - the acid in the lemon "cooks" the meat and it starts to toughen. One to two hours is plenty. I also have started adding a little bit of apricot fruit spread to the reserved basting marinade and it is fantastic! I just cannot imagine how anyone could not love this dish.

I am from the far north and our main meat is caribou that we hunt ourselves. It is good meat, but can be quite tough. I tried this recipe with caribou instead of lamb, marinating for 24 hours at room temperature then barbequing. It was fabulous! It really tenderized the meat well and gave it great flavours. I was having a big party and everyone stopped to tell me how good it was. Will definately make it again and again.

This dish was out of this world... better than the food we've eaten in Moroccan restaurants! Definitely try it with the couscous recipe.

We really enjoyed this dish! Took almost no time to make, and we put half of the marinating meat into the freezer for later this summer. We made some tzaziki to go along with the kebobs, too.

I have made this several times and everyone loved it. The apricots and onions are a great foil to the lamb. I did not have ground tumeric so I substituted curry powder in the couscous and it was fabulous. This is a keeper.

Excellent! Even the people who said they didn't care for lamb raved about this dish. I marinated overnight and will definitely do that again. The flavor was wonderful. Try it!

Ten forks!! I was introduced to this last summer by my cousin and have made it a dozen times since to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I skip the apricots (they burned) and I skip the onion too since it gives me indigestion!! I just load up kebabs on the skewers and grill. The flavor is out of this world - if I close my eyes I could be sitting on the hills in Israel! Totally awesome - don't miss it!

I had friends over for dinner who did not like lamb...Not only did they love this recipe, they insisted I make it again the next time they are over. You can't get a better reception than that!

The mix of lamb, apricot and red onion was fabulous. I served this at a dinner party and received rave reviews. Since this is served kebab-style, those less adventurous eaters can select what they want to eat and the rest of us can layer the flavors as we like. I served this with the golden cous cous and some sauteed spinach with pine nuts and golden raisins. I didn't change the recipe much at all and I don't think it needs any doctoring. It's perfect the way it is!

Yummy! Cut in half for two of us making a dinner and a leftover for lunch. Excellent, both times!! Made the couscous too -- with a side salad, the meal was a belly-buster. Wonderful blend of flavors -- onions and apricots? Who knew!
