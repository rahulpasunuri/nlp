I made it without the anise seeds and served with homemade strawberry sorbet and my guests loved it! Then I made it as an appetizer (using non-hydrog shortening). I sauteed chopped lamb with onions and garlic, let it cool. Mixed in some minced ginger, and chopped fresh parsely and cilantro and used that as a savory filling. It was devoured and I'm making it again today. You can also freeze itbefore baking if you'd like to make in advance.
