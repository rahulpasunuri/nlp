I made this with white stone ground grits and it was fabulous. I doubled the recipe and did it in a 9x13" baking dish.Guests inhaled them, even the ones that said they didn't like grits. I subbed half and half with a 2% milk because I didn't have whole milk, and they were fine

This recipe did not impress anyone compared to the regular cheese grits that I make out of the (admittedly high quality) cheese remnants from my fridge and whatever milk or cream (sour, fraiche, whipping, half & half, or cream cheese) happens to be around. Also, the combination of butter, eggs, milk and cheese result in a very heavy dish.

I thought for sure there were too many grits....nope, not at all, and I followed the recipe exactly. Tasty, maybe a little too rich for some people. That's OK, cut down on the butter, don't use chicken stock instead of water.

Full disclosure: I used instant white grits 1/2 smoked gouda and 1/2 sharp cheddar I used 2 c. chicken stock, 4 c. water Full amount of (salted) butter I didn't cook the grits for the full 30 min. I baked this in a 9X13 glass pan And it was great! It never puffed or got golden, but it nearly made a convert of my grits-averse spouse, and I thought it was great. Made it with the Braised Short Ribs with Chipotle and Peppers from this site (but I can't wholeheartedly recommend that dish...unfortunately).

Very good. I used white grits because I couldn't find any yellow grits and cooked them as it said on the box. It worked out fine. Two South Carolinians at the party said it was great and they should know. I also used a 9 x 13 pan as someone suggested and it worked fine.

I used chicken stock instead of the water and added a healthy splash of white wine with the grits- HANDS DOWN the best baked cheese grits I have ever had, much less produced- fantastic!

Turned out great. It did look as though it was going to overflow, but it didn't as stated in recipe. Tasted wonderful, and had a light texture. Perhaps next time I will cut the butter down just a bit.

I love this recipe for dinner parties, because you can make ahead and bake - very easy and convenient. I use quick cooking grits and it comes out great. Also, took other reviewer's advice and cut the butter to 1/4 C. I found that this works best in a 9 x 13 pan.

This was my first time making grits....an easy recipe and delicious with Short Ribs with Chipotle and Green Chili sauce. YUMMMM....a great combination. Will absolutely make these again.

I am not a grits fan and don't typically eat them (even though I live in the south). I received a gift of gourmet grits from a friend and searched for a decent recipe to try that might encourage me to use and taste them. I tried this recipe and was delighted by it's ease and flavor. I 've made it again but changed a few things. I cut some of the butter out and I changed the sharp cheddar to a chipolte cheddar to give it some zip. I also put a dash of tabasco in to give it some heat. Not too much but just enough so that this had zing. Loved it.

Just served these with the Beef Short Ribs in Chipotle and Green Chili Sauce - terrific combination. I reduced the butter by half (an entire stick seemed too decadent) and left out the garlic (love it, but it hates me). I don't think you miss either one! Also, only cooked my grits on the stovetop for about 20-25 minutes and they were plenty thick. I'm a grits novice, so I got a little nervous about just how thick, but once you add the cheese, milk, egg, etc. they are creamy delicious! Baked the full hour and they puffed up beautifully. Really easy recipe.

I made this dish for my Derby Party buffet, along with burgoo, country ham balls, beaten biscuits, etc. This dish got the most complements and recipe requests. Much lighter in texture than many cheese grits recipes.

So flavorful!! And it got rave compliments from my guests. It paired with the bbq we had perfectly. Highly recommended!

Very yummy, and the ultimate destination for any grit. I had to add more water (about a 1.5 cups) as I cooked the grits, and I'd put less salt in the next time (and I'm not a saltaphobe).

Haven't made this but why would epicurious classify it as QUICK? It bakes for an hour!

Holy Smokes these are great. Served as a side at a New Orleans style dinner. My guests who "do not eat grits" LOVED them. Wish I had some right now.

I followed this recipe to the letter. This is the ultimate comfort food! Four of us ate almost all of it - we couldn't stop! Run, don't walk to the store to buy the ingredients - you will not be sorry. Live it up!
