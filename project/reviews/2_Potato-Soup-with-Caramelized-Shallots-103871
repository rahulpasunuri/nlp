This is a great beginners potato leek soup. I used only 1 head of garlic and a little extra coriander, added some cumin and used vegetable broth. The texture is perfect and I want to experiment next time I make it. I added a dollup of creme fraiche just before serving. This is actually a vegan soup the way I made it. Best veggie soup I've tasted.

In spite of the other reviews, I had high expectations for this recipe. I usually love potato soup, and carmelized onions are delicious. I could barely taste either in this bland soup. The only flavor that did come through was the garlic, and while I love garlic, this was more like a bowl of garlic mush. Sorry, I usually don't write negative reviews of recipes, but this one deserved it.

This recipe took a long time, and the results were not very impressive. It was pretty bland.

THE GARLIC WAS OVERPOWERING AND I USUALLY LOVE GARLIC, AND THE SOUP AFTER BEING PUREED TASTED TOO MUCH LIKE A GARLICY BABY FOOD. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER BETTER RECIPES FOR POTATO SOUP.
