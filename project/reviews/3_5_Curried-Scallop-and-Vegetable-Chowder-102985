This is a great easy soup, I like how it has a little more substance than the usual butternut squash soup. But like many of the other reviewers, I felt lik the scallops were a culinary non-sequitor. Just leave them out, it's better withuot it! Next time I might add some chickpeas

One of my favorite things to make is soup! It's soo good after being out in the cold and wind of Chi-town! This is a wonderful wonderful soup. I've found it hard to find a good butternut squash soup and this one is it! I left out the scallops, added some salt and black pepper and it turned out fantastic!

I believe success with this recipe is very dependant upon the quality of the curry powder you use,as it is the main source of flavour in the dish. We made it once with a basic supermarket powder and found it disappointingly bland. Then we bought an authentic Indian blend with more heat and flavour(MDH brand chicken curry masala)and decided to try the dish again. What a difference! It was amazingly complex in flavour and texture,the spice balancing the sweetness of the butternut squash perfectly. One guest said it was the best soup they had ever eaten. Very easy to prepare, too. We substitute half the clam juice for (cheaper) chicken broth but I wouldn't sub all of it as the juice works well with the clams. We also sub zuchini for frozen peas, right at the end. MMMM, wish I had some right now....

I made this with a few changes - I used a a combination of chicken broth and clam juice, used a bit more coconut milk, and subbed red bell pepper for zucchini. It actually tasted pretty good until we added the scallops -- they just didn't make sense. I might use the same combination of vegetables and spices to do something else... it was really tasty before the addition of scallops.

My husband made this soup for company the other night and everyone loved it. He did make a few modifications though. He used vegetable broth instead of clam juice, shrimp instead of scallops (he cut them into bite size pieces), left out the milk (in deference to my wasteline), and left out the cilantro which neither of us like. Next time I would add a little more curry powder though. But, it was delicious.

i followed the recipe to a tee and thought it was very tasty. the only thing i might do differently next time would be to use larger scallops--they shrink quite a bit while cooking. i would only serve this dish to company if i could think of a better name for the dish. "chowder" just doesn't sound too appetizing.

I loved the sound of this recipe. I made some changes and we thought it was devine. I roasted the squash and potatoes together with shallots, instead of onion. I also substituted vegetable stock for the clam juice. I used a bit more cream and coconut milk because I had pureed the whole thing and it was very thick. I will make this again!
