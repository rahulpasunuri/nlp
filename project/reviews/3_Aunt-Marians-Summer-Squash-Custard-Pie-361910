I used half summer squash & half zucchini. The first time I made it, I used half & half, but I'm not convinced that's why it takes so long to cook. It was still delicious. I also put the squash in the food processor, because it's way too labor intensive to use a potato masher. The second time I made it, I adjusted the following: 1 1/2 T cornstarch, substitute coconut oil for butter, used coconut milk (drinking kind) instead of dairy product, added 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. It tastes great! texture is firmer. still took a long time to cook. After an hour, I finally turned the oven back up to 400, and it took another 20 minutes before it set & turned brown on the top.

Great use of extra squash - do drain it well after cooking and again after mashing. My pie also took over an hour to cook and develop a nice golden color. The taste is sweet, creamy, and perfect for dessert. Yum!

I used summer squash since it has less water and seeds than zucchini. I also steamed the squash to prevent excess liquid. I was out of heavy cream so used 1/2 and 1/2 instead. Maybe that was why it never got firm enough for a knife to come out clean, even after cooking for over an hour. But it tasted good even if it was more pudding than pie.
