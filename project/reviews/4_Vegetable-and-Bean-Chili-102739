This is an exceptional recipe for vegetarian chili. Like many of the other reviewers I substituted 2 cans of corn for the zucchini and used a total of 3 cans of kidney beans which helped give the chili more body and left it on the stove for about 2 hours at a low simmer. I had some tamarind in the house that was mixed with a bit of soy sauce and peanut butter and I used about a small spoonful (be very careful with the tamarind since a little goes a long way). The tamarind darkened the chili and it added a sweet sour mystery flavor to the chili. I also added red wine and oregano to taste. The result was a hearty thick chili whose flavors melded wonderfully.

This was a great recipe that just has the right combination of spices. Ended up halving the amount of onions, put a whole jalapeno, and it could of used more beans. A real winner.

This recipe is great! It's super easy and really delicious and healthy. I used an orange bell pepper instead of green, and put in a whole jalapeno without the seeds. I also added corn from two small ears and replaced one can of kidney beans with black beans. I will be making this very often!

This has become a staple in my house. At times, I add black beans, ground beef, corn, etc. The brilliance in the recipe is the spicing. I usually let the chili sit longer than prescribed to combine the flavors. Today I'm making it for the Civil War. Go Ducks.

Nice and easy! Even my cooking-averse teenager could make this. I am not a fan of green bell pepper, so I used red bell instead, with a little poblano thrown in to green it up. Otherwise no changes. Next time I may add just a little more chili powder. Terrific with corn bread and a cold beer.

This is my favorite chili recipe of all time. I make it exactly as the recipe states, but will sometimes mix it up and add some corn or an extra can of tomatoes and it still turns out great.

We couldn't find our favorite boxed chili mix in the grocery store so we decided to try this recipe instead. It was a blessing in disguise! I loved this recipe...it was just the right amount of spice, and so healthy, too! We substituted black beans and topped with some sour cream, Mexican cheese and tortilla chips. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This chili recipe was great! I doubled it, added a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce and a can full of water, then simmered it down until it thickened. It was delicious! I'll definately make it again! We had cheese and sour cream as a topping.

Oh No! My "secret ingredient" has been revealed! Surprisingly, even 10 years after Gourmet let out this trick, not a lot of people have caught on to how much depth dark chocolate adds to a great bowl of chili. The point isn't to add sweetness. Cocoa isn't sweet. It is that added level of flavor. This one addition will give you a very satisfying bowl of healthy goodness.

Rating: 3
This was asbolutely delicious. To get the sweetness without adding in the chocolate, I used BBQ Sauce. It gave it a nice sweet and spicy kick and really complemented the flavors well. (I used Trader Joe's Brand BBQ sauce). I topped this dish with green onions and sour cream and served it with a side of Jalepeno Corn Bread for dinner.

This is my new favorite vegetarian chili recipe. The only change I like to make is to use corn instead of zucchini. Love the spice mixture and chocolate!

I liked this chili ok, but liked it much more when I started to think of it as a vegetable stew. The seasonings and vegetables were great, but I suppose I'm more used to the bean-heavy chilis I grew up with. I would either add more beans or use another chili recipe in the future, but this makes a healthy and hearty stew.

Rating: 3
Excellent way to serve veggies and warm up on a cold winter evening. I doubled the recipe and made the adjustments as recommended by others: 2 oven-roasted red peppers in addition to 2 green peppers, added 2 asian eggplants, used cayenne, oregano and cinnamon instead of chili powder, started with half the salt and added more to taste, 2 cans of pinto beans with the 2 cans of red kidney beans, pan-roasted frozen corn and doubled the jalapeno chiles. Note, even though I doubled the jalapeno peppers, it was just perfect for me, who normally can't handle much fire. Definitely make it one day ahead!

Rating: 3
Great recipe! I'm not a big fan of zucchini but I decided to give it a try without any altercations or additions and I simply loved it. I was weary about the chocolate but can't imagine the chili without it! It gave a lot of depth and intense flavor to the chili. Wonderful spice level for those of us who like it hot! I made this with the "Bison Burgers with Cabernet Onions and Wisconsin Cheddar" and my boyfriend was a very happy camper! Will make again!!!!

Good recipe, I also added some corn and also Quorn mince (the UK version of Boca ground beef). easy recipe to tweak, and the mix of spices is great. Also easy to modify amounts, just throw in as much or as little of any ingredients as you like!

delicious! i added a can of corn instead of zucchini and blended half of it to thicken. everyone in the apartment wanted to know what i was cooking and what began as a meal for two ended with no leftovers. i usually toss in a little more chili powder, jalapeno, and chili flakes but otherwise great!

Rating: 3
This really was excellent--and before I cooked it I was thinking I'd miss the meat. I don't like zucchini, so I also used one eggplant, chopped into small pieces and salted, then rinsed after 10 minutes. I also used a couple of carrots, and some corn. But the taste really is exceptional-- I kept eating more. It's two hours later and I'm still so full, but it was all healthy! Served it over brown rice with a green salad on the side. Can't wait for dinner tomorrow!

I have been making this chili regularly for a couple of years. We love it! I have started adding ground turkey, since my husband thinks dinner isn't complete unless there is meat...whatever! I do add a little more vegies than the recipe calls for and when you add meat you will need more liquid, I use broth. Wonderful and easy!

Fabulous recipie. Use veggies on hand and add more spices for extra heat/flavor. Love the chocolate; it adds such depth of flavor without any sweetness and my meat loving husband just loves this chili!

I don't often find myself surprised by a dish but I was by this. MAN is this tasty. This may not be a dish that lends well to cooking on low temps for long peiods of time, but I have to say, my batch won't last that long ... I'm going to destroy this pot, YUM!

I love this chili and make it all the time with cheddar biscuits. Last time I added TVP (textured vegetable protein) but I thought it didn't really enhance the dish--the recipe is great exactly as made. It's very low fat and I always feel healthy when I eat it. I blend about two cups of the finished chili in the blender--be careful not to blend too much of the chili because it will start to look gross.

A delicious chili recipe that can be easily adapted to a slow cooker, if desired. I simply sauteed the onion, pepper, garlic, and jalepeno first, then dumped it into a slow cooker w/ the rest of the ingredients and cooked on the low setting for 7 hours. I didn't have zuchinni, so I added an extra can of beans. I correctly guessed that this recipe would not produce enough heat for me, so I used a whole jalepeno and an extra teaspoon or so of chili pepper, and even then it was still what I would consider to be only mildy spicy. Next time I would maybe add a bit of cayenne to the mix. Two other things I would also do differently next time: use unsweetened chocolate instead of semisweet, and drain some of the liquid from the cans of beans before putting them in the mix. The initial results were a little too brothy for me, but this was easily fixed by blending a small portion of the chili in a food processor and then adding it back into the dish.The chili powder & chocolate flavors work really well together in this recipe and produce a rich, dark chili -- especially if you use that extra tablespoon of chili powder. By the second day, the flavors were completely spectacular!

Rating: 0
Not bad. The proportions of the ingredients evidently please a lot of the reviewers who actually followed the recipe. (The only ingredient not found in most other standard recipes is the chocolate, but even that is in some other recipes.) The absence of meat is old-hat for vegetarians. The latter, as well as the thrifty-in-general, would add a significant amount of corn to the mixture or serve the chili with/over brown rice to provide complete protein: the grain (corn or brown rice) provides the amino acids not in the beans, which contain amino acids not in the grain. The beans and the grains together make complete protein. [This information is recalled from Frances Lappe's "Diet for a Small Planet".]

We love this chili. It has become our standard recipe for chili, replacing those with meat. It also is a great choice for vegetarians. We serve with sour cream, guacamole, and cheese on the side and with cornbread or Fritos (great for kids to make Frito Pie).

I REALLY LOVE THIS! This is better than any meat chili I've ever had and it's healthy to boot. I have already made another batch an froze it in individual containers for a quick lunch/dinner.

This recipe was indeed delicious. I trippled it in order to feed about 10 or so college students and it was a hit. Nobody left hungry and there was plenty chili left over for a late-night, 3 person reheat. One even said it was the best chili he'd ever had in his life. Perfect dish for low-budget entertaining.

this was absolutely delicious. i changed a bunch of things (left out zuchini, added corn and carrots, a bit of bulgur, and used half black beans and half kidney beans). however, next time i will definitely NOT add that much salt right about, 2 tsp. was way too much even when i used low salt canned beans. it is the best chili recipe i've ever had, but less salt would make it perfect.

I made it with one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans and also added 1 cup of corn when I added the beans.

I loved this recipe. It was so easy to throw all together after chopping everything up. I did add a small amount of ground beef, forgot to grab the chocolate when getting groceries, and exchanged 1 can of black beas for one of the kidney beans. I had lots of leftovers and ending up portioning into containers and then bringing them to work to microwave for lunch. Still delicious and super easy. Will definitely make again.

I too added corn, substituted red bell peppers for green, and used a combo of kidney and black beans. I usually double this recipe every time that I make it because it freezes really well and is super hearty, healthy, and tasty. I recommend serving over brown rice with grated pepper jack and corn bread on the side. This chili is by far the best recipe I have for feeding a large group of people on the cheap. Yum!

While I followed the recipe closely (added a little celery), it tasted very tomato-y, and I missed the flavor beef adds. I do give it good marks for heartiness (nice texture, and filling!). It just tasted more like a thick tomato vegetable stew w/chili seasonings.

I loved this recipe! Only used 1 onion and did not add the chocolate. At first I was worried about the zuchini in chili but it was so good. Very filling. Served with a side salad and corn bread. Did not miss the meat!!

This is a keeper, very tasty and healthy. I pretty much followed the recipe with added chopped carrots and celeries to the onion/bell pepper mixture. The chocolate is a must. I will try to use some chipotle in adobo next time as that will go well with the chocolate (close to a mole sauce). This could be great as a sidedish.

I made this chili for my vegetarian superbowl friends and they loved it. I was surprised because it is a simple dish with a wonderful depth of flavor. I made my own chili powder from anchos and pasillas and followed the recipe exactly. I didn't have time to make my own beans so I used canned kidney beans (rinsed)and they worked just fine. I am so impressed with this recipe.

Seeing some previous comments, I did a little fiddling with the recipe and came up with something tasty. I essentially doubled it, but added a bit more salt to balance out the chocolate, and added corn. Because with chili, you gotta make a ton!

I thought this was a recipe I had made in the past, but unfortunately it was not. Mine was too sweet with the chocolate, untless the carrots and corn I added supplied the alarmingly sweet taste! (UGH). I used dried beans (i had to add water and I increased the amount of spices listed in the recipe), which of course did not cook fully and probably will not upon reheating...A Mess - and I need to serve it for company tomorrow!

I made this chili last year for the super bowl and went looking for it again in my recipe box with the super bowl coming up again. One of our guests is a vegetarian and this is a winner with carnivores and vegetarians alike. I used one zuch and one yellow squash for color. I used the beans as called for, but would easily use whatever beans you favor. Also, not very hot. If you want a hot chili, add more jalapeno, or habanero or whatever you think you need. Finally, regardless of the chili recipe, at the end I always add in a little bit of a cornstarch and water slurry. In addition to thickinening the chili, it adds a silky, lustruous look to the chili that just makes it look like more than chili. Got the tip from Cook's Illustrated and will never pass it up. Looking forward to this chili again for the Super Bowl and the leftovers. That's all for now.

I also made the additions people suggested including corn. A mix of kidney and pinto beans also works well. I added some carrot for some orange and the dish was beautiful as well as delicious. Definitely a keeper and not hard to make.

In case any of you are wondering (I was) this is *not* a "thick" chili recipe. This recipe is actually quite brothy. I substituted chipotle for regular jalopeño because it's what I had. I also used one can of kidney beans, one can of black beans, and left out the green pepper and second zucchini. I was very pleased with the results. Next time I make this dish I will remember to make the cornbread, too. ;-)

This was great! The best chili I have ever had! I made it for a dinner for 50 people which was eaten outside, and it was exactly the right thing. I increased the garlic, added frozen corn, used red and yellow peppers and used black and kidney beans. I loved telling people the secret ingrediant was chocolate! I will never make chili any other way. I made it along with corn bread with basil, roasted red peppersand monterey jack cheese, also from epicurious. It turned into a faboulous meal.

I first tried this at a friend's house and absolutely loved it. When I found the recipe on Epicurious, and tried it out last night, I realized that this dish was not only tasty, but extremely easy, and good for you too! Like others, I added corn and black beans, and I used fresh green chilis instead of jalapeno. A great make-ahead meal as well. I would also recommend simmering for longer than the recipe states.

I'm giving this three forks with the additions recommended by several of the previous reviewers (oregano is a must, add chipolte chili, 1 cup of frozen corn) -- our potluck group liked it a lot. It's probably the best veggie chili I've ever had, just not to die for.

I was a little skeptical of this because I usually like chili with meat, but this was very, very good and I didn't end up missing the meat at all. I followed the recipe, but I doubled the amount and at the advice of other readers, also added a bag of frozen corn, 2 red peppers in addition to 2 green ones, and about a teaspoon of cinnamon (might add slightly less next time as it is an overpowering spice). Will definitely make again.

I really enjoyed this recipe. In my opinion it was better than a meat chili, but I am not all that crazy about ground beef. My boyfriend liked it a lot, but I think he missed the meat! The chocolate is definitely a key ingredient, and you can't taste it in the end product. As suggested by other reviewers, I did 1 can of kidney and 1 can of black beans; and I added a little corn. It was really good. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!!

This was pretty good, although I think it needs more spices. I used cumin, oregano, ground red pepper, lots of paprika, turmeric, and a dash of cinnamon for good measure (I didn't have chili powder). If you like spicy chili, use at least 1.5 jalapenos. I also recommend browning some whole cumin seeds (1+ tsp) with double the garlic before adding the rest of the veggies. Next time, I'll try more chocolate!

This is so good, I'm rating it while I'm still eating it! I had to make a couple of substitutions that I definitely recommend: used Chipotle Chili Pepper instead of chili powder, squash in place of zucchini, and let it sit a day before serving it - very spicy but wonderful flavor!

I doubled this recipe and substituted one of the zuchini with 2 ears of roasted corn and about a cup of chopped broccoli florets. It's gotten RAVE reviews from everyone I've gotten to try it. Next time I'll double the jalapeno and chili powder as it was a little tame but a definite keeper.

This is the best non-meat chili I have ever had. I doubled the recipe and served it at a party of true meat lovers who ooh-ed and ahh-ed about it. I also used one red and one green pepper as well as half kidney and half black beans. Do make sure to get organic beans. Most regular canned beans have sugar or corn syrup and lots of other funky stuff in them. This recipe is very easy to make vegan, as well.

I used a whole jalapeno, 3 Japanese eggplants (not zucchini), 1 can each of black and pinto beans (not kidneys), 1 cup frozen corn, 2 blocks of semi-sweet baker's chocolate and 2 15 oz. cans chopped canned tomatoes. Complex, interesting flavors. Wonderful with home-made cornbread (make with stone ground yellow corn with the germ - a huge difference in taste!). Now I have something to serve vegetarian guests.

This is THE best chili, and my new favorite vegetarian dish! I also used half black, half pinto, used a small handfull of semi-sweet chocolate chips, doubled the garlic and added about a cup of Creamy Tomato soup--this added a bit of creamy texture to the chili, as well as toned down the jalapeno (I may not add the jalapeno next time). Can't wait to make this for a winter party!

I've made this chili several times and it always comes out delicious. It tends to taste better the second day after the flavors really combine. I use the whole jalapeno pepper and I vary the dish by using yellow and orange peppers instead of a whole green pepper. I also use yellow squash in addition to the zuchinni for extra color. If I don't have the semi-sweet chocolate, milk chocolate chips work just as good. Very healthy dish which does go well with home-made cornbread.

The chocolate in this recipe gives it a really nice richness that makes you forget that there isn't any meat. I've added leftover chickpeas to the mix and it tastes great.

This dish is tasty, and it has a nice variety of textures (especially if you use a few different types of beans). It also has real visual appeal, as many chilis don't. We found lime wedges a nice accompaniment; without lime juice, one might want to increase the amounts of spices, perhaps half again.

This is a terrific chili to come home to on a cold winter night! One of my gal pals left a jar of it on my porch as a "Welcome-home-after-a-tough-week!" surprise. The ingredients she quoted me have expanded to one more vidalia onion, diced potato, green and red peppers, extra chili powder to taste, crushed red pepper, carrots, lentils, an extra can of chopped undrained tomatoes and tomato paste. Keep the veggies in generous chunks and enjoy it pretty much guilt-free!Corn bread, low-fat sour cream, a bit of shredded cheddar,(or low-fat cheese)and some cilantro top it off pretty nicely!(Yes! The chocolate is a wonderful twist!)Surprise a friend of your own!

This is great chili. I, too, omitted the zucchini and the jalapeno pepper. I did add a red bell pepper and used canned tomatoes that had jalapenos in them. I also used a can of black beans and a can of northern beans to give a little variety. I then added two veggie burgers I had leftover which gave it a more "meaty" mouth feel. The overall flavor was fantastic - just the right amount of heat/spice. Tasted even better the next day. A very substantial and delicious vegetarian chili.
