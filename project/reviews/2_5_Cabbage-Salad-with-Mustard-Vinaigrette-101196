Very disappointing recipe. I love raw cabbage but this was lacking. Not bad, just lacking. I'd not recommend this one.

This recipe is a half-baked attempt. Add julienned roasted red pepper, red onion and carrot. Ditch the red wine vinegar and use apple cider vinegar and tweak it with a heavy dose of balsamic vinegar. May or may not need a pinch of sugar depending upon the acidity of your vinegars. At least this will put you on the right track. This makes a wonderful side dish to mexican food. It always tastes better the next day.

This was tasty made with fresh parsley from the garden. Reduced it to two servings to avoid watery leftovers. Added a smidge of minced onion to the greens, and a drop of agave syrup to the dressing for sweetness, per other reviews. Hubby loved it.

This salad is very good. It is light tasting, and you can taste all the flavors. I didn't salt the cabbage first, and I didn't add sugar. I did add some slice bermuda onion for flavor and color, as I was using only green cabbage. I served it with tilapia with chile lime butter, and rice. Lovely!

I believe the best way to make any cabbage salad is to sprinkle the shredded cabbage with plenty of salt first to draw out the moisture. That way it will soften and taste less bitter. It's essential. The mustard vinaigrette is okay though.

A good start but I agree with others about adding something. I added a bit of sugar to bring out flavor. Also some chopped mangoes for more color and flavor.

I made this to go with the wild mushroom lasagne. It was a nice accompaniment to that recipe. However, I don't think it would stand alone all that well. I'd only make this again to go with the lasagne (which is fantastic).

As written 1 fork. I made it as written and found it one dimentional. So I added Bavarian mustard for sweetness, toasted mustard seeds for smokeiness and sunflower seeds for more depth of flavor. After I was done it was delicious. I loved the idea, but it just needs more.

Not bad, but it needs a little something more...I'll do it again with either more mustard or vinegar.

This was terrible. We tossed it after one bite.

A very simple yet yummy and healthy dish. We couldn't stop sneaking forkfuls from the bowl!
