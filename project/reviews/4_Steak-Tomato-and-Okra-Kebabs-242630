This was outstanding!!! Unfortunately, the okra we got was woody, so I am anxious to have again soon with some more tender okra.

Awesome recipe. I am especially thrilled by the okra - it came out surprisingly tasty, goes great with the marinade. This may turn out to be my go-to method for cooking okra - yum yum! Only thing I would change next time is I'd use cherry rather than regular tomatoes.

I didn't use Okra, though it sounds delicious and for my vegetable skewers I had multi-coloured bell peppers and cherry tomatoes. The flavour was wonderful and the meat so tender. This is definitely a recipe I would repeat!

This sounds like a great summer dish. I love okra and am always looking for new and different ways to prepare it. I'm going to fire up the grill and try these out this weekend!

I am always looking for recipes with okra in them, so this one is kind of perfect! Especially since steak's involved. I just got inspired to grill this weekend!

I must confess I did not make the okra-- just used veggies on hand (cherry tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms) which turned out nice-- I will try okra sometime though b/c it sounds great. The marinade is super flavorful and very easy-- I highly recommend it.

Super yummy marinade for steak

yum - super easy - great idea to skewer each type of food seperately so everything cooks evenly - have made it several times adding mushrooms, onion, zukes and squash to the mix.
