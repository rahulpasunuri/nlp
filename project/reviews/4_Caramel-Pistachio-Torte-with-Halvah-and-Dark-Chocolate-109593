This is outstanding! I have made this torte at least 5 times now and everyone loves it! However, I realized after the first couple times that it really doesn't need the extra layer of the crust on top. I just put the crust into the bottom and up the sides of my tart pan and add the filling and bake. Once it is cool you can just spread the chocolate ganache on top. (you do not invert the torte) I just save the extra dough for the crust in a disk and freeze it. Then the next time you make this it is a snap - just defrost the dough!

This recipe was pretty easy to make (albeit time consuming)-the crust was particularly forgiving, as I had to adapt for an 11" tart pan and monkey w/ the quantities. Initially I worried I didn't have enough of the caramel mixture, but it turned out fine. However, I found it just too sweet...although my guests gobbled it up.

Boffo! Don't take this to a pot luck because everyone will say how great your dessert is and not even touch the others! Lesson from 1st attempt: Make sure the dough fully seals the torte or the caramel will ooze out during cooking, and then you'll have to eat the whole thing yourself.

Delicious! This is a unique and very yummy treat. I made it for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it! I bought pistachio halvah on Amazon when local stores didn't have it. One note on making the caramel: For any novice cooks like me, be aware that caramel can be quite tricky: I followed the recipe exactly but it immediately started burning and I had to start over (once I finally melted all that hardened burnt sugar out of my pan!). I then found a page that did a thorough job of explaining how to make it without burning it: http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Caramel-Sauce - they even have a link to a video! My minimum advice would be: 1.) don't worry if the thermometer isn't up to 360 yet; remove from heat and add ingredients the moment the caramel turns even a medium caramel color (not dark), and 2.) have the butter and cream prepared, pre-measured, and ready right by the stove so you can stir them in at the exact second the caramel is ready, and not a moment later. It sounds intimidating, but once I looked at this link my second try came out wonderfully.

This is extraordinary dessert. It is really only three steps, it seems like a lot of work, but re read it, it isn't. You can make it a day or so beforehand (winner). Sometimes 'exotic' ingredients punch you in the face with their weirdness, or strength... but this was subtle, but amazing. My guests were rolling on the floor and asking to take a slice home, and this is a bunch of foodies from Portland, who aren't often bowled over by something new. And I am taking no credit, I just grabbed something off this site the day before a dinner. In Portland, you can find the halveh at Barbur World Foods. Some other reviewers couldn't find the halveh and I think it is the main cool thing about this one, that sets it apart. Save this recipe when you want to blow people away. Also, cut tiny slivers.... it is very rich.

This recipe deserves more than 4 forks! Several people who I served it to called it their favorite dessert ever. I made two changes to ingredients: 1) couldn't find halvah, so I substituted 1 c. unsalted pistachios + 2 TB sugar in the crust, 2) added about 1 tsp. salt to the filling (salt + caramel = magic). I also didn't have a tart pan of the required size so I made it in a 9" greased nonstick cake pan, then dipped it in hot water for about 10 seconds before inverting/unmolding. Because this is so rich, when I make it again I think I'll make it in a square pan and cut it into petit-four sized bites before glazing with the ganache.

I'm not really what I consider a cook, but made this twice, the second time fora party and it got boffo reviews! 3 things I learned: 1) MUST cover completely with top dough or will loose a lot of caramel, 2) use a large saucepan or caramel. It really does bubble up when cream is added and 3) if torte forms apoxy like bond with tart pan, place in a bit of hot water for a few minutes and it will loosen up enough to release.

I'm not really a cook, but have made this twice. The 2nd time was for a party and I got several requests for the recipe. 3 things I learned: 1) MUST completely cover torte with dough or A LOT of the caramel will ooze out,2) the cream really does bubble up! Use a larger saucepan and 3) if your torte creates an apoxy-like bond to tart pan, place in hot water (not enough to cover) for just a few minutes. That should loosen it up enough to release.

This was so NOT worth the work. The chocolate is barley sweetened according to the recipe, and has sort of a bitter-truffle taste,which is good, though it overpowers even the taste of halva. I love caramel, pistachios, chocolate, and halva and I guess my expectations were too high.

My guests last night loved this and said it looked like something from a restaurant. I have made it before and it always turns out beautifully. A couple of things I've learned: Make sure the sugar is dissolved (or your caramel will be grainy and won't set), but once it's dissolved, DO NOT stir or your mixture will turn into chunks. I frequently ruin a batch and have to do it again. There seems to be wide variation among reviewers in the temp to which the caramel should go - - my experience is that this needs to go to the 360 degrees called for in the recipe. You can go by the color -- when it turns a medium dark amber, you're done. Also, as another reviewer noted, you definitely want to invert the torte. This will put the firm top crust on the bottom where it will give your torte some structure, and the mushier bottom crust on top for easy slicing. Other reviewers have experimented with changes, but I find that following the recipe exactly gives me a perfect, beautiful, yummy torte.

The crust came out a bit to loose for me. Next time I would use less water, and probably cut the butter in myself. I'm not sure how "burnt" the caramel is supposed to be, but I only went to about 340*F with my sugar. I don't know if the 360*F in the recipe is a typo, but it seems that would be black instead of caramel. I used milk chocolate chips for the glaze, since that's what I had on-hand. It didn't set up as well as I would have liked, so next time I will stick to the recipe and use some semi-sweet bakers chocolate to help cut the sweetness. A bit of glycerin instead of corn syrup might work better too.

Excellent! Lots of work, but well worth it! Was a hit at a potluck. Maybe slightly too sweet -- drink black coffee with it.

I made the crust for something else and didnt care for it. The halvah flavor did not like being "diluted" in a crust. It's best left concentrated.

This was outstanding. My guests loved it. I could only find vanilla halvah, but it worked well. No chalky taste as some reviewers have noted. I didn't understand why inverting the torte was necessary, so I didn't, and although my torte worked well enough anyway I now understand why you want to invert it. The bottom crust bakes with the caramel-pistachio mixture on top of it, so it gets mushier than the top crust. The mushiness isn't a problem in terms of taste (it's great!), but the torte is harder to cut and serve than it would be with the nice firm crust that you get on top. I didn't have enough white sugar to use, so I used brown sugar. It worked very well but caramelized much earlier than the recipe predicted. I'm sure experienced cooks would have known that but I ruined one batch before making a very nice batch that went into the torte. By the time the first batch got to 300 degress, it was gravel; the second batch was done at about 260 degrees. One note that might be helpful -- I thought my pan was ruined but I let it sit in water and it was absolutely fine. great recipe, but make it when you have a lot of time unless you already know what you're doing when it comes to caramelization.

I couldn't find plain or pistachio halvah. One of my guests is allergic to nuts anyway. I found chocolate halvah at Trader Joe's and used that and deleted the nuts. It was incredible! The caramel was alittle tricky. To avoid burning the pot I frequently mopped the sides of the pan - it took about 25 minutes to turn amber - not the 11 expected in the recipe. But watch it - it goes from light amber to burned in a few seconds. It is my new favorite dessert.

I wasn't able to find a fluted pan, so I used a 9 inch springform, and salted pistchios instead of unsalted. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly with fabulous results! It was time consuming, but not difficult. Even the caramel making was much easier than I thought. Don't be put off by the halvah, it blens beautifully in the pie. It actually took second place in a baking contest (First place went to the hostess' PB pie - I was robbed!).

I loved it! Had a bit of trouble with the caramel, and would halve the glaze recipe next time. I made it for a Middle Eastern themed dinner, and everyone raved. I got over 20 servings out of it; it is a very rich dessert.

This recipe was a little trickier than expected, but by no means a far stretch in comparison to the RAVES I got from all 15 people at my office party. Several requested the recipe as well. Watch the carmel. It goes slow, but when it's ready to turn, it turns Right Then. A few moments longer & it will taste burnt.

Amazing. I made this for a party and my guests LOVED it and I loved it, too. I think it is the most excellent and professional tasting dessert I have ever made - and I've made quite a few. I have no recommendations as how to tweak the recipe and it worked out exactly how it was spelled out. YUM!

Made this for a large group of women and most of them didn't finish their serving. While it was very good I think the halvah imparted a strange taste & sandy texture to the crust. I'll absolutely make this again but will use a sugar cookie crust (see Quick Pecan Tart from this site) instead. Set out at least one hour before serving and serve w/ unsweetened whipped cream.

I'm a chef at a small country club and I made this dessert for 100 people at a middle eastern theme dinner. It was labor intensive but a member told me it was the best dessert he had ever eaten ! So it was worth it.

MAKE THIS!! It is so delicious! Reasonably easy (I'd never done sugar cookery before and found it simple with a candy thermometer). In Australia (not sure if it is in other countries) we have a chocolate caramel slice ... this is the "adult" version of that slice. I used the recipe without changes and mine turned out looking nearly exactly the same as the photo (except my caramel layer was a bit thicker and needed a few more pistachios to match the photo). I'll be using the halvah pastry part for many other recipes (would be fantastic as the base for a New York Cheesecake!). Rave reviews from my guests and easy to prepare ahead and serve up something that looked AMAZING and tasted even better. It certainly will feed 16 as the recipe stated, as a small slice is enough (I've got lots of leftovers which I will freeze and eat as a treat).

Very good, not too difficult, and keeps well for several days. The pistachios add a nice bit of texture to the carmel. I did cut the butter, corn syrup, and cream in half to make the glaze darker --- no sense ruining a good dark chocolate by turning it into milk chocolate. Next time, I'll also reduce the amount of filling; it was a bit thick and dominated the havlah layers.

My husband says it is the best dessert he has ever had. It is beautiful and worth the trouble. While trekking all over town to find the Halvah, I wondered it it would be worth it -- it definitely was!!! And I love the pistachios in it!

I went to dinner and brought this for the desert. Everyone loved it. What was left I took to work and it was a bit hit. I will make this again and share the recipe with others. It's not a sweet as you would think, but a little goes a long way. 4++ forks from Cali.
