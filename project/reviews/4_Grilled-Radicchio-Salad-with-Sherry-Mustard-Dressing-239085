Quick and easy, and very very tasty. This is my "go-to" salad dressing from now on - I've used it for a variety of salads. Here, it works wonderfully with the crispy lettuce and the smoky flavor from the grill. You have to keep your eyes on the lettuce, and shift it around on the grill as needed, as the different varieties cook quite differently. But it is still quite easy, and totally worth it. A fun and different spin on salad greens!

What a disappointment. From the reviews I had my hopes up that this salad would be a beautiful holiday accompaniment. I used the freshest ingredients and it turned out to be a waste. Just a bunch of wilted lettuce with a dressing that was just ok. I'm taking this out of my recipe box.

This was phenomenal. I needed a salad to accompany a savory tart for a beginning course and I was tired of minimally dressed, boring greens as an accompaniment. People were getting up to go to the kitchen to eat what hadn't been served on their plates. The smoky flavor matches the greens and the dressing perfectly, and they all complimented the savory tart without competing with its own flavors.

I used an indoor stove top grill pan since I dont have an outdoor grill. It worked fine indoors. Also had to use dried dill and it too was no problem. The dressing is a hit alone and can used on fish or other regular salads. So simple but really great recipe! Beautiful color.

This dressing is fabulous.. easy to make and my family and friends keep asking me for the recipe... my suggestion is triple the recipe does not make that much but will be in great demand..

Loved this salad and have made it a couple of times. Not a big fan of red lettuce so we increased the romaine and radicchio. Thought it was delicious. Have also tried adding fennel, which was good too. Great with grilled meat or fish.

Wow! Easy and fabulous. The contrast of warm lettuces to the usual cool and crisp is a fun change and the dressing a wonderful complement. I used dried dill, it was excellent.
