Great recipe and comes together quickly. I made this on a snowy night and we felt like we were at the beach. The coriander and fennel flavors are an unexpected by delicious addition to the shellfish flavor. I used king crab legs and Meyer lemons.

Great recipe. Recommend king crab instead of snow crab, which will have more meat. I did add shrimp, which were excellent.

Seems like you could roast some corn and potatoes with this and have almost like a clambake.

I found the sauce to be far to Tangy next time I would use less lemon.

Really wonderful. I double the sauce and had a few extras mussels and clams. It turned out to be way too much sauce, though it was wonderful to dip bread into. Also, I used frozen crab. When the sauce was done I added the crab to heat it up, with the other fish, and then served it in a big bowl. It came out wonderfully.

Excellent shellfish option that can be easily adjusted to a large-quantity recipe. Whole coriander seeds are a must to bring out the lemons as they lose their citrus tang minutes after cracking. I imagine this dish would work well with any small to medium bivalve species. I added middle necks with great results. The much larger quahogs took longer to open up and as a result their smaller comrades dried out a little in the roasting process. All in all a great (and cheap if you leave out the crab) seafood dish!

This is a very good recipe. The seasonings are delicious and the technique is easy. I did encounter timing problems since the clams (little necks -- what my fishmonger had) took much longer to cook than the rest of the shellfish. Next time I'll stagger the cooking, starting the clams 8 minutes or so ahead. I'll also skip the mussels, which didn't thrill me, and will use shrimp and/or lobster in the shell, with or without the clams.
