These mushrooms are so delicious! The recipe needs to be doubled because it really doesn't make much at all. It takes no time at all to make these.

Nice - but sugar not necessary.

easy and good. i always worry a little when i see sugar in any stir fry or vegetable dish but i made it as written and it's not excessive, just brings out the flavor. i will definitely make this again.

Easy and delicious..perfect for 2 people. I used crimini but will try regular button next time. I had a tad more than about 15 ounces of mushrooms so I doubled the sauce and it was perfect ! However, just a touch too lemony so next time I will cut back just a bit on the lemon juice..other than that ... would serve this for company without a concern ! Very good side dish !

As most others have expressed, really delicious. I used chopped portobellos and a little more sauce, and the tangy, earthy flavor was great. All the more tasty for the speedy, simple cooking method. I let them cool and then paired them with goat cheese and thinly sliced red onion on crostini, sprinkled with toasted hazelnuts and a little fresh basil. Mmm!

Love this as a side for any grilled meat...I like to use button and cremini mushrooms. In a pinch fresh lime juice works in place of lemon, yum!

I make these as often as possible. They are perfection with steak or anything. My two year old hates mushrooms, cooked or raw, but will eat these en masse.

This was not as tasty as the reviews indicated. It was easy, and different. Next time I might cut the large mushrooms smaller than quarters and make more sauce. And maybe add more oil or butter. It was good enough that I will try again.

Yummy!! After reading the other reviews I changed it up a bit, so since I didn't have a lemon I used red wine vinegar and I added chopped shallots and a dash of fresh thyme and used a little less butter and more olive oil. WOW!!! Delish!! Will definitely make this again and pass it on!! :)

An excellent recipe. I was looking for something different from the usual garlic and butter, and this fit the bill!

Rating: 2
This was a strange combination of flavors that overpowered the subtle taste of the mushrooms. I'll be going back to basic butter and garlic next time.

Rating: 3
These were excellent addition to my meal. I served Grilled Porterhouse Steak with Parmesan Paprika Butter, Amy's Basil Risotto and Mixed Greens with Roasted Asparagus & Apple. Loved the quartering (v. sliced). Made it more of a side dish, but still tasted great with the steak. A little different (and more interesting) than the standard way of sauteeing mushrooms in butter and garlic.

I needed a quick way to spruce up some mushrooms I was making for my hubby and in-laws. I've never liked mushrooms, but these were delicious! I've been converted! Can't wait to make them again! Served with steak and asparagus (the roasted recipe from this site) and the meal was delish and so simple!

I wasn't keen on it but my boyfriend liked it. I wasn't expecting the asian flavor (although looking at the ingredients I should have). It is good with steak and easy to make

What an easy and quick way to make mushrooms ROCK! I found the flavor a tad on the bland side, and since I don't like to cook with salt, I think I'll try adding onions or scallions next time. Otherwise, a very simple and delicious recipe.

I just made this tonight as a side for a ribeye steak and baked potato. Wow! This is fabulous. I sauteed a few shrimp with the mushrooms, it is awesome.

Wow! I used crimini mushrooms because they were on sale, but I didn't stray from the recipe in any other way. This mushroom dish was simple, fast, and delicious. What more does one need from a side dish? I look forward to having it again.

Both my husband and I loved this recipe. Will definitely make this a staple in our home.

Great taste and real easy I have made this with white and with crimini mushrooms. White are definitely better since they let the flavor of the sauce come out more Yummy

Very affordable, very easy and, most importantly, very tasty. Should be on everyone's list of staples.

I love this recipe! I always double the sauce. Although fantastic as is, on a regular weeknight I cut the oil to about 1 T. and omit the butter to save calories. I make it full-flavor and full-fat for company. I've also added thinly-sliced onion on one occasion and it turned out great. I've also substituted Splenda for the sugar before and it was still yum. I serve it with steak or over grilled hamburger patties. So easy!

I always use low sodium soy sauce...should have thought of that before I added the sugar. It was a bit too sweet for us so next time I'll cut the amount of sugar. But there will be a next time, interesting flavor combination and so good with steak.

Wow! These sauteed mushrooms are wonderful and are an excellent compliment to a good steak. Very tasty and easy to make.

Although I thought these mushrooms were delicious, my boyfriend barely touched his, saying there was "too much crap on them." (What his means, I don't know...perhaps he just wants mushies sauted in butter). I would make them again for me, though.

A nice change from plain old mushrooms. I used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce. I too served along side steak and mashed potatoes with prosciutto and parmesan cheese (from this site). Definitely a keeper.

Excellent! Gotta try it - super with steak, etc. We have it now as a standard side dish. Don't change a thing!

Teriyaki mushrooms! I think the oil could be reduced, but I would not make any other changes.

These are a wonderful side dish - - if they make it to the table! Even the kids love them.

I mixed this with some pasta, the sauteed brocoli rabe (recipe is on the site) and some sausages, incredible

It really is unbelieveable how good these are. I've made them as a side dish to almost everything, from beef to veggies. The only change I make in the recipe is adding the lemon/soy mixture sooner - I think it gives them much more flavor.

The best mushroom recipe I've ever made. Highly recommend. What a wonderful flavor.

Made this side last night. It is very easy and filled with flavor. I omitted the butter to keep it lower in fat, but otherwise made no changes. This will be kept in my recipe file. My husband & I enjoyed it !!

I've made this a dozen times and everyone always asks how I made them. I use the recipe as written but sometimes end up putting a little more soy sauce.

I checked the mushroom diane recipe, and it called for 1/2 stick of butter, half a stick for 1lb of mushrooms!!! geez... i'll stick with the regular mushoroom ragout by emeril

This was great in an omlete with brie and fresh herbs, it got great reviews from my guests.

Am making these again tonight and it occurs to me that I've neglected to rate this one. We love 'em---with no alterations to the recipe. They're sauteeing now and smell so wonderful. I'm looking forward to these more than I am to the steak.

I agree with Austin. These are good but not great. I cut back on the lemon as some reviewers suggested, but then I tasted too much soy sauce.

This was good but not great. The recipe on this website for Mushrooms Diane is much better. I think I would always prepare the Mushrooms Diane over this one.

From a confirmed mushroom lover... This was the most fantastic mushroom dish ever! Double the whole recipe. You'll be sorry if you run out of these babies!

I could literally make a sandwich just out of these mushrooms. They're *so* easy and *so* good. (I'm not a big lemon person, so I decreased the lemon juice by about half.)

For guests, I'd follow the recipe as above. Otherwise, I'd cut down on the soy sauce, olive oil, and butter!

This is the best mushroom recipe EVER! Everyone that has tasted these delicious mushrooms love them! Try this recipe for sure.

The lemon adds a nice liteness and works effectively to temper the garlic, and created a savory sauce. This dish will work best with simple grilled meats. Do not add salt...the soy sauce adds enough on its own.

Very nummy. I've made this recipe a couple of times now and have learned to double the recipe since it goes so fast!

Rating: 4
Very Tasty!! I used 16 oz. Criminni Mushrooms and Tamari instead of soy sauce. The only ingredient I would alter is the amount of lemon juice. It was stronger than I appreciated.

Rating: 4
For a side dish this was spectacular. Just make sure and double the recipe as the portions are pretty small in the original and they were gone very quickly. I used just a tad more garlic.

Regardless that I doubled the recipe and used salted versus unsalted butter, it turned out great. My guests loved it and so did my very finicky husband!
