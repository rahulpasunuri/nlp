This recipe was great. I would recommend to cook the carrots separately from parsnips and then finish since they cook at different speeds. Loved and will make again

Loved this recipe. I only used 2 parsnips and 2 carrots and eyeballed everything as there's just the 2 of us. After I plated the veggies, I realized I forgot about the butter & honey so I just put on a pat of butter and drizzled a touch of honey and it was fine. One less pot to wash!

This is a simple, beautiful, delicious recipe. It was fabuously easy to make and my husband (who doensn't rave) raved about them. I will totally make them again.

Great and simple addition to recent T-day meal. I doubled the glaze, roasted ahead and warmed up. Pretty and practical recipe. People are surprised to like parsnips!

This was so amazing! I never cooked parsnips but thought, it's Passover so why not try something new. It was worth the stress. It looked great, the taste was outstanding. I did take other reviewers advice and used a Balsamic Glaze I had in stock, and it really was delicious!

I had a variety of heirloom carrots that I needed to cook up and this worked great. I used a misto and spritzed olive oil on them and that worked really well. I'm going to try putting the glaze on before they are done or hit it on broil after to see how that goes.

Great recipe! I increase balsamic and put all sauce ingredients in a pan to simmer a bit before dressing the vegetables. Always well received.

What a great recipe. Easy to make(you can't make mistake!!) and tastes great. Everyone raved and asked for the recipe. I can't wait to make it again.

This was very tasty. I ended up taking them out of the oven when they were just about ready, poured the glaze over them and then put them back in the oven on high broil for a few minutes. They were excellent.

Fairly quick and super easy for such a flavorful sidedish. While my olive oil and salt coated veggies roasted, I reduced about 3T balsamic before adding 2T maple syrup and 2T butter. While stirring, I brought that to a quick boil & promptly removed from heat. Resulted in a sweet, thick, and rich sauce that glazed the veggies well. This simple sauce made with either honey or maple is amazing; a bigger batch would be so delicious on pork or chicken, too.

These were fairly easy (except for the chopping) and yummy, but not exceptional. I might make it again...

I couldn't find parsnips so I just did it with the carrots. They were DELICIOUS. I think you can lower the amount of the olive oil. And even avoid the sauce altogether if you want to because the carrots were already carmelized just from being roasted.

Fantastic recipe. These carrots are highly addictive - vegetable candy. I made them for Easter and now keep a bowl in the refrigerator to reheat as a snack and instant side dish.

Excellent dish. I made this for Passover and was exceptionally happy with the results. I did not include the parsnips in the recipe and just roasted 4 lbs. of carrots instead. It was delicious!

I used reduced/syrupy balsamic vinegar. I reduced a cup of balsamic to about a 1/3 of a cup before using in the recipe. When I read another reviewers notes about the glaze not sticking, I thought I would get better results with a reduction. Yum! Introduced several people to parsnips--with success.

This was delicious side dish for our Thanksgiving this year. What was particularly nice were the "do ahead" techniques which allowed me to roast the carrots before the turkey went in and then reheat them after the turkey was done and was resting.

This dish was a standout at our very traditional Thanksgiving meal. Really delicious and attractive dish! I was running low on butter, so I used olive oil with honey and balsamic for the glaze and it worked great.

Elegant side dish- delicious! I've made this a number of times and each time my guests are very impressed! I don't tell them how simple the recipe is! For once I actually follow the instructions to a T and it turns our perfectly each time.

was really good...only thing was I wish the sauce was thicker as it just ran off the veggies.

Only had carrots purchased from farmer's market so can't vouch for the parsnips, but the carrots were amazing!! So easy and delicious. I'll definitely be making these again soon!

Delicious! I did not use foil lined baking sheets; just used non-stick baking sheet. I also put the carrots in a bowl first to mix the olive oil, salt and pepper before putting on sheet. Much easier and better coating. I could not find parsnips, so used all carrots. I also added a few diced shallots to roast with the carrots. I also drizzled the honey glaze over the carrots before roasting for last 10 minutes. Great reviews from my guests.

Easy and delicious. My carrots cooked a little faster than the time suggested in the recipe, so I'd recommend monitoring them. The honey/basalmic combination is addictive.

I scaled this down to only cook 1 lb of carrots. We bought some beautiful baby ones at the farmer's market. I didn't peel them, but I would next time. Other than that, I stuck with the program, scaling down all ingredients accordingly. I loved it and will definitely make again. So easy and I always have these ingredients in the house. I paired it with something a little spicy (Moroccan Chicken, also from this site) and it was wonderful.

Outstanding. I would definitely make this ageain.

Tasty. For some reason I had to roast the vegetables about twice as long as the recipe says, but it all worked out.

This has become a staple for all my dinner parties. You can do the veggies ahead of time and rewarm them on a cookie sheet (I even peel, cut and bag the veggies the night before to save time). It's deceptively simple and looks as though it requires a lot more effort than it actually does. I do salt/pepper the veggies before throwing in the oven. Otherwise, perfect!

I've made this several times usually for Thanksgiving and its always been a huge hit. To avoid excess water from carrots, etc. make sure they are well air dried before putting them in the oven. I usually cut up the carrots and parsnips 1/2 a day to a full day ahead and let them air dry before putting them in the oven. Comes out perfectly-- soft and slightly charred.

I've made this recipe (with carrots only) numerous times and always to rave reviews. Because they are sweet I serve them with other more savory vegetables. This is my go-to recipe for carrots as a side.

I made this for a christmas dinner along with some cornish hens with cornbread/ calif fig stuffing. I substituded bosc pears for the carrots. I added the pears later in the roasting process. The sauce was fantastic and I will definately make again

I have no idea what the issue is, but I've tried making this twice, and each time the carrots ended up drowing in the water they gave up. Not only that, but they spent at least 40 minutes roasting and were still too firm. I finally had to microwave them because the rest of dinner was ready and getting cold. The dressing tastes fabulous though, I just wish I could get the carrots to roast properly.

Doubled the recipe and followed it exactly. They were fantastic! And here's what I did with the leftovers -- simmered them for about an hour with some fresh herbs (parsley and sage), dried mushrooms, and a few garlic cloves in water; removed the mushrooms and some of the herbs; pureed the rest in a blender; returned the puree to the stove with some nutmeg, sherry, salt, pepper, cream, and a healthy dash of curry powder. Delicious. Will definitely be doing it again!

I first tried this dish at a friend's home at our annual Christmas dinner. I was never a fan of parsnips prior to eating them this way. I liked them so much I asked the hostess how she prepared them and she said she found the recipe here. When I made it myself, I sliced the carrots and parsnips into thinner slices, about 1/4" thick, to cut the roasting time in half. I put the cut veggies in a bowl, added the salt, pepper and oil and toss them before putting them on the foil lined pan. While they roasted, I melted the butter and honey together, and also add 1/2 tsp. of unsulphured blackstrap molasses. After tasting, I decided to add a touch more balsamic vinegar to punch it up a bit more. To cut the fat and cholesterol, I used a butter substitute.

Made this for Christmas to rave reviews. I used 4 lbs. carrots and no parsnips. I roasted the carrots in the morning, then microwaved the glaze about 30 minutes before dinner, poured over the carrots and reheated them in the oven for 15 min and they were great. Do be careful while roasting - a few carrots got really blackened but that was my fault for not turning them enough. Four lbs. carrots looked like way too much as I was cutting them (I thought I'd have leftovers for a week) but they shrank a lot during cooking and were just right as side-dish servings for 9 people.

This was a yum, quick recipe and paired well with prime rib. The glaze was easy and would also accompany other veggies well.

Super easy, elegant, and delicious. I had people coming up to me throughout the meal - especially the men for some reason - asking how to make the dish. I doubled the recipe, and every bit of it was gone. I will absolutely keep it in rotation.

This is the first vegetable recipe I've ever made (minus vegetables with cheese) that had the crowd raving. A few caveats: (1) I made only carrots, not parsnips. (2) One key is only to peel/halve the carrots - if you cut them into "baby carrot" size pieces, they'll overcook. (3) I roasted the carrots two hours ahead. Ten minutes before serving, I microwaved the sauce ingredients in a dish. I then poured the sauce over the carrots and warmed in 350 degree oven for ten minutes. I will make this again.

Maybe I cooked too long, but my carrots were shriveled and unappealing. Glaze wasn't anything special either.

This was such a nice recipe! I made up the sauce and tested it out before dumping it on the veggies. Only thing I might change (personal pref) is to cook them a little less, I found the parsnips got chewy when I let them char. But the flavor was WONDERFUL. Served them for an informal dinner party with the prosciutto wrapped pork tenderloin. I also cooked up a seperate batch of cubed butternut squash and served them with the same sauce. That was a nice treat too! Could have mixed the lot of them. Pretty colors in a cobalt blue bowl.

We are parsnip lovers. I was worried that 4 pounds of carrots & parsnips would be way to much for 2 people, but I was wrong! Very easy & highly recommended!

I first made this (but carrots only) as a side dish for a St. Patrick's Day party. It was excellent with oven roasted corned beef. It also pairs well with roasted poultry, like cornish hens, and I'll bet it also stands out with a pot roast too. These are the best tasting carrots I ahve ever had, and I will be making this dish again and again. I will be trying it with the parsnips soon.

Made this sans the parsnips. Did not have any in the fridge. Has become a yummy addition in the favorite side dish recipe file. I usually double it so to have vegetables for a few nights. Make it. You won't be sorry.

I have made this dish several times since finding the recipe in December's Bon Appetit. I've become a parsnip lover. I just made this for a potluck and received rave reviews from co-workers. I'm emailing the recipe to them now.
