I really just wanted to make spicy pumpkin seeds and these are great made with Trader Joe's raw pepitas. I'll make the soup next if the seeds aren't all eaten!

After wandering NYC on a very cold winter day, this was the perfect meal. Simple prep and delicious, warming results. The soup has a natural thickness that is so satisfying. I wish I had some pumpkin seeds lying around becuase it was definitely missing something. But then again, the recipe gives room for lots of variation. I added leeks and goat cheese and that was lovely.

IT is so great because it is flavorful(of course I am roasting my own garden squash...) and needs no dairy to thicken it ...I make those pumpkin seeds once a week! everyone eats them like mad!!! love it! thank you so much!!!

This is a great foundation that can either be made more "ethnic" (either Indian or Latin), or can be made more "European." Either way it needs a little something extra but it's just as easy with the extra steps. To make an indian version, I added some garam masala, 1 tsp ground coriander, 1 tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp turmeric and maybe one minced green chile. Garnished with cilantro and the pumpkin seeds. On the European end, I sauteed a medium leek with fresh thyme in olive oil, minced garlic and shallots. Threw this mixture, squash and fresh sage in processor, then simmered with broth for another ten minutes. Obviously the pumpkin seeds and lime do not apply to this version. For garnish, consider creme fraiche, chopped parsley/chervil, or sauteed wild mushrooms.

This was a good basic recipe to work off of. Quick and yummy. Because I am out in the country, I punt alot. Here are the changes I made: *Green onions (still left in the garden) for the scallion *added garlic *added 1 diced potatoe added 3 diced Mackintosh Apples *I used left over butternut squash that had been roasted the night before. *added about 1/2 tsp Garahm Marsala (sp?) *left out the lime

Needs something. Cardamon, coriander, something that wouldn't clash with the lime. Start with half the lime juice and zest and adjust, it can be overpowering.

This is a very delicious soup. It is extremely easy and healthy! The pumpkin seeds are the perfect complement for this dish. I will definitely keep this recipe for future use.

This was outstanding! A sophisticated soup - even appropriate for company - yet very, very easy. I skipped the pumpkin seeds and thought it was fine.
