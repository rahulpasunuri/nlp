Superlative cookie! So very crispy and delicious. I doubled the salt and added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and black pepper. Very good!

I don't know what I did wrong--but I felt these were awful. They were hard and very dry. No special taste. The outside of the cookie was dense and so was the inside almost to the point of making you feel they were old and stale. ECk!

I used Unbleached flour and added 1-1/4 cup of dark raisins soaked in rum. I finger grabbed a chunk of dough, lightly rolled them in cinnamon sugar, lightly finger pressed them down, and all we can say is.. AWESOME! A sure-fire winner!!

I agree with the other cooks...this is a good cookie. I find that it is a little on the sweet side so I would decrease the brown sugar by about half a cup next time. This recipe is a definite keeper.

This is an excellent cookie recipe - the perfect combination of crunchy and soft. The 16 minute cooking time is right on the nose. I meant to add spices as suggested in previous reviews, but forgot. The cookies are really good plain too.

This is a GREAT cookie. I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cloves because I like a little more spice than the recipe provides. It's good without the spices but I prefer them. My family thinks their great. Light and crispy on the edges and soft and chewy in the middle. Perfect everytime.

great texture, but maybe a little too sweet.

These cookies were really good, and different from more traditional oatmeal cookies. The texture is almost like a peanut butter cookie. When they first come out of the oven the cookies are very hard and crunchy, but they become soft after a couple hours exposure to the air. They're good either way, though!

Answer: Usually a small bowl of sugar will suffice. There is no specific measurement as the sugar is intended for dipping the bottom of the glass (used to flatten the cookies prior to baking). The sugar helps to provide a crispy exterior.

Question: How much sugar?

This recipe made good crunchy thin cookies but needs some spice. Next time I will add cinnamon and cloves.

These are simply wonderful. They are disappearing fast! Some were apprehensive about the lack of chocolate or rasins or something, but they are just perfect the way they are, especially when paired with coffee or tea.
