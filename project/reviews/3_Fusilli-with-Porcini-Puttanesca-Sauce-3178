Lot of fuss and feathers for a poor sauce.

this recipe is not vegan as it has fish (anchovies) in it

One of my most favorite pasta sauces is puttanesca and this was no where near what I would consider a true puttanesca. While it had all the "makings", it had none of the rich taste. I was looking for the rich flavor and this dish had none. I even added half a stick of butter and chicken broth but to no avail. I would never make this again and am disappointed that so many users gave it high rankings. To credit Bon Appetit, this is the first recipe, after many years' subscriptions to the magainze, in which I was totally disappointed.

It's very good, but I don't think the recipe should exclude the anchovies. If they're sauteed first the flavor is not too strong. Tuna is actually a viable substitute if people are still put off. The problem is also in the type of anchovies used. Often in Italy the gourmet anchovies are white and firm filets, unlike the gooey red ones found in America. Regardless, anchovies are a also an integral part of a puttanesca sauce. Otherwise it's pretty much a vegetable marinara. It would be like making a nicoise salad without tuna, if that's a fair comparison. Otherwise, good recipe for the sauce, could use a bit extra garlic, and has a great kick with some red pepper flakes.

This is a swell recipe! With the following changes - no mushrooms, no anchovies -- my friends raved. I'll definitely make it again. However, next time, I will triple it for 8 rather than just double it. Try it...you'll like it!

My family enjoys puttanesca, but everyone just *loved* this version. Like some others, I chose to sautee the garlic, anchovies & onions prior to adding the remaining ingredients. I used a blend of the anchovy oil and olive oil.

Yum, Yum. We make this recipe often - it's my husband's favorite pasta recipe. Nothing to add to the comments already provided.

Would never make this as written, but with everyone's help this has become a real winner!!! I also sauteed the onions, garlic, mushrooms (rehydrated shitakes), and anchovies. Didn't use the liquid from the mushrooms, so had no need to add the tomato paste; the sauce thickened fine on its own. I also eliminated the capers (neither of us care for them). I used Kalamata olives, but will try it next time with Nicoise. Doubled the amount of crushed red pepper. Served it over penne. Will definitely make this earthy treat again.

I did as another cook suggested and sauteed the onions, garlic and anchovies instead of boiling. Used fresh tomatoes. I didn't want to have to bother with the sand from the Porcini mushrooms, so used dried regular mushrooms instead. Excellent and easy for a week night dinner!

This was such a nice light meal, very fresh tasting. I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies, and accidentally left out the olives (which I can't believe I did - I love olives!) I also sauteed the garlic and onions in olive oil cooking spray, which cut down on the simmering time. I will definitely make this again.

i must say i was thrilled with the end result here. i am not normally a puttanesca fan, but the mushrooms really do something interesting here. i did sautee the onions and garlic in olive oil first, as other people had mentioned. (although that adds some fat that is not in the recipe as written.) also used kalamata olives, but i thought it worked out great. my boyfriend adored it and said it was much better than the bolognese sauce i usually make.

I actually used a whole can of anchovies with the oil to saute them to a paste. The rest of the ingrediants can handle or balance the anchovies (which I don't like plain). Go for it! And if you want to guild the lily, sprinkle with an excellent Romano. Oh, oh, oh.

A delicious variant of the traditional puttanesca. I tried it with dried shiitake mushrooms and marinated Calamatta olives 3 1/2 forks.

Excellent. I sauteed the onions and garlic first. I tripled the recipe for a dinner party, and, since I used less water to rehydrate the mushrooms, added a little cabernet to make up the volume. Served with a salad in olive oil balsamic vinagarette and started with a caprese appetizer of fresh mozzarella, fresh basil and roma tomato with a little olive oil, salt and pepper. A bit hit.

I followed a lot of the suggestions *and* used tuna instead of anchovies. Not a real puttanesca, but everyone loved it!

Simple and delicious. We used fresh baby bello mushrooms and we sauted the onions and garlic before adding them to the sauce. Great for a weeknight supper.

This was an excellent pasta. I served this dish with a salad, roasted garlic, goats cheese and toasted baguette slices. A good Zinfandel (Sehgisio)is an excellent choice. I didn't think I liked anchovies, but they added a great taste. I sauteed onions and let it simmer in my crock pot all day. It was wonderful!

This is another Italian delight of course, and for those who detest the anchovies, please try the anchovy paste, it comes in a tube to be found in the specialty section at your grocery.

I also sauteed the onions and garlic in a little olive oil and then reduced the tomato juice. I substituted dried shitakes only because I had them and didn't want to go to the store and it was great. I love this stuff. I always order it when out to eat. This is much better though. It's just so succulent and earthy.

I agree with Chris; the garlic, onion and especially the anchovies must be sauteed, or "melted." Boiled anchovies--yuck!

Wonderful Combination of flavours which allows for substitutions, without comprimising the taste. I've used sun-dried and fresh tomatoes, extra garlic, plain mushrooms, canned black olives. Whatever is convenient.

I substituted dried herbs with fresh basil/parsley and scratched the anchovies. Consider serving with gnocchi; it absorbs the pasta very well if you put grooves in it.

Assembly methodology would make Marcella Hazan cry: saute the onion in olive oil until it is milky, add 5 chopped cloves of garlic and chopped anchovies. When the onion is clear, add the remaining ingredients. This is the classic italian methodology!! And the fusilli does hold the sauce well.

This recipe has become a staple at our house. It has a complex flavor from the capers, anchovies and olives that normally comes from cooking sauces for hours -- and yet this is easy and fast to prepare.

This was a very tasty dish. I thought the anchovies (which I usually love) made it too fishy but my husband would have rated this a 3. He loved it.
