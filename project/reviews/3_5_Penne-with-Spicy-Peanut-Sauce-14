This recipe was easy and really good! I used chicken instead of pork and I added soy sauce and cayenne pepper to the chicken as I sauted it for a little more flavor.

okay i'm baaaack. so i tasted the pasta with the herbs and veggies and the bottled trader joes peanut sauce and declare the dish excellent and certainly easier than making a peanut sauce! i'm serving with a TJ's fillet of pork already seasoned. 2 dipping sauces. and a nytimes recipe for creamy gaspacho. that has not been tasted or reviewed as husband has lost track of time and hasnt come home yet. i expect him in 8 minutes. i put the dessert cups that i am serving the gaspacho in, in the freezer.it should be an elegant and tasty dinner and really very little work.

can't review recipe as i am cheating and using trader joe's peanut sauce which i think will be a time saving substitute. i am serving this with asparagus, bow tie pasta and a roast fillet of pork. i'll get back to y'all when itis finished and husband has passed judgment:).

Delicious. Use chunky peanut butter, and at least double amount of sauce. Great without meat.

The first time I made this I didn't realize it was supposed to be a cold dish. It was still great! I just tossed the hot pasta and hot pork with the cold veggies and sauce and it was perky, flavourful and a great main dish. The leftovers were also good cold. I use yellow and red peppers to add more colour (looks good with the green cucumber). I'd use the sauce recipe for other dishes, too. Enjoy!

A good all-in-one meal. After reading the reviews I made this recipe using the previously mentioned Spicy Peanut Sauce from Gourmet 1996, also on this site. Excellent sauce using sesame for veg oil, and rice wine vinegar for distilled white. It was a nice, refreshing change for a warm summer dinner. Along with the cucumber, I used a diced red pepper, and julienned carrots for color contrast. Also added raw bean sprouts into the mix. Think it would be just as good with sauteed chicken and pasta noodles also. Next time will sub chunky peanut butter. Would be perfect for a take-along picnic.

I have to say, the peanut sauce for this was really terrible. I recommend using the April 1996 Spicy Peanut Sauce version for this dish.

While I'm fond of this recipe, my friends absolutely adore it. It gets requested more than anything else I've ever made. I usually do it vegetarian and make more sauce than recipe says for a little more taste.

I thought the mixture of ingredients did not work well together. Perhaps if I halved the amount of peanut butter and spiced it up a little more it would have tasted better?

Quick and easy to make. I would, however, increase the amount of peanut butter and slightly decrease the amount of lime juice. It was still really delicious though!

This was good, but not great...perhaps not bad as a cold pasta salad in the summer. It just didn't grab me though.

I love this recipe. I skip the meat--it's better (and easier) without it. I'm also not a pepper fan, so I skip the pepper and use the whole cucumber instead. Good stuff!

This recipe is really pretty good. It can tend on the bland side, so I'd recommend that you not scrimp on the lime juice or cilantro. I also blew off the "fancy peanut butter" concept and used store brand PB. Use chunky, too, because it adds good texture. Finally, I used chicken breast instead of pork and found it to be perfectly adequate. This dish is also perfectly lovely meatless.
