Loved it. I increased the amount of quince and water by 50% because I had 16oz. of cranberries, but only increased the sugar by a scant 1/2 cup. I also didn't use a strainer, but a slotted spoon to scoop most of the solids out so the liquid could reduce faster. It was a hit!

This is the third thanksgiving I have made this and it is ALWAYS a hit! I use a little less sugar and it is still plenty sweet.

I haven't made the sauce yet, but after reading the last review I wanted to point out an important reason NOT to skip cooking the skin with the quinces--that's where almost all of the flavor is.

I made this recipe with the following changes/additions: I skipped the whole cheesecloth bit, since IMO, it made a potentially EZ recipe more complicated than necessary. I added 2 whole, star anise to the quince mixture, which lent a subtle touch of spice + 1 T lemon juice & I displaced 1C of water with orange juice. I followed all other instructions but of course, no straining of hot, sticky red liquids was necessary. Overall, this condiment dish was elegant, interesting & delicious. I could eat it with a spoon! Next time, maybe I'll try adding some red wine to a batch, & make something like the Mulled-Wine Cranberry Sauce, also on this site.

This is now our standard cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving and other special occasions. I've made this cranberry sauce on several occasions and sometimes I've added small amounts of other fruits such as strawberries or currants to give a slight accent without dramatically changing the taste. This is a definite keeper!

Very, very nice. Sweeter than most cranberry sauces.
