This sauce is terrific, but it makes a bucket-full. Unless you're having 20 people for dinner, cut the recipe in half. I served this to 6, and had a ton leftover. Delicious.

I make this every Xmas as a part of my traditional English feast featuring a Standing Rib Roast. Delicious. I also serve a mustard sauce for those who like something a little different.

I served this excellant sauce with the Sunday Rib Roast which has a delicious dry mustard and flour crust. I drained the horseradish well before adding to the sour cream.

I found this to be very easy to make and very tasty! I used it for a rib roast and my guests just loved it.

I made this for the second time for Christmas dinner and was looking forward to enjoying it again with the beef tenderloin. Unfortunately, I grabbed the wrong jar in the grocery store and ended up buying horseradish SAUCE, a vile concoction that tastes and smells eerily similar to Miracle Whip, instead of prepared horseradish. By the time I noticed it was too late to go back to the store. I made the sauce anyway and it was a little better after the addition of the other ingredients. Ultimately it didn't seem to make a difference to my guests, but whatever you do, check the labels when buying the horseradish!

This was great with roast beef-we had it on X-mas day. I would make again-very easy.

Outstanding! I suggest making a day ahead for flavors to blend. Thined slightly with a little cream. Great with prime rib even better with roast beef and carmelized onion sandwichs made with the leftover roast.

Made this with prime rib for my Christmas dinner. Delicious with the beef and a big hit with family and friends. And, so easy! No time to make the porcini sauce the menu suggested!

This was great with the roast, and even better the next day on a sandwich with the roast beef leftovers! I forgot to drain the horseradish, but it still turned out delicious.

A very tasty compliment to roast beef. Also very good with corned beef!
