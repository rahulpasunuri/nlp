Not sure why I didn't review this the first time we had it. We enjoyed the different spices on rib eyes not sirloin...a matter of preference. The "chutney" is great. Any leftover "chutney" would be great with lamb.

Not sure why I didn't review this when I first made it but we enjoyed the different spices and the really good "chutney". Instead of sirloin we grilled rib eyes... just a matter of preference. I think the leftover "chutney" will be great with lamb.

I used ground beef instead of steak and the result was a little on the dry side. But the chutney was wonderful - double the recipe because you'll run out and want more.

I did not have any steak but I DID have ground beef. Mixed the spice mixture in with this and browned it. Served over rice. YUMMY. Another time I mixed the spices and ground beef and made hamburger patties. Unusual and very appealing. Great flavor.

This was alright. I broiled it maybe that was the problem. Next time I will grill it. I love a grilled steak with a WARM pink center. But every time I make it at home it goes cold the minute it's off the heat. Anyone have the magic secret for a medium rare yet hot steak? Much appreciated.

I thought this was terrible! I love curry but this dish just came out horribly! My husband thought it was gross!

I found this recipe on the site and found it intriguing. I enjoyed the flavors of the spices. I felt it worked well for beef and would probably fare as well, if not better for pork, chicken or lamb. I didn't have the particular cut of beef the recipe called for, but had London Broil steaks and it was just great.

The recipe and the chutney or sauce were very intriguing. The tastes of the spices were tantalizing to the palate. The only problem I had with the meal was the quality of my sirloin which does not reflect against the recipe, but my butcher.

Great new flavour. I left out the olive oil and just sprinkled it over the meat both sides and let stand for about 15 minutes. Will also try it on lamb and chicken.

Actually I use this marinade for chicken, and it's excellent. A very flavourful marinade for grilled chicken.

This was delicious. I made it inside on a grill pan and it came out perfectly. I did cook it a bit more than the recipe recommended, though. I would make it again. The spices really mixed well and added something completely different to the beef.
