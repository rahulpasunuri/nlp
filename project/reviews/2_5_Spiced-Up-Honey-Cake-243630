Not as good as my mother-in-law's honey cake, but this comes a very close second. Moist and not too sweet, I love that I can taste the honey. Worked great in a bundt pan.

This is a pretty good cake. Taking other reviewers' advice i oiled and floured the pans -- 9" and 6" springform pans. I had unbleached all-purpose flour which is usually a bit higher in protien and the recipe didn't say what type of flour to use. Because another reviewer said their cake was dry I replaced half the all-purpose with pastry flour (whole wheat). I also used olive oil instead of canola, and doubled the glaze (but didn't use all of it). The taste and texture were quite good but mine was still a little dry. I might try making this with soy milk instead of coffee, or using 100% pastry or cake flour.

I've learned last year that adding an apple cut in very small pieces add flavor and moisture to the cake

The incorrect measurements referred to in previous comments have been corrected in this recipe. There still are two issues though: the recipe neglects to say how or when to mix the wet and dry ingredients. I opted to add the dry ingredients to the wet in three additions, blending until incorporated after each, and then blending fairly well after the last addition. Also: you must butter and flour the bundt pan. Do not just oil it as the recipe says - that resulted in a broken cake for me. I should have heeded my better judgement to grease and flour the pan as I normally would. This cake was not dry at all for me - it was nicely moist and very spicy. It was a pretty good cake even split in half as it was from the pan mishap. It wasn't my favorite spice cake ever, but it was pretty good. I'd also double the icing/topping next time, if I don't find a better honey cake recipe.

Mine came out REALLY dry... and it looked so pretty-- so really disappointing. Ah well... it's a New Year so I will let this go:)

This is much better than your grandmother's honey cake! Moist and more the texture of a regular cake, it was a hit for the holiday. I reduced the amount of ginger and subbed cloves for the coriander. Didn't bother with the glaze. I added the flour in 4 additions, then mixed the whole thing a bit longer to combine fully. (I think this was the part missing from the recipe).

Thank you, Summer1216, for the rest of the ingredients. The middle of the recipe is missing some information as well.

The instructions say to "combine the honey, oil, coffee, and vanilla..." but I don't see oil or coffee in the list of ingredients. What's the story?

how much honey? how much oil? how much coffee? don't you proof read?

Rating: 0
the directions state add oil and coffee but you do not have this on your ingredients list. Just thought I'd point that out.
