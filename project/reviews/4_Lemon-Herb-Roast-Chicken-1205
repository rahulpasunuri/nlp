I swore I would never roast a chicken. Why? Because the ones I get at Costco are so good and so cheap why go to the effort? But my daughter bought a roaster and decided she didn't want to bother to cook it so there I was with a chicken I had to do something with. Well, I made this recipe and it is fantastic! The only thing I did differently from the recipe is that I brined the bird in 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of kosher salt per gallon of water over night. I also placed a cut up orange in the chicken during brining removing it before cooking.

I LOVE this chicken. It's tasty, easy and looks great! Whenever I make it people comment about how moist the chicken is. This time, I used pre-packaged fresh 'poultry herbs' and omitted the bay leaves. Tasty.

I've been making this chicken since the recipe first appeared (in fact I still have the original magazine from Jan. '96!). It is awesome. Key is definitely fresh herbs. You can cut down the butter by using a bit of olive oil with the herb-butter combo. Get a gravy separator for separating the fat at the end. Makes life much easier.

I've been making this dish for years... ever since it came out in the original magazine article (which I have). This is one of my family's most favorite dishes. My adult children requested the recipe from me and now it appears on their table as well. The real key is to use FRESH herbs! It is so so good!!!

and I always thought roasting whole birds was so complicated! have made several times now, and my guests always love it! the bird looks beautiful, the gravy is amazing, although I didn't let the fat separate from the juices long enough, so it was a little greasy, but no one seemed to mind. I used a food processor to make the herb butter. Wish I'd made a little extra to use on some bread for crutons!

We loved the flavor and the juicy texture! Being a seasoned restaurant server for many years in some of New Englands finest establishments it held a 4 fork rating! Though I did add a personal touch, I deglazed the pan with a little white wine before making the sauce and added lemon capers just before finishing it off.

Usually I avoid recipes that result in chicken gravy because I dislike cream gravies, but this was like Thanksgiving without that sleepy feeling! Although I've been cooking for years, this was my first gravy, and, like one of the previous reviewers, it also separated, but my favorite chef (Mom) explained that it takes 10-15 minutes for the pan drippings to cool enough for the fat to separate out and float to the top. I wish the recipe itself would have mentioned this, for us gravy neophytes! Even so, when I removed the solid layer of fat from the top of the refrigerated gravy the next day and added some chicken broth to thin the remaining sauce back to viscosity, it was PERFECT! I will definitely make this again, but I would encourage other people who are new to gravy to keep an experienced cook on hand (or on the phone) to fill in any knowledge gaps.

I prepared this for our Passover Seder last night, using Parve margarine in lieu of butter. I also substituted potato starch for flour in the gravy. I had a fresh lemon from a friend's sister's lemon tree in CA. I used the zest of one whole lemon, then squeezed the juice onto the chicken. I placed the squeezed out halves in the cavity while roasting. I never did get to taste the gravy but the chicken was DELISH!

Rating: 3
Three and a half, actually. My only change was to quarter the lemon from which the zest came and put it in the cavity, which was good. I had trouble with the gravy separating -- any advice? And finally, note that a smaller chicken (mine was about 4.5 pounds) doesn't really take less long to cook. I thought it would but had to put it back in. All around, a great recipe, though.

Love this recipe. I make it all the time and have started experimenting with variations. For Indian Butter chicken, try this mixture instead: Same amount of butter, add garam masala, tandoori masala, lime zest, garlic, ginger, salt and pepper. Continue following the recipe. Delicious with some naan and raita.

I've been making this recipe since it first appeared in Bon Appetit several years ago. It is always awesome. I've reduced the amount butter, with good results. I now use a combination of a little bit of butter and oil on the chicken, and it still tastes rich and yummy. I also toss some quartered potatoes in the pan during the last 45 minutes of cooking. Decadent!!!

Really delicious. I used fresh rosemary and dried thyme. I didnt use all the herb butter, it seemed like too much. Chicken came out fork tender and juicy anyway. Everyone loved the gravy.

This dish was too greasy for me. All of that butter was too much. The flavor was sort of bland as well, and I added more fresh thyme and rosemary (as well as stuff the chicken with lemon and rosemary). I would not make this dish again.

I'm a chicken addict and could probably eat it every day, so have tried a few recipes. This is one the best so far. Tender, great flavour and a fabulous gravy. The entire family liked it.

This recipe is a keeper. Went the dry herb route. Didn't have any lemons, didn't make the gravy and it still turned out amazing. Added an extra clove of garlic. Yumm. Very moist and flavorful. This will be a good one for a dinner party.

I served this to my sister's English in-laws who are very "meat and potatoes" kind of folks. They loved it and even asked for the recipe. I did make changes, however. I used a pan full of bone-in, skin-on chicken breasts rather than a whole chicken. I added some lemon juice to the herb butter and I sliced a couple of lemons very thin and baked them on top of the breasts which also made a lovely presentation. My gravy was more lemony because of the juice, so I might leave that out of the butter next time and just squeeze lemons over the buttered chicken. Easy and very tasty. Highly recommended.

Very good !! Just made over the weekend. I didn't make the gravy recipe - I just made my own traditional gray. I tucked thinly sliced onions & fresh thyme under the skin, along with the butter. The roasted chicken tasted heavenly! Will make again & again. The butter really makes for great flavor!!!

The chicken turned out pretty good, I guess, but it didn't taste very lemony!!! If I ever make it again, I'd triple the grated lemon called for in the recipe, or add some lemon juice to the cooking pan.

Perfectly roasted chicken. The gravy is absolutely delicious!

This chicken came out perfectly - the instructions were described exactly right. I was a little short on the butter, so I added a little olive oil to the butten mixture. The skin browned beautifully, and the gravy was a lovely color. I also stuffed mine with lemons, fresh herbs and garlic. All the flavors melded into a great sauce.

Rating: 4
I was extremely proud of the way the chicken came out. The herb butter under the skin made all the difference. It was moist, juicy, full of flavor and oh so aromatic. I stuffed the cavity of the chicken with my grated lemons and it filled the room with this amazing smell. I will use this recipe again and again.

this is not fair to refer to this recipe as a "jewish" chicken recipe. There would never be a mention of "Butter" in a "jewish" chicken recipe. get your "ethnic recipe requirements" correct! although it looks intersting...i am not inclined to try something that starts out incorrectly!

This was my first-ever attempt at roasting a chicken, but thanks to all the helpful tips posted by previous reviewers I was able to produce a tasty chicken with confidence. As suggested by several people, I placed garlic, rosemary/thyme sprigs and a lemon wedge in the cavity. In a separate dish, I made roast baby-potatoes tossed with olive oil, rosemary and lemon juice. The gravy was wonderful.

This is one of the best chicken dishes I have ever found. The seasonings on the bird were delicious and the accompanying sauce was great over mashed potatoes. I used a really big chicken, which was a good thing because my family devoured it.

I just made this for my family. Although I forgot the garlic in the butter. Everybody loved it, but they felt that the gravy was a bit too lemony. Next time I will put in the garlic and see if I can reduce the lemon flavor in the gravy while keeping it in the chicken.

How can this in anyway be considered a Jewish chicken recipe? There are so many good authentic Jewish Roast Chicken recipes! I have never heard of a Jewish chicken recipe that mixes chicken and butter! I wasnt expecting a kosher recipe, but this is not even close! Althought the recipe looks good, I think you could do better with something theat is more"Jewish"

Very good with chicken or Cornish Game Hen. I also add a cut-up lemon in the cavity for extra lemony flavor. My husband loves it!

Wonderful dish! Splurged with fresh herbs and stuffed extra heads of garlic and lemon into the chicken prior to baking. We used a nice buttery Chardonnay, roasted vegetables and a salad to round out the meal. Everyone raved about the flavor and moistness of the chicken. For a 7lb bird, the baking time was more around 2 - 2.5 hours at reduced temperature.

This was my first time roasting a 7 pound chicken. I served it at a small dinner party and we all went back for seconds. It tasted even better the next day. The preparation didn't take long and the recipe was easy to follow. I used fresh rosemary and dried thyme. It was a hit!

This was very good. The chicken was so moist and tender and the gravy was light but tasty. I served it with white rice. A wild rice would be very good with the gravy as well. This is a simple recipe with wonderful results.

I decided to make this recipe after reading on line reviews. Really liked it. I didn't have fresh thyme, so used the alternative dried along with the fresh rosemary . We thought the gravy was excellent. I would definitely make this recipe again.

I have not made this dish. I was just looking for Kosher recipes and notice that this one is listed under Jewish cooking but combines chicken and butter. This is not Kosher. I wanted to note this in a review just in case anyone unfamiliar with kashrut was thinking of making it for a Jewish friend who keep Kosher. If so they should substitute margerine for the butter. I know nothing tastes like butter but if you are cooking for someone who keeps kosher they will be use to making this sacrifice. They will also appreciate you respecting the rules of their religion.

Delicious - but I had a bit of difficulty with the gravy. I added baby carrots to the roasting pan and poured olive oil over them - they were out of this world! The chicken was so tender and flavorful - I threw my old roasted chicken recipe out!

I've been making this ever since it came out in the magazine. Always incredible! Try making the herb butter (always fresh, not dried) ahead of time, it picks up the garlic/herb/lemon flavor. You can also spread it under the leg skin if you're careful, for even more intense flavor. Very moist and delicious.

AWESOME! I scaled down the butter a bit and added more garlic and lemon. I will most definitely make this again!

As a novice to roasting a whole chicken, (I usually prefer using boneless breast), I found the recipe simple and the results much better than most roast chicken I've had. I followed others' recommendations adding lemon wedges to the breast cavity and using fresh herbs vs. dried. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes and dill carrots. My guests and husband loved this "down home", but very tasty type of meal for a change!

Disappointing. After all the rave reviews, I expected this chicken to be out-of-this-world, which, in my humble opinion, it was not. I did use dried herbs instead of fresh, which may have negatively affected the outcome. Although the chicken was certainly moist, I thought the flavors were dull and boring. I had high hopes for the gravy, too, but the color was unappetizing, and it lacked flavor. Sorry, but this recipe did not taste excellent enough to justify the effort I put into it.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. I placed a cut-up lemon, the twigs from my fresh herbs, and 3 cloves of garlic in the chicken while it roasted. I think this made the juices more flavorful when added to the gravy. I would definitely make this again.

Great! Moist and delicious. I used Sherry instead of the wine and it was an excellent substitute in the gravy. I also put a lemon in the cavity of the chicken. I would try to cut down on the butter a little next time.

Sacramento, I think you're telling us rather more than we need to know about the impact of this recipe. It sure is good, though. I have a similar recipe from some long-lost copy of Bon Appetit that uses store-bought pesto sauce in place of the herb butter (rubbed under the chicken skin & the excess put into the cavity) & the gravy finished in the same way. I think it may even be better.

This was the best roast chicken I ever made...Incredibly moist and juicy. I also put lemon wedges in the cavity, and added half the broth and white wine to the pan 20 minutes into roasting. Worked great! DEFINITELY make this one if you're looking for roast chicken.

This is really good. <--- Expect something very pleasant, not overwhelming. If you're not a fan of thyme, no worry, the flavors meld together so well, you don't pick up a strong sense of herbieness. (We used a coffee grinder to chop the fresh herbs) The gravy is very good. The subtle lemon flavor is a nice twist. I would recommend at least 2 teaspoons of salt for flavor. We used one and could hardly tast the salt. Eager to try this at a dinner party!

I've never tried roasting a whole chicken before I saw this recipe, but was feeling ambitious, so I tried it. It turned out incredible - perfectly done and tasted amazing.

New Jersey, smooth your feathers down and relax. There is a simple explantion for all of the confusion. This recipe is inadvertantly being shown on a Jewish cooking site as "Kosher" and at the same time it's being shown on the Epicurious site. The reviewers who commented that this chicken shouldn't have been on the Kosher site were quite correct because it is not Kosher. And Pennsylvania was just questioning why "Kosher" even came up.

Great recipe, too bad the comments on it are marred by the lady who has a problem with the word "kosher" being mentioned on a site she visits and who can't spell Pennsylvania--for your info, a "site" can't be kosher, but meat can be. Animals must be killed in a certain way in order to be considered kosher. People are allowed to be ignorant in any which way they please in a free country.

I must agree with the previous comments regarding the use of butter with chicken. I assume that non-dairy margarine would work too, but it is inappropriate to put a recipe that is non-kosher as written on a "Jewish cooking" site.

Unfortunately, I cannot make this recipe. I think it is wrong to include a non-kosher chicken dish as the main chicken dish for a jewish cooking page. Proper Jewish cooking does not mix dairy(butter) with meat.

I will definately make this again--its excellent, and quite easy to make. I do prefer to use Cornish Hens instead of roasting chickens because they are not as fatty. I roasted the small hens at 450 for 20 minutes and then at 350 for 1 hr--the skin was beautifully browned & crisp.

I agree with the other reviewers -- a really great chicken. One mistake I would recommend others not make is that i used fresh rosemary and dried thyme. The rosemary overwhelmed a bit.
