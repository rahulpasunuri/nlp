I doubled the filling at the suggestion of other reviewers. The orange flavor is strong, next time I may add a hint of vanilla. Sophisticated flavor! I'll make again but tweak the filling a bit.

not being a fan of chocolate (i know i know blasphemy but true) I made this anyway. I was impressed with the simple method and the results got raves from my testers. It might end up a staple of my make for others list but not my personal list. Oh and I did do the double filling, it seemed the right amount, I could see how the recipie amount might have been weak.

my husband and i thought these were just ok. nothing to rave about and the friends i gave them to weren't impressed. i made them bite-sized and though they were pretty, the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. i don't plan to make them again.

All I can say is Mmm, Mmm, Mmm! I followed the suggestion of several others & doubled the chocolate/orange filling. I also made a batch of icing using powdered sugar, orange juice, & a little vanilla. They were a huge hit when I served them for part of a Mother's Day brunch menu with my in-laws. Even my husband enjoyed, & he's not a huge fan of chocolate & orange flavors together.

used my homemade puff pastry and increased the chocolate and orange by 50% each--served with creme anglaise made with orange zest and orange flower water. such a fab dessert!! wish I had mock orange blossoms, but, alas--it's winter, so chocolate curls did the trick to garnish

So easy and surprisingly delicious! I would have preferred a bit more filling, but I have always liked chocolate more than pastry- my guests thought the proportions were perfect.

Easy and very tasty! A great way to use up leftovers from Christmas dinner!

I doubled the filling, skipped the egg, and served with vanilla bean ice cream. Utterly easy and decadent. You're really missing out if you don't try this recipe!

These were incredibly easy to make. I made a double batch but shouldn't have, because they were much bigger than I thought they'd be. The filling seemed scant, though my kids thought it was enough. I'd double the filling next time. They were easy to seal and I crimped them with fork tines. Very pretty & impressive, but also very light. Not much more than a dessert.

Good, but it's missing something that would take it to the 4-fork level. I made this with double the chocolate and triple the orange zest, which I think happened to be just the right proportion. Next time, I won't brush the edges with egg because it makes it so slippery and difficult to seal the edges. Also, there was plenty of pastry compared to the filling, so I would roll the pastry dough out and thin it just a little bit.

I rolled out the pastry sheet and cut more squares. I used semi-sweet chocolate chips, until I ran out, then I used white chocolate chips -- both versions were good. I plated with raspberry sauce and whipped cream to rave reviews.

Delicious - I did double the chocolate and orange zest as recommended. Used semi-sweet chocolate also. Was very good, very easy to make - I'll do this one again.

Very easy to prepare however, next time I would double the amount of filling. It was too blase' so I added some gourmet ice cream and fresh strawberries w/hot fudge to give it some pizazz and a better presentation for my guests at a book club meeting.
