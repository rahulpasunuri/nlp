As a vegetarian I replaced the lamb with seitan. Delicious!

Delicious. I'm a vegetarian and I substituted the lamb with seitan (wheat gluten protein). The flavors were great and it was fun to make and fun to eat.

I'm surprised this recipe hasn't gotten more attention. It has long been a favorite of mine for a quick, easy, and tasty meal. I substitute prepared hummus and tweak it with cayenne and cumin. I also saute onions with the lamb.

Yummy. I used humous instead of chickpeas to save on time and I used the softer/thicker type of pita bread. I'll definitely make this again.

I didn't find anything unappealing about the appearance of this dish. In fact, I thought it was quite festive (red bell pepper brunoise, and chopped mint were colorful). I cut the pizzas into 4 wedges each, and served it as an appetizer. Used feta cheese in keeping with the Mediterranean theme. The allspice in the lamb topping was a very tasty addition.

We love mediterranean flavors and lamb in particular,and this recipe was tasty. But it lacks in appearance. Sounds trivial, but presentation here really detracts --the appearance of the garbanzo and lamb mixture on the pizza just isn't very appetizing. Turned my husband off before he tasted it, although once he tried it he did admit it was tasty. Good for the family but probably wouldn't serve it to guests.
