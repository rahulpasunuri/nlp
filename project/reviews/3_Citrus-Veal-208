This recipe is definitely 'light & easy'. For the first time, I wasn't the last person running into evening band practice. It was that quick to make. It tastes wonderful served over white rice. I rarely like fruity meats (referring to those nasty pineapple or peach hams, etc) and I really enjoyed this.
