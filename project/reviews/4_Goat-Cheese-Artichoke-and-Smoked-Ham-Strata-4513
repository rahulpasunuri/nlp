I have made this twice now and gotten rave reviews both times. I love the do ahead aspect of this dish. Next time I will add less salt. The ham and artichokes provide some, so adding 1 1/2 tsp is too much for my taste.

This tasted good but there are a many more strata recipes out there that are much easier to make, less mess, less cleanup - that taste as good or better.

I have made this strata every Christmas since it's printing in 1997. It is a must for my family, and it just wouldn't be Christmas without it. Fantastic flavors, and it makes Christmas morning so easy!

The first time I tasted this strata I had no idea what was inside... and it took about a millisecond for me to know I had to have the recipe. I originally thought it had pasta in it, because the bread is so tender and baked into the eggs and cheese. The ingredients get pricey... usually around $50 depending on the quality of the cheese, but it's so so so so worth it. And, if you're like me, it can last you several meals. This is easily the best strata I've ever had, and my most preferred way to have goat cheese. Yum!

Worth it. Lots of ingredients but it was sublime. I risked making it for family for the first time and it was a success. I will be making this again. Great for brunch entertaining.

We loved this! I did make a few changes to the recipe. I used half and half instead of whipping cream, 7 eggs, chopped fresh spinach (no need to cook it first), canned (not marinated) artichoke hearts, and herbed goat cheese instead of plain. I didn`t use any sage or herbes de Provence and just added a little extra thyme. I mixed it all together instead of layering. Beautiful and delicious!

Rating: 4
great brunch idea. made the following changes based on reading through the feedback:1) veggie only - added sauted leeks/spinach/garlic, blanched asparagus and roasted red peppers. 2) one sour dough loaf crust left on 3) 9 eggs 4) use less cheese and switched up type of cheese - 1/2 c fontina, 1/2 c grated romano and parrano cheeses 5) whisked 6 oz goat cheese into egg mixture along with all the spices. 6) substituted 2%milk for whole and fat free 1/2 and 1/2 for cream 7) did not use sage

I made this for Easter morning, and it was sooo good. Everyone loved it. Will certainly make again. Time consuming and the kitchen was a mess when I finished, but it was worth the cleanup!

My sister has been making this for our family on Christmas morning for years and it is what I look forward to. We eat this with fresh navel orange sections and Mimosas!! I would love to know the nutritional information because I always have some leftover and reheat small quantities after the holidays when I'm back on my healthy eating plan.

I have made this every New Years for brunch and it is always a hit. I substitute 2% milk for all the milk and cream and it still tastes rich. I also cut down on the amount of cheese. Other advantage for brunch is that it tastes good even cold.

I made this strata for a special brunch. It was delicious and will be made again in the future. When you eat it, just don't think about all the cheese and cream that goes in it.

This was perfect! So flavorful and a huge hit this morning! The only change I made was to omit the sage and instead double the thyme. Didn't have sage (nor do I prefer it) so subbed more thyme. Turned out perfect! A very happy accident. Highly recommend!

I love it. I was eating this strata while re-reading the reviews. These are the "my" changes, made on the advice of the other reviewers: Leave bread crusts on, the quantity = one loaf. Italian sausage for ham. Spinach and sundried tomatoes for artichoke hearts, especially for Christmas. Less fat content in the milk and cream. Less goat cheese. Add the herbs to the cream mixture, no need to layer seperately.

Rating: 4
This is rich and delicious. I used smoked marinated artichokes and 10 rather than 12 ounces goat cheese (that was the largest package I could find) and it was terrific! I did need to cook it about 10 minutes longer than suggested.

Rating: 3
Warm, rich, flavorful! However, I found that the herbes de Provence was too much, or the sage and thyme were too much because one or the other combination could easily cancel the other out. It also seemed like the goat cheese was too much, especially with the other cheeses. I would decrease the amount of goat cheese. Otherwise, easy, delicious! Worth it.

Rating: 4
Have made for every Christmas morning since originally published. I use Canadian Bacon instead of the ham. We do NOT rinse our artichokes, but I do slice artichoke quarters vertically in half. I cut the bottom crust off the sourdough, but leave the top on. This dish is even more transcendant when served with canned peaches - I find the lowest-added-sugar type. Something about that flavor combination is divine.

Delicious for a special occasion brunch. I used Proscuitto instead of the ham...a little too salty...next time I will omit the salt. I am making this again for New Years Day...am going to try adding some tomato.

LOVED this! I cut back on cheese, used fat-free half and half, and rinsed artichokes as suggested by others. I also used egg substitute, equivalent to 8 eggs. Used only 3/4 tsp salt, and half Herb de Provence. Guests raved.

I remade the strata (see my review from 9/22) cutting down on the herbs, but adding more egg. It was great! I completely rinsed the marinade off of the artichokes. I could actually taste individual flavors, very good. I still couldn't find sourdough, but ciabatta worked well.

I've made this more times than I can count - it's a real crowd pleaser - but often felt it was too salty. Lsat time I left out the ham for a vegetarian friend and it was perfect! Will make it that way from now on.

Love, love, love this recipe! I have made if for the past 5 years and love it. Served it at work parties, brunches, Christmas morning, anytime and it is always a hit. I do cut down on the goat cheese and add more eggs and milk. About 2 to 3 more eggs. It fills up the dish better when I do that. I have always used whole milk and half and half or cream which ever I have at the time. This recipe has never failed me yet. I plan to make it again this year for our company Christmas party.

Rating: 2
Pretty good, but too many overwhelming, competing flavors - and I like bold flavors. It turned out to be very salty and the herbs were overwhelming (I used fresh where called for and dried where called for). I "tested" it prior to making it for a brunch - when I make it again, I'm using unmarinated artichoke hearts, reducing the amount of salt, and reducing the herbs. I will also use 4 oz of goat cheese as suggested. I think I may add a couple more eggs or milk (it was a little bit dry) and may use 2% milk and half and half instead of whole milk and cream. I think a firm bread (like the sourdough it calls for) is essential. I used regular french bread from the grocery store (because they were out of sourdough) and it was too soft and gummy.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe and so versatile. Using the fresh herbs really makes it! For vegetarian friends I add sauteed mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes instead of the ham, but use your imagination for other possibilities. I usually reduce the amount of goat cheese to 4oz. as other reviewers recommend. Easy, delicious, and great for a pot luck brunch. Be prepared to provide the recipe when you make this!

Rating: 3
I tried to "half" this recipe to try it out with my co-workers before deciding whether to make it for an upcoming family reunion brunch. Judging from my co-workers' reactions, this will be a hit at my family brunch! I used ciabatta instead of sourdough, prosciutto instead of smoked ham, frozen artichoke hearts instead of marinated, and smaller proportions of dried herbs (because I didn't have fresh).

I put this together the night before a early morning brunch and it was a huge hit. I too cut back on the goat cheese to 4 oz., used chicken maple sausages instead of ham, added a couple more eggs and used a french peasant bread cut in chunks. This was delicious..

My family has made this recipe for a few years now, but since my sister and I don't eat ham, my mom started making it with smoked salmon instead! DELICIOUS! We use the rest of the recipe as is, and LOVE it - it's our Christmas dinner! It is certainly a bit of work - not difficult, just time consuming. But well worth it in my view. I just made it for friends and it was a huge hit yet again! PS - I didn't cut off the bread crusts and thought it was perfectly fine!

This came out very well. It takes a couple of hours to make but it is well worth the effort. I hosted a brunch and this dish was a great success. It is also a very hearty breakfast.

After reviewing other's comments, I too, cut back on the goat cheese - used 4 oz instead of 12 oz. Was concerned it wouldn't be enough, (as I LOVE goat cheese), but it was plenty and flavorful. Also, didn't have ham, so I crumbled and browned smoked chicken sausage, which worked very well. This is a VERY rich dish.

Rating: 4
This is an outstanding recipe, and a very simple technique. I did tweak it based in part on others' reviews--I used whatever leftover white bread I already had on hand and left the crusts on; used half of the amounts of cheese called for; used half & half instead of whipping cream, and subbed marjoram for the herbes do Provence ('cause I didn't have any on hand). The guests at my pre-Christmas brunch could not get enough of this one, and every last one of them demanded the recipe. A fabulous addition to any repertoire.

Rating: 4
Delicious as is. This is a great "do the night before" recipe, that frees up your morning, if you're serving it for brunch.

Rating: 3
This sounded so good, but the result was way too rich for my taste. All that cheese and cream . . . yikes! I'm surprised that my heart didn't go into fat overload! There was too much cheese in proportion to the bread, making it more of a cheese strata than anything else. I'll probably try it again, but use low- fat milk and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the whipping cream and whole milk. Add more bread. Use only a tiny portion of the ham. And less of all 3 cheeses.

Rating: 4
Excellent! I made this for Easter and everyone loved it (even my 2 year old). I left the ham out of half for my vegetarian mother in law and it was just as wonderful. I used the full amount of goat cheese because we love it. Its great to be able to wake up in the morning and throw this in the oven with no fuss!

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe - my whole family loved it! It is best when it soaks in the refrigerator overnight. The second time I reduced the goat cheese to 9 oz. and the fontina to 3/4 cup. This was plenty of cheese to keep it gooey and flavorful.

Amazing. My husband loved this strata. If I make this next year, I would definitely half the recipe as it's just us eating this days after (makes great leftovers). Also, I think you may be able to cut back some of the cheese on this. I only added 6 oz. of goat cheese as opposed to the 12 oz the recipe calls for. It was more than enough. I think you could half all the cheese amounts and have this come out just as cheesy. Made this with blueberry muffin tops recipe. Amazing!

Have reviewed this years ago but as I just made it again, I thought I add some info for those of you do ahead chefs. This can be frozen, thawed and reheated. No one will ever know! Also, if you are one of those who likes their stratas less "bready" you can cut the amount to 5 cups and put in 8 eggs. I have tried the lower fat versions but I DO see the difference therefore, I recommend you cut the carbs first. I know this recipe is a little involved but only 91% would make it again? Come on you guys--this is just too good!

I have made this a couple times and followed others advice. I decreased the artichokes to 1 1/2 can , used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 I decreased the milk by 3/4 of a cup and increased the eggs to 8 or 9. This got rave reviews from everyone who tried it! Letting it sit overnight is a must, the flavors are much better.

This recipe is one I go to again and again. Most recently I made it for a baby shower, using some of the cheese substitutions suggested by other reviewers, and the guests raved about it. I've never had a problem with the cook time, but I do suggest you let it set a bit before serving.

this recipe is a crowd pleaser. i substituted gouda for the fontina, used an entire french baguette instead of sourdough (left crust on) and used 8 eggs. i didn't use all of the artichokes, i found that 2 cans were plenty. don't skimp on the goat cheese, it is the best part. it completely filled my 9x13 pan, but didn't overflow in the oven (which it looked like it might do). this recipe fed about 18 people for breakfast, along with a coffee cake. delicious!!!

Delicious! I made this for Easter brunch and it was a huge hit. Very decadent! I used half and half for the whipping cream and skim milk rather than whole.

I will be making this for Christmas brunch this year, too!

As with many reviewers, I have found this strata to be excellent and open to many variations: never remove the crust,reduce the fat content of the dairy, add as many as a dozen eggs,cube the ham,add cayenne for a kick etc. The best part is it can be made a week ahead of time and frozen. I transport it as far as 8 hours in a cooler to many family gatherings. It will thaw overnight on the counter(gasp!no one has been poisoned yet)and be ready to go in the morning.

wow! i followed all the other readers' advice and did the following substitutions: omitted salt, omitted olive oil, subbed proscuitto for the ham, sun-dried tomatoes for the artichokes (which i don't like), used a pre-shredded mix of asiago, parmesan and fontina cheese, dotted on the goat cheese separately from the cream mix, used whole milk for the bread and half and half for the cream base. it was amazing!!! i prepared it the night before to make with the overnight french toast. this recipe i found to be somewhat expensive to make, but don't skimp on the ingredients or you'll regret it. definitely use sourdough bread - it's a winner!!

I have made this recipe every Christmas morning since it was published in 1997 and it always a hit. I suggested we try a different strata recipe this year and my 19 & 21 year old daughters shot me down. It is that good! Even my 5 year old nephew asked for seconds last year!

Excellent strata with a few alterations. I added sliced mushrooms and chopped sun-dried tomatoes. For half the recipe I reduced the goat cheese to 4 oz, 1 (6 1/2 oz)jar of artichokes, 3 eggs, and a combination of 2% and half and half for the liquid. There is a light version of this same recipe on the Cooking Light website.

Overall, I thought this dish was very good. The one comment I would make is that it needed a little more egg in the egg mixture as it never really "set" well in the middle, despite baking it extra time. The flavors were outstanding and it was a hit, but needed to be a little firmer, in my humble opinion.

This was a huge hit at a recent brunch I hosted. The guests all wanted the recipe. I followed the reviewers tips and did not blend the goat cheese, instead crumbling it on the layers. Agreed it is a bit time intensive, but since it can be made the night before it makes morning baking a snap with no mess in the kitchen come party time. Also, I usually use name cards to let people know what the dish is, and just reading the name of this dish got people excited about it before they even tasted it. Who doesn't love the sound of artichokes and goat cheese?

This is a very good recipe, although a bit time intensive. I doubled it to serve 30 people for brunch. Very rich and creamy, a little goes a long way!

Delicious! I used the chevre type of goat cheese and just crumbled it on the layers, instead of trying to blend it with the liquid. I used half-n-half instead of cream. I used Asiago instead of Parmesan. I omitted the garlic only because of my mother - otherwise would definitely include it. I think the olive oil with milk soak for the bread gives a nice flavor - don't leave it out! It easily makes 12 servings, and is great to be able to put it together the day before and relax and just pop in the oven the next morning.

I was not crazy about this dish. The spices create flavors that are VERY heavy - not a good dish for a brunch. Maybe better for a hearty winter dinner with a glass of Zinfandel. I think it's needs a double on the artichokes to lighten it up a bit.

Great recipe, although the whole milk & whipping cream are totally unnecessary. I used skim milk then fat free 1/2 & 1/2. I used 1/2 the amount of olive oil, and added a couple tablespoons of crushed garlic as well as a bit of stone-ground mustard to the mixture that you coat the bread cubes in. I also used mozzerella & goat cheese instead of all goat cheese. This was really good, but the goat cheese & proscuitto strata recipe from this site is better. You can always add artichoke to that.

Holy YUM! This is so good, everyone I've made it for has raved. It's a little labor-intensive (I say this about anything that requires grating) but very much worth it. The only thing I change is adding an extra egg and mushrooms, omitting olive oil, using skim instead of whole milk, and using 6oz goat-6oz mozzerella cheese instead of all goat.

Well, I just love this. I just prepared it for the first time for Easter brunch, and everyone loved it. I did change a few things, as did others. I used not quite as much bread as is called for, and I used 8 eggs. I also used 8 oz of goat cheese and added some mozzeralla in place of the rest. It's not quite so rich that way, nor as expensive. I also substituted 2% milk and half & half, like others did. I doubled the recipe, since I had 13 for brunch, and I had enough for a small army. I would say that the recipe serves quite a few more than 8 - probably more like 12.

Made this the night before a luncheon for a diverse group of women. They loved it! Made changes to satisfy dietary & taste requirements. As not everyone loves goat cheese, I substituted BOURSIN, and as such, reduced the amount of garlic. Used smoked chicken instead of ham. Used marinated artichoke bottoms in place of marinated artichokes + added sun dried tomatoes. Per prior reviews, used 2% milk & 1/2 & 1/2. Also, used 8 eggs(the vitamin E and omega-3, health-conscious variety). Used jack in place of fontina, as I didn't have the time or patience to bother w/attempting to grate fontina(which I've found to be problematic in the past). Delicious results!!!! All guests requested the recipe!!!

V. good brunch/dinner recipe for group. Freezes (baked) and microwaves v. well. Changes: 1) milk/half n half instead of cream; 2) much too salty first time even using less parm than called for. use much less parm and/or try for low sodium. 3) Smoked ham is best but if unavail. use low sodium ham. 4) Don't add salt to custard. 5) scant 8 oz. goat cheese. 6) maybe a little more bread (sourdough is key); keep crusts on some. 7) maybe slightly fewer artichokes. 8) xtra pepper 9) dot on goat cheese instead of recipe instructions (clumps otherwise). 10) don't add oil. 11) didn't have herbes de provence 12) might have used a little less fontina (was fine)

What happened? When I see an epicurious recipe with so many happy reviewers, I'm almost always pleased with the recipe results myself. But this time I was pretty disappointed. I thought the cooking time was way off (it needed another 30 minutes to bake) and the flavors were slightly bitter, salty and too rich. I followed this recipe down to the last detail. I served this for the first time at Christmas brunch (thinking that with so many excellent reviews I wouldn't need to test it first before serving it). But everyone ate it in silence. No compliments or requests for the recipe. I'm sure they were disappointed- I know I was.

I made this recipe for a baby shower brunch and everyone was very impressed. I doubled the recipe and saved the second casserole for Christmas morning. It was delicious!

Halved this recipe to serve 4. Delicious but very rich. Would make again but would (1) leave out olive oil, (2) use milk instead of whipping cream in the egg mixture, (3) add an extra egg or two, and (4) cut down on the goat cheese by about 1/3. Still, delicious and a great make-ahead dish (I made it for New Year's Day).

This was yummy, but I wish I had read all the reviews before starting out! Definitely needs to be lightened up as suggested below. Also, I will add another egg or two because I like my strata "eggier". I'd de-fat the dairy liquids and cut down on cheese, esp. the Fontina.

This is by-far my favorite strata. I've made most from this website, but this one is the best. It is very rich so you do not tend to eat as much as a normal strata or breakfast casserole so I would say it serves more like 10 - 12 people. It's also just as good heated up the following day.

This is a great meal!! I will say that I ended up substituting the artichokes with Spinach and Sun Dried Tomatoes and the Ham with Roasted Bell Pepper. Instead of Fontina, I used Asiago cheese, which gave it a nice kick. I made this for a couple of friends and they both just loved it! Please remember that this recipe makes 8 servings...I will cut it in half next time or consider freezing the remaining portions. Definitely a meal you can be VERY creative with!

Yum! Made this for a brunch with 6 adults, with a salad (field greens, candied pecans goat cheese, craisins and balsamic vinegarette), fruit, a rosemary baguette and Mimosas. Followed the advice of previous reviewers and cut down on the fat (2% milk vs. whole milk, 1/2 and 1/2 vs. whipping cream, and omitted the olive oil). Still very rich! Also, not being a huge fan of artichoke hearts, I only used 2 jars instead of 3. It was beautiful and delicious.

This dish is fabulous and always impresses my guests. The last two times I made it, I did a "low-carb" version and it was every bit as good. I Mixed all ingredients in one step, deleting the bread and increasing the egg by two and, using mostly heavy cream (no cream and milk) and increasing the cheese a bit - all with the goal of my modified version holding together nicely. It worked!!!

OK, I actually didn't get to try this because I made it for a bake sale at work and it sold out too quickly. However, based on my co-workers' & husband's reviews, it was fantastic.

This was a big hit at a recent brunch. Based on otehr reviews, I substituted half- n- half for the whipping cream and omitted the olive oil and the end result was fantastic. Easy to prepare but a bit time- consuming to decrust the bread/ chop everything up- however, the beauty is you can do it all the night before and then just pop it in the oven before your guests arrive. I served it to a group of 8 adults with turkey sausages, fruit salad, and banana- choco chip muffins (also on this site) and it was a great success.

Made this dish for Christmas breakfast with family. Results were very good, but I would alter dish slightly when I make it again.

I made this ahead for Christmas brunch and it was a big hit. I made a mistake while putting it together, forgetting to add the goat cheese until after I had it all layered and assembled. To solve the problem, I dumped the whole bit into a large bowl, added the goat cheese, and put it all back into the baking pan. The moral of the story is that the rather painstaking process of layering is not necessary; it came out great even when "thrown together."

This is a must have for our family every year since the recipe first came out -- Now my work group puts in their request as well. I've always replace the ham with an equal amount of roasted red pepper. Fabulous.

Fabulous recipe! Wonderfully rich and simple to prepare ahead of time. It is superb as a special brunch or would be delightful for a dinner party. I followed the recipe as written and would not change a thing!

I've made this twice and people loved it both times. The second time I "lightened" it up with half and half instead of the whipping cream, 2% milk instead of whole milk, and omitted the olive oil. I also used crab and shrimp instead of smoked ham, which I will definitely do again (I thought the ham version was alittle too salty.) I added some chopped red pepper and a splash of tabasco in the seafood version, too. Next time I think I'll experiement with different kinds of cheese and try the sun dried tomatoes perhaps with some prosciutto. This is definitely a rich dish, not for every day - but great for a special occasion, because you can make it ahead of time (and it makes quite a bit, too -- with a nice salad, this recipe easily fed 10).

This dish was a wonderful brunch for friends this past weekend. Leftovers with a nice salad was delightful. I omitted the olive oil - couldn't see why it was necessary and I didn't have goat cheese so I added 1/2 cup of additional Fontina cheese. This is a keeper and I will enjoy serving it again.

Rating: 4
This is such a wonderfully simple dish with complex and complimentary flavors. I like to add sun dried tomatoes to add that extra little flavor. It's ideal for the hostess that wants to be able to spend time socializing rather then cooking at the party, since it can be made ahead of time.

I found this recipe easy, time-efficient and very tasty! I made it for a dinner party with a vegetarian crowd and left out the ham, everyone loved it! The only complaint I have is the amount of cream and cheese packed in there. The next time, I will definitely try to lighten it up.

I enjoyed this recipe. I "halved" it & prepared it in an 8 x 8 glass dish. I used 3 eggs & I followed the suggestion of layering the goat cheese with the other ingredients & prepared the recipe with ~ 6 oz. chopped proscuitto. The ham was salty & next time, I will omit the salt mixed into the egg (if I use the salty ham.) I also used ~ 8oz of marinated artichokes & rinsed them first. The cooking time was 20 - 25 minutes. All in all, this is a delicious recipe (even if my 4 yr old & 2 yr. old wouldn't touch it!) I will definitely make it again!

Rating: 4
An amazing tasting dish! I have made it at least 10 times & everytime there are requests for the recipe. I use 2% milk, 1/2 & 1/2 for the cream, more garlic, black forest ham & chop the artichoke hearts smaller. It is an orgasmic dish!!!

Rating: 4
Far more work than I expected, but it's remarkably tasty. How could people think this is bland? Verrry rich too. Talk about post-prandial -- all of us turned into zombies in the afternoon. Next time, I will add the goat cheese with the Fontina and Parmesan. Mixing the goat cheese into the cream made it thick and difficult to pour evenly. I should have read Westfield NJ's advice beforehand!

Rating: 4
I have made this twice now: The first time I made it exactly as the recipe said. It took more like 1 hr and 15 minutes to bake, but it was delicious. I used half-and-half instead of cream. The second time I made lots of substitutions and liked it better. Iused sundried tomatoes instead of the artichoke hearts,chicken/sweet red pepper sausage instead of the ham, swiss instead of the fontina cheese, feta instead of the montrachet, and whole milk instead of the cream and I liked it even better. This ones a winner no matter what you do to it.

Our whole family loves this recipe -- it's become a traditional holiday brunch favorite.

This is a great example of what may be the 'world's largest test kitchen' in action. By reading all the other suggestions, I was able to modify the recipe and have it come out great the first time. Followed the suggestion about substituting half and half for cream and leaving out the olive oil to make it a lighter dish, also subbed spinach for the artichokes (personal preference). The goat cheese / smoked meat combo are what makes it special. Nice elegant strata for brunch entertaining.

Rating: 4
This recipe is wonderful. Have made it three times and always received rave reviews. Substituted smoked chicken for the ham and added more parmesan for the Fontina. Turned out great. A bit of prep work but well worth it. A bonus that it can be prepared in advance.

I (and my guests) loved this recipe! I too cut down on the fat by using only milk, no cream. And I used dark sourdough bread, since I'm in Germany and white sourdough is relatively rare. I also left the crusts on, and added sun-dried tomatoes, as someone previously suggested. A huge hit at the brunch!

Rating: 3
This was good, and we seriously reduced the fat (I can't imagine eating this cooked per the recipe; it would be much too heavy and rich). Used 2% milk and no oil to soak bread; half-and-half instead of cream, and 1/2 the amounts of fontina (we used swiss) and parmesan. I wasn't wild about the artichoke hearts and would substitute mushrooms next time. Still, it's great for a make-ahead brunch; would make again

We served this dish for Easter Brunch and it was a true success! Our guests went back for more. It went nicely with fresh fruit and muffins. We will definitely use it again.

My fiance and I really enjoyed this recipe, but there is one step I would change. Next time I will dot the layers with the goat cheese instead of mixing it into the cream mixture. I ended up with big lumps of cheese. It should be layered with the ham, artichoke hearts and herbs. I will definitely make it again. This recipe is perfect when you have company coming over for brunch the next day.

Rating: 4
This looked beautiful -- golden and bubbly. I used half-and-half in place of the milk and cream. Chopped proscuitto replaced the ham. I didn't have fontina (my favorite cheese!) on hand, and the recipe turned out fine without that extra cup of cheese (and fat). My husband said it could be cheesier, so I will add the fontina next time.

Rating: 3
Although this recipe turned out great and got rave reviews, it was too rich for me. I felt like I was eating a cheesecake for breakfast -- delicious but not what I want to start the day off with. I did substitute mushrooms for the ham as I needed a no-meat dish. My guests loved it.

I was so excited to make this dish for Mother's Day this year. I spent well over $45.00 making this dish alone. It is way overrated by these other people. I made it like the recipe called for. It had very little taste and was not pretty at all. I was disgustingly disappointed and didn't even want to eat it. I had read the reviews and thought how could anyone think this was bad. It has such wonderful ingredients, etc. Trust me, it is not worth the time or money.

I made this again last week for my book club. This time I omitted ham & added mushrooms & sun-dried tomatoes. I also left out the fontina cheese & added extra parmesan & goat cheese. I did not use the herbs either -- just garlic, salt & pepper. I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream. It was great! YUMMY!

Rating: 4
This recipe was FANTASTIC. I made it for a work breakfast and was wowed by the awesome repsonses. I substituted medium cheddar for the fontina and 1 1/2 c. Feta for the Montrachet. I also left out the ham but added sun-dried tomatoes and Jimmy Dean's HOT sausage. It certainly wasn't bland. I made the changes because my sister was served the dish before and said it was somewhat bland, as a few of the reviews stated. I highly recommend this as it was EASY and yummy. =)

Rating: 3
This strata is great! I used half and half cream and 2%milk and cut w-a-a-a-ay down on the cheese and it was still fantastic! To make things easier I didn't cube the bread nor cut off the crusts ... no one complained. Also used only one layer of ham and artichokes (in the centre), and used a small amount of pecorini cheese on top (substituted for fontina). Leftovers were just as good as the original! This is a keeper. Will try it with sun-dried tomatoes next time for colour.

I made this strata for Christmas brunch. It looked so good, it got it's picture taken! Then when we tasted it, it was soooo good, everyone had to have more even though we were stuffed! In fact, the family is still talking about it in wistful tones. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe was a huge hit at a baby shower I hosted. I actually made a few changes: I used prosciutto instead of smoked ham,, elimiated the artichokes, added pesto and fresh basil instead of herbs, and used only about 1/2 tsp salt. The result was great. I am trying another version with smoked salmon, sauteed fennel, shallots, and thyme -- it should be just as great.

We substituted crumbled smoked salmon for the meat. Fabulous!

I've made this several times, and it's always a winner. I agree with other suggestions to lighten it up, but I always use very good quality Montrachet--not feta, which can be somewhat harsh. The montrachet is milder and allows the herbs and ham flavors to come through. I've always used turkey ham, however a friend raved over prosciutto. This is the perfect main course brunch item.

I made this for a special Christmas brunch for friends before going to an afternoon concert. Everyone loved it. I used half and half instead of the heavy cream, but otherwise no changes, and it turned out perfectly. I will definitely keep this recipe. I served it with the Oranges with Spiced Cranberries and Walnuts salad. The combination was perfect.

This was the star of a freinds baby shower yesterday, it was easy to assemble (used store baught plain stuffing instead of cubing bread) and dried herbs(less than if using fresh)not at all a "big gloppy mess" infact it was filling, tasty, and somthing different from what you usually see at a shower brunch. everyone asked for the recipe.

I was hoping this was the special brunch recipe I was looking for, but it isn't. The strata baked well (took me l hr. 10 min. at low altitude) and was attractive. However, it was somewhat salty. I love goat cheese, but found a flavor a little overwhelming. Also use a good quality herbs de provence. For the time it took I don't believe the results are worth the effort.

My sister's sister-in-law made this for our nephew Jack's baby shower and it was fabulous. The flavors meld so well overnight and once baked, it is crunchy and creamy and really, really good. I've made it with low-fat dairy choices and it was just as good and not so guilt-inducing!

I thought this dish was fantastic! My parents asked for the recipe to serve at their bed & breakfast. I omitted the oil in the soak, and would omit the ham next time (couldn't taste it).

I will definately make this again!

YUMMY--a 3.5. I doubled the recipe for a birthday brunch for and made these changes based on previous reviews: I used 2% milk and omitted the oil when soaking the bread. I substituted half and half for the heavy cream. Because I wanted a vegetarian dish--(I also served a shrimp salad, chicken salad, fresh fruit, and assorted breads)--I eliminated the ham and added sun dried tomatoes. I used three 14 oz cans of water packed artichokes (for TWO recipes) and baked in two 9 x 13 pans. I really can't imagine this cooked as written--I love rich food but it sounds to me like it would be way too heavy. Incidentally, Greenwich on 1/20/00, are you sure you weren't confused--I didn't see any negative reviews of this recipe and none from Newton. Don't let Greenwich discourage you from trying this!!

I made this for over Thanksgiving weekend. Served it to guests that were staying with us, served leftovers to father-in-law who visited the following weekend and still had some leftover for me which was great. Thought the leftovers were better. I only used about half the artichokes called for but still felt they were overwhelming. I usually LOVE artichokes. Will use even less the next time I make it.

Yummy! I made this for a New Years Day brunch and it received raves. It is very rich, so next time I will cut out some of the cheese and maybe add some veggies. One reviewer suggested sliced tomatos on the top. Also, due to the richness, next time I will serve it with something simple.

This was a great dish, served it for New Years brunch. The dish was a bit on the rich side so serving it with another rich dish was a bit of a mistake. Most gave two thumbs up and had seconds as well. I found it an easy dish to make and prepared it the day before, refrigerating it before cooking.

Great do-ahead party dish; even kids seem to like it. Needs to cook longer than stated -- almost half again as long in my oven. We used half-and-half in place of heavy cream and didn't miss the extra fat (with three kinds of cheese, it's plenty rich). Great for brunch with a simple spinach salad.
