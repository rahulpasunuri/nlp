This was somewhat of a disappointment. It was a little too tart and the texture was not what we expected.

I am an 8 year old cook. I liked this dessert because it was fun to make and my family loved it! I will be sure to make this dessert on Thanksgiving. I needed barely any help from my mother (she zested the citrus). I would not put in so much sugar because it was too sweet. Maybe 3/4 cup + 1/4 cup. This was my first souffle.

These were easy to make, definitely, but didn't come out tasting all that spectacular. They were nice, but I don't think worth trying again.

My guests were blown away by this -- the recipe was in hot demand! My oven had conked out in mid-bake, so the puddings weren't as aesthetically pleasing as I'd hoped. But I made sure they were cooked through by moving the roasting pan up onto my range and simmering the cups a while longer. I went very light on the ginger, as per earlier reviews, and I think that was the right decision. Then I embedded a few halved blackberries into the top for effect. A monster hit!

This dessert was very good. I greased my custard cup so that I could place it upside down on a plate. It was very pretty that way. However, if you are not a big fan of ginger, I would forget about it. It is very strong and overpowers the lightness of this dessert.

I loved this dessert, so did my whole family, including my three year old nephew. The two textures together, one fluffy, one creamy, combined with the great lemony not too sweet taste, makes this a dessert that I will be serving frequently.

I loved this recipe. It's very tart which is what I'm going for in citrus desserts. I didn't have the crystallized ginger, so I left it out. Although wonderful tasting, these didn't come out nearly as pretty as the picture in the magazine.
