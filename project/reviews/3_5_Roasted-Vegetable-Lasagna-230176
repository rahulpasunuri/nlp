We often grill the veggies, brushing first with a little olive oil and garlic. Yummy flavor. Also, if you ever see Silver Palate marina sauce, it's excellent. Pricey but really smooth and rich, like homemade. (luckily got mine 1/2 price)

I left out the tomatoes (to roast) and substituted the eggplant for the squash. I also added onions, garlic and some red pepper flakes to the veggies while roasting. I added about 3T pesto to the ricotta, but I think it could use more (I love the flavor). And I used 2 jars of Classico Spicy Pepper sauce. I was worried it would be bland and I like spice. I did have a little bit of a problem with the top layer of noodles cooking... but I think thats because the instructions tell you to put all of the remaining sauce on the layer below. You need to put some sauce on top with the cheese in order for it to cook. I baked for 30 min with foil & 10 min no foil to brown. I remedied my noodles by putting the foil back on to steam while the lasagne was resting on top of the oven. It came out great and I didn't have a problem with too much liquid!

This was very good, but not outstanding. The ratio of ricotta to everything else is a bit too high for my taste. If I make this again, I'll increase the amount of shredded cheese (I used asiago instead of mozzerella) and probably would halve the amount of ricotta. I'd also recommend using 4 cans of tomatoes--2 crushed and two diced--and then skipping the fresh tomatoes. Do know, though, that this is a very time consuming recipe. Although I liked it, I don't know that I'd want to hassle with it again, unless I was hosting a big dinner party and needed a vegetarian main dish.

This is an excellent recipe. The only changes I made were to add fresh spinach and diced eggplant. I roasted the veggies (except for the spinach) before assembling the lasagne because so much liquid cooks out of them. I also drained the canned tomatoes and used a garlic pesto. This is an absolutely amazing recipe that I know I will be making again and again.

mmm really good! i liked roasting the veggies ahead of time. totally solid lasagna that i will continue to play with this fall/winter.. my alterations: -just used packaged lasagna noodles without boiling -used crushed tomatoes with basil, more of a marinara than straight up canned tomatoes -added onions, garlic and broccoli to the roasted veggies -added a layer of fresh spinach and some sliced fresh tomatoes at the top -cooked for an extra 10 min with the foil off; my apartment smells incredible.

Very Very Good! The best of the recipes I have had so far...with a few minor tweaks.I used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta mixed well with frozen spinach, egg white spices and bread crumbs. I added onions to the veggies as I love roasted onion. I made my own sauce using crushed tomatoes and spices and onions and garlic. Finally, topped with mozarrella and freshly parmasean. My family loved this, I think this will be my go to for awhile.

Very Yummy!! I used equal portions of cottage cheese and goat cheese instead of ricotta and it worked beautifully! To avoid watery vegies, roast them on two baking trays in the oven (instead of one) rotating half way through. I also decided not to use the 1 lb plum tomatoes and used butternut squash instead. Great note to drain the canned tomatoes! I will absolutely be making this again!

DELISHOUS! i used regular tomato sauce, and a much deeper pan, and this turned out great! Super easy to make (if you are in a hury you dont even need to roast the veggies) adn bake later or even freeze! Made this several times and still ove it!

I've never had to drain lasagna before.

A fair amount of work, but worth it. Used red and yellow peppers, mushrooms, eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, mushrooms, and a bunch of lightly steamed spinach. I thought the ricotta mixture was bland, so I added more pesto, Parmesan, and S&P. Note that this will NOT FIT into a 13x9 inch Pyrex dish! As another reviewer noted, you need a dish at least 3 inches deep, or you will have a mess.

Eating this DELICIOUS lasagna as I write... I omitted the peppers and used eggplants instead and replaced tomato sauce with a spicy marinara pasta sauce. Amazing! Going back for seconds :-)

This recipe is great for a crowd. I usually leave the mushrooms out and use more bell peppers and some roasted onions. Easy to make ahead and put in the oven the next day...

Made this several times, always a crowd-pleaser...even for hardcore carnivores! I add roasted mushrooms. Try roasting more chunked tomatoes on a separate pan and using as the sauce, supplementing w drained canned diced tomatoes if needed w some tomato paste to thicken. You can also use uncooked lasagna noodles. Assemble, cover w non-stick foil and bake for 1 hour, uncover and bake for 30 min, let rest. This helps absorb liquid the veggies give off.

I made 2 of these for a party - one with the canned tomatoes, one with marinara sauce. The canned one was way too watery despite draining the tomatoes and veggies, and the tomatoes were simply too chunky. The one with marinara was perfect. I definitely recommend replacing the canned tomatoes with marinara sauce.

This is a great alternative to your classic meat and cheese lasagna! As I am a lover of pesto I say double it! Make sure your roasted veggies arent watery,also make sure you drain your canned tomatoes. The worst thing that can happen is spillage. I don't have a proper "lasagna pan" so i always put a cookie sheet under it and wrap it in foil just to make sure. I also use regular uncooked noodles. yummy!

This recipe turned out great. Will definitely keep this one on hand for our vegetarian friends. I did omit the green & red peppers; added eggplant instead as she's not fond of peppers. Still turned out delicious.

I made this recipe a day ahead, cooked it according to the directions, cooled it and refrigerated it overnight. I heated slowly the next evening for a dinner party and added more cheese on top. I did not drain the tomatoes as some advised and did substitute eggplant for the yellow squash and left out the green peppers. Everyone enjoyed the recipe. It definately would be a do over.

I forgot to mention that I had my husband make a thick marinara sauce, which I used instead of canned tomotoes...

I took one reviewer's suggestion and substituted eggplant for the yellow squash. Excellent idea. I used portabello mushrooms. And I used fresh egg noodles instead of boxed - a huge difference. I would use a little more cheese next time. This was a huge hit!

Made this last night for a small dinner party and it was a big hit! I swapped out the canned tomato's for a jar of spaghetti sauce and substituted the yellow squash for eggplant. I served it with a nice salad and will definitely be making this again!

This was an extremely tasty dish. A few notes though: definitely drain the canned diced tomatoes, I added an additional tbs. of pesto for a more intense basil flavor, and it makes enough to feed a small army. Enjoy!

Like several of the other reviewers, I used regular lasagna noodles and Classico tomato sauce with onions and garlic. It was delicious and my guests loved it. I did make the mistake of turning the oven down after roasting the vegetables because 475 seemed so hot. Bad idea..it took forever to cook so I was late serving. I'll do it right next time. As a footnote, I took the vegetables ends that I had discarded. and boiled them with chicken stock to make a good soup base..then strained out the veggie ends.

I loved this one. I did add some carrots and eggplant. You also need a three inch pan to make this.

Great recipe. I made this and the Turkey Sausage Spinach Lasagna with Spicy Tomato Sauce for a BDay party and everyone loved them both. It was also easy because I used a marinara sauce from TJ's in the middle and a 3 cheese sauce on top. I also used their shredded Quattro cheese (parmesan, mozzarella, fontina & provolone) which is a great mix. I also added extra pesto for flavor and used eggplant instead of yellow squash. I added chopped tomatoes on top along with the cheese. Yummy. Will make this one again!

We enjoyed it, but I wouldn't really call it lasagna. Also, it was HUGE. Party size. I also had trouble with the top layer of no-bake noodles cooking properly around the edges. Any tips?

I had to make this lasagna on Thursday to serve it on Monday night, so I had to freeze it. Because I had never use oven-ready lasagna, I was a bit worried that something would be wrong. Well, I did not need to worry, the results were amasing. The lasagna was light, moist and the vegetables and pasta were perfectly cooked and had a beautiful presentation. The only change that I did was that I cooked the tomato sauce with garlic, onion, fresh basil and thyme instead of using the canned diced tomato with garlic. I cooked it for 20 guests and after dinner, everybody was talking about how good had been the lasagna.

One more thing, lasagna is kind of like steak. You have to let it sit for at least 20 minutes before serving and you will be surprised at how that liquid will reabsorb into the pasta. In fact, lasagna is better the next day.

I think people need to realize that if a recipe calls for no-cook noodles, then using cooked noodles will make the dish watery. Also, I use a real lasagna pan, rectangular with a raised centre part, a gutter running around the edge. I build the lasagna in the middle and there is about an inch or so between the edge of the pan and the lasagna. I do recommend, as did another reviewer, to take the cover off after a half hour and cook it another 10 minutes. I also turn the broiler on for a couple of minutes to lightly brown the top. Having your lasagna snug up against the edge of the pan just steams it. As for the veggies, use whatever you like and have on hand. Instead of squash, I use a small eggplant and like the texture better. I also add fresh garlic and herbs to plain diced tomatoes. And I have added chopped cook brocolli once and spinach another time to the ricotta mix. I've made this recipe twice and I love it! The ricotta adds a great texture.

My husband and I loved this the first time we made it. I did make a few changes though. I used regular noodles instead of the quick cooking, just cooked them up like regular lasagna and they turned out perfectly. Also, I took the suggestion from previous reviewers and cut out the yellow squash, but I did add some cut up broccoli and carrots. The last 2 cans of tomatoes, I drained to make it less watery. Also, when it was done cooking, I uncovered it and cooked about 10 more minutes uncovered. I didn't think it was too watery at all, and was a very hearty lasagna. The only thing I will do differently next time is maybe add a bit more pesto, but my husband and I are big fans of basil. Thanks for the recipe, we'll definatley make it again!

I've made this for a vegetarian friend and liked it so much I made it twice more. I made two modifications: I dropped the squash and instead of diced tomatoes, I used a thick vegetarian tomato sauce. I've also used the roasted vegetables for other dishes.

This was SO watery. Didn't like the seeds in the squash either. I think that if you changed the veggies to some that are less watery, it would be a good base recipe, for a quick & easy lasagna.

I roasted my veggies for only about 20 minutes. I also doubled the roasted veggies and served up as appetizers, which complimented the meal. Delish! Next time I'll use eggplant in place of the yellow/summer squash - the seeds are too big and the roasted result was a little soggy.

This was fantastic the first time and wonderful as left overs. I added additional types of vegetables to up the flavor and vitamins and it was great.

If you are making this for 2-4 people, you can cut all the ingredients in half. also, add more salt and pepper to the layers. DO NOT put cheese on the top and cover with aluminum foil-my noodles and cheese stuck to the foil, and dried out. The rest was plentiful and delicious.

I loved this. Added roasted carrots, broccoli and artichokes to the rest of the veggies. The pesto (I used homemade) was awesome. Really added a great, fresh flavor. I spread it on the top of the lasagna. Kinda blending it into the top layer of cheese. I made this for a dinner party so I made a meat lasagna as well with a pork sausage/beef/veal sauce. I liked the veggie much better... My guests, whom I gave some leftovers, emailed me at work the next day as they were eating it at their desks to say "yummmmmmmmmmm" Thanks for the recipe.

Very good. A nice change from meat lasagna. I made it a day ahead, put it in the fridge uncooked, and then cooked it at 375 degrees for an hour covered with foil. Cooked an additional 10-15 min uncovered and let it rest for 5 minutes to solidify.

Delicious and easy! The roasted veggies were a nice change from the usual spinach-and broccoli veggie lasagna. I couldn't believe I was going to need all of those veggies, but I actually didn't have enough for the last layer, so I'd suggest dividing them up first. We skipped the pesto and it was still just as good. Served with extra tomato sauce on the side and garlic bread - mmmm!

also I prefer the regular lasagna noodles. boiling them doesn't take that long. I don't like the pre cooked ones, just preference.

Family loved this, but found it a bit watery. Thought it might be the canned tomatoes even though I drained them, so next time I chopped my own bell tomatoes and seasoned them myself first and still pushed them through a strainer and it was far less watery. Freezes well.

Made this for an italian themed night (along with a sausage lasagna and penne with tomato cream sauce) and had tons left over. Even using full fat cheeses couldn't save this dish. The no boil noodles on top never absorbed enough moisture to be soft/pliable. The overall flavor just seemed to be lacking. I should have known that you can't just substitute canned tomatoes for honest to goodness sauce. The roasted vegetables turned out well, but I would much rather have just eaten them on their own.

DELICIOUS!!! I used regular cheeses (not low fat) and only 2 cans of tomoatoes. It was pretty easy to make and absolutely scrumptious.
