This is a great and easy recipe if you have a lot of cherry tomatoes and don't know what to do with them. When preparing you may want to have an ice bath ready for the tomatoes when you are done blanching. Not all of mine split with just the cold water rinse and they were kind of a pain to peel. I used lots of salt and more herbs than the recipe calls for. My grocer only had basil, oregano and marjoram available fresh, so that's what I used. I ended up cooking them a little longer than the recipe called for because I prefer the taste of cooked tomatoes over raw. My husband loved this dish so I will definitely make it again.
