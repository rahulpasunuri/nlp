Excellent as written, except I usually reduce the butter in the glaze to 1 T. which seems to be plenty. Also, for an 8 rib rack, 3 T. each of pistachios and crumbs works out to be just right. Simple and impressive.

New Year's Eve Dinner - well worth the effort. Outstanding

Instructions on preparing and cooking time are very accurate. Flavor: too tart, lacks flavor and richness.

Just as the recipe tagline says, this is a delicious, elegant entree that's easy to make. It would be a lovely main dish for a holiday dinner. I reviewed this recipe on my own blog, Recipes That Worked by Mandy Higgins.

USed this with a leg of lamb. IT was delicious the cinnamon and cumin in the butter brought the flavors together beautifully. I used regular breadcrumbs...

I've had better lamb recipes but this was good. Agree on preparation was very easy, but there are better offerings to prepare lamb.

Followed directions and this was a delicious and easy entree. Served for a birthday dinner with a greek Spinach and it was a hit.

We made this for Christmas dinner and it was exceptional just as written. Very easy too! We used a smaller rack so it cooked up nicely in 20 minutes. We will definitely make this again-- SOON!

I thought this sounded delicious but I was WRONG! It's extremely acidic and tart and lacks richness.
