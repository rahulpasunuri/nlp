I agree with others. Its good but not great. Made them for guests and everyone preferred them with Bing cherry filling.

Very tasty, especially when warm. I recently made them for our neighborhood Breakfast Club and they were a hit. I would agree with two other folks who commented on there being too much filling and extra dough and also the need to cut up the apples very small. Next time I will make more with the extra dough.

I really liked this recipe and my partner LOVED it. The best part was freezing half the batch before baking and enjoying homemade pastries without all the work several weeks later! We served them with pork chops and a spring salad for dinner the first time and with tea for brunch the second. Very nice and a bit decadent.

I thought these were good, not exceptional. I found the combination of the cheddar cheese with the puff pastry to be too rich. Also I thought it lacked a bit of flavor - it needed just a bit more punch.

I made these on Halloween for a weekly get together with my friends. They came together very quickly, which I was impressed with. They were a hit with everyone as well. The only change/addition I might make next time would be to add a touch of cinnamon. Also, the recipe made a lot of filling. It wastes a lot of the dough as well. Next time I will try to roll out the spare dough and get a couple extra turnovers out of the recipe.

To eliminate pastry waste, I cut each pastry sheet into 4 squares and folded the corner over to make a triangle. While assembling the filling I realized I was out of cranberries and used tart dried cherries (cut in half) in their place. These were so easy to make, and the result was delicious! I will certainly make these again very soon.

Seasonal, delicious, easy to make. I usually stay away from any mixes, including pie crusts and pasty, but using the store-bought puff pastry made this so quick and convenient. Love these.

These are wonderful! Beautiful looking and great tasting. It's very important to make the apple chunks small, so that you can pack them closely under the pastry. I'll cut mine smaller next time. Mine were done in 20 minutes, at a little under 400 degrees according to my oven thermometer. I like the idea posted by another reviewer of cutting the pastry into squares and folding into triangles. Less waste. I ended up rerolling the scraps to use up the extra pastry and filling. I used pearl sugar on mine and really love the look.

Not sure about the baking time-- after only 10 minutes, these were as golden brown and delicious-looking as you'd want. Despite appearances, however, they were not entirely cooked-- the bottoms were a bit gummy. Plus, this made waaaayyy more filling than I needed. Perhaps 3x as much. The leftover filling does make a decent fruit salad, though, so no loss. Overall they were very good.

Simple and tasty. Served as a starch to accompany pork loin. A very nice compliment. Easy to make and very light in flavor. The left-overs made an excellent breakfast the next morning.

I was on the road for 25 years, and many mornings up north i had the pleasure of having Hot Apple Pie and coffee for breakfast. This is one of those recipes that take you to a nicer place. Apple lovers every where will agree this is a winner! I dont give 4 stars to most recipes, but this one gets it. Apples and Cranberries together Poker Guys all say MMmmmMMM MMMMMmmMM !!!

Yes, these were simple and tasty, but I felt a little like they were only ok. I will admit I didn't have quite enough cheese (~half) but I found that in the final dessert, there was too much pasty and not enough filling. Or, at least that I couldn't get enough filling into the pastry without it splitting. Also, I had lots of extra maple syrup in the bowl. Should I have used a different shape? Cut the apples smaller? Or is it just a preference thing...

Very easy to make and tasty! I substituted maple syrup for agave syrup and cheese for low fat cheese, just to make it a little healthier.

Love this recipe! When I made it a second time I cut each sheet into thirds to make nine triangle turnovers per sheet and liked the serving size better. Very simple, fresh, healthy Flavorful!
