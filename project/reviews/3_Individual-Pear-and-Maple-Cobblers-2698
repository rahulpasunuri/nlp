This very sophisticated update to pear cobbler is the perfect accompaniment to the pork chops from the original article.

the topping on this recipe totally overpowered the delicious filling. A crumble topping would have tasted better than this biscuit-type topping.

I have discovered two great additions to this recipe. First, you can add reconsituted dried fruit, such as peaches, to the filling mixture. Second, adding chopped nuts to the topping gives it a wonderful crunch. Both additions vary the texture of this dessert nicely.
