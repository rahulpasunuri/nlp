This is incredible. Use a nice '09 sauterne and definitely spend the money on a nice foie. This is decadent, easy and will wow your guests.

I made this exactly as in recipe and it was superb. The gelee perfectly complimented the rich pate. Everyone loved it!

I made this recipe with Icewine... delicious and added a pinch of fleur de sel on top. The grilled buttered bread is a nice change from croutons and it is crisp and light.This is a keeper and I will certainly make it again.

I am a professional chef and I made this recipe for my family for Thanksgiving. It's a show-stopper that is super easy and absolutely delicious. I used a foie gras torchon that I bought, and brioche toasts w/o butter.

I made these for husband's 50th birthday - didn't use foie gras, made my own homemade pate but the sauterne gelee REALLY lifted it from good to great.

This was absolutely amazing. If you like foie gras, aren't overly concerned with the cost, and want to provide your guests with a real treat, then make this appetizer. The only thing I might do is to slice the foie gras just a little thinner, as it is quite rich and I think you'd get the same effect. Other than that, I would follow the directions exactly. And... the small offset spatula is really helpful.

I made this lovely hors d'oeuvres last Thanksgiving and it got nothing but RAVE reviews. Everyone wanted more long after it was gone. I am really looking forward to making and serving it again this Thanksgiving. I think it's become part of our celebration tradition!

Made with chicken liver and pork pate instead of foie gras, it was totally delicious and very impressive. There was a lot of leftover gelee, though, and lifting the squares of gelee onto the toasts was not that easy. But it was pretty and worth it. You could probably serve the gelee chopped up in a little bowl, with crackers and pate, and let guests assemble. But that would not be a very refined presentation.

This was one of the most decadent and greatest appetizers I've made. The real slices of fois gras versus just a spread made a huge difference, and the entire family LOVED this! Definitely will try this one again, but will try to find a cheaper fois gras next time (it costs almost $200 a pound here in L.A.!) Oh, and the Sauternes is a great jelloexcuse me, geléebase.

I thought this Geleé was great. Slices of foie gras was a bit much, though, so I just put a thin spread of foie gras before topping with the gelee. Will definitely make again!
