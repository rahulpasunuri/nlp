This is so delicious, I make it and keep it in the fridge to snack on. I spread it on crispy crackers.

I am not a sardine fan, but liked this. Added more capers, lemon rind and juice. Also cayenne for a bit of spice, and a little cut up celery for texture..

I substitute olive oil for the mayo, up the amount lemon juice and capers (I leave them whole), add diced red onion, a tsp of spicy mustard and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Serve on water crackers. Very tasty.

I didn't have fresh parsley or capers (have no idea how that happened) so I substituted chopped onion. Otherwise, I made it as described and it was still delicious. I served it on a water cracker with a half grape tomato on top. Delicious! You'll never know it's sardines, not that there's anything wrong with them. I can't wait to try it with the capers and fresh parsley!

Love sardines on Ryvita wafers but wished I could spread 'em like peanut butter. Found this recipe and subbed Greek yogurt for mayo. Awesome spread!

I loved this recipe! It was outstanding. Also I took a reviewer's suggestion and served it on mini croissants with lettuce and tomato. I agree the recipe can take a bit more capers (1 tablespoon).

I just ate it on ww toast with sliced tomatoes for breakfast and lunch! Previously had only eaten sardines in the small can with tomato sauce. I bought a 15 oz. in brine for the same price. Will never go back.

Loved it! Added a tsp of diced onions and a few more capers just cause I love them and made a sandwich on a croissant with bib lettuce and vine ripe tomatoes. My husband cleaned up the leftover spread without bread or crackers.

I added some crushed green peppercorns and some dried marjoram. I used a little less mayonnaise because I had oil-packed sardines which I didn't drain. Also added a teaspoon of tartare sauce. Simple and delicious on toast.

I cut the amount of mayo in half (and used low fat) which was plenty in my opinion. This was delicious and a real crowd pleaser. I have some sardines packed in oil with red chile which I will try next time.

Made with water-packed sardines as that's what we had and the spread was good. I've never eaten sardines before, but this was very mild and mostly I tasted mayo, lemon zest and capers. Will try again with a different variety of sardines as this first try was a bit on the bland side.

This is a great sardine recipe! I prefer this made with misomayo instead of regular mayo.

I'm not a sardine lover, but this was really good. A half recipe is just enough for a generous sandwich, and solved my lunch problem this afternoon.

Don't be scared just because it has sardines in it! This spread is smooth and has a great flavor.
