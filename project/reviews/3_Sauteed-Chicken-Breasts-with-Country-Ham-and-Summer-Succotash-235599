Have made this twice now and enjoyed both times. Had to use proscuitto and will attempt to remember in future to cover both sides of breast in order to adhere more securely. Succotash was a little more liquid this time, not sure why, but husband loved.

Make the Succotash with fresh (not canned) veggies and WOW! Very good!

My husband made this dish for dinner last night. Everyone really enjoyed it. We'll definitely make it again.

Super Wonder Husband raved about this dish! The flavor was wonderful in both the chicken and the succotash. I thought it was extremely "country". SWH just loved it.
