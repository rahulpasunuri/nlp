Gave it full marks for its simplicity. Pretty standard clafouti which I generally make with plums, peaches & apples, as well. Easy to do between course, just keep the blended mix in the blended jar, give it another whirl & continue so that it's ready after the main course.

This is a really delicious and simple dessert that I have adapted for my gluten free diet. Since it only requires 1/4 cup flour, just substitute GF baking mix and no one is the wiser. Made with peaches when they were on hand once and it also came out great!

I made this for breakfast. Easy to prepare and wonderful right out of the oven on a cool Fall morning.

Very simple and tasty, but if you've never had clafouti before, you might not be used to the egginess of this dessert. Its definetly omelet-like. But I really enjoyed it, and so did my friends. I drizzled some honey over the top before serving, and that added some nice sweetness. Overall, thumbs up.
