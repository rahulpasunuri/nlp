This has only 3 forks but I added 1 ingredient that I feel gives it 4 forks! First I sometimes substitute the wild rice for half jasmine and half brown rice. The chilis were a bit hot for my husband so I wanted to counteract that and did so by adding dried cranberries mixed with dried forrest berries. Any kind of dried fruit that is sweet and tart would do it! It gave it a nice balance and is now a regular in our kitchen!

Ew. Too many competing flavors.

Easy and yummy. I used 1 c brown rice and 1 c wild and liked the combination - I will do that again next time. Nice fresh taste, this will become a staple for healthy meals.

This is a delicious dish - incredibly healthy and easy to make - albeit I only had basmati and wild rice mixed together. I think it might be even better with some basmati, as I made it. I found it needed extra lemon juice.

I found this under grilled vegetables. I don't see any grilling.
