I just found this soup okay. It wasn't bad, but it was a little bland. There are other things I would rather do with leftover turkey.

Yes, it's as good as the other reviewers say, and I forgot the recommended lemon. And it's beautiful. With excellent bread, a salad with goat cheese and dried fruit, and a good parmesan, not too finely grated, this would make an elegant company lunch. The only change I made was to add an entire 28 oz can of diced tomatoes, undrained. I must say I'm puzzled, though, at the indication that this could serve 8 or 10. Two of us ate half of it for supper. It's hard to imagine that it could be stretched to 10 of even the most abstemious people.

I used stock I had already made, and did not add leeks or celery because I had none on hand. I also added roughly 2 cups of leftover turkey meat. This was a fantastic recipe, and was a hit among family and friends. I will definitely be making this again.

Had a left over roasted turkey from Christmas and made this soup. Followed directions pretty closely and it turned out to be the best turkey soup I've made! Much better than most typical turkey soup recipes. The Tuscan flavors made all the difference.

This recipe is delish!! I made it as recommended but did add a little lemon juice and zest as some other cooks suggested. I also added one can of white beans and about a cup and a half of leftover shredded turkey. We had brined our turkey so the stock was full of flavor. This is by far, the best recipe that I've discovered in a while! It is going in the recipe box and I plan on making it again very soon.

This soup is beautiful...all the colors and the aroma! It turned out very well and I added some cooked pasta at the end since I had some on hand. Next time I may try it with some of the variations mentioned by the other reviewers.

This was really easy and good and I followed the recipe, kind of. I used a crockpot to make the stock and to finish it up. What a tasty way to finish up Thanksgiving.

I used a single baking potato in lieu of the leeks (added after garlic with the onion). Also, I used the no boil lasagna noodles and one frozen package of creamed spinach - the one made with half and half and real butter. It was a HUGE HIT!

In addition to the lemon juice suggested by others, chopped or shredded cabbage does wonders for this soup. Also, white beans make a delicious substitution for the pasta. You don't have to worry about them turning to mush.

I did not have a left over carcas for stock so I bought some. I added a left over potato and the lemon suggested by others. Rosemary is still growing in my garden so I had plenty. I cooked the noodles separetely because I know from experience noodles aren't good when overcooked. Parmesean on top made it awesome. Hubby and I loved it.

I made this exactly as written. no boil lasagna noodle recommendation and will do this for soups more often-quicker and doesn't make the soup starchy.

Opps! The turkey nor the amount to add to the soup is listed in the ingredients. I added 1 1/2 cups cut into small pieces.

I agree with other reviewers about adding lemon juice. It definitely completes this wonderful soup. Only other change I've made after enjoying this soup many times is to keep the pasta separate from the soup, unless you're expecting to have the soup devoured in one sitting. In my view, the pasta becomes a little gluey over a couple of days(though the soup flavor improves and improves). Keeping it separate and adding it to indiviudal bowls at time of serving allows the pasta to retain its texture and not dissolve into the fabulous leftovers.

This is the very best recipe for leftover turkey ever.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was wonderful. I did add a touch of fresh lemon juice as suggested and it did brighten it up a bit. My husband devoured it.

Looking for something to do with leftover Christmas dinner turkey, I was intrigued by this recipe on the Epicurious app. I made the recipe to specifications, leaving it to others to decide whether they wanted to add leftover turkey to the finished soup. Most agreed that it wasn't necessary. I felt that the grated Parmesan really helped to "make" the dish. Family members were quite happy with the results, as was I. This is a definite keeper!

I thought this soup was only average. A lot of time for nothing special.

This is a great recipe, delicious as written but also very adaptable. Filling your house with the aroma of the turkey stock alone is worth the price of admission! But the soup is quite extraordinary as well. I added the zest and juice of one lemon at the end, which I think added some needed brightness and goes great with the turkey meat. Excellent use for Thanksgiving leftovers.

IF I am good at making anything I am really good at soup. My husband said this is the best soup Ive ever made. As you can see that is a huge compliment to this soup. It was truly delicious. Dont go changing everything like others always do. Keep the integrity of the recipe and make it as is and then see if you need to change it. Also for Gods sake Im sick of hearing I didnt have this or that so I put this in instead. Go to the store and buy the ingredients for goodness sake.

I gave this a go and it was fantastic. I only had a turkey breast so i bumped up the stock with a lill "Better than Bouillon" an I added a lill fresh lemon juice . I also added the last bit of Turkey. I would so make this again!

Truly delicious. A great use for that turkey carcass. Even the picky eaters loved this one.

Really great easy soup - that goes one step beyond typical turkey noodle soup for thanksgiving leftovers. 1 change: i threw in the meat that fell off the bone, and also took about twice as long to make the stock.... to give it full flavor. Other than that this recipe is perfect as is. the Lasagna noodles are such a great touch.

Truly outstanding! Made with a just a few modifications. I really dislike dark turkey meat so I was a bit worried I wouldn't like the stock. We made a 20 lb Turkey and 6 lb breast for Thanksgiving and used the breast cavity from both. I added a couple carrots, few stalks of celery, a handful of fresh parsley and peppercorns to the stock. We cooked for about 3 hours and chilled overnight. I was really surprised there was very little fat to skim the next day. Added a few extra carrots and celery as well as a couple of tablespoons sherry to the final product. We also added about 3 cups of breast meat which was good but I don't think it is necessary. It's really a vegatable soup with a very deep flavorful broth. Also, thought the lasagna noodles made the dish. I love big noodles and never thought about breaking-up lasagna sheets. Overall, this far surpassed expectations. By far my favorite Thanksgiving leftover recipe. Will make for years to come!

Didn't have any tomatoes or leeks. Used chopped frozen spinach. Other than that, made the recipe as written. Yummy.

This is a great soup base. We skipped the rosemary which my husband hates and can overpower a soup. We added one cup of Porcini mushrooms. We used orichiette pasta. We used two turkey legs to make the base. We added a cup of the dark meat from the legs and a cup of white turkey meat to the pot. As long as my husband can half watch the football game, he's happy chopping. Nice recipe to do together.

This recipe was fabulous. We just returned from Italy and this soup brought me right back to Tuscany. Made great use of the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and was a wonderful meal that prolonged a weekend of great eating. Light, full of flavor and so easy to make. This is a keeper, my family is already planning ahead for the first snowy night here in Connecticut.

This soup is delicious, the broth alone was worth the time involved. I made as directed, but added a couple of bay leaves during the long simmer and a small parmesan rind after adding the stock to the vegetables. It takes a while but most of it is unattended. Will definitely make again using the turkey wings since we usually do a roast turkey only once a year.
