The hoisin was really overpowering in this dish. I prefer the watermelon/cucumber/watercress salad on the same site.

This was just OK for me. Found myself wanting it to be spicy. Not enough zing for me, flavors could have melded better. Nice and easy though. Might make again and play around with it. Certainly not bad, just not amazing.

i think this salad is refreshing and simple to make. the only thing i would change is salting the cucumbers for extra seasoning while letting refrigerate.

YUP! This really does work! Don't skip any ingredients, they all work together beautifully. I tasted the dressing with the watermelon before adding the herbs and peanuts, and I got a little worried about ruining a perfectly ripe melon, but went forward with the whole recipe., and it was great! Brought it to a party yesterday, and was told I must bring it every year.

Great recipe! A terrific salad for any barbecue. It is something different - and is definately a hit.

The combination really does work. It's a refreshing salad with BBQ meat. Didn't include the peanuts (someone allergic) however it didn't seem to miss them. Will definitely make again.

Thought the hoisin overpowered the watermelon and cucumber. I think the cucumber, jicama and watermelon salad on this site is ten times better.

This salad was very cool and fresh. The dressing is very light/almost undetectable, so the flavor is not as strange as you might think. Everyone seemed to enjoy it.

Brought this to a dinner party. Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. It went well with the roast game hens. This would go well with barbecue or other spicy grilled meat.

Easy to make. I leave out the mint.

I've been making this salad since it first was published in Bon Appetite and I always get asked for the recipe. It's so easy to make ahead and assemble at the last minute.

Surprisingly delicious combination! The watermelon soaked up the various flavors wonderfully, but the cucumber was a bit bland. It seemed to be there only for "crunch" value.

This was an easy and very refreshing salad. I served it this evening along w/ Hoisin Chicken, Jasmine rice, and asian coleslaw all from this site. Great cheers from the family.

Different...and tasty! I was skeptical about putting this combination together, but it was a hit with the family. A definite keeper.

I tried this receipe on a large group that was at the lake for labor day weekend last year. They all fell in love with it and want the receipe. I am not about to give the secret ingredient away. They all ask me to make it every time we have a get together. Cool and refreshing. A must do for any barbeque.

Nota watermelon fan but this recipe was too interesting not to try - it has a really interesting and refreshing taste. We served it with ribs (not made with Hoisin marinade) and it was a great combo. All we need was an Asian Beer to top it off!

YUM! Unusual and tasty. I served it with teriyaki portobello burgers we ate the whole thing between the two of us!

I am a bit behind on saving favorite recipes from the magazine to the web site but I truly enjoyed this salad this summer. I am a big fan of anything asian and like hoisin sauce but wasn't sure if it would work with watermelon, to my delight it was very refreshing. To the cook from Kansas, this recipe was included in a whole article specifically about hoisin sauce. I really enjoy this web site but it doesn't replace the joy or wealth of information I get from reading the magazine every month.

To chef from Kansas - if you click on Hoisin sauce in the recipe, which appears in red with an an underline, you will rec'v info on what Hoisin sauce is. We can buy it in our regular grocery store in SW FL in ethic food area. When we went to make this, we had cilantro, but we didn't have watermelon! My husband who was "cooking" thought cantelope would work in place of - I had my doubts, but it was incredible! We will definitely make this again and use cantelope instead, as I'm not a fan of watermelon!

I never use a recipe that has something in it I don't even know what it is. why can't your editors explain new terms like hoisin to us? perhaps tellus where it is obtainable in Ks.? I haven't even heard of hoisin, let alone know what it's like.

This was definately interesting dish. The combination of watermelon and cucumber was different. I served it with chicken and it was most refreshing on a hot summer day. I got into a watermelon kick this summer and tried a number recipes. I always wanted to come back to this one...it is that good! Your guests will be quite impressed with with one!

an interesting salad...my husband who likes nothing "different" ate 2 bowls...I found it a bit bland and would increase the amount of dressing next time...

Incredibly interesting and wonderful accompaniment to grilled shrimp, fish etc. Raved about it to every one. So easy! On my best & reliable list for sure!

This was such a delicious experience. I doubled up on the dressing and then used half of it to marinate chicken breasts. My husband barbequed the chicken using more hoisin & lime to baste them with. We served the chicken at room temperature with the salad. It was a big hit with everyone.

We made this last night with the Korean steaks with spicy cilantro sauce from Epicurious. Very light and tasty, good with a heavy and spicy main dish. Also made Bobby Flay's grilled plantain with spicy brown sugar glaze, available on the Food Network site, which is a unique and really great side dish. Only problem with that recipe is that it left out the spicy part, so add 1t of adobo sauce (from a can of chipotle peppers with adobo sauce) and it is out of this world. Also, the Korean steak recipe is worth 4 stars!

This is really so different and fresh tasting. I don't know if it's authentic Vietnamese, but it definitely tastes like it is. I just couldn't figure out where it fits in a menu, but I think for an over the top Asian dinner party this could be served as dessert with some oval scoops of sorbet on the side and garnished with mint. I'm serious. I served it as a side dish with an Asian sandwich but it doesn't combine well with other flavors. The cilantro, mint and peanuts make the whole thing so don't skip that part. Can't wait to see what everyone does with this.
