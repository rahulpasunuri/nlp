Unless the lemon can be counted on to "cook" the mixture (as in Key Lime pie), this recipe seems to be missing the cooking of the custard. I have been looking thru ice cream recipes for several hours, and this is the only custard (egg) ice cream recipe I have seen that did not require cooking! Cooking would reduce the mixture significantly, which might help with the freezing. Nine years later, I doubt this is at all helpful to the first reviewer, but there ya go.

WONDERFUL RECIPE---for the 1.5 quarts of warm, lemony, creamy liquid that's sitting in my refrigerator.... I don't know what's wrong w/ this recipe, but it just DID NOT freeze in the ice cream freezer... Machine is fine, because once we gave up on the lemon, we made a fine batch of chocolate. Suggest someone re-check some of these old recipes before you put them on the circuit. I'm glad I planned something else for dessert.
