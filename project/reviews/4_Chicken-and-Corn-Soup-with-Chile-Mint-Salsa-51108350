This soup looks beautiful with the salsa and garnishes on top. (We used a mix of crunched yellow and blue corn tortilla chips for extra snazz.) I was skeptical of the mint, at first, but you must not skip the mint! It's a lovely partner to the jalapeno, and lets the jalapeno lead.

I'm sure this would've been great as provided, but I made a few changes. I didn't have mint for the salsa, so I altered it by roasting the garlic and mashing it with the jalapeno, then added lime juice. To the soup I also added two cans of black beans and coarsely chopped, crisp bacon. All said and done it was a fantastic soup worthy of the effort.

Ok I hate to be debbie downer but I thought this was only ok. It's basically straight up chicken soup and I was hoping for something a little more dazzling. It's very good, and will do the trick, but more appropriate for a family dinner than a special occasion.

I made this to cure a winter cold and embarrassed myself with how much and how fast I devoured it. As others have said the salsa is amazing! If you add avocado like someone else suggested, you're basically eating chicken-corn soup w/chips & gaucamole, YUM! I didn't have mint or tomatoes and used only one jalapeno (since sick), but still good! I'd add more corn next time. Phase-cooking the chicken and shredding was a little tedious but worth it!

Go ahead and give this recipe a blue medal. It's outstanding! The chile-mint salsa is incredible and goes oh so well with the chicken, corn, and red onion flavors. I added a roasted poblano pepper to the broth, used my own chicken stock, and browned the chicken in some grape seed oil before adding the stock just to add some depth of flavor. I also added a few more carrots to increase sweetness and used my all-time favorite Finley Farms corn to this recipe which makes me oh so very happy. It's so sweet and flavorful.

Not a review but a question. When adding the veg/chicken to the broth, is the red onion supposed to cook 13 minutes and the corn 10 minutes total? The way the recipe is written is confusing to me.
