I needed to serve a hearty meal that I could make the day before our annual Groundhog Day celebration. I made this recipe, as written for our main course, (I opted for the gin vs. juniper berries) and it was perfection! For a starter I made the Cheese & Potato Soup (Epicurious - Bon Appetit/Dec 1995). Folks were asking for seconds on everything. I did add a little more potato to the existing soup recipe and served it sprinkled with crumbled bacon. German rye bread from a European shop and hot and cold apple cider rounded out our meal. Ill definitely be making this menu again  easy and delish!

I made this without the kielbasa, juniper berries, caraway seeds and it was delicious. Really ramps up sauerkraut. Kielbasa, grilled, on the side.

Sbsyncro: it is not necessary to rinse Claussen sauerkraut as it has NOT been fermented in a salty brine... only heat treated causing a natural fermentation. It's actually much better if you only drain it.

This was delicious. I made this for New Year's Day as per the recipe, no changes or substitutions. In London we have a large Polish community so really easy to get nice sausage and kraut. This will be a winter staple for us.

Works great in a crock pot or slow cooker just as written. Instead of placing into the oven, use the High" setting to cook the bacon and onions for the first 30 minutes or so, then follow the directions. MAKE SURE YOU RINSE THE SAUERKRAUT! I used Clausen brand - it seems better. Also, I used Riesling wine, and also added one peeled, cored, & quartered green apple studded with 4 cloves to the last two hours. Delicious meal with boiled red potatoes!

This is great. This is not brain surgery, it is a pretty traditional German kraut and sausage preparation but really yummy. The smoky bacon really adds to this total flavor. I added Brussels's sprouts and used brautwurst. This is now a staple for our weekday table.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe! I wouldn't change a thing.

Great polish sausage & saurkraut recipe. Absolutely loved it. However, i didn't have all the ingredients, so i did some substitutes and added my own take. I didn't have bacon, so i didn't use any at all. However, to add additional taste, i boiled the P. sausage in beer for about 10 minutes while everything else cooked. I also didn't have the berries or gin, so on a whim, i added 1.5oz. of Southern Comfort liquor. I also used anise seeds as i didn't have the other kind. On top of that, i added just about 1 tbsp of honey mustard just to add some more sweetness. Over all i'd make this again in a heartbeat. For sides, i cooked some out of the box stuffing and sweet peas. Perfect for a nice fall sunday :)

Not pretty, but very tasty. Per others' suggestion, I used apple cider and gin, rinsed the sauerkraut, and served with mashed potatoes. It was mild and delicious. After one hour, I got the kielbasa out to slice and realized it had spoiled (40 hours after having been purchased). I ran to the store to exchange for fresh, but they were out, so I ended up with bangers. So my sauerkraut baked for 1.5 hrs and my bangers baked with it for an hour.

I thought it was ok, a bit tart. Seemed like it would be better with a smoked pork chop. Going to stick to braised cabbage

Have made this recipe many times but this time used spare ribs in place of sausage. Cut the ribs into 3 rib sections and buried it in the Dutch oven at first baking and baked for 1 1/2 -2 hours. Also added 2 unpeeled Granny Smith apples cored and cut into eighths placed on top of kraut and ribs which melted into the kraut and gave it a nice sweetness. The ribs were exceptionally tender. Rave reviews all around. Husband made me promise that I will make it with ribs again and again.

Awesome. I didn't know if Kielbasa was smoked sausage or not and I got fresh Polish Sausage by mistake. I cut it into pieces and browned it first; took it out of pan and then browned onion, carrot and turkey bacon instead of smoked bacon. Did not rinse the sauerkraut but did squeeze it and drain it well. I used gin instead of juniper berries and pushed the sausage into the sauerkraut and other ingredients and baked the sausage the entire 2 hours. After one hour, I added 1/2 c. ketchup which I thought colored it very well and improved the taste. My husband absolutely loved it. I gave my daughter half of it and she called to say it was now one of her favorite dishes. Awesome, simply awesome. It won't even last until tomorrow.

An outstanding dish that our young children (3,5,8) loved so much they went back for 3rds. I served it over mashed potatoes.

This was wonderful. I was hesitant to make as I was unsure it would come out like my polish family's - but it did! Minor amends per previous reviewers - did not rinse kraut and substituted 1 c apple juice for 1 of the cups of wine. If anyone is hesitant about making this, don't be! Its great!

Better than Grandma's! The best sauerkraut dish I've ever eaten...and I grew UP eating sauerkraut! Rinsing and draining the kraut is important; the flavors of the wine, broth, onion and bacon come together to make a velvety-mild tasting kraut, a perfect accompaniment to the sausage. Definitely a repeater.

This was served to five for dinner and had plenty left although I did add a bit more sauerkraut to the recipe. It was a hit with everyone who were expecting it to taste like canned (sour) sauerkraut.

This is the best sausage and sauerkraut recipe! Followed it to the letter except I used almost a pound (had it on hand frozen) smoked slab bacon cut into 1/2" x 2" pieces. Used the sauerkraut well-draid and squeezed dry - did not rinse. Rave reviews!! Served it with oinon potato pierogi, but will have boiled or mashed potato next time. Do try try it, but don't change much.

A fine version of sauerkraut and sausage. Replacing one cup of wine for one cup of cider, suggested by a previous reviewer, was a good addition. Definitely rinse the sauerkraut or the dish is a bit too sour. I skipped the carrot and used the gin.

Rating: 4
I made this using 'sucuk', a Turkish garlicky beef sausage, as I couldn't get any kielbasa. It was a fine substitute. As a side dish I served horseradish mashed potatoes to give it an extra Eastern European twist and some gherkins. Definitely a keeper that way.

This was fabulous! So easy and so falvorful. I doubled the recipe and also used gin instead of juniper berries. I cooked it the day before I served it and the flavors were outstanding. I made this for a rainy week here and though it would just be a nice "comfort" food, but this is something I will prepare for a dinner party. I am usually a food snob, and I am quite surprised how wonderful this dish is!

My Polish family very much enjoyed this recipe, although, much to my surprise, my dad noticed the carrot in the dish. I didn't think he would. He didn't like it, so I will try this again without the carrot. Also, my parents thought this was heavy on the caraway seed, so I will try cutting that by half for next time. But it was very good and so easy to do. I definitely will try this again.

This was the absolute best recipe for kielbasa and sauerkraut I have ever had! It was so, so easy and was a huge hit in my house. I didn't have bacon so I just left it out. I used the tablespoon of gin as an alternative to the juniper berries. I am throwing out my old recipes for kielbasa & sauerkraut and will make this my standard.

My parents are Polish, and they brought a different variation of this recipe, but with a similar great taste. They never use a Dutch oven to make it; they simply cook it like a stew and cook it on low heat for as long as 4 hours. This makes the flavor much more intense. Hunters in Poland used to take this out when they left on long hunting trips because in little quantities it is very filling, hence the name "Hunter's Stew." Just a little tidbit of info for ya! ;) Bon Appetit!

I loved this dish. I didn't have a Dutch Oven so I cooked it in a large Roster. I like the idea of not rinsing the kraut and adding a cup of apple cider.

I have made this recipe several times with rave reviews. Agree that longer cooking time is good and punched up the flavors just a bit. Recommend using a spice bag for the juniper as some folks bit on it by accident. One fellow said it came out just as in Germany when he lived there. Long cooking in the dutch over in the secret.

I thought this was excellent. Made per recipe with exception of the carrot, as I didn't have one and my husband didnt' get the email I sent requesting he pick one up on the way home. My sausage came from a German meat market and wasn't at all fatty. I can't wait to make it again!

I am Polish and I learned to cook Polish recipes from my mother and grandmother. This is a nice simple recipe. I usually make the long version of Bigos or Hunter's Stew which is much tastier. But to really get some flavor out of this one you have to use authentic dried Polish mushrooms (Do not substitute other dry mushrooms). It is difficult to find these mushrooms in Southern California. If you have not had a sauerkraut dish with authentic dried mushrooms, you have not eaten real Polish food. Also, Polish cooks often use Maggi seasoning to eliminate bland taste. Smacznego!

I took this recipe and added a few of my mother's tricks. First, I browned a variety of sausages before removing them from the pan and continuing with the recipe. That makes the finished product much more appetizing. Second, I don't rinse the kraut, beause that removes all the flavor. Just squeeze well. (BTW, you're going to need more like 3 lbs. to serve six people.) Third, I replaced one of the cups of wine with a cup of apple cider. That gives it a touch of sweetness that it needs. Fourth, and I know this sounds crazy, but I add a half-cup of ketchup. Really rounds out the flavors. Finally, bake this for as long as you can. One hour is really not enough. Two hours is barely enough. Finally, add the sausages back in and cook 30-45 minutes longer. Serve with mashed potatoes and an cool, crisp white wine.

made this recipe without any alterations and found it bland. Will attempt again using different wine and bacon. The ratings in my opinion were overrated.

Great robust dish! Very easy! Suggest making this dish early in the day so the flavors have an opportunity to meld. That's what I did. Tried the dish several times throughout the day, and the flavors really came out in the evening. I believe that this dish serves 6 with accompaniments. I served this with the borscht recipe on this site as well as some whole grain bread & butter.

I substituted Aidells Cajun Brand Andouille for the kielbasa. I think this is the best kraut I've ever eaten.

I made this for my Polish friends who asked me for the recipe. As well as another reviewer, I added the brown sugar into the mixture. I LOVED it!

This is a great recipe. Easy to put together, leave in the oven for an hour, add an ingredient, leave another hour and you've got a great meal. I soak the sauerkraut in water for about 15 minutes to take away some of the "sour" -ness. Very good re-heated.

I'm the kalbasa & Kraut designated driver, and this was good. I've got to play with this one for a while.

Excellent "stick to the ribs" bistro style --- I added 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons of sweetner (brown sugar)at the end because my mixture was slightly bitter. The recipe served 2 "light" eaters (with no soup, appetizer or bread), not 4 as the recipe stated. Within its genre, this recipe rates very high: WCB- (World Class Bistro - minus).

If you like polish sausage and sauerkraut this is a great recipe and smells wonderful while cooking. The wine gives it a very special taste! It takes very little preparation time. One of my favorites!
