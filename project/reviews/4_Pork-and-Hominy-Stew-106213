I won't give a fork rating because I deviated from the recipe so much. I was looking for a quick stew recipe to use up some pork tenderloin. I didn't have hominy, smoked ham or carrots, but otherwise followed the recipe, substituting some frozen corn and black beans. The stew had great flavor -- it was good topped with the bacon, and I can see where carrots would have been yummy. But - then we ran out of bacon, and I had a small second helping with a squeeze of lime juice. The lime juice made the stew come alive! Much tastier than the bacon version. I would give my version 3.5 stars and will definitely make it again, since it made such good use of my freezer/pantry staples. Apologies to those who hate it when people completely mangle around a recipe and then review it - that bugs me, too, sometimes.

I made this, with the following modifications: Pork tenderloin not shoulder butt. No broth, used a whole bottle of corona instead. Serrano not poblano peppers (2 of them). No ham, yes bacon. No carrots; used a 14 oz? can of black eyed peas instead. They are SO good with pork, although maybe not authentic Mexican. Finally, instead of putting it all into a pot to simmer for an hour, I put it into my SLOW COOKER/ CROCK POT on low overnight (about 10 hours maybe). It was *delicious*!! Easily one of the best meals I have ever made. And so easy. However, I feel it may have been TOO MUCH MEAT; the next night I added another can of tomatoes, more hominy, mushrooms, more fresh cilantro, and some cumin to increase the volume for another meal. And we still have leftovers. The broth is so rich you **could easily make this with 1/2 the meat**. At least, it was the way I did it, using tenderloin and 3 very fatty bacon strips. And not even any ham! Highly recommended, great idea for crowds, especially if you serve it with cornbread!

I have made this recipe a couple of times and the only change I made was that I used a little extra liquid and 2tsp of chipotle chile powder, along with a tablespoon of regular chile powder. My husband asks for it every Winter. We live in VT and this is just so delicious on a cold snowy night.

This was amazing! I want to thank all those who took the time to write their notes and variations- I used those as much as the recipe itself to make my own version of the recipe this evening. Here's how I changed it. I made a double recipe and used a few shortcuts because I was short on time. I already had a 2# smoked pork butt on hand and I picked up an additional 2-1/2# at the grocery (had the butcher cut this one into 2" pieces to save me the time at home). Totally skipped the bacon and ham- just used canola oil and the rub when browning the meat. Also skipped the chilis so that there would be a fighting chance of my picky kids liking it. Went really heavy on the carrots, using an entire bag of baby carrots cut into sections. Threw in the entire bottle of beer and used oregano because I forgot the marjoram at the store. Went light on the onions because I was literally weeping and lost my patience while trying to slice them up. I think there was about 3/4 of an onion in the doubled recipe so I added some Spice House dried onion powder with the chili as well. Instead of chopping garlic cloves, I used 3 teaspoons of minced garlic from a jar. I also added a small squirt of this yummy product called Taste #5 Umami paste for good measure. Simmered for 2-1/2 hours because I had just put in the entire cut of smoked pork that I did not have time to cut up (this easily broke up with a fork before serving) Despite all my efforts at speed and shortcuts, this still was not done until 8:30pm. I had given my kids cereal around 6pm, promising them a great reheated stew the next day but we all ended up having a second dinner because the smell brought them all back down to the kitchen. My four picky eaters have declared this the best meal I have ever made. Highly recommended! Can't wait to eat the real meal tomorrow- will serve with cornbread and a little cilantro and creme fraiche on top. Yum.

Made this as written, but used a leaner cut of pork. It was a little spicy for my husband; I thought it was tasty, but there are so many good stew type recipes out there I wouldn't bother with this one again.

Rating: 3
I did not have pork shoulder so I used all smoked ham and reduced cooking time to about 40 min. Should have cut down or eliminated the tsp salt. It was very tasty. Made cornbread with diced chilis and served with Spanish rice.

Rating: 4
Didn't have nearly enough chili powder on hand, so subbed in some paprika and a bit of cumin. Didn't do any extra spicing for the chili powder at the end. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter. It ended up being plenty spicy for us without being overbearing. Yum!

I came upon this recipe yesterday after a 10 year absence from N.America and it made me smile. I used to make this religiously and did so again today. Fantastic. Used boneless pork chops because a bazillion in the freezer, added scallions and celery to the mix, and lots of fresh cilantro at the end. This is a terrific fast stew.

Not particularly good. Harsh aftertaste.

Made as instructed, with shoulder butt. I held back using only 1 large pablano as I was not sure how spicy it would be. there was a good kick (2 might have been too spicy for us). Definitely needs more time to simmer. Great alternative for pork and a very hearty stew. will definitely make again.

Delicious, easy weeknight dinner. Perfect spice level (I used hot chili powder from The Spice House). I didn't have marjoram, so I used mexican oregano (a cousin to marjoram).

I've tried several pork and hominy stews and this one is by far the most interesting. It's easy to do, and smells delicious while it's cooking. My only comment would be about the meat. I used country spareribs and I found the meat dry. I think the pork butt would work better, though, of course, it's fattier and not as good for you. That must be why I like it better.

My sister and I made this recipe the other evening as I had half of a boneless pork shoulder roast and didn't want to do a traditional roast. I cut up the roast in small pieces and coated it with the rub mixture. We pretty much used everything according to the recipe, with the exception of the ham, and absolutely LOVED it!! I've shared it with one of my brothers and my mother also had some and enjoyed it (minus the cilantro). It wasn't as time consuming since there were two of us working on this recipe, but it does take awhile to cook and I think it could have simmered for a bit longer than an hour (the meat could have been tender in my estimation). I will definitely make this recipe again especially if I am having company.

Rating: 4
I have made this several times because it is an excellent family meal and the leftovers are terrific. I add the poblanos a little later than shown in the recipe because they tend to disintegrate when cooked for too long. I usually cook this more than an hour. I also roast the peppers to remove the skins, which is not called for in the recipe (but it should be).

Made this with leftover Pernil and it was a very pleasant surprise. Did not have beer so used 15 oz can diced tomatoes w/juice and 2 cups broth. Husband raved about and made me promise to make again and again.

This is one of my favorite recipes. My husband is half Mexican and loves this as much as he loves Menudo. His mother was so suprised that the meat was pork and not beef, which is called for in posole. She is 100% Mexican and loved it too. I add the whole beer and the whole can of tomatoes so as not to waste. Yummy!!!!!

simple and absolutely delicious...

We made this almost exactly to the recipe. Store was out of Poblanos, so I went with Anaheim. I also used only 2 slices of bacon since they were thicker cut from the butcher. The amount of fat was just enough to brown the pork, but definitely not excessive. I also liked the added smokiness and texture the bacon added as a topping. Next time I might top with sliced radishes as well. Overall, It took a bit of work for my girlfriend and I to put this together, but it was well worth it. Probably one of my favorite stews.

Rating: 4
I goosed this quite a bit,but it turned out to be really great. I added equal parts of regular chili powder, ancho chili powder,and ground cumin. I used canola oil instead of the bacon for the saute. I used 3 poblanos instead of 2, I upped the amount of diced tomatoes, and used Mexican oregano instead of marjoram. I used the following toppings at the end of cooking: shredded romaine lettuce,chopped radishes, avocado, baked corn tortilla strips. I also offered red pepper flakes for those who wanted a little more heat.

On cutting up pork, buy it from a butcher shop, or grocery store with butchers, and ask the butcher to cube it to the size you need. I always ask the guys behind the meat counter to do any cutting that I need and they are always friendly and willing to do so.

Rating: 4
Another rave review...I doubled this for a party & made it the day before. It was a lot of work cutting up the pork, and it honestly didn't smell great the first day. Reheated the second day and it was amazing. Topped with traditional posole toppings--lime, radish, crumbled queso seco, avocado, cilantro. Everyone loved it!

This is a winner. Plain and simple. I have made this numerous times and everyone asks for the recipe. Men adore this dish. If you are having a large gathering just double it and you can't miss. It's a bit of work but you can prepare it anytime and just let it cook. It won't disappoint!

I made this recipe last night, in fact I doubled it and there weren't any leftovers! I had company over for dinner and they just loved it. Everytime I make it I think this is the last time bacause of all the chopping and dicing, but inevitably, I make it again and again. I prefer to use the boneless country style pork ribs and serve it with corn bread. I've tried the white rice and didn't care for it.

This was exceptional with "buttery cornbread" (from this site).

I respectfully disagree with randonoob. The cut of meat called for in the recipe doesn't toughen with extended simmering; quite the opposite. I originally cooked the stew for 2+ hours; it's been reheated four times and each time the meat gets more tender. By now it's absolutely succulent--falling apart, fork tender. I'm eating it for lunch right now with a dollop of sour cream. Heaven! (And it might even cure my hangover.)

One other thing - unless you like bits of chili skin in your stew, I would peel the poblanos, either roasting them and peeling by hand, or just use a vegetable peeler.

Rating: 4
I made a double recipe because I knew I would like this. My one suggestion would be to remove the meat first if you are going to reduce the liquid. Also to reheat, heat the stew to boiling, then remove from the heat and replace the meat, and allow the meat to be warmed by the stew. Extended boiling would toughen the meat.

One of my favorite winter stews - I usually make it more/less according to recipe, though I tend to use add'l spice mixture on the pork, and usually chop some cilantro stems and add them to the simmering stew. This recipe works well in a crock pot too - brown the pork, onions, carrots, garlic and chiles, then throw all of that and everything else in the crockpot for a few hours on high - works great!

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious. The hominy (not corn!) is essential, as is a big handful of cilantro in each bowl. My only caution is beware of oversalting. I also cooked it for longer than called for in the recipe, as others suggested.

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. It took me almost 45 minutes to cut up the pork shoulder because there was so much fat to work around, and the whole time I was thinking, "I'm never going to make this damn recipe again" because it was such a pain. But I changed my mind when I sat down to eat - totally worth it!

Fab recipe!! Truly a keeper.

I wonder if chickpeas or white beans would be a better substitution than corn. Hominy is more like a bean than fresh corn....

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe ... I would probably reduce the salt since I used 5 slabs of bacon and (along with the diced ham) there was enough inherently. I have tons of sage growing in my garden, so I threw in about 6 leaves as well. The bacon and Cilantro garnish is a great finish for this! It is excellent over rice.

Rating: 4
Absolutely the best stew recipe I have ever had. It is spicy so beware if that is a problem for you. I made and we ate it that night slowly simmering it w=for about 2 hours, until the meat fell apart. And it was even better the next day for left-overs!!

Delicious recipe, I'm a novice but this was easy and came out very good. Could not find hominy, used regular corn, and also used 2 cans of diced tomatoes, felt like it needed more sauce, and cooked it for about 2 hours. Pork was super tender, just enough spice (I did add a few red pepper flakes as others have suggested).

Rating: 4
A Great Stew! Delicious, easy, and the hominy-chili-pork combo was a unexpectedly complex and interesting. I added a dash each of port and balsamic - my eternal yin and yang (two primal opposing but complementary forces) and added pearl onions just because I love them.

Definitely one of my favorite recipes! I agree that a longer stewing time makes this dish better and better, and good quality meat really makes this stew shine. Although hominy is better, corn can be used to replace it in a pinch. We also add different vegetables according to what is fresh. Great recipe!

Rating: 3
Oh, oh, oh, this is so good. I just made it for the first time. It's a new favorite. I found some lovely boneless country ribs today. I left out the ham and used dried poblanos that I had on hand. I agree the pork needs to slowly simmer for a couple of hours. I also made cornbread. I forgot all about the the cooked bacon and the cilantro in the fridge, but it was wonderful even without the frills. I'll add them to the leftovers, though. What a wonderful dish to make in this freezing cold weather.

Rating: 4
Just fabulous! Nice depth and complexity of flavors. I used a pale ale but will take one reviewer's advice next time and try a dark beer. I added extra carrots and peas because I wanted more vegetables. Next time I will up the vegetables even more and add an extra can of hominy, since I did not serve over rice.

This is the second time I've made this. I used a can of tomatoes with green chilis in them and cooked it in my pressure cooker. I love this!

Sooooo good with spare ribs. I suggest using a high quality, flavorful chili powder and dark beer. I subbed smoked sausage for the bacon and ham.

This was excellent. I skipped the pork hatrick and cut the bacon and ham. Browned the pork shoulder in olive oil and then (almost) followed the recipe from there. I just let the shoulder stew an extra couple of hours and tore it apart/cut it up thereafter. Returned to pot and finished. Definitely best the next day--easier to get the fat off and the flavors really come together.

This dish is outstanding, and my husband and the many guests who've tasted it just love it (and want the recipe)!

That made it much better!!!

Company-good and so easy to make! My husband and I think this Southwest-tasting, effortless one-pot dish deserves many repeat appearances. The poblano gives a pleasant bite. The combination of meats blends well. So far, this is my favorite pork stew, so I'll probably look no further. I substituted white wine for the beer.

I've been making this recipe since it appeared in Bon Appetit and I still love it! I've extended the cooking time to 2-3 hours at a low simmer which ensures more tender meat and mellows the flavors somewhat.

I have made this dish more times than I can count now. I consider it part of our family repitoire now. I usually omit the bacon as an unecessary step. Cilantro is key, as well as letting is reduce to get a nice stew consistency. I recommend this to all of my friends.

Rating: 3
Not the quickest dish to make but well worth it in the end. I allowed it to simmer for 8 hours and it definitely aged with time, even better the next day. I included cubed potatoes for added heartyness. At first I regretted adding beer as it gave the dish a musty smell and after taste. But this went away after a few hours of simmering. My husband is a Mexican food lover and absolutely raved about this dish. I will definitely make it again!!

This is a matter of personal preference, but I found the taste of the poblano chili to be overpowering and not particularly pleasant. It tasted smoky, which was fine, but it also tasted musty, which to me was not. (I am new to poblano chilis.) As a result, the stew tasted like I was eating it in a musty old basement, which ruined it for me.

We loved this recipe! I second what other reviewers have said but want to add one comment. No one mentioned what a visual delight it is: red tomatoes, yellow hominy, bright green poblanos, and mahogany brown pork. Very colorful!

This is a really great recipe! I just used leftover pork loin and a purchased ham steak. Much to my chagrin I realized I forgot the chiles at the store and -gasp- had no chilli powder. I did have Penskey Southwesten rub, which has all the chili powder ingredients and then some (oregano, garlic, paprika, etc), so i used that plus a little extra than the original recipe called for. It still came out great! Improves with age as well!

This is very good. As for the cook from Mexico, if this site only listed the original and authentis recipes then this site would be extremely small. I have seen your reviews of other Mexican recipes and you always say the same thing. Hey, I know this is probably not the "Authentic" version. I'm OK with that. If the recipe tastes good then that is all that matters. This IS not the recipe preservation site.

Awesome. I would love to slowcook the pork for a more tender meat but the flavors were great. All the flavors blended so well - rave reviews from my guests. They really liked the fact that the meal was done and I could enjoy the free time! I added more carrots and served it with corn bread as recommended. The sauce didn't thicken as much as I liked so I added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. ENJOY!!!

Is this supposed to be pozole? I don't think so. Carrots? Please. The real thing is incredibly delicious and uses only four things (aside from the chile sauce added at table and vegetable garnishes): Pork, real hominy prepared from the dried kernel, water and garlic. The pork should be left whole and shredded at the end. There should be at least 2 whole heads of garlic added when the meat is added. Too much wrong with this recipe to continue.

This is a fantastic stew! I didn't use the smoked ham nor the pobleno chilies (because they were not readily available). I did, however, use their dried equivalent (pasillas) ground up with dried Anaeheim chilies in my own personal chili powder blend. My only criticism with this recipe is that the carrots do not need to cook for 70 minutes -- making this again, I would add them in the last 30 minutes of cooking to avoid mushiness. Overall, the stew was incredible.

This recipe is simply out of this world. I made this for my boyfriend and all I heard was MMMMMMM. This a keeper! I didn't have the chilis listed in the recipe so used 1/4 of a habanero chili. The heat was just right. I am planning on making this again this weekend. Wonderful winter meal!

I tried this recipe months ago, as soon as I got the mag, because I was curious about hominy...but I wasn't expecting much as I am not a big fan of pork stews. What a surprise! I have made it several times since, with only two modifications: I use Goya Malta in place of the beer and leave out the cilantro (It's not worth the added chopping). This is a must-try, but judging from the reviews, be prepared to either love it or hate it!

Excellent and easy! For a mid-week winter supper or a tail gate party, all will enjoy the mix of flavors and textures in this simple yet complexed flavored dish. Do NOT substitute corn for the homony either. Maybe it sounds Southern but it suited my California tates well. Since sharing this with others in my workplace, I've heard some great ideas. First, mix the meat, chili powder, and and pepper in a plastic bag. Second, consider using other meats. Beef, lamb, chicken and even fish have worked well for some with adjustments in the browning time. One friend even grilled the meat before adding it to the stew, while another added additional canned tomatos converting it into a soup.

Great dish, I made it when it came out in the magazine and have made it again since. Everyone I've served it to has asked for the recipe! I think that next time I make this I will definitely add another pepper, possibly a jalepeno or two, to give it some more heat.

Didn't like this one. The ingredient combination just doesn't work for me, and the flavor does not seem to benefit from the beer. The recipe for PORK AND HOMINY STEW WITH RED CHILES (POZOLE ROJO) on this site is MUCH better (and closer to authentic Mexican) than this one.

Rating: 3
This is good. I followed the recipe EXCEPT used both cans of hominy, a 16 oz. can diced tomatoes and the whole 12-oz can beer and skipped the chicken broth. My husband isn't a hominy lover so worried he wouldn't like it--but he thought the dish was different and tasty.

The adults to whom this was served raved...though I would have liked a more chilli pepper rather than chilli powder sort of taste. My sons were a little more reserved about this dish. Maybe next time, I won't make it from them and I throw in those extra poblanos.

I'd give this a four, but I'm not sure that a pork stew with hominy can be beyond compare. Neverthe less, my husband raved about this dish! And it only got better as leftovers. I too was leery of the hominy and so only used one can. Next time I'll use two. Perhaps my chili powder is quite strong (or the poblanos were), but this dish had a nice bite to it. Definitely a keeper.

I tried another version of PORK AND HOMINY STEW, a few months ago. It smelled very good, but no one liked the lowly hominy. I ate it, but unless you like hominy, forget it, it is a strange stuff to people who have never tried it. This recipe looks delightful, but I am not willing to attempt something else my family will hold a grudge against me for. I am still living down the jerk chicken (leave the skin on or pay!), thank you very much. Maybe I am missing something, I used canned hominy, are there better, best etc in hominy?
