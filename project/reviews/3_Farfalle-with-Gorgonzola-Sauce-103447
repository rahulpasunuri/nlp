Delicious, rich and easy! I used heavy cream b/c that's what I had on hand. Had it with homemade fettucine and it was divine, paired with a Barolo.

I think the quality of cheese makes a difference. I've had this dish at our favorite place, Cafe Jordano's, and it's awesome. Mine, not great. Keep a little pasta water on the side. I added sun-dried tomatoes & tons of parsley for taste & color.

Aged Gorgy or Dolce... Personal preference here. I like this with just a smattering of raisins or something along those lines. Adds complexity to the dish and a sweetness it lacks. Chianti Reserva, then arugula,parmesano reggiano, evoo and meyer lemon juice at the fino with some crusty bread to soak up the sauce.

For a milder dish, I used Dolce Gorgonzola, and only about half the amount called for. Am going to use fresh or frozen tiny green peas next time instead of the walnuts. I love this.

Mmmmmm! So good, and sooo easy. As always, much better the next day, and even better the day after that. Ate it with a bottle of Firestone Chardonnay. Awesome!

I have only received compliments for this recipe. My boyfriend and I love a similar dish that includes rosemary so I added about a tablespoon. I also marinated chicken breasts in Italian dressing to toss on the grill. Perfect simple but elegant meal.

Simple variation pasta/cheese theme. Cheese needs to be strong gorgonzola (smelly), and only whole whip cream. If you want to cut calories, skip dessert.

I found this to be rather bland

Just so easy and delicious!

Quite tasty, but a little heavy. I wonder if half-and-half would work with a little corn starch?

If you thought this bland you must have used an inferior quality cheese. This has proven to be a favorite with guests - different but delicious. I serve with sauted veal chops in sage/white wine/butter reduction, and a crisp caesar salad.

Something didn't work with the sauce - it never really thickened, maybe because we used fat free 1/2 & 1/2, although it works as a great substitution in most other recipes. I expected a stronger blue cheese flavor, but it was actually pretty bland. The toasted walnuts made the dish. Might try it again, but I'd have to doctor it up somehow.

Great dish, it was quick and simple. We use pecans instead of walnuts.
