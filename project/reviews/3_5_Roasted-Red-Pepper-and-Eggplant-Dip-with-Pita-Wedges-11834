I've made a variation of this for years that goes almost exactly as written here. I always add fresh ground cumin and cayenne. Like the idea of adding soaked sun dried tomatoes. Will definitely try that.

Fabulous dip and a nice base for anything in MY kitchen....from hummus to sauce to dip to filling a deviled egg (mixed with the yolk). I will definitely add sun dried tomatoes next time to boost the nutritional value and the flavor.

My guests raved about this dip but I changed it a little. I added 1 tsp. paprika, 1 tsp. cumin and 1 tsp.chili powder, 1 tsp. sugar. I pureed the eggplant, red pepper, lemon juice, garlic and added some Italian parsley. Then I simmered the mixture with the minced jalapeno. This dip is also good as a topping on any white fish (halibut).

I give it 3 forks because the flavor was good, but the texture was a little odd. So I added a can of chick peas and it was great. I'd say this is a good add in to hummus too.

This is also a great base for a Morroccan style lamb stew!

I don't understand how everyone rated this recipe so high. I read the reviews and agree with the most recent reviewer. This is a huge disappointment. I will probably end up tossing this in the trash because I am too embarrassed to serve it.

I know I'm in the minority, but my guests and I were not impressed by this recipe. It was OK, but nothing special. This is the first time I've been disappointed with an Epicurious recipe that got such rave reviews. Love the site, and have made many, many of the recipes. This one was one of the few that didn't stand up to its reviews.

This is a "for sure" recipe for entertaining. It is easy to make, and everyone loves it -- even those who don't like eggplant. I have used this recipe time and time again for years. It also goes nicely over grilled chicken breast or baked polenta.

I made the dip w/o adding the hot peppers and the add'l oil. The flavor continues to develop over time. A few days later, I added chicken stock to the leftover dip and it made a delicious, healthy soup.

It definitely tastes better with more time in the fridge. I dont quite like red peppers so I only added 2 peppers with 2 eggplants. And I used a dried chilli (those chinese ones used in Kung Pao chicken dish) cos I dont have any fresh ones. Turned out surprisingly good! Next time, I will make it with more eggplant.

Followed the recipe exactly. Although the pita chips were gobbled up, the dip was barely touched by my company. I had so much left over that I served the leftovers with turkey sausage and fresh parmesan over penne -- that rates three forks.

Delicious flavor. I served it with crisp pita wedges which helped with the baby food texture. Use all the lemon juice. I found that sauteeing it was a very good idea - thickened it, cooked the garlic, and blended the flavors. I served it with "Spanakopita" and "Greek style cucumber yogurt dip with dill" from this site and it was a hit.

Loved the recipe but saw no reason on earth for the final cooking step, unless you can't handle the raw minced garlic and jalapenos. I also cut down the added oil and lemon juice (probably only 1 T each). With these modifications, it's like a baba ganouj.

Super easy and super delicious! Turned out a lot better than I had expected. To the cook whose dip was too watery...yes, you did use too many tomatoes, since the recipe didn't call for any.

This recipe tasted great, but I found it was a bit too watery to use as a dip(maybe I used too many tomatoes). I had more success using it as a pasta sauce and as a sauce over fish-it definitely gave these dishes a great kick!

This was easy to make and made a great appetizer. Initially I did not add enough salt but when my guests suggested that it was too sweet I added a bit more salt and it came out great. I would be careful not to oversalt though. Salt should be added a little bit at a time to the finished product until the sweetness of the peppers fade.

It has the flavors of ratatouille, but in a pureed form. It's so easy, and very versatile. I barely followed the recipe--used all the ingredients but wasn't sure how much eggplant i had to start with. Add as little or as much garlic as you like. I let it sit overnight before eating, and the flavors melded nicely.

Iplayed around with this recipe, and decided to reduce the garlic by 2 cloves, add 8 oz. of crumbled feta cheese, and about 1/4 cup of chopped dates...and it was FABULOUS! The slightly sweet addition of the dates whirrled in the blender really complimented the other ingredients.

THIS HAS BECOME A SUMMER FAMILY FAVORITE. IT IS EASY TO PREPARE & VERY ECONOMICAL COMPARED TO READY MADE DIPS
