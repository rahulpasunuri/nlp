Big hit at Easter this year. Very easy recipe to make except for the raspberry sauce. As important as it is to get rid of the seeds, it takes a lot of time and patience.

This was an AMAZING recipe that really wow'ed my friends at the dinner party... The only problem was that it was pretty complicated & fast-paced to make - my roommate had to run in and lend a hand, and boy was our kitchen a mess! I subsituted the raspberries for blackberries (bad timing at the supermarket, I guess) and it was just as delicious. Make sure you have every single ingredient prepped and ready to go before starting in, and you will make this recipe again and again!

The flavor combinations of this semifreddo weren't really to my liking, but the recipe did make an otherwise delicious ice cream. Next time I may experiment with vanilla bean, chocolate sauce, or strongly brewed cold coffee. Not as sophisticated, but sometimes simplicity wins over.

Have made this often for dinner parties. Is foolproof and always gets rave reviews. I agree with the comments about adding more lemon peel. I sprinkle some on top and on the edge of the plate for a nice accent.

I'm a bit befuddled by all the great reviews. This was esentially an elaborate, somewhat time-consuming fluffy and airy icecream, light in flavour, though it does present nicely with the sauce. If you're in the mood for frozen dessert, why not save all the prep time and just buy a tub of haagan dazs?

This was a beautiful and delicious dessert. Made it for a dinner party of 10, and everyone raved.

I doubled the amount of lemon peel since I love anything with lemon. Instead of raspberry sauce, I splashed the Italian liqueur, limoncello on top. It was FABULOUS!

I have made this many times and always get rave reviews from company. Especially great for a big dinner party as all of it can be made more than a day ahead.

I cheated and purchased raspberry coulis which made this recipe even more of a doodle. I couldn't believe something this simple could be so tasty and impressive.

Easy to make, only needed one pkg of raspberries for sauce . My book club loved it and I would make it again.

Great recipe and fairly easy to make. It is a fairly light consistency, but turned out similar to that of ice cream. I would probably add more lemon to the recipe next time because the almond flavor overwhelmed any lemon flavor in the dish.

This was a hit with everyone...and so easy. I will make this again and again and experiment with other flavors. I sent it to my friend in Austria who loves to entertain.
