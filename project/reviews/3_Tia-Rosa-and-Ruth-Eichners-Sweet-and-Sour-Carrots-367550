I roasted all the veggies together, 400d oven until browned and crispy, about 45 minutes. (I think roasted veggies have enhanced flavor compared to other preparation methods.) The sauce is quite good and easy to make. The flavors combine nicely and the dish tastes better if you combine and chill per the recipe. Then reheat to serve.
