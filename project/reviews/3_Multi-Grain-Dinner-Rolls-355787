I didn't have a problem with these rolls being dry or heavy, but that's because I changed the way the recipe was put together. I used 2 1/2 tsp. of regular dry yeast, proofed it in the water, then added all remaining ingredients except the flour. I added 2 cups of the whole wheat flour, beat it hard for 1 minute in my Kitchen Aid, and then let it sit in the bowl, covered with a towel, for an hour. This allows the whole grains to absorb the liquids BEFORE the remainder of the flour is added, preventing the bread from becoming too dry. Then I continued with the recipe as written, adding only enough additional whole wheat flour to make a workable dough. Other small optional changes I did: increase the oil to 3 T. of olive oil, cut the brown sugar to 2 T. and increase the honey to 3 T.

Excellent flavor, but slightly dry, so serve with butter.

I was pleased with how these rolls turned out. I didn't have any wheat bran on hand, so I used about 1/2 c. raisin bran instead. I'm sure regular bran flakes would have been more true to the recipe, but I didn't feel like standing and picking out all the raisins! After seeing other comments that they were too dense, I increased the brown sugar and yeast to about 2 Tbsp each. I combined the sugar, honey and yeast with the warm buttermilk/water first, to allow the yeast to get active (about 5 min). Then, after adding the oil to the yeast mixture, I mixed the wet ingredients with the dry. Finally, I just skipped the refrigeration completely. I just let it raise covered in a sunny spot on the counter for 1 1/2 hrs, then shaped into rolls, then let raise 1 hr. I skipped the glaze but otherwise baked it as directed, and they turned out beautifully: hearty whole grain rolls, but a nice texture and not too dense. The raisins turned out to be a nice addition as well

Tried first as written...too dense, but good flavor. Made again with 2 1/2 cups flour (instead of 3) and 1 tablespoon of yeast (instead of 2 teaspoons). Much better!

they are dense but I really liked them.... it depends I think if you like something that tastes like whole wheat, etc.

I understand that all flours are different, but the dough was way too dense. We baked it anyway, and the taste was good, so I will make it again, but mix and knead by hand.

I also had very dense rolls. They didn't seem to rise at all and are not what I had expected. They have a nice flavor but I won't be serving them for Thanksgiving.

Not sure if I missed something, but my dough was very stiff (no need to add extra flour, in fact I had to add 2-3 T of Buttermilk) and the rolls have good flavor but are very heavy and chewy.

These are good! Not heavy at all and with a really nice crunchy exterior. Definitely will make again.
