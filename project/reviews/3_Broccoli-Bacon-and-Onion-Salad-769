As many other cooks, I changed alot things, mostly based on the other reviews. This salad was just okay. I kept the broccoli and onions raw, used the mayo version (with honey) suggested by other reviewers, and added golden raisins, garbanzo beans, pecans and only 4 slices of bacon. My kids prefer broccoli raw, but I found that it needed to be chopped to bite size to not overwhelm. The mayo honey dressing was bland and a tad too sweet. The original recipe is a warm salad, so next time I'm looking for that, I'll try it.

Only had yellow onions, but I don't think that would make much difference. We really didn't care for the dressing.We usually love broccoli, but not this way.

Good with a little sugar added to the dressing.

Try adding dried cranberries and pistacio nuts - makes a nice holiday dish.

You can make this even easier with raw broccoli. Just toss the onion, broccoli and dressing two hours (or more) before serving, and chill. Top with bacon and seeds just before serving. Good for hot summer days, and no chance of over- cooking the broccoli.

I was looking for a recipe that incorporated all of these ingredients and stumbled up on this two nights ago. I made a couple of changes - I caramelized most of the chopped onion and added that with the bacon and broccoli. I diced about 2 tbsp of the onion and added it in the dressing as per the recipe and added a shade more red wine vinegar. It was delicious! I definitely recommend this dish.

Searched for "broccoli" + "salad" and then sorted by the "quick" symbol and came up with this. Subbed pine nuts for sunflower seeds, but otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. I loved it, my kids loved it so this will go into regular rotation for us.

This one of my favorite dishes almost year round. I do prefer the 1 c mayo, 2T red wine vinegar, and 2-3 T. honey to the dressing given here. I also add golden raisins and some type of nut or sunflower seeds. All of this really makes it a different recipe I suppose.

I've been trying to replicate the terrific Broccoli Crunch that is sold at our local Whole Foods. With a few changes, this is it. Yes, you must be careful not to overcook the broccoli. I used a very thick bacon that I'm able to get at a local market, and I actually cut off all the fat -- needed to still have that great flavor. I add currents and cashews, perfect flavor combination. Then, I used a dressing that I got from my Mom, who has another version of this salad: Mix 1 cup mayonnaise, 2 Tbsp vinegar, and 1/4 cup sugar. Fabulous! I could have eaten the whole bowl myself.

I didn't make this, but I ate it, and it was wonderful! I'd seen the recipe in advance, and wasn't too excited about it, because it seemed pretty basic, and I'm not really a bacon fan, but it was truly delicious. It had much more depth of flavor than you would expect from the few ingredients, and was a great way to prepare a vegetable for easy, transportable, room temperature serving at a summer picnic meal. Would definitely recommend!

I was so excited to try this---but honestly, I thought it was not good at all. I won't be making this one again.

This dish was good for a nice change of pace. Though, I blanched the broccoli, and added toasted pine nuts to it, and took the vinaigrette out, and added, a cheddar cheese sauce, which was just cheese added to a bechamel. it was really good. the smokiness of the bacon, plus I used a smoked cheddar, combining with the earthiness of the broccoli. really good.

I made this as written except had to eyeball the proportions as I had a smaller amount of broccoli (2 people dining). I was lucky to have on hand some frozen cooked bacon bits I'd saved. No sunflower seeds, so I put out a small dish of toasted pignoli nuts to sprinkle over the finished salad. I have a similar recipe which calls for cheese, mayonnaise and sugar, but this broccoli salad is just as good and of course less caloric. I'll definitely make it again, and with some frequency.

I REALLY enjoyed this recipe! The taste was great and I made it with a bag of brocolli wockly and pre-cooked bacon to make my weeknight dinner even easier. It came out awesome. I used a better italian red wine vinegar and a premium extra virgin olive oil that I am sure made a difference. Defintely great as a "quick" side dish for us and one I will keep forever.

I liked this well enough but the family didn't care for the vinaigrette on broccoli. Sub'd toasted pine nuts for sun. seeds, which was good. But overall would rather have micro-steamed broccoli w/butter (easier, too).

Very tasty and easy to make. A perfect summertime companion to grilled chicken and rice salad.

Very nice, very easy. Made this dish for a party, it was quite a hit. I will make this again. Thanks, yet again, Epicurious, and other reviewers-you haven't let me down!

Pretty good, although I couldn't bring myself to put all 8 slices of bacon in (I figured 5 would add enough taste without entirely closing off my arteries). I did take another reader's advice and added raisins (golden, in my case) and they made a fine (and healthier) addition. Will definitely make this again.

Yuck! There are much better recipes out there. Wouldn't make this one again

This was a nice change of pace for broccoli. I added a few currents (no raisins). Will be making this one often! I should have heeded the advice below about not over cooking the broccoli. 4 minutes is waaaay to much!

Simple, yummy vegetable dish. Even my boyfriend who hates veggies ate all of his serving. As previous reviewer suggested, be careful not to overcook the broccoli.

My husband loved the recipe. A good way to use broccoli in the summer when you don't want anything hot. Remember not to overcook the broccoli.

This is even better if you add raisins. Seems strange but it's really good, the sweet of the raisins counter balances the vinegar.

I was kind of leary of the dressing at first, but the chopped red onion and the red wine vinegar marry well. The finished salad is beautiful and has a wonderful smoky depth and varied textures (but I left out the sunflower seeds because my boyfriend bought the kind with their shells still on!). This replaces broccoli and cheese as my favorite broccoli dish!!!

We LIKED a lot* (didn't love) and will certainly make again. Substituted Hormel real bacon bits since I rarely buy bacon, ...and chopped peanut$ in place of $unflower $eed$ which I also seldom have on hand; both substitutions worked well. GREAT for spontaneous cooking from staple items. Also GREAT covered-dish choice, with high nutrition value instead of empty calories, holds well without refrigeration. (* -With acknowledgement & apology, realizing it can be annoying to have people substitute and then not rate a recipe 3-4 forks.) ...PS -Thanks, Epicurious, for your EXCELLENT website!!!

This side dish was a big hit with my camping crew. I made everything ahead on Thursday - kept it all separate and in a cooler - then brought it to room temperature and mixed it together for Saturday's dinner. Worked like a charm!

This was delicious and because it can be prepared a couple hours ahead of time made the rest of the dinner easier.

I added Rotini pasta to it. What a great meal that way, with crusty bread and a nice White Zinfandel wine.

Very easy to make. The mix of the tart vinegar with olive oil along with the smoky flavor of the bacon was a hit.
