Easy and delicious! I substituted wild arugula for the butter lettuce and added thinly sliced red onion.

I think arugula stands up better to the trout vs. watercress. I would probably use less than 6 oz., however. I found Chinese buttercrunch (farmer's market) which is mild like Bibb lettuce and it worked pretty well. This was a nice no-fuss summertime dinner that my 5 year-old gave 5 stars.

I just made it and I'm already addicted to this salad! I added some dill from my garden and used arugula because that's what I had on hand, and it was scrumptious.

this was incredibly easy and incredibly delicious. i didn't have any shallots so i diced two small yellow onions and used them instead (more than called for but i love onion). i used the zest and juice from half of a lemon and a can of great northern beans. i didn't have watercress, so we just ate it at room temp on boston lettuce with crusty baguette. i think it's one of the fastest and best recipes on epicurious: ready in practically minutes, virtually no clean-up, and a total crowd pleaser. will def. make again when in a time crunch.

I added some olives stuffed with jalapeno on top as a garnish, and used cilantro instead of watercress. It was delicious and satisfying!

Good, not great, needs another strong flavor to balance out the trout. Definitely was easy to make, though.

I made this as a first course for a dinner party of six. I prepared everything except the greens several hours in advance and added the lettuce and watercress at the very last minute. It was a huge success. Absolutely delicious!

My 15 year old daughter and husband have literally begged for me to make this again. Thanks!
