If you're looking for a rustic polenta dish--comfort food--to tuck into, move along folks. There's nothing to see here. However, if you're interested in serving a refined dish that's rather easy to make, this is it. My only gripe is that it didn't look exactly like the picture. Once plated, the consomme and polenta oozed together and the polenta got sort of cracked looking. A little experimenting fixed that. The key is to use ring molds to hold the polenta while you pour the broth, if you're worried about how it looks. Either way, it's a lovely dish.

Made this for Valentine's Day dinner and it was excellent. I totally cheated and used store bought mushroom broth. Couldn't find morels so used creminis instead. Also used regular polenta instead of instant. My polenta was probably thicker than the recipe calls for, but it was perfect as it slowly absorbed the broth in the dish. Also didn't bother with the toothpick pinning of the salmon.

This recipe was excellent, however I omitted a large portion of it to save time. Instead of using morels I used shitake mushrooms that were frozen from whole foods. I also did not use milk in the polenta - but replaced it with vegetable broth. It was excellent, really flavorful, I would make it again.

I had this at Eric's restaurant, Bernardin in NYC, and it was wonderful. Lucky for me I can make it at home! I agree that the polenta was a bit loose, but very easy to fix by whisking in a little more. Don't overdo as the polenta will become too firm for the ethereal texture of the barely cooked salmon.

The polenta for this dish is great! I cheated and used store-bought mushroom stock and reduced it, which worked fine. I decided on steak for my husband's birthday dinner and used that instead of the salmon and added some grilled asparagus. Great meal.

I just have a question....is it safe to eat "barely cooked" salmon, using just what you get under the glass at the grocery store? Is there like, a specific grade of salmon considered "sushi" quality? I am just scared to eat fish not all the way cooked that I didn't order at a restaurant. Any suggestions? (note: haven't actually tried recipe, but I want to)

The only reason I didn't give this recipe a 4 is because I agree with the previous writer about the polenta. It was much too thin. I continued to add instant polenta, whisking, until it became the consistency I desired. (Probably about a cup. Next time I'll also plan on adding more parmesan.) I didn't have morels and used simple creminis, which worked perfectly. I had a 1 1/2 to 2 inch thick salmon fillet. I cut it crosswise at about 1 1/2 inch intervals and did not bother with toothpicks; just placed the salmon in the barely simmering poaching water as recommended. My husband said it was the best salmon he has ever had!

I made this for my husband last night for Valentine's day. For the amount of money I paid on the ingredients, this was a very poorly designed recipe. I have made polenta many times and should have gone with my experience instead of going off the recipe. The polenta was too thin, never did get thick and I followed the recipe exactly. The only good news was I used tenderloin instead of salmon (no wild salmon available currently)and he enjoyed the meat and the mushrooms, but way too much fuss for just a so-so ending..........

We made this for Valentines dinner last night - excellent presentation and great flavor. We used shitake mushrooms, as Morels weren't readily available. Overall, this was a hit and is a dish that we'll use when entertaining guests.

This recipe was delicious. However, we found that a 1 inch salmon fillet to be a bit skimpy for a main course. I think next time we will increase the thickness of the salmon to 1 1/2 inch. We plan to make this dish again this weekend when we have guests over.

I made this last night for Valentines day. It worked out as Eric said. Not to hard to do with stunning presentation and the taste was fantastic! The slightly raw fish in contrast to the polenta and mushroom sauce was sexy, if food ever is. I could not find instant polenta so I made it from a recipe. One thing I did wrong was assume that since it was a Valenintes selection it was for two. It is for 6. so, we have again today.
