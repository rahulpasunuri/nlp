This was a great recipe for our grilled tenderloin. I used the marinade as a sauce by cooking for ten minutes, adding 1 cup water, 1 TBSP cilantro and whisking in one TBSP butter. Delicious!

Wonderful dish...as recommended, marinaded it for 24 hours.The combination of ingredients was great.Wouldn't change a thing. Very attractive dish.Sliced pork with Onions marmalade over top, grilled asparagus and foiled potatoes on one big platter,it was a dinner party hit. Makes the greatest sandwich the second day!!

This is a fantastic recipe for tenderloin and pork chops. I did not have ginger, nor enough lime juice, so I used lemon juice and gave the marinade a good dose of sriracha sauce, and marinated it for 24 hours.

A friend made this once at a dinner party and I was hooked! I usually pair it with asparagus, long grain & wild rice (Uncle Ben's works great!) and rosemary roasted potatoes. I usually cook the tenderloin in the over first in a deep dish covered in foil. I use the drippings to reduce the rice and give it a little added punch. I finish the tenderloin off on the grill. I served this to the executive chef to Ross Perot without knowing he was a chef and he said he loved the pairing of the flavours!

very yummy!! i marinaded the pork for a day & a half. Also doubled the recipe for a 3 1/2 lb. pork roast (and it was just enough to keep it covered)...Also doubled the onion marmalade recipe (there was only 3 of us for dinner and it was all gone). Hubby and 15 yr. old son agree it"s a keeper!

Delicious. I served this while on vacation in the Caribbean with black beans, yellow rice and fried plantains. Made a wonderful island meal. We couldn't find a jalepeno at the local market, but loved the marmalede with just onions. My children devoured the pork and even asked for seconds.

The pork was good but not great. I prefer my own recipe of dry vermouth, oil, minced garlic, and salt - a brine/marinade combo. I didn't make the marmalade.

I have served this pork tenderloin to almost everyone I know and there is not one person who hasn't absolutely loved it. The marinade is easy and quick to make and the porn is melt in your mouth tender every time. I highly recommend this recipe to everyone, from the novice cook to the most experienced chef!

We loved this recipe! I added spring onions for just an extra bit of kick. We sliced the meat and served it as "finger food" (with toothpics of course!). Definitely the hit of the evening! Can't wait to make it just for two, so we can savor it even more.

We cut it down made it for 2 -I added a hot mustard and a good amount of the cayenne to the marinade -that was great flavor. as well as I blended the onions for the marmelade and it looked like an apple sause topping -but the great flavor of the onion and honey was a GREAT MIX -used only 4-6 slices of Jalapenos

We have made this recipe many time and really love it. It was originally featured in Gourmet Entertains as a Friday supper menu. It is great with the other dishes they featured. Cashew Sesame Noodles, Snow Pea and Napa Cabbbage Slaw, and Mascarpone Cheesecake Tart with Nectarines. Fabulous recipes and great together! Not diffcult to make and really wows guests.

Wow! Before making this, I wondered if it would warrant the hype. It does. I marinated the meat for 2 days and can see why other reviewers recommend this. Flavors were subtle and delicious. Less time marinating might not result in such flavorful results. I really recommend this recipe. Hope you'll like it too. Enjoy!

Not sure what all the fuss is about. Onion marmalade definitely helped, but didn't think this was any great shakes. Maybe we didn't marinade long enough.. just 10 hours. Probably won't give it another shot but suggest marinating for at least 24 hours.

I agree that this is a great recipe. I tried to "short cut" by marinading for about 8 hours...and while it was still tasty, will be sure to do 24+ hours next time.

I have been making this pork tenderloin and red onion marmalade for 12 years- from the first time I saw it in Gourmet Magazine. It has been a favorite of all of our friends and family through the years. To really appreciate it, you must serve the pork and marmalade together. Many reviewers did not do so. The marmalade complements the pork like few other condiments and using red onions instead of yellow gives it a good color. This is my very favorite pork tenderloin recipe.

This was easy and it went over well at our bbq. I made it with the roasted potatoes with basil and lime, which also came from this site. Good match.

I have made this several times always to rave reviews. In addition to the jalapeno/onion marmelade I serve it with the cashew sesame noodles and chilled fresh mango slices. This was one recipe I didn't change at all, though sometimes I'm heavy handed with the lime juice and the ginger to amp up the flavor a notch. This is one of my all time favorites!

Rating: 4
This was a huge hit at our backyard Caribbean party - I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of increasing the lime juice, based on the recommendation of others. The pork was tender and infused with amazing flavor, and the onion marmalade was a huge hit. Everyone wanted the recipe. We served it with jasmine rice with toasted slivered almonds & raisins, roasted asparagus, a fresh tropical fruit platter, a green salad with papaya and key lime pie for dessert. I'm adding this recipe to my "favorites" list and am already planning to make it again for our next dinner party!

Rating: 4
Great BBQ dish! Easy, clear directions. I wouldn't change much. The marmelade tastes better the second day, so making it a day ahead is good idea. It isn't spicy at all, just very rich and flavorful. But if you like spicy, I would double or triple the jalapenoes called for.

Rating: 4
The only problem I had wih this recipe was keeping my sons from eating all of it while they were carving it. I've never had a pork tenderloin so good as this one ANYWHERE.The only change i made was using a larger "swift premium" tenderloin, weighing 3 lbs that was pre-seasoned with an onion/ garlic combo. So i omitted the garlic from the marrinade. i also smoked it instead of grilling it, using an electric smoker with a continious-read remote thermometer. i set the thermometer for 160 degrees, loaded the smoker with pecan wood, and took it off in about 3 hours. It was the best i've ever had. next time i'll spice it up a tad, but serving the jalapeno marmelade seperate, allowed for even the little old lades from the mid-west to enjoy it.

This dish is wonderful. Substituted green frying peppers in lieu of the jalapenos as I am not a fan of spicy and it tasted great - sweet. Served with roasted yams done on the grill & enjoyed a glass of white wine on the patio while everything was cooking.

Easy and delicious. What more should I say! Put the pork in the marinade the day before; will do it 2 days before next time, just to see how the taste differs. Increased the jalapenos to 5, since they were small.

I've made this dish a couple of times. This time I only marinated one tenderloin (for the 2 of us) and put it in the freezer until I was ready to make it. I defrosted the pork and let it "marinate" some more until I got home from work. I use a 7-6-5 method for grilling the pork tenderloin (7 minutes one side on a hot grill, 6 minutes on the other and then turn the grill off and let rest 5 minutes or until a thermometer reads 140-150) and it was so tasty. The lime and ginger add a nice little tart/zing to the meat. I forgot the marmalade but it was so good without it, I don't think my husband noticed. (And he doesn't like pork)

Rating: 4
Excellent and easy. Great for entertaining as you can marinate the pork for up to 2 days prior, then its quick on the grill. Marmalade received raves from guests who love spicy tastes.

I made this over the weekend, & it was AWESOME!! I made the marinade exactly as written, but, I didn't make the marmalade; next time I will. I did use, though, a whole pork loin, & I marinated it overnight. Hy hubby raved about it, and he agrees with me that itd probably taste great with chicken & cornish hens. I grinned when he raved about it, cause he absolutely hates any sort of mustard, & he never ever noticed it in this recipe. What he doesn't know, won't hurt him!! We grilled it over a gas grill until 140 degrees, since it continues cooking after it's taken off of the heat. It was medium-rare in the middle, but very tender. When we reheated it in the microwave, it didn't dry out since we heated it only until hot, not torched dry.

This was easy and delicious. I didn't make the marmalade, and only marinated it for about 6 hours. That was easily sufficient. I also reduced the amount of oil. Meat was juicy and tender, definitely will make again.

I thought the pork was good (it's tough to wreck a good pork tenderloin!) but the onion marmalade was even better. I will definitely use it with other meats, too. I followed the advice of others and didn't add as much water. With the jalapenos it was quite spicy so I added a tad more honey to balance it out. I thought it looked attractive made with the red onions.

We've made this dish several times and it's always a hit. Even with my dad who has brought picky eating to a new level. We prepare the marmelade more like a salsa - using the same ingredients, just decreasing the liquids and not cooking.

This recipe is very good, have made it many times and it is always well received. Since it's mostly a prepare ahead (and very easy), it makes a great week night meal but is also perfect for company. I don't make the marmalade anymore, as it is never eaten when I do. This is a favorite at my house.

I've made this a number of times. I've learned not to let it marinade too long and to cook the tenderloins over coals-or certainly on a gas grill. That really seems to make a difference. I adore the onion side mixture too--as do my guests!

This was awfully tart the first time I made it. I added in more lime, but I don't think that's what was wrong. There are no ingredients to "smooth" this out a bit. I added half a teaspoon of brown sugar the next time I made this and the dish was a definite hit. Including the extra lime and brown sugar, I would definitely make it again. I didn't bother to make the marmelade.

My brother-in-law put it best when, brandishing his fork aloft, he informed me that "this is good meat". This recipe is fast, easy, and delicious. I once substituted shallots for the garlic, and that worked well too. I don't usually bother with the marmelade though - the flavor of the pork can stand on its own.

Rating: 4
Everything about this recipe is good especially considering how easy it is. People who complain about the meat being either bland or dry are overcooking it. I don't know why people are so afraid of pork. I have not heard or read about anyone getting sick from pork in the 15 years I've been cooking. Cook it to 130-135 degrees and let it rest 10 minutes covered by foil. Now, I'll just have to wait for a pork tartar recipe. Enjoy

Rating: 4
Fantastic recipe! I made this last night with two tenderloins after marinating the pork for only eight hours. Although the recipe says to marinate for 1 to 2 days, 8 hours was a sufficient amount of time to infuse the pork w/wonderful flavor. The marmalade pairs nicely w/the pork. In addition to Asparagus, I served a potato casserole baked w/melted jack cheese and roasted red peppers. We finished off with a nice lemon-pecan pie which contrasted w/the spicey main course very well.

This was great, and my family loved it..we will defintely make it again. I only had time to marinate it for 7 hours. Based on the comments of others, I increased the Lime Juice to 1/2 C, and I also added 1/2C of White Wine. I was very short on time and used chopped garlic from a jar, and chopped ginger in a jar becasue the store didn't have any fresh. I only used 2 Pork Tenderloins, not 4 like the recipe calls for. I served it with Near East Rice, which went great with the relish too. I also grilled vegtables (zuch, summer squash, bell pepper, etc. ) while I had the grill on and the meat sat before carving. Try it! Awesome..

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe-----and I do agree that it needs a bit more lime. I have also used this marinade with a whole boneless pork loin, which I roasted. That got rave reviews from my guests. A really great accompaniment is a pineapple fried rice (I use Lundberg's Royale, a brown basmati)with jalapeno, red bell pepper, garlic, sesame oil, tamari, ginger, mint, cilantro, basil and lemongrass.

My son had four of his college classmates coming for Easter dinner, so I made this - they were knocked out. I've used the marmalade with other grilled items - it's the best thing about this recipe. I am going to try to make the next batch look better with the suggestions from the others.

Rating: 3
This recipe was really yummy. Everyone here loved it. I made the marmalade the day before and added yellow bell peppers since everyone said it was tasty but looked unappetizing for lack of color. The color must have soaked into the onions overnight, because my marmalade (which actually had more of a relish consistency) was a pretty orange. I also had to bake my pork due to rain, and cooked it at 450 for at least 30 minutes. It was still very tender, and I wasn't worried about getting sick from undercooked meat.

The marinade was okay, needs more lime I think. Do yourself a favour and double the onion marmalade, it's delicious and goes fast!

I used a 2 lbs pork tenderloin for this recipe & cooked it in the middle of the oven on a rack set over a roasting pan for 19 minutes at 450 degrees. It was fantastic - very flavorful, tender & succulent. I pricked the tenderloin all over with a carving fork & seasoned it with salt/pepper before marinating it. I believe this little step helped to infuse the flavor of the marinade throughout the meat. I also added more garlic & ginger to the marinade. The organic limes I used were very fragrant & flavorful. I marinated the pork for two days. I actually called my mother after making this recipe to tell her I can't wait to make it for her (she is an amazing cook & a tough act to follow) when they visit. I did not make the marmelade - the pork was flavorful enough & did not require anything more. Enjoy!

I won't rate this since I didn't make the marmelade, but I agree with the other reviewer (who also didn't make the marmelade) and gave it 2.5 forks. It was just average on its own, it needed something to jazz it up. Next time, I would make the full recipe.

This is a very flavorful dish! I marinated the pork for 24 hours, and poked a few holes in it using a fork, as I think it makes the marinade penetrate better. I also basted it a couple of times while it was grilling. I like things hot, so I doubled the jalapenos in the marmalade. The whold thing was delicious. I served it with roasted beets with horseradish cream (also available on Epicurious) for a very tasty and colorful meal!

My husband loved the pork; I liked it. I loved the onion relish; he was not so impressed with it. The meat was quite juicy with a nice crust on the outside. Be sure not to overcook this -- pull it off the grill at 140 degrees and let it sit 10 minutes to reach perfect temp of 150. I cooked the onion relish longer, adding more liquid as necessary, until it got nice and carmelized.

I made this meal for my husband last night and he loved it! I blended the jalipeno peppers into the maranade instead of putting it into the marmalade. After I took the pork out, I cooked the marinade down a bit and used it as a sauce for the meat. The vidella onion marmalade was perfect with the spicy, savory marinade. We served the meat with a sweet potato/yukon gold potato mash (deliciously perfect with the meat) and a simple parboiled fresh green bean. We enjoyed the meal with a fruity zin. and the whole evening was a hit. My husband said he's ready to eat it again tonight!

I have been making this recipe for years. I believe I first saw it in The Best of Gourmet 1995. I have served it about 15 to 20 times, everyone loves it. It is one of my most requested recipes.

They also liked the onion marmalade a lot. I must say I wasn't crazy about it after I made it, but after it was in the fridge a day (I also didn't reheat it before serving), it seemed to do better. I made it with Vidalia onions, which may be why I got the so-so results. Next time I'll try the red or yellow onions as called for in the recipe.

This is my current all time favorite!!! Make sure that you don't overcook the pork though. Every one that we've made this for absolutely loved it!!!!

Wonderful! My guests and my husband loved this recipe. I prepared the marmelade 3 days ahead,used balsamic vinegar instead of red-wine vinegar, cooked the onions until brown, reheated the marmelade and served it over the sliced pork. I also served charred corn polenta with grilled tomato vinaigrette (food network) and green beans with warm bacon dressing (epicurious). I will be serving this recipe again. It's great.

I love this recipe, and so does everyone I have ever served it to! Last time I made it, I added a minced jalapeno to the marinade instead of the cayenne pepper, and it was a wonderful addition!

With all the rave reviews, I made this dish for a dinner party without even sampling it beforehand...not something I would normally do, that's for sure! The results were fabulous! My guests raved about it. By the way, I tried this receipe with boneless pork spareribs (trimmed of fat), instead of tenderloin...and the pork was still just as tender as everyone mentioned. Even better the next day!

I tried this recipe on my parents, who are mainly meat and potato type eaters, and they raved about it. The grilling time directions was perfect - follow the recipe! The marmelade goes well - in fact I reccomend serving it with the pork.

With all these rave reviews, I couldn't wait to try this recipe and it didn't disappoint! The meat is flavorful and extremely tender. I've used both red and yellow onions for the marmelade and much prefer the yellow. It disappeared both times, however.

This has been fabulous and our guests love it. We use pork loins butterflied instead for large groups (125+) and added lime zest to the marmalade.Yummy Marmalade freezes beautifully!

The marinade was great, although next time I think I'd add a little honey to balance the saltiness. I didn't have the time for the marmalade, but it sure sounds interesting.

I made this with a boneless pork loin roast and cooked it about 40 min. Everybody raved about it. One guest took my copy of the recipe home.

This recipe is great....we have made it several times...the last time I made it I didn't have any soy sauce so we substituted molasses...worked very well. Also we have cooked this outdoors but the last time we made it, it rained so we regrouped and grilled it on the stove...worked just as well.

This recipe is a winner! Every time I serve it I get rave reviews, and it's not at all difficult to prepare. Gourmet's Snow Pea & Napa Cabbage Slaw is a lovely accompaniment to this dish.

This was amazing! The pork was so tender you could almost cut it with a fork. Definitely a winner...and the marinade could be used for other meats as well.

I served this to company the first time I made it, and they gave rave reviews. The marinade is delicious, and the marmalade is a nice touch. I served with new potatoes roasted with red pepper, garlic and rosemary--really delicious! Will definitely become a part of my summer grilling repertoire.

This recipe is an absolute hit! I used about 1 1/2tsp of cayenne in the marinade and let it sit for 24 hrs. The results were fantastic, the flavour was even throughout the pork. The marmalade was a nice touch with lots left over. Since we like things hot, I used 3 jalapenos and 1tsp of dry chilies - excellent! Highly recommend this one which I've already added to my book.

We had a barbeque over the weekend and tried out this wonderful recipe. It is delicious. We served the pork with grilled zuccini, onions and eggplant.
