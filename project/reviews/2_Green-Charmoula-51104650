Where is the flatbread recipe? ga@coh

This turned out rather bland and runny for my tastes. I thought it would be spicier and more like pesto. The second time I made it I doubled the ginger, added Sriracha, garlic and lime juice, and blended it with half an avocado. Much better! If you're looking for something closer to the consistency of pesto, I'd recommend decreasing the amount of oil by half. I would make it again with with these changes. The accompanying flatbread recipe is fantastic.

Good on its own but even better with the grilled flatbread (see accompaning recipe).
