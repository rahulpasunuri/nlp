Great! Would be good on broccoli too, and maybe snow peas or green beans. I added a little salt to the dressing.

The only thing I changed was leaving the toasted sesame seeds and red pepper flakes whole because I don't have a grinder. It was delicious, I love the spice, and I will make it again often!

After making this dish a couple of times, I have a few tweaks: first of all, I cut the broccolini bunch in half crosswise and boiled the thick ends for 3 minutes and the floret ends for 2-3 minutes. Second, I DEFINITELY use the spice grinder on the sesame seeds and red hot pepper flakes; the first time I tried to cut corners by "finely chopping with a knife" and only ended up with sesame seed parts all over the kitchen. I actually mixed up the entire dressing in my spice grinder after grinding the seeds (mine has a bowl that is removable for washing). Good recipe, easy and fast, something a little different to do with broccolini.

Amazing. It was delicious. I used a little more red pepper flakes because we like a little kick. I will make this again for sure.

The spicy sesame vinaigrette is AMAZINGGGG!

While this was tasty, it needed something to brighten it up. Maybe a squirt of lemon or lime?

Super simple and very tasty. My kids ate the broccolini with just soy sauce which left more of the spicy vinaigrette for my husband and me! Yum1

This is an easy great side for weeknight dinner! I substituted sherry vinegar for white vinegar and didn't have sesame oil on hand so I toasted the sesame seeds in a pan, then added oil and garlic, and let it simmer for a minute to let the flavor soak in. Delicious. I will definitely make this again!

This is a very easy vegetable recipe. This is perfect for people who like to cook their own food but have little time to do so. For another vegetable recipe, why not try some asparagus with french orange sauce: http://www.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/asparagus-with-french-orange-sauce
