This recipe, though good, was a tad too tangy for me. The dressing's lemon and dijon mustard combination were a little overwhelming. By increasing your olive oil, you may be able to neutralize the strong taste a bit. Unfortunately, you're also increasing the calories. I would make it again, but will play with the recipe when I do.
