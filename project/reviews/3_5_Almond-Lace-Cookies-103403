Delicious!! Perfectly caramelized, crunchy, nutty... I used my Silpat, which worked beautifully, but you really do need to allow plenty of space between for cooking. I also added a splash of almond extract and sprinkled each one with sea salt - taking it to perfection! I just wanted a few for a garnish, so I made half the recipe and had them done in less than 20 minutes.

Tasty and easy....I needed something to go with some berries and mango - and this had the perfect crunch! Plus, it took literally 10 minutes from start to finish!

3.5 forks. Lovely, easy to make cookies. I enhanced the almond flavor by toasting the almonds first, and then I also added a 1/4tsp of almond extract. To give it more depth, I also added 1/4tsp of vanilla and 1/4tsp of sea salt. Baked 1tsp portions (makes a 3-3.5" cookie) on parchment for 8 minutes and they formed perfectly sized, crispy cookies.

This is an easy recipe. I cooked it on a silicone mat, and substituted macademia nuts for the almond. I added a little vanilla as a previous reviewer suggested, and they turned out excellent. The cookies did not last long enough around here to lose their crispiness.

Very fun. Use quality butter. Buttered wax paper worked just fine for me. (Have a surface ready on which to move the paper with cookies to cool if you will be reusing the baking sheet.) I'm wondering if/thinking that agave or maple syrup could substitute for the corn syrup (which I usually don't have on hand). Vanilla and a pinch of salt helped the flavor a LOT! Almond or coconut extract/flavor would be delightful, too. This recipe looks so simple, but it actually takes a lot of time to bake (and watch like a hawk) 3 or 4 trays of cookies one tray at a time. But they are fun treats that all will love.

I make these into a bowl shape (form over a small pyrex custard cup) and serve with ice cream or sorbet inside.

Everyone loves these cookies. They are very delicate, but I get requests every Christmas for these. They are in my permanent loose leaf cookie cookbook.

These cookies are very pretty and lacy. You need something of a small circumference to wrap them around for them to make a pretty curved shape. I used parchment and they came off the baking sheet perfectly. However, my cooking time was more like 4-5 minutes - any more and they started to burn. Will serve with lemon cream.

I've made these many times and are really nice with ice cream as they are light and crunchy. When I want to have them eaten alone as cookies, I add 1/2 an egg to the above portioning (or 1 egg to double the portion) and they come out easier to handle, but just as yummy.

THESE COOKIES WERE A DISASTER....WAY TOO LARGE AND TOO CRUMBLY. TRY THE ORANGE-ALMOND LACE COOKIES ON THIS WEBSITE INSTEAD. THOSE CAME OUT PERFECT!

I rolled them while still warm (right on the cookie sheet) then dipped one half of each in dark chocolate! Yum. The hit of the Christmas cookie tray.

I've made these numerous times. Everyone loves them. I believe I'll take the advice of the cook from Claremont CA to dip them in chocolate after they harden. For less expensive cooking mats, try Cooking.com. They have some very thin ones that go for something like two for 20.00. They work fine.

Excellent ... and though I hate redundency, everyone below is correct...silpat, exopat, whatever brand of silicone mat you prefer, use it here. Oh ... and you can dip the edges in white and bitter-sweet chocolate to make them really fancy for the holidays.

These are FANTASTIC cookies. I served them with Dulce de Leche ice cream, bing cherry compote warmed and shaved Valrohna chocolate on top. Glorious! They do require some babysitting, but well worth it. I used butter instead of parchment...

Delicious!! I added a small amount of almond extract and a little kosher salt. I used a scant teaspoon of dough which made a 3.5" cookie. They spread alot. Definitely use parchment or silpat .

despite the fact that the recipe does not state it, use parchment paper or hire some guy on creatine to get the cookies off your baking sheet after. other than that they are pretty tasty and you can mold them to suit your needs

Some tips: if you can't find/can't afford parchment paper, there are two alternatives. If you only occasionally come across a recipe that calls for parchment paper, you can substitute Reynolds Non-Stick Foil. You may have to replace after a couple batches, as wrinkling will cause the lace cookies to spread in weird shapes. If you often need parchment paper, invest in a baking mat. Tupperware sells a good one for about $20.

What a waste of ingredients on my first effort! I was sorely dissapointed when each of my cookies stuck to the wax paper I used (parchment paper is WAY too expensive where I live). I also found that this recipe yielded very few cookies (about 16) even though I only used a teaspoon of batter. Save your time and effort and skip this one unless you want to feel like a scavenger, picking off dried bits off your cookie sheets!

One suggestion if making cups or bowls for fruit or sorbet. Bake the cookies on parchment; let cool for a couple of minutes. Then cut the parchment around the cookies; use the parchment to lift the still-warm cookies and place them on an inverted bowl/cup. Peel off the parchment and shape into the shape you want; leave on until cool and hard. This made it so easy and they looked beautiful with fresh berries in them and creme anglais on the plate.

Fabulous. I made them oversized and shaped them over the side of a small glass to form a bowl. I will be serving with a trio of sorbet, fresh berries, raspberry coulee and a shaving of chocolate.

Awesome and very impressive! These are so easy to make and yet so high-end. Parchment paper is a must, otherwise it's too difficult to remove from a cookie sheet. I, too, would give these cookies 10 forks if I could. These cookies would also make for excellent presentation when inserted into a desert before serving. I also like the idea of using them as a "dish" for ice cream.

In case anyone wants a new idea with this cookie...you can buy dowels for these and make icecream cones...or my chef at my job makes them large on a sheet...one per baking sheet, or two...cant remember...and lets chill one sec then picks it up and throws it over a upside down teflon pot...and viola..a dish for icecream!

I would give this recipe TEN forks if I could! I made it for my family (I doubled the recipe, there were a zillion cookies!) and they just flew off the plate. I added 1 oz of amaretto to the batter while the butter/sugar/corn syrup was smoothing, and after cooling the cookies, I placed either melted semi-sweet or white chocolate between them and made a sandwich, which came out AMAZING! I agree with the cook about using parchment paper, it's the only way to go, and make the cookie dollops about 1/2 a teaspoon in size, they REALLY spread out quickly.

Excellent cookies that are worth the trouble of making! Couple of tips: Use parchment paper, DO NOT USE tbsp use tsp droppings, wait a little for batter to cool which makes it easier to work with. Only problem is that they don't stay brittle crunchy for very long... they tend to go soft after about a day. Any idea how to keep these brittle?

The first batch turned into one big cookie due to extreme spread. With each subsequent batch, I made the cookies smaller. I doubled the recipe for the holidays, and it took a very long time to cook all of them - 4 cookies per sheet and one sheet in the oven at a time. A good cookie, but not a great one.

I doubled the recipe, followed the directions to the tee.Using the parchment paper upon the other's great advice.. They were simple and absolutely the best morsels of heaven that took so little effort for such a bang of flavor and showiness!!! I did use half the batch though for a twist on the theme..., gently rolling them, while warm around a wooden trumpet cone.fter cooling, seconds almost, I filled them with whipped marscapone and semi-sweet chocolate bits and candied currants. I nuked and drizzled the remainder of the chocolate over them. Sprinkled them all with tiny silver sugar beads..Both plain and the fancy were a smashing success. The "plain ones" were called the Weight Watcher's and the well, the others for the Real Gourmonds.

I made these during the holidays, and my husband is still begging me to make them again. DO NOT use the portion sizes they recommend. I only placed a teaspoon of batter on the paper leaving lots of room for others; I had a throwaway batch, but the rest were great; light delicate delicious!

I made this recipe and baked the cookies on parchment paper. I had no trouble getting the cookies off - I just left the cookies on the paper until they were cool and peeled them right off.

I halved this recipe to pair a few cookies with the ginger-vanilla bean creme brulee. Yummy! To avoid the gooey mess, I poured them to be rather small, and baked them VERY far apart on a silpat baking sheet, which worked wonderfully. Didn't try to move them till they were well set. In the humidity, they got sticky within a few days, and I simply squished the few leftover ones back together and re-baked them.

The cookies were pretty tasty, but the preparation was horrible. I too had problems with the cookies not coming off the baking sheets. I should have tried parchment! The bits that survived were very good, though.

I made these expecting the worst but they were great! I made them exactly according to the recipe. They did not run together. I left them to cool for a short time. There did seem to be a time when they would not come off the sheet and when they would. The cookies are an important part of the strawberry napoleon dessert. It's a very showy dessert and tastes wonderful!

This recipe didn't work for me, either, for the same reasons. When I tried to remove them from the pan, the cookies either rolled into blobs or stuck to the pan. (The blobs were tasty, but they set up like concrete and had to be reheated to be edible.) Cleanup was impossible without reheating everything. I've found another lace recipe that says *absolutely not* to grease the pans, because the batter is so buttery that greased pans will wreck the flavor and texture of the cookies. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll try kitchen parchment.

This recipe did not work. When I had 4 cookies on the sheet they all ran together. Even though I generously greased the cookie sheet, the cookies stuck to it. What a mess!!! The broken pieces tasted good. If I were to make this recipe again, I would try using parchment paper on the pans.
