I made this salad the first time following the recipe exactly as written and it was GREAT! It was definitely filling as a main course and the presentation was beautiful. The combination of flavors was incredible. However, I did leave out the French bread, just to be healthier. The second time I made it, I left out the fresh marjoram, and I really could not tell the difference. I will definitely make this salad again! In fact, I can't wait to entertain and present this salad - even as a side salad - because it really is beautiful and tasty!

Yum! Yum!! Thank you for making me look good! Shared this with three other couples, and they all raved. I used eggplant, zucchini, peppers (red, yellow and green), and red onion ... was not able to find baby beets. A BIT hit!

I have been making this salad since it was on the cover of Bon Appetit in '96. It is beautiful to look at and even better to taste. I have made grilled salmon as an appetitzer and then the salad as the main dish with bread. I usually have a hardy dessert(creme brulee) Everyone I have made this for just loved it. The beets were the biggest surprise. YUMMY

Wow! Well worth the effort. Beautiful and delicious. In addition this salad is perfect for using up the contents of my mid July CSA box. I used fresh tarragon instead of marjoram. The goat cheese really makes the flavors shine. A+ recipe.

This was wonderful. I was a bit skeptical of the grilled beets - but they were very tasty. Used blue cheese instead of goat because that's what I had on hand. Will definitely make again - soon.

Absolutely fantastic and the presentation is picture perfect! I used heirloom tomatoes and I'm sure that added to the result. The recipe as written on the website has OMITTED 3 JAPANESE EGGPLANTS, cut lengthwise into 4 pieces. I still have the magazine and looked it up when the prep instructions referred to eggplant. Also, in the magazine there are 2 fantastic photos of the salad. This is a cover photo recipe.

Loved it!!! Great to try different veggies and combinations. Feels like a Tuscan salad and so simple to throw together. Add some shrimp or chicken for a main dish.

I've been making this salad since the recipe was published and it never fails to please. It is my "go to" salad recipe whenever I am feeding a crowd because of its versatility, ease of preparation and great flavor.

Great recipe! My friends ate it up with a spoon, no pun intended. One friend said she never ate a beet that she liked, but she actually enjoyed this preparation. I used baby spinach instead of baby greens, and also used feta cheese as fresh goat cheese is difficult to find here, but still with good results. One item of note: eggplant was left out of the ingredients list, but is mentioned in the directions. Go figure!

I usually parboil the beets for this salad for 5 minutes, and also add grilled green beans. This salad is incredibly satisfying for a veggie main course- colorful and elegant too.

A friend made this for us and it was AMAZING!!! The presentation is beautiful (yet EASY) and she was able to grill the veggies hours in advance so she was not distracted while we were visiting. I shall make this a staple in our diet. The taste combination was fabulous.

Wonderful salad. I took this to a BBQ with friends and it was a hit. I don't have a BBQ myself so I pre-broiled mixed veggies (eggplant, zucchini, mushrooms and red onion) and didn't include the beets. The broiling definately worked well and I can't say if it lost anything without the beets but was delicious.

This salad was FABULOUS! I grilled asparagus instead of squash --and no beets. Outstanding in appearance and taste.

Splendid! I used fewer beets, added yellow squash and a bit of thyme instead of marjoram. Looks lovely and tastes delicious.

Oh wow! This was great--made an unreal presentation and was great tasting. I served as an accompaniment to a roast done on the BBQ. I grilled red, yellow and orange peppers and mushrooms. Served on musclun tomatoes down the middle big veggie chunks on the outside, tucked a few artichoke amongst the vegetables, scattered on the olives and added the cheese. (Fennel would also have been great -- I just forgot to buy it) Guests raved about it!

This is the best grilled vegetable recipe I've ever used. I make it often and everyone raves. Other vegetables such as mushrooms, eggplant, corn, etc. can also be used.

I made this salad for our town's 4th of July celebration. Everyone really liked it. Received many compliments and requests for the recipe. I varied the marinade by adding garlic and I used fresh thyme instead of the marjoram. Makes a beautiful presentation, but beware--this recipe is time consuming. Would definitely make this again.

My company and I thought this was an outstanding recipe. I will say that it is labor-intensive but worth the trouble if you have the time. It makes a beautiful presentation.
