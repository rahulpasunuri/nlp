A friend just recently made this for me. It was amazing and I am looking forward to making it myself.

I thought the olive paste was too strong--although other guests enjoyed it. Next time I will use less olive paste.

I hadn't any peppers so used grilled aubergine slices instead with feta. Delicious combination of tastes and easy peasy to make.
