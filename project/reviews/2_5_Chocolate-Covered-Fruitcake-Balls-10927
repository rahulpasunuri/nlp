I burnt my fruitcake (about 10 lbs of it) so I used the middle unburnt part in this recipe. It had a different taste but I gave some to my cousin for Christmas and she said I should sell them. My husband said they weren't that good and then polished off about 20. You have to use good fruit cake though. That stuff with all the citron and fake colored fruit that you get at US supermarkets is disgusting and anything from it will be disgusting. Use proper fruitcake (dried apricots, glace cherries, golden raisins, almonds, pecans, walnuts, good brandy) and good chocolate it will be good. It reminded me of this chocolate bar with dried fruit in it that I once had from Croatia, so if you are craving something like that it might fill the bill. (But it will be expensive to make!)
