Substituted veal stock for the chicken and Malbec for the white wine. Also threw in a few sprigs of fresh thyme and removed the stalks at the end. Then made some orzo and put the shank and sauce over a serving of orzo. My wife's comment was "this is restaurant-quality."

This was very good, although I prefer the Braised Lamb Shanks with Caramelized Onions and Shallots, also on this website.

Very good. I use whole (small) lamb shanks, which I think are much tastier. Sometimes I add grated carrot and celery and saute with the onions and garlic. This dish is one of our "staples."

easy and very good. I made it according to the directions. Probably the easiest of the osso buco recipes I have tried.

For the expense of the shanks coupled with all of the effort it was not worth it.

This was the best Osso Buco I have ever made and it truly was, as the recipe states, easy. I used mostly beef broth and mostly red wine as opposed to all chicken broth and all white wine. I believe that those adjustments made the sauce richer. I served it over creamy polenta. The veal fell right off the bone!

I changed the chicken stock to half chicken stock & half beef stock & the white wine to a good quality red. If the mood strikes, I also will add portobello mushrooms at the last 30-40 minutes. This is excellent paired with Risotto Milanese.

I also used beef shanks instead of veal as the cook below did. I have got to say this was really one of the tastiest dishes in a long time. I will make this again and make sure I have alot of crusty bread for the delicious sauce.

I just made this with a beef shank. I followed the recipe up to adding the meat back to the onion/garlic mixture, but instead added all the other ingredients and left the meat in the bowl.I substituted thyme for basil and simmered the mixture for about 10 min.I placed the meat in a roasting pan, seasoned it and poured the sauce on top. I covered it tightly with foil and roasted it at 275 for 21/2 hours. It fell off the bone! I will refrigerate it overnight and skim the fat off before reheating and serving on a bed of herbed mashed potatoes, YUM!

PDF-S.FLA I am making this tonight from a recipe that I got from "CCOKING LIGHT" magazine. The only big differences, is that my recipe calls for more spices- 2tsp dried thyme,1/2 tsp blk pepper,3TBL balsamic vinegar(add at beginning after you cook the onions w/ wineand 1/2 the pepper-till caramelized),also 1/2 tsp crushed red pepper. At end add a can of cannellini beans. P.S. at the start when you cook the onions ( 4 CUPS) w/ the wine,1tbs. sugar,thyme & pepper(then reduce w/ balsamic) SAVE 1/2 the onion mix to serve OVER dish w/fresh chopped Basil & LEMON ZEST.When adding beans, you can also add 1/2 cup tubetti(small, tube shaped pasta).

I made this because it was my boyfriend's favorite but unfortunately, it turned out to be very greasy. It really does depend on the choice of meat, 5 stores were out of veal so I substituted a beef shank instead and I think that made the meal very, very greasy. I would only make it again if I could find a veal shank and I learned to always order in advance from the butcher to ensure that you get one. I definitely would not substitute a beef shank for a veal one.

I had never tasted osso buco before, but it sounded so good I decided to pay big bucks for the meat at a gourmet store. It was clearly labeled osso buco in the case. The sauce was delicious and the tender part of the meat was good. However, although I sauteed the meat very well and cooked it for two hours, it never fell off the bone, and there was a disappointing amount of fatty meat that had to be discarded. I didn't get much for all the big bucks and time I expended. Major disappointment.

Great!!! However, I now substitute Knorr's Tomato Beef/Oxtail soup with 2 cups water--for the chicken broth; one 14 oz can Diced Tomatoes w/basil, garlic & oregano--for the 28 oz Crushed Tomatoes; 12 fresh basil leaves; and 1 tspn grated orange peel--for the lemon. (PS: I have almost every edition of BA since 1976!)

Excellent recipe. I enjoyed it very much as did many of my guests.

Yes, quite yummy, but I also spiced it up by adding some hot pepper and herbs. Much depends on the quality of the shanks - mine were so-so. Next time, I'll go to a butcher.

Found this a little on the bland side. Needed extra garlic powder, aromat and white pepper to jazz it up. Didn't have rosemary so I used taragon which always adds a nice flavor.

I purchased a pressure cooker and deceided to try this recipe. The veal was fork tender but fatty. The sauce was too heavy with tomatoes. I probably should have used whole tomatoes instead of the crushed and cut down on the amount of chicken broth and wine. I would appreciate recipes for the pressure cooker. My children are busy with after school activities, so I need some ideas for quick and hearty winter meals.

Veal shanks weren't available so I followed the recipe using lamb shanks instead - fall-off-the-bone delicious! I'll definitely be making this recipe again.

Great taste and a one pot recipe. Served with sauteed Gnocchi, and used beef shank instead. Make ahead of time...its even better the next day!!

Very easy to prepare. I did not have a deep saute pan, so I used a WOK. It worked well and was very easy to clean up.

osso buco of veal is very good in general. this recipe i let cook for hours because it is more tender then. i used a brand of veal called STRAUSS veal, i always do because i know that most chefs and nicer grocery stores carry it- it truely is the most lean, best tasting veal.
