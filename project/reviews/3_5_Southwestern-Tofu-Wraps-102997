Eh...it is exactly what it is...maybe with some more flavor. Not bad, but no hurry to make it again.

This was really quite good and I am not a tofu fan. I tasted the mix after the 20 minute marinade and added some salt, but that is the only change I made.

great basic dish. I added jalapeno peppers, green bell pepper, cumin, and extra garlic. After marinating, I stir fried!

Delicious & healthy! I made this for friends, and they really enjoyed it. This makes about 3 burritos with the big burrito tortillas (about 10-inch-diameter). Definitely add some cumin, salt, and pepper to taste--sour cream on the side is tasty too. YUM!

Incredibly easy and delicious. I'm just getting in to eating more tofu, and this is a keeper.

I made this for my daughter, who is a vegetarian..I added a few extra spices to the tofu marinade and it turned out great. She came back for seconds and asked that I make it again!!

to add more flavour to this dish try green salsa over the red and i added crushed pequin peppers for a little kick

I thought this was just a so-so recipe. I was more impressed by the other reviewers comments than the actual dish. Although it was easy to prepare, it lacked the "wow"-ness I expected. It definitely won't be a "keeper".

I doubled the garlic, added a bit of cumin, cayenne pepper, and oaxaca cheese. Yummy!

I must say these are delicious!!! I am not a big meat eater, but have always struggled a bit with tofu. There is no struggle with this meal, simply wonderful. I heated up the mixture, served in warm pita bread, topped with salsa and cilantro-lime sour cream. Fabulous ;)

quite good; nice & fresh, and fast for a summer weeknight. I'll try again with some of the additions others have recommended.

this recipe is good on its own, but try making it with black beans, diced tomatoes, a dash of grated cheddar and maybe (!) some cumin- and lime-scented sour cream inside. You'll never eat a chicken burrito again.

I doubled this recipe for a party and everyone--even people reluctant to eat tofu--loved it!

This is the best tofu thingy I have ever made! I highly recommend it. Lime juice is such a nice compliment to the tofu, who knew?

YumYum... I was also hestitant about cold tofu but the mixture of flavors made this an excellant dish. The next day I did heat the mixture up with some grated cheese and served in a whole wheat pita (with the lime-lettuce)and the family (4 teenagers & a meat-loving husband) thought it was a hit. I have already made it twice in two weeks.

This is an excellent dish and very easy to make, I would not change a thing. I was a little sceptical about making this at first because it was cold tofu. I have eaten alot of tofu but it has all been cooked. It is a really delicious dish.

I have not yet rated a recipe, but this was totally great. Really easy, fresh, light, and healthy. Leftovers lasted until the next day. We ate ours with some sour cream. Definately try it, even if you are not a big tofu fan.

I was quite surprised w/the turnout of this. I sometimes don't like tofu recipes but this one was quite nice. The lime certainly makes all the difference.

excellent! made this for a dinner party and even the people afraid of tofu ate it! people were found standing around the leftover bowl of tofu desperately trying to get the last morsel. garlic and red onion add a great spicy flavor!

My tofu-phobic husband ate every bite (big step!) but in the end said that he thought that it was just so-so. I thought that it was very fresh tasing, flavorful and great for a light summer dinner.

This was very good. I sliced the tofu in two, lengthwise, wrapped in several paper towels, and pressed with a heavy cookbook to squeeze out excess liquid for about 30 minutes (changing paper towels when soaked through). This makes the tofu firmer, less crumbly and a little more "meatlike", then I tossed with ground cumin & coriander and sauteed briefly to warm it up. Yum!

I am trying to bring tofu into my diet and I like tortillas with just about everything in them and decided to try this. I really didn't know how this would taste and my first thought after taking a bite was "WOW". This is really fresh tasting. My husband gave it a 2 thumbs up after his first bite. This is a very fast, light and nutritious meal. Give it a try !

I rarely make the same recipe twice, I like to experiment, but this recipe has easily become a staple of our diets. It's healthy and easy to prepare. And since we live in a southern climate, the cold dinner is perfect in the evenings.

I didn't have lime juice so I used lemon juice and it was fine. Also, I heated the tortillas in the microwave and that was fine too. Added lots of leftover veggies (eggplant, peppers, vidalia onion) and a little drop of spicy sauce and they were awesome. Will certainly make these again, soon!

Quick, easy, and healthy meal that doesn't taste like one. Perfect for using up leftover veggies. We substitiuted dry herbs for the fresh cilantro and used diced zucchini and red peppers instead of the lettuce. No one will guess its tofu!

Tasty; it's true that you don't know it's tofu. My husband even ate it. Use Vidalia or sweet onions when in season. It certainly could be dressed up w/ add'l veggies like chopped tomatoes, red peppers, etc. Adding some shredded cheddar is also to my liking...Try it!

Love this recipe although I added tri-color sweet peppers and some herbs from my garden(marjoram,purple basil & a little thyme)My healthy food phobic husband wanted to know what kind of cheese was in the sandwich:) Love it!!!

I prefer the contents of my wrap to be warm - however the filling was flavorful and I would use it on top of a salad perhaps. I would make it again more for lunch than dinner.

Loved this recipe. Simple and delicious. Can't tell the filling is tofu - very flavorful. I'll make it again many times in the future.
