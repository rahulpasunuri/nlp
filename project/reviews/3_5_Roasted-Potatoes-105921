Really NOT worth the extra trouble. For Christmas dinner, I made these potatoes with duck fat, otherwise followed all the instructions, and got a disappointing result: boring, not particularly flavorful potatoes. Next night, to serve with leftover Christmas Roast, I peeled Russet potatoes, cut into 1 1/2 -2 inch cubes, threw in a roasting pan with extra virgin olive oil, thinly sliced red onion (leftover from salad makings), and a few whole peeled garlic cloves; sprinkled everything with rosemary (dry, cracked) and pepper, roasted in hot oven (425) for one hour: exceptional, and much better than the duck fat roasted red potatoes served on Christmas. NO leftovers from my old standby; Simple is sometimes best. Don't bother with the duck fat (no one in LA sells goose fat).

These potatoes are wonderful. Don't be afraid! Duck fat is closer in composition to olive oil than it is to butter, and so tasty! http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html? res=9D0CE7D81F3AF934A25752C1A967958260&page wanted=all

The thing about oil vs duck or goose fat IMHO is that you taste the potatoes more with oil. So if you have good potatoes, why cover their flavor? I leave peels on and like to use several colors for beautiful presentation.

These are so good and so easy. I also tossed green beans in some duck fat and roasted those as well (only 15-20 minutes). Great easy sides for a duck dinner.

I was lucky enough to find some goose fat at the local German grocer. This recipe is PERFECT. Makes the absolute best roast potatoes. Sometimes I replace some of the goose fat with olive oil and they are just about as good!

These potatoes were yummy. I made them with UNpeeled red potatoes. I didn't have goose fat just hanging around the kitchen. I used butter flavored Crisco. I added a bunch of different herbs to spice things up a bit and was very pleased with the results. I served these with the Chicken Marsalla recipe also on this site. That was REALLY good. You should check it out.

Fortunately I saved the rendered duck fat from making the Muscovy Duck Breasts with Pomegranate-Wine Sauce Bon Appetit December 04. These potatoes were heavenly. I used white fingerling potatoes (and no I didn't peel them). The next day my daughter was so sad to learn we had consumed each and every potato!!! Not a dish for year round, but when you want to splurge, this is the one.

Will I be stoned for leaving the peel on my little red potatoes? No duck fat handy so I used the bacon grease. Mighty fine potatoes! Will do these again.

Why get hung up on the type of lard or fat to use??? I used bacon fat and they came out PERFECT. The point is to use LARD or FAT, not oil. Lard and fat have much more flavor. Great easy recipe

I think the previous reviewers who replaced duck fat with olive oil have missed the point. Duck or goose fat is even richer in flavor (redolent of lavender and honey) than it is in cholesterol, and adds the most heavenly aroma and taste to anything cooked with it. I consider it the truffle of cooking oils and fats (it's what makes foie gras is such a delicacy!). It's not a luxury you can afford to indulge in every day (healthwise), but it is worth suspending your dietary restrictions momentarily to experience this most extraordinary gustatory delight. A little bit in moderation is a good thing. If you don't want to roast an entire goose, you can also use the fat rendered from sauteed duck breast for this recipe.

Simply a great side dish. I used olive oil instead of the goose fat, since I was cooking these with lamb.

after par- boiling pots. with lid on, shake pan so pots. are nice and fluffy, tnen put in to hot fat or oil, they come out slightly crispy on outside and soft inside.

This is a good recipe, but some tips - it is better to scratch the surface of the potato with a fork once in the pan, as this will help the crisping. It is also important to salt with good quality salt as well, such as Maldon. Personally I prefer olive oil,cracked black pepper and rosemary to be used, rather than the heavier goose oor duck fat (better for you as well).

You can use olive oil in place of the goose fat. Simply toss the peeled, boiled potatoes in a bowl with enough olive oil to coat them. They come out nicely browned, slightly crunchy on the outside and nicely cooked on the inside. They resemble big round french fries in taste and texture.

I made this recipe several times using tinned goose fat from France which I cart home from England each year...will have to start buying more fat because this is a keeper. Also added rosemary on one occasion (good). Find goose fat at Sainsburys Super Markets.

I made this dish on the same day I was making duck, and used the duck fat in the potatos. I've done lots of roasted potatos before -- but the duck fat really made these better than usual!
