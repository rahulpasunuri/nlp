Not even salt would have helped this... bland, bland, bland. Waste of good venison.

We have so much venison in our freezer I'm all about looking for recipes that use it correctly. This recipe is great, although I think the serving size is off - I make this with basically the same proportions and it serves 4-5. I serve it with some crusty bread as the main course, so maybe that's the difference (although I can't imagine venison stew being a starter...) My version (very similar) here: http://www.thingsimadetoday.com/2013/01/24/winter-stew/

Neither me nor my husband need to watch our sodium intake, so I made this regular, without cutting salt. (Which may be missing the point, but this is the only venison stew recipe on Epi!) It was good, rustic, stick-to-the-ribs fare. The seasoning was good, but I added some fresh chopped sage and Worcestershire sauce at the end and that made it better. We didn't need the cornstarch as the potatoes thickened it nicely. Husband suggested whole peppercorns added with the aromatics, which I think would really add something. Good dish!
