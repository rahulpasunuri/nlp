The salad was good but I had to spice up the dressing a little. I used fresh instead of dried marjoram and added 1 clove of minced garlic while doubling the vinegar and oil. I also used spinach, it's what I had on hand, and I think it went better with the strong flavors of the orange and onion.

I would keep the dressing on the side, as my children felt it was too tangy. Also, so the left overs could be used the next day. I choose to use canned Manderin oranges, not the fresh. And as my family are not fans of pine nuts, we used toasted sliced almonds. Even my 10 year old daughter liked it.

I have made this salad several times. Really really good and refreshing.
