I wasn't too excited by this. I used a store-bought crust, but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. It was just rather blah. I think I would have found it more interesting if apple slices were mixed in with the cheese or something like that. It does present beautifully, though, as long as you take care to create a nice design with the apples. The taste was also good, but not exceptional.

This worked well as a work potluck dessert. You can make it ahead and it presented nicely. The crust was a little hard to cut through, but there were no complaints (except from myself) about that since many just liked eating the crust anyway.

This seemed to work well as a work potluck dessert. You can make it ahead of time and it presented nicely. The crust was a little hard to cut into, but no complaints about that since a lot of people really liked just eating the crust.

I love this recipe - I only used 1 cup of flour and 1/3 cup of sugar for the crust with 1/2 c butter for a perfect crust. Toasting the almonds separately is a great idea. My co-workers were more than eager to sample this recipe!

Excellent flavor, My hubby fell in love with it. I found the crust to be a bit tough, it needed a sharp knife. Next time I'll double the filling.

For ease of preparation, taste, and lovely presentation, this earns four stars. I heeded advice from several reviewers and made minor changes. I added 1/2 t. cinnamon to the crust, which I did in a food processor. I used almond extract in the crust and filling with a little vanilla in the filling too. Two Golden Delicious apples cut in 1/4 inch slices amply covered the top. I used Trader Joe's pre-toasted almond slices for the top and added them after I removed the torte from the oven. I lined the inside of the springform pan with foil so I could lift the torte out for transporting after I trimmed the edges. Using a water glass to press the crust in the pan gets a ditto from me. This will be a definite make-again. It looks as if it came from a restaurant.

I have made this recipe a number of times and it has gradually changed into a cheesecake with an apple topping. I double the filling, add orange zest and almond extract to the filling, and make a crumb crust for an even easier and quicker cake. I now use just 2 apples, arranged in a flower pattern, and toast the almonds seperately and sprinkle on afterwards, which makes it easier to control the browning of them. I prefer this (cheesecake lover!) but the original recipe is still delicious.

Very easy and ofcourse deelish ! I use less sugar each time and plan to use less the next time :-) But that is just me. Planning to try local fruits for topping, maybe papaya, mango, pineapple and tamarind.

wonderful! i highly recommend using almond extract in the crust vs. vanilla. makes it especially tasty!

Rating: 3
quite tasty! i found it unnecessary to add liquid to the crust--doing so probably resulted in it becoming too hard for some of you. use a pastry blender to cut in the softened (room temp) butter--the dough doesn't need to stick together. here's a great tip for "patting" it into the pan. use a drinking glass with a flat bottom to press the crust firmly, then use the sides of the glass to push it against the pan sides. works like charm and no messy fingers! next time i might increase the filling quantity a bit, add some lemon zest, and use a juicier apple (i had haralson's from my mother's tree and they are too dry.) the girl's at my league meeting raved!

Made this at the last minute before company came for dinner. It was a huge success. I substituted 1/2 Cup ground almonds for 1/2 cup of flour in the crust. Also substituted almond extract for the vanilla in the crust. The result -- guests who just wanted to eat the crust!. The filling was exceptional -- all in all, a huge hit. Only baked it 1 hour - not the 90 minutes the recipe suggested

Very very good. Looked very professional. The only thing was that I had to add a little water to the crust to make it come together. Turned out great though.

I like this much better with golden delicious apples and WITHOUT cinnamon, but with some lemon juice added. The natural flavour of apples blends well with sliced almonds, without fighting against the strong flavour of cinnamon.

This recipe sounds great. I haven't made it yet. Do you think that it would be okay to make it in a tart pan (10 or 11 inch) and reduce the time?

Rating: 4
Absolutely delicious, easy to make, and the presentation is beautiful. For ease, I creamed the butter & sugar, added the vanilla, then mixed in the flour. Same with the filling; used softened cream cheese. Arranged the apple slices in a circular pattern on the top before baking and omitted the almonds. It's perfect without adding anything else. Make this at least two times a month.

I made this for the second time at Thanksgiving and everybody loved it! It is a perfect cross between a apple pie and cheesecake. One word of warning, both times I made it, I had a very hard time cutting the crust with a regular pastry server. You'll want to use a very sharp knife instead.

This is an OK dessert. If you want more pizzazz try something else or try adding marzipan to the crust for more almond flavor or if you're looking for more of an apple kicker add calvados to the apple mix.

My family raved about this fairly simple dessert - however I found that it lacked something.. needs a little punch somewhere to counter the blandness- next time I'll try adding something to the cream cheeses mixture. Anyone have any suggestions?

This torte is the best and so easy to make. I found the crust easy to work with and the flavors so complimentary of one another. The worst part is that I had to wait until the next day to eat it!

I made this a day ahead for a birthday party. Pastry shop looking presentation. My husband cut into it the night before, so I had to make a second. Since I ran out of vanilla extract, I used almond extract with the second and it was just as good. I will make this again!

I made this for Mother's day. After reading the reviews, I was a little nervous about the crust. I had to add a little bit of milk to help it come together, and I was a little skimpy when meauring the sugar. Otherwise, made it exactly as listed. It was not soft, but certainly not hard. The presentation is really beautiful. I am a new cook and am glad I saw a similar recipe on the Food Network--I was able to cut my apples really thin and arrange them like a rose. When I brought it to the table, at first everyone thought I bought it--that's how pretty it looked. Surprisingly, this torte/tart is very easy to make!!!

Excellent! The only thing I would do differently is make sure the crust is a little more even next time - it is a little hard, so if it's thick in some spots, then it's hard to cut gracefully while eating.

Based on my own assessment and that of family and friends, this is a first-class keeper! It is not, however, a "torte," which is a cake, but a "tart." Notes from others were a good guide. I added some liquid (half and half) to the uncooperative dough until it pulled together. I also added some grated lemon rind to the cream cheese and an apricot glaze to the finished product. This made a lovely presentation and a delicious dessert.

I brought this Torte to a family gathering and everyone loved it!!!!! The crust was hard and I thought I would change it but everyone said NO that they liked it the way it was. I plan on making this again for Christmas. This is a real crowd pleaser!!!!

The easiest torte I have ever made. Very delicious. I made this for company and it was a big hit. I will definately make this over and over again!

I also took Dawn (see other reviews below) suggestions. I cut the sugar in the topping to. I didn't get the reason for the foil collar so I didn't use it. Also the crust was real difficult to cut into. But the taste was there so I will make again. I do love all the ingredients.

Just great! I used half granny smith apples and half red apples along with some dried cranberries (Craisins) and a few walnuts thrown in for texture. I didn't bother to peel the apples but I might next time.

I,ve made this twice recently. It is very good as is. The second time I used marscapone cheese and used half apples and half pears mixed with a little crystalized ginger instead of vanilla. Served with vanilla icecream it is wonderful. Be sure to chill overnight and serve cold.

I used Dawn's pastry recipe (Below) --it was excellent!! Everybody that tasted this rated it out of this world. All butter crust even w/cookies makes it too crumbly. Also couldn't wait overnite to try it--put it in the freezer for an hour or so. It worked!

I thought this torte was not especially flavourful, mostly because it says to serve cold. Why not at room temperature? The crust is too sweet as well as too hard after being refrigerated, making it difficult to cut as well as to eat. I ended up picking up the slice with my hand to eat because a fork just wasn't working. And what is the reason for the foil collar? I didn't find the crust getting too dark while baking so I don't think it's necessary.

This got rave reviews from all the guests - a definite make again. Simple, beautiful dessert. The crust is a great recipe - I did have to add a bit of cold water to get the right consistency. I also used a lower fat cream cheese which worked just as well.

To make the crust more tender I used 4T butter and 3T crisco and reduced the sugar in the crust to 1/4 C. with great results. Also reduced the sugar to 1/4 C in the topping.

I also made this torte for an office going away party. Everyone raved about it. I doubled the recipe to fit my 10" springform pan and made a very small one for home. Will definitely make it again.

This was a hit when I made it for the folks in my office! I used a lower-fat cream cheese -- which I bought by mistake, meaning to get the full-fat kind -- and it was still very rich and lovely. I added about a tablespoon of cold water to my crust ingredients, which made the "dough" hold together better and made it easier to press nicely into the springform pan. This is a beautiful, classy dessert. Make it sometime.

I made this 3 times and the last time as a tart--the crust is wonderful

The recipe was fabulous, but the baking time seemed excessive, so the crust was dry. The concept was great.

Could not form dough into a ball, so I just patted the crust in the (greased, no foil) pan. The crust is similar to shortbread. The cake gets even better the second or third day. For the heart-attack-by-torte variation try mascarpone instead of cream cheese.
