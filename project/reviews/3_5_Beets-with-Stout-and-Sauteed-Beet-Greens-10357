We enjoyed this. I used balsalmic instead of stout for the beets, and added some fresh garlic when cooking the greens. Will make again.

Easy and delicious way to make beets and greens even better. I subbed balsamic vinegar for the red wine and port for the stout. Made it all a bit sweeter than the original recipe, I'm sure, but the greens still balanced it all out beautifully.

Wow, this recipe turned out great. I followed others' suggestions and substituted balsalmic vinegar for the stout. I also added garlic to the greens. Everything was delicious.

Couldn't resist adding bacon to the greens and feta at the last minute and it was delish!

I love reading the reviews. I substituted orange juice and zest for the beer and added garlic to the greens. Everyone loved it.

All I want to add to these good and informative reviews is that: if you're working with beets or beet greens -DO NOT WEAR A WHITE SHIRT! I learned the gard way - that juice does not come out of anything!

Depending on how large your beets are, it might be better to divide them into 1/8s instead of quarters after cooking & peeling. Ours were large & unwieldy on top of the slippery greens! I agree with the suggestion of substituting balsamic for stout and adding garlic to the greens as they cook. I also wanted to point out - if you are substituting kale for the beet greens (which I did last night) - remember kale will take longer to cook! I simmered my coarsely chopped kale in about 1 quart of water for 15 minutes. I then drained it and returned it to the pot with the butter and garlic to saute for about 5 minutes. Finally, because I love cheese... we added small drops of goat cheese to the warm beets when we plated it... delicious! (and, incidentally, nutritious!)

A good, fulfilling, and easy recipe. Best as a side dish. Like others have said, I didn't really notice any significance in the addition of the stout. Good excuse to crack open an extra beer though. Replacing the stout with Balsamic Vinegar really improved the flavor if you prefer your beets slightly pickled. Too many beets:greens because the greens shrink so much. Double the greens (or more) to serve 8. Adding a clove or two of garlic to the greens butter really improved the flavor.

this recipe was fast and delicious. I added baby turnip greens and garlic to the beet greens and a little balsamic to the beets along with the red wine vinegar. I'm not sure the stout is necessary--next time I'll make it without, or try a substitute.

We love beets and beet greens but somehow this recipe didn't come through. I used fresh beets bought that morning at our local public (farmer's) market, so I know they were as fresh as can be. Woouldn't make again.

Top notch. Excellent way to prepare fresh beets. The sweet flavor of the beets in accentuated by the tart vinegar. I cooked my beets in a pressure cooker, then peeled and reheated with the sauce. Yum Yum.

The first time I prepared this recipe was the first time I made beet greens, and I almost ate them all before my husband got home for dinner! YUM! Every time we get beets with greens in our CSA box, he asks me to make them this way. If you are a beet fan, this is a great way to enjoy them.

Red and green make this a good christmas dish. Greens shrink a lot and are tastier than I expected. Not sure what the stout does other than give it a cool title, it didn't alter the flavor that i could tell. Rustic and delicious overall.
