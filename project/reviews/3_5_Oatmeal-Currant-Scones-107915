Yummy! These scones are feather light and delicious. I used dried blueberries instead of currants. The dough was very sticky so I dropped large spoonfuls on a cookie sheet and it worked out very well.

Yum! The oatmeal made the scones! Not too sweet and browned nicely. Delicious served with lemon curd.

Like this. I get away with one stick of butter, white whole wheat flour, and I simply make a mound of dough on the cookie sheet, sprinkle with turbinado sugar, and cut into wedges which I space out to give room for spreading.

i wanted a basic scone, so i omitted the currants. the dough is indeed quite sticky, and using floured surface/hands makes the workability possible. i made sure all my ingredients were at room temperature, EXCEPT for the butter, which was frozen 1/4 inch cubes. i found that placing the fresh still hot scones in a tupperware, made for extra moist scones the next morning. they are very good, though i am looking for a very specific recipe that yeilds a much lighter, biscuit-like quality. as i said, these are fantastic scones, but i'm still on the search for the recipe that resembles what i had at a tea house in georgia.

I thought they were just OK honestly. I used cream and lemon juice in place of buttermilk. They are very light. they spread a lot and looked more like muffin tops than what I think a scone should look like.

Excellent scones. Very light in texture and go perfectly with a cup of tea. Oatmeal gives the scones a nice moistness. I skipped the egg wash and added extra currants. Perhaps I overprocessed the oats or the butter, as my batter was very wet and sticky. But it didn't stop me from being able to make rough circular shapes. Leave plenty of room between the scones, as they spread during baking. Eat them quickly, though - had some left over the next morning and they were fine, but after about 24 hours they start to dry out.

Ah, i foud it! I didn't get this recipe when i did an exact name search...odd...oh well..i rated another very similar to this one! That was for practice..this is for real!:) These were very tender scones..the oatmeal really adds an earthy taste and texture. I used craisin's and i only made about 12 scones! Great recipe for lazy sundays like today!:)

Wonderfully light. I can not stop eating them. I used turbinado sugar for the topping for extra crunch. I will add some zest next time.

I made these in the home of the scone, and our English friends and relatives gobbled them up, and pronounced them lovely and light! I used milk with lemon juice in place of buttermilk ... and, if your currants aren't very moist, a little soak in orange juice wouldn't hurt. Great with blackcurrant jam!

Added orange peel which made an amazing difference! MUCH better.

I really enjoyed these scones. They had more of a biscuit consistancy than that of a traditional scone. I found that they were a bit sweeter than other scones i have had. I did make a few changes though. I added dried cherries instead of the currents and i put in 1/2 cup of sugar. These would be great with a cup of english tea! I will be adding them to my collection.
