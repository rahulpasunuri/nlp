This is a classic popover/yorkshire pudding recipe, which I use all the time. I have had problems with doughy-ness in the past. But I think it may actually be undercooking. Don't take them out of the oven unless the bottom is well browned. Also, wisk the batter again right before putting it into the oven.

The ratio here -- 1/2c flour and 1/2 cup milk for each egg -- uses about half as much egg as some recipes I've seen. As a result of this, the pudding doesn't rise as much as those. A dense, doughnut like thing was left in place of a spongy mound. Next time i'm going with three eggs and 3/4 cup of flour/milk.

Help! Don't know where I went wrong but the last 2 times I've made these the puddings/popovers just end up a doughy mess! I reviewed this in 2005 and gave it 4 stars - have made it several times since, but the last 2 times were dismal failures - mine, not the recipe. Anyone have advice?

These are wonderful! This was the first time I'd made Yorkshire pudding and I couldn't have been happier with the outcome. I used 3 eggs instead of 2 at the suggestion of one of the reviewers. I ran out of time and only refrigerated the dough 15 minutes.I also made them in muffin tins instead of in one pan. We'll definately have these again!!!

These worked really well. The recipe is easy to follow, I would add make the batter in advance and refrigerate. The fat should be hot and the batter cold. I had made Yorkshire puddings many times as I lived in Yorkshire for most of my life. But was unable to get them to work in Canada, this was my last attempt. I personally think using whole milk is important as that is the only difference that I can think of as to why I appeared to be unable to make them anymore. My family had switched to 1% milk.

These were lovely - probably should have put less batter in each muffin cup to yield closer to 18 large puddings instead of 12. Had very little fat from the prime rib, so used a bit of butter in the bottom of each muffin cup and melted in the hot oven.

Perfect Yorkshire puddings. I used 4 1 cup size ramikins and put on a cookie sheet. I didn't measure the reserved beef fat, but probably only put in 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons in each ramikin. They puffed up beautifully and were ready after the prime rib rested. They were beautiful and tasted great!

I was a bit nervous about doing these, but follow the recipe and they come out perfect. I left them in the oven for maybe 4 extra minutes. Delicious with the prime rib cabernet au jus.

If you double the recipe, it's enough for two 6 cup muffin tins. Át our house that is just right for three or four hungry people.

Fabulous recipe. I have made several times using a 6 hole muffin tin. I use approx. 1 tsp. bacon drippings for fat. Yorkshire pudding needs whole milk as with 2% or skim you may have a pancake. My children fit over these, so I have to double the recipe.

On the advice of a British friend, I substituted 1/3 c water and 2/3 non- fat milk because with whole milk these were too doughy. Also, a little more salt. I let the batter sit at room temp. I used large non- stick muffin tins and about 1/3 c batter and a scant 1/4 t. fat from the prime rib. This would have been better with the pie plates, I will look out for them. Delicious with the merlot gravy!

These turned out exactly as I expected them too, and they were great! I used butter and a 6 cup muffin tin, but next time I will use beef fat when making them w/prime rib. I think they really only need 1/2 tablespoon of fat or butter or oil per pudding, otherwise they are just a bit to greasy. I will definitely stick to this recipe!

These were perfect and so easy. I made them with the Prime Rib with Cabernet au Jus from this site. Wonderful combination. I also made them in muffin tins and they turned out just fine.

I made these for Christmas dinner with a fantastic prime rib roast. Everyone enjoyed them (my husband LOVED them). I made an au jus with the roast and after dipping the pudding in the au jus they were quite tasty. The recipe made 8 puddings in a 12 cup muffin pan.

Made these puddings in a 6 hole muffin tin with prime rib for Christmas dinner...absolutely delicious! Lovely individual servings. Followed directions except used about 1/4-1/2 cup batter. Perfect and easy! Try them!!!

Decided last minute to make yorkshire pud as my husband was making the most divine roast lamb - followed recipe for measurements but used 6 hole muffin tray - they were just the way I imagined they should be. My husband really enjoyed them - he is the main chef in our house these days - we will use this recipe again as so simple - the kids would enjoy them too and look forward to involving them in the cooking process!

Made this last night as a component of an experimental dinner. I have tried many popover recipes and failed multiple times, but this was a huge success. I used the large williams sonoma chili bowls to bake in and they worked great.

The perfect Yorkshire Pudding recipe. I recall my mother burning it year after year, but I wanted to give this xmas staple a try. I used a large muffin pan and just the drippings in the bottom. 20 minutes was the perfect amount of time and they turned a beautiful golden brown color. A definite hit!

The English family visiting our home fought over these.

My husband is English and his daughter and children are visiting for the holiday. They are leaving on the 23rd, so on the 21st I made them all an early Christmas dinner. When they all found out I was making a prime ribroast, they requested Yorkshire pudding. Epicurious to the rescue! I made 12 of these in muffin tins for nine people. They fought over them. My husband declared them perfect.

Sorry - failed to mention in my review - I never dirty the blender for this, just whisk. Easier clean-up.

These work well everytime. I make half the recipe in 6 muffin cups. We have these with steak as well as roast beef.

Since I was cooking for 2 with a one rib roast I made 1/2 the recipe and made 4 puddings in a regular muffin tin for 6. As an earlier reviewer suggested, I used part butter, part pan drippings from my rib roast. Delicious! My only "complaint" - the puddings deflated quickly, but they were still wonderful - especially with some au jus from the roast. Will definitely make again!

These were awesome!!! I too used a muffin pan (for 12) and just sprayed the muffin pan with Canola oil to cut down on the fat content. These "Yorkshires" will definitely be served again any time I serve a roast.

These are perfect, the best Yorkshire Pudding recipe out there. Don't make Prime Rib without them!!

I'm a novice cook who hadn't had Yorkshire pudding since my Grandma made it years ago. Served it at Christmas and the whole family loved it! I substituted a 3 inch muffin pan for the individual pie plates (use 1/3 cup batter) and it worked better than fine and, I suspect, it was easier to put in and take out of the oven.

I use duck fat from duck confit and there's no smoke and the puds are wonderful!

For years I, and my mother before me, used the yorkshire pudding recipe from the NY Times cookbook. However, after trying this recipe I've become a convert! I used a large non-stick muffin tin which made for beautiful, individual puddings vs. the single one in the NY Times recipe. I used a pat of butter in each of the six tins and just a dribble of fat from my rib roast and it was fine. I also add chopped, fresh rosemary to the batter which adds a lot to any yorkshire pudding recipe. I heard raves all around!

Turn your smoke alarms off before you try this one at home. And expect to be cleaning your oven afterwards. These yorkshire puddings were delicious, but they create *a lot* of smoke when you are heating the drippings, and that smell (and fat) gets into your oven pretty well. So you couldn't cook a delicate custard in there afterwards unless you cleaned the oven. My guests thought I was burning the house down - so did I - until the puddings came out - perfect. Not sure I'd make this again at home b/c of the mess-

Good dependable recipe.I did use a large muffin tin to bake them. It worked out fine.

I had english people over for dinner and they said that these were the best yorkshire puddings they have had. They were very easy to make and puffed up perfect. I will definately make this again!

I give very few dishes 4 forks--but this really deserved it!! I forgot to keep the fat after searing the meat, so I cut off some fat from the finished meat and rendered it. I put equal amounts in a muffin pan and cooked the puddings for about 20 minutes--FABULOUS! In my opinion, these were the highlight of the meal--you won't be disappointed with these--rendered fat is the key ingredient!!!

This is delicious as well as beautiful. I substituted baby vegetables (zucchini,pattypan squash and carrots)along with the pearl onions for a more unique and colorful presentation.
