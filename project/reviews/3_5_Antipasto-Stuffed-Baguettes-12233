Fabulous make ahead that everyone loved. I used spinach and made my own tapanade and roasted red peppers. Use the bread to make a bread and tomato salad if you like!

Made this for a recipe this weekend and it was a hit1 A friend of mine's finicky girlfriend liked it so much, he asked for the recipe. It's a great party recipe because you can make it ahead of time and just serve it cut into little finger sandwiches.

This was super!!! Best part was the make ahead feature. Served them at a cocktail party and not a crumb left. Did 2 varities: goat cheese and olive tapenade; and fresh mozzarella and pesto (all other ingredients as recipe). Next time want to try replacing peppers with sundried tomato on the mozzarella and pesto version. ONe recommendation: Dont be skimpy with the fillings!!!

I cut the slices smaller and used them for finger food at a cocktail party. They were attractive and tasty.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it always vanishes! I've made it for school parties so we have some "grown up" food and for picnics, cocktail parties,graduation parties, appetizers - everyone always loves it!. I've substituted spinach for arugula but nothing else. I always used pre-done olive spread because it's easier but I love the pesto suggestion - I'm going to try that next! I love that you can make these the night before too.

I usually don't scoop out the baguettes - just layer everything on, chill, and serve as full-size sandwiches. It makes a great no-cook lunch or supper for hot days. The ingredients are easy to adjust up or down according to your tastes (I usually go easy on the goat cheese because too much seems cloying).

I've made these several times but used fresh mozz instead of goat cheese. Just not a fan of the latter. For those who like these and may want to try a substitution for the olive paste, I also tried (1) a high quality calamata olive tapenade (with lemon, anchovies, capers, garlic, sun dried tomatoes), and (2) regular basil pesto. All are equally great. Used spinach or basil leaves as alternative for arugula (hard to find good arugula here sometimes). Also, used individual ciabatta rolls from Costco, spit and grilled, before assembling sandwiches. I agree with Texas that they get better after a day or two. We took them on a ski weekend trip one time for lunches on both days. The salami and artichokes go so well together. Also, for a change, substitute sliced peppedews for the roasted red pepper. They are awesome tasting. Bon Appetite!

I made this for my friends and there was none left by the end of the night. I substituted mozzarella for the goat cheese and baby spinach for the arugula. I also drizzled some extra vrgin olive oil and fresh basil and oregano. Excellent.

This sandwich is wonderful! I did make one change however. Since my husband dosen't care for goat cheese I substituted it with soft mozzarella. I also bought the tepenade rather than make my own but I think the next time I will use homemade. It really depends on how easy you want this recipe to be. This sandwich will definately be a summertime poolside favorite!

I wanted to love this, it sounded great and has all the ingredients I love. However, I found it bland. I wasn't overly impressed and I won't bother to make it again.

Not only will I make this again but I am making these to take on a road trip today, for tomorrow. These are a great idea and delicious as well. The last ones lasted 3 days and were even better after they were wrapped for a couple of days. Yum.

This appetizer is now a staple in my recipe box. Considering the quantity this recipe produces, the prep time is nothing. I also used spinach and the black Trader Joe's tapanade and Trader Joe's red peppers. Awesome!

I've made these twice now and they were a big hit both times. Plus I love the convenience of being able to do everything the day before. I didn't find arugala so I used baby spinach leaves instead and it tasted great.

I enjoyed this, but not many of my guests did. I did have to use green olive tapenade, which I believe may have made it too tangy.

Holy COW this was good. Definatly worth getting quality ingredients for. Wowie.

I used smaller rolls (about 9") and served as sandwiches. They were delicious! If you are buying your arugula leaves loose, I found that the entire 2 cups would not fit. Don't be afraid to pile the ingredients high though. Once the sandwich is chilled it holds together well.

Used this recipe for a large group. Preparation was easy,can be prepared the day before, wrapped in tin foil, and refrigerated. Would make again.

This was not a bad dish- but I wasn't enthralled, either. I think it would be a nice light lunch or tapas component. In conjunction with a number of other appetizers, and as a precursor to a multicourse meal, it proved to be a bit more substantial than my guests wanted.

Wonderful recipe! I served it as an appetizer and everyone loved it. I had a whole baguette left over and had it for lunch the next day as a sandwich!

I served these great sandwiches with the spicy cumin cheese straws, the tomato and bacon salad, and the lemon fennel shrimp with tarragon and some great light chardonnay and my guests were thrilled!

This is a wonderful appetizer for a crowd -- even a picky one. I served it a couple of weeks ago and people just raved about it.

Not too time consuming to prepare and goes over well with the guests.
