Delicious, simple recipe. I sometimes make it without the garlic too. (I have actually been using this recipe for 15 years, and finally decided to write a review.) Without the garlic it is a great side for soups, mussels, and anything where you want to sop up some liquidy sauce. I use the garlic when we do a pasta with red sauce.

This was very easy, and it made a nice change from store-bought garlic bread. I went easy on the rosemary--barely a dusting for each slice of bread, and it was perfect. My husband loved it, and we will definitely make it again!
