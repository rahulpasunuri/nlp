I make king cake once a year, and this year I was determined to get it right. I made 5 cakes over the week (we had a party so no i didn't eat all 5 =) ), using three different recipes, and settled on this recipe - with some changes! I used 3 large eggs instead of 5 yolks. i used cooler milk (100 not 110), i did not add the flour to yeast mixture, and i made the yeast mixture in a measuring cup first, then added that to the mixing bowl of eggs, vanilla, etc. i also added an extra cup of flour - it was just too sticky without more. i let the ball rise about an hour, formed a ring (i rolled it out and filled with cinnamon/butter/sugar), and then let the ring rise overnight. i baked it for 20 minutes at 375 in the morning, and treated everyone to king cake for breakfast. also made up a different icing based on the other comments here. in the end, it made a wonderful, fragrant, king cake. Happy Mardi Gras!!

This is good, but it's more like a brioche dough than the king cake I've had from a bakery. I had to add quite a bit more flour to the dough to make it workable by hand.

Very good, and the texture was perfect. It did cook faster than 30 min, so it was a little crispy at the edges. The icing was so thick, so I added some more lemon juice to thin it and really liked the results. It made the icing less overwhelmingly sweet and added a nice lemon/acid flavor. I dyed my sugar purple by putting some dye paste (the stuff you use for cake decorating) in a zip top baggie along with some sugar. Just worked the sugar around in the bag until it was all purple.

Umm 30 minutes??? I put it in for 25 and it was DEFINITELY a little crispy on top. Really disappointing.

This is a pretty good king cake, but three things to note. 1, Add cinnamon and nutmeg right at the end of kneading or add it when you braid the loaf, otherwise it gets lost and your cake is kinda brown. 2. Watch it carefully when baking, mine was dry at 30 minutes. 3. Just use regular milk, not condensed for the frosting. It makes a hard little ball that has to be thinned and there's no need to spend the money on the condensed milk.

Eh. I'm a Southern girl and this just underwhelmed the Culinary Carnival in me. The cake was lovely but I'll try another icing recipe the next time 'round and maybe try melting the colored sugars for a prettier drizzle. Or top it with some fresh berries sans icing and sugar. NOTE: If you live at high altitude, subtract 2-3 tablespoons of sugar in the cake mix and you're golden!

I am originally from New Orleans and to those who thought their king cake came out too dense, that is the way they are supposed to be. I used to go home for Mardi Gras when I was in college and always brought a king cake back from MacKenzies to share with my roommates.

I made this on Saturday for the Supper Club that I participate in. Our theme for the month was Mardi Gras, and this fit the bill perfectly. I haven't worked that much with yeast before, so I was concerned about how this would turn out. IT WAS WONDERFUL! Everyone raved about it at the party. I stayed pretty close to the recipe, except for using my KA stand mixer for the mixing and kneading. With the mixer it did not take 15 minutes for kneading - more like 4-5. I wasn't really counting, but just looked for what I thought to be the right elasticity and texture. Will definitely make this again, and will probably try to sell some for next years Mardi Gras season.

I thought this was a nice recipe. I wasn't as methodical with the yeast part as I usually am, and it didn't look at all like it had doubled in size during the first rise. I plodded through and then again, it didn't look like it rose at all during the 30 minutes it sat before baking, so I was prepared for a total flop. It puffed up beautifully in the oven, however, and even the end where I sealed the braids together looked great after it baked. It looked like something from a bakery to my total surprise. I couldn't find purple sugar at the store, so I dyed white crystals in purple food coloring and that worked well. The flavor is good; much better than anything from the grocery store, and specialty bakeries charge a small fortune ($25) for this humble creation , so all in all I am very pleased! Happy Fat Tuesday!

This recipe is straight-forward. For the glaze, the recipe calls for condensed milk. Is this evaporated milk or sweetened condensed milk? I tried the latter and it took a lot more than a quarter cup to make a spreadable glaze. Added a lot more lemon juice. Please clarify.

Wow, did this smell amazing as I was preparing it! The cinnamon and fresh lemon zest were heavenly and made me suspect that this king cake would end up tasting better than the supermarket king cakes I've had in the past. That being said, I wasn't entirely pleased with the final produc. Not that it was bad -- far from it. But it just didn't have the wow factor that I'm accustomed to with Epicurious recipes. The bread was a little denser than I'm used to, but that may be attributable to my limited experience with yeasted doughs or my high-humidity environment here in Florida. I also felt that it needed more cinnamon. As for the thickness of the icing, I thought it was perfect. I used a silicone pastry brush to spread it over the top of the cake, and that worked great. All in all, it's a good recipe that was easy to follow and perfect for celebrating Mardi Gras.

I loved the flavor of the cake, and the icing was great after thinning it out. I kind of hoped it turned out lighter/less dense, but that probably has to do more with my bread baking skills than with the recipe itself. I'll look into tips for brioche begginers.

While I've never actually eaten a King Cake, I made this for a Super Bowl party and I think it turned out pretty well! I was too lazy to buy the sprinkles so I used food coloring instead. It looked great!

Great recipe. The cake smelled wonderful while baking. I had to add a little regular milk to the icing to get it to drizzle. I took it to an early fat tuesday party. It is not overly sweet so it was a big hit with the adults - not so much with the children. The bread gets more flavorful the next day. Will probably make it a day early next year.
