A big pain in the neck to make, but this salad is a hit with the PTA ladies and the teacher aides. I generally do not eat foods with mayonnaise, but once the fresh arugula is out at the farmer's market, I s-l-o-w-l-y cook four packages of chicken breasts and have at it. My changes, albiet nothing original, save me time & fat content. I sub out lower fat mayo without looking back; if I make my own buttermilk (using a cup of good whole milk to a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice) it still tastes & feels rich, with less cholesterol. This year I used proportionately more buttermilk, and liked the less bulky consistency better. I stored the dressing separately from the salad so it lasted longer. I did't cook the corn. Really fresh corn, thoroughly cleaned, doesn't need it. And instead of painfully salty pumpkin seeds, I used unsalted sunflower nuts because they are tiny and they work really well with the currants & asiago. That sweet, salty, crunchy triumvirate is a stock throw-in for my winter tossed salads, too. I don't worry very much about proportion or measurements, esp when it comes to the plum tomatoes or the corn. More is frequ better!! This recipe makes more than enough to share!

Ok, I made this salad exactly as written except I substituted pine nuts for the pumpkin seeds (I've done this on many other recipes and it's worked out fine). I have to say I was very disappointed, especially after reading so many rave reviews. The textures and flavors justed didn't meld well for me.

This was fresh tasting and very colorful. Since we don't have fresh basil in WI at this time of year, I used the modified dressing recipe from the Lafayette, CA reviewer that called for pesto (which I had in the freezer). It was excellent - used pearl couscous, dried cherries and slivered almonds. Great on day two also!

I made a few substitutions due to the season (it's Minnesota in the dead of winter) and my budget, but it still turned out great - although HUGE. Like big, mixing bowl huge. I used leftover (frozen, then thawed) turkey from Christmas, and chopped 1/2 of a big head of romaine instead of arugula. I used frozen corn and toasted it in a large saucepan to thaw. Two 15 oz cans of petite diced canned tomatoes went in instead of fresh, because winter tomatoes here are worthless (next time will probably use only 1 can). I was going to a potluck, so I mixed everything together before I left. 6 hours later, the romaine still held up to the moisture - not soggy at all. It easily served ~20 people to rave reviews. Next time, I'm going to try 1/2 C. of cilantro in place of the basil and steak instead of poultry... a fantastic way to have something fresh, light & healthy after the holidays AND use up leftover turkey! Now that I've made it, it's easy to see all of the variations that could be done with this salad.

The great thing about the salad is you pretty much can't go wrong. Make the dressing. Put a meat, the veggies, Couscous, and a nut, hard cheese, dried fruit combination on top of greens and it is a winner. I've used leftover steak, pork tenderloin, shrimp, grilled tuna and chicken./ They are all good. I like pine nuts the best for the nut.

I recently dined at Cowboy Ciao with a group of girlfriends. This was, without a doubt, the hit of the night, although everything was very good. I resolved to try to make it and this does a lovely job. Don't omit the seeds! They add the yummiest crunch. Also, I subbed finely chopped fresh cherries for the currents and it was amazing. DON'T MISS THIS SALAD!

Big hit for any time of year. With the chicken I make double the dressing, marinate chicken in half overnight and grill. Brings it all together.

The second time I made this I subbed yogurt for the mayo and buttermilk, just pureed basil and shallots with it and lemon juice, and it was fab. It's good as written too, just wanted to simplify. This is already a family favourite.

This is one of my family's favorite salad recipes. The dressing is very fresh. I've made it many times and am always asked for a copy of the recipe.

I replaced most of the mayo with plain yogurt and it was delicious. I mixed everything together except the arugula and put the couscous mixture atop a plate of arugula and grated a little more Asiago over it all and it looked very nice too.

Excellent. We had leftover chicken from previous nite and only switched to sunflower seeds. all else was per recipe. We mixed all but dressing in one bowl and then had each person add their own dressing

Salad is quite good but I am not impressed with the dressing. I will omit the dressing next time and dress the salad with my favorite vinigrette instead.

Great summer dish that really works as a main course. My friends loved it. Used vegan mayo with good results.

I do this salad all the time. I add a clove of garlic to the dressing and salt and pepper. I also have roasted potatoes and used feta cheese and pine nuts. I use dried cranberries sometimes and have done it as a mixed salad to take places or as a buffet item and added the dressing at the last minute.

I have to add my 4 forks to this recipe, which was a hit for a dinner party this weekend. Made the dressing as written--excellent! Since I was serving it as a side, I ommitted the chicken, and subbed soy nuts for the pumpkin seeds and parmesan for the Asiago (what I had on hand). Also forgot the arugula, but it was still great!

the best. not the usual dry cous cous, DELICIOUS. i mixed everything together in one big bowl, and it was perfect for an outdoor BBQ.

This is a great salad. We use pearl couscous, mix it with the chicken, veggies, currants and pumpkin seeds and serve it over a bed of arugula. The dressing is awesome.

My husband and i absolutely LOVE this recipe. To lighten it up, we use lowfat buttermilk and mayo and you don't miss the fat. It's still full of flavor! We also mix ALL the ingredients together except the arugula and eat it as is or serve over the arugula. Love it!

The perfect summer salad. Light and refreshing, yet delightfully filling. I personally wouldn't recommend using hydroponic tomatoes - you might as well sprinkle sawdust over your salad. Wait patiently for fresh heirlooms, corn and basil in late summer.

I LOVE this salad! I made for a ladies lunch and they all agreed that it is a keeper. I saved a little on the side to give to Hubby and he loved it too. This makes a LOT of dressing, which is fine with me since I adore basil - I used it on salad the second day. Before grilling the chicken, I rubbed with Potlatch seasoning from WS. It was sooooo good. I will make this salad again, maybe as soon as next week!

this recipe was easy and delicious...even my picky roommates loved it! I substituted almonds for pumpkin seeds and it worked very well. it makes a lot so I'll have it for lunch tomorrow also!

I work close by and eat there often. I always get the chopped salad (or the mushrooms and polenta - to die for!)As far as ingredients go they actually use dried sweet corn and pearl couscous. Fresh tomatoes are available year round - Arizona has one of the largest concentrations of hydroponic tomato farms anywhere!

Yee haw! I am thrilled to find this recipe. I just had this on vaca in AZ and it was the best salad ever. The restaurant now uses smoked salmon instead of chicken. I think there were also a few roasted peppers in it as well.... It was presented in a shallow bowl in rows of ingredients and then tossed with a bit of the dressing - not too much. Very nice...

Rating: 4
Honestly, this is one of my all time favorites. It is perfect for hosting a weekend lunch with friends - just cut up the ingredients and make the dressing the night before then toss just before serving.

Just wondering. How did all the folks who made this salad during the winter get fresh tomatoes, corn and basil when they're far out of season at that point? Did they substitute canned tomatoes and frozen corn?

Rating: 3
This was very interesting! I made it with mesclun, instead of arugula (unfortunately, many of our local stores don't regularly stock argula), smoked salmon -- as previous reviewers suggested -- and shelled sunflower seeds, instead of pumpkin seeds. I loved the variety of things in the salad and the smoked taste of the salmon. I'd like to try it with chicken next time, to see how it compares. Smoked chicken or turkey would also be a great alternative. Wonderful recipe!

This was so delicious that my husband and I ate the whole salad last night in one sitting even though it is huge. I also substituted sliced almonds for the pumpkin seeds. I had dried cherries on hand so I chopped them up and subbed them for the currants. I will definitely make this again but tonight I'll use the left over dressing for a tossed salad.

Made a second time. This time made a bed of chopped argula on a platter, mixed all the other ingredients, put over argula and served with dressing on the side. Still looked pretty, but much easier to serve. Also, cooked couscous in low salt chicken broth.

Rating: 4
This is a great salad, so I'm glad to have the recipe as now when I go to Cowboy Ciao I'll be able to skip it and have other things on the menu. I'd recommend the recipe from the 10/02 review, using smoked salmon like they have at the restaurant.

I liked this more than DH. I think it would have been better with far less dressing. The salad looked so pretty when I assembled all the ingredients but then I poured an ocean of creamy green dressing on it and it was overwhelming. I think probably 1/4 the amount in the recipe would work well.

I have made this several times, with and without the chicken. The salad is great either way. Women tend to like this more than men. Very unique and tasty. Perfect for a ladies luncheon.

What an awesome, easy tasty salad! I had no currants so I used raisins. I didn't bother seeding a whole pound of plum raisins and had an extra 3rd chicken breast. Will definitely make it again. Would be great for a pot-luck picnic.

As I haven't, yet, prepared this, didn't know how many forks.HELP, PLS.. Did the Lafayette,CA, cook divide all ingredients by 5 when giving the original? I want to "impress"(?) my Pastor with this in mid-April '05 so would,very much,appreciate advice. TX

I took this to a christmas luncheon and it was the hit of the party. I used salmon instead of chicken. Wouldn't change another thing. It is such a wonderful combination of flavors. My teens loved the dressing so much we use it on couscous, add a bit of feta and cucumber. I've made a lot of Epicurious recipes and this is one of the best.

Great. My mayo-hating husband loves this. The PTA Moms love it more. I substitute dried cranberries for the currants--I have those on hand. Too much salt in the pumpkin seeds, so anything else is better, or I just used half or less. Great. Yummy.

Rating: 4
WOW! Fabulous - Just a few suggestions. I made this along with a quiche for brunch. I couldn't find dried currants and I used canned corn. I left out the chicken. It was a great make ahead dish. Left overs did not get soggy in the fridge. The whole dish was gone the next day. (I mixed it all together in a big bowl.) Next time I would make it with Low fat mayo - that won't effect the taste at all.

Wow! What a great salad! This was a main course dinner for my husband and I last night. It is true that you can taste each ingredient and is beautiful! I served on a oval platter with 1 row of each ingredient and currant, cheese, pumkin seed mixture sprinkled over top. Will be doing again! Would be great to serve (or take) to a dinner or party!

We had this on a hot summer day. Wow was it refreshing. I couldn't find the shelled pumpkin seeds so I substituted almonds. It is simply outstanding. I followed the instructions on the presentation too: Lovely

We recently visited Scottsdale and also dined at Cowboy Ciao. We had the chopped salad (this recipe) except that nowadays, believe it or not, they make it with salmon instead of chicken! Either way, this is one of the most unique, tasty chopped salads you'll ever find - you can literally taste each and every ingredient as you savor each bite - the arugula is key! We also used spiced pumpkin seeds we found in our local natural foods market - a nice added touch. Enjoy!

Was entirely skeptical about this at first, since I'm not a big fan of currants, nor are pumpkin seeds generally in my pantry. However, I have to say this salad was absolutely terrific! Currants, pumpkin seeds, and all!

Yum! This is a new favorite in our house. I took it to a dinner party so I had to throw the whole thing together rather than doing the fancy plating. Still, it was great--pretty to look at and great to taste.

This salad definitely rates a four-fork rating. A dear friend suggested I eat this particular dish at this particular restaurant. I highly recommend following the Lafayette, CA reviewer's tips to re-create the original. It's worth the prep effort and makes for a spectacular meal.

This was EXCELLENT! Love the dressing and will make it again for different salads. Only shortcut I took was using a very high-quality canned corn vs. fresh. The blend of flavors was out of this world.

Been there and got the "original" master recipe. Try these, which differ a little from the magazine, and it'll be perfect: 2 oz. Israeli (pearl) couscous, 2 oz. chopped arugula, 2 oz. diced roma tomatoes tossed in olive oil and basil, 1 1/2 oz. diced smoked salmon, 1/2 oz. asiago cheese, 1/2 oz. pumpkin seeds, 1/2 oz. black currants, 1 oz. sweet dried corn. Dressing: 1/2 c. pesto, 1 chopped shallot, 1 c. aoili (mayo subst.), 1 c. buttermilk, 1/2 t. black pepper, 1/2 lemon, juice only. It's an amazing, unique salad sure to be a hit. Do prep ahead of time and arrange right before serving!
