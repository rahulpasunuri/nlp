This was the best dressing I ever made. I skipped the bacon to make it vegetarian and added more of the fresh herbs plus thyme and oregano. I always substitute the white parts of bok choi for celery which I don't like. Definitely a keeper.

I have made this every year since it was published. I also add a little extra broth. I also toast the almonds myself for a bit more toasted flavor than you get out of the bag.

This is the Thanksgiving staple that my friends and I have made for the last nine Thanksgiving holidays. It is magnificent, a great pair with the brown sugar-cured turkey listed on this site.

My mother-in-law and I have made this every year since it was published in Gourmet. We love it, and our guests always rave. This year I had the ultimate cook and critic to Thanksgiving, my mother, and she could not stop talking about it. We like to do it with the Turkey recipe with the sherried cider gravy.

I wanted to try something different this year. This was very good. But I prefer and will return to the family cornbread dressing.

Made this with a non-traditional bacon and the taste of the stuffing was delicious by very "smoky." Next time, I'd try it with a more standard bacon.

This is a great recipe! It was on the menu last Thanksgiving and Christmas. It's making it's appearance again this year. I definitely suggest increasing the amount of sage and stock. I prepare it a day in advance and then add the eggs/stock the next day. Add enough stock so it is really moist and sticky. The sourdough will stand up and come out golden, crisp and perfect.

This is a great recipe. My sister decreed last year that I was required to make this every year forever. I prefer to use crisper apples, like granny smiths. I find it's better if you don't stuff the bird with it, the apple loses flavor. I made my own sourdough for awhile, but now just use a good dense one.

Loved this! I would make sure to add enough broth so that it's still a little soupy prior to baking. The bread continued to soak up the broth and it was a little drier than I preferred. All of our Christmas dinner guests raved about it none-the-less.

I served this for thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews. I baked it in a clay pot and added a little extra broth to ensure it would not be dry. It was very moist and tasty.

I have made this recipe twice now and everyone loves it. However, to be heart-smart, I cut out the butter and bacon and use a spicy italian sausage. Delicious!

You've got to add all the broth to keep this moist enough. It's a great recipe, though. I used 3 T dry sage instead of fresh, and it seemed to work out just fine. Big hit with the family.

Fixed this for a large family gathering - They actually preferred it to my mother's traditional sage dressing!!

This will be the third Thanksgiving in a row I will make this stuffing! Everyone loves it and I now have pre-made copies of this recipe to hand out as everyone always asks for the recipe. I usually end up adding a little more broth than the recipe calls for to prevent the stuffing from being dry.

Sorry Wally, my crowd didn't like this one too much. It was a little dry and didn't hold up against the cardamon whipped sweet potatoes and bar-b-qued turkey.

I served this stuffing at Thanksgiving, and received complaints only when it did not appear again at Christmas. This is delicious, and will be served again by popular demand. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
