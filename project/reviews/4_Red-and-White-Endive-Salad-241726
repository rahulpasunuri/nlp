So easy and delicious. Sometimes I use lemon infused olive oil and that makes it even richer.

This is nothing other than the very typical endive vinaigrette one finds in ordinary, everyday French home cooking. A true classic of the French home cuisine, in other words. Tradition is never wrong. This is a perfect recipe.
