This sauce is amazing. It has a little zip and goes well with lots of meats as well as corn. Good with cooked asparagus. It's the kind of sauce you want to have in your fridge at all times. It beats all commerically made chili sauces. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

Butter was delicious. Although, I used a whole stick of butter because 1/2 stick didn't seem like it would be enough. Turned out great.

I made this twice. I love the sweet and savory and the smoky taste of the canned chipotle chilies in adobo. The second time I "sauced" the corn and wrapped the ears in heavy foil that i brushed down with a little evoo. Delicious and I didn't loose any of the great sauce. The ears still caramelized and browned beautifully. Great for tailgating...wrap them up and you are good to go. Touchdown (Go Hokies)

Great to accompany a BBQ! The sauce was a success among friends. You can make it a bit more spicy.

A great recipe - but for something truly awesome, put the chipotle-maple glaze on grilled salmon!

Fantastic recipe. I have had good results using chipotle powder instead of the canned chipotles -- that way I don't have a little can of leftover chipotle chilis sitting around. I've also made this with brown sugar and a little apple cider vinegar instead of the maple syrup.

We loved this glaze. Next time, I will try this on chicken and pork tenderloin as mentioned by others.

Glaze is wonderful on grilled pork tenderloin.

I love this recipie as a glaze. I especially love it on a grilled salmon fillet. I did find that using the cuisinart chopper is better for the chili mincing than a knife alone. I have also used it on chicken and pork. Everyone I have served this too loves it.

I actually made this glaze for boneless, skinless chicken thighs and it was delicious! My husband was hesitant to try the grilled corn (bad experience a long time ago), so I made the corn the traditional way and simply brushed the glaze on both sides of the chicken before grilling. I saved some sauce to pour over the top when it was done (about 5-6 mins. per side, on med-high gas grill). I may try marinating the chicken next time in a zip-lock bag for a few hours and will add a few more chipoltes, but it was fine as-is too!

Delicious! I could eat my corn like this everytime!

This was fine, not amazing, but a good side dish and more interesting than regular plain corn. I think I would make it more often with corn not from the summer, but the summer corn is so sweet and good alone that I felt kind of cheated with the glaze.

Great recipe! I cut the corn off the cob after grilling and tossed it with the left over glaze. Simple and amazing.

Great on corn, but I like it better used as a grilling glaze for pork, and also brush it on the sweet potato wedges I bake to serve alongside. Unbelievably yummy. I add more chipotle because we love the heat.

I frequently make this for summer guests, lakeside. To make this easier yet, I brush the mixture onto the corn, and wrap each ear in foil. Brings out the sweetness in the corn, still carmelizes, and is easy to serve. My guests rave over this. For best results, I use the yellow and white "candy corn" variety of sweet corn.

Have made this twice. It is not for people who don't like spicey food. The chipotle flavor is wonderful...I can't believe that chili powder would be nearly as good. I didn't mince the chipotles fine enough, though, and had too many large chunks. I think I'll try the Cuisinart next time.

This corn is damn good. It's definitely not a "pure" corn recipe, since it pretty much completely covers up the taste of the corn, but it's oh so good. I didn't have chipotle chilis and just substituted 2 tsp of chili powder instead for heat, probably could have used more. To help with the messiness, don't break off the entire stalk end of the ear. That leaves a handle on the corn that doesn't get sauce all over it. Then only one of your hands gets dirty...

the corn was awesome. a little messy, but in such a good way. instead of salting the corn before serving it i added a little more salt to the glaze then squeezed lime over it and it was fantastic.

A huge hit with my family and friends. Very easy to prepare -- I didn't change a thing.

I got distracted and over cooked the glaze a bit - it turned to caramel and hardened as soon as it cooled, so it wasn't brushable. The flavor and aroma were fantastic though, and I'll definitely try to make this again more carefully!

Made this for our neighborhood dinner club (the theme was a crab feast) and it was huge hit! the sauce was really easy to prepare and a perfect blend of sweet and spicy! I'll definitely be making this again!

Wonderful! Easy to make and absolutely delicious. I swear I will never eat corn on the cob again unless it has this chipotle-maple glaze. Spicey/sweet flavor is wonderful; make sure to salt it generously before eating!

This was the first time I had glazed corn. It was really good. Try it with the Orange and Lime Marinated Lamb Kebabs. They grill for about the same amount of time and go together great.

I don't care for chipolte - so I substituted crushed red pepper flakes. Absolutely delicious. A real hit.

If I'm eating a southwest preparation of corn, I typically favor it a bit simpler and more traditional -- roast in husk and topped with a bit of butter, chili powder, and maybe some Cholula. However, this was quite a tasty departure from that. A little too sweet for everyday use, but the glaze was delicious. I imagine leftover glaze would be quite good on a ham or some chicken.

I over cooked the corn (talked to much to my company!) but the flavor was great! can't wait to try the left over glaze on some salmon or even chicken.

A great addition to a grilled steak menu. Has enough sweetness to go with a sour companion.
