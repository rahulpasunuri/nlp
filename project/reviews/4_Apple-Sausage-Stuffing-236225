I made this to stuff into our Thanksgiving turkey and got rave reviews. It was excellent. I used ready made chicken and apple suasage instead of the pork tenderloin/fat and as another reviewer suggested, I used half cornbread and added a small amount of chopped prunes. Everything else I followed as written. It was delicous.

I didn't rate this recipe because I used lean ground pork and added 1.5 cups of chicken broth based on other reviews. With those changes, it was relatively easy and delicious! It would've been dry without the broth addition. Definitely a keeper!

This stuffing recipe is a winner and a new tradition, not a turkey! (Sorry, couldn't resist!) When my son vetoed the classic onion stuffing this year, I challenged him to find an alternate. This is what my brilliant son found! Because we decided on this Wednesday night, we had to substitute Italian sweet sausage, boule (crust on), and Maker's Mark bourbon, but the stuffing was still delish! The sausage smelled heavenly as we were browning it, and it is somewhat of a miracle that any was left for the stuffing, since we all found the need to taste it, and taste it several times as a quality check. (That's our story, and we're sticking to it!) We halved the recipe for a 12-lb turkey; about half went into the bird, and the rest in a covered baking dish drizzled with 1 cup chicken stock. Next year, we will use chicken-apple sausage; other than that, we'll run the same gameplan as this year.

Have made this many times now. I use lean ground pork instead of pork tenderloin and fat. Same thing to me. I add more sage, pepper and salt but basically make as is. If you bake outside the turkey you need to add a bit of broth. I usually bake some in and out and then mix the two together. I have made it with 1/2 corn bread which definitely gives more flavour and texture but not a must.

1/3 of my bread was cornbread to add a bit more texture (used "Buttery Cornbread" recipe. Added prunes cut up in 1/4s, @ 1 1/2 c toasted walnuts, bourbon, and added chicken stock to moisten per others excellent suggestions. I did use the Jimmy Dean shortcut but wasn't pleased with the product overall (corn syrup and msg). Will try the pork according to recipe next time.

I have my Great Grandfather's recipe for his stuffing that is very similar. We just use breakfast sausage instead of making our own and we also add walnuts and cut up prunes. This is so good. We normally only have it for Thanksgiving but I like to brown boneless pork tenderloins and arrange them in a pan standing up alternating this stuffing inbetween the tenderloins and then baking it.

Great stuffing. I actually would add a little more apple, but whole family enjoyed tremendously. Not too mushy, not too dry... as in 3 bears lingo appeared "just right" to guests!

The flavor of this combination of ingredients was fabulous. However, I cooked this outsidet he turkey and it was very dry. I even added the cup of stock that someone recommended. I would make this again, but if I was baking it seperately in a casserole, I would add more liquid to the mixture.

This recipe will ensure that you are discussed in reverent, hushed tones every Thanksgiving for years to come. Perfect.

This was a delicious stuffing for Thanksgiving, but I made a few changes: I used a pkg of Jimmy Dean's sage sausage instead of the pork and pork fat. Used a bourbon rather than the Cognac and it was terrific. I also added some chopped prunes, which I think added a lot. Also, I like my dressing really moist, so I added a cup of chicken broth and it turned out perfect. I think this may just be the end of Grandma's old recipe that we have made forever. This one is just so much better!

I used sausage instead of pork tenderloin and pork fat. This was delicious. Cooked it outside of the turkey and poured turkey drippings over it about 3/4 way done. This recipe makes a lot of stuffing. I used 3/4 recipe. Next year, will use 1/2.

I used lean ground pork instead of grinding pork tenderloin and fat. I didn't have enough time to let it marinate overnight, but it was still delicious. Even our pickiest guests raved about it! It was the best stuffing I've ever had. Definitely worth the effort.

Making the sausage instead of buying it took no more than a few minutes using a meat grinder. The sausage however was somewhat bland when cooked, so I added Madeira and more thyme,sage and pepper to enhance the flavor of the sausage. Making sausage instead of buying it was far superior both in quality and texture. A huge family favorite!!!!

This is the only stuffing I make and have been making it for 20 years. It is lovely. Some modifications I do; 1) Like ssaltorelli, I use sage sausage instead of tenderloin, it costs less and tastes great. 2) I strain the juices from cooking the vegetables, apples, and sausage and use it for gravy (I prefer a moist vs. soggy stuffing). 3) I use tequila instead of cognac. I add the tequila prior to cooking in oven. Tequila enhances all the flavors without tasting like, well tequila. 4) I do add an egg with the mixture at the same time I add tequila. Anyway, this is a very flexible recipe and can be modified many ways. I have added pine nuts, used single malt scotch (that was great, but does give a stronger taste), and many other things.

This is a great recipe, however, you can save lots of time and effort by using a good prepackaged sage pork sausage instead of the pork tenderloin and all of the other herbs. It will turn out very moist and delicious. I've used this recipe for years to rave reviews.

My daughter is making her first big Thanksgiving this year. She asked me for my recipes.. low and behold I go in epicurious and find the wonderful recipe I have used since 1982 out of Bon Appetit magazine. You can't go wrong with this one always been a hit on my Thanksgiving table.

Classic and wonderful. If you enjoy the cooking prep , it's not too bad. For most, this could be ALOT of work. The outcome is terrific though.
