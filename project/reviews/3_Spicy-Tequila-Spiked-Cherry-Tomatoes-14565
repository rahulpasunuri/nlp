I used vodka and bloody mary mix instead of tomato juice & tequila. They were wonderful. I have been asked to make again for this weekend.

Very nice summer hors d'oeuvre. I also use these to garnish individual bowls of gazpacho.

These were Great! I did double the filling amounts- only changes I would make would be more jalapeno (depending on spiciness) and more salt. These were very pretty and different.

I'm so sad over these tomatoes. None of my guests liked them! I mean, they tasted fine, and looked really pretty, but I guess the concept just didn't go over. Too bad.

Look great, taste great. But if you want to fill the tomatoes up, double the amount of juice (and gelatine) to have enough of the filling for 35 tomatoes.
