Excellent and easy. Omitted the chips altogether and added goat cheese. Cheated and used Trader Joe's corn salsa on top. Moist and delicious.

My child is gluten sensitive so this is a great solution. I didn't have chili powder but substituted scallions and salsa and they were a big hit

This is one of the best burger recipes I have found. they have a smokey flavor and are just delicious. Everyone just loved them. I served them on toasted buns with a sauce I had made the day before, a black bean and avocado salsa. My husband said to be sure and save this recipe because he would like to have it again soon.

Delicious! I have made this many times and it is always a hit. A go to meal during the summer :).

I wanted to try something different from plain old turkey burger and this was a quick recipe with a unique flavor. I will definitely make it again.

These turkey burgers are O.K., but not great. I will, however, probably make them again because they are pretty healthy and easy to prepare. The cumin flavor was a little strong for us, so I'll probably cut back on it next time. I made my own salsa with our garden fresh corn and tomatoes. It went well with the burgers.

We really enjoyed these! Didn't make the Corn Salsa but topped with Pepper Jack, Salsa, Sour Cream and a sprig of fresh Cilantro. These will go into our burger rotation.

Love this recipe! Perfect for an easy weeknight meal. Simple, but complex flavor that is unusual for turkey burgers, which I often find bland. I usually add worcestershire sauce to the turkey mix and top the burgers with homemade guacamole in lieu of salsa.

Nice flavor. Easy weekday meal. A bit different from the norm, which is nice.

This is a great recipe. Instead of the salsa and corn, I used home made guacamole (from the mango pomegranate guacamole recipe on here) to top them as well as some shredded cheddar cheese. I used an egg like others recommended in the turkey mix. I also used tortillas to make turkey burger wraps. Very good! Next time I'll use maybe 3/4 or half the amount of chili powder recommended. That was a little overpowering and I didn't taste some of the other ingredients. Overall this is a nice alternative to your normal burger.

So, reduced the recipe since I only had 1/2 lb of meat and I subbed regular breadcrumbs for the chips, but otherwise made it as prescribed. The burgers were dry and disgusting. Maybe I cooked them too long or something. Probably would not try again, though.

Very good! Really good way to use turkey. I just made corn on the side because it was so fresh at the market.....salsa was a nice addition.

This is one of my favorite recipies. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a extremely tasty turkey burger!

DELISH -- and super easy. I topped mine with guacamole rather than making the corn salsa. I omitted the salt altogether as I felt the chips were salty enough.

Excellent! Tasty! Used only 1/2 of chili powder and it was perfect. Served with avocado, which was a nice complement.

I heeded suggestions and used pepperjack cheese and mexican blend cheese on the burgers. I also topped them with fresh avocado. I added black beans and corn to the salsa. -Don't make this plain.

Instead of the corn salsa I top the burgers with pepperjack cheese and guacamole and they are amazing! We make this recipe quite often.

YUMMY. I liked the crunchiness with the chips. Salsa was great. You don't really need to use a bun. Kid friendly.

My family and I loved this recipe. I served the burgers with Chi-Chi's Lime Salsa, white sweet corn kernals and sour cream. Also placed the burgers on top of a tiny bed of shredded lettuce. It was delicious. It makes me look forward to grilling again.

These were great! I added red onion, and used half dark turkey meat and half turkey breast. Doubled the recipe and shaped into turkey patties then froze 1/2 batch on waxed paper for later grilling. YUMMY

First time I used tortilla chips instead of bread crumbs as the adhesive for patties. Works well. Added a just a little Spanish smoked paprika left over from a Paella dish. Yummy!

What an amazing, simple way to prepare ground turkey. This is an extremely tasty recipe, especially topping the burgers with shredded Mexican cheese. The only thing I did differently was add another 1/3 cup corn and 1/2 cup black beans to the salsa to make it a more filling veggie side dish. YUMMY!

Delicious!!! We are definitely adding this recipe to our own recipes and will make again very soon. It is very simple and inexpensive. It's a good meal for the hot summer days.

we really like this a lot. i put an egg white in it and grill the corn before i put in the salsa. i also serve bunless but with a slice of extra sharp cheddar. the chips really add a nice, different flavor to the meat.

Try adding finely chopped red onion and some grated mozzarella cheese to the turkey instead of the egg -- Moister and more flavorful.

Rating: 4
I wanted to add more cilantro than the recipe called for but did not have any so threw in some lemongrass and onions - also added eggs per recommendation of others. Not dry at all. Incredible! My husband didn't think they would turn out good so made his own meat burgers- then ended up begging me to let him have one! I would make them for a casual barbecue anytime!

My guests and I thought these were great, and we didn't even serve it with the salsa, great flavor. Not dry at all, not sure where we went right, but they were very juicy. I will definitely make these again.

We didn't like these at all. They were very dry I can't understand all the raves. I am a gormet cook and I thought they were terrible, honestly.

My third time making this recipe. Consistently good, though slightly different every time, depending on the salsa. THough not haute cuisine, this is very easy to make, with minimal cooking/prep time. a beachtime staple from now on. defintitely worth trying.;

Quick and easy and a crowd pleaser (including those who typically do not care for TexMex flavors).

Thumbs up on this one. I did add an egg as others have suggested but I don't think it made the burgers any more moist. I just made sure not to over cook the burgers. I didn't have chili powder so I added a big shot of Sriracha. I also STRONGLY recommend serving the sauce from the Turkey Burgers With Chipolte-Chile Tartar Sauce recipe.

This was great! My first attempt at turkey burgers--I added one egg and increased the chili powder. Topped off with store bought black bean salsa and cheese-yum!

I also added the egg and oregano and they are the best turkey burgers I have ever eaten - moist and flavorful. I made he corn salsa but I cooked my corn first. I will be making this often for guests this summer.

I added 1 beaten egg and some oregano as suggested. The burger was marvelously moist and flavorful. I topped it with a slice of pepper jack cheese, lettuce and simple guacamole. No buns necessary - eat like steak. Very easy to make on the Forman Grill.

My husband really liked this! Great Tex-Mex flavor. I added just a small amount of chopped sweet onion. I think that helped with the problem of dryness other reviewers had. It was a great way to use up extra ingredients from making the layered enchilada casserole also on this site.

this was a good dinner. i skipped the corn salsa and bought organic bean and corn salsa to top off the burger, it was delicious. also following the suggestion of some other cooks i used avocado and wrapped the burger in tortilla. light and yummy.

I used ground chicken instead of turkey and did not add any egg. It was very moist and my husband who hates alternative burgers loved it. I added jalapenos to his.

Rating: 3
This was a really wonderful, light summer addition to our barbq. We served it with a slice of jalepeno Jack cheese melted over top with a spoonful of the tasty salsa...they looked so pretty being passed around. We added the egg recommended by other reviewers, and I would do it again that way. Yum!

This recipe is great. It even won over my red meat loving fiancee! I'd agree with the addition of one egg though. We made it without and thought it was tasty, but a bit dry.

My husband (who HATES ground turkey) and I both thought these were fantastic and really easy to make. The first time I made them I used chives instead of cilantro because that was all I had and they still tasted great. I did add an egg as a previous reviewer suggested and they were not dry at all. Definitely will make again for a BBQ -- much better than just regular burgers.

Yeah, this was good! I made one for myself and grilled it up on the ol' Foreman. Pretty tasty! I forgot to add salt, actually, but with the salsa and pepper jack, I hardly missed it.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed this! I didn't make the salsa, and I served it wrapped in a flour tortilla with avocado and some of that commercial chipotle mayo. I used half white and half dark turkey, and they weren't too dry. To wrap in the tortilla, place your patty and fixings on about the top third of an 8" flour tortilla. Fold the bottom up over the patty and then fold the two sides over, leaving the top open. Secure with a toothpick for serving, if desired.

I'd make this again but would add something to the burgers to give it a little moisture, like a beaten egg or something. The flavor was great, but the burgers were definitely a bit dry.

I've made this twice already to rave reviews. A great new twist on burgers. I serve it with warm tortillas, shredded cheese and salsa (skipped the corn salsa). Excellent.
