I used the dressing base with different toppings: pralines instead of hazelnuts, add crumbled bleu cheese. I have a seasoning mix called Spike and I use it to season all of my salad dressings. I also use half hazelnut oil and half olive oil. I still have two people begging me for the recipe!

Nice salad! I served it with the baked salmon with cranbery thyme crust from this site, and it was delicious. The sherry vinegar dressing was super good!

This is always a winner at our house - either just for us or for company. I'll make it with just spinach and skip all the other greens and it is just as good. Delicious!

This is such a wonderful salad. It not only has a great flavor but gathers the compliments and raves. Follow the recipe and you will not be disappointed unless you are a McFan.

I haven't made the recipe yet but just wanted to suggest that you look for sherry wine vinegar in a store that specializes in Mediterranean or Middle Eastern foods. I found it at Mediterranean Deli in Oklahoma City. It was not available in grocery stores. Try sherry wine vinegar (2 1/2 T) mixed with apricot jam (1 cup)and ground cumin (2 t) brushed on grilled baby back ribs. Delish!

Awesome recipe - everyone loved it. I doubled the vinagrette and doubled the cranberry mixture. I used cherry flavored crasins. Couldn't find sherry vinegar so I used three parts sherry to one part vinegar instead. The sweetness of the cranberry mixture beautifully balances the less sweet taste of the vinagrette.

The idea sounded good, but the execution wasn't anything impressive, especially considering the amount of work. Making it "as is" (except for the hazelnut oil, and substituting balsamic and red wine vinegars for sherry vinegar, which I couldn't find), I found that I didn't have enough dressing to fully flavor all 6 salads. I'd double the dressing in the future. I would also combine the cranberry-shallot mixture with the dressed greens in the serving bowl, rather than sprinkling them on top of each serving. The cooked cranberries were very flavorful but poorly distributed (sticky!). I don't see the point of toasting, skinning, and sauteeing the hazelnuts yourself; I tried a shortcut version with pre-salted and -roasted hazelnuts, which worked just fine. In the future, I'll probably just use those, along with dried cranberries and chopped shallots without cooking them first. Note to anyone else using vinegar substitutes: cook the shallots in red wine vinegar, since the balsamic turned too brown to see the cranberries. You can use balsamic in the vinaigrette, though. Unfortunately I got this backwards.

Love this recipe! Have made it when it when the recipe first came out. Forgot about it. Found it on Epicurious and made it again. A little time consuming for a salad but ohh so good!

This salad is absolutely delicious. My husband went wild for it. Given the dried cranberries, I think it would be an excellent salad for Thanksgiving.

RAVE reviews all around at a Christmas party dinner. Substituted walnut oil (used no olive oil) and walnuts and used bagged baby "spring mix" salad. Accidentally used cherry-flavored Craisins. I recommend doubling the amount of nuts and the amount of dressing. Everyone absolutely devoured it. I look forward to trying it with the hazelnut/hazelnut oil.

I made this salad for Thanksgiving, where it preceded the main course of Beef Wellington (individual), which is also available on Epicurious. It's a lovely salad....attractive, easy (everything can be done in advance!)and very flavorful. Everyone loved it! Incidentally, you can now purchase hazelnuts that are already skinned (yea!!!) so that saves time. I used a mesclun mix for the greens, and 100% hazelnut oil for the vinagrette...no olive oil. I figured if I was going to spend all that money for hazelnut oil, I might as well use it, since it doesn't keep a long time.

I've made this recipe repeatedly since it was first published but haven't made it for awhile. I lost my copy and was so pleased to find it again on Epicurious. It is a wonderful winter salad, especially with pork or salmon

This salad was delicious, but I couldn't find all the greens called for. I substituted mesclun and it was excellent. I made this for a Halloween dinner for friends, and everyone raved about it.

This is a wonderful tasting salad along with adding a beautiful color to the dish. I served this at a dinner party and my guest raved. When they ask for the recipe, you know they have enjoyed it.

I made this salad awhile back and couldn't find the issue in my basement catalog of Gourmet Magazines. I made it several times and it was a hit. I'm having my (visiting) sister-in-law and some of her local friends from the past over for dinner and want to serve this recipe because it will go with the grilled turkey dinner we're planning on serving this weekend. I was worried that I would never find the recipe (because I've misplaced the magazine) but then I thought of Epicurious and voila! Even after a year or so since having this salad, I know it will be delicious!
