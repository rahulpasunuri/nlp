Excellent! Made it as a side dish for a group of girlfriends - they loved it. Corn is not available yet and decided against the carrot; added baby red bliss, mushrooms,which along with the onions, I skewered for easier handling on the grill. The basting sauce would be great for chicken and shrimp also. Next time!!

Loved this...In addition to the vegetables called for I added Eggplant. I double the marinade and added much more asparagus. Didn't have troubles with the marinade. This is now my goto veggie marinade for grilling.

To keep marinade from separating heat ingredients gently just until the butter melts and take it off the heat (don't actually cook it)--marinade will not separate.

Loved the sauce for the vegetables. I added garlic, isn't everything better with garlic. Will double the recipe next time. I will try it on grilled shrimp.

I followed the directions of Chris from Toronto, Canada--I sauteed the shallots, etc. and then emulsified the sauce with the food processor. Result is a creamy marinade that does not separate so you get all the ingredients evenly distributed throughout the marinade (but I did not add the balsamic vinegar that Chris used)

a slight twist on this is an excellent marinadde and baste for grilled pork chops. Just omit butter, substitute garlic clove for shallot. I usually use red wine vinegar instead of lemon when using it for pork.

Quite a tasty combination this. I've used the sauce on roast vegetables since to good affect as well.

I've served this twice at small summer dinner parties and each time it earned rave reviews from our guests. I recommend not adding any salt or pepper at the end. The basting sauce contains enough complex flavors that you don't need the extra spices.

I have used this recipe for many years. I love it and plan to use it on things other than vegetables. Fresh squash and eggplant from teh garden and this sauce, it doesn't get much better.

I can't believe I haven't reviewed this yet--we use it all the time--with half the amount of butter and oil, it's perfect. Great on fish and chicken, too!

As several others mentioned, this is oily. Next time I will try to use less oil to the same amount of seasonings.

This has been a staple in my summertime entertaining repertoire for 10 years. To make it easy to prepare, I often just grill asparagus, red onion and red, orange and yellow bell peppers. Arranged on a platter, the colors of the presentation are gorgeous and the flavors are wonderful. Instead of using the reserve sauce for dipping (not necessary) I drizzle it over grilled sliced chicken breasts--a lovely summer dinner!

One the the best, easiest veggie dishes Ive ever tied! Made it for 4 construction workers as a side for steak. I didnt expect any comments, but they raved!

Very nice, simple recipe for vegetable basting sauce/dipping sauce. Shallots need to be chopped fine, or they will burn on the grill. Quartering zucchini + eggplant is the best way to grill these vegeables, and much easier to control on the grill.

I added yellow squash and messed up with my spices by adding tarragon instead of thyme. Otherwise I followed the recipe to a T. The spice confussion didn't really matter cause my guest as well as myself thought this to be a very good combination. Next time I will try the thyme :-) Most of all my guest said the dish was a fresh approach to grilled veggies and the flavor was fantastic!

We had a memorial day grilling party and this recipe was outstanding on the grilled corn. Would have marinaded the corn longer if I had know how subtle the flavor was and how well it pared with the sweet corn. We used the Portobello "Steak" Sandwiches with Gorgonzola Butter and Red Pepper Vinaigrette (on this site) for the grilled mushrooms (pass on the sandwich part) and Grilled Baby Artichokes with Olive oil and Lemon more excellent grilled vegetables. On the artichokes, follow the reviewers, the recomendations are for the first review given, not the one presented by epicurious.

What a wonderful and delicious recipe! My wife was unsure of the sauce, until she tried it on the finished product. We made twice as much sauce for extra sloppy basting while grilling. I agree with the other reviewers who say that the sauce isn't for dipping, it's for marinateing and grilling. Very little is left on the food, except bits of thyme and heaps of flavor. We also used pecan wood with charcoal for extra smokey flavor.

The only thing I would change would be to put the carrots on the grill with the first batch. Very good.

This is one of my all time favorite recipes. To make it more portable (like to grill at a friend's or take for a camping trip), I prepare the marinade and put it in one gallon freezer bags. You can put the veggies in the bag and just shake them to cover them well. You can actually do this in advance and let the marinade get cold. It sticks to the vegetables when it's cold, but melts again when you put it on the grill.

Nice idea with the dijon flavors, but does come out a little oily--needs to be served HOTto keep from thickening. After grilling one last basting, cover and steam in the oven. I might try a variation next time without so much oil.

Rating: 4
Wow! I was a little skeptical when choosing this recipe due to the negative reviews but again....WOW!! Yes the sauce the separates but that is only a concern if you use it as a dipping sauce. We did not. The vegetables soaked up the flavour of the sauce on the grill and didn't require the additional dip. The corn was the best. As a matter of fact, I am making this sauce now just for corn!

I did not do the veggies but wanted this for a sauce for my swordfish. It was excellent.

I agree with previous reviewer; as written it is greasy and separates. Use either some butter or some olive oil; balsamic vinegar is a nice sub for lemon. Just use it while grilling and serve veggies alone without "dipping sauce"

Rating: 1
I'm so disappointed after all the rave reviews. This basting sauce didn't add much (think lemon mayonnaise). It was also very oily (even though i cut down on the butter and oil, as another reviewer recommended), and didn't look very appealing as a dipping sauce, especially with the oil separating. We brushed some veggies with just olive oil to compare and they tasted just as good.

Served with a grilled meat this dish is wonderful for dinner parties - no pans to clean up and if there are any vegetarians in your group they're sure to get plenty. The sauce is yummy!!!

This was delicious! Varied the sauce by halving the butter, adding a little extra olive oil and a little white wine, 1 T honey (which I found smooths out the flavor a little -- doesn't make it sweet at all), half fresh thyme/half fresh oregano. Added yellow squash, which was tastier than the zuchinni. Cut the onion in 4 large rounds, then skewered the rounds "horizontally" through each layer, turning them with a spatula -- easier to grill than wedges. Also grilled some large, shelled shrimp (15-count size) basted with this sauce, served all with wild rice pilaf. Chopped up the leftovers and made "rice bowls" for lunch the next day -- excellent!

Don't worry about the rest of your menu, guests will only remember the veges! The fresh thyme with the rest of the ingredients was fantastic. My husband, who doesn't like corn, couldn't stop eating it. This is most definitely a keeper!

Great grilled vegtables recipe. You can add or subtract from their suggested list of vegtables, the sauce is great.

Everyone loves this dish. I simplified it by tossing the vegetables with the sauce in a large bowl and transfering them to a grill basket for cooking, tossing them occassionally while grilling. Worked Perfectly. Also added tiny red potatoes (parboiled) and broccoli. Any combination is excellent.

This recipe is now a staple for our summer cooking. It gives regular BBQs a tasty flair and everyone loves it. Try different combinations of veggies, but makes sure to include the corn.

Absolutely wonderful. I doubled the sauce and poured the extra portion on the veges while they were in the oven keeping warm. It's fun to make too!

Rating: 3
This was great. I cut the butter in half and added about 1/2 cup of white wine to the basting sauce. I put all the veggies in a big bowl and added 1/2 of the sauce. I then marinated the veggies for about 3 hours, then grilled them over coals. I used the remaining sauce for basting. Despite the various types of veggies, everything cooked fine. Mushrooms are a great addition to this.

So many wonderful reviews, I carefully prepared the basting sauce (1/2 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup butter) with bated breath. I had to take the pan off the heat and whisk like mad, because the Dijon curdled. The shallots remained firm and never released their delicious flavor. Next time I made my own version with less trauma. In a microwaveable cup, saute 1/3 cup shallots in 1 Tbsp butter until softened. Add half cup chicken or vegetable broth. Bring to a boil. Add 2 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp butter, diced. Let cool while you chop 2 Tbsp fresh thyme in food processor (any fresh herbs work). Add 3 Tbsp Dijon mustard,1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar and 1 Tbsp fresh lemon juice to chopped thyme in food processor bowl. With motor running, through feed tube of processor, SLOWLY pour broth mixture - as if you are making hollandaise sauce - and continue processing until broth and oil are emulsified. Add lemon peel and season to taste. Brush veggies with mixture at least ten minutes before barbecuing. Delicious and much more foolproof!!

This is an absolutely incredible dish. I made the corn, asparagus and peppers - it was wonderful. I also cut down on the fat, I used about 1/2 tblsp butter and 1/2 cup vegetable broth and thickened it slightly with a tiny bit of flour so it would stick to the veggies better. What a hit, next time I'll try the red potatoes as another reviewer did. Definitely a must try - and so easy!!

I thought the basting sauce was absolutely delicious, but the veggies just didn't absorb enough of the flavor. Next time I will try doubling the sauce and perhaps marinating the veggies for a while.

Made this great sauce exactly as instructed and it was wonderful. Would double the sauce next time so as there would be more for dipping. Grilled the vegetables so they were still crunchy; then put them in the oven for about ten minutes at 350 degrees with the remainder of the sauce on them. That's why I'd double the sauce next time. Try this; it's terrific.

Used a bit less butter and a bit more olive oil, as several suggested. I would make at least 50% more, as we like to dip a lot!!!

I have done this recipe about a half-dozen times and it is an absolute hit at every barbeque. I usually at least double the recipe. I like to grill red potatoes, red onions, asparagus, and corn. Sometimes carrots. I like the idea of smoked sausages with this recipe. You HAVE to try this one. It is so simple to do.

Wow! This is great! The mustard basting sauce adds an extra kick, while grilling these veggies makes for a smokey, char-like flavor. Very tastey! I, too, recommend replacing some of the olive oil with chicken broth. I made these with with spice-flavored smoked sausages - grill them right alongside the veggies! Great to eat during summer or winter! I'll be making this again very soon.

This is a great great recipe. I was so glad to be reminded of it again on the web. I cooked this often in 1996 and 1997 and kinda forgot about it. Not anymore, it's up front and ready as soon as the garden is in season. In fact I blow extra monies to do it off season. Keep up the good work!!

I have made this recipe many, many times since I first tried it in 1996. I just gave it away to the gourmet cooks in the office to try this summer. I lost the recipe sometime during the winter and I am grateful to find it again on the website.

The flavors in the basting sauce are delicious with all of the vegetables, but I think the huge amount of fat added is totally unnecessary. I tried it this way: Saute the shallots in just 1 or 2 tablespoons butter until golden. Add 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth and the rest of sauce ingredients, skipping the rest of the butter and the olive oil. I serve the grilled vegetables over rice for a great, light meal. Cooking the vegetables inside on a broiling pan also works in a pinch. You can also use rosemary instead of thyme, or do it without herbs--it's still very tasty.

I cut the fat by using just 2 Tsb of buttter and 2 Tbs of Olive oil, and substituting chicken stock. It came out great, and I have to say that the corn was incredible.

I love the way the vegetables turned out in this recipe and the corn was out of this world! I'll never eat corn "boiled" again, it was delicious this way without the husk on, you don't even need to add salt or butter to it once you eat it.

I've made this recipe for years and always to rave reviews. Lovely zestiness from the lemon and the thyme brings out the flavor in the vegies. As a matter of fact, I'm printing out several copies for friends who keep hounding me for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! We couldn't stop eating! I did have some trouble with the onions falling apart. I would solve this by skewering them or pinning with toothpicks the next time I grill. Yellow squash prepared as the zucchini is wonderful. I also added about 1/4 tsp dried dill week to the basting sauce. Wonderful!!!!!
