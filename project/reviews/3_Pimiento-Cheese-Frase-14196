This is a great recipe for pimiento cheese - I made a batch for a tennis match and it disappeared quickly with many compliments! I made a few adjustments to the recipe: toasted the pecans on the stovetop (no need for oven), used 8 oz whipped cream cheese w/roasted garlic, used 3 T of plain yogurt instead of mayo, added some cayenne pepper. I wouldn't recommend using a food processor, this mixes easily by hand and has a better consistency.
