I have made this a few of times. It is not an overly sweet dessert, and is delicious served warm with some freshly whipped cream. I love the cornbread flavor of the cake.

I made this in a cast-iron skillet with twice as much butter and cooked the peaches twice as long - they didn't stick at all and caramelized beautifully. I could have used twice the amount of actual cake though - I may make it again and double the batter part.

My boyfriend claimed to hate peaches before I made this... that says a LOT as he is a very picky eater. He said it was one of the best things he has ever eaten. Also, a few notes, I was out of brown sugar, so I subbed turbinado and it turned out GREAT! I also skipped the pureed peaches because I was simply too lazy to dirty another implement. I served it with vanilla frozen yogurt and it was amazing!

People were impressed and the cake went in 2 days. However, I will not make this again. Was looking for more of a crunch in the carmelized cake bottom and this was almost soggy. Nice flavor with the fresh peaches, however.

I made this as a cake in a 9x13 pan. I made the caramel separately and coated the bottomof the pan adding the peaches, I used five sliced peaches. Topped with the cake and baked for 45 minutes. IServed slightly warm will make again perhaps with a different fruit.

I accidently let the caramel cook too long, and it went from golden to dark brown. I used it, remelting the caramel that had hardened. It was wonderful! The dark caramel gave the peaches a deep rich depth and a sophisticated note. Isn't it nice when mistakes turn out well?

Disappointed in how this turned out...the peaches on the bottom were a bit too liquidy and the cake part on top wasn't anything spectacular.

this was much easier than i had expected & ended up being very good. very moist & not overly sweet. i agree that ice cream (especially vanilla) compliments this very well.

Everyone enjoyed the cakes, and I had no trouble removing them from the pan.

I made it in a loaf pan to save time. I also added a 1/4 cup of peach brandy to the pan as the peaches were browning. I've made that cakie crust before and I really like it.

Not what I expected. I thought the peaches would be more carmelized and maybe crunchy. Not at all. Everything was soft. The cake had nice flavor. Don't serve with a chocolate ice cream, peach and chocolate don't really go together.

Very peachy from the pureed peaches in the batter. Looked lovely - instructions were helpful when followed precisely. Was glad I served it with ice cream - had some vanilla/black walnut that added a nice flavor compliment. It needed something alongside. Will make again.

What a wonderful recipe that I'll certainly make again. The flavor is carried primarily by the peaches so the more ripe and flavorful the peaches, the better the end result. Tried to find Bryer's peach ice cream to serve it with but settled on vanilla.

Yummy! It smelled so good! Very easy, but wear an apron...the cooked peaches can splatter!! Great for fresh peaches....give it a try!

The caramelized peaches were delicious, and the pureed peaches added flavor to the cake, but it was still a little bland. Would be better if served at breakfast or at a brunch, or as part of a buffet, than as a stand alone dessert.
