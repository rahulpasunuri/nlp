This is a very adaptable recipe. In order to keep the crust from getting soggy, use a mandoline to cut the tomatoes and remove the extra moisture by pressing them between paper towels. I also carmelized 2 vidalia onions instead of raw. Remainder of recipe as is, and turns out great! I had a recipe very similar to this years ago that used gorgonzola instead of the mozzarella/parm cheese and it was wonderful as I recall. May try that next time.

Simply delicious and quick. I used 6 layers of phyllo dough instead of 8 which worked out perfectly. I would also recommend using an oil mister to avoid it from getting to oily. Overall it was excellent. This one was a major hit at my party.

This is a summer fave. We really watch fats, so we use a mister & spray olive oil instead of butter to the pan and between the layers. Works perfectly, and tastes wonderful. Not at all greasy, just the taste of summer fresh tomatoes and herbs from the garden, accented with quality cheeses. YUM!

So delicious--my husband and I ate it all for dinner. If you use fresh mozzarella, it turns out a little soupy and needs more salt. I'd use the polly-o kind next time, actually.

This recipe was easy and delicious. For half of the pizza I put tomato sauce and cheese for the kids. Everyone who had it loved it.

This is a favorite appetizer recipe in my home, especially in summer. I like to add fresh shrimp. Always a big hit!

I would give this nearly 3 forks. It was very easy. In fact I assembled it earlier in the day, covered with plastic wrap and put it in the refrigerator. Baked it just before serving. I tried it using the new country style frozen phyllo dough. I think I would have preferred it with the regular, thinner frozen phyllo dough.

Very good! I happen to find all the ingredients in my kitchen and served it for dinner. Definately agree with other posters high quality cheeses would make it even better. I plan on serving this as an appetizer at my next Super Bowl party.

My family loves this, and it is easy. One key is using fresh tomatoes; another is slicing the onions very thinly, as one other reviewer suggested. I did not use all of the butter - maybe 2/3 of it; brush each phyllo sheet just enough to get it dampened, not saturated. And for anyone a little nervous about phyllo: don't be! A friend from Greece once gave me great advice: the sheets do not have to be in one piece, just patchwork them together (with some small amount of overlay and butter); it is very forgiving. This dish is great at room temperature or just from the oven. I use it as an entree with a salad, but think that using it as an appetizer is also a great idea.

Excellent!Used roma tomatoes and vidalia onion,freshly grated parmesan.Wonderful!!

Great appetizer for pot luck parties--everyone loved it. I used all the butter that was called for, and it was too oily for me, although there wasn't a crumb left. Next time I will use less butter

I served these as appetizers - cut them into triangles and served them on a pizza peel. They were a hit. Glad I doubled the recipe. I used fresh mozzarella, red onion and added fresh basil. This recipe is a keeper and could easily be adapted - I'm thinking a greek style pizza next time...

This is easy and fantastic! A jellyroll pan is the perfect size. Definitely use fresh mozzarella, fresh oregano and fresh thyme. Don't bother to seed the tomatoes. I subbed red onion and added a little chopped basil and minced garlic. Cut into small squares and served as a light appetizer. Looked gorgeous, tasted delish!

just didn't work for me--I didn't care for the crust--too oily and the top didn't seem to blend well togather.

Delicious, I added fresh chopped garlic. It would make a nice appetizer, cut up in small strips.

Super easy and so yummy! I've made this twice and I think it was best when I used really high quality organic cheese. It seemed to make a big difference in the flavor. Everyone loves it!

Made this this weekend at a cooking class. First experience with phyllo. Though butter is your friend when working with phyllo, don't use too much or it will get oily. I don't think we used what the recipe called for. So many possibilites for toppings too. Big hit at the cooking class too. It was super easy and to tasty.

I was happy to make this dish after seeing all the good reviews, but was still skeptical about how tasty it would be. Boy was I surprised. It was fabulous! My guests raved about it while I was grinning inside about it's ease. I used a rectangular cookie sheet, which worked just fine. The phyllo hung over the edge and burnt so I just flaked it off when it cooked and it left me with a perfect pie. I also was extra lazy and bought a container of pre-chopped onions - so it was really no work at all. I am going to make this a regular dinner with a nice caesar salad.

3 1/2 stars on taste, an extra 1/2 star for ease. I can't wait to go crazy trying other toppings! A very easy, attractive, great tasting, versatile dish.

Delicious! Very quick and easy. You definately need to sprinkle the parmesan between the sheets as that is what holds the flakes together. Very tasty, would be wonderful with a salad.

This was a big hit with my guests. Everyone went back for seconds. I used a vegetable peeler on the onion, the slices came out nice and thin. I have made it twice and will definitely make it again.

I made this for a casual potluck finger food party. It was such a hit. I now make it all the time when iam askedto bring appetizers, or when I am entertaining at my house. It is simple, and fun to assemble. I have never had leftovers. It is a bit pricey, but worth it!

Great, but demands the best possible ingredients. I must have used three times the suggested amount of parmesan. One tbls per sheet of phyllo does not go far.

A great light dinner recipe. My family is very picky but they loved it.

I made this for the Super Bowl, along with some wings, guacamole, and broiled shrimp, and this was the star. I found it really easy to make (I love phyllo dough!), I didn't use all of the butter but you can't totally skimp. I love the way the onions almost melt away. Slice them thin! Will definitely make again.

Hi , from coastal B.C. !! Just about every time we are invited out to a casual " pot luck " , I make this . It's quick and easy , looks great , tastes even better . Clean up is a snap too . It works fine hot or cold !!!

Very tasty (and not time consuming at all). I'm not a fan of tomato sauce so finding a pizza without was great. I went light on the butter as suggested, used light mozzarella (which is a little less greasy) and found it just right... crispy and delicious. My 3 year old (who initially sat down and said "ewww") even had seconds.

This was really good to eat, although it is a little time consuming to make. I also thought it came out a little too greasy - maybe it's possible to use less butter because the cheese gets oily too. My guests loved it!!
