I brine a whole chicken and put it on my rotisserie grill. I haven't bought a roast chicken from the grocery deli since I found this recipe. You can add other herbs and spices to the garlic and onion as you choose (bay leaves or oregano are good). I would give this a five star rating if I could.

i have been using this recipie since 2005 exactly as written & it is alway the favorite at every party. i often make it a day ahead & reheat under broiler to crisp up and it's fantastic.

Great flavor, However I didn't use as much water as the recipe called for, and I should have rinsed the chicken before dredging it, as it came out a little too salty.

Made this for family dinner. We all loved it and couldn't stop munching on it! The only change I made was putting some cayenne pepper in the flour instead of the black pepper.

The perfect brine for roasted chicken and turkey breast. Brine the poultry overnight, and count on an extra 30+ minutes roasting time for a whole chicken. This works particularly well with free range chickens allowing the meatier legs and thighs to cook at the same time as the breast. Incredibly delicious and easy!

I didn't feel like frying chicken so I roasted a bunch of chicken legs and they were fantastic! I will use this recipe again.

Deeelicious chicken! I made only with 10 drumsticks so next time I will make with only maybe 1/2 to 1 T of salt and put salt in the flour mix like recipe called for. But recipe is definitely a keeper!

I brined a whole chicken and roasted it in the oven. Best roasted chicken I've ever had. Going to grill it next time.

I won't be buying fried chicken from the "colonel" anymore! This recipe was a snap to throw together, contained ingredients found in my pantry and most importantly was DELICIOUS! I did remove the skin from the chicken pieces before breading/frying and it was very moist and juicy with a great crunch. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this chicken for my husband's birthday party and it was a big hit. Everyone said it was wonderful. This recipe is a keeper for my family. I followed the recipe as written and didn't change anything.

To the cook from LA: the recipe is for 8 breasts, 8 thighs and 8 wings -- a total of 24 pieces.

10 cups of flour? Isn't that a little much for 8 chicken breasts?

Yummy! Juicy & tasty chicken with a good garlic flavor. I did not find the flavors to be overwhelming at all.I used vegetable shortening instead of oil -- I just think shortening works better for fried chicken.

Substituted water with white vinegar in the marinade for a more tangy flavor; the chicken was wonderful.

The reason for all the salt is that the "marinade" is a BRINE, not a marinade. That being said, this is a TERRIFIC recipe (tho' I still believe chicken destined for frying needs to spend some time in buttermilk).

Delicious dish, and so easy to make! I do feel that the reicipe asked for a little much salt, though. Next time, I will add less to the marinade. Loved it!
