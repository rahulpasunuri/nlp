This is outstanding. I went looking for some way to use a box of pears from Costco that were ripening too fast on the counter - and found this recipe. Simply great - so great my wife called a friend and insisted that we take her a piece to share the result. Wonderful.

I really liked the combination of flavors (pear and grappa) but made three other cakes this weekend from epicurious that were better.

Like some other reviewers, I was trying to re-create a dessert I'd had at Al Covo in Venice. This was very close and very good. I did use three pears instead of one and substituted blueberries for the raisins. I also mixed some brown sugar, white sugar and cinnamon and sprinkled it one top to give a slight crunch to the top of the cake.

I thought this was quite an interesting combination of cake and fruit. It is very rich and could easily serve 12 people. Noting the other reviews, I used 3 pears. I ended up using Luxardo cherry liqueur instead of grappa because I had some around the house and dried cherries instead of raisins/prunes for the same reason. I used a 9 inch springform pan because that's what I have. It did take much longer to bake than the time given in the recipe, perhaps an hour and twenty minutes total. I wonder if the extra time is due to the 3 pears instead of one pear? It is a bit difficult to test because my toothpick kept sticking into pears insead of cake. Worth making again though perhaps with other fruits.

Excellent. Used 3 pears---glad I read the reviews, only 1 would have not been good. Rum instead of grappa, and the smaller amount of sugar, and used whole wheat pastry flour. I made this for Christmas Eve dinner, without the sauce, and served it with rum-flavored whipped cream. Everyone loved it. I think the sauce would have been too rich in this season where all the meals are sooo rich.

Didn't make the grappa sauce, but the cake was delicious. Definitely use 3 pears (all I had were two Bartletts), and cut them into larger chunks. I added toasted pinolis and prunes, which were great. (If you can find Agen prunes from France they're totally worth it.) Also, I used brandy instead of grappa, and it was fine. Note: my cooking time was 20+ minutes beyond the time in the recipe, even with a slightly larger pan. (Could be my pears were too juicy and added a lot of liquid.)

Superb. I adhered to the recipe with the exception of the following two changes: I used three pears (not one), heeding the advice of other reviewers who noted that there's a mistake in the online recipe. Also, I cut the sugar down to 1 cup, which resulted in a more mildly sweet cake.

Wow - wish I had read the reviews first to know that I should have used 3 pears, not 1. Still, it was very good. Does anyone have the recipe for the chocolate cake from Al Covo? I swear it was the best chocolate cake I have ever had.

We first had this cake in Venice at Al Covo. It was so incredible we asked for the recipe. They told us we could find it in Gormet. Blueberries were in season at the time so they used those instead of raisins. I've made it many times and I always use blueberries. It's a great cake to make for company. Everyone loves it.

This is an incredible cake and very easy to make! I have already made it six times. My Italian friends loved it and I had to translate the recipe back into Italian for them.

I love this cake! I baked it in an 8" springform and was not done after 50 minutes, so I covered the pan with foil and stuck it back in the oven for another 20 minutes. Came out perfect! I added 1/2 cup of both golden raisins and dried cherries and substituted macadamia nuts for the pine nuts. Ginger would be good in this cake as would rum or brandy.

My oven went out off before the cake was completely cooked, and it saged in the center. My dinner party was minus this cake, but my family loved it...even my mistake. I would suggest you try it.

I haven't yet made this cake, but I did have a HUGE piece of it at Al Covo in Venice a few weeks ago! The co-owner/cake-maker told me to look for this recipe online, and I'm so excited to have found it -- I'm sure it will be wonderful, but not as great as the real one in Venice!!!

This cake is absolutely delicious!!! I substituted 1/2 tsp of cardamom powder instead of cinnamon, and used dried cherries and rasins. The combination of flavors was incredible. This cake is very easy to make too! YUMMY!!!

This is just delicious. It made a very light, flavorful cake that is just lovely with the sauce. I appreciate the information about the pears; 3 made for a very tasty and moist cake. I happen to like grappa and always have it around. But the success of the dish certainly does not depend on it. Any favorite spirit could be substituted or none at all if you prefer. I used currants and I like the addition of the pine nuts. But I am intrigued by the alternative of dried cherries. I may try that the next time I make this.

This cake is fabulous. I've made it twice now, and I highly recommend using dried cherries in place of raisins. Also, make sure the pear chunks are hearty; makes a much more flavorful and moister cake than if the pears are diced to small. Both times, I've skipped the pine nuts. The next day, after an overnight of refrigeration, we ate the cake with cold sauce rather than warming it up. EVEN BETTER!!!

I like this cake very much. I altered the recipe using what I had on hand and it still came out well. I used three pears instead of one as the other reviewer advised. Bartletts instead of Bose. I substituted Jack Daniel's for grappa and turbinado sugar instead of white. Although it sounds wonderful I skipped the grappa sauce for a lighter cake. This one will stay in my recipe box.

OHMYGOSH--this cake is yummy. It will serve 10 easily as it is dense and moist. I used currants instead of raisins or prunes. I bought the Grappa for $31.00 and now wonder what to do with the rest! The sauce took about 10 minutes to come up to temp but we are at high altitude. This was a wonderful finale to my Easter brunch.

I made a variation on this cake which was absolutely WONDERFUL! I substituted sun-dried cherries for the raisins/prunes. The sauce was delicious! I had trouble finding grappa, and didn't want to purchase a whole bottle for just one tablespoon in the recipe, so I just used brandy.

This recipe is delicious, although please note that the recipe on the internet has the wrong quantity of pears. The recipe as printed in the magazine has 3 Bosc pears, not one. I used 3 pears and also used prunes instead of raisins. I made the recipe for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. The grappa sauce is a bit heavy, and I will substitute a hard sauce using grappa next time.

An amazing recipe, has long been my favorite cake. I sometimes make it without the grappa sauce and serve for pitch-in brunches and get many requests for the recipe. Just wonderful using chopped canned pears, as well.

I completed an Italian dinner with this wonderful cake and got raves from everyone. Delicious!
