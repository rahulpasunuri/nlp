The fritter recipe is the same one that's in the old Williams-Sonoma Seasons cookbook. It is fantastic. I've even made it with jarred artichokes in a pinch. Never made the dip, just served with lemon and parsley.

The batter was great. The sauce however needs a lot of work.

This takes a bit of prep, but it's well worth it. I ended up adding water to the batter because it was so thick, but they turned out light and delicious. I didn't make the sauce, but served them like I'd had them in Italy, with a sprinkling of kosher salt, a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and some fresh chopped flat-leaf parsley.
