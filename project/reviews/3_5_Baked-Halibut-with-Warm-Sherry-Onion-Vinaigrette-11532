This was a very interesting sauce for the fish. I definitely felt that it had a Spanish feeling to it, what with the red bell peppers and sherry vinegar. Went nicely with mahi-mahi. Although this wasn't my favorite sauce as a fish accompaniment, it was a nice change from the usual lemon/white wine/capers sauce.

Served this at dinner party to absolute raves. You can make the vinagarete prior and just add fish liquids at end. Recipe does not say when to add olives so I added after incoporating everything.

Very delicious! I made twice as much vinagrette and it was all gone before I have even realized. I cut cooking time for vinagrette almost twice as well. It turned out perfectly. Will make this again. Another option for a side - mashed root vegetables.

This deserves a much better rating than the present 91%. Complex, interesting flavors against fish without a lot of personality. HOWEVER, I do wish that the site would add into the method when to add the chopped olives mentioned in the list of ingredients. (With the add.of parsley). Making the vinaigrette the day ahead only adds to the development of the flavor.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. Make sure you get good quality fish, however.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish well enough, but there are so many other excellent haddock/seafood recipes out there that are just as good, if not better, and that require much less effort, that I wouldn't make this one again. As the recipe shows, the cook needs to be in watchful attendance for at least 32 minutes after he/she does all the preliminary chopping, just to add all these different vegetables at various time interludes and to stir them when required. This recipe does not lend itself to last-minute cooking. Make the vinaigrette only if you do most of it ahead of time and then reheat it while the haddock is baking if you intend to spend any time with your guests or family.

This was so not worth the effort. If you don't mind extensive prep work for a mediocre meal, go for it. Otherwise, skip it.

Outstanding and fun & easy to make. I didn't use the olives and the flavors were complex and wonderful without them. I used dry sherry in place of white wine and it was great. We will be making this again and again!

The wax paper really keeps the halibut moist. The vinaigrette is perfect for the fish. This is the first time I really enjoyed eating halibut.

Great combination of flavors. I decided to make some shortcuts for speed as well as to minimize cleanup. First, however, I cut the oil way down (maybe to about a tablespoon!). After setting aside the vinaigrette, I just added a little more oil (1/2 Tb) to the same pan for 5 min., flipped it over, threw in about half a bag of spinach, added the reserved vinaigrette and about a tablespoon of water and splash of wine (no clam juice), lowered the heat (covered) and cooked for maybe another 2 minutes. Set aside another 2 minutes off-heat to finish cooking and meld flavors. It was really great - moist and delicious. The spinach added a nice color contrast as well as moisture. Kalamata olives are great but optional. Have tried this dish with halibut (god) as well as hawaiian opah (better). Served with plain white rice to catch all the juices. Was still good reheated for lunch (unusual for fish!). Try it - it's much easier than it seems.

The fish is wonderul and very moist with this recipe. My husband wasn't thrilled about halibut until he had this dish, and he loved it. We had halibut at a restaurant several days after I prepared this dish and it didn't come close to the great taste of this recipe.

We liked this recipe, but it definitely needs to be tweaked. I would absolutely, positively double the vinaigrette as another reviewer suggested -- it definitely needed more sauce. As noted by other reviewers the recipe doesn't say when to add the olives. It also doesn't say when to add the minced thyme -- I added them both when I added the parsley and I believe that was the right place and timing for them. I, too, wouldn't strain the cooking liquid in this recipe, the vinaigrette already has texture so the slight amount that comes from the cooking liquid only adds to the recipe (if you increase the amount of vinaigrette, you'll have to increase the cooking liquid proportionately). Also I didn't cut the halibut "crosswise" as suggested, so by the time the halibut was done I think my husband could have eaten his shoe and been as equally satisfied. This was a delicious recipe, but I would only make it again with these changes.

This dish is actually very quick and simple to make and looks and tastes completely gourmet. It is our favorite way to cook halibut. The clam juice ensures moist, delicious, flavorful fish and the sauce it great. Make it, you won't be sorry!

my family and I loved this dish; but I felt the need to increase the vinegar a bit. the directions don't say when to use the olives so I added them to the vinaigrette. my son said it was the best fish he'd eaten in a long time

Great dish. Sauce definitely makes the fish. The recipe doesn't show when to use olives!

Great recipe!! In the future I would double the vinaigarette as it was very yummy and my guests wanted more.

I made this dish using halibut steaks instead of fillets and it was amazing. I tripled the poaching liquid and it was very moist. I didn't strain the vinagrette because I liked the texture.

Perfect! But watch cooking time...I overdid mine by about two minutes, which is critical in fish. The vinaigrette saved it. Sauce can be made well ahead of time so it is a great party dish.

Unbelievable recipe. I left out the peppers since I hate them and I think I used only half of the olive oil and the vinaigrette was still to die for! A great way to make halibut, too, as it came out very moist. My kids were begging for seconds (I didn't put the vinaigrette on theirs, however). I will be making this all the time!

This dish has been such a hit with friends that we've made it repeatedly. The sauce makes this dish a complete success. Nothing to change.

The baking time, often a chancy thing with fish, was perfect here. Can anyone tell me when to add the olives?

Recommend doubling the olives. Good accompaniments: garlic mashed potatoes and green beens with toasted almonds

Very good! We grilled the Halibut with a light sprinkling of mesquite chips over the coals. I plated the Halibut surrounded with steamed sugar snappers and used the vinaigrette on all. Sherry vinegar has a great taste.

I have made this dish several times. It's always a winner. The sherry vinegar has such a distinct flavour. It's just delicious. You can't get Halibut in Australia, so I have used different types of firm white fish and all work fine. GREAT RECIPE!

I made this recipe for a Valentine's Day Dinner and it was absolutely wonderful! I did, however, use sea bass instead of halibut since it looked better at the fishmonger's. I also didn't have sherry vinegar so I simply used balsamic. I made the vinaigrette early in the day and it kept until I was ready with the fish. I also didn't bother straining it and my husband particularly liked the texture. I'm serving it to my mother on Mother's Day!

I loved this and it was very easy. I used about 15 olives and a whole red pepper and didn't have the parsley. I also used a lot more wine and stock with the fish because I had a 5 lb peice of Halibut that needed longer to cook and I did'nt want it to dry out.
