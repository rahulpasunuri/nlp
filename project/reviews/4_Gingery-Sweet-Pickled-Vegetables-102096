Hi there fellow picklers! YES YES YES you can use regular salt in this recipe. I didn't have pickling salt, phwwww, who cares, use table salt. These pickles were FANTASTIC, delish with every meal, from sandwiches, to curried rice, to breakfast fare. They did not last long in the fridge. Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

Fabulous! I cut the sugar in half and was very generous with the ginger.

Very easy to make and pretty if you use a variety of colored veggies. The guests were all adults, so I used pepper flakes, used about 1/3 cup less sugar, used red onion but cut back the amount and grated some of the ginger to give it more zing. Served after 5 days in the fridge and everyone loved it.

Yum! Perfect way to use some of the MANY cucumbers in my refrigerator. I was quite true to the recipe, but I think I would add less onion next time...it seemed to overwhelm the rest of the pickles a bit (maybe add only 2/3 or 1/2).

this is a delicious and EASY recipe with GREAT results. all that I've had try my pickles love them! a super great side dish to any summer dinner! I use pepper flakes instead of the dried chili and they work very well. the subtle ginger flavor is phenomenal!

I made these pickles about 8 months ago from mostly vegies grown in my garden. I used carrots, sweet peppers, miniature corn, cuke, onion and of course ginger (didn't grow the ginger or cuke). They are excellent, in fact I think that they have improved with age. I will make these again.

Very easy and oh, so pretty! I added cauliflower *after* the liquid cooled (well, actually, I also added the cauliflower before it cooled, but had to remove it all because it cooked down and looked icky!). Not knowing *what* kind of dried pepper to get, I added maybe 2 tsp. red pepper flakes, but it was not enough to give a bite. Will now add some to one of the jars.

This is a great recipe for your summer vegetables! I left out the red pepper, since I don't care for them. You could substitute vegetables such as cauliflower as well. The ginger adds such a great flavor to the pickles.

This is a major winner. It will be gone long before its 2 month shelf life. I used more light brown sugar than white and used a common wild vegetable (poke) instead of cukes.
