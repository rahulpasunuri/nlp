A delicious, moist turkey meatloaf with a lot of flavor. I might be inclined to add additional bread crumbs to help the meatloaf hold its shape. It's a keeper!

Excellent dish, we all loved it. I did make some substitutions to work with what I had on hand: difficult to find ground dark-meat turkey in France so did it with breast, no Worcestershire sauce so I upped the amount of soy and chopped celeriac instead of celery since that's all I had. A real hit and a recipe I will definitely make again.

This was delicious! It is fast in terms of prep work and is a keeper! I made a few substitutions because I did not have all of the ingredients as listed and it worked out great! I used lean ground turkey and fresh whole grain bread crumbs. Instead of the ground ancho chili powder I substituted, as others did, 1 tablespoon of chili powder and I added 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper. I did not have apricot preserves so I used hot mango chutney for mixing with the ground turkey. For the glaze I used hot pepper peach jam (had it in my fridge) instead of the apricot preserves.

It is one of my husband's favorit recipes. It may be even better as a leftover. Freezes fine too.

I love how this tastes. The mix of sweet and tangy is great (I wasn't exactly hopeful about how dried apricots would taste in a meatloaf, but I'm glad I tried it!) I doubled the recipe and chopped the carrots, onions and celery all together in my food processor. Later I chopped the dried apricots in it as well. I did follow the directions and made homemade bread crumbs but next time I wil try using Panko bread crumbs to save time. Finally, I substituted regular chile powder when I couldn't find the ancho chile powder in the store. My husband has now rated this as our #1 meatloaf.

I seldom make meat loaf because my family really doesn't care much for it. But I wanted something "wintery" to serve, and tried this recipe. It was wonderful, as described -- very moist and flavorful. It makes way more than a 9x5" loaf, though. I baked it in a 10-inch glass pie dish and it filled it up. Same cooking time worked, though. Try this, even if you don't like meat loaf!

WOW! This meatloaf is dynamite! Followed the recipe pretty closely but, to reduce the calories a little I used half lean ground turkey and half all white meat turkey. I was worried it might come out dry because of the sub, but I needn't have feared! It was moist and flavorful! I threw all the veggies into my food processor and looked away for a minute; when I stopped them they had turned into a chunky paste. I thought I had ruined dinner, but continued anyway. It definitely didn't hurt the outcome. In fact, I might repeat my happy accident next time! Other changes: used 1.5 cups of Panko, added maybe 1/4 tsp of cayenne for heat, and threw half of a shallot from another recipe in with the diced veggies.

I love this recipe! I've been on a journey for healthy tasty weight loss, and this recipe is a staple for me. To make it lighter I use skim milk instead of whole milk, use 93% lean ground turkey (or ground turkey breast), skip the chopped apricots, and it still produces great flavor. I've never been a fan of meat loaf, but this one has me hooked! I also couldn't find ancho chile powder so I used cayenne and I love the added kick.

This was outstanding! I used pasture raised bison, left out the soy sauce, didn't have preserves used maple syrup grade B. The balance of sweet and savory is beautiful. We were all full but had to finish every bite it was so good.

I loved this! So moist and flavorful. The only change I would make is to cut the dried fruit down as it was a little sweet, but I think it will be great cold too. I'm Italian and I think the people who had poorer results used white meat and dried crumbs. That's a no-no in meatball world :) I might also try to add some more of the veggies to add some more savory flavor I used dark meat turkey and it was SUPER juicy. I used two slices of white bread and just pulsed a few times. Really, really good.

Ok, so I always laugh when people give a recipe a poor rating and they haven't followed it; what can I say? Used panko bread crumbs and didn't have ancho chili power (debated whether to use chipotle power or regular chili powder) and used regular chili power (not a good idea). Also used ground white meat turkey from the grocery store. I thought it was a lot of work and really terrible. Perhaps if I'd followed the directions closer, I'd have had better results. This is the first "one fork" rating I've ever given on epicurious.com.

This meatloaf was flavorful, moist and delicious! Like other reviewers, I used Panko breadcrumbs - but I didn't need any additional other than what was called for in the recipe. It's a very forgiving recipe also! I didn't have any apricots, so I just chopped up some dates and threw those in. They added a little sweetness without adding a "date" taste. This will be a regular staple for us.

I've tried many different recipes for turkey meatloaf and have never found one I've really liked until now. This was wonderful and my son and husband raved about it, too.I used panko breadcrumbs since I didn't have anything else.

This was pretty good. To offset the potential for being too sweet, as noted by others, I used dried sour cherries in place of the dried apricots. I also used an extra cup of breadcrumbs.

Love this recipe! Like the other reviewers I used more bread crumbs and cayenne pepper instead of ancho chile powder. It's a hit with everyone who tastes it!

I made this as written and found it to be way too sweet for my taste, though my husband liked it. The chili powder added flavor, but no heat. If I make this again (doubtful) I'll add a hefty bit of cayenne and omit the glaze.

I'm dubious about meatloaf, but this is really good. My husband said "delicious!" and my toddler even ate it! I used fresh dill and dried parsley, and some dried peaches mixed with the apricots. I used maple syrup instead of preserves for the glaze, and the whole thing added up to success!

Never having had turkey meatloaf before I was blown away. I've made this twice so far (as several other reviewers, I used ground white meat as my supermarket didn't have ground dark) and it's fantastic. I definitely agree that using two cups of breadcrumbs makes the situation much more manageable. Try and keep the top as flat as you can so the syrup stays put during baking. Makes fantastic sandwiches too.

Absolutely outstanding recipe. I was a little cavalier about the measurements and arguably screwed the recipe up, and it was still amazing. The sweet and savory blend makes for a very unique flavor that is both delicious and refreshing. It was difficult to find ground dark turkey meat at the grocery store, but it turned out perfectly fine with the light meat. I highly recommend this recipe. To whomever created the recipe originally - Well played. Well played indeed.

This was amazing. I am never truly impressed by meatloaf but I couldn't stop talking about this one. The sweetness makes it like a treat. I used stale whole wheat bread and added more than the recipe called for as with other reviewers. Love this!

This meatloaf is fantastic! I took the previous advice and added more breadcrumbs to make the consistency easier to work with (2 cups). We don't eat red meat and this was a great break from traditional meatloaf. I WAS able to find ground dark turkey at the local grocery store and it was PERFECT!

This meatloaf is delicious! I needed to add more breadcrumbs to make the consistency easier to work with however. Instead of 1 cup breadcrumbs, I would at least put 2 if not more. It is definitely a pleasant change from traditional meatloaf. I wasn't able to find ground 'dark turkey' at the local grocery store but bought regular ground turkey and it was great!
