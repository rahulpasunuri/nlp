This ice cream cake was delightful, I would suggest that anyone making it use dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate, but that's just a personal preference.

Loved this recipe - easy and so tasty! I used the macaroons and thought it was delicious and so did my guests. Bryers makes a cherry vanilla ice cream - yum!

I NEVER give anything 4 forks since "beyond compare" is pretty unatainable, but I'm making an exception. I served this to a dinner party and everyone raved. The reason for the 4 forks is that the cake is wonderfully good and a fresh mix of flavors. In addition it is very easy and can be prepared ahead. I used a disposable metal loaf pan, lined with Saran, which made turning it out and cleanup a breeze. We are partial to bakery almond macaroons so I used those instead of the storebought amaretti. I also used Bluebell Cherry Vanilla ice cream which was perfect. I saw that Bluebell is now making a Chocolate-covered Cherry ice cream--am thinking that could be even better. We will serve this often--a wonderful recipe.

I used 2 pints of'Cherry Garcia' Ben & Jerry's ice cream and 1 pint of vanilla,since I could not find plain cherry vanilla ice cream. I used the vanilla as the middle layer. The combination of cherry and amaretto cookie crust is a wonderful one and that chocolate sauce is just way too good! I loved this dessert!

A big hit! I prepared two different ice cream cakes for a party of 26! I used Mint Milano cookies for one of them and it was fantastic! Put the cake on a big plate, drizzle some of the chocolate sauce in an interesting pattern, or tap on some powdered sugar for a great presentation.

I use this recipe as a template and it comes out great everytime. Sometimes I make a bittersweet chocolate sauce, other times I'll substitute different ice cream flavors or different cookie crumbs. Everyone loves it and as long as you like the flavor combos, it's terrific!

A delicious dessert that's very easy to make. I have made this many times both because it's so good and can be made well in advance. I recommend this recipe highly!

I have not stopped receiving rave reviews for this dessert. I did substitute chocolate macaroons and used the best vanilla ice cream and imported chocolate for the sauce. It looked beautiful and was so easy to make. This one will have many repeat performances.
