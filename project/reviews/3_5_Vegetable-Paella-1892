A few adjustments: I used vegetable broth to make it vegetarian. I left out the escarole and peas, and added vegetarian "chorizo sausage." Overall very good and even better the next day. Makes a nice vegetarian meal served with crusty bread.

After making the following changes its a 4: I added to the saute of (green)pepper and onion, two quartered zucchini, mushrooms, corn and roasted red pepper. Then added chick peas instead of the kidney beans. Yum. Kids actually request it!!

Forgot to add my rating below. Would give it 3.5 if I could, for all the reasons stated in my review below. Definitely recommend it.

Very delicious. I believe I followed the recipe to a t, was easy and everybody loved it. Good amount of veggies and beans, yummy, healthy, easy, will definitely make again.

The dish was flavorful and very nutritious. I used a mixture of lacinato kale (sweeter than the regular version) and spinach instead of chard, and used edamame instead of peas as this is what I had on hand. The disappointment expressed by a few reviewers may have to do with the quality of the saffron they used. I find that the real tasty stuff is very hard to find, being uniquely produced in Spain and coming only from one specific crocus. What's on the market is usually good for color but taste is poor. Smoked paprika, however, has incredible flavor and has been used traditionally in many versions of paellas. I used some of that along with regular Hungarian paprika and a light sprinkling of dried hot peppers. With more garlic than what the recipe called for, it was indeed delicious.

My husband made this in '93 for a dinner party while I made the seafood one from the same magazine. His was fabulous. When I made it again months later, it was not as good. I think the quality of the ingredients is key, as well as attention to detail.

ho hum. Even with doubling the spices and using grilled artichoke hearts, very bland. Nice concept, but lacking in flavor.

I usually have no trouble following a recipe for good results. I followed this recipe carefully and ended up with mush with little flavor. I doubled the saffron, paprika and salt, as well as the garlic, and was still disappointed with the flavor. Some of the vegetables were over-cooked. I also used Arborio rice, as the recipe suggested. The result was more like sticky risotto than paella. I won't use this recipe again. Also, saffron is expensive, so I wouldn't classify this as a budget-conscious recipe based on the amount I needed to even get moderate flavor.

This is a winner. A wonderful recipe to make when you have vegetarian guests. It's relatively easy and you can add whatever veggies you have around. I added some shitake mushrooms and used aspargus rather than artichokes. Everyone loved it.

Yummy yum yum. Easy and very tasty. This was my first time making paella. I made it for my book group and everyone raved and wanted seconds. Doubled the saffron, but didn't have a lot of paprika (it was fine). Squeezed in about half a lemon's worth of juice. Left out the beans and some of the peas (the fresh peas I got were tiny!) and added portabello chicken sausage. Also used canned artichokes rather than frozen. Scrapings from the bottom of the pan were delish. Did I say YUM?

Exceptionally tasty and aesthetically pleasing. I substituted vegetable broth for chicken broth and used light red kidney beans instead of cannellini and it came out wonderfully.

This is a great recipe. I add chicken, shrimp, and chorizo to give it some protein and it always turns out delicious! I've made it three times now.

Horrible, Bland, and a mushy waste of all ingredients, It went straight into the garbage. Sad excuse for vegetarian food! BLEAH!!!!

A winner for sure. I usually find a way to mess up a recipe but not this one. Have made it a few times to great reviews - and now I have something (good) to serve my vegetarian friends or bring to their dinner parties!

I really love this recipe and couldn't stop eating it! The highlight was that I used fresh peas, and they really popped when I ate them. I used veg broth and asparagus instead of artichokes. I had to cook it a bit longer than directed, but in the end, it was fabulous and really easy to prepare.

I made this recipe with spinach instead of chard, and fresh asparagus instead of artichokes (because they're in season). Also used vegie broth to accomodate a vegetarian guest. I prepped everything in advance; as a result it was easy to make and allowed me to spend time with my guests. This recipe struck me as being risotto-like in texture. Tasted wonderful, everyone enjoyed it. The recipe makes huge servings. Everyone ate a lot and there were plenty of leftovers! This dish fit well with the Spanish theme of our Rioja wine tasting. As far as making this recipe again: maybe. I experiment a lot and don't often make the same thing twice. It's good enough to do again.

We loved it. I followed Brett and a cook from DC's advice and used 1/2 tsp of saffron and 1 tsp paprika. I also decided against the peas, beans, and kale and used artichokes, asparagus, zuichinni instead. Really enjoyed it.

Awesome! This is a healthy and tasty dish. The ony change I made was to double the saffron and jack up the paprika, salt and pepper as we loike our food a bit less subtle in flavor. Garnish with lemons(excellent suggestion!) This was super quick- I prefer with green chard as it is less bitter and strong than the escarole we have available here. Def. a staple in our house.

Very good, with the addition of a few ingredients you might find a bit odd....i added a 1/2 c. vermouth, 4 ounces oyster mushrooms, a sprig of rosemary, and 2 tsp. chopped wakame. delicious!

After having tried some very greasy paella dishes in Spain, I am happy to have such an "authentic" tasting recipe to make at home. It's definitely worth using 1/2 tsp saffron.

I was disappointed in this recipe, no overriding flavor. Seemed like so many vegetarian recipes, just not very interesting. I wish I had read about the lemons, anything would have helped.

Very tasty and well received by my vegetarian friends. I splurged and bought my saffron mail order to ensure its quality and freshness. It was well worth the investment and in the long run it was a very economical meal. The recipe feeds more than 6 people so there were lots of leftovers.

Delicious and easy - 45 min from chopping to table. On the side I sauteed some shrimp and scallops in butter and white wine for my guests who ate fish and it was great. I added the lemon juice as suggested and that really brightened and made the dish, I thought.

I loved this recipe. Substituted veggie broth for chicken and then followed suggestions from Brett in Spain and Cook in DC and it was awesome. Lemon wedges really make a difference.

I also used vegetable stock to make this a truly vegetarian dish. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was excellent. I honestly could not stop eating this, it was that good.

This recipe was just so-so....edible, but not yummy. My hubby liked it, but I am the vegetarian in the family and I just wasn't impressed! Maybe I just don't overall like paella...I've never tasted the real kind, so hate to judge but after spending $10.00 on the saffron, (I do have some left over) I would not be in a hurry to make it again.

There are times when vegetarian renditions just don't measure up. This was one of them. Yes, it had a dim resemblance, but the absence of chicken and seafood was too much to overcome. OK, I used vegetable broth instead of chicken stock, and maybe that was a mistake. I did use fresh baby aritchokes which I steamed lightly in advance, and that was a high point.

We try not to eat much meat, but it is nearly impossible to do so in Spain. So when I found this recipe, I was thrilled! We order paella often and this recipe is a close as it gets. The results were worth the search. My comments are these: 1) use a paellera (the actual pan used to cook paella) or your flattest widest pan. This is so you can obtain the "soccarat" or the delicious crusty rice on the bottom of the pan. It is considered a delicacy and my husband and I fight over it! You can ensure getting it by cranking the fire up a notch right at the end, 2) use REAL SAFFRON THREADS and crush them right before use. Use more than called for. The saffron threads are also delicious toasted. Adds a subtle smokey flavor, 3) use coarse sea salt (all they use here) and use more. Really fun to make. Try it on the grill, too! When cooking for large family events, the Spanish cook over a wood fire. This recipe--what a find!

Yummy!!! To make it truly vegetarian, I subbed vegetable broth for the chicken. I also used spinach instead of escarole/chard, as several others suggested. I omitted the peas b/c I don't like them, and I increased the spices a bit (1/2 tsp of saffron, 1 tsp of paprika). We squeezed some fresh lemon juice on top and garnished with lemon wedges, just as they do in Spain. Delicious!

"This can't taste like paella," I thought. But I followed the reciepe (with spinach instead of escrarole and Vitam instead of chicken stock) and I and my guests were really impressed. Caveat: the heat levels suggested were too hot for my gas stove and the water boiled away too quickly, leaving the rice a wee bit hard. A family favorite to be. Thanks EpiCurious!

Good paella, I like that it's meatless. I did without the beans and peas, though, and used 2 cups of broccoli instead of the artichoke hearts. I also used fresh tomatos, instead of canned, and I really like how it came out. I would definitely use even more saffron next time, though.
