I have made this twice now and it has become a favorite. I made only a few changes: I didn't have wasabi powder so I used 1 tsp of wasabi paste. I also used about an inch or two of chopped ginger and 1 tsp of toasted sesame oil in the marinade. I pan seared in an iron skillet sprayed with cooking oil. I didn't have green beans so I steamed some asparagus in a steamer bag in the microwave for a couple of minutes and then finished them off in the iron skillet with a little marinade. I too used only 1 tsp of brown sugar in the marinade and poured it over the tuna and asparagus after cooking. Wasabi and ginger really add a lot to the recipe so don't forget them.

Love this marinade!! I follow the recipe for marinading, then lightly coat tuna with fresh ground pepper. Sear both sides, remove, sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds, toss the marinade in the hot pan about a minute,and pour over the tuna, before slicing. If I have leftovers, it is great the following day on a salad.

I must agree with other reviewers that this is a good recipe, but needs adjustment. Much to much sugar! Also, tuna shouldn't be just cooked in the centre, it should be raw. Certainly if it's of high quality. I solve this by asking the fish monger to cut blocks from the tuna. There are some protests about searing with sesame oil. It's true it likes to burn with very high heat, but if another oil (peanut or sunflower) is mixed with it, this greatly increases its heat resistance. Also liked the idea of adding fish sauce. If caramelization is the goal with the beans, perhaps a nob of butter added after the beans in combination with around 1 - 2 tablespoons of brown sugar would be a better idea. Too sweet and fish are NOT a good idea in my estimation. After all this criticism, I still think this is a good, healthful and easy idea. BTW I think garlic powder should be banned!

HOW DO I COOK TUNA STEAK OMG I'M FREAKING OUT SAVE MEEEEE That's what I thought when I bought some steaks from Trader Joe's on a total whim. But this recipe sounded delicious, and actually kind of hard to screw up, so I gave it a go. It. Was. Awesome. It was really easy to make, the steaks and the green beans were awesome awesome awesome! My only beef is that if you want it to have a kick, you'll definitely need more than a teaspoon of Wasabi. I could hardly detect it when I ate. Will definitely make again!

This was fast, easy and had a nice kick of heat. I didn't have any wasabi powder, so I used some red curry paste. Served with soft noodles. Wow -- what a great weeknight dinner with great flavor.

Rating: 2
This recipe is kind of a mess. Assuming you have excellent tuna, the marinade is too heavy-handed. Proper searing is done over high heat -- sesame oil is not appropriate for high heat. Also, 3 minutes per side is way too long -- you just want the edge to begin to cook. You want your tuna cooked on the edge and rare on the inside.

Rating: 3
This was easy and pretty good, but I will make it again with some changes: low sodium soy sauce, minced ginger,minced garlic, thicker tuna steaks or cook less time. I made it with asparagus and snap peas for veg.instead of beans. I think you could sub virtually any green veg.

Rating: 3
I used a teaspoon of green curry paste and a splash of fish sauce since I didn't have any wasabi powder at hand; I also used less brown sugar, used fresh garlic instead of powdered, and didn't blanch the green beans in advance (I just popped a cover on the skillet after sauteeing them briefly). The recipe worked really well, the beans were especially delicious.

Rating: 4
This was amazing! One of the best meals I have ever made. I added one clove of fresh minced garlic, some minced ginger, and sesame seeds. Only seared for about one minute each side. SO GOOD!!! Can't wait to make it again for friends.

Excellent simple recipe. Just the thing for a weekday night. I particularly like the green beans.

Rating: 2
It was ok but I won't make again. Not much dimension to it and a bit sweet. (I used the sugar proportions indicated and ignored the warnings.) Also - my suggestion is not to saute in the sesame oil since it burns at a low temperature. I used peanut oil instead and added the sesame for flavour near the end of cooking. I prefer the ginger/ shitake recipe for tuna elsewhere on this site.

Simple. Very tasty. I used this recipe to introduce my 12-year old twin boy and girl to quick-seared tuna, leaving it fairly raw inside. They loved the flavors. I was surprised to see them both take a second helping of green beans, too. For those who don't want to overpower the taste of a good sushi-grade tuna, I simply marinated the steaks for about 1/3 the time.

This was a waste of sushi grade tuna. I tried it because of all the good reviews. The marinade was too strong and too sweet. Any of the subtle flavors of the tuna were over powered.

This was easy and basically delicious, but too sweet! Next time I'll use only 1 T of sugar. Followed the earlier suggestion of adding sesame seeds to the tuna. Made snow peas instead of green beans (which didn't need blanching) and used sesame chile oil (instead of plain sesame oil) for a little extra bite. I also made extra marinade, keeping some separate before adding to tuna, and used after as a dipping sauce. Will make again!

I am a novice in the kitchen. My husband and I loved this dish. I used broccoli as we prefer it to green beans. Next time I will remember to use the exhaust fan however as it smelled like an asian restaurant in the house for several hours later! Oh, and I did add the white and black sesame seeds as suggested.

Rating: 3
the marinade is delicious! try it with maguro tuna (some grocers have it frozen with the other asian items). this high quality tuna is much better, cleaner in taste than your typical tuna steak at the fish counter. fresh wasabi powder is essential - you never know how long it has been sitting on a grocery store shelf. i love thespicehouse.com - check them out for a huge selection of great spices for your kitchen. this recipe is a keeper!

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I believe this is the first recipe for which I've awarded four forks. I did add extra wasabi powder and pressed the steaks in sesame seeds before searing as suggested by others, and plated it with some brown rice vermicelli as a base, then the beans, and the tuna steaks on top. Since I made the full marinade recipe for only two tuna steaks and about 3/4 lb of beans, I had some sauce left in the pan, so I reduced it a little more and drizzled it on top of everything. Absolutely brilliant recipe - simple and impressive.

I followed the tip of adding sesame (great!). I agree with only marinating for 15 minutes, I let it sit with more and the result was a bit strong. Also, we didn't have green beans and used mixed oriental vegetables. Ensure that they are not overcooked as they soak up too much of the sauce. Also great in a wrap the next day with the addition of a little wasabi honey vinaigrette.

Amazing! I followed the tip of adding sesame seeds. It definitely improves the look and adds a little crunch. And the sauce, my word! I've never enjoyed green beans more! My favorite tuna recipe is the Ginger Shitake Cream Sauce on this site, but this is a nice lighter alternative.

If an easier dish exists, please let me know! Excellent weeknight dish. The green beans were amazing! As other cooks suggested, I added much more wasabi, and only 1 Tbsp sugar. I also marinated the tuna for an hour+ for more flavor. Great advice. This is definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe. I actually make it with a slight modification. Our grocery store Stop & Shop sells fresh fish with marainades. I buy the tuna and marinade it in their Ginger Teryaki marinade. Then I just mix it with this recipe. For noodles we use the Thai Kitchen Toasted Sesame. Great dish, everyone loves it and has becaome a regular meal.

This is sooo good not even my food-snob husband could believe how simple it was to make. I make a little more sauce than the receipe calls for and I use fresh minced garlic and more wasabi (we like it HOT). This is also delicious with carrots or snow peas instead of the green beans. Also great with salmon!

Rating: 4
This is fantastic and easy. One tip- when the recipe says to marinade for 15 mins, they really mean it!! I let it soak in the fridge for 2 hours and the flavor was a little strong. I think 15 mins would have been perfect.

Loved it. My 11 year old son went crazy over the green beans (they're good enough to make by themselves). It helps to pour the extra sauce over the tuna steaks. I like how the time / ingredients used for the tuna are used again for the green beans (makes dinner a little easier).

outstanding! everytime I make it people ooh and ahh and want the recipe. Very simple, but seems fancy. I usually coat the tuna in sesame seeds before searing, and add a little more wasabi and garlic to the marinade I serve it with ginger garlic rice made with coconut milk.

Rating: 3
I made this for the second time last night, definitely a keeper. Quick & easy, plus fairly low-fat. After reading the reviews, I made a few modifications, after marinating the tuna I coated both sides in a mixture of black & white sesame seeds. In addition, I used my Lodge cast iron grill pan, to give the tuna "grill marks" (I cooked the green beans separately in a non-stick pan). I think these 2 changes dramatically improved the appearance of the tuna. I will double the amount of wasabi next time around. I think the amount of marinade/sauce is perfect for making 2 large pieces of tuna & green beans, but I would probably double it for 4.

Rating: 4
This is the resident tuna recipe in our house - whenever I get tuna but don't feel like grilling it or shopping for ingredients (90% of times when I get tuna) this is the way I make it. Even if I don't have beans... just use the marinade. I do add sesame seeds though.

Rating: 2
With all the wonderful reviews, I thought I would like this more. It was okay--green beans were good w/the sauce, but tuna was just okay. There are better ways to prepare tuna--on this website the ginger-shiitake sauce w/tuna is delicious, but of course, less healthy also!

Rating: 4
This is the third or fourth time I've made this dish. It's easy and delightful. I've served it to friends with the jasmine rice and black and white sesame seeds also featured on epicurious. Everyone raved about it. I had to turn on the computer to print the recipe for several diners that evening.

Overall fine. I guess I've just never fully appreciated what heat does to raw tuna ;) Made as written, and thought all the amounts were just right. The lightly sweetened green beans were good too. Quick and easy dish.

Very tasty! I also added some additional wasabi powder and some chopped garlic. Consider doubling the marinade - it doesn't go very far. I made the recommended marinade for only one piece of tuna. There also has to be some way to dress this dish up a bit (appearance-wise). Because of the marinade and seared tuna, the dish looks very brown. Would be nice to make it look a little better. Still - very good!

I liked this recipe but my bf was not crazy about it. I increased the amount of wasabi powder to 1 TB, minced one clove of garlic, added about 1 TB of minced ginger and let the tuna marinade for about 30 minutes. I coated the tuna with sesame seeds before searing. If I prepare it again, I will add more wasabi powder.

As did others, I used fresh minced garlic and a little more wasabi in the marinade. Although I made half the recipe as for tuna and green beans, I made the full amount of the marinade. It's a good thing I did, or there would not have been enough to saute the green beans. A very tasty tuna dish and easy, too. Wasabi mashed potatoes was my choice of a side dish.

I made this dish last night for a dinner party of six. It was a hit! Thanks to all the previous suggestions, I did decrease the sugar to 1 Tablespoon (can't imagine it with more), added minced fresh garlic when I put the green beans in the skillet with the marinade, and put black and white sesame seeds on the tuna before searing. Definitely don't overcook -- I think 2 minutes is just fine. Having never cooked with wasabi before, I didn't follow the suggestions for adding more of it to the marinade but I will next time just to see the difference. This is definitely a keeper and a great dish for when it is just us at home or for when there is company. I preceded it with a broth (not cream)- based mushroom soup, and followed with a delicious baby field greens, mandarin orange, and lightly salted peanuts salad. For dessert I made mimosa granitas and served some thin ginger cookies. The whole meal was a hit -- and easy to pull together.

This receipe is fantastic! I followed it exactly as written, except that I doubled everything to have more sauce. We did an Asian themed dinner with another couple Saturday night, and I never would have imagined that with so little work, and so few ingredients, we would have such a feast. The tuna was fantastic (we had 8-ounce pieces, so it took 4 minutes per side). The green beans were also great -- the doubled sauce not only coated the beans, but also provided a fantastic drizzle over the wasabi mashed potatoes I made as my starch. This is truly company-level cooking with absolutely NO long, complicated preparation. We all gave it four forks!!!

So quick, easy and delicious! Quick and easy for a weeknight meal - but good enough for company. I omitted the seasame oil and just used Pam on a non-stick pan for cooking the tuna. I made a sauce with tons of wasabi paste and fat free sour cream as dipping sauce for the tuna - it was great addition to the sweetness of the beans and the more mild taste of the tune. I'll make this again and again and won't change a thing!

Rating: 3
Easy, quick....and more flavor than i expected...but next time around i will add some minced garlic to the final sauce before adding the greenbeans (just a bit)...the garlic powder provided a "shadow" dusty flavor, and I think just a few minces (1/2 teaspoon) of fresh garlic would spark the sauce/greenbeans.

My wife and I made this recipe for a small dinner party (total of 6 people). It was perfect. We actually used tuna medallions instead of tuna steaks.

All the guests ate their plates clean.

This is a great easy and delicious dish. Next time, I would add more wasabi to the marinade, and let it marinate much longer than 15 minutes. My ahi tuna steaks were very thick, and 3 minutes per side turned out to be perfect timing, they were still very pink in the middle, but not cold. Based on the other reviews, I added about one rounded tablespoon of brown sugar and that was just enough. Very nice dish.

My first try at a recipe off this site. And I am most definitely NOT a cook, although I'm working on it. Enjoyed this dish and will make it again but with much less sugar in the green beans and more wasabi in the tuna marinade. Also, I cooked the tuna for about half the recommended time and some of it was still overcooked for my taste. Finally, the recipe did not specify how much pepper to put on the tuna and I put waaay too much - I think just a sprinkle is needed.

I've given this recipe all four stars not because the end result is so incredibly spectacular, but because the end result is incredibly good considering the ease and speed of preparation. The slight saltiness of the fish plays off the sweetness of the green beans nicely. I served with lighlty buttered white rice and lightly salted baby carrots. Preparation comments: 1) I prefer the beans a little more well done, so I boiled for 5 minutes first, and then sauteed with marinade and sugar for another 5 or 6 minutes. 2) I will try doubling the wasabi powder next time for more kick, although I'm not sure how it will affect the green beans. 3) If desired, one could safely add toasted sesame seeds to either the fish before searing, or the beans when tossing with marinade. --- This is an awesome simple dish.

This was so good! And I can't believe how easy it was. I love how the marinade becomes the glaze for the beans. It is definitely going into my regular rotation. If you like it rare, be sure to buy sushi-grade tuna and only cook it 1-2 minutes per side.

As others have noted, I also thought this recipe was excellent! Of course starting off with a great tuna steak doesn't hurt.

I have made this recipe several times and served it to people who have very pedestrian palates. Everyone loves this. I suggest pressing a lot of sesame seeds into the steaks before searing, it tastes better and looks better. It is also best with minced fresh garlic in the marinade. We use sushi grade yellow fin (it's what is in our grocery) and cook 5, no more than 6 minutes. This dish tastes best when the tuna is very pink inside.

As good as was promised - I added some white and black sesame seeds to the tuna before searing to add a bit of a crust and it helps to distiguish the marinade flavor from the sauce. I also added a side of rice noodles with a Thai spice sauce. This will go in my list of woman-wooing recipes! Thanks!

This dish has made me a hero in my house. Tips: I used powdered wasabi and used way more than suggested (keep tasting until you like flavor) ~I like alot of kick. Cooked steaks only a few minutes on each side and ate like sushi. fantastic fantastic fantastic!

This dish gets high marks not only for being delicious, but for being so easy, too! I liked the idea of adding carrots for color. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! Kids loved it too.

I'm always looking for new ways to prepare tuna steaks, and this recipe is definitely on my list of keepers. We liked the marinade flavor so much that we used it the next time to marinate chicken which we simply pan seared (I'd recommend making extra marinade for the beans rather than reserving the marinade from the chicken, though). I also added a little corn starch to enhance thickening of the marinade. We don't have wasabi powder in my supermarket, but they did have wasabi paste, which I used instead.

Believe it or not, I tried this with catfish, and it worked beautifully! I think some blanched carrots would be a nice addition to the green beans - mainly for a little extra color on the plate. I served with a shitake mushroom rice. Will definitely make this again! Try catfish if you can't afford the tuna, it really does work!

I loved it! I used asparagus instead of green beans and heated up udon noodles with the asparagus.

I don't mind spending hours preparing an excellent meal, but what really rocks my socks is finding a recipe like this that is not only incredibly delicious but also easy and quick. We loved it!

So easy, quick, and tasty... it came out perfectly the first time, and I'm only an occasional cook, esp. with seafood. Didn't wait long enough for the marinade to thicken, but the beans were still wonderful. I'm looking forward to trying it with sea bass.

This recipe is wonderful! We make it as often as we can. I've gotten very good at preparing seared medium rare tuna - mostly through this dish. It's pretty difficult to mess up - which is nice. Just watch cooking the fish too long because it dries out quickly.

This is a fantastic and easy recipe! Be careful not to use too much soy sauce because it can be a little too salty. I use basmati rice which is a sweeter, fragrant rice and it goes wonderfully with the sweet grean beans and adds a great "opposite" effect (sweet and salty) to the whole dish! I make this often with Tuna steaks, but I think I'll try another type of fish like the other cooks have suggested. Happy cooking!!

We love this dish and make it at least twice a month. We have taken to using salmon filets instead of tuna and I use fresh garlic. We started making lemon risotto with it and they go together surprisingly well. You won't be disappointed! If you cut the recipe in half, don't forget to cut the marinade also, otherwise there will be too much sauce for the beans and they won't coat properly. It is very easy to prepare.

THIS TUNA WAS THE BEST!!! i don't mind saying..... and have very demanding tastebuds!!!! i did however leave the sugar out of the beans...sugar is our enemy!!! instead, i added 2 minced garlic and ginger and some crushed red pepper to the skillet (you may need a bit more oil), browned a wee bit then added the green beans. let the skin bubble a bit and add a few more dashes of soy sauce. let cook a few more minutes....there you have great green beans to go with a FAB FISH!!!! YUMMY!!!!

Fantastic! I will make this over and over again.

My family raved about this dish. Our teenage son,who generally dislikes fish and vegetables, ate seconds and thirds of both the tuna and green beans, taking from our plates! This was a hit in our house.

Deeeeelectable! If you don't have wasabi or sesame oil on hand, this recipe makes a compelling argument in favor of expanding your pantry. This was simple to make and positively complex in flavor. I also coated the steaks with sesame seeds before searing, and I served them over a bed of basmati and long grain rice. Take a couple minutes to create a lovely presentation before serving your dinner guests and you'll reap the rewards! One of my friends actually wanted to take a picture of her meal before digging in!

What a meal to impress a date. That's all I need to say.... Try it for yourself. It's great for company too!!! I would definitely make this again. Enjoy!

We have made this 5+ times and love it! Its fast, easy and impressive enough for company. Have substituted Mahi-Mahi for Tuna and it is great! Could not find wasabi powder locally so we substituted wasabi paste - approx. 3 inches worth.

This is absolutely wonderful! I used ginger as well as wasabi and would kick that up just a bit next time as well as saute the beans a bit longer. A great dish for guests and very easy to make.

This recipe is excellent!! The brown sugar gave the beans a wonderfully sweet taste and the tuna was great!! I boiled some noodles and added them to what was left of the sauce, added a little soy sauce and then enjoyed everything!!

This is a quickly prepared recipe that also tastes fantastic. I have made this twice, once following the recipe and the second time using Wasabi sauce instead of powder,some crushed garlics in addition to powder, and a darker, less sweet brown sugar. Excellent both times (less sweet the second) and highly recommended.

Enjoyed this very much with Swordfish. Added some fresh ginger to spice it up a bit. Was surprised it had no bite from the Wasabe powder. Only downfall is the price of fish today.

Yes, this was VERY easy. I used grouper and cooked it on the grill and it was fabulous! Since I wasn't doing it in a pan, as called for in the recipe, I added the sesame oil to the marinade.

This was SOOOO easy to prepare and VERY delicious. I used fresh wasabi and garlic in the marinade - which I recommend highly. I also coated one side of the tuna in black/white sesame seeds. Use the french green beans for a more sophisticated twist - very delish!

Seems I shorted myself by not preparing the green beans as well as the fish. I was looking for a tasty prep for tuna steaks. This worked really well, and tho' next time I'll try it with the "greens", I do not feel cheated!

Delicious and incredibly easy. I made it with steamed baby bok choy instead of green beans, and it was delicious. Also left the tuna very rare inside, the way we like it (sushi lovers). I can't wait to make it again!

Ono recipe. Being a transplant from Hawaii, I am always on the lookout for dishes that make me feel like I'm home. I love fish and this is a wonderful way to make it. I'll try thresher shark next time - as recommended above. I used brocoli instead, cuz that's what I had. Thank you.

Made this with thresher shark--super! Used tube wasabi rather than powdered, more than 1 tsp and it still wasn't overpowering (and I don't like wasabi!). Be sure to use dark soy sauce, not light, as light is much saltier. Next time I'd use slightly less brown sugar and maybe a dash of chilli sauce--but these are just minor refinements. A great one-dish meal.
