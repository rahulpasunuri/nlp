The best lemon granita I have ever tasted!!! I used 1/2 cup sugar and the flavor was absolutely balanced, neither too sweet nor too puckery. My sisters loved it! This granita is perfect for these hot summer days.

This is absolutely wonderful! It is light and refreshing. I made it this past summer for a dinner party and my pregnant friend who can't eat anything these days LOVED it!! We made her some to keep in her freezer! Good stuff.

Made this last night to end xmas eve dinner. Dinner consisted of five courses, followed by salad, a cheese course, and then two different desserts. Needless to say, we were quite full and sleepy. This granita woke everyone up! Puckery, cold, good. I personally thought that though it was puckery, it needed more lemon "flavor". Perhaps I'll grate the zest and leave it in and add a pinch of salt next time. Others thought it was too puckery and needed more sugar. Regardless, I think we all enjoyed it.

Delicious with berries on top, and very pretty mixed with a little grape granitas to give it purple speckles. I've also made a lemon-orange version that worked very well and plan to try a lemon-ginger version.

Excellent! Takes right back to my time in Sicily. As close as I can get to buying a granita on the streets of Palermo or Agrigneto. As the recipe says, this needs to be tart for you to have the authentic flavor. In my opinion, the only way.
