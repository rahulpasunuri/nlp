A nice recipe. I made some substitutions (cranberry for currants, extra cinnamon, sucanat for brown sugar) but didn't feel these had harmed the intended flavor. For me the breads came out over sweet and lacking in a pronounced taste. The ginger was slight, the pear was lost, even the cranberry couldn't bring out it's tartness. On my next attempt I'm going to remove a half cup of the sugar and add more crystallized ginger and cranberry. The pear can probably stay the same though I'll use bigger chunks. Overall, not a terrible base recipe with room for improvement I'd recommend trying it out for something different. Can also be made into a denser muffin.

Only thing I changed was the pan size; adjusted baking time to use 2 larger pans. The bread is OK, but seems dry to me, despite the pears and the fact that I soaked my currants! I also feel that the ginger overwhelms the remainder of the flavors. I probably won't bother to repeat this one.

I tweaked the recipe in accordance with what I had in my kitchen at the time. I substituted 1 tsp ground ginger for the crystallized and I used 1/2 currants and 1/2 dried sweetened cranberries (making the 3/4 cup of dried fruit). The results were a very moist fruity bread. Even my teenaged students loved it. My very picky husband loves it for breakfast and with ice cream for dessert.

I found the bread to be lacking in taste. We couldn't taste the pears at all.
