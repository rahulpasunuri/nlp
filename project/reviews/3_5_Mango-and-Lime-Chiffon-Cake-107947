I've made this cake several times now, and i absolutely love it! It's a great baby/wedding shower cake, especially in the summer. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe to the T, after that, I made a few adjustments, mostly to save time and cleanup. Some tips/time savers that did not effect the taste (or texture): - instead of prepping the mango nectar, use Goya's frozen mango pulp (found in the frozen food section of many supermarkets). It's 100 percent natural. Defrost it in your microwave or over stove, let it cool off and proceed with the recipe as if using nectar. - add 1/4 - 1/2/ tsp more baking powder for a more light and fluffy cake (even if you use nectar) - whip the egg white first with your mixer, transfer stiff egg whites to another bowl and then proceed to whip eggs, oil etc. in the still 'dirty' mixer bowl. I found it saves times as you do not have to wash the mixer bowl out for the egg whites and then just fold those into the bigger mixer bowl. - if you would like the curd less tangy, just do 1/2 cup of lime juice. - curd making takes 20 minutes, NOT 6 as recipe states. - I always make the batter twice as once never gives me enough batter to make two cakes. Still divide over two pans, and cut the two cakes in half and make either 3 or 4 layer cake - keep tbls or two of curd aside and add to whip cream. it's so yummie! - use wooden skewers in the middle to keep cake from sliding when setting and especially when transporting!

This was very good. The cake was light and fluffy and the Lime - Ginger curd was so very delicious. Please read all instructions before you begin and remember that it takes much longer than 20 minutes to make the curd and glaze. I will definitely make this again when I want to impress someone. It was very easy but time consuming.

Excellent! Lots of work. Looked beautiful-a work of art! Curd is quite tart yet sweet.

Disappointing. Lime overpowered the mango, which no one could even taste. Cake was flat. I won't make this again.

This was a delicious recipe! I doubled the curd recipe, which was a good idea since it turned out so delicious. Although the cake came out very bread-like, I used the remainging curd to make another cake using a sponge cake recipe for the actual cake. The latter worked much better, and was easier to make. Later on I used remaining mango nectar to make mango curd, which was served with some berries. Overall, I recommend this recipe, although the cake would be better substituted for something lighter(like sponge cake).

This dessert was delicious, but took a great deal of time to make. Altogether, it took me about 3 days to make (curd, cake, assembly all on different days). Like someone else suggested, I used 1/2 cup of lime juice instead of 3/4 cup, and 3/4 mango puree instead of reduced mango nectar. Both turned out beautifully, though the lime curd ends up overwhelming the taste of the mango in the cake. I only used 1 cake pan, baking all at once and cutting horizontally once it had cooled.

This cake turned out well for me, however, I did make a couple of changes to the recipe. I did not have mango nectar on hand. Instead, I pureed fresh mango and used it directly in the batter, which eliminated the step of reducing the mango nectar (I was initially worried about it radically affecting the texture and rise of the cake as the puree was thicker in consistency than the syrupy mango nectar, but it didn't turn out bad at all, and definitely gave the cake a distinct mango flavor). Also, after reading previous reviews regarding the tartness of the lime curd, I reduced the lime juice to 1/2 cup, and it didn't turn out too tart at all. For the frosting, I folded some of the remaining lime curd into the whipped cream instead of making the lime syrup, and it worked beautifully. Overall, a light (in taste, not calories) and refreshing cake!

My friends and family who enjoyed this cake described it as the best cake they've ever eaten and that it tastes like summer. beyond delicious

I agree with Chicago- very tart curd, very bland cake. Too much lime zest in the cake- the texture of the grated lime is creepy. The only thing mango-y about it is the slices on top. The name of this recipe should be "Lime Chiffon Cake Garnished with Mango." Overall not worth the effort.

This was wonderful,started day before and took advise of other reviewers and made the lime curd and mango syrup day ahead, then did the cake the next day, refrigerated overnight and added fresh mango slices on top. I also added to the top fresh red rasberrys for color and used the lime curd on both layers and used the whipped cream for the sides only. Very pretty, light and very refreshing for a spring or summer dessert. I very much appreciated everyone's comments and benefited from their experience. Make this one its great.

I made this recipe for Easter Brunch and what a hit!! The cake is a lot of work, but well worth the trouble, especially for a special occasion. The flavors are fresh and not too sweet. I took one of the reviewer's advice and topped the cake just before serving.

DElicious cake! My family loved it. Worth the effort.

I made this for Mother's Day. It was not worth the effort!! The kurd was much too tart and the cake itself was very ordinary. The topping and the glaze were OK, but why does the recipe make too much and then say "Save for other use" - like what?

If you have a lot of spare time and patience this is a real winner. I made it in stages so I put the cake part aside, thus forgetting to grate those very expensive limes before juicing them...For some reason, Easter week in Miami the 20 for a dollar limes were 2 for a dollar. go figure! The cake was a big hit, delicious, and not so hard to make,but time consuming. I will halve the lime curd recipe next time. A definite keeper!

Great recipe. The cake texture was wonderful and the lime curd outstanding. Next time I will add just a touch more sugar to the curd, as it was a bit tart. I also made it a day ahead, including the whipped cream topping, and it came out just fine. I whipped up extra whipping cream, adding some of the curd to sweeten and served it with the cake. It was a real hit with our dinner guests. One friend called it a Key Lime Cake.

Delicious. Made for a bridal shower. Time consuming but worth it. Less time consuming if juicer on hand. Expect extra curd....great for crepe filling or other topping.

Although it was time consuming (read recipe thoroughly to plan ahead), it was easy and made a spectactular Easter dessert/birthday cake. It even impressed the biggest "dessert snob" in our group. I would definitely make this again!

Wow, did this cake take a long time to make: reduing the mango nectar, making the curd, the glaze, topping -- do not attempt if in a hurry! I thought the curd was amazing (very tart!) and the cake spongy and tasty. I didn't love the whipped cream with glaze topping and may just make a plain icing sugar/milk/butter glaze instead. On the whole it was delicious (and my husband had seconds -- a very rare practice)

This cake is delicious and refreshing. I didn't dare put the whipped cream on until just before serving, but my fears were unfounded. It was still in great shape as I was sneaking leftovers the next day!
