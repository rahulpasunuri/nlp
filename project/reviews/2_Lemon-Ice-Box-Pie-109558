I thought I would give this a try because Cat Cora gave this pie and the restaurant a recommendation on the show The Best Dish I Ever Ate. I think that shows that there is no accounting for taste...in anyone. To be truthful, I still plan on trying it, but will take the tips from others and plan to use gelatin and water to help the pie set up. Plus I think I will skip two cans of condensed milk and use one. That may be a bit over the top. I rarely make a recipe just as it calls for.

This was good but very tart. I would recommend curring down portion of lemon perhaps.

Serve cold is the most important part. We serve it straight from the freezer! Refrigeration is an important and repeated step in this homemade Southern treat. Once the crust and filling are made and put together, they are chilled in the refrigerator before the whipped topping is added and then returned to the freezer. It's called ICE BOX pie because it was originally made back when people did not have refrigerators, only ice boxes and it was kept FROZEN! This is an important instruction missing from the recipe! I hope you all try it again this way!

What a great disappointment in the truest sense of the word! What is it with the great American love affair with cinnamon? Second off, the only way to achieve great flavor was to not only add the juice of 1 lemon, but to add 1/2 tspn of fresh lemon zest as well. As a professional chef, I would NEVER recommend this recipe to anyone!

Absolutely terrible, the lowest rating on this site is one fork which means "okay" but it was so bad I want to give it a negative number of forks, which should mean "Stephen Bruce owes me a pie". It is way too sweet with barely any lemon flavor and the texture is disgusting. Do not try this recipe, I'm still regretting wasting the ingredients on such an atrocity.

A runny too sweet mess.

It did not have enough lemon flavor so I added the juice from one additional lemon. The filing did not get firm so I had something more like cold pudding. I loved the idea of a no bake lemon pie but this isn't it.

Good, definitely needs to be taken in small quantities as the previous comment states and pile on the whip cream it balances the heaviness of the pie. I had lots of trouble getting it to set and finally put it in the freezer over night.

This pie was all right, but I thought it definitely needed something. I added some amaretto, which I thought helped. One thing, though: if you're a person who likes to serve huge pieces of pie, this isn't the pie for you. It's good, even tasty, in small quantities, but you'll quickly get sick of it if you eat too much.

I think Miss Essie's descendants are holding back a key ingredient... I may have had trouble converting the ounces to metric measures, but this did not turn out at all. The filling did not set and remained soupy. Even if the filling did gel, this was way too sweet and not very lemony.

I thought this was wonderful...sweet AND tart with just the right coolness for a warm summer night dessert!
