The frittata was quite good when made as instructed. Like other reviewers, I, too, was a little put off by the idea of Parmesan in this dish but I followed directions and it was fine. On the other hand, I'm not sure it would be lacking anything if you left it out. The chutney, on the other hand, was not working for me. After pulsing there was just way too much juice so I wound up draining in a strainer. The flavors also seemed unbalanced to me - a little too "raw" and maybe my garlic was stronger than most. Reminded of a tomato chutney at a favorite Indian restaurant, I added cinnamon and thought that really worked very well. I also added some chopped cilantro, upped the cumin and ginger a bit, and futzed a little with the brown sugar and salt to get it right. All in all, an interesting vegetarian entree.

I thought this was a great recipe. I halved it and cooked it in a small fry pan. It was delicious. I would absolutely make it again. The chutney is delicious as well. I'd love to add a bit of cilantro the next time around.

Agree that this is delicious and fresh. My intro to chutney and could not be more pleased. I think the Irish cook makes good points re: omitting the cheese AND adding fresh cilantro. I would do both next time. I used my very well-seasoned cast iron pan and it worked beautifully.

This was delicious. The chutney was fresh and complimented the frittata perfectly. I omitted the cheese, because I just find the notion of cheese and curry a bit iffy. If I'd had it on hand I would have added some fresh coriander to the chutney and garnished with the same. I've also portioned it for one person which is a delicious breakfast!

First try I followed the rather non-precise recipe - vague on the size pan, the exact amount of ginger or garlic to use. The Chutney was good - but too sweet! Will cut the sugar in half next and add more off all the rest. As for the frittata, I think my large Alclad pan was too big, it cooked to fast, was dry and flat - it was also really bland. Was better with the Chutney, but that was because it covered the tase. Next time use smaller pan, double the curry and add black pepper, and ginger and more salt.

This was utterly delicious. One comment: the term is "pulse" on the food processor. Seriously, just incredibly tasty, and fairly quick and easy to boot. Yum.

The colors are bold and cheerful w/ bright yellow eggs and green peas and red tomatoes. Used half cubed potatoes and half peas and a leek instead of green onions. Sauted the potato and leek on medium low until tender then added the defrosted peas. Also, I only used 1-1/2 tsp curry powder. It was quick to make. The chutney is very tasty!

I made this for a potluck dinner, and it was a hit. I substituted frozen edamame for the peas, which produced a slightly nuttier taste. We all liked it :)

This was delicious and easy. I didn't have frozen peas at hand so I subbed chickpeas instead, which turned out very tasty. Can't wait to try it again!

I thought this was just wonderful. The peas added a nice pop and the Indian seasonings were perfect.

really nice. Next time I'll desed the tomatoes and chop them by hand, though, and use less tomato.

GREAT, easy fast and tasty!!!! i increased the ginger and garlic in the chutney and decreased the oil in the eggs. also omitted the cheese (i cant have dairy) and made my own curry spice blend. my father who NEVER eats eggs at night had 3 helpings!

This is a great recipe for a quick breakfast style meal. However, it lacked some flavor. So I added turkey, mushrooms and spices to the onions and peas and I added more curry and some chili powder to the chutney. It's also very good with a dollop of sour cream along with the chutney.

it was a quick and easy dinner dish. I substituted za'atar and cumin for curry powder and I liked the flavor a lot. It reminds me of the green peas vegetable dish that is common to Gujarat.

I am always looking for a quick, easy vegetarian recipe, and while this wasn't terrible, it isn't a do-over. I found the chutney to be a bit too sweet, and I would cut the brown sugar down to 2 tsps. were I to make it again. The frittata itself was a very unattractive color (think vomit) due to the curry powder mixed with the eggs, and the peas bulging out of it didn't add to its visual appeal. I also found that for my taste, the frittata needed more salt than called for in the recipe. The whole thing was just weird for me, even though I love eggs, peas, tomatoes, and Indian food.

Very easy and good. It came out a little dry and I thought a little too light for a main dish. Maybe adding potatoes would help?

More peas, scallions, and curry! Otherwise, fast and great. I think I might steal this idea for scrambled eggs.

This is a great recipe. It's easy and delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the parmesean with the curry, but you can't directly taste the cheese, it's just a background note. The chutney is tangy and complex tasting. It pairs perfectly with the sweetness of the peas in the frittata. I used more green onions and peas than called for, and felt it needed it.
