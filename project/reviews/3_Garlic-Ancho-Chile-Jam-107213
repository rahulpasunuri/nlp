Excellent combination of ingredients and flavors; three favorite ingredients. I reduced the honey and used a fine red wine vinegar.

This is a very, very interesting spread that will surprise anyone. I made it for a Christmas party and everybody loved it. So far I have made three times already. It is wonderful spread on French bread and it goes well with tortilla chips and it will be great on chicken. It really is wonderful. If you like hot and spicy and sweet and sour. You will love this one.

Ancho flavor was overpowering. Didn't like the sweetness of the honey with the other flavors. It did have a nice consistency, though.
