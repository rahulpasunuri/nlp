Good recipe, not my favorite, but would use it again.

Every time I make this someone tells me it's the best salsa they've ever had. Perfect blend of flavors and heat. I usually soak the red onion in water for about ten minutes first so it doesn't overpower the other flavors.

This is a great recipe. I added a diced red bell pepper for color, roasted yellow corn, lime zest, and 2 tsp of cumin. It came out perfect.

This is great. Depending on the fire in your jalapenos, it can get VERy spicy. Depending on your and your guests perspectives on spiciness, add the peppers gradually and maybe serve some on the side. Yummy and very refreshing.
