It really is that easy. This is a great set of directions, that are as s clear and simplified as you'll find. Buttering the pumpkin is not necessary.

I used three, six-pound sugar pumpkins and saved a lot of time by using the microwave. Each half cooked in the microwave for 15 minutes. If you have a food processor, use it instead of a blender to make your puree. It's so much easier, and I didn't need to add any liquid. I cleaned out my sink and lined it with an old tea towel. As each batch of puree finished in the food processor, I dumped it onto the towel in the sink. When all batches were complete, I pulled up the sides of the towel and twisted the top until liquid began to drain. I placed the towel full of the puree in a strainer in the sink and periodically squeezed out more liquid, scraping it from the sides of the towel from the top, down. If you leave it overnight to drain, the puree should have voided most of the liquid.

Perfect puree! I found that a jelly strainer worked like a charm for the draining.

I agree with the cook from Amsterdam. The microwave is definitely the way to go. I pureed with my emulsion blender before straining. And then I strained the pumpkin through a cloth lined colander. It was fabulous!

This made a huge mess in my kitchen and there were more than a few curses thrown about. Also, I had a hard time getting the cooked pumpkin to blend, so my advice is to reserve all of the liquid that accumulates during baking and add it to the blender if needed. I eded up with several cups of puree for many recipes to come this season. Worth all the trouble.

I found the best way to drain the pumpkin after it was cooked was in a cloth dishtowel. I squeezed it periodically, let it drain some more, and squeezed it again until it was at the proper consistency. Afterwards, I soaked the towel in nonchlorine bleach and water before I washed it. The pumpkin color came out. Still, I probably wouldn't use my best dishtowel for this.

The microwave is a great idea, though using a colander to strain it might take a while. The water separates out after you blend it, also if you press down on the puree, the water will squeeze out and come to the top. Making it easy to pour off.

I agree with the cook from Amsterdam - cooking the pumpkin in the microwave is much easier. Thanks for the tip!

Why make it so complicated? Here is my easy way to make pumpkin puree. (It does not come in cans here in Europe, so I have no choice.) Cut the pumpkin in half and scoop out the seeds. Microwave it (one half at a time or both depending on your dish and microwave size) until it is soft. Scrape it off the skin and put into a fine sieve. Let it drain at least an hour - you'll see if it needs more draining by seeing how wet it is. Puree it in a blender or food processor. (I use one those hand-held blenders that you can stick in your bowl.) Spend more time and energy making the recipe which calls for puree!

I tried this on some left over pumpkins i had lying about the house. It came out nicely. I would say that forcing the puree through a colander to smooth it out is boring and time consuming, best to do it while watching TV. You definitely need to let it sit in a colander to drain overnight. I put a can of soda on top of the plastic wrap to make more water come out. Next, a fresh pumpkin pie

I loved the novel idea of straining off the extra water, as I like to cook with fresh pumpkin but never know how to modify the recipe for the more liquid version. I steamed the pumpkin instead of baking it to make a low-fat version. Also, I needed the steamer juice in the blender, so don't discard it too soon.

This was very easy and delicious. I used the puree in the Black Bean Pumpkin soup recipe. It was excellent. Don't forget to toast the seeds too.
