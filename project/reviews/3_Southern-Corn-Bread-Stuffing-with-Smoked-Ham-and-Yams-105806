While it is true that this isn't your typical stuffing, it is however quite unique and can stand on its own as a meal. We have had it every year since the recipe first appeared in BA, It's worth the extra time to make the corn bread from scratch! We didn't find it dry at all, in fact people commented on how moist it was!

I wanted to try a different stuffing for thanksgiving so I chose this one. I substituted boxed cornbread stuffing (time factor) and it was still good. The ham turned out too dry, maybe I overcooked. the yams were a nice addition, and it's a great way to incorporate them into the meal. My husband is somewhat picky but loved it(and he's honest!) Next time I will use fresh cornbread and maybe bacon instead of ham.

Made this for "southern" guests at Thanksgiving. It was tastey, but wasn't what I think for dressing. I think that I want bread, not cornbread for my stuffing. But was still tastey and good. My eight year old loved it.
