this is a very poorly written recipe even with the changes that epic. says it has made.

Rating: 2
The revised recipe layout is confusing. It would seem that section 1 pertains to the cherry filling while section 2 is for the crust. But the ingredients and amounts don't correspond to the text. You can easily make a mistake using this recipe. There is too much sugar for sweet cherries. Reduce by at least 1/2 cup. The cooking temp. is too high. Try reducing by 25 half way through cooking time. This would have been more interesting with sour cherries.
