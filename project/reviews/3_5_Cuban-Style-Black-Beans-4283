3.5 forks..only because I modified the recipe as recommended, but theses were an incredible success. I substituted red for green bell pepper, beer for the veggie broth, added cumin, and DO NOT leave out the sugar (necessary to cut any bitterness from the beer; it won't make the beans "sweet"). I also salted to taste, and mashed about 1/3 of the total beans to make them thicken. Finally, like most dishes, they taste much better the next day - just reheat on the stove.

As suggested by others, used 2tsp cumin rather than oregano, red reather than green peppers, added 2 bay leaves, and used beer rather than water/broth. Did use sugar as beer was bitter. Made as a side with a southwest lime chicken and lemon rice. Very good.

I added 2 bay leaves, 1/2 teas red pepper, 2 teas cumin, substituted chicken broth for the veggie and took a previous reviewer's advice to use a red pepper instead of a green. Came out well. I've made this recipe previously as originally written, but I greatly prefer it with these modifications.

I was desperite to find tasty dishes when my hubby went vegetarian. He also likes flavorful food. This fit the bill and lasted us all week long. I garnished with pico di gallo and sour cream. I served home-made tortillas on the side. Planning on making this again for the weekend. Highly recommend!

This was very bland. It did not need any sugar and a squeeze of lime and some cumin and perhaps chili powder would have perked it up as well as some chopped cilantro.

Being Cuban, I resisted calling Abuela and checked with Yahoo instead. Since this was always a stable around our house, like white rice by the pallat load, it always went a bit unappreciated. I had to add my own touch- definately the cumin- I added one potatoe, one carrot, one mild Italian sausage, a little thyme and omitted the green pepper. The taste is excellent and a bit more hardy for a rainy day soup treat. I also like to sprinke a a chopped hard-boiled eggs nd a little lemon upon serving for zest! Not entirely Cuban but certainly delightful!

I thought this was great over rice; however, I did make some minor adjustments. I substituted 1 cup of white wine (cheap but good white wine not cooking wine) for the 3/4 cup canned vegetbl broth or water. I like spicey food so I also added one fresh jalapeno pepper (without the seeds). I also added cumin (even though I had already included oregano as directed) and 2 bay leaves. I used 4 cans of beans instead of 3. And I think that this is very important . . . I let it cook for about an hour until it got nice and thick. I did not add the sugar as I did not want to sweeten it and though theh cider vinegar did a good enough job. I think it would have been incredibly bland without either the white wine or the cider vinegar so I urge people to try it with both. It was AWESOME!

I followed the recipe exactly, just made less of it. The only thing I added was hot sauce to taste. Delicious and simple, a hearty meal for a rainy night. Better on day #2.

Delicious! I echo the feedback about the bay leaves and 2 tsp of cumin. Further suggestions: Use red bell pepper instead of green - lends a nice mild sweet note. Use 1/2 bottle beer instead of water, just add more beer if you need to as you go. Add 1/2 cup (or roughly one sausage worth) of browned ground spicy italian sausage. Add a fourth can of beans to the recipe--it's just as delicious with everything else in the exact same proportions. I'm of the opinion that this needs to be cooked a lot longer than 15 minutes for it to be really good-- ninety at a minimum to really get it thick and tasty. Just keep it on low heat, keep scraping the bottom of the pot, and add a bit of beer if you need to. Serve with medium grain rice and garnish with chopped cilantro and chopped avocado. You could easily make it a day ahead of time and just re-heat it before serving. A grilled italian sausage is a good complement, but honestly it's tasty enough to eat straight from the pot on its own. :-)

I have made this a number of times and everyone really enjoys it. Easy and quick. Usually I've made it with puerco asado and lime rice. Yum!

I didn't have gbp on hand, and I used all "Cuban" ingredients except for mincing half a Serrano pepper for some heat. The taste was off until I added both the vinegar and the sugar - then it was fine. My fault, I overcooked the beans because I started my rice too late. Served with slow roasted pork with lime mojo from this site. Nice dinner, not my favorite, with some tweaks (something was missing IMHO) it may get added to the rotation, though I rarely cook something the same way twice. I prefer the journey... :) Thanks to all the reviewers, I learn something from every note you add.

One other thing- I added the cumin as suggested. It was key!

I substituted thyme for oregano (it's what I had) and made this for my Cuban family. They loved it! It's right on par with abuela. And, as another reviewer said-- Yes this is Cuban, not what you'd find in a Mexican restaurant.

This was a tasty side dish for the pork loin with lime mojo on Christmas night. The beans were a total hit! We used the suggestions made by other reviewers: sub cumin for oregano, add cilantro, and sub anaheim peppers for jalapeno. (I'm pregnant and my parents are old.) The result was incredible. As mentioned, don't skip the vinegar. It's the tang that makes these so delish!

This was excellent. I took the tips from other reviewers (cumin, cilantro) and loved it!

This was very tasty. I added cumin, as suggested, plus chili powder, chipotle Tabasco, and fresh lime juice (used a bit less apple cider vinegar). I also added one bunch of chopped scallions, and some chopped kale for nutrition. The broth was really delicious and I would definitely make this again.

Have made this recipe a couple of times. It is absolutely delicious. I only gave it 3 forks, because I had to make some adjustments. First, definitely sub out cumin for oregano, and i used the bunch of cilantro which made it terrific. I also used bacon grease instead of olive oil once and it was great, but the olive oil is good too. I also will halve the amount of onions since I and my husband are not big onion fans and this has a boatload in it. I will be keeping this recipe in my file.

As a Cuban, I took a chance making this instead of just asking my mother. And, it was EXCELLENT. Although, authentic Cuban black bean would have the beans soak instead of using canned beans.

Made this as accompaniment to Layered Chicken Enchiladas with Tomatillo-Cilantro sauce and we did not like this bean recipe. Quite a disappointment after the high rating and good reviews. As suggested, I added cumin and 4 bay leaves.

I used the tied together cilantro while simmering, added bay leaves and substituted cumin for the oregano. This was the way to go. Couldn't imagine it without the cumin. I also added a few sprigs of cilantro as garnish and had chopped cilantro as a side. A friend who loves cuban food absolutely raved about the dish. It was easy to prepare and went great with Jerk Chicken.

Very easy recipe! I added a serrano pepper, cumin & chipolte powder to add some extra flavor. I'll be using these during the week for taco salads. Yum!

This is 4 forks with the modifications others have listed, otherwise it was bland. I added 4 Turkish bay leaves, 1 tsp ground cumin and 1 minced serrano pepper(minus the seeds and membranes) to the listed ingredients. Terrific with white rice!

This is a good basic black beans recipe, but I agree that cumin and bay leaf are essential. I also add in a small amount of thyme and a bit of cayenne. While simmering, I add a few stems from a bunch of cilantro (I tie them together with string to pull out easily after its done). I serve it with an optional bit of chopped green onions and a bit of cilantro for an extra kick if diners want to add to the top. After making it once, I couldn't deny my southern roots and added a small ham hock and simmered it for a longer time period and it was great (although not vegetarian anymore.) I also had made some creole spice rubbed pork chops one night and found I had a couple left over. I chopped them up an used them in this recipe, and the extra seasonin was also very good.

I cut this recipe in 1/3's, using only one can of black beans to serve as a side dish for me and my fiance. We fought over who would get the left overs for lunch the next day! Yummy!

Great recipe, but for an authentic Cuban recipe, omit the oregano (Cubans don't use oregano much, it is mostly used in Puerto Rico) and ground cumin is a must. I have never seen a Cuban make beans without cumin......

Made this exactly as the recipe states except for the addition of chicken-habanero sausage to make it more of a main meal and it was delicious served over rice. I think it's the vinegar that really makes the dish.

My own additions included 3-4 slices of chopped pancetta and about 1/2 of a dried reconstituted ancho chile. If you go with the latter, use the chile soaking liquid to supplement the broth if the beans are too dry.

The texture of the beans were fine but the flavor was very bland. Although this may be a decent base recipe I would make some flavorful additions if I were to make this again.

I modified this dish slightly and my non bean eating husband gobbled these up! Instead of olive oil I sauted 3 slices of bacon ( diced) then added the onions and garlic I didn't have any green pepper but it was still flavorful. Served this with roasted corn off the cob white rice and chicken I had marinated in a lime & garlic.

I debated giving it one fork but to be fair, I haven't had Cuban beans and wasn't sure what to expect. Added tomato, cilantro and cumin as suggested by some and still failed the taste test. Kept adding until I finally had something more like vegetarian chili. At least I salvaged the dish.

I served these beans to a group of 60 last Friday night and received numerous requests for the recipe. I also served the Roast Pork Cubano (see comments there), so used the Latin Spice Mixture instead of the cumin recommended in the reviews. Also used dried beans because of the quantity.

To make these 4 star, add some cumin. I always add jalapeno's or red pepper flakes as well to spice them up. My husband (whose parents were from Central America and grew up eating lots of wonderful beans) absolutely LOVES these!

I left the beans in the pot while I was cooking my other entrees and they became stewlike, so I served them in ramekins to my guests and they loved them. I doubled the cilantro, used linguisa instead of the less firm chorizo stocked by my market, and added a little chili sauce for flavor. Nearly every guest asked me for the recipe afterwords. I'll definitely make it again.

Best black beans I've ever had. Definitely add the cumin and bay leaves, and I personally don't use the optional sugar. I did add a dash of chipotle chile powder and 2 tbsp of cilantro-based recaito. Really, really good.

I'm Cuban descendant and I can tell you this will be the best beans you'll ever have. Make sure you follow Anel's suggestion in order to have the authentic dish. Don't use any type of broth at all, just use water. Cumin and bay leaves are main ingredients in Cuban food. And most important of all, don't skip the vinegar that's what really make's the dish. Serve them over steamed white rice and sweet fried plantains on the side and enjoy.

I added all the ingredients with the suggestions from previous submissions, specifically, 4 bayleaves and about 1/8 tsp. ground , dried cumin. I used a vegetarian chicken broth and had to add an additional 3/4 cup water to keep the mixture from burning. I simmered for an hour and served over brown rice. Truely exciting and yummy. I served this with Pork Tenderloin Cubano.
