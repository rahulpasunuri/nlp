Made this last week for my family, and had to make it again this week for a party! The first time I halved the batch and it still turned out perfect; I used the same size cookie sheet and only spread it halfway. The second time I made it it was a little less golden but still tastes amazing. So easy and good!

Totally unthrilled. I threw the whole batch away (very rare when it comes to chocolate and toffe!). I'm not sure if I messed it up, or it was supposed to be like that. Either way, the toffee was not hard enough and it tasted too much like I was putting a pad of butter in my mouth.

If it separates you can usually add a bit of water to get it to come back together. (google: toffee troubleshooting) Its a common issue with toffee in general. Also, make sure you use SALTED butter, or it will not work out. I use this recipe EVERY year for Xmas toffee and EVERY year it comes out Perfect!!!!!

excellent! came out exactly how i wanted it to. instead of a baking sheet i poured it onto a marble slab. it pulled right off and set very quickly. i was a little worried when i saw it breaking, but once i poured it and spread it out, it was fine. time to triple this recipe, and sell it.

Easy and delicious. We poured out the toffee on a silpat rather than on a baking sheet...it didn't stick a bit and was much easier to seperate from the toffee. Next time I'm going to use toasted coconut with the nuts.

horrible. used a candy thermometer for accuracy and at 300F it separated and was useless. I've made peanut brittle before and had no problems. This was a waste of good butter!

Great treat! I only added chocolate to one side, and didn't add water at all. This seemed to be the right consistency and thickness of toffee for the specified size pan, all though admittedly unhealthier.

Made this candy for the holidays. Everyone thought it was so tasty and delicious! Only 2 problems-the walnuts didn't stick well to the chocolate and it is important to keep the candy refridgerated until ready to eat as the chocolate will melt on contact if left out.

I got rave reviews over this dessert. Everyone loved it and I found it fairly easy to make. Although, using cookie sheets with edges on them (not the airbake type) may be preferable. My first batch wanted to run off the edge.

Simply delicious! I would add some vanilla extract to make it even better, but it's very good as is.

This was delicious. I would use a larger pan next time however, as the candy part was too thick.
