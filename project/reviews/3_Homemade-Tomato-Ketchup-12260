This is the best. You'll never want to go back to regular ketchup. I use it with a sloppy joe recipe from an earlier Gourmet and it is FABULOUS. The recipe is not on this site so I'll give it here Saute 1 lb ground chuck with 1/2 c chopped onion. Stir in 1cup ketchup; 1 tablespoon (each) white vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauch, dark brown sugar; 1 teaspoon (each) Dijon mustard, paprika; salt and pepper to taste. Cook uncovered until thickened, about 30 minutes. Divide among 4 hamburger buns

As an Atkins dieter, I wanted to try this as an alternative to commercial ketchup, which is loaded w/ corn syrup. I substituted Splenda in place of the sugar & omitted the Tabasco (since when does ketchup have Tabasco in it?). The only time consuming part of the recipe is forcing the puree thru a food mill, but overall, I was amazed at how good this tastes! I'm also going to use this in homemade BBQ sauce. Yummy!

tried twice, once as ketchup, once to be different. everyone hated as ketchup, but as something different, it was so-so. at least no one complained when i served it. they did note that it tasted like a sweetened tomato sauce. not what you're probably looking for. keep looking.

Easy to follow instructions. A cocktail sauce that reminds one of the better seafood houses of the 40's and 50's. Excellent.

I was a wee bit skeptical at first as it appeared a bit too sweet, but 1/2 way through the reduction process (I used home grown tomatoes; Hence it had more liquid)....but much to ,my family's and my elation, it was perfect for the 4th of July festivities. Even the non-ketchup eaters gobbled it down!
