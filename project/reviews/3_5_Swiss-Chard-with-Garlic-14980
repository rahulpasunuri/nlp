I really enjoyed this! I added a little sprinkling of Parmesan and pepper at the end in lieu of salt and it really made my fresh from the market chard shine! My boyfriend hates spinach but ate this up - I think the cheese helped.

How can something so simple taste so rich and look so beautiful - I used rainbow chard and garnished with lemon.

None leftover! I prepared this before Thanksgiving dinner and it was a delicious hit when reheated & served a couple of hours later.

Very simple and tasty with lemon chicken on a blustery autumn evening...

We make this at home OFTEN. Generally, while the chard is cooking we add either some soy sauce or Bragg's liquid aminos for flavoring. Occasionally, we'll add a touch of cayenne pepper to spice it up.

I cooked this in advance and reheated it. So simple, so classical. The slightly acid flavor, with garlic and oil, perfectly balanced a pork roast. I think the first fall frost helped the flavor.

This was very simple and quick to prepare. I sauted about a 1/4 cup of red onion (sliced lengthwise in strips) and added 2 cloves of garlic, the results were quite good. As a vegetarian, I served this as my main dish with sliced grape tomatoes over a bed of brown rice which even my meat and potato boyfriend enjoyed.

This has become a Thanksgiving tradition here and the family loves it. This year I added a few sauteed pignolis and it was good choice to liven up the dish. Leftovers go nicely into the inevitable post-Thanksgiving turkey soup.

I made this with some multi-colored chard I found at our local super market. I added a little diced red pepper for color, and a squeeze of lemon at the end. Excellent accompaniment to fish (I served it with a roasted sea bass, sweet potato gnocchi, balsamic-red wine reduction, and a drizzle of basil-infused olive oil atop the fish, just for kicks). I have also mixed this recipe with pasta, a little more olive oil, and some prociutto.
