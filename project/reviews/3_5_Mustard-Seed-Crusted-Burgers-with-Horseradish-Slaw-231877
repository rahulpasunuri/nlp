Wait! Do I see a slice of tomato and Spanish onion in this picture? No mention of it in recipe . . .

Delicious, but I'm still toying with this recipe. No bitterness if you crush your own mustard seeds--leave coarse (don't use "cracked mustard seeds"). Use at least an extra cup of lettuce for this much dressing. Use 1 more T of horseradish; I'm going to try even more the next time.

i don't know why this recipe isn't rated higher than it is so far...i made it and my whole family loved it. all the ingredients work well together and the slaw that goes on top is great to eat by itself. everything works together for a fantastic hamburger. i highly recommend it!!

I've already made this one several times! What a great twist on an old favorite. I used a small head of Boston lettuce instead of the iceburg and made quick work of crushing the mustard seeds by buzzing them in my cuisinart mini-prep.

beware! there are food censors watching. the 'humorous' reviews have been deleted. i understand that epic is about food. in my family, food is also about life. also, in my family, life is about having a good time of it. epic and the NYC reviewer obviously don't agree. this recipe was good. but the review i gave it was deleted (the one mentioned by NYC, the "smoker"). hope you can read this message before they get rid of it....

Im going to try to make a veggie version of this and get back to you. BTW, what is that cook from NYC smoking? What an antagonistic review.

OK, So I'm guessing there was a tech error, and the recipe didn't show up? I see it now, at least. Regardless, does that mean that all the dim wits out there in Epicurious-land have to think they are being clever by attempting to make jokes about "no carbs," or "so simple" etc. Don't you think that if your sophomoric brains can come up with these lame attempts at humor, then everyone who came across this error could do the same? The art is finding humor in the not-so-obvious.

what a waste of prime beef! mustard crust was bitter. dressing was so so. never again.

Good overall recipe. I award the three forks for the slaw alone. It is light and deliciously peppy with many other possible applications, such as in a corned beef or grilled salmon sandwich or as a garnish for a fish taco.

I really enjoyed this dish.I usually don't like horseradish but it was good in the burgers it didn't have a overpowering taste.
