I prepared this recipe for a dinner with my 82-years-old-difficult-to-please aunt. She loved it (as well as my mom and myself). A keeper!

I made this exactly as written last night using a mixture of Cox Orange Pippins and Cortland apples but was disappointed with the taste. The apple flavor was overwhelmed by the the lemon and vanilla, possibly the raisins too. I agree it is a very sweet pie. Next time I am going to cut the raisins, lemon zest and vanilla in half and add some nuts to the crumb crust. I think I will also either use my favorite crust recipe or make this one using half butter and half butter flavored Crisco. The crust was tougher than my crusts usually are.

The filling and topping for this pie was so delicious! I used about 3/4 cup golden raisins which worked well. For some reason, the crust came out a bit "hard", maybe because it bakes for so long? I will try using my own pie crust recipe next time. I also like the suggestion someone made of soaking the raisins in rum. I think that would be yummy!

I thought this pie was absolutely delicious. Following previous recommendations, I did reduce the raisins to 1/2 cup, but I thought they were a wonderful addition despite the fact that I'm not even much of a raisin fan. Highly recommended!

I have made this a few times now, and it's a family favorite! I did cut the amount of raisins to 1/2 cup, and I have found it works great with purchased pie crust. For a more grown-up version, try soaking the raisins in some dark rum - sooo yummy!

really tasty pie! I agree that I will cut back on the raisins next time around. I added 1/2 cup toasted chopped walnuts to the crumb topping for a crunch and taste that works well against the sweetness of the filling.

I substituted dried cherries for the raisins. Excellent flavor

I should have read the reviews first. I found it much too sweet even cutting the brown sugar back 1/2 C. I will cut the rasins as well next time. It was pretty good though.

The crust was similar to my mom's, but with the food processor, much easier. Overall, we found the filling much too sweet.

I substituted dried cranberries instead of raisins and only used 1/2 cup and it turned out great. I would recommend taking the extra time to make the crust (it was fantastic and pretty easy overall)

My husband loved this pie, especially the crust. I cut the raisins in half based on the other reviews, and thought it was perfect. The raisins add a little extra flavor, and get plump and juicy from the apples' natural juices. I used cortland apples, also firm and tart; they were a great substitute.

I made this with a store bought crust from Whole Foods and I used 1/2 cup of currants as another reviewer suggested. The cinnamon taste is great. I won a bake off at my work and a $75 gift certificate--pretty good for a first time recipe :)

Really, really good. To save time instead of gathering dough into ball and then rolling it, just press it right into the pie plate.

Made this from the magazine, using purchased crust and even then it was way too sweet and just gloopy. A regular pie would have tasted much better-- and been less work. I wouldn't even bother to modify it.

Delicious - the best I've made in a long time! I didn't add the raisins after reading the other reviews and I'm not crazy about them to begin with. It came out perfect (baked for 90 minutes). My boyfriend can hardly wait for the next one!

The house smelled heavenly while baking this pie! I thought the crust was flaky and buttery and came out perfect. I agree that the raisins overpowered the 'apple-ness' of the pie and will most likely reduce the amount next time. I think I may have overdosed on the salt, too...eek! But overall, great apple pie which my husband LOVED over his moms!!

This crust was the most successful I have ever made, didn't fall apart when I transfered to pie plate. Pie was hearty and good.

This recipe confused me. Was I supposed to bake it 40 minutes add the topping and then bake it for 50 more minutes, or bake it an additional 10 minutes for a total of 50 minutes? 90 minutes seems like a long time to bake a pie.

I served this at a dinner party and everyone loved it. I used currants rather than large raisins and used a mixture of three types of apples. Once I mixed the apples in the spice mixture I let them drain for about 25 minutes to get the excess liquid out. Came out perfect. Not too juicy and not dry. My husband can't wait for another pie.

I'm rating this two forks because of potential. This may be an excellent pie without the raisins, but they were all you could taste. All six apple pie fans were disappointed in this pie.

The technique was unusual--cooking the filling for 40 minutes before piling on the crumb topping--and it turned out fantastic. But the raisins overwhelmed the flavor, making it taste more like mince pie than apple pie. My apple pie fan was very disappointed. The cinnamon in the crumb and filling was delicious, though, and smelled incredible while baking. I'll make this again, but will eliminate the raisins altogether.
