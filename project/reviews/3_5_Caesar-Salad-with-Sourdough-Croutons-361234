Like some others, I had high hopes for this recipe based on the reviews. While I was a bit concerned the flavors would be lacking without the egg, I thought I'd try it anyway. Sadly, I was very unimpressed with this recipe. I thought it lacked flavor and was nothing like the delicious caesar salad you get table side in a great steak house.

I was excited about this recipe given the reviews. While I was a bit concerned it wouldn't be the same without egg in it, I thought I'd try anyway. Very disappointed. This recipe lacks flavor and is nothing like a true caesar made table side at a great steakhouse.

I had such high hopes for this dressing, based on the forks & the raving reviews. Sadly, it disappointed. Maybe I should have gone with my gut and used more garlic, but I found it a bit weak & lacking in "oomph".

Yummy! This was great. I skipped the anchovies and made croutons out of Garlic frozen Texas Toast. Everyone loved it!

Here's a better Crouton method that I learned years ago. - drizzle evoo in small baking dish. Chop up your bread (sourdough in this case) and stir around to coat with evoo. Bake until golden brown - stirring about every 5 mins. Immediately after taking out of oven, grate fresh Parmesan over the crutons & shake some Italian dry seasoning over - stir and put back in the oven for like 3 mins to allow the cheese to melt. These are very yummy - everyone raves about my Crutons.

Numm...only had anchovy paste, so I used about 1 Tbls. of the paste. We are camping and I sliced up a piece of grilled chicken breast. I will definitely make this again.

This is one of my favorite salad recipes, exact measurement is important - to much lemon juice and it's sour - one evening I didn't have anchovy's, so I used a small can of water packed tuna...wow, what a surprise of how good it turned out- for the croutons, i just toss the bread with salt, olive oil & salt - once out of the oven, I toss with grated parmesan cheese

Excellent with the right ingredients: crisp, organic romaine, fresh garlic and the best parmesan cheese. The sourdough croutons are great.

This is a perfect Caesar Salad! The only one I will make from here on out. My husband loved the sourdough croutons because they were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. Make sure to use the best sourdough bread you can find and make the croutons that day so they're very fresh! The dressing is nice and garlicky and we love anchovies.
