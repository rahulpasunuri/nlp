This is a wonderful recipe. I increased all the ingredients and served it as a light entree for a simple dinner party. Served a lovely consomme as a first course, and ended with a very rich dessert... bananas foster with bananas from my garden. Even with the rich dessert, this meal left us completely satisfied , but not stuffed.

My husband & I both thought this was outstanding. I substituted balsamic vinegar for the sherry vinegar. I used chicken andouille sausage and cut the slices into quarters. I will definitely be making this for an upcoming dinner party. I plan to make the dressing & cook the scallops & sausage before they arrive and briefly reheat when ready to serve.

Outstanding! I wouldn't change a thing, unless it would be to cook more scallops. Slightly less than a pound was perfect for the two of us as a light dinner. The key is to use good scallops. Even though I didn't use "dry" scallops, I bought them from a very good fish market and they didn't give up a drop of moisture. They were very sweet and the sausage complimented the scallops nicely. No problem with them sticking to the pan. It's necessary to put them in a hot skillet and not move them until they have browned.

The sausage added wonderful flavor to the scallops. I had a problem with scallops sticking to the pan, though. Also, I didn't have shallots and used onions and had toss the dressing into the blender to smooth out the onion chunks, and the dressing turned out fabulous.

Tres magnifique! I made this twice. Used 2 T white wine vinegar and 1T sherry (didn't want to buy sherry vinegar for just this recipe - I cooked off the alcohol first), and used lamb merguez sausage (hot!). The second time I put the scallops and sausage on a bed of lightly sauteed spinach with garlic in olive oil. Good either way. My guests were delighted, and it was so easy. (Actually, the second time it was dinner a deux as a light main course.)

I'm not sure what all the hubub is about for this recipe but I found it to be quite a train wreck. Flavors did not compliment each other well. Quite a waste of some nice scallops and andouille. Would not consider making again.

This is a fantastic appetizer as well as a great meal on it's own. I chose to use spinach rather than mixed greens, the spinach wilts a bit under the scallops, but I think it has a great texture that way. Absolutely try this recipe!

I used kielbasa instead of the andouille and it was delicious- so easy and the combination of flavors was great! I would definitely make this again, but with some modifications, e.g., I would significantly cut down the amount of olive oil in the vinaigrette because it was a bit too oily for my taste. Otherwise, this one's a keeper!

The dressing on this salad is divine and I will use it again and again. I will also make this dish again, but use less andouille next time. I found that the large frozen scallops from Trader Joe's were perfect for this dish.

This is a lovely dish. The combination of the scallop and the spicey sausage is wonderful. It makes a nice presentation on the mixed greens

This recipe is fantastic if you are on the Atkins (or any other low carbohydrate diet). It is absolutely delicious. The combination of rich scallops and sausage, on top of healthy light baby greens is perfect.

I made this dish for my friends for a special occasion & it turned out great. I used portuguese sausage instead of andouille. They want me to make it again soon.
