Note re: the NON DAIRY VERSION Taking all previous comments into account, this recipe resulted in a superior no-milk custard sauce (utilizing both zest methods simultaneously). I doubled the recipe to be safe; however, next time I will increase the amount of soy/rice milk, since both seem to reduce significantly more than ordinary milk.

I used a peeler to get the zest (but it didn't come in a 1x4" strip). Next time I would possibly use a zester and just leave it in the sauce. Also, this sauce can be made nondairy by using soymilk (for those with religious, dietary or health concerns about dairy). You really can't tell the difference.

Orange zest is exactly that, the peel without the bitter white or pith part!

Just to be sure of myself, would someone please explain what the orange zest is? This probably sounds like a dumb question, but is it just a strip of orange peel? Thanks!
