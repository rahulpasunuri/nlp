Delicious! I did not have the kumquats, so I skipped that part. Didn't miss them. This was quite simple and my picky husband raved about it. Looking forward to making it again!

Made without the kumquats and didn't mind it. My pork didn't turn out as crispy on the outside as the photo shows. I would recommend using fresh rosemary instead of dried.

Check out: http://www.sciabica.com if you are looking for the olive oil that Gemma Sciabica used in this recipe. I know, I know, it's a shameless plug...

I made this recipe for a valentine's dinner. Everyone wanted the recipe! It was great. I didn't make any changes, except to make an extra one to freeze for a later date. Raves all around. It took me more than 30 minutes to make it because of pitting all those kumquats, but it was definitely worth the effort.

This is my grandmother's recipe (Gemma Sciabica). I am glad that so many people like it, it's one of my favorites. Just wish Epicurios would list Sciabica's Olive Oil :)

ok ok I didn't follow the recipe exactly - I used fresh figs and dried cherries that I had rehydrated in sherry - but the rest was the same and it turned out great - so its a good recipe with many kinds of fruit - be creative with what's in the fruit bowl!

We wanted a non-traditional XMAS day dinner, so I made this. I seasoned the meat with the rosemary, salt, and pepper the night before and refrigerated it until cooking time. Then Hubby seared the loins on a gas BBQ grill on high for just a few minutes while I made the onion/fruit mixture. We put the meat and sauce in a shallow casserole dish and finished it in the oven, as directed. (Did sub 3/4 tsp. dried rosemary for the fresh, 5/8 cup red onion for the shallots, and orange segments for the kumquats.) This dish was absolutely OUTSTANDING!!!

Fantastic! My favorite way to serve pork loin. A great combination of flavors and aromas. Worked out fine with thawed cranberries. Tried several variations of fruits. I'll be serving this for one of the entries at Christmas Dinner.

This was delicious, my family enjoyed it also. Leftovers were even better next day. I had just bought kumquats so my kids could try them.I decided to make this recipe since the store had kumquats. Wouldn't you know, when I went back they were all out! I substituted with tangerine sections and zest. The tangerines sort of disintegrated. Next time kumquats are available I will make this again. I also browned this in a non stick skillet and then transferred it to an oven proof dish as another cook did since I do not have an oven proof skillet. I would not describe this dish as easy or time saving, too many steps for that, but it is well worth making. Very delicious and different. Fruit and pork are a great combination. A great cold weather dinner.

Do not be misled by the low general rating of this recipe. This dish is fit for a sumptuous banquet!! We have two teenage children who have travelled the world and do not mind turning up their noses at uninteresting meals. They nearly licked their plates for this dish. To my astonishment, our local grocer carried both fresh kumquats & cranberries. This was so delicious that I hope to organize a dinner party just to share this along with other favorites that we have collected with our friends & neighbours.

I'm in the Coast Guard and serve a crew of 22, I made this recipe and it was delicious, tender, and juicy, a big hit. They guys were a little doubtful at first because of the fruit but they loved it. I didn't find the qumquats so I just used the frozen cranberries and the rest were dried fruit mix I found in the vegie-fruit isle.

We loved this recipe and will definately make it again. Could not find fresh or frozen cranberries, so used dried, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.

I made this pretty much as specified, except that I could not find fresh or frozen cranberries,so I used dried. I also used less rosemary, out of personal preference. I thought it was easy and delicious and would make this again.

Last night we had a large portion of the leftovers. It was as good, if not better, than the first night. Since we are a family of 2, I will use the rest of the leftover meat for a nice stir-fry. I would have to say that this makes 5 large servings, not 6. YUMMY.

I love this recipe. It was fairly simple to prepare, and the results were amazing. I used fresh apples instead of dried, fresh cranberries, and raisins (it's what i had in the house). It's my boyfriend's new favorite. I made it three weeks ago, and he's still talking about it.

My husband is from a small town (about 2000) in northern Michigan. Their small grocery store has all of this in stock.

Prepared this for a dinner party and it was a big hit. Like the other review, I will use more fruit and wine next time to increase the quantity of sauce and substitute the kumquats with citrus fruit. This dish is a tasty simple dinner that tastes great at this cool time of year!

I just wanted to encourage the cook from Texas to not be so limited in their thinking. Everyone can find apples and dried fruit and wine - none of it has to be expensive either - except maybe the pork...Get some chepo wine from the grocery store, you can dry the apples yourself in the oven - or not - and if Kumquats are hard to come by, try regular orange or some other fruit, dried apricot, or even raisins... if you can't get fresh rosemery, use dried or grow your own in a pot in the kitchen. As for the effort involded in the preparation: I have prepeared microwave meals that require more effort, skill and time. If you're crusing Epicurious you must have some culinary curiosity, expand, explore and have fun, improvise, adapt,no recipie is written in stone...wishing you well :)

did not make this dish -- ingredients required not easily obtainable in rural America-- Stated as easy to make, but in reality would only be easy to professional chefs or households with abundant food budgets.

this is a keeper - I made it last weekend and I will make it again this weekend except I will double the sauce. My family totally enjoyed this meal. This is an amazing recipe.

This was good and I would make again but I had some omissions in the recipe that changed things a bit. I didn't have cranberries or kumquats so I skipped them. I added 1/2 package of assorted dried fruit bits (DelMonte brand) and it was good. I would make again.

I substituted fresh apples for the dried apples and tangelo sections for the kumquats and it was still quite tasty.
