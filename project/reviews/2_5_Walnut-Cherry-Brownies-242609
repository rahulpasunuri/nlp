This recipe sounded great, but I wish I had checked the reviews first. It came out very dry despite cooking it the minimum amount of time. You know it's not a hit when a chocolate-loving kid won't even finish one. I won't be making it again.

These were fantastic and not dry at all-- just sweet & rich enough to be the perfect satisfying little treat. I used Bing cherries and they went fabulously with the chocolate. If you thought these weren't sweet enough, then use bittersweet chocolate (instead of unsweetened). If you thought they were too dry, then don't bake them for so long.

I tend to agree that these were on the dry side and not very sweet. However, they were pretty good and I think the idea of putting dried tart cherries and toasted walnuts together in brownies is a good one. I liked that they were not overly sweet, and I noticed that the part near the center of my pan was not dry---indicating that perhaps they could have been cooked less. Still, the best advice is probably to take your favorite brownie recipe and add cherries and walnuts if you think that sounds appealing to you.
