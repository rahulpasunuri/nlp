Have to agree with previous reviewers - less butter and more pepper. Otherwise it's a great recipe. Went quickly last night with cocktails.

Took others suggestions and modified--I have a working product for "Elegant Endive" (this is a component of that GREAT app!). 1. 1 T butter 2. 1 T BROWN sugar 3. 1/4 t cayenne pepper (yes, that much) melt butter and brown sugar for 1-2 min, add pepper, stir well to mix, THEN add nuts. Since they are already roasted, cook additional 2 min but keep heat on med low--mainly to coat well. Turn onto parchment paper to cool. Spread them out. If you taste them plain, they have a very nice kick. On the "elegant endive" with the gorganzola and honey, they are a wonderful balance.

I left out a third of the butter in this recipe and still found it WAY too greasy.

These were really great, but I agree with the other posts, you could use less butter. I also used waaaay more spice than the recipe called for but they came out great.

I made these for a cocktail party and people went mad for them! You could use a little less butter than the recipe calls for, although I made them the night before and they didn't seem overly buttered the next day. Also, if you want them spicier, you will need to use more cayenne than indicated.

This is an excellent and quick recipe. Like the other reviewers next time I will use less butter. And the idea of adding cinnamon sounds perfect.

Next time I will use less butter, more cayenne & roast on a cookie sheet in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes ... as recommended above. And maybe less sugar/honey as well. Also, if I'm doing the elegant endive recipe, I'll buy chopped nuts instead to save time. I used a mix of walnuts & pecans and liked the variety.

These were fantastic! Used them on the Elegant Endive recipe as suggested and they were delicious. Also had made extra nuts, used them in salad and kept some around to pick on. Everyone loved them. Will make again and again!

Recipe needs some more pepper and a little less butter, and I ended up toasting them in a 350 degree oven for about 15 minutes.
