I've made this a few times - took a few tries to get the tapping with the spoon and marbling just right, but now they come out perfectly. Definitely leave them to soak overnight. Just served them as a Halloween appetizer, added 1 Tbsp wasabi mustard (note wasabi mustard, not pure wasabi) to the dipping sauce and it was just fantastic - a huge hit!

The BF found this recipe, not having any prior experience or knowledge, just liking the description (and, the enticing pic). I, however, grew up in Taiwan where the "Tea Leaf Egg" is common - childhood memories of Mom buying these from a street vendor, etc. This isn't the sort of thing people would make at home for themselves or for company. So, I was somewhat amused seeing this selection. The dipping in mayonnaise is a radical departure from the "authentic" version - there is no such thing. The egg, traditionally done, can hold its own. Darker and tougher, it should be very flavorful, fragrant, with great texture. In this version (which the editor pointed out they modified), the egg does benefit from (rather, need) the mayonnaise mixture. The sauce is mouth-watering, even filtered through my fondness of the 'real thing'. We're not easy to please in general, and 'ethnic' recipes from sources other than where they originate are usually suspect, but by all means give this one a try.

Made deviled eggs with the mayo mixture and less cooking liquid instead of using as a dipping sauce. They were beautiful to look at and good to eat. As the previous reviewer mentioned, don't use very fresh eggs. Took forever to peel without damaging the marble look. Also, couldn't find Lapsang souchong tea so used Oolong instead.

This tasted fine - liked the mayo mixture, but the eggs "marbeling" was not as dark as I thought it should be. They sort of just looked with a few have faint spiderweb patterns. I know on a few I taped too hard and just got brown spots - but on others the proper pattern was there, just not very dark. I did soak the eggs for the reccomended time - the only sub I made was for the tea as I could not find that particular type. But I did use a strong black tea instead.

Wonderfully fun recipe to make and yields a beautiful result. Definitely a conversation piece at a party. I recommend "deviling" the yolks with the mayo dipping sauce and serving on the half shell for better ease in "finger food" serving. Tried with a chrysathemum green tea also, with less-favorable results than the lapsang souchong.

Make sure your eggs are not too fresh or they will be difficult to peel. I followed the recipe exactly up to the point of tapping the eggs all over with a spoon. For the second cooking, I simmered only for 3 minutes, however, because the eggs continue to cook as they cool in the soaking liquid. After they cooled to room temperature, I refrigerated them, tea bags and all, for about 6 hours. They were picture perfect and had no dark ring around the yolk. I changed the presentation. I shredded several kinds of lettuce and green onions and made little nests on individual plates. I used the same amount of mayonnaise, but instead of the soy sauce and cooking liquid, I added a tablespoon of Asian fish sauce, a tablespoon of lime juice and about 3/4 teaspoon of powdered wasabi. I placed the eggs in their lettuce nests and dabbed the dressing in three mounds equally spaced around the edge of each plate. This was the highlight of Easter dinner. Very different and delicious.

This also works if you leave out the tea -- a (Chinese) friend's mother makes it with just the soy sauce mixture.

Definitely need to let the eggs soak for more than two hours for maximum staining. We also found that the older eggs stained better than fresh. Great substitute for deviled eggs.
