I lost this recipe a few years ago and finally was able to track it down online. LOVE MAKING THIS FOR GUESTS. It makes you feel like you are eating a little healthy if you omit the clotted cream.

Always our favorite pancake recipe. I make these pancakes more than any other. Also good with greek yoghurt and jam.

Excellent and easy to make. Didn't have clotted cream, so I mixed creme fraiche and some half and half. Very nice.

I love this recipe, and have made it many times already. It's quick to assemble--almost as quick as using a prepared pancake mix--and the resulting griddle cakes are scrumptious! I have yet to make the compote, however. I just eat the cakes with either jam (Bonne Maman Blackberry Preserves are great with this) or honey. This has become one of my "staple" recipes.

This was fantastic! I doubled the recipe and added an extra Tbsp of sugar. It adds a sweet crispiness to the edges. I fried them in PAM and just another Tbsp of butter to cut down on the fat, and they were still rich. This is the only recipe in recent memory to elicit a "Delicious!" from my boyfriend AT the table. We'll definitely be substituing these for regular pancakes in the future. Served them with grilled Canadian bacon. Also mixed up dry ingredients separately from wet in 2 separate containers and took desert camping. Combined right before breakfast and they grilled up delicious in no time. Hey, why not eat gourmet in the wilds too?

I really like hoe cakes (made with cornmeal) so I thought I would try these griddle cakes. I really liked this recipe. I served it with melted butter and warmed strawberry preserves. I will definitely make them again.

I made the recipe as written, but served it with freshly whipped (no sugar) cream and blackberry jam. Husband and I both enjoyed it. Froze half of the cakes and had them another morning, reheated on a griddle. Husband said he though he liked them as well left over.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this recipe or the consistency of the batter unlike one rater here suggested. I tried this on my girlfriend on a lazy Saturday morning and it was exceptional. I used a reduced "apple marmalade" from my grandmother's recipe files and lightly dusted with a powdered sugar and finely ground cinnamon mix. They were perfectly balanced with apple wood smoked bacon and a simple ham and three cheese omlet. The key to any good recipe is figuring out how to accompany it with a mate or two, or at the very least, modify the core recipe to your tastes.

We loved these pancakes - the texture was great, and they were so light and fluffy! We now have a new favorite at home!

I found this recipe while looking for something quick for dinner tonight. We're always fans of "breakfast dinners," but I didn't want to make the usual pancakes and eggs. This was great fun to make, and the family ate it all up and raved -- the griddle cakes are light, fluffy and delicious, especially with the cream.

The measurements didn't make sense to me from the get go. I viusalized a very runny batter, but my 5 yar old who loves anything that remotely resembles a pancake, insisted we try them. And based on the other reviews I couldn't resist. They didn't turn out at all. We both agreed we'd stick to our usual pancake recipe. They were, not surprisingly, a huge disappointment.

I made these for breakfast this morning. Fast, simple, elegant twist on regular old pancakes. Very light and airy and the touch of marmelade and creme make you feel like you're eating at a bed and breakfast.

These were incredibly simple to make and absolutely delicious...You'll love them more than pancakes or waffles !!!
