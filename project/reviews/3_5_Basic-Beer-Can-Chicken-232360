I get absolute raves every time I make this dish and have been asked for the "recipe" many times. Chicken has no beer taste, it's simply delicious, and best of all it is amazingly moist and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. I'm not a skin eater, but you can eat it this way. I recommend a very liberal dry rub of kosher salt, pepper, and whatever seasonings you prefer (I use a simple combination of garlic pepper and Montreal seasoning). I don't bother with butter or olive oil on the outside - I've tried this, but I think it actually comes out better without it. I also use a fryer hen instead of a roasting one - also seems to come out better for some reason. And, although I've tried the BBQ, I really prefer the oven - we have a trivection oven and it just comes out better that way. Our BBQ isn't very large, however. Instead of a beer can with paint, I use a small glass cup that happens to fit perfectly into my vertical roasting rack, which I purchased for $10 at Bed Bath & Beyond. There is a more expensive version at Williams Sonoma, which comes with its own cup. In the cup, I put white wine or beer, lemon wedges, and rosemary sprigs. I stuff a small onion into the neck cavity, making sure it's trimmed down for a snug fit - the chicken is much more moist that way. I might also put onions, carrots and/or celery in the cup. If that sounds like a lot of stuff in the cup, you're right, it's all spilling over but that's ok, the chicken holds it together. The trick is not to stuff the chicken too much. I put in the liquid and lemon wedges first, lower the chicken, then put in everything else through the neck. Truth is it doesn't matter so much which seasonings you use, this chicken will come out perfect every time. Even if overcooked, it's still moist and wonderful.

Delicious! The only other time I have made an entire chicken was with the "favorite simple roast chicken" recipe on this site and the beer can chicken was far superior in my opinion. I set my bird on a glass pie plate which helped keep the grill tidy and made it easy to turn and transport the bird. The whole thing took about 2 1/2 hours over indirect heat on my gas grill, but it was worth the wait. I don't know if it is the novelty of cooking in such a funky and surprising way, or the obligation to drink beer as part of the recipe, but it was fun to make and the end result was fantastic.

This is an easy way to make an unexpected chicken and it works well on the grill or in the oven. The variations from Bon Appetite are fantastic (http://www.epicurious.com/bonappetit/feat ures/beer_can_chicken). I made 3 small chickens, each one with a different flavor, for a crowd and there were no left overs. Do be careful pulling the chicken off of the can. I recommend asking for a volunteer to assist.

OOPS - I've been making this chicken (best with dark beer and a Mediterranean rub) over direct heat and uncovered for a year now. It's been great every time--very juicy, with crispy skin. (And it's faster-huh.) I cook until the legs are loose--35-45 min. on a gas grill. I use a Weber grill pan with the "stand up" prongs and beer well--got it because we didn't like the idea of a painted can. Recommend the pan because it catches all the drippings, chicken is secure, and it's VERY easy to clean.

I make this all the time. Drink 1/2 a beer. Put 2 smashed garlic cloves,10 peppercorns, a 2 large lemon wedges in the remaining beer. Rub the chicken with fresh lemon juice from the leftover lemon. Sprinkle with lemon-pepper all over. Stuff the neck with part of a lemon, a potato,or an onion.

OK! I'll trump the Leftist from Seattle(just kidding). I'm a 7th generation redneck from VT. I had to move my gun closet to get to the oven. There I found my Rhetoric degree, my Masters in Engineering degree and "W" bumper sticker. My Republican girlfriend and I just made this chicken the following way...give us your thoughts: -s+p, onion powder, chili, paprika, parsley, thyme, and hot spice dry rub -Tabasco under the skin and massaged -pam the pan -Skud-Light, open-drink a bit, many small holes in the top, foil wrap and hoisted up the chicken butt -foil the open parts of the pan(keep the oven clean) -450 degrees in the oven and keep track the temp. Consumed with a healthy portion of freshly made hard cider and a little baked potato, you have to love this life. Thanks all.

Couldn't find my vertical roast stand so ...had no beer so, I used an empty tomato sauce can, added 1/4 cup water and a head of garlic, peeled. I use a spicy rub. Baked in the oven at 400* for 1hr. Make sure you use an adequate drip pan in oven or BBQ, because you won't believe how much fat drips off! The skin was crispy delight all around, the meat moist and flavorful! It's a great technique.

Yes this is a great way to cook chicken. I'm suprised though that the recipe doesn't tell about the stand for the chicken. It has a place in the center for the beer can to sit and then the chicken slides down over the stand and beer can and gives better balance. They can be purchased at most stores that sell kitchen gadgits.

What a great idea Naperville! I love cooking chicken this way. I've never had a dry bird come off of the grill using the beer-can method- it's just about foolproof. I make (what I think) is a really good Jerk marinade that I usually use with chicken thighs, but I didn't think to try it this way. Maybe marinate the chicken and put more marinade in the can? Thanks for the inspiration :)

Several weeks ago we tried this recipe and found this cooking method to be the easiest way to cook chicken on the grill. Tonight, I tried another grilled chicken recipe that had a marinade and used chicken pieces. Since I found the beer can method so easy, I tried the other recipe with a whole chicken and the beer can method. I put some of the marinade under the skin of both the breasts and thighs. When it was time to cook, I drained the marinade from the chicken and then poured the excess marinade into an empty beer can with 2 additional holes punched in the top. I then filled the beer can with beer to 3/4 full. Then I placed the chicken on the beer can and charcoal grilled over indirect heat for about 45 minutes for a 3.5 pound chicken. It was incredibly tasty, and incredibly easy. I will be using the beer-can method with all the grilled chicken recipes from now on. I can't wait to try it with Jerk Chicken

I have found this method of grilling chicken to be incredibly easy! After trying this recipe I started experimenting. Tonight I used the beer can method to grill a chicken using a recipe that called for marinating chicken pieces and then grilling them. Since I found beer-can grilling to be so easy, I marinaded the chicken whole, and put some marinade under the skin of the breasts and thighs. When it was ready to cook, I put the excess marinade into the beer can. And then I used this method to grill the chicken. It was great. I can't wait to use my other favorite chicken marinade (most noteably Jerk Chicken) with this method!!

So I'm a stupid redneck in Seattle who votes democratic, has a Master's degree and loves to cook and eat good food! I've roasted and grilled hundreds of birds in my day but I've got to say nothing beats a beer butt chicken (our name for this recipe). We do brine the chcken for a day in 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup salt and water to cover. Then just stick the bird on it's perch and bbq. We use a gas grill and grill it on low heat for about 90 minutes. So simple and always moist. ALWAYS a hit !

The critics of this recipe are like the person who sent me this link. They think that anything worth eating has to cost a lot, take up lots of time and have nothing to do with being an American. My grandparents were from a variety of cultures, but I am 100% American and proud of it.

Season the beer, plug the hole with onion, and it's delicious and tender. And gimmicky is kinda fun sometimes!

For those of you looking for an actual review without the snipey name-calling, this is a perfectly good recipe. I've grilled some dry chickens in my day, but I've found this method to produce a really juicy, flavorful result every time. Experiment with the liquids and the rubs. Cooking is supposed to be fun and social regardless of the method. I don't know why a meal shared with friends, family and laughter would be any less enjoyable if it was prepared on a George Foreman grill or by a Cordon Bleu chef. If I had to choose, I'll take the "Tur-Duck-Hen eating, shooting at Jackalopes with potato guns" folks over those with disparaging attitudes that I've seen on this site recently. Be nice and eat well!

To the "trend-setter" from Madison. I don't think the people who make fun of this recipe are lacking anything in cooking ability, imagination, or willingness to try new recipes. I think that by referring to this as a fad, their intention is to liken this ridiculous cooking method to the George Foreman grill, Set-it-and-forget-it machine, or any other mainstay of the inhabitants of Wal-Mart nation. This thing has Tur-duck-en, Jackalopes, and guns that shoot potatoes written all over it.

I've made beer can chicken several times since learning of the recipe. It's reliably delicious! I've used non-alcoholic dark beer and added herbs and spices into the beer can as well as inside and outside the chicken. The spices vary, depending on my whim--cajun, herbes de provence, or Italian herb blend. I preheat my gas grill with both burners on high, then when I'm ready to cook the chicken, I turn one side off, and lower the other side to medium-high heat. A 3 1/2 lb. chicken cooks in just over an hour this way. I also put the chicken onto a glass pie plate to catch the drippings. The chicken legs act as a tripod to stand the chicken up during cooking, and I turn the plate around half-way during cooking so that the chicken browns evenly. It's perfect everytime! The meat just falls off of the bone.

To you know it all cooks, whatever to your "trendy" or fad comments, there are ALWAYS fads in cooking, get out of your traditional crap and step out into the real world of cooking, if you are a traditional cook excuse me for asking but why are you on Epicurious.com? forgive me but if you cannot handle the best cooks and recipes then stay away from the sight!! This recipe is FABULOUS and I have used it over and over again! Epicurious has never failed me... they are the best recipe sight on the net BAR NONE!

We had this on the weekend - delicious and easy, resulting in a very moist chicken. Yum. To the SNOB who thinks this is a fad, and had to make the comment about COKE - did it occur to you that whether or not alcohol dissipates in cooking, some non-drinking families simply would not have beer in the house?? Also, no rednecks or kids in our gang - urban professionals who love cooking in all its wacky and wonderful forms. Really, you need to get over yourself.

To grammyjax- the chicken you're cooking probably does take longer on the grill than a store bought one. I'd use a thermometer to be sure it was done. Another theory- you may be accomplishing the "smoke ring" (very respected here in TX!) which will leave some pink even though the chicken is completely done. As long as the temperature is safe, just tell the family that they're getting some good 'cue and they should close their eyes and enjoy it :)

I have used this recipe a few times and every time, I have had to more than double the cooking time. Am I doing something wrong? I should perhaps mention two caveats: a) my family will not eat chicken with any hint of pink around the bone and b) since we always make these at the lake we use my brother's farm-raised chickens which have substantially denser meat than store-bought chickens. Are either of these my problems? ... from yet another 'redneck' but certainly preferable to the culinary snobs such as I've had the displeasure of encountering on this forum...shame!

I've been making variations of this for past few years. Beer, lemonade, iced tea, and yes- even with Coke (Black Cherry soda is good too). The liquid not only keeps the bird moist, but also adds subtle flavor. I slowly smoke mine over mesquite and the chicken is always juicy. But I suppose that being the "stupid redneck" that I am perhaps I should just throw a plain chicken on the grill. :) I may be stupid, but at least I can spell "enthusiast"...

I made this on the grill last night, but I omitted the beer and the can. This really is no more than a stupid party trick to entertain kids and rednecks.. And to the COKE enthusiasy . . . "grilling" beer removes the alcohol.

I've done this w/ beer several times - so I decided to try something else due to non-alcohol drinkers - COKE. It worked wonderfully due to the sweetness/flavor of the soda, which gave the chicken a nice taste.

This is always a hoot to make. One year I tried a similar idea for our Thanksgiving turkey, and it turned out super moist and flavorful. Instead of a beer can, I used a large can of pineapple juice, half full. I have also heard of using the small 6 oz. juice cans for Cornish hens. Just fit the can to the bird and have fun!

This is definitely a cookout favorite! It takes an hour to cook. It's so easy and delicious! No need for any fancy tripod contraption. Balancing is easy - just make a tripod w/ the beer can and the legs!

Hi, I have a very similar recipe in "Fast Entrees" by Hugh Carpenter and Terry Sandeson. The oven alternative given there is to roast in a 425 degree oven for 30 minutes, or to an internal temperature of 170 degrees. Good luck!

Help! Fire regulations in my county dictate that we can NOT have a grill in our apartment complex (well, we can, but it has to be 50 feet away from a dwelling... whatever). Is there anyway I could do beer-can chicken in my oven??

This is an easy way to make your chicken moist , but beware not all grills are the same . Chicken definitely needs at least 1 1/2 hr. to cook with onion or potato stuffed in neck

Always a great entertaining dish, half the fun is watching the bird on the grill. On indirect heat, top down, a 3 llb chicken takes about 80 mins. We also add thai chili sauce to the rub for extra crispy skin.

I have made chicken this way for years having heard about the method from Canadian friends. We have additional instructions: Open the beer, drink half and fill the can with peeled garlic cloves. Use your spice rub and stand and you're all set.

I have found in almost impossible to balance a chicken on a beer can so I looked on the Internet and found a nice wire contraption that has a good-sized base which holds the chicken upright perfectly.

I agree with the cook from Evanston Il, I too don't appreciate non-food-safe items such as painted beer cans, in order to avoid the paint you just have to wrap the can with foil. can't wait to make this recipe - it sounds easy and really moist.

Just a general chime-in concerning the whole beer-can thing... This is an excellent way to barbecue a whole bird on a gas grill. The meat turns out moist and the skin crisp--all without much attention. Definitely brine or marinate your bird (unless it is Kosher)...experiment with rubs and pastes...don't forget to season the inside of the bird...and keep the beer cheap. As I don't like to have non-food-safe items (such as painted beer cans) in contact with food, I purchased a couple of "Willie's Chicken Sitters" as mentioned in Steve Raichlen's book. They are much easier to handle than a beer can as they are glazed porcelain with a wide bottom and the bird won't stick to them. Now...to test out Jane and Michael Stern's "Duckling a la Vernor's"....

Ive been doing this for several years now and there is no better way to grill chicken! A couple of tips: Grease the beer can before inserting. You might need an extra pair of hands while placing on the grill. My advice is to do this near the grill or right on it so you dont spill the beer. Finally -- put a small onion or bulb of garlic in the neck opening once you have it standing upright. Helps keep the moisture in. Enjoy!
