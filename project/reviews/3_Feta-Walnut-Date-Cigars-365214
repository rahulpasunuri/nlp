I can suggest a classic Turkish food which is like "Feta Walnut Date Cigar", but is completely different what you have seen here. Potato Patty is one of the most widespread meals in Turkey. Turkish cooks and housewives prefer to make its all variations for breakfasts and for tea hours.

Time it took me - 2 hours start to finish. I carefully followed the advice on working with the phyllo - worked very well. I took the reviewers advice to add more flavor but didn't have cranberries. I used orange zest (from 3 oranges) plus a bit of salt. It was DELICIOUS! I found that mixing the filling in the food processor was not easy - the filling kept balling up above the blades and not actually mixing very well - any other suggestions would be appreciated for my future use of recipe. I did final mix with my hands to ensure the cheeses were well blended. I also took the reviewers advice to make all of the 'cigar fillers' and freeze for 20 minutes or so prior to rolling into phyllo. that worked like a dream. I baked a couple of testers to see how the orange worked out then froze the rest unbaked with plans to use them next week.

These were very good. I added a bit of dried thyme (fresh would have been better but I didn't have any). I had no problem forming the filling for the cigars. However the filling did ooze out at both ends when I baked them. I used a milder, less salty, French feta. Next time, I would use a sharper feta.

2nd time around making these-resolved the soft filling problem by rolling all at once then chilled briefly while getting filo ready. Also used cranberry goat cheese (Trader Joes) in place of cream cheese which helped for that extra layer of flavor needed. Recently served for clients as 1st appetizer at dinner party. They all enjoyed so this is a keeper.

Needs another layer of flavor. 100% better with the addition of dried cranberries to the filling or next time, I may try goat cheese in place of the feta for that tangy taste. While I work with phyllo A LOT and understand that it can be very labor intensive, the filling is the challenge here. It gets too soft to roll, even with breadcrumbs on my hands. Had to refrigerate several times throughout the process. BTW, you can freeze (baked) for up to a month as long as you use proper freezer containers & fill empty space with crunched up wax paper. Considering the Athens phyllo I used was not as large as what this recipe states, I was still able to make 30 with the filling. Will be trying these out on my holiday clients-stay tuned for their input! One last bit of advice regarding phyllo dough- invest in a Roulpat- saves on clean up.

These are pretty good. Easy and fun to make but not amazing,
