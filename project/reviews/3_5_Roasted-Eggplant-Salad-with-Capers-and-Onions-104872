delicious, but too onion-y for my taste, even though i subbed a red onion. for this recipe, i used some eggplant i had roasted on the bbq a couple of days before, then let sit in the fridge... if i'm using the oven or the bbq, i often throw in some eggplant or peppers for later use... so the eggplants just needed to be scooped out of their skins and used. tasted good on day 2, too.

Very nice with pita bread on a hot summer day. I too reduced the amount of onion, the capers and vinegar provide plenty of tang already

I have made this recipe at least 4 times this summer. Have served it both warm and cold with great reception. Like another reviewer, I dice up the eggplant first, then roast it with olive oil. I also sautee the garlic first before adding if I have the time.

This dish is wonderful! I did cube the eggplant and then roast it with olive oil and salt, just because I am not overly fond of pulpy eggplant mush...anyway, the flavors blended marvelously and, I thought, really came through nicely when the salad was warm, room temp., and cold. I worried that the raw onion would not be a good idea, but all for naught! I will be making this dish again soon, as I happen to live among the ranks of our local chapter of the Eggplant Lovers Society!

not too shabby ... maybe the flavours will become more intense overnight?

I am not quite sure that I did everything exactly right because it wasn't such a hit in this household. I personally enjoy my eggplant warm, but that's just me...I think I would prepare this late in the evening, and serve it before it cooled down. I just don't like the smooth texture of eggplant at low temperatures. It's a great recipe to use as a springboard, though

THis was very good and several non eggplant eaters couldn't stop eating it. I did use the tip below and roast in the oven which seemed much easier and worked great. It doesn't make very much and I would probably double or triple if I was going to make again.

The second time I made this dish, I roasted the eggplant in the oven at 400 degrees for 30-35 minutes. It was much easier and just as tasty. But I recommend piercing the eggplant skin in several places before roasting, because one of mine "exploded". I also recommend cutting back on the onion. Even though I used a sweet onion, it was a bit overwhelming.

Since roasting the eggplants over an open flame only cooks about 1/2" below the skin, I recommend that after you cut them open and remove the seeds, you should cube the uncooked portion and saute the cubes in a little olive oil unless you want raw eggplant in your salad. With this modification, this is a very tasty dish.

If you like eggplant and capers by all means make this recipe. My husband loved it. Hes asking me to make it again. "Lets go get more eggplant!!"

This is a good, fresh-tasting salad. I think you should use capers preserved in brine (which is what the Greeks use) or in salt, which are much better than the ones in vinegar. Make sure to cook the eggplants well, and split them in half and drain in colander to get rid of excess moisture which will make the salad watery. If you own a pastry blender, it will do perfect job mashing the eggplants into coarse puree.
