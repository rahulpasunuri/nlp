I have made this numerous times. This is a great make ahead recipe exactly as is - with unlimited potential to customize. I have found that it will easily keep for several days.

I make these all the time! You can easily change up the mix-ins -- we like ham or bacon or cheddar cheese or spinach...the list goes on. So easy to make if you do them the day before and reheat as instructed.

This made an excellent brunch main course--delicious and very pretty! Making it the day before and reheating it worked fine. I don't even like eggs very much, and I had a second helping. Made exactly per recipe except for easing up on the salt based on other reviews. Wouldn't change a thing. This is definitely a keeper.

Nothing wrong with this - but nothing wow. Took longer to cook for me.

Would rate it 3.5 forks if I could. Made exactly as is, twice, and both times I thought that I should have halved the salt, at least, since feta with sausage is salty enough. Very good recipe, but not completely "wow." Still a keeper for a make-ahead brunch item!

It was lovely and perfect. No particular changes to the recipe, I only replaced chard with spring greens (those in UK will know them), as chard wasn't in season just yet. Mind it took longer to "cook in the middle" with a convection oven, cooking at low temp as prescribed (started to test at around 25' ...).

Love, love, love this recipe! We made it as directed but cooked it in muffin cups for the sake of ease. Worked beautifully. Looking forward to trying it again with some additional veggies. Yum!

This was delicious and easy! I would not serve it bigger than bite-sized pieces because it's so rich. Rave reviews from everyone at the brunch. I was asked for the recipe a number of times.

Love this dish! I've made this following the recipe exactly and I've played around a bit as well. Both times it got rave reviews. I saute a shallot with the onions, and have even used red, orange, and yellow peppers in addition. Turkey sausage can be substituted if you're feeding health conscious guests. I don't think you can make a mistake with this dish. Absolutely delightful, easy to make, and so much fun!

I just made it without the sausage.I use 1/3 cup of half an half instead of the heavy cream and the Israeli Feta from Trader's Joe. I'll make it again definitely. Anniella

Addendum. Mild chicken sausage worked great. Not sure why I put spicy in the review...

Really, really good. Made the night before and cut into into 9 pieces for brunch - no leftovers. Some of my friends don't eat pork so I used a spicy chicken sausage (no casing) from Whole Foods and it worked great. 1 cup feta crumbled by my hand turned out to be quite a bit more than 4.5 oz so based on the comments of other reviewers I 86'd the salt.

I loved this and will make it again and again! I was nervous that 40 minutes would over cook the frittata, but it tasted great. I used red chard, so I used a paper towl to squeeze out the liquid; the red would have stained a dish towel.

I love when people make substitutions and write about it. I think the issue is with the "RATING" part. I use ratings to sort the recipes to decide which ones to read. If a recipe is poorly rated because people made substitutions they didn't like, I might not even look at a potentially great recipe.

I made these for my friend's party and they were a HUGE hit! I don't like Swiss Chard, as I think it has too strong of a flavor, so I opted for baby spinach instead. Instead of boiling the spinach I sauteed it in a large skillet with some shallots, garlic, a bit of butter and a little bit of olive oil. Lightly salt and pepper. Everything else was exactly the same. This one is a keeper!

I made this without sausage because of a vegetarian friend. It was still very good and got rave reviews (and multiple recipe requests) at the brunch I took it to.

Perfect everytime! Always on my brunch menus. A great gluten-free alternative to quiche. Easy to make ahead of time and reheat the day of.

I made these the night before for my holiday party and they were a huge hit! I ended up making them again for Christmas breakfast as they are just too good! I found the recipe very easy.

This is really delicious. But if you're like me and not into salty food, don't add any. The sausage and feta have plenty.

These were good cold or warm. So easy to make. One of the few dishes I have made following the recipe exactly. Also easy to serve and eat. Would absolutely make again.

Made this for my husband's birthday brunch. We had some vegetarians in the group so I made it without the sausage, and I have to say I am glad for the other reviews that tinkered with the recipe and let me know it would still turn out delicious. Which it unequivocally DID! I read the reviews to see if anyone recommends changes or has tried something different, and I also like the reviews to see if people liked the recipe as written.

Delicious! I added some minced garlic to the onion saute. I also used Garlic and Herb Feta cheese. I doubled the sausage so it was extra meaty. Perfect dish for a potluck.

This was so yummy. I used chorizo because that's what I had. Delicious. I made it day ahead for my party and it was so easy to heat up and tasted as good as the day I made it.

Not sure why it calls for heavy whipping cream. I used skim milk to save some calories and it still tasted rich and decadent. Perhaps it was the high quality feta I used...Anyway, this made a great camping breakfast. I prepared the frittata ahead of time at home, wrapped each portion in foil and placed them in the cooler. We tossed them over the campfire in the morning to reheat. The perfect, no mess, warm and filling breakfast before a day of hiking.

I have made this recipe 3 times for cocktail parties and everyone loved it. I didn't make any changes to it. I love the fact that it can be served at room temperature. That makes it easy to transport you.

Excellent! I fixed it for dinner with a fresh side salad and watermelon for dessert. I toned down the chard a bit, but I thought the flavors blended wonderfully.

This is a great recipe. I make it every time I have guests staying over and serve it for the brunch. I make it with baby spinach, goat's milk feta cheese and tomato basil veal sausage. It is sooooo good.

Yummy! Here is why reviewing with changes is more useful than people who review the recipe only as written. Bon Appetit has a review staff with a test kitchen. They have reviewed the recipe thoroughly, so has the professional cook author, all with a mind toward home cooks. There are still a few duds that make it thought, but for the most part we all trust bon appetit or we'd be using another website. What epicurious doesn't do in the original recipes is talk about all the possible substitutions, where you could go wrong or right. That's what the comments are great for! Case in point: I used the others suggestions to use buttermilk to save on calories and after reading the other reviews I cut out the sausage to make it vegetarian. It was delicious and beautiful.

Completely wonderful. I made it according to the recipe.On the first day I felt the feta was a little overpowered by the sausage. But the next day for lunch, the flavors of the feta were stronger, making the dish more balanced. Would definitely make this again. It is one of the only recipes with chard that my boyfriend likes.

I'm ok with slight tweaking to the recipe in reviews, but please don't make multiple changes, one of which is leaving out a titled ingredient, and then review it. For example, the yogurt for cream sub is ok with me. Doing more than that differently means you have done a different recipe.

I made this for a cocktail party and there was nothing left! Everyone enjoyed it very much. I would certainly make it again.

I value the cooks who modify the recipe and share the results as much as those who follow precisely. Often these cooks face the same challenges I do -- out of one ingredient, wanting to cut down on fat, etc. -- and I appreciate the time saved!

Very good. Did not deviate from recipe. Was looking for a recipe to use swiss chard from my local farm share and this was perfect! I made it for dinner, but it would be perfect for brunch or lunch. Only baked for 45 min. and then let it rest. Even the kids liked it!

I agree with the posters that don't appreciate reviewers that don't review the ACTUAL recipe. I'm not saying that a recipe shouldn't be tweaked to your own liking - simply try the recipe as written, review it, then make the changes you want. Or suggest what you would do differently if you were going to make the recipe again.

You're not a rebel...you used a different recipe! I haven't made this. It just ticks me when every part of the recipe is changed and then judged.

I'm a rebel. Nixed meat, added vegetables including hot peppers, subbed yogurt for cream and liked results.
