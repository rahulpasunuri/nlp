I took the suggestion to marinade in olive oil (1/2 cup), balsamic vinager (1/4 cup), 1 clove garlic, and plenty of fresh rosemary. So it was not plain. I broiled thme once, and grilled them in my grill wok with holes in it the next. Both results were good.

try it with a marinade of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt, cracked pepper, chrushed garlic, and chopped fresh rosemary. this is *the* quintessential grilled vegetable marinade. even if you don't have time to actually marinade, just toss the veggies in the marinade and throw on the grill.

It should be noted that nearly any kind of veggie can be grilled/roasted in this way. Just keep in mind that harder veggies (potatoes/carrots) take a bit longer than soft ones. Using a marinade will also increase the flavor exponentially - this recipie is quite bland the way it is, so use it as a stasrting point and jazz it up!
