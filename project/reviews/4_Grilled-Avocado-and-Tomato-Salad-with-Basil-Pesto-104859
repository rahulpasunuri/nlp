I agree with all the cooks that have gone before me and have made this terrific salad sans grillin. I find that Michael always likes to make things more complicated than needs be...let's face it' he has more time than most home cooks! I also want to admit to using pesto from Costco once and it was great! For all of his complications, he always produces recipes that are delish! Thank you for this one! YUM!!!!

Have served this several times at parties, always to rave reviews. I usually skip grilling the avocados and place them on the salad when ripe. I also use a little more pesto than is recommended. A great salad in the summer when tomatoes are in season.

We really enjoyed this salad alongside grilled beef tenderloin medalliaons. I used fresh basil instead of pesto and heirloom cherry tomatoes in different colors. Very quick and easy. Full of flavor and an elegant salad.

Very good recipe. You could easily skip grilling the avocado.

We didn't grill the avocados because the grill wasn't working and this salad still turned out great. Also left out 1.5 tblspoons of the oil and the extra parm as the pinenut pesto we made was just the right flavor.

This dish was absolutely delicious-4 forks!!! It rained the day we had planned to grill a bunch of things on our menu so we improvised and made this on a grill pan for starters. The avocados I chose were defintely not as ripe so they stayed together well during the grilling and I took that advise from other reviewers. The taste was exceptional and we arranged the salad on plates to make the presentation even more fun. This is another keeper for my files and we are looking forward to a "nicer" spring and summer this year here in NJ without so much rain so we can try this on the grill!!!

This recipe was great. I am not one for formal dining so I threw everything in the bowl and gently tossed. It was still awesome.

Very good...and easy. I suggest using very firm avocados or they break down on the grill.
