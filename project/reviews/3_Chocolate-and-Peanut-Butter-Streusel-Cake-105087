We followed the recipe as written and found it just OK. That's not what you want from a cake. It had good texture but very bland flavor. Chocolate and peanut butter together should be much more impressive. It wasn't bad, just not worth making again.

I've made this several times and find it a really dependable, popular snack cake. It really benefits from a little extra hint of flavor though -- I up the vanilla a bit and add some salt. It's good with either regular milk or try buttermilk instead. When I tried omitting the semi-sweet chocolate chips from the batter and just using a smaller amount of milk chocolate chips mixed in with the strusel on top I got two requests for the recipe, and now I make it that way every time.

I haven't made this recipe yet, but reading the reviews really fascinated me--I noticed that a number of people complained that the recipe turned out "too cakey." It's a cake, though, isn't it? "Chocolate and Peanut Butter Streusel CAKE" What were they expecting? I just find this curious.

Not very peanut buttery

I gave this 4 stars because the folks that ate it loved it. I felt it was worth a second shot but no raves from me although worthwhile if you are a choco-p.b. fan.

Disappointing. Very sweet without providing a lot of peanut butter or chocolate flavors.

I am a cook in a restaurant at 6500 ft altitude, made adjustments, still remained gooey after plenty of xtra time. Huge disappointment!

I'm not a fan of the peanut butter and chocolate combination but these were really good. I made mine with mini chocolate chips and they came out looking and tasting really good! It was also very easy to make and not time consuming. Though, when I first tasted them out of the pan, they were really dry. I put them into a container and took them to work the next day, it was much more moist =)

This is a very easy recipe that comes out well. It is very popular, especially with kids.

My cake came out moist and delicious. It was so easy, and I found it to be surprisingly good. It is what it is: not elegant or sophisticated, but quite tasty and a hit with everyone who tried it. I was looking for something simple to make with my 4 year old with ingredients I had on hand, and this fit the bill. I will certainly make it again - it's quick enough for a weeknight dessert, and it will travel well in the pan, making it an ideal treat to take to a school function.

Not cake-like and very dry; Flavor was well balanced - but texture simply didn't pass muster. Will crumble it and freeze it to fold into homemade icecream.

Will not be making this again. Mediocre at best.

The cake part of this recipe is really closer to a brownie, but I like it that way. The crumble was good. The only problem was the number of chocolate chips in the recipe. It was almost sickening! Next time I would use half the amount and I'm sure it would be more than enough.

This cake had a heavy texture and was much to sweet for my taste. It was more like candy than cake and I will not be making it again.

ohmygosh...what a YUMMY cake! I made this with reduced fat extra chunky peanut butter because that is all I had on hand, but followed the directions precisely after that. The cake is SUPER; a light peanut butter taste (which is good--I don't want anything too cloying); just the right amount of chocolate; a great texture; pretty-as-a-picture, and easy to make! I predict this will become a favorite lunch box treat for my kids and I expect to make it frequently for picnics and potlucks for children AND adults. Definately a "keeper".

I made this recipe for coffee hour at church with the following modifications: used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy, added walnut pieces to the streusel on top of the cake and sprinkled powdered sugar on top before serving. The cake was a BIG hit!

I made this cake with leftover butter milk instead of whole meilk and the cake was very moist and dense. Went over very well at a casual dinner party with children.

This is TASTY! Easy to make, very large, and very good...

Easy and pretty good. Definitely meant more for kids than adults. I liked the suggestion about a swirled ganache, or buttermilk, or something to make it less plain. The cake was light and fluffy, just as a cake should be. I made 2/3 of the recipe in a pan 2/3 the size, and found the cake rising above the edges of the pan just enough to make me begin to worry... but everything ended up fitting in the pan just fine :) At 35 mins, the cake definitely was not baked through, even though the oven temperature was accurate. It needed another 5-10 mins in the oven to finish up.

This cake is the absolute best! Just enough of both chocolate and peanut butter. I made it for a peanut butter cookie lover and he loved it. It's the cake of choice at the office.

This cake is light and delicious. Kids LOVE it and so do adults. I always bring this to picnics/parties because it's easy to make and not too sweet. This is a winner if you want to make a cake w/o making frosting!

Tried this for the first time. The cake was good, can defintely taste the peanut butter, but the best part was my 9-year old daughter and 8-year old niece LOVED IT! Would make again for the kids!

OK -- here's the secret: don't backe this in a bundt pan, but an 8x8 brownie pan. Firstly, it keeps the whole thing moister, and secondly, it's pretty rich, so a square of it is more managable than a whole slice. P.S. I reccommend crunchy peanut butter, not smooth!

I disagree with the other cooks. I made this cake and it came out amazing. You must expect it to become a little rich because of the ingredients, but the taste of peanut butter was very present. I served this at dinner to friends and family and they couldn't believe I made it.

The cons of this recipe are that it is too cake like. It has only a very slight taste of peanut butter in it. The pro's are that kids love it and they'll eat the whole piece because it has chips in the entire piece. My three kids can't get enough of it so it would be a perfect dessert just for kids while the adults have something special. ATTENTION MOMMIES: This is perfect to send into school or bake for a school function for something besides a basic brownie or plain cake. KIDS LOVE IT!! Parents might not.

hmmm. I don't know. I made this cake three times already..I understand and agree with the other reviewers, but you know what? everyone else loves this cake...I added 1/2 cup regular sugar to the cake last time. I think this cake could benefit from a ganache swirled through it---or buttermilk added to it---will keep trying it. My kids love it

I have to agree with the other reviewer. The finished cake was... well...cakey. The streusel was good but the cake part seemed to be missing something almost tasted like it was from a box. I am looking for a really good peanut butter & chocolate cake. Please let me know if anyone has a good tested recipe. I don't think I will make this one again.

The batter was yummy but the finished product was a disappointment. It came out too cakey light. Probably would benefit grom addition of chopped nuts and/or coconut. Will try again w some adaptation.
