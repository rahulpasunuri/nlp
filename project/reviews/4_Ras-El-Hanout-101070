This is my new favorite spice blend. I sprinkle some on lamb chops and broil them for about 5 min per side. So easy and so delicious. I highly recommend this spice blend.

This spice blend is perfect for when you want to add a touch of Morocco to a dish. It works beautifully with lamb. I originally made it as part of the Moroccan lamb and eggplant matzo pie with spicy tomato sauce recipe, where it brought all the ingredients together perfectly, permeating the dish with yummy exotic flavour. Highly recommended.
