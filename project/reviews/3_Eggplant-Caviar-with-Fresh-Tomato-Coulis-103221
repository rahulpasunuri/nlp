The end product tasted good, but I did not feel it was worth the effort and time of roasting, peeling, blanching, etc. Note - you'll need about two hours total time to make this dish. A bruschetta tastes just as good without the trouble.

Terrific, simple, and it highlights the flavours of each ingredient. I totally agree with Sue -- don't fuss with blanching or peeling the tomatoes, just pick good ones and puree. Lovely presentation, also.

No need to peel the tomatoes. I simply cut out the white pith, blended the tomatoes and put the mixture through a strainer. I used less oil to make the eggplant quenelles--I liked a firmer texture. I made a basil pistou and poured it around the soup once--it's a fun recipe for experimentation. Works with mint quite nicely as well. Colors are exquisite. This has become a staple during the magnificent tomato season here in Provence. I have made it at least 10 times this season to rave reviews from my French friends, who still say I cook pretty well "for an American".

My eggplant turned out to be male (more bitter)so I added a tiny amount of cumin to disguise it. Worked like a charm. Served as an appetizer on a big plate w/coulis all around. Guests loved it. Will make it again!

This is easy and tastes awesome. I just used chopped fresh tomato tossed in olive oil, garlic and basil, instead of coulis, and poured it over the top. Served with baked pita. So good

I gave this recipe a 4 rating because of it's simple elegance. I catered a small dinner party and served this as the soup course. The tomatoes I grew at home, the eggplant I had to buy. It is almost impossible to ruin eggplant when you have roasted it in the fashion given in this recipe, it is rich and nutty and delicious. Fresh robust tomatoes (mine) go wonderfully with the eggplant quenelles. Do try it.
