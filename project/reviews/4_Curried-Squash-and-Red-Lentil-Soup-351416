This was great - I made it for a sick friend, it's really comforting and lovely. I used sweet potato and green lentils, and originally reduced the liquid (substituting half chicken broth,) but ended up needing the full 2 quarts - this may have been because green lentils use more liquid than red. I also added some garam masala, turmeric, cumin and ground coriander for a little more depth.

This soup smells so good when cooking. Total comfort food. I didn't do the cilantro oil becuase I didn't have any cilantro. Instead I put fresh basil in the soup. Yum!

I roasted butternut squash. Sauted onion, ginger, garlic, celery mixture in coconut oil with 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. When cooked I added 2 T curry powder, 1/4 t of garam masala, 1/4 c unsweetened coconut, 1/4 c golden raisins, butternut squash and cooked another few minutes before adding 1 carton of veggie broth and lentils. Served over rice with chopped cilantro. YUM!!

I roasted the squash, Used 2 cups regular (did not have red)lentils, all the liquid (half chicken stock/half water) Added extra spices as suggesed with cumin, cinnamon, paprika, tumaric, corriander, and doubled the curry. Threw in some red swiss chard at end Didn't make the cilantro oil but it might have been nice. It was thick and didn't need the rice

Excellent soup recipe... I add a couple of things to it: cooked, crumbled spicy turkey sausage and a big bunch of chopped kale at the end (one of my favorite tricks for getting more healthy greens into meals). Didn't bother with the cilantro oil, doesn't need it. Highly recommend.

I looked up this recipe to compare/find variations to a dish I learned to make years ago. My recipe is essentially the same, but here are a few things that I find make it better. I saute the more rugged veggies first, then (I don't measure anything) add .5 to 2 T each of ginger, tumeric, black pepper, coriander, cinnamon, cumin, paprika. If using enough oil, it might be impossible to over-spice this soup. I then add and saute the rinsed lentils, when they start to stick add enough boiling water to cover and some diced turnip/rutabaga. Then the squash. Then some kind of tomato product. With the right timing, the right things turn to mush (beans) and the chunky veg holds its shape. And all in one pot. And everyone loves it, even the wee ones. And even better with Indian hot pepper.

After reading the reviews, I opted for less water (I prefer a thicker soup), more spices, and roasting the squash, rather than cooking it on the stovetop for deeper flavor and greater ease. (To roast, just slice the squash in half, deseed, poke holes in the skin, and roast at 350 face down until the flesh is soft.) Here's the article I wrote about this recipe: http://dunwoody.patch.com/articles/food-column-a-thanksgiving-soup

This "soup" tasted like flavored water. I tried to salvage by straining out the liquid, but that didn't help. I put it in a blender and added more spices, that didn't help. It is just a terrible recipe.

I have now made this dish four times and served it to multiple people. I have made it completely vegetarian, for my vegan friends and have done the switch with 1/2 water, 1/2 chicken stock. After reading reviews, each time I make it, I double the curry and add some cumin. Also I decrease the liquid to 5 cups. Everybody, and I mean EVERYBODY has asked for it again, and many have asked for the recipe.This is delicious!

This was EXCELLENT! Best new soup recipe I've tried in a long time. Take the advice of most reviewers and reduce the liquid and/or increase the lentils and veggies. Also, based on a couple of helpful comments, I used more spices: extra curry powder, a bit of cumin, and 1 tsp of chili powder - I think that made a huge difference.

I made this again tonight, except rather than using butternut squash, I chose to use sweet potatoes--much easier to prep. & it was delicious! The natural sweetness of the sweet potatoes came through wonderfully against all the spices (I had doubled the amount of curry powder, added cumin).

This is an excellent soup, and loved how healthy and filling it is! Here are my subs: added cayenne pepper to give it kick, added some diced red peppers (thrown in with the original veggies), omitted butter (no need for it), swapped onion for shallot, and increased the lentils to probably closer to 2 cups (I would definitely do this or reduce the water). Used regular curry powder and threw in a bunch of rainbow chard at the end, you could do the same with spinach or kale for a little green. Didnt bother with the cilantro oil, as I was trying to keep this dish as healthy as possible and didn't feel the need for adding more oil to it. Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
If I could, I'd give this recipe a 3.5 star rating. As previous reviewers stated, for a more stew-like consistency, the amount of liquid needs to be reduced. Or, as in my case, I doubled the amount of lentils. Which means I should have also doubled the amount of butternut squash. I doubled the amount of curry powder and added 1 1/2 teaspoons of cumin, too. Delicious, even without the cilantro oil. Oh, and I omitted the carrot and celery since I don't like either. Lunch leftovers this coming week will be so good!

This was a great winter dish. Like others who reviewed, I decreased the water by half and replaced 1 cup of water with veggie stock to give it more body (total 4 cups liquid). I also increased curry powder and added garam masala for more flavor. One new addition was to add 1/4 cup shredded coconut when added lentils and liquid. This gave it a more curry-like flavor and thickened the stew. This will definitely be a keeper.

Rating: 4
This was so amazing! I also added 2 quarts of water and one whole bag of lentils which made this more like a thicker stew than soup, I also doubled curry added 5 spicy italian sausage links that I first browned and then sliced up into thin slices and added to soup/stew. When served, I gave option of sweet hot chili sauce to sweeten it up a tad and it was delicious!

Rating: 4
This is a truly exceptional soup/stew! I agree that the liquid should be halved to 1 quart, not two, unless you want a *really* brothy soup. Made with 1 quart, it is thick and more like a stew. I doubled the garlic, added a small amount of chili powder and garam masala, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Oh wait! Added a handful of golden raisins--a nice tangy/sweet surprise. Served with brown jasmine rice and minced jalepenos on top. Will be making this regularly! Delicious!

This is tasty! Looks like there were suggestions to use chicken stock in place of water. i don't think that's necessary. However, definitely double the curry to bump up the flavor. I also added a little more garlic and kosher salt. We will be enjoying this again and again. As a side note, the curry I use is Penzy's Maharajah curry. It has saffron in it and is fantastic. http://www.penzeys.com/cgi-bin/penzeys/p- penzeysmaharajah.html?id=pS7rTxe2

Two quarts of water is way too much, which I unfortunately didn't realize till I was done. To deal with it, we blended the soup, which actually turned out really well. But it would still be better to use half to three-quarters of the water and/or substitute some veggie stock. The cilantro oil was delicious.

Rating: 3
I found this recipe as written a little bit bland. I added about a tsp of garam masala and a tsp of chili powder to kick it up a bit which made a big difference. I only used half the amount of water called for, and it came out a good consistency, the full 2 quarts would have been much too runny. I served it over basmati rice.

Lovely fall soup. The sweet of the squash and heat of the curry work fantastically together. Made pretty much as written except doubled the veggies and substituted leeks for onion. Didn't feel like it was missing anything made with water instead of stock - and saved on salt!

Great combination of flavors. A very healthy and hearty fall or winter dish. Prep is very time-consuming, but such is the case when combining large amounts of fresh vegetables. I had been hoping for more of a presence from the lentils; if I make it again I may try upping the quantity. Really tasty, leftovers were great as well.

Made it a day ahead of time. So thick and yummy. Added a couple yams since I didn't have enough squash and forgot to do the cilantro oil. It was amazingly good.

I have made this dish two times now. The first time I used regular Lentils the second time I used The red Lentils as specified. The color was different but the flavor was the same. I double the curry powder and add a 1/2 tsp of cayanne. Before serving I blend 2/3 of the soup and mix it back in. It gives it a nice creamy texture and works wonderful over California brown rice.

This soup is so good I've made in once a week for the past four weeks and we eat it for two nights. Sometimes I'm lucky and get an exceptional butternut squash. I substitute chicken broth for the water and only use half as much as we prefer it thick. I've used both regular lentils and red - both are good. We always eat this with brown organic basmati rice topped with non- fat greek yogurt and the cilantro oil. The hardest part of the recipe is cutting up the darned squash. Do try this - it's hearty, healthy and delicious.

Rating: 3
Three forks is a pretty darn good recipe to me. I made this for a group of friends and we had the cilantro oil and also some mango chutney to top it with. Next time I will add more spice, and more curry, but it had a great flavor. We served over Indian basmati rice, it does add an important dimension so I would always serve with rice.

My husband liked this a lot more than I did. I thought it was watery and the flavor just "ok", not even "very good" and certainly not "excellent". Cilantro oil an intriguing idea, but probably doesn't have anything over chopped fresh cilantro.

Good, but would be better with some tweaks. I made it according to the recipe the first time, and I will make it again but will add more spice/heat, salt, and cumin. We actually threw some Creole seasoning into the leftovers and it was a big improvement. The cilantro oil added some nice flavor, but I didn't see it as being necessary.

This was a very nice recipe. Since my family is used to eating authentic Indian food, I adjusted the recipe slightly by adding a "tadka" of asofetida, cumin, and mustard seeds roasted in ghee. This, along with a little cayenne pepper, perked up the flavor nicely. The kids and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Great recipe, a real keeper. Very quick and easy to make (not as long as stated in the recipe). I had everything on hand, added some flaked chili to give it extra zing. Followed previous reviews and cut the amount of water by half to have less of a soup and more of a dish. Excellent recipe.

This is a really healthy and delicious recipe. I realized as I was making it that I didn't have celery, so I just doubled my carrots. I doubled the ginger too, and used about 2 lbs of squash since that's what I had. Finally, I had Jamaican Curry, not Madras, so that's what I used. Mine was a little less chunky than the photo shows, but it was really enjoyable, and I will be making this again.

In light of previous reviews made two changes: I used a 49 oz can of low sodium chicken broth with water added to measure two quarts in place of 2 quarts of water. I also crushed in two chiles d'arbol for a touch of heat. Outstanding; served with Basmati Rice. If you prefer less spice one chile d'arbol would have been enough. I also used green lentils instead of red so it wasn't quite as "pretty" but tasted great.

Outstanding dish. Varied the recipe by using my own garam masala instead of prepackaged curry powder, vegetable stock instead of water, and since I couldn't find fresh winter squash I was forced to use prepackaged frozen. Also made a simple raita to go with the cilantro oil. I used a bit less liquid so the "soup" was quite thick. Served with naan and the result was excellent.

This soup was good but I was a little underwhelmed. (That's what high expectations get me!) Our guests enjoyed it, but it was too watery for my taste. Next time I'll use 2 cups less water and add some cumin to the curry mixture. I halved the cilantro-oil concoction and still had leftovers. Next time I'll use lime instead of lemon, too - that sounds delish!

I just finished cooking this soup and is delicious!!.Suggestion: I am serving the soup with a side of spinach salad with crumble hard boiled eggs,feta cheese and red onions, with vinagrette dressing.

Great recipe. I made it *nearly* as written but followed A Cook From L.A.'s advice and created my own spice mix in lieu of commercial curry powder. The soup wasn't watery at all, for a few reasons: I doubled the recipe, using one butternut and one acorn squash, which I suspect is a bit softer (if a nightmare to peel). I cooked the vegetables until they were nearly falling apart before adding the liquid. I also used split red lentils, which was all I could find at the store. The result was thick and flavorful, to the point that I didn't bother serving it with rice. The squeeze of lemon and cilantro oil are essential, adding herbal and citrus notes that offset the warm spices. We're looking forward to pulling out the leftovers from the freezer in a few weeks to see how much further the flavors have melded!

Rating: 3
Everyone loved this soup, including our pickier child, who, even though our diet is about 50% bean or lentil and rice dishes, balks at quite a few of them. The quality of your squash factors greatly in how good the flavor is, so source your squash carefully! I browned my veggies slightly before "deglazing" with the broth-- no need for the extra roasting step if you carmelize everything a little bit before adding the liquid. Enjoy!

This is delicious!! I took the leap and used 1 quart vegetable broth and 1 quart water,as others had suggested, rather than only water and it is tasty right off the stove. I used lime instead of lemon and put in a bit more curry than it calls for. Easy and super tasty. The vegetable broth helps gives it great flavor, but does not drown anything out. As I am eating it, I am adding more lime and it only gets better. YUMMM!Easy to make. Can't wait to eat it over rice for dinner!

I made a double batch the day ahead of use, and like other reviewers, found it a bit watery for my taste. It was still a hit with my family and the 2 other families there that evening for our weekly soup night. And by the third day the consistency had improved dramatically and really, the soup became better and better each day. I served with Naan and Raita along with the cilantro oil.

I, too, would probably roast the squash to boost the flavor. However, this was a quick and easy meal as written. I did use an immersion blender to make this a "cream" soup rather than a vegetable soup. Did not make oil since I had no cilantro. The addition of lentils was a nice boost to the nutritional content. A nice bread or rolls rounds out the meal.

I didn't find this overly bland, even on day 1. I loved it. I did add some salt to bring out flavors, but that is to be expected. It says to salt to taste, after all. I used green lentils instead of red because that's what I had. I found the lemon juice and cilantro oil essential and effective. I just don't think this is supposed to be some heavy tasting stew. It's meant to feel a little bit light, like a watery, south indian rasam. That said, I could see mine being too watery and bland if the flavors had been even a little less spicy or complex, so this may what made mine tasty enough: I just threw in a bunch of my own spices instead of using a store bought curry powder, so I may have gone over 1 T. More importantly, store bought powders, even nice ones, often have a lot of the blander stuff like turmeric in them, so the proportion of strong spice you are getting might not be high enough. Here are the spices I put in: generous amount of ground coriander, good amount of ground cumin, 1 dried arbol chile, 1 cardamom pod, small amounts of: ginger powder, fennel seed, allspice, turmeric, mustard powder. I disagree with the idea of using chicken or veggie stock. I think those would muddy up what is intended to be very bright, what with the lemon juice and the cilantro oil. It really seems like it's meant to be a take off on rasam, so adding any of the flavors/spices from a recipe for sambar or rasam would probably make more sense than adding stock. Asafetida is very strong and would likely help. Lime juice rather than lemon juice might also amp up the flavor.

This is a quick, easy and delicious weeknight meal. I doubled the carrots and celery. It only needed to be cooked for a much shorter time than recommended. Served it with the cilantro oil (YUM) and the basmati rice but also added toasted slivered almonds on top. Perfect!

I agree with the other reviewers. A little on the bland side but the flavors did get better when it sat for a day. I added a bit more curry powder and also thought about using chicken stock the next time. My other idea was to perhaps roast the squash first and add it later to the soup to boost the flavor a bit.

The description of this soup was mouth watering, so I ran out to the store the morning after I read the recipe in Gourmet to pick up some lentils and butternut squash. Hate to say I am a bit disappointed. There is not much nuance here. The curry overwhelms the squash and lentils and I don't think the recipes calls for enough squash. The splash of lemon juice at the end helps, but couldn't save this dish. I don't think I'd make it again, but if I did I would use chicken stock instead of water to add more layers of flavor.
