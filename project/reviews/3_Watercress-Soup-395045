Served this soup alongside the potted crab and toast points from the same article in the April 2012 issue for a light dinner. The soup is a beautiful forest green color and looks very attractive in the bowl with the dollop of cream atop. The flavor is bright and fresh and the soup is filling. I suspect, as usual with soup, that it will taste even better the next day.

Very good soup that we initially thought was a bit bland. But, as the recipe suggests, after adding sea salt, more fresh lemon juice (about 1 1/2 lemons total), and our own addition of tarragon it was really very good. The addition of the non-sweetened whip cream and chives was also important to "finish" it off. We served it to a large family gathering and teenagers all the way up to our senior citizens were asking for seconds (don't let the deep green color of the soup intimidate you). It also was very good the next day for lunch. Overall a good, healthy soup to round out a meal.
