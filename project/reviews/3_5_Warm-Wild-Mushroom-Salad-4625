I made this salad without the greens, and so it salad is great hot, cold, or room temperature and is great the next day. It is a great recipe for anyone on Weight Watchers as it is only the oil that has any points.

This was my first Epicurious recipe. It seemed bland, so I spiced it up with some cherry tomatoes and parmesan cheese. I also wilted the wild greens that I used. I think that blue cheese would have been better.

I made this dish for my first dinner party almost 10 years ago and it was a winner. It is still one of my go-to salads, however, it has mutated over time: I use only baby spinach and add crumbled goat cheese over the top. The added soft, tanginess of the goat cheese melds beautifully with the mushrooms and balsamic. We love it!

This was a good salad, but not awesome. The dressing was the best part about it. I would also add gorgonzola cheese for more zing the next time.

Very nice but I added some shaved parmesan on top of the mushrooms before serving. Delicious

Mmmm...I love wild mushrooms and the addition of the balsamic vinegar is wonderful. I had this as a first course to an Italian meal, and it was GREAT! What an easy first course to any meal.

We were pretty underwhelmed by this salad in spite of the glowing critiques from other cooks.

This salad is excellent exactly as written. The warm mushrooms coupled with the salad greens and dressing offers outstanding taste sensations. Plus its simple to make.

I really loved this salad, though it wasn't filling enough by itself. Very easy, and the dressing is simple enough for any salad.
