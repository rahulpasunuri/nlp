This is a wonderful part of a weeknight meal. I agree with newer microwaves it is about the half the time for the salmon. I used fillets instead of steaks and the marinade was perfect. Will most definately adding this to my repetoire for weeknight meals.

Very Good, but with a newer microwave the cooking time is about half. My husband thought I had marinated it for hours.

I've never poached fish - let alone microwaved it! The salmon cooked to perfection and the flavors were subtle. Showed this one to my 17-year old tree-bark eating quasi-vegan (but she loves fish). I think this is one even she can cook for a quick, delicious meal.

My husband says three forks, I say two (and that's most likely only because I prefer my salmon baked). I'll probably make this again sometime simply because it is so darned easy and moist. I may try the ginger/lemon/soy sauce on baked salmon next time. We served the salmon steaks with (Pepperoni) Spaghetti Cakes minus the pepperoni!

A certain way to poach salmon steaks. The best. I can understand perhaps feeling dissapointed by the aromatics over-powering freshly caught salmon. Why subject a fresh fish to any sort of maranade? However, it's unfair to dismiss this for your average store bought fish. It's the best.

Seldom have I been so disappointed by an Epicurious recipe with such high ratings by others. We just got a freshly caught wild salmon and decided to try this for lunch while marinating the rest to grill. My husband said he couldn't taste any flavor in the salmon beyond that of the salmon. It wasn't hard to make, but really a waste of time and ingredients. I have dozens of better salmon recipes.

I am very much a salmon-lover, but I was so disappointed in this recipe. While the ginger obscured the salmon flavour, it didn't add much taste of its own. Blech. I feel like I wasted some good salmon on this one!

Though I have never cared for salmon -other than smoked, and I seldom cook with my microwave - sometimes vegetables, this recipe was a lovely surprise. Melt in your mouth salmon. So easy and so tasty. I'll have it again and would make it for my salmon loving company. Thanks.

Not being one that uses a microwave often I was reluctant to try this. It's amazingly simple; a quick lunch for after church on Sunday.

This was SO easy. The fish tasted like it had marinated all day, instead of being just brought home. In addition to the minced ginger atop the salmon, I also added thinly sliced green onion, and then served with a garnish of black sesame seeds. The sauce was also tasty spooned over brown rice. For those interested, you can reduce the amt. of butter in the sauce (but please don't omit it altogether!) to make it INCREDIBLY diet-friendly. Even my husband who doesn't necessarily like fish loved it

It is very tasty and surprisingly fast. Will add this to my list of fish dishes.

Quick and delicious. Everyone loved it- you might want to make more sauce than they suggest.

I've been trying to poach salmon steaks for years, but somehow they never taste that good. This is a sensational solution to my problem. Moist. Not fishy. Really quick. Easy clean up too.

I quite enjoyed this recipe. I poached the salmon on the stove with great results. This recipe had a nice clean taste and was so easy to prepare.

I would recommend a garnish of tomato slices to cover the salmon slices as they are cooked in the microwave.

Nice simple & quick recipe. Lets the salmon flavor come through while adding a nice light, fresh seasoning. Easy weeknight meal.

This dish was quick and easy to make with few ingredients. I had never poached salmon in the microwave before and was impressed with how tender and flavorful it was.

This is a quick and delicious way to prepare salmon. We tried it because we had all the ingredients on hand and didn't want to go to the grocery store. It's become one of our favorites.
