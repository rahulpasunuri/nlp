Was a hit with my 10 yr old and my husband. Nice fresh summer wrap. I used fresh jalapeño rather than pickled. It's nice to use some garden herbs.

Tasty, particularly for a healthy-ish dish! I think if I made it again, I'd either cut a bit of the lime juice from the avocado spread or add more avocado, since I found the citrus a little overpowering; I love avocado and wanted to taste more of it in the sandwich.

I was so disappointed in this recipe. It tasted like I imagine those premade sandwiches at the grocery store taste. I use canned black beans a lot and so if I had to modify this I would boil the canned beans with the liquid and 2 tsp of ground cumin and a pinch of salt till they are thick and spread them on the bottom half of the tortilla and top with turkey, avocado slices, chopped tomato, cilantro and chopped fresh jalapenos and give it a squirt of lime and maybe some onion. It's way yummier and easier too.

Although I rated this recipe a 4, I didn't put the avacado into this sandwich because I don't like avacado's, I have tried several times to get liking them but just can't seem to get past the first bite, however I will make the recipe again without them, it was excelent.

This was a nice change from your average sandwich. The black bean salsa kept for days (I added some corn for crunch)and the avocado was good (although I imagined it better). A little on the bland side overall, but anyone could jazz it up with some peppers. A nice lunch alternative.

I put too much salt on this,but it was still good. The flavors are very interesting together. I left out the chiles and some of the chili powder because I don't like hot stuff. It is easy to make and good. I understand when the lady asked for where the lime comes in. The recipe ingredients say lemon juice, and the directions state lime juice.I made it with lemon juice.

The tomato goes into the salsa after the beans and before the peppers.

where does the large, vine-ripened tomato enter the salsa?
