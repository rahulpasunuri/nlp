I followed this recipe exactly as written -- no modifications -- and was not impressed. Shallots were overpowering; yet, the sauce was bland. It definitely needs some doctoring.

This was yummy! I sauteed the shallots in butter and olive oil before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients, per other reviews. I also did not strain the sauce, per other reviews, using powdered thyme. I think that I would use less shallots if not straining. All the shallots did flavor the sauce nicely, but the end result was too chunky. I did double the recipe, so I do not know if that was the reason there were so many shallots in the sauce, or if it was because the shallots were too big. I will make this recipe again.

A wonderful sauce! It even pairs well with couscous. I made a few little changes though. I diced the shallots and sauteed them in a bit of butter before adding the wine and letting it simmer for a minute. Then I added a 1/4 cup of chicken stock along with powdered thyme. After another few minutes of simmering, I added the cream and the rest of the butter, then the lemon juice. I completely left out the vinegar and didn't even strain it, but everyone asked for more sauce once they tasted it.

There is indeed beauty in simplicity. This sauce is easy to prepare and elegant. The key is to use the best ingredients available to you. When I cook, I only use wine that I would drink. The better the wine, the better the sauce. And in this case, use good butter, too. Whole Foods has a great selection of butters from Devon and Normandy. I also used fresh thyme instead of dried. A good choice for middle of the week dinner in a flash or for effortless entertaining.

Okay, here is yet another reviewer who modifies a recipe...But I do have an excuse! After most of the preparations were complete I found I was completely out of butter (and I only had rice vinegar to use.) So, I just added more cream at the end, and because I originally halved the recipe, more volume was needed too. I really thought the wine and cream an odd mix at first - it seemed about to curdle when brought together in the measuring cup, but nonetheless. the finished sensation was full, the texture velvety and the flavor beautifully delicate. Here is the real twist though - I prepared some orzo to accompany the meal and on a whim, decided to use the modified sauce to bind it together - similar in fashion to a finished risotto. I say it was quite right! Baked Salmon with Creamy Lemon-Thyme Orzo and Gently Steamed Spinach. A buttery chardonnay is a nice accompaniment too. PS: This recipe may prove be a "4 fork" sensation as a sauce base for scallops over pasta!

This is, indeed, easy. But I think it would require some serous tinkering to be a keeper. First, there is *way* too much vineager in it. Who needs to roast the fish when all of that vineager cooks it for you! I had to water it down, but you would do better by cutting the amount in half -- at least. Second, I think the preserves end up tasting, well, rather jam-like. It's a lot like mustard and jelly slathered on a piece of fish -- almost to the point where it really doesn't enhance the salmon.

I have made it numerous time. Simple, tasty and easy. Guests who are not 4 forks cook rave about this salmon.

I overcooked the salmon, but that was my fault. Next time I would try to steam or poach it, or at least add a little liquid and cover the baking pan. It dried out. The sauce was delicious. I used dried dill instead of thyme and it was very good. I would make 1 1/2 times the sauce next time, or maybe double. This is one of the quickest salmon recipes on record. Worth trying.

I used all top quality ingredients, and thought that the sauce was just fair. Not bad, just nothing special (and if I'm going to eat all that cream and butter, I want it to be special!).

I have been looking for a good salmon recipe for a while. There were a lot that were O.K. But none worth making again. This recipe was excellent. It was the best salmon dinner I ever had including restaurants. We used a 1 and 1/2 pound fillet and baked it for 30 minutes. Try it you will love it.

Oh What a wonderful dish - I made this for my Wife and she could not stop talking about it. I did blend in about 1/2 a cup more cream at the very end to smooth out the sauce - Easy Date Dinner Guys. Wink wink - goes Great with Toad Hollow Chard

Didn't expect this sauce to be so tasty with so few ingredients. But it's divine---lick-the-pan good. It must be the cream reduction that does it.

This was fantastic! Don't let the wine vinegar scare you. The sauce tastes overwhelming sampled alone, but when paired with the salmon it is subtle but delicious.

This was a delight. Generally, I do not enjoy cooked fish so I was quite surprised that I got up for 2nd's. I used fresh thyme instead of dried - the flavor of the sauce was so delicate and fabulous.

Have made it twice now, once with Atlantic salmon, the other time with Chinook salmon. Both were great, moist and tasty. I did the beurre blanc as called for and turns out right consistency.

Delicious, but a bit mild. I added extra thyme becuase I love it. Also, half way through baking I drizzled a bit of the sauce on the fish and it was very moist.

This was very nice, but given that there are both better and quicker salmon recipes on this site, I doubt I'll make it again. Nice for a change of pace though.

I would double the sauce to have extra for rice, bread, etc. I'd also suggest greasing the pan the salmon is cooked in, so it doesn't stick. I didn't have any trouble with the sause not thickening. It really does need to be cooked down before adding the butter.

The sauce was delicious and quite rich, although it didn't thicken much. I found the fish was a tiny bit dry upon baking, so next time I'd experiment with baking it in a glass dish and letting it soak up the sauce while cooking. There was a slight bitter taste in the sauce that I couldn't quite place; I'm wondering which of my ingredients might have been the culprit.

I have made this recipe many times. It is easy to do and always turns out well, so I know it will always please my guests with minimum effort on my part and no horrid surprises.

Hi. My husband, who rails against fish dishes, claimed to love this. I admit to altering the sauce to make it low fat, as I'm on a neverending diet. I used evap skimmed milk for the cream, and Brummel and Brown for the butter. It was really tasty.

EXCELLENT!!! This was even a hit with my three teenagers! My children are not big fish eater yet they have asked for it over and over again. I think that says it all. It is wonderful with wild rice and summer squash. This recipe is a real favorite around our home. It's easy, fast and makes a great presentation. I have substituted dill in this recipe many times and it is just as good , maybe better. This is really worth trying. Enjoy!

This was REALLY good! I used dill instead of thyme and doubled the sauce recipe. It never really reduced or thickened as I expected so next time I will add some thickener. Regardless, the flavor was excellent. I also served fresh asparagus and the sauce was equally delightful with that.

I forgot to add the thyme to the sauce and it was still delicious. It was good over steamed asparagus as well as the steelhead salmon. I served thyme roasted potatoes (also on epicurious) so we had plenty of thyme flavor with the meal.

I'm just getting into cooking, so I was quite pleased with how well this turned out. Very simple and straightforward, the recipe was delicious and easy to make. I'll definitely make it again.

Very simple elegant recipe, my sauce didn't get as thick as I thought it would, but since I served it with balsamic rice that tended to absorb the sauce. My husband loved it. I also made the Turkish Zuchinni pancakes for a side dish.

What a great dish!! I made it for my Inlaws and they were really inpressed. We grilled the salmon on a BBQ. I added a Tablespoon of sugar to the sauce to neutralize the tartness and instead of reducing it fully I thickened it with a little cornstarch to make it go further, but other than that it was wonderful and I would serve it again. My mother in law called a couple of days later and said that she was bragging about how I am such a gourmet cook. kudos for me!!

This recipe rocks. I had never prepared salmon like this before, and it was easy plus delcious. Reheats attempted the next day fared better than expected. Definitely a new staple in the culinary repertorie!

I have made this dish for several dinner parties and it has always been a success--it is an easy recipe to make for large groups--it is hard to screw up and is an elegant main dish.

this was a siple dish to prepare with good results. We served it with a Wild Rice Pilaf, Baby Carrots, and Haricot Verts. It made a nice presentation when we painted the entire plate with the sauce, and placed the other items on top so that all the items could benefit from the sauce. We served it with a Chateau St Michelle Chardonnay

This dish was fairly easy to make and got excellent reviews from my family and friends. I served it with rice and asparagus and a nice chardonnay. It made everyday salmon something a posh restaurant would serve. I'll make it again!

I made this dish for a dinner party and it was a hit. As the cook, it was very easy to prepare because the salmon is baked. I am going to make it again. I served it on a bed of fresh sauteed spinich and mushrooms. A very nice presentation.
