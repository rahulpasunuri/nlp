Was very good!

Eh. I've tried this recipe twice and still I think it is a little bland. I was looking for a twist on my usual baked haddock but this isn't it. I won't give it a third chance.

I have made this recipe for years, never deviate from the preparation instructions, and end up with perfect fish every time. Adding a bit of Dijon mustard with the mayo was a wonderful addition. Thanks for the suggestion

Great midweek recipe. I browned the sauteed onions with the finely diced bacon -- the carmelized onion has a wonderful flavor! I also mixed a bit of dijon mustard into the mayonaise spread onto the fish before the topping. This was so easy and delicious. Impressive enoug for guests. Served with cauliflower with bacon, capers & breadcrumbs and asparagus.

Great mid-week meal. The kids loved it. Per previous suggestions, added lemon juice to the mayo and lemon zest to the crumb mixture. Skipped the pickles because they're not pickle people, and subbed shallots for onions. Sauteed late-summer zucchini in the bacon/shallot pan: Oh, SNAP.

Simple and delicious. Unless I'm buying my fish directly from the fish market and know that it's super fresh, I soak it in milk for 1/2 hr. Applied tips from previous reviewers like using panko crumbs and adding fresh dill, a little dijon and some lemon juice to the mayo. Also, cooking for 10 min. at 450 and placing until broiler for a few minutes to brown the top. Perfect.

My husband and I love this dish and eat it regularly. It always works. We use 4 slices of bacon but microwave them first, then saute the onion and pickle in olive oil to remove saturated fat.

Made with refrigerated fresh dill pickles and it came out fine. Quick and easy. Great with asparagas.

This was pretty good, but I wasn't crazy about the pickles (and I love pickles!).I used panko and added a little bit of lemon juice to the mayo, as was suggested by previous reviewers. I'll probably make this again on a weekday night, but won't add the pickles.

Phenomenal. I modified mine as well using the tips from the Bethesda Cook. I had leftover bacon from this morning's breakfast. I used 2 tablespoons butter to cook the onion and 1 minced garlic clove. I then tossed it with the panko, lemon zest and crumbled bacon. The lemon juice was mixed with the mayo and spread over the filets. The rest of the lemon was massaged over both sides of the fish filets. This dinner will be served again, for guests!

Couldn't be easier or tastier! Cut the pickles and added some chopped almonds. Used only enough mayo to hold topping. Also served with Konriko Pecan rice, asparagas and hollandaise sauce. Totally great meal, easy as pie to make. Any white fish will do.

This is an old fav of mine.I use it on any mild white fish like tilapia that needs to be jazzed up. It appeared in a 1993 Gourmet so its an oldie. I make it just as written. Whoops. I do use dill pickle relish. Basically it's a breaded fish with tartar sauce. Easy and really good.Is it guest worthy...probably not.Try it as written, then springboard off of it and do your own thing.

This is an UREAL dish. SO GOOD! We used cod fillets and it was just delicious. The combo of smearing the mayo and putting the diced pickles in there give it almost a tartar sauce flavor. Just fantastic.

This was surprisingly tasty. I added a few chopped pecans. I don't think I'd add the pickles again. That was weird.

My husband loved this! Cod is his favorite fish, so I experimented with this recipe tonight since I had all of the ingredients (except the dill pickle, but I just used sweet relish instead). It was so easy, cooked up perfectly, was nice and moist, and the crust added a great taste & texture! I'll definitely be making this again.

I thought the pickles would add an interesting texture and flavor. They made the fish tangy, but it was not a flavorful dish. I would not make this again.

This is a perfect recipe for someone who loves to play around and alter. Follow the basic deal and you have a great beginning. I added a bit (tablespoon perhaps) of dijon mustard to the bacon/onion/crumb mixture and substituted chopped garlic-stuff green olives for the pickle. I thought it was great and so did my servees.

This is our favorite fish recipe. I've been making it for a couple years. Regardless if it is for just my husband and myself or for guests, it always turns out great. Guests love it! And it is so simple.

Delicious weeknight recipe, very easy and a great way to enjoy cod! The only change I made was to use Panko and I added italian seasoning to the bread crumb mixture and eliminated the dill pickles (none in the house).

I made this again last night. It is the type of recipe that is very good on its own or easy to modify. I did not change much. I often freeze my sandwich bread, so I toasted some oat bread just enough to defrost and crisp it. I kept the bacon lean, added some Old Bay and lemon, and will probably "tweak" it more the next time.

Rating: 3
The suggestion to broil for the last five minutes was a good one. I omitted the pickles and added one tspn of Old Bay to the breading mixture and overall it was very tasty. I would definitely make it again.

Our whole family loved this dish. The only change that I made was that I used some sun-dried tomato and greek olive bread cumbs which I had in the freezer. We will make this again and again.....I might put some capers in next time!

Excellent, with the following modifications: instead of regular breadcrumbs, used japanese breadcrumbs (panko) -- they are unseasoned, and are made with honey. Coated the fish with romoulade instead of mayo, and tossed the breadcrumbs with the bacon and onions -- plus fresh chopped dill. Finally, squeezed half a lime on the fish. Baked at 450 for 10 minutes, and finished in broiler for barely a minute to crisp the topping. Turned out amazing -- flaky moist fish, crisp coating.

The fish I used was Tilapia (new for Epicurious), added 1/2 tsp. Cajun seasoning to the crumb mix, and it was a hit with no other changes.

Great recipe, although I altered it a bit. Cooked the bacon in butter, and poured off about half the dripping. Sauted shallots in place of onions, then added the bread crumbs and dried parsley, leaving out the pickles. Spread a thin layer of mayo (mixed with lemon juice) on the fish and patted down the crumb mixture. Baked 15 minutes and it was perfect. Be sure your oven is very hot, even 425*, so that the crust crisps. And check for doneness after 10 minutes.

The topping was bitter and the cod was dry.

I thought this was very good, I added chopped pistachio's to the bread crumbs, it gives an interesting texture. I also mixed fresh lemon juice with the mayo before spreading. I served it with wild rice and grilled asparagus with saffron aioli mayo which I found at this site, very delicious!

My whole family loved this dish. My wife says it may even be the best crust I've done so far. I used dried homemade bread crumbs and it worked just fine. Also, as another reviewer pointed out, adding some lemon juice to the mixture works well.

We had this dish for dinner last night, and I'd make it again. Very tasty, although not on my top ten list of those I would hand down to the next generation. I think next time, I'd use regular (dry) breadcrumbs instead of fresh, as it was a little too doughy; maybe add a bit more mayo. The pickles add a nice, unexpected flavor.

well received recipe from all i have made it for. I do enhance the topping by adding minced garlic to the sauteing onion as well as lemon juice and chopped parsley to the crumbs. the mayonnaise can be mixed w/ the crumbs also so it's easy to place on the fish. This has become a regular in my menu planning.

This recipe brings new life to an old favorite--baked cod with a bread crumb topping. This topping is tangy, crunchy and really satisfying. I've shared this recipe with friends and they agree. Although some find the addition of pickles peculiar, I find they add interesting taste and texture. My family loves this recipe!
