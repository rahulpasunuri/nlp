I had almost all these ingredients (no tomato), which is how I found this recipe. I used powdered chipotle and whole wheat penne and added some roasted corn, half a green pepper, and my homemade broth. My husband cleaned both our bowls with chunks of bread. Homey and delicious.

I had a lot of fun with this recipe, though I took a few lessons learned from the reviews and made it my own. I substituted several ingredients (because I'm too haphazard to measure out a tablespoon of chopped garlic) and it came out phenomenally. I used one whole medium gold/yellow onion, three cloves of garlic (chopped), two 10.5 ounce cans of broth, two 8 ounce cans of tomato sauce, and i used about a half a bottle of red wine in lieu of the extra broth. The rest of the recipe I followed as written, and it came out beautifully. I'd only recommend a bread to go with it, because the sauce was simply to die for, and you need something to mop it up with. I have enough left over to share with my friends tomorrow, and I've already made copies of the recipe with my ingredient modifications to hand out to all. Give it a try, and don't be afraid to make it your own!

I hesitated after reading many of the reviews. However, I tried it out with some modifications (my own as well as others'). I didn't use the beef broth. Instead I used a cup or so of a Merlot. As well, I made it with Brown Rice Pasta (my son is gluten-intolerant). Because rice pasta tends to leave a starchy residue in it's water, I opted to cook it on it's own until it was almost done. Then I drained and rinsed it and threw it into the rest of the recipe pot for about five minutes. As well, I used extra lean ANGUS ground beef. This was AMAZING! I highly recommend using a hi-grade extra lean meat. It has so much flavor even before you add all the other ingredients. In the end, it was a hit! Perfect balance of flavor. I can't imagine using 61/2 cups of beef broth!!! Way too salty! Less red wine in it's place makes for an added sweetness and it's not too runny. Just right!!!

"pedestrian ingredients"? Ummm if you were expecting something fancy, perhaps you shouldn't have selected a recipe with a title as straightforward as "Pasta with Beans and Beef". I liked it. Kid friendly and inexpensive, though I made mine with vegetable stock & vegetarian ground beef so didn't have the problem of the beef stock overpowering everything. Next time I'll add a russet potato so I can really carb out.

Bluck. Very pedestrian ingredients produce a disappointing result. I keep thinking: What could I add to make this more palatable? Answer: Just start over with a different recipe.

This recipe is edible but incredibly disappointing. The Beef broth overtakes the palate. You can't really distinguish other ingredients.

After starting and tasting the recipe as written and having read the reviews, I doctored it a bit as well. I added a can of fire-roasted crushed tomatoes, 1/2 c. of pureed tomatoes, a can of diced tomatoes and an extra can of beans (black & white beans) and a 1/2 c. of red wine. I also added a green pepper, used 1/2 box of macaroni. A little more onion powder and garlic powder, and it had a lot more flavor. I'll see how my daughter likes it - I want to keep this one on hand for cold winter evenings.

I took some other reviewers suggestions and made this recipe a little differently than described. The main thing I did differently was I didn't add any broth. I made the pasta separately so their was no need for all that liquid. I also sauteed the garlic only 1 min. before adding the meat because garlic gets bitter when cooked too long. I used ground turkey instead of beef which worked fine.I used classico 3 cheese sauce which is delicious.* the suggestion I took from the reviewers was to add: 1/2- 3/4 c. red wine along with the sauce, and a splash of good balsamic vinegar at the end. With the addition of these last two items it transformed the dish from a little boring to something quite tasty!! I stirred in the cooked pasta {farfalle} at the end. I will make it this way again doing all of the above!

I have been making this recipe for my family since it was printed over ten years ago. It is a great simple dish that never fails to please. I typically use Campbell's beef broth which is double strength and often toss in some spinach to wilt at the end. Nothing fancy, but a great hearty weekday supper.

hmmmmm this is almost simular to my grandmas dish although she used pork and beans and just elbow noodles and ground beef only.

My husband and I liked this recipe. I changed it a bit adding less beef broth and a small can of tomato paste. Makes it more tomato-y otherwise it doesn't have much taste. My grandmother used to make something like this which was really great and I have yet to recreate it!

Ok, so it is a pretty boring recipe, but with a little help it was not bad at all. I substituted a good Italian red wine for a cup or so of the beef broth and added some balsamic vinegar near the end. Also served topped with parmesan cheese. Good for a hurried weeknight when you don't have much time....

The best I can say about this dish: it was filling; but otherwise pretty untasty. I think I was looking for something more tomato-y, kind of like a spaghetti with meat sauce, so my expectations might have gotten in the way.

Like the rest of the reviewers, this wasn't fancy but it was pretty good. You don't need fancy meals all the time, who has time for it? Sometimes simple is good also. My husband doesn't care for pasta but said it was good. I agree with another reviewer who said it need more beans. But overall a nice weeknight meal.

Yes, it's Hamburger Helper without the helper, but what's wrong with that? Quick, easy, the kids love it and the adults do too. I did add some extra spices/herbs to give it more flavor. Goes beautifully with green salad and steamed veges.

We make this the other night - it was surprisingly good.

While not very sophisticated, this was a very good dish. It is so simple and is just a really great comfort-food meal. I thought it could use more beans.

I started this recipe and goofed so much and still turned out great. Used 2 pounds og ground sirloin (did not mean to) did not have fresh garlic so used garlic powder and found out I was out of elbow pasta so used 16 ounce package of eggless noodles.....we all loved it. lp

My husband and one of my sons absolutely loves this dish - it has become a staple in our household. Not fancy, but a great weekday meal, that can be prepared ahead and reheated. I sometimes use chili-flavored beans rather than plain for a little more flavor.

Very Hamburger-Helper-like. Smelled bad, tasted bad...

We have made this great dish on numerous occasions and even my small kids love it. I usually add some chopped spinach at the end, cooking it just until it wilts. Sometimes I even substitute ground turkey for the beef, pinto beans for the kidney beans and chicken broth for the beef broth. No matter, it is always a great, quick, one-dish meal.

This meal tasted even better as a "left over" meal. It was hearty and healthy for a family dinner.

This dish is good but it needed something I added chili mix and when I served I sprinkled monteray jack cheese on it and served hot corn muffins with it it was very satisfing
