this is an expensive labor intensive torte.Ihave made it 4 times in 6wks.It is so scrumptious that my husband keeps requesting it and he is a professional baker! It is well worth the effort and mess to make it.The butter cream icing can give trouble when applying it on the outside of the cake..it melts too soft if you handle it too long.Its cold here so I ice it on the kitchen counter with the window open..I freeze but the icing goes on perfectly.

I did not love this recipe. Everything turned out fine - the frosting came together as expected. I did find the frosting flavor to be too strong with the flavor of coffee and also all of the butter gave it a greasy feel. Re a previous reviewer's problem regarding chunks of chocolate in the frosting. It sounds as if the chocolate cooled too long. The cake was ok; however, I thought that it was too rich. Coupled with the very rich icing it was just too much for me.

I have made so many cakes from scratch in the last few years that I've started getting birthday orders from friends, but I've never had anything turn out like this recipe. The butter cream was a straight-forward and tastes fab, but even following the recipe intstructions to the 'T' for the walnut torte and doing the fool-proof toothpick test, after I inverted the cake onto a baking sheet the bottom was a slimy and stinking gray slim/gel/mass. What went wrong? I'm tempted to try it again just to see if I get the same results looking like something out of an X-Files episode...

Maybe I'm just slow - but I didn't like this at all. I specialize in homemade cakes, so this was not a novice error - and I chose this because everyone else gave it such rave reviews! I prepared it for New Year's - it wasn't difficult, but the end result was rather bland, and the frosting did NOT come out pretty. Preparing the frosting according to the directions - the chocolate did not mix well with the buttercream resulting in (what I had to call if for the sake of my ego in front of my guests!) Chocolate Chip Mocha Buttercream! I didn't have time to do it over, and couldn't pipe it with all the chunks of chocolate, so I had to frost the entire thing. Argh!

I made this for a dessert contest at the office and won. I loved the flavor combination. I was also able to find seedless blackberry preserves, which made it easier. I will make this for the holidays again!

Very,very good.Comments included delicious,great,light,different. Couldn't decide between 3or 4 forks,so went w/4. No problem with cake size.Used more blackberry jam. NOTE: Let cake sit at room temp at least 3-4 hours, so buttercream is soft.

Yummy! Made this for husband's birthday, raving reviews! Only next time, I'd slather more jam onto each of the layer and put less sugar on the torte/cake and the buttercream. One trick so that the torte layers won't shrink when cooled is NOT to butter the sides of the pan. The batter will 'climb' up the sides and stuck there while cooling. After it is cooled, simply slide a knife to cut it loose.The jam really makes the difference and add the je-ne-sais-quoi quality.

This is an excellent cake, but the recipe is also a lot of work. I couldn't find blackberry preserve so I used loganberry which was also delicious. I think this recipe is flexible in that way. I'd make it again, but perhaps use seedless raspberry jam instead of having to strain the preserve. I didn't have a pastry bag either so I cut a tiny hole in the tip of plastic grocery bag which worked fine!

This cake was wonderful! This was my first experience with making buttercream, and it turned out beautifully (but beware that it melts quite quickly out of the fridge). I used a 10 1/2x15 1/2 x 2 baking sheet, and the cake shrunk to just the size specified in the recipe.

A lot of work. I had to bake 2 cakes (in a cookie sheet) to get the height. I also, used almonds instead of walnut. It was a huge hit. The icing is wonderful as well!
