Nothing special. Needs some additional flavor.

There's a much better version of this, but it needs to be prepared a day ahead, to give the flavors time to mingle (but seriously, it's worth it). Boil the green beans for 3/4 minutes in salted water. Saute the pancetta cubes in some olive oil for 2 minutes, then add the drained beans. Sprinkle a little Spanish paprika over everything, saute for another minute, then turn off heat and add a splash or two of sherry vinaigrette. Refrigerate overnight, and reheat the following day. Totally delicious with anything, but particularly fish (e.g. tilapia)

I was completely unimpressed by this recipe. For all the fat that goes into it, I expected my mouth to burst with flavor, but no such luck.It just tasted like green beans and bacon -- nothing special. Were I to have a hankering for a quick green bean recipe again, I'd probably just steam them and toss with sea salt, freshly ground pepper and some garlic. This wasn't much work -- but even at that, it wasn't quite worth it.

My neighbor added sliced shallots and it was great!

Excellent recipe -- quick and delicious. As suggested by other reviewers, I added a bit of good quality balsamic vinegar at the end - - lovely.

Amazingly good! Be sure to use a good pancetta, the pre-packaged kind in the grocery store is alright, but freshly sliced pancetta is so much better. We cooked this in a cast iron skillet on top of our grill, didn't bother to remove the pancetta, just threw the beans right in. Next time we'll try it without the butter, the pancetta renders down and the butter is superfluous.

This has become a staple for dinner parties and holiday meals. I fry the pancetta earlier on the day of the meal and cook the bean ahead of time as well. I leave the pancetta dripping in the pan. Then all I have to do before we eat is add the butter and reheat the pan before adding the green beans.

Simple and so delicious as is--these are even better if made with Irish Rashers--my 3 and 5 yr old were actually fighting over who would get the second helpings--WOW! And my husband and 1 yr old loved them, too. New favorite way to serve green beans.

This was easy and this was a great way to use some fresh beans. These go fast!!

We make this quite often as my wife enjoys green beans. Several comments: 1.) My favorite variant involves adding the cooked pancetta to roasted -- rather than boiled -- green beans. 2.) As noted, balsamic or other vinegars work well as additions. 3.) Be aware the pancetta imparts quite a bit of salt. Enjoy.

I have been making this recipie for years and it is my hubby's fave! In fact it is the only way he will eat green veggies! I sometimes add a drizle of olive oil and balsamic with kosher salt and black pepper it is very good too! This is definately a must try if you are looking for something other than boring old beans!

I've been making this for years, with either bacon or pancetta. I always finish the dish with a splash of truffle oil for added depth of flavor.

Wonderful and EASY. Great take on side dish. Added some fresh chopped tarragon with the butter at the end. Big difference. Try it. Might try adding a little roasted red pepper for color next time.
