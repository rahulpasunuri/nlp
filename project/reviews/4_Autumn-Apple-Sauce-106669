I substituted 2 ripe pears for 2 apples and no sweetener was necessary. This solves the "sugar v splenda" dilemma!

I agree that omitting the cider is good, HOWEVER skip the Splenda since it is a chemical has been known to cause cancer. Use Stevia instead.

For a small dinner party last weekend, I made Autumn Apple Sauce to accompany Cornish hens with sausage stuffing. It was fabulous! The assorted apples gave the sauce a rich and interesting taste. Following the advice of other reviewers I made the following modifications: (1) Omitted the apple cider and replaced with water and, (2)omitted the sugar and used 4 packets of Splenda. It had the perfect sweetness without the sugar that pleased all of my Diabetic-conscious guests.

The recipe as written is way too sweet for my taste. I did reduce the sugar, as many reviewers wrote, but I still found it too sweet. Wish I had listened to the many who said to omit it! I didn't have cider on hand so I just used water. In the end- I would make it again with no sugar and water instead of cider. Great way to use up leftover apples!

Cooks tips: Taste the sauce before adding the sugar - you may decide not to use any, or as much. If you do, use brown sugar instead of white sugar for more flavor. Optionally, you can add some maple syrup. Make sure the cinnamon stick is near the bottom of the pot while cooking the apples, otherwise you won't get much flavor out if it sits at the top. Cooking with the cinnamon sticks adds a nice hint of cinnamon, but to put some cinnamon in the sauce add ~1 tsp of ground cinnamon. If you don't have an apple corer, using a mellon baller works great. If you make this recipe in the fall, you'll easily be able to double or triple the recipe while the apples are abundant and in season, then can or freeze the extra.

i agree this recipe is easy and delicious.. but if you have a food processor, leave the skins on! that's where all the nutrients are! and you don't have to spend the time peeling the apples!

Really great! I added some ground cinnamon and used less sugar since the apple cider was sweet. excellent served warm with dessert or for a winter snack!

Delicious! I added about a half a cup of cranberries for a holiday twist and it was exquisite!Today I am trying a variation with clementines rather than lemon juice.

super easy for a beginner cook. I had 7 large apples from a local farmer and followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I used a regular potato peeler and an apple corer/slicer to speed up the process. Then I cut the slices in exactly half which were pretty big chunks. I covered the pot to expedite and soon had soft apple sauce. 4 mashes with a potato masher and voila!

yumm! So easy! I used 4 different kinds of apples: 1 red delicious, 1 really huge matsu, 3 golden russets, and 3 macintosh. The texture differences were great. I didn't add any apple cider or sugar- just water and cinnamon, and it was perfect!

Who knew applesauce could be so easy and so delicious!I did not have a cinnamon stick so I used just a dash of ground cinnamon. Yummy!

I make this recipe every autumn and can gallons of it to enjoy throughout the year and give away as gifts. This apple sauce tastes like apple pie filling. It is incredible. There is no going back to store bought after trying this. Prepare yourself!

This couldn't be easier. I made it using MacIntosh apples...the hardest part was peeling/coring the apples. Skipped adding sugar. It turned out great to accompany pork roast, but I add some sugar when I mix it with yogurt. Fresh, fast, healthy, and low cost!!

This was sooo good and sooo easy. I needed applesauce for pork chops and to avoid shopping tried this recipe. It was perfect. i didn't use any sugar at all, all Macintosh apples, water and ground cinnamon. It was better than any I've found in the store.

excellent and simple! I added a pear, and didn't use citrus. I also used half brown and half regular sugar. Delicious with Maxine's Latkes!

great, easy recipe. i agree that you don't need to buy cider, just chop up some apples, throw a little lemon on them, half a cup of water, and tada! i used a cinnamon stick, but agree that you can use ground as well. great on pork chops.

Excellent! I used water instead of the apple cider as another reviewer suggested. I prefer a chunky apple sauce so I didn't mash it after the cooking. It's perfect!

I make this recipe every year to accompany latkes. You can NEVER go wrong with this recipe. Use a variety of fresh organic apples and you will be eating this out of the bowl, I guarantee it. This is a four star recipe because it is simple to shop for and easy to prepare and always turns out great no matter what! Enjoy!!

This simple sauce works very well - a good hint of cinnamon and a chunky texture leave it a choice for cold pork or inclusion in an apple cake. I think it should keep longer than 5 days - that is if it doesn't get raided in the fridge!

yum! working with what i limited supplies i used 1/4 cup light brown sugar, 2 t ground cinnamon, and water for the cider. left the skins on and mashed a little. perfect warm, with pork chops and just as good with breakfast the next morning!

Delicious, quick & easy dish. I brought it to a dinner party where the main dish was pork sausage and the two complimented each other wonderfully. I used all macintosh-- which cooked alot quicker than the recipe suggested (about 10 mins), and required less water. I used water instead of apple cider and found the dish plenty sweet. Awesome balance of tart, sweet, and cinnamon-y. And I used about 1/2 a tbsp of ground cinnamon instead of a cinnamon stick. I left the skins on-- which adds a pleasant chewy consistancy like baked apples. Yum!

This is the best apple sauce I've ever had! I've already made it 4 or 5 times. Each time I make it you can here "Can I please have some more?" Really great recipe!

My family took a trip to the orchard last weekend and came back homeloaded down with apples. This is a perfect way to use them up and hand out as Autum gifts. As far as the food processor question goes... You core the apples, just leaving the peels. I make a baby food in a simular way (although I cheat and use my hand blender) and it does come out a beautiful pink.

I have a question for the reviewer who spoke of the food processor - do you toss the apples into your foodprocessor core, seeds and all? Couldn't be, but other than that it sounds delicious!

Rating: 3
If you have a food processor, cook apples with peels, place in food processor and process for a few seconds. You'll have a nice red apple sauce.

For more applesauce recipes, spell it without the space between apple and sauce. I used brown sugar, a dash of salt and a pat of butter toward the end and thought it was very good. also, if you do not have cider, boil the peels and core in 1 1/4 cup of water and use that.

Excellent. I used freshly juiced apple instead of the cider.

I tried this recipe because our apple tree was overflowing and I needed to do something with all of the apples! The recipe was very easy and the result is delicious. I think we all liked it better warm, right after it was made, than after it had chilled for awhile.
