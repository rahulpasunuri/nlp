I've made this soup several times with and without shrimp and using regular low sodium chicken broth. It is always excellent and always super fast!

Excellent soup, everybody loved it but I found it a little complicated since I had to make a second recipe to obtain one of its ingredients, the Nonya chicken stock. Next time I will try it with regular chicken stock.
