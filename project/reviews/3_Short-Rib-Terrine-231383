Great basic recipe. Im a chef, and I used my own honey bbq sauce, but slow cooked the short ribs, then layerd with truffled mashed potatos and baby bok choy cooked with salt, pepper, and butter. Its been a hit in my restaurant when I run it as a special!!!! Go ahead, try it!

This is a tasty recipe, but it is labor intensive. The broth recipe seem like an added incentive (hey, I get two tapas out of this!) but even considering the bonus, it takes a lot of work. (Also, people aren't crazy about the broth). However, of all the tapas included in Gourmet's article, this was one of the favorites. I didn't smash it down like a terrine but rather fluffed the meat with a fork after it had sat a bit and absorbed all of the flavors. I served it on a plate with sliced baguette, a pile of capers, and a pile of sea salt. Guests assembled the components themselves and truly enjoyed it.
