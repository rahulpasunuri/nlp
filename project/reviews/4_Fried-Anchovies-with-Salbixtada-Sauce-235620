Yum. Really interesting recipe. I used trout fillets, because that's what I had. The sauce was delicious. Very fresh and summery. I love garlic, but I'd probably half the amount indicated here - way too intense. For 2 servings, this was a lot of sauce! I can definitely see using it on other things, but I have a large bowl left over.
