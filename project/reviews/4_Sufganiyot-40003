Fantastic! My minor variations were: almond milk, vanilla instead of cinnamon, allowed to rise in a warm place for about 1 1/2 hours until doubled, and rolled the dough between 1/4 and 1/2 inches and added the jelly after frying. Light as a feather!

My tongue has been grazed by the recipe's picture alone. I thought I'm only able to find recipes like this at gourmandia.com but I guess its not. Sometimes its also good to explore the web for something new.

These turned out great and were worth the work! Lots of fun to do with the kids. One minor negative is, like any fresh pastry, they weren't very good the next day, so plan accordingly. A few minor changes: we cheated and used a standing mixer with dough hook instead of hand-kneading. We did not sift the flour. I think sifting and kneading may have may a fluffier result, but I don't think it would be much of an improvement. Instead of waiting overnight in the fridge, we just left the dough ball out for a few hours and it rose a lot without any problem. Even after we assembled them and waited, they kept growing almost right before our eyes! We filled them with chocolate filling instead of jelly and glazed them with a conventional doughnut glaze. We'll do this again next year for sure, but maybe with a better filling.

I made this twice: once last year with method listed in the recipe. Needless to say, it was a bit messy and the pieces didn't stay together. This year, I tried out the recipe a little early. I rolled out the dough a little fatter (1/4 inch) and then fried each round. I then rolled it in sugar, cut a slit in the side of the doughnut and used a piping bag to put the jelly inside. WAY easier! The sufganiyot stayed in one piece and looked good enough to be sitting in the shuk on ben yehudah street!

Needed to lower the temp on the oil. I found that doing one piece and injecting worked better than the method in the recipe. I used 1 tsp filling since my friend from Israel said it needed more. The dough keeps so you can do few for one day and a few the next day.

I made these with my 3.5 year old son, who loved making them. (I did the frying alone.)I let them rise for 2 hours in a warm kitchen instead of over night. They were delicious, but a little stiff--I'lltry to let them rise longer next time. I'll also add vanilla and a bit of lemon zest to brighten the flavors. But still--a big hit, a great new (old) tradition, and the warm farmers' market strawberry jam oozing out was divine.

I made the dough in the bread machine and added 1 tsp vanilla. Delicious! I also added an extra 1/4 cup of flour to keep the dough from sticking.

I made this recipe in my bread machine.The only alteration I made to the ingredients was to add 1/4 cup of flour because as the dough was mixing it was sticking to the wall of the mixing bowl. Used milk not water. yum!and easy.

Yum! Comes together beautifully. No need to rise in fridge overnight... just 1.5 hours in a warm place.

As an Israeli, I'd like to say the new trend it to bake the sufganiot, use different frostings (like chocolate) and creative fillings like pistachio and halva. The classic however is strawberry filling with powdered sugar on top.

Don't be intimidated by a yeast dough recipe. I have little experience with this technique and I found it to be very easy (and fun). I even transported the rising dough to my friend's house on a cold night. This did not seem to affect the final product. We did have a little trouble keeping the oil the correct temp. I'd err on keeping it too low...donuts burnt quickly when temp reached 400. Even then, final product was delicious. We chose to dip them in jam instead of filling. Saved time and tasted just as good.

this recipe was a huge hit at our daughter's hanukkah party. found filling the donuts with jelly after frying to be much easier using a turkey baster

Delicious! It tasted just as good, even better than what I would find at a bakery! The only change I made to the recipe is substituting one teaspoon of vanilla instead of the ground cinnamon.

the recipe was good. I thought of giving it two stars but i hadnt followed itto the T so i figured it wasnt fair to do that. I made the dough as per the recipe but melted the butter and added it straight into the ingredients before mixing,kneaded it, let it rise overnight, punched it dn.,rolled it out to about 1/4in. thick and cut about 14 doughnuts out of it. I then let it rise again, but even after a half an hour it hadnt risen much. I fried the dough, anyway, and then filed them with a pastry bag. The doughnuts however were pretty flat. I thus suggest, if filling this way, the dough should be re-kneaded after it is punched down, then rolled and then cut... I think if done this way the dough will rise properly. The dough nonetheless had a very good taste, and went especially well with the raspberry jam.

This was delicious, though I did some research and decided to fill the doughnuts after frying them using a pastry bag outfitted with a 1/2" tip, instead of using the method described here. I rolled the dough a bit thicker, let them rise, fry, drain and cool. Then I poked the tip of the pastry bag into the side of the doughnut, squeezed in some jelly and rolled the whole thing in sugar. It was quite a hit.

I just made this recipe with my 3 1/2 yr old daughter. We did it all in one day. She loved kneading and cutting and since we had to wait for the dough to rise between steps there was just enough at each step to keep her interested and then she could break for another activity. I fried them myself (of course), but she got to shake them in a bag with confectioner's sugar! We all loved them. They will definitely be a new Hanukkah tradition in our family.

Just made this recipe but I did not refrigerate the dough overnight. I just let it rise like a normal yeast dough (in a warm place until doubled), then assembled as the recipe indicates. The doughnuts needed to be crimped closed again after the 30-minute rise. I had some leftover dough so cut it in rounds and fried it without filling. The filled and unfilled were all delicious. Get them out of the house as soon as possible or they will be in you! I plan on having kids do the cutting and assembly while I do the frying at my son's hanukkah party.

If you haven't made a lot of fried yeasted breads before, do a test run on this recipe to avoid disappointing both yourself and a child. The overnight rise in the refrigerator left my dough with a hard crust and an alcohol odor, indications of over-rising. I will try it again,though, but alone. I have huge safety concerns about making sufganiyot with enthusiastic children who probably would want to watch the cooking process. Children close to pans filled with hot oil frighten me.
