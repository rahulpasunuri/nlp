So easy, and a perfect pairing with roast meats. Made as written - there's nothing to it. Delicious!

I subbed olive oil for veg oil and added a little bit of extra horseradish and mustard to the mixture because we're big fans of both flavors. Everyone loved it and I have been asked to make it again. It is a tad time consuming but usually that's half the fun for me anyway.

I made it with potatoes AND sweet potatoes, and the sweet potatoes were GREAT!!!

Very interesting recipe. I made some extra mustard-horseradish sauce to go with a steak I had with the potatoes. I also added a little bit of tarragon to it. Delicious combination.

I've made his recipe every year for Christmas dinner since it was 1st published in BA. It goes fab with Prime Rib. I only sneak in a touch of horseradish as my kids don't like it and it still tastes great.

Wonderful twist on potatoes. I substituted olive oil for butter and taste was still good.
