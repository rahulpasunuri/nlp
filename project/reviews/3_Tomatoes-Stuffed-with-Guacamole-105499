I made these (about 50) for my soccer team for a snack when we were in a soccer tournament. They were alot of work, but worth the effort. They were nice and light, and a good use for my abundant crop of grape tomatoes.

This is a good recipe but would be best in cherry tomatoes. As is too much guac and not enough tomato. BUT, the flavor is good. I didn't do the lime & oil drizzle. I just added the lime to the avocado mixture.

These were quite beautiful, but somehow their flavor was disappointing -- a little bland. It needs something more, maybe garlic, or more jalapeno (mine wasn't very spicy)? I usually love to eat guacamole by the spoonful... so I know this could be better with some modifications. I would suggest to make your favourite guacamole recipe, reduce the chopped tomatoes, and stuff that mixture into tomatoes. I used cherry tomatoes, but my husband thought they were too sweet for the guacamole, and hindered the flavor of the dish.

This recipe was a great addition to our Holiday party! I loved the color scheme! I used grape tomatoes and hollowed them out with a 1/4 teaspoon measuring spoon, worked well. I would add a little more lemon juice to keep the flavor other than that. I loved this recipe.

"too much concentration of guacamole" - hmm - well, they ARE tomatoes stuffed with guac now aren't they? good recipe for cherry tomatoes as previously suggested.

The guacamole was great, but the tomatoes suggested were too big for appetizers. Might make a better side dish. For appetizers cherry tomatoes would be great, just a lot of work.

Haven't tried this yet, but it seems that this would be a nice hors d'oeuvre if you used large cherry tomatoes. Has anyone tried it?

I felt it was too much concentration of guacamole. That's just my personal opinion, but it didn't go over with my guests too well either.
