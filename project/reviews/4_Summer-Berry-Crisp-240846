I love this recipe but typically make a few changes: peaches, blueberries and strawberries are my favourite combo in season, no sugar added to the berries, only the brown sugar in the topping and this time I added pecans to the topping as well. So simple and so delicious!!

This was awesome! Possibly the easiest and best summer dessert I've ever made. Because we had one vegan, I substituted "I can't believe it's not butter" for butter in the topping and it worked fine. No doubt it is even better with the real thing. Everyone loved it!

Simple yet delicious. I'm sure you could substitute any combination of fruits..not just berries. I did have the berries but didn't have the rolled oats so I substituted with 1 cup of the 12 grain mixture I use to make bread. It has rolled oats, flax seed, sunflower seed, etc. I then added 1 cup of chopped and lightly roasted walnuts and almonds. Absolutely fabulous!

This recipe was so easy and perfect for a large crowd... not fussy at all. I used sour cherries, black raspberries, and blueberries that I had picked at a farm earlier this summer and then frozen. The sour cherries were the biggest hit! What a great way to make summer fruit shine.

I used blueberries and blackberries (6 cups) and followed another reviewers suggestion about adding crushed lavender buds. I added 1 Tbsp to the berry mixture and WOW! It was delicious. Try it you'll love it!

So juicy and sweet! I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys fruity desserts. I used half the sugar in the crisp topping. Probably could have used less sugar in the fruit mixture, too. Next time I might use some vanilla sea salt on the top of the crisp just for giggles.

So delicious and easy . . . no crust to deal with - perfect during summer berry season. Everyone loved it!

One of the easiest desserts to make. I love the simplicity of this recipe, all the ingredients are always in my house. I use frozen mixed berries in the winter time and reduce the sugar for both the filling and topping because I like to taste more fruit than sugar. The only addition I make to this recipe is the juice of one lemon to the fruit mixture. Serve with either vanilla ice cream or a mascarpone/whipped cream mixture. I love this recipe.

I made this for my boyfriend after he took this MCAT, and three weeks later, he is still raving. I love simple recipes, and this was amazing. I made the recipe exactly as stated, and served it with some vanilla ice cream. Just perfect.

This recipe is so fantastic, I make it all the time in the summer. I also like to modify it a little each time, playing with flavors and spices (I usually add nutmeg and clove to the topping, as well as cinnamon). My parents have a lavender farm, so I often experiment with culinary lavender. Try crumbling up 1-2 tablespoons culinary lavender bud and mixing it in with the berries. Subtle, but delicious - people won't be able to put their finger on it, but they'll know it tastes more "gourmet" than the average berry crisp.

This is a very easy recipe that will DEFINITELY be a crowd-pleaser! I used 6 cups fresh blueberries (just picked during our vacation)and did not alter any of the sugar proportions. My boyfriend thought it was wonderful served warm with vanilla icecream - he thought that was the perfect combination. Enjoy!!!

I've made this twice exactly as the recipe states. It's easy and delicious. Received rave reviews from everyone. As long as I have six cups of berries, I don't care how many of each. I probably had more blackberries and fewer of the blueberries and raspberries. If I could give it five forks I would. It's perfection.

Oh, and I have found that using my fingers to "cut in" the butter is the easiest and most effective way to do it.

Incredible! The first time I doubled the recipe for a crowd, and everyone went nuts for it. Needless to say, vanilla ice cream with it is spectacular. I've made it several times since then with both fresh and frozen fruit. I took others' suggestion and halved the sugar in the topping. The last two times I made it I also used only 3/4 of a stick of butter, and it seemed to make no difference. This crisp may be the best dessert I have ever made!

An additional note -- I think the response to the sweetness of the topping probably depends upon the sweetness of the berries. My berries were somewhat tart so the topping was a definite compliment.

Fabulous! I used 1 pint each of blackberries and raspberries and a smaller container of blueberries which, totally, equalled six cups. I followed everything else exactly. The result was outstanding. Though I served it with vanilla ice cream, the vote was that this crisp could easily stand alone. The crisp topping was quite different than other crisps I've made -- a bit more trouble (the cutting in) -- but worth every extra second. When I put the crisp topping on the pie (a deep dish which did not spill over), I was sure it was too much topping. It was not. The result was perfect -- a father's day gift for a very special 90 year old man who said, "you mean I get to eat this all by myself?" His wife said, "no," so we all got to enjoy it. It was delicious. I will certainly make it again.

It was pretty nice, but without a doubt, halve the sugar for the topping. It was way too sweet and almost ruined it for me. Otherwise it was delish.

So easy and so tasty ... could easily cut back a little on the sugar if you prefer it less sweet.

I halved this recipe and cooked it in individual ramekins, using frozen fruit. Although I have a wicked sweet tooth, I actually felt like the topping was a little too sweet - I really needed my vanilla ice cream to cut it. I think if I make this again, I'm going to cut down on the white sugar in the topping in hopes of avoiding the almost granular texture of the topping. It was super easy and used rolled oats in the topping (I hate when crisps don't!) so I'll probably use this as a foundation for my next crisp attempt.

yum! added strawberries. also tried the walnuts in the topping, turned out wonderfully!

Delicious! Used blueberries and raspberries (no blackberries at the market). Love the flexibility to use whatever berries are available. Used half the sugar in the topping, which was the best part. I tried it with cream, whipped cream, ice cream and plain. I liked it best with vanilla ice cream.

I made this several weeks ago for my boyfriend. I always find myself making desserts for others for the pure joy of baking as this uses alot of sugar and I typically never partake except for just a test bite...all I can say is with the mix of raspberries, blackberries and strawberries that I used, my test bite turned into a full serving. Smelled wonderful and was beautifully rustic but tasted even better. My boyfriend ate with a side of vanilla raspberry frozen yogurt and gave this two thumbs up. Of course, I am sure there are healthy substitutions that could be made such as agave nectar or just simply to lessen the sugar but I've got to say in the case of this recipe, not one of those little sugar granules tasted out of place. :-)

This recipe was fantastic! I used 6 cups of fresh blueberries and added a splash of lemon juice to the mix. It only took 45 minutes to bake, and the topping was buttery and light. My husband went for seconds and raved about it all night. Definitely a keeper.

This is my go to fruit crisp recipe. I have made it over and over again with many combinations of fruit - apple & blackberry, peach & blueberry, pear and raspberry - whatever is in season. I always get RAVES and request for the recipe. My only changes are fresh lemon juice in the fruit and I use the cinnamon in the topping. I also make it deep dish in a 9 inch casserole.

This recipe is delicious, easy and works every time. I prefer it best with fresh berries, but have used frozen berries and it's still a great dessert. I would not change a thing. It's a crowd pleaser everytime!

Easy and so delicious! Halved the recipe but made full amount of topping. Froze the rest of the topping for another night. Also used frozen berries that were individually frozen and rinsed just before using. Have made this with peaches too. All are wonderful!

This was an easy and forgiving recipe and the results were great. You don't even need to exactly measure the ingredients. I made only with blueberries and raspberries. Will definitely make again with different fruit combinations.

This is very good IF you use less sugar in the topping. The first time that I made it per the recipe, it was way too sweet. I made it a second time, but I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar in the topping and did not change the sugar that is mixed with the fruit. It is good with any berries; in fact, I have not yet used the exact combo of fruits in the recipe. I made it for the 4th of July with blueberries - 4 cups - and 2 cups of blackberries (what I had in the refrigerator), and it was wonderful! All blueberries also very good!
