Not as good as I wanted them to be. You could hardly taste the apricots.

I made these according to recipe except added one teaspoon of vanilla. These are really wonderful! They sure didn't stick around long. ;- )

H E L P !!!!!!! I make these cookies and they are as flat as pancakes. I followed the directions carefully and even put the dough in the 'fridge to see if that would help, but it didnt. Anyone have any ideas?

This is a terrific recipe, which I've made as is, as well as with milk chocolate bits, walnuts, and dried apricots. One tip that may be helpful: You can revitalize really dried out apricots by soaking them in boiling water for 20-30 minutes (pour enough boiling water over them to cover and let sit). Then strain and pat dry the apricots -- they are reconstituted enough for the recipe.

I made these cookies for a cookie exchange. The day that I baked them, they were dry and hard. After they cooled, I packed them in cookie tins. The tins helped them become more moist and they stayed fresh for almost a week. The mix of textures worked well. I will try again next year and add walnuts.

This is my favorite cookie recipe. I cheat and buy pre-chunked chocolate. I agree with increasing the ratio of brown to white sugar and adding 1 tsp vanilla extract, but recipe is also great as is.

This is a favorite in our house and actually in our neighborhood. I have to share them right away or risk eating them all! I do use the apricots, and I was skeptical at first about that ingredient, but we all like the recipe as is. I'll admit that I also like eating the batter! This is a great grown-up cookie, although my 4-year old and neighbors' kids like them too.

I haven't made cookies in years, but lost a super bowl homemade cookie pool at work. The winner had an overflowing box of mostly chocolate chip & oatmeal cookies. I knew that would happen so made these. The cook from Milwaukee convinced me with the Trader Joe comment. I made them with all dark brown unpacked sugar & toasted sliced almonds as substitutes. This is my kind of cookie. Not too sweet and loaded with different textures & flavors. I will be making these again and won't wait so long.

Ok, I did make some changes, let me admit that straight away- I omitted the apricots, used toasted, slivered almonds, and added a dash of vanilla and another dash, of amaretto. I also melted the chocolate before adding it. I don't know if it was because of my alterations (although I doubt it, as others have reported the same consistency), but my cookies were extremely hard and dry- biscotti-like, in fact. However, they were quite tasty if mentally approached as biscotti, and I will make them again, in that guise.

I LOVE these cookies, but the kids don't, so they're for adults. I'll leave a batch in the teacher's lounge, and they go so fast! I call them Trader Joe's cookies, because all the fun ingredients can be bought there. I get so excited when I can make them, knowing I'll be eating them soon.

brilliant! make sure to add a teaspoon or two of vanilla--it makes a huge difference. i use all brown sugar and extra tart cherries in place of the apricots. as close to a no-fail recipe as they come.

Very disappointing. I used excellent chocolate and still found the cookies dry and not sweet enough. I won't make these again.

Best chocolate chip cookies ever! I only add the chocolate chunks as my husband is very fussy, but these cookies always turn out soft and yummy!

Excellent! I made the recipe as written and added a teaspoon of vanilla.

As delicious as promised. The only substitution I made was to use a mix of dried cranberries & blueberries instead of the cherries, and that seemed to work just fine. I'd definitely make these again.

Became my husband's favorite cookie instantly.

I used Craisins (dried cranberries) instead of the apricots and cheeries. My friends were disappointed when I told them I baked the cookies rather than my wife making her famous recipe. But they said that these gave hers a run for the money.

I loved these, and so did my husband. Made as written.

I too toasted the pecans and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla. I omitted the cherries because I didn't have any, but I think they would be a tasty addition. The cookie is crisp on the edges and softer, cakelike in the middle. Rich,a grownup variation of the chocolate chip cookie. I think chips would be just fine and would use them the next time instead of chopping the chocolate.

I thought these had a bit too much "stuff" the first time I made them, so second time I split the recipe in half and added chopped apricots/white chocolate chips/pecans to one half and cherries/dark chocolate chips/walnuts to the other. Each was delicious!

This was a great cookie recipe, but I wasn't crazy about all of the dried fruit. I tbink I would make these again, but only with the nuts and chocolate!

Rave reviews on these cookies after a couple minor adjustments. I recommend toasting pecans in oven with butter and salt first. Also, to save time, I purchase semi-sweet chocolate chunks. I love the fruit, chocolate, salted nut combination. Husband prefers them without the apricot.

I get raves everytime I make this recipe. I have made it at least a half a dozen times. I toast the pecans and don't add apricots. Whip the butter/sugar and eggs well. I also add vanilla. Delicious and delectable.

I was skeptical at first but have made them a number of times now. Very, very good. Wait to taste them until they have cooled!
