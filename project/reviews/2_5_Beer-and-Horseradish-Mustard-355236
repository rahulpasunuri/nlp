When just made has a very malty taste but then it mellows and is delicious

We found the mustard bitter and not at all to our liking.

I made the sauce for family and guests and all raved about it. It compliments the bratwurst bites perfectly.

I just finished the sauce. I was amazed that it wasn't simpler. What's worse, it's terrible. Very little flavor, except for an overwhelming bitterness. I will taste again after it cools, then see what I can add to salvage and hopefully avoid having to start over with a different recipe. I posted this in the appetizer reviews, when really it should have been here. I will be making the bratwurst bites soon.
