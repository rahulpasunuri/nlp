Very good! Doubled it (used 1/2 cup cream in the enhanced recipe) and had plenty left over. Used it for Pumpkin Bread Pudding. Wow! I thought it looked a little clearish-yellow, like butter, but it was delicious. So easy - will definitely make it again.

Great sauce! Used brown sugar and poured it over bread pudding I made with leftover cinamon rolls. Would be great just over ice cream as well.

Yum! Added a bit more cream and bourbon.

I think it sounds great, I am making it tonight, but 1/2 cup of sauce does not go very far for 6 people!!Iam using my sticky toffee sauce..

I just made this using brown sugar instead of white, and it is amazing! I also doubled the recipe, and added an extra 3 Tbs. of heavy cream, which seemed to give it a bit more heft. Yum!!!

I made one recipe of the sauce for half of Bread Pudding. Used Irish Whiskey instead. Now, what I think made this sauce delicious was adding "orange rind" to the sauce (3 or 4 big shaves). It made a Big difference!!!. Let it cook for a bit, and sit with it until serving. 2 Tbs. of Whisky were to short, so I poured more ;) Yum!!! My hubby almost licked the plate... Another option that I'll try next time is, to make a caramel with the sugar first, then all the rest. We've had in restaurants some yummy brown whiskey sauce. Maybe that's the way to make it ;) if someone tries it, please let me know the out come.

Super yummy sauce! I doubled it too and had plenty that way. Breda pudding was great by itself, but even more amazing with the bourbon sauce! Used "Rebel Yell" bourbon.

I have made this a number of times. I use a cinm. bread from the bakery, I also added 1 teaspoon, each of nutmeg, allspice and cinamion (SP) I used all cream and no reg. milk and instead of 1/4 sugar I used 1/2 cup. For the sauce I Used Myers dark rum and it was the best.

I love this sauce, I like to use scotch instead of bourbon.

I made this sauce to accompany the apple raisin bread pudding from this site, and the flavor was fantastic. It's so simple to make and requires very little time. The sauce is a little thin and colorless, so if I were going for presentation, I would drizzle it over whatever I served it with.

I've made this bread pudding and sauce at least 5 times now, and everyone loves it. I always make it the day before I plan to serve it... saves so much time when you're putting a meal together. The sauce is delicious! I add 1/4 C of the bourbon (or whatever liquor I am using... rum and whisky have been good). It it tastes too bland, try another pinch of salt. I find it to be very smooth, buttery-sweet, and the alcohol gives the pudding just the kick it needs. Don't skip the sauce!

This sauce is easy to prepare, delicious, & a perfect complement to the bread pudding. It IS sweet & buttery but you don't need a lot of it. We went RIGHT over the top & had a little Haagen Daaz vanilla ice-cream alongside & it cut the richness of the warm sauce & pudding. A totally scrumptious dessert which tastes best after a light, fresh-tasting dinner.

AWFUL! Didn't have any body and tasted too much of butter.

I thought this sauce was perfect with my bread pudding. Delicious served warm, or, if desired, cool longer for a thicker sauce.

The sauce needs more body. I felt it was much to light for bread pudding.
