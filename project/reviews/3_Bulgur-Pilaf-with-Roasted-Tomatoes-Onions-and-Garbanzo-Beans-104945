This was pretty good, it did need some tweaking. I did the following...Quinoa, which I cooked seperatly, instead of Bulger, added a little olive oil and dijon mustard at the end, and some diced roasted green chiles for a little kick.

i read the reviews before making this dish, so made a number of modifications to the recipe. i still think it needs some help, though! i'd suggest using smaller, sweeter tomatoes (mini romas or grape tomatoes) and adjusting cooking time accordingly. shallots instead of onions is another good option, as they caramelize nicely. i doubled the garlic, crushing half and leaving half in the skins to mix in after roasting, and this turned out to be a good move, as the garlic taste wasn't very strong at all. i didn't have fresh herbs, so added dried parsley, thyme, and dill to the saucepan. i added some chicken-soup base to the water, and also used more water than called for. overall, not a good recipe, but a good starting point.

I used couscous (1 cup) instead of bulgur and had great results. I also omitted the dill and parsley. Roasting the tomatoes and onions for an hour and the chickpeas and garlic for a half hour was perfect. Then I just transferred the ingredients from the pan to a pot, added two cups water and one cup couscous, and brought to a boil. When the water was almost evaporated, I squeezed half of a fresh lemon over it and served hot. My husband loved it too. Next time we might try it with bulgur or pasta.

I liked it, it was good warm or as a salad but needs something to spice it up and add more liquid. I don't think roasting the tomatoes did anything for this dish and there is no mention of removing the skins. Next time I will use canned tomatoes.

This was really tasty! I thought the dill and parsley added a lot. I used a little more lemon juice than suggested. Very homey dish, would go well with a leafy green side dish.

Pretty good, altho I needed to let the bulgur absorb water for more than 10 min -- and should have waited even longer than I did. Next time I'll add more garbanzo beans.

The roasted tomatoes had a great flavor, and we will use them on pasta (as another reviewer suggested), but the bulgur dish just wasn't good. We added a lot of lemon juice, just to give it some kick, but it didn't help. And I love bulgur!

I am a dedicated meat-eater, but was willing to try this. The roasted onions and tomatoes really make this dish. However, not caring for dill, and tasting along the way, I noticed that it needed a little punch, so I added the zest of one orange, some basil, and toasted almonds. Wow. Whenever I'm out of charcoal, this will be Plan B.

Very tasty. However, the recipe did not specify what type of bulgur to use - fine, medium or coarse. I used medium, and had to use at least one more cup of water, and cook it for about 15 minutes more than what was given in the recipe. I used plum tomatoes and removed most of the skins after baking. I increased the amount of lemon juice for more tang. Tastes great hot, warm or at room temperature. By the way, the baked tomato, onion, chickpea and garlic mixture also makes a great pasta sauce! (don't add the water, just add an extra tbsp of olive oil).
