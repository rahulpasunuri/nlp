Love it. This dish has become a holiday tradition. Apricot jam is my favorite accompaniment, but Matey prefers strawberry jam. I cook it in a convection oven at 300°F for 35 to 45 minutes.

Instead of double acting baking powder, they should have used 1/2 envelope of YEAST!! Anyhow,--this recipe is not easy to make, might as well make real "palacsinta"s (pancakes, and layer them.

The batter was very thin so the exercise of "layering" was useless. The end result was lumps of filling amidst custard. The dessert smells & tastes good but I thought it was too many ingredients & dirty bowls to repeat.
