This is an amazingly flavorful dessert. Yes, it takes a bit of work, but aren't your guests worth it? I would suggest that instead of treating the dried chiles as directed, that you follow David Lebovitz' Mole Sauce recipe. It is a much simpler and less painful way of handling them. I just boil some water in a heavy, lidded sauce pan, turn off the flame, put in the dried chiles and cover. This worked great. It is so much easier to stem and seed the chiles once they are softened and it doesn't leave your hands stinging. I used organic dried chiles from the local health food store, which, unlike the ones from the Mexican market, looked like they had once been alive. They had plenty of heat and made quite a bit of paste. I made the tomatillo sauce and the chile paste the day before I baked, which made baking day a breeze.

I can't tell you how amazing this was...you're going to have to try it out for yourself to believe it. If you're in a time crunch, you can make the raw batter 36 hours before buttering up the ramekins and baking. Used the Giradelli chips, used the entire 6 chipotle chili paste mixture, added 1 tsp orange zest. Rich chocolately with a hint of warmth from the chipotle.

Super Yummy, but I added more of the chipotle paste than it called for, and still couldn't taste the peppers. Just tasted yummy and chocolaty. I would try it again, and add way more pepper paste. Maybe my peppers were not the best?

Fabulous. I've made this a few times, always to rave reviews. The sauces make this dessert a bit of a process, but they are worth the effort. I can usually get the chipotles at my local Mexican market, but struck out the most recent time I looked. I ended up using chipotles in adobo, which I rinsed in water several times then soaked for about half an hour. In the end the water ran clear, and the cakes tasted much like with the dried. I think you need to up the amount of chipotle when you do it this way. Enjoy!

This was an amazing dessert. I used a variety of chocolates because I only had 6oz of semi-sweet, the other 4oz was bittersweet. Served with the tomatillo sauce. The party debate was if this was the preferred dessert over the molten lava cake - tough choices ;^)

I doubled this recipe for a new year's eve party, using canned chipotles (in adobo sauce - squeezed out seeds and juice & wiped sauce off peppers then pureed them in the food processor). I kept adding more chipotle paste until I could taste it in the batter... ended up using 6T!! I baked 2 10'' cakes - with parchment, greased & dusted pans with cocoa powder. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND USING PARCHMENT! Baked til toothpick came clean - one in bain marie, one as a regular cake. Both were great - the free bake being a little more chewy. Assembled the two layers between 2 chocolate chip cake layers I had on hand, frosting whole thing with chocolate ganache. Deemed the best cake of the decade!!!

Fantastic dessert...though with 4 tsp flour, it is more like an ultra rich firm pudding than a cake. I too had difficulty finding chipotle peppers...the first ones I found were tan (that's just WRONG) -- if you go to all the trouble to make the paste, it is important to have fresh ingredients. Found them at worldspice.com - local for me, but they sell online. Can't imagine using chipotle in adobo, with the vinegar and onion. I added a splash of grand marnier to kick up the orange, and did not de-seed the peppers, which kicked up the spice. RAVE reviews. Used 7 oz ramekins...the dessert is so rich, it was really too much per serving. Tomatillo sauce was excellent, the vanilla creme would have been a good balancer. Reheated two leftover cakes in the ramekins in a water-bath oven...worked well. Good warm.

Mmmm, mmm! Tasty, but could do with a little more kick. I used 1 tbsp. chipotle paste, but the effect was a little muted (would use 2 tbsp. next time). Interestingly, the chipotle was more intense on the day that I made it, but the chocolate flavour was more intense on the second day. A note on using muffin tins: didn't work for me. Stuck on like glue (even though I buttered and sugared the tins). I got the cake out the tins in a big, crumbly mess, but served it individually and called it Chocolate Chipotle Eruption, and people were amazed! Tomatillo sauce is a fascinating complement... worth doing.

Absolutely amazing! Had to leave the ramekins a tad longer than mentioned, but only about 10 minutes. If not, without a doubt the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted.

Rating: 4
Yum! This was so much easier to make than I expected and it was definitely worth it! Couldn't find chipotle chilis so we used jalapenos instead which worked. I also had trouble getting them out of the ramekins so I served them as is- everyone loved them anyway!

Great recipe, I really enjoyed it. The Tomatillo sauce is great as well.

This is the ultimate dessert. Hot, sweet, smoky, chocolatey...my only complaint is that I couldn't eat it all, because it released an overdose of endorphins, and I couldn't see straight. I'm also saddened that at the young age of 32, I've made the best dessert of my life. I don't think anything can top this.

Love this recipe. I do use the canned chipoltes and I think it works great. Also, when I made the tomatillo sauce, I was chatting on the phone and accidentally added white sugar instead of the sugar I should have used. It still turned out great--not that different from the time I made it with the proper sugar.

Rating: 4
Have made these several times. This is one of my absolute favorite recipes from this site. Did reduce the chipotle as it was a bit overpowering the first time. Once I sort of accidentally made this with a Hershey chocolate bar, it's true... and it turned out just fine that time as well.

This gets a 4 for taste but I brought it down to a 3 for presentation. Mine did not come out of the ramekins nicely. I also cooked them more like 90 minutes and they were still wet in consistency. I must have done something wrong but I'm not sure what!? Again, they tasted great and the chipoltle cake and the tomatillo sauce were a conversation topic as well.

Rating: 4
this is a killer recipe-- always a hit, always spectacular. i think you have to use chipotle chilis to get the true flavor; cayenne is a different taste. i have made the chipotle paste as indicated in the recipe and using chipotles in adobo. the paste using chilis in adobo is good, and much easier; the paste using dried chipotle is cleaner-tasting.

This was seriously amazing. Baking them in rammekins/muffin tins makes a difference because the middle of the cakes can be slightly fudgy and molten, which is very messy to do if you make a big cake and then cut it. I did use chiles in abodo instead of actual chipotles -- they're just too hard to find, plus that whole chile paste making shebang looks like a pain in the butt. Cut off the top of the chiles, dump them in the blender with some of the sauce, viola! End to crappy long labor-intensive recipe step. The tomatillo sauce was also great. I'll admit it, part of the fun of this recipe is just saying the name, but I get requests for it again and again. Making it tonight! I liked the tequila idea...

Rating: 4
Making the chile paste was quite a chore and in the end, I only got 1T of paste from the chiles, let alone extra for the freezer! I didn't have time to make more so essentially didn't have any smoky flavor in the cake at all. No worries though...my guests all raved about the cake anyway. I made both the custard and tomatillo sauce (using dark brown sugar instead of piloncillo), which were great. I'll definitely try the cake again and experiment with more chipotles or try making the paste with chipotle powder as some have recommended. I'll also do it again without chiles and just vanilla ice cream for the kids. I may even make the tomatillo sauce as an interesting topping to ice cream or cheesecake. I loved the sweet-tart flavor!

This recipe is so good it's not funny. Not as hard to make as I thought it would be, and definitely wowed my dinner party crowd. Served with the tomatillo sauce and vanilla ice cream. Superb.

This recipe requires alot of work!!! It tasted better 24-48 hours after it was made. In general I wouldn't make it again due to cost and time.

I made this treat in a 12 pc muffin pan and the serving size was perfect. I used 3 oz of Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate and 7oz of the 56% Valrhona chocolate and it was fabulous. Best chocolate dessert ever. Preety simple, though time consuming. I would make the sauces and chipotle paste the day before if I was making an entire meal. Took this to a Tex Mex BBQ and it got rave reviews!

I was a bit dissapointed in the lack of chipotle, I had expected a bit more kick. The "cake" itself was superb, although I thought it tasted much better the next day (leftovers).

Rating: 4
What a treat! These are delicious! The chocolate and spice of the chipotles work spectacularly together! These do require time and careful work, but they are well worth every minute! Can't wait to try them again--with that extra chipotle paste I froze. To be sure the cakes stayed spicy, I removed the seeds from only half of the chipotles when making the chipotle paste. I didn't have ramekins so used a large non-stick muffin pan; I greased and sugared the muffin cups; recipe made 12 muffin-sized cakes. Although I thought they would not need to cook as long, they needed the full time specified in the recipe. Also made both of the sauces; they are great! In the tomatillo sauce, following the suggestion of another reviewer, I used 1/2 cup brown sugar (and no white sugar); I think 1/2 cup was too much and will try less next time.

Rating: 4
An excellent combination of unexpected flavors! I made the chipotle flavoring like a couple of other reviewers (1-1/2 tsp. chipotle chile pepper and 3 tbsp. water) and used Ghirardelli Bittersweet and ready-made orange juice. The chipotle gives each bite a nice, slow spiciness at the back of the palate. The sweet-tart tomatillo sauce is perfect with the cake - I found that the piloncillo provided enough sweetness and omitted the 2 tbsp. of regular sugar.

Rating: 4
I love this dessert! It's not difficult to make (not even the chile paste part, in my opinion), but it does take a while to make the cake and the sauces. The sauces taste great with it though, don't skip them. Don't worry, it's not spicy.

Rating: 4
Out of this world!!!! Like one of the other reviewers, I made the chipotle paste using chipotle powder (1 1/2 tsp chipotle powder, 3 tbsp water) and it worked very well, as well as cut out a significant amount of the preparation time. We made it in a 9 inch ceramic pan and served the cake warm with the tomatillo sauce and a scoop of high quality vanilla ice cream on the side. Our guests went nuts! Definitely a keeper.

Rating: 3
Note to all: USE RAMEKINS! In my experience, at least, a 9" baking pan was a nightmare. The cake didn't cook through, and was more brownie-like in texture. My fault. The taste is complex and powerful and sumptuous, so I'll make this again - the right way.

Made 1/4 of a recipe for 2 servings, and it worked great. Just a bit of spiciness, and it was wonderful with the tomatillo sauce. Used store-bought o.j.

Fantastic. I didn't have ramekins & made this in a 9" cake pan -- baked a little longer at a slightly lower temperature to compensate. I used chipotle powder & reconstituted it in about a tablespoon of tequila. Served with the sweet tomatillo sauce (excellent!) and a dab of sour cream. The dinner guests scuffled over the last piece.

This cake is a truely amazing chocolate experience! I read the reviews and suggestions below before I tried it, and based on those skipped the chile-processing entirely. I used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper mixed with 1 tsp hot water, and let that sit for a minute while I prepared the rest of the cake, adding it in at the end. I also made it in a 8" springform lined with parchment and just chucked it right in the fridge to cool five minutes after it came out of the oven. When it cooled, I unmolded it and glazed it with a ganache that included cointreau and gelatin, so it was really glossy. I served it with some barely sweetened half-whipped cream flavored again with a splash of cointreau. This cake received worshipful reviews from some of my harshest critics who are usually extremely stingy with words like "fabulous, amazing and the best ever". I found some sources of chipolte paste online @ gourmetsleuth.com, I'm going to buy some of it to try this again. It's a winner!

This recipe is out of this world!! It's literally like a smokey, spicy, chocolate silk. Moderately time intensive but worth the wait. I would like a little more oomf in the spice factor, so will add some cayenne next time.

The texture of this cake is perfect. It is the best recipe I have tried for the standard low-flour, rich chocolate cake that you get in many ny restaurants, and I've tried many such recipes. However, making the chipotle paste was insanely labor-intensive. Next time, I'm going to mix some good quality ground cayenne pepper with a little water instead. I bet the results would be very similar.

Rating: 4
Good beyond all reason, and not as complicated as it looks. In fact, aside from the chipotle paste It was practically a one-bowl cake. I doubled this recipe and made the cakes in two 6" rounds and one 8" round. It was equally good hot with vanilla ice cream and refrigerated and glazed with ganache. AMAZING!

Rating: 4
This recipe is definitely a repeat! I was able to find all ingredients and followed the recipe as printed. The flavors were amazing and complex. The tartness of the tomatillo sauce was a wonderful contrast to the rich creaminess of the cake and custard. I would not omit either sauce--it all works so well together. I tested the cake at varying intervals out of the oven and liked them refrigerated best of all. I made both sauces the day before to reduce work time when I baked the cakes.

Labor intensive only in the chipotle processing area. I was waiting for a big chipotle kick but it only intensified the chocolate flavor. I did not find the proper sugar. I used raw brown sugar instead. I don't know if this was a huge difference. The tomatillo sauce was fruity. I think I would have preferred the vanilla.

Rating: 4
Excellent! In fact, I have made this 3 times in a week. My co-workers loved it and requested I bring it again and again. The tomatillo sauce is very sweet and most preferred the creme anglais. T thought it was a chore to prepare the chili paste and would seriously consider trying the adobo sauce next time. Don't think it would be much different.

Rating: 4
This recipe was truly fantastic and got rave reviews from our guests. Great contrasting flavors and textures. I had to substitute 1/2 cup brown sugar for the piloncillo in the tomatillo sauce. I also put the tomatillo sauce + 1 envelope gelatin in a whip creamer to make the sauce into a foam. Dried chipotle's are sometimes hard to find even in San Diego. Excellent with some Port...

Rating: 3
The cakes were excellent, though I didn't make the sauce. I served them warm with homemade vanilla ice cream that I had on hand. Will definitely make again. As far as someone's question about substituting chipotles in adobo sauce, I wouldn't. I think the adobo would add too much heat and alter the flavor. Then again, if you try it and like it, please let us know!

To the previous reviewer; there's a difference in flavor between the dried and the canned. For a dessert, I'd stick with the dried, but it's always worth a try! Let us know how it turns out.

just wondering...could this be done with canned chipotles in adobo sauce as well? Or would it get too spicy?
