Wonderful healthy dish! My first time making or eating quinoa. I made it to the recipe, except forgot to buy cilantro, which I think would have been awesome. I also did not salt the quinoa as suggested by another reviewer. The ginger stood out the most to me, and all the flavors blended nicely. My husband, who is meat-and-potatoes all the way and hard to get to like lighter dishes and veggies - loved it and would eat again. He added soy sauce to his, which I didn't think was necessary. My 15 month old loved it as well.

I made this for lunch yesterday for some friends. They could not stop raving about it while eating it. The only thing I did differently is used 1/2 water 1/2 chicken stock.

I'm glad that 2 forks is for "good". This is a nice, tasty meal and fairly easy to make on a week night. The flavors are mild so don't expect anything too complex. Husband and I quite enjoyed it and will make it again for sure!

Just love this recipe! I even tossed in a few extra veggies (just make sure you have a little extra oil in the pan). Fast, fresh, healthy and colorful!

I substituted tofu for the chicken to make it even healthier. This recipe is rock solid! Will make again.

This was delicious! I was amazed at how flavourful it was with only 1 Tbsp of soy sauce!

delicious recipe, the only thing is that Quinoa is not supposed to be cooked with salt, it is like rice in the way that it is supposed to "pop" and salt won´t let this process happen to quinoa. Cook it with water only and then add all the flavors.....try it , see the difference..:)

Home run, plain and simple. This is a healthy, tasty, enjoyable combination of ingredients. I substituted petite frozen peas(2c) for the snow peas, left out the shallot, used an orange bell pepper(red would have added good contrast color), 16 ounces of chicken, 3 sliced cloves of garlic, 2 tbsp soy sauce, and 1 extra egg white..everyone loved this. It's also excellent cold! Don't leave out the cilantro.

This recipe lacked spark. Nothing special. Perhaps some lemon and a lot more cilantro would have helped.

Flavorous! Perfect for week nights!

We made this with asparagus instead of the snow peas and mock chicken instead of the real thing. We also did with out the chile and omitted the egg because of our kids' tastes. I think the egg would have made it even better, as would the heat. But even so it was pretty good! A nice alternative to the rice stir fry.

i added tofu instead of chicken, just barely seared it in a pan with a little olive oil before adding it, and rather than adding soy sauce i added a few tablespoons of my favorite stir fry sauce. i didnt add chile. instead of snow peas, i added broccoli. no cilantro. it was DELICIOUS and a nice hearty and healthy dinner.

I was also a quinoa virgin and am now a convert. I didn't use chili (kids), but still really liked it. I think I'll cut back on cilantro next time, maybe without the chili to balance the amount was too much.

As indicated in these other reviews, this recipe is quite the surprise in how good it is. The fact that it's super tasty, but healthy too is awesome. I used the chili option, and it added a bit of kick to it, but didn't make it too hot. This is also my first time using Quinoa and definitely won't be the last. The recipe will definitely be saved in my favourites! Thanks for sharing.

The recipe is surprisingly good. Simple, satisfying, and easy to make. I made it mostly as described, but added a smidgeon more soy sauce at end and used tofu instead of chicken. Picky meat-loving hubby loved it. Only thing is that the grated ginger burnt so next time I might use more oil or chop the ginger instead of grating it.

I found this recipe because I was looking to use up some sprouted quinoa, and it worked well with this recipe. I simply stirred in the quinoa last, after taking the rest off the heat and letting cool for a couple of minutes. It looked like such a simple recipe at first, nothing remarkable about it, but I figured the reviewers all loved it, so I gave it a go. It will become a regular in our house.

Great dish, easy to make, easy to substitute tofu for chicken. Made it with red quinoa and the colors really popped. Surprisingly deep flavored dish, (I may have topped off with a little more soy sauce) and the cilantro really distinguishes it further. Served it to a non-vegetarian who loved it.

Made with sauteed tofu instead of chicken (made on the side) and had a peanut miso dressing on the side as well. Delicious!

Really delicious meal! I loved the way all the flavors and textures came together. To make the snow peas more tender, I boiled them alone for about 3 minutes. I didn't use the chile option. My husband wants me to try tofu instead of chicken next time. He disliked biting crisp carrot and chicken pieces together; he felt an odd sensation that the carrot was chicken gristle, however, I didn't experience that sensation. I will make this healthy, quick meal again and again.

This was pretty rockin'. I'd never had quinoa before, and when I made it for my parents they'd never heard of stir-fried quinoa, so we all had something new. Very simple, very fast, and very good.

easy to make. stuck to recipe, but cooked chicken separate to have a more flavorful contrast between the Quinoa-Veg stirfy. Healthy recipe that is gluten free!

I added a splash of fish sauce to the chicken (which I fried up in a bit of olive oil) and substituted snow peas with petite peas. It was delicious and so easy to put together!

This was very good, I like quinoa a lot. I never thought I could stir fry quinoa. I made a lot of substitutions: used green and red pepper, garlic, dried whole chillies and button mushrooms. I didn't have ginger and snow peas, and I omitted carrot. I served it with roasted chicken as side dish. I will definitely make it again, but next time I will follow recipe from A to Z.

This was my first occasion cooking with Quinoa so I followed this recipe almost to a T. It was delicious and with just a few tweaks, it could be easier to make and even more delicious. First, do not grate the ginger. I know this is easy (lazy) but if you do, when you saute it with the bell pepper, two things happen. Because a single TBSP of oil is all we're using, it pretty much dissappears by the time the ginger hits the pan.The consequence is that your easily wrought ginger sticks in great gouts to the bottom of your pan. Even adding some more oil, I had problems. I WILL make this again, it was yummy, but next time 2 TBSP's oil and finely chopped ginger will ease the way. Next, it's best to assemble all your ingredients before making this because the cooking is swift once you begin. That swiftness leads to something which isn't really a criticism, rather a preference. The scallions and snap peas are barely cooked and were wonderful. The next time I make this though, I'll add them in with the bell pepper, just to settle them a little closer to the tender-crisp line. Lastly I substituted freshly chopped parsley straight across for the Cilantro which I loathe. Couple tweaks to ease an almost perfect recipe.

My family and I enjoyed this dish . I added extra veggies and also added some garlic chili sauce to the stir fry mixture to give it a little more kick. Quina is easy to make in the rice cooker. Over all an easy to make, healthy and tasty week night dinner. It is a keeper.

Really great, healthy meal. I used tofu instead of chicken and instead of snow peas, I opted for broccoli. I also threw in some mushrooms as I had some leftover in the fridge -- this is great way of using up veggies. The one tweak I made was adding a lot more soy sauce; 1 tablespoon was definitely not enough. I probably ended up using something like 3-4 tablespoons (just kept tasting and adding). Will definitely be making again!

I loved it, my husband is a bit lukewarm towards quinoa, however. I used a bit of a very hot pepper (not sure what it was) and my lips are still burning. I added more garlic, and carrots and somehow forgot the soy. I used grilled turkey thigh meat...very tasty to have a bit of the charcoal flavor but think shrimp or chicken would be just as good. I felt the need to add a bit of salt, but the soy would have taken care of that. I am hopeful this will reheat OK as I think it will make a great light lunch.

I used Quorn Naked Cutlets and asparagus. So good.

A fast, low-calorie meal for after a hard workout and quinoa is a nice alternative to rice or noodles. I swapped in shrimp for chicken (cook the shrimp along with the veggies until opaque). I did find the sauce a little bland, though -- it could use some kick like cumin, rice vinegar, and more garlic. I would make it again with these modifications.

This recipe is both easy and tasty. I made it without any modifications, but you could easily switch up the vegetables if you wanted. It's a great weeknight meal!

A healthy and delcious departure from the routine of rice and noodles. The flavourings are not lost in this dish. Maybe not quite so many peas next time. I marinated the chicken for a bit in a ginger sauce, which worked out well. It's a keeper!

loved it. i changed it up a little: i halfed half a bag of baby carrots. no peas. added an orange bell pepper. used a little more cilantro, ginger, and garlic. browned firm tofu in olive oil, agave, and soy sauce. no egg or chicken. no chile, used a dash of dried red pepper. YUM! this was very fresh tasting and flavorful. next time i may add some oranges, it seems like the flavor would work.

This is a great dish. I took the advice of another user who used Edamamae and it was great. My store was out of red chile peper so I used Jalapeno - such a great kick! I also did not have any chicken but it was great!

This delicious,easy to prepare dish needed very little "tweeking". Very satisfying and healthy. I scaled back on the amount of snow pes, added prepared edamame, and used a rotisserie chicken from my local grocery store, for time saving convenience. Be adventuresome by using your favorite spices. I suggest; Chinese 5 Spice, Fox Point Seasoning, Sunny Paris, and Spicey 4-S Salt.....all from Penzey's Spice Store. This receipe is a keeper.

Yum yum yum. Not fancy, but very tasty, and healthy too. My market didn't have Thai red chiles so i used a small serrano instead. It was a bit spicy for me (i'm wimpy) so i sprinkled a bit of sugar on my serving, which was perfect.
