I followed the recipe with the exceptions of adding 4 extra garlic cloves and omitted the cream entirely as it did not seem necessary. I also did not use the thyme butter and do not believe it was missed. It was a hit with everyone. As stated in other reviews, it does make a considerable amount. The immersion blender brought it to a perfectly creamy consistency.

Why do you persist in listing recipes as healthy when they're chock-full of botter?

Bland, bland, bland and more bland. Thin and watery, too. This is even after adding an additional clove of garlic, more chicken stock powder, salt and pepper like you wouldn't believe. Lacks any character or depth. It's edible, and not terrible, but not worthy of making again.

Really good, the family loved it. I made a couple of changes -- I used the celery root & turnips, but used sweet potatoes (leftover from the Sweet Potato & Turnip Gratin from this site) instead of the parsnips, and added a leftover carrot. I'll try it again with parsnips. I didn't use the butter, but swirled a tablespoon of cream into each serving. The turnips & celery root are key to the flavour, I think. A winner!

This soup is a winner! I hope my friends won't get tired of eating it when they dine with me as I am tempted to make it at every dinner party. I used garlic with a heavy hand and tho I made the Thyme butter, I personally found it too rich. (Try this butter on vegetables). Floating some thyme on the surface is a nice touch. Thanks!

Delicious! I found the soup very parsnipy but I love parsnips. I wouldn't recommend this soup for a non-root vegetable lover since its quite earthy. I slimmed down the recipe a bit since the rest of the meal was quite heavy. I used 10% cream instead of whipping cream and sprinkled the finished product with fresh thyme instead of the thyme butter. I halved the whole recipe and still have lots left over. Definitely use more garlic.

great flavor, but makes a lot, especially since it really does need to be thinned with milk or cream. I have a freezer full of it now. Substituted savory for the thyme, very good, and really a necessary contrast to the whiteness of the soup. Make the butter, you won't be sorry, worth the effort.

very good soup. Dinner guests raved. I used more cream than called for and thinned with broth considerably. Thyme butter was delicious and made for an elegant presentation. Next time I think I'll add more garlic.

This soup was great! A nice change to have a creamy veggie soup without potatoes. The celeriac, parsnip & turnip are a delicious combo. For a lighter touch, I omitted the thyme butter, added some thyme during cooking instead and used half & half instead of cream.
