This recipe is BEGGING for flour. I found it bland and too cornmealy. The traditional tender insterior and sweetness and onion flavor is totslly lost in the gritty cornmeal. Will not make again.

So good it seems morally wrong. Crispy, light and addictive in a fair-food kind of way. The recipe is adaptable (I omitted the onion) and very simple. I used a specialty-type cornmeal (Bob's Red Mill, medium grind) and could taste a difference

As I write this, these little puppies are hot off my stove. The all cornmeal recipe (some others call for flour as well) gives them such a delicate outer crunch. Here in the mid-Atlantic, we're in the full swing of corn season so I added 2 ears of fresh corn (cooked)for extra texture. They turned out very nicely and will be a big hit at this afternoon's crab feast. I think that also work nicely in the fall (football!) with a dipping sauce as snackers.

It might help to give the amount of buttermilk required!!!!
