Fantastic! The trick was using high-quality chocolate, and fully incorporating the egg and chocolate. It looked beautiful and tasted like a giant truffle. It melted in our mouths.

I must agree completely with the previous reviewer. Hard to understand how this is named "moist". Far from it. Similarly, I found it bland. A little sweetness might help. But I have had many chocolate cakes that were not sweet but somehow had much more flavor. I will not make this again.

Definitely easy, but wasn't overly impressed with the result. I found it a bit dry and it didn't keep very long. I also thought the flavor a bit bland. Might try it again and doctor things up a bit, but will probably try some other recipes first.

Extraordinarily easy, and very very good. I'll try it again with even better quality chocolate. Very very rich - this is for chocoholics only.

Great recipe, super easy to make and it's delicious. It's super rich. I made it with dark chocolate and it was great but I might add a raspberry sauce drizzle on it next time.

I love this recipe... it's quite easy to make and it's delicious. I actually made them into little cupcakes and added half a teaspoon of vanilla(the cooking chocolate I had wasn't that great and needed a kick)but it turned out perfect... it's the perfect thing for St. Valentine's day.

Excellent cake. Made it with a milk chocolate bar from Trader Joe's for a birthday. Thought about sifting powdered sugar on top, but thought the birthday girl would like to keep her eyebrows.

Wow! Incredibly easy and a wonderful result. It is best served warm as the center becomes slightly molten in quality. As previously suggested, make sure the eggs are whisked to a good volume for the best result.

An exceptionally well done flourless chocolate cake. I couldn't wait untill it was finished cooling to have a bite. The cake is very simple and yet very decadent, I am suprised at how quickly it was done. I can see how it could be the basis of so many differing variations. Rember to beat the eggs quite well, I have had other recipies which did not turn out so well because I did not beat the eggs or egg whites untill quite volumized.

I've made this cake several times using a variety of chocolates. Always good. Try this...bottom layer of dark, top layer of milk chocolate, drizzled with a warm caramel. Fabulous!

I almost didn't make this cake based on a few of the reviews, but I'm glad I did. This is a delicious, easy, flourless chocolate cake recipie. My guests loved it with fresh whipped cream. Yummie!

I've made this several times. Nice go-to dessert as I always have the ingredients on hand. It took a little longer to bake in my oven - 30 min. Garnished with whipped cream, raspberry coulis and fresh raspberries. YUM!

I used a mix of semi-sweet and bittersweet chocolate - pure chocolate heaven - of course not for those who prefer white or milk chocolate. The cake did not rise much, but was very moist.

Very disappointed with the result. Wasted the ingredients. Will not make this again!

This recipe was wonderful - it's my husband's favorite. I serve it with raspberry sauce or fresh berries and he always asks for more!!!!

I love dark chocolate and so was pre-disposed to like this cake. But my husband does not, and yet he asked for seconds, which should tell you this cake is FABULOUS. For flourless chocolate cake, this cake turned out to be very light in texture, with wonderful flavor. Instead of a ganache, I frosted it with a vanilla buttercream which, believe it or not was great with it. Made it for Christmas, making it again for an intimate NY eve dinner.
