This works well with Quinoa cooked in broth as well. Delicious accompaniment to Moroccan Spiced Grilled Chicken recipe.

Brilliant, easy and recipe ! Amended it by using instant Brown Basmati Rice (I was pushed for time) and included a reasonable quantity of lemon zest. Was very pleased with the results ... as were my hungry guests.

Wow. This was delicious. Absolutely delicious. Made it for first time for family BBQ yesterday and it was a hit. Followed recipe as is except used white basmati for half of the rice.

Excellent flavors! Made this as a side for grilled chicken and shrimp kebabs w/mixed vegetables for party (40 people). Made couple changes - used toasted pine nuts instead of cashews and used equal parts white and brown rice (I doubled receipe, so cooked the two rices separately). Easy to assemble a couple of hours ahead and didn't take up valuable refrigerator space. Got many compliments with requests for receipe. I also served plain rice just in case this was too exotic for some....and it went untouched! Definitely a keeper.

This has become my go-to recipe for guests in the spring/summer. Easy. Delicious. Never fails to get rave comments. And, you can make it the day before and serve it room temperature. Wish I could find more that meet those requirements.

Made this with golden raisins instead of figs, and substituted red onions for green - the red onions were the only thing wrong with this delicious salad. Too strong. Next time, I'll stick with the green. Didn't have cilantro, so substituted flat leaf parsley and mint leaves, and added coriander to the dressing, per a previous cook. My husband, who is reasonably fussy, loved it! I'm excited to take it to our next potluck - I expect it to be a hit there, too!

WONDERFUL!!! Used jasmine rice and medjool dates, everything else as written. Perfect for a hot summer day/night. I could eat, and eat, and eat. everyone raved.

Wonderful combination of flavors, even though we used some variations - chicken broth, walnuts, and parsley to substitute. We also toasted and ground some coriander seed and threw it in with the broth to cook the rice - we wanted the flavor of the cilantro but didn't have the herb! Great side dish or lunch.

Super easy and turned out great! I substituted golden raisins for dates and used chicken broth instead of veggie broth for the rice. And I served it warm. This will definitely become a regular side dish in my household. And totally gluten free!

My old medjool dates had turned quite hard so I chopped them up and sauteed them first with half a small bulb of fennel root that I had in the fridge. I also used pine nuts. It was amazingly good.

This rice is absolutely unreal it's so good. I used pine nuts like another reviewer suggested - I'm not a big cashew fan. It's so good, I can't stop eating it! I'm at altitude, and the rice took more like 50 minutes to cook and I added an extra 1/4 cup of broth with that in mind.

I made this dish and everyone was obsessed! It was delicous. I did substitute in toasted pinenuts and medjool dates. I would even add some roasted broccoli in their next time!

wonderful flavors. did not find it too lemony. halved the recipe for 3 people and had leftovers. Thought the ratio of rice to cashews/dates heavily favored the cashews/dates. Next time (which will be soon), will increase the amount of rice or decrease the amount of cashews/dates. Served with Grilled Chicken Moroccan Style from this site. Fantastic pairing.

I think this is a wonderful, easy to make recipe, authentic or not. I made with cashews and blanched almonds toasted. Preferred the almonds and will try pine nuts and pistachios

There's a lot going on in this dish, to overall good effect. I was careful about the amount of dates and lemon juice I put in--they can take over. Especially the dates--it's probably a good idea to chop them relatively fine.

to all you purists who think you shouldn't rate a recipe unless you did EVERYTHING right: I usually agree with you. but not today. so please disregard this. to everyone else: I basically used this as an excuse to get rid of all kinds of leftovers: golden raisins instead of chopped dates; chopped red onions and shallots instead of green onion; chopped rosemary instead of cilantro; leftover grated carrot from carrot cake, well, just because. I know I took many liberties but the end result was wonderfully scrumptious and both my husband and toddler gobbled it up. also, 1/2 cup olive oil looks like a lot, but I whisked it in slowly till it was emulsified, and the overall balance of flavors was just divine. hubby is already requesting it again and gosh, who knows when I will have a pantry full of leftovers just like this? :) it's great to have such a versatile and fulfilling recipe in one's arsenal.

Excellent! Made the rice in a rice cooker. This is a very portable dish as it is served at room temperature.

I love this recipe. It's easy, healthy, and produces fabulous leftovers. I add a couple of crushed garlic cloves to the cooking rice and substitute dried currants for the dates, which makes a very pretty salad. I also use only 1/4C olive oil, double the cinnamon, and add honey to taste in the dressing (perhaps 1T). I'm a big fan of the lemon-cinnamon combo; if I weren't I may cut back on both. As written, the cinnamon fades into a lovely flavor that is more the than the sum of its parts. Doubling the cinnamon gives you that plus a cinnamon top note. This isn't a recipe for people who don't enjoy lemon.

This is excellent! The only thing I change is that I use Chicken Broth, instead of the veggie.

This is awesome! What a good way to incorporate brown rice into the diet! I also added 1/4tsp cayenne and 1/3tsp nutmeg to this recipe. Also needs salt and pepper. I also substituted the cashews for a mixture of pine nuts, almonds and hazelnuts. Yum. One thing **You only need 1/8 to 1/4 cup of olive oil. I can't imagine this being as good if you used 1/2 cup.

I subbed chicken broth and cooked the rice in the broth in a rice cooker before cooling it. We took it camping and it was delicious the next day, too. I plan to bring this to potlucks this summer since it is delicous and also compatible with many food preferences and allergies: it is vegan, dairy free, wheat free, and doesn't contain any mayo to go bad in hot weather. And it's pretty.

While good, not Persian. The writer from Akron, OH thought it needed "ta-dig," but that's only for hot foods. This is a salad!!! Persians forget that things can be modified and food can be good without being so "traditional"...gets boring. don't get me wrong, I love Persian food and cook it all the time (since I'm Persian!), but love to experiment and tweek things. Good recipe.

A friend of mind served this at a party and I became addicted at first bite. I've made it several times since then and my family and I are still crazy about it.

This was gobbled up in no time. It's fast, healthy, and even with few ingredients has complex flavor. I added more cinnamon, and cooked the rice with the broth in a rice cooker, but otherwise I made it as written.

I made this dish for a Potluck Supper-using almonds instead of cashew.It was delicious-everyone liked it.

while not exactly authentically persian - with some slight changes - very good dish. I made this with a mix of brown rice and wild rice. I used the cilantro and green onions - I did not have cashews and used pine nuts (toasted) and did not have dates and used dried cranberries. Then, I made the dressing of lemon juice and oil on side and only added it until everything was moist. I also added allspice with the cinnamon and a bit of cayenne and of course salt and pepper. It was wonderful next to some grilled chicken and asparagus and was very good the next day as well. I think pine nuts/all spice gave it a more lebanese twist - which is great with my lebanese husband. Personally - authentic Persian food is beyond compare with me in freshness, taste, appearance,.....mmmmmm- but this is nice and easy.

Boring! And certainly not Persian. Basmati rice and pistashios are better combo. Still it's missing one of the most important elements of Persian rice dishes: tah dig (the crispy crunchy stuff at the bottom!)

Great combination of flavors, forgiving of substitutions, pleases everyone, good the next day...what's not to like? The only thing that can ruin this is a bad olive oil. Good ones won't let the lemon take over.

Great recipe to use what you have on hand, I used pistachio nuts instead of cashews; white instead of brown rice. Reheated the leftovers the next day and added dried cranberries. Great dish that you can do a lot with.

A unique and tasty dish. Good for something different, but won't be a "family favourite." Didn't find it as lemony as some complained; my hubby thought it was too sweet. The second day it was better. Even though it takes a long time to make, I would only make half a batch the first time you try it, because it makes enough to feed a small army!

It's not a "bad" salad, just not my thing. To be fair, I didn't have cilantro (used flat leaf parsely instead) or green onion. However, it still wouldn't be worth making again. Overly lemony and just odd (maybe because I'm not used to Persian food).

I've already made this several times in different ways. I've used dates, raisins, prunes, cashews, brazil nuts, and almonds, and I've switched white rice for mixed grain and used lime juice instead of lemon. ALL of the incarnations were good! My favorite was mixed grain rice with dates and cashews and lime juice. So good, healthy, and easy.

I made this dish for a light supper for 30 at my house. Almost every guest asked for the recipe.It's really wonderful!

Quick, easy, and very tasty. The lemon seemed a bit too much at first, but after sitting 1/2 hour it had mellowed to just-right. Raisins stand in just fine for dates (which I don't typically have on hand). I cut the amount of nuts slightly, then sprinkled a few on top of each serving.
