I added a little chopped red onion, red grapes and a 1/2 a red fuji apple -- I omitted celery as no one really likes celery. It was really good.

This is one of my favorite chicken salad recipes. Simple and tasty. I've made it with poached chicken breasts, but it's even better using leftover rotisserie chicken.

Simple and nice, easy to make. I did however, substitute the celery with bell peppers and tossed in a 1/4 cup of chopped brown onion. I also like it on toasted sourdough bread.

Delicious! I made some changes: Added 3 thinly sliced green onions & a little dill. Didn't have any fresh parsley, so used 1 teaspoon freeze-dried parsley instead. The chicken was left-overs from a roasted chicken. Served it on a bed of shreaded lettuce, with a rustic-type bread .

I viewed this recipe as a base for adding a LOT more ingredients. I was trying to replicate a local deli's chicken salad-- they use pecans, which are quite good in chicken salad. I also used a dash of white pepper.

The first time I made this recipe, I used leftover (marinated) grilled chicken and it was very good. I also tried it with just cooked chicken and it wasn't as tasty. I will only make it with grilled chicken and I also kick it up a little with garlic.

I found this to be very bland, I was not impressed. As suggested, I added green grape halves and toasted chopped almonds; but it didn't help. I won't make this again, there are better recipes on this site for chicken salad.

My husband and I loved this quick and crunchy chicken salad. I used red flame grape halves too. Another variation my husband suggested was to use salted peanuts instead of the toasted slivered almonds. Definetely would make this again.

Not sure if this counts as the same recipe since I subbed cilantro for parsley and added green onions. Also, I toasted whole dry roasted almonds and then chopped them up prior to adding. That really added some crunch. I also added green grape halves. It could have used more PUNCH, but I was clueless what to add or subtract.

A great tasting and healthy lunch. We eat it 5 days a week about ever 2 or 3 weeks. We use a can of chicken breast & go from there. be certain to toast the almonds!

We only used 1/2 cup of almonds but added fresh diced pineapple and served it in pineapple boats with fresh vegetables and fruits alongside.

This recipe is wonderful .... I used leftover grilled chicken breast and low-fat mayo, and my husband & I can't stop eating it! The red grape halves are a great addition.

I just this was just "okay" because of all the almonds. I would only add 1/2 cup next time. By the end of the dish, I was sick of almonds! I added some halved purple grapes for depth. They really add color and dimension. I also substituted lime juice for the lemon.

I enjoyed this recipe and it was simple to make. I did substitute lime juice for lemon and I left out the cilantro as I detest the herb. Very delicious.

I substituted pecans for the almonds and it was wonderful. They were still crunchy the next day. Everyone asked for the recipe. Simple yet elegant dish.

The slivered toasted almonds are quite good in this, especially right after it is made.
