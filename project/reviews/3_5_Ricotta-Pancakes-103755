Since the only place in San Francisco that made ricotta pancakes has changed ownership (and stopped serving them), I decided to start making my own. This is an excellent recipe...makes the most moist, fluffy, beautiful pancakes, ever. You do have to have a talent with egg whites, otherwise they will not turn out. My one difficulty with this recipe is that I have a very tiny kitchen, with NO counter space, so juggling 3 bowels was impossible. I had to get creative in my preparation. Just an FYI: they really need to be served with something sweet, as they are not really sweet on their own.

I have made these several times and they always turn out fabulous. The batter was never too runny. Maybe I whipped the egg whites more? or something in the folding of the egg whites into the rest of the batter? I didn't use any substitutions either. They are a very tender texture when cooked. Very light and airy.

These were good. When my nine yo tasted these he said, "These taste really plain." (bland?) He still ate 5 of them and decided they were great with syrup. They were very tender, not too thin at all and cooked up to a beautiful brown. I only made a half recipe & it still fed my family of 4. The 2 hour old leftover was good too!

Go make these! Amazing texture, fantastic taste. I made a few changes that I think really added to them: switch 1/3 cup whole wheat flour for 1/3 cup all purpose, add 2 teaspoons honey, 1/2 teaspoon lemon zest, and a lot of frozen blueberries, they're key.

These pancakes were amazing! I used fresh ricotta from the Farmers Market which had the consistency of a crumbled goat cheese. I substituted skim milk (slightly less than the recipe called for since skim milk is runny) and I used Fage 2% yogurt instead of sour cream. I also added Meyer lemon zest. Delicious.

I just have to say I LOVE this recipe! I had been looking for a recipe like this for years as my grandfather used to make ricotta pancakes with real maple syrup and butter and I loved them. This is the closest I have come to his. It brings backs so many wonderful memories every time I make them for my own children. I think some of these "chefs" must have done something wrong because I have never had them be too runny. They are so light and fluffy! A definite keeper!!

really, really, really good. I feel like they needed something more like lemon zest or something to make them pop. But te texture was great.

I almost feel obligated to 'protect' this recipe as I have made these pancakes about 20 times and loved them every time! They are by far my wife's favorite. Yes, the batter is a little runny, but you simply need to turn the heat down a little and give them a bit more time to cook. As with all pancakes, the first batch always turns out goofy.

This is my favorite pancake recipe. Forget buttermilk. These pancakes are both light and moist - an unusual combination. They're extra work, but worth it for guests.

It is not often that I have a complete disaster in the kitchen. But this was one of them. The batter was far too thin, too delicate to cook properly, and the pancakes tore when I turned them. I adjusted the heat appropriately, and no matter what I did, these just would not cook up properly. The batter was just too delicate and thin. (And yes, I know how to whip eggwhites to soft peaks.) All in all - a failure. I didn't get to eat a single one. I ended up eating the rest of the ricotta with honey and almonds for breakfast instead.

The ricotta gives the pancakes a nice mild flavor. Though even after thoroughly cooking, the inside still tastes a bit too moist and runny. It's cooked but the consistency is mushy. I also added about 1/4 c flour because the batter looked so wet. It was a good thing I did or the consistency problem likely would have been more pronounced.

I really did not enjoy these pancakes. I found them too bland, too runny and just plain unsatisfying, with a taste resembling a cross between whipped ricotta and an egg-white omblet. There are so many great reviews of this recipe that I just wanted to add my negative impression to balance it out a bit. Unless one is really concerned about eating healthily, I would avoid this recipe and stick with regular or oatmeal pancakes.

Didn't change a thing and they were perfect. So yummy with pumpkin butter and caramelized bacon (also on this site). Perfect Christmas brunch.

Easy to make, and my hubby said they were good enough to serve at the B&B of my future dreams!! Added a bit of lemon juice and vanilla extract to the batter. Served this with an apple topping (Granny Smith apples sauteed with butter, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar) and drizzled with the finest maple syrup. They weren't as "fluffy" as I expected, but good anyway!!

I served these for several people for breakfast at the lake. Everyone loved them. They were more "creamy" than regular pancakes.

Although I replaced the flour with wholemeal and used ultra light sour cream , skim milk and low fat ricotta, the pancakes turned out very light. I am used to thicker ones but just feeling these crepes gives one a satisfaction beyond words :-)

This is now my favorite pancake recipe. I've made the recipe as-is; lightened it up by using 1% milk and low-fat yogurt in place of the whole milk and sour cream; and added lemon juice and fresh blueberries, all with spectacular result.

These pancakes are delicious and only half the guilt. Definitely a weekend thing, very time consuming. I used a combination of whole wheat flour, oats and almond meal instead of the flour to kick up the fiber and anti-oxidants. I used a syrup with frozen blueberries and cranberry juice on top. Great for low-carbies!

This recipe is better than the review I gave it yesterday. My husband has been raving about them and asked me to make them again. He "loves them." He would like fruit in them.

Made half the batter for two of us. Very light and fluffy! Added lemon zest at the sugggestion of antoher. Tasted rather bland/plain but will make it again, felt less carby than regular pancakes. Did not think maple syrup tasted well w/it. Preferred peach preserves on top.

After making first two pancakes it needed some zing, so I added lemon rind and juice. Serve dusted with icing sugar -- A MUST -- and topped with blueberry compote or any berry combo. Very nice. Similar to a recipe I have for Norwegian Pancakes with the inclusion of levening.

Great recipe! I served it at brunch,and both adults and children liked it. As part of a brunch buffet, it served 8 people with leftovers.

These were great pancakes -- nice and moist, and I didn't find them to be too runny at all. I halved the recipe and it was perfect for three people. Would definitely make again.

TO DIE FOR! These pancakes were so light and delicious. The texture was just wonderful. I added about 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon. Wow! My hubby the chef was very impressed. I will definitely make these again but I will probably do a half recipe if I am just making them for the two of us. We had a lot of leftover batter.

Light as a feathery, delicate, delicious taste! Airy, one of the best pancakes i ever had. I didn't have sour cream so I left it out and added extra milk. Had some overripe bananas, so I mashed those and added them. The bananas went very well with the ricotta cheese. A Keeper!

Oh, I'm in heaven. Dream Cafe in Dallas serves "dream cakes" which are ricotta pancakes, so I am thrilled to have a recipe now. These are light and fluffy beyond compare, thanks to the egg whites folded in. My batter wasn't runny, as I noticed in other reviews, perhaps the other reviewers didn't fully prepare the whites until soft peaks formed? I don't know - but they turned out lovely for us and we devoured them. The only exception being my 3-year-old, who thought we were having regular pancakes and didn't like the change!

I didn't have ricotta cheese, so I substituted cream cheese but only used half the amount called for the ricotta. I also added a few Tablespoons more flour than stated, and used non fat milk instead of whole milk. I also added sugar, vanilla and cinnamon. Although they came out very thin and flat , they were delicious and my husband loved them. I actually halved the entire recipe and it was enough for the me, my husband and our two dogs! I would make this recipe again, it was light and delicious.

I was surprised to see so many reviews from folks who didn't like this. We've made these pancakes many times and LOVE THEM!!! Served with fresh berries, they are perfect. We'll be having them for mother's day tomorrow to be sure.

These are wonderful pancakes! They are superior to buttermilk pancakes in both taste and texture. I made them this weekend and followed the recipe (for a change), except I apparently made them larger since I didn't make 40 pancakes. I used a very good maple syrup, but think I'd also like them with something like a fruit compote.

I would think with the fattening ingredients in these pancakes, they would be something special. I was disappointed. They were not worth the effort or the calories. Plain buttermilk pancakes are much better.
