I followed the first reviewer's ideas and sauteed the onions and chicken (with some zataar) before adding to the slow cooker with about 4 c of broth, 1 lb chicken, 1 acorn squash, and 3 (small) carrots. I used a pinch of cinnamon rather than a whole stick. I wish I had sauteed the garlic a little bit and used more chicken, but otherwise it was very flavorful, and veggies were not too mushy.

Wow.....delicious! Used a bit more chicken and left out the rutabagas but added carrots, chickpeas and some cayenne to bump up the flavor...was terrific! Will definitely make again.

I made a vegetarin version of this dish. In place of the chicken, I substituted 2 cups of cooked chickpeas, and in place of the chicken broth, I used vegetable broth. I also added about 1 Tbs tumeric and 1 small can of tomato paste to the recipe. Additionally, as I didn't have any sweet potatoes, I substituted acorn squash, which was delicious. Forgot to add the green olives as recc'd by another reviewer, but would definitely do on a repeat of this dish. We loved it...fast, easy, vegetariann dish, which was better the second day.

Yummy! I made this in my slow-cooker... browning the chicken and sauting the onions with the spices first, then adding all the ingredients to the slow-cooker and cooking on low for 6 hours. I also about doubled the cumin and curry, increased the broth to about 3 1/2 cups and cut back on some of the vegetables. I served it with toasted ciabatta brushed with olive oil (for dipping.) Would definitely make it again.

This is an easy dish to make, I have been making it since 1998. If you are not achieving a full flavor and richness, you are doing something wrong! There is always room to add to this dish by adding cashews, Harissa, etc.. The finely chopped cilantro on top is amazing. To avoid too sweet of a taste, include a smaller stick of cinnamon or remove it sooner. I have also made this with lamb as well as beef, just adjust the broth to beef. Splendid.

Yum! I used 4 chicken thighs, browned the meat with the skin on, then removed the skin and took the meat off the bone. Almost doubled the spices and added an extra cup of chicken broth, cubed carrots and potatoes. Served everything over quinoa. The kids and hubby loved it.

First time I made this I used chix thighs on bone and added with vegetables. The second time I made it with chix breast as instructed and it was also good. Either way, it needs to cook about 45 min. with the vegetables. 20 minutes is not enough. I used more garlic and currents, doubled the amount of curry powder, added 1 cup carrots, cayenne pepper, and as recommended by one reviewer, the juice and zest of one lemon and chopped green olives (~1/4 - 1/3 cup). Also added chix soup base when made with chix breast instead of thighs. In the end it was very good and I served it over couscous.

Pretty mild, definitely sweet, did not wow us or our guests, although it was a wonderful use of root vegetables.

Made this per the recipe and it was delicious, a bit sweet, might omit the parsnips next time to tone down the sweetness. Great over couscous. I'd absolutely make it again.

This is a good way to use up all the root vegetables in my Boston Organics box, and it's very filling. I think the balance of root vegetables definitely makes a difference. I've made this before using only a bunch of sweet potatoes and maybe a regular potato, depending on what I had, and it was a little too sweet.

Rating: 4
Huge hit with the family. I doubled it and aside from the initial sauteeing of the chicken, onions and spices, cooked it in the crockpot (note: a 6 quart crockpot isn't *quite* big enough for a doubled recipe, so some of the veggies were crunchier than they were supposed to be!). I'd forgotten to buy cous-cous so we just served it over rice. Perhaps a bit "soupier" than the recipe intended, but I think this is an artifact of using the crockpot rather than the stovetop.

This is a very tasty stew that is pretty easy to make. I made it as written, but next time I think I will double the amount of chicken, since 12 ounces just did not seem like enough.

Found a similiar recipe on chowhound and combined the two, and it was delicious. Did not use as many root veggies, but did use carrots, sweet potatoes and parsnips. Also added from the other recipe: cauliflower, 1+cup of sliced green olives, and fresh grated ginger. CH recipe also called for preserved lemon, I didn't have so I used zest and juice of 1 lemon. I think that the lemon and olives really helped the flavor, and avoided the sweetness mentioned by many of the posters. Also from CH recipe, I used toasted almonds and scallions in the couscous, and then topped bowls with dollop of greek yogurt and sprinkled some sunflower seeds. Great!! Will make again, altho prep time is long w/all the peeling and chopping.

Flavorful and interesting addition to a buffet supper. I made an alternative verison for vegetarian meal using chick peas instead of the chicken - best to add these 10 minutes before the end of cooking to preserve their shape and texture.

This was pretty good - I sauteed the onion and garlic but otherwise threw everything in the slow cooker on high for about six hours. We also served it on some basmati rice and it was pretty tasty! Oh yeah, and I didnt have a cinnamon stick so I put in about a 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon.

This stew was quite wonderful. I used chicken breast cubes but, in order for the chicken not to dry out after I browned it, I only cooked it with the vegetables for about two minutes, then turned off the heat and left the stew covered for about 10 mins. more. The end result was succulent, moist chicken and tender veggies.

Rating: 3
This recipe was like a jumping off point - as I made some changes. I used chicken thighs - more moise - and doubled the amount of chicken. I used sweet potatoes, yams, carrots and parsnips and skipped the rutabagas and turnips. Also used dried cranberries rather than raisins. A really tasty, hearty and fairly healthy stew. My husband and I stopped eating beef a year ago so this is a great alternative on a cold winter evening.

This was a first attempt for me making the stew and it was wonderful! I would add more chicken and a little more diced tomatoes, but I thought the seasoning was perfect. I actually substituted crasins for the raisins and currants and it was delicious! The spices can be adapted for people who prefer an extra kick. I will definitely make this again, probably in a double batch!!

This was a wonderful hearty, but healthy meal on a cold winter night. I made a few substitutions based on what I had available. I don't care for rutabagas and turnips so I used parsnips, sweet potatoes, yams and carrots instead. Added a roughly diced red bell pepper and used chicken thighs. I loved the seasoning - but I did have to add more salt. Will definitely make again. My husband who's from India enjoys anything with a little heat. I'm from the midwest and I could handle the heat - so we were both happy.

I made this last night as I recently visited a friend in Paris who served a Morrocan meal and wanted to recreate the experience for my husband and son. We all loved it and it is in the "Make Again" file. I did use boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the meat. I also used just one of each of the veggies (1/2 rutabaga) as there are only three of us. As I served it with couscous, I increased the broth to 3 cups, but might use even more next time.

I was hesitant to try this since so many people said it was a bit bland. I am glad I did try it. First off, the people who said it took longer than 30 minutes to simmer the vegetables, didn't cut them small enough. Next, this is not a bland recipe. I made it just as written, and it was quite tasty. The cinnamon stick helps with the savory flavor. I would definitely make this again on a cold Autumn evening. Yum-

disappointed, not enough flavor, chicken was dry. If I was to change it I would use chicken pieces instead of breast, need more raisins or apricots, more spices. would make it again

I loved this recipe, and I made it in my crock pot: brown chicken (I used boneless thighs) and onions first, then put root vegetables on the bottom of the crock pot, topped with chicken and onions, and reduce liquid to 1 cup. Cook for 4 hours on low, add spices, then cook 1 more hour. Vegetables were cooked perfectly! I agree with other comments to increase quantities of spices and currents.

Rating: 4
Very aromatic and tasty dish. Did make a few changes and additions. Added 2 cups carrots and 1/2 tsp of paprika and upped raisins to 1/2 cup. Parcooked the parsnips, carrots and rutabaga in microwave. Very dense veggies and they take far longer to cook than 30 mins. I simmered it for an hour. Served over couscous. My husband raved about this dish. Would make it for a dinner party.

This was amazing! I am a vegetarian, so I used 1 pkg Quorn Naked Cutlets (www.quorn.com) for the chicken and it worked perfectly. The curry powder I have is very spicy, so I used half of what the recipe called for. I added 1/2 tb of Coriander, another cinnamon stick and 2 extra cloves of garlic. It was wonderful and very pretty. The yellow yams add a nice touch. I would suggest serving it with something green (spinach?), or adding peas right before serving, or making sure to garnish with that cilantro. It makes 10 cups, so a serving is a generous amount. This is a great recipe to use these under-appriciated vegetables.

Rating: 4
I inadvertabtly froze a number of chicken breasts together so they needed to be defrosted and used. I came across this recipe on Epicurious and produced it, to my and my husband's delight. I added more seasoning than called for - cumin and curry specifically. That's a matter of taste. Peeling and chopping the root vegetables were time consuming, but the end result was worth it.

Rating: 3
Very good. More Indian than Moroccan but good flavor. I do agree with just about every reviewer that you need to add about 50% more spices and some chili for a kick. I also added chopped dried apricots but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I prefer white meat and thought it turned out fine. I served this to athletes who can never get enough to eat and with couscous this recipe made enough to filled them up.

Rating: 3
This dish was a huge hit. I would recommend doubling the chicken and using chicken thighs in addition to the breasts as it adds quite a bit more flavour. Also, increase the amount of spice, as it is a bit bland. Serve over couscous for a really good hearty meal.

I really liked this dish when I used chicken thighs with the bone instead of white meat. I added the chicken with the vegetables and simmered for 45 min. instead of 20 min. Then at the very end added the tomotoes. The flavor was richer and and the meat was moister. I also used more curry powder, about 1.5 times what the recipe called for, a pinch or two of of cayenne for a kick and chicken soup base since I didn't have homemade stock. I also added 1 cup of carrots.

Rating: 4
Especially served with couscous, this dish is very similar to some I have had in Moroccan restaurants in Paris. I made this according to the recipe, but next time I will add more cumin and curry, and add some white pepper. I think this would also work with other vegetables - carrots, zuccini, etc. If you want to make this vegetarian, omit the chicken and add garbanzo beans. A great recipe made as is or for experimentation!

As much as I hate to admit this, I never had parsnips, turnips or rutabagas before and I still thought I would give this recipe a try. I am glad that I did. After reading some of the other reviews, the only changes I had made were increasing the cumin and curry by 25% and I added a cup of chicken stock to increase the liquid because I have the tendency to simmer everything longer than needed. Next time, and there will be a next time, I am going to increase the amount of chicken. It says that it is six servings, but my wife and I only got 5 bowls out of it. I ate three and my wife ate two so we don't have any leftovers. I would suggest a french bread, maybe garlic bread to complete it.

Very bland and disappointing! Reduced the amount of veggies relative to the chicken and used 1/2 t cinnamon powder instead. Even the addition of red pepper flakes didn't help much. I suggest the Seven Vegetable Couscous recipe on this site instead -- it's excellent!!

Rating: 3
Moroccan? I don't think so. Curry powder is far more Indian than Moroccan. I took the advice of previous reviewers and used skinless chicken thighs, trimmed of visible fat, instead of the breasts, which would be drier than I would like. I also reduced the veggies, using half a very large yam, three large carrots, and 1 large white turnip (what I had on hand) to 1.5 pounds of chicken thighs (wt. before skinning and boning). Instead of the seasonings listed, I used 1/4 tsp. each powdered saffron and paprika, and 1/8 tsp. each ground cumin and cayenne. I seasoned the chicken with salt and white pepper. I also added the peel of a preserved lemon cut in 6 pieces with the tomatoes. Preserved lemons can be purchased at specialty markets or can be made at home. If I hadn't had any, I still would have added some lemon juice to cut the sweetness of the yam and raisins. For the broth, I boiled 4 cups to reduce to the 2 cups listed, which made it more flavorful. The result, served over whole wheat couscous, sprinkled with both flat leaf parsley and the cilantro, tasted much more like the tagines we ate in Morocco than I think the original recipe would have.

YUM!!!!!!! I omitted the rutabega, threw in a carrot and some celery- used Chili Powder in place of the the Cumin (I was out) and tripled the curry powder. Also added a few bay leaves and increased the chicken. Just keep adding spices until it tastes right- when it does- YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

One of my favorite memories from living in Morocco was the traditional Friday meal of tagine over couscous. This dish comes very close to recapturing that memory. I changed some things: less parsnips, white potatoes added, rutabaga removed, chicken breasts left on the bone (but skin removed) to get more flavor from them. I also added some cayenne as suggested in the other reivews. I threw it all the the crock pot and cooked it all day (to simulate real Moroccan cooking). About an hour before dinnertime, I pulled the chicken out and shredded the meat from the bone, then put it back in to let it absorb the flavors. My wife loved it. We've been eating the leftovers all weekend. I'm sure this will become a fall/winter staple in my house.

I was born in Casablanca, and while this isn't traditional, it's kind of a nice starter dish for those unfamiliar w/Moroccan food. Do up the spices to your taste, but fyi not too hot and the sweet/savory thing is a key part of this cuisine. If you don't like that, you'd be better off trying some other recipe.

Our family was hugely dissapointed with this...especially with how great it smells. It was too sweet. Definately up the spices, and while I don't like spicy food, I can only imagine the cayenne mentioned below could only help. Overall, I threw the leftovers away. No one wanted to eat this twice.

Pretty good stew. Love the root vegetables in it. Subbed carrots for the rutabaga and added 1 tsp. of cinnamon instead of the stick. There were lots of comments at the ski chalet about it's wonderful aroma when I heated it up over the weekend. Needs salt and pepper. I think it would taste better with boneless skinless chicken thighs, but wouldn't be as low fat. Makes quite a bit. Good with the couscous, too.

This is a nice foundation for a great recipe, but it needs some tweaks. The chicken to vegetable proportion is off- not nearly enough chicken for all those vegies. Increase the amount of chicken used or decrease the vegeatables (depending on how much stew you want to end up with). Definitely add some cayenne, and be very generous with the curry. And be careful with the turnips- they tend to overpower.

Other than spending several hours chopping the vegetables, the stew was quick to prepare. The recipe is easy to follow and the blending of the spices really makes this an incredible stew to be served with couscous. We will definitely be making this stew again!

I think the reviews are mixed on this recipe due to the chicken broth. I used 2 cans of Campbells chicken broth (it's concentrated) and Sharwood's curry powder - 1/2 hot madras and 1/2 mild madras and I thought this recipe was great!! It's so flavorful, truly Moroccan. I wouldn't hesitate to leave the chicken out next time it doesn't add or detract from the stew.

A delicious dish with room for variation. I've followed the other reviewers' suggestion of adding cayenne pepper to balance the sweetness, and i've also tried using different root vegetables like potatoes and carrots in it with good results. Sometimes i will add a can of chick peas to substitute for some or all of the chicken when i add the other vegetables. Great with or without couscous, and leftovers taste great although the vegetables sometimes do get a little too mushy as another reviewer noted.

Rating: 3
A fine food affair. A guilt-free repast and refreshing in taste. I would omit nothing but did find one reviewer's suggestion of a dash of cayenne a plus; my "plus" was approximately a heaping teaspoon, if not a tad more. This recipe is really not a time-consuming endeavor, despite the preparation of the root vegetables. It was delectable with the couscous. And kosher dill strips as an accompaniment, for us, were a plus to balancing the sweetness.

Rating: 3
I doubled the cumin and curry, which really helped intensify this dish. I also used more chicken and because I couldn't get parsnips, I added a bit more of the rutabega. The cilantro is absolutely key to pulling this all together. I thought this was really good and would make it again.

This is wonderful! I, too, have begun to make it weekly. I never use the chicken or the currants, but just whatever root veggies I am in the mood for (squash, parnsips, turnips, sweet potato and yam). I always add a can of chickpeas or two at the end, and the key to this is 1) use good strong curry and 2) while the stock and veggies are cooking I use a few tbs. of pickling spice in a little packet with cheesecloth that I remove at the end. Makes stew incredibly flavorful!
