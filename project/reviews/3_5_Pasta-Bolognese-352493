I might make this, and it is probably delicious. Just be aware that it has been tinkered with. Authentic pasta Bolognese uses only beef (ground skirt steak, actually), no cream (reduced whole milk instead), and is very light on the tomatoes--5 Tb. paste, at the most. And it traditionally served with tagliatelle. It does not use Parmigiano-Reggiano either, though I suppose it could, since it does come from the same region. We Americans just love to gussy things up and heap on the butterfat.

At least in my experience, and to my taste, white wine works better than red. Whatever else, please, no bacon. I wouldn't use the pancetta either, but the smoked flavor of bacon has no place in a Bolognese sauce, or in much of anything Italian.

Thank goodness my mother-in-law who showed me how to make this is not reading what people are doing to the sauce,,,The recipe she showed me is close to this so why do people think the should change it?Im lost with the idea that it is given and some feel they can make it better?ITS BEEN MADE THE SAME WAY FOR 100'S of years...learn to appreciate what is shared!!!!or go by Ragu in the bottle and add to it!!!!By the way my Mother-in-law lives in BOLOGNA!!!!

Sorry to review twice,but I meant to say that while this review does include cream, it doesn't braise in, or even use milk.

Great recipe, but it's not a real bolgnese! "Ragù alla bolognese is a complex dish that involves a mix of cooking techniques, including sweating, sauté and braising," and it usually uses milk and often some cream, but this recipe is simplified to only sauté. the sweating and braising leave the meats softer, and so the sauce is more voluptuous. It IS more work, which is why it isn't made this way in less expensive restaurants and in many people's homes, but it's what makes the sauce not just another meat sauce.

I modified this recipe by using 1.5 boxes of strained tomatoes (don't like the metallic flavor of canned), 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup half and half instead of cream, more pork instead of veal, and adding 10 or so crimini mushrooms diced very small. I also removed the meat (and all juices and fat) from the pan in order to brown the veggies and then put it all back together. It was delicious and didn't create a lot of dishes to clean afterward! Would totally make it again. Quality ingredients make all the difference.

Tasted amazing! I'm a novice at cooking and this was very easy to make. I did make some changes though, per the other reviews. I used a 28 ounce can of crushed tomatoes and didn't have the wateriness issue described in other reviews. I also went with bacon instead of pancetta. I added 4 gloves of garlic crushed with a pestle and mortar, oregano, and two bay leaves.

Soooo delicious. I used about 1 lb meat but in equal portions. Pancetta comes in 4oz packets so that's what went in. I read the previous reviews and added 2 crushed garlic cloves and I strained the crushed tomatoes and reserved the juice in case it became too liquid but I ended up using most of it at the end. I only had about 2/3 cup heavy cream in the fridge and it was enough. My whole family loved it including the orrichiette.

I used half of the toms per other comments and I was happy with the results as I don't like overly tomatoey sauce. Added garlic as it's difficult for me to cook pasta without garlic - glad I added it. I used half ground pork and half ground beef and it was delicious. Husband said it's one of his favorite meals. Will definitely make it again.

If using 2 cans (28 Fl oz) of whole tomatoes, i recommend not keeping the water (juice), blend the tomatoes only or add more meat. I found a quarter pound of each wasn't enough. I followed the instructions very closely and the final product was a very runny sauce. Looked like a soup broth. I will certainly make it a recipe of my own (more meat + some tomato paste)

Rating: 3
I was planning on following the original recipe but realized salt and pepper are not enough to season a pasta dish with -- so I added garlic powder and oregano to add extra flavor. Also, I used bucatini pasta and it was great. I highly recommend bucatini for any meat sauce. However, there is one thing that was totally off with the recipe... The final stage, where you're supposed to let it simmer for 30 minutes on very low heat is very off. I set it on low heat for 20 minutes and when I returned, the sauce looked exactly the same. So after tampering with it for a bit, I put it on medium high heat and let it sit there for 90 minutes and FINALLY it was ready. I think if you wanna leave it on low, you have to leave it on there for 3-4 hours. Except that, everything else was delicious.

Great recipe...almost as good as my recipe for Pork Sugo at No Recipe Required. Ha ha. This definitely gets better the long you cook it, and I like using a mix of different meats. I think you can substitute just about anything...which is why I love these types of dishes.

I only used beef in this recipe (organic ground beef from Costco) and beef bacon. I also added two stalks of celery and an extra carrot and used half and half instead of cream. It took about an hour and a half to reduce to the consistency I liked. Oh, and I added a big spoon of tomato paste and a bay leaf towards the end. Delicious. There is more than enough for one pound of pasta; we're already on a second package of pasta. Is a big hit!

Rating: 3
overall i think this was a pretty good recipe that i would make again however i made few changes. First instead of the cream i used whole milk to make it a little healthier. I also did not use an entire can of tomatoes, i think one 24 oz can is waaay too much, and makes it too soupey. i also did not have wine so instead i used one cup of chicken broth mixed with a bit of red wine vinegar. Finaly i let it simmer with a bay leaf. It all turned out really good and was a big hit!

my son is allergic to dairy so I substituted chilled coconut milk (from a can) for the cream and it came out delicious! Didn't have the veal and pork this time, just used bacon and ground beef, looking forward to trying it with the different meats next time

Though others said do not double the recipe...I did. They were right - it makes a lot and I would imagine the recipe has more melded flavors Helpful hints: I added extra cream, and wine, several shakes of nutmeg, a splash of balsamic vinegar. After simmering for 1.5 hours the recipe started to take hold and have depth. I will try it again - but not doubling the recipe.

Rating: 3
Very good recipe. I used a combo of ground beef and ground chicken and used both pancetta & bacon. Followed the rest of the recipe except I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. It was delicious and easy to make. It's a keeper.

Rating: 0
Don't double the recipe. Didn't love this but think it was my fault. My husband bought way to much meat so we decided to double the recipe. If I made again I would double the meat but not the tomatoes and milk/cream because it was too thin and the flavor became somewhat diluted. Definately better bolognese recipes out there but this is decent when you don't have 3 hours.

Yummy. The whole family loved it, including our 3-yr old. I will definitely find an excuse to serve this up to friends for a leisurely dinner get-together in the near future. Good bang for the buck, esp considering how quickly it came together. I only used beef and bacon (no veal/pork). Plus I added ground garlic, a rib of finely chopped celery, and a mixture of black pepper and red chili flakes.

i have now made this receipe 2 times and it make a large quantity of sauce that freezes wonderfully!! and is just as good defrosted!! I did trade the veal for turkey and it was just as good the second time (ground turkey cost less)and use a wine you would actually drink. cooking wine isn't as good in a cream sauce to me. the 1 lb of pasta is only enough for a family of 4 for one dinner and you will have extra sauce to freeze

I made this for a quick dinner on a busy night and it was just great! In an hour of total prep and cooking, I had fettuccine bolognese as good as the ones that took me all day to make. I did sub light cream for the heavy and a "meatloaf" mixture for the 3 separate meats - it was more cost effective to by it premixed together. Will definitely make it again, and again.

I made this for a house full of picky guys and it was a HUGE hit! I doubled the recipe but forgot to get 2 more cans of the crushed tomatoes. So I ended up doubling the wine, adding 1.5x the cream, and using only the 2 cans of tomatoes. I was worried that the flavours wouldn't be balanced but it came out fantastic! This really is one of those dishes you can play with and adjust according to personal taste. I omitted veal b/c I am not okay with how they are raised--very sad. I suppose you could say that about the meat industry in general, but the conditions those baby calves are kept in are much worse. Anyway, I ended up using 12 slices of bacon, 1 lb of ground beef and 1.25 lbs of ground pork. I put in 1.5 onions and just the one carrot. Used Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon...always use a wine that you'd drink yourself. That one was pretty good. Used regular salt and pepper b/c that's all I had. Oh, and I added crushed red peppers to the sauce...really kicked it up! Didn't combine sauce and pasta...left it up to each person to put how much they wanted. Anyway, these guys STUFFED themselves! I have to say, I was pretty surprised at how yummy it turned out...will make again and again.

Yum, yum, yum, yum. This sauce totally hit the spot. I followed the recipe pretty faithfully, with the addition of some chopped celery added with the onion and carrot. Delicious. This recipe makes a ton of sauce, so there was lots left over to freeze for future delicious meals. Serve it with a green salad and some garlic bread -- great comfort food.

Not bad, but I felt the need to add some fresh chopped oregano to the final product for some more flavor. This recipe made SO MUCH,and I halved the tomatoes and cream. It might not be authentic as is or if you add garlic and herbs, either way, next time I'm definitely putting some garlic and herbs in.

We enjoyed this recipe although it is entirely different from other bolognese recipes that I have made. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added chopped celery and two crushed garlic cloves just because.There are tons of leftover sauce for another day or two. Could someone explain this to me, please? How could one sub sour cream for heavy cream?!! They have nothing in common except that they're dairy.

This is a great recipe. I've made it several times now, with subtle variations each time based on available ingredients. For the most part, I followed as is, using half the suggested oil and omitting the carrot (although I intend to try it). The difference in each time i've made it has been the availability of pancetta and/or orecchiette. I substituted lean bacon for the pancetta when i couldn't find it, and medium shells when I couldn't find the orecchiette. Shells or orecchiette are definitely the way to go because the rich meaty sauce kind of fills into the pasta and its a thing of beauty. As others have suggested I also added a few things to spice it up and make it feel like my own. I chose to include garlic powder and oregano while the meat is simmering, and dried basil after adding the crushed tomatoes (You can also find basil seasoned crushed tomatoes instead). The dry red wine is kind of important to stick to, I once used what I had, which was just a sweeter california red table wine and it just wasnt the same. On a side note, if you can find pancetta, use it! Using bacon was just fine, but let me tell you, when I actually found pancetta it turned this dish into something magical. Last note is that this recipe makes a nice size pot, but don't worry it will go quick, and it might be even better the next day. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, I'm very thankful and happy to store this into my repertoire!

This is a very good, easy meat sauce. Not a true Bolognese, of course, but then it doesn't take three hours to cook, either. We like a thicker, meaty sauce, so we reduced the amount of tomatoes and cream by half. We also made the following modifications: omitted the olive oil (the pancetta throws off plenty of fat for the sauce); added a rib of celery, finely chopped; sauteed the vegetables with the pancetta for a few minutes before adding the meat; added a pinch of freshly grated nutmeg to the sauce.

I used all ground pork and sour cream instead of fresh cream because that was what I had on hand. I used chicken broth instead of wine due to sulfite allergies. It came out great and was an immediate family favorite. I will try with cream next time. I would definitely make this to serve at an informal dinner party with family and friends.

Very good! I added 2 tablespoons dried Italian seasonings before simmering and substituted 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper for the ground black pepper. Next time, I'll try sauteeing the carrots and onions right after the bacon before sauteeing the rest of the meat. Then, I'll drain the fat and liquid before adding the tomatoes and cream so the sauce won't be so watery/greasy. Perhaps I'll also add one 6 oz. can of tomato paste. Very pleasing flavor - excellent comfort food!

Hearty and satisfying! Made it on a cold winter night and it warmed my soul and belly  As always I have altered the recipe based on what was on hand so my experience may have been different from other cooks. Instead of pancetta I used prosciutto. I only had beef, so I skipped the pork and veal. I have added chopped leak and baby bellas to the onion and carrot mix. Used twice as much cream and it turned out reach and luscious, not watery like someones review suggested. At the end I added a dash of cayenne to make it pop in the mouth and fresh chopped Italian parsley. Finally, right before serving, I added a drizzle of white truffle oil! Served it with nice bottle of Cab! My boyfriend loved every bite!

Okay... this is not a true Bolognese sauce- it lacks some important traits- one important being bechamel sauce. Bolognese is almost always served with spaghetti (yes the type of pasta makes a difference). However, this is still a good meat sauce. Those who are poo-pooing the lack of garlic, be aware that it is not a typical ingredient in this dish. In addition, for those who are stating that Bolognese is an American creation... I dare you to go to Bologna and tell the locals that story. I hope you can run fast. :)

I don't know if this recipe is genuine Italian, Americanized, not a true Bolognese or anything else. What I do know is that it is delicious! I've made it three times since trying it last month. I find that it is very easy to make and tastes even better if it sits overnight. I did leave out the carrots when I made it, however. It actually makes so much that I had enough leftover for a second pound of pasta a few nights later. That is a big plus for me. I think it is the tastiest meat sauce I have ever made.

Haven't made it yet but will marry the recipes to Alton Brown's Bolognese recipe. According to Mr. Brown the sauce is an American creation and requires brasing since the use of pork shoulder. His recipe was by far the best sauce I ever tasted and instead of cream he uses condensed milk.

Added fresh crushed garlic to meat while sauting and served over suggested pasta (orecchiette) to rave reviews. Will add sausage next time .

This was, by far, the most disappointing recipe I have yet encountered. The photo suggests a hearty, meaty traditional Bolognese sauce; the reality: this sauce has far too much liquid and altogether lacks flavor. I should have known better when I read through the ingredients...where's the garlic, oregano, basil, or parsley. Other than a meager amount of salt and pepper there is no seasoning. If zero forks had been an option, that's what I would have rated it.

5 stars from these 2 food snobs! Make it a day ahead and enjoy! Don't change it a bit. All of our ingredients were exceptional quality and the meat was without nitrates. These garlic lovers loved this garlic-free dish as much as our garlic filled ones. Will I make it again? We had it last Friday and we're making it for guests tomorrow. A triumph, my dear!

Made it without the veal (had none on hand) and a day after it sat in the fridge, all the flavors melded and it was absolutely delicious. I also had to leave it on the stove for an hour (not 30 minutes as stated) before it thickened up and deepened in colour. My go-to bolognese sauce from now on.

First of all, I'd like to comment on the quantity of food this made - a lot!! For two adults, we'll have at least four more servings of the pasta and Bolognese. Second of all, since we don't eat red meat, we used solely pork products - ground pork and bacon fresh from the local Farmer's market. Delicious! But I do wonder if some of the flavours were missing since we didn't use veal or chuck. Regardless, I'll make this recipe again.

Try Marcella Hazan's Bolognese. It is much better. I add a little chopped pancetta to the pan before I saute the veggies and always have a quart on hand in my freezer. 1 Tb. oil 3 Tb. butter 1/2 c. chopped onion 2/3 c. chopped celery 2/3 c. chopped carrot 3/4 lb. ground beef chuck (not too lean) 1 c. whole milk nutmeg 1 c. dry white wine 1 1/2 c. canned Italian plum tomatoes, cut up with their juices 1. Put oil, butter and onion in pot and turn heat to medium. Cook until onion is translucent, then add celery and carrot. Cook for 2 min. 2. Add the ground beef, a large pinch of salt, & a few grindings of pepper. Crumble the meat with a fork and cook until beef has lost its raw, red color. 3. Add the milk and let simmer gently, stirring frequently, until it has bubbled away completely. Add about 1/8 tsp. nutmeg and stir. 4. Add the wine, let simmer until evaporated, then add the tomatoes. When tomatoes begin to bubble, turn the heat down and cook uncovered at the merest simmer for a long, long time (no less than 3 hours!). Stir from time to time. If it starts to stick, add 1/2 c. water whenever necessary.

This is a delightful bolognese, although, I wish I had my mama's or nonna's recipe. Oh well, this will suffice. All good bolognese is made with wine and cream, no matter whose recipe you follow, if it is authentic. I happen to prefer cavatelli as the macaroni to use with a bolognese. Juse me.

I made this recipe this weekend and it is by far, much easier than other "bolognese" sauce recipes I have tried. I used a nice chianti for the red wine. Next time I would chop the onion and carrot much finer (couldn't find my chopping blade for my fodd processor so did it by hand). Also, I used meat-loaf mix from my local safeway and used 1.25 lbs (since that was the size it was sold in and I didn't want to freeze such a little amount of left over meat. As someone who was taught to make tomato sauce from her "Nona" in the southern Italian style, I really like this recipe and would definitly make this again. This is my husband's new favorite sauce!

Here's a much closer one to the 1,000's of varriations that you'll run into in Bologna. Even some made with chicken livers - and called authentic by the Nonas that make it for their families (and learned it from their grandmothers). Ingredients 2 medium onions, finely chopped 4 celery ribs, finely chopped 2 medium carrots, finely chopped 5 garlic cloves, thinly sliced 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil 1/4 pound pancetta or slab bacon, ground by butcher or thinly sliced and pulsed in food processor until finely chopped 1 pound ground veal 1 pound ground pork (not lean) 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste 1 cup whole milk 1 cup dry white wine 1 cup water 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon black pepper Preparation Cook onions, celery, carrot, and garlic in oil in a 6- to 8-quart heavy pot over moderate heat, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add pancetta, veal, and pork and cook over moderately high heat, stirring and breaking up lumps, until no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Stir in tomato paste, milk, wine, water, and thyme and gently simmer, covered, until sauce is thickened, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add salt and pepper and remove from heat.

Just a note to explain that this is some type of ragu but it is not bolognese sauce. Bolognese sauce uses no tomatoes, only a couple of tablespoons of tomato paste mixed into the sofritto and browned. Also, the traditional sofritto has onion, carrots, garlic & celery. Lastly, bolognese is a recipe from Bologna. They would never use orecchiette (which are from Puglia), they would put bolognese in a lasagna or with fettucine or pappardelle.

I didn't make this recipe, but it probably tastes good. However if you are looking for an authentic Bolognese sauce recipe, this ain't it. First off 28oz cans of tomatoes are never used to make Bolognese let alone two cans. And there is no celery in with the onion and carrots. Wrong! Does Chef DiPerri think that he can re-define this classic Italian dish here in America? OK maybe he should call Mario Batali for some re-education. Otherwise we should maybe look forward to an Iron Chef battle with him as the challenger?
