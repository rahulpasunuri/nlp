This recipe was amazing -- simple and delicious. The flavor of the Fontina cheese is key, in my opinion. I also added a little garlic, garnished with flat parsley. I like a little spice, so I sprinkled of red pepper flakes on top of mine. Very unusual, very very good. Great for brunch or for dinner.
