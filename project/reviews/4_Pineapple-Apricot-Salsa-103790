Excellent salsa with cocnut shrimp also good with grilled pork tenderloin. I substituted 2 minced serrano chilies for jalapeno to give it more kick.

Delicious. Used apricot preserves and chilled for 3 hours to serve with coconut crusted shrimp from this site. Great together but would serve this salsa with grilled pork chops or chicken too.

I served this w/ the coconut shrimp. A perfect pairing. Didn't see apricot-pineapple preserves at Publix so just used apricot jam i had at home, and it seemed to work just fine. I wish the color was a little brighter, but the flavor is amazing. I practically shredded the pineapple, which was easy to do (i bought it fresh, already cut into bite-sized chunks). Could use this salsa with anything, but i think seafood is best.

I used peach/chili pepper preserves, and loved it, as did my guests. The comments show how easy it is to make substitutions and still stay true to the recipe. Do be sure to cut the pineapple into small bits, so that each bite has some of each flavor. I served with chips; it would be great on fish or chicken or shrimp.

This was a great and very simple recipe. My husband and I happen to have been given a fruit of the month subscription and this month's fruit was pineapple. We BBQ'd for ourselves last night and served this with chips. I put it on my hamburger and thought it was great. It would also be great on grilled chicken or tacos (fish, chicken). I left out the cilantro and used apricot preserves. After tasting I added more jalapeno and salt & pepper. This would be great and easy to take to a BBQ at someone's home as well...

This worked quite well with the coconut shrimp, although I used more lime juice and jalapenos. Didn't even try to find pineapple-apricot preserves at the store, so subbed 1/2 cup of a homemade mango-jalapeno chutney. Think I may puree some of this recipe next time to make it into a real dipping sauce for the shrimp. Quite good as is, though.

Agree with Berkeley...this was a little sweet for my tastes, especially with the coconut. Next time, I'll start with less preserves and see how it goes.

I was skeptical at first when I read the ingredients, but I ended up really loving this salsa. It really completes the fried shrimp. I made it up to 2 days ahead with wonderful results. To make this less labor intensive, I purchased fresh peeled and cored pineapple from produce section of the supermarket. When I was preparing the recipe I accidentally left out the pineapple-apricot preserves and it tasted delicious. I caught my mistake and added the preserves before serving the salsa to my dinner guests - still delicous. I have to say, however, that I prefer the version without the preserves. I suggest making the salsa without it, then taste and see for yourself whether you think you'd like some extra sweetness. The pineapple I used was incredibly sweet, so that might have to do with why I felt the salsa didn't need the preserves.

This was a grand addition to the coconut shrimp! I have also used this on a baked ham and pork chops which came out amazing! it's the perfect blend of sweet and spicy but just enough to tickle the senses!

This was AMAZING!!!!!!!! Followed the recipe exactly. Although I was skeptical after I mixed all of the ingredients (onion taste was strong), after chilling it for about 2-3 hours, the tastes came together beautifully. Not only will I make this again, I'll probably just keep it in the refrigerator. Made it with the coconut shrimp which was also excellent. Even my husband liked it and he's Mr. fried chicken and microwave popcorn.

I've made this with the Coconut Fried Shrimp at least a dozen times. I always get rave reviews. This salsa also goes great with grilled white fish like snapper or Cod.

Everybody goes nuts over this. We serve it with spicy grilled shrimp, and the flavors complemet each other beautifully.

This is incredible (and incredibly easy!) My only substitution was to use mango spreadable fruit in place of the pineapple/apricot jam. I'm thinking of using this in combination with my wild rice salad (cook wild rice with a chicken boullion cube, and white rice with lots of chopped garlic, cool and combine with chopped scallion and slivered almonds. I add a touch of tarragon white wine vinegar and olive oil-that's it!) and some black beans for an island inspired salad!

This is a great salsa. Try using mangos with the pineapple. We love it.

I've used this several times and also put it on chicken and fish using the coconut recipe. Fabulous and easy. Last time I made it without the apricot but added diced celantro, mint tea leaves and diced sweet green pepper and it is still fabulous.

THIS SOUNDS LIKE A SIMPLE RECIPE WITH A TOUCH OF ZIP!! YES I WOULD LOVE TO TRY IT, & MAKE IT AGAIN!

Nice flavor! Had a really ripe pineapple, so our salsa was quite liquidy, but that didn't really matter. Subsitutions because of what was on hand: 1/3 fresh lime juice, 2/3 fresh lemon juice; 1 tablespoon chopped serano chilis instead of the jalapeno. Really fresh tasting.

This recipe has become a staple in our house.

This is the perfect accompaniment to the coconut-crusted shrimp. I substitued crushed pineapple which allowed for easier topping of the shrimp. I also used my homemade apricot preserves instead of the apricot-pineapple preserves. Highly recommend this to you.

This was very tasty on the Coconut Shrimp. I substituted canned pineapple, which was fine.

Fantastic, just use apricot jam

This has a wonderful flavor even with my what-I-had-on-hand substitutions. I used canned pineapple chunks (in juice, drained)and fresh nectarines to sub for the fresh pineapple, and plain old apricot preserves to sub for the pineapple/apricot preserves. I served, as recommended, with coconut fried shrimp, but found the combination to be too much sweetness for one meal. To the leftover salsa (better the next day) I added more jalapenos and some black pepper and served with grilled pork chops. THAT was a delicious combo. My husband even put some on his ham sandwich. I'll serve it again next time I make ham, chops or maybe bratwurst. Corned beef? Fried chicken? This stuff is good enough to build a meal around!
