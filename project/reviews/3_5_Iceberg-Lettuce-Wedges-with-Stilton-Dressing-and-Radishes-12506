A classic restaurant blue cheese dressing. The yogurt makes it creamy and less fattening.

Typical steak house recipe type of blue cheese dressing. Good, but not great.

It was a good dressing but too much of a good thing...blue cheese. Overpowered the simplicity of the salad. I think there are better blue cheese dressings out there.

Sinfully easy and delicious. I served it with "Balsamic and Tomato Roasted Chicken" and "Whipped Potatoes and Herbs," also from this website. Next time I'll try this dressing with a mixture of butter lettuce and radicchio.

We were looking to copy our favorite steak house salad-this did the trick! Everyone at our dinner party raved about it! We did not include the radishes and we sliced our iceburg in thicker wedges. A wonderful combination with juicy New York steaks.
