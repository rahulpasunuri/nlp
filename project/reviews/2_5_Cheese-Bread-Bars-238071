This recipe was submitted by my sister and, yet, the bars did not turn out well for me. I think, perhaps, the translation from Italian to English measurements may be the culprit. I'll see if I can get some advice from her and post the results!

I thought this recipe was boring as an appetizer with drinks. However, I froze the left over bars, reheated them in the microwave oven and served them with soup one night and a dinner salad another evening and absolutely loved them in this capacity as did my husband. I will make these again to put back in the freezer and pull out as an accompaniment to soups and salads!

Used good quality cheese and found this to be delicious. Definitely a "bar" texture as opposed to bready. Great as hors d'oeuvre or with soup/salad/pasta.

This sounded great but was so dry a whole bottle of wine was consumed just to choke this bad boy down. Do not make this recipe ever!

This is absolutely tasteless and expensive to make. Would not recommend this one.

Terrible recipe. We ate it fresh the same night we made it and it was dry and tasteless. We grudgingly age a little bit and threw the rest in the garbage. A great way to waste of tasty and expensive ingredients, Do not make this recipe!!

I have never made a recipe from Epicurious that didn't have a review, but this sounded delicious. I made these for an open house and doubled the recipe. It was very easy but a bit on the dry side. I did made them ahead and warmed them up 2 days later, so that might have been the problem. They were still quite good. I did find that the measurements for the cheeses didn't match up too well -- cup and pound equivalents. I would make it again, but I wouldn't suggest making it ahead of time. I think it compromises the recipe's taste.
