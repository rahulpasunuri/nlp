We enjoyed this dish but found the pomegranates seeds too labor intensive to eat. Perhaps a pomegranate sauce?

The relish went beautifully over boneless chicken (both dark and white meats), prepared in the way the recipe's lamb chops were. (No rating because I didn't make it as called for.)

Super, was somehow a little too sweet for me. Maybe go a little easier on the molasses or the figs. Does anyone know a good side dish?

this dish was very flavorful and had the healthful antioxidant benefit of the pomegranates.
