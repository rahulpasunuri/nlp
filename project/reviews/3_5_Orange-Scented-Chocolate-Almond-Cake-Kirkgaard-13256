I've been making this cake about once a year since I first saw it in the magazine, and it never fails to win high praise. Sometimes the filling and glaze do not come together as seamlessly as I'd like, but with the flavors involved, I've found that I could drop the whole thing on the floor and people would still devour it.

It was OK. The cake portion itself was quite dry. The filling and frosting were good. I used very expensive high0quality baking chocolate. definitely will NOT make again.

i was a little skeptical when first making this make, due to the fact of the fresh bread crumbs and ground almond instead of flour, but i am glad i didnt change a thing with tihs recipe, my sister and i absolutely loved this cake, it is a restuarant quality cake forsure, my only advice is to allow the topping to set fully before serving as it makes all th difference, i left it overnight and it was the best chocolate cake ive ever had.

When I licked the spoon, I said " oh my!" But the first taste from the finished product was even better. A beautiful looking and better tasting cake than one can imagine. This is the type of cake served in top restaurants for $5/slice.
