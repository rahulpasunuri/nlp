Is your cake dry? Dark pans and glass pans bake hotter!

A great pound cake--very moist and with a beautiful texture. Don't know why some have experienced "dry" cakes. I use a well-greased tube pan instead of two loaf pans.

I have made this recipe 3 times now because I love ginger. Each time it has been dry. I will not try it again.

Made this according to the recipe, froze one and ate one. I loved the ginger flavor but thought the cake was somewhat dry. Defrosted the other cake after 2 weeks to sample it. Again the ginger flavor was good but the cake was even worse, more crumbly and even drier. I'll definitly add ginger to another pound cake recipe, maybe even more than what this calls for.

Anyone who loves ginger has to love this cake. I can't imagine why it has a rating of only 86 percent. The cake is lighter than most pound cake--has a wonderful crumb--and is tasty and pleasant even as it ages. I say ages because the company left and I was the only one left to eat the cake--poor me--and I have one small piece to go two weeks after making the cakes. (The other one is in the freezer.)

Nice ginger flavor but rather heavy, perhaps will follow previous comment about using cake flour, or maybe less all purpose flour, but very tasty.

My only advice is make sure you grease the pans really well, neither of my loaves came out intact. Both went in the garbage.

I made this cake for friends at Christmas and it was so well received that I would like to make it again. For anyone that really likes ginger, this is the best receipe yet.

This recipe is almost identical to one published in Bon Appetit in 1993, maybe 1994, in the October or November issue. I think the original used buttermilk instead of milk, and called for a tablespoon or two of crystallized ginger sprinkled on top after filling the loave pans, in addition to that mixed in the batter. It is incredibly moist, fragrant, tender, and spicy and goes well with Earl Grey tea. In fact, I think the original name was Triple Ginger Tea Cake, or perhaps Tea Loaf. Fantastic! I lost the original recipe and was delighted to find this one. Make a loaf for yourself and one for a special friend. I used to bake them for Christmas gifts. Thanks so much for sharing it with us.

Very yummy. I think I prefer the Lemon-Ginger Pound Cake (also Epicurious), but this is a worthwhile dessert!

Delightful bread. I would ad a bit more ginger - or perhaps another spice.

This is one of the best breads I've made. I used crystallized ginger from the Ginger People--very high quality, soft, with wonderful flavor. I also saved time by using grated fresh ginger from a jar--I didn't notice any difference in flavor from grating it fresh. For Christmas I made them as gifts and everyone is still raving about them. They're great too, since you can make them in advance and freeze them. This recipe's definitely going into my 4-Star file!

Very yummy -- but you have to be a ginger fan to love it. Freezes well, too!

Even though the heat went off in my oven while this was baking, the taste of the slightly fallen loaf was incredibly rich and delicious. I added dried pineapple to the top of one loaf. The loaves were a hit for Thanksgiving dessert and at work a few days later (the loaves do freeze well).

I have made this recipe twice and it just keeps getting better and better. The second time I didn't pay attention to the ginger measurements and just loaded it in, especially the candied ginger. Oh boy, it was so very yummy!
