This was absolutely the best cheesecake I have ever made! Added a little coconut extract to both the crust and the filling to bring out the coconut flavor. I couldn't find passion fruit in the winter, so I bought some passion fruit juice in the Goya section of the grocery store and thickened it up with the gelatin. It looked beautiful and tasted heavenly.

Not rating as I haven't made yet. If you are looking for passion fruit purée, you can get it at large liquor stores, frozen in a quart container. We use it for a passion fruit salad dressing ( on this site- fabulous!)

This is a truly amazing dessert! After reading the reviews, I added 1/2 tsp coconut extract to the filling. I also made extra topping- 1 tbsp water, 1/2 tsp gelatin, 3/4 cups passion fruit puree, and 4 tbsp. sugar, let set 4-6 hours. Made the crust two days ahead (wrap after cooling), filling one day ahead, glaze the morning of my dinner party. I almost swooned when I tasted it, as did all my guests! One of THE best desserts of all time!!! AloHA!

Ever make a recipe that's so delicious that you're sure it will be at every holiday table from there on out? That was this recipe for me! Everyone agreed that it was the best cheesecake they had ever eaten. No joke! That's the good news! The bad news is that i'm too poor to afford real passionfruit... and I don't have the time to go searching for them. So, i kinda tweaked the recipe and cheated. a. Due to the reviews on the cheesecake not being coconutty enough, i used frozen shredded coconut. (much fresher and more coconut flavor) One bag of frozen coconut gave me about 1 1/2 cups of coconut, so i added the dried stuff to it to meet my 2 cups recommended. since frozen is not as sweetened as dried coconut, i increased the sugar on the crust to 1/2 cup. I was also confused by the graham crackers (definition of "whole graham crackers"? Like the entire sheet or each individual perforation?!) so I used one full sleeve of cookies (1/3 of the box). I baked it 16 minutes. b. I added 1 tsp of coconut extract to ensure the cheesecake tasted coconutty too. c. Here's where the true cheating starts. I didn't have time or $ to hunt down passionfruit. So, I bought a jar of Mrs. Miller's Passionfruit jelly. (usually at amish stores) i threw the whole jar into a food processor and added Monin's Passionfruit syrup for added taste and thinned consistency. I poured it over a cooled cheesecake. Drizzled it with white chocolate and refrigerated overnight. YUM. That's all I can say... YUM!

Wonderful, silky cheesecake! I changed a few things up: I used ginger snaps instead of graham crackers and seeing that everyone had a hard time finding passion fruit this time of year, I used goya passion fruit nectar instead. Then, instead of the compote, I made the frozen banana bites and placed them around the bottom and top edges of the cheesecake. People loved the bites and the look! Still a tropical feel and very, very easy.

Crazy good. We used frozen passion fruit with no problem. Much easier. Next time, I think I will use a water bath to prevent cracking on the top. The texture of the cake is lighter than some cheesecakes. It is very rich. Small piece goes a long way. It is great for a crowd.

I made this following the crust and filling recipe to the letter, but used chocolate ganache for the topping instead. I was going for a Mounds bar flavor and it turned out pretty well. The filling, although very creamy and nice, really had no flavor of coconut at all, I could only taste it in the crust. I used the Goya brand of creme of coconut, not sure if that had anything to do with it, maybe next time I will try Coco Lopez. One thing that annoyed me was how much filling I had leftover. I used a standard 9" springform pan and still had alot left. Not a big deal, but it's wasteful and I'm just not sure why a 10" pan wasn't recommended. This did bake up perfectly though, I've probably never made a more beautiful cheesecake, not a crack in sight. So overall a very nice creamy cheesecake, but if you're really going for a strong coconut flavor, I would add some extract.

I live in Hawaii so we have plenty of fresh passion fruit this time of year. It was a nice complement to the coconut. I had to use more gelatin to get it to set though. This is the first time I cooked a cheescake using this baking method and it's the first time I didn't have huge cracks in my cheescake. I'll cook all my cheesecakes like this from now on.

I found fresh passion fruit at Central Market. However, they were $2.99 EACH! Given that you needed 10 for the recipe I decided to use frozen passion fruit puree instead which I found in the frozen fruit section. It worked like a charm. It also cut down on prep time considerably. The brand was The Perfect Puree of Napa Valley. I made the compote about an hour before I served the cheesecake and together it was divine! It was a wonderful alternative to the usual chocolate dessert.

I too am having a tough time tracking down passion fruit. I've been looking for passion fruit puree, too, and can't find any without having to ship it. I'm thinking of trying this with a mango glaze instead.

It's odd that this would be in the December issue when passion fruit isn't even in season. I called every grocer I know in DC and couldn't find any fresh passion fruit. Any substitutes anyone can suggest?
