Simple recipe and a good basis for a great brisket. I will make again, but as other suggested, I'd embellish the existing recipe- probably add some crushed garlic and some herbs. I bet this would be a stand out with Vidalia onions. Served with roasted potatoes, carrots and beets seasoned w/ salt and pepper and EVOO.

This is a great recipe! I served it for Hanukkah and my Jewish friends thought it was as good if not better than their own.

Attention one forkers: recipes are a loose guideline and generally toned down to the mass palate which demands blandness. Make it your own! Because as a jumping off point, this recipe is STUPENDOUS. Liberally season that meat (I can imagine you with a little spoon in your hand making sure it only gets that 1/2 t of pepper, and not a crumb more), not to mention patronizing a quality purveyor. Embellish! I added thyme, garlic and red pepper. On a technical note: if you plan on a long braise, up the beer and bump the temp down to 300. And don't disturb that top layer of onions. It makes the dish. Served mine with fresh pappardelle pasta and peas. Still salivating at the thought the next day.

I love this recipe, and it has been a big hit with my family and guests. I'm wondering if the reviewers who found it bland or tasteless used a good cut of meat? Some seem to have skipped the porcini bouillon cube (available at Italian specialty markets) and/or the balsamic vinegar. Both ingredients give this recipe its special oomph!

Absolutely delicious! I was cooking 8 lbs of brisket for a big party - used much more salt (kosher) and freshly ground pepper than was called for, and the brisket got a really nice crust in the browning process. I used 2 cans of light beer and one can of dark beer, 4 bay leaves and a good scoop of beef "better than bouillon". No vinegar. I braised it covered for about 4 hours and let it rest for another 45 min. Absolutely perfect brisket!

I find this recipe to be easy and flexible; I recommend trying several different kinds of beer to find the one that best suits your taste; Sierra Nevada Pale Ale is good for this, as is their Summerfest. I wouldn't use an IPA or anything else that's too hoppy, as some hops don't seem to go well with the other flavors here. I also used Montreal Steak Seasoning instead of salt and pepper, and I like to throw in more bay leaf. This a solid basis for braising beef, but it isn't spectacular without some experimentation.

I made this with a 2 pound brisket, started in the oven then finished in the crock pot. My whole family loved it. I plan to make this again

Great recipe. I did add lots of whole smashed garlic cloves with the onions AND being I cannot phathom brisket without potatoes.. I added two cut up potatoes halfway thru. Awesome

Based on the all the great reviews, I thought this was going to be great. It was tender, but it had no taste, my family couldn't eat it. I followed the recipe, it should of had a richer flavor.

Did not live up to the other reviews, in my opinion. Perhaps because vast majority of the people that come back to review the recipe are usually those that loved the dish. I generally find that if a dish stinks, people are generally less likely to bother with a review. I could be mistaken, but that's my theory. I did like that this was extremely easy to make, however, the flavor was rather bland. It smelled terrific, however the biggest obstacle for most cooking is bringing the taste of the food up to the level of the aroma. Overall, simple to prepare, but simply bland.

I've got this in the crockpot right now. Smells AMAZING! Just curious if the beer should be brought to room temperature before adding it, or if it's okay straight from the refrigerator? Just curious if that affects teh cook time or not, especially in slow cooker...

This is now my standard brisket recipe. I used a darker beer (Shiner Bock), and it worked fine...

I rated this 4 forks because it's exceptionally easy and tastes great. I subbed a package of frozen onions mixed with green, yellow, and red bell peppers and added two sprigs of fresh rosemary. It was good when I snuck a piece on Saturday, but the flavors did improve today.

I'm in the middle of making it, so I can't comment yet. But I'm wondering why not use dark beer? I'm trying it with stout.

I made this almost exactly as written, but cooked for 8 hours on low in a crockpot. Everyone loved it, but I would make the following recommendation: reserve 1/3 of the onion mixture (or make extra) and add to the pot during the last hour of cooking. In the slow cooker the onions cooked down to the point of being indiscernible. They would have added nice texture and visual appeal.

This was melt in your mouth delicious! Cooked Monday night and left in fridge for the recommended two nights and cut and heated last night for dinner - it was heavenly. Will certainly make for guest - it will impress!

Excellent recipe; a big hit at our "Eastover" dinner. Found that there was alot of liquid and onions after braising, so before serving I pureed them, reduced the mixture by half, and then heated the meat in the gravy. Next time I will do this in the slow cooker, as I think it will be even better.

This turned out fantastically, my husband and I loved it. We halved the recipe and used a lager for the beer. An easy, delicious recipe.

Holy COW this was good!!! Super EZ recipe, which I followed to the letter except: I used beef short ribs, which I cooked in my Crockpot on low, for 5 hours. We couldn't wait 2 days & instead, devoured this immediately! Of course, I skimmed the sauce of excess fat 1st. I can't wait to try this again, but with brisket next time. And of course, I'll cook it in the Crockpot again which - in my humble opinion - is THE best way to braise meat.

This was very good on a cold winter night. We used the leftovers to make french dip sandwiches using the sauce for the au jus and also adding a slice of pepper jack cheese. They melted in your mouth! Since the brisket was large, half of it is in my freezer. Next time I make this, I think it will only be for french dip sandwiches!

Very good and very easy - made it in the crockpot after browning the meat and onions on the stove. I too used Boddington's as one other reviewer suggested - very tasty! I tried a little bit the same day as I made it, and I think it was just as good then as it was reheated two days later. A keeper!

The one time I tried to make a roast I failed miserably. This recipe was so easy and the results so tasty that my confidence level has been restored. I have made this several times (once for Christmas brunch) to rave reviews. I too added garlic to the onions. I have to say that the pot you use makes a big difference. I have settled on using my Le Creuset dutch oven as that has yielded the best results.

The beer added a nice touch..it smelled gorgeous! Do get a more marbled piece of brisket as the leaner(as I chose) was a bit stringy. Served it with roasted potatoes and carrots.Husband enjoyed it.

This recipe is the best brisket I've EVER had -- ridiculously easy to make and incredibly tender, fragrant and delicious. Made it for a dinner party -- guests ate every scrap and pined for more, begged me for the recipe! Far better than my mother's brisket, and that's saying a lot. I used a round dutch oven so the beer amount was fine, but if you use a low baking dish you might need more. Fantastic -- FIVE forks!

I bought a full brisket and baked it in an electric roaster out in the garage. Based on all the previous comments and suggestions, I made sure there was plenty of beer to cover it and, since I didn't have any onions (unforgiveable, I know), I used Pacific brand organic French onion soup. The smell was heavenly, the meat tender, and the cleanup a breeze--lined the roaster with foil. Because of the size of the brisket and the amount of liquid needed for coverage, there was lots of broth.

Coming to the end of winter and looking for new ideas I tried this as it was similar to one in my crockpot recipe book. Definitely a keeper as the onions and mushroom (review recommended) make a more complete flavour than just using the beer. "Tui" brand of course.

Brisket came out awesome. I, like others, added another bottle of beer mixed with an additional beef bullion cube. I made it for company and everyone loved it. Next time I will add some garlic. Will also try adding bbq sauce.

This is not your typical BBQ basted brisket but the flavor was exceptional and it was very easy to make. At the end there was no extra sauce and a few pieces were a little dry. It was well received by a dinner club.

Awesome recipe as is ....... naturally, adding garlic is a must. Cooking without onions & garlic is like trying to paint a picture without colors. As noted, this dish is even better when prepared 2 days prior to serving.

My husband and I love this recipe. I have made it 3 times in the past couple of months and it has turned out great everytime. I did add garlic to the onions --- and instead of boullion used my mom's favorite standby, Lipton Onion soup mix. The recipe is easy to follow as well so a first time cook would be able to do this with little problem.

Very good brisket--tender and flavorful. I added mushrooms during the last 45 minutes of cooking and as suggested by previous reviewers, studded the meat with garlic and added a cup of broth. The broth made tasty wilted greens as a side dish.

This was an easy recipe. The flavor of the beer should certainly be a consideration in your recipe. I used Fosters and the strong flavor comes through in the sauce. Overall...a great flavor and I will do this one again.

I had a 2.25 lb brisket and added an extra beer since the liquid did not come 1/2-way up the meat. I baked it at 300 for 3+ hours a day ahead of time and then sliced it cold and reheated it. It was very tender (no knife required) and quite tasty. I'm looking forward to the sandwiches!

Rating: 3
Very easy dish! I actually only used a half a brisket (about 2.25 lbs) and used full amounts of ingredients for everything else - so I had no problems with dryness & the beef was falling-apart tender. Didn't need to add liquid during the cooking process at all. Sauteed the onions in garlic-infused oil, next time will try studding with garlic as recommended. Could the type of beer make a difference? I used Boddington's... so I could slurp up the extra :)

This recipe went over very well. I cooked the brisket for only three hours and it was soft and tasted great.

I followed the recipe, used my reliable Le Creuset dutch oven, and cremated many innocent onions. The liquid clearly needs to be adjusted for long, slow cooking. rescued meat with slow beef broth bath, and subsequent reseasoning. Flavor was fine...will try again. It just wounded my pride a little, as I'm a fairly experienced cook.

This was very easy and very delicious. The meat was very tender. I was concerned because my beer was skunky but the end result tasted fine. In response to other reviewers' problems with dryness I added a cup of mushroom broth instead of a boullion cube.

Maybe it was the shape of my pan (the Calphalon Everyday pan) or maybe the lid isn't tight enough or maybe my oven runs hot. Whatever it is, I used a bottle of beer for a 2-pound brisket and the liquid evaporated and the onions charred to a crisp. The meat itself is fine, if a little dry. I'll have to try this again to pinpoint what went wrong.

I made this in the crock pot and it was very tasty. A definite keeper. I did thicken the gravy with 3 T of cornstarch (in a slurry) about 1 1/2 hours before serving. No problems with dryness in the crock (4 hours on high, 6 hours on low).

I've made this a couple of times and it's pretty darned good. Certainly making it ahead of time is a great convenience for entertaining, and it is easy to cut up when cold. It's also quite nice as an open-faced hot sandwich on some good toasted french bread.

I followed the recipe pretty closely (subbing hard cider for the beer and studding the thing with a head of garlic) and think it the best brisket I have ever had, much less made. Anytime I see brisket on sale, I will be making this up. (And enjoyed eating it so much more when I didn't have to worry about cooking it that night!)

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! The meat was so tender, but I must admit I did add another bottle of beer half way through.

This is excellent! Very tender and flavorful, though we did have to add more salt. I bought a whole brisket and made the flat half for company one night and the point half for super bowl Sunday. The point half I did in the Crock Pot which worked out well. I couldn't find "porcini bouillon" so I used veggie bouillon I had on hand and threw in a few dried shitakes for flavor. I also added some chopped garlic cloves. Served with crusty french bread: YUM!!!!

Turned out "ok" but not great; not really worth making again. Didn't have any problems with dryness, but I did let the pan cool a bit after browning the onions & before adding the beer.

While this was not the best I have ever made, I like being able to make it 2 days ahead. I did not have any trouble with it being dry or the liquids evaporating. Next time I will add more onions.

everyone should try this recipe! I can't make a roast to save my life. This brisket is sooo good! I really think you HAVE to make it one or two days ahead because their is so much fat in it by the time it's done. I cooked two 41/2 pound briskets side by side in a roasting pan for 31/2 hours. When I reheated I added some aujus to the sauce to strech it and to thin it.

Did it to the letter and the beer evaporated immediately. There has to be something else added in the form of liquid. Has potential to be good.

I have not yet cooked this dish myself but had it at a friend's house and it was fabulous. Couldn't get over how simple it was compared to so many of my other brisket recipes. Am trying it tonight!
