Filling was good, however a little dry without ice cream. Perhaps about 1/3 cup water or juice would help. Did not like bisquick topping. I prefer old style,(1C flour, 1/2C sugar, 1 1/2tsp baking powdwer, 1/2tsp salt, 1/2C milk, 1/4C softened butter) is much more cake like: not biscuit.

This recipe was excellent just the way it is. We used Tapioca instead of cornstarch, and it worked well,

Blackberry cobbler is my favorite dessert, and this recipe is one of the best i've ever had! The lemon and lemon zest absolutely steal the show, cutting the tartness of the blackberries and really making this recipe a standout! There are lots of great blackberry recipes here - but do yourself a favour and make this one!

Super easy and super delicious. I've tried other recipes where I don't need to use Bisquick and they don't turn out as well. This is a fool proof recipe.

I just made this for a pitch-in dinner/bbq and got rave reviews. I took a que from the Cook from Atlanta and used half cinnamon and half cardomom each time the recipe called for cinnamon. Also, I used 1/3 raspberries with 2/3 blackberries. This is a keeper recipe!

I've never been a big dessert person, but this was amazing. It wasn't too sweet and preserved the natural blackberry taste. My whole family keeps asking me to make it again!

Made this tonight, we thought it was quite good, but a little short on sugar. The next time I up the sugar to a half cup or so. I followed the technique of baking the biscuits completely separately from the blackberries so the pastry cooks all the way through. Then I placed the biscuits on top of the berries while they were still hot, just out of the oven. It allowed the biscuits to absorb some of the berry goodness without that icky doughy undercooked mess that often results from cobblers. Yum!

I am not a huge fan of cinnamon so substituted cardamom. Very good!

I have made this recipe twice in the past 4 days and my guests raved about this dish. i purchased heart smart bisquick mix and added 1/3 whipping cream and 1/4 cup buttermilk. This turned out YUMMY! This is a keeper.
