So I took a different approach with this recipe based on reviews. First, I used goat cheese, secondly always cook the mushrooms or they get watery on the pizza. Also, the first time I made it, I had no time to make pizza dough and could find premade, so I rolled out puff pastry. Was delish and there wasn't so much as a flake left.

Mmmmmh, mmmmh, mmmmmhh, mmmmmmhh, mmmmmmmhhhh this it the BEST pizza you will ever taste!!! Make sure to use Boursin cheese, it won't work without it! And be ready to become your entourage's favorite chef! if you make this once, they'll want to be invited for dinner over and over and over again :)

I had high hopes for this pizza. I've been on a caramelized onion pizza kick lately and all but this one have been fabulous! Unfortunately, I think that using the 7 x 12 dish instead of just rolling out the pizza onto a baking sheet resulted in an overly moist, too-thin crust that proved very difficult to remove from the dish. The onions were fine; not terribly flavorful -- I prefer making them with a little brown sugar and red wine vinegar. The mushrooms came out fine, too, and I did not cook them a little first as suggested by others. The Boursin cheese...who had the idea that this can be crumbled? It is a very soft, spreadable cheese. I ended up scooping it onto the onions and mushrooms and having to mix them up in order to evenly distribute. I definitely will not make this again, and will stick to my own caramelized onion, mushroom, and crumbled goat cheese pizzas.

I've now made this recipe three times and it was fantastic. Guests loved it every time.

This was excellent with the following alterations: I made my own pizza dough and added some fresh garlic and dried rosemary to the dough. I also used more onions and probably double the mushrooms over what the recipe calls for. I also sauteed the mushrooms first before cooking the pizza. Sprinkled some dried red pepper flakes, dried oregano and dried basil. Final touch of some good e.v. olive oil and a sprinkling of quality pecorino romano once the pizza comes out of the oven.

This was OK for a one-time meal, but I wouldn't make it again. I absolutely agree with the previous reviewer that you need to cook the mushrooms first and not put them on the pizza raw; otherwise too much moisture gets into the raw dough while it bakes. Also, I used slightly more mushrooms than called for, and it was still not enough given the extent to which they reduce in size. The overall effect of the pizza was dry and doughy. Leftovers, by the way, didn't work out well because the Boursin completely dried out and turned hard.

The pizza dough does not cook properly if you use raw mushrooms.... My wife made this and followed the recipe... I would suggest cooking the mushrooms in a pan on low to moderate heat for 10 minutes you can get much of the moisture out. I then add a splash of vermouth to the mushrooms and cook for about 5 minutes longer. Spread the cooked mushrooms over the carmelized onion, then finish off as the recipe indicates...

I tried another reviewer's suggestion to use puff pastry. This produced disappointing results in my opinion. More mushrooms are needed since they shrink during baking. Since the boursin does not melt and spread, be sure to distribute it well.

Fabulous recipe. I used 4 onions and didn't have too much. Also great when done on puff pastry...

This was wonderful! Served it as an appetizer with my own pizza dough and there was nothing leftover.

A KEEPER!! We made this tonight and really liked this a lot. The carmelized onions are wonderful. The boursin makes a perfect link between the sweet onions and earthy mushrooms. I used more mushrooms than called for, maybe 10 ounces total. Even though they were good, it wasn't necessary. I also added some thinly sliced grilled chicken breast on half the pizza (starving tonight). Rather than using a pan, I slid the pizza off a peel onto a baking stone in a 550 degree oven. The resulting thin crust was crisp on the bottom, and tender where you want it to be. To the previous reviewer who asked about a good brand of pizza dough, consider making your own. You can make a couple of batches of dough at a time, and freeze balls of dough for later. Just let it thaw during the day and you'll have 'fresh' homemade pizza that evening.

this rocked, and i even used ghetto pizza crusts. was lazy and didn't cook the onions quite as long as specified, but still got good, creamy flavor. for the effort (next to none), this is an awesome dish!

The raw crust problem: Use a pizza or baking stone dusted in cornmeal, put it on the lowest rack of the over and preheat at 500 or a high as your over goes for at least 30 minutes, up to an hour if possible.

The taste is wonderful, but my crust wasn't finished cooking by the time my cheese got browned. And I know my oven is correct. Any thoughts?

Try Trader Joe's pre-made crusts in a bag in the refrigerated section--3 types: wheat, reg and garlic herb....easy to cook and tasty!

I loved this dish!!! Yum! I cheated a little by using a Pilsbury pizza crust from the dairy section and i added a little sugar to the onions. My husband thought this rated two fork - he liked, but didn't love it.

I like the carmelized onion, Boursin cheese and mushroom but the pizza dough was kinda difficult to shape. If anyone has any idea which pizza dough you would use, I would maybe make it again.
