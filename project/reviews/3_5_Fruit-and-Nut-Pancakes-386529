Super great and easy. Bananas make the pancakes moist...but maybe in that, "are these cooked all the way?" sort of way. I'd definitely make again though.

These were pretty good, definitely needed salt and I added about a half a cup more milk since the batter was so thick the pancakes weren't spreading out at all. Next batch I think I'll try adding a little oil, more nuts, and using a mix of whole wheat flour and maybe buckwheat. I really liked the chunks of banana in the batter. I think this in one of those recipes you just need to fiddle around with until you find the perfect balance for you!

haven't tried this recipe, but used y\to do something similar..used some unbleached white flour, not all wheat...did add oil, probably would use coconut oil now...added cooked wheat berries and used apples instead of bananas, then topped with cottage cheese and cooked apples...it was dinner sometimes. (cooked groats would be similar to wheat berries)

Very tasty. This is a nice alternative to some of the other pancake recipes I use, and it was not too sweet, so you could really appreciate the syrup on it. I used a mixture of gluten free, rice and buckwheat flours and it all came out well.

By far the most naturally delicious pancakes I have made. Omitted almond nuts and extract. Used vanilla extract to replace. Used vanilla soy milk and added 1/4 tsp salt. I only mashed the banana into the batter (didn't top with sliced) and used fresh organic blueberries. Added 1 tbsp of chia seed for additional nutrients! Batter came out thick but mildly sweet and delicious! My 16 month even ate it!

I substituted the regular flour with quinoa flour and didn't add the oats (I wanted it to be gluten free). I put in a full teaspoon of ground almonds, and didn't put in almond extract (I did put in the sliced almonds). Instead, I put in a teaspoon of vanilla extract. I used soy milk instead of almond milk, and put in a teaspoon of canola oil, according to the recommendations in the reviews. I actually did like the banana slices, I thought it was fun to get a slice of banana in my pancake. I also added 2 teaspoons of agave syrup to the batter. The cinnamon can be cut in half. Yum!

My family really likes almonds so these were perfect for us. I added a 1/2 cup more of almond milk, pulsed the 1/4 cup almonds in the food processor so they provided a crunch throughout and that made it easier with the bananas. I agree that the sliced bananas were a little too big for the pancakes and made me wonder if they were underdone at some points. I also used a cup of fresh blueberries instead of mixed berries and they were great. My daughter doesn't like cooked berries and she gobbled these up WITHOUT syrup.

Made these this morning. What they need is salt! A 1/4 tsp. would have greatly enhanced the flavour--they tasted "flat". The almond extract could be reduced to 1/2 tsp. as it was overpowering and a little bitter--could not taste the cinnamon. Yes, the ingredients are healthy and they all taste good but with a few changes this would be a great recipe. I did not add the sliced banana as I thought it would be too chunky but added slightly more berries.

this recipe is not economical, you already have almonds and still you put almond extract, seems very redundant and useless to put almond extract

Had this for breakfast this morning and it was delicious. I substituted a tablespoon of flour for a tablespoon of ground flax seed for extra protein. I also added a tablespoon of canola oil because I was afraid of the pancakes being dry as mentioned in other reviews. Overall, I would make these again, they are very filling and delicious :)

This worked pretty well, and my kids liked it. I did not find it too dry (in fact, based on another review, I used a little extra milk and an extra egg and it turned out too runny). It was a little hard to get the pancakes to cook evenly around the banana slices.

I think this recipe would benefit from the addition of some oil or melted butter in the batter. They're very dry and just adding adding more milk didn't work. Anyone have success with these?

Disappointing results. The batter turned out to be very dry and did not disperse in the pan, making cooking them thoroughly difficult. The almond taste was also very strong. All in all, I wouldn't make them again.
