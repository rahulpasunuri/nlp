It was good, but as usual, I think restaurants leave something out when they share a recipe. My guess is that they add more cream to this one. I used dry cannellini beans and homemade stock, then simmered a couple of parmesan rinds with the beans. Next time I will leave the beans uncovered as they simmer in the stock because the soup was too thin as written. I ended up reducing it after it was pureed and before adding the cream. I think it would be great garnished with parmesan croutons, and if I were to make it as a main dish again, I wouldn't puree all of it. Some texture would be nice. The pureed version is nice as a starter, though. I have quite a bit left over, so I may reduce it further and top it with lamb ragu or shanks braised in something nice and tomatoey.

This soup really tasted like bacon soup to me. I might try it again with significant adjustments - 1 slice of bacon, and as other reviewers suggested, reduce the broth significantly, and puree only half the soup.

delicious, savory, fragrant - might not need so much broth, more like 8-9 cups; good starter course!

Delicious and easy to make once the prep of chopping everything is done.

This soup was okay, I was not totally impressed. The recipe makes a tremendous amount as well. It was missing something...I cannot but my finger on it. I have been to Brasserie Le Coze so I was hoping for more of a "wow" factor here.

I like this soup blended or unblended. I had a ham bone on hand and cooked that with the soup which gave a nice additional dimension. If you serve it unblended, shaved parm' and chopped flat parsley instead of truffle oil is a good garnish. Blended with truffle oil is very elegant however. A great winter soup either way!

This soup was excellent and more than 8 servings. I used canned white northern beans as I didn't have time for dried. I used 6 cans and I didn't need the whipping cream- the soup after blending was plenty think and rich. Outstanding and easy.

I have made this soup for years and it so delicious! It is a great soup for families with children. My kids love the bacon flavor and have no idea that they are eating so many wonderful vegetables. The only change that I make is by reducing the garlic to 5 or 6 medium sized cloves - 8 can be hard on some stomachs.

I made this soup as written except for the bacon and cream. Next time I think I will use 3 cans of beans instead of 2. ( not thick enough for my taste) I used my immersion blender and pureed approx. 3/4 of the soup as suggested. It's good without the truffle oil but even better with just a small drizzle on top. I have a feeling this soup will taste even better the next day. I used extra fresh rosemary because I like the flavour of white beans/rosemary. Next time i will make this soup exactly as written when I have guests as the cream will kick it up a notch.

Perfect soup for a rainy Sunday - I used canned beans so it was easy and quick. I added some red pepper flakes which gave it some nice heat. I omitted the celery, carrots and tomatos, and cut down on the broth to thicken it up (probably used about three cups). Pureed 2/3 or so in the blender, left enough whole to give it some texture, topped with truffle oil and fresh grated parm. Served with a salad this was a great fall meal - thick, filling and yummy!

This has to be one of the best bean soups I have tasted! I followed the recipe fairly close so I'm sure the taste is the same had I followed it exactly. The white truffle oil is a great match and some grated Parm. garnish would have made it even better.

I have made this soup many, many, times and it still amazes me every time I taste it! Ive made several variations as well as following the original recipe to a T, and I prefer the following changes: use navy beans, use a rich brown chicken stock like kitchen basics if you are not going to make your own, double the carrots, and leave out the bacon and the cream. This is fabulous served thicker as a soup, or thinned with additional broth as a sauce for lamb or seared sea scallops. I love this soup!

I've made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. The second time I made the following changes with great results: Cook the beans 10 min. in pressure cooker, only use 8 C. of stock, leave out the whipping cream, and blend very briefly with an immersion blender, leaving some beans, carrots and tomatoes intact. The truffle oil is a must!

My husband just made this soup. It's a keeper.

I just finished this and I added a tsp of red pepper flakes and it is really spicy. I also read all the reviews and adjusted a little bit. Three cans of beans. Added 3 cans of chicken broth and 2 cans of water and still thought it was a little intense - probably because I didn't add enough liquid, but I like my soups thick. I thought this would come out much thicker ala black bean soup but it's more like broth with vegetables. I pureed half which was a good idea. Served it to a guest and she immediately asked me for the recipe.

It did not taste like the real deal from BLC. Something is missing compared to the original. Still tasty but not a show stopper.

Just OK...until I added a heaping tablespoon of grated Parmesan to each bowl. That did the trick!

The soup was a bit thinner than I expected. Next time, I think I will start with only 8 cups of stock and work from there. That being said, I thought the soup was great on its own; add the truffle oil and -- oh my god -- you have a truly amazing soup!

Did not have bacon so diced up some ham. No truffle oil either. Used 2 cans of northern beans. Pureed 1/2 of beans taking advice from earlier reviews. Used 8 cups of chicken broth instead of 10. Used fat free 1/2 & 1/2. It was still very thin...maybe it will take a while to thicken up. I think I added a little too much fresh rosemary as that's the overwhelming taste. It is very healthy (only a couple tbsp of oil in the whole thing) and flavorful. Maybe it will be better tomorrow.

I've made this soup more than once & love it every time. This time I went for a lower-fat version: omitted the bacon, the cream & the truffle oil (I'm not the kind of cook who would have it on hand anyway or who plans much in advance, which also explains why I had to use dried rather than fresh herbs). I added a diced potato with the beans to provide some thickening. I also followed other reviewers' advice & pureed only about half. Delicious!

This recipe was a decided success. I used the dried beans and omitted the half-and-half. Outstanding! Will definitely make again.

the essense of white beans. it was a bit time-consuming to get the beans soft, but the payoff was worth it. the truffle oil is not nessesary, but did add a nice touch. i thought it was particularly import to repeatedly strain the soup until it was absolutely smooth.

This soup was a great recipe to start with, and then I made several changes. Double all vegetables, double the beans, half the amount of chicken broth. I only pureed 2 cans of the beans instead of the whole soup...made for a nice thick consistency. I used canned beans and it was just wonderful. Also, we like things spicy so I added Sontava (similar to Tabasco) and crushed red pepper. Would definitely make this one again!!!!!

Made this on a rainy cold day, and it was so soothing! I didn't have dried rosemary, so I used fresh and I also used 2 cans of beans vs dried (decided to make it that day). Only suggestion would be if you use canned beans, you will need 3 cans- or if you don't need all 8 servings you can reduce the chicken stock to 8 cups.

Rave reviews from fiancee and guest. (Guest even came back next night for leftovers!). Super easy to make. Will become part of my standard rotation for sure!

Excellent!! Have made this soup many times. I use 2 cans of beans and pour them in during the last 20 minutes. After the soup has been pureed, I add a third can for texture since I love white beans. That's all. The remainder of the recipe is perfect. My husband put a bottle of truffle oil in my Christmas stocking this year so I guess he wants me to make this again soon!

I tried this recipe because we were getting our first snowstorm of the season and I wanted to cook some warm soup and homemade bread on this cold and snowy day. The soup was better than I hoped it would be. Really enjoyable. I made the following minor changes: I had some leftover ham, so I chopped it into small pieces and added it to the soup. Also, I had some leftover mashed potatoes, so I moistened them with half and half and added them with the whipping cream. Altogether, I used about one fourth cup whipping cream and one third cup half and half. Also, I used more onions and leeks than the recipe called for, and I used canned diced tomatoes because I had no fresh tomatoes on hand. I usually put a ham bone into white bean soup, but I really liked this bone-free recipe. My husband rarely comments on a meal unless he doesn't like it. Tonight, however, he told me three times that the food was "perfect."

I made this soup using both dried beans and canned beans - both with great sucess. I also don't puree all of it but leave some beans whole for texture. I also use andouille sausage (chopped)instead of bacon. My teenaged daughter loves it - and that says it ALL!

This was wonderful, following the recipe as it was intended. Perfect flavor, texture, everything. I would suggest following this recipe exactly, or use another one.

Excellent recipe, the smell was tantalizing and the taste was even better. I think it does need work to get the texture just right (add more beans, make sure not to overcook, puree only a quarter to one half od hte soup) but even without the truffle oil (which I did not have available to me) the soup came out beautifully!

Just o.k. As a big bean eater, I've sampled tastier white bean soups than this. The texture was grainy, and the flavor resembled thinned down hummus. Even the truffle oil didn't enhance this one enough for me.

This was wonderful! I used 2 cans of white beans instead of the dried beans (I would use a third can next time.) I also added 3/4 c. of chopped fennel which was a nice addition. I didn't have fresh herbs and substituted dried ones. It was a very good soup...

Excellent soup ! I made my own ham stock from ham shanks and bits of ham. Also added extra carrot for color. Only pureed about 2 cups as suggested by another cook and think this is best. Substituted 2 Tbls. half and half for the whipping cream. Looking forward to serving this soup during the cold Michigan winters !

My whole family loved this soup. I tasted it before I blended with my hand blender (and before I added the cream)and it was amazing. After I added the cream and blended i did not think it was as tasty. Next time no blending and no added cream! :)

In a word, yuck! I love all the ingredients in this recipe, but it did not come together as expected. First of all, you can be there's a lot of chicken stock in this recipe (I wish I'd cut it in half). Also, you definately want to use the low salt stock if you're using store bought. I did the bacon as recommended--cooked together with onions and such. Not only was the texture like it was boiled but it became flavorless. I'd fry the bacon in another pan and put it in later. This was such a dud, I doubt I'll be trying to make it again.

This is the best soup ever!! Don't puree it completely it's much better with about 2 cups of soup pureed and added back in. Very Italian flavor. The truffle oil not necessary, but makes it even more amazing. Left out the cream.

One word: DELICIOUS !! I used ham stock in place of chicken stock and bits of cooked ham in place of the bacon. Omitted the white truffle oil, as I couldn't find any in this town. Better believe the "heavy large pot" directions, as this recipe makes a lot of soup !!

This is really great!! The truffle oil adds so much depth, it's well worth the investment.

Wonderful! No need to run out and get truffle oil. I crumbled crisp bacon and dashed some tobasco sauce on top just before serving and it turned out great. I served as a main course. My husband is not a bean lover and even he loved this dish; ate two bowls. I served with crusty french bread and opened a bottle of chardonnay. Enjoy!
