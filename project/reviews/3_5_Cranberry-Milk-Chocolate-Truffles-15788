These are somewhat of a challenge to make. But the ganache is tasty and is easily modifiable with other dried fruit.

These are an absolute must with my family at Christmas. I make them a bit smaller than it says to because they are quite rich, but they always fly off the dessert table at our house!

I have made these at Christmas time for several years. They always come out wonderfully and everyone loves them and asks me each year if I'm making them again. I also have used different combinations of dark and milk chocolate and enjoyed them all.

This was the first truffle recipe I ever attempted. They came out all right, but I didn't care for the texture. I would try another recipe before revisiting this one.

The cranberries give these an unpleasant texture. Not a recipe for true chocoholics or truffle connoiseurs.

Makes everything else in a box of truffles shine! Not worth the effort.

My new favorite truffle recipe (and i have tried quite a few). Used callebaut chocolate - definitely worth it.

I omitted the butter in the recipe and bumped up the cream a little bit to 3/4 cup. I also used dark bittersweet chocolate and added a little triple sec to the cream as it was scalding. I call it the "Cosmopolitan Truffle" (like the drink!) Don't ever be afraid to wiggle the recipe a bit! I also rolled these in cocoa and used cherry flavoured Craisins - they are fantastic! (They also make orange flavoured Craisins, they would probably be nice too!)

I loved these, even though I used craisins instead of unsweetened dried cranberries, which I couldn't find. I also coated them in 70% cocoa dark chocolate since the milk chocolate I tried to use melted too thick and gloppy.

I thought the recipe was incredibly easy. My only problem was getting the candy into uniform balls. The cranberries made it the perfect combination of sweet and tart. I did splurge on chocolate but chose Callebaut instead of Valrhona. I personally liked the smooth flavor of the Belgium chocolate instead. Definitely an addition to this years Christmas baking.

Thank goodness! I made these as alternatives to the old Godiva standby. They saved me 20 bucks last Christmas and I have my friends and family begging me for the recipe.

Time-consuming (start-to-finish is 2 days), messy and finicky. Having said that, they are unique and a delightful change from the usual cloying sweetness of regular truffles. I don't find the cranberries tart at all - just a nice bite. I used Lindt dark chocolate for the coating, but I would use semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate next time. I found the chocolate coating too thick, which made the truffles odd shapes because I couldn't shake off enough excess - thinning the coating would help. It would be a 4 if it weren't for the logistical problems.

A very nice recipe, the tartness of the cranberries is subtle and blends well with the milk chocolate. I did use bittersweet chocolate for dipping, and the added layer of flavor was intense! I might puree the berries with the chocolate mixture longer next time, they were a tiny bit gritty.

These were delicious and easy to make. I splurged and bought the Valrhona chocolate, which was very rich and creamy. I think they would also be good with a dark or bittersweet chocolate coating. I gave these as holiday gifts and people were very impressed!

I made these truffles as gifts last year and everyone is asking for them again this year. Out of all the holiday candy I make, these truffles are a hands down favorite.
