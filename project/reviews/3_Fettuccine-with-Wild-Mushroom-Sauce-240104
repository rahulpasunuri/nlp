I have made this a few timees with some modifications; I add a quarter cup of white wine at the end and cook it down for a few minutes; then if I have some heavy cream a shot or two of that is good to add some yummy richness to the dish. Last night I had some mascarpone in the fridge and put a couple of spoonfuls in the end--the best addition yet!

This is by FAR my favourite mushroom sauce! As suggested by a previous review i substituted shallots for the chives. The flavour of the mushrooms was subtle, and delicious. Will definitely make again!

Horrible. Relies too heavily on mushroom flavor without offering much substance. I could not finish my plate, and I threw away the remainder.

Fan-freaking-tastic! I should start off by saying that I don't normally like mushrooms, but I LOVED this dish! The flavors were all wonderfully balanced. Just the right amount of garlic seeped into the mushrooms during the cooking process, and gave them an intense flavor that complimented the earthiness of the mushrooms. Even the texture was great (which was my primary reason for being anti-mushroom, until this recipe). MY boyfriend thought there was too much cheese (what???), so he left me to eat most of the leftovers. Darn. ;-)

This is a very nice recipe and very easy to prepare. I added minced shallots as recommended by one of the other cooks. I will definitely include this in my regular rotation of recipes for my family.

The best use of wild mushrooms I have found. Simple, elegant, doesn't overpower their fabulous flavor. Used shallots instead of chives since I had them, put them in when I sauteed the mushrooms. Added more zest and lemon juice because the pasta needed more acid. Lightened up on the butter slightly. This is the first recipe I have seen that doesn't try to over-flavor the mushrooms with herbs or thyme, which to my mind kills their delicacy. Sublime. And easy - some chopping, a little sauteing and dinner!

I didn't know mushrooms could be so yummy! This is a great intro into the world of nicer mushrooms and wasn't too difficult.

My comment is not on this recipe, but the one for home made pasta. I make pasta at home all the time, and it always turns out great. The whole process takes less than 30 minutes. I think the great lengths that are described in this pasta making recipe would turn anyone off from making their own pasta. I suggest to follow the directions on the pasta maker, which for me is 2eggs 1 1/4 cups of flour, mix well, knead for a minute or 2, let sit for a few mintues, roll out, cut, and then either hang to dry or lay on floured surface for at least 15 minutes. Boil for about 2-3 mintues ... and there you go!

As a mushroom lover, this recipe is terrific...Be sure to strain the liquid from the dried porchini mushrooms as there can be some grit.

This was a delicious early fall meal. Next time I will try to make it a little healthier by decreasing the amount of butter and oil and increasing the garlic and mushrooms a bit, since I'm a big fan.
