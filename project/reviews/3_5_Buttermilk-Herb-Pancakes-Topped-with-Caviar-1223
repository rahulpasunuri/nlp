This is easy and lovely. It LOOKS really beautiful when assembled, and is mild and interesting in taste. Definitely make smaller pancakes. Also, couldn't find creme fraiche so used sour cream and it was quite good despite my fears that it wouldn't be.

We made this for a New Years dinner a deux, and it was spectacular and incredibly easy. used dill as the herb since we had it around - perfect. it made 16 pancakes, so we froze the extras. I think they would be good with creme fraiche and smoked salmon also.

The basis for this recipe is very good. However, my husband and I had some problems with some of the ingredients. The lemon/creme fraiche didn't work for us, and the caviar didn't work for him. We made another batch with the following modifications: Definitely make pancakes smaller, we agree with the other reviewer. Additionally, use good old sour cream topped with minced scallion (green part only!) and then sprinkle with chili powder. It gives it the kick the original recipe was missing. Yummy!!

Quite an interesting appetizer. Maybe I would decrease the size of the pancake (although my husband thought it just right for folding over) to make it bite-size. The combination of tastes are exquisite.
