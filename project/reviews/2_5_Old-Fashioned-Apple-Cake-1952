This is a very nice recipe and works well with two adjustments, which might have been in the original recipe and somehow lost in translation: first, if you don't bake with whole wheat flour often, the flavor gets sour after a while (not a problem our grannies had) also, if you bake it in a springform pan which has a tube in it (like an angelfood cake tube pan)it takes care of the problem with the center being uncooked.

I wish I had read the other reviews before baking because the center was almost uncooked. I also didn't care for the taste of the wheat flour. *If* I make it again, I'll use white flour, add cinnamon and bake it much longer.

This is a staple recipe for my family. You do need to cook it longer, but it is a wonderful, moist, easy to make cake.

The center never cooked through even though I baked an add'l 15 minutes. Also, I could taste the grittiness of the sugars. They must not have disolved in the batter.

far too much baking soda which combined with the cloves left a rather unpleasant aftertaste - the cake also took twice as long to bake as mentioned in recipe (even when using white flour)

A very easy cake to make. It might need to be baked a little longer than recommended. I've made it many times -- it truly is an old-fashioned apple cake - plain and simple.

I have always made this with plain, rather than whole wheat, flour, but it's a great, simple, easy cake, best eaten warm but still good cold. I have already made it a few times - it's so fast it's an easy cake to make every week. Good with cream or vanilla ice cream.

This cake had the oddest flavor Maybe it was the whole wheat flour but my family really disliked it Its presentation was very nice and held up well in the springform pan. It did not cook in the very center (raw dough) using the recommended amount of time. I was going to try to play with the recipe to fix it but I think I will just look for a better apple cake.
