I have made this dessert for Christmas Eve dinner for several years and it is always a hit. It can be made several days in advance and it always turns out beautifully and is delicious. I use Edy's Peppermint ice cream to simplify the recipe but any ice cream would work.

Absolutely delicious! Used peppermint ice cream instead of vanilla and had no need for additional candy or extract. Will definitely be making again many, many times.

This is a fantastic dessert. I can't wait to make it again. We made our own peppermint ice cream. Also, I would omit the ganache completely, as the crust is sweet enough. In fact, the crust was a more dark chocolate flavor, while the ganache was just too sweet on top of this already very sweet cake. I also thought the ganache crust made the cake very hard to cut well. Make it, you will not be disappointed. We will be using this recipe in the future and trying new flavors, like a coffee chip ice cream set in this crust.

Really excellent recipe! The original version is great - everyone loved it for the holidays. But my son loves black raspberry ice cream and it was delicious with the chocolate crust and glaze. Have used chocolate graham crackers instead of the wafers and they work great. Second time making this, I sprinkled only cookie crumbs in the middle. Mixing them with the chocolate makes it hard to cut.

I made this for Christmas dessert 10 years ago and my dad couldn't believe I made it. So I decided to make it again in his honor this Christmas. This is an excellent dessert. I didn't have a 9 in springform pan, so I used my 10 1/4 in springform pan and added a little more to the recipe. It turned out delicious, but a sliver goes a long way. It is rich and refreshing and a great holiday desert. I put half of the peppermint oil in (accident) but thought it was perfect and everyone at the table loved it. Lots of steps, but easy to make, no artistry needed. Oh yes it was beautiful too.

I have made this cake at Christmas for several years running now. I threaten to switch to something else every year and every year my family threatens to disown me. It IS yummy and very easy to make. It's a crowd pleaser and it screams holiday. What more could you want?

Be careful not to let the crust get too thick when you press it out into the pan or it will freeze too tough to eat. But, in general, this is an excellent cake, and not at all hard to make.

I made this cake for Xmas dinner and it was delicious. It was very rich and the crust was very hard. I goofed and made it in a 8" springform instead of the 9" it called for. I agree with other reviews that the crust was too much and too hard to cut. I will make this again with a few changes. Use the correct pan size :), omit the chocolate from the crust, omit the crust mixture from the middle layer and use less ganache in the middle layer. One reviewer also suggested peppermint bark for decoration and I will try that variation also. Also, I didn't think to use my electric knife to cut but will definitely use it the next time and there will be a next time. It is a beautiful cake and perfect for the holiday season

The cake was good but I felt that the glaze made the cake very rich, the next time I make it I will just put the glaze on top of the cake and not in the middle layer.

I used Brighams Peppermint stick ice cream, 5 oz of chocolate in the crust, and doubled the ganache. I found that it was difficult to put the crust up the sides of the pan and the crust crumbled when I cut it. I also wouldn't use all of the ganache if doubled, I thought the layer on top was too thick and rich. Time consuming, not incredible.

First time I made this I served it plated in a swirl of deepest dark chocolate sauce for my Mother in Law's BD. She loves peppermint. Well I over did the peppermint by accident. Although good just to strong. BUT I didn't want to throw it out. After careful consideration I put the the leftover 3/4 of the cake on a bread board and took a cleaver to it. Chopped it up into pieces and then folded into 1- 1/2 qts of fresh home made vanilla ice cream. Uh....this rendition has become my family favorite. Very, very good.

I made this for Christmas Eve @ my house. My entire family went nuts over it. Added extra vanilla ice cream to the mix, as I didn't have enough. Still had a very nice peppermint taste to it.

Unbelievable! I wasn't sure I could pull it off, but I found it very easy to make. I used Blue Bell's Peppermint ice cream to save time. I did have to double the ganache amount (the recipe amount only satisfied the amount for the filling), but it was so easy to make, I didn't mind. Also, couldn't find chocolate wafers, so I used a whole bag of oreo cookies but it still wasn't quite enough to completely cover the sides. But no one knew because it still looked gorgeous and the taste was to die for. It was a huge hit, and I can't wait to make it again with different flavors and toppings!

Wow!! This was FABULOUS!!! I followed exactly to recipe, my family LOVED it for our holiday desert!! Very refreshing to have even after a big meal. I used a very thin knife to cut and had no problems as some of the other reviewers noted. Time consuming to make with the wait/freeze times, but very well worth it....will definitely make again!

This "cake" is just to die for! It is my very favorite combination of flavors and if you don't want it for Christmas dessert, don't have Christmas with me! I have taken to using haagen dazs low fat ice cream when making my peppermint, and it is just fine.

Even though I made a huge mistake, this cake was to die for! I searched all the ice cream cakes on this site and picked this for my birthday dinner dessert. I read the recipe wrong somehow and bought peppermint ice cream, AND added half the peppermint extract b/c it was all I had left. I made everything else right, so when we tasted it, it was very pepperminty, but still delicious! Everyone was sneaking seconds the whole night, so by the morning it was gone! So you can't go wrong with this recipe. I may try different ice cream flavors, but I loved it w/ the peppermint ice cream - give it a shot! (But don't add any extract!)

Rating: 4
I will make this recipe for as long as my family can endure it! The only thing I would change is to use sweet cream ice cream as opposed to vanilla. It should allow for more of the peppermint flavor to shine through. Enjoy!!!!

I made this cake for a holiday party and it was very popular. Despite the fact that I am a sugar fiend, it was actually a little too sweet for me. I made one layer with peppermint candy ice cream and one layer with vanilla (both purchased). I will definitely make this again, but next time will omit the candy on the top and maybe stick to vanilla with some peppermint bark mixed in. The best part of the cake was the presentation; all my parents' friends were incredibly impressed with how pretty it was!

For those of you having trouble cutting the cake, try making the crust with becel margarine and little or no chocolate instead. I have an ice cream cake recipe that uses this and it works wonderfully. I tried butter and had the same problem.

I thought this was very good, although not great. I am a true chocoholic, and i thought there was too much chocolate and not enough ice cream. I did not listen to other reviewers and cut down the chocolate in the crust, a handsaw would have worked well! I bought peppermint ice cream. Was very easy, although time consuming to wait for each layer to freeze. Nice presentation with the ganache on top and crushed peppermints.

This is a perfect seasonal cake (december). Delicious and it makes people happy. It is very easy to make although it is almost an all day affair with the waiting one hour twice and four hours once and then overnight. I used only 4 ounces of chocolate in the crust as was suggested and had absolutely no problems with cutting the cake, in fact I wonder what was going on with those that did run into so much trouble with the cutting. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy cream and sugar instead of the corn syrup (1/4 cup). I did add more chocolate and 1/2 and 1/2 then what was called for to extend the amount of ganache because I clearly wasn't going to have enough to cover the top otherwise. Also, I used chocoloate chip mint ice-cream because I couldn't find peppermint, which is too bad, but it wasn't any less delicious I am sure.

Rating: 4
This recipe worked perfectly and looked beautiful! It was a hit at our family Christmas dinner last night. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used only 4 oz. of bittersweet in the crust. At the last minute, I also decided to do one layer of pink peppermint ice cream, and the other layer of green mint chocolate chip ice creat--it was a great festive touch and tasted delicious. I ended up getting 16 (thin but good for a large meal) servings from this cake.

This cake has become a Christmas tradition in our family. Everyone looks forward to desert after a long day of celebration. It makes a fancy New Years desert too. Although it takes time to make it, it is worth the effort! Have the coffee ready!

I would definitly suggest using an electric knife. It cuts it sooo much easier and faster! It looks beautiful and makes a nice presentation. Also, I bought Edy's Peppermint Ice Cream and then put it in my mixer and mixed it to make it soft and spreadable. Much easier than waiting for a 1/2 gallon to melt.

To the cook below about the glaze on the sides...it is the crust you see on the sides in the pic. You press the choc. crust into the entire pan. I made this for Christmas Eve last year - people freaked out over it! My cousin (who is a dessert guy) said it was hands down the best dessert he's ever had. They all couldn't believe that I didn't buy it from a restaurant. BTW - I made it with vanilla ice cream on top layer, premium chocolate on the bottom layer. Making it again this year - can't wait, YUM!

I've been reading the comments about soft ice cream and hard crust and I'm wondering if the problem might be that folks used a premium ice cream? These tend to be designed to be very soft... I can't get access to it online, but Cook's Illustrated did an article about melting times and compared various brands in "Slower Melting Ice Cream" in their July 2003 issue. If you're curious about what they had to say, perhaps your local library has a copy...

I have a question. How does the glaze get on the sides of the cake? In the picture the sides are glazed but if the glaze is getting poured on top of the cake while it's in the springform pan, it wouldn't get on the sides. Am I missing something?

Rating: 4
If you like peppermint and chocolate, you will love this. We made it for Christmas last year and it was so addictively good, we couldn't help but gorge ourselves. We had a larger springform, so we just increased the recipe and it worked great. We couldn't wait till the end of the day so we could eat it -- it lasted for days with only four of us and the rest of the desserts all went forgotten. This is truly one of the best desserts ever.

I just sent this recipe to my friend, for her annual holiday office dinner. I told her it was easy and fun to make, great presentation, and it tastes fabulous, too.

After reading all the review of this recipe, we were hesitant. However, borrowing an electric knife enabled us to cut this cake easily and it came out perfectly! We did not change a thing and everyone RAVED about it. We did have to dip the blades in hot water after a few cuts. And it EASILY served 18 people. A great make ahead recipe for a holiday dinner!

I made this EXACTLY as written for Christmas Eve dinner and as with many of the reviewers, the crust was just too hard to cut and I think overwhelmed the cake. Less overall crust and definitely less chocolate in the crust would result in a better balance of textures and flavors. It's a great taste but can be easily duplicated by pouring great chocolate sauce on peppermint ice cream!

I also made this recipe from the magazine last Christmas. It served over 20 adults. Everyone loved it. In fact, they've requested it again. This year, I'll try cutting down on the chocolate in the crust but will double the ganache recipe because it's soooo fun to taste!

What a winner! I have made this recipe twice--the first time as written and I found the crust very difficult to cut. The cake itself was beautiful, but it turned into a mess when I tried to serve it. The second time I made it, I left the chocolate out of the crust and just made a cookie crumb crust using boxed Oreo cookie crumbs, sugar and butter. I was also running short of time, so I just made a single layer cake and I cut the total ice cream used to 6 ounces. It turned out great--lovely to look at and much easier to serve. I will definitely make this one again!

This is one of the most scruptious cakes ever. The first time we made it we had to use a 10" spring form and increase the proportions, I think it made enough for about 30 people. Now we want to try altering it, maybe coffee ice cream with crushed chocolate covered espresso beans. Yum!

Rating: 4
I reviewed this once before, but I just wanted to make a suggestion to make it easier to cut...I use my chef's knife which I run under hot water for a few seconds, then dry it and cut...the heat of the blade helps get through the layers of chocolate and ice cream. You might need to heat the blade a few times.

My husband has always loved the combination of peppermint and chocolate and this was a huge hit in our family.. My 9 year old devoured it as well. I used peppermint ice cream as other reviewers suggested and had to double the ganache as well. This will become a holiday standard. It would be great with any ice cream really!

Rating: 3
I also found the crust a bit solid to cut but very tasty. I cut down on the chocolate in the crust a bit to make it softer and tried to make as even and thin a layer as possible. I also didn't use peppermint and substituted chocolate chip and vanilla ice creams for the two layers. Very delicious.

Rating: 0
The reason the crust becomes hard is because of the addition of chocolate. In my opinion, eight ounces may taste great, but is way too much. Reduce the amount to four or even three ounces, and the slicing won't be such a problem.

I concur with the other cooks. It was beautiful before cutting, but it was a struggle to make pretty servings. I substituted Edy's Peppermint Ice Cream to eliminate one of the steps in preparation. We liked the flavors together, but it was a rather labor intensive recipe.

This cake was great. The presentation was not what I imagined it would be. Mainly because it was very difficult to cut. I would thin out crust, middle and top ganache layers to make it easier to cut and to cut down on the extreme richness. Also I would cut it in in the kitchen out of view of guests - to take the pressure off.

Rating: 2
I agree that the taste of this dish - and the overall concept - is excellent. But the presentation of it is a problem. My husband and I were also trying to chip the crust apart in order to serve it before the ice cream melted. Not that everyone didn't absolutely love it - but I like my desserts to look good too! I think the suggestion to serve it the same day is a good one. Perhaps some of us have our freezers set colder than others - who knows - but inferior ingredients were definitely not my problem (as suggested previously).

I made this recipe twice. The first time with 2 X the glaze as suggested. The ice cream was melting and the chocolate layers were rock hard. That one went in the garburetor. I tried again with a single recipe of glaze and less chocolate in the crust. I was so embarassed. 2 of us were chipping away at the solid crust with knives while my husband scooped the soupy ice cream up with a spoon. The ice cream tastes great, the rock hard cookie layer does too but together this is a disaster. I used the best ice cream and the exact amount of chocolate wafers.

Rating: 4
Had this for Christmas dessert..everyone loved it. Just a note for future reference...make a little extra ganache..my springform is a 10", so I just made a little extra at the last minute. But even with a 9" it wouldn't hurt to have more for the middle. It is wonderful. Not only would I make it again..but can't wait for another family get-together to try a different ice cream. This has just about trumped my cheese cake which has been a holiday staple for 30 years!

Rating: 2
YUM! But, a bit over the top...a bit too sweet and a bit too rich. One pie should probably feed about 20 people! (Like another reviewer, I ran out of glaze and to make a second batch, too) Eat this pie the same day as made. Although the pie was still edible the next day, the crushed candy canes did melt into the ice-cream and were gooey, runny and soft by the next day. Next time, I think I'll cut the filling ingredients and make a smaller pie...but I do think there will be a next time. It was a seasonally appropriate FUN dessert.

Oh my gosh - this was the greatest...it was our Christmas Eve dinner dessert with leftovers at an impromptu dinner party 2 days later...everyone RAVED! I'm making it again for New Year's Eve party.

Also, for those of you having trouble slicing - I periodically dipped my knife in hot water - took care of the problem.

If you are having trouble with rock hard crusts, or not enough crumbs, then you are doing something wrong. Try following the recipe as it is; don't substitute hard cookies, such as chocolate graham crackers or teddy bears! Yes, the wafers are expensive, but that is part of the choice of making a dessert such as this. If you don't have enough of the crumbs, then maybe your pan is too big or you made the wrong amount! Use a 9" pan as the recipe instructs. I am looking for a great dessert for about 60 high schoolers for a fancy New Year's dinner, and I think that I found it in this winner! Also, you won't have soupy ice cream if you use decent ice cream and allow it to freeze properly. There really are no shortcuts to be taken in this recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it extremely difficult to cut - I tried various knives, wire, and floss without much success. If it softened enough to cut easily, the ice cream oozed. I found myself wishing that I had just provided the peppermint ice cream alone.

Rating: 2
I really don't like to give an unfavorable rating however as with the last reviewer I ran into the same problems, the cookie mixture on the bottom sides and center layer became rock hard while the ice cream melted very quickly. Cutting it completely destroyed the look of it, bowls were more appropriate than plates for eating. The taste however was delicious. I used a premium vanilla ice cream however if I were to try this one more time I would find a nice peppermint ice cream with the hopes that it would remain firmer. My thought is that maybe in softening the vanilla enough to mix with the peppermint it never became very firm again when put back in the freezer.

I made this cake for our Christmas Eve dinner and it was a huge hit. The mystery of the "chocolate wafer" called for in the crust was solved with Chocolate Wafers by Nabisco, which come in 9-ounce packages. I found you have to work quickly with the chocolate glaze - it solidifies when it touches the cold icecream and it can be hard to spread. This cake was beautiful, easy and delicious.

im not exactly the greatest cook, but the recipe was pretty simple. i used the wafer cookies, but ran out and ended up having to take some from the filling. I was so worried about the whole ice cream thing that I ended up over freezing the whole thing. The only downside to that was the crust was REALLY hard. Also, as a novice cook, I ended up having to make more icing then instructed because i ran out! it was still a good eat in the end!

This is the best!! This was a big hit at two of my Christmas parties. I used McConnell's Peppermint Stick Ice Cream (Made in Santa Barbara, CA)...one of the worlds finest. Can be purchased in So. Ca. I also doubled the chocolate and used more crumbs....One fine recipe.

What an absolutely FANTASTIC recipe! I made it for my hubby's birthday last night and he loved it. The only thing I changed was to use LIGHT Peppermint Ice Cream, and it still tasted great. I was able to find the chocolate wafer cookies - but they were really expensive - $3.50/box! So, this ends up being an expensive cake, but worth it at the end. I also had to double the chocolate ganache and didn't have quite enough crumbs to cover the sides, but it froze well anyway (and kept its form even without a complete crust). Defintely would make again. It took a long time, especially making sure the ice cream was the exact consistency to spread.

Kids and adults loved it. I used chococlate wafers and didn't have enough crumbs for crust (so I stole from the center layer). I doubled the glaze cause I wanted good top coverage and a thick fudgy middle. Used a local peppermint stick ice cream and added extra candies. Decorated it with mini candy canes in center and Hammonds mini puffs around the edges.

Made this for my daughter's birthday party, and it was a hit. First time to make ice cream cake, directions were easy. Only things I did different was to use chocolate graham crackers instead of wafer cookies for crust and used already made peppermint candy ice cream (locally made brand). Next time I'll make a little more chocolate glaze, didn't have enough to cover the top--scattered more crushed candies on top to compensate. I think this would be good with coffee ice cream, too.

Rating: 4
wonderful dessert. Do start a day ahead as there are a few steps but worth everyone of them. I think the crust needs a bit more cookies as I didn't quite have enough for an almost 3 inch high side. I will definitely make this for Xmas dinner this year. Everyone loved it.

This will go in my favorite recipes file. My husband, who doesn't particularly like peppermint ice cream, absolutely loved it. My daughter couldn't get enough of it. I am making it for a second time today to bring to a dinner party. I did not crush peppermint candies but since it is the holiday season, most stores have peppermint ice cream. I used Edy's and it was wonderful. So much easier than crushing peppermint candies. I also eliminated the peppermint extract. Otherwise, it was five stars.
