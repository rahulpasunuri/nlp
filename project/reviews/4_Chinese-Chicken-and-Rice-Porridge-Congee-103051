Wonderul comfort food. We enjoy this hot steaming soup in the Fall and Winter months more. I begin with chicken stock that I have in the freezer and then add the rice to it (must be long grain rice). When it's almost ready, I add some good quality lump crab (in place of the shredded chicken) and swirl it around until heated, then top with thinly sliced ginger, green onions and a few drops of sesame oil over top. I've even used 1/2 of a can of crab in a pinch. The term "porridge" is a misnomer since this is more fluid than a thick porridge consistency. My daughter prefers her congee thicker and just cooks it longer and even adds slices of chinese sausage or cut up duck. Delicious!

I should've listened to my mom and doubled the recipe, because it was gone by the end of the night! I also cheated and replaced 4 cups of water with 2 cans of chicken broth instead of using a whole chicken (just used 2 chicken breasts for meat). I also used short grain rice, and I liked the fluffy texture. Love this recipe and there's ways to cheat and make it even easier, lol.

The ultimate comfort food, as many have already expressed, is exactly how I sum it up. I have been sick all week, and this was the only thing I craved to warm up my tummy. The canto tradition seems to be, to cook it until all the rice grains have dissipated. I quite like a fusion of the canto and teo cheow way, that is to cook the rice with pork mince stock and century egg, but to to not overcook the rice grains. In addition to chopped spring onion, coriander and pickled relish, I also love putting in bean sprouts - adds a nice crunchy texture. Yum yum! Also, like one of the other reviewers, I stumbled onto this site when my mum wasn't picking up her phone!

Congee (jook) is the ultimate comfort food. My favorite way to have it is to add thin slices of lean pork and preserved duck egg, instead of chicken. The lean pork can be cooked with the rice, and the preserved duck eggs, which are already cooked, can be added in slices in the last ten minutes of cooking. Adding the preserved duck eggs too early will make the congee sticky! You can get preserved duck eggs at almost any Chinese grocery store. Congee is also a great way to use leftover rice.

I made this in my new pressure cooker and it took less than 20 minutes! This is the best comfort food. Also perfect for indigestion, hangovers, or a winter cold.

Though the texture of congee is not appealing to many, it's real comfort food for me. The wonderful thing about it is its versatility - you can put anything in it - from pickled vegetables to dried scallops, any sort of (specialty) meat or just leave it plain. i really enjoy this chicken version (with extra ginger) plus mushrooms, as well as serving the congee plain with thin slices of raw fish (which will cook in the heat) plus cilantro. great stuff to warm the soul...

I've been looking for years for a recipe for rice porridge that would be as good as the restaurant versions I can't get nearly often enough. This is it!

made this for the family after a recent bout of food-poisoning. To the effects that it served this purpose, it was perfect: bland, comforting, nothing to upset an already tender tummy. I would not make this for any other purpose though

My mom used to make rice porridge for us when we were kids. It is very comforting - mild but filling. We spruce it up with a dash of fish sauce (found in Chinese stores), a sprinkling of fried onions, and green onions as well as something called tong chai (I am sure the spelling is wrong) but that is phonetically how it is pronounced. It is a preserved radish, I believe and comes in a brown earthenware pot, also found in Chinese stores. I searched for this recipe as my Mom wasn't answering her phone and was pleasantly surprised to find it! This site is great

This was a wonderful mid-winter comfort meal!

I did the slow-cooking part in the crockpot. 1 hour on high, 2.5 on low. Perfect!

i also agree that this recipe is pretty authentic and traditional. you could also consider adding other ingredients (e.g. preserved egg, peanuts, etc.) that are often found in classic "jook".

This recipe is very close to the way I make congee (which my family calls 'jook'). It sounds odd, since it's classified as a porridge, but think of it more as a very thick soup. In my family it's traditional to eat it sprinkled with minced green onions, chopped cilantro, and a few drops of sesame oil. It it precisely what I crave when I'm feeling under the weather or need comfort food. Be patient with the cooking of it. It's very, very simple to make but you must cook it on low and let it cook forever - until you can no longer differentiate between grains of rice. Delicious!
