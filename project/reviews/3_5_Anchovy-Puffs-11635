Simple and perfect for cocktails. Of course canned anchovies are too salty...rinse them, silly.

I like fish and I like salt but these are way to salty and fishy even for me. not good at all. the only person i could get to eat them is a human garbage can.

This was excellent and so easy. These were great appetizers ready in minutes. I think next time I might try adding a little cheese, such as feta, for added pizzaz.

Have made this several times and it is always a winner! Have tried several variations and all have been great.

Made this for a party and couldn't keep them on the plate. Didn't tell people it was anchovy and they loved it.

This was okay, but we like the Prosciutto and Gruyere Pinwheels on this website much better.

First off I have to admit that I LOATHE anchovies, however I do enjoy what they do for a real ceasar salad. Keeping this in mind to the mix I added garlic that I roasted and topped the puffs with freshly grated parmesean cheese. Outstanding and even the rest of the hairy fish haters enjoyed them.
