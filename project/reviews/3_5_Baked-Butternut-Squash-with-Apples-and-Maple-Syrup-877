This was delicious, festive and a huge hit on a Thanksgiving spent with friends. Instead of currents, I used fresh cranberries. The Cranberries and a bit of tartness from the apples helped to offset the sweetness from the maple syrup. It was gone during the first serving and everyone asked for the recipe!

Using basmati rice as a base, I had the completed recipe as a main dish. The rice was a very nice complement to the sweet squash and apples. The squash was a bit too mushy for me to serve to my family at Thanksgiving; they probably wouldn't like the texture. My husband had no comment whatsoever, which usually means that he didn't like it.

This was wonderful. I made for Thanksgiving. Instead of currents, I used about 1 1/4 cups fresh cranberries. Added beautiful color and a little tartness to offset the sugar from the maple syrup.

I had squash & maple syrup. I had plums but no apples. So I used the same amount of sliced plums as the recipe calls for apples, about a half-cup syrup, 3 Tb butter & 2 Tb lemon juice. Delish!

I've made this twice and got plenty of rave reviews. The second time, I tweaked it a little. I used dried cranberries instead of currants. And, because I was making it a day ahead, I tossed the apples in the lemon juice then added what little lemon juice was left to the sauce. I also added 1/2 tsp lemon zest and 1 tsp orange zest to the sauce. The little extra snap is nice.

We had this last Thxgvng when we were out of town, and we all loved it--even my son who wouldn't be caught dead eating squash. The cook used a bit less syrup and butter. I had thirds as I asked for the recipe. Don't overcook, it was just slightly crunchy which was a part of the charm. Will serve with cornish hen with garlic and lemon from this site.

This is quite simple and very good. I used dried cranberries, which was a tangy substitution and good with slow-cooked pork.

This dish was good! My party of six loved it, and one or two thought it was fantastic and wanted the recipe. A very nice complement to the thanksgiving meal.

This recipe was well received by my friends and family: I used very tart apples, and didn't think it was too sweet. Also (since I'm trying to get protein into my squash loving son), I topped with some toasted nuts and pumpkin seeds.

This recipe is a wonderful replacement for sweet potatoes for a autumn dinner. I loved it and so did my guests!

Good recipe; served it with braised lamb chops to a pleased dinner party of eight. I cooked it in our convection oven instead, reducing cooking time to thirty-five minutes. Because of its sweetness, I recommend ending with a semi-tart dessert; we served fig custard terrines.

Every one I served this to wanted the recipe and then made it for them selves. I add some currents or golden raisins sprinkled acorss the top - a friend tried dried cranberries.

I just tested this out on the family in preparation for thanksgiving and it was a real winner. For the person who said it looked like goop, I can only assume that he or she overcooked it as nothing could be further from the truth.

Ok, I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving...made it last night, and re-heated before the meal. Did everything exactly as the recipe stated. I couldn't serve this! It looked like baby poop! I was very disappointed, especially considering how difficult it is to peel thosed darned squash!

This recipe has become a holiday must-have for my family. We are all tired of sweet potato with sweet goo & this is a very tasty alternative.

This year, by everyone's request, I'll be making this recipe for the third time for Thanksgiving dinner. It looks beautiful and is enjoyed by all. Microwaving the squash for a minute makes the peeling a bit easier.

I made this one year for Thanksgiving! It was the hit of my meal. I lost the recipe, I'm so glad I found it here!!

I wasn't crazy about the taste, but to be totally fair I have to say I didn't serve it with the right accompaniments. I probably won't make it again.

I made the day before for a office pot luck lunch. The taste was fine, but the color of the apples after sitting overnight was not appealing. Also had to much liquid in the bottom of the dish. I believe a squash and apple maple syrup puree would be better.

Certainly improved on the second day. I wouldn't add the lemon juice next time.

Wonderful dish. I made it for a party and it got very good reviews. I would recommend making it one day ahead so the flavors can meld together. I tasted it the night I made it and it was 100%better the next day.

I made this dish a number of times last season and plan to again as fall rolls in again. I have never really followed the recipe though. I am not a fan of nutmeg so I omitted it. I just cut up what squash and apples I have available, drizzle with some maple syrup and dot with a bit of the butter. This is really very much like a dish I have made for years which is just apples, maple syrup and butter sauteed in a pan. Never needed a recipe for that either. I also would like to mention that this is a very pretty dish to serve.

Made this twice. Need to peel squash well, add more spices and syrup, and cook longer so its tender.

Much too sweet, and too much liquid in bottom of dish. Others seemed to enjoy it, however.

Although the preparation is a little time consuming, especially with the squash, the end results more than made up for it. I successfully substituted cranberries for the holiday season and it came out beautifully. The real maple syrup is a nice touch. I had many non-squash fans going back for seconds. Even when baked again as left-overs, it was great.

I am a huge fan of butternut squash simply baked with a sprinkle of brown sugar and butter and wanted to try something different. Wow. This dish is like candy - delicious! I made it as a side to Brisket with Portobello Mushrooms and Cranberries and the dried fruits tied the two dishes together well.

A delicious recipe! We served it to 42 people for Thanksgiving dinner, and squash lovers and non-lovers alike gave it a rave review!

I made this dish for a holiday potluck, ham and turkey were the main dishes and I tell you everyone (well almost) raved about it. It made great leftovers. TIPS: It was a little labor intensive though worth it and one must be sure to peel the outter skin thouroughly (I found a few tough pieces because I hadn't peeled enough! Overall very yummy! Especially if you like sweet potatoes.

This was excellent. I used a combination of raisins and cranberries. i wuld use more cranberries next time. They added an nice tang and looked pretty.

Great dish - my in-laws loved it! Used dried cranberries in place of currants - thanks for the tip. Also, my grocery store had pre-peeled and seeded butternut squash halves, making the job simple.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone liked it. The flavors were wonderful, but I think I dried it out a little by baking uncovered the entire time. Next time I will bake it covered for a portion of the baking time to help it stay moister. Definitely make ahead -- it took me forever to do all that peeling.

I'm taking this dish to every holiday party this season. Everyone loves it and, if there are any leftovers to take home (a rarity) it slices into a cold dish that I like even better. I used dried cranberries and currants and ignored the amounts called for in the sauce. Just kept adding more as it cooked over the hour. Delicious!

I also made this for Thanksgiving. It was excellent. I added 2 cups of fresh cranberries that I cooked in 1/4 cup of sugar for about 4 min. I then added it with the rest of the ingred. It made it very colorful and went well with Thanksgiving. This dish was enjoyed by all.

To make squash peeling easier: I use a "Good Grips" potato peeler. It works very well on butternut squash and is the best peeler I have used.

This is a delicious and beautiful dish. My only complaint is that peeling the squash got to be painful. Is there an easy way?

Outstanding. Simple prep and out of the way for an hour while its cooking. Used the same oven proof container I boiled the squash in for the baking eliminating a pan for later cleanup. I reduced the recipe for two by using half a squash with one apple plus half the other ingredients. We also eliminated a starch with our meal with this dish.
