Am I crazy or are the directions in step 3 incomprehensible? I'm no novice to the kitchen, but I've never heard of a pipe being used in cooking! How did the rest of you do this step?

I had been searching for a recipe for lemon/dijon/mayo sauce or dressing to have with carpaccio, based upon the wonderful Hearst Ranch beef carpaccio served at Cafe Roma restaurant in San Luis Obispo, CA. The sauce in this recipe is very nearly, if not exactly, the same, and it is perfect with carpaccio, rare beef, crab cakes, spinach salad, etc. It is soooo simple and soooo good! Tossing a few capers over the finished product is excellent as well.

This receipe is great but 1/4 cup is lots. I cut it in half
