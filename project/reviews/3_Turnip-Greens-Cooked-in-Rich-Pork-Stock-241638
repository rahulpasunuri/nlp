Well, there were only two other reviews, hardly a trend. But I have to say -- these were about as boring and bland a dish as one could possibly imagine. The "pot likker" SMELLED divine, but there was no flavor, and in the absence of anything else, one was forced to salt and pepper assiduously. We all ate them -- we could see how good for us there were -- but for my money, a waste of time and carefully picked (turnip/collard/kale) greens.

This Easter, I served this dish to our family and friends from the south, and they couldn't get enough of it. I just used the Trader Joe bags of chopped southern greens for cooking. So simple and healthy! Even lukewarm vegetable eaters will like these greens. They went well with the whipped sweet potoates and ham. Three pounds seemed like a lot, but they cooked down considerably and were are gobbled up fast. Use fresh ground black pepper and sea salt. Divine!
