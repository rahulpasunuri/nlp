OMG. Melt-in-your-mouth, fall-off-the-bone, tender, slow cooked lamb+tangy, smooth sauce+refreshing dill= taste bud heaven. Great recipe, I ate it with rice instead of orzo but it was still delicious. It makes a lot of sauce but the sauce tastes great. Nice and filling

This is a terrific Greek dish. I served it as the main course for a Greek themed dinner party. Just fantastic! The avgolemono sauce is the best. I served it with Greek Lemon Potatoes also from this site.

Loved this easy recipe. I only change one thing. The sauce was not thick enough for me so I added another beaten egg. Also, I didn't have dill on hand so I used mint. Great dish for a dinner party because it can all be made ahead.

I particularly liked the sauteed zucchini flavored with dill. I used whole lamb shanks and overall I was surprised at how easy this dish was to make. My husband is Greek and he liked it very much. I know we'll have it often.

Excellent way of cooking the lamb shank. I wasn't as happy with the sauce, kind of bland. I have made my own sauce since, using the defatted juices and reduced with red wine.

I did the lamb with mint and thyme instead of dill. For veggies I did roasted red peppers and zucchini and kale. I didn't add any zucchini to the avgolemono, but it was still delicious (especially on the orzo - this is a lovely summer sauce for pasta). All in all, this dish was a hit.

We do not like dill so we omitted it.This is a great recipe for company(or yourself),It is easy to prepare and fantastically delicious.The only changes I made(other than the dill)was a little lemon thyme(I grow it)with the zucchini and I blend the zucchini/chicken broth mix before I add the DEFATTED drippings from the lamb.It is a great dish!
