This is a great snack. It was my very first time carving a pumpkin, so I found this simple recipe for toasting the seeds. I toasted the seeds as I was making dinner, so it didn't take constant tossing and stirring as I cooked in medium heat and when they were done, I added a teaspoonful of butter and some salt and pepper and they turned out great. Quite addicting. My husband wasn't really fond of them growing up, but he said he really likes them now...

I discovered the seeds are less woody if you let them soak at least 3 days in water. I did this originally as a way of separating the goopy pulp which takes some doing. I'd soak, drain in a colander, pull whatever goop off I can, then put the seeds back in a container covered with water. I might change the water 1-2 times each day. Make sure they soak in a refrigerator or they will spoil. I'll roast them in an oven 250-275 for several hours on a cookie sheet with a bit of oil, stirring occasionally. After an hour or so I'll try them every now & then until I think they are ready. I just season with salt. The soaking & slow low roasting gives them a bit of lightness. Now to go back & finish carving that big mahoumah punkin.

I always baked my pumpkin seeds but wanted to try this recipe. It is a lot faster than baking and really good smoky taste to the seeds. I added the oil and sea salt, very tasty.

simple and scrumptious. I added cayenne for a kick.

This is very simple. I too had baked them in the oven in the past. However, it involved a lot of tossing and stirring to get them to evenly cook. With a large heavy skillet, you can toss and evenly toast these. Furthermore, adding the oil and the sea salt (very important, table salt will make them too salty.. kosher is a good alternative) in a large bowl after cooking makes them perfect. Don't cook them in the oven again.... the oil adds relatively very few calories per handful.

Haven't tried this yet but just wondered. If it lasted more than a few minutes how long would it store for and how would I store it?

You can also add cumin dust or cayenne pepper for a spicy/savoury touch. Alternatively, you may want to add a bit of fine sugar and cinnamon. I've used different oils in the past for a subtle change in flavor. The seeds are quite good for you - enjoy this healthful snack!

I have been making this since I was a kid! I usually bake the seeds for 20 min., and forgo the oil. Not very fattening at a little more than 1 calorie per seed.
