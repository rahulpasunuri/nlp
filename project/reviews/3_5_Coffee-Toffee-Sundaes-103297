Delicious. I served this with Butterfinger ice cream.

It was fun to make and delicious! I did feel the sauce was a little sweet.

I made just the sauce and poured it over vanilla ice cream. Mmmm... If there's any left (!) we'll try it with the coffee ice cream and toffee bars. I liked the sauce best at room temperature -- it's a little too runny when warm.

Not only do you not need the toffee chips, you don't even need the ice cream. This sauce is so good you will want to eat it straight out of the jar.

The coffee-caramel sauce is delicious. It is good enough that you don't even need the chocolate-covered toffee.
