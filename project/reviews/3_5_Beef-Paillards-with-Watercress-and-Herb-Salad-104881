We made this recipe after following the suggestions from A Cook from Chicago, IL in 2003 and it was wonderful! The mint made it special and the rest made it good enough to go in our "special" recipe book of family favorites. We served it with a mango, red pepper, green onion salad on the side with a Thai style dressing.

If your herbs are fresh, there's definitely no lack of flavor. A good wine pairing took it to another level... enjoy it with Brut Champagne!

This dish lacked some flavor. Here's a few things I would do to improve it. After you've pounded the beef try marinating it for a few hours in some soy, fish sauce,and a little brown sugar. Then go ahead and cook it. Also, I would add some scallions, a dash of sugar and a dash of fish sauce to the dressing.

Wow. With this dish, you can enjoy the richness of beef without it being a heavy, sleep-inducing binge. I will certainly make this again.

Quick, easy and delicious. The salad as a great flavor and the beef is flash cooked to perfection.

I don't eat much beef, made this with chicken paillards, wonderfully tasty, low-calorie, no chloresterol and took only minutes. It will become a summer regular for us, and should be sensational with grilled swordfish.

This was an excellent dish. We chose to accompany it with a a few sauteed mushrooms and a serving of soba (buckwheat noodles) dressed with a little sesame oil and tamari sauce. All told, a Vietnamese-Japanese fusion which we're looking forward to repeating. Next time we'll add a bit of wasabi to the noodle dressing.
