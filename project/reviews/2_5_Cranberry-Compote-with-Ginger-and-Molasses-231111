Made this without the shallot and added pineapple juice and raspberries. I served it over a ginger/maple chicken, and it was INCREDIBLE!!! A hit with my husband who doesn't even usually like cranberry sauce! A+++

Hate it or love it! Next time skip the shallot and reduce sugar to 1/2 cup. Try again, and again, until you will discover the complexity of this delight.

We loved it!! The molasses really complimented the brown bread stuffing.

This is a savory side and not at all sweet. I used dark instead of light molasses and it is wonderful when paired with a sharp cheddar.

Served on Thanksgiving this year - everyone loved it! Very easy to make; I made it 4 days in advance and it kept very well.

Light Molasses taste was overpowering. It sounded better than it tasted.

Served for Thanksgiving, still feeling sorry for all of the guest who choked it down.

This actually was very easy to make and tasted pretty good...then I added the molasses. Yuk! Must be an acquired NE taste thing. Maybe a little frozen orange juice concentrate might be a better addition. It is also too strong a flavor with the turkey and dressing featured with this recipe.

I agree with the other reviewers - this was horrible and landed in the garbage can. Cranberries cost $10 a bag here in Austria so the waste as well as the taste gave me a stomache ache.

I also made this, tasted it and tossed it in the garbage disposal. Yuck. Don't even consider this. Not sure how it got into the magazine!

Made it, tasted it and threw it away.
