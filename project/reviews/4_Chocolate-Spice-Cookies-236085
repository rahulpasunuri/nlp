These were great..even reduced sugar by 1 tbs (could do a bit more) and added 1/4 tsp more salt. Dressed up a bit for customers by dipping in powdered sugar before baking and/or topping with a sliced almond. Highly recommend!

My absolute fave for the cookie tray - and everyone else's, it seems, too! I ended up making two batches this year and am tempted to make one more to use up the applesauce. This is my third year making them - a keeper!

Really fantastic, a little salty though.

Yum...my new favorite cookie recipe. Soft, chewy, quick, easy, simply the best!

So a perfectly chewy, moist chocolate cookie meets a spiced gingerbread man...delicious. Difficult to eat just three.To add a festive flair, I flattened the dough balls just a bit and sprinkled with raw sugar. Earth's Balance worked great as a substitute for butter since there is a dairy allergy in the family.

Delicious, great cookie. Will make again with no changes.

Excellent recipe. I used baby food prunes instead of applesauce and increased the cocoa powder to 1/2 a cup. Also, I replaced a 1/2 a cup of the flour with whole wheat flour. Next time I will try adding some crunch - hazelnuts? amaranth?

Made these last night. They are marvelous, very soft and moist. I used pastry flour and organic sugar.

These cookies came out moist and flavourful. Best of all, they're healthy too! I'll tweak the spices to my liking next time, maybe omitting the cloves.

I thought these cookies tunred out excellent considering they are healthy. They were definitely more ginger-y in flavor than chocolate - like fluffy gingersnaps. Would make again . . .
