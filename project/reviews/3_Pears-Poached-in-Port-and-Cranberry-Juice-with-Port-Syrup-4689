This was excellent. Fancy enough for a dinner party and yummy enough for kids. My boys request this often. I also kept the pears whole, It works quite well that way, and I also let them sit in the juices overnight after they were cooked.

wanted to offer this hint: seems like a lot of people are having problems with their pears not having enough color. When I worked at the local country club we used to make these and the secret to getting a really gorgeous colored pear is to cook them whole and let them soak in whatever wine mixture the recipe calls for. don't worry about sogginess - leaving them whole keeps the flesh surprisingly firm. I seem to remember we soaked them for at least 3 days but probably even 24 hours would help quite a lot. Hope that helps :)

Made this recipe quite some time ago and even tho I enjoyed the pears very much, I was a little disappointed at the lack of color the pears absorbed. But the flavor made up it. I froze the leftovers as an experiment. Served them this evening at a dinner party. Surprisingly well preserved. They did not get mushy as I has expected. Served them with a little coconut sorbet on the side. Very nice finish to a meal.

This dish was too fancy for my taste. There's something about port that makes me think of gout. I kept thinking freshly sliced pears would have been better with the yogurt topping on the side.

I used this to end a wine tasting dinner. Everyone enjoyed it very much. It was easy and could be made a day ahead which always helps
