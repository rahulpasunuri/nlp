Tasty recipe. I used a large red onion, which added a nice bit of color. I also seasoned the batter with salt and pepper. I substituted vegetable oil with olive oil. Nice flavor combo.

I didn't feel like this recipe had all that much going for it. There are definitely better ones out there, but this is a good plkace to start if you're a first-timer. I used olive oil for the frying as per the Hanukah tradition. It made the flavor a little nicer and more complex.

This is a quick and easy recipe. I like the tip about the wire rack in the oven because alot of people don't know that is the best way to keep fried food crispy. This is also a better way to drain the oil from food rather than using paper towels.
