I didn't feel that this was all that interesting, plus the flavors didn't compliment each other well.

Both my husband and son said "this is a keeper". We had it over grilled asparagus, but were dipping the chicken into it too. I used lemon zest instead of orange, but will try the orange next time. I think I may also try it as a marinade and add the pine nuts as a garnish.
