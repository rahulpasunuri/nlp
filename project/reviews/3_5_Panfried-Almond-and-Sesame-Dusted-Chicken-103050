I've made this for my family a few times and we love it! I have a 3 year old, so I cut the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. There's never any leftovers after this meal.

they tasted very good the nite I made them (warm) but as the recipe said it was also good room temp I served it the following day for a party and was very disappointed. Only change I made was using boneless breasts and panko for the flour. The breats were very dry/tough and I used Purdue brand. As I have tons of marinade left over Ill try it again since so many liked it in above comments.

Great recipe. I had to make a few changes, can't find green pumpkin seeds here in Istanbul so I doubled the almonds. The marinade makes a great dip (make sure you boil it for a few minutes). Everyone loved it!

Outstanding combination of flavors! I made a little roux to thicken the marinade and brought it to a boil for one minute and served it as a little sauce on the side. I did everything else pretty much the same as called for in the recipe. This was just fantastic!

Excellent recipe. I did marinate it a bit too long which caused it to dry out a little. Next time I wont make that mistake. The flavor of both the marinade and the coating are just great. A real winner in my book!

Amazing flavor. Would like to find a way to make it without frying it.

Everyone in my family loved this hot out of the oven and enjoyed the leftovers just as much. Making the coating was a total snap since I purchased hulled, toasted pumpkin seeds at the health food store.

This was the first time I had done this recipe, and I liked the suggestion of using chicken tenders.(less frying & baking time too) The marinade is fabulous, giving the chicken a pleasingly moist & tangy flavor. I made it for a mexican theme party, and it was enjoyed immensely by all. One of the fussiest eaters in the group asked me for the recipe as well. I'll definitely do it again.

My newest favorite chicken dish! I use chicken tenderloins and make the dish all in advance, only saving the baking part until last minute. So very yummy, and so many compliments!!!

I liked the result. Interesting texture on the coating. The chicken was very moist. I wonder if sunflower seeds would work as well in lieu of the labor intensive pumpkin seeds. While a bit prep intensive, a lot of the prep can be done well in advance so the meal is an easy thing to pull together as friends arrive.

The coating alone makes this recipe. I've used it on pork chops (excellent), chicken breasts, and turkey cutlets. Forget other bread crumb mixtures!

hello there- I hate to be the lone dissenter, but I made this recipe based on the rave reviews and was not that happy with the results. I did double the recipe (big family) so perhaps that had something to do with it? The chipoltes were very smoky and the tamari very soy-y and though I liked the juiciness of the meat I found the flavors somewhat too much. I did not double the crumb/nut coating and yet still had a lot left over, and did not really taste the sesame nor almond nor pepitas...seemed like there was too much flour? All in all quite a chore to prepare and quite a mouthful...I think you might need to LOVE the smoky chipolte-ness and be a huge fan of a thick crumb coating?

Wonderful, one of the best chicken dishes ever! I warmed the marinade and served on the side for those who wanted a bit more heat. When sauteing, be careful, as the coating browns very quickly. Make extra coating and save it in the refrigerator for the future, it retains its flavor for at least 2 weeks.

This dish is incredible. It is time comsuming but worth all of the effort. I made it a bit too spicy but will try it again and again. I also may make these as appetizers and chicken fingers.

This is one of the best chicken recipes I've ever made. Although it is somewhat labor intensive, the results justify all the work. I saved some of the work by leaving out the pumpkin seeds (all that hulling) and adding extra almonds. Perhaps sometime I will try it as written. Either way, I will certainly make this dish again.

Absolutely delicious! Very moist and flavorful. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts and just baked for about 20 mins. I'll make this again and again.
