This is now one of my favourite special occasion desserts. I have made it in one large strudel, and have also made individual strudels, using one sheet, brushed with butter, sprinkled with crumbs and folded once. Makes neat little individual servings. I serve it with my really easy (cheating) rum cream (I beat 1/4 cup rum into 2 cups of softened vanilla ice cream).

This was very good and different, I offered it as a part of a dessert buffet and it went faster than any of the other desserts....try scoring the phyllo where you will be slicing before you bake the strudel....it makes cutting a much easier and less messy affair.
