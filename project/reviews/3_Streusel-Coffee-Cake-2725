This was pretty damn good! Not AMAZING, but very nice with coffee or tea. I also thought it was a lot better the next day, the cinnamon stood out more, which I loved.

This is my go-to coffee cake recipe. I usually grate the apple, and use 2 small apples instead of 1, it really helps the texture. I also added salt to the streusel topping. It's a really versatile cake, will take any flavoring agent/fruit/jam you want to add!

The suggestions to add salt and make more streusel were right on! I added 1 teaspoon of salt to the dry ingredients and made 1.5 times the streusel that the recipe calls for. I made the cake into a bundt, which was perfect in about 50 minutes (dark pan). Very moist and yummy!

This was easy to make and tasted good, but I wasn't wowed by it. I will probably experiment with another coffee cake recipe next time. Nothing wrong with it, just not very exciting.

I thought this was really, really good -- moist and with a great crumb. It baked up perfectly in a bundt for about 55 minutes.. perfectly done. I would, however, def add a dash of salt.

Was a big hit at my brunch. I left out the apple, but didn't change anything else. Could probably have used a little more streusel than the recipe makes.

Added 1 1/2 tsp salt to dry ingredients and 1/2 tsp allspice and 1/2 cup chopped pecans to streusel. Cake came out fabulous - moist and flavorful. Was a huge hit on Christmas morning.

This recipe was just the coffee cake I was looking for to serve with coffee on short notice. The yogurt made it perfectly rich and textured not unlike a scone. I did add salt and did not add the apple. I had to use margarine. I needed it to bake more quickly so I halved the recipe and baked in in a metal cake pan with the streusel as an inside layer and as topping. I had to turn the temp down to 325 part way through cooking, but it did take at least 10 minutes off the bake time. I came out perfectly and received rave reviews. I will certainly make it again whenever I want coffee cake.

I have made this recipe many times, and everybody loves it. I do add a teaspoon of salt to the flour mixture. I also add about a 1/2 cup of chopped nuts to the filling. Sometimes I omitt the apple. When I do include the apple I shred it first. I bake the batter in one bundt pan with only one layer of filling at 325 degrees for about 55 min. It comes out golden with a delicious nut center. Also make sure you don't over mix.

I used margarine instead of unsalted butter in the batter, and added 1 tsp. cinnamon with the nutmeg. I baked it in a bundt pan, and made 3 layers with the batter and filling. The result was very tasty, moist and light.

Definitely needed salt. Not good enough to make again.

This recipe tasted like it was missing something. Perhaps a dash of salt? The consistency was good but something else needed to be included but I'm not sure what.

I added a teaspoon of kosher salt to the recipe and chocolate chips to the streusel. My family loved it.

I will definitely make this again. I made a few changes I would also make again. I used light sour cream instead of yogurt. I baked all of it in one decorative greased and floured bundt pan. This added about 10 minutes baking time. I had 3 layers of batter with the streusel in between. Like other reviewers I found it to be moist and flavorful. I think the sour cream helped. The presentation was great as I put it on a nice large plate and dusted it with powdered sugar.

I used fat free plain yogurt to see how it would work. I made one loaf using 2 eggs and added chopped roasted nuts to the streusel mix. The cake was moist and tender but not as flavorful as I'd hoped. I don't think the apples added anything but chopping time. Next time I will add cinnamon and more vanilla to the cake base.

Perhaps I was expecting too much because of all the glowing reviews! I thought this was just so-so. I'd rather make a good coffee cake, or apple crisp, rather than this, which seemed to be an attempt at combining the two. I'm taking the second loaf to work, as I won't eat it here. Perhaps others will like it more.

I only made half the recipe. I used Dannon strawberry yogurt (not fruit on the bottom) instead of plain, and it turned out good. It is so delicious! It is very moist too!

This is a good quick recipe. With some simple changes it could be great. Try these alterations: Add 1/2 cup of finely chopped walnuts to the streusel. Try vanilla yogurt instead of plain. Add icing, a basic powdered sugar and milk icing will work fine. Finally, try making half a recipe; you'll only have to throw out a half an egg and one loaf is pretty big. I got 10 thick slices from one.

This recipe does well in a bundt pan using the same recipe. It is good for one bundt pan. I would recommend a nice coffee icing (of your choice) on top of the cake.
