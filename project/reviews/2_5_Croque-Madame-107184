I agree that the chicken is so odd, although it's described as an American variation I have never seen it served that way and I am a native Californian. I must admit though that I always serve my croque madame with a velvety mustard bechamel so that it the "norm" for me.

Easy to make, easier to eat. Yeah, the distiction is the egg. I don't know what the person below is talking about; I'm sure that their French friends love having he or she around for laughs.

Where on earth is the person laying down the law on "Croque Monsieur" and "Croque Madame" getting his/her information? I have lived in Paris for the last eleven years and in every café I've been in a Croque Monsieur is made with Jambon de Paris and a Madame is the same but with an egg on top. Various other hams are sometimes used, but then it is noted and the dish is called a "Croque Campagnard" or named after it's region (for example, with a tomato, it's a Croque provençale). I have NEVER seen a croque made with chicken.

The difference between Monsieur and Madame is the former uses Black Forest ham and the latter uses chicken. You will embarrass yourself if you try to pass this one off to your French friends.
