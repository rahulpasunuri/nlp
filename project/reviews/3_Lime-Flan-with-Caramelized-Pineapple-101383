We made this great dessert in 2012. Only changed to add 4 eggs, rest egg substitute. Pineapple was great with flecks of mint. The flan, my first, was perfect - used Mexican limes (Key Limes). The caramel was perfect on top--it shone like a mirror. We could not believe how great it tasted. Texture was perfect.

I thought this was nothing special. The ingredients were expensive, and the texture was not like that of a flan at all, it wasn't even like a cheesecake. It was bumpy, and when inverted it wasn't smooth on top, making it look rather unpresentable. Also cooking the pineapple on high heat is way too hot, and the pineapple got burnt. It didn't taste very good either, a traditional caramel flan would have been much better. This was a waste of ingredients and I won't make it again.

I thought the recipe was pretty good, but not really a flan. The texture wasn't nearly as smooth as a true flan. But then again, for the number of calories it seemed like a good compromise. And everyone else at my dinner absolutely loved it. I served it with mixed berries (strawberry, blueberry, blackberry) instead of with the grilled pineapple and it made a very pretty presentation.

Did not taste low -cal at all. Even my non-calorie counting family members loved it. It is light and refreshing, great for a hot summer day. I have to agree that it did not have a traditional flan texture, but was more cheese cake like.

For a low-cal dessert, this one was a keeper. While not really having the consistency of a traditional flan, it was wonderful in a different way. Tremendous lime flavor and the texture was extremely creamy-- a bit like a very creamy cheesecake. It didn't taste a bit low-cal. The "carmelized" pineapple didn't exactly do so. Basically, when I followed the instructions, the pineapple just ended up warm-- a nice compliment to the flan but a bit misleading.

An excellent "light" and "refreshing" desert. It is wonderful with the pineapple. The fresh lime juice gives it a nice flavor. I will most definately take the time to make this again.

Very hard to make in a small amount of time, but it was wonderful.
