These were SO weird. Like, if you are one of the west-coast hippies who grew up without sugar or something you might like them. Given all the butter in them, they should taste a LOT better. I thought I did something wrong because they ran all over the place and didn't set where the dollop of jelly was so I did it again, freezing half the dough and baking them on a pizza stone. Only marginally better on the second try. Bummer. My dog is sad I wasted all that delicious peanut butter.

If you didn't achieved some smooth and sweet cookies with an intense flavour of peanut butter, then you don't know hoe to cook. This was my first recipe and it went perfect. So perfect that everyone want to know how I prepared it.

No forks. I followed the recipe exactly. These were dry and my taster couldn't even tell what flavor they were supposed to be until I told him "Peanut butter". Plus, the dollop of jelly makes them a hard cookie to store or take anywhere. Definitely will not make these again.

Wow. These were really bad. I generally try a promising recipe a few times before I give up, but when I made these, they came out so bland and dry I had to throw them out. They were like cardboard with jelly. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it isn't that difficult, so I am done with these. I wish I lived next door to one of the other reviewers so I could try theirs. The ones that came out of my oven were just no good. Maybe the original recipe would have been more to my taste.

I made these, following the recipe exactly, for my family, and everyone loved them. They were a hit and my sister already wants to make them again.

I made these cookies for a friend of mine who loves peanut butter. They were a total hit. Not only did she love them, but so did my brother and his friends. I used light butter, and a the brown sugar spenda mixture to try and make them even healthier and it worked!

These were great little cookies. They have a nice shortbread like texture. I use bob's red mill whole wheat pastry flour, which I love for all cookies. I added just tablespoon or more of additional sugar. These are a nice change or pace and would be a standout at a party.
