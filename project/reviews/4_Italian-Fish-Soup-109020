Following the concerns of other reviewers who felt there was too much broth, I used 2 cups of water, 12 oz of clam juice, half the amount of tomatoes (pureed them before adding to broth), and skipped sugar. The broth was very flavorful and there was a good amount. I substituted catfish for the halibut. Finally, I squeezed half a lemon over the final product. Absolutely delicious. We had it on Christmas Eve and my whole family loved it.

We really enjoyed this for a family dinner. I didn't have squid, and decided not to splurge for clams or hallibut, so I increased the shrimp and mussels and used cod. It was still wonderful. I used bought fish stock but added one bottle of clam juice and boiled the shrimp shells with the stock and clam juice for more flavor (then removed the shells). We added a salad and sopped up all the soup with the toasted italian bread. Yum

Terrific! Could not find squid, which I'm sure would have made it even better, but even without that it was delicious, very Italian (and I grew up eating homemade Italian food) especially the broth. Don't ever make it without good fresh Italian or French bread for sopping. And make a bit more than you think you need because here will be seconds.

Fantastic... Reduce water to two cups...plenty of broth...

Yummy! I couldn't get my hands on any fish clippings or stock, so I boiled the shrimp shells in some water, then added the broth in which I steamed the shellfish and added 8 oz of clam juice. I was worried that the broth was too watery, so added some more spice, and boiled it off for about half an hour (and added diced tomato). The broth came out amazingly. Loved it.

We've made this soup three times now - the third time for 14 people on New Year's Eve (tripled the recipe, but could have doubled, with a big antipasto platter). It is truly a winner. I almost skipped the garlic toasts the first time - NOT! They are an important element and easy enough to make ahead.

This is amazing. I don't understand all the complaints about the liquid though... this is soup, get a spoon! It's soooo yummy. I use big soup bowls and ladle the soup over a bed of spaghetti. Don't forget the toasted garlic bread!

I liked this recipe. This dish really allows a lot of latitude in the ingredients you can use. I didn't use clams, but I had 2 pounds of fresh mussels instead. I disagree with the other readers about the broth. I think there wasn't enough. I would add more broth and then just throw out the excess when all the meaty bits are gone. A good recipe with lots of room to personalise it.

I agree with the comment about too much liquid. We were SWIMMING in broth. Also, it was not a clear liquid, with all those tomatoes. Needed more seasoning too. It was ok, but I thought it would be better.

Way too much liquid in this recipe, hold the water addition till the end. You can always dilute it, just don't add the 4 cups of water at the beginning. You can take a bath in this recipe if you don't watch out. Nice flavors, easy to make but with all the liquid around, you need a sponge, not a loaf of bread to soak up the soup.

Amazing!! I made for Christmas Eve and it was a huge success. I made it again without the mussles and clams and even my 3 year old and 1 year old loved it.
