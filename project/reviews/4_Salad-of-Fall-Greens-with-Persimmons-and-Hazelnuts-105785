I used fresh orange juice instead of tangerine and arugula and spinach instead of the other greens. It was a phenomenal salad!

A nice showcase for the persimmons and a pretty salad!

Great for Thanksgiving dinner; I've used this recipes twice in the past. I too used clementines since I could not find tangerines, and I omitted the watercress. I split the hazelnuts in half. Everyone loved this!

I think the salad would've been better by omitting the watercress and escarole. The two greens were just too overly strong and pungent. I'm a big fan of watercress, but I think that they are better eaten cooked than raw.

this salad was a beautiful first entree for my christmas dinner. I added dried cranberries for some added flavor and color, and like previous reviewers had mentioned, I found the dressing to be too oily so i halved the amount of vegetable oil. the combination of flavors and textures were wonderful.

Took this salad to a friend's home as first course for Christmas Dinner. Taking a cue from previous reviewers, I omitted the watercress, cut the oil (used grapeseed) to just over 1/2 cup. It was beautiful and delicious! btw, hazelnuts are available in most stores already "skinned"... .a real timesaver! The Fuyu persimmons are splendid, much better than the softer ones. Next time, as someone suggested, I would add extra grated tangerine peel at the end. I just cut the entire peel into tiny strips. It's sweet and tasty, not like other fruit peels with the pith.

Truly wonderful salad with lovely presentation, unique flavors and easy preparation. We preceded the salad w/ a simple lemon/chicken broth soup and served Pressoni Soave Classico for both courses. The wine was perfect, even with such a sweet dressing.

I substituted the tangerine sections because persimmons were out of season. The dressing is delicious but is a bit heavy handed on the oil. Next time I would cut the oil ratio by 1/4-1/3... and I would chop the hazelnuts. Otherwise, its a lovely simple salad accompaniment to other complex entrees/dishes.

This salad was delicious! The things that made it were the dressing and Fuyu persimmons. I made it for thanksgiving and everyone raved. Tangerines weren't in season so I used clementines. Everyone raved. The only not I have is that it makes ALOT of salad! cut the lettuce in half if you aren't having alot of people.

First served the salad as written and my husband thought it was especially good. The dressing is excellent. I think I would have enjoyed it more if my persimmons were riper! The second time it was served with warm goat cheese slices. For me, this made it over the top!

I'm a personal chef and served this at a sit-down dinner party for 15. All guests (except one) gobbled up this salad, practically licking their plates. One guest said it was the best salad he'd ever had and asked for more. I did not use the bitter greens, but instead used baby greens. I garnished this salad with edible flowers to make it a little prettier.

Great salad. I served a modified version of this for thanksgiving and it worked really well. I didn't have hazelnuts and threw in dried pumpkin seeds instead.

Excellent--smelled wonderful, from the tangerine juice. The cinnamon added just a bit of warmth. The sweet persimmon, the bitter greens, and the hazelnuts were a great combo. Only change was to add slightly more vinegar to balance out the sweetness.

I made this for an elegant potluck put on by VERY good cooks. Everyone loved it and it disappeared, despite the plethora of other things to eat. The tangerine is essential to the character of this salad. It took about 15 minutes for me to boil it down, but the aroma in the kitchen should have been bottled. I went all out and used an expensive balsamic vinegar and hazelnut oil, also expensive. The watercress looked sick, so I skipped it and used loose baby lettuces from my produce store, as well as a head of escarole. I've never used escarole before and it seemed tough, but maybe it gave body to help the other lettuces stand up to the dressing, persimmons, and nuts. I didn't peel the persimmons (never have, in similar recipes) and think it would have made them too squishy (even though they were fuyu and nice and crisp). Next time, which will be soon (Xmas dinner) I'll do everything I did the first time, except use mostly baby romaine (instead of the escarole) and about another half baby mixed greens. (I have a wonderful produce shop.) Also, since it won't be served buffet style, I will plate it as the recipe suggests.

When I was assigned the task of bringing a salad to Thanksgiving dinner, I thought that there was no more boring assignment possible. So I figured the best thing to do was to bring a salad that would astound everyone. This salad did just that. It was a big hit and for one person, it was their favorite dish of the meal. It's a bit of work but worth every minute. The only change I would make is to toast the hazelnuts a shorter time than directed.

I've made this several times and everyone always loves it. I use whatever greens I have on hand and sometimes toss in dried cranberries and/or pine nuts. The dressing is delicious!!!

Fabulous.... have told all my friends and shared with my cooking class. The colors and flavors in this salad are amazing. I used mesclun greens. I also used dried cranberries and goat cheese. The tangerine juice is a must.... also use tangerine zest after reducing the juice. And yes the dressing does tend to be oily...just use less.

i changed this around a lot because of what i had on hand and what i could find in the store. i only used mixed baby greens, none of the other lettuces, i added goat cheese, omitted the hazelnuts, didn't cook down the orange juice (i used that instead of tangerine), and even with all those changes it was absolutely delicious. my parents wants to use it on thanksgiving this year.

I made this salad last night. It was easy ,very tasty and had a great presentation. It got a great review from my husband. I used baby greens and water crest only. I could not find tangerines, so I used orange juice with a 1/2 tsp sugar as a substitute. It was wonderful to the last lettuce leaf and I look forward to making it again soon.

I made this salad for Christmas Eve and no one could get enough of it! My sister had requested a "special" salad and this definitely delivered! I didn't think of the crowd as huge salad eaters, but for 9 people I made 1 1/2 the recipe and people were scraping the last bits of hazelnuts and greens out of the bottom of the bowl! They all thought it was delicious -though next time I think I will add just a touch more balsamic to balance the oil. Don't forget to grind in plenty of pepper! Excellent!

I used only baby field greens. It was delicious and very pretty.

What an unlikely combination of ingredients that go so very well together. Served this at thanksgiving and what a hit! Complex tastes that go really well together. Made everything to spec and didn't change a thing.

Delicious salad dressing. I used fresh orange juice and didn't have any zest--used a bit more than was called for in the recipe and it was wonderful. I eliminated the cinnamon. I also used two bags of mixed baby greens rather than the watercress and escarole. The next day it was delicious on a salad of mixed greens with grilled lamb and asian pears.

I served this over the weekend and everyone requested the recipe. I left out the watercress and it was just fine. It went well with the Turky Escarole Orzo Soup from this same site. I also added rosemary french bread with the meal. yum !!!

I made this for my brother birthday in November. It was such a hit with the family that they want me to make it for Christmas dinner.

This salad was a hit at a casual Friday night dinner party in the fall. I was requested to bring it to our next get together with the samae group as part of a Chanukah potluck. It is a bit of trouble but unusual and worth it.

Sad to say I substituted apples for persimmons since mine were the mushy variety, but the salad was good nonetheless, and would be wonderful with crisp persimmons. I also used bagged mixed baby greens, and less oil in the dressing. Does this make it a whole new recipe?

I make a salad almost identical to this, without the tangerine juice, and will add it in the future. The balsamic really knocks out the hazelnut or walnut oil's delicate flavor, and since you just dropped twenty bucks for a bottle of it, you'd want to taste it, seems to me. Cider vinegar works better in my opinion.

I really had to tinker with the dressing a lot to make it come out well. I suppose many dressings call for this, but the vinaigrette seemed far too oily. I emulsified it properly but when i tasted it I found myself reaching for the vinegar over and over. The toasted hazelnuts were a nice addition to the salad as was the hazelnut oil in the vinaigrette. This was my first time eating persimmons--they were soft and I thought ripe, but they seemed tasteless. I couldn't find Fujus--did I do something wrong?
