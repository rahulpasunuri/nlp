Just made this tonight for the first time. Everyone loved it, so what could be wrong?

Amazing! I can't wait to make this again, next time I am inviting people over.

This recipe needs a sweeter sauce which brings all the flavors together. This one was too acidic, fought with the slaw which was already pretty acidic but delicious. The fish was a little bland but of a perfect texture. I would make this again but from a different recipe.

I'll make this again. I used true cod as that was available fresh. I would use more cumin next time and perhaps add cucumbers to the slaw.

Love this base recipe... Quite few changes...used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of Mahi and doubled the marinade. I let that sit about 4 hrs and then grilled and sliced it. To the sour cream I made the listed recipe and added a touch of cumin, salt, pepper, a teaspoon or so of honey and a few dashes of chipotle tobasco. Amazing! I lastly added some cilantro to the cabbage...The tortilla, sour cream, sliced chicken, cabbage, avocado and a touch of cheese...one of the best dishes of the month for sure!

This was pretty good. I turned it into a salad instead of tacos. That was great because it's filling, but it's also a very healthy and light dish. We enjoyed it. We made it with Halibut instead.

Made ths last night and it was absolutely awful - one of the worst recipes I've ever tried. After two bites we dumped everything in the trash. Almost no flavor, and what flavor there was did not compliment the fish. Does not taste even remotely Mexican. This is purely a "diet" recipe, and it's not a good one.

We loved these tacos. Could not get Mahimahi and substituted Cod. Probably would try a different fish next time but yummy yummy. :)

Definitely on the "make again" list. Simple, quick and delicious!

I substituted chopped radish for red cabbage to give the filling more zing. Sour cream dressing was great but the mahimahi was bland despite the marinade. I had to season it, post-grill, with lemon zest and kosher salt.

This is an excellent fish taco recipe. I made it as written and thought the slaw and the sour cream sauce worked great. We used a bit more avocado. I would like to try this with prawns next time.

Wow these were great. A big hit at dinner, served them with Beer pinto beans and spanish rice. I used flour tortillas because others at dinner do not like corn tortillas. would hightly recommend trying it, very easy to make.

This was REALLY good. I was disappointed to open my package of mahi mahi and find out they still had the skin on, but it didn't really matter once the fish was grilled. I took the advice of another reviewer and lessened the amount of milk in the sour cream sauce. I still had a little sauce left over. I also skipped the avocado because I knew I wasn't going to be cooking again for a few days and knew the other half of it would go to waste. I didn't miss it, there's enough different flavors going on without it.

Great flavors. I would not add all of the milk as it makes it too watery, but the sour cream preparation is otherwise delicious. I have made this by marinating and grilling tofu once, and vidalia onions another time to make it totally vegetarian. I place flour tortillas on a dry, very hot pan to make them crispy on the outside and a little soft on the inside. I shave the cabbage on a mandolin to make a very thin slaw.

To a cook from Washington, DC. I don't mind so much that you are wrong on FOOD SAFE plastic bags as it relates to human health, but more that you state it with such authority. Where exactly is your toxicology degree from? I realize that living inside the beltway they tend to add Kool Aid right to the drinking water, but c'mon.

Really enjoyed this with friends tonight. It's fast to prepare and a wonderful combination of flavors. Fish required less cooking time than indicated. As another reviewer mentioned, the lime is cooking the fish as it marinates, so use a really hot grill and turn after two minutes (for 1/2" fillets), and remember that the fish will continue cooking after you remove it from the grill. My mistake was grilling the corn tortillas too long. You are really just heating them and taking the raw flavor off a little. Grill too long and they become hard, chewy and unfoldable. Also, 1/2 avocado is not nearly enough. Two avocados is more realistic. And I completely agree with Vicki in Vancouver: no need for plastic bags. Just use a flat casserole and turn fish so it's all coated. Plastic is not good for human health or the environment.

Have made this twice. Fresh halibut worked well baked in foil if you can't find Mahi and your grill is broken. This also works without tortillas if you want a salad - add some more veggies. Yum. Sent extra sour cream mix home with friends, who put it on a frittata the next morning and loved it.

I made it with two changes due to what I had at hand: used vodka instead of tequila and pan fried mahimahi instead of grilling it. It turned out amazing. I will be definitely making this again many times!

This was not a hit and a good bit of trouble. The marinade sounded really good but was blah. The slaw also sounded good but all it added was crunch. The sour cream sauce was also just blah. My husband really didn't like it. I won't make this again.

This is a fast and delicious recipe. Did not like to much the sour cream dressing alone but it goes fantastic with the fish.

To Vickie in Vancouver. Great comment about the plastic bags. Also, just imagine how much you could reduce your carbon footprint if you didn't turn on your computer and attempt to hijack threads? Please keep it shut off for the sake of the children.

Made this for dinner last evening and the family loved it. It's hard to believe, but we didn't have any tequila in the house so I used vodka instead. I used whole grain tortillas instead of corn and it still tasted great.

Great summer dish. Very light and fresh. You can probably cut the sour cream sauce recipe in half and still have plenty. I served it with black beans and rice, and sliced watermelon. Will definitely make again.

The tastiness of the recipe gets 4 forks, but I do wish recipe writers would stop recommending marinating in plastic bags, especially with acids. It isn't necessay. We all have non-reactive casserole dishes or the like that we could and should use for our health and for the environment.

@ kschanak's No Fish should smell Fishy..Fish starts to smell/taste fishy only after it starts to decay. Fresh Fish should have the subtle scent of the waters of which it were caught..Ocean,Lake etc..

Very good recipe. Mahimahi is an excellent, light, white fish. If it smells fishy, it's not fresh. Also, if your fish is falling apart on the grill, you've cooked it too long and/or are flipping it around too much.

I have done this with two very different fish...fresh caught halibut and sea bass both were very nice, on the halibut intead of cumin I tossed in some chipolte seasoning..yummo!

To the cook from Miami, we have many species that could work equally as well for this mahi recipe. A few, grouper, any species, cobia, tripletail, sheepshead, flounder is a little softer but for this great. Any of these fresh is equally as white-fleshed and mild tasting, snapper also though more pricy and softer. Fresh tuna would be great as well, just that tuna has its own unique flavor, just like sword.

i love fish but, alas, the rest of the family doesn't so i prepared this recipe with chicken tenders and it was still awesome.

Just a note to the reviewer who said mahi is not a mild fish. I suspect that the mahi was not fresh. Fresh mahi is a very mild fish and should not taste"fishy". Do not be afraid to try mahi-mahi. It is a wonderful fish!

Rating: 3
Have to disagree with the last reviewer - dolphin fish (aka mahi in Hawaii) is a very mild-flavored fish, WHEN IT'S FRESH. Or when it's been flash frozen right after being caught. And tuna is not at all a substitute. We really don't have any other similarly meaty white-meat fish with the same texture and flavor which can stand up to grilling without falling apart, at least not on the Atlantic or Gulf coast. This is an excellent preparation - just don't marinate too long because the lime is cooking the fish and can make it unpleasantly chewy.

Rating: 3
Just a warning to those who are planning on trying this dish - MahiMahi is NOT a mild fish! It is the opposite. If you are looking for a milder fish for this recipe try tuna or something similar. However, the marinade does go a long way in tempering some of the "fishiness" of the Mahi. Nice bright notes of lime give the dish an authentic taste

Awesome!
