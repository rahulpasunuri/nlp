I made this for Easter brunch several years ago and keep inviting friends over for brunch to have the excuse to make it again! Everyone loves it (including my 3 year old). A winner with zero modifications.

Can anyone tell me if the egg yolks are runny or do they set a little firmer?

Beautiful, easy recipe. Perfect for a Sunday brunch.

I wanted to make this for a crowd but didn't have the right size custard cups, so I made a huge version in a casserole dish. It took a little longer to cook but was worth the wait! This was a huge crowd pleaser. Next time I'd do the polenta the same day - it was a little hard to work with the next day. Yum!

Made this for Easter brunch and it was delicious. The only modifications that I made were in the polenta; instead of using water, I used 1 cup of chicken broth and one cup of milk -it came out very nice. Guests raved about it.

This is a fabulous recipe- have made several times with no modifications. Easy, elegant breakfast dish

Very good - a bit of work, but not hard...I used deep popover pans. Made the polenta with chicken broth instead of water, and added a minced clove of garlic. Used Asiago cheese instead of Gruyere. Do be careful not to overcook it!

I made a faster and easier version. Kids were hungry NOW. Used precooked bacon(Perfect!) to line muffin tin. Didn't have polenta so cut out bread rounds with biscuit cutter. Plopped in an egg and cooked. 20 minutes was a bit too long but came out great and tasty! Topped a few with cheese. Only took 20 minutes in total time.

This recipe is awesome. Yes it takes time but you can do most of it ahead (made polenta the night before, then made the bacon cups/prepped the rest before guests arrived). Then you pop it in the oven and enjoy your guests' company. My new oven may be at fault but 20 minutes is too long, eggs were cooked through. I think it would be more luxurious and rich-feeling if the yolks were slightly runny. Used jumbo muffin tins with no trouble, but had extra polenta left over. Guests raved and enjoyed. Delish.

Makes a really pretty breakfast item. I used a large-sized muffin pan. I did think it was really cheese heavy, and I would not make it with Sharp cheddar again, because it was a little too much. Overall, will be a fun recipe to play with.

I made this for Easter brunch and it was fabulous - JUST AS IS. There's no need to make any changes! Can't wait to try again!

I thought this would have more of a "wow" factor for the work involved. Tasted good, but not better than other egg dishes I've tried with less work. Probably will not make again.

Since I was just making 2 servings, I didn't want to fuss with the polenta, so I made this with quick cooking grits and it turned out great. Here's my version: Prepare 2 servings of grits accoring to package instructions (there will be extra leftover). After grits are cooked, add 1 Tbsp. butter,some crushed red pepper flakes,fresh ground pepper and pinch of dried thyme. Set grits aside and cook 5 slices of bacon. Spray pyrex custard cups with Pam, then place bacon in cups per instructions in recipe. Spoon in about 1/3 cup of grit mixture then top with 1 Tbsp. grated cheddar. Crack egg on top, sprinkle with salt and pepper, chopped green onion, then another Tbsp of cheddar. Place cups on cookie sheet and bake 20 mins. Remove from cups and place on plate. Surround egg with spring greens dressed w/the sherry vinaigrette. Serve with triangles of buttered toast. Note: This can also be made with cooked potatoes/ hashbrowns instead of the polenta/ grits.

I made this for a mothers day brunch along with the usual brunch items. The people that were eating like plain bland food but these went so fast I made more and these people could bot get enough of it. I make this recipie about 4 or 5 times a year and it is a huge hit evrey time.

I've made this so many times now it's gotten really easy. Mine don't look as picture perfet (I use a thin sliced bacon and I'm sure it effects the outcome) but they're still pretty impressive. I use plain old cornmeal. I wait for it to cool before pressing in the cups and pop them in the refrigerate - bringing to room temp before continuing. It really is quite tasty and oh so simple.

Love this and its so easy! Used purchased pre-made polenta and just sliced rounds.

I really like this polenta recipe. I substitute chorizo for the bacon sometimes and add a bit of creamed spinach or slice of tomato before the last layer of cheese and the egg. Yum.

This is a really yummy, special brunch/breakfast. We had it for Easter & will for sure make it again. It didn't take as much effort as I expected, either.

I loved this! I love that the egg, "bread", and meat are all in one. I used a 13oz bowl, and that was perfect for use with a large egg. It looked very nice on the plate and my guests loved it. You can do most of it ahead of time, so it's great for a group.

This was a great do ahead Easter brunch item. I assembled it the day before then let it come to room temp before baking. I, too, found that medium eggs worked best and I did not need all of the cheese. I used prepared polenta, adding a bit of chicken broth to soften it. One tube will be sufficient for eight ramekins. Everyone loved this dish!

This is actually easier than it sounds. And you don't necessarily need to use bacon either. You can just put polenta in a cup tray and let it chill. Then put in whatever toppings you want (I put sauteed greens and tomato), then pour on beaten eggs, then put on grated cheese and herbs. Easy!

Made this dish for guests this past weekend, and everyone enjoyed it. I have to agree with other reviewers, it's a bit time consuming, but worth the effort. Do as much prep work ahead of time. I didn't, and it took about 1-1/2 hours to assemble and bake. Use small to medium eggs - large will run over. Lovely presentation!

This was a fantastically easy recipe and everyone loved it! For the vegetarians, I substituted the bacon for slices of sauteed portobello mushrooms - it worked really well

I used premade polenta with garlic and sundried tomatoes, which made the dish easy to prepare. I also cooked the bacon a little longer to make it crispier. It was very tasty, but a little rich. Even my picky sister loved it, overall a big hit this mother's day!

Very delicious, but with bacoc and three kinds of cheese, it would be hard to go wrong. Makes a beautiful presentation.

Made this for Mother's Day 2006 and everyone loved it. I used muffin tins that held about 3/4 cup. Not everyone likes eggs so I filled some w/ the cheese and crumbled bacon. I would have liked the bacon more crispy - so I will work on that but overall it was a hit. I will make it again. Very easy!

Rating: 3
Some of these stuck a bit - you really need to have bacon surround the entire inside of the cup because the polenta will stick if it's touching the porcelain. These were very tasty!!

This dish tasted and looked great. It was easy to prepare, but looked spectacular. I used a muffin tin, instead of individual cups, this worked, but buy medium eggs. I used Jumbo and the spilled over the side.

This is very good, beautiful presentation. Served it for Easter brunch to rave reviews. That said... Don't try this for a large group. Time consuming, and too much of it is at the last minute. I loved it, but wouldn't do it again.

This sounds very good if you are a stay-at-home person with cooking your major objective. There are far too many steps and time constraints for many people to actually make this recipe a part of their repertoire. Now, if someone had the time to make this and serve it to me, OK!!!!!!!

Love this!!! Use chicken broth instead of water when making any polenta - it's soooo much better that way. Great recipe!

It tasted terrific. A little difficult to assemble though. I eventually decided to use really cute custard cups and just serve them in that. It made it much easier.

Rating: 4
This was really easy, very unique and had a nice presentation as a brunch dish. I thought it was delicious and my guests did too. I was afraid the eggs would break apart when it was time to move them from the ramekin to the plate. But they slid right out with the help of a spatula.

Sorry folks, I didn't think this recipe was great. It was good. But not great. I think it required a little too much preparation not to be fabulous. And maybe I didn't take it out of the custard cup correctly, but mine fell apart when I did. Which begged the question, why go through the effort of making it all neat and precise in the custard cup if it's going to come out like mush on the plate. To me (and my husband) it was essentially bacon and cheese eggs with a side of polenta.

This dish was delicious, unique and made a great presentation. I believe this is the wrong forum for reviewers to rate the dish on anything other than the preparation and taste. If you want a healthy version, just substitute healthier ingredients such as egg substitute and turkey bacon rather than complaining about it. Like another reviewer implied, everything in moderation. So you eat this dish at brunch, then adjust your remaining meals that day to healthier choices. It's not rocket science!

I just made this for Mother's day brunch, along with some asparagus, potatoes, smoked salmon... etc. In any case, this was brilliant! I made the polenta the night before so it was firm and ready in the morning. I prepared it as described but also added freshly sliced mushrooms right before cracking the egg into the cup. they were a hit and so easy, I will certainly be making these again. Also, there are so many areas for variation with respect to herbs, spices and vegetables you could add...

Granted I am a novice in the kitchen, but this is probably the tastiest dish I've ever made. Everyone served was impressed by the food, and I was impressed by how easy it was to make. Oh, and I did not have custard cups or whatever, but I did have a muffin pan with heart shaped cups in it. The dish held the heart shape surprisingly well. A nice added touch if you've got the cookware for it.

This was fantastic! All of those who decided to argue about the health issues of this dish need to get over it, I almost didn't make this because the % was so low...good thing I read the reviews and noticed that the majority of people were being way too over the top! This was an amazing and beautiful dish to make! An easy way to impress! Making the polenta the night before was key! I can't wait to serve this again.

I loved the main idea of this recipe, but I have a compulsion to modify. I didn't have polenta so I didn't use any. Instead I folded the bacon into the ramekins, added a tsp or so of cream, and a dollop of butter, then added chopped thyme, basil, and rosemary, followed by two eggs in each ramekin. Seasoned with salt and pepper and baked. They were delicious. I also used a water bath in the baking process but I'm not certain if that was necessary. Another great slightly quicker adaptation to this recipe.

Simply DELICIOUS.

Made this recipe for 20 and everyone raved about it, even those who didn't like polenta. A few hints when making this for a crowd: use muffin tins, saves space in the oven. When making the polenta, let cool until it holds it shape, then pour onto plastic wrap and roll into a sausage shape the same diameter as the bottom of the muffin tins; when cold just slice to desired thickness.

My Guess is that "Dr. Heart" is not a doctor at all - just another sad, lonely crank with too many cats and nothing better to do than surf the web. Any real cardiologist would recommend moderation and balance. It's not like your average Epicurious reader would try this for breakfast 7 days a week.

A delight to eat and a pleasure to serve - my guests were applauding and one of them was an MD! Everything in moderation "doctor"! I skipped the bacon on the bottom - didn't see the need for it.

OK Dr. Heart---You've got to lighten up. Check out Julia Child's longevity, she wasn't neurotic about food. You really ought to go to the Cooking Light site, this is probably not the place for you. Really, unless you have terrible heart disease in your family or you eat like this immoderately, you really can enjoy your food even if it is FAT (dirty, dirty word).

I made this for brunch this weekend, and it was delicious AND beautiful! I made the polenta the night before, and prepared the bacon and assembled the rest before guests arrived. The creamy, flavorful polenta was a great complement with the eggs/cheese. Although more intensive than a strata or casserole that can be completely assembled the night before, it was not too difficult. The hardest part was removing them from the custard cups/ramikins. I used a small silicone spatula, and only had one casualty that didn't quite hold its shape. I served this with the greens featured in the same brunch menu, but didn't add the bacon drippings--mache is too delicate for such heavy grease. I didn't have time to make the strawberry recipe from the same menu, so I just added sliced strawberries to the greens, and it was delicious! I rounded this out with a blueberry coffeecake, and will definitely make this menu again!

If the cook from Kansas City thinks that their heart isn't harmed by what they eat, no matter how good it tastes, they should talk to their cardiologist and make me the beneficiary of their life insurance policy.

Made this for my husband's birthday breakfast. Everyone absolutely loved the taste and the presentation! Would definitely make it again for a special occasion. It was worth every calorie. Topped the breakfast off with Cucumber Coolers (from the Drink Recipes)....in case anyone felt guilty :)

This was fantastic! I made it for a brunch and received rave reviews. It did take quite a bit of prep (you really need to make the polenta the night before) but it was worth it. Not sure why one reviewer rated it for heart health rather than for taste...Perhaps that review would be more relevant for Cooking Light.

Wonderful recipe! The single servings were impressive/sophisticated in presentation with a great blend of flavours. I followed the recipe to the letter with no problems and would not change a thing. Also made the strawberries from this menu and they were delish although took some time/effort to find the lavender flowers. Received so many compliments from my weekend house guests that I felt a little embarrassed by all the attention. Bravo, Epicurious!
