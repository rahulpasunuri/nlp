I had two packages of lite cream cheese and 16 oz. of lite ricotta cheese. I substituted the ricotta for the remainder of the cream cheese. I added an extra tablespoon of the orange liquor. I only used 1 C. of sugar. These substitutions changed the texture of the cheesecake. It had a more cake-like texture. It was wonderful with the caramel. I made it again following the recipe. Both cheesecakes were delicious but the ricotta cheesecake healthier.

Oh, as a side note, I also used my old stand-by graham crust recipe which uses only 2 TB. sugar instead of a half cup; it's just 2 TB. sugar, 1 C. graham crumbs and half stick melted butter all mixed together.

Made this for 6 people, all really enjoyed it. However, why bother making the caramel sauce from scratch? I use my favorite caramel sauce, Fran's Caramel Sauce, heated it a little and just added the orange liqueur to it, so much easier and time saving! Agree the temp for the crust is too high as well as too much time, had oven temp at 400 and only baked crust 8 min. and it was perfect. A lot of cheesecake recipes don't even call for baking a graham crust first, anyway.

IN THIS RECIPE IN ORDER TO GET A BETTER RESULT THE FILLING MUST WAIT OVER NIGHT

This cheesecake is just average... the caramel sauce doesn't really add anything special to the dessert. I think it would be better if the crust included ground pecans, and the sauce was not so sweet. Careful when cooking the crust - 450 degree oven is too hot for a full 12 mins and the crust will burn! I suggest lowering the temp. to 400-425 and cooking for 8-10 minutes. Easy recipe.

I LOVED this cheesecake. I make a lot of cheesecakes, and this is one of the best-tasting, easiest cakes I have mad yet. I actually sold this cake at an auction, and after giving out samples, it sold for 5 times its original value! As for that last reviewer, I would just like to say that it is obvious by looking at all these VERY positive reveiws that you are to blame for this recipe's failure. So don't blame the cake, ok?

The cheesecake was just O.K., the sauce was a disaster. It turned hard within minutes of cooling and one of my guests actually had the sauce adhere her fork to the the back of her teeth, it was captured on film. There are to many other good cheese cake recipes out there to risk this one again.

I added more orange flavor and I feel that it was a little too sweet. Next time I'll follow the recipee :) Very good flavor and moist even with out the sauce. I liked it very well

I have found most of the reviews on Epicurious to be extremely helpful, however I was a little disappointed by this recipe (especially since most of the reviews were pretty favorable). I don't think I would bother to make this recipe again...

A delicious cake one of the best I ever tasted.

This is wonderful. I agree with the baking time on the crust as well as the sauce being a bit grainy, butonly after cooling. If I had used the sauce right away, it would have been better. I reheated the sauce and added a little more cream, and there was no problem!

We agree - crust cooks in 5 minutes - but it is outstanding. This is definitely 4 forks - and yes, the sauce can be grainy - and you might reduce the sugar - but just heat through - it is amazing. This is by far the best cheesecake you will ever eat - rich - but very good.

Caution! The crust cooks in less than 5 min. The carmel sauce has too much sugar in it. However, if you fix these few things, the taste of the cheese cake is delicious.

This cheesecake was wonderful and received rave reviews from everyone who tried it. The sauce really makes the dessert. I, too, had to adjust the crust's baking time to 5 mins., since the first attempt burned at just 8 mins.

This cheesecake is AMAZING!!! One of my guests at Easter dinner said this is the best dessert he has ever had. I think it is as good as I have ever had. Dessert just doesn't get any better than this. Note of caution: my crust cooked in only five minutes.

This cheesecake was absolutely wonderful. Granted, it is rich, but just terrific, melt-in-your-mouth taste thrill. Can you tell I love it?
