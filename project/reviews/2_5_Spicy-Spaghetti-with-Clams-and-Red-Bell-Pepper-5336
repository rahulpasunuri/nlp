Hum-drum... nothing to scream about. It's fast and easy, but something is compromised in the flavor when making a sauce like this too quickly - needs longer simmering time. There are much superior tomato sauces out there and all you would have to do is add clams. I took it upon myself to add a chopped onion, knowing that I really might not like the sauce without it, and it still didn't help.
