I made this to go with the nutcraker tart, and it worked beautifully. i didn't have almond syrup or amaretto so i used a tiny bit of almond extract, which was fine. It wouldn't be much on its own...

The orange and cranberries go well together, but I'm not sure about the almond syrup. I made this to accompany the Nutcracker Tart, though, so the almond syrup worked fine in that capacity.
