These are highly recommended. I added garlic powder and black pepper - very good.

YUM! We love these biscuits! Jalapenos and chives are great additions, not at the same time though : ) They're so addicting, make with caution :)

They were meant to be an accompanyment w/dinner. However I couldn't stop popping them. They were so so good warm.

I made these for dinner last night and thought they were very good and easy! My guests thought they were very good as well.

These biscuits are great and SO easy! I added cajun seasonings to the cheese to add a little extra flavor, and I actually only used cheddar, but they were perfect! A great idea for any meal!

I used this recipe to top a creamed chicken casserole thus turning it into a cobbler and it worked really well. I dropped the batter onto the hot chicken mixture and baked it at 400 for about 15 minutes. I halved the recipe as it would have been too much otherwise and left out the cheeses (would have overpowered the dish) and the sugar, used sour milk instead of buttermilk and added a little extra butter for richness. I had to add extra milk also as it was more like a dough than a batter with the stated amount. So there wasn't much left of the original recipe when I got finished with it but that's the sign of a good recipe - it can handle a "few" changes.

If you really want Red Lobster biscuits..visit the Top Secret Recipes web site but...this recipe is great in it's own right. Have fun with it! I used Monterey Jack with bacon in it...great flavor! You could use the garlic herb flavor, tomato basil, etc. Choose your combo based on the main dish. I used extra sharp cheddar and parmesan for the other cheeses. I didn't have buttermilk so I used vinegar in regular milk. Great with chili!

These biscuits were light and delicate! We loved them. I added an extra tbs. of butter, decreased the sugar to 1 tbs, increased the salt to 1/2 tsp, added some garlic powder and used Kraft "Mexican Style" shredded cheese in place of the three varieties that were recommended. Also, brushed w/melted butter AFTER taking them out of the oven. The result --- perfect tender biscuits. This is our new favorite recipe!

Made this first with my granddaughters as part of a brunch for their parents. Should have doubled the recipe, because they vanished -- the girls were very proud of their efforts. My husband made recipe again yesterday - yes, we love the biscuits! We added another TBSP of butter and a bit more baking powder - asiago cheese made them even better. Only complaint is that they are very heavy - will experiment to get them lighter, and will make them often - quick, easy and delicious.

After reading all the comparisons to the Red Lobster biscuits, I had to try these! I did add an extra tablespoon of butter because it seemed that they would be very dry (compared to my usual biscuit recipe). They were dry, and without much great cheese flavor (I used good quality cheese, and extra sharp for the cheddar). My family was not impressed. I'll continue to try for a good cheese biscuit elsewhere.

These are great, I added a little garlic (Red Lobster's have some garlic in them I think) and they were fabulous!

I normally make rolled biscuits and was a little leary to try these. But when I ran out of time, I decided to try these for Easter dinner. I'll never make rolled biscuits again! These are fantastic and the reviews from my guests were wonderful. I halved the sugar and increased the salt a little and they were perfect! These will be made again and again!

These biscuits were tasty, however if you use less than the 1/4 cup size dont forget to shorten the cooking time! i made some large and some small and i dont think the large size even needs 16minutes. I think red lobster's are even butterier so i might try brushing them before cooking next time.

Great flavor and EASY to make. I did use only about a tablespoon of mixture and got about 2 1/2 to 3 dozen 1 1/2 inch biscuits -I found the baking time to be just slightly less. Made the biscuits for two diffenent luncheons, everyone raved about them. My husband also liked them. Definitely a recipe to keep and share.

These biscuits are delicious. They are very light and fluffy, with lots of yummy cheese. However, next time I will eliminate the sugar and perhaps increase the salt. They had a slightly sweet taste that didn't completely agree with me. Otherwise, they were great! This recipe makes 10 HUGE biscuits, so if you drop a smaller amount on the cookie sheet, it will make more and nobody will be any the wiser. Definately a keeper.

I thought these were yummy. I put all of the ingredients together, except cheese and buttermilk, beforehand so they are convient as well. worth trying. toad

WOW!! These put Red Loster biscuits to shame. If you like alittle spice just add some chopped jalepenos. Drop by spoonfuls instead of 1/4 cups and cut down the cooking time to about 6 min. and you have a great party snack. A must try!
