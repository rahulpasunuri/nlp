Several problems with this recipe: 1) give a measurement for the pears in cups after they are sliced for the best accuracy; 2) a 400 degree F oven for 35 minutes burnt this recipe to a literal "crisp" 3) too dry, recipe needs more liquid for the pears and raisins.

Easy and delicious! The flavors combined very nicely. I will reduce the amount of sugar next time as it was very sweet. My husband, who's not a pear fan, loved it and went for seconds.

I love the pears and the ginger differentiates it from a typical crisp/crumble. It is so easy as well.

Try an oatmeal topping with hazelnuts it is a crumble.

Would like to make, but does anyone have a suggestion for a substitution on the ginger cookies.

This is an excellent combination of flavors. My husband and I both thought the ginger and cinnamon were a great compliment to the pears. It was very good even though the pears were not very ripe.
