I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe! Delicious! My boyfriend loved it and he seldom has too much to say about food. I used 93% lean ground beef, 10 oz. low sodium tomato sauce, only half a carrot and a mix of marsala wine (it's what I had!) and red wine vinegar. Tasty!

There are three of us doing this review. one would have given it a four fork rating and the other two give it three. Here's what we think...it was a bit too sweet but really quite delicious. Nice and filling on this first day of snow in Vermont. We used our own grass fed beef burger (Clarence), fresh tomatoes from our garden...a mix of cherry varieties, plums and then a bit of canned tomatoes and salsa (cause we were doing some improv). Very happy and delicious alongside some slaw with cabbage, kohlrabi, red and green peppers...all fresh from the garden.

Delicious, indeed. Everything here to send you in the right direction. Make it your own and enjoy it. I added vinegar per previous reviews and loved that flavor in the dish. Then I sang Adam Sandler's "Lunch Lady Land" song in my head for the next 2 days (and counting). If you're not familiar, check it out on You Tube. You'll be glad you did. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psshz92azj0&feature=related For the impatient, go to 1:45 into the video.

It was great! I used venison. Also, I substituted 1/4 cup of wine with red wine vinegar, as previously suggested. I will definitely make this again.

Not that great. I followed the recipe diligently but it didn't have the flavor I was hoping it would. Also a little too spicy for my palate!

I used ground turkey... these are soooo good. And sometimes instead of red wine I use Maderia and that's excellent!

This was really yummy. I took the advice of others and used diced tomatoes - perfect! Great use of ground beef.

This is a really delicious recipe. I'll certainly make it again, however I'll only add one-half the amount of sugar it calls for since we found it a bit too sweet. But apart from that, it's great and a definite keeper.

This was a very delicious recipe and would certainly retain this one in my recipe collection. There is one thing I would like to add to this recipe, though, and that is the addition of acid. As I was tasting during the cooking process, I noticed it was in need of something to lift it up. I added white vinegar to taste and that took it to where it became a bit more special in flavor. Red wine vinegar would have perhaps been a bit better but I was out of that one so made the substitution with white.

Rating: 3
I had a little trouble at the beginning because I forgot to chop all the vegetables ahead of time, but with help it worked. My roommate also reminded me that I needed to drain extra grease from the ground beef. it's going to be messy even with out it. but everyone who tried it loved it.

Really liked this recipe, as it was flavorful yet simple to prepare. I used 93% lean ground beef, and after reading other reviews, a can of diced tomatoes. When I make it again, I will probably use either crushed tomatoes, as the sauce was a bit runny.

Rating: 3
Actually, I give this 3.5 forks. I would definitely make it again. It was quite tasty. What I changed: did not puree tomatoes, just used petite diced. Used 2 tsp chile powder (ancho) and reduced red wine to 1/4 cup. My family really enjoyed this and I loved it because it was great for a quick, weeknight dinner.

I felt the wine-to-meat ratio was a little heavy handed. Maybe it was the variety of wine I used, but I would've appreciated a less strong wine flavor overall. The next batch I make I will likely use a can of crushed tomatoes with puree. I didn't really see a huge benefit of using a blender to pulvarize the tomatoes- a can of crushed tomatoes will do the trick and will save having to wash the blender! I served these as suggesed on split, toasted Kaiser rolls. Several people added shredded parmesan as a topping, which wasn't necessary, but a nice bonus.

Sorry....I forgot to add: I did NOT puree the tomatoes. Instead, I used a wooden spoon to break them up a bit when I added them to the pan, and allowed them to break down a bit more with a longer simmering time. The result was perfect - it left chunks of tomatoes throughout instead of the usuall-suspect of a smooth Sloppy Joe sauce. Just another little thing that I felt made them 'Sophisto".

I had a yearning for a Sloppy Joe, but wanted to 'upscale' a bit, and this really fit the bill. I made a few adjustments: I used slightly more tomatoes (San Marzano), a small amount of chopped fresh jalapeños (for a 'clean' heat), and some fresh-diced Shepherd red pepper. Because I used shiraz for the wine, I chose to add a bit of smokiness by adding a pinch of ground chipotle chili powder. Had I chosen a cabernet or merlot, I would have omitted the chipotle. They were delicious! The wine certainly brought things up a notch and the chipotle brought out the shiraz quite nicely. The carrots added perfect sweetness, and the celery and peppers added some textural bite. Satisfied my 'upscale Sloppy Joe yearning' very, very well, indeed!

Okay some people confuse the everloving eff out of me. Why would people 'make this for years' and only rate it 2 forks? If you think it's "meh" why would you KEEP MAKING IT? Surely you could be doing better things with your ingredients if you don't like it. HOWEVER, I loved it! It was just like I remember them being made when I was a kid and I got to share it with my husband, who never had Sloppy Joes before!! He loved it too. It has a little zing, but not much, perfect for me for a little flavour. I wouldn't change a thing!

Excellent recipe! It was so delicious, we made it again the same week!! Substituted Splenda for the brown sugar and Smart Balance Light for the butter to make it healthier. Also just bought a can of pureed tomatoes instead of putting tomatoes in a processor. Absolutely wonderful!!!!

I gave this 2 forks but I do think it is a little better. I have been making this for several years now, I guess it takes me back to the days when my mom made what she called Joes from meat, katchup, onions and a few more things I don't really remember. I add a roasted chopped Pablano pepper for that extra zing! I guess I make this 3 times a year. Try it.

I'm not sure about the "sophisto" part, because they still taste like the sloppy joe's my sister loved to make so much as a kid (even with the red wine...strange). Still, a good sloppy joe.

This is a wonderful weekday dish, very easy to prepare. I doubled the amount of tomatoes and even though that sounds like a lot, it was perfect. Did not like it on a bun--so next time I served it over rice. Don't omit the carrot--gave it a nice texture. It tastes similar to chili without beans, but is faster and better. Freezes beautifully.

Whenever we're in the mood for a sloppy joe, we use this recipe, but use Boca crumbles instead of ground dead cow. The seasonings, along with the wine -- don't get hung up on proportions, but go with your gut and your eyeballs -- make this the best sloppy joe you can hope for. Dress it up with fine bread brushed with a good olive oil and toast those buns until they are beautiful.

Rating: 2
Tasty! I used crushed tomatoes and lean beef. Other than that followed the recipe to the letter. Does anyone get unusually sleepy after eating these joes? Both I and a friend had to take naps afterwards because we became so sleepy. Happened on two different nights, too. Any of the ingredients inherently induce drowsiness?

I've made this 4 times now & planning to make it again this week. It's very easy & very tasty and leftovers are always eaten up. My 2.5 year old likes it as well as my hubby. W/ the included veggies (i throw a bit extra in there), it seems like a good way to sneak in extra veggies - tho, my family is pretty good about eating their veggies.

very tasty. I'd never made sloppy joes and thought I'd give this a whirl. was very easy, able to do with 16 month old running around! (this is how I judge easy - can I do it without pulling out my hair, burning food, or taking 3 hours to actually get it done?) I will make it again. I like the sweet potatoe fries idea another reviewer mentioned. I had wished I had fritos on hand. that seemed like it would have been the perfect match. but I also like the other reviewers sweet potatoe suggestion.

I would give this a 2 fork for good. Fast, easy, kid friendly, but nothing very special. I'm a little perplexed by the number of 4 fork ratings (meaning "a dish beyond compare"). I think there is a little grade inflation on epicurious.

I would have found this recipe to be very flavorful had it not been for the overwhelming spiciness from the chili powder. Without knowing which chili the powder is made from it's hard to judge how much to put in. I put in 1/4 the amount specified in the recipe and it was still too overpowering.

Wonderful. The name fits perfectly. We made this on a lazy Sunday afternoon, prepared just in time for the football game. As I'm a vegetarian, I substituted beef-like tofu, but needed to add some mustard and hot sauce to liven up the flavor. I did try a tiny spoonful of my boyfriend's, and it was really delicious. I added a bit of grated Fontina to each--that made the flavors come together. Being from Paraguay, my boyfriend had never had a sloppy joe, nevertheless a sophisticated take on such. He was duly impressed, pleased, and stuffed. Me, as well. Highly recommended.

This is the first time I made sloppy joes. I searched and searched for the most promising sounding recipe, and am glad this one won out. Wonderful flavor, and not difficult at all. It tastes great already tonight, but I made a day ahead to let the flavors go through. A couple things to note... it is not as "messy"/tomatoey as a traditional sloppy joe. If you're looking for a lot of sauce, go elsewhere or adapt. But the flavor is awesome. To give it even more kick, I added a bit of garlic salt, onion powder, and a good dash of Jamaican hot pepper sauce. Serving with sweet potato fries. Can't wait!

These were fabulous! Our teenaged kids were dubious while I was cooking but everyone loved them. I used crushed instead of canned whole tomatoes as suggested in a previous review and increased the amount of spices (since we like spicy). I topped mine with a slice of cheddar cheese. Mmmmm!!

A good, easy week-night dinner that was happily devoured by my toddler (with rice and broccoli, I must admit, rather than in a big roll - so it was a not-so-sloppy Joe). I over-sugared the meat and so ended up correcting my mistake with a splash of cider vinegar, which really enhanced the tanginess of the Worchester sauce. I'll definitely make this again.

Pretty tasty, for a Sloppy Joe. I followed the directions as written, with the exception of using a 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes to avoid the blender. My husband liked it better than I did. (Seems to be a theme?) Overall, a fast, enjoyable weeknight dinner and better than a can of Manwich.

This was just a great creative take on sloppy joes. My boyfriend and I loved how there was no heavy sauce, but just the spicy,sweet,tomato taste of a really great dish. We were both so surprised that the outcome was so tasty. Also, using a bit of olive oil instead of the butter to brown the beef, and using 96% lean beef really makes this dish low in fat. Definatly one to make again.

My family likes sloppy joe's quite a bit, and we have been relying on an old recipe from Bon Appetit that a reader contributed for years (Sloppy Joe's Semma). This one is very good, heartier, with a bit more depth. Will be a hard choice next time we want to have sloppy joe's!
