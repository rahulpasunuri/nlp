I had some sour cream to use up and stumbled across this cornbread recipe. It was extremely quick to mix up and exceptionally moist. I omitted the pancetta as I actually needed a more "traditional" cornbread recipe but it was still really good. I also didn't feel like melting the butter (one more dish to wash!) so I substituted oil to no apparent ill effect.

Wonderfully moist cornbread, loved the smoky flavor of the pancetta -- though I like it just as well without.

This was a good recipe, although I would add a bit more sugar and salt. Also, I used low fat milk and no fat sour cream and cut the butter and it was still yummy.

This was a very tasty corn bread. I made mine with proscuitto bits instead of pancetta and served with mussels instead of clams.
