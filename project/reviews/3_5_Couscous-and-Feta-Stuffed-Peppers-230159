I found this recipe years ago and have been making it ever since. It's a great way to eat squash and cherry tomatoes, often I only use zucchini because I'm lazy. I rarely bother with the peppers unless I'm looking to make something fancier. I often omit the oregano too but never the fennel!!!!

This was light, healthy and delicious. I used quinoa instead of couscous to cut out the wheat since I'm gluten free. I also added a little spicy turkey sausage and red pepper flakes. It was soooo good. The only thing I would minus next time would be the fennel simply because I'm not a fan of fennel.

We liked this enough I had to print out the recipe again. My husband really liked it and it's vegetarian, too.

After reading other reviews I upped some of the ingredients; the fennel seeds, oregano, cherry tomatoes and feta. The filling turned out to be amazing and the feta pretty much made the dish. Plenty of filling leftover to bring to work this week for lunch as well.

This is a keeper, and most of the recipes I have found here, aren't for one reason or another. Pepper,schmepper; it's the filling that makes this dish adn you can put it in whatever, I would imagine, or just serve it separately. We made this with brown rice and thought it was great. On a weeknight, I will try couscous as it will be light years faster to put together. Oh... I omitted the chickpeas and upped the cherry tomatoes. Used one cup of uncooked brown rice and all of the filling was used in 3 large peppers.

Somewhere between okay and good. Enjoyable but definitely nothing special, i expected more from this dish. Cant say 100 percent whether or not id make this again, it was a good add on to a meal but it definitely wont impress anyone.

we make stuffed peppers often, and I was looking for a version I could use to update mine. Mostly followed this recipe, however made the following changes which produced something different and tasty beyond the usual version. REplaced spices with garam masala which I found in bulk at my local natural grocery store, it made it really flavorful and no other spices were needed (except salt) Used quinoa instead of couscous, to pump up the protein content Used canned diced tomatos (1 - 15 oz.) Healthy, tasty, full of flavor and filled everyone up! yum!

Rating: 4
I gave it 4 forks after my additions/modifications - don't know if that counts. used quinoa instead of couscous, used garam masala spices as we have it in bulk at our natural grocery which gave it a full bodies flavor so I did not include oregano and the other spices required (salt only). Lastly, instead of tomatoes used 1 15 oz can of diced - all other ingredients and steps were followed and produced a yummy, healthy and filling vegetarian meal that is so easy, tasty and well liked by the whole family...!

I had some large zucchini (courgettes) and peppers, so I gave this a try two ways - the way the recipe is written, and the reverse, with the zucchini stuffed with bell peppers. The stuffed zucchini was MUCH better than the stuffed peppers. I'd recommend you follow all the rest of this, but use quinoa instead of couscous and reverse the zucchini and peppers.

Rating: 3
Great suggestions in the reviews below that I will try next time. Even without, this is very nice and worth making. We had the leftover 'stuffing' as a cold salad the next day too. Next time I would cook the peppers a bit more.

Rating: 4
Quite simply, this is the best stuffed pepper recipe I have ever prepared and enjoyed. Follow the recipe verbatim on the first attempt and embellish on subsequent prepatations. I will experiment with brown rice and orzo in the future. I will not, however, look for substitutes for the garbonzo beans/chickpeas. The garbanzos provide plenty of protein and a crunchiness that canelloni or black beans cannot offer.

I have made this recipe several times and love it because you can change it easily with whatever suits you. I replace the couscous with brown rice. I added pine nuts and garlic, used red onion, only used a little zucchini and yellow squash, sometimes not at all. Added more feta and more fennel. I also put a cube of Philadelphia cream cheese in the bottom of each bell pepper for an added surprise, which made this creation creamy and delicious.

I made this for a dinner party of 12 people. Everyone was so impressed and the best part is that the recipe was so easy!

I've made this a few times and played around with it... I like it best with quinoa instead of couscous, adding a giant clove of garlic (chopped), and using 3 or 4 roma tomatoes chopped up with juices (even the canned kind) instead of cherry tomatoes... Also nice to mix it up with the beans, any kind will work. I dont boil the peppers, just bake them 5 to 7 mins longer - cut in half and filling mounded. These freeze well indeed!!

Good, just not as leftovers. The peppers tasted pretty gross the next day.

The filling for these peppers is delicious, but I didn't like it in the peppers. I added a bit of freshly chopped garlic to my filling, didn't have yellow squash or chickpeas so skipped those and substituted Italian herb seasoning for the oregano. Would definitely make the filling again and use it as a tasty side to roasted lamb or chicken. When cooking couscous, use equal parts boiling water and couscous grain. Add 2 tbsp veggie oil after the water boils, mix, then pour couscous in. Let sit covered for 4 minutes, add 1-2 pats butter, and fluff with a fork.

I loved these peppers! After reading some of the earlier reviews I did make a couple changes. I used quinoa in place of the couscous and also black beans in place of the chickpeas. The rest I kept the same though wasn't the most careful with measuring everything. This recipe is so forgiving and you can really be creative in what you put in the peppers. I froze the peppers to bring to work for lunches and the left over filling was a great side on its own. I will definitely be making this again!

Rating: 3
I really really liked this dish. It's surprisingly filling, yummy, and looks really beautiful. I realized that the seasoning in this recipe is not my favorite, so I used cumin and cilantro instead. It makes for a perfect lunch or healthy side dish. I also loved how colorful it looks! It's a keeper.

Fairly foolproof weekday lunch. Have made as directed, and with ground turkey and lamb in place of the beans. Individual peppers can be frozen and nuked for lunch at the office, to no negligible effect. Cheap also!

This is an absolutely wonderful side dish. My dinner guests loved it. After reading the reviews, I modified it a little. I didn't have fennel seeds, so I skipped those. I used black beans instead of chickpeas, I added a handful of corn, I added garlic, and I grated the zucchini instead of slicing it. I also cut the peppers in half and piled a mound of the couscous mixture on top, and still had a little leftover. When I make this again, I'll probably omit the peppers since the majority of my guests did not eat them. However, the presentation was beautiful so I'll use the peppers for special occasions.

Rating: 3
I would definitely add some more feta, and I think next time I'll cut down the fennel seed a bit. Delicious though!

Rating: 4
I LOVE this and it is a very adaptable recipe for whatever veggies you need to use up. To those who think it is a little dry - try using Israeli couscous (the little balls) because it is much more moist than regular couscous. Also, I find chickpeas dry so I use black beans. I have made this a few times and last night was best ever - add garlic and mushrooms to everything else; sub Israeli couscous for regular and the black beans for the chick peas. There was not a speck of food was left on anyone's plate.

The stuffing for this is absolutely delicious. I made mine with only zucchini as I didn't have any squash, and I used goat cheese instead of feta. I had some grape tomatoes and some yellow cherry tomatoes that I combined for this. I upped the oregano, fennel seeds and salt a bit, and added some fresh ground pepper as well. Fantastic flavor!!

Rating: 3
I liked how quickly this recipe came together, and as others noted, how adaptable it is. I didn't have any squash and wasn't in the mood for feta, so used mushrooms and parmesan in their places. I also added lots of fresh garlic (as others suggested)and used cumin, a bit of coriander, and a tiny pinch of cinnamon in place of the dried spices. Also took others' suggestion to halve the peppers so the stuffing could be mounded--otherwise would have had way too much. Couscous is so easy to work with and IMO made these more interesting than rice-stuffed peppers.

I loved this recipe, though I did make changes: Instead of 1/2c onion, I used 1/4c onion + 1/2 shallot + 2 garlic cloves, minced I roasted the peppers for ~10mins instead of boiling them (1 less pot to clean) I didn't have zucchini on hand, so left those out. No cherry tomatoes on hand, so chopped two fresh farmer's market tomatoes instead Added a handful of fresh herbs (mint & basil) from the garden - which made the dish!

This was a great recipe, but I didn't exactly stick to it - I substituted quinoa for the couscous and added more feta, tomatoes, oregano, red onion and some basil, as well as using 6 peppers instead of 4. Yummy!

It was good. I'd make it again but I wasn't floored by it or anything. There is definitely way more filling than peppers and I even used 6 regular-sized peppers and had enough to fill at least one more.

I must say that I was a little disappointed with this recipe. It is good, but nothing great. There is something "missing" in the flavor department, but, I can't quite put my finger on it. I used canned diced tomatoes, and added mushrooms, and garlic as well. I will make again when I need to "use up" these ingredients that may be laying around my fridge.

This is my first time writing a review in the 10 years I have used epicurious recipes! The stuffed peppers were excellent--satisfied myself, my husband and 2 year old son. I substituted Israeli couscous for the regular couscous, basil for the fennel, and chopped tomato for the cherry tomatoes. My son was so excited to see the pepper full of couscous and cheese, that he wanted to taste everyone's at the table (since we all had a different pepper color). We look forward to making this recipe with veggies from the garden this summer.

I felt the feta cheese did not go well with the peppers- on the other hand I love feta with roasted mushrooms- and in general was quite bland. Definitely won't be making this again.

A pretty fantastic recipe. I selected super huge bell peppers, but otherwise would have had too much couscous mix. I agree with another review that a few extra tomatoes would add some zest. Very filling, very easy to make.

I only tried this because I needed to use up an abundance of bell pepper I had gotten from my CSA. Did not have zucchini so I used the same amoung of yellow squash I had frozen in it's place. I was pleasantly SURPRISED at how delicious this was!!!!! Will definately make the filling again even if I don't have bell peppers.

I almost never give recipes 4 forks, but I feel like this recipe deserves it because of it's versatility and the fact that the whole is more than the sum of it's parts. I hate it when people review recipes but have actually changed the whole recipe, so I won't inflict this upon the other readers. I will just say that I switched around a few things in order to better utilize the ingredients that are in season right now. As the recipe is written, it will be a perfect winter vegetable side or entree. Whether you make the recipe as it is written or you make some changes, I think that it is badly in need of some garlic, though. If you leave out the feta, I think that walnuts would be a great addition. Per the recommendations of some other reviewers, I added olives to mine, and they were fantastic. As other people said, you could substitute orzo or rice and it would still work very well. I think that this will be added to the regular rotation.

Rating: 3
This is the first dish I've cooked from epicurious. It's a tasty, healthy dish that would be a great accompaniment but is a little dry as the main feature. I would recommend serving it with a sauce. Like others, I had lots of the couscous mix left over, but will save it for lunch tomorrow.

i made this recipe tonight and it was a big success! i substituted spinach for yellow squash, roasted the peppers for a half hour prior to filling them and topped them with extra feta and pine nuts as suggested by other users. i don't have cooking spray so i used olive oil, but next time i will definitely invest in the spray. mine didn't have that low fat feel. also, next time i would pre-roast the peppers for longer (maybe 45 minutes?) and i would definitely leave out the pine nuts - they sound good in theory but tasted out of place in the end.

Rating: 4
These were great! I took some suggestions and used 6 peppers instead of 4, roasted the peppers instead of boiling them, added mushrooms and broccolini (instead of yellow squash) cut them in half then piled the stuffing on. Topped with pine nuts & some extra crumbs of feta. Was really delicious!!!

Rating: 4
Very tasty, quick healthy meal. I halved the peppers so that I could really mound the stuffing into them and had just a little bit of couscous stuffing leftover plus it made the feta brown up a bit which I like. I also started the peppers in the oven while I made the stuffing and that seemed to soften them sufficiently and spared an extra pot. Great recipe - meant to add the pine nuts but forgot so I'll try that next time.

I made this the other night for my husband, who if had not meet me would have surely died of scurvy due to his aversion to anything that is not meat, and it was a big hit. I would make up the stuffing to keep it in the fridge for a quick healthy lunch.

A fresh, yummy vegetarian dish (if you use something other than chicken broth!). I substituted eggplant for the squash and added fresh chopped basil, a bit of spinach, and about a tablespoon of chopped capers. Oh, and I used fat free feta instead of regular. I agree that it makes quite a bit, I filled 5 good-sized peppers and still have over 2 cups of leftover couscous mixture.

A delicious summertime meal. Even picky eaters will enjoy this one. Fennel seed is a great addition. I love couscous, but I will do less next time (1/3  1/2 c) or use bulgur. Could also add extra tomatoes. Broiled the tops of these after baking. Had a lot of extra fillingenough to fill two additional peppers. Looking forward to making this again as well as trying some variations.

I've been making this recipe for a couple of years now. It's a staple in our house. Like others, I make some changes. The first being that I dont like cooked bells so I serve it as more of a warm salad. I just chop the bells and add them to the stuffing and serve as is. This is also a really versatile recipe- easy to substitute, add, subtract or change to your liking. If I make it as is (which I do often because it's easy and uses ingredients normally found in my pantry), the only other change I make is to drizzle a bit of super flavorful evoo on top to give it a little extra flavor. Kalmata, green olives, capers and garlic are all great additions. This is great with or without couscous or even with quinoa, orzo or acini de pepe instead. We love couscous though so I usually just use that. Last night I only had about 1/3 cup so I made only 1/2 the cous cous called for but kept all else the same- it worked out fine. It stores well, eats well the next day, travels well, works well at a picnic or potluck and does double duty as a side dish or a main dish with equal grace. As others have said- as written this recipe makes enough to feed about 8 I think.

I loved this recipe - although like most I altered it a bit. Being a vegetarian, it is sometimes difficult to find good tasting recipes. I added toasted pine nuts, chopped green olives, celery (instead of fennel) garlic and a jalapeno pepper. I agree with others that the recipe calls for too much couscous. I also roasted the peppers in the oven instead of boiling them. Be careful not to get them too soft however. Makes a lot of filling.

this was great! Easy to adapt to whatever veg you may have on hand. I stuffed my peppers with crimini mushrooms, broccoli, onions, garlic, and a Korean hot pepper. I used whole wheat couscous (tastes just the same but adds some fiber) and low-fat feta from Trader Joe's. Yum!

I make this dish all the time. It's a really easy, low-cost filler. Sometimes I don't do the peppers, just the couscous and it's great. The couscous gets even tastier in the fridge (ends up being my lunch for the next week) and it easy to scale up. I'm making dinner for about 35 people in my department and will make a big dish of this for vegetarians.

I used the mini peppers from Costco, cut the tops off and made a slit down the center on one side for stuffing before I boiled them. They were really easy to de-seed. I broiled them on both sides to get black spots and this brought out the sweetness in them. They were easy to stuff and were just the right size for appetizers. They were the hit of a potluck cocktail party we went to. The couscous mixture could have used a couple of tablespoons of fresh lemon juice to brighten it up. I served this with moroccan chicken skewers and Trader Joe's red pepper and eggplant dip/sauce and all blended together perfectly.

Loved this & so did my non-loving couscous husband. Didn't use the chickpeas since I served it as a side dish. I only did 2 peppers so had lots of couscous mixture left; held half out (before adding feta & tomotoes) and nex day added smoked chicken and a little EVO with the tomatoes & feta for a great lunch. I love double duty recipes

This is a fantastic recipe. I served it with salmon baked in olive oil, S&P, lemon and bit of fennel seed. I ended up using only zuccini and no yellow squash. I also used mixed beans instead of just chick peas (that's all I had in the cupboard). One thing I'd do differently next time is roast the peppers under the broiler for a few minutes after I boil them and before I stuff them.

I've made this recipe as written (tasty!) and with variations (even better) several times. As written, the only changes I'd make are to add some olive oil or butter to the couscous, maybe a little garlic, and to pre-bake the peppers until a little soft instead of boiling (one less pot to wash). If you're using veggie stock or bouillon, make sure it's of primo quality. The best variation I've tried (for a vegan potluck, don't ask) is to replace the oregano and fennel with good curry powder and cumin, and omit the feta entirely. Had to be really heavy-handed with the EVO and salt to make up for the lack of cheese, but it was a huge hit, I had even the picky eaters asking for the recipe.

Rating: 2
It was OK--a little bland. I probably would make it again, just because it is good for you, but I think it needs something else...perhaps tomato paste? Note, this is similar to a Moosewood Recipe (Scheherazade Cassarole) which uses soaked, pulverized soy beans instead of garbonzo beans, and parsley and tomato paste.

I'm not a great cook - but I made this for my fiance last night and it was wonderful---incredibly filling and fairly easy to make. I agree with the other reviewers you can easily fill more than 4 peppers and adding mushrooms was a great touch.

This recipe is great for leftovers. The next day the flavors mellow out a bit and it tastes even better. I make this a lot, generally using smaller peppers (such as poblano) and making a lot more than four stuffed peppers. It's a very easy recipe to vary, I've put in ground sausage, mushrooms, lemon, and white wine in various recipes. The only part I religiously stick to are the garbanzo beans, the couscous and some sort of vegetable.

These were delicious for meatless stuffed peppers. I used red bell peppers fresh from the vine. Made this almost verbatim except that I subbed blue cheese for the feta and cut-up Roma tomatoes for the cherry ones. Omitted the salt. The flavor of the cheese, fennel, beans, and tomato was very different and pleasant. My only complaint is that they turned out a bit soupy, so next time I would use less broth for the couscous or substitute rice. Definitely use MONSTER bell peppers, as I had enough left over filling to make two more large peppers the next night.

Rating: 1
Not on board with this one...I found it dry and crumbly, and the moment you cut into the pepper, everything spills out all over the plate. Can't see the point of that, might as well just sautee the veggies and serve it over the couscous. And somehow, even with all the fabulous flavors here, all I could taste was the bell pepper. I'll stick to my fave stuffing recipe with sausage, parmesan, bread crumbs, and veggies.

Rating: 4
This recipe is delicious!! It is easy to make, and the effort is well worth the results. The only change I made to the recipe was to add some minced garlic and mushrooms to the filling. Doesn't need any additional salt because the feta is salty enough. I made the recipe as is, and it filled 6 large bell peppers with about 1/2 cup filling left over. I served it with a green salad and mushrooms sauteed in white wine and garlic with a touch of cream. We were so full, we couldn't believe this was a vegetarian dish!

This was a really great recipe! I followed the instructions exactly, and I ended up with a LOT more filling then I needed to fill up 4 large peppers--but I'll just use them as leftovers. I used Far East Parmesean couscous, too, and I think that added a nice flavor to it.

Made without oregano or fennel, and 3/4 the amount feta. We used carrots instead of squash and laughed halfway through eating at how such basic ingredients could combine to make a dish this good.
