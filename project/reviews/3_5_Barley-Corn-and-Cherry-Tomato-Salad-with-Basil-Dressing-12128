We made this while on a lake vacation, and it was very easy to throw together. I cooked the barley the night before, and tossed everything together the next day. Basil was not that great at the grocery, so I found an already prepared basil parmesan dressing on the shelf. Next time, if the basil is bad, I would substitute a couple TBS of pesto and mix with the white-wine vinegar and oil. I might also try with farro next time.

I've made this twice and been wowed both times. I add a bit of diced red bell pepper as well for a nice bit of crunch. Also, corn is often so sweet that I don't bother cooking it at all.

I made half the recipe and still had leftovers for a few days! I used frozen corn and hothouse tomatoes (seeded). I would recommend less oil since it seemed a little too oily! Served it will grilled shrimp as suggested to rave reviews!

Really delicious. I made half the recipe, almost exactly as written. The only change I made was to cook the barley in a rice cooker with 3 c. of water to 1 c. of barley. The fresh corn was especially good with the plump chewy barley kernels.

I always cut the barley down to 1 cup, as I find the dish to have a better proportion. I always use canned corn - no harm done. Excellent dish!

I've made this several times and love it -the barley and corn texture is like a party in your mouth. I always grill the corn which adds nice flavor. This time I added some crumbled feta cheese and sliced scallions. Last time, added grilled shrimp. Wonderful!!

A great different salad---never would have thought of barley in a salad though I love it. We enjoyed this more than some of the rice or pasta salads I make with the same type of ingredients. I do use olive oil, though, and have also used lemon juice instead of the vinegar. It is a great summer main dish with leftover chicken or shrimp tossed in! (And chopping in extra basil and herbs is so good too) Endless possibilities.

Absolutely sublime! The aroma of basil lingers deliciously in the house. The sweetness of the basil and the tartness of the tomatoes (I had to use hothouse tomatoes as I was unable to find good cherry tomatoes) suprise the palate.

Simple, refreshing salad with good textures. I added sugar snap peas and I like the idea of adding some chopped basil for a bit more intensity and leafier appearance. I look forward to putting some lightly grilled shrimp or sea scallops on top.

I expected a bit more from this salad. I had great fresh corn and cherry tomatoes and added some fresh green beans as well. The problem was the dressing. A tad too tangy, it really overpowered the sweetness of the corn. I would make a variation on this in the future with a better vinagrette and perhaps some chopped basil.

I really liked this recipe, with a few modifications. I halved the recipe, cooked the barley for only 30 mins (depends I guess) and used Kraft 'herb' salad dressing as I didn't have any vinegar or basil! I served it on a bed of mixed greens and it was a hit.
