Good rolls with great flavour. I had no problem making the dough as instructed. I suspect those who found the dough too wet either are working in humid surroundings or weren't patient enough with kneading. While these rolls aren't show-stoppers, they are so completely head and shoulders above the Pilsbury shortcut suggested by a couple of reviewers. Taste-wise, there'd be absolutely no comparison beween these homemade rolls and a substitute made with packaged dough full of sugar and chemicals.

These have become a Thanksgiving tradition at my house. I love the entire process of making these and they are a definite hit every time they are made. There are rarely enough left over but they are fabulous with leftover turkey and cranberry sauce!

I tend to agree with the previous reviewer - they were good but not great. And for the amount of time and effort, definitely not worth it. I'd go with the previous suggestions and use the Pillsbury crescent rolls. I also thought the dough was very wet and sticky but only had to use about 1/2 cup more flour. It was still slightly sticky after the 1st kneading but didn't add more flour as I didn't want dried out rolls.

This recipe is the textbook definition of "eh". Not great, but not bad and the cutting instructions are just bizarre and not based in any reality that I know. They weren't bad, but they weren't worth the effort. If I were to do this again, I'd get some storebought crescent roll dough and just make the filling.

Pilsbury crescent rolls make this recipie 10x easier. I just fill the rolls with anything I want and voilla! Makes a great appetizer or soup bread.

Is the flour amount in this recipe correct? The dough was so wet and unmanageable that I ended up using at least 2 cups more during the first kneading. They were beautiful looking and tasting though.

I've made this recipe as written many many times. The finished rolls look beautiful and taste delicious. Although they are a favorite side dish for any occaision, I prefer to make the whole batch just for my husband and me. It's the only way we both get to eat enough of them.

Do yourself a favour, buy Pilsbury Crescent dough mix and you can whip up this appetizer in minutes! I cut each triangle into 2 so the recipe made 16 mini appetizers. I've made them for a few parties and my very gourmet guests loved them. I also added some herbs to them.
