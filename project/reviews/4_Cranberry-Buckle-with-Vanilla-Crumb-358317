This is dangerously delicious. Made it with fresh cranberries and it was phenomenal! The whole family loved it. Looking forward to making it again tomorrow for the brunch I'm hosting. Hopefully this time I will have more self-control and eat a little less of it.

A friend of mine made this at our dinner party last night and it was incredible. She used fresh cranberries and followed the recipe exactly - the result was a decadent blend of sweet and tart, moist and crunchy. The perfect ending to a perfect meal!

Made this last nite for friends over for dinner. Wonderful! I had more than 2 C cranberries from the freezer, so just used them all! But my Vanilla Crumb didn't look anything like the photo, nor was it crumbly. Delish desert tho!

this is such a great recipe--it can truly be served any time of day. It works equally well as a coffee cake for breakfast as it does served warm with vanilla ice cream for dessert! I have made this recipe 4-5 times, and it has been wonderful and SO EASY every time. My boyfriend keeps asking me to make it, and most recently I whipped it up last-minute as a birthday cake for one of my best friends. I didn't have enough cranberries, so I subbed a cup of trader joe's very cherry berry blend, and it worked just as well. I served it warm with good vanilla bean ice cream and champagne, and it was surprisingly elegant! I sent my friend and her fiancee home with a couple big chunks and they ate the leftover for breakfast the next day! They even said they loved it so much,they might want to serve buckle for dessert at their wedding ;) The vanilla crumb recipe that goes with this recipe is perfection--I top the buckle with the entire batch of crumb to make it extra buttery and decadent! Why bother saving a half- cup of leftovers?!?!
