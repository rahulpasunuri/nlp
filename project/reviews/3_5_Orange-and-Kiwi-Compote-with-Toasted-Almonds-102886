Have been making this for years but somehow there is no review from me. It is a favorite, so simple and good. Give it a try ...

Very good.Very refreshing.And quick!I thought it was improved by using brown sugar and I added crushed peppercorns to the syrup for a bit more zing.

I can't believe how simple this dessert is to make. I usually shy away from desserts, but I had some extra oranges and kiwis. I will definitely try with bananas next time.

My friend kept telling me how great this recipe was. I finally tried it using bananas as I was out of kiwi, it was great, know it will be great with the kiwis or any fruit you might have on hand.

Excellent spicy flavor. I used canned mandarine oranges (drained) becuase I am lazy about sectioning fruit. It worked great.

this is a delicious and simple dessert, when you want something a little more special than simple fruit salad. be sure to add almonds just before serving, otherwise they'll get soggy.

I prefer cutting the fruits into slices
