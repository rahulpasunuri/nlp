These were great! Had to futz with the dough consistency to get the dough through my "spaetzle hobel". Used less butter in the finishing step. Will definitely make again.

Having never made dumplings, I was skeptical about the 'easy' rating, but this really was quick and easy! Could easily be jazzed up with other herbs and some cheese, but the dumplings were tender and delicious as written. I did add frozen peas at the end to add a little green. Just be sure to use a colander with LARGE holes, it was laborious trying to force the batter through my small colander.

Excellent, and much quicker than I expected. This makes lots. I made half the recipe, and added some extra water so I didn't have to use half an egg. I used some in a chicken soup, and sauteed the leftovers with some chopped onion and topped with melted raclette cheese. Yummy.

These were great! I struggled to find the proper tool to fore them through and finally settled on the large holes of a box grater. Perfecto!

Gave this a four fork rating, mostly because of the exceptional flexibility of this recipe. While I'm sure it is delicious with just dill. I made it with herbs de Provence (does contain some dill). Once cooked I mixed in some peas and lemon zest and topped with brown butter. The recipe came together very quickly (great quick supper). Its easy to see how you could just add your favorite herb/ spice and make it into a whole new dish. Once more, I think it is suitable for a main course or a side. This recipe will defiantly become one in my regular repertoire
