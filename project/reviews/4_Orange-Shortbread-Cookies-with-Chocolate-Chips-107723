These are one of my favorite cookies! The orange and chocolate combination is wonderful. I make them as written except for using a little less chocolate and a smidge more of both the orange zest and extract.

Great cookie if you follow the original directions. Some reviewers used the whites of the egg along with the yolk - I tried this and the flavor was great but the consistency was too cake like (not surprising really). I did make 3 changes: used salted butter (it wasn't too salty), added dried cranberries, instead of choc chips used Ghiradelli double choc melting (for candy) melted with a couple of squares of Dove dark choc, and coated bottom of cookies thinly and allowed to cool on parchment paper - perfection. General tips: use ripe, thin skinned oranges for peel, then juice these and reduce to a syrup instead of extract. 1 small orange will yield about 1 tsp. Enjoy these - they have been very well received by some tough foodies!

In response to comments re lackluster orange flavor, I amended the recipe by omitting the chocolate chips in the dough, chilling and treating as a cut-out, (small hearts, but whatever small shape), filling the baked cookies with a chocolate ganache, then glazing with a simple mix of confectioner's sugar and fresh orange juice. When sprinkled with sugar pearls, they looked quite pretty, and the taste of both the chocolate and orange was pronounced and balanced. People liked them a lot.

One reviewer mentions orange juice. There's orange juice? I'm not seeing it. Eight ounces of chocolate is too much. What is meant is probably 6 ounces chocolate chips, which is a cup, a small package or half a big package. A cup is 8 LIQUID ounces, hence the confusion. I used a moistened glass to flatten the cookies. I make a lot of shortbread, so I know how to handle the dough. These came out like hockey pucks without much orange flavor.

I love the flavor combination of orange + chocolate, so this recipe has become one of my favorites. I used dark chocolate chunks from Whole Foods and added just a touch more orange extract. Good shortbread texture, not too sweet, and great orange flavor. I recommend dividing the dough into three narrow logs, wrapping them in plastic wrap, and chilling until they set. After which, you can easily slice them into 1/2-inch rounds. They come out perfectly shaped and unbelievably delicious!

I love this cookie. I substitued 10% cream - it's what I had on hand. I omitted the chocolate from the dough. Instead I melted dark chocolate in a plastic bag, snipped the corner and drizzled it all over the cookies. I will make this again.

This was a lovely cookie, not too sweet and buttery soft. I adjusted a bit, after reading the reviews, and used 1/2 the amount of Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips, a whole egg, and at some point (after making several batches), ran out of zest and just doubled up on the orange juice...no problem with the batter with the extra liquid. The zest is essential for that extra zip of citrus, though. Baked 14-15 minutes. Great recipe and so easy to make.

Wonderful! I used a tangerine instead of an orange for the peel, but still used orange extract. (The oranges looked really droopy yesterday. . . . ) Also, I used a whisk after I beat in the flour, and I think a spoon would have been easier as I had to smoosh out all the batter that was stuck in the whisk. So after you add the flour and beat it with a mixer, add the chocolate chips and use a spoon or something similar! :-) I brought these to a party and they were a hit! Also, I have an electric oven and had to have the cookies in for the 18 minutes, but it's always good to check just in case.

I thought this made an exceptional cookie in a very short time. Just enough orange flavor. Not too sweet, not too mealy.

Wow, these were so average. Very disappointing. The batter was good, but the texture of the cookies was very unsatisfying - dry and crumbly instead of rich and buttery. Not sure what's wrong. I was careful not to work the dough too much, and the only adjustments I made were to use a whole egg instead of a yolk, and I decreased the cooking time to 14 minutes, taking them out while they were still golden. Not worth the effort.

I will defiantly make these again. As others suggested, I used a whole egg. Although I really like bittersweet chocolate WAY better than semisweet, I wanted small chips, so I used the mini semisweet. I reduced the juice of one orange to almost nothing and used that instead of the orange extract. I also used a small ice cream scoop, flattened them slightly and cooked them 13 minutes. Yield was about 40 cookies. My neighbor came by about half an hour after they came out of the oven and ate several. I think this recipe is a keeper. Since I have so many oranges on my tree now, I think I'll freeze zest and reduced juice, so I can make them when my tree isn't helping me cook.

amazing...the comination of chocolate and orange is one of my favorites! I only used about three chocolate chips per cookie so as not to overpower the orange flavor and they were a hit!

I loved these! I had some blood oranges around the house, so I grated the peel and used the juice of about half an orange instead of orange extract. I used a whole egg, about 6 oz. of Guittard semi-sweet chocolate chips, and baked for 14 minutes. The results were fabulous.

Even though the orange and chocolate were a nice combination, I wasn't thrilled with this cookie. It had a nice crisp crunch to it but was really nothing remarkable. I thought for sure I would love this!

Originally, I made this recipe when I saw the high percentage (94%) that would make this again. Upon making the recipe, I decided to reread the comments to see if anyone else had trouble with the cooking time. I was surprised to see how many people didn't really think these cookies were all that fabulous. I cooked the first batch for the recommended 18 minutes and they were a little bit brown. The next batch I cooked for 14 minutes and they were perfect - absolutely delightful. I used 12 oz. semisweet chips and a 4 oz. bar of bittersweet, broken up into bits. I also used orange oil in place of the extract. My husband thought these were wonderful!

I too agree with the other reviewers who feel that adding the whole egg is probably going to yield a better texture than just the yolk. And also, I'll bake them a bit less next time - waiting for them to turn golden is a mistake. Not my favorite shortbread cookie recipe overall.

Rating: 3
Considering how subtle the orange flavour is, I think the recipe calls for way too much chocolate. I didn't stir the chips into the batter; I used a small cookie scooper to make half-domes, flattened them, and then put a single chip in the centre of each round - I think this worked well. I thought the cookies were unexceptional but they got rave reviews from others, so I probably will make them again.

Made these this morning...love them! I too used OJ in place of extract as well as mini chips. Also had to use half & half since I didn't have heavy cream...will try a batch with the cream and see if it makes a difference. Great flavor.

Very nice cookie - great combination of flavours. I used mini chips for more even disbursement through the dough (and smaller hits of chocolate!).

Rating: 2
The orange and chocolate are a nice combination of flavorings, but I think the batter is unexceptional. A previous reviewer suggested leaving out the chips and dipping the cookies into melted chocolate instead, and I think that would be a good idea. This cookie needs a lot of chocolate to make it worthwhile. Next time, I'll try another reviewer's suggestion of leaving in the egg white in the batter.

everybody at work thought these were delicious. i used the large ghirradeli choc chips but will probably use the smaller ones next time because they were pretty sweet. big hit though

Outstanding! As other reviews commented, they are better the day after making them. I, too, fiddled with the chocolate quantity as I live in an area of the Balkans where chocolate chips are hard to come by, so much less double chocolate chips, so I just chop up bittersweet chocolate bars and that seems to do the trick. My husband raves about these and curses me when I make them (he's supposed to be low carb, but can't manage to stay on his diet if these are in the house).

I had four people ask me for the recipe after I brought these in to work, where they promptly disappeared. I only made some changes to the method - one, roll dough into balls, then flatten on baking sheet; two, use parchment paper to line ungreased baking sheets, with no mess and no fuss. The cookies definitely taste better the next day, as the orange and chocolate flavours really meld by then. It is worth finding the double-chocolate chips, as dark chocolate is a better match for the orange flavour than semisweet chocolate. The taste of the cookies is very similar to a Droste chocolate orange. Yummy!

What they lacked in presentation, they made up for in flavor - a little unexpected.

very good. excellent combination of flavors, nice, elegant cookie. I made them small and found they looked nicer by rolling them into small 1/2 - 3/4 " balls - then flaten with a moistened glass to about 1/2" - they look nicer afterall and are a nice bitesize cookie that way. Next time I may try forming them into ovals and instead of putting chips in the batter - dipping one end in Bittersweet chocolate for an elegant presentation. Don't overbake-they need not look brown, just golden on bottom.

Chocolate and orange are one of my favorite flavor combinations. So, after reading all the various reviews I made the cookies. So sorry to say I really didn't care for them. I used the mini chips...only 4 ounces and that was quite enough...orange extract and fresh orange peel. Just didn't feel the cookie was that outstanding.

These cookies are DIVINE!! You can make them without using the orange extract, depends on how orange-y you want them. Don't skimp on the orange rind tho! Definitely use the double chips but stick to the 8 ounces, I used a 12-oz bag which made the dough a little too crumbly. They were still great, tho!

First, I left out the chocolate chips and melted bittersweet chocolate and spread it on top (I'm not that fond of chips in my cookies). Also, I used dehydrated orange peel because I didn't have any oranges (and I was feeling lazy). Now the review: When I first tasted one (after cooling but chocolate was still wet), I didn't like it. I got little bits of orange peel in my mouth, and the flavor wasn't anything to write home about. I was going to give it only one fork. However, after 3-4 hours, I ate another bite, and was pleasantly surprised. The flavors melded and the now-solidified chocolate didn't overpower the shortbread. The next day, they're even better. I don't recommend the dry orange peel, and next time I'll try fresh, and maybe try to find a more natural orange flavoring.

I doubled the recipe to make pan cookies instead of individual rounds, which I think resulted in a softer texture. Next time I'll make them as is, since I prefer the crispy edges. I found that less than half the recommended amount of chocolate chips was sufficient.

These cookies have a nice orange flavor. I would leave out the orange extract next time....it smells like baby aspirin not like true orange essence. I would also decrease the amount of chocolate and use mini chocolate chips, the regular size ones seem to overwhelm the dough. All in all, a nice cookie well-liked by everyone.
