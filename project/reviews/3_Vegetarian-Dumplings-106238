MSG? Really? Absolutely not. There are better/healthier ways to add flavor.

This is a good recipe to use if you have to use up cabbage. Very tasty.

Great recipe, except I wouldn't bother with the rice noodles. I don't care for the texture in the dumplings. I don't personally use MSG b/c I can't be bothered to go out and purchase it, but people should be aware of the fact that recent scientific reports (i.e. from the past half-decade) confirm this is a harmless flavoring ingredient. The anecdotal evidence of its "dangers" has been inconsistent and studies trying to demonstrate CRS have given unreproducible (and invalid) results.

I'd never believe that you would post a recipe with MSG, that poison should be off the somkt shelves and not on any ones food preparation. The recipe is really good -MSG

It was very nice, i cut down on the mushrooms because i hate mushrooms and used more deep fried shredded up firm tofu instead of dried bean curd. The whole thing tasted great and the tofu was really chewy...

I have made these several times. The biggest problem that I had at the beginning was in getting the pleats right. It takes some practice. I also prefer what a friend of mine calls the "fry/steam" method where I put some peanut oil in a large pan, fry the dumplings for a few minutes, then pour in about 2/3 a cup of water, put a lid on and let sit for 12 minutes, take the cover off til the water is gone. They are great that way. I also prefer to serve with a mixture of white vinegar and Asain hot sauce with seeds in it. Also, you can buy GREAT wrappers on Canal St in NYC for $1.00 (for like 100 of em)!! Go to Kam Man at 200 Canal Street (nr. Baxter)

We make this every day here in Chinatown East (Flushing) NYC. Use bean sprout. Be very careful when buying and cooking curd, it really doesn't belong. Chinese Black should never be used with curd, as it will usually sicken most. And MSG, are you nuts??? Why don't you sicken everyone? Die-say-ah
