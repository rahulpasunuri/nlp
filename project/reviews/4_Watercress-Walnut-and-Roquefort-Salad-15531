i decided to make it primarily an endive salad - omitted the cress and added slices of ripe pear. after all, pears, blue cheese and walnuts is a classic combo. the dressing wasn't Wow, but it did the job. i had trouble with caramelizing the walnuts - in the end, i used my usual method which was just to melt sugar in a saucepan and toss in the walnuts.

I added sliced bosc pears. It was really a delicious and gorgeous salad. Perfect Fall first course. Definitely a stunner. Will make again and again!

Excellent, flavorful salad! I used pecans instead, and it was delicious. Everyone had seconds. Make sure the roquefort is well chilled or its goopy.

Marvelous salad. The dressing is delicious - light and piquant. The candied walnuts are so easy to make. I agree with the young man's comment -- it is indeed a "party in your mouth". I used a combination of endive and butter lettuce. Worked great.

Loved the walnuts and the dressing. I thought this salad was amazing but my husband thought it was just good. The roquefort dominates the flavors so don't make this if you don't like that cheese.

Wonderful salad--easy to make. Variation: Add a tablespoon or two of honey to the dressing and julienned jicama and baby spinach to the salad.

Excellent salad. I can't find watercress here, so I used a combination of mache and arugula. I made the dressing ahead of time (about 4 hours) and it broke and I had a really difficult time getting it to emulsify again, so I would suggest saving the dressing for just before serving, it wasn't difficult.

awesome. roquefort cheese is expensive. you could get away with using blue if you want to save $$.

Fantastic recipe. I have used this many times and anytime I wanted to start a great meal with a big hit . Always receive raves All the components work so well together. As a change of pace add diced apples

Superb ! I made this an an appetizer last night for dinner, made a little subsitution and additon, not a great fan of roquefort cheese so instead I took a pre made crepe placed it in a skillet with a little butter placed the cheese inside in little crubles, flipped the crepe in half until cheese melted and served in on top of the salad.

Great "master Recipe" for the caramelized nuts!

This is one of those recipes that firmly illustrates the concept that a dish can be very simple and yet delicious. It is just the perfect melding of flavors and I still love it, even after making it about six times in the last month. Every time we are invited to dinner, my husband volunteers us for the salad course, and I am allowed to make NOTHING but this recipe. Give it a try, it will not disappoint.

Wow!!! This is wonderful! I doubled the walnuts, as suggested by other users. My only caution would be not to serve it with highly seasoned foods (too much flavor competition). Everyone went back for seconds of this. I love my son's comment, as he para-quoted: "It's like there is a party in my mouth, and everyone's invited!" This salad is a wonderful marriage of flavors. You won't be sorry you tried it!

My husband and I both rate this a superb recipe for a salad. However, I subsituted the watercress for fresh baby spinach leaves and added some bacon crumbles. The walnuts were surprisingly easy to caramelize. This salad is an incredible addition to any meal.

Whoa, Baby! I doubled the walnut mixture, used fresh baby spinach instead of watercress and endive...is it okay to eat this everyday, for each meal?? LOL

I took this to a new year's eve party (quadroupled the amounts plus additional walnuts) and EVERYONE wanted the recipe. I e-mailed it to them via Epicourious!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I added roasted red peppers and grape tomatoes adding them to the package of lettuce I purchased at the grocery store. I added a hint of brown sugar to the sugar substance - I could have eaten every walnut in the bowl before adding them to the salad. This is a great salad with lots of different flavors and textures! A keeper for sure.

My boyfriend doesn't like watercress nor endive. He thinks they are bitter. However, when I put the dressing on, he raved about it and ate it all.

I would definitely make this salad again. I did double the caramelized walnut ingredients..I would even go as far as tripling it! But I do love sweets. I have already passed this on to several friends! Loved it!

Every time I make this, I recieve RAVE reviews. I always double the amount of walnuts, and immerse the greens in icy water so they are very crisp. This is a wonderful winter salad.

This is awesome, but leave out the salt (or just use a sprinkle) on the carmelized walnuts

This is an excellent recipe that is fairly easy to make. We did add more walnuts though--the amount the recipe called for just didn't seem like enough for 4 people--and it made the salad perfect!

Very good salad. The dressing cleans the palate and the cheese makes it perfect for eating with a glass of wine.
