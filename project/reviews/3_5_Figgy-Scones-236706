This is my second review of this recipe. This time I made it gluten-free by using arrowhead GF baking mix. I substituted the mix for the flour and baking powder. I did add baking soda. My soda might be old, but next time I'd add more powder as well, as they came out a bit flatter than usual. The crumb is not as flaky, either - it's more fine like cake - but was still delicious and allowed my husband to enjoy them! I also used dates this time, as I had them on hand. I also doubled the maple syrup and cut the sugar in half - this makes them very rich.

i would agree with 'greybanks' and reduce the sugar and up the maple syrup. the maple flavor was nearly nonexistent. i also steeped the figs in hot water and a little honey after i chopped them for about 5 minutes. the figs would have been a bit too tough and chewy had i not done that.

Mine were only in the oven for 15 min and they're burned! My oven is accurate so keep an eye on them.

Made these again this year and was impressed again. The texture is amazing! I mix the butter into the flour with my hands, maybe that makes a difference? I know that having the butter really cold and leaving some lumps is important to get the right texture. I measure mine out with a 1/4 cup measure and have found the time and temp to be spot on for perfectly baked scones.

This is the best scone recipe I've ever made! I have to assume the reviewer rating one fork didn't make it exactly as written. I've used Calmyrna figs, Mission figs, and this year I am using currants because our grocery ran out of all types of figs (snow storm). I'm not that great of a baker, but these always turn out for me. I only make these once a year for Christmas morning, and I look forward to them all year!

Very good when made as directed. Though I didn't have dried figs on hand, so I used dates, which actually complement the maple flavor much more strongly anyhow. The maple is not prominent enough though, and in the future I think I'll reduce the sugar and increase the maple syrup. I didn't mix the dates in the dough either, but rather to get it in the center, I simply placed half the dough on the parchment, covered with dates, and the covered that with more dough, and they came out just as pictured.

Excellent. really easy to make, creamy, and the fig/maple combo was delicious. My family was fighting over the last ones!

A marvellous recipe, extremely tasty and kept well for a week in an air tight container. The texture and taste were truely delightful, I did not get much maple taste though so will add a little extra next time to try and achieve the right balance for me.

I have a question -- do you really just mix the figs into the scone batter? In the picture, it seems as though the figs are in the middle of the scone, but the recipe calls to just mix everything together. Do the figs somehow "migrate" to the middle of the scone or are the figs throughout the scone???

These scones came out great and were easy to prepare! I did not have a problem with burning, either, though my scones took longer to bake because I made them bigger than the recipe suggested. Perhaps the sheet pan was very dark and that caused the scones to burn?

These were delicious and easy to make. I even mixed the ingredients in the wrong order, and they still came out great. Didn't have parchment, so I used a piece of a brown grocery bag. Stuck to the paper a little, but browned nicely.

These turned out great. I don't know what happened for the previous reviewer - maybe you should calibrate your oven? I wouldn't think parchment paper would make that kind of difference. I did use Silpat liners instead of parchment and they browned beautifully. I rotated the pans to bottom and front to back at 10 minutes and took them out at 20, and they were beautifully browned. Nice subtle maple flavor makes these not too sweet. I love figs - I happened to have dried black mission around so used those instead of the calmyra, but I bet it would be great either way. Highly recommend these. I love scones and make them regularly - the process is really pretty easy and this recipe is no exception.

Is 400 really right or did they burn because I didn't have parchment. I greased my pans and the scones were burning around 15 minutes. They didn't really puff, more like spread out. Perhaps this is all due to lack of parchment, but I doubt it.
