Didn't have quite enough parsley, but had some leftover homemade pesto that I added just so we could use it and because it ruined the color. These were a fun presentation and were flavorful, but I can't seem to get over how much I love the Caramelized Shallot Mashed Potatoes from this site. :)

I thought that this was a tasty recipe. A little twist on classic mashed potatoes. I used yellow onions instead of green onions and I added dill when I was seasoning it at the end. I would make these again.

I made this for a St. Patrick's day dinner - everyone loved them. I made them an hour ahead and then put them in the crockpot.
