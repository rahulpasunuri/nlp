this is more of a straight cornbread recipe than a corn muffin, since, like the other cook mentioned, there was no sweet ingredident. And just for the record, many Southern cornbread recipes do not have any type of sweet ingredient. As a matter of fact, my favorite recipe uses a bit of bacon grease for flavor - that one is for special occasions only!

Added 1/2 cup sugar, 1 and 1/2 cups of shredded cheese (Mexican mix) and 1/2 tsp of tobasco. They looked and tasted lovely next to a winter stew of lentils and pork.

I should have realized something was missing here: a bit of sweetness. Most cornbread recipes use a bit of sugar or honey. Not this one, and thus quite disappointing. I liked the moistness from the buttermilk and the color from the pimentos so will improvise next time with a bit of sweet, but would not recommend as is.
