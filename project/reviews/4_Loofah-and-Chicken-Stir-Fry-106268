This was tasty and the sauce went so well with rice! I substituted the loofah with fresh sugar peas and ommitted the mushrooms, adding thinly sliced carrots instead. Cant wait to make it again!

Excellent Chinese dish! The whole family enjoyed it. I used very hot Thai peppers , but used half the amount. Otherwise, made it as stated. Definitely will make again. Found the loofah (also called Chinese okra) at Whole Foods.

This is my standard stir-fry base. I substitute whatever vegies I have on hand for the loofah/shitakes. I haven't tried beef/pork in place of the chicken but I'm sure it's great too. I use the black bean sauce with chili and garlic and skip adding the chilis (but I still add the garlic). It still has a tiny kick but it isn't too spicy for my children. Yum!

Very good. It will take me a long time to use the Chinese fermented black beans that I bought for another recipe on this site-but so far everything I've made with them we've liked. The loofah is definitely an unusual vegetable, but very good - thank goodness for Whole Foods and their selection of produce!

I couldn't purchase the loofah so I tried it with regular okras. Big mistake, they became very slimy and ruined the entire dish. Yet I gave this recipe three forks because it was otherwise very good.

Definitely make this outstanding recipe! The loofah adds the perfect flavor and texture. For those unfamiliar (like I was), loofah looks like a big, foot-long okra with pronounced ridges running lengthwise. It was sitting in a bin that was not labeled in English when I found it. I used 6 mushrooms, not 3. Chop the beans slightly to spread them throughout the recipe. I did not use zucchini -- seems like a watery addition. Thinly sliced red bells were great, though. Enjoy

Thanks to my cuz from O'ahu I also used the zucchini. I was just making this recipe with what I had. I used salted beans, teriyaki sauce and red chilli peppers. And it still turned out great! Hawaiian chilli peppers would really light it up. Oyster sauce probably better. I also used some black bean sauce at the end with the cornstarch.

I used zucchini instead of loofah and was very good. I doubled the chicken and the cooking sauce but kept everything else the same. Turned out really good. I'll try this recipe with lobster and add bell peppers, onions, and black mushrooms and double the fermented black beans. Should be a winner.
