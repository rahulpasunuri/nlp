So easy and my son loves it. You can flavor the melted butter with hot sauce. Reminds me of my childhood.

So easy! Will never buy microwave popcorn again.

Great- but I only had olive oil, which smoked as it popped... Hee hee good thing I read the recipe! Like everyone else, I know how popcorn happens but wasn't sure about the particulars... whether to add oil before or after popping, how high the heat should be, etc. I would have added about 3 cups of kernels if I hadn't read the recipe, and had it coming out the windows!

This recipe was a revelation, having grown up with "jiffy pop" and microwave popcorn. Followed instructions exactly and had evenly cooked, perfect popcorn in a couple of minutes.

I need to bring popcorn to my daughter's preschool this week. I need to make the popcorn the night before and place it into individual serving bags. Any tips on how to keep it crisp and tasting good for 12 plus hours? Also suggestion on the type of bags to use? (I would like to use the wax paper sandwhich bags -- trying to make them compostable. )

Love homemade popcorn. I think peanut oil is the best choice, dome unsalted butter, and a little popcorn salt (really finely ground salt) and you are all set. Also it is best to keep your popcorn kernels in the refrigerator after the jar is opened.

As some previous reviewers suggested, I mixed the oil with the popping corn and added them to the pan together. It turned out great! I would have never known how to make popcorn if not for a recipe, so I'm so glad to have found this one!

Wide bottom pan makes for quicker popping but also allows the popped corn to start burning before the remaining kernals have popped. Also, type of oil affects the taste of popcorn to a small degree. Will try coconut oil which an earlier reviewer also recommended.

I use a grease screen instead of a lid on the pan. This lsts out steam and makes for a crisper corn.

Thank you, Gourmet, for including basic recipes like this. Like the previous poster, I'd forgotten how to make popcorn. Homemade is so much better.

I had forgotten how to make popcorn!! This recipe provided perfect fluffy crisp popcorn. It being sweltering hot here, I used salt, lime and tabasco to flavor with ice cold beer on the side- Delicious!!!

I grew up with an air popper, and it recently broke. Now I don't have to suffer with microwave popcorn! If you use cast iron (I used a Le Creuset 3-1/2 quart stock pot), make sure you don't have the dishwasher running, it'll be hard to hear the popping! Throw the popcorn into a paper bag, drizzle a few tablespoons butter on top, sprinkle on a teaspoon or so of salt, close the bag, shake a bunch, and then pour into a big bowl.

I took the Washington, DC reviewer's advice and added oil and popcorn together. Med-high heat, shaking the pan the whole time. Worked great. I used canola oil, but have used olive oil in a pinch. I like canola better. I use white popping corn. I think it's more tender than yellow.

I agree with previous reviewers in that I had never made popcorn from scratch before. I assumed it was more complicated and time consuming that it actually was and once you consider the superior taste of fresh popped to microwave popcorn (not to mention the number of microwave kernals that never pop, how easy it is to burn and the cost), I don't think I'll ever go back to the microwave version. It really only saves two or three minutes time anyway - big deal. I followed earlier suggestions to shake from the beginning and I had only one or two kernals that didn't pop. The kids loved it and enjoyed the experience.

Since I did not grow up in the age of stove-popped popcorn. Seeing as I have never done popcorn this way, I found the recipe helpful. I know it is not advanced, or glamourous. Not everyone here comes from the same background. I'm so sorry that we're not all completely versed in all things food. I'll be sure to shame my parents for neglecting me in such an horrible manner. Heh. People should not be ashamed for not knowing everything.

Actually, I wanted to know if there are better brands or varieties of corn, and if it works better to add the kernels to hot oil, or to heat the oil and corn together. The recipe above is too basic to be useful. My corn pops too small, but is delicious when popped in a generous combination of butter and coconut oil. Grapeseed oil is very good, but olive oil is too rich.

Because it is nearly impossible to find microwave popcorn here, we bought some 'regular' popcorn. Although I ate it this way when I was younger I had no idea how to make it. So I started looking through some of the recipe websites, skipping epicurious because I thought this recipe was too simple. but you know what, this was the only place I could find it!! This website never ceases to amaze me. I appreciate the whole range of recipes they offer here and I am very grateful.

Absolutely agree that stove/pot popped popcorn is the only way to eat popcorn. The taste does not compare. I bought a pot to cook popcorn in and have NEVER gone back to microwave. In the same time you can pop in a machine, you can have fresh popped, delicious popcorn! Besides, as others have stated, it brings back so many memories of childhood.

I appreciate the easy AND the complicated recipies at this site. Although others may feel this type of recipie is ridiculous, I disagree: I haven't made any type of popcorn except microwave style for years & came to Epicurious to see how others enjoy it and to experiment with their suggestions. That, to me, is what this site is all about and why I enjoy it so much.

gee what a concept,can't wait until they post a recipe for microwave popcorn!what a treat that'll be...

This is actually an "old school" method of popcorn popping. You get great results (most kernels popped, biggest pieces)if you add the oil and the popcorn at the same time, and cooking over medium-hi heat. The key is shaking (distributing the heat) from the beginining--not just when it starts popping. We have homemade popcorn almost every Friday with a home video.

This receipe is WAY too complicated. I think you should keep complex recipes like this one to yourselves. Some of us aren't master chefs, I hope ya know.

This is the only way to make popcorn (add a little salt and perfection).... I can't imagine it any other way. Who likes that microwave stuff anyhow?

I agree, popcorn made this way is the only way to enjoy true old-fashion popcorn. I grew up on popcorn made in a popcorn popper. Microwave popcorn tastes stale and over-loaded with unhealthy salt and fat. I also love the smell of fresh popcorn. Making it by scratch just takes a little longer than putting a bag in the microwave, along with costing far less than the microwave packages.

This is the ONLY way to enjoy popcorn. I even have a pan that is used solely for this delicious treat. Microwave popcorn is nothing more than chewy, salty, flavorless stuff that merely looks like popcorn. Does anyone know what that stuff is that they call "butter" on microwave popcorn?

I'm sure not many will make this in the age of microwave popcorn, but it's a great throw-back to the way my mom used to make it. Add butter and salt and it's popcorn heaven.
