BEST TASTEN RIB I EVER MADE.... ADD SOME SPICED RUM TO YOUR BBQ SAUCE, WHAT A DIFFERENCE.

I like this rub, think it has good balance between sweet and savory. Since it's sort of a drag to maintain proper temp on my Q for hours, I like to cook them 2/3 of the way in the oven at about 175, them finish them over wood. Ill give it 3 (4 is for the Holy Grail of Ribs)

Not sure what the previous reviewer did wrong (maybe used table salt intead of the course grain salt called for?) but I followed the recipe exactly and it came out excellent. I'll use this rub often.

The sauce was great. The method was great. The rub (Basic Barbecue Rub referenced in the recipe)was so unspeakably salty I had to pitch these puppies out. Yuck.

I used a rib rack & apple juice previously. Highly recommend using both, i use a 50/50 mix of water and apple juice in a spray bottle, misting the ribs about every 15-20 minutes. Meat falls off the bone. Usually try to keep the temp between 275-300 degrees on my gas grill. Ribs turn out awesome!!!
