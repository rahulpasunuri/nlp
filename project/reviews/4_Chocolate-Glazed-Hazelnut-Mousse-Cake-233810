I made this cake for Thanksgiving, thinking how can a combination of Nutella and mascarpone not be delicious? It came out well and was easy to make. My springform pan would not attach to the base when inverted, so I omitted that step without any issues. I did not have any problems with the ganache as several others noted. I followed the reviews of several others and used Frangelico in place of the cold water. The mousse did not have a very strong hazelnut flavor, and I imagine it would be undetectable if water were used. This dessert lacked any "Wow Factor" though at the table. It was easily upstaged by my apple pie. It was just okay. I would make the mousse again to be used in another dessert, however I would not make this cake again.

This cake was very good and easy to prepare. It did have a few ingredients that I don't normally have on hand, such as the mascarpone and the larger amt of heavy cream. But that's not really a big deal. The crust was very good, as was the mousse. I used 2x the amount of heavy cream because I read the recipe wrong, but it was fine. I didn't drizzle it down the side, just spread it across the top. I'm betting it would have been a bit firmer if I had let it chill longer. The mousse was chilling for only 2 hours, then I put on the ganache and chilled it for another hour. Longer would have been better, but I ran out of time. Everyone said it was good, and they could taste the hazelnuts. If I make it again, I might make a hazelnut praline for a garnish, just sprinkle it on top. And definately chill for at least 3 hours. I gave it 3 stars because it was good, but not OMG thisisSOgood. Maybe after chilling it longer and the praline it'll earn the 4 stars.

Made this for a friend's birthday and all agreed it was terrific -- and, of course, it's easy. So good I'm making another one for a dinner this week. No problems with glaze -- just don't let it cool too much.

This was superb. Fancy, easy, insanely yummy...I'll definitely make it again. Reading the recipe, I was worried my arm would fall off with all the whisking, but it was actually very little exertion (especially compared to some mousse recipes, where you whisk and whisk and whisk!). My only issue was the ganache. It was delicious, of course, but it was too thick for the drip-down-the-sides effect to look anything but stupid. I even put in a 1/2 cup heavy cream instead of the 1/3 cup that the recipe calls for. I'd say, if you use it as written, simply don't go for a drippy look - just top the cake cleanly with ganache. If you DO want that luscious-looking dribble-down effect, look elsewhere for a looser ganache recipe. Still - it's not like anyone cared (or knew!) that my cake didn't look like the picture...EVERYONE had seconds and my little brother said he loved it even though he doesn't usually like sweets. Score!

Have made this a couple times now and it is one of my favorite cakes ever. But I always seem to have trouble with the ganache. It's too thick to pour nicely and this time it separated and became ugly and oily. (Found out too late that I should have added cold cream to fix it.) Still tasted good though. A secret: I didn't bother rubbing off the hazelnut skins, and it didn't make a bit of difference.

My husband loves mousse cakes and this is one he requests a lot. I love that it's easy and the results are so yummy. I often use different cakes as the base, there is room for experimentation with the base at least. If you like Nutella this is a great easy mousse to try.

Rating: 4
this recipe was a major success, although with several changes: 1. i used more ground hazelnuts in the crust (replacing about 1/4 of the flour, plus ground chocolate cookies for another 1/4 of the flour) 2. i doubled the recipe as many others suggested, using a slightly larger springform pan. 3. i used espresso to thin the ganache and make it more pourable. that flavor really added something. 4. oh, and i used 2 sheets of gelatin in place of the powdered gelatin. delicious!

Rating: 4
Amazing! The annoying part was skinning the hazelnuts (which i boiled with baking soda-it's easier than baking). I also added more Nutella, and substituted Frangelico for cold water for more hazelnut flavor. Then added a bit more gelatin to even out the extra Nutella. If you like Nutella, you are going to love this cake! Did I mention that it's super easy and so good that everyone thought that I bought it!

Amazing dessert, doubled and adjusted the ingredients as suggested by previous reviewers. Also made the crust out of brownie that I cut and pressed into the springform pan then brushed with hazelnut liquer....amazing. Light and flavorful, this was requested for a birthday party and didn't last long. Sounds difficult but actually pretty easy to make and worth every minute of time it takes.

I made this as our New Years Day finale...like others here I too doubled the ingrediants. It is show stopper in my book. The only thing I would do different in the future, would be to use a different base recipe, or watch it more carefully as it was really hard to cut. Needed to be fork tender I think. Otherwise it was delicious!

I could only find coffee-flavored mascarpone at my local grocery, so I used it and found it provided an additional depth of flaver. When (not if) I make this again I'll look for the flavored mascarpone or sff a little instant espresso. Agree that "extra" Nutella adds.

i made this cake when it first came out in 2006 in the magazune and have made it quite a few times(once for a group of 80 people and they all loved it. It is a favorite every time I make it. It is one recipe that I do not want to loose. I changed the base a few times and my favorite is with a brownie base then I sprinkle it with a fruit flavored syrup, it taste great. Thank you.

I didn't care for the shortbread base as written, so I changed it the second time I made the cake. I used a chocolate wafer cookie crust (similar to a graham cracker crust) and added the toasted hazelnuts. The creamy filling contrasted nicely with the cookie crust. I also doubled the filling. It was delicious.

This is a fabulous cake - amazingly easy to make, and incredibly delicious! The combination of the fudgy ganache, velvety smooth chocolate/hazelnut mousse, and the crunch and slight saltiness in the crust makes every bite seem like a little journey to nirvana! I've made it many times and to rave reviews. No revisions necessary!

Loved this dessert. I've made it several times and my modifications to make it more intense were to put the entire 10oz container of Nutella instead of the half cup called for, I also doubled the mascarpone (adding the entire 8 oz container) but I didn't double the whipped cream adding only the required one and a half cup to make the nutella taste more predominant (otherwise I found it was a little weak and I LOVE NUTELLA). Oh, and of course I also doubled the gelatine to compensate for the other ingredients increased. Not only has everyone I've made this dessert for raved, but I've even gotten responses like, "we used to have other favorite desserts but this one tops the list now". Happy cooking.

This was delicious and easy to make. I also doubled everything and the presentation was excellent. I used hazelnut liquer instead of water for the gelatin. The chocolate was a little thick so I used a beater to add the first third of cream then folded the remaining cream in.I made the glaze ahead of time and then warmed it up in the microwave and topped each piece with the glaze instead of over the whole cake.

The cake was awesome! When making, I had no problems. Using already grinded hazelnuts, I skipped the toasting and skin- rubbing part. For the mousse, we only had leaf gelatine at home, so I used 2 leaves instead of 1 teaspoon. Everything else worked out perfectly. What I would suggest is to double the whole recipe. When I did it the first time I thought the cake's rather small, but doubling it later it looked delicious, exactly like the photograph! Would make it always again, and that's a rarity in my case!

What an amazing cake! I must be honest. I'm not a fan of hazelnuts, so I replaced hazelnuts in this with vanilla extract (no beans on hand). That said, the cake was perfect in every other way. The texture was beautiful and the crust was perfectly matched. For those of you unable/unwilling to get mascarpone, you can easily replace it with an equal amount of Philadelphia Whipped Cream Cheese.

Fantastic!! I served this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I didn't have a springform pan, so I made it in a glass pie plate.

Seems I can't update my review from before. I just wanted to mention that if you let the cake sit in the fridge for a few days, the bottom layer absorbs the moisture from the mousse and gets soft so it's dry and crunchy.

Rating: 4
This cake is definitely the way to go when you want to impress. It looks beautiful, and you'll win them over with the first bite. A made a couple minor tweaks, because I needed the cake to travel. I doubled the ganache recipe and poured it over with the sides still on the springform pan, then refrigerated it all. The ganache turned into a hard, but still cutable with a fork, topping. I also ignored the steps about turning the base of the pan over. It seemed fussy and unneccessary. I lined the bottom with parchment and it came out fine. The crust didn't come together for me either while in the food processor, but I just dumped it into the pan and pressed it out that way and it was fine. I'll definitely be making this again.

Rating: 3
Tried the tweaks of doubling the bottom and 1.5x the rest and using Frangelico, but found the bottom far too hard. The next time, I'm going to use a brownie recipe for the bottom or deliberately under cook the bottom in this recipe by 1/2 time so it isn't so dry and crunchy (doubling it only emphasized that it was dry and crunchy)...maybe brushing it w/ a water/sugar/frangelico mixture would have helped moisturize it as well. I also overcooled the ganache despite cooling it for only 15min...I'd suggest 10min. The mousse and ganache taste great and it's easy to add extra decorations to the top w/ chopped hazelnuts and raspberries.

Rating: 4
I made this as part of a special date night dinner for my husband and I. Most importantly, this recipe has made it into my collection of favorites with the very first bite, it was amazing! My springform pan is 9" instead of 8" as suggested so the shortbread base was spread thin. Before trying to get it pressed in the pan, I had to add a little vanilla to the dough to get it to come together as it was a little on the dry side but having made a shortbread many many times it was quick and easy fix. I think next time I make this I might try doubling the crust recipe and using 1 1/2 recipes as the crust and the rest to make a small cookie decoration. The mousse was amazing! Rich and creamy, chocolatey and just sweet enough. I can't say I'd change a thing, it was great! This was a beautiful, rich, and delicious dessert that I definitely plan on making again and again.

Rating: 2
All my guests loved this, but I found it a bit lacking. I like a little more heft to my mousses - one that's creamy rather than just fluffy. And seemed to lack flavor overall, even with the addition of Frangelico. I would recommend doubling the shortcake portion for some texture contrast. As for the ganache, I think first-time ganache makers could use some more detailed instruction. Mine came out curdled, and I had to remake it twice before it finally came out smooth, though not liquid enough to be porable.

Rating: 4
outstanding. Only rave reviews. Followed the suggestions and used a 9" springform with double the crust recipe and 1&1/2 the mousse. Also substituted frangelica for the water and sprinkled the periphery of the ganache topping with crushed toasted hazelnuts. Thanks to all for all the helpful hints.

I've made this a couple of times now. It really is delicious. As far as hazelnut flavour goes, I agree with everyone about using Frangelico. I used it instead of water, to melt the gelatin.

Very good recipe. This cake is beautiful (just as shown in the magazine) and delicious. I used organic ingredients, French salted butter and "Ghirardelli 70% Cacao Extra Bittersweet" chocolate. For the icing , instead of heavy cream only, I used mostly milk and a little bit of heavy cream; the result was perfect, making the cake lighter. I can't wait to make this cake again!

This is the best thing that I have tasted in as long as I can remember. Seriously. It's so good. I'm sure I will make it again and again. I had a few technical difficulties, though. I made mistakes that I won't make again next time, so let me share those with here so that others can avoid making the same mistakes. First, I burnt the hazelnuts the first time that I tried toasting them. I randomly tried 10 mins at 300. That was too long - I toasted more same temp but 5 mins & they were fine. The skins peel off fairly easily once properly toasted. Second - I messed up & misread the recipe & put in 1/2 c. rather than 1/2 stick (1/4 c) of butter - so I had to try the dough again (which meant toasting more hazelunts). So watch out for that careless error! Due to my earlier mishaps, it started to get late & I ran out of time to do the mousse. I was tired & frustrated, so I ended up stopping for the night after the crust. I wrapped it up well & thought it would be ok to start in the AM with making the mousse - but in the AM the crust was pretty dry. It was crumbly when I tried to remove the parchment paper & put it back onto the springform bottom. It pretty much fell to crumbly pieces. I moistened it up some & "glued" the crust back together by using some additional melted butter. It worked OK & tasted just fine - but next time, I would go ahead & do the mousse right away & hopefully aviod having the crust dry out like that. The mousse was easy & would have only taken about 5 or 10 more minutes. So - I'm sure it's way easier to make than what it was like for me this first time around & I'm sure it'll go much the next time I make it. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
This is the cake equivalent to one of those Ferrero Rocher candies. (Although it's really more of a pie than a cake, I think.) It was really rich and delicious. The salty, nutty, crunchy base complimented the mousse perfectly. I guess I made it in a 9 inch pan (didn't even think about that), because it was pretty flat. But I wouldn't change the proportions next time. I thought it was perfect, and so rich that you don't need a big thick slice. And it really was easy, even for someone who is scared of baking.

Made this cake for Valentine's day and it came out heavenly. It has a very light texture, but it's bursting with flavor. It also keeps well in the fridge for a number of days. I used a 9-inch pan, which resulted in a faltter cake, but I don't feel that it affected the flavour or texture. I would definitely make this cake for any special occasion - very festive, yet fast and easy.

This cake was delicious. Although it has the texture of a chocolate pie more than cake. I substituted cream cheese for the cheese the recipe calls for as I could not find any in my market.

This cake is fabulous; it's a perfect combination of chocolate and hazelnut. One note: if you make the cake in a larger springform pan than stated in the recipe, you will not have enough of the ganache to drip down the sides as in the picture (it will still cover the cake).

WOnderful! My ganache was too thick when I poured/spread it over the cake, and didn't get the lovely side drips like in the picture - just a few glops down the side..otherwise it was perfect. I doubled everything, made it in a 9 in. I had forgotten to add salt to the crust, but then sprinkled it on just prior to baking (crazy?), crust was good, not great as others had written - probably because of my salt mistake.

This cake was absolutely wonderful. I didn't realize how much I would love until I tasted it. This has definetly become one of my favorites. I can't wait to make it for company. It is a thinner cake, not very high, more like a tart. But it's still great.

This cake was fabulous (co-workers raved, and several asked for the recipe)...although I admit taking a few liberties with it. It rates three forks if you follow the recipe exactly, four forks if you tweak it. After reading previous reviews, I doubled the recipe for the crust and am glad I did. (It would make a delicious cookie on its own, by the way.) Also, I added 1-1/2 tsp of hazelnut-flavored syrup to the gelatin-chocolate mixture and used a bit less chocolate than called for when making the ganache, then let it come to room temp before glazing the cake...and the consistency was perfect! This recipe is definitely a keeper, but next time I will double both the crust and the filling for a nice, high cake.

I made this for my 15-year old stepson's birthday dinner. Everyone loved it and the steps were easy to do. Crust was great (I didn't even have quite enough nuts) and fine on timing (18-20 mins). I also used the Trader Joe's "Nutella" (which, according to the shelf sign, has 25% more hazelnuts than the original!) I would have liked a little more hazelnut flavor overall, but the cake was not lacking in flavor. One strange problem -- when I put the cake back in the fridge after pouring the ganache over, the fat from the heavy cream kinda separated from the cocoa, which looked pretty unattractive. Not sure how I could have avoided this. The problem didn't correct itself, even when I pulled it from the fridge an hour before serving.

I aboslutely loved this cake. I made it for a Valentine's Day dinner party and it drew rave reviews. I agree that it's important to watch the crust. I followed the recipe to the letter and had no problems whatsoever. It could almost use more mousse filling (a doubled recipe?) but maybe that's just me. One thing I did add - when the ganache was firmly on top of the mousse, I stenciled designs on the top of the cake using cocoa powder and icing sugar.

slightly underwhelmed by the flavour of the mousse - I wanted more hazelnut and more chocolate. Very pretty presentation and a general crowd-pleaser, nice light texture. Just lacking something...

What I love about this site is all the advice freely given..so helpful! I watched the crust carefully... substituted about 1 TB of the water in the filling with Frangellico....added 1 TB of Frangellico to the ganache (as well as the full amount of cream)...let the ganache sit only until just cool before pouring. Next time I would put strips of paper under the cake before pouring the ganache , because it pooled a little too much on the plate. I'll make this again. It's easy, looks professional & tastes great! I'd give it three & a half forks if I could.

Easy recipe to make - would like to know if I can freeze it? Also, Trader Joe's has their own brand of product to replace Nutella called "Cocoa Hazelnut Spread" which is delicious and less expensive.

I benefited from all the good advice on the site. I used a 9-inch pan, adjusted the amounts, cut back on the baking time for the crust, and didn't let the ganache sit too long before pouring it over. Overall, I think it was pretty good but not superlative. The nutella adds a distinctive taste to the filling. I'm not sure everyone would like it. The filling has a great, creamy texture - very nice. The dessert is easy to make and looks very dramatic. I thought the crust was great -- it cut nicely and tasted very good. Watching so it doesn't burn is critical. Even following everyone's advice, though, my ganache still got a bit stiff. And that's even with using more cream than called for. So I would watch that like a hawk so it stays pourable, and definitely double the proportions on that.

Rating: 3
A more honest rating of this dessert would be three and a half forks (wish epicurious would give us that option!). It was definitely good, but it loses half a fork for me b/c it just seemed to be missing that extra "oomph" to push it over the top. Looks are very deceiving with this cake. At first glance you would think it would be the richest thing in the world but when it hits your mouth you are suprised to find a light, somewhat airy filling topped with delicious ganache. They complement eachother very well. I REALLY enjoyed the crust and will probably use it for some of my other desserts in the future. If you are going to use a 9 inch sprinform, I recommend increasing the mousse filling by a third, but double the crust and the ganache. I too recommend adding some frangelico to the filling and the ganache..at least a teaspoon each time. This is definitely a recipe to have in your repetoire and is a refreshing departure to the "average" chocolate cake. And it's a beautiful (and easy) presentation to boot.

Rating: 4
Got rave reviews from family & friends. Not too sweet or too rich. I found it easy to make. I will bake the shortbread crust a little less next time. I let my ganache get too hard, so I set it over a bowl of warm water to soften until I could pour it. I found the ganache cracked when I cut the cake into serving pieces. I may add some Frangelico to the ganache next time & apply a thinner coating.

As a guy who hasn't baked anything in many years, I surprised my chocolate-loving wife with this on Valentines Day. It was fabulous and I got an "I am impressed!" from my gal. I too increased the ingredients by 1/3 to fit a 9 inch springform pan, a move that proved to be a good one given how quickly the family consumed it. Peeling the skins off the hazelnuts after toasting them took me a lot of time. I will just use chopped hazelnuts from a bag in the future.

tracks1000, that was the exact idea I had after eating this. It is delicious, but extremely rich. I'd go for individual tarts--even bite-sized, which wouldn't take too long because the crust is very easy. Shortbread shell, a swirl of mousse from a pastry bag and a drizzle of ganache. The mousse would be great on its own, too. Quick, simple, delicious.

I thought this was a cake worth making again. I did substitute almond butter for the Nutella, alleviating the trans fats. When I make it again, I will make more ganache. I also substituted toasted pecans for the chocolate base. Delicious! Some of the guests (all ages) thought it was tasteless, except for the delicious base, others said it was OK. I thought it was delicious along with 2 or 3 others. And, that's what counts in my home!

Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. It was very easy to make and did it the day before. I did add a little Frangelico to the marscapone chocolate hazelnut mixture and to the chocolate ganache (a little less than a tablespoon to each), and it came out great (the hazelnut flavor still was subtle). I found a good substitute for Nutella at Whole Foods called Choconut which has the chocolate and hazelnuts like Nutella, but doesn't have the hydrogenated oils like Nutella does.

I made this recently and every one enjoyed it very much. I personally thought it was a 2 forker. I have made a number of chocolate mousse desserts and chocolate tortes that were far superior in my mind. The December 1980 issue of Bon Apetit features a chocolate mousse on the front cover(recipe is on pg. 81& 82) This has been a wonderful show stopper for years. What is so good for me with this Mousse in review is, my wife is allergic to egg yolk, this has none. I can now make this and my wife can enjoy it.

Making again for Sunday dinner for the second time in a few weeks. Great presentation, a definate crowd pleaser, easy to do.

Very tasty and easy to do. My only comment is that the hazelnut flavor in the filling is not very apparent. Otherwise, this recipe is a keeper.

Will make again - but will cut down on cooking time for crust & cooling time for glaze - mine got too cool & I ended up spreading it on. Also had the crust break into several large (thank goodness they were large!) pieces, so I "spackled" it back together with the Nutella. Still had raves & not a piece came home!

I made this for company on Sunday. Watch the crust closely, it can easily burn with all that butter and with the dark cocoa, it's hard to see when its done. The granache was great, but I might have poured it on too thickly, it sort of bent when I cut it. Would like to see it with a cakier base and with more hazelnut flavoring in the filling. Defintely would make again though. Beatutiful presentation

My family loved this cake. I would like to know if I could add some frangelico to the mousse or would that keep it from setting. For Valentine's day I think I will serve it on a raspbery coulis and add some whole raspberries for presentation.

Ask your grocery. It's usually next to the peanut butter.

Nutella is usually available in the peanut butter section of your local grocery store.

Where does one get Nutella? Is there a substitute? Maine cook
