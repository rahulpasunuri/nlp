Made this appetizer for our Cajun themed dinner event with our gourmet group. Wow! They got rave reviews, can't wait to make them again. They were delicious. I followed the recipe exactly and prepped everything in advance. I cooked them on-site and served hot out of the oven. A BIG hit.

Actually made this recipe with shucked oysters, put it in a casserole and served it over puff pastry as an entree. Absolutely delicious!!!

Simply outstanding! Wouldn't change a thing! This is a regular feature for our Mardi Gras menu

I have made a similar recipe out of the the old "NY Times Cookbook". That one includes chopped shrimp. I have made it numerous times for New Years Eve and my husband won't let me try another recipe! Skip the ice cream salt, cook the oysters on crumpled tin foil...

This was very good, I made it as an entree on a bed of spinach in individual ramekin dishes

Incredible! My husband and I had these at Antoine's a year ago. How amazed was I to recreate this wonderful dish at home? I followed the directions nearly exactly, just halved the quantities and used kosher salt instead of rock. A little New Orleans jazz and it was just like being there.
