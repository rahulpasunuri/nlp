The recipe is exceptional, if you are a grapefruit fan, which I am. My advice before investing the time in this one, is know your audience. After preparing this for a brunch of about 30 guests, I think two people told me it was over the top. After hollowing out six grapefruit halves, I opted to present the remainder in small glass bowls, and in fact, I preferred the bowl presentation. The wine syrup is delicious, so next time, I will simply scale down the recipe, and also skip hollowing out the cups, to save time.

I had forgotten how wonderful these are - really beautiful and delicious. Make them the night before, but definitely take the time to impress friends and family for an elegant brunch.

Segmenting the grapefruit takes a while (so I would recommend making the night before). I found that freezing the empty grapefruit cups overnight helps them keep their shape for serving. Another benefit is that the syrup doesn't leech through the grapefruit, and as they defrost they get a nice iced look.

I added a sprig of mint to the center of each cup and served it on a platter that was sprinkled with the zest from the first 6 grapefruit. It made a wonderful presentation.

This is so much better than I thought it would be. I was concerned that the wine would overpower the grapefruit. But the syrup was sweet, subtle and delicious. I ran out of time while making the other breakfast items so I didn't make the grapefruit cups. Instead, I just spooned the grapefruit segments in a bowl and drizzled with the wine syrup. It wasn't as pretty, but was still very tasty!
