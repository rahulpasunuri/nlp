Made as written, served at room temp and it was surprising good. Served it with the grilled yogurt marinated lamb and Greek potatoes from EPI and everyone loved it.

Delicious and refreshing! I don't have a grill, so just sauteed the squash until they started to brown. I also laid them on paper towels after sauteeing to get rid of any excess moisture. I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and added extra olives, lemon, and mint. Lovely way to enjoy summer squash!

Fabulous flavor combination! Make extra mint, olive, and lemon sauce to toss the zucchini in.

Cook from BC, I don't see any reason why you couldn't make it in advance, BUT I think I'd serve it room temp. I often make grilled zucchini (and I make it nearly exactly as this recipe proscibes) and I make sandwiches with the leftovers (with arugula and roasted garlic and mayo).

Has anybody tried serving this cold? In other words - can I prepare it in advance?

Hmmm...two and a half? Kinda underwhelmed--with the reviews here and on the Food Network site I guess I expected too much. It was good though--and better when I marinated the zukes in the lemon/evoo mix first--- a nice zucchini dish. Bonus points for my three year old liking it!

For two we used half the zucchini, the full amount of mint plus and about 12 small kalamata olives. Loved it and it will be on our summer menu this year as an accompaniment to many grilled meats and fish.

A great side with the Grilled Chicken Breasts with Spiced Yogurt recipe on this site. I made it on a grill pan with fantastic results.

Followed it to the letter, but was forced indoors by rain, and used the broiler. Delicious. Doubled the recipe, and it was devoured by five adults who kept taking seconds. A lovely late-summer acccompaniment to grilled meats.

Easy, fast, yummy! I usually slice the zucchini thin with a cheese plane and brush on olive oil seasoned with garlic, parsley, hot pepper and black pepper. This was a nice change of pace.

I am always looking for new ways to prepare zucchini. This was fabulous and so simple. I found the mint and olive combination very exciting. I have made this many times.
