Pretty good! The egg-poaching is like a miracle, though I need to refine the technique for my microwave. Overdone at 66 seconds both at 100% and 90% power - next time would try maybe 55 seconds at 80%? The dish is a little too oniony to stand on its own - highly recommend grilled bread underneath, or grits, or something! But it's good and I'll keep it in mind the next time I have a bunch of scallions to use up!

The microwave poaching method given in this recipe is wonderful! Worked perfectly. For a firmer yolk, I cooked it for 1:10. I also experimented with cooking the egg for around 1:45 - it exploded! While amusing, this was less than ideal. So I recommend sticking with the 1:00 - 1:15 cooking time range.

An easy dish for anytime of the day. It is an ordinary recipe and poached eggs go along great with many other vegetables. If one wants to improvize, go for it. After made and tasted, I vote it good.

I want to poach eggs in my mircowave so bad! It just won't happen though. If I cook the eggs long enough for the whites to set, the yolk gets hard. If I cook to the perfect yolk consistency, the whites are runny. I've tried changing the amount and initial temp of the water, as well as changing up the type of cup/saucer I was using. Nothing seems to help. Any advice?

The poached eggs came out absolutely PERFECT No one guessed that I "cheated" and put them in the microwave (and I didn't confess while I accepted all the compliments)! - very important to cover the cup with a saucer (botched the 1st one when forgot). Also, I only went 45 seconds. I didn't have scallions and improvised with chives. Still totally delish. I'm sure even better and more crunchy with the scallions. I'll make the lemon, oil and chive sauce for other dishes- so easy and a crowd pleaser

Apparently, my microwave does NOT like poaching eggs! Splatter everywhere... Once I cleaned up the microwave and poached the eggs in the traditional way, the recipe was quite nice. I served 2 eggs with a slice of sourdough toast per person, for a delicious, satisfying, meatless entree.

Super delicious, easy and cheap! I made some quinoa to go with it to make it a bit more filling (absorbed the egg and scallion sauce, too) but otherwise it was perfect.

I am so glad I tried this, for a couple of reasons. I love poached eggs but avoid making them because I just end up making a big mess. Making them in the microwave is genius, fast and easy. When I assembled this on the plate, my bf commented "That looks so gourmet", and it did. This would be a great breakfast to serve to guests. The seared scallions and eggs went great together, but for me the real hero was the scallion sauce. This was super easy and would be delicious on eggs with or without the seared scallions on the side. Served with grilled bread rubbed with olive oil.
