My family loved this. I used leftover pork roast tossed in a little barbecue sauce, and one 8 oz. package of noodles, which I found to be just right with the amount of sauce.

Actually Bootch, it is very traditional in Chinese cooking to buy your roast pork from a specialty purveyor. I have a gentleman at the local market who has been making it every day for the past 30 years since he emigrated from Hong Kong. It is far better than anything I could make at home -and I am betting better than you could either.

An excellent dish and easy to prepare! The flavors are wonderful and so much better than carry-out. I used Roland lo mein noodles which were perfect. Also made the Chinatown Char Siu Barbeque Pork from this site. Unbelievably delicious! Can't wait to make this again.

This was great!!!I made it last night and loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and used a left over pork roast, cubed up and sautéd then tossed in a bit of BBQ sauce. It was delicious!! Thanks for a pretty easy recipe. Will be making this again for sure and adding to my list of keepers :)

Some of us work full time and it's nice to have a "quick" recipe once in a while. Looks good to me. I will definitely try. Might use left over pork roast also with barbecue sauce.

"1/2 pound Chinese barbecued pork, store-bought or homemade" Seriously? Store bought bbq pork is an ingredient? If I wanted store bought/cooked food, why would I be using Epicurious? You guys can do better than this!
