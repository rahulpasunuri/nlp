This was quite tasty! If you do get your turkey breast deboned by your butcher, I'm assuming you should probably scale down the weight of the breast you buy? My boyfriend got a 6 lb turkey breast, but it was 6 lbs withOUT the bones, so it was massive and he wore himself out trying to pound it down to half an inch! Granted, dealing with a full-sized turkey breast, rather than cutlets, was a new experience for both of us. I'd still call it a successful experiment!

I'm surprised there aren't more reviews for this great recipe. Delicious and a feast for the eyes too. Everyone loved it and agreed that it should be our substitute for beef brisket at our Passover seder. I made the recipe as written, except that I didn't make the gravy because I ran out of time. It did take a while to make. Like others, I found the butterflying instructions difficult to understand, but I found a great video on Martha Stewart's site in which they demonstrate the process. Regardless, next time I'll get the butcher to butterfly the turkey to save time. I'm in the habit of modifying recipes, but this one is so good, I'll follow it again and make the gravy too.

This was the BEST turkey dish I have had. The stuffing was delicious. I had the butcher butterfly and pound the turkey and I did the rest. I cook much longer than called for then let sit uncovered for an hour till dinner and it sliced perfect! Looked just like the picture.

Definately a hit visually and taste-wise at the seder table. The butcher did the hard work, boning and butterflying, and I made the stuffing (the fennel stuffing is mild, not to worry) and my husband did the tying and rolling. I'll make this again for entertaining using a regular stuffing. I had never heard of stuffing a turkey breast before and I really loved the drama of this dish. Excellent. It can feed a crowd elegantly.

This dish was designed as the alternative meat for our annual Easter lamb dinner, but it stole the show. And this dispite my much less than gorgeous wrapping-and-rolling job. The filling, in particular, drew rave reviews. I did add slivered almonds, but that embellishment certainly wasn't crucial to the success of the recipe. Highly recommended (tho butterflying and flattening practice might be prudent before you feature this at a formal dinner).

I'll start by saying that 1)this is delicious and 2)always ask the butcher to bone the breast! Unfortunately I found the instructions on butterflying to be un-intelligible (even after practicing on several sheets of folded paper). After hoping for the best and finally tying the thing, I prayed that the cooking process would hide my butterflying mistakes. Next time I will ask the butcher to both bone AND butterfly the breast. All our guests liked this dish very much, the turkey was moist and tender (I only cooked to 155 degrees) and the stuffing was scrumptious- the raisins really added the perfect flavor foil to the savory fennel. We all had second helpings even though there were plenty of alternatives on the table.

This is a most delicious Passover entrée. The instructions about butterflying, rolling and tying were unclear, but no matter, the results were terrific. It was more than enough for 12 guests who were delighted with it. I substituted regular raisins for the golden in the recipe.

I halved the recipe and used anise instead of fennel seed bc I had it. My local Whole Foods almost always has boneless turkey breasts, which I'm sure really helped my preparation time. We thought the tukey was a bit dry (I cooked it to precisely 165, 175 after standing per the instructions). The stuffing, however, was EXCELLENT. By itself, this would be a clear 4 fork make again. I'm definitely going to use it to stuff individual chicken breasts in the future. I didn't think this was much trouble to prepare but that may be because my turkey breast was boned and I was already chopping onions and celery for kugel. I timed it to be done at the start of the Seder and everything else was warming in the oven or otherwise ready to go so the last minute gravy prep was not a problem. Happy Passover!

We wanted a less rich and "full of flavor" alternative to brisket and we got it. THIS MEAT WAS FABULOUS. Was quite a bit of work but worth it. The turkey was moist and flavorful throughout. The recipe was very well written, fairly easy to follow, and provided opportunities to layer flavor in many steps in the preparation process. Here are some subtleties that are essential to the success of this recipe. 1) If you are not butterflying it yourself, make sure your butcher understands how to butterfly and then pound the breast so it is an even,1/2 inch all around and rectangular in shape. 2) Have it wrapped so that it is flat when you take it home.(He rolled mine to fit in the cardboard. Not good.) 3) It is a bit tricky to mound the stuffing and then roll the meat over the mound. 4) Although I stuffed it earlier in the day, there were alot of last minute logistics. 5) The addition of the toasted, ground, fennel seeds for the rub added to the flavor of the meat and the gravy. 6) Watch the temperature carefully. 6) No leftovers. It fed 9 hungry adults. 7) I bit the bullet and bought a heavy duty roaster and then used the two burner method. That was excellent. These 7 points are just minor points. It was a really delicious main course and I can't wait to make it again. (Might also make a good picnic roast.)We all agreed we have a new Passover seder staple now.
