I made this recipe over the weekend and made 1.5x as I had a lot of bread I wanted to use up. I liked the overall flavor, but the custard was a little too thick and didn't get absorbed into all of the bread, even though I let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. I used half and half and whole milk. Next time around, I would probably add a cup more of either liquid to thin the custard out a bit and would soak the bread in a bowl, stirring occassionally before I transferred to baking dish. Side note: the chocolate chips melted as the bread pudding baked. I think this would also be great served with a raspberry sauce.

I made this for large dinner party. Omitted nuts, Multiplied times 4 and cooked them for 15 minutes in 40 buttered cupcake pans. (not giant serving but enough after big meal). Served them with whipped cream and raspberries. Have also served with crumbled heath bars. Big hit and pretty simple.

I made this recipe for Christmas Dinner and it was divine! I was inspired to make my own Triple Chocolate Bread Pudding after having an excellent one at "Harvest" in the Hotel Hershey, PA just a few days before. The reviews sold me on this one although I did make some minor changes and baked in a large casserole dish... I used Croissants (from Costco) at the recommendation of a pastry chef friend - one croissant yields 2 cups; I used Ghirardelli semisweet chocolate chips and Hershey brand cocoa; and added a few pieces of a Ghirardelli white chocolate baking bar coarsely chopped. I also used vanilla extract and brown sugar because they make everything taste better. And lastly I omitted the egg yolk for no good reason. I let mine soak all day in the fridge. This is an outstanding dessert, everyone LOVED it and we've been eating the leftovers for days. It is similar to a souffle but even better. Next time I will make it for a New Years Eve party and serve in individual ramekins with freshly whipped cream.

I did this recipe and works perfectly, I used semi-sweet chocolate ad some spiced rhum. When I put in the oven, I put a sheet of foil paper on the top of the baking pan to keep the chocolate pudding moist.

I made this recipe exactly as is, and completely loved it! Even my roommates had seconds. Just a hint: It has a very strong chocolate flavour (especially because of the cocoa). If you want a milder chocolate flavour use less cocoa.

Awesome - like a delicious brownie. I used a sweet asian bun made with egg and yeast, as I couldn't find Challah and it worked great.

I visited "Someplace Else", Elkorn Wisconsin in 2009. They served choc bread pudding and admitted they copied their recipe from Bon Appe'tit magazine. I couldn't get this off my mind so when I found the recipe on your website I had to make it. It was perfect. I would make it again but only when friends or family are over. It is too tempting for hubby and I to have leftovers sitting on the counter.

Forgot to mention, I soaked for a little over 2hrs, instead of just one.

This was amazing. Chewy chocolately bread on top, soft pudding like chocolate gooey-ness underneath. Heavenly. I used cosi flatbreads (2), cubed and baked a few minutes to dry. I used 1c heavy cream, 1c whole milk, and pecans. I used a combination of a 70% lindt bar, and the rest in semisweet ghiradelli chips. I also added a little vanilla, and I reduced the sugar to about 1/4c. I baked in one larger dish, 325 for 40 minutes and it was perfect. YUM.

I'm not normally a bread pudding fan, but this satisfied my Valentine's chocolate requirement & my husband's favorite type of dessert. I used bittersweet chocolate & challah, soaked for about 2 1/2 hours,& baked in an 8x8 for about 50 minutes, which was a little long. I will definitely be doing this again!

Off the charts good. I let mine sit for about 5 hours before I baked it and it came out unreal. *note it also tasted even better the next day. great recipe.

I made this for a guy friend of mine who absolutely melts for chocolate bread pudding. He loved this. I made a few adjustments, using bittersweet chocolate for the custard but mixing both bittersweet and milk chocolate chunks together throughout the puddings. I also added some vanilla and a couple pinches of salt to the custard to give it more depth. Nothing too crazy to change about this- it's a solid dessert if you're looking to please a chocolate fanatic.

Great recipe for those who LOVE chocolate! Left out the walnuts and used Challah bread (1/2 loaf). Cooking time was perfect. Baked it in a 8x8 glass baking dish. It tasted even better the next day when warmed up. Topped with fresh whipped cream! I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious! Homemade whipped cream on top is a must. Next time I'll try it with vanilla bean icecream. Be careful to not overcook.. it was still good, but I felt like it would have been better a little more moist in the center.

This is some serious bread pudding! I agree with other reviewers that 1 hour is probably not sufficient time to soak the bread cubes--give it a little more time. I used an 8x8 glass pan, and a 2 qt would probably work better (I don't have one) for cooking in one pan. I cooked it for about an hour. Will make it again and serve with Haagen Daz, which might kill guests from richness. But worth it!

Rating: 4
This is delicious and relatively easy. I do think the bread cubes should be cut a little smaller or allowed to soak longer, because some of mine were still not chocolatey all the way through. I will definitely do this if I make it with day-old bread. Next time I will add a little cinnamon.

I have a question. Maybe this is a silly question but normally bread pudding recipes call for dry or day old bread but here it calls for a dense egg bread. I am hoping to make this tonight and am wondering if I should use the fresh bread or maybe toast it a bit to dry it out ahead of time. Thanks!

I quadrupled this recipe and baked double-servings in pot-pie tins from the grocery store. Made 14 gifts... well 13. We ate one for dessert and OMG! WOW!! I think this is the best bread pudding I've ever made. I didn't vary the recipe at all. And now I must go exercise off the extra fat & calories (But Yum!!)

Holy Cow! This is amazing. Made for our Bible Study and got rave reviews.Followed the recipe to the letter. The closest thing to egg bread I could find were some croissants I had in the freezer. The texture is similar to a lava cake and the chocolate is intense. Be sure to serve with whipping cream.Even non-bread pudding lovers will be impressed.

This is great! Substituted whole milk for cream and half and half because that is what I had on hand. Rich and chocolatey. Just the way we like it.

This recipe is great exactly as written... a solid dessert with a pure, intense chocolate flavor. I've tried playing around with it a bit (adding various spices, leaving out the nuts, etc) and nothing has tasted as good as the original recipe. And I love the simplicity of it.

I am so glad that there is a chocolate bread pudding recipe that does not call for a water bath (horrible past experience with it). This was delicious and really easy to make. I'm not a fan of walnuts, but I kept them in anyway. For the chocolate chips, I mixed both bittersweet and semisweet kinds (Ghirardelli), which I think made for a nice flavor. And if you're in NYC and buy your challah from Zaro's, one challah loaf will give you enough bread cubes for two of these recipes. (and a trick I picked up from Dorie Greenspan's book: if you have fresh bread and you want to make them "stale," put them in an oven at 350F for about 10 minutes.) oh, and I didn't have ramekins, so I used a small enameled roasting dish. The 1st batch, I kept it in for 45 minutes. The 2nd batch, I kept it in for about 55 minutes. Either way, it tasted good. No complaints from anyone.

I did this last night and it turned out great. I left out the nuts (based on some of the comments) but added two tablespoons of Chamborg. This gave a hint of raspberry. I garnished with whipped cream and some fresh raspberrys.

i used brioche buns because i couldn't find challah. this was heavenly! i used a little of my wicked hot chocolate mix for the cocoa powder (and added less sugar accordingly) and i loved the subtle kick it gave the chocolate. i'll try increasing the spiciness next time.

I decided not to actually rate this because I think it was my ingredient choices that made it not so great. I fed it to some guests and noticed people ate very little. So I have some warnings about ingredient choice. I used bread with an orange and anise flavor, and it totally did not work in this context. I also used chocolate chips that had a sort of funny taste to them, which I didn't discover until after I bought them. They came from the bulk bins at the store. So use good chocolate. I did really enjoy the walnuts and the overall texture of the dish. I assembled everything a day ahead and refrigerated until I was ready to bake it. That worked out very well.

This is an awesome recipe. I substitute walnuts with almonds. I also add 1/2 a stick of real butter to the chocolate in the saucepan.

This is delicious! I'm not sure what "egg bread" means, but I used challah and it was wonderful. In the future I think I would either break the walnuts up more or omit them entirely. In my opinion, bread pudding is supposed to have a certain texture, and the walnuts break it up. If you like texture juxtapositions, then this is the dish for you. But if you're like me and you prefer consistent and/or known textures to your favorite foods, the walnuts may not be an entirely pleasant addition.

Wonderful but so, so rich. Serve with extra creamy vanilla ice cream to balance flavor. I serve the pudding still warm in a ramakin with one scoop of ice cream and a diluted caramel sauce. Enjoy!

I made this right after Easter which was a slight mistake since my local grocery( I live way, way North in Minnesota) ran out of heavy whipping cream over the holiday. So, I made it with all half and half. Result - Pretty damn good. So now I am making it per recipe and the result is- Fabulous! My husband loves bread pudding (I avoid sweets because of a sugar problem) and he told me this would rival anything his mother ever made for him. I did try a little bit and found it to be like a rich, dense brownie. My husband said it was like a poor man's souffle. We love this recipe.

I teach cooking classes in Boston. We made this recipe with 20 of our 9-11 year olds over the week and it was a big hit. We did skip the walnuts due to nut allergies, but otherwise we kept the recipe the same.

This is a terrific recipe. Substituted 7 ounces of bittersweet chocolate (73%) for the chocolate chips and baked in a single souffle dish. Served with creme anglaise instead of whipped cream. This dish even reheats well.

CHOCOLATE HEAVEN! I added half the amount of walnuts b/c I burned half of them toasting 'em. It was a blessing in disguise b/c the dessert came out with a better ratio of nuts to the bread pudding. I did follow the recipe to exact measurements besides the walnuts. I grated some fresh nutmeg over the whipped cream as a garnish and flavor. Pretty simple to make and TASTY leftovers!

This recipe was good, not great. Nothing set the flavor apart from other chocolate bread pudding recipes, though the addition of toasted walnuts is a good idea. I've decided that I prefer the less egg-y bread pudding recipes-- they are denser and less fluffy.

Also baked in a 2 qt dish and it was scrumptious. Really excellent with vanilla bean ice cream. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. My dinner guests loved it. Will definitely make again.

This was so good; my husband doesn't usually like bread pudding and he loved this (he loves a rich chocolate cake, so I thought this might go over well). I followed the recipe exactly except that I baked it in a 2 qt baking dish rather than the individual ramekins, and baked for a bit longer than called for accordingly. The one issue I have with the recipe is that I neglected to buy enough whipping cream to both put in the pudding and whip up to serve on top, and you definitely need something to cut the richness of the dessert. Actually, though, I plan to get some vanilla ice cream instead of extra whipping cream for the next go-round anyway.

Yowza! This is fantastic! I keep leftover sliced french bread in the freezer for french toast - used that and whipping cream only. Halved the recipe.

I am usually not a big fan of bread pudding but when you come across a great recipe it is a real find. This is it. For the two of us I cut the recip in half (used whole egg yolk) and baked in a shallow baking dish. Recommended timing was perfect. Had leftovers and next date needed a chocolate fix, it was even good cold. Thank you Standard Tap.

I love bread pudding, but do not like the traditional type with raisins. I always asked my mom to use chocolate chips instead. This is my dream bread pudding. I did use pecans instead of walnuts, and I baked it in a 2 qt glass casserole dish, but the timing was perfect. I will definitely make this one again.
