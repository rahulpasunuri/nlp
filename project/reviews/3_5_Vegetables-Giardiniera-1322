As other reviewers aptly noted, the size of the vegetable pieces and cook times are important to consider so that they aren't overdone. I subbed vinegar for lemon juice, dressed the veggies with everything but the olive oil and left in the fridge to marinate for several hours. Very fresh and flavorful.

This is very good. My only complaint is that I didn't cut the vegetable small enough. Otherwise, it's a great alternative to yet another greens-based salad.

As is often the case I was looking to use specific items I had on hand. In this case sun-dried tomatoes and broccoli. This was easy to adapt - just broccoli, and olive tapenade I had open. I used dried thyme for the herb, and oops, forgot the red pepper. It was actually quite good.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving. I found it bland. Make sure to cut the cauliflower into small enough pieces or it will be too dense to absorb the flavor of the vinegarette. It probably would have been better with vinegars (like the other reviewer wrote) to give it more flavor. There are many other simple, more tasty recipes for mixed vegetables than this one. The only good thing was that you can make it ahead of time and it can sit for a while since you serve it room temperature.

I substituted vinegars for the lemon juice, added Italian seasonings, and extra oregano - be sure to use oregano LEAVES, not ground. I opted to use the Kalamata olives, although I think canned ripe olives would work as well. Left out the tomatoes and red pepper. The carrots truly do need only about 4 minutes, or they will be over-done. My family loved it! This was so yummy and attractive, will definately make it again! It looks quite lovely served on Radicchio or other red-leaf salad, and garnished with the lemon wedge.

Very easy. Great way to include vegetables with packed lunches.
