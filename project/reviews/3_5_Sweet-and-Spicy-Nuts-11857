I had too many bags of nuts stashed away in my freezer and this was a tasty and fast way to use them. These are sweet and spicy and go fast. Definitely a holiday gift keeper.

This recipe is unbelievably easy and delicious. I made it as described and had no problems whatsoever: They came out perfect. Make sure to double the recipethese will go fast!

Served the nuts at a holiday party and atop a salad to good reviews. This is one of the better Epicurious candied nut recipes - boyfriend thought they were storebought. I did a combo of orig recipe and Oakland's variation. Caramelize sugar, spices (I added cumin, ground ginger, tabasco), and 1 T water in a medium saucepan. In separate bowl, coat mixed nuts in melted butter. Fold nuts into sugar mixture, and sprinkle on ~1 T cinnamon sugar.

Love these! I tried the variation suggested by Oakland but the coating ended up very sticky, like caramel. Not great with cocktails. I have good success with the original recipe, where the end product is more like sugared nuts but with a kick. The clumping isn't bad as long as I separate the nuts on the foil when they're cooling.

Blech. Waste of nuts. Followed the recipe as written, and I got a lumpy mess. If you really want to try this recipe,do yourself a favor and follow some of the helpful hints from other reviews (wish I did). There should be a no fork option.

Excellent, used variations by Oakland CA and they were wonderful.

I loved the cayenne mixed with brown sugar. I served these at Thanksgiving. No one was expecting it, but everyone loved it and asked what was in it!

we add 1/2 t ginger and 1/4 t cumin. yum! sometimes it turns out a bit lumpy, but then it's just really good toasted nuts with little sugar-spice bombs :)

Having tried these once with mixed results (too clumpy or not carmelized) I incorporated suggestions in the other reviews with outstanding results: 3C Pecans, 3T unsalted butter, 4T brown sugar, 3T granulated sugar, 1t Cayenne, 1t freshly ground pepper, 1t salt, 3T water. Cook pecans on a baking sheet at 350 degrees for 20 min. Mix together dry ingredients and separate into two equal batches (about 1/4 C each). Melt 1 1/2 T butter over med heat in a large skillet. Add 1 1/2C pecans. Add 1/4C dry mixture and 1 1/2 T water. Stir constantly until carmelized, about 5 minutes; transfer to foil to cool. Repeat with remaining butter, pecans, dry mixture and water. Perfect results - evenly coated and carmelized and many requests for the recipe!

And I'm going with those who loved this recipe. I used pecans from my father's trees and thought they were delicious. The coating covered perfectly and took about 5-6 minutes to caramelize properly. Nice bite, and I might even go with more cayenne next time.

I'm siding with Anne from Long Beach. I have a recipe for Iced Nuts that I make often and that turns out superbly. This recipe, on the other hand, didn't work for me at all. The "caramel" remained clumpy, so the final product looked unattractive and also didn't taste good. I'm dumping it.

Superb! I've made this recipe many times and consistently have great comments and a huge plus that it's so quick & easy - as per previous comments, I saute nuts in butter before mixing in a plastic bag with the dry ingredients, then into the skillet.

These are WONDERFUL!! I use walnuts (haven't tried any other nut) and make them all the time. We often serve them at parties and they are always the first to go. I usually double or triple the batch as they go so quickly. As a previous poster noted, it works better to coat the nuts with butter, then transfer the nuts to a container in which you can put the dry mix and the close and shake. This makes sure you get even coverage on the nuts. Then transfer back to pan on stove to carmelize for about 8 minutes. We even served these at our wedding reception and people were asking for more!

Didnt seem to coat nuts well and was neither sweet or spicy. Maybe double brown sugar and cayenne next time.

I'd like to thank the chef that shared this recipe with all of us! Super tasty - Super easy - I've got friends asking me to make them for their holiday parties!

Yummy as is and yummy as a salad topping. I used cashews and was happy with the result.

After cooling, I chopped up the nuts (almonds; walnuts would be much better because sugar would stick better) and put them in my Cream of Wheat! I didn't use the cayenne or pepper though.

Used these in a baby greens salad with red onion, crmbled goat cheese, pear and balsamic vinaegrette for SuperBowl Sunday. Everyone loved it, including the guys who don't eat anything green.

These are yummy! Didn't need to cook them for 8 mins. maybe 4-5 at most.

To prevent the sugars from clumping, use low heat. If the sugar is not carmelizing properly, add 1tbsp of water to create more of a syrup which will allow for easy & more consistent coating.

Fantastic! I have made these twice, both times using all cashews. They are spicy and delicious! Even though the cashews are a smooth nut, I found the coating stuck just fine. I served them as an extra nibble at a cocktail party and they were gobbled up in no time.

A great last minute snack. I used walnuts which really caught all the topping. It didn't take as long as 8 minutes to cook - maybe 5. Good hostess gift.

Yummy! As mentioned from a previous reviewer, the almonds and other smooth surfaced nuts did not catch the coating as well as the pecans...however these were definitely a tasty treat!

What did I do wrong? I followed the recipe exactly. I used my heavy black skillet and after sprinkling on the dry ingredients I knew I had a problem.....The dry ingredients immediately clumped and I could not get it to blend with the butter, which was totally soaked (I guess) into the nuts. I tossed them around in the pan for 8 minutes, then turned onto foil. They are okay but too spicy for my taste. And sticky. Also, there are clumps of the butter/dry mixture that I cannot even break apart.....What did I do wrong? I really would like a recipe for SWEET or sweet and spicy nuts for the holidays. Thanks!

Excellent! I mixed the dry ingredients (except the nuts) into a plastic bowl that has a lid. I roasted the nuts in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes and then put the nuts into a pan of the melted butter to coat the nuts. I then put the nuts into the plastic bowl, covered the bowl and tossed the nuts to coat them with the dry mixture. This put a coating onto the nuts without carmelizing the sugar. My guests really enjoyed it!

I roasted the pecans in a 350 Oven for 30 mins, then I doubled the coating recipe. melted the butter in skillet and added sugar spice mixture and 2 Tablespoons water. I followed recipe the rest of the way. The added liquid cooked off easily and coated each nut thourghly, mmmmmmmm too good

These are some tasty little tidbits and they are so fast and easy to make. I used a little cumin as recommended in other reviews and as I was out of cayenne I substituted hot sauce and skipped the salt (because of the amount already in the hot sauce). I have also used the sugar and spice mixture on popcorn and it was just as addictive!

Very good holiday snack, not too sweet - not too spicy. Easy to make.

I found that almonds and peanuts did not coat completely. Added 1T brown sugar to create more sugar coating -- this worked pretty well. Also added 1/2 tsp Allspice (in addition to 1/2 tsp Cumin) to give it a more Carribean taste. mmmmmmmmm.

amazing, but, way too salty..cut it in half or leave out.

These are good. I used your suggestion about adding cumin, but I only used about 1/8 teas. next time I'll use at least a half teaspoon.

This is great - I omitted the cayenne & just used salt and sugar. Almonds & cashews make a tasty combo. Simple, wonderful, and great for snacks.

I used pecans the first time (I will be making it again and trying different nuts). My husband and I got the munchies about 10 p.m. and by 10:45 we were really munching! I added about 1/2 tsp of cumin and they were fabulous! Just the right amount of sweetness and spice. The heat index was just right, also!
