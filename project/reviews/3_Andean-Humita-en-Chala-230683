I don't know what I did wrong, but the corn mixture was very liquidy. I grated the corn cobs instead of putting them in the processor. So I ended up having to strain the mixture. After I baked them they still did not hold together, but despite all of that these were tasty tasty tasty. Next time I think I will put them in the processor. I also added jack cheese to some of them.

Good recipe BUT Argentines do not use red pepper.

We prepare this dish during the summer at our house - we are Chilean and we boid the "packages" instead of putting them in the oven, also we do not use the pepper flakes. I tried this variation and found it to be good, but still prefer it boiled.
