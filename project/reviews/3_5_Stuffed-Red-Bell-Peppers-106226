Great way to "sneak" vegetables in my kids' diet! :-) I added a finely chopped carrot and celery to maximize vegetables. Also used a full 2 cups of sauce in the meat mix to counteract dryness, as some earlier reviews said it was on the dry side. Added quite a bit more salt, to taste (before adding raw meat and egg), as well as a little herbs de provence since previous reviewers said it was a little bland. One final touch--added shredded cheddar in the mix, delicious touch. Instead of cooking in a pan (hard to manage with kids running around), I baked it in the oven at 425 for an hour...used meat thermometer to make sure it was 155-160. Overall, a healthy meal; great way to get everyone to eat more vegetables, and a tasty alternative to hamburgers, etc.

forgot to note that I topped each pepper with some pepper jack cheese just at the end of the bake time!

So in truth I shouldn't be rating or reviewing this recipe as I switched so many ingredients, but it served as such a great inspiration I'm giving it 4 forks!!! Used roasted poblanos (the last of my harvest), fresh cilantro, Smoked Paprika and Cumin. The result was fantastic. Served it with mashed potatoes for a great fall meal. Someday I'll try it as written but will definitely repeat my version the next time I have extra poblanos!!

delicious...I substituted 1 lb. of ground turkey meat + 2 spicy Italian turkey sausage links for the ground beef, used jar Fra Diovlo sauce and 2 TBSP. dried Italian seasoning for the parsley. After the 40 minutes on the stove top I too cooked them for an additional 30 minutes in a 325 oven.

We gave this a solid 'good'. I Made it mostly as written with these 3 changes made because of 'making due with what I had': 1. Used bottled 'Prego' sauce because I had it on hand, next time I'll use crushed tomatoes. 2. Used 'Green' bell peppers they were on sale, next time I'll use the recommended 'Red' bell peppers. 3. used 1/2 t. allspice instead of 1/4 t. By all means I highly recommend to muster up your courage and ADD SOME ALLSPICE, it is a much misunderstood spice & some people think it can only used for deserts which is a misconception. I noticed a lot of reviewers who made this recipe left it out the Allspice entirely. Allspice is aromatic, warm and a wonderful compliment to meats and some types of veggies and also fruits & breads/cakes. You will be missing something good if you don't add it and it will be no surprise if your dish comes out tasting 'bland' without the allspice.

I made the following changes: I also slit the peppers on their side and stuffed and baked as other reviewer in oven. Used 3/4# sausage, 3/4# ground beef; Used marinara sauce rather than jarred tomato sauce. Will top with grated parmesan also.

Flavors did not meld at all and was very bland even with the addition of extra oregano and cayenne pepper.

Excellent flavors. I used a combination of a homemade tomato sauce (Mario Batali recipe) and plain canned tomato sauce. It did take a very long time to cook and for the meat to come to the right temperature. After simmering on the stove for 40 minutes (twice the time the recipe stated), I stuck the covered pot in a 325 oven for another 30 minutes.

When cooked in Europe It's not blind :). Except you grow your own peppers lol - and not the bell variety :), The stuffing peppers are smaller and this adds flavour to the stuffing. Use generous quantities of Oregano!

Quite good, but luckily other reviewers tipped us off that a little more pizazz was needed--used smoked sweet paprika, about a tbsp Japanese 7-spice for some kick, and the goat cheese was the best modification! Yummy.

BEST RECIPE EVER! I followed the changes from ankanczes from concord ca on 03/16/11 except I only used one anaheim pepper (I'm a wimp) and I used ground deer meat instead of beef. The goat cheese on the top wins the real prize! INCREDIBLE!

Rating: 4
Everyone loved this, even those that don't like peppers! I doubled the tomato sauce and used a little goat cheese to top it. The goat cheese made the sauce creamy and tangy and put it over the top! I also: - added a little sugar to the tomato sauce to take off the acidity a bit. - added one anaheim chile to tomato sauce - added one anaheim chile to meat and onion - used brown rice -- its just better! - added chicken stock to rice - added chicken stock to tomato sauce - tripled the tomato sauce!

only commenting because of the large number of people who recently stated this recipe to be bland. i made it as written, in terms of ingredients. however, i cut the peppers in half lengthwise and then stuffed the halves. i covered and baked in half an inch of sauce at 375 for 40 minutes. to serve i spooned sauce from the pan over and topped with grated parmesan and fresh parsely. we thought it was delicious. (my ground beef was of high quality, and the stuffing and peppers were quite moist.)

A delicious main course and easy to prepare ahead. My husband was skeptical and feared cafeteria-style food - not so! Used Newman's Own marinara sauce in place of the tomato sauce: great flavor and moist meat. Sweet paprika essential for authentic taste. Fortunately, I'd just brought some back from central Europe, but it's available at most grocery stores.

Rating: 4
I used smoked paprika (because I didn't have sweet), and I used a brown rice blend from Trader Joes that has a really nice chewy texture. I also used more rice than the recipe called for. Finally, I tried the "homemade" tomatoe sauce that one reviewer recommended and it was not great. Next time I will try a truly homemade sauce from scratch. Otherwise, it was delicious!!

This brought back memories of my childhood. Growing up, this was one of the few traditional Hungarian recipes that I loved and would ask for seconds. I used this recipe as a base and created an amazing meal. Modifications: Filling: - used bison meat instead of beef - was extremely generous with the parsley - used brown rice instead of white rice - used fresh ground pepper - probably about 2 tsp - didn't add tomato sauce to the meat/rice mixture Tomato sauce - growing up my mom always made the most amazing tomato soup to surround the stuffed bell peppers. So, I wasn't convinced by the canned tomato sauce. In a soup pot, I poured a 14ounce can of tomatoes, a bottle of mushroom and basil pasta sauce, 1-1.5 cups of vegetable broth, generous amounts of fresh basil, oregano and rosemary, parsley, 1 tbsp of brown sugar, fresh cracked pepper. I let the sauce simmer about 35 minutes - placed the stuffed peppers and the meatballs ( from the extra filling) into the sauce ( which should be the consistency of a thick tomato soup) and simmered 40 minutes. If the sauce is not liquid enough add some water. The result was amazing to be eaten with a spoon. My husband (who is on a low protein, low fat, low everything diet) had 2 servings and ate it the next day for lunch and dinner....

Great recipe. My 8 and 12 yr old loved it! Based on reviews, I made the following changes: * Saute onions and garlic for a few minute prior to adding peppers. * Used brown rice and cooked it al dente * Used 50/50 mix of lean ground turkey and buffalo and browned it slightly to reduce cooking time. This also kept from over cooking the peppers. * Used home made pasta sauce. * Served peppers by slicing lengthwise, topping with sauce and a some fresh grated Parmesan Reggiano.

This was okay- I made several changes, without which, this must be extremely bland. Used Italian sausage, home-made tomato sauce, added extra paprika, an egg my very own chicken laid, home grown peppers! All of which should have given it some oomph- but alas just a 'meh' from this corner.

Great family meal. We used whole grain brown rice and it was delicious, and pretty healthy. I would definitely recommend this. It may not the fanciest dish, but it's a great change in a menu during the regular week.

Stuffed peppers are not on my top ten list, but my husband loves them so I tried this. Very (surprisingly) good! I agree that it needs more spice than called for; I used some chopped jalapenos and some powdered ancho chili, and omitted the allspice. Used jarred pasta sauce as that was what I had; also substituted diced cooked potatoes for the rice, as we had a lot of leftovers. Definitely a keeper.

My mother used to make stuffed peppers in a pressure cooker and I remember them being moist and delicious. This recipe produced a very dry filling, in spite of all the bland tomato sauce. Just average, in my opinion, especially considering the amount of time required for preparation and the large number of pots, pans and bowls required. I'll keep looking for a better recipe.

I would definitely add more spice and more sauce. Mine got very dry after a while, but the overall taste was excellent. A good tomato sauce is the key to a nice balance of flavors.

Our all-time favorite stuffed bell pepper recipe! We cook them in the pot, which is surprisingly easy and fast and makes a wonderful sauce. These are extremely flavorful, moist, and also freeze really well! Here are the minor changes we made to the ingredients: 6 Tblsp DRIED parsley (initially an accident, wonderful flavor); replaced beef with Honeysuckle Turkey Italian Sausage.

This is my go-to recipe. I'm not sure Stuffed Peppers could ever get 4 forks as it reminds me too much of a college dining staple, however, it's as good as a stuffed pepper could ever be!! You really need to use beef or pork- I tried turkey and it dried out.

Made this with green and red peppers from our CSA and served to my sister who hates stuffed peppers. She ate them with relish. Nice, easy recipe to use up those peppers and a great base for making your own. My only change was I added a bit of red wine to the tomato sauce - the bottle was opened and it seemed like a good addition. Great flavors! I made a small meat loaf with the leftovers which we then used with the leftover sauce over pasta the next day.

I made this using a variety of peppers, including purple, green, and a sweet red chili pepper. I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground pork- enhanced the taste. I also included a diced jalapeno pepper mixed with the ingredients. I didn't have tomato sauce, so I used tomato paste diluted with 2 parts water and some sugar. I increased the paprika based on the reviews. This is a nice dish for the fall.

I substituted ground turkey and wild rice then added mushrooms, ground mustard, and crumbled bacon. My husband and I found the recipe to be slightly bland. I would try the recipe again, and using the ingredients above and adding further herbs or spices.

I love this recipe! I'll usually add some roasted pine nuts, currants and a teeny bit of brown sugar. For me the allspice is a must. Be sure to add extra tomato sauce, as it evaporates when cooking.

I used 1/4 chopped red pepper and one chipolte + sauce. I also used poblanos.

Rating: 3
This is a good recipe mainly because of the cooking method. Cooking on top of the stove renders a soft pepper in contrast to oven cooking which hardens the surface of the pepper. However it took 40 minutes for my peppers to soften to the consistency one would want and for flavors to blend. Definitely need 2 cups of sauce! I made a simple tomato sauce with garlic, anchovy paste and just a bit of sugar!

Rating: 2
The end result was good but only after some tweaking. I used sweet Italian sausage (20%) and 80% ground beef. I followed the recipie without using Allspice. It was VERY BLAND! I added some cayenne pepper sauce which helped a lot. I used Hungarian paprika and should have used 50% more.

Rating: 4
I agree that the method of cooking the peppers is what makes this recipe great. I admit I changed it--I used green peppers instead of red, tofurkey sausage (diced and browned with the onions and peppers) instead of beef, and leftover mexican red rice instead of plain rice, plus some grated sharp cheddar cheese--but the end result, which would be the same no matter which filling you used, is a tender and moist stuffed pepper that tastes delicious.

I used this recipe as a template as many others have done. I substituted the Italian sweet sausage for the beef and omitted the allspice. I tried using a commercial Italian pasta sauce in place of the plain tomato sauce as called for in the recipe and I did not care for it. I will use the plain sauce the next time.

This was a variation from the way I normally make stuffed peppers. I liked cooking the peppers on stove top because it eliminates the hot oven during the summer when peppers are locally grown. On the advice of others, I added cayenne pepper and that gave it the perfect punch. I added a large musroom, finely chopped, to the beef mixture, also. Will definitely make thses again.

Rating: 3
This is a great template for a stuffed pepper recipe. As others have noted, it's really easy to tweak based on taste preferences, and cooking on the stove top keeps the peppers moist. I substituted a bunch of mint for the parsley, and added a little more garlic. The mint mellows out while cooking, but gives the meat a nice, fresh flavor and balances out the heaviness of the sauce. I also topped with fresh feta cheese, a great contrast to the sweet peppers. All in all, an excellent dish and I will definitely make again.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful dish that I have already added to my regular rotation. Whenever I find red peppers on sale, I make this. It is a wonderful mix of flavors with spices that I don't use every day so I wasn't entirely sure my family would like it, but they did. I used a good quality jarred tomato sauce rather than canned, but that is the only change I made. With the exception of my very finicky 7 year old, everyone loved it!

Rating: 0
I haven't tried this recipe yet, but the photo shows the wrong shaped pepper. If you want to stuff a pepper, choose the roundest ones you can If you're just wanting the meat of the pepper, choose a square one like the photo. With four cuts, you can remove the meat from a square pepper. Cut straight down, just beyond the peak of the side, towards the stem. Rotate the pepper 90 degrees and cut again on each side. You can slice or dice the sides as you wish. A round pepper is better to be scooped out because its shape is already ovoid.

This recipe was excellent. I always read a bunch of reviews before making but this time I made it mostly to the recipe with these exceptions: (1) used meatloaf mix - 1/3 pork, 1/3 veal, 1/3 beef (2) left out allspice (3) used smoked paprika which gave it a great smokey flavor (4) used additional 1/2 cup tomato sauce and 1/2 can water like someone else said. The sauteed onions and peppers give it nice texture. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!

I love this recipe! The Hungarian paprika makes all the difference. I follow the recipe exactly, and it turns out great every time. My hubby loves these too. I buy lots of peppers in the summer at a local farmers market as they are cheaper than the grocery store. A big hit with this household!

Thought this was good, but not great. Used a mix of red, green, and yellow peppers, which made for a nice variety. I may try it again. If so, I'll definitely do something different with the sauce next time - it burned off to the point that there was nothing to spoon over the peppers after 20 minutes of simmering on medium-low heat.

We really enjoyed this, but alas, I tweaked it a bit. I used 4 red and 2 green bell peppers. I used leftover rice pilaf with pine nuts instead of rice..added fresh oregano, thyme, basil to the meat mixture (1/3 pork, 2/3 beef), omitted the paprika and allspice, instead added crushed red pepper. Started w/28oz can of crushed tomatoes (with 1/2 cup going to meat filling) and then added 1 cup beef broth to sauted garlic and crushed red pepper w/leftover puree for the sauce. What I loved about this recipe was the stovetop method. The peppers and filling came out perfectly cooked. Served it with liguini and the sauce.

Y'know guys... what makes this recipe special isn't so much the ingredients but the method. Every stuffed pepper recipe I've ever had was always baked in the oven. Cooking these on the stove in a pot with the tomato sauce around them makes it unique. As for the ingredients, any first year cook worth his salt should be able to figure out that you can stuff these with almost anything and they will come out alright. Here are a few more suggestions; I used Italian sausage, onions, stewed tomatoes in the stuffing, and for a nifty texture change - I added sun dried tomato risotto from a store bought package mix. It made them very moist and tasty. Also, instead of just tomato sauce I used a jar of pasta sauce such as Barilla which was even better. Here's a tip - if you're going to use the red peppers you should blanch them first to get the skins of as they are kinda tough. Opt for the green peppers instead for more ease and LOTS more flavor! This is a staple food at my house.

I think this was a great addition to my reg stuffed pepper recipe. Fresh parsley great!! I changed: added 2t cayenne pepper, decreased allspice to 1/8t and I always use prepared pasta sauce (my own or store bought) mixed with beef stock for added flavor. I also added 1c sharp cheddar cheese to the meat mixture...Will def make this way again!

It was good. I had most of the ingredients lying around the house. I melted mozzarrella on top. I probably would not cook the peppers as long as I did they became rather soupy. I used 1/2 green and 1/2 red bell peppers to save some money.

Well, my husband has fond childhood memories of stuffed pappers, so we tried it out, great presentation and our guests loved them, to the point of making them the next week. However, I wouldn't make them again, basically because they were an enormous amount of work, pricey, and didn't taste fantastic, we even melted provolone slices on each towards the end, there was great sauce, it was just the filling that seemed bland and dry.

A definite keeper. I picked and chose from the other reviewers' suggestions: roasted red pepper marinara sauce, browned the meat part way through the sauteeing step to speed cooking, dash of cayenne pepper. My own adds: cinnamon instead of allspice, and beef broth to supplement the sauce surrounding the peppers, which was definitely evaporating at an alarming rate. Everyone (including my 11 month old) loved it.

These were good, but definately do not qualify as mediteranian. There was too much tomato sauce, next time I would add more sauce to the filling and then cook the peppers in the oven without the extra tomato sauce. Also I would add more spices, maybe some thyme and oregano.

Tweaked this so much it's hardly fair to comment on the original. Suffice it to say, much experience combined with the most logical of the reviews resulted in family raves. Stuffing included mushrooms, zuchinni, tomatoes,cabbage. pork, parmesan, fresh herbs,all pre-cooked. Sauce was pureed tomatoes, onions, roasted red peppers, beef broth. Broiled a slice of smoked provelone on top of each pepper before serving, spooned sauce over each. But the key seemed to be using red and yellow peppers vs green, green deemed "memorably bitter" by everyone.

I didn't have any sweet Hungarian paprika, so I just used regular paprika, and it was fine. I didn't find it bland, but even though I cooked it all for 50 minutes, the peppers weren't as tender as I thought they'd be, and the meat was quite so solid. But still a good meal.

Halved the stuffing to fill two large and two medium peppers. Though easy and tasty, next time I will try with 1/2 sausage to add flavor, and will add at least one cup (instead of 2/3 cup) rice. Because no parsley was on hand, we used fresh oregano and rosemary. Per the suggestions of other reviewers, we used vegetable marinara sauce rather than straight tomato. Since there wasn't quite enough of that, added 2 T tomato paste and 1/2 cup water. Stovetop cooking was easy and I felt that 40 minutes was the perfect length of cook time.

Like many others I found this too bland. I needed more sauce and about an extra 20 minutes of cooking. Next time I will go back to my mothers way. Green peppers which have more flavor.

I put mine in a roasting pan and bake covered for about 1 hour at 350.

I used yellow and orange sweet peppers in this tasty recipe. The ingredients and spices created a layering of flavors which took this beyond any typical stuffed pepper I have eaten.

I've made this a few times and think it's a delicious recipe. My teenagers like to spice theirs up with hot chili sauce. I use a mixture of ground veal and lean ground beef, and add some hot hungarian paprika to give it a little extra 'je ne sais quoi.' It seems I always have leftover filling, so I just freeze it; when I want to serve it again, I buy fresh peppers, thaw the filling, open up a can of tomato sauce which I mix with some tomato paste to pour over and around the stuffed peppers, and I have a great meal with very little effort. I've used the filling to make stuffed cabbage, and it's also a big hit.

This is a wonderfully versatile recipe, and it's very hard to go wrong with it. I made it for the boyfriend and picky roommate, and both absolutely loved it! Only had three peppers, so I halved the recipe and still had enough filling left to saute and mix with some rice. I used sweet Italian sausage instead of beef, added a dash of cayenne pepper, overdosed on paprika and garlic, and added some chopped crimini mushrooms just before the onions were done. Also used Trader Joe's red pepper marinara, which boosted the flavor quite a bit (definitely need to add nearly 2 cups extra water for the pot). The results were fabulous!!

My husband thinks this recipe is 'really good'. Have made it several times and keep it for the recipe box. I just stick to the original and sometimes use a prepared marinara/pasta sauce. It changes the flavor a little each time. It is fun to experiement with different cheeses on the top too.

Looking for a good basic stuffed bell recipe- this fit the bill. I loved it- my husband thought it was too tomato tasting but I didn't at all- the allspice and paprika in it are great-I did add a can of diced green chiles, otherwise followed it exactly. Looking forward to leftovers tonight!

I love stuffed peppers and this is the recipe I have been looking for. Next time I will add more veggies like zucchini. I think it could be a rather versitile recipe. Try it!

We thought that this recipe was a good one for the old staple of stuffed peppers. I substituted one teaspoon of hot paprika in the tablespoon of sweet paprika because I like some zing. I used very lean hamburger and kept the recipe low fat. I made a double batch of Alton Brown's "pantry friendly tomato sauce," which made just the right amount (see foodtv.com for recipe).

I made this for a dinner party last night and it got rave reviews! It's easy to make half meat and half meatless for the vegetarians at the party, too, without compromising on taste and flavor.

This recipe is delicious for what it is -- comfort food! It is also very adaptable. I didn't have any parsley so I left it out (although I think this would have made it even better) and I didn't have allspice so I substituted pumpkin pie spice. Yummy! I will definitely make this recipe again.

I also added red pepper flakes, worchestershire, and some chedder cheese top top. It was still bland. This recipe is just so-so.

Mmmm Delish! I substituted green peppers for red just because they were cheaper, but next time i will use red because i really thought this turned out well! I also omitted allspice because i didnt have any.. i didnt miss it anyways! The flavor was wonderful and they were so tender and juicy!

This is the first epicurious recipe that I have made and been disapointed with. This was rather bland, or something was missing?? I am not sure. I would not make these again. I even used my home made spag. sauce which my family loves!! Sorry to write such a bad review.....

Nice - Basically bell peppers stuffed with meatloaf in a simple tomato sauce. I added more tomato sauce to the pot of 6 peppers (about 3 cups more) and liked it alot. I'm big on having lots of sauce in any dish.

I loved this recipe! I did use green bell peppers instead of red but my children love it and now they request it at least once per week. Great with mashed potatoes on the side!

I read previous reviews about the peppers being too bland, so I compensated by adding some crushed red pepper flakes, worchestershire sauce, and some old bay, but the filling was still quite bland. Really overcompensate when seasoning the vegetables because you're adding so much meat (I used lean turkey). I sprinkled some Parmesan and Mozerella on top at the end that that definitely helped a bit. But the best thing I did was instead of canned tomato sauce, I made my own - sauteeing onions and parsely then adding turkey I had leftover and seasoning to taste. My boyfriend esp appreciated the sauce. I might try adding more seasoning and baking them next time I make this.

Never liked suffed peppers but this is fabulous!!!! My entire family loved it--the next day as well. Make it.

This is deliscious and quite filling! I always serve it with sour cream on top, and it's so much food in one pepper you really don't need much else-- I just add the excess filling to white. They mix together pretty easily, and it's sort of like eating a lighter version of the filling itself.

Super delicous! Even the leftovers were tasty -- they're especially wonderful when topped with some shredded mozzarella cheese

If you don't want the sauce to burn, it is better to mix it with water for a thinner consictency. Also, you could use 1 cup of sourcream and 1 cup of tomato paste mixed with water for sauce.

I had to cook this a HECK of a lot longer than suggested...unfortunately, my rice was ready, hubby was hungry, and we had to wait another forty minutes for dinner. Perhaps my peppers were too big and had too much stuffing?

Rating: 3
I was a little skeptical because I hate allspice, but this turned out great. Got rave review from the hubby as well. I used 3/4 ground turkey and 1/4 turkey sausage, came out very well. The sauce did start to burn and the bottoms of the bellpeppers wilted, any suggestions?

Delicious, simple, and easy. My family enjoyed this recipe very much as it was similar to a dish my mother made when I was a child. Delicious with green beans boiled in a little water and fresh garlic, and a salad with Anjou pear vineger and oil.

This recipe is great as is. I make it fairly often and it never lasts long. Don't add all the extra spices that everyone suggests. I don't get the obsession with making everything hot. I'm a cajun girl so I've grown up with spicy food and can appreciate it, but it's not necessary to make EVERY dish hot. There's a time & place for spicy, but this isn't it. Sometimes hot just hides other delicate, more complex flavours. So make this exactly as is, don't add a thing and enjoy! You'll experiences the lovely flavours of the peppers. I promise you'll love it!

This is a delicious and quick recipe for informal family dinners, one I will definitely do again. The only change from the recipe -- I added about 1/8 tsp. cayanne - as was suggested in one of the reviews.

I was looking for a recipe similar to my moms. However I remember her using ampbells tomato soup as her sauce so that is what I used. It sort of mellows out the flavors. I now use the low sodium style and not quite a full can of water!

Great weekday dish. Easy to prepare and delicious. Definately use red peppers -- I used a few green and they were horrible. I prefer more rice and tomatoes.

Yummy! This is a great recipe. I ended up with very large peppers and had to cook it longer. I also used much more sauce. In the future I may brown the beef first. We really enjoyed it!

Really enjoyed making this dish, felt the sauce was a bit watery. But overall the flavors blended very well. I would recommend and will make again.

Very easy to prepare. Just like everyone else, I had my own variation. I used 3/4lb each of ground dark meat turkey and spicy Italian turkey sausage instead of beef. I also added 1 tsp of Chipotle Chili Powder for a little more heat and smokey flavor. And about five minutes before they were finished, I topped them with grated Parm-Regg which made a nice browned crust. Don't skimp on the spices. This version had a nice flavor with a little heat. Could have probably used a little more chili powder if your guests like really spicy foods.

This was my first stuffed pepper experience. In addition to the spices called for, I used a little cayenne pepper, oregano, and basil because all the reviews said it was bland. I also used crushed tomatoes with italian seasoning which spiced it up and gave the sauce some texture.I doubled the recipe, cooking for 12, and it was great. Once addition - growing up in a Hungarian family, we always ate our stuffed peppers (and cabbage) with a little sour cream on top. It's delicious!!

I loved this quick and easy recipe and will definitely make it again. I think allspice and paprika are the perfect flavors for this dish.

This was a great easy recipe. I did not have the paprika or allspice, so I substituted Old Bay seasoning for a twist. It was fantastic. I will make it again.

This recipe is great, but I was a little confused about whether I should cook the meat before stuffing the peppers. I followed the recipe as is and found the meat a little underdone. My suggestion is to add the meat to the onions, parsley, pepper, etc. saute to cook it halfway before stuffing the peppers. Overall the taste is delicious -- I would definitely make this again!

This was delicious. I made my own tomato sauce to add to it. Yum. I did modify ingredients a little however. I omitted the all-spice (didn't have any) I also added Grated Pecorino Romano cheese. And a little mozzarella as well. (Esp. on top) I also added sliced mushrooms when preparing the onions. I will make this again and again!

This is a good family meal but I would not serve it if I was trying to "wow" guests. I followed the recipe and, if I make it again, I will add a bit more seasoning to the meat mixture as it was a bit bland. I did add some mozzarella the last few minutes as another cook suggested and would recommend doing so as it was a great added touch!

My fiance grew up with two Eastern European grandmothers and he said that this recipe blew his grandmothers' stuffed peppers out of the water. Instead of ground beef, I used a ground chicken mixture from a nearby Russian deli that has some onion, garlic, and mushrooms in it. I used this on top of the onion and garlic called for in the recipe, to give the flavor some more oomph. The result: delicious comfort food with flair!

Rating: 4
This recipe was a huge hit with my husband and two of our friends. I didn't have any ground beef around but I did have ground buffalo (95% fat free) and used that instead. You would NEVER know the difference! The only other changes I made were to use brown rice instead of white and add a sizeable pinch of garam masala to infuse a slightly more ethnic flavor. Will make these again and again!

Frankly, this shit was the bomb. Them peppers were good as hell after i hooked that up with some sick ass sauce. nice job there swizzle.

Ok, I too slightly modified. I replaced the allspice & paprika w/ Emeril's Essence (cajun seasoning) and Tabasco. Instead of tomato sauce, I used a 28oz can of Italian-style tomatoes so it can be converted to a pasta sauce. I drizzled the sauce over the peppers and Artichoke Tortellini (frozen @ Trader Joes). Very good!

These were great. Since other reviewers mentioned bland I added additional spices: entire package fresh oregano, worcestershire sauce and tabasco. I was also quite heavy handed with the garlic and parsley. I also used plenty of olive oil and garlic tomato sauce and topped them with plenty of mozzarella cheese. They were bursting with flavor and I will certainly make these again.

This is such a simple and easy dish that gives a lot of flavor for such little work. I made this a second time with a combination of lamb, pork and turkey. Twenty minutes after I put the stuffed peppers in my pressure cooker, my partner and I sat down to a beautiful, richly flavored dinner.

I thought these peppers were very good. Obviously not supposed to be a gourmet recipee, but something quick and healthy you can serve to your family. For those of you who have said that this recipee is rather bland you may need to use better spice. Lower quality (supermarket) spices don't have the flavor that high quality spices do. Sweet paprika and allspice when fresh and high quality are nothing but flavorful! ALso, use hot paprika instead of sweet if you desire a "zip"

I made this recipe using sausage meat (which I cooked first to get rid of as much grease as possible) and homemade tomato sauce which contained lots of garlic and basil . I used quite a bit more sauce than called for. We enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special. To the fellow cook in the U.K. one cup = 8 ounces or 250 grams.

Rating: 3
Pretty good overall, but a tad bland. We added some Tabasco sauce and some Monterey Jack cheese and that helped a lot. If I were to make it again, I would add some chili powder initailly to give it some zing. Also, I would use more tomato sauce for the last simmering step to enhance the sweetness of the peppers.

What a superb web site! I'm a disaster in the kitchen but love to try. One thing I need to know, please? When a recipe says "cup", approx what measurement is this? I will the stuffed red bell peppers and let you know how I got on. Hope you are able to help me. Many thanks Carol

my husband made this and we both thought it was very good. i am not sure i would prepare it for a most special dinner -- but maybe for a buffet if i were having a casual get together for over 8-10 -- requires little attention and almost no mess. to those who worry it might be bland --ADD SPICE, i also considered doing this with ground lamb. and no, you are not supposed to pre-cook the meat.

We really enjoyed this dish, and as the previous reviewer stated, it was quite easy to prepare. The seasonings were just right, and, if you're like me and don't eat red meat, ground turkey makes a great substitute for the ground beef! All in all, a great comfort food recipe, and...don't forget the mashed potatoes!

Fantastic recipe, and SO easy. The recipe is also easy to reduce -- I used four peppers and reduced the other indredients by one third, and it came out perfectly.
