I've made this many, many times and it never fails to wow.

This was a very good recipe. Not having made much yeast bread before, I found this very easy. The results were tasty and both my husband and I were very satisfied. Went great with homemade hummus!

This recipe is awesome! I love the shape of the bread (mini round loaves), because it's very presentable and you can give it away to more than one person (vs. a whole loaf). The bread is fragrant and moist. I just learned how to make bread by hand and this one was easy and good!

This bread was very tasty, and it turned out pretty enough for me to give it in a gift basket. The onion makes the bread moist, while the fennel gives it a great aroma. It was also pretty easy to make. Ensure you have good yeast.

Delicious and aromatic bread! Easy to make and flavorful without butter. Goes very well with pork dishes!
