This was tasty but was very lightly flavored and needed a touch more sea salt. As the description says, these mushrooms are a great compliment to a Korean meal. OTOH, if you are looking for a side dish to stand on its own, I's sub EVOO for the veg oil, add fresh chopped garlic and finish with a little broth or wine instead of cider vinegar.

This is a great dish and quite surprising in flavor for the few ingredients. Have made it many times.
