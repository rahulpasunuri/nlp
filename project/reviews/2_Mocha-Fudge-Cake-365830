This cake was easy to make and very moist. It did seem to lack a little something in the flavor department. The chocolate and the coffee were delicious, but very subtle and I think that if you are going to serve this, it really does needs the ice cream or some kind of glaze or frosting. I wanted to send this to work with my husband to share with his coworkers, but it wasn't really good enough on its own. I'm going to try it with a cream cheese or chocolate glaze next time if I want it to carry well. And I'll try it with ice cream if I want to serve it at home.
