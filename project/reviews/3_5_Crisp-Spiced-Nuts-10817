I've made this recipe ever since it came out in 1994. ALWAYS a hit whether brought to parties or given away as gifts. I don't know why other people have problems with it. I've also subbed other nuts on occasion -- no problems there either. Maybe the size of the egg whites? If I feel I have a bit too much batter I just add another handful of nuts... Once I brought this to my hubby's relative's party and YIKES it was a little too popular that some of the other "little bites" got snubbed. Don't do that, or people won't like you :D

Per reviews, I increased the amount of nuts to 6 cups, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. My oven temp is dead on but these were beyond crispy at 25 minutes, even with stirring every 10 minutes, resulting in a waste of premium nuts for a less than tasty result. I'll find another spiced nuts recipe since I won't be making these again.

Simple to make and delicious. As a preparation note, you must take the nuts out of the pan and separate them on foil while they cool. I did not and had a difficult time prying them off the foil in the pan in which I baked them. They are, however, very tasty. 25 minutes on convection roast in my oven.

The recipe worked perfectly for me as written. The only adjustments I made were to add cumin and fresh thyme to the spice mix and sub brown sugar for white. It's the perfect level of heat to please most palates, but if you like things super-spicy, adding more cayenne would be good, too.

Definitely cut half of the paprika. I've made these loads of time, and the are always a hit. Have added fresh ground coriander too. Nice savor sweet mix!

Excellent recipe. Like others said, use all the batter and don't skimp on the cayenne pepper as it gives the nuts a kick. I made recipe exactly as written. Use a Silpat and make sure you turn every 10 minutes so nothing sticks or burns. Mine baked 45 minutes as I made a larger quantity.

These are so delicious, I have no idea why some reviewers had trouble. Maybe they forgot to bake them;) Make sure you use all the batter, it seems like too much for the nuts but don't make the mistake I did and leave the excess in the bowl.

Used the recipe as-is, but was rather disappointed. The cayenne and sugar were the dominant flavors. Nuts were rather sticky. Okay recipe, not anything special.

Rating: 3
Subtly spicy and delicious, even though I burnt them slightly. The recipe is a bit misleading: Do NOT bake until crisp -- the nuts will crisp up as they cool, and if you try to bake them until they're crisp, you'll end up with a whole lot of burnt nuts. So, bake 'em until they're golden and call it a day. Also, I decreased the cayenne to about 1 teaspoon on account of the kiddie contingent, but I wish I hadn't, since they could have used more zip. Nevertheless, despite being somewhat burnt and missing some fire, even the crumbs got eaten!

I eliminated the butter, baked and cooled on parchment. I added 1 tsp. ground cumin for a little smokiness.

Don't touch a thing but the quantity of nuts, I've found 7 cups of nuts (I like whole almonds, walnuts and pecans) is a good amount for the amount of "batter." I feel like I've found my nut recipe for life-ha :)

I have made this recipe every Christmas for the last 3 years. Now people literally wait for us to show up with our "Crisp Spiced Nuts". It's a big hit.

Excellent recipe! I have made it many times and always get asked for a copy. I made one adjustment this time. I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder. The flavor was subtle but paired nicely with the spice of the cayenne pepper - similar to the flavors in a mole. A definite keeper.

Three and a half forks! Everyone I serve these nuts to loves them. The purpose of the egg whites is to keep the sugar and spices attached to the nuts while they bake. This does make them slightly stickly during baking but they crisp up quickly out of the oven. I have put these out before dinner with appetizers and after dinner with desserts. They were also perfect on top of a butternut squash soup we had at Thanksgiving.

I thought this was delicious. i used a vegetarian Worcestershire Sauce i bought on a trip to a bourbon distillery in Versailles, KY. It was bourbon barrel aged and sweetened with sorghum which I thought added an identifiable earthy sweetness. i also used a bourbon smoked paprika that i bought on the same trip. Additionally I changed the nuts to all walnuts. it was even a nice complement in salad.

Nuts about these nuts! The key to success is to line the baking sheet with parchment and spray it with a non-stick spray like Pam. I also use a silicone spatula to turn the nuts when they are baking. This time I used an extra egg white because I added an additional portion of nuts. I have to hide them if I plan to bring them anywhere because my husband eats them as they are cooling.

Excellent! I used only 1 TBL of paprika and substituted ginger, cinnamon, and some garlic. Might use a little less butter next time.

Very disappointing. Minimal spice; definately no "kick." I am not sure what the eggs whites added other than a mess to clean up.

Rating: 2
Not sure that the egg whites were necessary here. Not as spicy as I would have liked. Lacking a big of zing.

These are so fast and easy to make. I use whatever nut I have handy. Initially was tentative about the cayenne since some people are not spice lovers but after reducing the amount the first time I now make it as the recipe states. They are great. Especially with drinks.

We loved these!! I used brown sugar, and just a little more than 1 teaspoons cayenne as I'm not that crazy about super-hot food. After 50 minutes in the oven they were perfect. We will definitely make this again :-)

Fabulous! I made these for co-worker gifts - everyone loved them. I have more in the oven now to take to a party. I adjusted based on previous reviews - 1/2 c sugar, 4 T butter, 6 c total nuts, and extra cayenne. They seemed sticky, but after about 40 minutes they began to dry. Baked about 10 minutes longer. After cooling, they were perfect. Starts slightly sweet but finished with a zing. Yum!

This is the first time I will say that I wish I had not followed other reviewers' opinions. I always adjust my recipes based on the reviews(when I think it's needed or would suit my palette) and have never been let down. I wish I had left this recipe alone. The adjustment I wish I hadn't touched was the sugar. Next time I will keep it as is. To save time I just tossed in two large cans of mixed nuts (mine was 50% less peanuts) and it was a good proportion. However, be VERY careful, the hazelnuts are the first to burn and didn't think they were that great so I just pulled them anyhow. I will make again as I trust this was a good recipe before the adjustments.

As a heart patient, I upped the quantity of nuts by 50%, added an egg white, and I cut the sugar from 3/4 C to 1/3 C and the butter from 6T to 2T. These nuts were great, still crispy and tasty. I used brazil nuts, almonds, pecans and pistachios, best thing I've ever done with the brazils. I let them cool barely to room temp and tightly closed them in a jar. They were still great for a party six days later. Great recipe!

Yuck. I made this for a cocktail party and nobody touched it.

I double this recipe everytime I make these nuts (about a dozen times now)-- boy, do they go FAST!! The only adjustment I make - forego the hazelnuts and add cashews instead. They are scrumptious and I have to hide them from my husband so he doesn't scarf them down before our guests arrive. Almost everyone who tries these nuts rave and ask for the recipe.

Based on feedback in ALL earlier reviews, I made the following adaptations: *Used only 1/3 cup sugar; *Used 3 teaspoons cayenne; *Baked 35 minutes, stirring at 10 minute intervals. All guests were very positive.

This is the best! A perfect combination of sweet, salty, and spicy. My husband can't wait for me to make these every Christmas. They are his (and my) favorite!

The bad reviews sound like they were for a different recipe. I always make this for parties, and they're always a hit. I also throw in a little extra cayenne. Once or twice they've become a little sticky (it was probably humid in the kitchen), but everyone still liked them.

I really didn't like this recipe, neither the flavor (weird) or the coating (which was too candy like).

I have made this several times, adding extra cayenne and using pecans, almonds, walnuts and cashews instead of the suggested combination. It is always a hit. These taste nothing like cracker jacks! Gotta love the burn!

If you are looking for cloyingly sweetish nuts that resemble the flavor of CrackerJacks, then this is the recipe for you. I've successfully made spiced nuts using many different recipes. This one didn't work for me, although I followed the recipe to a T. This was a big dissapointment and a waste of ingredients.

Great dish! Some nuts cooked more quickly than others so watch them carefully.

Tasty party snack~ I added an extra dash of cayenne. Works well with other nut combintions, too.

Good, but not great-- definitely add more cayenne or they end up losing their heat. Maybe I just like a sweet version better; I have a recipe that is very similar but uses cinnamon and sugar instead of the paprika and cayenne that always gets raves. Definitely tasty, but doctor them up a bit.

Just made this exactly as written. Yummmmmm. I made it for a shower tomorrow night and I think I will need to make another batch already. It is cooling on the counter right now and I have already started picking at it. Extremely easy to make and came out delicious.

These nuts are addictive. Beware!! Somehow, I completely forgot to add the butter...they turned out fine, but the coating probably didn't adhere the way it was supposed to. I agree that there was more than enough coating for the nuts. I'm sitting here munching on them as I am typing this!

Wow! These are good! Can't stop eating them!!! I made them with pecans, walnuts, and cashews. There was a lot of batter, and I was able to coat half again as many nuts as called for in the recipe (a little over 6 cups of nuts, rather than just 4 1/2). Baked them for 30 minutes, stirring twice. Then spread them in a big foil roasting pan to cool. They crisped up beautifully as they cooled. They're sweet with just a slight kick. Next time I'll probably up the cayenne, too. Or maybe try the cumin. Yum. Can't wait to make the next batch!

WOW! Good thing I doubled the recipe! I couldn't stop eating them while I was making them. I used walnuts & pecans and they were fabulous. These are great for holiday gifts & I'll be sure to include the recipe.

These were sooooo yummy. I used all pecans and added cumin. They turned out incredible. Next time I'll add a touch more cayenne though, for a little extra heat. Great recipe for the holidays.

Vary the nuts to suit your taste. I don't think peanuts would work, but anything else is wonderful. I used almonds, pecans and walnuts. Sometimes I have used macadamias too. Easy, and different. Can increase spice for hot freaks.

I loved the spiced mixture for the nuts and nibbled on them while I was baking them. My only disappointment was that they did not retain their level of spiciness after they cooled. I served them for a New Year's Eve party and they were a big success. I will make these again for a party.

Very tasty and very easy. Everyone raved about them at Thanksgiving. I used pecans, almonds (raw - couldn't find blanched) and cashews. Don't bake until crisp - coating will crisp as soon as it cools.

I made these nuts for this year's Thanksgiving during cocktails. Lots of people liked them and raved about them, but I myself wasn't crazy about them. I guess I'm not really crazy about hazelnuts. Maybe next time I'd use some different kinds of nuts.

A hit with my guests...I made it with only walnut halves and they were fabulous. Store in a covered container as they pick up moisture from the air quite quickly. Delicious!
