i think this recipe is a good basic clam chowder recipe that is very easy to make but could use some additions. i.e. tabasco sauce, bay leaf, fresh parsley, extra clams, chopped up shrimp, liquid smoke... you get the idea

This was good soup, but there was nothing amazing about it and frankly, I am already searching for a new recipe. It just seemed like it was missing something.

I cook the onions in butter and add a second can of clams. Let it thicken in a slow cooker for a perfect meal on a chilly day.

Use fresh clams (quahogs if you can)and maybe a bay leaf. Nice and simple like a real New England Clam Chowder. I would make it again. If you want a "Rode Island" version, leave out the cream and milk. Not as exciting, but good for the waistline.

A great recipe. I added a little extra clams and thickened the soup by creaming 1/2 cup of the cooked potatoes. Turned out great and everyone enjoyed the soup.

Fast,easy,and very good. I added 50% more clams and may add some fresh non-canned clams next time but as is, the recipe is very very good.

I did add additional bacon to this recipe. For a different texture, and because I didn't have enough clams, I added a can of crabmeat. It wasn't all bad. My family loved it.

Easy, Fast, and Tasty. Yes, I will be making this again, although I will add fresh chopped parsley the next time. Other than that I think we have a winner in our home!

Dontcha just love when people make drastic changes to a recipe and then wonder why it didn't come out the way it should have? And then they rate it 2 forks! How could anyone substitute 2% milk and expect it to taste like a cream based soup??

Made this for my finiky 15-yr. old step-daughter, and it was the first time she ever complemented my cooking. I myself have never liked clam chowder, until now!

I combined this recipe with ingredients from the Smoky Clam Chowder recipe, to delicious results. I did add a bit of extra bacon as well. Very warming on a cold winter's night. Served with some warm French bread and a good chablis - bliss!

I usually add a little more bacon, I like lots of flavour, but this is an excellent basic recipe for clam chowder. I make it often and everybody loves it!

I took the suggestions from those who had tried it already, and edited the recipe by adding an extra small can of chopped clams, salt, pepper, and beau monde for some seasoning. It was fabulous! Will definitely be a regular at out house...

I used fresh, uncooked, chopped clams, 2% milk, salt and pepper. Other than this, I followed the recipe to the letter. Honestly, it tasted more like potato bacon soup than clam chowder. It was hearty, filling and wonderful but not what I was looking for. I will probably make this again, with different expectations of the outcome.

Delicious, (after adding salt and pepper) but I forgot to chop the bacon. Also, I used 2% milk. I'll be making this one again! There are other recipies out there, but these ingredients are easy to find.
