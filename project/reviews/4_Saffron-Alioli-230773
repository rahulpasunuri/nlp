Sinfully blissful and really quite good. I double the saffron and tinker with the lemon and tomato paste to taste. It routinely is the 'crowd pleaser' of the night, and is GONE in no time flat.

This was a great recipe. Fit well with the croquetas and took about 5 minutes to make. I'm currently in Ecuador and couldn't find any saffron so I used Paprika instead. Still very successful and delicious sauce. So for anyone on a budget or who is finding it difficult to find saffron, paprika works just fine--and it´s still Spanish!!

Great sauce. I made this sauce to accompany Tortilla de Patatas and Beef Empanadas; it was a huge hit at my Tapas themed party. I substituted mayo and garlic for a gourmet garlic mayo, but kept the rest the same. This recipe is quick and easy.

I made this to accompany the Potato Croquetas, as recommended. It's a snap to make: 5 minutes, at most if you have th ingredients. It's quite good, but I felt it was missing something, so I added a few dashes of Hot Sauce, and in my book, that did the trick! BTW, if yo are using the Potato Croquetas as a part of a main course, rather than an appetizer, in my opinion, the sauce is not necessary, because the Croquetas stand up well on their own. but this is certainly a very versatile sauce, as the other reviewers have suggested, and is so easy to make, that it's not even an effort! The expense of the saffron would be the only concern, and frankly, so little of it is used, that it may not even be necessary.

Very popular condiment whenever I make it. And so versatile. Works with anything from croquettes to veggies to crab cakes.

Very easy to make. I served it with roasted red potatoes and got rave reviews!
