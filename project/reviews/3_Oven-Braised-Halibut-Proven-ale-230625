The base (fennel, etc.) was very good, but overwhelmed the fish. Used Mahi Mahi because that's what the supermarket had. The fish was tasteless, which was the problem. Then again, the base was very strong and I have to wonder what kind of fish could stand up to it.

Made this with swordfish steaks because it was what I had on hand. Left them whole, which made a nice presentation. A quick, simple, tasty dish. I left out the clam juice as well, because it didn't look like it needed more liquid.

Didn't seem to have a lot of flavor, to me. It was fine, but not something I'd make again.

Excellent dish that I would repeat for company. We prepared this as written. I think finishing it off in the oven really helps the vegetables roast beautifully.

This was a wonderful, easy dish. The only thing I did differently was I didn't bother putting the skillet in the oven - I finished it over the stove. I'll be making this again very soon.

My husband I both thought this was a delicious dish....I would absolutely make this again.

I am having a little trouble with the whole four fork thing because i think people toss it around rather lightly. "A dish beyond compare" should make you faint, cry or fall in love. That said, this was a very good recipe. Very easy, very tasty, very impressive in presentation. I left out the clam juice as it didn't seem to need more liquid and i wasn't serving it over a carbo. more olives, more garlic (as always) and the family mentioned it first thing this a.m.

Very tasty.......BUT expensive (halibut). I served this with crusty bread and a green salad.
