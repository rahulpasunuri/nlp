This is the first time I have made something that was so highly rated and had such a poor experience. I am usually up for a challenge in the kitchen, and I am a big believer that doing things homemade is the way to go. I was SO disappointed with this! I will chalk it up 90% to a terrible experience with the chestnuts - I have never worked with them before, and I had a rough time peeling them (yes, I cut the x in them, etc). But even getting passed that, the soup was pretty bland. I was expecting a lot more flavor. Maybe my chestnuts were bad - I don't know since I havent worked with them before. But there is no way I am trying this one again. :(

This is a very good soup with unique taste. I made some changes as: 1. used one cube of low sodium vegetable bouillon for 2 cups of water (The Organic Gourmet has a great veg. bouillon), 2. used 1 1/2 tbsp butter, and 3. used the Trader Joes peeled and cooked chesnuts (they are awesome, you will never buy others after trying this one). Although tastes great, my husband and I agreed that the recipe should ask for less butter and cream. I will try 1 tbsp butter and 1/2 of the cream next time. I read in other reviews some people used half and half instead; this could be also a good try.

Big expectations. We ended up a little disappointed, maybe next time we'll add some crisp bacon bits on top with the garnish. Just was not quite what we had expected, but will make again.

I love this soup and so does everyone I've served it to. I made this for our neighborhood potluck Thanksgiving. I couldn't find rutabaga, so I used parsnips, but otherwise followed recipe pretty closely. I used a little less butter and half and half instead of cream.

This was delicious and a big hit at my dinner party this weekend. I can't wait to have lunch today to finish off the leftovers! I didn't change anything in this recipe...

I love this soup. It adds elegance to any dinner party, is great for the holidays and it's easy once you deal with the chestnuts. Someone complained about squash making the soup too sweet, but there's no squash in this recipe.

Really wonderful and as with any soup you may tinker w recipe, depending on what you have on hand & your style. my changes: 1/2 & 1/2 instead of cream; 1 veggie bouillon cube into 1 cup of water (instead of 2 cups); dried shitakes instead of porcinis; leeks instead of shallots; mix sauteed veggies right into pot instead of individually dividing into bowls. This recipe really celebrates chestnuts!

I made the soup as the recipe instructed. I have made it for various dinner parties and have yet to have anyone not enjoy it. The porcini mushrooms are a key to the flavor compliment. The sauteed root vegetables were a perfect topping. I have used the root vegetable topping on pureed cauliflower, that too was a big hit.

Complex and delicious, a delightful mix of flavors. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I, too, used mixed dried mushrooms rather than all porcini. The mushroom and chestnut tastes are wonderful together and the root veg topping sets them off perfectly. I made this a day or two ahead and found that it thickened substantially in the refrigerator. A great soup for those who appreciate unusual flavors.

It's a fantastic soup! Got much appreciation from a very critical chef!! Ended up not using any sherry and I used a mix of dried mushrooms easily available in supermarkets - was still delicious.
