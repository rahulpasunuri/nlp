I made this at the request of my daughter-in-law for her birthday dinner. It was truly memorable. But the skordalia, even with twice the recommended amount of roasted garlic, needed more garlicky taste. Next time, I will cut back on the almonds so that they are not as prominent, competing with the garlic. I will also roast more tomato which is so good.

Beautiful, easy and impressive. I added a mint, basil and olive oil sauce on top that gave it some nice added flavor. I made this once and now my husband asks for it all the time. Yummy!!!!

My MIL introduced me to this recipe and I was hooked from the first bite! It is SO delicious. I've made it for my family and they love it. Yes, it takes time to make, but I don't mind cooking like that, especially when the results are this tasty!

this recipe is delicious! my husband devoured it! it is reminiscent of eggplant parmesan without all the cheese! even if the "skordalia" isn't a true representation, it still resembles what i have tasted in a greek restaurant and compliments the crunchy eggplant very well. i doubled the roasted garlic as suggested, but it was a little too much garlic. the recipe may be time consuming, but you can cut some corners by roasting the garlic with the tomatoes for the first hour, and just read ahead so you can prep the next step while one is soaking or roasting, etc. when everything is done, i would just assemble on an oven safe plate and keep in oven at 200 degrees while i finish any other items. i served this with balsamic roasted squash that i just threw together and some garlic bread. i can't wait for leftovers!

It's a lot of effort and makes a great presentation. However, I agree with the other reviewer that it's really hard to time - especially if you're going to serve it with anything else. Like most recipes on Epicurious, read ahead hours before you plan on making something. I stuck to the recipe for the most part. However, I think you can skip soaking of eggplant in 4 cups of whole milk for an hour. I don't think it made any difference and it's a huge waste of milk.

Wow.. this has great flavors.. Ok I tweaked the recipe so it was easier - but followed the true spirit of the recipe. I used sun-dried tomatoes.. used the food processor to make it like a tapanade. I used 2 heads of roasted garlic, per the suggestion. And used an extra clove of minced for the skordalia. Amazing how much garlic but not overpowering at all. I'm Greek and agree this is not true skordalia - but I don't think most folks would really want skordalia in this quantity. I salted, rinsed and marinated the eggplant with Olive oil, oregano, garlic & red pepper & grilled them. Prepped everything ahead of time.. Assembled in a pyrex pan (with eggplant on the bottom so it's easier to server. Warmed in 225 degree oven. Served with Grilled halibut with a caper, shallot, tomato, lemon, wine saute. Guests loved it.. can't wait to show it off again.

If you want non-dairy skordalia, use olive oil. I've never used butter or creams. Add until you like the consistancy - like sour cream. There is far too little garlic here - skordalia isn't garlic-flavored mashed potatoes, but a starch-based vehicle for the garlic. I also use softened bread, about equal volume to the potato (soaked in milk, but you can work around that). Sort of lightens up the potatoes. And usually room temp or cold (maybe not for this dish). It is great on grilled veg.

This recipe was a huge hit at my dinner party. Not only is it a delicious combination of flavors, but it looks gorgeous when served! It was definitely a hit and impressed very well. I left the almonds out of the skordalia because I don't like nuts and I don't think it was missing anything. It was perfect - smooth and creamy. The only thing I'd like to know is if anyone has suggestions for how to make this recipe non-dairy... the skordalia is the most amazing part but I can't always serve dairy to my guests. Ideas?

MMMMMMMMM Very good. I changed it to make it Gluten Free and easier and it only took 1 hour. This was the first time I cooked Eggplant and the whole thing was gone. Down to the last piece that my son shared with the dog. Definatly will make it again.

Excellent flavors and lovely presentation. Worth the effort in my book. I could go on and on but if you have the time, give it a try.

While the recipe takes time, it is easy to make; the presentation is fabulous, and the flavors offer unique blend.

Frankly, this recipe is a lot of work for not a lot of bang. It is hard to time - roast tomatoes, roast garlic, cook potatoes, soak eggplant, fry eggplant - such that everything is not at its peak when you assemble the dish. Anything less than hot won't work for this dish. Luke warm or cold Skordalia (mashed potatoes) are not enjoyable. So - in my mind - if you're going to go to the bother of soaking, coating and frying eggplant - there are a lot of other easier and tastier recipes.

I have made this twice in one week. It is absolutley terrific. I used two heads of garlic the second time and WOW! I don't know if it's authentic Skordalia or not but whatever it is it's worth it. Don't let the length of the recipe scare you away - it's surprisingly easy and gets standing ovations from company.

It's a very interesting concept, visually stunning, but the skordalia doesn't taste right. Skordalia is a garlic condiment, but I couldn't taste the garlic in this recipe, just cream and nuts. It worked just okay with the eggplants, but I think I will add more raw garlic to the next batch of skordalia. N.B. This doesn't keep well at all with all the dairy in the skordalia and the the breading on the eggplants.

ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!! For the first time in my life I had to prepare a no meat meal - and to be honest, this was better than any meat meal I have ever prepared. I did change a few things. I used sun dried tomatoes and pureed them with three cloves of garlic and I used garlic flavored bread crumbs instead of plain. If you want to impress a vegetarian or a meat eater, this is truly the way to go.

I loved this dish! We were having some people over and I decided to make greek food. But i wanted to try something different from the typical souvlaki. So I made these, and they raved reviews. Even my mother (who is very picky) loved them. They make a great first course or a light main course. Delicous!And to the chef from Wetchester County, I re-warmed my leftovers in the oven, so they were still crispy. I tried one in the microvawe, but the eggplant was soggy. And I suggest cutting new fresh tomatoes.

This dish was good, but a lot of work. I did make some changes. I didn't have any fresh basil, since it's winter here, so used store bought pesto. Made a mix of the chopped oven-dried tomatoes & pesto. Used milk instead of whipping cream, added olive oil & more lemon juice in the skordalia. It's not authentic skordalia, so I'd call it "in the style of" skordalia. Didn't have any bread to make crumbs, so used panko. Yes, Japanese bread crumbs for a Greek style dish, it worked. The frying (used olive oil for better taste) of the eggplant made it a little greasy. Next time I'll serve it w/some pita bread, sprinkle some feta in between the eggplant.

I cut down on lots of fat by: marinating the eggplant in buttermilk (didn't have milk on hand), using only one egg to coast, using only light cream and a tablespoon or two in the skordalia--who needs more fat when you throw that lucious roasted garlic in?? The flavors were just as intense and got rave reviews from my husabnd. Will definitely make again when I have the time.

I don't know how to explain how good this recipe is! Fabulously yummy. I made a tray of it using Chinese eggplant instead of regular for a dinner party the second time and it was a rousing success. The fam also loves potatoes so I tend to go a bit heavy on them and avoid the basil. Definitly not snack food, but soooooooooooooooo good!

Excellent - but A LOT of work. I still say it was worth the effort, though. Presentation was lovely. Will definetely prepare whatever I can in advance next time. QUESTION: Any ideas on how to heat (or reheat) before serving if you do the advance prep and them "assemble" these before serving? Microwave? Oven?

This looks very good. I love Greek food and have had a Greek acquaintance tell me how to make Skordalia. It did not contain any sour cream, whipping cream, butter or almonds. So I have to agree with Arva, this recipe sounds good, but it is not Skordalia.

Thanks for the tips! I wonder then if this is better as skordalia (olive oil), or as-is with "mashed potatoes"? Looking forward to trying it because it looks interesting either way.

I completely feel with Avra . I am not Greek, just Italian but adore the dish and hate to see it so wrongly messed up. It happens also too with Italian dishes

Being Greek this dish has been one of our family's summer-favourites (without the tomatoes), usually as a side dish to fried or grilled fish. I just wanted to share my mixed feelings about your recipe: on the one hand I feel proud that greek cuisine is being akcnowledged but on the other hand I feel rather sad about the fact that the trend of "fusion" has completely altered its "personality" - its "philosophy". You would NEVER eat skordalia with sour cream and butter in it, in Greece! You can call it mashed potatoes with garlic and cream but don't call it scordalia! The whole philosophy of greek cooking is about olive oil, not cream! Cream is a "northern" ingredient because there, cow's milk is in abundance and olive oil simply does not exist. Please be carefull with terms - it's ok to be inspired by ethnic cuisines but please don't twist them!

outstanding! worth the effort. made the eggplant in a deep fryer. The skordalia was excellent - the almonds make it. Used whatever tomatos I had on hand - definitely use plum - they hold up better. My boyfriend LOVED it. I think you could make as a layered casserole too for easy serving. May try that next time. Give it a try~
