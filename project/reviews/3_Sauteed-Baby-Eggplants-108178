I tweaked this quite a bit but it tasted good. I had lots of eggplants to use up so I increased the vegetable oil, mirin and soy sauce, maintaining a little more mirin than soy sauce. Instead of sautéing the eggplant, I just peeled and diced the eggplant so more of the sauce would be absorbed. (I eliminated the step of salting the eggplant to draw out the moisture as I am on a salt-restricted diet.) I stir fried the diced eggplant a few minutes, added the mirin and soy sauce, added about 1/2 pound of cubed tofu and mixed thoroughly while continuing to stir fry on medium heat. Then I covered the frying pan and let it steam until the eggplant was translucent. I served it with brown rice. It was delicious, as well as being a complete meal with the tofu as the protein.

Yucky. Worse than "so-so." Managed to be simultaneously too salty and completely bland. I'm fond of eggplant, but couldn't finish a serving of this.

This was a tasteless, terrible recipe. I regret wasting my eggplant on it. My boyfriend and I did have a hearty debate about whether this was "inedible" or just "difficult to eat".

This is one of the very best baby eggplant dishes I have ever tasted. For the cook who found it too oily, my suggestion is to use a cast iron pan, thus requiring very little oil. The only slight change I made was to add an additional tablespoon more mirin to the sauce then the recipe required. My husband I loved this dish. I have every plan to make this recipe again and again and again.

I really enjoyed this. The soy sauce and mirin gave the baby eggplants a nice color. I thought it tasted and looked fabulous. I would make this for our vegetarian friends. My husband dislikes the taste/texture of eggplant and didn't care for it.

I was surprised to see this recipe rated so highly. I followed the recipe precisely and found it to be too salty and too oily. Because we are real eggplant lovers I will make this again using half the amount of soy sauce and very little oil.

This recipe is very easy. I didn't have mirin so I subsituted Chinese rice wine and added some sugar. Also tossed in bean sprouts for added crunch.

I used slender asian eggplant and they were delicious. I served it with Asian Chicken Salad.

Made with Steamed Red Snapper (excellent). Very good. Cooked longer than suggested and added black sesame seeds.
