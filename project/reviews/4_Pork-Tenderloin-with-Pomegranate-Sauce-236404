This is seriously good, good enough to serve at a casual dinner party. I was out of ground cumin so added some garlic powder and dry mustard instead the second time and it worked. You can get away with leaving out the vinegar and butter. Once the loins were browned I baked them in the oven until done. The first time I made the sauce I used cumin seed instead of ground cumin, added a pinch of the other spices to the juice and served it over grocery store baked chicken which seriously elevated it. I alsosprinkled pomegranate arials over both times.

Made this tonight with pork chops. Cooked it all on the stove-top without a problem. Sauce is very nice, although mine never thickened. Will definitely make this again.

This dish is pretty spectacular given that it can be so quickly prepared. The sauce is the star, here, but the pork seasoning creates a nice "crust" of spices (experimented with both pork tenderloin and pork chops). I served this with russet/sweet potato mash and steamed kale for a dinner party of 5 people. Everything was completed under 45 minutes. Very healthy, cost efficient and delicious.

I skipped the coriander (did not have it) and pepper (my kids don't care for spicy), but the pork still turned out really great. Even my son, who is a very picky eater, liked it. Great recipe, will certainly make it again. Served it with potato gnocchis and roasted cauliflower with cumin (which disappeared before the meat hit the dining table - I guess some kids do like their veggies ;-).

absolutely fantastic recipe. substituted balsamic for the sherry vinegar. reduced the sauce a little more that prescribed and it worked awesome. added pomegranate avils to the topping of the medallions and it was an awesome pop to the drizzle. highly recommend this recipe!!!

Delicious sauce. Increased the rub and finished the pork in the oven after searing. Served with roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts braised with balsamic vinegar. Excellent.

Wonderfully rich and aromatic. The pomegranate sauce balances out the spices beautifully. To make for a crowd, I brown the tenderloins in the pan, then finish them on a parchment-lined, rimmed cookie sheet in a 350ºF oven while I finish the sauce separately.

This is truly an outstanding dish. The sauce works so nicely with the spices on the pork. I added minced garlic to the pan and used balsamic vinegar instead of sherry vinegar as suggested by other reviewers. I also opted to keep the tenderloins in the pan on the stovetop rather than transferring them to the oven for a period of time as suggested by some reviewers. I was thrilled with the outcome. The 20-25 minute recommended timeframe for cooking turned out to be perfect. I served the pork with roasted baby yellow potatoes with minced rosemary and a salad with dried cranberries and apples tossed in cranberry pear balsamic vinegar. The whole meal was to die for!

Rating: 4
This was delicious! I cooked the tenderloins until they were medium. Because tenderloins vary in size, watch the amount of time. 20- 25 minutes might be too long. I served them with a cauliflower/potato mash. The sauce is superb and could work with chicken or turkey cutlets.

loved the spices - tasty but mild. Made mistake and bought POM "blueberry" instead of pomegranate, but it was delicious anyway. Will definitely make again.

I doubled the sauce and substituted balsamic vinegar for the sherry vinegar. Everyone loved it. I also brined the pork for about an hour and after browning all sides I covered the pan and it came out moist and delicious.

Rating: 4
The sauce alone is reason enough to make this and the fragrant spices take it to another level. The only change I made was to sub the sherry vinegar with pomegranate balsamic vinegar because thats what I had on hand but otherwise followed the recipe as written. The end result tastes like something you spent a lot more time and effort on than you actually did. The sauce and the rub also pairs beautifully with other meats. Ive tried this with chicken, duck and lamb with equal success.

This is particularly delicious with seared duck breast. Served with celeriac/potato puree and sauteed kale. Easy, fast and fabulous.

Make the sauce in the same pan upon which you sear the pork. Get the pig in the oven, then blast the pan on high heat. Toss in 2 tablespoons of sherry to get those flavors off your expensive pan. Then follow recipe. Good meal to follow.

This recipe was outstanding! I skipped the pomegranate juice and used a pomegranate molasses. You can get this at a middle eastern store. I added 2 tablespoons of sugar, butter and salt. I served with sauteed apples and pears, steamed broccoli and bread. Will certainly make again.

This is a great recipe for during the week - generally easy and certainly tasty - but I find that it takes much longer to cook than the recipe calls for (almost twice as long) and it does make a mess of the cooktop. that said, I do make this often because it is so tasty.

Rating: 4
Delicious, sort-of fancy and easy! I had curry powder on hand, which contained cumin, coriander and cinnamon, so used that instead. The sauce was sweet and a little bit tangy - perfect with the spices on the pork. Served it with a side of potatoes and sauteed swiss chard. Made me feel like a real cook and impressed my chef-husband!

This is a fantastic sauce and a terrific rub. This would work fine on a barbecue, though I took the hint from several reviewers and seared it and finished it in the oven. I actually quadrupled the recipe for the sauce as I was doing four tenderloins - I had another sauce but didn't know which people would like for a big potluck dinner. I took the advice of others and added some sauteed onions with a touch of garlic, used a blackberry balsamic that I have in the house instead of the sherry vinegar, tossed in some dried berries (also in the cupboard - cranberries, blueberries, etc) and used 3 cups pomegranate juice to one cup cranberry. I cooked and reduced the sauce most of the way before folks arrived for dinner. Then I just had to toss it into the searing pan to pick up the spice rub to finish it off. It did get rave reviews and it is definitely a make again. In fact, I am planning to bring it to another function where I have to bring a main course. My rice came out badly so not sure how it would have tasted on that, but I plan to put it next time on a slightly souped up couscous (some chicken broth with raisins). I have reheated by putting it in a small pan with a bit of extra water and the leftover slices of pork, just enough to warm the pork but that does boil off some fluid, and it is still terrific!

Rating: 4
I did this with chicken breasts as well, and even without the sauce,the rub made the chicken extra tasty,with such a short cooking time!Pan-searing the breasts for 3 minutes each side on high heat made for less than 10 minutes total cooking time, and rave reviews! I served it for lunch with garlic fried rice and some simply sauteed vegetables.

Very good the night it is made, but the sauce does not reheat well, so it is best not to plan to have leftovers of this dish.

This was a hit with my family - they loved the sauce and even put it on sandwiches the next day. I would probably reduce the cinnamon a little and add some spice, maybe a little red pepper or paprika to the rub next time.

Love this recipe. It has become a regular in my rotation. A variation that I have used when I don't have pomegranate juice on hand is a rhubarb sauce - just put frozen rhubarb in a small saucepan on low heat while the meat is cooking, it will cook to a sauce. Add sugar to taste.

Rating: 4
One thing I forgot to add to my review below -- I add dried sour cherries to the sauce (I use Trader Joe's Montmarcy Cherries). I soak the cherries in the sauce while the pork's cooking before reducing it down. I've now served this recipe 4 times, and it gets highest raves.

I modified this recipe so that it is so quick, easy and absolutely fantastic I stop strangers at the meat counter who are buying pork to tell it to them! It's this simple: use 2 parts pomegranate MOLASSES, 1 part Balsamic vinegar, and 1 part red wine vinegar. add the spices in the recipe. Stir, then marinate for a few hours. Roast in 350 oven, reserving the marinade on the side. I only had to cook my meat for 35 minutes. Reduce the rest of the marinade and use it as a sauce to drizzle over the sliced tenderloin. This recipe works equally well on lamb, and turns a humble lamb chop into a feast. My husband and I thought it was one of the best things we've ever eaten! I can't wait to make it for company.

My family loved this recipe, even the picky eater. I made extra sauce, froze it, and used it with scallops the next week. I'm making the pork again tonight for friends. The sauce is so good it can be used on just about anything.

I love this recipe! I was a little worried when I read the reviews, but mine turned out perfectly! I used cran-pom juice instead of POM, which probably added extra sweetness to the sauce, and used red wine vinegar instead of sherry... Do not cook the tenderloin in the oven!! Cooking in the pan sealed in the juices, made it so tender! After it got nice and browned I just put a lid on so it wouldn't take forever to cook through.

Rating: 1
I don't know what went so terribly wrong with the sauce! I followed the recipe, and recommendations to reduce the juice to a glaze, but the reduction was so bitter, it was inedible. Sugar didn't help. I had to throw it out and serve the pork alone. The pork was flavorful; unfortunately, I didn't have the time to make a salsa or compote, which would have helped tremendously.

Rating: 3
The pork was lovely yet simple, however, I would suggest putting in more vinegar earlier and use red wine vinegar instead and then reduce the sauce until it is much thicker so that it sticks to the pork. The flavor was tasty though.

Rating: 2
I would really give it one and a half forks. This was the third tenderloin I have made in as many days. The first two were outstanding (Spanish and the Roast Pork with the Cream Corn) so this one paled in comparison. The pork was not as juicy (all 3 were from same package) and the sauce was uninspiring. I had added some caramelized shallots but otherwise followed directions. I even toasted and ground my spices for the rub. (I used jarred in the other recipes). I liked the idea of the pomegranate, but there just was not enough flavor in the sauce. I will keep looking for other recipes using this juice as I think it should work.

Rating: 3
This was a nice change. I expected the sauce to be very tart but it was not. Next time I would reduce to more of a glaze. Great w/baked sweet potato. I made as written but would like to try using garlic/shallot for the sauce base as others suggested. Also will finish in oven next time. May play with this one a bit but great as written.

We've made this twice and it is now a family favorite. Searing the tenderloin cooks it to the perfect done-ness and makes it very tender. The tart sauce compliments the aromatic spice rub well.

I made this dish for a holiday dinner party and it was a huge hit! A few modifications, I'd suggest: 1. Add some minced garlic and shallot to the pork while cooking on the stove. 2. Sear the pork on the stove at med-high heat for 3-4 mins each side, then move to the oven. 350 for about 10 mins - 3. Remove from oven at 140 (if you like it a bit on the pink side) & use a meat thermometer to check. Let stand while you make the sauce. 3. For sauce, use balsamic instead of the sherry vinegar. Nice tang. Everyone raved about it and it was easy to cook with a crowd standing around waiting to eat!

Delicious alternative to turkey for Thanksgiving. Preped tenderloins as indicated in recipe, browned in the pan and then finished in the oven as previous reviewers suggested. Doubled the sauce and made the following changes: Sauteed 1/2 chopped onion in olive oil and salt until soft. Add 1 bottle (2C) of Pom pomegranate juice, 1/2C dry white wine, 1/2tsp black pepper and bay leaf. Simmer until reduced by approximately half. Remove from heat and strain. Add liquid back to pan, add 1tsp white wine vinegar and 2tsp cornstarch (dissolved with small amount of water). Bring to low boil to thicken, reduce heat to low and add butter. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Sauce and tenderloins can be made ahead of time. Finish tenderloins in oven while warming sauce. Great meal to do ahead for entertaining.

Rating: 3
Very juicy and delicious. Added some black plums to sauce because I had them laying around, and that was a nice touch. Overall, very delicious recipe. The only thing I changed was that after browning I set them to bake in the oven on 400 degrees for 20 minutes to cook through (my tenderloins were thicker and weighed more than was recommended).

This recipe exceeded my expectations. . . it was delicious and easy to make. The spice rub and the sauce were well balanced and complemented each other very well. I usually don't panfry pork tenderloins so I was shocked by how moist it was. I didn't have Sherry vinegar so I mixed a little Madeira wine and champagne vinegar. This one's definitely a keeper.

My husband and I made this for the first meal we cooked for his parents and it was a big hit. He insisted on a meat and potatoes meal and I was determined to do something interesting with it. The spice mixture is perfect and while it was searing, the scent was divine. We did finish it in the oven at 425, though, and it needed a good amount of time. We made this with the caramelized shallot mashed potatoes recipe on this site and used 1/4 of the caramelized shallots from that recipe for this sauce, which was lovely. The sauce went amazingly well with the mashed potatoes as well. Also served with an shaved parmesan and arugula salad and added a bit of pomegranate juice to the vinaigrette, which tied everything together quite nicely. Cannot wait to make this again.

I rated this as 3 forks only because I was not so sure about the sauce. The sauce was not bad, but I guess it just didn't do it for me. On the other hand, I would rate the pork a 5 fork if I could.

The spice crust on the tenderloins is amazing. Surprisingly, thought, I was a bit underwhelmed by the sauce, even though we squeezed our own pomegranates. Somehow, the flavors just didn't meld. But I would make just the pork again...and again. (I agree that one should about double the sauce - there wasn't nearly enough.)

Great. My pork tenderloins weren't evenly sized, and it took about 40 min to get the larger one cooked through. Served it with baked yams, and didn't need any seasoning for the yams - just use the sauce!

The whole family really liked this. The seasoning for pork is delish! Would even try it on chicken sometime. Yummy with or without pomegranate sauce (like it better with but one family member wasn't so adventerous and still enjoyed the meal). Sauce is really good, too. Leftover sauce was good on vanilla ice cream! Definately would make again. Simple and elegant.

My husband doesn't eat pork, so I made this recipe using salmon instead. I seared the salmon in my cast iron skillet in the oven. I warm the skillet up in the oven at 450 and cook the salmon about 3 minutes each side. Of course, you can adjust according to your temperature preference. The spice mixture was great with the salmon, and it was a quick, easy and pretty meal. I believe it would taste great using chicken, too.

The mixture of spices along with the sauce were amazing.

A good, fast and easy example of pork with fruit - reminiscent of a typical pork-cranberry combo. The spice mix tasted great charred on the tenderloin, but I made the sauce in a fresh pan, since so much of the spice was left blackened in the pan in which the pork was cooked. I've had better pork + fruit sauce dishes so I won't make this again, but it was definitely worth doing the once.

I'm usually pretty harsh with reviews on here, but really liked this. I'd bought a package of boneless pork chops that were, no joke, 4" thick, mini-pork roasts. The 3 in the package weighed 5.5 lbs. While I've not ever bothered the butcher to get chops like that, I had to buy them. I rather wondered about the cinnamon in the rub...not a huge fan of cinnamon. Obviously I had to cook the 2 chops that would fit in the pan for a while longer than the recipe called for. I also reduced the Pom sauce to a glaze. Very yummy, visually pleasing & interesting. With such thick chops it was easy to keep them a bit rare in the middle which is what we prefer, but one chop was wayyyy too much for one person! :)

Rating: 3
Simple, and fast. The pomegranate sauce provides a nice contrast with the richness of the pork. I reduced sauce to be a little thicker and would therefore double the quantity of sauce next time. Since I already had it in my pantry, I subsituted pomegranate vinegar instead of sherry vinegar.

This dish was ok, but nothing more. It was my first time cooking with pomegranate juice, so I was expecting an exotic taste. The taste was good, but nothing memorable. I agree with a previous reviewer that the sauce would be better as a glaze, but even that wouldn't make the dish anything exceptional. I could see myself making this dish again only if I found myself with a pork loin to cook and some pomegranate juice in the fridge that I had to use up.

My husband made this for a dinner party, and we all liked it except him! While the rest of us all commented on how interesting it was, he thought it wasn't interesting enough. Pork was tender & tasty with the rub, sauce was tasty. Very easy & not time-consuming, but also not super convenient to do for dinner guests, because it ties you up in the kitchen for about half an hour right before dinner -- not very social for the host. So we may adapt this one so it can be roasted (after browning on the stove top). It went really well with roasted red potatoes & roasted carrots.

Rating: 3
Good and unique sauce for pork, but not as spectacular as I had hoped. Would give it 2.5 rather than 3 if I could. I think next time I'd rather make more of a glaze, with the sauce much thicker. The spices on the pork paired nicely... I browned pork in the pan and then finished off in the oven. I paired with steamed red bliss potatoes and a butternut squash souffle. I think next time I would pair with brussel sprouts... letting the sweetness of the sauce play against the bitterness of the sprouts. Note: If you cannot find pomegranate juice, then buy fresh pomegranates and make it yourself. Seperate the seeds from the pith in a large pot of water... the seeds will sink while everything esle floats. Put all of the seeds in a blender long enough to break them up. Use a fine strainer or seive, pressing down on solids, to extract the juice. I highly recommond boiling it down a bit to make more concentrated.

Rating: 4
Great use of good ingredients. Pomegrante juice is difficult to find in a regular store in my part ot the country. Glad my lucky find (in a store out of state) was able to be paired so nicely and quickly for great results. Did double the sauce -- my family is a great fan of sauces. This dish goes suprisingly well with sweet potato fries.
