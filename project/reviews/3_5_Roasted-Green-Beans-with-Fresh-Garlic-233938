I made this recipe with some changes for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. Left out the garlic (because one family member is allergic). Prepared the Soy Glazed Almonds from the recipe for Green Beans with Cilantro and Soy Glazed Almonds. Everyone raved. (I had tried out the roasted green beans with cashews, and the family panned it because the cashews gave off some much oil that the green beans were oily.) The Soy Glazed Almonds are a very flavorful (and easy) addition.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and used a zip lock bag to coat the green beans. This is a simple recipe and they come out better then if you steam them.

I use this method to make asparagus, my husband wont eat them any other way! i cant wait to try it for green beans!

MUCH better way to prepare green beans than steaming them. A little oily at the end, but that problem is ameliorated by using tongs to remove them from the tray so all the oil stays on the tray.

my husband and i are on a limited diet for a little while and i came across this recipe looking for something simple. i took a previous poster's advice and shook the oil, garlic and a touch of salt in a bag then roasted it all (minus the bag, of course.) it took about 20 min at 450 to brown them. oh, we called them "green bean french fries" for our 2 year old and he devoured them.

Wow my husband flipped over these. I cooked mine a little longer after adding the garlic and they were great.

We love green beans but this recipe did not turn out well. The green beans were fairly even in size, but still did not cook evenly. Some were burnt and other still raw.

very yummy, didnt have green beans so substituted with sugarsnap peas. i'm sure it would have been a 4fork if i had green beans.

Really good and easy dish for a buffet. I roasted a red pepper and sliced it to the size of green beans and added to the dish. The red and green were pretty together and tasted great. Dish is fine hot or room temp. I agree with others, a splash of vinegar or squeeze of lemon after beans are cooked mixes with the oil clinging to the beans makes a good addition.

I made these for a dinner party and everyone loved them. I did add one major thing and that was the red pepper sauce from the Spinch Souffle and Red pepper dish. YUM YUM YUM!

Very easy and tasty way to prepare green beans. Instead of pepper, I used a few drops of very spicy chili oil. Yummy.

I have been making this for years but prepare it a little differently. I toss the green beans (usually the kind that is already cleaned and trimmed in a bag) in a large Ziploc bag with the olive oil (sometimes butter too), lots of minced garlic, salt & pepper. Dump everything on a baking sheet and cook for about 10 minutes tossing only half way through to get the nice browned parts. Easy & Delicious!! I also prepare asparagus like this - it's the only way fiance will it it now!

Even with the marginal green beans I got at the grocery store, this recipe was delicious! A nice easy new way to cook green beans.

Have now made this quick and easy dish twice. First for my husband and myself. He expressed how normally he would not think to eat green beans but asked for seconds of this taste treat! Made it again last night for company and they begged for the recipe! I would suggest 1.5 lbs for 6 people as the great flavor causes people to go back for more.

Great side dish--I sprinkled some fresh lemon juice on the beans right before serving.

I saw this recipe in January while visiting my sister in Florida. I made it, from memory, when I got home (I only forgot the pepper!). I halved the recipe for the two of us and my husband and I both wished I had made more. I made it a week later for a dinner party. One of the male guests said he normally didn't like green beans but really liked mine! It is definitely a recipe I will make over again. Easy and very tasty.
