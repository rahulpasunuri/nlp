I wish the recipe had stated to let the couscous completely COOL before using- I guess I should have thought that through... I ended up with a soupy mess. It's still edible but doesn't look great. So disappointing to put in the effort and have it fall flat.

This is fabulous! Even after doubling the banana as suggested below, I still wished there was more... I'd do 2 or 3 bananas next time...

I made this for a Moroccan dinner and everyone LOVED it! We served it with pineapple (canned) and toasted coconut, which I thought made the dish. Like others mentioned, I used the entire banana. I will definitely make this again.

Agree with others to use full banana - or more. Might suggest some toasted coconut either in or sprinkled on. Nice light dessert.

Really yummy, really easy, and unique. There were no leftovers in my house.

This recipe was very tasty light and creamy texture. An unusual use of couscous! Could do the same thing with cooked rice if you wanted. I would make some adjustments to make it a little sweeter to suit my sweet tooth! Maybe sweeten the whipping cream a little or add more brown sugar when cooking the banana. Also, half a banana isn't enough. I used a whole banana and it could still have used more. Makes six desserts perfectly and quickly.

I loved this recipe. I will make again. Next time I will increase banana and use more fresh pineapple.

Very light and tasty. I couldn't find fresh pineapple in the grocery store so I used canned and it was fine. In fact, the pineapple makes this dessert work. The idea of couscous in whipped cream did not appeal to my husband or son but when they finally agreed to taste it, they both really liked it. I whipped the cream a little beyond "soft peaks" and in retrospect I should have followed those instructions more carefully because it probably made the texture a bit drier. I would certainly make this again but would be more careful about that part of the process.
