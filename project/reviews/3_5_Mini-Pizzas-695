These are so easy and freeze well. I've also made them with tomato-basil filling and porcini mushroom filling, each way has been a big hit at any party.

I teach cooking for kids and they loved this recipe.One change I made was adding additional parmesan on top of the mini pizzas just before baking. Next time I will brush the bread cups with olive oil, toast for 5 minutes, then fill.

This was very easy to make and very tasty. It's not fabulous, but they are good to munch on...

These are great kid frindly dinners and will be enjoyed if there are little ones in your home. I have used this recipe in a fix and subbed broiled english (sour dough) muffins as the crust. My kids loved itand so will yours.
