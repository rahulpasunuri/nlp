This recipe produces a light pastry with a really good crunch right out of the oven. I adapted the filling with goat cheese, which turned out really nicely. However, the amount of work just isn't worth the end result. I regularly make croissants from scratch, and those are another labor of love, but one I really really love to eat. These are good but not good enough for the time commitment.

I took a few days last summer to make these, since the bakery in our area that made them went out of business. I love the ricotta filling, and made the orange peel from scratch (very good to snack on all by themselves). The dough was a wonderful challenge, but I made the mistake of trying to put these together in the heat and humidity of summer. I think that it would work better in cooler, dryer conditions. I will definitely make these again, maybe in the fall!

Yep, these are a challenge. A REAL big project but one that is well worth the effort because no one really makes them anymore. Most italian bakeries get them from the same factory in NY because they're cheaper to buy than to make. And those really aren't all those good once you've tasted the real thing. So go for it! Read the recipe at least several times to get the rolling thing down - think of it as one of those collapsible cups - you cut a disc off the roll then slowly separate the layers into a cone shape, like one of those cups. Outstanding.

Pastizzi and sfolgiatelle are just regional variations of the same basic dish. Same basic technique... but pastizzi (from Malta) is a savory dish rather than a sweet one.

Instead of bothering with the notorious sfolgiatelle dough, I simply used a muffin pan & made mini-pies. To be more authentic find a recipe for pasta folla dough (not a type of pasta). You don't need to cover them, in fact you can taste more of the filling if you leave it untopped. Enjoy!

these are TRADITIONAL ITALIAN Dolci not Malta You should look to the ingredients and preparation and know your family food tradition I wont tell you about the peptize Honestly you should learn.

these are actually a Maltese traditional dish called 'pastizzi' either filled with ricotta or a pea mixture!

These were fabulous, but I would never make them again. Because they are so challenging to make, any bakery bothering to make them makes them well, without chemicals or additives. Since I cannot improve on the quality of the bakery version, I'd rather drive 40 minutes to buy sfogliatelle than spend several hours making them. My next batch will come from Mike's Pastry in Boston!

This is a special pastry and a favorite of my husband. Very time consuming but oh so good.To save time I have used Filo pastry, brushed with butter and rolled the stack of sheets tightly and cut into strips which I then formed into the sea shell shape of the sfogliatelle.

Very time consuming. Short-cuts are to layer four strips (6"by 20") with lard butter inbetween each layer. Then using short end roll up as one cylinder. Roll until 8 inches long and approx. 2 inch diameter, then trim ends. Also use rolling pin to form shells rather than hands. Make sure to start in the center and roll out towards edge creating a 5 inch circle. Keep rolling pin side of pastry on the outside to allow flaking.

wonderful, but like making puff pastry, I will probably go to an Italian pastry shop, it's just time consuming, I have made other pastries but none so difficult as these. I think it's juat the time involved but for once in a lifetime, I loved it.
