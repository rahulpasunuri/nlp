Too much work for my chocolate fix. The recipe is also not complete, try another recipe.

I thought the final result was just OK, those guests eating it thought that it was very good but for me, the person who spent time making it, thought it wasn't worth the trouble.

A chocolate lover's dream. However, it appears that the recipe should include that the French Meringue disks need to be baked at 225F for an hour for them to harden.
