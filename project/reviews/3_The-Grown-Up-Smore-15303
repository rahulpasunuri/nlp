Finally...a marshmallow recipe worth trying -- makes about 28-30 perfect little pillows! Simple and wonderful. I've wanted to make 'mallows for years but most recipes are supersized. So impressive to give a guest cocoa with your homemade marshmallow on top. What a fun recipe!

if you live in the states, why would you bother to make marshmellows or graham crackers....likewise, here in argentina, the mousses are wonderful! they make a mousse or flan as easily as we make instant pudding, but they don't have graham crackers or marshmellows. my boys and my scouts thank you for enabling us to share this great north american tradition with our new friends in Argentina by making one of our favorite campfire treats - s'mores!
