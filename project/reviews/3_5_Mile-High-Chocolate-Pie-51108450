We made this for a summer BBQ and it was a HUGE hit with both kids and adults. It looks decadent & tastes delicious - it made the other desserts at the party jealous! We are making it again for Thanksgiving.

Made this for a large family meal. Doubled the recipe so didn't use pie pan. instead made a brownie crust in a large pan. skipped the wafers, otherwise made per recipe. Out of 3 homemade desserts this was by far the favorite. saw many people peering into the fridge for 2 days at all hours to sneak more. even had a 12 yo girl ask me for the recipe.

This pie was fabulous. I followed the recipe (for once), including using all 4 cups of whipping cream. My guests still dream about it. One pie served 14 people - small pieces are just fine with this pie.

I thought this pie was way too sweet and that the ratio of chocolate mousse was off. Everyone at the table was really excited to try it, and the kids loved it, but it's a very sweet pie and probably could use about half the mousse.

This is a delicious pie. Used a crust recipe from Epicurious (Best- Ever Pie Crust) and assembled the pie a day later. The only change might be to add more cookie crumbs to the bottom of the pie, as the mousse filing is about 5 times the thickness of the cookie crumb layer. Will definitely make again, especially since it can be completely made ahead of time.
