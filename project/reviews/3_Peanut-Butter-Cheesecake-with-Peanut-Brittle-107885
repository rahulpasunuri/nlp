Is there no base for this cake?

Do the peanut butter chips (or chocolate if you switched them out) melt in the cheesecake, or are they still solid once it cools? Thanks!

I would definitely recommend using chocolate chips instead of peanut butter. I'm a big fan of peanut butter, but even this was too much for me. I made the brittle, but once I tasted my tester cake, I realized it needed to go in a different direction, so I drizzled chocolate sauce on the top and sprinkled with SALTED crushed peanuts. the chocolate and salt go nicely together and make this dessert a little more elegant and complicated. Made as is, this is just a whole lot of peanut butter and cream cheese.

Made this for the annual New Year's Party... It was a great big hit. I used the chocolate chips and never got around to garnishing it. i will make it again, but will use less chips, display it right side up and top with a small circle of ganache...

Absolutely delicious with the following changes: 1) Use dark chocolate chips in the batter instead of peanut butter chips. 2) Use melted semi-sweet chocolate on top instead of Apricot Jam. 3) Decorate with mini-peanut butter cups, some whole and others chopped, while chocolate is still wet so they will stick. Skip the brittle. My guests were in raptures over the sublime taste. I

Delicious! VERY peanut buttery. I didn't have time to make the peanut brittle - I didn't even have time to chill it for 4 hours! I threw it in the freezer for a little over an hour while we age Thanksgiving dinner and it was perfect by the time for dessert! I'm actually thinking about adding some chocolate chips next time - chocolate and peanut butter make the best combination and it might cut the peanut butter a bit.

I used fat free cream cheese that was short dated and skipped the peanut brittle, topping with ganache instead. One co-worker said it was the best cheesecake she had ever eaten.

This is a winner, does it ever taste like peanut butter! Not too rich. I used maybe 1/4 cup of peanut butter chips and probably 1 1/2 cups butterscotch chips, as that was what I had. Worked very well - I would recommend it because the peanut butter chips might be overwhelming. The cake cracked but really, on the scale of things to worry about in one's life...slightly cracked cheesecakes? The apricot is great on top. Only wrapped pan in one layer of aluminum foil as I was almost out of foil - it worked fine. Skipped the peanut brittle.

I am the "designated birthday cake baker" at the office. A co-worker requested a peanut butter cheesecake recently. Our other coworkers pooh=poohed him----until they tasted this. Even those who said they didn't like peanut butter raved about it. The broken brittle topping againstthe creamy cheesecake makes it extra special.

Made too much peanut brittle, but I had plenty of help eating the leftovers! I made this for the kitchen I run in a brewpub when this issue came out and had forgotten how great it was - I'll definitely make it again, customers loved it. Peanut butter chips weren't available, but caramel worked fine, believe it or not. I skipped the jam and simply decorated individual slices of the cake with shards of brittle. Attractive and delicious!

I didn't add the peanut brittle to the cake, but instead piped out rosettes of peanut butter frosting that you can find on this website. I also added 1/2 a cup more of creamy peanut butter, but the cake still cracked. It was okay, nothing bad, but nothing too impressive.

I changed a couple of things here to make it more low(ish) carb. Used splenda instead of sugar, omitted the topping and chips, and used a flourless peanut butter cookie base. I also used creme fraiche instead of sour cream. It is ok, very rich. Good with afternoon coffee, but I probably won't serve it to anyone (hubby hates peanut butter). The texture was good, though, it only craked a little. I baked it in a pyrex dish, and skipped the water bath.

This was excellent! Rave reviews! It was absolutely delicious. I would definitely make this again.

the apricot jam keeps the peanut brittle on top, and is really rather unobtrusive.

Loved this cheesecake as did my guests. I dropped the apricot jam. Instead, just before serving, I spread a thin layer of chocolate on top, then topped with the peanut brittle. The included peanut brittle recipe is not great. Another would be better or even a good store-bought brand would work. .

Very good tasting cheesecake. Different, interesting. I added a package of mixed chips peanut butter and milk chocolate, and added a crust of a thin brownie cake to set the cake on. The purpose of the apricot jam is to act at the glue for the peanut brittle topping. I did have problems with the recipe for the brittle, see my review for the brittle to get the info.

Very yummy and easy to make. The peanut brittle added something different . . .little crunch to the usually moist smooth cheesecake. The cake itself was super! It baked evenly in the water bath. I also used 1/2 fat free sour cream with 1/2 regular. I would suggest eliminating the apricot jam b/c I wasn't sure of it's purpose . . .it didn't make a difference!

I made this for a friend's birthday cake as she loves peanut butter. It was good.....not great. Very rich. I agree that a combination of peanut butter and chocolate chips would improve the cheesecake.

This recipe received rave reviews from all my guests. Several people begged for the recipe. I added a graham cracker crust and used 1/2 chocolate chips and 1/2 peanut butter chips (rather than all peanut butter chips). It is VERY rich and you have to love peanut butter. Guests said it was like eating a very rich Reese peanut butter cup, only better!
