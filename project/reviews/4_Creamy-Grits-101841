So good and easy! Was a huge hit. I used veggie stock instead of chicken stock and whole milk instead of whipping cream and it was still so creamy and flavorful you wouldn't know you were missing anything. (Personally I think veggie stock always adds more flavor than chicken stock.) Topped the grits with grilled peppers, onions and sausage. YUM!

I took others' recommendations and added about 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese to this. My grits-loving boyfriend took one bite and said, "Wow! This stuff is good!" and promptly ate the whole batch. Good base recipe! I look forward to trying different flavors.

One of our favorite side dishes. I use a whole 14 oz can of chicken broth, and add the remaining amount of liquid using either half and half or milk, whichever's available. I also add about 1/2 tbs of chopped garlic.

Good Grits! I subbed evaporated skim milk for the cream because that's what I had. Added fresh parmesan cheese. I would make this again.

I first had these grits at Cafe 30A in Seagrove, FL years ago so I was thrilled to see the recipe in the RSVP section of BA back in 1999. At the restaurant they serve them with Braised Georgia Quail. These are to die for, excellent "dinner" grits served with a saucy shrimp dish. Full of fat and worth every single gram!

We are grits fans, but this one is delicious! As previous readers suggested, I added two TBL of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. But to lower the fat, yet preserve the consistency, I used nonfat evaporated milk in place of the whipping cream. Even my Yankee husband raved about this dish!

I've served this twice, adding grated Parmesan the second time. Superb both ways, and probably an epitome comfort-food dish. One reviewer remarked that grits don't make good leftovers. Actually, they're excellent fried, pancake style. Or, to reconstitute to the original form, simply add milk or chicken broth very slowly, stirring over a low heat.

We eat a lot of grits in the South, but I've never tasted any like this! Definitely a dish I will make again and again.

A wild hare told me to add about 1/4 cup of shredded parmesean and I'm glad I heeded. VERY tasty! Thanks guys, for teaching a West coast gal how to please her Southern beau! --t

Up until this morning I didn't even know what grits were.it just sounded kind of gross.Then I read the review on this particular dish and tried it and absolutely loved it.I will be making this dish on a regular basis from now on and will be looking for other grits recipes.

Delicious! I added some extra grits in to make them a little denser, but absolutely wonderful! A very nice change of pace from traditional side dishes.

Had these grits at Cafe 30-A, then was hoping to write into Bon Appetit to see if they could get the recipe, and lo and behold, someone had beat me to it! The BEST grits I've ever had, and I make this dish all the time. Also very good using milk instead of the cream, to lower the fat content. Not the best as leftovers, however.

Ahhhh, grits!! Only a southern boy (or lass) can truly appreciate this delightful dish. Very good, but not spectacular, this is the perfect side to veal meatloaf, braised short ribs or any where else you might traditionally have mashed spuds. So quick and easy to make... very similar to the creamy grits served at the Horseradish Grill in Atlanta, but not quite as flavorful. I have made on several occasions now, always to rave reviews.
