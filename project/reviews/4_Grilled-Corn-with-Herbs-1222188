Used sage, flat leaf parsley and basil. A perfect side for anything and any occasion. I scaled down the whole thing since there were 2 of us but I wish I hadn't. You keep eating it even when full! Just don't refrigerate the leftovers--the butter globs up. Careful with the lime juice too--can over-do it. Might be good to add roasted red pepper for color but the flavors as is are spot on. And no need to pre-soak the corn either!

I made this dish at home and enjoyed it so much I decided to try it out while camping. Threw the corn cobs over the big fire-pit grate and roasted them up - very easy. Mixed up the lime butter sauce while they cooked. Didn't have electricity, so no blender, just mashed the garlic and salt together well, let it sit in the melted butter to soften a bit before adding lime juice and herbs at the last minute. Used basil, chives and thyme. Got rave reviews from the others in our group. Easy and delicious!

This was incredible. The key is the lime butter. I doubled the garlic and the resulting flavor was totally compelling. I had a lot of herbs in the potato salad I was serving, so I went easy and just used a little basil and chives. Of the three dishes from epicurious on the plate, this was by far the best (other two were Potato Salad with Pancetta, Rosemary, and Lemon, and Grilled Jerk Pork with Curried Peach Relish).

Made this using chives and basil for the herbs and it was delicious, we couldn't stop eating it. Made it exactly as written. Can't wait to use the lime butter on something else.

This recipe is so easy but really packs the flavor in! This is our second year of making this and is now my husband's absolute favorite way to do fresh corn. It's also a great way to do corn for a crowd without all the hassle of corn on the cob. I used some lime basil as the herb last night and it was the absolute best after plain basil as the herb.

Yuk. I used the exact mixture of fresh herbs reccomended and the taste that resulted was kind of gross.I love fresh herbs and use them all the time in my cooking but this mixture didn't work in my opinion. Not so sure about the lime butter either. For the amount of butter used which was supstantial, I couln't really even taste the butter. The flavor kind of got lost and it wasn't worth eating all that fat if I couln't even taste it in the recipe. No, I won't be making this again.

very easy addition to the menu if you are making the salmon with lime butter, too - delicious and great when heated for lunch the next day, too -

Once you've tried this recipe once, it will find a way into your staple of regular recipes. The corn is simply brilliant cooked this way. The lime with the herbs complement the smoky corn taste. For fun, add some ISOP red pepper flakes - adds a little extra zing.

Okay - so I confess I've always been a bit "Corn Dyslexic" when it comes to figuring out how to fit corn on the cob into a meal - it somehow always gets eaten last and doesn't fit into the meal's rhythm...But THIS recipe was the answer to my dilemma: a chance to serve seasonal fresh corn in a tasty and winsome way. Honestly the BEST corn I've tasted : smokey and crisp and sweet and multi-layers of flavour - it moves the vegetable from being a hole-filler on the menu to being a showcase dish. Easy too!

A great side dish for a summer menu. The flaovor was amazing thanks to the lime butter. I went with mainly basil and parsley for the herbs with just a pinch of dill.

Absolutely delicious. We made this every time we entertained last summer and everyone loved it. A few people said it was the best corn that they had ever eaten.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year. My family was hesitant to try anything new, but they loved this. I plan to make it every year.

This is the perfect corn recipe and a favorite of my family. The lime butter is soooo good with the succulent, grilled corn. Try it with the Grilled Salmon With Lime Butter on the same Gourmet/Epicurious "Fresh From The Farm" menu. The whole menu is great and I will use it again - and again!

the lime butter is amazing. Tip for slicing the kernels off: Don't cut the stem off. I just peeled the husk back against the stem, kind of like peeling a banana, and held the corn at the stem while slicing. I don't have cob holders and I didn't want to burn my fingers, so this was helpful.

This is the best corn recipe ever!!! Also- we have found that you can use the Lime Butter sauce with so many things. I made salmon with it and brushed it over grilled chicken. Divine! I would highly recommend this recipe!

This was a hit at our vegetarian bbq. Very easy to make and tastes wonderful. Next time I'm going to try mixing the lime butter mixture ingredients directly with the corn rather than making it in advance and refrigerating it.

I too made this along with the salmon and green beans. It takes a while to cut the kernels off the cobs, but corn tastes so much better seasoned this way. And it doesn't get stuck in our teeth.

mde this for a dinner party along with the Salmon with Lime butter and green beans and arugula that was part of the menu in the july issue. It was great - everyone had seconds - no leftovers! Really great way to enjoy fresh grilled corn without eating it off the cob

I made this salad last week for my parents, everyone loved it. In fact, my mother just called to get the recipe. I used fresh flat leaf parsley and basil and it was perfect with the lime butter sauce. Plus, the left overs are great in scrambled eggs!
