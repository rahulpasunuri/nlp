You can't even add tons of booze and pass this off as a cocktail - after your guests are already smashed! Too odd and nothing melds right. An absolute loser.

I suspected odd, which it was, but it was also strangely bland - Not what I expected given the ingredients. I'm not a picky eater, and I had to throw out all but the few bites my guests choked down. I won't make it again, but will look for a different avocado soup recipe.

not only odd, but no good. i tried to save it after following the recipe to the letter but to no avail. sadly, soup down the sink. and i am not a hard sell!

Unusual but delightfully so.
