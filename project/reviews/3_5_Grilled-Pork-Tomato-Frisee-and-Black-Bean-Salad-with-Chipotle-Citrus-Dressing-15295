My husband and daughter love this salad! We have been making it since Gourmet first published it nearly ten years ago. Great mix citrus and spicy flavors. Careful on the chipotle chiles-- start with the recommended two teaspoons and then add more if you like more heat. The salad works well for easy light summer entertaining.

This was wonderful. A very nice mix of flavors and textures. We like fresh salads with meat and this was just lovely with grilled pork (actually wild boar) tenderloin. The sauce is very flavorful.

Very mediocre. I love everything in this recipe, but it just didn't do it for me.
