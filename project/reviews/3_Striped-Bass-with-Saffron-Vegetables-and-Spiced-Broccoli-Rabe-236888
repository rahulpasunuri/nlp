The fish turned out nicely, but the spice mixture for the broccoli rabe was so bad that we didn't even eat it. The saffron butter also had way too much fennel flavor causing me to add more tomato paste to even it out so that the vegetables were even edible.

preparing the various elements of this dish was a little labor intensive (we probably should've looked at the recipe beforehand), but the end result and the way the flavors worked together was definitely worth it. also, next time i'd probably make the butter and the rabe in advance. we left out the olives but the paste for the rabe was still delicious. the crispiness of the fish combined with the flavorful broth was perfect.
