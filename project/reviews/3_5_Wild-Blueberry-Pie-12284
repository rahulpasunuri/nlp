That 1/4 teaspoon of salt is enough to draw all the water out the blueberries. Leave it out. It is not necessary for this kind of pie. Tapioca flour is a good idea. Otherwise, do not let it set too long before baking as someone else said. Great recipe as written without the salt.

I am pretty crafty and good in the kitchen, I guess, but no pie expert. This worked quite well. I used frozen wild blueberries, increased the corn starch a little, and also was glad I added more crust (easier to make a top!). I love the tip I got about pie crust making: use plastic wrap or foil underneath your work space. Then when it's all rolled out, just flip it. It's still a little trickier, but so much easier.

This was a simple delicious recipe! The filling was a little watery, but I would make this pie again!!

While I did make a couple changes to this recipe (I added the zest of a lemon and an orange, used frozen wild blueberries since fresh ones are impossible to come by here in Texas, used a little extra tapioca flour to accomodate for the frozen berries, and used my own tried and true pie crust recipe for the pate brisee), I still think this is a really excellent recipe. This was the first time I ever even made blueberry pie, and the filling set beautifully once the pie cooled. The pie got excellent reviews from my friends, and I'll definitely be making it again. I'm not sure what happened to those of you who got runny fillings, but I do know from experience with other fruit pies that if you let the filling or the filled pie sit for any length of time before putting it in the oven, that you will get a soupy, disgusting filling. The hypertonicity of the sugar and thickening agent draws moisture from the cells of the fruit, causing it to begin releasing juice before the pie is ever baked.

Should have read the reviews before proceeding but made it exactly as written with the exception of reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup. The result: picture perfect going into the oven and a major soupy mess when the pie was cut. The crust is paper thin and not to my liking. However, the flavor was good.

This was an incredible pie. My 3.5 year old daughter and I made this together. We all loved it! The crust is well worth the time (not much work anyways). I will use the crust recipe for other pies. I will be making this again for Father's Day this coming Sunday. I used frozen, organic blueberries for we don't have wild blueberries here in St. Petersburg, FL. Once the pie cooled, the sauce thickened. Fabulous!

I never, ever make pies. However, I'd bought 2 pounds of blueberries and needed to make dessert for a dinner party. I checked Epicurious and borrowed a 10" pie pan. I followed the recipe exactly,except for doubling the crust (I had lots of leftover) and making 1 1/2 times the filling. It got rave reviews. My husband thinks it's worth my buying my own pie pan.

I typically stay away from imputting reviews, but the ratings I read by other Epicurians intrigued me, and ultimately inspired me to write in. I did enjoy the recipe; but I also changed it quite a bit based on what others have written. Using the original recipe as a springboard, I doubled the amount of fresh blueberries to get more of a "deep dish" type of pie. I then used the same amount of sugar as stated in the recipe, and it turned out just the right sweetness. As far as starch goes, I used 1/4 cup tapioca flour, which works GREAT, along with two Tbsp. cornstarch. I substituted the same amount of cinnamon for nutmeg, and added the finely grated zest of 1 meyer lemon to the lemon juice. Fabulous results. Kept the butter as it is the edible version of love itself. The crust problem people before me had seemed like too much of a headache, so I used my own tried and true pie dough recipe. The original pie recipe definitely requires some tinkering (I, too, dislike an overly-juicy pie), but if you're up for it, what a great summer treat! Just remember, berry pies such as this one tend to be very juicy (even watery) if not allowed to rest properly. The starches need some time to really set in order to get a nice thick consistency, so it would be wise to allow a couple of hours after baking and before serving, if not until COMPLETELY cool.

This was the second time I made this pie. First time I did use wild blueberries & it got fab reviews from everyone & requests to make for Thanksgiving. Wild blueberries are not available in November so used frozen berries. It tasted just as good but I did make mistakes. I should have thawed the blueberries first and doubled the corn starch. It took forever to cook, about one & a half hours, and it was runny. I'm going to make it a holiday tradition so I'll make some adjustment at Christmas. I'm considering freezing the wild berries next year during berry season. It is well worth the efforts.

Delicious! This was the first pie my 9 year old daughter has ever made and was a huge hit. We used wild Maine blueberries we had hand picked and a pre-made crust. This is a definate "do again".

Fabulous pie! The closest I've come to the wonderful homemade wild blueberry pie you find in Maine. Double the crust recipe - and it's a great recipe. For the pie, I used canned wild Maine blueberries packed in water, drained well. I reduced the sugar in the pie to 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon. I also sprinkled some turbinado sugar on top just before baking. I added about an extra teaspoon and a half of cornstarch based on the other reviews - but it wasn't necessary. The pie was solid, no sliding, oozing or running at all - very thick. I think the moisture problems other folks are having may be related to using regular blueberries instead of wild ones - but that's a guess. Enjoy!

This recipe was pretty good. It was a little too runny & too sweet, but the flavor was nice. I subbed fresh lime juice for lemon, because I didn't have any lemons on hand & that went surprisingly well with the nutmeg. I probably will make the pie again, but I will use less sugar & more cornstarch or tapioca.

The pie was a complete disappointment. To top it off, I used berries that we had picked on our trip to Oregon, and although it smelled delicious, it failed to meet our expectations based on the many great reviews. Even though following the recipe, the filling failed to set completely and was quite runny with it's bland taste not compensating in any manner for the poor texture. All told it's obvious this was not a make again.

a very nice recipe, even with standard store-bought blueberries. I added the zest from the lemons (very finely chopped) to the filling, and used all butter for the pate brisée (rather than the shortening), and got excellent results. A diluted egg wash on the crust before baking gives it a beautiful golden color.

I used prepared pie dough and non-wild blueberries. The flavor was great. I would make it again, but I might increase the cornstarch. The pie was very runny. I would also decrease the sugar as it came out a bit too sweet.

Hi Boston, I think the trick you're looking for is to mix the berries or whatever with flour or cornstarch. The proportions are up to you to find out, but here's a starting point. Good luck!

yummie...this pie was to die for, easy and simple to make. I made the recipe exactly like it read and added alaskan wild blueberries.

I used my own standard crust recipe(and healthy - flour - 2.25 C, salt - 1.5 tsp, canola oil - 1/2C + 1Tblsp, skim milk - 1/3C). I did add the milk/sugar on top as the other recipe calls for. I cut the sugar in the berries down to 3/4 cup, and thought this was outstanding! Very easy!

I made the pie with half blueberries and half peaches and it was wonderful - also reduced the sugar a bit. Will definitely make this again.

Came out WONDERFUL! My new in-laws and husband raved. I used regular blueberries as wild ones were not available, increased (almost doubled)the cornstarch as recommended, doubled the crust recipe, and used an egg wash on the top crust before baking. What a beautiful pie.

Help please. Why is it that sometimes when I bake a blueberry pie with either wild, fresh or frozen berries, the pie has too much juice at the bottom? This can happen when I make apple pie as well. Does anyone know why this occurs? Thank you, A cook in Boston

This was the best pie I have ever made - at least, so said my guests. The crust was delicious and flaky - I topped it with turbinado sugar - but I had the same problem as other cooks, the recipe should have been doubled. Then again, maybe the secret was just the tiny wild blueberries we got on Cape Cod - bought at the farm stand one day, in the pie the next.

The filling for this pie is delicious and I would use it again. However, after making the pate brisee for the crust and not having enough, I did some research which showed that you need to make 2 batches of the pate brisee for this pie. One for each crust. Once I did that, the crust was a breeze to make. The pie was tasty, but I prefer the flaky pie crust from the lattice top pie.

This pie was delicious - and I didn't even use wild berries. After reading the other reviews I used my own pie crust recipe. My guess is that this recipe yields too little dough - my recipe for a double crusted pie uses almost twice these ingredients. But the pie itself was a definite pleaser.

I've used my own shortbread recipe for the dough. It turned out very good. As for the filling, it tasted better after spending some time at the refrigerator.

This pie was excellent. As others have noted, the crust is a bit difficult, but if you have experience with making crust, it is delicious. I made two minor substitutions in the recipe. For the pate brisee, use raspberry tea instead of water. Use raw sugar for the pie. Great old fashioned flavor!

I had difficulty with the crust, also. I found it to be very crumbly and impossible to roll out.

I had a difficult time with the crust on this pie-first it was hard as a rock and then softened in a matter of minutes and stuck to the pastry board. I made this with my own recipe for crust and loved the filling. Would make again with different crust and would love some feedback of others who made this crust with success.

I made this for an American Embassy chef who used to own his own restaurant. He said he usually hates blueberry pie and then proceeded to eat two pieces. Definitely worth the effort, especially if you have fresh blueberries.
