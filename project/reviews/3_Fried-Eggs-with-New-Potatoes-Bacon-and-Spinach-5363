We made ours healthier by leaving out the bacon and it turned out just as good. Also added a shallot when we sauted the potatoes for some extra flavor. My husband loved it topped off with Tabasco.

Pleasant. Don't know about the vinegar.

A good breakfast, but I thought adding vinegar to the potatoes took away their crispiness. The flavor was yummy, but I may skip vinegar next time. Although bacon grease is not the healthiest thing it adds amazing flavor to this whole dish! There could be no substitute.

Excellent & easy. I'd use a tad more vinegar next time...it's quite a nice touch of added flavor.

This is a very easy, tasty supper dish.

I get rid of the bacon greese and substitute olive oil and it turns out even better...especially if you get that nice crispy brown around the fried egg!

The vinegar is a really tasty addition. I'd suggest turning the heat down to medium-low after you remove the spuds so you don't burn the garlic (I also added some chopped shallots).
