What a fun idea for the watercress and those cute little quail eggs that I find at our local tailgate market... Tis a pain to peel the tiny eggs....but I love their color! Tis a very tasty salad as well.

I breed Japanese Quail for eggs for eating and for hatching eggs so I came to view recipes here. I should be able to accomodate those of you that can not find the eggs locally. E-mail me at chicksnducklings@aol.com for information. Delicious!
