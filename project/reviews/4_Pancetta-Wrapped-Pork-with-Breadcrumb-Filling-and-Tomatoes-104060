This recipe was very nice. I used the last of my parsley before the snow!!! I made this on a weeknight and was quite easy. Only alteration I made was I had a whole tomatoe to use up and still tasted great...yes, I will make this again.

This recipe sounded so good, but was so disappointing! It was extremely salty! Don't waste your time on this one.

This was pretty good, but not the best thing ever. The pork was moist and tender. I made something similar to this awhile back with fontina and sage in the filling/stuffing...I liked it better.

My wife and I loved this recipe. I used serrano ham instead and did not have fennel seed so I substituted with herbs de provencale. I also seasesoned the serrano wrapped pork with the herbs de provencale before searing it. The final dish was amazing and I would recomend it to anyone who likes pork. I also served it with galric and thyme greenbeans and creamy polenta.

Loved this! Used prosciutto instead of pancetta and basil instead of parsley. Cooked a bit longer as my pork cutlets were closer to 1/2 inch. Great with pasta and a green salad.

Wonderful. Made this on Saturday for dinner guests, and i was a hit. Left out the fennel as not a fan of it and used thyme instead. Simple and a perfect go-to.

Excellent. The slices I cut were closer to 1/2 inch rather than 1/4 and somehow that size seemed easier to pound out to the desired thickness. I cut down just a bit on the fennel and my husband and I found it "just right" This from two people who don't like licorice. Served it with a special mashed potato recipe I have, and it turned into a real gourmet dinner. It's one I'd definately make for company.

Thishas become a family staple. It is flavorful and can be made with chicken or veal. It is easy and so delicious. My boys love this dish!

My boyfriend and I thought that this recipe was excellent. I'll definitely make it again, and I would even be reasonably comfortable serving it to guests.

Very very tasty! The sauce really added to the pork rolls that were probably great on their own. Since I didn't have pancetta and bread crumbs, I used prosciutto smashed up potato chips. But for the sauce, I had all the ingredients and followed the recipe. It was delicious and my husband asked that I file this epicurious recipe in the "make again" folder!

My husband really loved this recipe. I changed it up a bit though. I cooked the stuffed and wrapped cutlets in the oven instead which left the pancetta nice and crispy and also left out the fennel and used thyme instead, just because I simply hate fennel. I have also served this as an appetizer - the sauce in the bottom and a few of the cutlets placed on top - the flavours of this dish are so substantial on their own I find they work better as an appetizer.

Delish! I cut the tomato/onion reduction with a bit of sour cream and a buerre manie' to thicken it. Even my kids ate it

My husband and family loved this dish and it wasn't too complicated. I did wrap some in canadian bacon, too. I did not have fennel and it tasted great.

Good but not great. I thought the flavors in the sauce clashed somewhat. Perhaps the fennel was overpowering, as suggested by another reviewer.

I loved this dish. The pancetta slices I used were pretty thin, so what I ended up doing to help keep all of the breadcrumb mixture in was to cut and stretch an extra pancetta slice to help bind the cutlet together. I used extra virgin olive oil for the breadcrumbs and regular olive oil for the sauteeing. I wouldn't use as much fennel - there was a little bit too much of a licorice taste by biting into them which took a little away from the tomato/onion/wine sauce. But I will definitely end up making this again.

Loved this dish. I made an orzo with sauteed onions to go with and it was a great combo. My husband said it was even better as leftovers the next day.

We loved this! We are transplanted Americans and we eat alot of pork here. This is a welcome change. We also used bacon and didn't have white wine, so we used red and it came out great.

I used Canadian Bacon instead of the pancetta. This turned out great. The sauce was wonderful. Next time I'm going to make more sauce to serve over pasta.

I had pork loin cutlets in the freezer but no pancetta or fresh parsley. I made a substitution of bacon for the pancetta and about 1Tbls of fresh thyme for the parsley and it tasted great. I can't wait to try this recipe with all the ingredients.

For a change from the recipe sauce - A sauce from the drippings made with red wine, chicken broth, basil and flour-water thickner was excellent. Serve with mashed potatoes or noodles.
