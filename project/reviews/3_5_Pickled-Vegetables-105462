I love these pickles! My favorite is the pattypan squash and the cauliflower. I can't wait to make more :)

The pickles were easy to make, once I had gathered all the vegetables called for. These do need larger (qt size) jars, it calls for such a variety of vegetables that you can't really layer in smaller (pint) jars. I also recommend large mouth. The flavor is great - sweet, spicy, tart - everything I look for in a pickle. These were the first pickles I ever made, and so easy that I'm sure I'll make them every spring.
