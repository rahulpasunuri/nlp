This recipe did not turn out as expected. It is basically a rock candy recipe. So I added some water as I cooked it down so it would not turn hard once I drizzled it over my cake. The taste was fine. But it was not what I was expecting.

Like others I too followed the recipe and my glaze turned into a dark mixture which, once poured on my pound cake and cooled turned into a candy I used to eat when I was a child called "Slow Poke" which was hard carmel on a stick. Totally ruined my cake.

I followed recipe and as I was stirring over low heat, it became darker and darker. It pretty much turned into caramel candy--not good and cutting cake difficult. The top of the cake is now in the trash.

I made this to go over an angel food cake. I just wanted a nice light, lemony sweetness, but this is very very sticky, almost like gum. Maybe I did something wrong, but it seemed like a pretty simple recipe...

Worked fine for me. Went with low heat instead of med. like making jelly. Tastes great, next time i'll add some zest too i think.

Used microwave @ 1 min. intervals then stirred & put back for a total of 3 min. great on pound cake.

Not only was this not was I looking for, it did not "work" per the instructions. Mine was never clear (more like skim milk) and after 10 minutes of stirring turned a more carmelized color. It never made strings like the recipe says it will, and it smelled a little flunky. Plunked this bunch in the disposal, and went for powdered sugar plus lemon juice in the same amount. Uncooked, just stir 'til smooth. THAT was all I was looking for afterall. Don't make it hard on yourself.
