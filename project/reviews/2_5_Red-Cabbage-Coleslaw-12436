This was a fine slaw. Substituted Greek yogurt for the sour cream because, well, because it was in the frig and sour cream wasn't. The dill makes this recipe. Don't leave it out! I'll be making this one again for the fam, for sure.

I thought this was good, but my husband LOVED it and scraped the bottom of the bowl to finish it. Those who didn't like it may have left out salt. A little salt made all the difference.

We like all of the ingredients in this salad, but not together. Bland, and even adding lovely golden raisins didn't help much.

I too received a head of red cabbage on my organic delivery box. Not knowing what to do with it..decided to try the slaw. YUMMY! And I'm no fan of cabbage. Light and Tasty. Perfect for hot weather. I kept adding lemon to taste...probably quadrupled it or more, but then that may have been to combat the white onion I used instead of red. Use red.

I'm not a regular coleslaw eater, but I received some red cabbage in my weekly organic delivery box and decided to try this recipe. Glad I did. It's simple, light and delicious. None of the flavors overpower each other. A great alternative to green salad, and perfect for a hot day.

This is the first time I have ever left a bad review on this site. What a dissapointment...Go and find another coleslaw recipe. I thought the ingredients would of made a different and interesting coleslaw. I am certainly glad I made another kind besides this one.
