Great, simple recipe - I've served this to weekday company twice, both times with rice/quinoa mixed. Used balsamic vinegar the second time, which worked fine, and both times more Tabasco than called for - but otherwise followed the recipe.

This was a great basic blue print to start with. I used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes, and one of the chilli tomatoes, some left over pinot noir, a bag of baby spinach, 3 carrots, and a red bell pepper. It was quite tasty, and there was plenty of liquid.

This is a nice recipe when you dont want to heat up the kitchen. I added green olives with pimentos and capers for variety. substituted white wine for wine vinegar and chipotle taco sauce for tabasco. The sauce was very delicious.

I used seasoned canned diced tomatoes - and also tomato sauce instead of the crushed tomatos. I served this dish with couscous. It was great!

I would defintely make this again, next time i will add okra or green beans to it, and possibly big pieces of onion and red and green peppers when i add the cilantro.

This was very easy to make and quite tasty. It has a rich flavor without much added fat (you can get by with 1T olive oil). I also added Kalamata olives for a litte extra kick.

I added rice to the dish to absorb the tomato sauce a little - that was ok, but seemed a little too strong tomato flavor.

I LOVE this recipe...it's fast, smells up the apartment nicely, is full of flavor and uses ingredients I generally keep in the house anyway. Great taste and spice!

This dish was very easy to prepare. I added ancho chile powder, a tsp of sugar, extra cilantro, wine vineagar and hot sauce. I also added some orzo to the sauce and rotini for some substance.

This was delicious. Try throwing in some orzo during the last 15 minutes of cooking. It's great.

I seasoned the chicken before I sauteed it, and had to add alot more of cumin and added chili pepper and some garlic salt to it to add flavor. I would add and then taste to reach my desired amount. Also, I added some jalepeno and bell pepper to add flavor. The sauce came out great and I served it over spanish rice. The recipe is a good base, then add the things you like to make it even better.

This is a perfect mid-week dish. Easy to prepare, inexpensive ingredients, but delicious. The combination of the cumin and the cilantro really jazz it up.

Very easy and delicious. FYI, I halved the recipe and still used a large pan. Because of the large heated surface area, there was almost no liquid after only 10-15 minutes of cooking. Adding chicken broth helped and didn't harm the taste of the recipe. I took the chicken out after done, and tossed the sauce with some rotini, and served with the chicken on top. Not a pretty meal, but very easy for cooking after work.

This recipe is good and different. I usually make chicken breast, so it was nice to try something new. The sauce is very good. I made orzo to go with it and it was a good accompaniment.

We loved the tomato/cilantro sauce. The dish is not fancy (I couldn't serve it for company), but for a homey dinner its perfect. I made it with mashed atoes, but the dish is Italian, so orzo, polenta or pasta would also make good sides.
