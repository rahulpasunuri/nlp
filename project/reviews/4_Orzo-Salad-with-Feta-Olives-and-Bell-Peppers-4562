Delicious salad - I followed other reviews and added chopped grape tomoatoes, chopped artichokes and chopped zucchini. I also added extra olives (a mixture of kalamata and green)and didn't bother with the pine nuts. You really can't go wrong - the more "stuff" the better!

Fantastic recipe. Only made some slight modifications to our taste. I cut back on the 1/2 cup of olive oil and it was still great. I also left out the cumin and reduced the oregano to 1/2 tsp.

I used 1 teaspoon of oregano instead of 1 1/2. Thought 1 1/2 was too much. Used goat cheese instead of feta because that is what I had. The goat cheese seemed to dissolve into the dressing making it slightly creamy. It added really good flavor. Not sure if I will want to try the feta next time or just use the goat cheese again. Threw in some sundried tomatoes and sliced pepperoncinis. Did not have kalmata olives, so used black olives. Beautiful presentation with all the colors. Everyone really liked it. This recipe is definitely a "keeper" as my husband would say. I will be making it again and again.

This is absolutely delicious, and with the variety of colors and shapes, it has a great presentation. This is now my standard pot-luck dish. It's always a favorite. The first time I made it, I diced the bell pepper. Next time I chopped it into slightly larger chunks, and I liked it better when the pepper pieces were a little bigger.

I don't like bell peppers very much, but I found that substituting tomatoes made this absolutely delicious and didn't compromise the Greek feel to the dish. I have made this for a number of parties, and it makes a very nice alternative to "traditional" (i.e. boring) pasta salads.

I make this salad for BBQs and potlucks all of the time, and it's a great change from the typical mayonaisse faire that is usually offered. For those who aren't olive fans, I've substituted blueberries, but I must say the olives make it a far better dish. It's always been a hit, and I will continue to make it.

This is one of my all-time favorite recipes - I often double it and then make variation all week long: We almost always add diced tomatoes (preferably halved grape tomatoes. Sometimes we add tuna fresh or canned (Italian.) Other times, diced shrimp, chicken or other leftover meat, fish/seafood (for added crunch perhaps some celery. We've even added fresh cooked corn right off the cob! Occasionally we add some Mayo to a separate container of the salad and serve it over greens. This really is a must have recipe. Delicious and so versatile! It's a treasure - a real keeper!

A crisp and refreshing cold salad ideal for summer meals. The capers allow more than enough saltiness to permeate the other flavours. Substituting yellow sweet onions in place of green onions will balance the salty capers. Use good dijon mustard with no added sweeteners. I served with Lox and radishes.

This salad was pretty good and easy to prepare. At first I forgot the toasted pine nuts and it tasted like there was some sort of flavor missing. Once I remembered, the nuts made all the difference!

Delicious. I followed the recipe exactly with one modification. I reduced the garlic to 2 cloves. It's probably even better with the full amount of garlic, but I find I cannot tolerate raw garlic well, so... It's a great recipe for warm weather parties as it holds well and tastes great cold or at room temp.

I made this salad for a camping trip. I prepared it the day before and made the dressing separately and stirred it in right before serving. I used the whole pound of orzo and the entire amount of dressing and thought it was perfect that way. It made plenty for 8 people with a little left over. The only change I made was I used fresh oregano. I will definitely make this again (or try some other variations of it)

This is such a cool refreshing dish for those hot summer days. I only used one red bell pepper. Did not use seasoned feta could not find, so was just as delicious with plain feta. The olives really add to the flavor intensity don't leave them out. Love the little hint of cumin.

The recipe is good, but the wonderful dressing flavor really diminishes if prepared "6 hours ahead of time."

I actually followed the recipe, well almost. I don't care for green onions so I used chives. I didn't have kalamata olives so I used regular ol' black olives and some Spanish olives I had on hand. It seemed like a lot of dressing but that orzo sucked it right up. I think it's even better the next day. If you are going to serve it right away you might want to cut back on the cumin just a bit; it seemed rather strong last night but today it's perfect. Oh, I chopped up the capers so they would blend throughout the salad better. Very easy and very delicious!

I sent my son to the market for orzo. He couldn't find it so he came home with acini de pepe, which is even smaller than orzo. Cooked, it looks like little balls about 1/8 inch in diameter. However, it worked out wonderfully. I diced the veggies and olives very small (about 1/4 inch dice), and it made a festive, confetti-like presentation. The flavors blend beautifully. This is one of the best pasta salads we've had and we'll certainly make it again, using the acini di pepe instead of orzo.

Rating: 3
Great flavor! 3 1/2 Forks. I used plain feta and added about 1/2 c finely chopped sundried tomatoes. I also chopped the Kalamata olives because I enjoy a little olive in every bite. I have an olive/cherry pitter that I use to pit my olives. Very handy tool!

This recipe has become a favorite in my household. I've never had capers on hand when I've been in the process of making it, so I've skipped them every time. It's still wonderful. I never would have thought to put cumin in a pasta salad, but it really is the secret ingredient that brings everything together.

To the reviewer asking about pitting the kalamata olives - I too couldn't find pitted ones. Here's a trick to pit them quickly an easily - smash the olive with the side of a large knife (much like you would garlic cloves to peel them). The pit should pop out easily, and the olive still sort of holds its shape. Yummy recipe. However, I prefer it with a balsamic vinegar dressing.

Rating: 4
I read the other comments that said the recipe made too much, and I didn't listen. THEY WERE RIGHT. The recipe really doubles what you need it for. I used it as a side dish for a buffet dinner for 40-50 people, and silly me, I quadrupled the recipe. I ended up with half of salad left, and sent home with many relatives. When they say it serves 8-10, figure 16-20. Others have posted that this recipe makes a ton, and they were right. I should have just doubled the recipe to get a side dish for 40-50, instead of quadrupled it. Added little olive oil in the beginning, due to other's postings, but added more as time went by because it became dry. Also threw a splash of red wine vinegar on at the end for a kick. The tomato-basil feta was a must. This was a huge hit at the party.

An absolute favorite during the summer. Very refreshing. A few notes, I agree with a touch less oil. When shopping for feta, while herb and garlic flavored feta sounds like a winner, the tomato-herb variety suggested in the recipe really the superior choice. I disagree with a poster below, in terms of cutting the cumin or red wine vinegar: tried both (out of neccessity!) and found both variations wanting. Also, adding meat was a disappointment: even some chilled spiced chicken breast pieces were a poor fit. This one's almost perfect the way it's listed. And making it in large quantities is not only possible, but encouraged around my place!

I have made this salad several times because it is always delicious. I recommend reducing the fat by using just 1 Tblsp with cooked orzo and then 1/4 cup in the dressing. I added fresh parsley and basil. I reduced the cumin to 1/2 tsp. I substituted red wine vinegar for the white wine vinegar. To bump up the fiber content add 1/2 cup of wheat bulgur that has been steeped for 5 minutes in boiling water then drained well. Add 1/4 cup chopped sun dried tomatoes, rinsed in boiling water if using plain feta cheese. French feta is my favorite.

Rating: 4
This was excellent! To cut back on the fat I only put in about 1/4 c feta and about half of the olive oil. Also felt a little unsure of the cumin in this so I just put a pinch. Served with some grilled chicken that had been marinated in a mix of pesto + vinaigrette dressing. Absolutely delish!!

A really yummy salad, perfect as a take-along accompaniment at a BBQ. Several people praised it and I'll definitely make it again, because we keep most of the ingredients on hand. I couldn't find seasoned feta, so I used plain goat's milk feta mixed with some chopped semi-dried tomatoes. I cut down the oil in the dressing by about half--it just looked like way too much.

This was a terrific combination of flavors and colors. We preapared it as part of a Mother's Day feast, accompanying grilled butterflied leg of lamb. The Mediterranean influence was the perfect match. And I made it the day before. My husband agrees that it's a keeper

Wonderful. Just took this to a party. It was the hit. I did add extra dressing as well as a combination of Greek olives. Definitely a keeper!

I liked this a lot! I didn't have bell peppers (dont like them anyway) or capers on hand. The dressing is very nice. I used about half the oil it called for and anything more would have been too oily for my taste. Next time I will throw in cucumber and maybe cherry toms. Good flavor though.

Very colorful and tasty. I cut the recipe in half and made all the dressing and used about 2/3. I also added more cheese per another review.

Really liked this. The second day we tossed in some leftover greek chicken and Yum! it was good all over again. I didn't use the full amount of oil, just enough to moisten. I added some sundried tomatoes, which I probably won't do again. I also skipped the capers - family preference.

Very good. The perfect hiking/picnic dish. I added a lot more toasted pine nuts and it made it even better.

"I have made it a half dozen times and it's fantastic everytime." Huh? Any reason it wouldn't be?

I can't get enough of this salad. I have made it a half dozen times and it is fantastic every time. The capers make the dish. It is always a crowd pleaser.

This recipe is a "keeper". Secret, I think, is in the dressing. Cumin is a must. Used Greek Olive Oil instead of Italian. Better flavor. Used l/2 Kalamata & 1/2 black olives and Sunflower seeds instead of Pinenuts. This would be good with just about any pasta.

Fabulous dish. The cumin certainly adds an unexpected kick. Been emailing this recipe to various friends whole summer-- it has been a hit everytime! It tastes even better chilled. Delish!!

One of those recipes that everyone loved. It was emailed to 3 people per their request within a week!

I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed it pretty much except like other reviewers reduced the olive oil. I also added a little extra lemon juice since we like things on the tarter side. Teh second time, I added balsamic vinegar, fresh tomatoes, red onion, some fresh basil, a little sugar and celery. In both cases, everyone really liked the salad. It is a good salad to bring since it packs well, and you can make it ahead of time.

This salad was good but next time I will add more feta. I used slivered toasted almonds instead of the pine nuts, and that worked out well. I used the amount of olive oil called for but next time will cut back.

I made this for a neighborhood picnic and everyone loved it. I doubled the recipe because we were short on salads-wow-what alot of salad!!! Next time I will only make one recipe-but we enjoyed eating it for days and days after the picnic!

I used roasted red and yellow peppers. Very pleased with this recipe!

I was a bit disappointed after all the good ratings. Something was missing, may-be it was the cumin that I did not have at home.

Rating: 3
This was a good recipe when made with the suggestions from other reviews. I cut down the oil alot and letting it sit overnight is a must! Flavors don't have time to meld as well if eaten a few hours after being made. I had to add some red wine vinegar and dijon mustard to give it more flavor along with some roasted red peppers just because I had some on hand. Otherwise a great recipe that I will definitely make again.

I have made this many times and quite enjoy the flavors. Recommended.

One of the best pasta salads - ever. I followed this recipe pretty closely. Did not use the extra 1/2 cup of olive oil and did not feel I needed it. I also did not use the pignoli nuts (pine nuts) That probably would have been a nice touch but I didn't have any. The salad is so tasty...and better if made a little ahead of time.

Made this pasta salad as a side dish for our SuperBowl party yesterday. Was really a hit because several of the women there asked me for the recipe and raved about it. Would definitely make it again. A nice change using orzo instead of the more commonly-seen shapes used in pasta salads.

A bit heavy on the peppers. Fabulous Inn though. We stayed there on our honeymoon.

I thought that this recipe was excellent. I have made it several times and everyone raves about it. I added fresh parsley and diced red onion, and increased the amounts of garlic, feta cheese (regular as well as seasoned is good), capers and olives. (I did not use pine nuts.)

No more boring "pasta salads" at my cookouts. This is the best pasta salad I have ever made. Although it makes to much--I now half the recipe. And I have also cut back on the oil or I just don't use all of the dressing. You can also add things to it like sun-dried tomatoes or cherry tomatoes. Also, at Christmas time, I use red and green peppers--it makes a colorful salad in a clear glass bowl.

We were disappointed in this recipe. It makes a ton, so we ending up discarding about half.

Becky from Phoenix should have followed the recipe. It needs no changes. It makes alot, so I'm always looking for a party for an excuse to make it so I can have some for myself.The bowl always comes home empty.

easy and very good! I took the suggestion to add fresh cilantro and roasted jalapenos, which gave the salad some needed zip. I also made it with grilled shrimp, and served over salad greens for a great summer dinner!

This is one of my favorite recipes from the site. I have cut back on the oil a few times, but other than that, I pretty much follow the recipe.

Took this to monthly cooking club today. Despite all great reviews I was disappointed with this recipe. I added chopped jalapeno chile and extra greek seasoning spice but, still felt it was a little bland. I only let it sit 6 hrs. in fridge so maybe flavors would be stronger if sat overnight in fridge. It is a pretty dish in clear glass bowl but, don't think I'll make again.

This was a hit with our group. It looks as good as it tastes and keeps very well. I omitted the cumin.

This was a great summer salad, light with plenty of flavor. It is perfect for picnics, and is just as good the 2nd and 3rd day after you make it.

This is a great summer barbecue side dish. It is fresh tasting and easy to prepare ahead of time.

This dish is sooooooooo good. The flavors are great together, the presentation nice and the "licked the bowl clean, happy faces" around the table are fun!!!! Perfect for a potluck or BBQ...gotta have those pine nuts though. Yum!

A great side dish. Friend who doesn't like feta had two helpings! Best if served at room temperature. Pines nuts aren't necessary but I will add if I have on hand.

This was really excellent. I don't really care for raw vegetables too much so I used chopped roasted red peppers. I think it's better this way. I also omitted the green onions only because I didn't have any on hand, but it was still delicious. Next time I will try with the onions. I love pine nuts and think they are imperative to add contrasting texture to the recipe (especially since I didn't use the raw red peppers & green onions). I also used half the amount of olive oil to toss with the pasta to cut down on fat and found I didn't miss it. I just had to add a little bit to moisten when having the salad the next day. I'm a big fan of couscous salads so I think I will also try tossing these ingredients and dressing with some couscous in the future.

Great side dish! Added the sundried tomatoes as suggested...worked well with other ingredients. I've made this three times and it's always a crowd-pleaser. Pine nuts add a certain "crunch" but aren't imperative if not on hand.

Rating: 3
Very tasty. Has gone very well with burgers and grilled chicken. Someone always asks for the recipe. I've substituted red wine vinegar. Unline some other reviewers, I wouldn't make this without the pinenuts. Flavors meld overnight.

Have made this time and time again. It's an excellent side dish, especially for cookouts or picnics. I agree that the pine nuts can be omitted but I'll use them if I have some on hand.

Yummy...the only thing I would omit is the pine nuts for garnish. This dish doesn't need any more embellishment. A friend who is sensitive to raw onions gobbled this up. Everyone at the table had seconds. This is a very cheery-looking dish...serving it in the winter is a good idea! I'll definately serve this again often.

I recently made this for a pot luck for a dog show and everyone raved about it and wanted the recipe. Served at room temperature really brings out the flavors,can't go wrong with feta cheese and olives. It's a keeper.

This is a very easy salad to make. The second time I made it, I didn't have the recipe, and I just combined the ingredients -- it still came out marvelously. Great for barbeques or a side dish for buffets. I tried multi-colored orzo one time -- very attractive

A nice salad to serve with grilled seafood or chicken. I added a pinch of cinnamon and some fresh chopped mint.

I made this for a picnic potluck, and it was a hit every one else who made a salad had more than half left but of this the bowl had been scraped empty. It was fabulous. I add 2 tablespoons of chopped sundried tomatoes and 1 tbsp of pesto, and just plain feta cheese instead of the seasoned. We have already made it again.

I've made this several times and it's alqays a hit. Serve it with the Grilled Lemon Oregano chicken and you're good to go for an easy summer dinner--especially good at the beach as the salad can be made ahead and the chicken can be grilled at the last minute. Serve with warmed pita.

perfect as part of a winter "buffet". A nice change from other pasta

We made this for a superbowl dinner and decided that it was definitely going to be one of our regular salads throughout the summertime. I made it with organic tricolored orzo. You'll be going back for seconds!

This is a fabulous dish as is, but I added a little minced red jalapeno to taste as well as cilantro.
