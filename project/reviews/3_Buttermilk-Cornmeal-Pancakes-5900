I thought these were lovely. I did a half recipe and wasn't careful about the measuring. I also cooked them in a cast iron skillet which might have helped. Next time I'm going to fry sage leaves in butter and put them in the pancakes for something savory. Also--WTF with the person from Seattle mocking the person from LA? Maybe the LA person is just a better cook? Hah.

This was easy and delicious! I had to tweak it because I didn't have enough corn meal on hand...my version contained 2 to 1 ratio of flour to cornmeal. Also, used my "homemade" Ginger sugar and added blueberries.

12 degrees outside and I'm in the mood for pancakes. No easy task since I'm allergic to egg yolks and wheat. Stumbled upon this recipe and thought... why not? Substituted 1 cup egg whites for the 6 large eggs. Substituted brown rice flour for the all purpose flour (equal amount) and had a delicious breakfast. My pancakes were light and tasty and I have plenty to freeze! Perfect for someone with wheat or gluten issues who is craving such comfort food!

I'm writing this as they are sizzling on the stove. Think "drop scones." The batter thickens up right quick; it's really very similar to cornbread batter, and as other reviewers have cautioned, needs NOT to be overmixed. I used a serving spoon to drop them into the skillet. They are rather bland when naked; slather them with butter and syrup and all will be well. A charming thing to make for a leisurely weekend brunch. Also very filling; I'll have plenty left over for weekday breakfasts.

These were great for a quick Saturday breakfast. I'm Colombian, so I used brown sugar instead and increased it to 1/2 cup. As they were done, I sandwiched them with lots of Muenster Cheese which melted nicely. I served them with some Blueberry Maple Syrup for dipping and Colombian Hot Chocolate (Cacao).

I am surprised at the bad reviews. I have been making this recipe for years, and everyone I make it for loves it. Don't over mix the batter or you will get tough pancakes.

To Cook from Los Angeles - honey, your guests must be flattering you or they're affraid of your temper. These are just terrible.

I've been making these for years now - for pancake and non-pancake lovers, and I've never gotten a bad review. In fact, I've often been asked for the recipe, and I've always been asked for more. To make them more scruptious, serve with blueberry syrup.

Dry, flat, pancakes. The "Cornmeal buttermilk pancakes" on this site are much better--in fact, scrumptious! Try those instead....

disappointing from the point of view that i expected the pancakes to be fluffier. they are just okay, not spectacular. nicer pancakes can be made with less effort from scratch. pity.

I loved them. Nice change form ordinary pancakes. Delicious with breakfast sausage.

My husband loves pancakes...I do not. Alternate Sundays he makes pancakes or waffles, and this last Sunday was the first time I've enjoyed hav- ing pancakes for a long time. They are superb! The flavor reminds me of the old time malt-flavored pancake. So flavorful no butter is needed...just maple syrup.
