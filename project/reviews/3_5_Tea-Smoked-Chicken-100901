I am still reeling over this one! I increased the tea and used raw sugar and dark brown sugar. My house smoked something awful (even with the exhaust). This was the most awesome dish I have ever made. It took a lot of effort but it was worth it. I served it with a mushroom risotto and steamed cabbage.

Superb dish, especially as an appetizer. This recipe is virtually identical to one that we have been making for the past 20 years, as a result of trying to duplicate a dish we ate in Chicago called Camphor-Smoked Duck. Our recipe comes from Madame Wong's Long Life Chinese Cookbook and differs as follows: After rubbing the chicken with salt & szechuan pepper, we let the chicken rest overnight. The next day, we put several slices of ginger & several scallions in the cavity before steaming. We try to keep to a 3-lb (or slightly less) chicken. Steaming takes 30-45 minutes; regardless, steam until the juices of the chicken run clear, but definitely avoid overcooking the chicken. We then line a cast iron dutch oven with foil (plus the lid), place the smoking material in bottom (2 tbsp each brown sugar, raw rice, lapsong souchong or other black tea - www.tenren.com), then place the cooled chicken on a metal folding steamer basket. Cover tightly and start timing the smoking when smoke starts to appear. Continue smoking for 15 minutes (no need to turn chicken). Do not remove cover and remove from heat, letting rest for an additional 30 minutes. Remove ginger/scallions from cavity, brush with sesame oil, and let cool. To serve, chop into 1-inch pieces. Serve as an appetizer alongside some szechuan-peppercorn flavored salt. Try serving with a cucumber-carrot salad with hot-sour dressing or dry-fried green beans for a meal.

I really like the unusual smokiness of the tea and brown sugar mixture and my husband often asks me to make this. I serve it with coconut rice and steamed asparagus for a simple meal that always looks great and impresses guests.

Ever since I saw this recipe on H&G channel last May, I've tried it twice and noticed that it takes much longer to cook than stated. It took more than 25 mins to steam through and more than 1/2 hour to get that nice brown colour as seen on the show. I am yet to try it again with more tea than the recipe called for to get the colour and taste. I love it because of its flavour and texture. I also tried it with rosemary and basil. Delicious!

Chicken very moist with good flavour, but very little of the smokey lapsong tea flavour. I would add more tea next time.

I added Lemon Zest to the peppercorn and tea mix. I also added a whole scored lemon to the cavity, the change was subtle but fantastic I recieved great reviews.

Delicious and delicate, pleasing to palates accustomed to Asian cuisine, but not so overwhelming as to intimidate less adventurous eaters. I added an orange to the chicken cavity and to the steam water. I'll make this again and again, and maybe even try it with jasmine tea instead of the lapsang souchong.

putsy, but very good.
