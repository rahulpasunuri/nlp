Awesome recipe! Even better than a BLT. Don't skip the croutons...they are maybe the best part! The dressing is pretty thin, which allows for a light coating. I used romaine lettuce instead of Boston.

Be careful -- this salad is addictive. Fantastic. I made it for friends one Sunday afternoon just as written. They went nuts and made it for friends, who made it for other friends, etc. It's not exactly spa cuisine so I've resolved to cool it for a while, but I'm looking forward to a special occasion to make it (and eat it) again.

The bacon croutons are soooo good! I did use a mayo dressing with reserved bacon drippings & red vinegar & fresh basil. A BLT salad is just that. Make LOTS of the bacon croutons. They were almost gone by seving time.

Great summer salad. I used all fresh veggies from the farmers market and smoke house bacon. The lemony dressing went well with the rich bacony croutons.

Everyone gobbled this up as a side salad. I didn't end up using all the crumbled bacon. It seemed too much. The dressing was just right. Be sure to drain off some of the bacon fat as directed. I used it all per another review's suggestion and the croutons were practically inedible. I also soaked the sliced red onion in a bit of cold water with a teaspoon of vinegar (helps retain the red color) to cut the sharpness of the onions.

This was good but I would add 2 more slices of bacon, twice as much bread, and probably use a cut up tomato in order to get more juice and more of a BLT flavor.

Thought it was quite good. I added arugula and avacado. It is also the easiest possible dressing.

Remove the bread. Double bacon (cook on cookie sheet in oven or microwave)as well as tomatoes, salt and garlic. Use grated black pepper generously to taste. Use medium red onion and top with shredded chedder cheese.

Terrific flavors. What can go wrong with bacon AND bread in a salad? The simple dressing is both biting and comforting, downright addictive.

I always add my own twists to recipes. With this one I added a bit of julienned deli ham and turkey and microwaved the bacon and the bread because it was too hot to use the stove. It was great. The dressing was pefect.

I thought this was good, and everyone seemed to like it. The concept is very cute, and I think it charmed people more than anything else. The dressing was OK; I don't think I used enough salt, so I ended up salting the salad (even with all that bacon).

This salad is simple yet very, very delicious. I served this to company and it everyone devoured it. I was surprised by how good it was. Sure, it's not very 'gourmet' but it sure does taste yummy.

This salad is great, but I must add that I use the Creamy Basil Dressing from this site in place of the dressing suggested. I highly recommend it! You won't be disappointed!!!

The salad was good, but I didn't care for the dressing that much. It tasted like, well, mayonnaise with lemon juice and garlic. I know it's supposed to taste like a BLT and all, but it was a little too mayonnaise-y for me.

I have made this one over and over again for guests and it is always a favorite. It has become a regular request. The croutons are simply delicious. I use sweet grape tomatoes instead. What a great salad!!

This dish went over well with guests. I did use slightly more bacon than the recipe called for and also used a medium onion rather than a small one...both changes I would continue to make if I were to prepare this dish again. I did find that it doesn't hold up well; so I will definitely make it right before serving.

A really awesome salad. My only complaint would be that the dressing tasted a lot like caesar salad dressing (at least the recipe I've used from this site). When I make it again, I'll tamper with the garlic/lemon level to adjust that. Otherwise, it's a great salad. The croutons are absolutely out of this world -- you MUST take the time to make them.

I've made this salad twice now and it was a hit both times. This is the first recipe that my sister has asked ME for! YUM YUM YUM!!

Wonderful! Of all the gourmet dishes that I have made from this website - THIS is the one that my husband rated 4 forks and wants again! This really is good and very simple. My advice - don't just use 1 T bacon drippings, use them all. I tried it both ways and they have a tendency to burn with just a T of oil in the pan.

I've made this many times and we love it even for leftovers. I sometimes substitute red wine vinegar for the lemon juice. Also the croutons are even better if you saute the minced garlic in the bacon drippings before adding the bread.

My partner and I enjoyed this salad very much, although I went a little overboard on the red onion. The croutons were fabulous! If you make this salad, don't skip the croutons. I also used Dole's Mediterranean salad blend to save some time, and it was great.

This is a salad even my kids would eat! I turfed the boston lettuce and used spinach and arugula instead (healthier) and I added slivered almonds. I even cheated and used storebought croutons, but it MUST be made with real bacon.

Good summer weeknight dinner with most ingredients already in the house. I added some avocado, fresh basil, and sliced black oilves. Quite easy and very tasty.

This is nice but certainly nothing special.

This was suprisingly good. Don't try to go low fat--you MUST saute the bread cubes in the bacon grease. That's the best part. Yum!

There's nothing _remarkably_ special about this salad, it's rather boring, actually.

Absolutely great and the hit of the party! This is one that I've added to my "favorite recipe" file.

You will enjoy this salad if you have any love for ranch dressing. Preparation is a snap. If you would like to have your BLT with cheese add a good bleu to the mix.

My whole family loved this one!

Very good! One variation would be to make this into a turkey club salad; adding Durkee's dressing to the mayo mixture and strips of turkey.

This is an excellent quick fix; especially easy to make on the day before marketing day. Tastes great. Even quicker with microwaved bacon.

We add grilled chicken breast on our BLT salad and eat it as a meal. The dressing is easy to make and tastes great
