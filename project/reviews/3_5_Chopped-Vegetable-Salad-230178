The dressing is wonderfully light and fresh tasting. There is a lot of prep time in this dish, but the leftovers stay good for days (although the beans will discolor).

A wonderful summer salad -- light and refreshing! My husband and I ate it as a whole meal and it was quite filling. I used baby romaine, added cucumber and substituted steamed asparagus for the green beans -- simply because we'd eaten green beans the previous 2 nights. Didn't have oranges, so I just used extra lemon and lime juice.

I have made this twice now and I love it... goes wonderfully with grilled salmon or chicken. Watercress can be hard to find so I substitute any spring greens or lettuce mix.

This dish is superb. It was a big hit with my husband, my teenagers and me! It's a great way to get veggies into your family - everyone wished we had more!

This is definitely a keeper - very delicious! We couldn't find watercress and substituted Raddichio, and it worked beautifully.

I have been making this dish for years, ever since it first appeared in the magazine. It's a wonderful summer salad, and the dressing made with fresh juices is wonderful.
