We've been making this recipe since it's 1994 debut. Each year, we seem to have more guests at the table as word has spread! Not only the most amazing looking bird out of the oven, but the juciest, tastiest turkey recipe. Paired with sausage and cornbread stuffing, it's our family classic. No modifications needed!

I made this recipe last night, and modified it so that it was kosher for Passover. I substituted pareve margarine for butter, and, because my family isn't interested in gravy, I ignored that part of the recipe. I stuffed the turkey with the vegetable matzoh stuffing from this site (beware of the obvious typo in the recipe; see comment where it's explained). The turkey weighed twenty pounds, and I roasted it for six hours according to the recipe. The turkey was so tender that it fell apart while being carved.I've never seen that before! The guests all raved, and this recipe is definitely a keeper.

Absolutely heavenly turkey recipe! The apricot glaze is divine, without being overpowering. Herb butter adds the perfect punch of flavor, and the onion gravy is AMAZING. Brine the bird the night before and this puppy is a guaranteed hit! Taste gets an A, texture an A, ease of preparation a C-, expensiveness gets a B-, presentation an A, so overall, this baby is a B+ recipe!

i've been following this recipe for about 15 years now. i've made it in the oven, on the grill, and in a roaster (although i give it a final browning in the oven). i've probably served it to 100 different people in that time. everyone just raves. the only thing i don't bother with is the gravy. it's ok, but i'm just not an onion fan, so i just make traditional gravy with drippings, milk and flour. search for the Cranberry and Dried-Cherry Sauce, which compliments this perfectly.

Okay, I'm a person who never reviews anything, but I just have to put my .02 here. This is the BEST turkey I've ever had. I was introduced to it by some foodie- friends of mine who made it for Canadian Thanksgiving way back in 1995-1996 or so. I don't like turkey but didn't want to be rude and so had some. I was sold! I've been making it every Thanksgiving since. It has ALWAYS turned out beautiful (I'm no gourmet, but this turkey makes me look like one!) and delicious. Last year our oven was broken for Thanksgiving, and we had to improvise (had guests coming!) and BBQ our turkey on the grill. I followed this recipe, and it turned out even MORE fantastic than in the oven. I just can't say enough good things about this turkey recipe and would love to thank the cooks who came up with it. Every Thanksgiving I bamboozle my holiday guests into thinking I'm some kind of gourmet cook because of this turkey. THANK YOU!

This was the best turkey I have ever made. It was a nice change from the turkey I usually do for Thanksgiving. I made this one for Christmas. I brined the turkey first, but otherwise followed the recipe. Had to cook it longer than the recipe indicated, but the flavor was wonderful, meat juicy, skin was to die for. Family LOVED it! Will make it again and again.

I've also been making this recipe twice a year or so since 1994. It seems like a lot of work at first, but if you follow the prep directions and do the work ahead, it's easy and worth the effort. My 80 year old mother asked me for this recipe today.

Every year I pull out my tattered, spattered November '94 issue of Bon Appetit and make this turkey. The best part, as noted in many previous reviews, is the unbelievable gravy. If you're lucky enough to have any left over, it'll thicken up in the fridge. Then you've got a delicious spread for Friday's turkey sandwiches.

I usually try a new turkey recipe every year. This year I feel the need to use tried and true recipes. Both the turkey and the gravy are awesome. My only suggestion is the cooking time is too long for a fresh turkey. But the glaze and the gravy are fabulous. Your guests may not say "this tastes like apricots", but they will say it is delicious. And they will love the gravy as well - it is fabulous too.

Rating: 4
I've made this recipe many times since it first appeared in 1994. I have not deviated from the written recipe except I brine the turkey first. Everyone asks if it's some type of "special" turkey and rave about the flavor. This is by far the best turkey recipe you can try.

Rating: 3
The herb butter is a must - the turkey turned out so moist! My boyfriend actually said it was the best turkey he'd ever eaten. The apricot glaze was a bit disappointing though...it was pretty gooey & the flavour didn't really stand out. There is a maple ginger glaze in this site that is much better. Next time I'll make the herb butter, but use the maple glaze instead...

I have made this three years in a row. If you want a moist, flavorful turkey, then use this recipe. You don't need any gimmicks like oven bags or deep fryers, etc., all you need is follow this recipe and you will end up with the best turkey you will ever eat. Just make sure to have foil to allow the turkey to cook without burning. The gravy is to die for, you don't need to thicken it, just drain it from the roasting pan and puree. Enjoy!

To avoid any type of "onion-ny" taste, it's really important to cook those onions to a nice deep brown color (which brings out an incredible sweet flavor). Also, use all the glaze. The glaze that drips down from the turkey to the bottom of the pan really adds to the gravy. One reviewer mentioned that the glaze "burned". Three things: don't cheat by adding the glaze too early, tent with foil if its getting too dark, and buy an oven therometer to ensure your oven temps are correct. I double the glaze and onions, our guests go crazy over the gravy. This is the easiest and best turkey you'll ever make!!!

Rating: 3
This made a tasty gravy after a bit of tweaking. At first it was too oniony. After adding some extra chicken broth and some of the apricot glaze, it developed a great flavor and went well with the Dried Fruit Stuffing from this site. The glaze didn't really do anything tastewise for the skin, but browns it nicely if added near the end of the roasting time.

Rating: 3
This made a good turkey, but the Tea & Lemon Brined Grilled turkey was better. I wish I'd brined this one, but I was afraid it would be too salty. The gravy was a big hit, though, and I'll definitely make that again.

105 reviews to date and 94% percent would make it again, and again, and again... I thought this had to be something special. That was 3 years ago and in our home this has became a holiday staple. It is undeniably the best turkey I have ever eaten, truly amazing! I don't brine the bird, but just cook it. Also, forget about straining the gravy mix. As suggested by another reviewer, just skim the fat and then mix the gravy with a boat motor (braun hand held mixer) from the drippings right in the pan. I also cook it in a bag until the turkey breast gets to 165 and then take the bag off, put the glaze on and brown it that way to keep from drying anything out or burning the glaze on as another reviewer had trouble with.

To be completely honest, this was a little disappointing. After reading all the hype on this recipe I was very eager to try it out for Christmas dinner. Followed the directions to a T, but started with a brined turkey (as I do every year). The glaze ended up burning the skin to a rich black and it really didn't impart any type of apricot flavor to the turkey (I guess because it tasted burnt). I thought the glaze was a waste. I suggest if you do make this recipe that you cut the glaze ingedients in half as I still have most of it left over in the fridge. The gravy was okay, smelled great but a little too oniony for my liking, and I LOVE caramelized onions. Personally, I like the Honey Brined Turkey with Giblet Cream Gravy or the Roast Turkey with Porcini Mushroom Gravy (although if you use a brined turkey, the gravy gets a bit too salty so start with your own salt free stock). That's my two cents. Hope it helps.

I have been making this since it appeared in the 1994 issue. A family tradition for us, my family would have it no other way. The gravy is unbelievably good. Like some other reviewers, I pair it with the sausage, apple and dried cranberry stuffing from the same issue. I agree that it's best to tent the turkey early to avoid overbrowning of the skin. You will not be disappointed.

I have never written a review for Epicurious,,,,,,,,, however I cannot resist writing one for this recipe. Tomorrow I will be cookin this dish for the 7th time. When I have veered from this preparation, our guests grumble upon hearing the news. There are never never never any leftovers! If you want leftovers,,,,,,,,, make something else! Only quible with the directions is that if you cook this bird to 180 degrees, toss it out! 162 degrees and cover it when you pull it out. The temp will continue to climb as you finish prepping the rest of your meal. Magnifique!

Rating: 4
This has been our family's favorite since 1994. My children wouldn't consider Thanksgiving without the onion-shallot gravy. I use more onions/shallots and other ingredients and therefore have lots of leftovers. Gravy reheats beautifully. I only skim out the onion/shallot mixture from the pan into the cuisinart---maybe add a little pan juices if needed. I don't reheat the gravy or do anything else past this step---we think it's fine the way it is. Truly a family tradition!

I HAVE to add my review to the chorus: this turkey is the best-tasting ever. This is the third year that I will make it. It is not to be missed.

some more comments: - It takes me about 45 minutes to get the onions to a real nice caramelized state (not the 20 minutes). Get them nice and brown (deep brown) -- the extra 20 minutes of stirring is worth it! (I even increase the amount of onions) - It usually takes me longer the 15 minutes to reduce the apricot glaze (again be patient) what a great recipe

adapted this as best i could for a 5 lb chicken and husband said he'd be glad to be served this at a restaurant! sweet & moist. (didn't have apricot stuff for glaze--use current jelly instead.) but i have a question: why cook it add'l 40 minutes when thigh is 180F? isn't it done? (i did not cook chicken past 180F) also, regarding the gravy comments: call it "jam" or something other than "gravy" and you'll know more what you'll get. altho delicious, my gravy wasn't pretty-- looked like chunky applesauce. still looked "gritty" after adding broth. i might fully carmelize onions next time (i love sally schneider's onion marmalade recipe). otherwise, will definately make this again--as written!

Without question, the best turkey recipe we've ever made. We dreaded cooking Thanksgiving dinner until finding this a few years back, and wouldn't dream of roasting a bird any other way. everyone who's tasted this at our house is absolutely amazed at how well the apricot glaze and the turkey go together.

This is the best Turkey recipe I have ever tried!!.Make the glaze, herb butter and onion mixture the day before.And to make the gravy I just use a hand blender in the roasting pan, with out straining it and then thicken it with a little cornstarch.Delicious. I've been making it for three years.

This was my first time making a turkey and I scoured epicurious for the most highly rated recipe. This was by far the most loved. I made it and was thoroughly impressed. The gravy was spectacular and the turkey developed a beautiful amber glaze. I couldn't believe I actually made it. My only advice is to try to make the herb butter, onion mixture, and glaze the night before. It was a bit overwhelming trying to make all those along with the stuffing, potatoes, squash, etc. I will definitely make this one again!

I've been making this recipe since 2000 with the roasted onion and shallot gravy and it's been a hit each year.

My family would not trade the turkey and gravy for anything! The turkey comes out moist and flavorful.

This is by far my favorite turkey recipe. My mother-in-law had me make it with her back in 1994. I have made it just about every year since! It is easier to make the herb butter and onion mixture a day or two sooner, but even that is not a big deal. Thank you to who ever came up with this one!

Absolutely wonderful! And I didn't think that it was very time consuming to make (maybe that's because Thanksgiving dinner takes me all day, anyway).

This recipe is ALL it's cracked up to be. It's easier than it looks (the gravy is fool-proof). I would suggest preparing the herb butter, onions and glaze a few days ahead of time, just to cut down on kitchen time. BTW, the November 1994 issue is jammed with classic recipes. By far it's the best Thanksgiving issue in my collection (subscriber since 1990).

I've been making this since 1999 and it hasn't failed me yet! I tried a recipe with prosciutto one year, but it wasn't as moist and was way to salty, so I am sticking with this recipe. To the cook from Boston, I brined it last year in an orange brine and it turned out even better -- definitely not too salty. I'm going to brine it again this year. This recipe was also great for a friend who is allergic to gluten and has been doing without gravy for the past few years. She was thrilled to be able to have gravy again!

I volunteered to cook the turkey for our shift pot luck. I did not realize they were going to buy a 25lb turkey. I used this recipie and was pleasantly pleased. All my co-workers were equally impressed. They all had the same theme...that this was the most moist turkey they had ever had including thier own. Two people that do not like turkey tried it and stated that they would eat turkey if everyone was able to cook a moist bird like mine. Of course I followed the recipie and also utilized a large food syringe to inject the broth and juices from the turkey into the breast and thighs of the bird during all the cooking of the bird. This was an outstanding recipie!

I have been making this recipe since 1998 and have always had rave reviews. I do brine my turkey and have never found it to be too salty and I always follow this recipe to the "T".

I've also been making this turkey, with some variations, since 1994 when it was first printed. I have brined it a couple of times, and just made sure to use unsalted chicken broth. It's terrific. I also cover the bird with soaked cheesecloth in a melted-butter wine mixture to help keep it moist.

Intially I made this recipe for Thanksgiving to rave reviews, and since, whenever I have larger dinner parties my guests request it. The turkey comes out wonderfully. Even the 'manly men' of the group, who swore an apricot glazed turkey was not turkey as god intended it, loved it. And the gravy...the best I've ever had. People were grabbing spoons and eating it right out of the blender! I recommend a sausage-apple stuffing from the Good Housekeeping cookbook to seal the deal here. I've not had one scrap of it left in 6 years of preparing it with this meal.

To Boston on 6/17, yes, I would basically cut the recipe in half (or bake the extra stuffing in a covered casserole). As far as cooking time, don't cut that in half. Use the cooking times listed on commercially bought turkeys as a guideline (about 3 to 3.5 hours for 10-12 lb. bird). For best results, though, use a meat thermometer to avoid overcooking (i.e., dry turkey). Another surefire way to achieve a moist bird would be to use a cooking bag but you lose the crispy skin. Cooking bags also mean low maintenance -- no basting. Good luck!!

Loved it. Delicious. Had a hard time calculating cook time for a smaller turkey - got lucky and cooked it the right amount of time (which ended up being more than the standard 10-12 minutes a pound). Didn't thin gravy enough on first try (too chunky) - but adding more broth made it just right.

I have been preparing this turkey recipe each year since 1995. I also use the New England Style Stuffing with it and the Buttermilk Mashed Potatoes all from the same issue.

A definite winner - moist and full of flavor. I recommend tenting with foil earlier than called for to prevent overbrowning. I used the New England Sausage and Cranberry Stuffing, and added chopped pecans for crunch. They went together well. I also tried the Cook's Illustrated suggestion to heat the stuffing that is going into the bird first in the microwave on high for 6-8 minutes. You then create a bag out of cheesecloth, place the stuffing inside the bag, and the bag inside the cavity. When the turkey is done, simply remove the bag and open - it worked great! The gravy was the best poultry gravy I ever tasted - even those who are not gravy fans smothered their potatoes and turkey.

What an incredible recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and WOW! did it turn out well. The gravy was superb. I was a bit worried it would be too oniony with the amount of onions I put in but that was not the case! The turkey glaze browned absolutely beautifully and everyone loved it. The herb butter gave the turkey a great flavor too. We will definitely be keeping this on hand for future turkey needs!!

I keep it tented longer than the recipe states so it doesn't blacken the skin and I also remove alot of the juices and onions in the last hour so the bottom of the turkey has a chance to get crispier. Even the children who are fussy eaters asked for more turkey.

Made this for Christmas sit down dinner for 28. This was by far the best tasting Turkey I have yet to make. The gravy was wonderful (needed to be thickened for my taste) with just a hint of apricot flavor. HINT: I agree-do as much preparation before as possible

This recipe is terrific. I made it for my first Thanksgiving dinner a few years ago; it is now a family mainstay.

I used this turkey recipe for the very first turkey I ever made and it turned out awesome! I got rave reviews from all of our guests. Everyone said it was the best turkey they had ever tasted. Very juicy!!!

I loved this recipe. It was the best tasting gravy I have ever made with turkey. No need to add any thickener. Rave reviwews from my guests.I would recommend doing as many steps a day or two beforehand. A lot less work on Thanksgiving.

To the cook from Virginia, I had to laugh when I read of your "impromyu survey." This is best turkey gravy me and my family have ever had, and we all hate "sweet, creamy" salad dressings, and only like sharp vinaigrettes. Yours is the only non-four fork review, I think.

My husband, who is not a turkey lover, said this was the best turkey ever. Quite delicious to me, too. I have also used the apricot glaze on a roast chicken, delectable! My one problem with the turkey was that the skin completely blackened. Next time, I would tent early on. Definitely a do-over.

My Thanksgiving guests declared this turkey to be the best they'd ever had. The gravy was wonderful and perfectly complimented the sweetness of the glaze. The herb butter and glaze gave the turkey a wonderful color. We needed to tent it with foil relatively early because the herb butter caused it to brown quite quickly, but with tenting and frequent basting, it was beautiful and perfectly tender. This is our new holiday favorite.

This was terrific. Usually cook the "big bird", as my granddaughter calls it, in the Weber BBQ, but tried this recipe and thought it outstanding. We are a family of "cooks" and enjoyed preparing this recipe. Many of the steps can be done the day before making Thanksgiving day a snap. The most moist and delicious turkey ever and the gravy was outstanding. The turkey soup made the next day was also outstanding, thanks to the turkey itself and the bit of left over gravy added. A definite hit!

FANTASTIC!! I have made several of the other Turkey recipes from Epicurious before, but this was far and away the best!!! If you have the time I greatly suggest making the glaze, herb butter and onions the night before. Also if cooking a larger turkey as I did, 25 Pounds, you will need to Tent it again during the last hour to avoid darkening the skin too much on top.

The turkey was great and beautiful looking! The cooking time seemed short, so I cooked it the standard way 325 at 15 min/lb and it worked great. While the gravy tasted good, I wasn't crazy about the texture. I'd try again with less onions and more drippings. Will definitely make again.

made for thanksgiving using a boned and tied turkey breast prepared by my butcher (had to untie some of stings to put butter under skin). Used my combination convection/microwave oven, putting on glaze last 1 hour. 7 pounds, total cooking time 2 hours. Best white meat ever! leftovers great

This is definitely the BEST Thanksgiving turkey I have ever made. Everybody was impressed and will be made in my house for all Holiday occasions (and none holidays)!!

If you like creamy and sweet salad dressings, such as thousand island or honey mustard, you may well fall in love with the gravy. If you prefer vinagrette on your greens, you are apt to be disappointed. Or such were the findings of an impromptu survey of a houseful of guests for Thanksgiving dinner. Everyone loved the turkey, which was tender, juicy, and flavorful. Opinions were divided on the gravy, however. All of the children and some of the teens and adults loved its creamy texture and decidedly sweet taste. The others were less enthralled. An observant teen noticed that there was a perfect correlation between the two groups and their earlier choice in salad dressing. Those who liked the gravy had gone with the thousand island, while those who didn't had selected the vinagrette.

Pretty as a picture and easy too when you prepare the onion mixture and glaze the day ahead.

This was fabulous!! The directions and ingredient list were visually overwhelming at first glance, though the entire recipe was very straightforward. I used a basic cornbread stuffing I have used for years, to which I added roasted pecans, fresh cranberries, and sauteed diced apples, onion, and celery. The gravy was the best I have ever made or tasted!!

The turkey was so moist and sweet it almost melted in your mouth! Excellent all the way around. My sister-in-law made this bird yesterday and we are still licking our lips.

I truly enjoyed this recipe when I used it to cook my turkey last year, so much so that I am using it again this year. The one thing that I might suggest is to place a peeled onion and some fresh herbs inside the cavity of the bird during the cooking. It makes the bird much more flavorful. Oh, and don't forget to tuck the wings under the body of the turkey to avoid burning!

Oh my God! This was soooo good! I am used to plain ol' turkey and plain giblet gravy, but this year I went all out on my own and it was worth it! This recipe made our Thanksgiving so rich and flavorful, just like the magazine pictures! If you want it to be PERFECT, add the giblets and make the CRANBERRY RELISH recipe!

I have been making this recipe at least twice a year since its debut in 1994. My family loves it. Every year we have new people that come and rave about it. I have made it with a smaller bird and cut the recipe by 2/3. Although it seems like a lot of work the steps are simple and make ahead.

I have made this turkey since the recipe came out in 1994 and always get rave reviews. I have a recipe for stuffing with sausage and apricots which compliments it greatly and I usually also add some apricot preserves or left over nectar to the gravy, which gives it a little sweetness!

Does anyone have suggestions for making this recipe with a much smaller bird? -- like a 10-12 lb turkey?? Would you just cut everything in half?? Thanks!

I have made this recipe for Thanksgiving every year since it first appeared. It is wonderful! The best part is definitely the gravy. It's foolproof and better than any other.

We tried this recipe after numerous other TurkeyDay failures and it came out fabulous. I don't think I'd want to roast turkey any other way. The apricot glaze was meant for this bird, no question.

The Nov. 1994 Bon Appetit that featured this recipe pairs the Apricot-Glazed Turkey with the "Northwestern Wild Mushroom Stuffing" or the " New England Sausage, Apple and Dried Cranberry Stuffing". I'm sure they will be on this site. Good Luck.

I'm looking forward to making this turkey for Thanksgiving, and wondering what would be the best stuffing to go with it? Any suggestions? I'd appreciate it! Thanks!

I was assigned the task of making the 1997 Thanksgiving turkey, and need a recipe. This one sounded good, so I decided to try it. Well, it was a hit at dinner. Everyone loved it! I lost the recipe between Thanksgiving and Christmas and tore my house up looking for it. After two years, I just found it. Yipeee!

My sister and I have made this turkey 2 times then lost the recipe. We and the family have been dying for it ever since. The gravy was sensational!

We agree with the other reviews. We have made this recipe year after year and continue to get great results. My brother-in-law who is a chef has already put in reservations to come back to my house for turkey next year!

Great instructions-easy to adjust for smaller bird. Everyone loved the taste and the color was to die for. It was picture perfect!

This turkey got a big, fat A+ from my family!! I will definately make this again. It was very moist and beautiful when it was done. Fresh herbs are a must!

All I can say is ditto to some of the earlier reviews. Be prepared if you make this once, you'll make it again and again! This makes year number 5 for me! It is such a beautiful bird when it's done! I follow the recipe exactly except I put the glaze on 2hrs into it instead of time in recipe. Also, let me recommend using fresh herbs, it's a world of difference in flavor and looks!

The mild apricot flavor was wonderful and the drippings made the best gravy I have ever had. We enjoyed it so much last year I plan to make it again this year.

Absolutely wonderful

Since first making this recipe, it has become a family favorite for our Thanksgiving dinner. The roasted shallot gravy is smooth and rich, and the combination of the herb butter with the apricot glaze gives the turkey a unique flavor. The stuffing and cranberry relish recommended in the magazine are nice accompaniments to the menu as well.

I usually serve lamb for Easter dinner but last year my younger son demanded "bird", meaning turkey. A friend who was coming for dinner was skeptical about the apricot glaze, but even he thought it was absolutely delicious, as did my son who kept demanding throughout dinner, "More bird!" I used just plain butter and eliminated fuss at the end by using a hand blender right in the pan to blend the onion with the broth. Just be careful not to put the glaze on too early.
