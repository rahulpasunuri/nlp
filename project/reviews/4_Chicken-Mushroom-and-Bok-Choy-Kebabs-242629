OK, now for the real review. Made the meal as per the recipe - make sure to use reduced sodium soy sauce, otherwise you might find the dish rather salty. A bite with all three flavours and textures was delicious. The grilled veggies offset the salty chicken tang perfectly. We will certainly make again.

I subbed honey for the brown sugar, used tamari instead of light soy for the marinade. I roasted potatoes and zucchini with a cut of moose, added the veggies then blended it in a food processor. I don't know why I made a marinade. It was excellent. Maybe I'll make this recipe next time. I can understand a few suggestions (a little less of this, a little more of that). But come on people!! If you're not making the recipe, then don't review the recipe!

I made the marinade with 1/8 cup brown sugar. When the liquids reduced,I added 1 tablespoon of hoisin sauce and used 1 teaspoon of sesame oil. We left the chicken thighs whole and grilled them. Then we stir fried mushrooms, bok choy, red bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, onions, and a seeded serrano chili with very little oil and the remaining saved marinade. It was excellent made this way. Maybe we'll try the kebab method next time.

Very flavorful with the marinade. We used baby bellas and they turned out great.

Thought it was good but not great - but my sweetie practially ate the platter, so I'll make it again. Easy enough to do - maybe next time I'll do whole boneless thighs instead of kabobs.

So simple and delicious. The marinade recipe is what really makes this dish rise above good to great. Didn't have sesame oil so subbed olive oil, and used a mixture of Marsala wine and rice wine vinegar instead of Sherry. Since it wasn't nice outside we also chose to broil the vegetables and chicken which worked splendidly. We just took the skewers of vegetables and chicken (separated) out of the oven as they cooked, and kept them warm with foil. Highly recommended! Also used chicken breast and it was delicious.

I use the marinade/basting sauce for the boneless thighs alone...either on the grill or under the broiler...it has such a good flavor! (adding stir-fried or roasted veggies on the side)

I've made this twice now, once with baby bok choy, once without, however, both times superb. This was my first time eating baby bok choy and all I can say is that my meat and potatoes boyfriend loved it...it was really just so good and tender. I marinaded the chicken for probably 3-4 hours each time, the second 1/2-1 hour longer and while the chicken was excellent, or finger looking good as DBH stated, I do see how time is your friend with the marinade...it really is that good! I also added red and green pepper the second time and it was fabulous!! Highly recommend!!

Used extra garlic (I love garlic), subbed the Sherry for some red wine I had on hand, followed the marinade instructions and tossed the marinade with the chicken, bok choy (full size, just cut the white stalks into big chunks - my store didn't have baby), and didn't bother diluting the flavor by tossing anything with the vegetable oil (excluded it completely). Absolutely fabulous. I grilled, my roommate stir fried her portion, both just fantasticccc. Easy, would make again.

I did the recipe as recommended with the chicken ingredients and my DH loved it. To me it tastes like the bourbon chicken you get at a mall. Didn't do the mushrooms or bok choy and also cut up chicken but didn't put it on skewers, just cooked on the pan you cook fish on so small items don't fall thru the grates.

Made this last night. We both loved it. The Bok Choy did not come out well though, maybe it is too late in the season? I quickly made some rice, broccoli to go with it instead. Yummy!

This marinade is fantastic! The chicken/kebabs are o moist and tender and the marinade flavor is out of this world. Even the bok choy could use some of the basting. I served this with Orange Couscous for an excellent dinner.

This is a really great dish as is. Everyone loved it. I use the marinade for fish and stir-fry too (except I don't boil it when I'm stir-frying).

Awesome. Served with cous cous. People loved it.

This was really good. I didn't bother blanching and shocking the bok choy or skewereing it. I just cut it in half and grilled along with the skeweres, basting it with the marinade. Bright flavors! Will do again.

So easy to make and delicious....not much planning needed. Perfect for a summer night on the patio. I love bok choy but was not a big fan of it grilled, otherwise the mushrooms and chicken were tasty.
