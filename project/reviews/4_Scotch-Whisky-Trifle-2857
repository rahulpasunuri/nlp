Made this for my husband's 30th and subbed the scotch for bourbon since that's his favorite booze. Bourbon worked really well with all the flavors, adding a nice heat. Omitted bananas and used raspberry jam and whole blackberries for the fruit. Added some chopped dark chocolate in a few layers. All in all, it was great, especially the custard.

I've had this recipe for years and finally made it for this year's Christmas dinner. I shouldn't have waited so long - it was a huge hit. What looks like a rather ladylike dessert proved especially popular with the men as they realized it had Scotch in it. I did leave the bananas out but made the rest of it as written. Don't skip this one; authentic or not, it has fabulous flavor, looks beautiful, and there's no last minute fuss.

This is nothing remotely like a Scotch trifle.

I made this recipe for Christmas this year. I used my own homemade plum jam instead of store-bought jam which would have too much sweetness. I didn't put the top layer of whipping cream on the trifle since the two layers of cake/fruit/custard were fine with a top layer of fruit. I made my own pound cake from Betty Crocker vs buying something frozen. I used fresh raspberries from California which you can get in nicer stores.

I made this trifle at Christmas and am just getting around to reviewing it. I make a different trifle every year at holiday time but this recipe is one I will definitely make again. The only change I made was to use cherry preserves and frozen cherries as I was unable to find raspberries either fresh or frozen. The cherry flavor was a nice change from the more traditional raspberry that is often used in trifle recipes. I also sprinkled some slivered almonds over the top for crunch. I too became confused with the layering instructions but everything worked out. This recipe has become a favorite of mine along with the pear and apple Autumn Trifle recipe also on this site which is excellent but a lot more time consuming to make.

Delicious! There is a small typo. In the assembly instructions, it says "layer fruit over" where it should say "layer over fruit." I reread this several times, because if you put fruit down, that would mean you'd need to layer the fruit in thirds, not half amounts. Anyway, very yummy! I used a bag of frozen raspberries and boxes of fresh.

This is the second year I have made this trifle for a St. Patrick's Day party for 30+ people. I double the recipe and simply it and save time by using boxed pudding rather than making my own custard. I use a combination of butterscoth and vanilla. Turns out just great. I probably add a wee bit more whiskey (Irish, or course) than called for in the recipe. I have requests for the recipe every year and even the skinny none dessert eaters go for this one.

This was okay. I used Irish whiskey as suggested, with no other substitutions. No need to cook the custard in a double boiler. I like my own recipe, aka Henry's Favorite Trifle, better, and so does my husband Henry. It is a Low Country recipe that uses homemade poundcake, vanilla custard, raspberries, peaches, whipped cream and lots of sherry. Henry was gracious, however, and managed to choke down a large serving. The other guests thought it was great, but what do they know?

I made this yesterday for an event, and everyone loved it. I didn't have instant coffee or raspberry jam, so I used kahlua liqueur and strawberry jam instead. The substitutions worked like a charm. I garnished the trifle with fresh strawberries and it looked beautiful. Impressive and sinfully delicious. Has to be well chilled.

I made this last year for a St. Patrick's Day party with Jameson's Irish whiskey instead of Scotch. I left out the bananas and used extra raspberries. It was the best trifle I've ever made OR tasted, everyone gobbled it up, and I've had multiple requests for it again this year. I highly recommend this recipe!

This was tasty but I'm not sure if the flavours really melded that well together. The custard was delicious. Perhaps too many raspberries...?

My husband tasted this trifle, asked me to marry him and now we have a baby. I highly recommend this trifle.

I have made this for several family and friend parties. People love it. Try it with Jack Daniels and people will rave (I know, it's bourbon, not Scotch, but it's great)

I subsituted Irish Whiskey (Bushmill's) for the Scotch and made this for a Saint Patrick's Day supper. I used far less than a cup of jam, and got rave reviews for the dessert.

I've made this every Christmas Eve since 1990- My friends won't let me in the door without it!

Made this at Christmas and was disapointed as I had high hopes based on the others comments. Was not bad but I will go back to my old trifle recipe.

I have substituted the scotch whiskey with grand marnier and it has turned out excellent. Either way, this is a great dessert.

My wife made this receipe for Christmas Eve dinner and it was the hit of the party. A little labor intensive but well worth it. We will have this dessert again and again.
