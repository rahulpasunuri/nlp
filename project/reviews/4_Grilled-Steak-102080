You cant go wrong with this simple recipe. I also try to do a small variation of the theme. A friend made me try putting mustard and garlic around the steak. Grill as instructed and it is wonderful. I have it with some small boiled potatoes with olive oil and rosemary on the side. The steak is great with some horse radish.

I am making it right now . Yet I am adding a slight touch of my own. I marinated the T-bone over in a mix of Balsamic vinegrette and a Rasberry Balsamic Vinegrette adding pepper, seasoned salt, sage, oregano, and chile powder. With sides of baked potato and sliced red and yellow peppers with onions in a butter and light pepper sauce. Gotta love grills
