This recipe leaves a lot up to your imagination. I am a chef and have limited but some experiance with fresh pasta doughs. I do not recomend this for anyone. REALLY BAD

I tried this dough with all purpose flour because it was all I had and I've made pasta dough before with AP. It was a disaster. It was tough and dry and terrible.

Although I am the first to acknowledge that the amounts of eggs and flour can vary because of differences in the hydration of the flour and the size of the eggs, there really seems like there are way too few eggs here for the amount of flour. As I started out using the traditional well method, my original ball would have left about half of the flour on the board. I ended up adding an additional two eggs, three tablespoons of water and one tablespoon of olive oil in order to bring this dry ball together with the dough hook of my mixer. Perhaps my use of real italian pasta flour (dopio 0) had something to do with it?
