I like to mix the sugared blackberries with plain greek yogurt. It is a great quick and easy breakfast or light dessert.

I made this last winter and just came across the recipe again. I concur with brittydear. Made with berries from Trader Joe's, this was just sweet--it had no depth of flavor. It lasted a long time (several months) in the fridge so is a good & easy recipe if you have the right berries.

Oh, how funny! I just made one batch with tart wild blackberries - perfect. I made one with farmer's market blackberries (good berries)- WAY too sweet! Wow - tastes like pure sugar. Same recipe - very different results!

Delish and loved by all. Now if only it didn't have so much sugar! I tried it with less, but it was just not the same.

I've made this with both blackberries and raspberries. It's definitely thinner than preserves but tastes very fresh and is SO easy to make. I highly recommend it over vanilla ice cream - yum! I only used 2 cups of sugar the last time I made it and it was sweet enough. I may try to 1/2 the sugar next time.

What a wonderful, easy way to make homemade preserves! These are more runny than store bought preserves but taste so fresh. I may try it with less sugar next time to make it a bit healthier.
