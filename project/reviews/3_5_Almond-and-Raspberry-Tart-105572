this was not a hit. i've come to realize with this recipe that i must not be a fan of tarts made with jam. dry, too sweet, and unbalanced. this recipe is easy but i would rather spend more time on something that would actually taste good.

This tart was very easy to make. The crust was tasty but a bit tougher than I would have liked - maybe baked too long? I took it out at only 30 minutes and it was already browned. Made exactly as described but melted the extra 2 tablespoons of jam as suggested by another reviewer. I then gently tossed the berries in it and stood them on end in the baked tart. Presentation was beautiful and everyone loved it. Served it with softened vanilla ice cream. I will definitely make this one again

Made this recipe to bring to a friend's house for dinner. Didn't have any almond extract so I used some Amaretto. My crust browned much quicker than 40 minutes (more like 27 minutes) so I took it out then. I crushed the almonds in the food processor before adding them to the crust and the topping. I also heated the jam to make it a liquid before adding the raspberries. I stood them all on end as I added them to the tart. The results were beautiful and delicious and got raves from everyone. Not as much work as it looks like either.

This was so easy and so yummy. A high quality jam is essential however! I'm going to make it vegan next time with earth balance instead of butter and an egg substitute so I can serve dessert to my vegan guests.

This was an easy and beautiful looking dessert. It tasted fine, and was much admired and enjoyed by guests. I added chambord (raspberry liqueur) to the jam toss of the raspberries. I was not satisfied with the crust; it came out too hard. Next time I might cook it less, although I already cut the baking time from 40 to 30 minutes, based on the tart's appearance.

First the compliment: the crust was very easy and tasted great. I also liked the toasted almonds. And it comes out looking very pretty. However, the tart ultimately tasted like I was eating baked jelly, which is essentially what it is. I didn't like that very much.

I made this tart to bring to a barbeque with friends and was happy with the results. Although my almonds got a little too brown when toasting and were a little too strong in taste, the overall tart was very tastey, not too sweet, but just sweet enough. This is a perfect dessert to really showcase the flavor of fresh summer raspberries.

This recipe was extremely easy... and yummy, too! I forgot to add the almond extract to the crust the first time and it was still great -- can't wait to make it with the almond next!

This was a great and easy recipe to make. I improvised to use my new Mini Muffin pan. I also whipped up some cream and almond extract for a great topping with the fresh Raspberries. Mini Almond and Raspberry Tarts make a great finger dessert. This is going to be a new part of our regular Thanksgiving dinner tradition.
