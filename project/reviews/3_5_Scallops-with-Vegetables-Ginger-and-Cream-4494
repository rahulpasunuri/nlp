Great, as is -- wouldn't change a thing.

This was one of the most delicious scallop dishes I have ever had. As an addition to it, I served it over mashed cauliflower to soak up the extra sauce. Low Carb and satisfying!

This was so much better than I expected. Even while I was cooking I was thinking this was going to be an average meal but the cream sauce really gave it a kick. I added a few leeks to the veggies and crisped the rest up and served sprinkled on top. I also cooked everything in the same pan and I think the cream sauce was enhanced by having the veggies drippings also. My husband loved it! Also, good with chicken with skin cooked until crispy.

This dish is excellent and I've made it a few times.

Loved it! Looks great, tastes great, easy to bring together (those veggies can be julienned ahead of time)! I DID include the turnip (mild peppery taste) and the chili oil as reccomended. This is an impressive starter.

A very tasty dish! Agree with one of the previous reviews that a dash of chile oil provided a much needed kick - just the whipping cream alone is too bland. We omitted the turnip as well, and added a healthy dose of cilantro, both to the veggies in the final stage of sautéing and as a garnish.

This was a great dish, beautiful presentation. I omitted the turnip and added two bunches of scallions for more color. Also, added 1 teaspoon of chili paste to the cream for more flavor. Big hit at my house, nice enough for a dinner party and easy.

I increased the amount of Zucchini and decreased the turnips. I also added a little extra cream and butter. I found a little more sauce was needed. Overall, loved the recipe and it looked beautiful. Nice presentation
