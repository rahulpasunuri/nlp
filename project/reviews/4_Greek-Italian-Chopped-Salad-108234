I have made this salad a few times now, using Gorgonzola instead of Feta (which I am sure would be great too). It always gets rave reviews. I have also used green olives instead of kalamata and liked it both ways.

Served with Pasta with Shrimp and Artichokes on this site and both got raves. So easy and delicious. A great Italian dinner. Didn't change a thing.

I did not have the fennel and wanted this to be vegetarian for my niece, so skipped the salami....did add a bunch of chopped cilantro in as well - but virtually everything else the same....yummy

Somehow all these ingredients work beautifully! I used less fennel (I only like a hint of fennel),used kale instead of romaine and omitted the olives - it was absolutely delish! I chopped everything up in small bites and it was a great low-carb lunch for a few days.

I made this salad for a Greek-themed meal, and it was THE hit. The fennel is amazing, and the flavors blend together beautifully. The only thing I would change are the garbanzo beans...too dense without enough flavor -- maybe I'll substitute orzo instead.

Perfection! We made this with some grilled ribeye steaks and french bread brushed with olive oil and sea salt that we toasted on the grill. This salad looks and tastes amazing. Fantastic combination of flavours. The changes I made: I forgot the chickpeas, but don't feel that I would add them next time. It just would have been too much. I couldn't find fennel, so I just crushed up some fennel seeds and added them to the dressing. We both hate feta, so we used goat cheese instead. I added some fresh oregano leaves to the dressing on top of the dried that it called for. The proportion of dressing to salad is spot on. Definitely try this!

I served this salad at a buffet housewarming party and everyone raved about it - even a couple of people who said they don't usually like salad. I served the dressing on the side so that the lettuce wouldn't wilt, and it held up very well for the 3-hour party. As other suggested, I added a bit more garlic to the dressing; I also added some dijon mustard to help the dressing emulsify. Another reviewer said the fennel was indespensible, and I agree; I don't usually enjoy fennel, but it fits very well here.

Delicious salad and very easy. I love the chopped salads for the ease of eating and blending of flavors. The dressing was very good. I left out the salami.

We thought this was great, tho I did substitue fresh lemon juice for the wine vinegar. I'll make this again!

I thought it was a good recipe, but I added provolone cheese and not feta. I have this same dish at a restaurant in Dallas. I agree with the other comment. It did more garlic.

I want to make this and a lasagna recipe in Epicurious, both of which have fennel. I love the taste, but think it might be too much for my guests. Is leaving it out of this salad a mistake?

The dressing and the ingredients are so versatile. I think the dressing could use more garlic (as we like it) and red wine vinegar is a good option, too. Try fresh oregano, it's awesome! As for the salad, add what you like - we like the chickpeas, salami, but try proscuitto, black beans - be creative - you'll discover what works. Good, fresh produce does make the difference, though. Arugula is sooo good in this....Too many cooks rank a recipe on it's exact portions or ingredients. Recipes are meant to be altered to an individual's taste. Have fun and enjoy!!

TRUELY AMAZING! An excellent, easy salad with lot's of fresh tastes. Obviously, use good produce for any salad - it's only as good as its ingredients. Note: if you don't like garbanzo beans, leave them out.

Oh Dear - I hate to be the one opposing opinion on this, but I really did not care for this salad. Part of the problem I know was the tasteless produce I was forced to buy at the local Dominick's store - just horrible! Maybe with better quality produce this would have been a 2 forker. Still I didn't really care for the texture of the chickpeas and the salami. Felt it needed more olives, maybe some tomatoes and some fresh herbs. The dressing was good but that's about the only good thing I can say.

This is an amazing salad! Whatever you do don't skip the fennel. I suggest adding more olives to the salad and more garlic to the dressing. I used arugula as others suggested. Not only is this delicious, but it looks beautiful on the platter. My guests raved!

Yum!!! This salad is simple and has a great combination of flavors. I will be making this again and again for summer meals. I made it about 1 hour ahead and it held up very well in the fridge.

This salad is outstanding. Very fresh and light. Goes well with just about any type of meal.I especially liked the sliced fennel bulb, really adds more dimension to the salad. I added a pinch of sugar to the dressing to cut the vinegar and added cherry tomatoes for additional color, but otherwise made no changes. A definite make again!

This was exactly what I had in mind for a Greek salad. Made it "by the book" except for that fennel . . . Will definitely do this one again.

Omitted fennel. Added sliced cucumber. Replaced romaine with arugula. Fabulous. Having pot luck with the same friends tonight -- this salad was requested. Just perfect for a hot summer night. I can pick up the ingredients on my way from work to my host's and thow it together on the spot. How easy can you get?

this recipe was super easy to prepare and really tasty. I didn't have any white wine vinegar so I used equal parts distilled white vinegar and red wine vinegar. Perfect for summer!

I used balsamic vinegar instead of red and it brought out the flavors beautifully. I also added artichoke hearts as was suggested.

This was delicious! I took the suggestion of one cook and used pepperoncini instead of pepperoni -- also added marinated artichoke hearts. Very tasty!

Excellent! We have this often - a green salad with extra umph - goes well with so many things. For me, the missing element in the dressing is an added 3/4 teaspoon of sugar. Also use butcher shop German salami - extra kick.

Fantastic, quick, and easily adaptable salad - I made this for a large group and everyone loved it. I substituted pepperoncinis for salami for a vegetarian version. Will definitely enjoy throughout the summer.

I really enjoyed this recipe - we had it for the 4th of July, and while it could have used more of a kick in the dressing, it reminded me how much I love the taste of fennel. I'd definitely make it again but would "zip" it up next time.

Great salad & fairly easy to prepare. I took it to a backyard bar-b-que and received tons of requests for the recipe. I would suggest reserving some of the chickpeas to sprinkle on top of the salad after tossing; they're so heavy they went straight to the bottom of the bowl.

This salad is great. It was easy to put together and with a little bread, would make a good summer meal. I thought the fennel was very important to the overall flavor. (If you can' find fennel, it's possible that your grocery store refers to it as "anise"). I also used red wine vinegar, instead of white wine vinegar, and I left out the red onions.

Wow. I make a lot of salads and have made a lot of very good salads but this was the best by far. (My boyfriend said that I really out did myself with this one). I adopted a few small variations. I used fresh mozzarella (because I had it on hand and my boyfriend despises feta.) It worked well. I also added shredded carrots just for more texture and vitamins. For the dressing, I used red wine vinegar and added about 1/2 tsp or perhaps a bit more of dijon mustard. Finally, I read that some have tried excluding the fennel bulb but I suspect the fennel adds some important complements in terms of flavor. This was our main course.

To change this recipe is to make the beautifully simple needlessly complex. It wants for nothing - fall back & enjoy!!!

This salad is excellent!!! I put in 1/2c. feta and 1/2c. fresh mozzarella and used red wine vinegar instead of white wine. Also, left out the fennel since I couldn't find any in grocery store.

I made this recipe with a pasta,garlic bread, and tiramasu for an all together great Italian Meal. It is very easy and very good. I tossed the salad together the morning of my dinner party and set in the refridge all day. Then, I just added the dressing as my guests arrived. I made the dressing the day before and also put it in the fridge. Just bring the dressing out a little before the guests arrive to bring it to room temperature and wisk it before topping the salad.

Very good! Definately would make again. I might add provolone cheese next time.

Delicious! This salad is soooo good - it's similar to Cheesecake Factory's Mediterranian Salad. I did make a couple minor changes: I added 1/2 teaspoon Dejon mustard to the dressing, reduced the red onion to 1/4 cup, and I omitted the fennel. We all gave this two thumbs up!

I made this chopped salad last night (cut in half) as a simple warm-night dinner. Omitted the bell pepper and fennel, which we don't like, and added diced zucchini, tomato and carrots for texture and color. Delicious salad! I added some salt and pepper. Mounded the salad on dinner plates and placed slices of juicy marinated grilled chicken breasts on top like spokes. Yummy, simple dinner - the Genoa salami really adds tons of flavor. Fun, adaptable method.
