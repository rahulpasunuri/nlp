The flavors didn't meld for me at all - the grapefruit was nice, but a weird contrast to the big pieces of dried fruit.

This is wonderful! I made it after a Christmas brunch and served it with assorted cookies. It was a refreshing and delightful combination and a light, healthy alternative to traditional, heavy holiday desserts. My guests all loved it and asked for more!
