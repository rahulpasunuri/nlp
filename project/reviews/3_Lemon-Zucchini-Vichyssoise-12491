This is a nice recipe. Vichyssoise is a gentle cold soup and the zucchini is an appropriate addition. Next time I would add a little lemon zest to give it more of a lemon flavor. For those using milk and complaining about the milk curdling trying using what the recipe calls for CREAM! It's only 1/3 cup and it won't curdle.

I have been making this soup for years, and it always gets raves. It's important to let the soup cool a bit before adding the lemon juice. Also, I find it's better with whole milk or half and half. Additionally, I use salted chicken broth, as I have never been fond of the taste of low salt broth (perhaps this explains the "rancid" taste one reviewer experienced). Seasoning is vital as well -- too much salt, or not enough, will destroy the balance. Finally, it needs to be thoroughly chilled before serving.

I used fresh zucchini from the garden and everything else from the farmers market, and this soup was ok at first, but after about a half of a second it acquired an almost rancid aftertaste (lemon and dairy is just not a good combination). Even my husband, who is a total zucchini-nut, hated this recipe--i think i may be losing my status as his favorite cook!!! It might be better if you deglaze the pan with some white wine and add a little bit of cayenne pepper. There are a few better recipes for zucchini soup on this site and i will be sticking to them from now on. Jetzt weiﬂ ich bescheid!!

We found it absolutely outstanding. Sorry that we are running out of zucchini in the garden.

I made this expecting great results given the 2 previous reviews and was very disappointed. I will never trust a four fork recipe blindly again.

Wonderful soup! It was better the second day. Right now it's the third day, and it's still great. Add sliced almonds at the end to improve the texure and flavor--goes great with the lemon and looks very attractive.

Outstanding soup! Tart and refreshing, and not too rich to come before a meal. We love it and eat it often throughout the summer.
