Good but not spectacular, almost a little odd-tasting. Maybe the peppercorns should be drained.

This was not at all what my husband had in mind. Steak with peppercorn sauce is one of his all-time favorites, but evidently this recipe missed the mark. Was very runny and the taste just wasn't right.

Made this tonight with my Boyfriend. I am a Veggie and did not try it...so here is what he said: 1. It was too salty....well that was our fault! We did not use low-salt stock OOPS! Seems to me like you might not even need the stock at all! Especially if you are adding the sauce to the beef drippings....maybe just add a cup of milk or water, then it would not take so long to make thick.? 2. It does take a LONG TIME to get thick.....well we got tired of waiting...the meat was done and so i made a solution of three teaspoons cornstarch in a couple of tablespoons cold water and slowly mixed that into it while it was boiling. When it was thick enough we were happy. ( note: ADD SLOWLY cornstarch will sneak up on you and then you will have paste not gravy...yuck!!!) 3. More Pepper. He loves the pepper, and wanted more pepper taste. In the recipe we just used a teaspoon of mixed peppercorns ( crushed) He liked those, and said he did not need any other kind ..just more of em! 3. Overall it was good, but nothing great. He would make it agian but not soon, and would omit chicken, add pepper!

mushrooms would be a nice addition

I just made this and I was not impressed. I may have done something wrong because the sauce didn't get very thick. It wasn't bad, but there are better options for similar dishes. Check the Beef Stroganoff on this site. Cooking the beef first so you have the juice in the sauce from the start really works. Plus, in the Stroganoff you use beef broth, mustard and dill. The small differences make the dish much better.

Very Nice. I used a little more cream and reduced to a very thick sauce.

Very tender and juicy. I couldn't find the green peppercorns in brine, but did find green peppercorns in the spice isle. Expensive!! Almost $10 for a small jar. Yikes. Luckily you only need a small amount. I made my own brine by steeping the peppercorns in water, sugar, and salt overnight. Worked well. Served with horseradish mashed potatoes from this site and a spinach/grape tomato salad.

This sauce was awesome! I used only 1 cup of chicken broth and 1/3 cup of Cognac (I ran out). Sauce got nice and thick after 20 minutes. My husband loved it!!!

This is one of the easiest, tastiest sauces for steak. I use filet mignon and rather than pan fry, I cook it on a gas grill. Even without the steak juices, this sauce is marvelous. I use fat free half and half instead of cream and it works very well. Don't skimp on the peppercorns. I add extra peppercorns as I love pepper. I just printed the recipe again for tonights dinner.

This was pretty good, not fantastic. My husband liked it more than I did. It took a while to thicken the sauce, much longer than the recipe said. I also thought that the sauce would have been better without adding it to the meat juices.

it's excelente even thought I changed a bit the original, just by frying the meat first and just then starting the sauce taking advantage of all that juice meat flavors left in the sauté. also I changed the cream for butter to give a little shinning to the finished sauce.

Have made this three times now....the last time I was out of cognac and I substituted sherry...the sauce with the sherry was the best, by far. This is a delicious recipe, especially with the Parmesan Potato Pave. YUM!

I skipped the green peppercorns - I bought some at the store, but when I opened the bottle, I just couldn't take the smell. But the recipe didn't seem hurt by the lack of them - it was really a wonderful sauce. Easy too.

This was a really good recipe. It was relatively easy, the sauce wasn't too heavy and tasted great!

I haven't tried this yet, but if you want a similar recipe that's FABULOUS, try "Peppercorn Steaks with Bourbon Sauce" on this site. I doubt you will be disappointed.

I kept the basics of this, but modified it a bit, and the results were out of this world. I seasoned the raw meat with the pepper, then, because the meat was a bit thicker than called for, I seared it on top of the stove and then transfered it to a baking pan in the oven to finish. Meanwhile, I used the pan I had browned the meat in to make the sauce. I cooked the shallots, added the cognac, and then a bit of butter instead of cream. Wonderful!
