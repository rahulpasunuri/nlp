Love this recipe - easy to make and incredibly fragrant. I recommend making additional sauce, as it's great on cous cous as a side.

Didn't love it, didn't hate it. It was easy to make. Sauce was a little tart. Cous cous was the high point.

I have made this recipe a few times now and it has also become my favorite marinade for chicken kabobs when grilling. I put green pepper, onion and mushrooms on the skewers with it. Purr-fectly wonderful!!

To die for! Amazing chicken! I made this as part of a middle eastern feast, and I was so glad there were leftovers of this so that I could eat it for lunch the next day!

This was a good, easy recipe although it was a touch too salty. I did find, however, that the chicken took a few minutes longer to cook than stated in the recipe.

I was searching for a recipe for Ginger Chicken, using just the ingredients I had on hand, when I came across this. Although I didn't have the sherry and had a lemon instead of lime, the recipe was great! I had an East-Indian friend over for dinner and he thought it was just fine the way it was, and that it had a nice balance of spices. I served it with long-grain white rice, although the brown rice sounded good, too. I will make this again for sure!!

I made this for my book club and we all raved-- it was delicious. Nine-year old son thought too spicy, but the adults were more than pleased. I will make this again for sure.

I added this recipe to my regular rotation about a year ago. If it is not made with low-salt soy sauce it comes out way too salty, but otherwise, it's a good chicken dish. I usually serve it with brown rice!

I made this for friends. Not only was it fast and easy, everyone loved it!! I used strips of chicken and served it with couscous and cauliflower. I'm already planning on making it again!

The only thing I changed about this recipe was using fresh thyme instead of dried (and only because I had fresh on hand and no dried). We really liked this. I served it with cous cous made with chicken stock and shallots and the watercress and broccoli salad with dried cranberries from this site. We had it last night and now today I'm slicing the leftover chicken breast and having it in the broccoli salad for lunch! Healthy and tasty!

I have made this dish twice for weeknight dinners with husband. It tastes good and it's easy to make. I added canned diced tomatos and canned portobellos - pretty tasty!! Served with broccoli & salad.

My family just loves this recipe! I make it the original way and serve it with couscous. Sometimes I add more garlic and ginger, but it has been a longtime favorite.

We loved this. I added some leftover red/green peppers and tomato with the onion, plus red pepper flakes and a little jarred curry sauce to give it some body. We didn't have curry powder so I just used a little cinnamon, tumeric and allspice.....also didn't have fresh ginger so used ground........was still great with broccoli and basmati......wish we had some naan!

With regular soy it is WAY too salty; it's vital to use low-sodium. Otherwise, very fresh tasting if not spicy enough for my taste. Next time I would beef up the spices, maybe more ginger and garlic. The pita idea is great; this would work well.

I used this recipe as a stepping stone to chicken pitas. I created a yogurt sauce to serve over the chicken which had cuccumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce stuffed with the chicken into warm pitas with the yogurt sauce and paprika drizzled inside. Served with Mango cous cous as a side dish.

To use a technical term, num-nums! I made it basically as written the first time (had to substitute ground ginger for fresh, and a splash of merlot instead of sherry), and served it with rice. Next time I had six pieces of chicken to use and I doubled the marinade so there would be more sauce for the rice. Sweet idea if I do say so myself. :) Nice tangy flavour, a nice foray into the world of middle eastern cuisine! I'll make this again for sure.

I was in the mood for Middle Eastern, and I felt this tasted too Asian with the soy sauce and ginger. Also too salty (although I did use regular soy sauce). My husband liked it, but he eats anything.

I don't have a lot of cooking experience. I found this dish easy to make and delicious. I served it with couscous which makes it a simple meal to fix.

Decent dish and easy to make, but a little too tart. Next time I'm going to try adding some honey and a bit less lime in the marinade; if that doesn't work, substituting orange juice instead of lime might be interesting.

Middle Eastern cuisine is one of my favorites. This spice combination is fantastic and it smells wonderful.

This was terrible! The smell of it cooking made me nauseous! I guess I'm not a curry lover. You need to be to like this recipe.

This is a good, easy recipe for a mid-week dinner, but it's nothing special. There are other, better week-night chicken recipes on this website. Hold on to this recipe until you find a better one for your "greatest hits" file.

excellent!! made over Middle eastern brand boxed couscous in garlic and olive oil flavor. The lime and ginger give it a great kick.

Very flavourful and easy to make. I thickened the broth a wee bit, added a touch more sherry and served it with rice and steamed green peas and baby carrots. Healthy and low fat!

Very tasty. One of my favorite dishes to make. Great with flavored couscous.
