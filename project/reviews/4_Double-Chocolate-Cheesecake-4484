There is only one problem with this recipe--once you make it, your family and friends will beg for it for years. Given how easy it is, that may not sound like a problem, but as someone who loves to experiment with pastry I have to admit I'm a little bored with it. At this point when someone says, "why don't you bring something for dessert?" I know they really mean "bring that chocolate cheesecake!" On the other hand, I stay on everyone's invitation list :)

Excellent, easy recipe. Didn't have any instant coffee so I replaced it with a tablespoon of grand marnier. I also used 1/2 cream and 1/2 baileys for the glaze. Rave reviews.

Rating: 4
This was exceptional. Smooth texture, rich flavor, delicious all around. The coffee flavor was just the right balance to the chocolate -- a taste of coffee, but not overpowering. I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust, and didn't need a full 9 oz. I didn't bother with the glaze on top. Multiple people asked for the recipe and I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely Excellent. Presents beautifully. I was short on time and only started it at 11:00 a.m., needing it for 6 pm, after it cooled I sat it, still in the pan, bottom covered in foil on a bed of ice. It set well in a short period of time. I added the ganache just before seating so it too was set by the time it was needed.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I substituted 1/2 the whipping cream in both the filling and the glaze with Bailey's Irish Cream to give it an extra kick (so 3/4 cup whipping cream and 3/4 cup Bailey's in filling and 1/4 cup each for glaze). Worked like a charm. Enjoy!

This was easy. I used high quality chocolate. Began cooking it at 11. It was quite chilled by 6 pm. It cooked up beautifully. No glaze was necessary. I served it with fresh whip cream and raspberries. Everyone rolled their eyes and wanted more.

OMG, this was SO good! I followed the recipie exactly, except that I discovered I only had two eggs instead of three after I started-- didn't matter--it was still fantastic! I did just what it said-- putting it in the oven and then turning it off and leaving it in there for 40 minutes, and it didn't crack or anything. The only other thing I changed was that I put a pan of water on the rack underneath the cheesecake--I was worried about leakage. Great cheesecake--everyone loved it!

This was a great cheesecake. I used the turkey bag idea as well and it came out perfectly. Thank you for the tip. I used Paul Newman's Chocolate Alphabet Cookies for the crust and Giradelli Chocolate for the cake. I made the chocolate ganache and it worked great to cover up the tiny little cracks. The finished product did look like something I purchased at a bakery. I was going to put additional crumbs or nuts on the side but once I took the cake out of the pan it was so beautiful without it. Thanks for this great recipe!

This was great! I was really worried about getting water in it so, I just put the spring-form pan in a turkey bag and rolled the sides down then placed that in the water bath. It worked perfectly!

Rating: 4
This is a great cheesecake to make for company and is easy to make. I have made it 5 or more times and it always turns out great and impresses the guests. Sometimes I take the cheesecake out of the pan and drizzle the chocolate ganache over the top and sometimes put it on top when the springform pan is still on. I have used chopped and toasted pecans, hazelnuts or almonds to garnish. My best advise is to use the best chocolate possible. My mother in law loves this cheesecake!

I've made this numerous times now. The last time I made it one of my guests said, "This is so good, I don't want to swallow it.". Make sure you refrigerate for 24 hours - makes a huge difference. The Ganache is NOT needed.

Everytime I make this it turns out great and the crowd LOVES it! Careful not to pour too much water into the baking dish. It will leak into the springform pan.

I must have read this originally in the 1997 Bon Appetit magazine. I've been making this recipe for appreciative audiences since then! This is one of my all-time favorite desserts. It's very rich and is good served with a side of chocolate whipped cream to lighten it up.

I haven't made this yet. I plan to make it this weekend for my husbands birthday. All the other reipes for cheesecakes call for three to four packs of cream cheese. This one only calls for two. I am asssuming that's right because no one has said otherwise, but I just wanted to make sure before I get started.

One word...Amazing! Made this for my husband's birthday and it was just fabulous. Couldn't find chocolate wafer cookies, so used Nilla Wafers and 3 T cocoa powder. Omitted the instant coffee powder. Other than those two items, followed the recipe exactly. Used Ghirardelli 58% cacao gourmet baking chips. Will absolutely make this recipe again.

I had this recipe years ago. My family and friends loved it.I lost the recipe when I moved into my new house. I was devastated. I couldnt wait til I got the internet so I could try to find the recipe again. It is the best chocolate cheesecake you will ever have. It literally melts in your mouth. Trust me if you follow the directions to the T you will never go back to store bought again..If there was 10 forks I would give it a 10! Enjoy... Oh and thankyou epicurious for giving me my recipe back...

This is by far the best chocolate cheesecake recipe. I have made this cheesecake 5 times for guests and parties, and it tastes fabulous every single time. I did botch it the first time I made it. It fell apart and it still tasted amazing without it holding up. I have several friends who hate cheesecake, but they are very impressed and love to eat this cheesecake. You'll definitely enjoy it if you take the time to make it.

Rating: 4
This is my standby recipe--in fact I don't make any "modifications" when I do it! Make it the day BEFORE you want to serve it. Be sure your springform pan sealed tightly and that you use TWO layers of foil as described, or some water can seep into your cheesecake. That happened to me, but it actually was fine. RAVE REVIEWS from every party I've ever brought it to--and that is many!

Rating: 4
Flawless! I have made many cheesecakes and this one is very accommodating. The espresso powder is essential to heighten the chocolate flavor- does not become a 'mocha' cheesecake. Using some of the vanilla/cheese mix to marble is always a nice effect. A bain-marie alternative is to use a 13x9 glass dish full of boiling water on the next rack below. This allows for plenty of moisture and crack prevention without any threat of leakage. Enjoy!

i made this for thanksgiving and it was a total hit. even my boyfriend who hates cheesecake has had several pieces. i didnt make the crust, as i had some graham cracker crust on hand, and it was fantastic. im going to make it again and this time put a layer of crushed butterfingers on top of the crust.

Rating: 4
I made three of these this month. Two for birthdays and one for a retirement party. I got rave reviews every time. I omit the coffee powder because we don't care for the mocha flavor. I also use 6 ounces of bittersweet chocolate in the glaze to make a wonderful ganache topping. It makes the cheesecake incredibly rich and decadent. Using good quality chocolate chips makes putting this together very easy.

Rating: 0
Excellent cheesecake just as the recipe is written. For a little pazzaz, I'll try a little amaretto extract to the chocolate glaze and maybe almonds or hazelnuts to the chocolate crust. I made it for my husband's birthday (he's a cheesecake and chocolate lover) and everyone devoured it.

Rating: 4
I just wanted to add another positive review. I made this for my father's birthday and it was a big hit. Cooked perfectly with no cracks, not too sweet, and a great way to use some high quality bittersweet and dark chocolate (which is what I did). Great flavor and I didn't bother with the glaze. Mine was definitely very loose when I turned off the oven, but 45 minutes later, I opened the oven and it was perfectly done. I'll be making this one again!

Rating: 4
This cake was amazing. everyone loved it. I had to cook mine for 1 1/2 hours and was still hesitant about how loose it was but turned off the oven and prayed it would firm up. It did and it was wonderful. The only thing I changed is the crust. I already had crushed graham cracker so I made a regular graham crust instead of a chocolate wafer one. Next time I will definitely make the chocolate crust. The regular one did not do the cake justice.

Rating: 0
Wow! This recipe is amazing - possibly the best cheesecake I ever made! We had guests for dinner last night and one of our friends, who never likes anything, went crazy for this and had to have the recipe. I wouldn't change a thing. It was moist, delicious and it looked professional -possibly due to cooking it in the water bath. I am usually pretty critical but do not have one suggestion on how to make this better. This is a real winner.

This is easily one of my favorite cheesecake recipes. I don't use the glaze and I also don't bother with the water bath. It always comes out great. I have used mascarpone cheese instead of regular cream cheese for a smoother cake.

If you'd rather not deal with the glaze, don't bother...it won't affect how good this thing is. One little adjustment I made that I loved....instead of using instant coffee grounds (ugh!), I used finely ground coffee...basically ground on espresso setting. Gave it a nice coffee underflavor.

aie3 from Larkspur... You have to use the extra large heavy duty duty foil. Put some slices of bread in your spring form pan and practice wrapping it, putting it in a roasting pan and adding water to the roasting pan until your bread is dry twice in a row. Think "tulip". You can master this skill. As for the cheesecake, heavenly! Sometimes I flavor the glaze with a liquor. Sambuca and Grand Marnier (not together) are my favorites thus far.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was sublime. All who tried it found it the answer to their chocolate dreams. Even the "pain in the neck" water bath was worth it, as the result was a perfect surface for the glaze. It actually serves about 14 since it is so rich, the slices should be small.

This is fabulous and turns out perfectly each time. I follow it to the letter. However, before I serve, I take chocolate sprinkles and "stick" them to the sides all the way around for presentation.

RAVE REVIEWS! Made as directed, but doubled the recipe and made two for two different events, and the recipe doubled beautifully! Everyone who tasted it said it was the most amazing chocolate cheesecake they had ever had! I added Bailey's to the glaze, and next time, I will try adding Cointreau or Chambord to the glaze! I will also use the extra-wide foil for wrapping the pan, as some water did seep in between the two layers of thinner foil and it was a tad bit messy getting the pan out from the foil (I think the wide foil won't let water seep in). ENJOY!

I love this cake and have followed the directions as written. How do others wrap the foil? what is the purpose of this step? keeping the water out from the top? the foil does not seem to seal the bottom

I have made this cheesecake at least a dozen times, following the recipe exctly as written.It has always received rave reviews from family and friiends. If you cook it in the water bath as directed for one hour, and turn off the the oven and let it sit for 45 minutes, the cheesecake will turn our perfectly. You really don't need to cook it longer than one hour. It is OK for the cheescaketo be a little jiggly in the center when you turn off the ovem. as. it will firm up as it sits overnight in the refrigerator. It is undoubtedly the best cheesecake I have ever tasted. A keeper!

WOW. This is an incredible chocolate cheesecake with perfect texture and just the right amount of sweetness. I used Ghirardelli chocolate for the filling and Newman's Own chocolate alphabet cookies for the crust and found it to be excellent. I baked it as recommended, in a water bath, but for 1 hour 15 minutes, then turned the oven off and left the cake in the oven for an additional hour and it was perfect with no cracks. I omitted the glaze which wasn't missed. This will be THE chocolate cheesecake recipe I will always use. There's no need to look further!

After carefully reading all reviews, I set out on a wedding cake adventure with this recipe. I multiplied everything by 5 to make a 3-tier wedding cake to serve 100. I made the following changes: no crust, no chocolate glaze on top, and used half Ghiradelli dark chocolate and half Nestle semisweet chocolate. After frosting the cake with the Cake Bible (Berenbaum) recipe for white chocolate buttercream and decorating with piping and white roses, it was a fantastic hit. I plated the small slices of cake with 1 TBSP of raspberry puree suggested by another reviewer. I also recommend an extra 15 minutes, even with a convection oven. I am even more of a cheesecake lover after this experience, and can't encourage you strongly enough to TRY THIS RECIPE!! Good luck!

I made this for Christmas dinner using Baileys instead of the cream for the topping as someone here suggested and it was great. Definitely a chocolate lovers cheesecake. Let it cool in the oven as directed and it won't crack! Decorate the side of the cheesecake with a row of chocolate chips for a really nice presentation.

This is the best chocolate cheesecake I've ever tasted! Very easy. I used good chocolate and it really made a huge difference. I also took suggestions from others and made the crust from chocolate pirouette cookies and double chocolate brownie cookies. I actually think the crust was the best part. A huge success and definitely a keeper!

I made this cake, among more traditional pies, for a 50-person Thanksgiving dinner and it was the first dessert to disappear despite the fact that everyone was already stuffed. I followed Anne from Hamilton's advice and substituted 1/2 cup Bailey's for the cream and wowed everyone by calling it Chocolate Bailey's Cheesecake. I didn't read through the ingredients list thoroughly before starting and realized I had no coffee powder or sour cream so skipped the powder step and used another package cream cheese instead of sour cream. So it probably turned out a bit thicker but still worked beautifully. It baked for about 1 hour and 20 minutes. Three men asked for the recipe. Next year I'll make more than just one...

This is not my first cheesecake, although it was my first attempt at a chocolate one. I have always found cheesecake to be the dessert of kings (they could eat it after horse riding), and this one proves that statement even further. Bravo.

I made two of these for promotion parties at work... well known for my cheesecakes but these got RAVE reviews. Baked for 1 hour, 5 minutes. Topped one with layer of strawberry preserves before adding ganache. Also altered crust by mixing 8 chocolate covered grahams and about 1 1/2 cups pre-made brownies in food processor, pressing over bottom and up sides of springform pan. Will definitely make again and again!

Rating: 4
This is the best chocolate cheesecake recipe I've found. The filling texture appeals to a wide audience, since it's not New York-cheesecake dense but silkier than a mousse. If you dislike the monochromatic look of this dessert but don't plan to serve it with a sauce or fruit, set aside 1/4 of the batter before adding the chocolate, then swirl the plain filling into the chocolate in the pan. My guests are always amazed that this is homemade, even though I'm already considered a good cook!

Rating: 4
This recipe is great. I had another one that I swore by, lost and was looking for on the net and found this one. I baked it for an hour and 10 minutes and it worked perfectly. I also suggest not spreading the ganache but just pour it over the cake and tilt the pan to spread it because while it is warm it is runny enough to spread itself and then you get this perfectly smooth glossy finish to your cake. This recipe is going into my favorites!

This recipe is to die for! This was quite possibly the best chocolate cheesecake I've ever tasted. Following other people's suggestion, I baked the cake for 1 hour and 15 minutes, which yielded perfect results. I didn't have instant coffee on hand, but instead added a coffee liqueur. The crust was made from Newman's Own chocolate alphabet cookies, which created a crisp, deep chocolate base. The rest of the cheesecake was creamy, decadent and reminiscent of a mousse, although with more substance. I used Guittard which turned out beautifully, although the cheesecake would probably receive ten stars if Scharffen Berger or Valrhona were used. The glaze neither added nor detracted from the recipe. Next time I plan to try a very lightly sweetened dark chocolate glaze and to plate individual slices on raspberry sauce.

LOVED this recipe. I compared it to the Cordon Rose cheesecake in the Cake Bible and it's very similar, except some of the sour cream is replaced with the cream/coffee/chocolate mixture. I also baked it for 1 hr, 15 min as other reviewers suggested and the texture was fabulous. A variation I experimented with was to bake the cheesecake in a larger round pan (rectangular would be ideal but I don't have one) and cut it into small cubes and pour the chocolate glaze over them--kind of like petits fours. Great individual servings for a party.

I am doing this recipe an injustice probably by giving it just one fork. Though we ate about half of the cake, we all agreed that the filling was just way too thick - so dense it didn't feel like cheesecake at all. What did I do wrong?

This one is fool proof. Be sure to bake it in the water bath as directed - mine came out beautiful with no crack. This cake is very dense, rich and yet creamy. Excellent flavor.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it. It was rich and chocolatey--tasted just like it was from the Cheesecake Factory or a fancy bakery. It was my first time making a cheesecake, and I didn't have any trouble. All I had was an 8" springform pan, which worked out fine--I just had a little batter left over. The glaze was good, but messy, since it did not really set, even though I refrigerated it on the cake for 5 hours.

This is perfect for chocolate lovers, but it's not a very complex flavor. It's all about chocolate and texture, which is fine if that's what you're after. I use mascarpone instead of cream cheese for an even richer, smoother texture. The ganache didn't seem to add much. I'd skip it. Easy to make, fast, and foolproof.

I made this recipe exactly as follows and it came out perfect. It looked like it came from a bakery and it was delicious. Forget the topping unless it cracks, so you can cover them up. However, it is extremely rich. Give small pieces to everyone. Next time I will try the raspberry puree. Also, I used Ghiradelli Semi-sweet chocolate bars. Simply amazing!!

Nice recipe, it turns out just as you would expect. Its texture is a bit lighter than most cheesecakes since it uses sour cream and cornstarch.P> I topped this with half of the chocolate mousse pie recipe (http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/2687), which is very easy to make. Just pour the mousse on top after the cheesecake is slightly chilled.P>

This is absolutely the best cheesecake I have ever had! Everyone RAVES about it. I've made it with both semi-sweet and milk chocolate, and prefer it with the semi-sweet.

This cheesecake is lucious. I have made it several times with huge success. My brother has to be on a gluten-free diet so when he is with us I change to the crust to a nut crust using chopped nuts (almonds or macadamia), a little powder sugar and a little cocoa powder.

Oh my, was this a wonderful cheesecake (and I'm not even a cheesecake lover)!! Moist, delicious chocolate flavor that wasn't too sweet. I used crushed Oreos in place of the wafers. The cake was prepared the night before and was refrigerated overnight before the glaze was prepared and added. I left the cake in the refrigerator for 8 hours before removing from spring form pan.

Everywhere, I received nothing but the highest compliments from people who love cheesecake and love chocolate and even those who normally wouldn't care for cheesecake.

I was looking to knock the socks off of my chocolate-loving friend, and I definitely succeeded with this recipe! This is one of those desserts where you have to just close your eyes and revel in the moment after that initial bite.

Next time I would try it with a little less sugar and half and half instead of heavy whipping cream.

This cheesecake's taste and texture were beyond compare. It was smooth and creamy, rich yet not too dense. The crust turned out perfectly, and the ganache was an exquisite finishing touch. It made a beautiful presentation for my buffet-style party with a bowl of freshly whipped cream. I too cooked it an additional 15 minutes and used Callebaut chocolate. An interesting side note: it freezes exceptionally well. I baked the crust and filling, then chilled and froze the cake. A week later, I defrosted it in the refrigerator and added the ganache the night before serving. Easy, fabulous, delightful. Four forks, hands down!

This was the BEST cheesecake that I have had in a very long time. My hubby was impressed with this as well. Simple and easy to make. I only made 2 changes I used Kaluha instead of the coffee powder and the vanilla. I found that using Scharffen berger chocolate (1/2 semisweet and 1/2 bittersweet) gave it awsome flavor. If you are at a higher altitude(i am at 7000ft) also add 1TBSP of flour, let cook about 10 min. longer than what it calls for. YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!!!

For my taste, it would have been a 1-fork food, but my mom who loves chocolate loves it, so it gets 2 forks. For me, it was WAY to chocolate-y. I would name it "Double Chocolate Dessert" since I couldn't really taste the cheesecake part at all. I guess my thought of a chocolate cheesecake was different, hopefully I'll have better luck next time! The presentation however, looks absolutely beautiful!

Excellent! I do not consider myself a baker, but this simple recipe makes it look as if I am. It will remain a part of my repertoire. I did pay attention to reviews and bake for about 10 minutes longer. I might go 1h 15m/20m next time as it was a teeny bit soft in the middle. Do NOT skip the ganache on top. It makes the cake!

The texture of this cheesecake was just perfect! it's not only very chocolate-y, but very creamy as well! Not one of those heavy, stiff-textured cheesecakes. All the guests at my dinner party enjoyed it. It was brought to us by a friend of ours..the perfect end to a delicious meal with friends!

I made this for my 6 year old daughter's birthday (cheesecake is her favorite), and everyone from grandmother to godmother to each of the thirteen 6 year old guests ate it up. More than one mother said it was the best children's birthday cake they had ever had.

my crust was gooey, but i'm new to cheesecake-baking so it could only be my fault. this was my first time using a water bath, maybe it leaked? (any hints?) plus it seemed odd not to bake the crust 1st. but the cake part, oh la la!

This is a very good, rich chocolate cheesecake. I have been using choc graham crackers for the crust - very good. Also - I made a raspberry sauce to go with it - delicious. 1 pkg froz raspberries - defrosted - pureed with 1/2 cup sugar in blender - then press through sieve to remove seeds. And I used a high fluted tart pan to make a prettier looking cheesecake.

I am not a cheesecake person, but I made this for people who were, and it got devoured. I brought it to an event where there was a variety of other desserts. Most were still untouched while only half of this remained. It was pretty easy to make, but it did take about 20 minutes longer to be done.

I was delighted to find this chocolate recipe so much like my plain cheesecake. Here's a tip for preventing the cake from cracking as it cools. Slide a thin knife around the edge immediately after removing from the oven and let it cool in the pan. It will make for a picture perfect cheesecake.

This is the ABSOLUTE for chocolate lovers and is fairly easy to make. It is delicious and VERY rich - it even converted some of those not-so-hot for cheescake people. I topped with fresh raspberries and powdered sugar with raspberry sauce for the side. Everyone thought it was store bought - it's that impressive! Enjoy!

Best chocolate cheesecake ever. Followed the recipe ingredients exactly. Everyone loved it. Not too sweet, but very, very rich. Need only little slices. After an hour in the oven, it was still very loose, so I baked for an additional 15 minutes, and let it sit in the oven for 45 more minutes as per instructions, and it came out perfect. After pouring on the glaze and refrigerating for 20 minutes, I added shaved chocolate curls around the top edge, chilled for another 2 hours and unmolded. Absolutely beautiful!

I've made this cheesecake about 3 times now, and it just gets better every time! Like many others I couldn't find the chocolate cookies, so I tried using Keebler Double Fudge and Caramel cookies instead. All you have to do is warm them up a bit and crumble them into the bottom of the pan, no butter needed. As for the glaze, I just add a tablespoon or so of raspberry liquor.

Rating: 3
I thought this cheesecake was delicious, but I found the consistency to be more of a chocolate moose cake than a cheesecake. I went to four different markets and was unable to find the chocolate wafers - very frustrating. I used chocolate graham crackers (not chocolate covered, but chocolate in the cracker itself) instead and it worked out fine. Everyone loved the cake

I plan on making this recipe tomorrow and I read in the comments about the bain marie. First of all what is it? Second I don't see it in the recipe so do I need to add it. Thanks and I can't wait to make it.

The chocolate wafer cookies called for are made by Nabisco and are called "NABISCO FAMOUS CHOCOLATE WAFERS" and are hard to find....I've found many supermarkets have them where they display ice cream toppings....these cookies are VERY dark chocolate and thin....if you can't find them you could substitute Oreo's, but I would definitely NOT use chocolate covered grahams or any thing else chocolate covered

Rating: 4
Wow, this is an amazing recipe! Instead of 12 oz. of semi-sweet, I used 2 oz. unsweetened and about 10 oz. of semi-sweet after reading some reviews! FABULOUS! I also changed the ganache topping by adding seedless raspberry jam to it. I heated 1/3 C. seedless raspberry jam, 1/3 C. heavy cream and a little more than 6 oz. semi-sweet, it REALLY worked out well! I will make this over and over and over again.

Great cheesecake. I made it for a friend who loves chocolate. Just a note to those you mentioned they could not find chocolate covered wafers. The recipe does not call for chocolate covered wafers .. but simply chocolate wafers which are available at most all supermakets. They come in a box a look like thin chocolate cookies (wafers) and many times are near the baking section rather than by the cookies.

Rating: 4
excellent taste, but i made the mistake of using 2 cups of whipping cream instead of the advised 1.5--but it made the consistency nicely un-cheescake like. The cake was smooth, almost like a mousse, and the glaze added much. i used bittersweet instead of semisweet chocolate and it turned out fine.

THIS IS THE THIRD TIME I HAVE MADE THIS CHEESECAKE. AS A PERSONAL CHEF I AM CONSTANTLY TRYING AND TESTING RECIEPES. I PERSONAL DO NOT LIKE CHEESECAKE BUT AS THEY SAY, THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS TO EVERY RULE! I LOVED IT! I WAS HIRED FOR A PRIVATE DINNER PARTY LAST EVENING AND PLATED THE CAKE ON A RASPBERRY SAUCE WITH MINT LEAVES, FRESH RASBERRIES AND A DUSTING OF POWDER SUGAR. IT LOOKED AS GOOD AS IT TASTED! I WOULD RATHER COOK THAN BAKE ANY DAY BUT THIS WAS A BREEZE TO MAKE. A KEEPER IN MY RECIPE BOX FOREVER!

Yummmmmmmm.... Beware, though, you really DO need to make it the day before. I made it in the morning, and that night it was so-so. Not bad, but nothing to rave about. The leftovers the next day, however, were fantastic! Rich, creamy, and a wonderful chocolate flavor.

Rating: 4
This is a fantastic recipe and quite easy to prepare. Like one other reviewer, I could not find chocolate covered wafers, but chocolate covered graham crackers are easy to find. But then use at least one tablespoon butter. Otherwise it just leaks out the bottome and makes the crust too hard. Guests rave. Forks and plates are licked spotlessly clean. If you are going to indulge yourself, make it worth it and do it right. This is the WAY!

Food of the gods - what can I say?!? I've made this cheesecake twice. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, the second time I skipped the bain marie and added some Kahlua to the batter and to the glaze. The Kahlua was a worthy addition but I wouldn't skip the bain marie next time. It tasted great but broke up a little when I sliced it. I also added a tablespoon of flour to compensate for the altitude (7,000 ft.) It worked.

I made this special cheesecake for Christmas Day dessert. It was a big hit - even those that don't consider themselves chocoholics raved about it. I had trouble finding the chocolate wafer cookies and substituted chocolate graham crackers, instead. I found I had to add a little extra butter to make the crust stick together. Otherwise, the recipe was very easy to follow, although somewhat time-consuming. While rich, I did not find the cheesecake to be too "chocolaty" but just right. The texture was perfect and the cake removed easily from the pan. Once decorate, it looked like something off the cover of Bon Appetit!

Very, very good. Very chocolatey. I have made it several times already, and everyone raves. Used Oreo cookies for the crust -- works very well. I also incorporated part of the chocolate mixture into the cheese mixture, poured it into the pan and then drizzled the rest of chocolate mixture on top and swirled with a knife. Beautiful! Oh, I don't have a bain marie, so I went without -- no problems -- didn't crack or burn.

I had to make a dessert for my husbands Xmas party so I made this one. I made two cakes, one for us and as a sample and then the one for the party. It was a COMPLETE SMASH...they loved it. We loved it. It was easy enough to make but time comsuming. I used chocolate graham cookies instead of the wafers and I added Kahlua to the mix. People could rave about it enough. It looked beyond spectacular and I did a few cherrys to make it festive. This is a sure fire hit for any party. I will keep this recipe as my own.

I made this for an office party, & the response was really gratifying -- I am now given credit for far greater culinary skills than I actually possess. I was nervous about sacrificing a my prized cache of dark European chocolate to the project, but it made all the difference. The cake looked far from done after 1 hour in the oven, so I baked it for an additional half hour. The bain marie prevented the crust from burning, and extra baking time really firmed up the interior -- no cheesecake has ever sliced so easily for me. Served with a dollop of whipped cream & a dainty cookie, it made an impressive presentation. Definitely a keeper!

I was raised in The Land of Cheesecakes (New York) and I am routinely disappointed both in restaurants and home-made cheesecakes ..... BUT my girlfriend, Claudia, made this for me and, as picky as I am about cheesecakes, this one is nothing short of DELICIOUS !

I have to say that I thought the cake was much too rich and sickeningly sweet. I used unsweetened chocolate to prepare the glaze thinking that it would balance out the cake's sweetness but that did not help. Also I followed the baking instructions (1 hour with the oven on; 45 min in the oven with the oven off) and it seemed like the middle was not really cooked at all. When I served it, the middle was kind of runny. All in all, I was disappointed with this recipe.

Great... made it for a friend's Birthday at work. Wanted something special... this fit the bill. Many complements. Used espresso coffee ~ 2T. as I was out of espresso powder amd used amaretto... very good. Small slices make it doab;e without over-indulging.

I baked this cheescake for a friend's birthday, and it was the hit of the party. People are still talking about it 6 months later! Everytime they see me coming, they ask, "any more of that cheesecake?" After reading the reviews, I decided to skip the glaze, and I'm glad. I think the glaze would suit only the most diehard chocoholics.

12/30/99 - A Cook From Ohio - This is the third time I have made this recipe. I can't tell you how much people have enjoyed it. Yes, it is VERY rich. I would recommend making a raspberry sauce to accompany it. I defrosted a bag of frozen raspberries, pureed in blender and then strained the seeds out. I then added 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons of Chambord. I drizzled the raspberry mixture on the plate, put a thin slice of the cake on top and then added fresh raspberries around the edge. It was gorgeous! Not bad for someone who always bought dessert for my dinner parties at a bakery!

This is an exceptionally decadent cheesecake. I made it for a Xmas buffet so I decided to top it with cranberries poached in a sugar syrup. Thank goodness I did becasue without the tartness of the berries to offset the richness of the cake, I don't think I could have eaten more than 3 bites!!! I would never make this with a chocolate glaze. A word of warning -when baking it I was very nervous turning off the heat after an hour - the cake was just barely set. But it turned out great.

I made this cheesecake for a party and everyone loved it! They thought it had come from a bakery. This is definiately for the chocolate lover, though. The next time I make this I will reduce the chocolate by a couple of ounces. I love chocolate but could not finish my small piece. Also next time I will serve it with a raspberry puree or something like that to help contrast the chocolate. This is an awesome cheesecake and looks very impressive!

I have made this twice now, and it's just perfect! I'm not a big cheescake person, but I love it and everyone I've served it to has liked it also. Just one tip: let the cheesecake age for at least three days before serving. It makes it taste even better. Mmmmm-mmmm good!
