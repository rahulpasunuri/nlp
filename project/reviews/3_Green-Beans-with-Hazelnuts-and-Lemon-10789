i have made this several times and have always used pine nuts (either raw or roasted) which i really like because they are more subtle but add good crunch. this is one of the few vege dishes that my 4 year old will eat. love the lemon!

The dish is a very nice light accompaniment to a rich, flavorful Thanksgiving meal. It offsets the mounds of butter that is incorporated into the other side dishes. But make sure to add salt and pepper for seasoning because it makes all the difference!

This recipe is good, not great but as accompaniment you don't need great. I thought the lemon was subtle but overall the recipe was a little on the bland side. I used Trader Joe's frozen green beans - they are sooo easy and good if you prepare them right.

This is a good choice for a pot luck. The flavor is good, but fairly subtle, so that it goes well with a variety of other dishes. I prepared it in advance and reheated it in the microwave, as recommended, and that worked well.

I agree with one of the previous cooks. I made this recipe but didn't like it either. The combination of flavors made it taste odd.

This dish was a hit with me, the cook, and my very critical family. Followed the recipe as recommended, made the day before and reheated in the microwave at dinner time. I will definately make this again. Bon Appetit!

Everyone liked these beans but I didn't care for them and I was the cook!

Delicious and easy, will definitely make for the holidays...used macadamia nuts(didn't feel like peeling hazlenuts) and substituted half the amount of oil with hazelnut oil. Prepared the day before and reheated in the oven and they were yummy!

I can't believe how good these beans are. Everytime I make them, my family raves. Sometimes, I leave out the hazelnuts or substitute almonds.

These are beautiful beans with the bright lemon zest and light olive oil glow. They are also wonderfully simple to prepare. I left the beans whole and made this recipe on Christmas Eve to be served the following day. Heated for 20 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees uncovered,the beans were perfect and crisp. I substituted chopped roasted chestnuts for the hazelnuts. Everyone raved!

I scaled this recipe down a bit- just my husband and I were eating. I also used almonds instead of Hazelnuts, because that was what I had open. It was a delicious blend of flavors and VERY easy to make! A definate keeper!

Light, refreshing, and delicious! Cleaning and snapping the beans turned into a wonderful family time, since everyone chipped in to help. The beans are even better, cold, this morning!

Quick and Yummy. Any kind of toasted nuts would be good, so use whatever is on hand.

These were the best green beans I have ever eaten. I actually cooked the beens in my steemer at a friends house on thanksgiving. This was a great way not to get in her way at the stove.

A beautiful and tasty side dish. The hazelnuts and lemon zest add a wonderful, light touch. I've made it two Thanksgivings in a row.
