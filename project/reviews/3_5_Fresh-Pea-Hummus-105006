This was okay, not anything outstanding. My guests said they liked it but there was still a whole lot left at the end of my party....

Made this for the first time as a pre-Easter hors d'oeuvres. I was looking for something fresh and Spring-y to put out. It was very well received and my husband and I can also recommend it as a yummy spread when making a sandwich of leftovers. I used a bag of frozen peas, and after reading the other reviews, decreased the tahini to a heaping tablespoon, and increased the lemon juice to the juice of one whole lemon - probably worked out to nearly 1/4 cup. I didn't put in all the lemon juice at once, but added for taste and texture as I went. Honestly, I think this is one of the best things you can do with a bag of frozen peas. It was so easy and extremely tasty. This will be a new go-to party dish for me.

Super easy to throw together. It has become my staple for when friends are coming over for drinks or taking by parties (sometimes by request). Nice and light, and especially good when fresh peas are in season, although you do need a lot of them and it adds a fair bit of time to the prep. Definitely needs more liquid than specified, and I tend to do the balance of tahini and lemon juice by taste now.

After some experimenting, I quite liked this very green hummus, particularly as a dip for slices of red pepper. I only used 1 tablespoon of tahini the second time I made it, and that was much better. Also need to add a couple tablespoons of water (and yes, extra lemon juice) to smooth it out. It's lighter than a hummus made with olive oil and chickpeas, and is a great way to empty the freezer of bags of frozen peas!

This fresh hummus was good. Beware that you need to add much more lemon juice than the recipe suggests. HOWEVER, the usual hummus recipe with some herbs would beat this one.
