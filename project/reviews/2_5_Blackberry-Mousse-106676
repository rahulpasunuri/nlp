Uggggh. Though this mousse has a gorgeous, vibrant color, it is really not very good. The orange taste from the zest, juice, and Grand Marnier overpowers the flavor of the blackberries. Because I like mousse to be smooth, I pureed the orange-blackberry mixture and then pushed it through a fine sieve. This resulted in an okay texture, but the taste of the mousse is just not "smooth", which was a disappointment. (However, my father did enjoy the leftovers for breakfast! To each his own...)

We made this for a Christmas desert contest and WON! It tastes wonderful and is very easy to make. One suggestion, the consistency is better if you make it a day ahead of time. All of my relatives have asked for the recipe.
