absolutely delicious, made as written. Dense but still moist, and the flavor was even better the next day

Looked great, tasted terrible. Not quite sure how to fix it. Maybe thinner crust, 10x14 pan, with 1/2 cup jelly?? I'll stick with Linzer torte next time

Everyone raved about this torte. I used two eight inch springform cake pans and made two thin layers to assemble. It was beautiful and delicious.
