This is quite an easy dish to prepare and very delicious. Good enough for company or a regular weekday meal. I halved the amount of mustard because my hubby isn't a huge fan, and it was still quite good. This is definitely going into my roster of favorite meals.

resulted in a very acidic and bitter sauce. probably needed a little cream to soften the flavors. better veal recipes out there.

A family as well as a company favorite. The recipe is not labor intensive, easy to make and and always well received!

i have tried this recipe now three times. each time was wonderful and received high praise. The sauce has enough character to blend with pork tenderloin. the wine was also varied to include sherry and marsala. obviously, one has to enjoy onions, but this is a bell-ringer for our guests!

The sauce turned out quite acidic--being a beginner, I couldn't work out because of too much mustard or too much wine.
