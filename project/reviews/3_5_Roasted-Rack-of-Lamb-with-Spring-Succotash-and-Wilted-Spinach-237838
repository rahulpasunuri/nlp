I love rack of lamb, but as one of the other reviewers said, 25 minutes at 350 was not enough time. I like my lamb medium, but at 25 minutes, it was just rare. I didn't make the succotash.

I wonder why more people haven't tried this. I never made rack of lamb before. The marinade was delicious but the lamb just wasn't cooking. I wound up leaving it in for an additional 15 minutes and it was still really bloody. But tasty. The lamb was so pricey I don't know if I'll make this again in the near future. The succotash is delicious but I didn't quite understand the potato thing at the beginning so I didn't saute them long enough and they were mushy, but it didn't matter. Also, it comes out really really liquidy at the end, which I drained off with a slotted spoon. Not sure why the recipe doesn't mention this. And you definitely don't need all that butter, I used about 1 tbsp. The spinach is optional. I served with buttermilk biscuits and garlic mashed potatoes (I mistook the ricotta for the sour cream and what a surprise, it turned out pretty good.)

DELICIOUS! I had to use frozen corn and frozen black eyed peas because it's winter and I couldn't find fresh in the markets. To compensate, I added the corn/peas a few minutes later than otherwise required in the recipe. Also, though I cooked the rack in the oven, Cooks Illustrated recommended charcoal. I'd probably agree. That said, even in the oven, this recipe is a real show stopper.

I loved the succotash, i replaced the lamb with braised short ribs. i also added some kidney beans to go along with the black beans.I also found that you can make a fairly big batch of the succotash and freeze it for up to a month or so. just make sure that the succotash is drained of all liquid before freezing.
