This recipe is excellent just as it is written. I was in the sheep business. When someone told me they didn't like lamb, I used this recipe to convert them. Worked each time.

I made this for Easter supper, and it was a hit. I didn't have the red pepper or the plum tomatoes, but they weren't missed. An earlier reviewer was dissatisfied with the flavor, but I thought this recipe highlighted the lamb's flavor. I also roasted the vegetables with the lamb. This was a wonderful dish, and we are planning to have it again next Easter!

I adjusted this into a really simple recipe. I quartered some potatoes, carrots and whole plum tomatoes, 3 garlic cloves and threw them into a Le Creuset pot. Didn't have any onions or shallots and the mixed vegetables. Put in olive oil, rosemary, thyme, oregano, salt and pepper, and Mrs. Dash seasoning. I then rubbed a 954gr (2lb) roast of lamb with olive oil and Mrs. Dash and then put into the oven with the lid on. Roasted at 375 deg for 90 minutes. Everything was very tasty, moist and the vegetables didn't disintegrate. Produced enough juice to make a gravy. For the next time, I would add the mixed vegetables to the pot after 60 minutes of cooking. Yum, Yum.

I was looking for a vegetable to go with another lamb recipe so I made just the mixed baby vegetables because they sounded interesting and could be prepared ahead. The flavor was very bland. I roasted the pearl onions in the oven and they added the most flavor. I will try this combination of vegies again and add more herbs.
