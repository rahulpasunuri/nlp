I love this recipe - I can't understand why some people are having such issues making this. The caramel is absolutely amazing - maybe that's the problem? You need to be able to prepare the caramel correctly - if done right, it has that slightly golden/burnt caramel taste that I just love! coupled with chocolate (choose your favourite type of choc for this recipe) and bananas/graham cracker crust + cream it's a total winner! I've been making this pie for years now and always loved by anyone who's tried it!

Yep, this is a very rich pie but I didn't have some of the issues others had. I mixed the choc chips with mini chips and smoothed them out a bit as soon as they started melting in the hot caramel. Oddly, I didn't think there was enough caramel so I would increase the caramel and reduce the whipped cream - just put dollops of whipped cream on it instead of spreading it all over.

This dessert just didn't appeal to me. It's gooey, and seems to me to be the kind of thing that would be on the cover of Good Housekeeping. I won't make again.

This recipe has great promise, but I completely agree with others' reviews that it is way too sweet. For my taste, if slightly less caramel was used and a layer of MELTED bittersweet chocolate (NOT semisweet chocolate chips) was poured over the top of the caramel, it would be a much better pie. The reason I recommend melted chocolate, instead of chips, is that the chips are rather jarring to encounter in the caramel layer and a more melded taste sensation would be nicer.

I have made this pie several times. I have changed nothing in the recipe. The caramel is quite soft, but hardens somewhat when refrigerated. For those who had it too hard, perhaps it was cooked too long? I get rave reviews from chocolate lovers, non-chocolate lovers, kids and adults. It is marvelous.

This was a great dessert! It was very sweet, so I suggest serving small pieces, but wow- it's delicious. Everyone LOVED it . Tastes great & makes a beautiful presentation!

This pie was VERY sweet. Kids would definately love it, but it was a little cloying for adults. I think the chocolate was overkill. But I did have many people say it was delicious, so I gave it a 3.

This pie has become a Thanksgiving favorite for us. We LOVE it. I don't understand why the recipe isn't working for some people.

What did I do wrong??? The pie was so hard we could have used it for a frisbee and no way could it be cut. We scooped out the inside and had bananas and whipped cream. I was so disappointed because I made it for a dinner party. Luckily I also made my mother-in-law's apple pie recipe and that was good and cut-able.

Not one of my favourites. Far too sweet for our taste. We had this following the Roast Garlic and Parmesan Soup (yum) and a fabulous standing rib roast done to perfection on the BBQ (lid down) with a peppercorn cream brandy sauce. In hindsight, we should have had a simple cheese and fruit plate to finish an otherwise delicious dinner.

My dinner guests and I truly enjoyed this rich and delicious pie. Be advised that if you are in a hurry, this is not a dessert that can be rushed. Making the caramel was not difficult, but it takes time. Although purists may not like this substitution, in a pinch one and a half cups of purchased caramel dessert topping could be warmed and poured into pie shell. That would really cut down on the time. I also would use a bit more whipped cream, perhaps another 1/4 to 1/3 cup and adjust the confectioner's sugar to taste. The crust was easy and came out of the pan perfectly - no broken bits!

This is my definitive eyes-roll-back-in-your-head dessert. Make certain your guests are sweet people. It's the dessert to end all desserts.

I have made this pie quite a few times for parties, and was told that it was such a wonderful blend of flavors. As for Chef Jeff from LA who thought obviously that the recipe was wrong ~ Well... he happens to be the one who is wrong. I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out perfect every time. As a matter of fact, I am making it for one of my desserts tomorrow for Super Bowl. Try it again, Chef Jeff!

Being a big fan of bananas, I have fell in love with this recipe. I have made it several times for guests and I have always received rave reviews. The recipe takes time, but it is time well spent. Everyone should try it!!!!

I'm a stickler for accuracy, and perhaps there was a mistake in the recipe. When the recipe said to boil the caramel mixture to 210 on a candy thermometer, I did just that. The finished caramel that went into the shell, was nothing more than sauce. The caramel mixture should have obviously boiled to a soft or firm ball stage.
