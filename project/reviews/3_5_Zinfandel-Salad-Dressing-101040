I was looking for a recipe to use some white zinfandel that someone brought to me. (It's not my kind of wine for drinking) . Clearly the flavors of this dressing are bold. Too bold for a white zin. I cooked the garlic and only used the green tops of the onion, and used greek yoghurt instead of mayo. I'm not sure it's fair to review the recipe since I made so many changes. But it was so good. I had to share.

My dinner guest voted this the best dressing out of the 3 I did. I used La Crema Pinot Noir and called it "La Crema Dressing". Very good. Always make dressing 1 day in advance. The flavors are more enhanced!

seriously, yuck. It tasted like I had added a bunch of mayo to a vinaigrette. None of the nuances of the Zin could show through (mid-price bottle). Tried again backing off on the vinegar, but then it just tasted like Mayo. Nice concept, poor execution. I will not make this again

Super-tasty, but next time I'll try to experiment a bit to reduce the fat content...

one of my favorites, food processor works well for prep...

Terrific! The flavors are very layered and full flavored. I did use Zin and I also added 3 cloves of garlic - it's zippy and zingy and simply delish. I'm making it again tonight for veggies & dip for a dozen friends.

Really good! I used Cabernet wine and half the garlic. This is my new favorite!

We love this dressing in our house. When I read the review about it being good enough to drink, I laughed. My daughter, who is 5 and a very picky eater, literally licks her plate clean. It is a pretty strong dressing, so I tend to use it primarily with butter lettuce rather than other lettuces than can be on the bitter side. It's a nice change from a vinagrette.

WOW! I could drink this stuff, it is so delicious. Served it on a simple salad of arugula, thinly sliced green onion and chunks of fresh orange segments. I had some Four Vines Sophisticate left over from a few days ago, so I used that. Subbed unseasoned rice wine vinegar for the wine vinegar, and red onion for the green onions. This is a salad dressing to make, put in a fancy bottle or jar, and take as a hostess gift. This will be a Christmas gift for my foodie friends this year! This dressing is so good, you'll want to lick the plate clean!

This is a great and easy salad dressing to make. I used Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. The result was a richer dressing that went better with the wines I was serving at dinner.

In my house there IS no such thing as too much garlic (although I didn't find it to be extra garlicky at all)! Didn't change a thing and this is the kind of dressing I will make again and again. Wonderful combination of flavors! KIMBER

I listened to the other reviewers, added more wine and less mayo. Still, I thought the dressing was so garlicky it was overwhelming. The zinfandel wine and vinegar didn't even peep through. I might try it again, with only one clove of garlic.

I made this dressing for company and they loved it. I took the previous reviewers' suggestions and used a little less mayo, added a little cream and used a little more wine. Looks nice served in a decorative bottle.

Delicious! This recipe is great on any salad and will add a great garlicky pizzazz. I use it all the time and everyone just raves about my salads.

I thought this recipe was great!! I did not use as much mayonaise as the recipe called for which made the dressing slightly more garlicky. I loved it.
