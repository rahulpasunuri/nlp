This was awesome! Followed the recipe, used the ginger in the tube and the blender got the consistency perfect. This is about as close as you're going to get without being in the restaurant kitchen

Glad I found it!! I actually got this recipe out of the big Gourmet cookbook and it is fabulous. I added an extra tablespoon of rice vinegar and two extra tablespoons of water. Don't skip the blender step it makes the dressing sorta creamy. I used this as a dip for cut up veggies and it was a huge hit.

I didn't like the way this recipe turned out. I am spoiled--the dressing at my favorite sushi restaurant is amazing. I had hoped that epicurious would come through for me on this one, but the flavor was definitely missing something. I'll tinker around with it some more, but as is, I am not a huge fan of this dressing.

I have wanted a ginger dressing recipe that compares to my favorite sushi restaurant for a long time. I've found it! I'm so excited! This was delicious and I've recommended it to friends. I skipped the blender step and just left it in the food processor a little longer. It turned out "smooth" enough for me, and even smoother than the dressing at my favorite restaurant. I also used that new ginger-in-a-tube stuff that you can find in the produce section. This recipe requires almost the entire tube. It turned out great, but I'm going to try it with whole ginger next time since I just throw it in the food processor anyway (grating ginger is such a hassle). I used regular, unseasoned rice vinegar and vegetable oil because that's what I had on hand. I will make this recipe again and again.

We loved this. I didn't add the water & skipped the blender part, though I think the texture would have been improved had I done that step. The flavors were well balanced. Will most definitely make this again.

Yummy, apple cidar vinegar makes even better pairing with the carrots and ginger.

Tastes like the dressing for which I've been trying to locate a recipe.

My mother had a lot of cabbage in her garden that she passed along to me, so I thought I'd try this dressing on it. It turned out OK--perhaps it would have been better with iceberg. Anyone who tries this dressing needs to love carrots because they are by far the dominant flavor.

Using only the ingredients listed in the recipe and using only a processor procuced an interesting dressing. The flavors blend together and equalize nicely. Next time I probably will try with tahini to see if it inproves the original.

Those of who who want it creamier, add mayo at the end and whiz again. Holding it overnight in the fridge helped the texture, too.

LOVED IT! Didn't use the processor, blender worked fine. Very easy to make and this will be my standard dressing on salads from now on.

Easy to make, and tastes like the salad dressing at my favorite japanese restaurant. I cut down on the oil to make it healthier and thinned it out with water and a bit more rice vinegar. Very tasty

This was as close to my favorite sushi restaurant's dressing as I could imagine! It's great. I didn't put it in the blender afterwards, so I can't assess how it would be then. Straight from the food processor it was a little grainy, but the taste couldn't be beat!

The first time this site has really let me down. I've made better versions of this dressing on my own, but figured I would give the recipie a try. The result is far too sour - Too much vinegar. If you want to use this recipie as a guide use 1/8 cup vinegar and 1/8 cup orange juice. Also a couple of tbs. of tahini paste can replace the sesame oil for a fresher taste. As mentioned in another review- why on earth start it in the food processor and then move to the blender? Just throw everything in the blender for the same results with less cleanup.

I think this is a wonderful recipe- comprable to the ginger dressings served in restaurants. I did take the advice of adding only have the carrots and then I made my iumprovisions. I skipped the shallots (wasn't on hand) and added extra ginger in place with a little honey and wasabi for a kick. I skipped the food processor, I hate washing dishes, and put the whole thing in the blender. It's fabulous! :)

My husband and I thought this dressing was awful. It had too many carrots in it and the texture was too thick. I tried several times to cut it before I threw it out. I'm still looking for the "restaurant" version.

This is the teppanyaki restaurant salad dressing that I've been looking for for years with a more refined texture. If you like your dressing creamy, definitely whiz it in the blender before serving. This was made to go on ice-cold iceberg lettuce for an asian touch. It's really good!

Perfct with Iceburg lettuce. A great Asian dressing that's simple and tasty!
