Unique, but quite a lot of work. The tart never quite set and was too sweet and gooey. The hazelnuts were good. The ice cream, however, was exceptional. Even so, it took two days to make the whole thing, and it was just too complicated to make again.

I wish this was reviewed more, it deserves to be! Extremely tasty, and easy to boot. I had almonds on hand so I used those, and honestly I think hazelnuts would have been too nutella-y so I'd suggest using almonds. Also I used half n half instead of cream for the ice cream, just as creamy and less fat! Delicious :)

Made this ice cream for Christmas gifts - it was excellent! Followed the instructions for the ice cream as provided, then gave it with candied nuts instead of the tart. Every one was skeptical when they heard what it was -- and then pleasantly surprised with their first bite!

I have to admit, although I thought this recipe looked intriguing, I was worried about the different parts of it as I made it. The tart seemed... overly simplistic and uninteresting. The coating on the hazelnuts was sticky and had a weird flavor initially. And the black pepper ice cream... well, on its own, it tasted like vanilla with a strange aftertaste. HOLD THE PHONE. Together, this dessert was more than the sum of its parts! My book club loved it, went back for seconds, couldn't stop talking about the flavors. I was told I cut the tart slices too thinly. Multiple people had extra scoops of ice cream and were popping the candied hazelnuts like, well, candy. One person commented that it was one of the "top 10 desserts of his life." High praise! Excellent recipe! Easy, but takes a bit of time! The one change I made was that the ice cream custard just wasn't cool enough to process after the ice water bath - I let it sit in a bag in the refrigerator over night and then processed in the morning, and the texture turned out perfectly. Make this!!!

This recipe is very easy to make and a definite crowd pleaser. I hadn't heard of a peppercorn ice cream before and was intrigued when I saw this month's Bon Appetit. The milk chocolate tart plays well with the subtle sweetness and peppery notes on the ice cream. The ice cream by itself is delicious; although, without the tart I would reduce the amount of freshly ground pepper to 2 tsp (for the ability to eat large quantities, as necessary with any ice cream). But without a doubt I will be making this again. And the double chocolate tart is AWESOME.
