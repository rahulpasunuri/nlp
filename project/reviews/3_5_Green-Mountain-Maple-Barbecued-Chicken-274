This is the best recipe I've made on Epicurious so far. I'm going to make this again for sure. I thought the chili sauce might be too overwhelming for the maple syrup, bu it wasn't it was perfect!

A nice weeknight dinner. Used Asian chili garlic paste which gave a nice kick to the sauce.

I thought this was great. I used 1/2 tbsp of sriracha instead of the chili sauce and only had regular dijon (not country style) on hand, but the dish was delish. I baked it in the oven at 375 for 45 minutes since I am sans grill and really enjoyed it. The only change I'll make next time is using a better grade of maple syrup. I used the stuff for pouring over pancakes and I think it would have been even more delicious with a darker syrup.

Just made a double batch of the sauce for dinner tonight. WAY too sweet and acidic with no smoky or spicy to help cut it. I added a teaspoon each of Chipotle Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce and cooked it down until it was starting to thicken up quite a bit, and that seems a little better. We'll have to wati and see if it works on the chicken, I'm counting on the smoke from the charcoal to enhance this substantially.

This was a great, quick recipe. Kids loved it. Just a bit mild for me. I'd make it again though, probably with some extra mustard and vinegar.

I have made this recipe a number of times since it was published- It is a standard recipe in our house. Made it exactly as written.

came out just great, and we basted constantly. terrific! and, um, if you don't know what "chili sauce" means in a recipe, you might want to stick to chili's curbside takeout and not waste your time on real cooking.

I agree w/ the cook from Birmingham that this dish is not worth making again. I can buy a better sauce in AJ's, our gourmet market. Better recipe is the "Orange Rosemary Chicken" from this site, following all the tips from those who rated the recipe.

My wife and I had forgotten how good chicken can be! We will never use dry, flavorless chicken breasts again. The basting sauce was good, but I am most impressed by how juicy chicken thighs can be, even after grilling.

I didn't have any hot sauce either, I used spicy szechuan sauce. It was great. I made this at a family barbeque yesterday with wings and people were eating them as fast as I could make them.

Very tasty, didn't have any chili sauce so 1/2 and 1/2 straight ketchup and a gourmet bbq sauce...excellent flavour; much better than your standard bbq'd chicken, in my humble opinion. Very simple (2-3 mins to combine) too!

I got rave reviews on this! I'll suggest to do a double batch of the sauce. Reserve some for basting and reduce the rest for a garnish.

My husband and I love this recipe. Not sure why it didn't get better reviews. It is a delicious sauce and easy to make.

Chili sauce actually refers to a different species of ketchup. You'll find it in a curvy bottle near other condiments. It's generally not spicy in the least. This chicken is fine. I wasn't really in the mood for BBQ (though my husband was and seemed to enjoy it), but I'll probably try it again at a later date.

I think I must be confused. 3 tablespoons of chili sauce? Making this recipe, I assumed that chili sauce and pepper sauce (Tabasco) were the same thing. I thought, "Gosh, 3 tbsp seems like an awful lot. But here goes." It was so hot I threw it away and ended up just using bottled barbecue sauce. Is there a difference between chili and pepper sauce, or do I just have wimpy tastebuds?

A good dish, but didn't turn into a favorite. I tried this dish several years ago, and recently found it lanquishing in my recipe file--it was good enough to file, but not so good we ever yearned to eat it again!

I must admit this was good with Log Cabin syrup. Next time I wil double the sauce.

Very good recipe! I used regular chicken thighs (not boneless)and I made extra sauce. Excellent-a definite keeper

Delicious chicken with a kick! Served it for friends with grilled veggies and bean/corn/tomato salad and they thought I had morphed into Martha Stewart! Great all-American bbq dinner.

What a great sauce! The one good thing about chicken thighs is that you'd really have to cook them forever for them not to remain juicy. One bit of advice: Make plenty of sauce. I wish I had more. I would have slapped it on more generously and more frequently.

Very easy. I add 3 Tbs. vinegar and a heaping Tbs. mustard. Good dish, especially for kids.

Another hit from Epicurious.com! The whole family loved it and I have a few finicky eaters! I used the thighs and it was very good and I believe that it would be just as good on any part of the chicken. Try it, it's easy and tastes great!

A little "chewy" compared to chicken breasts,but, naturally, more flavorful. Already made it a few times...

This recipe was easy to make and tasted good - not great. The sauce is quite mild. I would make it again but would add more vinegar and mustard to spice it up a bit. Also, I think I would try it in the oven instead of the grill so that the chicken breasts were more moist.

Delicious grilled chicken! I used split chicken breasts and cooked over a slow grill about 50 minutes. I will definitely try again with boneless chicken. Very easy and very tasty!

This is an excellent dish, and very easy to make. The sauce is quite economical when you look at the original cost and the number of servings you can make, compared to 'store bought' sauce's. I am keeping this one for those day when I dont know what I want and dont want to spend time in the kitchen. This is a 'must try'.

This recipe is too easy! It is wonderful for that night when you are in a rush for something really good or for that really fussy teenager! (Mine gobbled it up and was looking for seconds!) I will definately use this recipe again and again
