So easy and the chicken was very moist and flavorful. I used lemon-tarragon dressing and served over brown rice. YUM!

This is alright, nice and easy and quick, but nothing to write home about. Also, we found the rosemary flavour to be very strong on the chicken, but for some reason not so on the peppers.

One of my favorites! Simple but delicious!

I thought the original recipe was a bit too basic, so I made a rice pilaf with raisins and almonds instead of plain rice, and I added a few sliced tomatoes on the grill. Not bad.

Nothing great, pretty bland, OK for a week-night dinner. Yes, it was easy, but I think this would have been better as kabobs and the marinade needs more zip.

Very good recipe. I will definitely use this recipe again. I may use wild rice or something other than white rice next time. Seems to be a healthy, low fat meal as well.

I thought this was a great recipe. I can prepare the chicken ahead of time and my husband can do the grilling.
