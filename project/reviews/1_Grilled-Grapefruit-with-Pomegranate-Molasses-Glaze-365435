Guess there was a reason no one else tried this recipe! It sounded very odd & it surely was. The taste was very, very bitter {even though I removed every last speck of pith & peel!} & there was way too much cardamom overpowering this {& I like cardamom}. This was a big waste of expensive pomegranate molasses & perfectly good grapefruits. Guess I was the guinea pig for this recipe to spare ya'll the trouble.
