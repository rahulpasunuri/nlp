This recipe is a excellent, simple staple that is easily adapted to substitutions if you don't have the specified ingredients on hand. However, I think it really needs the time overnight for the flavors to develop. I found it a bit bland and watery right after cooking, but the next day it had a much deeper, more complex flavor and texture. I also recommend a few pulses with an immersion blender. The avocados (on the underripe side) are a must -- their creaminess serves as a needed counterpoint to the chunky/grainy texture and smokiness of the soup.

Tasty! I added 3 or 4 heaping teaspoons of salsa to add that extra kick - mmmm....

I love this recipe and make it often. I like to put some of the recipe through the blender so the tortillas thicken up the soup a little. I make it with out the chili's as my kids don't love that part but then add a dash of Cholula pepper sauce to the finished dish for those who want it. I also double the recipe except for the broth when I want to freeze it...saves on freezer space and I add back the extra broth and grilled cubes of chicken when I reheat.

Not like any tortilla soup I've had and definitely not worth the all the effort. Very watery and bland.

Even better the next day! The flavors melded overnight and made an already great recipe even better. I'll definitely make this again.

This is a staple for me. I make a few modifications to turn it into a meal: 1 pound of shrimp sauteed in garlic and cumin, corn, and a whole lime and a lot of cilantro for flavor. For a low fat option, I bake the tortilla strips. The avocado relish is a must! The soup keeps well for several days.

I made this soup for my dinner club and we all LOVED it! There was so many different flavors and just the right amount of spice. We would all make it again.

I followed the recipes with the exception that I added chicken breast and ground cumin, the kids and my husband loved it, it is a keeper.

This was a great soup to make and to eat with friends. We've made it several times, and like it best in the winter with a dry chianti.

Yum! Easy, quick and flavorful. The tortillas in the leftover soup were a bit wilted the next day so I poured the whole soup in the blender. The flavor was just as good with the pureed soup. I will definitely make this soup again and again.

it was excellent, easy to prepare... My husband loved it. the only changes i did did not have cumin seeds; so i just warmed the cumin grinds in a pan and did poblano; so i used jalapeno. I will save this recipe for sure.

Quite flavorful, especially with the corn tortilla strip crunch on top. BIG MISTAKE: I used flour tortillas in the soup itself since I ran out of corn ones and they puffed up like airy, slimy, blobs of empty carbs. I spent an hour trying to salvage the soup by straining it cup by cup and removing the gunk. Ugh! Never again; white flour is the pits. I then went to buy more corn tortillas and they made ALL the difference. Substantial, tasty, and most importantly they retained their shape and consistency. Can I spare you the same agony by this review? I hope so.

I made this recipe for a girls' night out and everyone loved it! I couldn't find any vegetable broth, so I substituted chicken broth (also threw in a bay leaf while it simmered), and it worked great. I also used wheat tortillas--they weren't as pretty, and didn't crisp the same way, but no one minded. I was scared it might turn out watery (it seemed like more broth than what I would have guessed), but it definitely wasn't! It was a more substantial appetizer than I'd hoped.

This was a good soup, but next time I would decrease the amount of stock. It seemed a bit watery. Also, a bit of chorizo would enhance the flavor.

Excellent dish - easy to make and great taste. Used ground cumin as I do not have a spice grinder and worked fine. I add graded cheese and sour cream.

If you like minestrone (and I don't), you'll love this soup. I can't believe that some cooks said this was easy to make; granted, I incorporated some suggestions of others, but it definitely wasn't worth the considerable effort and expense (unless you absolutely adore minestrone). This was just a Mexican-flavored vegetable soup in which the tortillas got totally lost. (Thus, the whole point of making this recipe was lost.) One nice touch, however, was eating avocado nicely warmed by the broth -- that was very satisfying.

Excellent! My new bride has "encouraged" me to make it 4 times in the past month! I do add a pound of boneless, skinless chicken breast, use a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, double up on the cumin and add a little crushed red pepper. I also use 6 corn tortillas. Makes enough for 2 dinners and is very low fat!

Didn't taste much like the tortilla soup I am accustomed to getting out. Next time I would substitute the tomatoes with shredded chicken, the recipe as is is too tomato-ey. Also, the recipe suggests that you can make the soup 8 hours early and reheat... I would strongly advise against doing that. It tasted much better when I first made it (and the tortillas were still slightly crisp) than later when I served it to my guests.

This was a fantastic soup! I will be adding it to my list of everyday, fast and good meals. I used canned fire roasted tomatoes, yum, and added pieces of chicken thighs.

Excellent base recipe! I'm a meat lover so I added two links of cut-up chorizo sausage along with some tiger prawns. Definitely a recipe to keep.

This was an unqualified success even though I misread the recipe and used coriander seeds and added the cumin when I realized my mistake. I used more cilantro and lime than called for and put the avocados in the soup before serving. I left it on the lowest setting of my crock pot for about 8 hours after putting it together.

I'd never made tortilla soup before and while my sister was recuperating from surgery, she had a craving. This is a great, quick recipe and everyone loved it!

Good basic tortilla soup recipe. I Like to add some whole kernal corn (fresh or frozen), or hominy, some kidney beans (canned, rinsed),a small can of chopped green chilis (mostly for color) and a generous garnish of monterey jack or pepper jack, shredded, on top.

This was really delicious! As good as or better than any restaurant. I used a whole head of roasted garlic (mashed into a paste with a little salt) instead of 2 cloves of chopped. And I added 1 1/2 cups frozen corn, defrosted, and 1 grilled chicken breast, chopped. We'll have this again and again, I'm sure!

This is a great EASY dinner on a busy weeknight. I used Sun Roma golden tomatoes for a coloful and delicious alternative.

Ok, so I also cheated and used the store bought (store brand, even) white tortilla chips, dusted with a bit of chili powder. Really, not a bad swap. ***Instead of 2 cloves of garlic, add ten cloves of roasted garlic, big difference, much better.

My family, including my picky teenage son, really enjoys this recipe. But busy as I am, I couldn't be bothered frying the tortillas the second time I made the recipe, so I just put my favorite brand of white tortilla chips in the soup long enough to soften them and then crumbled some on top before serving. perhaps not quite as good as the original recipe, but definitely worth it on the convenience factor and certainly still very tasty.

The taste was just ok, but to be fair, I've never had tortilla soup before for comparison. Also couldn't figure out what the tortillas in the soup were for -- dissolve into thickener or to be eaten soggy?

Fantastic. Better than most restaurants.

We added 1 tbsp. of cumin, paprika, and 2 ozs. of celery and the white part of leeks. We served it with chicken, avocado and grated Cheddar cheese and additional tortillas. It was very spicy but delicious. It's my hubby's favorite.

Great family dinner. We added chicken to make it a hearty meal and served it with a dollop of salsa (with the avocado and coriander). Delicious!!
