Excellent salad. For the dressing I used both the cilantro and the mint, added the zest of one lime and a little extra lime juice, and did not use brown sugar. I used quartered grape tomatoes instead of regular tomatoes, and added an avocado. I prepared all of the ingredients in advance but did not put the salad together until serving time. I put the corn, tomatoes and onion in a bowl and poured in the dressing. I mixed it gently and then added the avocado. Delicious, will make it again, received lots of compliments.

This was delicious as is!! I made this as a side dish to an end of summer lobster dinner. A great substitute for corn on the cobb and less messy! Love the idea of adding black beans!

This was delicious. I used parsley for the dressing, shallots for the onion and added steamed asparagus. Next time I will try it with avocado.

A terrific way to enjoy peak local corn and tomatoes. I used basil instead of mint along with the cilantro, added a couple of chopped up peaches, and served on a bed of watercress. Rounded it out with Lynneden goat cheese on Bread Alone Tuscan toast--fast, easy, sublime summer dinner.

I love this recipe. The proportions are perfect, the flavor is fantastic. I think it's great alongside steak prepared as written. The vinaigrette and grilled corn are what makes it--so it's also delicious on romaine with avocado and whatever other veggies you have on hand. Perfect for the summer!

This recipe was very good over a bed of greens. I doubled the dressing recipe, minus doubling the oil. I also only put in about half of the corn and added a can of black beans. This salad paired with Grilled BBQ chicken was wonderful!

Increased lime and vinegar. Need to use very fresh corn and tomatoes or don't bother!

I definitely agree with previous reviews about the brown sugar making it too sweet. I think I would have liked this a lot more without it entirely. As it was, it tasted decent as a salsa with tortilla chips and would have been good with black beans added.

Like an earlier reviewer noted, corn is already sweet-- the brown sugar makes it too sweet.

Very good, healthy recipie. At first taste the dressing was a bit sweet, but I added it to the corn, tomato and onion mix anyway. The combination with the red onion really cut the sweetness, and the flavors blended quite well. I reserved a bit of the dressing and drizzled it over a bed of baby spinach, then piled the corn mixture on top; very delicious.

I make this often. I always add a can of rinsed, drained black beans, and usually double the dressing recipe. My favorite way to serve it, is to use it as part of a main dish salad. Spoon it over a large bowl of romaine lettuce. Add some sliced, grilled chicken breasts, sliced avocados and toasted pecans. I sometimes add a little Brianna's Lemon Tarragon Dressing, to the lettuce, if it needs more dressing. You could also add a little cheese. Everyone loves this recipe.

Fresh, summery, delicious. We added 2 cans of rinsed/drained black beans and grilled the corn...made it even better. Will try basil instead of cilantro next time. My husband thought the dressing was a bit too sweet given the corn is so sweet. Next time may leave out the sugar. I liked it as is. Would definitely serve to guests as a unique side. Very good

Exceptional salad that gets rave reviews. The taste of the mint gives the salad a fresh kick that is complimentary to the cilantro and lime. A great year round salad that adds great color!

This was an amazingly fresh salad! I blanced the corn in boiling water for a couple of minutes to bring out the beautiful, yellow color. I also added a can of drained and rinsed black beans. We added a wee bit of salt. I work in a nursing home and we have a cooking group every Friday. We made 2 of these...one with mint and cilantro and one with basil from my garden. Each were wonderful and the residents loved it. Especially tasty with tortilla chips. Enjoy!

This salad is a hit everywhere I take it! I added black beans, avocado and Monterey Jack cheese. I never seem to have mint, but that doesn't seem to matter to anyone. I also cut down the number of tomatoes since I added other ingredients.

I made this with basil instead of mint, and it was fabulous. I might use mint next time, for a "brighter" flavor, and I think I'll reduce the amount of brown sugar by just a bit. Other than that, though, this salad was perfect... easy, and remarkably good.

If it tastes this good without the mint, I can only imagine the taste with the mint! Easy and flavorful--who could ask for anything more. Used white balsamic vinegar--bellisimo.

I wasn't prepared for how good this tasted! I can definitely see making the dressing for all kinds of salads. I used fig vinegar, which is all I had, and the taste was great. I used a variety of small cherry tomatoes and that worked very well, although I can also see using other veggies. This is a keeper!

I liked this a lot, but my kids hated it. The lime really made it. I didn't even have any cilantro, and used way more mint cuz I had it. I used tarragon and salad herbs instead of the cilantro. It was very crisp and sweet and good. But I can't make it anymore at my house. :-(

I subbed basil for the cilantro and used a mixture of red peppers and tomatoes. I also added some roasted red pepper sausage and some anaheim chili to make it a meal.

I doubled this recipe and made it with 2, 16oz bags of frozen corn which I briefly cooked first. It was very good and everyone enjoyed. I tossed the corn and onions with the dressing well before serving and then added tomatoes in at the last minute. Other reviewers said their tomatoes turned to mush after dressing salad. I did not have this happen, in fact the salad was delicious the next day. This was a great BBQ recipe. It was much easier than making 10 ears of corn at the last minute with little kids under toe.

Had the dressing over a salad of romaine, blk beans, corn, tomatoes and tortilla strips. Made without the mint and was amazing.

Excellent salad dressing !! I added some lime zest since my two limes didn't yield enough juice. The zest probably improved the flavor. I used the extra leftover dressing on a regular lettuce salad that also had peppers and black beans. It was fantastic and quite nuanced.

I thought this was delicious. I too added black beans and didn't have fresh mint so I added just a drop of mint extract. I like the idea of adding avocado, but it's good as printed. Will try basil (no mint) next time in the dressing, just for a change.

I found the red onion too strong and substituted green onion. Otherwise, a wonderful salad.

I too made several revisions. I added 2/3 cup diced jicama, a diced roasted red pepper and the black beans as recommended below. I also amped up the cilantro, garlic and lime the in the dressing and when brightening up the leftover salad also added more lime and green tabasco sauce. Delicious.

This is not a recipe to make ahead, unless you keep the salad and dressing separate until serving, as specified. As picnic fare, wouldn't you want to keep onsite prep to a minimum. Essentially, a few minutes after I added the dressing (truly yummy!!), the tomatoes went liquid and my salad became almost a soup. Taking a cue from another here, I added a can of (drained) black beans. Tastewise, I loved the cilantro-mint-garlic dressing and will need to think of other uses for it. Wish there was a rating category for "Not Sure" or "Maybe" in making it again. If I do, I think I'll add some diced avocado and far less tomatoes. Yes, I did seed them first, but such ripe tomato pulp is still so juicy.

This is a great summer salad. We served it last night with grilled pork chops and I added black beans to the leftovers for lunch today - wonderful!

Everything was incredibly delicious....separately. The corn was at its peak of ripeness, as were the tomatoes. The dressing was fantastic....by itself. But once everything was mixed together,the whole salad became bland. I have no idea how that happened and I'm not gonna bother to try and figure it out. I just won't make this recipe again. I have better things to do with corn and tomatoes at the peak of ripeness.

I made the recipe as printed except for scallions substituted for the red onion. It was excellent, and my guests loved it, too. Although I did not have fresh mint, I'm sure it would only make the dish better. It's a great alternative way to serve fresh sweet corn. This goes in the permanent rotation.

I'd never made a dish with raw corn before, but it was so good. Used dried mint b/c I didn't have fresh. I also halved the amounts of corn & tomato (because there were only two of us dining) but didn't halve the ingredients of the sauce, and it worked out quite deliciously.
