This is a keeper- easy to make, very flavorful. Prepared exactly as recipe instructs. Honey only added a wee depth of flavor- for the poster who was concerned about it being overly sweet. The olives take care of that nicely- Will definitely make this again.

This is a very falvorful chicken recipe. A real winner with our guests, definitely one to keep. We don't eat olives so substituted capers instead and it turned out wonderfully well.

I would not serve this for company, but it was a delicious, and somewhat healthy weeknight dinner. My husband loved it. I'll definitely make it again.

Delicious and Different. Just the thing to make if you've gotten tired of your own cooking. Tested the recepie tonite- loved it; will use it at my next dinner party

I have made this many times; for family and for company. It always gets rave reviews. I couldn't find the right olives and simply removed the pimento from the regular olives in my fridge and have it work out great. Now I try to keep some good green olives on hand just for this recipe.

I have made this dish a few times for company with great results, I find it very good and if you use good sherry the flavors are great

Very good dish and very simple (aside from finding picholine olives!): I would disagree with the reviewers who called this bland--the flavors are not aggressive, but they work well together.

OK, I MIGHT make this recipe again. But only to verify whether or not it really is the worst recipe I've tried so far from this site. My own fault the chicken was overcooked, but everything else was to the letter and found it tasteless. Even the next day left overs were bland.

PS from a cook from New York, NY: I forgot to say, the honey doesn't make the recipe too sweet--there's a lot of sauce, and it's only a tablespoonful of honey. I think, though, you want to be sure to use a medium sherry and not a sweet one if "too sweet" is a concern.

This was so good. I'm glad I made the full recipe instead of halving it to serve two, so now there's some in the freezer, all ready to go. I used juicy Mineola tangelos instead of oranges, and cut each half into 4 slices, instead of trying to make 5 wedges, and the tangelos held up very nicely and looked very appealing on the plate. My husband was thrilled with this meal. I'd happily serve it to company.

P.S. from Lake Winnipesaukee ~ I forget to tell you , I did not use the honey. I think this would make it too sweet.

Outstanding braised chicken ! Be sure to use good quality Sherry (like Dry Sack) and fancy olives at your produce section . The fine aroma of this dish was the hint it was gonna be delicious.

Orange wedges contributed to the sauce which was very good but they didn't add to the presentation. Recommend feeding them to the disposal prior to seving. Chicken was ok but not outstanding.

Four forks for easy and superb sauce flavor. I used chicken thighs and served this with Parmesan Polenta and a mixed baby greens salad. My kids loved it too. I am making this again next week.

I served this at two dinner parties, two nights in a row. It was uncomplicated and easy to adapt for any number, first night served 8, second night served 12. Received wonderfully by adults and children alike. Served with the caponata also in this issue, polenta and steamed broccoli. Some guests requested the recipe, as the flavors were pronounced yet balanced.

This was good, but not outstanding. Since I have other excellent chicken recipes, I won't be doing this one again.
