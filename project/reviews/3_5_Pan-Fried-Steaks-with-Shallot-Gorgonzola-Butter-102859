Very easy to make. I didn't make the butter, but I did saute the shallots in butter and mixed it with crumbled gorgonzola while still warm. Served the steaks over a bed of arugula salad with heirloom tomatoes, sliced raw shallots and a garlic infused olive oil and crumbled the cheese over everything. Simple, easy and delicious.

Taste: fantastic. Presentation: 0. Meat (diagonal-cut sirloin) looked moldy with the melted blue-green cheese mix. Will use leftovers on toasted baguettes with lettuce and tomato. Perfect sandwich.

Quite good. I agree with the extra cooking time and the roasting of the shallots. Very easy to make and you got at a good ol' steak. Add potatoes and you got a masterpiece. Sometimes simple is better.

This is a wonderful recipe. My husband and I make it very frequently but never seem to get sick of it! We usually pan fry for two minutes on each side for perfect medium rare. Don't overcook!!!

We LOVED this! The gorgonzola butter is wonderfully rich and a little goes a long way. I put the steaks (with butter on top) under the broiler for just a minute before serving. Softened the shallots just a bit. Just delicious.

Simple and fantastic. I've made this several times. OK, so it may clog the arteries but you only live once, right? My wife is no fan of beef but she likes it. I used dried chives as I was out of fresh and I did not miss a thing.

I would make this recipe again. My company raved and raved about it. Its fast and easy, however I froze the butter and a week later it lost the great flavor. I recommend not storing it. Its so fast you should try for relatively same day use.

This recipe was excellent and so easy to prepare. I made it for a special anniversary dinner and my boyfriend was amazed. I paired it with Wild Mushroom Risotto and Roasted Asparagus, which were excellent complements. I took other reviewers suggestions and froze the remaining gorgonzola butter to use at a later date. Note: The cooking time is a bit too short, even for medium rare. I added an extra minute to each side and it came out a perfect medium rare.

Wonderful recipe, simple yet melts in your mouth. Great recipe for company since you just have to sear the meat. Takes all of 5 minutes, and the butter can be made up ahead of time. The best steak recipes don't cover up the flavor of the steak, this butter compliments it perfectly.

Followed recipe as is and the steaks turned out delicious. My husband could not stop raving about these steaks. Used my nonstick grill pan rather than a skillet to cook the steaks, and this worked perfectly to brown the outsides & reduced the need for cooking butter.

This a great compound butter recipe. The first time I made it I followed the recipe exactly (pan-fried steaks) and it was wonderful. Since then I have used this butter BBQ steaks, lamb chops, and even salmon. The butter produces a wonderful, tasty compliment.

Scrumptious! The butter was easy to prepare and added a special "oomph" to the steaks. Any steak lover will appreciate this recipe! I'd consider it a great dish for guests and, like many of the other reviewers, will enjoy using the butter with other dishes. Tossing with hot pasta? Spreading on baguettes under the broiler? Yum!

I loved this recipe. Made it for a dinner party on New Year's Eve. We grilled the steaks though, and put the butter on top after.

The gorganzola butter is really delicious. I had my doubts with steak but the combo is really good. I tried to pan fry per the instructions but nearly burned the steak and it was quite rare. I'd recommend using a pan that can transfer to the oven so you may sear the outside and still cook the center to desired level. We did this and it came out great.

This is a great and easy recipe. Followed it as is. Loved it as well as my husband.

This recipe is exceptional EXCEPT for using the amount of raw shallots it calls for. Try mellowing the shallots by roasting them for 10 min or so, or cut back on the amount. In my restaurant we tried both; the roasted version was much more enhancing to the steak rather than trying to steal the show. p.s. no problem.

Wonderful! Flavorful! Perfect! I used filet mignon and will try rib-eye steaks next. The 'butter' is great on baked potatoes, too. I roasted the shallots like the cook from Memphis suggested, which was a great idea. Thanks.

this is incredible! i only made two steaks, but i made all the butter and froze half (i'll probably use it pretty soon); it's delicious. i found that it didn't really need any extra salt, that the proportions were perfect already. this butter is very versatile, too.

I made this dish last night for my boyfriend and he was in heaven. I didn't have dill so left it out of the butter. It was still wonderful. I served it with Black Angus ribeyes and sour cream cucumber salad which I got from this site and a salad of baby mixed green with avocado and extra virgin olive oil. I have lots of butter left over so think that I will try it with pasta. This recipe is definately a keeper.

This was really really tasty, even though I used an average (not awesome) gorgonzola. The shallots are a must, however the butter ended up looking a little gray after adding the cheese and shallots. That would not prevent me from making this for company, though. Just dim the lights!! I served with just a green salad and vinaigrette on the same plate and the best part was getting little bits of the butter with each bite of tangy salad!

I agree - this is heavenly. The butter is wonderful and you'll have plenty left over to put on vegetables, etc. So easy, and so good.

I love gorgonzola/blue cheese so was not surprised that I loved this recipe. But it would be nothing without the shallots. Start with good steaks and you'll end with a great dinner!!

Absolutely delicious!! I grilled the steaks and added the butter mixture at the end and let it melt on the steaks. I served it with smashed potatoes with the left over butter mixture and extra chives and cheese. Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was extremely easy to make although it was a very rich. It was very good but I could only eat this dish once in a while. I added extra gorgonzola cheese and found that you can never add too much.

FAbuloous: my husband would eat this every day if I let him. One word of advice: the secret to making this stupendous lies in the quality of the steak....go the extra mile and get the rib-eye from a good butcher and you will LOVE it!

This is so easy to make - why not do it again. I really liked the taste of the gorgonzola in the butter. I had so much left over butter - I served it on breads and other dishes later. The recipe was pretty simple so you could easily get creative and make your own flavors for the butter.

This recipe was easy and sinfully rich. the shallot butter was great on the accompanying vegetables and potato.

Thought this recipe was fantastic - served it with garlic mashed potatoes and it was perfect. I really enjoyed the gorgonzola-shallot sauce, although I next time I'll use a little more cheese. A great dish when you're tired of plain old steak.

This was excellent, a "keeper" so to speak. My husband loved it. I served with fresh spinach, fresh summer squash & baked potatoe with sour cream & chives. I also used freeze dried chives as the herb garden is asleep here in the Northern part of the State, which worked just as well.

We loved the shallot-gorgonzola butter. Actually we kept the left over in the freezer, it tastes delicious also with with baked potato.

Sometimes simple recipes work. Not this time. The flavor of the raw shallots is far too strong, and completely masks the flavors of the other ingredients. Don't waste your time on this one, There are much better recipes to dress up a steak.

wow!!!! THIS DISH IS AWESOME. STEAKS WERE VERY TENDER AND THE SAUCE WAS TO DIE FOR. MY HUSBAND REQUESTED FOR THE 2ND TIME IN A WEEK. HE WANTS TO LEARN THIS RECIEPE SO HE CAN MAKE IT. A KEEPER FOR SURE.
