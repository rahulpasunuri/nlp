I didn't remove the liver! Is that a problem? Why do the recipes all say remove the liver from the giblet bag?

I tried this recipe for T-Day. Used a Trader Joes fresh, brined bird (22 lbs) so skipped the brining. Stuffed the bird with leftover orange and lemon halves and some fresh sage. Doubled the thyme citrus butter and used it exclusively to baste with. Made the gravy using store bought chicken broth and used a different stuffing recipe. The turkey and gravy were a HUGE hit. Very moist and flavorful. For X-Mas, I made it again. This time I used a 20 lb frozen turkey and brined the turkey for two hours. I stuffed the turkey with the extra citrus halves and fresh sage again and made the Wild Mushroom and Spinach Stuffing on the side (AWESOME!). This time I took the effort to make the giblet broth and gravy as written in the recipe. It's worth it. I served 15 picky adults and like seeing a unicorn, EVERYONE enjoyed the meal and asked for the recipe. Both times I removed the turkey from the oven at 160 degrees inner thigh and let it sit and finish cooking under a tight foil tent for another hour plus while I baked the dressing, made potatoes, etc. Moist and flavorful. The gravy is REALLY good too! I dumped nearly all the pan drippings since they were mostly fat, but kept the very bottom 3/4 inch of the measuring cup of thick pan scrapings for the gravy.

This was quite moist and tasty. Made my own stuffing and cooked outside the bird. No wine or brandy used, still a deep flavorful bird and gravy.

Did not make a turkey -went for the gravy instead and it turned out a great success. Used 2 packages of turkey giblets and hearts. Also while the stuff was boiling, reduced some of the left over turkey fat and sauteed an additional large onion and 3/4 pack of mushrooms (all diced up) in the fat, till golden brown. Added to the gravy together with the giblets - flyed off the table - will definitely make again next year!

I've made this recipe for most of the Thanksgivings since it first appeared in the magazine in 1996. It's just the best I've ever done!

I have made this dish for the last two Thanksgiving days. It is the absolute best Turkey I've ever had (and quite juicy). The brining is extremely important to prevent dryness (obviously, most people must not know about brining!!!). I did a stuffing other than the recommended cornbread stuffing, but all else was the same. The gravy is absolutely delicious. This recipe is "flavor-fabulous"!!!

This was my first holiday turkey recipe ever back in '96, and had such fond memories that I made it again for Thanksgiving this year. For once, my memory did not deceive me! This is a wonderful recipe, particularly the giblet broth and the cornbread stuffing. I made only slight modifications, which I recommend. First, I only put the oranges and lemons used to make the citrus-thyme butter in the cavity, along with a large handful of fresh sage and thyme. I don't think I'll ever go back to stuffing the turkey with dressing again - adds too much to the cooking time, and the possible health risk is just one thing less I have to stress about on a very busy day. I took the advice of a previous reviewer regarding softening the butter, mixing in the citrus juice, zest, etc. and then refrigerating the mixture again in order to avoid separation - worked perfectly. The giblet broth is perfection as written and makes the most delicious gravy in a huge quantity, which is perfectly fine with me! I, too, skipped the egg and the giblet meat in the gravy because I hate to tamper with something I already like so well. Though I generally prefer sausage in all things, I think this bacon stuffing recipe is probably my all-time favorite: simple, fragrant with sage and the toasted cornbread (the recipe for which I like quite well, made in a 9 inch cake pan) and extra toasted Georgia pecans. Finally, don't be afraid to brine the turkey for the alloted amount of time (or a bit more, even) unrefrigerated: I added a bit more kosher salt to account for the extra water in my large stock pot and the turkey turned out moist and delicious.

Have made this recipe every Christmas for about two years now and evey year all I have left after Christmas is the bones! It's a big hit with my family and guest. I follow the recipe as written.

Everyone agreed this was the best Turkey they ever had both in flavor and moisture. Turkey rested for about an hour before carving (travel time). Only deviations: left out eggs, submerged Turkey (21lb.) in about 6 quarts water and increased salt to about 2.5 cups for about 3 hours (day before), and used convection (at same temp) last half of cooking.

My family really loved the turkey, stuffing and gravy! I thought the gravy tasted awesome with the eggs in it. The only thing I left out in the recipe was the brandy, but that was by accident. I bought brandy specifically for the gravy and after we ate I saw the unopened bottle and realized that I forgot to put it in. The gravy was still delicious without it just in case someone is thinking about leaving it out.

This was my first time roasting a turkey. I made this recipe omitting the cornbread stuffing. Following suggestions here I had the bird on all sides (breast-side down and part time on each side, finished right-side up) and stuffed with citrus, onion and herbs. Turkey was moist and juicy removed at exactly 180 degrees. About blending the thyme butter, I used the Kitchenaid with the whip and it still took a while. I agree with the other person on skipping the hard-boiled eggs in the gravy. They don't hurt (or help) the flavor and they add a somewhat unpleasant appearance to an otherwise fine recipe.

This was a GREAT flavor combination! We followed the instructions almost to the letter for the turkey, the only difference being that we didn't stuff the turkey and put the used citrus halves in the cavities instead. The gravy and stuffing sounded just too rich and fatty for our current diets, so we just made our usual gravy and dressing using the broth from the recipe. They both turned out wonderful. The broth made them taste much better than they usually do. So while the turkey and gravy will probably be reserved for special occations, we'll definately remember and use that broth recipe.

This was the absolute BEST turkey dinner I have ever prepared (for a party of 12). This recipe will be passed on to many family and friends over the years. THANK YOU Epicurious for providing such easy access to so many wonderful recipes. My cooking acumen has made dramatic leaps and bounds, and I am becoming known among my friends as the "chef" in the group!

Delicious. This is the first time I've managed to make a moist turkey. The only thing I would change would involve the gravy - I'd leave out the hardboiled eggs and cut the amount of liquid in the giblet broth. The recipe makes ALOT of gravy.

Due to an overwhelming family response, this has become the traditional Turkey for Thanksgiving in our home since it was published in '96. Considering it was my first turkey ever, I thought it was beginner's luck. Nope, it makes a perfect bird every time. The only difference in recipe is that I stuff the turkey with the remainder of the orange and lemon as well as an onion and a couple stalks of celery in lieu of "stuffing." Keeps the turkey VERY moist. My mom even hands out this recipe to anyone and everyone who will listen.

My family loves the turkey and the gravy,(have made them both every Thanksgiving for the last 5 years!) however we have found the stuffing to be very dry.

How I solved the butter separation problem: microwave until butter is very soft but not liquid, whisk together and then refrigerate until solid. Also, leaving a turkey out covered in chilled water from the fridge is not dangerous--it will barely reach room temp in 2 hours, which it needs to be for proper roasting.

I was skeptical but prepared the "thyme butter" anyway. As I suspected, the orange and lemon juices don't combine with the butter. You wind up with a separated mess. Also, I don't see much wisdom in allowing the uncooked turkey to sit at room temp for two hours. This would be a health code violation in a public setting and for good reason.

I agree with the other reviewer on how to roast a turkey (or chicken) - start breast down for 45 mins at 450 but I turn the bird on it's side for 20 mins then switch sides for another 20 then breast up for the last hour or so. Turkey cooks in no time and is juicy and DONE. Love the gravy but prefer the herb-bacon corn bread stuffing (search on Epicurious) not cooked in the bird. Also the balsamic glazed pearl onions with this. Great, exciting flavors. Brining is very important to a juicy turkey. Try doing it the night before.

This is a very good recipe for turkey preparation.

C-mon you guys why not roast your turkey breast side down so the rich back juices run into the breast.Turn th bird over for the last half hour of roasting for the pretty presentation.You will get a juicy bird without basting which is the practice of opening the oven frequently and letting out the heat. Be sure to roast on a wire rack. No luck necessary !!! ENJOY

I, too, made this for my "first" Thanksgiving with my new husband. We had several friends over, and it was a hit! It looked exactly like the picture (I made my husband take pictures). The directions in the recipe were easy to follow. It was so good, I'm making it again this year!

I made the turkey and gravy for the 1st Thanksgiving dinner I ever had to cook. The results were great and my boyfriend and brother really enjoyed the turkey. It's really juicy and flavorful. A great recipe for a beginner cook!
