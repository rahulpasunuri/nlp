super easy, super tasty and a great foundation for all kinds of modifications. A snap to put together any day of the week. I used 1/3 c olive oil instead of the butter and whatever pasta I had in my pantry. We all loved it. I think it could use an extra kick from red pepper flakes. Next time I may try adding some sun dried tomatoes, fresh cherry tomatoes, corn, cranberries, walnuts or a combination of the above. Will definitively do it again.

My 17 year old daughter made this for supper one night and it was a hit! Her sister even loved it and she usually hates broccoli. She served it along with chicken drumsticks and used olive oil instead of butter, we try to eat more healthy in our house. It will be a definitive hit in our house for sure!

super easy, fast and good. Kids favourite (with peas & corn, minus broccoli). If I were to do it again, I would add some baby arugala.

This was easy and tasty! Although I did decrease the butter, doubled the garlic and herbs and added some turkey meat (my husband doesn't usually respond well to pure vege meals). It will be one of our usual pastas!

I added more garlic and red pepper flakes; and cut down the butter by half. Still, a very good recipe. It obviously has good bones, as seen by the many people who added other things, but I like the simplicity and ease of this as written.

Fresh and delicious, quick and easy. What could be better?

Great, easy dinner recipe. I added cannelini beans for protein. Definitely a keeper.

Four stars for a quick, satisfying flavorful meal. I used 4 cloves of garlic, generous ground pepper, and fresh thyme rather than basil and parsley, and it came out beautifully. Great little meal between studying for exams!

two cloves of garlic is for sissies. If you're going to stay at home, might as well throw in three or four, since the garlic seemed rather light for that quantity of pasta. A "ton" of salt is not necessary with the simple addition of our kindly friend, fresh lemon (juice). I boiled the broccoli before the pasta and removed with slotted spoon, then added pasta to the brocoli water separately so the broccoli could be drained more easily. Nothing goes better with garlic and basil than olive oil. Opting for healthier fats, I decreased the butter and added more olive oil. Extra points to this recipe for the EASE in making it., as well as helping us incorporate brocoli: "the king of vegetables" (for its vitamins) into our diet.

We quite enjoyed this. I made it as written. It's nothing fancy but it sure tastes good. I wouldn't change it, and I'll make it again.

I used whole wheat pasta, and found it a bit dry, but that's a common problem. I also doubled the basil, parsley, and garlic. Overall, quick & easy & delicious!

Rating: 2
Satisfying dish. I only had dried basil and parsley so I used that. Love garlic, so doubled it. Halved the butter since a stick seemed excessive. You'll definitely need to season it with lots of salt. I mixed in shredded parmesan cheese so that helped. Like I said, a satisfying dish, and it was easy, so I might make it again for a night in. I wouldn't make it for company though.

Perfect just the way it's written. Used ghee to save on fat. TWIMC "definite" has no "A" and tomato has no "E", unless you're Dan Quail.

Very good. Light, fresh and nice blend of flavors. I made this as a side with grilled salmon as the main course. I arranged the angel hair on the serving platter and place the salmon on top of the pasta. Very nice and will make again.

This is great as is--it's supposed to be simple. If you start adding extra, as other readers suggest, you're actually just creating a new recipe.

Rating: 4
This is a great recipe - simple tastes ingeniously combined. Do NOT modify the recipe ingredients with pesto and tomato sauce and chili flakes and whatnot. It's perfect as is.

I modified this a bit. first of all, i decided to roast the broccoli, though in the process of doing this i found a new technique. I had preheated the oven to 425 and just popped in the broccoli (1 whole head) when i had to unexpectedly leave the house. So, i simply turned off the oven and left in the broccoli, expecting to roast it later. Well, when I got home the broccoli was completely cooked and absolutely delicious. The texture was almost chewy and the flavor was very concentrated with no extra salt added. I think i must had dried it or somehting, but it's delicious this way, not to mention energy saving. Anyway, the rest of the recipe is the same except halved the butter, added a bit of evoo, and a touch of lemon juice. Next time I might also add some hot chili flakes. very tastey and simple.

My six and three year old gives this dish four stars!

I followed the comments, and added the pesto, tomatoes and scallions. I also steamed the broccoli ahead of time so I could just throw them in the water for a quick second. It was wonderful. I served it at a private dinner party I catered, and the pasta bowl it was presented in just made it more spetacular. Everyone was very impressed. Thank you

This dish was easy to make, and though light, I definately have the satisfaction of a full meal. I did make a few modifcations, though. I added a handfull of diced : portobella mushroom, tomatoe, scallion, and a tsp of pesto with the herbed butter. DEFINATELY do not need a full stick of butter, I feel a little glutinous with the half a stick that we used and it was delicious! will definately be making this again !

So very quick. I doubled the pasta and used a full broccoli head, and the rest as written. Plenty of parm, it was delicious.

This disk was amazingly good for being so simple. Was a great side with the Chicken Louisa recipe.

It was good! I cut the butter in half, you really dont need that much. Like another reviewer said I would try mushrooms next time.

Rating: 4
I made this dish using what I had on hand, which equaled butter, pasta and broccoli. It was fabulous. I would make it again it was very quick & tasty. It would be even better with mushrooms. It was YUMMY

This is a great recipe. It can be made in a pinch with most ingredients you have on hand (I used frozen broccolli)

Rating: 3
Delicious! I cut the butter in half and added more olive oil when I added the herb butter to the pasta.

Rating: 4
I made this for a crowd and doubled everything in the recipe except for the butter (two sticks just seemed obscene), and it came out great. I used "domestic" butter, as that's what I had on hand. I used fresh basil and Italian parsley from my garden, and yum, what a delight. This gets four forks because not only is it delicious, but it uses simple, fresh ingredients, and it is a snap to prepare. I might try adding even more broccoli next time, and perhaps throw some red pepper strips in to boot--would make a beautiful presentation. My daughter's friends tried squeezing some fresh lemon juice on theirs, which sounded like a good idea, but I tried it and liked it better without. Don't skip the parmesan cheese!

Nothing spectacular, but a very easy and mouth-pleasing weekday dinner (if you don't mind eating a half-stick of butter in a sitting). Definitely opt in for the parmesan - barely makes a difference in terms of calories but it hugely improves the flavor of the dish.

Good, and easy, even if you make it with fetucine or spaghetti.

The fresh basil was great didn't have fresh parsely so used dried. Came out great also through in a little wine 3 Tbl sp for a bit of flavor.

Yum! Both my boyfriend and agree, that this really is a tasty dish. Also, really wonderfully easy to make. We like fast & easy dishes.

This was delicious and EASY. Unfortunately, it probably clogs one's arteries... it definitely tastes better with the Euro-butter (wasn't nearly as good with regular butter)!

Rating: 3
Quick, easy, and delicious. I also like that this recipe minimizes the number of dishes used in preparation.

Rating: 3
Excellent simple recipe, but add salt and pepper to the herb butter. I use fettucine, I think almost any pasta will work.

Great meal for the time involved. Make sure you drain this well as the brocolli is going to hold a lot of water.

This was my first meal to make for my family since my wife went back to work and the kids & I just loved it. It was very easy to make and was very filling. I grilled some chicken to add to this to make it a complete meal with garlic bread and a side salad.

Wow! I thought this was so good! Very easy to make and light tasting!
