This was very good. I added salt to my marinade and used Asian Chili Garlic paste in place of the sambal. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I had my doubts about the watermelon but it really worked and did add a needed coolness as noted in the recipe.

Delicious! I also salted my meat just before I cooked it, but otherwise followed the recipe. It was a big hit at my Labor Day cookout. What a wonderful use of watermelon! Everyone asked for the recipe.

Wow, exceptional flavor! I was really debating on this recipe and decided to go for it -- am so glad I did. Didn't change a thing, but next time would salt the flank steak before cooking. I marinaded the steak 4 hrs in the refrigerator and then 2 hrs at room temp. The flank steak was moist had great flavor -- surprisingly not over the top with 'heat'. Marinated yellow and orange peppers as directed for 2 hrs at room temp -- right before serving added cold watermelon cubes -- the salad had more 'heat' than the flank steak! The combination of flavors and textures were wonderful. Would definitely make again. Served with basmati parsley rice and steam garlic green beans. Easy meal, great for family and would impress company - as long as they're adventuresome eaters and like spicy- heat.

Made with a group of girls and all of us loved it. Spicy steak went so well with the cool watermelon.

Have to say that this recipe was Superb!!! I did follow one of the other reviews & added salt & pepper to my meat before i grilled it. Then for the peppers I used Purple, orange, & yellow peppers & marinaded them in the dressing before mixing in the watermelon. Then served it with the creamy parmesan reggiano risotto. Delicious adding the creaminess of the risotto & the lightness of the salad. A MUST to make again!!!!

Very good. Made only the meat (I used chicken) and not the watermelong salad. Used 1/2 of the sambal oelek, and still very tasty.

Didn't make the steak as I was just looking for a watermelon salad recipe. It was GREAT! The perfect amount of heat and flavor. I upped the rice vinegar a little, and also added fresh chopped some mint, which 1) added really nice color, and 2) provided a cool relief from the sirracha hot sauce. Some people were surprised they liked it as much as they did. Great salad. Just posted about it on my blog: www.LaAguacate.Blogspot.com. Check it out.

This was delicious and easy to make. You have to make the watermelon salad with it. It is what makes the dish really special.

I really enjoy the interesting and unusual flavor combinations in this recipe. I would make a few suggestions. Season the flank steak with salt and fresh-ground pepper before marinating. Chop the watermelon and bell pepper into a small dice and serve as a salsa alongside the steak. Add a chiffonade of Thai Basil to the watermelon salad if you have some fresh in your garden--it is a lovely spicy basil that goes beautifully with the flavors in this recipe. I omitted the the jalapeno chili from the salad because after tasting the salad the heat of the chili seemed like it would detract rather than add to all of these wonderful flavors.

I'm rating this recipe only on behalf of the marinade since I didn't make the salad. I let the meat sit for about 4 hours and the result was juicy, tender, flavorful, and a big hit with our guests. Unfortunately, I listened to the previous reviewers' advice and toned down the chili sauce - I don't think the original amount would have been too spicy for us since I hardly tasted the amount I did put in. But it didn't really matter - the steak was really tasty anyway.

Something different and delicious for the grill. Marinated the flank steak for 2 hours at room temperature and think it needed longer. Refrigerated the marinating peppers (in all the dressing). Drained dressing for meat. Added chilled watermelon to chilled peppers. Wow! Amazing and different. Served with Basmati rice. Family loved it.

Great summer meal, everyone was impressed.

Steak was fabulous (marinated 5 hours). Didn't really care for the salad. Room temperature sweet watermelon salad - seems natural that it should be chilled. Salad seemed to detract from steak. Did I mention it was fabulous.

Excellent recipe. Substituted shredded cabbage and juliened green peppers and onions for the cut pepper pieces. Mounded the watermelon slaw on plates with marinated pork tenderloin (instead of flank steak) and drizzled sauce on top. Served as an appetizer. It was a huge hit. Very spicy.

The flank steak was a hit at our dinner party but I would decrease the hot chili paste a bit next time. It took my breath away! The Pepper & Watermelon salad was colorful, crisp and the taste was the best! Many compliments on this recipe.
