As others have said, the sauce was fabulous. The beets were tender and I did get hints of thyme and orange, but they were waaaay too salty. Possibly my mistake for peeling them before roasting? The finished product was good enough to try again to get it right.

The sauce was fabulous, and the salt crusts pretty easy, but I didn't detect any of the thyme or orange in the finished dish. Also, if you're going to use the salt, it is *imperative* that you get large beets! At least I'm guessing that this is where I went wrong, all I could find was little beets, and they turned out too salty to actually eat - I'm guessing that with a larger beet the salty portion would be a smaller percent of the whole thing rendering it well seasoned rather than inedible.

it's easy and fun to cook with salt crusts, i do it with whole fish all the time. these beets were infused with the subtle flavors of citrus, thyme and horseradish-- delicious! one tip to help form the salt crust is to mix one egg white with the salt. it helps to make the salt pliable and to stick to the beets.

I made these tonight, and I'm giving 3 forks to just the horseradish creme fraiche and the idea of serving it with roasted beets. The salt crust renders the beets extremely salty, and after all the work of carefully jacketing the beets with the salt crust, they didn't have a hint of the orange, horseradish or thyme. Just salt. There must be a better way to infuse these flavors into the beets. I think it would be much better with a clean-tasting simple roast of beets minus the crust. The sauce is definitely a keeper, and I'll be using it for future dishes with beets. 2pastry2's suggestion of replacing the creme fraiche with greek yogurt is a good one.

Made this recipe for a quiet night at home and it was amazing. There are no special skills needed for crusting the beets - it's more of building a sandcastle kind of thing. Just place the beet on top of the salt mixture mound and then crust the salt on top and sides. It doesn't need to be perfect at all. Will definitely be making it again.

I served these beets at a party and they were fantastic; everyone asked for the recipe. I'll be making them again soon.

I enjoyed this recipe and so did my guests. The flavors infused in the beets were great. Plus the horseradish sauce was terrific. Made it with sour cream and used the leftover sauce the next day with sauteed grouper.

I don't think I will make this recipe again. It was a lot of work for very little results. It also takes a long time in the over to cook. I added one egg white and several tablespoons of water to the salt mixture in order to get it to hold together ( do you remember making salt dough sculptures in craft class?) The beets did have a good flavor, but I'm not that found of beets. However, the horseradish sauce was wonderful. I used Greek yogurt instead of the creme fraiche.
