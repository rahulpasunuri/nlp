I made this last year and both croquettes and salsa disappeared in a flash. We were at dinner tonight and my son-in-law asked if I would make them again. I guess it was more than hunger that made them so popular. I do remember I said I'd have to double the salsa recipe if I did it again.

This is my hands-down favorite recipe for leftover turkey! I've even found myself making a turkey breast in order to make these turkey croquettes! My favorite accompaniment is to skip the salsa and eat the croquettes with cranberry mustard (look for Wisconsin Wildnerness brand). After Thanksgiving, I made a double batch of the croquettes with the turkey leftovers, and froze the majority. I defrost them on the counter, and then reheat them in the toaster oven - yummy!

I am rating the salsa only as I did not make the croquettes. I had to use canned whole cranberry sauce because I couln't find fresh or frozen cranberries. I omitted sugar and added more lemon juice to make it more salsa like in consistency. I paired it with a barbequed, spiced rubbed pork tenderloin - used Chef Paul Prudhommes Pork and Veal Magic store bought spice. It was a hit and made great sandwiches the next day.I also used the salsa on BBQ turkey burgers - very good.

If you make the Lamb Chops w/Mashed Sweet Potatoes & Onions (from this site), use the l/o lamb pcs. and reduced sauce for the turkey and chix. stock!! It's wonderful!! One of the best new apps. I've had in quite a while.

I didn't yet make the turkey-sweet potato croquettes part of this recipe (although I plan to sometime soon). I just made the cranberry-apple salsa. I made the salsa for my wedding reception (multiplied it by four) and served it with both lime tortilla chips AND those various-flavored apple chips you can buy in the supermarket in rather small bags. The salsa was a hit; it's fantastic. It's also very easy to make, is colorful, and keeps well. I will make it very often!

No need for turkey! I thought these were a great vegetarian treat. You can never make too many!

I took several shortcuts in making this dish and it worked very well for us. I used canned turkey (I also did not wait 2 hrs. for the roux to set). And for the salsa I used cranberry relish. It transformed this recipe into a quick and easy weeknight supper.

Taste was bland and texture was mushy. A big disappointment. The salsa helped, but not enough.

We made a few dozen of these as an appetizer for friends & we all thought they were incredibly lucious, it was like magic, they dissapeared before our eyes. The salsa was also supurb.

Enjoyed these years ago as guests after thanksgiving & was delighted to find the recipe. They are just great! Haven't made the salsa - we use Durkee's spread or gravy. They freeze beautifully!
