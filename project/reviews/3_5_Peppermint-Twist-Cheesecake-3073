Made this tonight for the first time. 9 inch pan seemed OK, but made next time use a 10 inch one. Also, even tho I used the foil to cover the bottom of the pan, it leaked all over my oven. Be sure to use a cookie sheet to put under it.

Had trouble with it cooking evenly. Top browned before the center was done (made in 9" springform). Next time I will bake in a water bath. Doubled the crushed peppermint candies and it really helped bring out the peppermint. I think next time I will add mini chocolate chips (maybe even chopped up Andes mints) and possibly double the peppermint extract too. It tastes very good though as is, without these changes! I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't add the topping they recommend, but instead made a mint chocolate topping with cream, powdered sugar, and Andes mint chocolate pieces.

Excellent cheesecake. Used a 9 inch pan and cake was a nice thickness. Used chocolate teddy grahams for crust with no sugar. Was fine. Probably doubled the amount of peppermint and vanilla. Tasted great. Instead of the sour cream topping, made a dark chocolate ganache with mint and peppermint extract. Was unbelieveable.

The recipe was fantastic but there's two things I did differently. First, I incorporated semi-sweet chocolate chips, just because I felt the cheesecake was lacking something. Also, I didn't bother with that topping. Honestly, it just took away from the flavor after tasting it.

Wow, absolutely awesome! Took notice of complaints about not minty enough and bought real peppermint oil. Also used candy canes since it's Christmas time. Had trouble with it not cooking through, nearly burned the crust, so will use a 10" pan next time. Served it with homemade mint fudge sauce.

I loved this recipe! As other reviews suggested, I increased the sugar in the sour cream topping (I used 1/4 cup) and I added 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips to the batter. I also used half cream cheese and half low-fat neufchatel cheese. I don't think you could notice the difference at all. The mint flavor is definitely mild, but I think it works really well for a cheesecake.

I've made many cheesecakes, and while this one sounded great, it didn't quite deliver. The crust was fine (I added some chocolate for extra flavor). However, the filling was not really flavorful enough, despite doubling the mint extract and the crushed candies. The best part was the topping, which I changed to a bittersweet chocolate ganache flavored with mint extract. Overall, a tasty cheesecake for mint lovers, but not a real winner. Even the Christmas cheesecake on this site (with toffee pieces) is more tasty...

I made this twice-once to try out on the family and then again for the actual party. rave reviews all around. my only changes would be to bake longer-the first one was just too mushy in the center. I agree with the reviewer who thought the sour cream topping needed more sugar-it definitely does. I also added alot more peppermint candies to the second cake-the first just was not minty enough. anyhow, it was a hit-it is pretty and I will make it again!

This was my first attempt at making a 'real' cheescake and I was very pleased with the results. I really love peppermint so I doubled the amount of what the receipe called for. My family & a skeptical co-worker found it very good, refreshing, and the perfect end to Christmas dinner. I took advice of previous reviewers and made sure the ingredients were at room temp - texture was very smooth & creamy, and taking aside some batter and adding red food coloring and swirling - very pretty. I wasn't able to find chocolate wafer cookies for the crust so I used the mint oreos - I found another website that said to use 14 oreos & 1/4 cup margarine - I unfortunately got confused in the process and used the amount of margarine that was called for in this recipe so the crust didn't turn out. I will definately make this for Christmas next year - hopefully I get the crust right.

Made this for Christmas, and it was fantastic. The flavor wasn't too strong, but it was definitely flavorful. Everyone seemed to love it. I'll definitely make this one again.

Yum! PERFECT Christmas cheesecake. I made a few alterations, though--I found I was out of pep. extract (and so was the market, it turned out) so I added way more than 1/3 cup peppermint to make up for it. This actually turned the cheesecake a nice pink color :) Also, I omitted the topping and instead made a chocolate glaze (5 tbsp each whipping cream & corn syrup, 8 oz semi sweet choc.) I tried using mint oreos for the crust, but this didn't work to well; it was really gloppy and watery. I added some regular ground chocolate wafers to firm it up, and this worked fine. I will DEFINITELY make this cheesecake again; it was the favorite at the Christmas table!!! :-)

Great recipe, but I made a couple modifications to the recipe. First I added 5tsp of corn starch to the recipe. Second rather than cooking for 50 minutes at 350, I cooked it 350 for 15 minutes then reduced the temperature to 200 and cooked for another hour and 15 minutes. These changes help eliminate ANY cracking from occuring. Also rather than decorating with the peppermint star candies, I decorated with little candy canes for Christmas. Enjoy :O)

I made this for someone else who wanted something minty. It was good, but a bit sweeter than I care for (and I have a sweet tooth).

I have made this twice and it's been delicious both times. The second time I didn't add the topping layer - didn't think it added much. Don't add the crushed candies on top until you're ready to serve or they will "melt". I will definitely make this again!

The cheesecake was delicious, but it took MUCH longer than the indicated time to bake. I'm still trying to figure out the actual temperature of my oven, and the oven thermometer said it was at 400 (I can't seem to get it any lower, even if I've set it at 250 on the dial). Anyway, baking in it is a bit of an adventure. The cake tasted lovely, but it was still goo in the middle. My fault for taking it out too early, but I've never made cheesecake before and I wasn't sure if "set in the middle" meant set on top and wiggly in the middle or what. I now realize it means solid in the middle. Great flavor, it just came out like peppermint pudding in a chocolate crust. :) I also recommend using a 10 inch pan. There was barely enough room to hold the cake, and I had to improvise a foil collar to hold in the sour cream layer.

For the Cook from Baltimore: If you use Oreos for the crust, there are a couple of good recipes on this site for an Oreo crust so that it turns out better next time. I think you do need to bake it first with the Oreos and that should prevent leakage in the future. I like your swirling idea-- I will try that next time. :)

I had to use Oreos to make the crust, because I could not find any chocolate wafer cookies. I'm not sure if the crust turned out soggy because of this substitution or because it needs to be cooked before pouring the batter into the crust. Even though I surrounded the pan with tinfoil, it still managed to leak butter all over my oven. Maybe there's too much butter in the crust? Don't put crushed peppermint candies on top of this cake until you serve it. I put mine on after chilling, put it back into the refrigerator, and I ended up with a gooey pink mess with white candy chunks. It looked awful! I took 1 1/2 C. of the batter and added red food coloring, dropped by tablespoonfuls into white batter layers and swirled with a knife for a gorgeous cake.

This cheescake got rave reviews at Thanksgiving. Although it's a heavy dessert, the peppermint makes it refreshing. I added a little more peppermint to both the cheesecake and the sourcream topping and it was wonderful.

I loved the texture and flavor of the cheesecake. However, I thought the sour cream layer was a waste of time. It didn't add anything to the cheesecake. Next time I will add a little more peppermint to the cheesecake part and omit the s.c layer.

This cheesecake does sound interesting, but I have to laugh because this was one of the recipes that turned up when I did a search for 'buffalo' (as in wings)! Couldn't imagine what buffalo had to do with cheesecake... :)

Everyone was a little skeptical about a peppermint flavored cheesecake, but all doubts were put to rest after the first bite. This was a light and refreshing finish to our Christmas dinner (I know that "light" is not usually used to describe cheesecake, but trust me). Everyone was fighting over the leftovers.

I added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips to the batter-fantastic, not a morsel left- wonderful addition to our Christmas dinner!

Fabulous cheesecake. Remember to let all of the ingredients come to room tempurature before mixing. The cake will have a heavenly fluffy texture this way. The topping needs a bit more sugar.It was too sour tasting. I would also recommend baking the crust for 8-10 min. at 350. The crust was too soggy. All my good cheesecake recipes bake the crust to seal and crisp it up. I will make this again and again. Trust me, I've won awards with my desserts.

I halved this recipe and poured the batter into a purchased chocolate cookie crust. This is a good size for small groups and a good way to experiment with a recipe. If you want something different for the holidays, this is it.

If you didn't like the texture or quality of this cheesecake, then you must have done something wrong in the baking process. Because unless you don't like peppermint (and then why would you be trying it?) There is NOTHING wrong with this cheesecake! I was very skeptical about making this cake, let alone featuring it as my one and only cheesecake in December in my Restaurant. I was so pleased with this recipe that I started giving out samples to my customers. I am not only getting 100% raves, I have taken orders for 13 cheesecakes for thier holiday tables so far and it is only December 2nd!!! Make this cheesecake!

Another delicious cheesecake from Epicurious.com! I think the peppermint is a fresh balance to richness of cheesecake. I omitted the peppermint candies (I don't like "stuff" in my cheesecake), and it was turned out wonderfully rich and creamy. My guests raved about it. I would like to try it sometime with a crust of Girl Scout "Thin Mints"...yum!

We thought this was the worst cheesecake we had ever had. The cream cheese/mint combination did not go well, in our opinion.

Of the one hundred or so cheescakes I have made, this is the only one I did not like. The peppermint has all the subtleness of an airborne mallet. The texture was all wrong too. I did like the crust, though.

Excellent cheesecake! A rich, creamy texture with a wonderful fresh taste. A definite hit with both family and friends. I used SnackWell Mint Cream cookies in the crust and sprinkled crushed peppermint candies on top of the cheesecake while still hot which formed a nice glaze. My son-in-law said that he found only one thing wrong with this cheesecake - - it is so good you want to eat too much!

This cheesecake is wonderful and always receives rave reviews when I make it!! It's a wonderful holiday dessert. I've also made the crust using Thin Mint cookies, which is yummy, too.
