This is very good. Key lime is supposed to be tart and this is but it also needed just an added touch of vanilla extract (@ 1/2 tsp) and I added the zest of 4 key limes. This is a really refreshing and palate cleansing sorbet. Served with a sprinkling of toasted coconut.

Fantastic summer desert! Tastes like frozen key lime pie. I followed the recipe exactly except for sugar- I used 1Tbl. cane sugar and 1tsp. Stevia. It turned out perfect!

This recipe was simple and easy. I used 5 tahitian limes (we have a tree), mixed the ingredients as shown and stuck it in the freezer. I don't have an ice cream maker, so I just took it out every hour and gave it a stir. It was still nice and smooth, not too tart, not icy at all.

It took me about a pound of Key limes to get a cup of juice, for what it's worth. It was too tart for us - more sugar and/or less juice might help next time. Otherwise, great texture, good concept.

Wonderful and easy! Be sure to use Key Lime juice to make it just right - - not too sweet or tart. Follow directions completely by putting sorbet in freezer for a few hours. I wound up serving Key Lime Soup by not doing so. Will definately make again!

This sorbet was great, just a tad too sweet. I agree that a touch of vanilla may add to its yumminess. Next time I may try a little less extra sugar. The texture was wonderful. It came out very soft from my ice cream maker, but froze into a perfectly creamy sorbet.

I agree with Lakewood, this recipe was just a tiny wee bit too tart. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly, but poured it into a store bought graham cracker crust, which was not a good compliment (too sweet) for the acidity of it. The second time I made it, I used low fat sweetened condensed milk, and substitued lemon juice in place of roughly 1/3 of the lime. Much better. While this is quite lovely and nice, however, I still prefer the grape sorbets also found on this site, which is milder, prettier, and easier/faster to make. (Of course, using bottled lime instead of juicing approximately 30 of those tiny little key limes might have cut back on my time for this one too! But the grape is STILL faster.)

This was awesome! I used regular lime juice as we didn't have key limes and it still came out great. The only addition I used was a small amount of vanilla exctract. Everyone loved it. Next time, I will make a nice graham cracker tuile for decoration.

This is really good - I don't believe it's "beyond compare" but it is really good - 3.5 forks. I wondered about all of the sugar in it since most key lime pie recipes don't add sugar beyond the sweetened condensed milk. However, it is very tart - next time, I would cut the key lime juice to 3/4 cup. I like key lime desserts tart but mine was on the edge of mouth puckeringly too tart.

Made this for the 4th of July and it was a hit. Even my 3 year old grandson said "it's delicious!" Very creamy texture and just the right amount of tartness. Made exactly as recipe directed.

I made this for a large party - I bought little pastry shells (like tiny ice cream cones - Siljans brand) and put some graham cracker crumbs in the shell, then a little scoop of the sorbet, and more graham cracker crumbs on top. These were the hit of the party!

This is an incredible sorbet. Easy to make and it tastes just like the filling of a key lime pie. My husband liked it so much he called his dad while eating the first serving to tell him he'd found an easy replacement for their favorite pie! We ate it in ice cream cones. Next time we'll try the graham crackers and whipped cream.
