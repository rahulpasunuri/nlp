Really great way to the use canned octopus that was in my pantry. I finished the dish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to give it brightness. I really liked the way the potatoes soaked up the flavors.

Delicious, quick recipe. I used lima beans instead, yum. Next time I'd cut down on the potatoes, not skimp on the parsley and maybe throw in a few sliced olives as well. Perfect for a quick weekday meal.
