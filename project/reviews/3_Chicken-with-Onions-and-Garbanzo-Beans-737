To add more flavour use chicken broth instead of water and throw in a couple of dried limes (available at middle eastern groceries).

I thought it completely tasteless. I ended up adding loads of pepper, lime juice and spicy pickled eggplant relish just to add enough zip to make it palatable. I probably won't make it again, no reason to but maybe curry pwder, rather than just turmeric would help.

The flavor of this dish was incredible. I used 2# of boneless, skinless chicken and dried parsley and cilantro and it still turned out good!
