I made this, as written, for a Bastille Day-themed picnic. Everyone loved it. I'd definitely make this again, without changing a thing.

I plan to use this for a new year buffet party. I'll use wraps instead, which I plan to cut into 3/4 slices, held in place with a toothpick. not quite pan bagnat, but I hope it will be one with a twist, and not as messy.

Great make ahead picnic and 1st camping day food. When I need to make for "the multitudes" I scale the ingredients up and place on a horizontally sliced large ciabotta or boule. Be sure to use a quality tuna packed in olive oil as discussed below; nothing wrong with adding olive tapenade instead of sliced olives either. Wrap in plastic wrap, weigh down with a heavy pot and put in fridge until ready to embark. Divine!!

Not bad!! I was just about to throw away my cans of tuna - turned out they were those nice chunky albacore, too. This recipe saves the day. I took a lot of liberties in the recipe, only use red onion, use a whole lemon worth of juice, use kalamata olive instead, have spinach instead of lettuce. Definitely need to make it to be a salad and just have the bread on the side. There is no way I can eat this as a sandwich and enjoy it without dropping all over the place. This will become my default canned tuna recipe.

An absolutely delicious sandwich. It really depends on the bread you use however: I used very hearty, crusty rolls which I hoped would soak up some of the liquid. The lettuce formed a barrier, though, so my sandwiches were a bit unwieldy, even after pressing them down. Next time I'll put the tuna mixture right on the bread. Messy, but a winner.

You can get the Progresso tuna in olive oil for about $2-$3. It is well worth it. A little sloppy, but very delicious. More of a dinner sandwich than a lunch meal.

I've made this several times now, adding or omitting ingredients depending on what I have in my fridge. I use shallots and red onion and lots of freshly ground pepper - with great bread, this sandwich is delicious and sophisticated, and everyone loves it!

I made this for husband's lunch (since I'm not a fish fan) and prepared it as a salad (as suggested by other reviewers). It does seem a bit wet to put on bread unless you're serving immediately, but he absolutely loved it.

This is great, but I agree that you must use crusty bread. I omitted the anchovies (I included them on my husband's) and we loved it.

This is a great recipe considering we are talking tuna fish salad. After trying different breads, all unsatisfactory (I guess the French really know how to make bread), the recipe has evolved into a salad on a plate with bread on the side. It is easier to eat that way. It makes a wonderful presentation and brings exclamations of delight when served. Better than what we had in Nice recently. I use Progresso tune in Light oil and no it doesn't cost $10. The person from Easton, Pa's comment makes no contribution and skews the numbers. I'm trying to be kind as to what I realy think of a comment like that.

would never consided spending $ 10. 00 for tuna

Delicious! However, use a baguette or a bread that will absorb moisture. I used what I had on hand (plain white bread -- my mistake) and it didn't hold up well. The tuna mixture and the garnish were just awsome!

Absolutely delicious. Tuna in olive oil is exorbitantly expensive in Singapore, so we compromised by draining the vegetable oil and marinading the tuna in high quality olive oil and chopped onions. The capers made the sandwich too salty, but the rest of the ingredients melded well together. Am still trying to find the right kind of bread though.

My boyfriend's mom taught me how to make a variation of this, which she has always called the Mediterranean Tuna Sandwich. We have never used the eggs, anchovies, scallions, or radishes. We do add capers, and drizzle the bread with the vinegar-oil mixture. Fresh, ripe tomatoes are indeed essential to this!

Help! I can't find my Feb. 2001 Gourmet! I'm going to Nice and would like the name of the restaurant featured in this issue that makes the best Pan Bagnat in Nice. I think her name is Maria, but I don't remember any other details, such as name of the restaurant and location. Merci beaucoup to anyone who can help!

Yum!!! This combination is super. The flavors work together, but you can taste individual elements as you eat it. Very messy. Finding the right bread is a challenge even here in Seattle. My husband keeps talking about how we need to make these again and again.

This is a fantastic sandwich! So much fun to make and eat. A combination of ingredients that works really well together. Great for picnics.

We love this!!! We have made this recipe several times since its debut in the February 2001 issue, and the preparation is always a fun, family affair. Have plenty of napkins on hand, and brace yourself for a messy, yummy, joy of a meal!

This sandwich was great fun, to make and to eat. It's messy - filling dribbles out, along with pieces of egg, but the crusty rolls are essential, and add to the overall taste. A restaurant could stake it's reputation on this sandwich on it's lunch menu. I just didn't have oil-packed tuna in the house, but I did have an excellent quality olive oil, so I added extra.

Unlike Calvin, I can't jet off to Nice when the urge for a pan bagnat strikes but this is certainly the next best thing. The 1st time I used tuna but the following weekend I smoked some fresh trout and used the leftovers with great success. (There is a typo - should be 1, 6 ounce can of tuna, not a 16 ounce can.) Thanks
