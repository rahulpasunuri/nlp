At my Super Bowl party, I was a little pressed for time and used my favorite store bought pizza dough. Then I boiled in the baking soda and baked. They turned out amazing!

I didn't expect these to be so good! We did half of them cinnamon sugar style instead of salt, and they were definitely the favorites. When I make them again, I'll probably do most with cinnamon sugar :)

"The best pretzel I ever had", says the husband. These were easy to make, and very good. Did have a slight sticking problem getting them off the baking sheets, but no big deal. Made the dip with extra-sharp cheddar and added some horseradish mustard for a kick. And you're supposed to cut the rope into six pieces, not 12, so no problems there.

Delicious and so addictive!

Super Bowl will not be the same without these delicious bites of pretzel. Browned up nicely with the soda bath - not as dark as with a lye dip - but that's not food legal in the States. Should have made a double batch - barely had any make it past first 10 minutes. Cheese sauce was nice - added some Tabasco and Worchestshire for a kick. A Definite Hit with kids of all ages...

These were spectacular. I made a double batch for a party and they were gone in about an hour. I used bread flour and dark brown sugar (it's all I had) and I forgot to add the butter to the dough - not a problem, as they still turned out deliciously. I was not, however, able to cut each rope into 12 pieces. I did 8 instead. Make sure to oil that baking sheet well!
