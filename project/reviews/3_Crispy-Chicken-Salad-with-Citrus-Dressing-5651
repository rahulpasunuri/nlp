Okay, I'm not saying its a good recipe - its not. Please don't waste the time it takes to make it. But how can you rate something if you don't follow the recipe? Making it up as you go along is the beauty of cooking, but if you do please don't comment on it, because what you made is not what you are rating. My biggest pet peeve with this site....

I thought the chicken was tasty but it did not stay crispy at all. I didn't have fish sauce so I skipped it and I used regular flour instead of rice flour. I had leftover lemon sauce from the local Chinese place and poured that over the chicken that was on top of rice. It would have been delicious if it stayed crispy.

This salad was a lot of work and not worth the time. We did enjoy the dressing and may make it again but not the chicken. It didnt remain crispy. Just not a favorite but enjoyable.

I didn't really like this recipe. The batter wasn't crispy and the fish sauce was stronger than I'd hoped (but I don't think I like fish sauce anyway). I would make it on a weekend - the prep is a little long.

Excellent dish! I didn't have the fish sauce and it still tasted fantastic. It is very time consuming - it's the lemon and orange peel that takes for ever. Also, it's not as good the next day as it is hot from the pan. This would be a great summer dish.

I was a little nervous about making the dish because it is deep fried. It seems so unhealthy but is was so good I would make it again. I thought the dressing was alittle strong. I would probably modify that next time. It also took along time to prepare - I would make it on a weekend next time when I have more time.

The recipe looked good, but the result was even better. A great dish, although a little time-consuming to prepare. My wife, our daughter and I ate the salad, while our teenage boys (who frown upon salad) loved the chicken all by itself.

This dish was a lot of work in terms of preparation, but well worth the result. YUM!
