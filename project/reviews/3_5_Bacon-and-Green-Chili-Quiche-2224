If it isn't New Mexican, Hatch Green ChilE it's not Green ChilE Quiche! Canned won't do! This is a great recipe, ccok that bacon really crisp and do us Hatch Gree ChilE! By the way, New Mexican's don't spell chile with an "i" at the end!

Awesome! I doubled the amount of green chilies (and I made sure to get the ones labeled "hot") and also increased the bacon. This took FOREVER to cook but in the end it was all worth it. It looked nice and tasted fantastic. Everyone loved it!

OK,OK,I know how everyone feels about a reviewer that didn't follow the recipe, but here I go anyway.Made this for a co- worker's birthday.She is on South Beach so I made it crustless, used turkey bacon (really? where on the turkey is that?), used whole milk rather than half and half, doubled the green chillies--used half hot and half regular and added a little garlic powder.People LOVED it and wanted the recipe. I was stunned. It was good, but I'm still freaked out about that turkey bacon. I will make it again, but closer to the original recipe.

This is a perfect quiche, I have been serving it for years. I am not a fan of eggs in general and cannot stomach most quiches. This one is so flavorful and delicious, you do not even taste the egg. I make this quiche for weeknight dinners as well as Saturday breakfasts and Sunday brunches. Serve it with your favorite salsa. Your guests will flip for it!

Great recipe and so easy to make. After making a few times, I use the Mary Callendar's deep dish frozen pie crust and drain the green chiles thoroughly. Most recently made 4 at one time -- 2 without the bacon, and it was just as popular with my guests as those with the bacon.

I used 1.5 cups cheddar and .5 cup parmesan cheese because that's what I had on hand. I also did not have diced green chilis (we usually have them in the pantry, but apparently we're out). Also went crustless. My family found this to be EXTREMELY salty. I don't think the cheese substitution would have made *that* much impact, so I would recommend cutting the salt in the custard by half, if not all together.

I used frozen pie crust, and split the reciepe in half between the two crusts that came in the package. To pease the crowd I made one with less of the diced chili than called for; and next time I am thinking of diceing one fresh jalapeno instead of using the canned. Was a hit at a bacon themed party.

This recipe is a great twist on quiche. The only changes that I made to the recipe was to use Pepper Jack instead of Monterey Jack and to add a spoonful of flour to the egg base. I don't typically eat a lot of spicy foods, but I thought that the green chilies provided a nice glow. My partner is already asking when I am going to make this quiche again, and we've not even finished with the leftovers from the first one!

I've made this quiche at least a dozen times now. It's one of my "go-to" weeknight dinner recipes...super easy to prepare, smells great in the oven and always a hit. I serve it with mixed greens with shallot red wine viniagrette. If you are vegetarian, just omit the bacon and it will still taste great. I definitely recommend using a store-bought pie crust, there is no need to go crazy making your own here as the filling is really the star. And almost every time I have made it, I've used fat free half and half (in my attempt to lower the calories!) and it comes out just fine.

Rating: 4
Very good. Easy to make. A jalapeno would be a good addition. Otherwise, tasty. I tossed the shredded cheese with a tablespoon of flour to avoid the problem mentioned by some reviewers of the cheese rising to the top. Just used whole milk not half and half.

This was a big hit at my brunch. Sauteed some yellow onion (forgot the green) and added some red bell pepper for color. Used applewood smoked bacon, which definately added to the flavors. Also used a store-bought frozen pie crust (deep dish) but had too much filling, so I lightly oiled a ramekin and am enjoying my own individual quiche as I write. Will definately make again.

Rating: 3
I made this to take for lunch during the week, and thought it was great. It's flavorful, creamy, filling, and really easy to prepare. I left out the green onions (doh! forgot them), and also made it crustless because I think quiches reheat better sans crust. I will definitely make it again

Rating: 3
Easy and quick weeknight meal. I used a combination of whole milk and half and half with good results. The recipe uses pantry staples (if you live in NM at least!) and along with a green salad is a filling and pleasant meal.

Love this recipe...left out green chilis...

Very simple and tasty weeknight dinner. I did alter the recipe somewhat by adding an extra can of diced green chilies and halving the number of strips of bacon. We will definitely make this again! Served with salsa and a green salad.

Just perfect- a little too perfect. I and everyone else want to eat the whole thing and that's not good... I left out the onions too. Do not like the onions...

Yummy I make this quiche often and it's always a hit. I took it to work for a potluck and it was the first dish cleaned out. The ultimate compliment. If the green chilis are too bland for you try a chopped jalepeno. It definitely adds a kick.

I've made this quiche many times in the last few years and the whole family loves it. I do make a few changes though. I use cream instead of half and half and jalapenos instead of canned green chilis. Yum!

Very good and leftovers are great. I used a purchased crust, buttered and chilled for 30 minutes, in lieu of prebaking. I added 2 minced garlic cloves, used minced onion (no green onions on hand but think they'd be great), two cans of drained chilis, and a bit more bacon than called for. I always add 1 tablespoon flour per cup of half and half whenever I make quiche and it gives the custard the same consistency as one made withe heavy cream. Did not put any salt in custard mix as the bacon adds plenty. A keeper!

I used a store bought pie crust to save time and added chopped green onions to the ingredients. Result was absolutely delicious. This one goes into my favorites recipe file!

Ick. I'm a bonafide quiche lover, but this recipe just did not do it for me. Just as with "Gwen from New Hampshire" I found this quiche to be bland and overly salty. The cheese bubbled to the top and formed a brown crust. The custard had the texture of a wet sponge. If anyone makes this in the future, I'd recommend using fresh jalapenos or serranos (and lots of them) instead of canned chilis, add more bacon and leave out the salt in the custard blend. As for myself, I will use the custard base from the "ham, leek and three-cheese quiche" recipe on this site to build upon if feel like a southwest-style quiche in the future.

Rating: 4
It's now a staple - for breakfast, brunch and dinner. I probably make it too much now. :+)

Rating: 4
This was my first quiche and it turned out wonderfully. To save time, buy shredded cheese and pre-cooked bacon, which will taste just as great. I like that this recipe calls for a thin crust baked in a glass dish - makes it much tastier than the heavy-crusted quiches you find in restaurants.

Rating: 3
This was a great brunch dish. I never had a southwestern quiche, and I thought it was perfect. Instead of bacon, Canadian bacon works better so it's not too smoky.

This is a quick & easy recipe. My friends and husband love it. Used Athens mini tart shells for an appetizer party and the mini quiches were a huge success. I use fresh jalapenos (or serranos, depending on the dinner guests). Enjoy!

Going to make for Easter Brunch (made before) but am going to serve with a dollup of guacamole instread of spicing up the quiche itself so that it stays kid friendly.

Made this for dinner last evening; my 4-yr old requested the leftovers for her lunch at preschool today. Followed earlier advice of using double the green chiles; also used turkey bacon, egg beaters, and NF milk to cut down on fat--there was no discernable difference in taste/texture.

My husband and son gave me the old "real men don't eat quiche" attitude, but admitted they loved it! I added 2 extra slices of bacon and an 8 oz. can of green chilis in place of 4 oz. Also, I didn't have green onions, substituted a shallot with a tbl. of dried chives. DELICIOUS!! This is a gem - very flavorful.

We all LOVED this Quiche. The flavors were wonderful together. Of course, being in New Mexico I used fresh chiles and doubled the amount of them. Our guests all asked for seconds. The texture was especially tender and it was soooo easy to bake for a brunch ! Thanks to whoever contributed this recipe. A REAL CROWD PLEASER !!!

I have made this recipe several times to rave reviews from my husband (a self-described "real man who doesn't eat quiche"). I have found that it turns out best if you buy high-quality, thick-cut bacon from a butcher or farmer's market. To any cooks in the Midwest, I prefer the Ozark bacon that you can get at your local butcher.

This reminded us of a recipe you'd find in one of those Pillsbury or Kraft "meals in minutes" recipe leaflets they sell at the grocery store checkout. We prepared it exactly as written and found it to be very, very bland. Also, it didn't have a true quiche consistency. The cheese bubbled to the top and formed a brown top crust. The egg and milk mixture beneath had the texture of a wet sponge. I can think of many things that could be done to improve this recipe, but I'd rather just use my own basic quiche recipe and throw in some green chiles and spices if I want a "southwestern" style quiche.

Added tomatoes and green peppers. Reduced bacon to six slices and did not add any salt. My family loved it.

Very easy and very tasty. Fluffy and light. I'll add some pepper jack cheese next time for a little kick. The basic recipe is flavorful, but I like a little spice. Could probably even add some diced jalapenos for extra zip! I also added diced fresh tomatos which added color and flavor.

Definately will make this one again, very good, although I did cut the bacon down to six pieces.

This has become a family recipe since it first came out in Bon Appetit in June of 1996. We've made it with Mexican chorizo instead of bacon - delicious.

Rating: 4
This has become a staple for during-the-week dinners at our house. Sometimes it's a little too salty with all the bacon, though, so you shouldkeep that in mind if you add extra salt. But it's one of the tastiest quiches I've ever had.

Rating: 3
WOW, this is really wonderful and so easy! I made a crustless version and turned the oven down to 350 - cooked for 45 minutes and it came out perfect. I cut one of the cheeses down to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of feta cheese because I love it in quiche. I used pepper jack instead of regular. I also added some fresh parsley. I usually like quiche with more ingredients (veggies) but this is so simple and tasty. Next time I will add more chilies because I like things on the spicy side. I will be making this again very soon. Try this...you will not be dissapointed!

I just tried this recipe, and I thought it was fantastic. My husband thought it was a bit to spicy, so I ended up eating the whole thing myself (over almost a week, of course). I adjusted the recipe by using 7oz green chilis, adding 1 jalepeno, and using low fat jack and cheddar cheese. Next time I'm going to try to cut back on the eggs, using a substitue or whites.

I made this for a brunch yesterday and received rave reviews. I used pepper jack cheese, extra sharp cheddar and added sliced tomatoes for color.

This dish was very yummy- had lots of flavor. If using a frozen pie crust, I suggest cutting the recipe down to fit: 6 strips bacon, 1/2 cup of monterey jack and chedder, 3/4 cup half and half, 3 eggs. I ended up with extra because the frozen pie is not in a deep dish.

This was good. I also used pepper jack and increased the chilies. I added avocado and used a tortilla crust rather than pastry. It is great served with sour cream and salsa. Oh, I also added a touch of chili powder. Yum.

Instead of bacon, I used 3/4 cups chopped cooked chicken (leftover) and 1/2 cup chopped jalapeno peppers, seeded with homemade salsa on the side. It was a big hit also at the office breakfast. Anyone making quiches should use frozen deep dish pastry shells (Mrs. Smith is my brand of choice, they are made with vegetable shortening and come 3 in pack) unless you are a fanatic for scratch cooking. I am southerner by lineage, but I also work and choose to eat well and be time sensitive. So if someone builds a better mousetrap that will save money and I am their best customer. Same with the cheeses, why waste time shredding, when someone can do the job, and hey you can come from work and make a quiche, what a treat for your family.

I thought this dish was perfect just the way the recipe called for, especially when serving it to guests that may not like real spicy food. It was very simple to make. I cooked the bacon the day before, and grated the cheese, which made assembling the day of a very quick and easy process.

YUMMY! I made a couple of modifications; on the advice of others, I doubled the green chilies, and I used Pepperjack cheese instead of the Monterey and Cheddar cheeses.

I think it is an excellent dish. I agree that the crust should be baked at the same time as the quiche. I like to roll my crust on a board that has been dusted with baby oatmeal. It makes the crust much flakier and compliments the quiche.

Excellent! Very easy to make & delicious. Made this for our Mothers Day Brunch today & everyone loved it. I used a 7-oz.can of green chiles & a 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. Don't cook the crust first, it cooks much faster then the filling, & I had to put foil around it after the first 20 min.

use 7-oz, can green chilies, add 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 1/4 tsp. Tabasco. Serve Salsa on the side for more flavor. Not necessary to prebake crust. Bake at 375 degrees. 1 cup shredded cheese is more like 3 oz. Try using Monterey Jack cheese with jalepenos to spice it up. Otherwise very good.
