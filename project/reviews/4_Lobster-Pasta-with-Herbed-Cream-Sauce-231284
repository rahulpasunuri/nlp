After reading all the reviews and looking up several more lobster & pasta recipes, I adjusted down to serve the 2 of us for Valentine Day dinner. Used 2 lobster tails, which I sauteed in a bit of butter & EVOO, removed the meat and pan roasted a small container of grape tomatoes, then added the garlic and used dried herbs with the wine,tomato paste and vinegar. I used 1 1/2 c of heavy cream and about 1 c of half & half and let it simmer nearly 2 hrs. Also added about 1T of Better than Bouillon lobster base, which really upped the flavor. Served with the pasta and an endive/radicchio salad, and followed up with the chocolate mousse from BA. Over the top dinner! Might not make it again for us, but would highly recommend to others!

YUM!! Everyone that ate this dish had that to say after the first bite! This is a rich and delicious special dish. I made it as written, but let the sauce simmer and infuse for about an hour and added a splash or two of sherry at the end. So fab!

Made this for Christmas Eve as a main dish for three people. I used two 1.25 lb lobsters and reduced the amount of cream in the sauce to about 3 cups, but used the original amount of the other ingredients (except that I subbed 4 canned plum tomatoes in puree for the fresh ones called for). This created a great balance between cream and tomato flavor and I would do it the same way if I made it again. I allowed the sauce to simmer with the lobster shells for about 3 hours and used it to sauce about 12 ounces of freshly made pappardelle. This was simply marvelous. The lobster flavor was deeply infused in the sauce - to the point where you really didn't need the chunks of lobster meat (although they were divine). Rich, silky, luscious - it was everything you want from a special occasion pasta dish.

Rich and delicious. I used lobster tails and steamed them, which made it very easy. I'm so thankful for the comments on this site. Thanks to them, I added a shallot while sautéing the lobster shells, as well as a 28 oz can of San Marzano tomatoes (that I liquified with an immersion blender before adding them). I also followed the suggestion of using a salad spinner to get the last bits of sauce from the shells.

I will be making this recipe again and again for special occasions. Thought I'd pass on a tip on a kitchen technique that worked well. After simmering the sauce I let it cool down a bit then I put it all in my salad spinner. After spinning it a few rounds I had all the sauce in the bowl and the lobster shells were clean as can be and I tossed them in the garbage. What a simple way to get every last bit of sauce off the shells in 20 seconds flat.

I made this dish for the first time last night, and it was a big hit with my husband and guests. I really didn't change a thing but did use a whole 6oz can of tomato paste, and a 28oz can of diced Marzano tomatoes as suggested by other reviewers. Added red pepper flakes for a little kick. Used a pint of heavy cream and a pint of half-and-half, which wasn't enough as the sauce reduced much more than I anticipated. But I did stir in half a container of cream fraiche at the end, and garnished with chopped tarragon. Next time I will use fettucini not linguini; I think the wider noodles present better. Served with a simple mizuna and arugula salad and paired with awhile burgundy: heaven!

I altered the recipe to two servings by using four 3oz. lobster tails. For the sauce, I just used half portions of the ingredients which left me with a generous amount of sauce that I could use for later. I agree with one of the reviewers that using San Marzano tomatoes was better. I used about a cup and a half of the crushed version. I also cooked the sauce for over an hour and put in about a 1/2 cup of the liquid from cooking the lobster. After the sauce was strained, I added one chopped plum tomato, some sliced baby portabella mushrooms and some creme fraiche. It was amazing!

I have been making this recipe for many years, since the bon appetite printed it. Thought it would be interesting to see the comments on it since it is one of my favorite dishes. Commenters are correct, it needs much more tomato. add one can of 28once finely pureed san marzano italian plum tomatoes. Cream amount is fine. use the whole lobster to infuse the flavor, simmering uncovered on low for as long as you can, say at least 4hours. don't scorch the sauce. The sauce is thiner with the extra tomato sauce, so use tomato past to thicken, or if you want to go over the top, add one 8oz of creme fraiche to thicken. 2nd is my preference. lastly, to serve, add pasta to a saute pan, and then cover with sauce and stir to ensure the sauce is nicely on the pasta before platting. grated pecorino on top and enjoy

I liked the way the lobster shells and herbs flavored the cream but in my view it was a bit too creams so I doubled the tomato paste and tomatoes and thought it came out very nice. I also added some shrimp.

Excellent! Made recipe exactly as stated including the roe with a few additions - added some red pepper flakes, basil, just little bit of sugar, a fair amount of salt & pepper and some extra granulated garlic (will add more fresh garlic next time). Turned out SO tasty. Looking forward to making again sooner than later. I'm adding it to my recipe book!

This was a perfect addition to a New England Christmas dinner. It was so delicious and definitely a keeper. I made this as part of our surf and turf dinner for Christmas day. Rib eyes were the turf. I bought precooked lobster with no shells before I read the recipe more closely (oops) but then went back and bought 6-8 whole shrimp (couldn't find just shells) and prepped the sauce the night before with them instead. I warmed up the sauce with the lobster meat the night of and it worked great--I can only imagine how much better it would have been with actual lobster shells. In retrospect I should have halved this recipe because I now have a lot left over--it's quite heavy and rich so a little went a long way.

I used this as part of the "feast of 7 fishes" for Christmas Eve and it was outstanding. I recommend steaming the lobsters in 1" of water, instead of boiling them.

Delicious!! ~ I had two left over lobsters and made this sauce-Wow! I did not strain the sauce before adding the lobster. I picked out the shells instead which left the tomato and garlic and added the lobster. Also, I made just for two so only used 2 cups of heavy cream. My husband says that this is a keeper!

Really delicious and comes together quickly and easily. My friends and I were very surprised by the amount of flavor the lobster shell gives to the sauce.

Used lobster tails instead of whole lobster. Easier, I think. The aroma of the herbs simmering in the cream is wonderful. Very rich, decadent sauce.

I probably shouldn't be reviewing this but did want to comment. I used the basic sauce to go with scallops and shrimp over pasta. I used the wine, tomato paste, cream and parsley. It was great and made a nice light fresh pasta sauce which I will definitely make again.

This dish was wonderful as a first course on Christmas Day. I substituted shrimp for the lobster since 2 of my guests are not lobster lovers. The recipe turned out fine. I merely sauteed the fresh shrimp in olive oil and garlic, seasoning with salt and pepper. Once the sauce was prepared I added the shrimp during the sauce rewarming step. When I made this dish the second time I tripled the amount of herbs for a more hearty flavor.

This is one of the best recipes I have ever made. Made homemade linguine and boiled tails and used the shells for sauce. More meat and more bang for the buck than whole lobsters. The sauce is so flavorful and very rich. Best for a beginning course than main meal. I did cut the amount of cream. Used 2 cups for half recipe. It is a winner! If you love lobster you will love this. Make your own noodles though...big plus!

OMG, this was delicious. I served this as a main course for Christmas Eve dinner and it was really to die for. I followed the recipe pretty closely but adjusted the ingredients and the technique a bit. (1) I used slightly more pasta (27 oz. of FRESH fettucine) (2) I sauted the garlic and a minced shallot with the lobster shells before adding the tomato paste (3) I used cognac instead of white wine, deglazing the pan with it and the vinegar before adding the cream and herbs, and (4) I salted everything along the way. Notes: 6 cups was NOT too much cream at all....I sauted the pasta in the sauce before serving to let everyting soak in. Also, I used fresh pasta so maybe that made the difference here? I can't imagine this being even half as good without sauteeing the shells/bodies first and letting them simmer in the sauce for a good while....how else would the lobster flavor infuse the sauce? This is going to become our new Christmas Eve tradition!

SOOOO DELICIOUS! I made this for my cooking club and it was a hit. I followed the recipe as stated except I used dried herbs and added the cognac as suggested . The best part is that my local fish market steamed the lobster and removed the meat and roe for me. They gave me back the shells and bodies for the sauce which I think was well worth the effort. I would make this again in a heartbeat.

DELICIOUS and easy. Made this with store-bought artichoke ravioli, and substituted bay scallops for lobster, which made it quite a bit cheaper and easier. As others have said, we doubled the herbs, used 4c half-half, simmered for 25 min and added a splash of cognac. Simple enough for any weeknight, and crazy good!

Rating: 3
Pretty good. As others have said, cut down on the whipping cream, you only need 4c max. I also added a few more sprigs of each of the herbs as suggested, and added some Cognac which someone else suggested (good call!) and was liberal in salt and pepper throughout. The end result: definitely a good dish. The cream sauce is mellow, which is fine - you don't always need a huge punch. I infused using the unharvested mini-legs of the critter as well as the shell, so that probably helped in the taste as well.

Fabulous! A great recipe to prepare the night before a party. I made six servings, rather than ten, so reduced the ingredients accordingly, with exception of the herbs. I also added one more clove of garlic. I simmered the cream (4 cups) for about 25 minutes to get the right consistency for the sauce. This is a fun and easy recipe to make and was a huge hit with my guests.

I only gave this recipe 3 forks because I really did not follow it, so I can not testify to its true flavor. I omitted the tarragon, added lemon juice and scallions. I used scallops in lieu of lobster (hey they looked great and I could not walk away). I used twice as much garlic, but that is a personal preference and much less cream.

I should have added that I followed some of the tips from past reviewers such as less cream, more herbs, salt, fresh pepper and a splash of cognac doesn't hurt either! You do have to "adjust" seasoning or cut down on cream to taste.

Perfect for a dinner party. I would actually recommend making day ahead not only to save time on the day of your party but the sauce actually tastes so much better the second day! I served it on black (squid-ink) fettucini that I can buy fresh at a local market. Looks beautiful on the black pasta. Very flavorful, beautiful sauce. Everyone felt like they dined at the finest restaurant. And I was relaxed because it was mostly done day ahead! Bonus all around plus simply delicious. Can't go wrong!

One of our favorites! Excellent first course for a dinner party. We serve this every new year's eve and everyone raves. I serve a full bodied Chardonnay or a nice Pinot Noir with it. Looks and tastes wonderful but is not difficult to make. Can do all ahead and assemble before serving.

If I could give this 5 forks I would! I made this for an intimate dinner party for 6. The key to a really delicious sauce is simmering the lobster shells in the cream sauce so the lobster flavor infuses the dish. I reduced the amount of cream after reading several reviews. The sauce can easily be made the day before and warmed up with the lobster pieces right before serving; I also added some large prawns to the dish. This was so good!

Have made this dish several times, but NEVER boiled the lobster. This recipe calls for overcooking it, which leads to rubbery meat. Instead, cut up the lobster and saute in the shells, remove the meat from the shells, then proceed with the recipte.

I added vanilla to the recipe-excellent, easy, my guests went nuts for this. I used three pounds of pasta and there was more than enough sauce...highly recommend this recipe for a party.

Tasty, elegant and easy (once you harvest the lobster meat) sauce to make. As other reviewers have noted, using the lobster bodies and shells to make the broth is essential. Six cups of cream is way too much -- three-four is plenty. Salt and pepper is necessary, and in the future I might try adding a pinch of saffron. Also, for color and texture, I added lightly sauteed asparagus tips which made it just beautiful in the bowl. Everyone enjoyed this dish when I served it. And it IS really easy to make! Cheers.

Needed a lobster dish I could make ahead and throw together quickly at my daughter's place for a surprise b'day party. This was perfect! Using the lobster bodies and shells gives the sauce a wonderful flavor and, yes, the dish does need salt to bring out the flavor. Skipped the roe (too rubberyfor our tastes) but chopped up some of the fresh herbs for a bit of green garnish. A very rich sauce, served with a green salad and dry white wine.

Such a disappointment. I waited 3 weeks from the time I found this recipe to make it, dreaming of it the entire time, and....not horrible, not excellent, just not worth it. One thing worth noting however: if you are seeking a basic tomato cream sauce (to which anything, really, could be added)this is fine. As is, it is quite bland but not bad tasting; you could punch it up with more herbs or hot pepper, etc.

Very good recipe for a dinner party - my friends raved and demanded doggy bags. I made the sauce the day before, exactly as stated, except I added a bit more wine when I was cooking the lobster shells. It makes what looks like a lot of sauce, but once you combine it with the al dente pasta the pasta absorbs a bit of the sauce. Does the sauce turn a lovely pink color when crab is used?

I made this dish on Christmas Eve and was disappointed. I followed the directions as written, and although the sauce was rich, it did not seem especially flavorful. I don't think I would bother with dealing with the shells and the bodies, as I don't think it made much of a difference. Maybe my expectations were too high on this one.
