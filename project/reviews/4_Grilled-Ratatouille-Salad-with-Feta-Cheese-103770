I liked this salad, but the amount of balsamic vinegar was overpowering. When I grilled the veggies with the garlic oil they looked and tasted amazing, but then I added 2 Tbsp of balsamic and suddenly a lot of that amazing grilled flavor disappeared. I think next time I would just use 2-3 tsps of balsamic; I also agree with the person that said goat cheese might work better. the feta was a bit strong for this recipe, especially when mixed with the balsamic. Will make again but substitute goat cheese and use way less balsamic. (liked the basil). I think the amounts might depend on whether you are using this as a salad to eat on it's own, or as a spread on bread; I think that with the amount of vinegar suggested, it would've been great if it was spread on bread, but as a "salad" it was just too overpowering.

Great salad, had more flavor than I thought it would after reading the ingredients. Like other reviewers, I used minced garlic in olive oil instead of the garlic-flavored olive oil. I also cut the vegetables up after grilling.

This was my attempt to expand my veggie world and try eggplant. Pretty good. Just for the sake of eating, I'd probably cube everything after cooking.

This was excellent and easy. I didn't have the grill, so put all the veggies in a zip loc with tbsp of olive oil, shook up, then roasted in the oven at 425 for about 15 mins. The balsamic, feta and basil really make the dish. The boyfriend, who "doesn't eat eggplant or zucchini" loved it, stating that it was better than the meat or the rissotto that night. Quick and delicious!

I made this last night for guests, my husband was grilling a roast, so I grilled the veggies ahead of time. Then added balsamic, goat cheese and basil just before serving. It was really good and super easy.

This is so very good even made in a pan, it is a great way to use greens from the kitchen garden when you get odds and ends and nothing enough to make a dedicated dish. You can change and add veggies and it is still good.

Unique & bold flavor twist on the summer grilled vegetable. Veggies are flexibly interchangeable for local/seasonal availability. -We used mushrooms, green beans, red onion & Chinese eggplant. (May dominate over main course if served as a side.)

This is simply delicious. I used balsamic vinegar and goat cheese insetad of feta. I thought goat cheese compliments the flavors better. Definitely a keeper.

This was fantastic and easy to make. I didn't know how great eggplant could taste. I could see this used in a pita pocket as well. Will make again!

Great ratio of effort to taste. Wonderful summer meal.

This was a great summery meal. I chopped the veggies after they were grilled and tossed them and the cheese with pasta.

I have made this dish dozens of times and always with rave reviews. I chop all of the veggies at the end, add the feta, balsamic and I add a bit of olive oil and toasted pine nuts along with the basil. Soooo good!

I prepared this recipe as written. It is a good way to make use of produce from a summer garden. The salad does not keep well so make only as much as can be eaten during the meal.

I've made this a couple of times -- when the vegetables are perfectly cooked, there are few things that are better. Use good ingredients. Leftovers are great in a sandwich, with meat or without.

My husband and I really liked this recipe. I did make one change -- after grilling the veggies, I chopped them up and then tossed all the ingredients together. Delicious.

This is fantastic, and so easy for summer grilling! Will definitely make this again. I tend to get bored with grilled vegetables, but the balsamic vinegar and feta make this a keeper.

I've been on a vegetable roasting kick for a couple years since making this. After making it a number of times, I now like to put a little roasted garlic and some [typically unroasted] cherry tomatoes in it as well for a little chaud-froid action. Wonderful with grilled bread.

After I found this recipe a month ago, I've made it frequently. It's easy and delicious. I found some really nice mild Feta from Petaluma that complements it wonderfully. Rather than buy garlic flavored olive oil, I simply crushed a clove of garlic into 3 Tbsp of olive oil.

not a dumb question. the recipe is not clearly written. yes, you should definitely take them off the baking sheet before placing the vegetables directly on the grill. the baking sheet serves as your surface when seasoning your veggies...sounds good though!

Okay, dumb question time, but I have no experience grilling vegetables. Do the veggies stay on the baking sheet and that on the grill or do they go directly on the grill?

A great year round dish and a hit served with steak!The feta is a perfect touch.
