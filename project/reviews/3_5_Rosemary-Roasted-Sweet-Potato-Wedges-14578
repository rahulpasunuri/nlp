I change the directions slightly and put the sweet potatoes in a cold oven, cooking them longer at about 300 and then turning up the heat at the end. I read once that sweet potatoes are sweeter this way. The salt and rosemary produce a delicious flavor with the sweetness.

I've made this many times as per the recipe and we like it that way. But tonight I used half butter and half olive oil for a slightly healthier version. Still delish! (Not sure where the brown sugar came from in the review below this one.)

This recipe was much too sweet for me. Also, the brown sugar burned very easily and made cleaning up a hassle.

This one just doesn't do it for me. Plain old baked sweets are easier. If you want to dress them up use the cinnamon-chili butter elsewhere on this site. Or try the roasted curried ones on this site.

These were so good that I ate half of them myself right from the pan before I could get them on the dinner plates.

Really good and really easy. Mine took longer than 20 minutes to cook, though. I might cut the sweet potatoes into 1/2-inch slices next time.

Wonderful, wonderful alternative to french fries or other oven potatoes. Very easy! I used about twice as much butter and lots of fresh rosemary. Can't wait to try this on company, but I'll definitely make it again this week (maybe tomorrow night?).

I love this recipe, we make it about once a week. If you want the potatoes to cook faster, try slicing them like shoestring fries. We also sometimes use olive oil instead of butter, and add a little salt and pepper. One tip, if you soak the sweet potatoes in water (overnight if possible) they are much easier to slice!

Rosemary is a great compliment to sweet-potato! We really enjoyed this recipe.

I cooked this along side the roasted chicken with rosemary and garlic and it was delicious.

This tastes wonderful. It was very easy to make as well. This was a hit with my mother-in-law so I'll definately keep this recipe in my box!

Very easy recipe! Good results. I made for company and it went over well with a baked pork.

This dish was very good, but I would definitely add more rosemary the next time around. This was extremely easy to prepare! Worth it if you have good sweet potatoes.

I loved this recipe. I did add more butter and it was great. An easy delicious sweet potato dish.

This is an easy, different, and delicious way to make sweet potatoes. I added lots of salt and pepper and drizzled my sweet potatoes with extra virgin olive oil before roasting. I used more fresh rosemary too! It has been a real hit with all I prepared it for.
