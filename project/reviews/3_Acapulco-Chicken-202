This dish is fresh and delicious. I may not make it for guests but I love being able to eat delicious food even if I'm trying to take off a few pounds. It is this type of dish on Epicurious which allows me to keep my girlish figure. Try some of the low fat recipes on this site and you will NEVER even consider another lean cuisine dinner.

I made this for a Mexican themed party using 13 pounds of chicken. I made some spicy and left about 1/3 without the Jalapino Peppers. It was a big hit and several people asked for the Recipe.

I found this dish kind of bland. I ended up with lots of leftovers, so I guess my guests felt the same way. I wouldn't rush to try it again.

This dish is delicious! I had one complaint and it's easy to fix. Instead of adding the chile at the end, add half of it when you put in the chicken the rest where it says. This is a good way to do it because it adds a bit more spice to the taste, but doesn't overpower everything else in it. Good ways to serve it are sliced, with chips or shredded works well too. I also this it tastes good if you shred it and wrap it in a tortilla with some of the onions.

Very tasty as is. It also keeps very well in the refrigerator -- we will definitely be making this again in the future. Yum.

Wonderful recipe: it's delicious, low in calories (you won't miss the fat), and easy to prepare. We made a few changes: we left the chicken breasts whole and served them warm over rice. This was a big hit at our dinner party.

I made this for my children and their friends. They ate the entire dish with their fingers like nachos. It is easy to prepare, and would make a good summer dish for outdoor dining.
