An alternative method would be after soaking overnight shred the fish by hand, mix in the other ingredients (I'd omit the lime peel and salt) and pour very hot oil over every thing and serve hot. I tend to use either Olive Oil or Canola Oil heated until it's smoking, and just enough to be absorbed without excess. Serve with boiled eggs and avocado.
