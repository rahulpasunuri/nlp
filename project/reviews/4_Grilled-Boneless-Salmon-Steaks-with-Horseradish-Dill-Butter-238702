I didn't do the ying/yang string thing. But the butter was amazing!!!!!!! Served with Herbed Pan Seared Polenta cakes. Super YUM!!!! I used half of the butter as other reviewers had and it was spot on! : )

This was delicious! Maybe the best salmon I ever made. I took the advice of the other cooks and cut the butter in half and I still had plenty left over. I was also afraid of so much horseradish so cut cut it down a bit, but then was a little disappointed that it didn't have enough kick. Next time I will use full amount of horseradish. This is my new go-to salmon recipe.

Grilled salmon steaks are always good. The butter recipe was also light and tasty, but agreed, if you cut the butter recipe in half, you'll be better portioned. Served with sauteed garlic & baby spinach.

This is a good and simple recipe. I used salmon fillets. The quantity of butter is way too much so reduce by half or use the leftovers as the other reviewer suggested.

The sauce was bland and did nothing for the salmon.

The Horseradish Dill butter was Excellent! I served the salmon with asparagus and put the butter on both! DELISH! I've started putting it on my steaks too! Adds wonderful flavor to just about any vegetable, fish or meat!

This was good but I felt like there was way too much butter. Very easy though.

I agree, the butter is the recipe for this dish. I did everything for this recipe, but used grated fresh horseradish. I used a little less then a half a cup, because the fresh horseradish is more potent.

The horseradisht butter made the dish. This is a good alternative to lemon if you have people that don't care for it. I seared the fillet in a very hot cast iron pan instead of grilling. Was good, quick and easy.

Outstanding! I used salmon filet, but did everything else according to recipe and we all loved it!

Very yummy, the horseradish dill butter. My boyfriend eats fish only because it's good for him, and he proclaimed it "very edible" and left nothing behind. I think he liked it. ;) I thought it was great, and there's plenty of butter leftover for the nexttime I grill salmon. The steaks look great made this way, but it wasnt worth the effort vs the $ saved (to me) to bother boning the fish myself the nexttime. A filet from the store would do just as well I think, unless I was trying to impress someone with my culinary artistry. I imagine the butter works with other fish, too. Definitely a keeper.
