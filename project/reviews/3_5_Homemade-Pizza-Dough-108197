I have a magazine clipping with pizza dough "adapted from a recipe by Chris Bianco". It required 2 packs of dry yeast, 4.5 to 5.5 cups flour, 2 cps. water & 2 tsp. salt. I let it raise in the fridge for a day. This was the best pizza dough I ever made, & I started making dough as a kid. Perhaps because it has more water, less flour and the slow, cold rising. A Keeper!

I made the dough and prepared it as per the Margherita Pizza's instructions, EXCEPT I differed on the toppings. Let it rise, grill both sides, then put on traditional red pizza sauce, cheese, pepperoni, olives, red & green peppers, onions, Parmesan, cherry tomatoes (halved), and then either grilled or broiled (tried both--both worked fine) until toppings were ready. The final touch was to sprinkle the pizzas with some fresh basil, and most importantly--minced Serrano peppers in place of crushed red pepper. Serranos are hot and spicy, but extremely flavorful. It was a big hit with my sweetie; said it was the best pizza ever.

Great recipe for grilling pizza.

Wonderful Pizza dough! One of the best if you love thin crust. I did this on my Green Egg with a pesto-romano base and can't wait to try new toppings. Thanks Stockton, CA for the tips. I did this with the tin foil as described below and so easy to place on the grill and remove. Crust was nice and crisp.

This dough was fabulous! i love a really thin and crispy pizza and this was perfect. i have never made pizza dough before and found this quite easy to work with. i used whole-grain white flour in the dough and the taste was a perfect pinch of saltiness and a great crisp texture. i may put some rosemary into the crust next time or make a breadstick with this dough. i would recommend cooking for about 4-6 minutes on its own in the oven before topping so that the crust can crisp before the toppings get it "wet".

I tripled this recipe for a dinner party and stretched the pizza rounds in advance. I stacked the rounds between floured parchment and when time came to put them on the grill, they got stuck to the parchment. Some of the pizza rounds were so stuck I had to throw them out!! The ones that made it on the grill were delicious!! Next time I think I'll just wait to stretch the dough until I'm ready to put in on the grill but was hoping for a way to do this step in advance.Any suggestions?

I grilled pizzas for the first time last night on a gas grill and they turned out great! I used the ingredients listed in this recipe, but combined them based on a recipe in the America's Test Kitchen cookbook. Step 1: Combine dry ingredients (flour, salt, yeast) Step 2: Add oil, then warm water (115 degrees) Step 3: Stir to combine, let rest 30 seconds Step 4: Knead in mixer two minutes, then knead by hand approximately 5 minutes Step 5: Divide into two balls, place in oiled bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise for approximately 1 hour. Step 6: After 45-50 minutes, preheat gas grill. Step 7: Prepare two sheets of aluminum foil by brushing them with olive oil. When dough has doubled in size, take each ball of dough, spread it out on the foil in a approximately 9- inch circle. Step 8: Place aluminum foil directly on the grill and cook dough for approximately 4 minutes with the lid closed. If you need to check, wait at least 30-45 seconds between checks. Step 9: When you remove the dough from the grill, brush the top with olive oil and flip so the uncooked side is face down on the foil. Step 10: Add sauce and ingredients to taste. Step 11: Place foil back on grill for another 4 minutes. Remember to cook with the lid closed and you can fold the foil slightly if the edges start to burn. Enjoy!

I agree with ahuss, definitely grill this pizza. We made this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic!

I read the other ratings and wanted to note that this was meant to be grilled, not done in the oven. Results will be different for a grill vs. an oven. Try it again on the grill - you will like it!

The recipe is very easy to make but it's too salty. Next time, I would cut the salt in half. The consistency was very soft and I found that even putting semolina on the pizza stone didn't crisp it enough. As for the sugar -- yeast likes sugar but it's not needed.

i thought this was a really great dough recipe, but next time i would add more olive oil. i baked the pizza on a stone and the crust was very close to that of a purchased pizza. make sure to let your stone preheat for at least an hour.

I've never made pizza dough before and did not know that this recipe is missing sugar, to feed the yeast. Be sure to add some sugar when making this. Because I didn't know, it took overnight for the dough to rise and we ended up eating leftovers instead.

How much less salt and how much more oil?

I, too, added less salt and more oil, and used maple syrup instead of sugar(old Tyler trick). Used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour(being on South Beach) and the result was a really susbstantial, chewy, and fragrant crust. Drizzled with olive oil before putting on grill. Yum.

I added less salt as per a previous reviewer and increased the olive oil. I also used a teaspoon of sugar rather than flour in the original yeast rise. My dough came out silky smooth and was beautiful when I used it to make grilled pizza. The crust crisped up very nicely and still had a wonderful chewiness. I have been making pizza for years and was looking for a new recipe since we started eating thin crust. I think I've found it!

this dough was too salty and hard to handle - did not taste at all like Chris' - his is the best pizza ever!

Instead of a typical "grill" meal, I made this dough for grilled pizza--it came out wonderful--stick with making smaller dough rounds (8")because they can be awkward to flip on the grill. Topped mine with pesto, goat cheese, fresh tomatoes and basil.
