I tweaked this recipe last night and it was absolutely phenomenal! I lived on the Eastern Shore and this, I have to say, turned out better than ANY Crab Imperial I have ever had! Here's what to do, and excuse me if I don't have exact measurements, just made it up as I went along! (FYI: I used dried parsley, and it was fine.) Follow the recipe, but ADD Old Bay (to taste, I used quite a few shakes), approximately 1 Tablespoon lemon juice (maybe a little more), about 1 to 1 and 1/2 inches off a block of cream cheese, and an equal amount of sour cream. I also increased the butter to bread ratio. Then, while they were baking, I made the classic imperial topping using the following: 1/4 cup mayo, one egg, parsley, a touch of yellow mustard and lemon juice, and probably another dash or two of Old Bay. When they come out of the oven, drizzle the topping over and put under the broiler for a few minutes. WOW! It was creamy, decadent, and DELICIOUS! I will be saving this info to use over and over again!

I have to agree with another post this is a crab cake recipe not imperial recipe. This should have a mayo mixture w/lemon and egg on top of the crab and then broiled. This is what I use for a crab cake recipe, and I am from the area and would know better.

We love this recipe. My boyfriend grew up in Delaware so loves a great crab imperial where the crab is the featured component. I don't use bread crumbs, use fat free mayo and have found it's much better when baked in small (8 oz) ramekins. I've made this dish many times with rave reviews!!

Absolutely SUPER. I'm rather 'fussy' as is the rest of my family, particularly about seafood. If you get fresh lump crab and follow with recipe (I do use panko crumbs vs. bread crumbs) you are sure to please. I've made over and over without a hitch.

We enjoyed this recipe, and it was easy to make. Substituted one teaspoon Old Bay Seasoning for salt and used red pepper flakes instead of cayenne. Like others, I did not feel that a food processor was necessary. Will definitely make again.

I did not use a food processor and it turned out wonderful!! I used Old Bay in place of the salt, used ~2 cups white breadcrumbs and it turned out lovely.

I haven't tried this version, yet, but I can tell you, something is off here. The bread is only there to allow you to help form a mound on top of something if you wanted to. Imperial, traditionally, was served to royalty in individual portions (its a perfect appetizer) but its equally delicious as a topping to dress up a main. I have used it many times for special occasions atop poultry, beef, pork, and yes, even seafood. The final mixture or imperial topping should resemble a meringue when cooked. It should be a little tart (wheres the lemon juice?), and spongy (wheres the egg?). This dish should make you reconsider dessert because it in itself is decedent enough. When I was younger my grandmother would fancy up a family crab feast by first steaming some blues, open a dozen or so to pick to make the imperial. She would save the backs. Pick out any inedible parts that remain, save the mustard (hard and soft) to mix into the imperial (this makes it even richer in flavor) and without washing them, stuff the backs with the imperial, add the topping and then bake them. This is so much more impressive to your guests and adds a special touch to any meal. Of course, 30 years ago, growing up within the Chesapeake Bay watershed had its advantages. And by no means would I discourage anyone from trying this recipe as is. But please, do not say it lacked spice, or especially that it was a perfect cake recipe. You are only insulting me and my Grandmother. A Baltimore Native

Being a Maryland girl, I've tasted my share of crab imperial. This one I love because you taste the crab - not a bunch of stuff that has no business being in there. If I want to taste Old Bay, I'll have steamed crabs or perhaps a crab cake.

I used the food processor and found that I probably could have chopped the bread and mixed the other ingredients by hand. Less cleean up this way. I added Old Bay after the fact, so I will include it next time. Quick and easy to make.

What a disappointment. After adding more seasoning, I included finely diced celery, green onion and red pepper in the mix. It could have used a little lemon juice. Most disappointing was the consistency after baking. Mayo's OK when you're frying crab cakes, but it doesn't act as a binder when baking. If I had started with a roux to hold it all together, I wouldn't have felt that I wasted an expensive pound of jumbo lump.

This is amazing. it's not exactly health food with all that mayo, but it is SO good and super easy if you buy the crab alredy picked. the phillips stuff from costco is really good and pretty affordable for lump crab meat.

My favorite part of this website are the wonderful reviews, so I will add mine also. I agreed with the previous posts - I added Old Bay, I substituted panko crumbs for the white bread and used them over a bit of shredded gruyere. A food processor was not necessary. FANTASTIC dish said three crab fanatics tonite.

I also used old bay and panko crumbs, and didn't use my food processor. Used half the ingrediants for two, and a wonderful half pound of fresh Dungeness crab from a local farmers' market. Baked in two ramekins, next time will use smaller ones (8 oz). Very satisfying with just a green salad and good bread.

I agree with several previous reviewers: add old bay and a food processor is not necessary to make this delicious dish.

This is better than crab imperial I've had at local restaurants--and I live in the city where all things crab rule. This will not disappoint!

Delicious and easy. I used Panko crumbs.

Good recipe, but where's the Old Bay? This seasoning is a staple on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and I added my usual 1-2 tsp of Old Bay to make it an authentic Maryland crab cake. Proportions give the "cake" a good moist consistency.

I can't wait to try this out! I've been working in a seafood department for a while and, well, when things go on sale... Someone has to buy them!

Excellent recipe. I especially like the fact that the recipe doesn't include a lot of spices to mask the crab flavor. It's very rich, so we managed to get 6 decently-sized portions out of it. Served with basmati rice and a simple mesclun salad. Next time I may use another reviewer's suggestion to use this as a filling for mushroom caps.

Yes, I would make it again with modifications. First - cook who suggested portabellos... big hit. I added diced onion, garlic and red pepper. then topped it with Parm. cheese. After tasting, if I were to do stuffed shrooms again, I would have just schlumped all the ingredients together and make a stuffing (skipping the tedious cuisinarting) stuffed the caps and then topped with cheese. My husband -the ultimate epicure - declares homemade bearnaise drizzled atop would have been a nice guilding of the lily. Gruyer on top and no sauce would be yummy too. Anyway, Portbellos - Yee Um.

I'd HIGHLY recommend this dish! As a seafood-lover from Maryland, I use this recipe by itself, or also as the topping to Chicken Chesapeake (grilled chicken breast, baked with a scoop of this recipe and topped after baking with Epicurious' Blender Hollandaise sauce). Any way you serve this Crab Imperial... it's a hit!

Sublime crab dish, easy, quick and wonderful. The key is fresh lump backfin crabmeat.

I used this delicious, easy to make, crab imperial as the basis for the stuffing of tilapia filets. Made the tilapia (buttered with seafood seasonings and cayenne) into canoe shapes. Filled it with the crab and topped it gently with gruyere cheese. Baked 15 minutes at 350 degrees. It was delicious.

I made this tonight as a "stuffing" for portobello mushrooms after reading the horrible reviews for crab stuffed mushrooms on this site. I actually caught and picked the crabs myself since I live on the bay and own a commercial crab trap. Not easy work, but this recipe made it all seem worth it. Had to use reg. bread crumbs as I never buy white bread, and also used Old Bay seasoning. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Did not need to use a food processor. This recipe is easy (if you buy the crabmeat ready to go), delicious, and definitely company worthy. You'll knock thier socks off. The salad suggested as a side adds a nice texture and flavor contrast to the creamy richness of the imperial. I'll make it again, but someone else is doing the crab pickin'!

I thought it was easy, quick, and impressive. When I can't afford crab meat the recipe also works with albocore tuna or imitation crab or lobster. Thanks. RandyS615

Rich. Decadent. Fabulous. My mom used to make crab imperial when I was little, and it was always a special treat. This recipe is excellent. I served this to six people as an entrée, along with rice and kale, and I found it to be just the right amount of mixture. It took longer than instructed to heat the mixture and to brown the top. I ended up turning the broiler on for a few seconds. Otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing!
