I thought this was very tasty and easy. I saw that some people thought that the sauce was greasy, so I used ground turkey instead of ground beef for the meatballs. It worked out great; no greasiness at all, and the turkey flavor went well with the lemon and capers.

Love lemon and capers. The sauce smelled great as it was simmering. However, I did not care for the texture of the meatballs after being cooked in the sauce. And despite using the leanest (less than 5% fat) sirloin I could find, I thought the resulting sauce was a bit greasy with animal fat. I may try this again, but will bake meatballs in oven and simmer sauce separately.

Very tasty and easy. I have another recipe of this dish, called 'Koenigsberger Klopse'(the actual German name) which suggests adding an egg yolk right before the end. Gives it a bit more body. Excellent!

Took me a lot longer than 45 minutes to prepare--isn't it always the way when you're in a hurry! The flavor is good--strong--but not compatible w/ everyone's palate.

This is a quick and delicious recipe. Although there was quite a bit of grease from the beef, I think I would use a leaner beef next time. I used 1 can of beef broth rather than what the recipe called for and it still turned out very nice. I served this over white rice, but next time I'll serve it over egg noodles.

Great recipe. One person posted that this should be made with veal, not beef. Veal is a young calf (I was raised on a beef-breeding farm). This is beef. However, if you'd like to spare that little calf his life (which I prefer doing), let him grow a little bigger - enjoy a little more life, then I suggest you use the beef as written. And if you leave out the beef, you can save calories; fat, and simply make up the CAPER SAUCE which is terrific, and put it over egg noodles (german type) OR over a nice rice..truly, this makes a great 'meat-less' dish and with salad and white wine (when there's no beef in it), it makes a wonderful meal. I'm German, so I can assure you any 'kraut like me', will enjoy it. YOUR WEB-SITE IS ALSO TREMENDOUS. I ADORE IT! Diane.

This seems to be a variation of the original German dish "Koenigsberger Klopse", which is supposed to be made of veal, not beef. You may want to file it under "German Meatballs". Plus I would never use cornstarch, but rather rely on cream to thicken the sauce. Otherwise, a good recipe.
