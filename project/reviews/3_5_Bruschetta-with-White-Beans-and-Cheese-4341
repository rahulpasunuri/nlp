I made this for Xmas to hold people over while I finished cooking the big show. Instead of putting the cheese mixed in, I grated it on parchment in little disks, melted it in the over, cooled till I could handel and formed it into cups over the bottom of shot glasses. Made tasty little bites that didn't add to the pile of dishes.

Much better than I expected. Really creamy with the broken beans and cheese. Added juice from 1/2 a lemon since it needed a bit of acid. Also cheated and used canned beans--went over fine, but did need to add a bit of water (wish I'd had stock). Only two complaints: it turns to a bit of a paste if you don't keep it warm, so it's hard to serve as an app from a bowl at a party if it will sit for awhile. Also not the prettiest thing pre-plated on the crostini. But it was tasty!!

very good. i wasn't expecting much, just wanted a simple white bean thing, but was surprisingly great. i also added a little olive oil and salt on top.

This was good, but not fantastic. I used canned beans to speed the process.

Put some out on tables in my resturant as a warm dip with bread. Most of it came back. Someone even called it too bland - and that's after I tried to doctor the orginal recipe a bit.

A lot of work for nothing. Everyone agreed at my brunch that the dip didn't have any flavor. I wouldn't recommend this at all.

I may be alone on this one, but I found this dish to be very uninteresting. I didn't particularly care for the blend of flavors nor did most of my guests. Followed the recipe so the problem is just a matter of taste I suppose.

People living at altitude BEWARE!!! I'm a canned bean person, but I thought I'd go the distance and use dried beans for this recipe. It smelled so good while it was cooking and I was so excited to serve it at my Tapas party. Living at altitude, I knew the beans would have to soak and cook longer, but I didn't realize HOW MUCH longer. After six hours of soaking and 5 hours of cooking, they were still not ready!!! DISASTER!! So, I will make this recipe again, but I will use canned beans or I will purchase a pressure cooker.

an excellent recipe! very easy, too, as long as you start early enough. it's extremely rich (so much cheese!). i doubled the proportion of beans and served it as a side dish with a garlicky roasted pork tenderloin and swiss chard. delicious!

Excellent recipe! Dinner guests have taken the recipe and served to their friends, who in turn have continued the new tradition! A must try; one to keep in your "favorites" file.

Delicious and much less time consuming if you use canned beans, as I did. I substituted a bit of low sodium chicken stock for the water to add depth of flavor. Also, I did not throw away the celery, onions and carrots, I chopped them finely and added them back to the beans. I think it's a shame to throw them away. Will make again.

Excellent on a cold winter day. A fresh, crusty, Italian bread is a must I used a fresh giabatta (sp?) from a local bakery and it was fantastic.

Thanks to all who added the tips for using canned beans. I used Progresso brand canellini beans, homemade stock and cooked the beans with the veggies a day ahead, letting them all sit in the fridge overnight for the flavors to blend. I served it on olive bread that I grilled then used the garlic to rub the olive oil into the bread. This recipe makes enough for 8 people if you are serving it as an appetizer for a hearty Italian meal. It is rich & delightful.

Complex, sophisticated, and delicious. Worth the steps it takes to get there.

The first time I made this recipe I found it very time consuming. I ended up not mashing the beans and just spooning them on to the bread. The house smelled incredible and they really tasted great. The second time I took a short cut and used canned beans and got to the bean mashing and they still tasted great and smelled great. However, they didn't look as appetising? Any suggestions?

Delicious! Very aromatic. Used two cans of beans instead of dry and boiled them with the seasonings for about 15 minutes. Do not skip this step! Cloves and Bay give it some depth. Although is is not a "quick" appetizer, it is worth the effort. I will make it again and again.

This recipe takes some work, but is worth the effort -- it's a source of constant comment, and the diners keep wandering back to the plate for more. Delicious!

I made this for a holiday party and everyone loved them! I used canned beans with vegetable stock which subtituted just fine. i also put a slice of prosciutto underneath each dollup of white bean mixture and it was delicious. the only flaw was that they were a bit too salty for some because of the salty cheese AND ham, but they all were eaten! i will make this one again definately!

Every time I make this I cant stop eating them! I love this!

I have made this several times, both with dried and canned beans. For canned beans, I use my own chicken stock instead of water and simmer the beans with the vegetables 10-15 minutes for flavor. I get rave reviews regardless of canned or dried beans. Goes well with a champagne or sparkling wine for a festive appetizer.

OH! I LOVE this dish! I have served it twice, now, and would make it every week if I thought my waistline could take it. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly - a little time-consuming and fussy, but WONDERFUL. The second time, I was cooking for a party, and cut a corner by using really good organic vegetable Broth (Imagine brand), and the change was not only undetecatble, but cut a huge amount of prep time. I suggest this recipe to everyone I know.

Absolutely delicious! I served these as part of an asst. bruschetta platter - nice contrast with other garlic/basil and vinegar based flavors. So rich and flavorful - also very easy. I used canned cannelini beans and simmered them in an organic "No-chicken" broth w/ bay leaves and fresh black pepper - plenty of flavor and much quicker.

I really love this recipe... I of course used the canned beans and as a variation added some wafer thin sliced extra lean capacolla(spicy italian ham). Add the ham to the toasted bread before topping it with the beans; it adds just a hint of spiciness to an already great dish.

Absolutely stupendous. What a simply wonderful appetizer. Easy to get ingredients and tremendous flavor. will make many times to come.

My husband requests this at least once a month and dinner guests eat so much they spoil their meal! I simplify the recipe by using canned beans and a quality chicken stock and it tastes exactly the same.

I would say the extra beans are saved for another use, like white beans with garlicky tomato sauce over couscous, though i might try adding them back in to the mashed beans to enhance the texture.

I've made this three times and always get raves. I use canned white kidney beans instead of dried for easiness and boil them with the vegetables and spices for 10 minutes to get the flavour.

Recipe directions are confusing. It says:(reserve the remaining beans for another use); but it does not say to add it back in the sauce. I presume this is what you do with the remaining beans? Please advise me. Thankyou
