We added banana and nuts to ours, they came out very nice and moist. Delicious.

Very quick to make, even with the chocolate chopping. And even though it does walk that line between dessert and muffin, its lightness and the ease of mixing puts it in the realm of muffin. I especially liked the fact that it was not too sweet, but of course, one of my kids wanted just a few more chocolate chunks. Made 16 muffins that rose well.

Yum! Would have tasted better with a glaze since they were a little dry in the center. Added sprinkles to the recipe for a little color and they were delicious. Great with a glass of milk!

Really, really good but let's face it this is basically chocolate cake disguised in muffin form! I noted that some reviewers commented their muffins turned out dry, so I added a splash extra buttermilk and a large chopped pear. I loved the choc-pear combo and the fruit made for a moist muffin. I'd also add dried cherries and almond slivers for another variation.

Very good muffins. They rose beautifully. They are a touch dry so best eaten immediately or the same day. Next time I may increase the moisture content. I dropped some chocolate chips on top so my little ones would happily eat them. They devoured them for lunch.

Gross. I made the recipe exactly as specified. They came out of the oven smelling strangely like yeast, they tasted like nothing, and have an unpleasant moist texture. I've made these twice because the first time they were bad and I was sure that I made a mistake, but no, I think it's got to be the recipe...

Very good! I halved the sugar and it was still good, perfect to eat in the morning... I think next time I'll use 5 oz chocolate though!

Made this a little healthier by substituting a banana for the butter (melted the chocolate by itself) and 1 1/2 cups whole wheat flour + 1/2 cup white flour. I also reduced the sugar to about 1/2 cup. I had to mix the batter a while to incorporate the flour but the finished product turned out well. A great chocolate treat that's not a guilty pleasure.

recipe, as is, is perfect. This is the one that made it into the personal recipe box on my shelf! If you want something sweet and sugary, you should just get a box mix. If you want the gourmet, robust flavor of real chocolate in muffin form, this is it! Enjoy!

I was surprised how good these muffins were. I didn't have unsalted butter and regular worked just fine without me changing the amount of pure salt. They dried out a little quicker than most, but it was a wonderful breakfast for me. I would make these muffins again. :- )

This is one of my favorite muffin recipe, it had the perfect soft consistency, and really tasted like chocolate!

Excellent for afternoon chocolate treat. I changed the recipe a bit to achieve an even darker, more chocolate-y experience. Used Scharffenberger unsweetened chocolate and melted it into the recipe. Added 1 cup Ghiradelli 60% cacao chips, and used only 1/4 cup butter, plus 1/3 cup canola oil. Didn't have buttermilk, so followed online instructions of using 1 cup milk + 1 tbsp white vinegar and letting sit 5 minutes before using. To add some texture, I substituted 1/2 cup flour for almond flour. For those loco for chocolate, this was the bomb! I'm definitely making this again.

These are SO greatly moist! Yummi² !³ It was second recipe I tried for chocolate muffins; the first one was from a very famous german TV-Cook and included instant chocolate pudding powder and low-fat milk...they were not horrable but they weren't any good or worth the time either. But THESE "Chocolate-Chocolate Chunk Muffins" with unsweetened cocoa-powder, a big Tbsp. baking powder and BUTTER-milk to add the extra-protein made them totally fluffy. Also I can confirm what the other reviewers said, they're not very sweet...but I used good Lindt 70% chocolate and made it 5 ounces, which gave them the intense chocolate flavor I was aiming at more than the normally sweet kid-friendly milk-chocolate one. I will keep this recipe my whole life, even if it's just for the idea of using extra-baking-powder and buttermilk to get fluffy and moist dough. PS: Be careful with the baking time...they get crunchy on the outside fast, without looking like it.

I have made these twice so far and both times they have comes out great. I used Low-Fat Vanilla Soy milk in replace of the buttermilk. I also use the Special Dark Chocolate chips from Hershey. I just melt some chips and the rest I toss into the batter. As I prefer dark chcolate and I am not big things I eat being too overly sweetened (it drowns out the taste!)I put in less surgar then it called for. It came out just fine.

The previous reviewers were right...not that sweet, but perfect for me. I used whole wheat pastry flour, Valhrona cocoa, and yogurt instead of buttermilk. They came out fluffy and light, just a bit sweet and quite chocolatey. And very fast and easy with minimal dishes to wash, always a plus.

I loved these muffins. They were moist, chocolatey and delicious.

reading the previous review, it makes me wonder why people can't follow the recipe?!!! and then have the nerve to rate their mistake as if it was the original recipe. anyway, these muffins were great! the tempting smell of chocolate made them go quickly and the feedback was terrific. i will definitely make these again.

I used plain low fat yogurt instead of buttermilk, and I don't know if that was what messed it up, or perhaps it just was the recipe? It was not sweet enough, and I even added extra sugar. I ate one and threw them away. Terribly disappointing, and they definitely don't live up to their name!

I didn't have the bittersweet chocolate on hand or the buttermilk, but they came out great! I wanted a smaller batch, so I also cut the recipe in half, except for the 3/4 stick of butter, which I used in its entirety. Then I substituted a half cup cocoa and 2 tablespoons butter for the bittersweet chocolate. Instead of buttermilk, I used sour cream. But of course everything was too dry so I add some milk until it looked like muffin batter (about a third a cup or more). To top it all off, I put in 12 ounces of chopped walnuts. Then it needed sweetening so I added about half a cup of sugar and half a cup of honey. My husband was delighted with the results and so was I.

Tasty, tender and not-too-sweet muffin-cakes, as promised. This recipe made 18 regular sized ones. We like 'em.

Out of the oven these muffins looked very good. So I was disappointed when I tried them, especially after such good reviews. I think I would have liked more a cakey muffin, I really felt it clings to you palate and you need a tea or a coffee to swallow it. I don't like very sweet stuff but maybe due the quality of the chocolate or the cocoa I used I should have increase the amout of sugar of at least 40 grams. I don't think I will repeat these, since I have other recipe of the sort that I enjoy more.

One word for these...Yummy! No too sweet; Great for any time of the day.

Made these this morning, perfect for breakfast because not too sweet. I added 1 teaspoon of espresso powder, I think it enhances the chocolate flavor. Very moist, super easy to put together. Would definitely make again.

This must be the ultimate chocolate muffin. Moist and chocolatey. Wonderful warm from the oven. Delicious cold. I successfully froze leftover muffins to microwave for breakfasts and lunches the following week. Will definitely make these again. Followed the instructions exactly except for using mini chocolate chips.
