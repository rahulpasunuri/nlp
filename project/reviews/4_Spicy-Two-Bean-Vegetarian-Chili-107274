I have been making this for the last several years and it has become my "go to" vegetarian chili recipe. The hot chili powder from The Spice House in Chicago makes this quite spicy and a dollop of Greek yogurt on the top cools it down to just the right level of heat.

I gave this 4 forks even though I did make several adjustments but I feel that it really is a good base for veg chile. It was a dreary day when I decided to make this and I did not have the exact ingredients but did not feel like going to the store so went with what I had on hand. The only real changes were the type of beans that I used. I had chickpeas, white kidney and a can of mixed beans and it worked out great. I think that with this type of recipe you always have to adjust the seasoning to your taste and this was not different. I agree with those that said to add salt and I had to bump up all of the other spices to give it a really rich flavour. The consistency was great with only 2 cups of broth rather than water. You can always add more after if you find it too thick. The end product was delicious.

I've made this chili at least 3 times in the last couple of months and every time it is DELICIOUS and perfect. I put it all together--from entering my kitchen to turning off the stove--in 50 minutes today. I usually get 6-8 hearty servings. With this many servings, it is also really WeightWatchers friendly (5-6 points+ per serving).

Really good. I would blend it slightly to make it a better consistency THEN add a wee bit of ground turkey if you're not a vege. The cinnamon is what makes this dish so warm and wonderful.

Rating: 4
I subbed serrano chiles with seeds for the jalapenos, veggie broth for the water and doubled the spices. With those modifications, the chili turned out spiced enough for my tastes and went perfectly with the somewhat bland cornbread I baked earlier. Will definitely make again.

Great weekday standby. I substitute barley for bulgur and always add a dried chipotle pepper for smoky dimension. Have made this several times and usually last several lunches beyond dinner.

Rating: 4
This was a really nice chili. As other reviewers mentioned, it needed a little something at the end - so I added some salt and a little ground chipotle powder, and that was perfect. I also used vegetarian "ground beef" instead of bulghur since I had it on hand, but that was probably inconsequential. Excellent! I'll be making this again...

Delicious! Made this for four and it was basically gone! I did add a teaspoon of salt and only 1.5 cups of water. I want to make this with ground beef. Has anyone done that? I'm thinking that because with the called for 3 cups of water its soupy,if I use that amount plus meat it will still have a chili consistency...Thoughts?

Rating: 0
Great flavor. Using 3 cups of water, however, makes it very thin and soup-like. I used 1 cup and the consistency was thicker and more like chili.

Like this a lot. Substituted Serrano peppers for the jalepeno and vegetarian ground round for the bulgur. Very spicy indeed, found the napkins more useful for wiping my brow. The quantity of beans was reduced by a quarter and still seemed plenty.

Nice flavors -- but the people who said it needed salt were exactly right. I'm surprised there is none in the recipe.

Tasty! Nice balance of flavors. Next time may try different chiles (serrano, maybe dried chile de arbol?), but really nice base recipe. I did have to add about a teaspoon of salt and some pepper not called for in the recipe--I used no salt canned beans, so it tasted a little bland right off the stove, but the salt/pepper brought out all the flavors.

Really tasty and great consistency. I cut back a little on the jalapeno and my cans of beans were 19 ounces instead of 15. Otherwise, made it exactly as written. Even allowing that I added more beans, it's a large batch. It served 8 with lots of leftovers (and tasted even better the next day)

This is fantastic chili. I've made it many times, and it always gets rave reviews. It also freezes really well. I make a few adjustments, including using dried beans cooked in a mirepoix (then I just use 3 C of bean broth instead of water) and I omit the cinnamon and coriander.

As the last reviewer wrote, I saw so many positive reviews of this recipe that I had to try it. It was truly awful. I'm perplexed as to how this turned out well for anyone. It was so acidic we could barely eat it. And other than the acidity, quite flavorless. I wonder if vegetable broth as a substitution for the water would have helped. I don't recommend this one at all.

I thought I made a mistake with this recipe, because so many reviewers said this was really flavorful and I found it pretty bland. I did a lot of adjusting at the end, adding salt, black and white pepper, cayenne, garlic powder, and hot sauce. Served it with raw chopped onion and cheddar cheese.

This is a perfect recipe for winter. I was a little worried about the bulgur as I had never tried it before, but it blended nicely with the dish. I used medium hot green chiles (not jalapeños), and 2 cups of water (not 3 1/2). Served with spicy pork and tomato sausages, and a dollop of sour cream. I will make this dish AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN.

WOW, what a flavor explosion!! It was like a good Dixieland band hitting all the right notes in my mouth.

I highly recommend this recipe.

This is a delicious chili and was really simple to make. The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of water otherwise I followed the recipe as written and it came out fantastic.

This is a great veggie chili recipe and we will definitely be eating it again. I didn't have any bulgur on hand, so I used quinoa as suggested by a previous reviewer. It was delicious! Also, don't skip the cinnamon.

Rating: 3
Agree with others that the bulgur is a neat trick to give substance to this vegetarian chili and make it more meatlike. Also agree that it needs some spicing up - added a dry red chili and an extra jalapeno, and more chili powder and cumin. However, it is very adaptable to spicing to your taste. Also decided to delete carrots and cinnamon. My family, including some vegetarians, are getting it next week. A keeper...

This is a great recipe that I have made twice now when I have vegitarian friends over for dinner. Both times, I did minor modifications, but the basic recipe is still the same. I added twice as much Bulgar as the recipe calls for, and one additional can of tomato puree for more flavor, and used veggie stock instead of water. I also rehydrated and cooked a dry mix of Pinto, great northern, black, and chick peas which gave more diverse beany flavors which i like better. I also used more beans than this recipe asks for. Also added a pinch of salt and some pepper for flavor. I had to cook this down for quite a while longer - at least an hour - to get a thick chili texture instead of soup, but the longer it cooks, the better the flavors blend and thicken. Nice recipe and certainly a keeper. It always dissapears for veggies and meat eaters alike.

Rating: 2
After all the rave reviews, my expectations must have been too high because I thought this was just OK - I didn't see the "wow" factor that others did. I really liked the bulgur wheat trick for texture, though, and will definitely repeat it in other veggie chili recipes. As for doubling the spices, I'd recommend starting with the prescribed amounts and then gradually increasing to your own taste. (This may be obvious, but I went straight to the doubling and then wished I'd done it more slowly.) Finally, even if you think you are high-heat tolerant, be wary of those jalapeno seeds! I added in just a little and it was quickly too much. I should have known better!

Rating: 4
Made this for a crowd using black beans, navy beans and adzuki beans from the farmer's market that I had previously cooked. Only had one fresh jalapeno, so added one that I had pickled, plus some chipotles and homemade salsa that was taking up room in the fridge. Also added a bag of frozen corn. All in all, it was great -- got raves and no one missed the meat. Will definitely do this regularly.

Rating: 3
This was very good, healthy & quick! I made a few changes based on what I had in the house - canned plum tomatoes (chopped them), 2 cans black beans, 1 can pinto, halved the cinnamon, used broth in place of water & added some chipotle. Next time I would do everything the same except maybe try fire roasted or crushed tomatoes & try for a little smokier flavor. This was not hot at all, even with the extra chipotle. I did have to add extra water & cook for over 30 min to finish the bulgur. Topped with cheese or yogurt or cilantro & green onions... or any combo.

Rating: 0
This recipe is a keeper! I cut back the beans to 3 x 15 ounce cans and increased the bulghur to 3/4 cup. My husband did not even notice there was no meat. I served it with a topping of fresh cilantro, grated cheddar and green onions. Will make this again.

Yummy. Make this.

I wanted to use up some cupboard ingredients, and this recipe fit the bill. I was pleasantly surprised with the result. I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes instead of plain, as well as a can of roasted green chiles. I used dried adzuki beans (I cooked them separately) instead of canned beans and they were very good. The vinegar and spices were a nice counterpoint to the smoky tomatoes, and the bulgur gives the dish a meaty and satisfying body. I served it with a sweet cornbread and didn't miss the meat at all. Will likely make this again.

Rating: 3
A good bet, I might use stewed toms in place of crushed (and add only 1 cup water or so) for a less sweet flavour, but otherwise the balance is great. I used about 40 ounces beans (2 19-ounce cans) and otherwise followed this exactly. Bulgur is great, DON'T add more, 1/2 dry is enough.

Great. Use 1 cup water. Could add extra veg as mentioned below. Spice combo is key. Heat is moderately high. Could double the bulgur.

I'm not a fan of bell pepper or kidney beans, so I generally sub poblano and pintos, respectively. Turns out wonderful every time! I frequently go back to this recipe, especially when I need to feed a partially vegetarian crowd!

Both vegetarians and non-v really enjoyed it, and it's quite satisfying: tastes just like the usual (albeit no meat flavor), but hearty and filling. I followed someone's recommendation to add a third bean type - pinto - which gave a nice color contrast and added flavor. I also added a green pepper as well - there's really no overkill in adding more vegetable.

Rating: 4
Cooked this for a chili contest and it did okay (was the only non-meat entry). It is not spicy enough as is, so I added some green chili powder and cayenne (also left the seeds in from one jalapeno for an extra kick). I also added corn and sauteed the garlic with the other veggies instead of adding it later. I think the carrots overpower the taste of the dish, so I'll leave them out next time.

Great, great chili! I skipped the chilies because my son doesn't like it spicy. We added a can of corn and I substituted TVP (textured vegetable protein) for bulgur and it was delicious and had that meaty texture. The spices totally make it--love the cinnamon. Will make this again and again. My son ate two bowls of it. Goes great with cornbread and honey butter.

This is a darn good recipe. I must admit, I didn't get the call for bulgur- but it does indeed give it body... much like the meat does in a "con carne" chili. I'll make it again.

Delicious!! my only changes -- heated some cumin seeds in the oil in the beginning. didn't have any vinegar so left it out. Only used 1/2 the chili powder and it was plenty spicy (guess it depends on how spicy the chili powder is). served the chili on spaghetti (ala Skyline Chili in Cincinnati) with shredded chedder/mixed cheese on top. The whole family (including the carnivores) loved it and the leftovers taste even better the next day.

This recipe was amazing. I am a full fledged carnivore, and love meat. I can say that not only did I not miss it, I will likely never make chili with meat again. The bulgur is essential! I added 1 cup of frozen shoe peg corn, and mixed it up with 3 types of smaller beans. Don't forget the cinnamon, I always add sugar to my chili, and did not this time. I am convinced the cinnamon made the difference.

This chili recipe was fantastic. My husband, who is a meat eater, loved this chili, and he is picky about his chili! I omitted the carrots and bulgur, added green bell pepper, tabasco sauce, one can of fire-roasted tomatoes, and soy burger crumbles, and doubled the amount of spices. This made it super spicy and super delicious.

fantastic! have made this twice now, first time for a big group of friends and again last night just for me and my boyfriend. the leftovers are even better and i plan to always make extras in the future. made a few substitutions: -only used one cup of water and added part of a veggie bullion cube --added a bottle of beer, a habanero in the beginning, an extra 28 oz can of tomatoes (essential to keep all the extra spice down a little), frozen corn, some pureed chipotles in adobo, a tomatillo, a zucchini and forgot the carrots. this is the best chili i have ever made and will definitely be making again, especially while it's still cold.

I just made this for a super bowl party and secretly want to save it all for myself now. I used one and a half jalepenos and the suggested amount of spice, minus the cinnamon and it turned out pretty mild. Also used a vegetarian meat substitute from the refrigerated vegetarian section of the market instead of the bulgar and it seemed to work out fine. Finally I did add the three cups of water but used some vegetarian bullion for added flavor. A very successful recipe and I'm eager to see how the meat-eaters like it.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and so used 4 different types of beans plus subbed a can of hominy for one of the types of beans. I also used canned whole peeled tomatoes that I cut before adding. I traded chopped veggie burgers for the bulgur and added a can of corn, some hot sauce, and some cayenne. A great base recipe but fun to add more to it.

I added spices and garlic to the sauted veggies and cooked another 2 minutes before adding liquids, etc. Omitted cinnamon. Delicious...definitely a crowd pleaser.

Outstanding! It even made my roommate who hates beans ask me for the recipe! I used what I had available, so I subbed in 4 green chiles for the jalapenos, and 3/4 cup of finely diced red potatoes instead of bulgur (I cut them to 1/4 inch sq and they still stayed together). I also prefer whole plum tomatoes from a can instead of crushed. Just toss them in, and chop them in half with a spoon. They release enough juice for the sauce and are a great treat in the finished chili!

This is some of the best chili I've ever had. The bulgur and chopped veggies makes it seem like it's got meat in it. We make two slight changes when we make it.

I made a few changes as others suggested - used corn instead of carrots, doubled the bulgur, and used one each of red, yellow, and green bell peppers. Since my husband and I both like a lot of spice, I used 4 BIG jalapenos and 4 heaping Tbsps of chili powder. Surprisingly, it turned out barely spicy! Maybe it's because the recipe makes SO much. But the flavors are delicious and the texture is wonderful. Next time I'll just add even more spice.

I am always looking for a good veggie chili recipe and this was delicious! I used one can each of black, kidney and pinto beans and added a diced zucchini (because you can never have too many vegetables!) I was very intrigued by the combination of spices in this dish... I did use cinnamon as well as whole cumin and actually added a bit of turmeric to complement the Indian spices. (Not to mention the health benefits of this versatile spice.) Fresh cilantro at the end freshened the southwest flavors as well. Word to the wise: ALWAYS taste your jalapeños before adding them to a dish. I bought some that were so hot they would have overwhelmed the whole pot, so only ended up adding half of what was called for. This made closer to 10-12 servings than six, so I'm glad I like it since I'll be eating it all week ;)

Great recipe, have been making for several years now. Four forks as is, but wanted to pass on some suggestions that improve it for us: (1) double the bulgur -- adds more meatiness; (2) use diced, not crushed tomatoes -- gives more tomato flavor; (3) double the cumin; (4) increase the chili powder and use different types (e.g., ancho and New Mexico); (5) don't drain the black beans (helps thicken and add flavor -- but DO drain and rinse the kidney beans, which often have added sugar). Thanks to the Averills for sharing!

This chili turned out really well. It ended up being pretty thick but that could have been because I let it simmer too long. The bulgur was a great addition.

I made this almost as written. I used 3/4 c. quinoa instead of bulgur (to make it gluten free), added a medium sized zucchini and a 10 oz box of frozen kernel corn, omitted the chili powder (I didn't have any, and it would have been too hot, anyway, with the jalapenos, too), added 1.5 tsp of salt, and maybe 1/2 tsp. paprika. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, as that's what I had. It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again. I served it with gluten free cornbread (from Carol Fenster's "Wheat-Free Recipes & Menus") and it was a great, fast meal.

I'll start by saying I halved this recipe; unless you're cooking for a crowd or like to freeze your food, this was too many servings for the three people I was making dinner. I also agree with the other reviewers that this recipe needed a little something extra. I added the spices to the cooking vegetables and added celery seed seasoning that was not called for--I also omitted the pepper since I realized last minute I didn't have any on hand. On top of the vegetables and spices, I cooked the garlic for a minute or so. After that, I then added in the liquid ingredients. I also omitted the cinnamon and opted for adding about a teaspoon and a half of sugar. I don't like cinnamon in chili, but the sugar rounds out the flavor beautifully--it doesn't actually add sweetness but instead makes the flavor fuller. Just add it toward the end of your cooking so you can adjust the flavor properly. With these modifications, I would make this recipe again.

Rating: 3
I made this and was thrilled with the taste. I only had 1 can of kidney beans and 1 can of black beans. So I cooked up a cup of navy beans and added them. I omitted the cinnamon, added one rib of chopped celery and about 1 tablespoon of maple syrup as it tasted a bit too acidic from the canned tomatoes. Next time I will use 2 jalapeno's instead of 3.

This is huge- unlless you are cooking for a crowd, halve the amount of beans (I used 1 cup dried, soaked and cooked black turtle beans instead of the tinned ones which aren't available in Australia). Leave the carrots out, substitute corn niblets- fresh or frozen and up the amounts of cumin and coriander. Remember that it is Mexican chilli powder. Serve as a taco filling with all the trimmings. Very yummy. You'll still have enough to freeze!

A great recipe for a comfort dish. I thought it needed a few improvements though. Added one stick of celery in with the carrot and onion. After having softened the vegetables, added the garlic and the ground spices and stir fried for another 2-3 minutes to release flavors. Then added the liquids. Like the previous reviewer I omitted the cinnamon as I did not want sweetnes in the dish and added more spices than indicated. Last but not least I added barley instead of bulgur. Excellent and good for a few days, or good for freeezing if you have made a big batch (recommended).

I liked it, I didn't love it. Next time I'd add a bit more stock to thin it out a little and a chipotle chili and adobo instead of the fresh chiles to liven it up. Very warm and filling for being so lo-cal. It's a great alternative to beef chili and the bulgur is quite hearty, but it's not exactly the same.

Yummy & easy, but is better with some of the modifications suggested by the other reviewers. It is NOT spicy as is. I added a habanero pepper and cayenne to spice it up. I also added zest from 1 lime & 2 tsp. worcestershire, plus oregano, thyme, & cocoa powder; it definitely needed extra chili powder & cumin, at least 1 more tbsp. each. I cut back on the cinnamon as recommended - you could probably do without it. I also omitted the carrots and added frozen corn in with the beans. Instead of water, I used low-sodium vegetable boullion dissolved in hot water for added flavor - I'll bet some beer would work great, too. I added one can of chick peas in lieu of one of the cans of black beans, for added color & texture. Definitely do not omit the bulgur, it's great and eliminates the need for rice.

As previous reviewers stated, the highlight of this dish is the addition of bulgar. It gives the chili a thick, meaty texture and boosts it's nutritional value. Per reviews, I added frozen corn and substituted dark lager for some of the water -- both great additions I'd make again in the future. What I'd change, however, are the spices. Even with 4 jalapenos and extra cumin and chili powder, I found the flavor weak and overpowered by cinnamon. In the future, I'd add way more cumin and chili powder and balance the cinnamon and a 1/4-1/2 a tsp cayenne to kick it up.

My family really enjoyed this recipe! Even my father, who is a very picky eater and prefers red meat over anything else, loved it! I decided to add an additonal 1/2 cup of bulger to give it a meatier texture. It worked just fine and required no extra water. The only other thing I will do differently next time is to add a small can of corn instead of carrots. I don't think carrots belong in chili.

I was trying to satisfy a pregnant vegetarian and a meat lover (me). I generally followed the recipe kind of. I subbed two poblanos for the jalopenos to accommodate an unborn tummy. Three cans of diced tomatoes garlic and onion flavor. Used a yellow and red pepper for color. I subbed a big can of hominy for the beans, it is a Mexican dish after all. I bought two big chicken/apple sausages at the local sausage meister, par boiled them, sliced thin, and in they went. Finally, I thickened it with masa flour for the same reason I used hominy. Truth, chili should be really spicy and pork/beef greasy, but this was a big hit and I"ll enjoy the leftovers for sure.

This is a fantastic recipe. I add celery to give it some green and top it off with grated cheddar. Spice lovers should add an additional tablespoon of chili powder.

I have been making this since it appeared in 2002. Without fail, everyone raves about this chili and asks for the recipe. It is heary enough for meat lovers and freezes beautifully. I sometimes add chopped, smoked mushrooms for a greater depth of flavor. This has become a signature dish at our house!

I was so surprised by this recipe! I'm not a huge chili fan, but I gave it a try last night and it was great! It's easy to make, and easy to tailor to your personal likes and dislikes. I agree that the cracked wheat is an important part of the dish....I used beef broth instead of the water, added corn, threw some cheese on top - it was really good!

I love this recipe. I left out the bulgar as I didn't have any and used kidney beans and a can of mixed beans (pinto, great northern, black-eye, canellini etc.) Also threw in a can of sweetcorn. Will serve it tonight over brown rice with crusty bread on the side! Delicious!

Rating: 3
3+1/2 forks. Delicious! Even my husband didn't miss the meat, and I was delighted to find it much tastier even than expected. I added 1/2 a diced squash, and used garbanzo beans in place of the kidney beans, used only 1 (large) jalapeno and threw in a few dried (Indian) chili peppers to infuse their flavours as it cooked. We topped with chopped fresh cilantro - a MUST - and some greek-style yoghurt (like sour cream but lighter tasting). I am thrilled to have leftovers to bring to work this week.

The texture and consistency of this chili was quite nice, but I thought it needed more depth of flavor. It tasted too heavily of tomato and chili powder. I adjusted the spices somewhat after tasting the chili (to attempt to get some more flavor "layers") but still couldn't get it quite right.

Outstanding. I used black beans and white kidney beans -- and I also added corn. This made a pretty chunky chili, but that's how I like it. I also added a little bittersweet chocolate to the concoction. Absoultely amazing!

Fantastic version of chili and nice change to using beef. Had to make a few alterations: forgot I didn't have bulgur wheat in so had to omit it - there was consequently a bit too much liquid so will use it next time; used fresh coriander instead of dried and substituted ground cinnamon for half a stick cinnamon which i removed before serving. Also added the remains of a tin of sweetcorn which i used the rest in a salsa and served both with white rice. Went down very very well even a "strict carnivore" went back for seconds! Definitely will make again.

This was a welcome change from the usual chilis that make it to my table. I really loved the addition of bulgur for its texture and liquid-sopping effect. I used Muir Glen fire roasted tomatoes with medium green chilies and omitted the jalepeno, added frozen corn, and used jarred roasted red peppers because that was all I had. Stirred in a few good shakes of tabasco, which gave it a little more heat. I also used half the amount of cinnamon because I have saigon and I'm terrified of being stuck with cinnamony vegetable slop. This was far from slop, and I will be making it again! (but not until I make the pinto bean sweet potato chili from this site again).

I loved this chili, though made some usual adjustements based on what I had on hand - replaced bulgur with buckwheat since I'm not a big wheat-eater, added 1/2 can of corn (leftover from cornmeal muffins baking in the oven), threw in about a cup of leftover rice, added salt, and just sprinkled cinnamon to what looked like a good amount. Also, I agree with others, this isn't very spicy at all. Still super good though! And great with sour cream on top.

I liked the texture and weight. The canned tomatoes really overwhelmed the dish - all we could taste was tomatoes. We tried to neutralize by adding roasted walnuts. Next time I will use fresh tomatoes or less of the canned tomatoes. I also added chopped celery and fresh coriander.

Very easy and so good. Not too hot, good spice combination. I used no salt added beans and tomato cans though, so I had to add some salt. A keeper

I just had to make another comment, I had leftovers today...and it was even better than it was the first time around! There is a hint of sweetness to the tomato sauce which to me is just so delicious and satisfying. THIS will be my go to vegetarian chili recipe (p.s. Firgot to mention in previous review that I carmelized the onions/garlic/peppers with a little splenda. Also, the bf needs/likes meat, so I cooked up ground beef with some tomato sauce and chili powder so that he could add to his chili, he liked it alot.)

I've tried multiple vegetarian chili recipes, and always do a combination. I did alter this recipe, but the flavor (the seasonings, the white wine vinegar, etc.) made this quite tasty and satisfying even without the bulger. My changes: roasted butternut squash, and corn (2 ears) and added that to the recipe, being that I was adding the sqaush and corn, I only used 1 can each of the beans. Also, instead of water, I used beef broth (to add flavor of meat, without the meat). And also used a tablespoon of sundried tomato paste to thicken it up a bit. As well as adding about a tablespoon or so of cornmeal to thicken (as seen in another recipe). I thought this was delicious and will definitely make again.

Great recipe! I used broth in place of the water, increased the bulgar to 1 cup and added corn in place of one can of kidney beans. The spice combination is perfect and it cooks down nicely.

This was great! I made 4x the amount for a big party and it was well received. I modified it by leaving out the extra water and bulger but adding canned golden hominy instead. Nice to have a great chili that all-comers can enjoy.

Trying to stay true to the fork system, I think this rates between a 2 and a 3. It's a good recipe as is, and easy to make--and pretty, too. The spices are an interesting and tasty combination...but it seemed to be missing a little something. And since I'm not a super-experienced cook, I'm not sure how to remedy it. That said, I'll definitely make this again, with a little less cinnamon, a little more fire, and a little more...salt? Cumin?

Wonderful but only used one chili so it was not as spicy - everyone loved it

This is a fabulous, easy chili. I made it yesterday for an informal Christmas party. It got raves from everyone in attendance (all carnivores, I might add). My only changes were to use chicken broth in place of the water, leave out the cinnamon (I realized at the last minute that I didn't have any), and leave out the jalapenos (to satisfy non-spice tolerant guests). Everyone had seconds, and my husband and I ate it again this morning, heated up in a skillet with some poached eggs. I used the Sweet Potato Cornbread recipe from this site as an accompaniment. I will definitely make both recipes again. Delish!

Very tasty chili, the flavors are both rich and fresh. I added white corn and used garbanzo beans instead of black beans which made the dish a beautiful mix of colors. This recipie is actually very mild, so I spiced it up with extra chipotle. YUM! Good to make ahead of time for quick and hearty meals.

Excellent. I was skeptical about the bulgur, but I was pleasantly surprised: it adds a nice texture, like couscous. My only quibble is that this chili is a bit sweet, requiring a good amount of salt for balance. Also, I just reheated the leftovers for me, a non-vegetarian, and added a bit of beef buillion powder ... very satisfying.

I was bone tired one day and came upon this recipe. I keep a well-stocked pantry so I had everything that I needed (with the exception of bulgar). Chop some veggies, dump some canned beans in a pot and simmer. Great vegetarian chili. Since I live alone I made a 1/2 recipe and would put in a tad less cinnamon next time. Otherwise it's fantastic with some day-old cornbread! Definitely a keeper.

Wonderful, easy-to-prepare chili. Even my 18-month-old son likes it. My one "beef" with this recipe is that my batch came out on the sour side (I think that 2T vinegar is too much) and I needed to use sugar to balance the flavor. I also added a dash of cocoa powder.

This was great! I took the LA cook's advice and started with one jalapeño, but it wasn't spicy enough for me so I added a whole heaping bunch of chili powder, tasting it as I went. I used low-sodium canned beans and was obliged to add some salt to the chili. Also added extra cumin because I thought it needed it. The veggies were perfect in this chili, and I really liked the consistency that the bulgur gave to the mixture: I normally eat chili with rice but it did not need it. Was also easy and, despite my reservations about only cooking the total 20 minutes(I cooked it 25), it did not need that long. I live with 2 non-meat eaters so we will make this lots in the future!

This was delicious! My only change would be to watch out for the jalapenos. I love spicy food but with three good sized jalapenos this was nearly to firey to eat. In the future I will start with one jalapeno and go up from there. Also, I loved the addition of the bulgur. Yum.

I needed a quick recipe to bring a dish for a Mexican-theme gathering and happened to have all the ingredients for this one in my pantry. I fixed this chili this morning in under 15 minutes and threw it in the crockpot to simmer all day. I added marjoram and thyme instead of the oregano that I don't like, and 2 Tbsp. cocoa powder to deepen the color. I added two ribs chopped celery and about 1-1/2 cups corn because I didn't have the bulgur, and it tasted wonderful right after being mixed! I bet it will be divine tonight. This recipe makes a lot more servings than indicated.

This was a great recipe for our visiting vegetarian friends! I happened to have an extra spicy pepper, so our kids didn't have any, but all the grown-ups enjoyed! Definately add the bulgur.

This was really delicious. The bulgur really adds a nice texture. Like some other reviewers, I added part of a bag of frozen corn and skipped the cinnamon. The jalapenos sure seemed hot when I was chopping and seeding them (watch your eyes!) but they mellowed out during cooking. (I let the chili simmer for a good 40 minutes.) If you want heat, add more peppers or some cayenne or hot sauce. I have enough for 4 more meals, I'll be eating on this all week. Yum!

This chili is great! I used 1/4 t. cinnamon (not a fan), and increased heat w/ cayenne pepper to taste plus some little Tabasco (I like it hot). People raved. Although not a vegetarian, I preferred this to a meat chili we had the same night. I'll definitely make this again.

Great Super Bowl night recipe for vegetarian husband. I used 2 jalapenos, but didn't seed one and really wasn't very hot. I also pureed a portion to make the chili nice and thick.

I ran out of cumin so I substituted a chipotle pepper and some of the adobo sauce it was canned in. I also skipped the bulgur - out of it - and used a little bit of frozen corn as I like corn in veg chili. I enjoyed the flavor very much. I also took about 1.5 cups full and pureed it and then added it back into the recipe. It gives the chili some body and is a method I have used in another chili recipe. I like this rather than a loose and chunky chili.

This recipe's contribution is the use of bulgur, which gives the chili an excellent texture and bulk, and the good results for very little effort. There are more fabulous, but more complicated, recipes out there. This is not too spicy as written--add more chilies for heat. I also added more cumin, some bitter chocolate shavings for depth, and used only 3 cans of beans. Also processed the carrot, onion and peppers together rather than slicing or chopping.

Excellent recipe. Quick to make and the bulgar eliminates the need to make rice (if you like that with your veggie chili). If you like it spicy you'll need to add some cayenne or your preferred spice.

Excellent recipe. Like some other reviewers I used Boca ground 'burger'in place of the bulger. I also added a bit of oregano and cocoa powder.Served it with whole wheat flour tortilla 'chips'-brushed with oil, sprinkled with salt, cut in quarters and baked on a cookie sheet for 10 minutes at 350F.A rare hit with all three kids!!!Try it. You'll never miss the meat!

I changed this recipe a lot - added half beer instead of water, added some corn and zucchini to the vegetables in the begining and threw in shredded chicken 10 minutes before I served it.

I had never made chili before, so I followed this recipe almost exactly as written. Instead of the bulgur, though, I added meatless ground burger (Boca), as another reviewer did. It added a nice texture, and more protein. I enjoyed the flavor of this recipe, but there are just a few alterations I would make. Next time I make this dish I am probably going to add at least one more jalepeno, and probably some hot sauce as well. I was expecting, by the title of this recipe, that it was going to be spicy, but it was far from it. This is a very hearty dish and great on a cold day or just when you need a little comfort food. I would definitely make this recipe again.

Wonderful flavor and easy to make. I skipped the jalapenos and used fire-roasted Mexican-style tomatoes. Instead of the bulgar, I used 12 ounces of meatless ground burger (Boca), which I added to the onions and carrots during the last few minutes of sauteing. I reduced the water by half. Served with cornbread and a salad, this makes a terrific family meal -- perfect for a cold, rainy night!

I thought this was a fantastic recipe and the perfect launching pad to throw in a couple different ingredients.

Tremendously yummy!
