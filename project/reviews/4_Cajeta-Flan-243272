Walmart usually has cajeta in the hispanic section. I've found it in other major grocery stores but they usually have the small size. "Coronado" brand is the best one. It comes in two flavors: vanilla and my personal preference "quemada" (burnt).

Oh my! This was so delicious! I have never made a flan before and was so surprised at how easy it was. The hardest part was being patient enough for the caramel to reach the right color! We found the cajeta caramel at MexGrocer.com. The flavor of the cajeta is very distinct and really makes this flan a winner.

Delicious! Being from Mexico, this flan brought back memories of my home country. Try to find "Coronado" brand cajeta, sold at Mexican food stores.

Instead of the ramekins, I used a baking pan to prepare this delicious flan. It was sweet just right, so I didn't add the whipped cream. I served the chilled flan in a dish in the middle of the table. All of us, spoons in hand, ate it family-style, and it was gone in no time! It certainly was a success at our party tonight.

I have not attempted to make the recipe but at the restaurant it is wonderful!
