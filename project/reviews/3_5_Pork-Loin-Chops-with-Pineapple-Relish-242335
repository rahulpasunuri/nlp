This reconfirms my inability to cook pork outside of a slow-pot. I had thick, fresh chops, which after the 6-minute pan frying were tough as leather and pretty tasteless from the rub. Did everyone secretly brine and I didn't get the menu?

Yum! I used the rub from "grilled pork chops with pineapple salsa" also on this site. The pineapple relish was a hit at my dinner table. I didn't have serrano chilies, so I used a couple pickled jalapenos and used red onion and a couple tablespoons of chopped parsley for more color. Delicious!

Not bad - I agree with the reviews that thought the coriander taste wasn't strong enough, but I plan to try it again with fresher coriander seeds. The relish is really delicious. I think the recipe must have used very thin pork chops to cook in 6-10 minutes. Give it a try!

This was delicious! My only alteration was that I used Mango vinegar (a pulpy mango vinegar version; yum). I used the Olive oil Misto plus about 1 tsp of olive oil, total (to minimize calories, but still perserve the brown bits for the relish).

This was pretty good. The pineapple sauce was very sweet and I paired it with coconut rice so overall it was a little sweet for my taste. That might have been my fault though...maybe I'll pair it with something a little more savory next time.

Made the recipe almostexactly as written, and it was delicious. Used coriander seeds, freshly ground, and Myers Original Dark Rum. Very easy and good. I had thinner chops, so used 4 instead of 2, and I seeded the serranos.

Didn't have pork....substituted boneless skinless chicken breasts. Didn't have coriander...substituted Culantro leaves crushed with the salt and pepper. Didn't have Serrano...substituted jalapeno. And grated about a teaspoon of fresh ginger into the relish. Other than that, I followed it exactly. LOL. Sorry but I mostly use recipes as a quideline, not the be-all end-all...and it is the joke in my family that I can not follow a recipe exactly. (Also needed to use my garden produce and herbs.) Was pretty darn good! Served with Jasmine Rice.

I will have to respectfully disagree with some of the reviews ive read. They talk about they rather have the pork grilled. That would greatly change the recipe where it wouldn't even be the same thing. The point of this recipe is the sauce and the flavor the fond / pan juices impart into the sauce. If your going to grill the pork you might as well have grilled pineapple with it (which is also delicious). That being said i made one minor modification to the recipe. i used habanero rather than a serrano chile. I like the citrus like flavor the hab brings along with the heat. The sauce and pork were very good. Only minor thing i will probably change in the future is to add garlic to the sauce also. I also served it with brown rice which i recommend.

My family and I thought this was delicious. Will definitely make this again. I found that the pork took longer to cook than stated in the recipe but then again I used pretty thick chops. Thanks!

I used ground cumin (by mistake) instead of ground coriander, regular onion, and left out the chile because of my kids. 3 out of 4 of us really liked it and voted to make it again.

The salsa was delicious, but I would have preferred the pork grilled. I agree with one of the former reviewers that it is great served with brown rice. Double the salsa and mix it into the rice, also. A simple green salad makes a nice side dish. Overall, would try something different with salsa - maybe shrimp or chicken??

This was OK. The pork chops were juicy but we couldn't detect much corriander.The salsa was ok too but not enough heat for our taste.Liked the rum. It was very easy to make but won't be making this one again. So many recipes so little time!

Loved this!! I used ground coriander but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Was *so* easy to make and super tasty - this one will definitely be added to the regular dinner rotation! Served with couscous to absorb the tasty relish juices.

I'm making the chops now...we got them from our organic meat CSA (email if you want to know about it) and I can tell they will be good. Rescued a pineapple that was getting soft and pulled some chilis out of the pantry that we had grown years ago. I'm also putting in some dried & softened cranberries.

I had a couple of chops and wanted a creative way to cook them tonight. This recipe worked out great. I changed it a bit 'cause I didn't have all the ingredients on hand. I used 3/4 bottle of pineapple preserves instead of real pineapple. (I know, that's a big change.) I just love coriander, so I doubled that. I added 1/4 cup of raisins and soaked the raisins in the rum. Very good. I will make again and I'll use real pineapple next time. Thanks for a quick, easy and extra-ordinary way to make pork chops.

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe for dinner tonight. I changed it a bit though. I used about 3/4 bottle of pineapple preserves instead of fresh pineapple 'cause that's what I had in the refrig. Yes, I know that's a huge difference. The preserves kept the flavor of pineapple, but I know we were missing out without the real thing. I also used double the coriander. (I love the taste of coriander!) I used double the rum and added 1/4 cup of raisins, which I soaked in the rum before adding to the relish. The raisins were a welcome addition. I added a little bit of brown sugar too. I served with a seasoned rice/vermicelli mixture. We added the relish into the rice as we were eating. That worked well too. I will be making this again - with fresh or canned pineapple next time.

Poker Guys say Heck Yes on this recipe!! Good Chops!!

Excellent dish! I used canned pineapple tidbits and jalapeno slices, since I didn't have the fresh pineapple or serrano on hand. As a Jimmy Buffett fan, I had to try this Caribbean dish, and I'm glad I did! I will definitely make it again - tasty and quick.

Loved this recipe - kids loved it too! I followed the recipe except used a white onion and jalapeno pepper. The relish was exceptional!

Completely underwhelmed. One of the most bland dishes I have tried. I must be really missing something here, even though I followed the recipe to a 'T'. I even had a serrano pepper. I may have ruined it by trimming most of the huge fatty edge from the chops, rendering almost no brown crusty bits to incorporate into the final sauce. Making this again would require an overhaul, like less pineapple and more rum, pepper, a hotter onion, and other spices to wake up the relish. Maybe some cardamom or something other than coriander.

OMG. This has to be one of the simplest, tastiest, and most utterly *gasp* inducing meals ever created. Used fresh pineapple (yeah it's messy, but so are some of the best things in life...), and we marinated the pork to insure supreme juiciness on the grill. Also used serrano AND a jalapeno, and didn't have any rum. Maybe next time - and believe me, there will be a next time 'cause I'm making this one again ASAP! Unbelievable! O. M. G.!

OMG!!!! What a wonderful dinner for our eighth wedding anniversary...Perfect, And I used ground coriander. I can't say enough. "THE BOMB"

Absolutely lovely! Very simple to make, and the flavors worked very well together... the spiciness of the pork and serrano chili meshed very well with the succulent fresh pineapple. Definetly a keeper, especially when pineapple is fresh and cheap. I served it with tortilla chips to enjoy the rest of the relish.

I like this recipe for the pineapple relish and substituted a jalapeño for the serano because others had done likewise. Otherwise, I used a pork loin roast generously seasoned with Lawry's seasoning salt and garlic salt and ground coriander seeds and cooked it on a spit for 50 minutes.

Very good and easy to make. My only complaint is that there is too much relish to go with the chops. I didn't know what to do with all the leftovers.

Other than dicing the pineapple and other salsa ingredients, this was very quick and easy. It tasted very fresh and healthy, served with corn on the cob and mango and a mango and strawberry fruit salad. I have to admit though....I used jalapeno since I did not have serrano...other than that, I followed the recipe and would definitely make it again!

Very easy to prepare for a week night dinner. It has wonderful flavor and everyone in the family loved it....healthy too.

Yum, super easy to put together. Made it for lunch today & will use it for a dinner party tomorrow. I used frozen pineapple tidbits from Trader Joe's & fresh jalapeno. I think I'll add a bit more salt to the relish next time. Ground the coriander seed with the salt & pepper in the spice grinder. Makes a great rub that I'll use again! We love hot & spicy, but you might want to taste it before adding all the chili to the relish. Used orange-pineapple juice & 1/4 t of rum flavoring instead of rum. Cut back on the oil, in a good pan you don't need it all.

Couldn't be quicker or tastier. Corriander rub is perfect contrast to the sweet pineapple. Substituted mild pepper and dash of red pepper flakes for chile-- grocery store didn't have any. This added nice body to the salsa.
