Liked the sound of the recipe where you can bake the shells without their tart pans, on a baking sheet, and they won't collapse. I was skeptical, since these mini-tart shells always seem to collapse unless supported with a form, foil and beans. But I tried it...followed the recipe exactly (except used unbleached flour) and froze the shells overnight before baking. And guess what? After about 5 minutes in the oven, they were flat as pancakes! I'm disappointed, because the description sounded so great...not having to have so many little tart pans, etc. Would love to know what I could do differently to get the prescribed result...any ideas?

This recipe is goof proof and delicious. I added rosemary, thyme and seasalt . The glaze to brown the tops works wonderfully. Will make a few batches and freeze. I cut one batch into small triangles and topped with herbed goat cheese...yum
