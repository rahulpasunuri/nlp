Nice and different side, was looking for an alternative to the same old green salad. I made this per recipe, with the 1 exception of sautéing sliced almonds with the currants/balsamic/shallot mixture at the end for just about 30 seconds to a minute. I didn't have parsley, so had to leave that out. It is one of those salads that grew on me, first bite was good, but by the 5th or 6th bite I was saying "I really like this!". My hubby isn't a fan of red cabbage, but really liked this as well. If you're looking for something a little different, definitely worth trying (super easy and good)!

This was spectacular. I used bacon instead of pancetta and golden raisins instead of currents. Oh, and onion instead of shallot. But so easy to make, really fast, and my friends loved it. Would be great for a potluck. I served it with baked fish and home-made bread.

Seriously delicious. Bacon works. So do raisins. Added more shallot. Loved it

The idea of this sounded right up our alley. The only problem I had with it- was the cabbage I bought must have been old, despite slicing it razer thin it was tough. I didn't find the tartness quite came through and the pancetta that I did saute right at the time of serving-faded in the red cabbage. I might try it with a more tender cabbage like a chinese cabbage.

Delicious! Every compenent of this dish melds with or foils to the others perfectly. We made this to recipe and will definitely make it again. The pancetta is key. We used a 25 year old balsamic that was deeply flavoured and sweet...perfect! I can see how this would also work well in a sandwich as a complement to pulled pork or perhaps with prosciutto and buffalo mozzarella. Try this!

Amazing, must use pancetta. I thought it was even better the next day as leftovers. I think would be great on a sandwhich, like sliced pork tenderloin or something.

OK, I'll admit it, we used bacon instead of pancetta because we already had it in the fridge. This smelled delicious (although don't take too big a whiff of the warm vinegar!) but the salad itself was really disappointing. We'll try it again with pancetta since everyone else seems so excited about this recipe, but with this one substitution it was really blah.

Delicious. Fresh, new flavors. Not to heavy, just the right crunch. A great way to use cabbage and not have it be the same ol' slaw. I added more balsamic vinegar. Could be done with double smoked bacon and have the the same great flavor. The currants provide just enough sweetness.

Made exactly as written, minus the currants (I used craisins). I liked this salad a lot. The pancetta makes it.

After another week of red cabbage from our garden share, we were looking for something new to do with it and boy did we find a special recipe! We got a little package of pancetta already chopped from Trader Joe's and substituted the currants with a dried berry mix (cranberries, blueberries, strawberries). The salad was really easy to make and the result was sweet, salty and crunchy. Absolutely delicious. The leftovers were just as good the next day, as the dressing is not heavy and doesn't wilt the cabbage. This will definitely be the go-to recipe whenever we get red cabbage.

It's great! Sweet and sour blend perfectly with cabbage - the salty pancetta puts it over the top. Definitely a great crunchy salad for when you are tired of green leaves! We've had it with grilled fish and it was wonderful. I bet it be good with any grilled meat. Or on a picnic!

LOVE this salad. It is perfect as written. I have occasionally substituted dried cranberries for currants because they are easier to get. But otherwise just wonderful.

I thought it was good, my husband thought it was fantastic. He had it with some beer braised pulled pork and just loved it. This will become a regular.

This was fantastic! Seriously, one of the top recipes I've made from epicurious (chicken in reisling, you're still the king of my heart, but only just...) I used thick, pepper-crusted bacon and reduced the balsamic a bit before making the vinagrette. One of the best salads I've ever made. Make it, you will love it.

Wow! Such yummy results with such a few ingredients! I used red wine vinegar instead of balsamic because I was out of balsamic vinegar, and to be honest I prefer red wine vinegar. Anyhow, it's a pretty impressive dish considering the ease of it. I also used dried cranberries instead of currants because my local market does not carry currants. I think either would be fine! I do think the pancetta made a huge impact in the salad and I'm glad I made the effort to purchase it instead of just using bacon. The pancetta holds up better in such a salad, especially if you have leftovers like I did. Bottom line? Impressive and colorful!

My husband is iffy on cabbage, so I did as much as I could to follow this recipe. Unfortunately, I had to substitute some things because I didn't have them in the house: dried cranberries for the currants, sweet onion instead of shallot, and walnuts instead of almonds - but otherwise kept to the recipe. He LOVED it. I did add a few shavings of raw carrot to the thin-sliced cabbage, but not very much, just some color. Wonderful. Great way to ease people into cabbage who haven't already come over to the cabbage side! :)

yes, this was yummy. i happen to really like all of the ingredients. think i used extra pancetta. i also warmed the entire salad in the pan before serving. perhaps next time, i might drain off some of the fat and add a bit more olive oil, and touch lemon juice.

simply delish. (a note to fusionfoodie...pancetta is cured not smoked, bacon is smoked. Different taste.)

Fantastic! Sweet, savory, salty and crunchy- positively addictive! Made it as a side for short ribs but think it stole the show. Only change was to substitute dried cranberries for the currants- lovely. I'm guessing even better tomorrow and could be a main course salad with a little grilled chicken on top.Definitely a keeper!

Great salad and even better the next day. Will be making this one all summer long.

This was a lovely salad. I sprinkled goat cheese on the warm salad and it added a nice flavor. I wouldn't skip the pancetta. More interesting flavor than bacon and doesn't cost any more.

Excellent. A nice change from green salad. I altered one serving for a vegetarian guest by sauteing the shallot in olive oil and adding a pinch of smoke paprika to make up for the absence of pancetta. I have to disagree with the use of turkey bacon. It really should be outlawed.

Very tasty. Side note: I can't think of any reason to buy expensive pancetta. Read the label and you will find it is cured with the same chemicals as American bacon. There is no convincing argument that Italian pigs taste better than American pigs. So buy a bacon slab at any supermarket and ask the man behind the counter to trim all skin and cut it paper thin on his slicer. Wrap portions in cling wrap and put it in the freezer until...

Wow! I registered after years of using epicurious just to rate this dish. I thought it was amazing. I used turkey bacon because we don't eat pork and it was so great! It was interesting, easy, and delicious Bravo, Ms. Sinskey, Bravo.

A wonderfully crisp salad that has lots of textures and flavors. I'm sure people could zing it up a bit more with some other ingredients, maybe some diced apple or some interesting spices, but as it is, it's a nice crunchy, salty, sweet side dish that will go well with grilled dishes. Note: I didn't have pancetta and used a thick-cut bacon instead with good results.
