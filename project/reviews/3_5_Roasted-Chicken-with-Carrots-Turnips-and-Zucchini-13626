This recipe is straight forward. The key is to get a great chicken. We used whatever herbs we had on hand and it was still wonderful. We even through some potatoes in, but they needed longer to cook but gave us a ready to go starch.

love this recipe! I've been making it for my family for years. The sauce is wonderful and the vegetable combination is excellent, though sometimes I can't find decent turnips here in south Florida. Garlic mashed potatoes are the perfect side.

I was disappointed by this recipe. My vegetables were unevenly cooked and the herb/spice mixture did not work for me. My guests raved about it though (for that reason I moved it form 2-3 forks), but I think they were just being nice.

This was unbelievably good - maybe the best thing I've made from this site so far. This was also the first roast chicken I've made, so I'm surprised it came out this good. I served it over polenta. I also rubbed some of the herb butter over the entire chicken, not just under the breast skin, before putting it in the oven. Oh, and I didn't have a flameproof roaster, so I just did my best to scrape up the stuff from the roasting pan and put it in a frying pan, and the gravy came out just fine.

This is a great and versatile recipe, I encourage experimentation with your favorite spices and root vegetables. I just happened to have a whole chicken, some turnips, a zucchini and yellow squash, and some carrots and was looking for a recipe for roasted chicken and veggies. I did not use the same spice mixture, nor did I put the butter under the skin, but followed the cooking time and gravy instructions (with my spice mixture, of course). I added potatoes and whole garlic cloves to the veggies called for here and tossed everything in olive oil before I threw them in the pan. Even with all of those changes, the end result was really something. The chicken was very moist with crispy skin, and the vegetables were delicious. I do think adding oil to the pan helped because my bird did not render much fat, and the 5 lb chicken cooked perfectly at the time called for here. I would lay off the salt in the gravy because the broth concentrated is salty enough on its own. This will definitely be my starting point for roasted chicken from now on.

This is soooooo good! I used baby potatos instead of turnips. The gravy was wonderful!

This chicken was both tender and full of flavor. I am a fan of butter so I added a bit more under the skin. Overall, everyone in the house loved it, although the turnips were not a huge favorite. Perhaps potatoes would work better. I'll definitely be making this again!

My picky wife loved the recipe. One note: my cooking time was almost double what the recipe called for.

We thought this was a good recipe, but not great. I liked the herb butter, and the chicken turned out very moist. The vegetables were somewhat disappointing, though. Not a lot of flavor and kind of dry. I think I'd substitute parsnips for the turnips next time.

Normally, I make the recipe as written. This time I had to substitute some fresh basil and parsley for the cilantro because the cilantro looked really bad at the store. Surprisingly, it worked very well with the cumin and coriander. I butterflied the bird instead of tying it up and followed the rest of the directions. It is VERY tasty, the whole family loved it.

I thought this was an encellent recipe which I will make again. However, I do not agree with some of the other reviewers who think this is the end all roast chicken recipe. I think next time I will add a some thyme the the spice blend as it seemed to lack depth. The vegetables were a wonderful accompaniment. To the reviewer who couldn't find "fresh corriander," it is commonly known as celantro and is readily available in almost every supermarket.

I could not find fresh corriander. So I went without. This was very good but not as good as the reviews I read below. Maybe the fresh herb makes a difference? It was okay to make once but very labor intensive to make regularly.

This was great. The first time that I have roasted a chicken. So very flavorful and moist! I did not use zucchini however, but instead added red and yellow pepper to roast and also put a few green onions inside of the chicken cavity before cooking. Great with roasted garlic mashed potatoes.

WOW! This is one great recipe. One pan meal...so easy to make. Savory flavor. My boyfriend loved it. The leftovers were wonderful. I used sweet potatoes rather than turnips. The whole dish is yummy. Will make again and again.

I'm declining to rate it, since I haven't made the dish yet. However, I'm planning to, as it looks delicious. I also wanted to add that I found this recipe searching for "cumin" and "turnips... I discovered to my surprise this weekend, playing in the kitchen, that these two ingredients work wonderfully together. I'm not usually a turnip fan, but I wanted to try to make them palatable to me as they have so many health benefits. So if you're skeptical about the combination, as I might have been, don't worry.

Would I make it again?!!!!! I have made it again! It is wonderful. I used sweet potatoes and turnips it was wonderful. This has become a family favorite.

Well, I impressed myself *again* thanks to Epicurious and the reviewers. Never roasted a chicken before, made this last night using more vegetables and including rutabaga and yams as well as the veggies in the recipe - Wow! Also made roasted garlic mashed potatoes. It was so delicious I was positively groaning with pleasure, had seconds even though I was stuffed. With an apple-blueberry crisp and vanilla frozen yoghurt for desert, my goodness, I thought I'd gone to heaven :) Even phoned my mother to brag about it.

Yummy. Make extra of the spice mixture, add a bit of lemon juice to it, and be sure to also put it between the skin and thigh meat. The prior suggestion about making extra veggies and using sweet potato is a great one!

I have made this dish several times and it has become a favorite. I sometimes use sweet potatoes, rutabagas, parsnips, etc., in lieu of the above. I also make more vegetables than the recipe calls for since they got fast! The seasonings are fabulous.
