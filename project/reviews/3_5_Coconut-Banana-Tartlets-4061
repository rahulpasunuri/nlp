Our family found this dessert cloyingly sweet. The sweetened coconut combined with quite a lot of sugar is too much. I wouldn't make this dish again without some adjusting.

OK, let's get real. How many of us have 4" tartlet pans with removable bottoms in the pantry? I used a 10" fluted tart dish and it worked fine. I skipped the disc chill step. Kneaded and rolled the dough; pressed it into the tart dish and refrigerated it for a few hours. From there I baked the dough as directed, filled it and put it into the oven, skipping the freezing step as well. Yummy, super rich and decadent. Serve with whipped cream since it isn't the prettiest pie I've ever seen.

This was delicious and easy to make. I also used an 8 inch tart pan and cooked it for about 45 minutes to make sure the filling was set. I served it with some whipped cream. I had a hard time rolling the crust so I just patted it in the pan and it worked out fine.

This was incredible!! So easy, so delicious. I have home grown Ice Cream Bananas and need many recipes to use them all up!! I made as is, but I did add 1/2 coconut milk to the filling which added a bit more coconut flavor. It was SO perfect, the crust was crispy and on its own tasted like a coconut cookie. My guests raved, and it was gone in a flash. Oh, and I baked it in one 8 inch tart pan until it was set, about 30 mins.

This was very delicious. I would like to know if there are instructions for baking in a regular sized tart pan (like 10 inches, for example). The tarlets were as good as I thought they'd be.
