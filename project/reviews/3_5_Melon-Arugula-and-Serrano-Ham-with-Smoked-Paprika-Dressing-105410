Delicious! Salty, sweet, tart and savory. Any ripe melon will do (with the exception of watermelon.) Prosciutto and speck can substitute for pricy serrano ham. Use the best quality smoked paprika you can find. Adjust the proportion of dressing ingredients to the tartness of the lime juice. Serve very soon after dressing or suffer wilting - the taste is still good, but a wilted salad isn't very pretty to look at.

Fantastic salad, but only three forks for the recipe because I made some changes--added about 1/2 t. honey to the dressing (it made it much smoother), used proscuitto instead of serrano ham,and added shaved parmesan. I also used a sprite melon instead of the cantaloupe/honeydew. Still, a great start for a new favorite!

This recipe is the bomb!!!! I have made it three times at dinner parties and everyone has loved it. If you toss the salad just before serving as suggested there is no wilting problems. I have used both proscuitto and speck in the salad and both work great. I use orange flesh and galia melons.

I thought this was wonderful.I tossed it with the dressing right before serving, and did not have a wilting problem.

Major wilting/sogging out problem. Love that smoked paprika, tho.

Nice variation on the somewhat clichéed ham with melon. I followed the recipe except instead of slicing the ham I laid 2 slices per person over the salad and melon. Make sure to use both green and orange melon for the contrast. It looks lovely - guests were impressed. The dressing complemented the ham/melon flavors quite well.

I made this for a dinner party. The guests likes it. It may have been a bit soggy from the ripe melon, I think more paprika would help. When I try it again I am going to use fresh paprika ground from the paprika pepper growing in my garden. I will let you know how well that goes!
