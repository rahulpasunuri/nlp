Interesting: I didn't read these reviews before I made this recipe. I was cooking from the magazine article. I didn't have a problem with the blandness but I used a mix of butternut squash and pumpkin (not sure which but it has a green skin) which I think helped. I also used creamed coconut which might be a little different than coconut cream (?) I also (important I think!) added a can of chickpeas which gave more depth to the meal and I cut the creamed coconut to 1/2 a cup because it was too rich. Upped the cumin and the garlic. I really liked this recipe otherwise, I didn't add or change any other spices. Oh, and a healthy sprinkle of Kosher salt and more lime juice at the end finishes it off really well. http://brownstonebaking.wordpress.com/

At best, what I can say is... meh. Strange texture, not a lot of flavor. My boyfriend said it had just one note and he was right. We're saving the leftovers and will try them tomorrow; maybe sitting overnight will impart some flavor.

Zero forks. Why? Bland, bland, bland. My boyfriend asked me to make this recipe, so I blame him. The amount of effort to really follow this recipe (getting curry leaves and dried arbol chiles) doesn't pay off. My recommendation: Instead of any spices (ingredients 3-6, 8, 9), use 1/4 cup of Maeploy brand yellow curry paste. If you insist on approximating this recipe from scratch, omit red onions and use 3 or 4 shallots, double all the spices, add a tablespoon or more of salt, and add a cup or two of veggie stock.

I was definitely disappointed with the outcome. The curry was bland, and it didn't even look appetizing on the plate. The red onions turned the sauce a nasty grayish color. Wouldn't make again.

I made this taking into account all the comments' suggested changes and implemented all of them. It was not spectacular and we will never make it again.

Added allot of veggies to it and it makes a good meal. Used about 1T currie powder instead of the leaves.

I agree with other reviewers - it is 4 forks when modified with light coconut milk and no need for special trip to indian grocer. I got fabulous compliments especially from my vegan friends for such a delicious Halloween dinner. Definitely worth making, might need a bit extra salt to bring out flavor.

How disappointing. After stops at three specialty/ethnic shops to find the exact ingredients and quite a bit of time cleaning and cutting the pumpkin the result was so bland as to be laugable. Unappetizing on the plate as well. Not even worth trying again with butternut squash.

I didn't rate it because I changed the recipe so much, but even with simplifying it down a ton, it turned out great! I used ground curry, chili powder, ground mustard & ground ginger in place of all the fresh stuff. I also used 2 cans of light coconut milk in place of the coconut cream/milk combo. It turned out really yummy (great for Halloween dinner!) with great flavors-- and I didn't need a special trip to the Indian market.

I thought that this turned out to be a four fork recipe after I modified it incorporating some of the other reviewer's suggestions. I added additional cumin and turmeric plus a half tsp. salt when the recipe asks for you to add the spices. I put the onions in and let them brown before adding the garlic and ginger. I put two cans of unsweetened coconut milk instead of the 1.5 cups unsweetened coconut milk and coconut cream. I also put more pumpkin than was called for. I put additional curry leaves at the beginning, I snapped a couple of the red peppers before throwing them in (also put about 6 or 7 instead of 3), the thai garlic chili paste was an excellent addition (I added a half Tbsp.). I also added a few cups of spinach. I simmered this dish on low heat for about an hour before eating it. Let the flavors mingle. It was delicious but not exactly according to the recipe.

This is a very good recipe. I do agree that it needed salt, so we added some, and also added some Thai chili garlic paste that we had on hand. Used curry powder and subbed water & milk for the coconut cream, as others did. Very good flavors! Will definitely make again.

I agree with the "Cook from NC". This dish was very complex for the average home cook and missing some key instructions and ingredients. After adding salt and making the same substitutions that "North Carolina" did, I still was unsatisfied with all the effort and the output. The pumpkin just doesn't shine in this dish. It's curry, but not one I would make again.

I concur with the folks who found this very bland. I made it according to the recipe, traipsing to the Indian market for the curry leaves and black mustard seeds. Are you supposed to break open the chilies? I generally do when I cook with them, but the recipe didn't indicate, so I didn't. Perhaps that would have given it more flavor. When you're writing a recipe that is going to be a stretch for some cooks, you really need to be explicit with the instructions. Factoring in the special trip to the Indian market and the time-consuming process of cutting up and peeling the pumpkin, it just wasn't worth the effort. We threw out the leftovers, and we NEVER throw out leftovers.

I'm making this again tonight-2nd time in one week! This recipe lends itself well to using what you have on hand-curry powder instead of leaves, yellow mustard seeds instead of black, etc. Light coconut milk works great instead of milk + cream, and the texture of the sauce was excellent. One KEY missing ingredient is salt! It's never mentioned and maybe the author assumes the cook will salt to taste, but the dish is indeed very bland without it. Taste and add salt once the curry has simmered with the pumpkin in it.

This was pretty tasty. If I were to make it again, I think I would skip the coconut cream, and just use the can of coconut milk. The cream made it just a little too rich. I couldn't find curry leaves, so I substited curry powder, which I am sure gives a different result but was pretty good.

This recipe was okay.... I thought it was a little bland as well, which made the coconut milk had the sauce so cream that it coated the roof of my mouth. If I were to make it again, I'd add some spice, and cut the coconut milk with some broth.

Very good. I changed the recipe a bit. I substituted 1 tbs curry powder for the mustard seeds and the curry leave, a pinch of hot chili powder for the chiles and water for the coconut cream (I couldn't find all the ingredients I substituted for). Delicious and slightly more nutritious than the written recipe.

This was sooo good! My husband and I loved it. I'm hooked. It is the perfect warm dish on a cool autumn day. The nutty cashews with the creamy coconut and lightly spicy flavors are a great combination and the pumpkin that just melts in your mouth. After reading the last review I was nervous how it would turn out so I roasted the pumpkin in the oven with some of the onions thinking it might give it a crispy texture but mine got really tender and soft and just melted in my mouth it was sooo good. I can't imagine it otherwise now. And it made it easy to do too. And then I added just a little sugar to the sauce and some fresh basil along with the cilantro...even without this though I think it is a fantastic dish. I am really excited about enjoying this dish during the fall. Definitely reccommend trying it.

I made this last week and found it to be VERY bland. I had some the next day for lunch and is was better. But I still would not recommend it, and don't really know which spices I'd increase. What I would do is, NOT put the garlic and ginger in with the onions. They cook much quicker and tended to burn.
