Pretty nice basic recipe. It really does need some more flavor, though. Red onions, diced bell peppers feta, cherry tomatoes, olives, those sorts of things. That's a different recipe, though. As is, it's fine. Just a bit boring.

A good beany salad that's a tasty addition to a larger meal or a potluck (and very pretty). The sundried tomatoes add color and texture but not much flavor. I had some salad left over and put it all (except the cucumbers) in a processor, added some tahini and some more cumin (ground) and made hummus. That was a bonus and turned out great.

This is pretty epic. I added a bit of labne thinned with lemon juice to this because i had some in the fridge but it was epic without it, too. i just finished off the bit that was left for lunch today and it was still great even refrigerated overnight. this will be my vegetarian go-to dish for sure.

My problem with this dish is the cumin seed. You cannot really taste them, unless you happen to bite into one, in which case it overpowers everything else. I guess I just find the cumin taste too harsh for such a light, fresh salad - I will leave it out next time.

This was a very flavorful, simple recipe. I basically made it as the recipe indicated, although I did increase the cucumber, and added some pomegrante seeds, which proved to be a wonderful addition, while keeping it true to its ethnicity.

I made this recipe 2 days in advance, added the cucumber a day in advance, and sent it off to a party. It was delicious, and held up well. I agree with other reviewers, it would make a great base for other flavours, such as feta, other vegetables such as peppers or fresh tomatoes.

I love chickpeas but I found this dish terribly flat. The flavors didn't meld well together. I'm always looking for new non-meat protein dishes...there are better ones here!

This would get three forks if it weren't so easy -- but it was so flexible and yummy that it gets four as a weeknight dinner or a side. I made it toward the end of the week and had some grape tomatoes, kalamata olives, and feta left over from previous meals, so those went in, in addition to everything else the recipe calls for. Except I didn't have cumin seed, so just used ground. Also, I didn't really measure anything. Anyway, it was bangin', nice to get rid of stuff that would have otherwise gone bad, and had an incredible layered flavor due to the different densities and textures of everything in it. Served it with brown basmati rice and grocery store naan. The Boyfriend could stop eating.

This recipe is totally delicious. I didn't have any sundried tomatoes around and used fresh tomatoes instead and it was very good. I also substituted parsley with cilantro (which i love and had lying around) and it gave it excellent flavor. Would definitely make again!

I've made this twice now. We love the blend of flavors & how good it is for you. It's one of my hubby's favorites. I did put a little less than a tablespoon of cumin (it was a little strong for me) and I liked it much better the second time.

I made this for a few colleagues -- many of whom had never tried Mediterranean food -- and it was a hit! I added more sundried tomatoes and hot pepper than the recipe recommends adds for more kick. My colleagues couldn't get enough! I would definitely make this again.

Even better the next day, and a snap to make...which add up to a great dish for picnics or entertaining. I used more than 1/3 c. of sun-dried tomatoes. It did get soupy at the bottom of the bowl, so drain those tomatoes well (paper towels work nicely) and go easy on the olive oil.

A good summer salad. The tomatoes were a little lost, I would substitute greek olives instead. The Cumin oil added an interesting flavor.

I simmered the pepper flakes and garlic with the olive oil to extract more flavor. Also added a bit of lemon zest. I used unmarinated sundried tomatoes, but would have preferred more flavorful marinated (though well-drained) ones.

This is definitely a keeper. Since it has a unique taste I didn't want to compromise it by adding other ingredients. I just followed the recipe as is and it was wonderful. I served it with a side dish of Basmati rice and they complemented each other very nicely as a main dish.

I made this for a family dinner, and nothing was left within the first ten minutes. I think that I would let the flavours marinade longer together before serving next time. I cannot believe that something so easy and nutritious can taste so good!

A nice change from boring salads! I love the mix of textures and flavors, I'll be making it again very soon. I didn't have cumin seeds on hand, but ground cumin seemed to work OK, as did dried parsley instead of fresh. I prepared everything as directed, then tossed with baby spinach leaves.

I thought that this salad was very flavorful and quick to make. It definitely tastes better if allowed to chill for awhile before serving, so the flavors marry.

I don't understand why this has so many negative reviews! With a few small changes, this was great! Lots of flavor, and easy to make. Use cilantro instead of parsley and add some red onions for that authentic middle eastern flavor. Yummy!

I was really excited about this recipe, but something in the combination did not appeal to me. I think the sun dried tomatoes were too oily. I would recommend using dried ones.

This salad is healthy and delicious. The salty, chewy, oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes are essential, as are the crispy cumin seeds. I ate it today for breakfast with boiled eggs, toast, and a glass of milk.

we love chickpeas and this was a great flavor to compliment them.

Wow this is good! The cumin seeds really make the salad with their crunch and flavor -- don't skip on this. And the pepper gives it a nice bite. I didn't have cucumbers on hand, so I made it with cherry tomatoes to include some fresh veggies. I also subbed cilantro for the parsley. This is worthy of guests, and it's so easy to make! Great recipe.

I agree that this salad didn't have any "punch". It seemed to be lacking something to make it really great - cilantro? Definitely make it a day ahead of time to allow flavors to blend.

I thought the texture of the cumin seeds and freshness of the cucumber blended nicely with the chickpeas, which I love. I found the dish to be visually pleasing as well. My 13 year old son even approved. I'm only sorry that I made 1/2 a recipe! I will definately make this again.

very interesting taste. i used the cumin seeds and followed recipe as written. rich tasting, smoky, unusual. I thought it'd taste more like cumin, but it didn't have that mexicany kind of taste. i'd make it again. maybe brighten it up with a bit more lemon juice.

Even though I added more lemon juice, pepper flakes, feta cheese and capers, this salad just didn't have the "punch" I had hoped for. It was good, but not outstanding.

Good, but not amazing. Just a good chick pea salad. I think adding onions and feta would be a good idea. I didn't have cumin seeds, just ground cumin, which ended up being fine. Overall, a good side salad.

This salad was deeelicious! Used dried sundried tomatoes soaked for 5 minutes in boiling water. Used less oil than indicated and used ground cumin rather than seeds. Used can of mixed beans (including chickpeas) rather than just chickpeas. Also threw in some chopped purple onions. Yum!! Will make it over and over.

Really did not enjoy this salad, though, as others have said, like all the ingredients individually. Thought it was unattractive, bland and strange tasting at the same time. Did add some purple onion, which helped a little.

I prepared this dish according to the recipe, except for reducing the olive oil to two tablespoons and using dry-pack sundried tomatoes instead of oil-pack. I also added slightly more lemon juice, but only because I LOVE it, not because the dish needed it. It was delicious, piquant, healthful, and admired by my husband as well. It kept wonderfully, and was the bed to a lucky salmon fillet a few days later. I had to squirrel away a couple of containers to take for my lunch...there seemed to be a band of marauding chick pea salad fanatics raiding the serving bowl after hours. Definitely a repeat performer! Thank you!

I thought this was fab and was a big hit at a dinner party. I couldn't find the seeds so I used powder and sauteed it with the garlic and crushed pepper. Thinly sliced red onions are a nice addition. I'm making it again for a bbq this weekend. yummy!

Yuck. I love each of these ingredients individually, but together in this recipe they don't mesh well. It looks pretty, but lacks flavor. I can see how adding artichokes or feta, as others have done, might help. I personally wouldn't dare serve this to others.

I have made several versions of this recipe. All with excellent results. You just can't go wrong with garbonzo beans. I've tried it with quartered artichoke hearts or drained black beans or cilantro instead of parsley. A little chopped red onion is always good. It's just as satisfying with half the olive oil.

I made this from the mag earlier this summer, and was glad to see it part of the Recipe Flash e-mail that Epicurious sends out. The blend of flavors is absolutely outstanding, and makes a great accompaniment to pretty much anything you can throw on the grill. The light lemon note works beautifully with grilled fish, while the robust parsley and garlic are a perfect foil for grilled chicken, pork or even beef kebabs. It also works well right out of the bowl at midnight while hunkered over the sink with a fork. Gets better with a little time to blend. A rare 4-Fork salad.

Delicious refreshing salad. The flavours are more intense the next day. I have a friend who does not like parsley so I put aside some salad and substituted the parsley with fresh basil; turned out great too.

Super yummy and healthy. Don't skimp on the lemon juice. Would indeed go well with a Middle Eastern menu, too. I did not have cumin seeds either but I did cook the ground cumin in the olive oil for a minute or so to enhance its aroma. It's common in Indian cooking to first cook a spice mixture in the heated oil to maximize and enhance the flavor...

Delicious! This easy recipe is perfect in the summer... Did not find it necessary to cook the oil and cumin together (as I did not have seeds, just powder) and it was great.

This was a lot better the next day. I wasn't sure whether to strain out the seeds but was glad I didn't, they gave it a nice flavor. Could be used as a side dish with Mexican, Middle-Eastern or Indian dishes.
