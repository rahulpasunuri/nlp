Great recipe! I use less lime juice and a little tamari ( soy sauce,reduced salt) in the marinade, more cilantro and less butter(1 Tbspoon) and whole wheat bread crumbs instead of panko

This is delicious, quick and easy. My dinner guests immediately asked for the recipe. A good go-to summer recipe. Served with Quinoa and Mango Salsa. Delish!

Excellent dish. I made it for 6 and added shredded coconut to the crust mixture as another reviewer suggested. Served it with black Thai rice and mango salsa. Rave reviews!

So good - cut the lime marinade time and I also finished the fish off in the broiler for a couple minutes so the top browned. Served with mango salsa that we found from this site and it totally made the dish - the mango really brings out the flavors of everything else. Served with brown rice for a very healthy dish!

Perfect fish recipe - easy to make and easy to clean up. I added a tsp of minced garlic to the lime juice and marinaded for only 30 minutes (as other reviewers suggested). Also, cut the butter by half. Substituted cashews for macadamia nuts and crushed them with a wine bottle (my rolling pin). Broiled for a couple of minutes at the end to brown. Big Major Yum!

this was amazing- served with mango salsa it is incredibly flavorful without being too heavy. Everyone loved it and its now an entertaining standby!

I love macadamia nuts so this was appealing when I read the recipe. I found I needed to cook the fish longer and would have liked the nuts crunchier. Will try it again and broil at the end.

I didn't have panko; so I thought what the heck, I have parmesan! I used freshly grated parm, macadamias, & dried parsley. Awesome!!! Baked about 20 mins. Husband & son thought it was awesome, but I spooned leftover liquids over the fish tableside... to die for. Restaurant quality.

I would definitely make this again. I tried it with fresh grouper and it was great!

I like this more and more everytime I make it. Crunchie and delicious. I usually make a fruit salsa to go with it, but it doesn't really need it. I usually turn the oven to 425 and increase the cooking time. The mahi we get here has been pretty thick (inch & 1/2) and needs addtional time. The crust gets nice and crispy. It sooo easy too!

I only marinated the mahimahi for 30 minutes, but otherwise prepared it as written. It is a very easy dish to prepare. The next time, I will only use a tablespoon of butter to mix in with the topping, and will use cooking spray in the baking dish to cut down on the fat/calories. I also broiled it for a few seconds to brown the top. Try letting the dish sit for a few minutes rather than direct from the heat. The flavors seem to stand out better. This is a keeper especially to WOW guests.

This worked well substituting cod for mahimahi and pistachios for macadamias.

Wonderful! I made this last night and it was a hit! I made it with Salmon and swordfish instead of the Mahi. It was great with both but best with the salmon. I used lemon juice not lime and only marinated 30 minutes. I only used half the butter. A keeper! I served this with white rice and the avacado tropical fruit salsa also found on this site.

This is the type of recipe I enjoy making on a hot summer night--quick & delicious. Do not over marinate mahimahi in the lime juice. I ran out of panko so I used wheat bread crumbs, which was an o.k. substitue. I know the panko will be even better next time I make this dish.

This was FABULOUS! We had a similar dish at a local restaurant last week ($27) and I wanted to duplicate it. Honestly, this was every bit as good...moist, flavorful...we were making yum sounds throughout the meal. I did add a little coconut to the panko mixture. Served it with the mango salsa from this site which was perfect and colorful on the plate. For a side dish, black Thai rice, which really made it. You can only find this in Oriental markets, but it's fabulous. If you find it, use 1 cup rice, 1 cup chicken broth, and 1 cup coconut milk. Cook, covered for 25 minutes. It's nutty, creamy and beautiful. Unlike any other rice you've ever tasted.

This was BRILLIANT and oh so easy to make! Would be good with almost any kind of fish....I plan to try it with monkfish. (also maybe chicken breasts!) Now I'll always have a jar of macadamia nuts in my pantry!

I use Halibut and Salmon instead of Mahi Mahi - TERRIFIC! Easiest and fastest fish recipe I ever used. Make sure you have a chopper to chop up the nuts.

Rating: 3
I made a few alterations. Mahi Mahi isn't easy to find in Singapore, so I used fresh Salmon. I soaked the fish for only 10 minutes, as I wasn't sure how the lime would compliment the salmon...this amount of time added the right amount of lime flavor. The sweetness of the salmon combined with salty/sweet macadamias was a wonderful combination. Have already made again.

Loved It. A great variation from the same old mahimahi recipes. I also shortened marinade, added a touch of coconut and garlic. I served it with grilled pineapple and an Asian inspired green salad at a dinner party. Easy and fun dinner---Got rave reviews!!!!

This looked as nice and tasted as good as any restaurant version! My family raved about it. I combined several recommendations from other users and it turned out wonderful. I was cooking for 6, so I quadrupled the recipe and still had a little leftover. I added coconut to the topping in the same proportion as the nuts. This added a perfect sweet balance to the topping. I used roasted, salted macadamia nuts, but be careful in the food processor - it turns to butter very quickly. I added some lemon juice to the lime for the marinade and reduced the time to a little over half hour. In the end, I couldn't taste any lime at all - some would have been OK. I also added garlic (puree) to the butter in the casserole dish. I cooked 20 minutes but the thick mahi-mahi steaks could have used a few more minutes. Definitely broil the fish for a few minutes at the end to crisp the crust. Enjoy!

Most recipies tell you not to leave fish in an acidic marinade for more than 15 minutes or so. I was leary about leaving the fish in the lime juice for so long since the acid can "cook" the fish, but this didn't happen with the mahi. Oddly, it seemed to make it juicier.It probably wouldn't be a good idea to substitute a more delicate fish like trout or flounder. Anyway, we loved it. Even the hubby who claims he doesn't like mahi. I HATE to admit this, but I did make a small substitution or two. I didn't have cilantro so I used a mix of fresh parsley & mint in the crumb topping. I also pressed a clove of garlic into the melted butter in the baking dish and it balanced the citrus perfectly. Another thing, it could be that the people who found it too limey may not have gotten all the lime juice off the fish before putting it in the baking pan. I also had to run it under the broiler for a minute to brown the crust.

Marinating the fish 1/2 hour cuts down on the lime taste so the other flavors come through

Disappointing, especially after reading all of the rave reviews. The finished fish looked great but lacked any flavor other than lime. I served it with a great tropical fruit salsa, but that didn't make up for how bland the fish tasted.

This was really great, very quick and easy but impressive for guests(my fav. combo). The crust actually stayed on. Served with pineapple salsa and everyone loved it.

Delicious, I made this recipe several years ago and never forgot it. Just made it again last night and it was every bit as good as I'd remembered. I marinated the fish in the lime for no more than an hour and the lime taste was perfectly subtle.

This was so delicious! My husband and stepdaughter gobbled it right up. We used orange roughy the last time we made this because the mahi at our local fishmonger was not as fresh. The results were just as good as with mahi. We will make this again and again.

Way too much lime for us! If I were to make this again, I would just dribble a little lime over the fish just as I was preparing it go in the oven. The lime totally ovewhelmed the good mahi and crust, making it quite sour.

Been there. Done that. Didn't like it. Won't do it again.

This has become my favorite entertaining dish. I have used sea bass a few times - it tends to be sweet like the macadamia nuts, and compliments it very well. Served it with a simple mango salsa (B.A. sept. 1998) and jasmine rice. I make this as is - amount of lime is perfect for me.

I liked the lime flavor, unlike some other reviewers. However, I didn't care for the combination of madadamia nuts and fish. The panko was fantastic - superior to regular breadcrumbs - and I would remake this dish with the lime juice and panko, omitting the nuts.

I've made this recipe several times for extremely grateful guests. The mahimahi is wonderful, but I was most impressed when I used mako shark instead. The lime really cuts the gamey flavor of the fish, leaving a clean flavor. I like to increase the amount of cilantro.

i made this for my boyfriend and he raved about it, even the next day. I used honey to crispen the crust, and used a combination of nuts, including pignolas. Since then, i use whichever nut I have in the house and it's always good.

One of the best fish dishes I've ever made! The beautiful presentation belies how easy it was to make. I made one minor change - I broiled the fish for about 30 seconds to brown on top. This is certainly a dish I would make for company - low stress, impressive and delicious!

I was not able to find panko so I used seasoned breadcrumbs as a substitute. The seasoned breadcrumbs made the dish very salty. I would suggest unseasoned breadcrumbs if panko is not available. Saltiness aside, the crust had a wonderful texture as did the fish.

As others did I halved the lime juice and butter, the fish was just caught three hours prior to cooking. Great Dish

I have made this recipe several times using the halibut we caught in Alaska. Since we have plenty of halibut to go around (48 lbs. left), it is a great recipe paired with a nice citrus salsa for dinner parties. It is always a hit!

Rating: 4
Ohhh, so good! Beautiful presentation as well. Yes, there's plenty of lime flavor, but I liked it. For guests, I will reduce it. Do I reduce the lime juice or the marinade time? It could use some more flavors, so next time, I will increase the cilantro and add some other herbs and spices. Also, I halved the butter and still wouldn't have minded even less. I should have used the roasted/salted macadamias, not unsalted. Finally, the fish was not cooked through at 20 mins. I had to move it to the bottom of the oven and bake for 5 mins more.

I have to agree with the Sarasota reviewer - it was way to limey... it's all we could taste!! If it made it again, I'd definitely decrease the amount of lime juice, it overpowers the fish too much.

I took this recipe with me to Hawaii on a recent trip with some friends. I bought some great fresh Mahimahi and prepared this dish for 10 people. That was 4 weeks ago and I am still getting rave reviews! I marinated the fish longer than the recipe said (I started the marinade and we all went out for cocktails and pupu's), about 2 1/2 hours, and added garlic to the melted butter. A SUPERB RECIPE !

This sounded so yummy, but all I could taste was lime juice. Too bland.

This is easy and very good. I served it with a chicken stock, butter, shallot and cococut milk rice pilav and veggies. Everyting went into the oven -- Simple. A little fruit like Mango or a slice of Pinapple under the rice would have worked on too. Anything tropical. We're in Hawaii and we bought the mahi from a fisherman's truck on the side of the road -- this really helps. When it's that fresh it absorbs the lime like a sponge is light and moist and mouthwatering. I'll keep panko in my pantry from now on!

This was simple, elegant and delicious. I used lemon juice instead of lime and halibut instead of mahi-mahi. Baked 25 minutes at 375 because my fillets were very thick. No need to broil the top at this temperature as it came out nice and brown. It was better than I thought it would be considering that there is so little to it. I would make it again for company.

Wow, this recipe was great! Mise en place consists of ingredients that I normally have on hand. Mahi-mahi was on special at the market and oh so fresh. Prep was a matter of minutes. Cooking time was just long enough to make a mango, pineapple salsa. Presentation was very pleasing to the eye. Crust was incredible. Clean up was a breeze. Served on a bed of baby mixed asian greens with a side of the Jasmine rice timbales with sesame seeds. Will repeat menu for upcoming dinner guests.

I tried this recipe, only modified it a little bit by adding 1/4-cup shredded coconut to the breading, then topping the finished product with a blend of fresh mango, orange and avocado, plus lime juice and apricot jam (don't know the measurements, but just about any combo will do). My husband absolutely loved it!

Even people who don't care for fish usually like mahi mahi and this is a delicious way to prepare it. I left out the cilantro because I just don't like it, and I mixed a couple of tablespoons of honey into the topping before spreading it on.

This is a great and easy way to prepare fish. The macadamia nut crust is tasty and looks like you went to a lot of work to prepare. I used halibut steaks. It was wonderful. A definite keeper.

As good as this dish is with Mahi (one of my favorite fish) I think it comes out even better using a thick Halibut filet (adjust cooking time to thickness of fish)

Very good. I've tried this with a few different fish and mixed in some pecans with the macadamia nuts. Every time it comes out tasting great.
