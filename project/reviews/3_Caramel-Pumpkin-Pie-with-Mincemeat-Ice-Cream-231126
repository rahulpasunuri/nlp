I was looking up this recipe to make it again this year. I really love it and I think the key difference between "bland" and "wonderful" reviews has to do with cooking the carmelized sugar as dark as possible without burning. It can be tricky, but if you go too far it's only a little bit of sugar and water to start over!

Made a day ahead. Very yummy and a nice change from the pie I had relied on.

light, but bland.

I am not a Pumpkin pie lover and I could have finished this pie all by my self. It was a hit at Thanksgiving and I plan on making it again at Christmas!! Thanks!!

I agree with others in that you couldn't detect the caramel. Also, I found the pie to need more sugar and I tend to like desserts that are less sweet. All in all, it was very disappointing.

Not a fan of the pie, it was too much work for not enough flavor. The ice cream was FANTASTIC if you are a mincemeat fan.

I made this recipe twice. The first time I followed the directions exactly. It was ok...too much work for the results. I couldn't detect the caramel at all. The second time I used brown sugar instead of the caramel and poured the caramel over the top of the pie before serving it. Now that was good.

This was ok... nothing to be ashamed of... BUT, didn't taste like caramel... WAY too much work for the result.

I found this recipe fab-Oh! The carmel is subtle, and can be lost if too much whipped cream is applied. (I did not try the mincemeat ice cream.) Even the pumpkin pie perfectionist in my group requested the recipe. What I especially like about this pie is that it is not heavy. It is very light and smooth. It makes a nicer ending to a heavy holiday meal. I baked a test earlier in the week, and had the disappointing experience cited in an earlier post, in which the mixture hardened into a fist-sized blob as I added the cream to the sugar-water. This mixture took 2 glasses of wine and an entire Norah Jones CD to dissolve, so it wasn't exactly unpleasant, but not something I wanted to make Thanksgiving morning if this is what it required! So the 2nd time I made it, I added the cream *very* slowly, while whisking. No blob. Not even a carmel "bit" appeared. The crust is fantastic. This crust has turned out great three times for me, in just a week. Seems simple enough, and rather unextraordinary as a recipe... but, oh-joy, it is light, flaky, and SO worth the time.

I had high hopes for this but it really disapointed. After going thru all the work of making the caramel it didn't taste "caramelly" at all. Just tasted like bland pumpking pie probably could've done better (and less work) with the recipe on the back of the can of pumpkin.

I don't know what everyone tasted but it certainly wasn't this poor excuse for a pumpkin pie. My dogs Milk Bones have more flavor than it had. Come to think of it they were quite similar. I gave it one fork because there are no zero forks. What a BIG BIG Disappointment!

Now that we've eaten the pie I thought I'd come back and rate it again. I thought it tasted good but didn't really taste a caramel flavor. I think I'll try a different recipe next year.

Delicious! I also ran into the problem of the caramel hardening in the pan, but I reheat on low and it melted again with no problems. I found the caramel taste to be very subtle, but the texture was light and fluffy, and it was simply divine. My husband loved it and we both finished the pie this morning for breakfast. This will be the recipe I use from now on for pumpkin pie.

I cooked a double recipe in 2 frozen deep dish crusts. 6 Adults & 2 Children at 1 and 3/4 pies. My 11 year old nephew would have had a fourth piece if he'd been allowed! Well worth the trouble!!!

What a pie! It will be my favorite pumpkin pie from now on. I had enough time to spare, so I just left the hardened bits of caramel in the pan with the half & half & cream, and when I returned a while later,they had dissolved.

Oh WOW. Sorry to post again but just ate it and it was very good. Yum! Creamy and caramell-y.

I didn't rate as it's in the oven and I haven't tasted it yet. Glad someone else had the caramel problem--makes sense as so much cold cream hardens the caramel. I warmed it too and it dissolved just fine and smelled wonderful--maybe heating the cream beforehand would help avoid it? Otherwise all went well and it looks lovely in the oven so far!

I made this the day before Thanksgiving so we haven't eaten it yet!! When I added the half and half to the caramel mixture, the caramel completely hardened into one big glob!! Fortunately, I didn't panic and put it back over the heat to dissolve the caramel. I kept it over low heat as I added the heavy cream. It looks good coming out of the oven. Hope it tastes good tomorrow!!

Not your usual pumpkin pie! Did a "test run" of this pie for Thanksgiving and was pleasantly surprised. It smells wonderful in the oven, is pleasant on the tongue, and leaves a delightful aftertaste of caramel. This is quite possibly the best pumpkin pie I've ever made.
