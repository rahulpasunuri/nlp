I am not a big fan of arugula. I would make it again with spinach instead.

This is a rustic dish. Prosciutto and arugula are a favourite combination for many of us but you have to like them. If the flavours and textures are not familiar to you, then probably stick with eggs benedict. We liked it, would make it again but not for another couple of years. I also liked the ease of frying the eggs over poaching them. I sure think this is far too much food for 2 people. I halved everything but the prosciutto and we had plenty.

I thought the arugula and very thinly sliced prosciutto were a great combination with the egss!! The cheese sauce is good, but they don't go together that well. I would make a regular eggs benedict sauce. I loved the idea that you don't have to poach the eggs; and once the sauce is on top of them, you don't notice the difference. After all of that it was my husband's favorite! So I hope some of you try it and give us good feedback. I want this to be a great recipe and it just needs a little work.

The arugula did not work--it was bitter. Its also easy for the sauce to curdle if you are not careful.

The arugula gave it a wierd flavor, and the prosciutto doesn't cut very easily, so the whole slice would fall off. however, the cheese sauce was delightful, I would make it again with other dishes.
