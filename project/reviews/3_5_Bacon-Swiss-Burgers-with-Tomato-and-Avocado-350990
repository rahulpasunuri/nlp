"Come On Man",,It doesn't take a scientist to come up with a great burger recipe. It's hard to mess up a burger unless you can't cook. Thanks though the picture of the burger was attractive. A burger always hits the spot.

Good basic burger recipe. Next time I'll increase the burger seasonings by 1/2.

I had these for the first time when visiting relatives in the States and made them again here. This will definitely be my favourite burger recipe.

This is now my classic burger recipe. I prefer to add chopped onion, garlic and green pepper in the meat and with this recipe, I have a perfect, mouth-watering burger. Thanks for the recipe!

Made these last night. Family loved them! Added a little more hot sauce to meat, but other than that followed the recipe. Nice combination of flavors and textures.

While these were good, I found the previous reviews to be overrated. Though, I may be biased that any burger without blue cheese in the patties isn't worthwhile! :)

O. M. G. The burgers themselves are so good that you don't need all the extras to appreciate them. Also, Cotswold cheese is a good substitute.

This was a great burger! I substituted turkey bacon for the regular bacon, and grilled white onions for the raw red onion slices. Really delicious!
