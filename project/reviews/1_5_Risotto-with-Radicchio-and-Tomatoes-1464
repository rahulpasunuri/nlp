This was horrible!! : ( I made it for a dinner party with my friends. After one bite they looked at me in disgust and asked for the phone. They wanted to call the nearest papa ginos to order pizza! Thanks to your recipe my friends will never look at me again... DREADFUL!!!!!!!

Risotto is such a heart healthy way to eat - cream is unecesary.

couldn´t agree more with previous reviewer. This is not a risotto recipe.

This isn't a bad rice dish, but it's not a risotto. I may try it with similar ingredients and a true risotto technique and see what happens. The gradual introduction of hot liquid into rice which has been sauteed in oil/butter is essential to producing the peculiar character of a real risotto - "al dente" rice, with a creamy mantle of slowly cooked starch.
