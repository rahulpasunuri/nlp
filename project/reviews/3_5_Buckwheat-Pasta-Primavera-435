I have not done it, but I suggest trying this recipe as written. I took notes on other reviews and ad-libbed the veggies, using all fresh tomatoes and mushrooms, regular pasta, and wine in the sauce. I ended up with sauce that was thin with globs of melted parmesan and a lovely array of color, but not a very tasty meal. Time for triage: I put the whole mess (not the pasta) in the food processor and made a vegetable "bolognese", which I added to a pan of browned Italian sausage (could use veggie if you wanted to). To this pretty, rather healthy bolognese sauce I added an absurd amount of garlic powder (could use fresh if not in a rush), thyme, and fennel seed. The dish was finished with a very generous amount of crushed red pepper. Saved! Pretty delicious, too.

This recipe is good as a base, but this is a recipe just waiting to be experimented with. When I last made it I used: Vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. I also used brocolli in place of sugar snap peas, and substitued half and half for the cream. I used fresh roma tomatoes that I peeled and chopped. I added these near the end with the blanched vegies. Overall, base recipe 2.5 stars. If you improvise with the ingredients in your pantry you will get a much more enjoyable meal.

I used 100% soba noodles to make it gluten free and red bell pepper. I didn't like the taste at all.

I made this sauce for regular whole wheat pasta, and the whole family -- including the mac-and-cheese-aholic 3 year old -- gobbled it down. ONE IMPORTANT CHANGE: I think the 1/4 cup cream is a typo. I put in closer to 1 and 1/4 cups cream before it resembled primavera sauce and was enough to handle 12 oz. pasta.

even my 3 year old liked the noodles. i did not use all the parmesan cheese though. i only put in a couple tablespoons and let everyone add cheese to taste.

I used red onions and added asparagus and broccoli; I blanched everything in equal parts water and chardonnay. I also found I wanted a little more sauce than the recipe allows for so I used double amounts of cream and cooking liquid. While I loved the soba noodles, the rest of family said they would have preferred plain old pasta. Sobas have a strong flavor...

I made this for a dinner party. I was very nervous because there were so many different kinds of people coming and I wanted something everyone could eat. I added chicken at the end. It was a hit with everyone!! Every single person had seconds. I felt it was a little fattening with so much butter and then the cream at the end. I would make this again and again for my guests

I made this dish as part of a pasta buffet dinner that I hosted. It was one of three pasta dishes that I made, and it was the least favorite. I am unsure if I did something wrong or if it just was not a great hit. I think that the mushroom/sun-dried tomato broth taste was a little too strong for the dish. I don't think that I will make this dish again.

This was just excellent. The sun-dried tomatoes, combined with the dried mushrooms gives the dish a lot of depth of flavor. My husband and I couldn't stop eating it.

this dish was loved, and is very friendly to change. I used julienned zucchini, grean beans, fresh shitake and white mushrooms, 6 halves of sundried tomato and a red pepper. I did not use parm or scallions and the dish was suberb with every bite juicy and flavorful. I think the key is to soak the sun-dried toms in the broth for a good long while as they infuse it with flavor, and to make sure not to overcook the veggies while sauteing. You do not want them to turn to mush when you put the broth/cream in the pan. Buckwheat noodles were super and made me feel like I was being healthy!

I changed the recipe slightly, using fresh asparagus (boiled with the pasta), and dried linguine, rather than the fresh buckwheat. I didn't use the dried tomatoes, used fresh crimini mushrooms instead of shitakes. Could use 1/2 butter/1/2 olive oil for the saute. Delicious!!!
