I love this recipe. It is quick and delicious. I usually broil the eggplant until it's a little crispy to add some texture variety. I also serve it with a parsley sauce from a similar recipe (blend parsley, olive oil, 1 close of garlic, and balsalmic vinegar).

Wonderful! I made this with long slices (lengthwise) of chinese eggplant. Once I rolled them I stabbed a toothpick through to hold them in place and then set them on end. It was a beautiful presentation and fast to make too. I will definitely make this for a dinner party.

Made this as an appetizer, and probably won't do that again. I doubled the recipe and ended up with too few rolls to be worth the effort. However, the taste was delicious, and the rolls look great neatly arranged on their sides. Next time I would make it as a first course.

Made this when it first appeared in Gourmet, and subsequently. Not only is it a great first course, but if doubled is a delicious main course with bread, and salad.

Simple and very tasty. It took me no time to prepare this dish. I agree, the salting can be skipped. These make great little finger foods for guests!

This is a quick and easy appetizer, perfect for those who are watching carbs! I used sundried tomatoes instead of fresh. I also used the smaller japanese type eggplants -- no need to salt and wait 10 minutes, although they made very little rolls.

A wonderful and easy recipe. I also added green onions and it gave a nice burst of flavor!

This tastes much better than you'd think! I used feta because I detest goat cheese, and added a little grated locatelli romano. Also, I found that I had a little oil left after brushing the slices, so I sauteed the tomato and parsley for just a few minutes in this oil to soften the tomato. Then I mixed the feta and locatelli into the tomato-parsley mix and spread the whole mixture onto the slices instead of spreading the cheese first and sprinkling the tomato on like the recipe says to do. You can smash a garlic clove into the oil before you brush the eggplant with it for a subtle garlic flavor. It was wonderful!

We made this and Eggplant Gratin on the same night, and this one paled in comparison. The eggplant was difficult to handle coming off the broiler and as a result, spreading the goat cheese and making a nice presentation were a challenge.

This is a wonderful diversion from the normal eggplant recipes. It was just full of flavor. I like to serve this as a side dish to Gnocci.

This is awesome! If you are looking for a different side dish, this is it. A new way to use eggplant and an interesting side dish to serve. Also it was very easy to do, and I've made it several times now. It adds nice color as a side to salmon or beef,I've also doubled the recipe and used it as a main course. Try it, you'll like it!
