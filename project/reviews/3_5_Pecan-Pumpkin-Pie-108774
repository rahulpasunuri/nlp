I make this pie every year for Thanksgiving from the original recipe in Gourmet magazine's November 1985 issue-yes I still have it! My husband loves pecan pie and I think it's a nice compromise between the two kinds of pies. Neither overpowers the other-they complement each other nicely.

My husband and mother-in-law like neither pumpkin nor pecan pie, but this was a HUGE success. I made a few tiny changes: I substituted half a grated tonka bean for the cinnamon, and used 50% corn syrup and 50% maple syrup, but otherwise was faithful to the recipe as written. I will definitely make it again.

After making it the first time, I wanted a deeper pumpkin layer. I used about 1 1/4 cup pumpkin, 3 eggs, 3 T sour cream, increased the cinnamon and added a pinch of cloves. For the pecan layer, I toasted the pecans before adding. I took Sandi's suggestion and baked it at 450 for 15 minutes and then lowered it to 350 for about 25. Everyone agreed it was delicious.

After reading all the reviews I was a little scared of this recipe. I baked my own pie crust recipe and In making pumkin pies I had Pumkin mix left over so decided to look for a recipe to chance one up a little. I mixed up the pecan recipe in this recipe. layered it as it said.Baked it more like a pumkin pie. 15 minutes at 450 degrees and then lowered it to 350 degrees for 25 minutes. It looks great can not wait to try it. I used a cilicone ring I just got from my Granddaughters fund raiser and it worked great for the edges Still warm but I can not wait to have a piece. We are celebration Thanksgiving today in stead of yesterday,because of a work conflect

It wasn't terrible but I would not make it again. Pumpkin portion was to soft even after I let it set for 6 hours and chilled it. I would not describe it as either light or satisfying so I'm not sure what the point of making it again would me. Overall just mediocre.

I've made this several times, following the recipe exactly, and everyone just loves it. A nice, light alternative to traditional Thanksgiving pies that's become a holiday tradition for us.

SIMPLE and DELICIOUS!!! This pie was so simple to make that I was scared of the end result. I was also afraid that both fillings would mix. I followed teh recipe and it turned out perfect! When I cut into the pie, the pecan portion was like caramel and the pumpkin portion was amazing!! Everyone loved it. It wasn't too sweet, it was just perfect. I will be making this for thanksgiving AND Christmas. I use to always make a pecan pie and a pumpkin pie but now I can simply make this recipe because it's the best of both worlds.

For my review, I will simply quote one of my Thanksgiving guests: "I don't like pie, and I did not want dessert. Just to be polite, I took the first piece. The second piece was because this is SO GOOD!" I, too, do not understand the problems others had with this recipe. I didn't read the reviews before I made the pie, and I followed the instructions just as written. I had no problems, and I am definitely making this again. Better texture, more interesting flavor than plain pumpkin pie; no tooth-curling sweetness like most pecan pies.

I have not made this pie. I followed the link from the editor's picks on the Thanksgiving page and was shocked to find that a pie with so many negative user experiences would be chosen by the editors! I would like to thank the cook from Toronto, especially, for 1. making me laugh, 2. sparing his cat and the raccoons, and 3. helping me avoid a holiday nightmare!

By the way, the whipped cream was great!

Our pie turned out mushy like the pies of the many others that have gone before us. The crust was great, though, and so we poured out the filling, reserved some of the pecans, and put some whipped cream on it. Not exactly what the recipe author intended, but all the stores were closed and we wanted dessert. The cook from Toronto's lament is one of the best I have ever read. Bravo!

A real hit at our early celebration of Thanksgiving! I added an extra 1/8th tsp of both cinnamon and nutmeg. Used a pre-made pie crust in the interest of time. Used a soup ladle to gently put the pecan mixture on top - it did not penetrate the pumpkin layer. Agree with reviews that said you should NOT prick the crust, as some of the corn-syrup mixture leaked through and made a few pieces tough to extricate. Pumpkin layer was softer in the center than I would like, but not "soupy" or "runny." Pieces lifted out, but did spread when you cut a bite out with the side of your fork. I plan to try again with extra egg yolk as binder, putting solid-pack pumpkin on a paper towel in a strainer to firm it up, and roasting my own pumpkin.

I'm not sure if canned pumpkin is different in the USA than it is in Canada but after adding the additional pumpkin filling ingredients, the pumpkin part of the pie was quite soft. I'm used to pumpkin pie with some density. I think next time I'll use my own pumpkin from scratch.

Rating: 3
I know why there is some controvercy surrounding this recipe. The issue with this pie is that it really must set for a few hours before you eat it. When it comes out of the oven, it's quite soupy. Once it sets, though, it's very good. Not too sweet, nice texture. Give it a try when the stakes are low and see whether you want to try it again.

The recipe was great for my fiance who doesn't like "the ratio of crust to mushy pumpkin" in regular pumpkin pies. I don't agree with the other reviews, you definitely need to cook the crust for a bit first, as I didn't because of the reviews and it didn't crisp up at all. Also do add a bit more pumpkin and also more of the spices to add some extra flavor. A good way to get both flavors in one dish though.

i'm at about 5000 ft, so i baked the pie a bit longer than suggested (by about 7 min) and it came out well. i love pumpkin pie but decided to try this one for a change. i felt that the pumpkin proportion could have been a bit higher - the pie collapses when you bite into it anyway - but that may just be me since i prefer pumpkin pie over pecan. also next time i would toast the pecans beforehand, as the texture of the sub-par pecans i finally scrounged up (thanksgiving eve) would have been improved this way. also, i don't suggest using a deeper pie pan (i used a 9" emile henry ceramic pan, which was way too deep). a standard one should work just fine.

Rating: 3
I made this pie before reading the reviews. It is a hard recipe, I even made the crust recipe. I tasted a little of the flaked off crust and it is really good. I am worried about the pie itself, because it is jiggly. I went ahead and turned the oven down to about 350 as in some of the other reviews (after I took it out and read reviews it was so wobbly). I left it in for about 20 more minutes at 350. It's not AS wobbly, but I know it says to cool it and that will set. I had it sitting before I baked it again, but it never firmed up. So I would suggest cooking longer if anything. I will see how it tastes tomorrow!!! It looks absolutely divine, and it smells good too!!

If you're baking your own, this one is excellent. I made it a few years ago and it's a great twist on pumpkin pie. If you're buying a pumpkin pie there are some guidelines out there too. http://ilovepumpkins.com/2008/11/24/official-guide-to-pumpkin-pie-is-live/ and http://ilovepumpkins.com/pumpkin-pie/.

This recipe richly deserves every single 4-fork rating it has received. Im not crazy about Pumpkin Pie, nor about Pecan Pie, but this pie was fabulous succulent, light, flavorful, warm with spices and pecan, yet not cloying. The Whiskey Butter Sauce lent a sophisticated air, a definite step up even from freshly whipped cream. I did not follow the recipe exactly. I followed advice from earlier reviewers and doubling the amount of pumpkin. The bottle of what I thought was Karo syrup in the pantry turned out to be rice wine vinegar, so I used maple syrup instead with great success. Given the results I see no need to try the corn syrup when the maple was so splendid. This became an instant classic in my house, and I'll be making it again for the third year in a row.

Rating: 4
To the Seattle cook who was disappointed AFTER she reheated the pie the next day, commonsense should dictate that you NEVER reheat a pecan-based pie for the reasons you noted. You should not rebake anything containing corn syrup as you will "alter" the consistency of the pie. That's not the recipe's fault but yours! You can slice a piece of pie (that is, remove a slice from the pieplate) and heat gently in the microwave for a few seconds, but to basically rebake the pie in the oven a second time was a foolish thought!

Rating: 3
Very good.

I've been making this pie for years - since it was originally published. One huge difference that I note in comparing my "laminated" original version with this one is that in the original it DOES NOT call for baking the crust first AND calls for baking in the upper third of a preheated oven at 425 for 20 minutes, then reducing the heat to 350 for another 20-30 minutes. You may have to cover the crust for the last minutes of baking to prevent the crust from browning too much. I have never had a problem and this is the most requested Thanksgiving dessert in my family! Hope this helps with those who may consider trying again, or those who would have been swayed not to try it!

I tweaked this recipe as I had another one from the defunct Victoria magazine and I lost it. So I adjusted this one. For the crust, I did NOT prebake. I doubled the pumpkin and reduced the egg to 1 egg. I tripled the cinnamon and added cloves, allspice, and ginger. The pecan part -- I almost doubled the pecans. Also, baked it for almost an hour -- after puffed and golden, cover with foil until you get a slight wiggle in the middle. Everyone loved it.

I disagree with the reviewer who said this recipe was evil, but I do agree with them when they said that even after following the recipe to a "T" and it was a bunch of ooze. I prepared this recipe with the intention of reheating it the next day. It came out of the oven fine the first time, but after reheating it, per the recipe, it did come out like a pecan pumpkin soup with a crust. It wasn't disgusting but it definitely wasn't something I was proud of serving. I won't be making this recipe again.

By far the worst recipe I have ever followed... ...and I followed it to a freaking 'T'! It sounded delicious in the description, but what it amounted to in practice was a disgusting, inedible, unseparated bunch of ooze. If there were any culinary justice, you would be sued for submitting such an evil, evil recipe. You ruined my Thanksgiving, so thanks a lot. The only thing I give genuine thanks for regarding this dish is that I will never make it again. I ended up buying a store-made pie to make up for creating such a pile of stinking sickeningness. I don't know why so many people have recommended this recipe, but the only reasons I can guess are that a) these people have no taste buds or sense of consistency, b) they are your close personal friends and relatives, or c) this is all some sort of horrible prank. I wouldn't serve this pie to my cat, that is to say, if my cat had a love of pumpkins or pecans. This horribly disgusting pie did not end up on anyone's plate (no way I would ever serve it, not even to my worst enemy). Instead, it ended up triple-bagged inside my trash for the garbage men to pick up on Monday. I triple-bagged it because I didn't want raccoons to rip it open. But now that I think about it, I doubt raccoons would even eat this.

This was an amazing Pumpkin Pie. My family could not stop eating it... When I made the pie crust with the pumpkin filling, there was too little pumpkin to fill the crust. Next time I will cut the pie crust recipe in half and see how it works out.

I tried a different recipe for pumpkin pecan pie last year, and was not happy with the reults. But it still sounded good to me, so when I saw this recipe I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. This one will become a permanent menu addition. No, it doesn't replace the traditional pumpkin or pecan pie, but if you'd like to try something different, interesting and delicious, this one fills the bill. This is an excellent pie, the layers did not mix, and the filling did not leak through the crust. Just be careful when you spoon the pecan mixture on top of the pumpkin layer.

I'm in charge of the pies every year for Thanksgiving, and am quite good at them, but this one eluded me. I followed the directions to the letter, but the layers did not stay separate, and I would up with something of a sloppy mess topped off with some super tasty candied pecans. Luckily I'd used my own recipe for the crust, so the bottom did not get soggy.

I would totally make this again. I made it for my boyfriend as a "test pie" to see if it was worth making for Thanksgiving. We loved it. The only thing I might do differently is to cut out some of the corn syrup. I may use 2/3 the corn syrup and replace the rest with honey.

I find straight pecan pie too sweet and pumpkin pie ho-hum. This recipe was wonderful. My guests commented on the delightful slight lemon essence in this recipe.

My mother made this recipe when it first appeared in 1985. Our family was never a fan of pumpkin pie, but we were prepared to try it. It was fabulous! We have made this pie over and over again. As the years have gone by, we have each added our own twist to this version. I brush my pie crust before baking with apricot jam or marmalade. This past Thanksgiving I tried Ginger Marmalade on the crust...wow! The pecan topping also gets a generous shot of Orange Brandy. This is the one pie "my" family now asks for regularly...not just at Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I'd have to agree with other reviewers...I'd rather have my pumpkin and my peacan pie separately. This pie is good, not great. If you do make this pie, I found that when I spooned the peacan mixture on top, there was a lot of extra liquid. I dumped about 1/3 cup because others had said the corn syrup seeped through...

This pie was very popular at Thanksgiving. The spice combination adds interest, and the pecan layer is not too sticky sweet, like most pecan pies. I followed the advice of another reviewer and used dark brown sugar and light corn syrup in the pecan mix, since I usually find molasses too overwhelming. This recipe is very, very good.

Perfect combination--the mellow pumpkin custard really tones down the sweetness of the pecan pie. Everyone loved it on my Thanksgiving table.

Rating: 3
This was a good pie, and it was fun trying something new. Nonetheless, I think my personal preference is to stick with separate pies and not mix them. Perhaps this is because the corn syrup layer sank to the bottom, leaving the pecans and the pumpkin on the top. So it wasn't like 2 separate pies, one atop the other, but rather pumpkin-pecan pie with a layer of sugar on the bottom. Again, not bad, but I'd rather just have one or the other.

Delish! one thing that worked well was that I made the pumpkin filling, put it in the crust and then put that in the fridge while I made the pecan filling. It was a little firmer then when it was time to spoon on the pecan filling...maybe helpful...

Talk about the best of two worlds! What could be better than pumpkin pie and pecan pie together at once? Even better, you don't end up missing the flavors of one or the other. This will definitely be on my Thanksgiving table this year, and I'll bet it's going to be moving in as an annual tradition. BTW, I pricked my crust for the test pie, but I won't be doing that next time due to quite a bit of leakage...it's still yummy though!

I introduced this to my family (one in which any alteration of the Thanksgiving menu is close to heresy) several years ago when it appeared in Gourmet and since then they have eaten every slice at Thanksgiving before the meal is over.

yum, yum. i followed the other reviewer's instructions not to prick the crust, and that was fine. do make sure the pie has time to cool; the pecan topping on mine could have stood to set some more. and finally, i accidentally used a full stick of butter in the crust, instead of 3/4, and it was the best crust i'd ever made.

Contrary to what the recipe says, when you are going to bake a pie with the filling in it (as opposed to baking the shell completely and then filling with chocolate cream or something), you should not prick the crust because the filling will leak through the holes. Make sure you line the shell with foil and some kind of weights (I use dried beans over and over again) when you prebake it, but don't prick it with a fork for something like pumpkin or pecan pie.

Rating: 0
You might want to try sprinkling ginger snap crumbs over the baked crust (0r any crumb you prefer) before filling with the pumpkin mixture. This shouldn't affect the taste whatsoever but will help prevent leaking.

Well - I followed the directions exactly and unfortunately the corn syrup pecan mixture ran through the bottom of the crust (through the fork holes) even though the pumpkin mixture was underneath it so it turned out hideous looking - the taste however was okay. Any suggestions for how to prevent this???
