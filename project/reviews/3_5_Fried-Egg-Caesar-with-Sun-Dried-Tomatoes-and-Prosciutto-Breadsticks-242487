I have made this a few times and people are always super impressed with the homemade caesar dressing. I use the fish sauce, and it is extremely easy to make and hands down, my favorite dressing. I haven't used the sun dried tomatoes, but the fried egg on top is a perfect match! I would suggest using this recipe as a guideline for all caesar salads.

Very good. Great weeknight meal. Dressing is tasty but not overpowering.
