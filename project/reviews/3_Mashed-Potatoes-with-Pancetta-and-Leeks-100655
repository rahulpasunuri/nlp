Really disappointed with this reciped. Ingredients sounded so good. I found there to be too many leeks (and I like leeks) and the flavor to somehow be bland depite all of the ingredients. After all that effort would have much preferred to simply roast some potatoes in olive oil with salt and pepper.

1 fork = okay and that's about it. Way too many leeks for my likeing and it changed the potato color to a slight green tint. If I were to make this again I would use half the leeks. I subbed peas for the zucchini.

What a nice change to the usual plain mashed potatoes. I was expecting the texture to be smooth, but the chunky style and color from the other ingredients made a nice presentation. The flavor was wonderful!

Interesting. The addition of the crisp tender veggies was nice. The combo of carrots, potatoes and olive oil tasted a little sweet to me - I might consider using a more traditional mashed potato like a Russet with butter/milk rather than Yukons with olive oil next time. Rich and yummy though!

did the cook below seriously use the term 'EVOO'? yeesh.

Very dry and somewhat bland considering the robust falavor of the ingredients - I found extra salt brought out the flavor, but additions of EVOO and milk could not bring the desired consistency.

I made these for a Valentine dinner for my husband last night. We thought they were wonderful! I did add a little cream and milk to soften the consistency. I used the pancetta but I think regular bacon would not change the flavor much.

I've made this a couple of times, with and without the veggies. Either way it's terrific and hearty. The pancetta and leeks make the potatoes rich.

I have made this dish for my Valentine's dinner parties for the past two years. It's a colorful and flavorful dish. Perfect with a rib roast on a winter night. It rewarms well, so it can be made in advance.

While making this dish, I was a bit skeptical. But it turned out brilliantly. A perfect mixture of flavors and a nice colorful presentation. Even better days after reheated on the stove with a little butter and cream for moisture.

These potatoes were nothing special. It just tasted like I put a bunch of leftovers into mashed potatoes. Based on the other reviews, I was ready for something spectacular.

This became an instant family favorite! One family member went back for a third helping!

My husband had never liked anything in his mashed potatoes until he tried these. WOW did he ever like these.

I doubled this for a small dinner party. It was terrific! It's great for entertaining because it "holds" well if your guests linger over the appetizers.
