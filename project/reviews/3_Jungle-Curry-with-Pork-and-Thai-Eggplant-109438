I made this recipe last night and it was fantastic! I used Mae Ploy curry paste, 1/4 cup (I like it really spicy and flavorful), regular eggplant, and chicken stock with some ginger added. It took about an hour. Many people said their eggplant got too mushy, but mine did not. I added it a little later because I was worried about that happening. The liquid was the perfect amount as I like it over rice. I didn't find it to be soupy at all. A little sauce is good over rice anyways. The only thing I would have done differently was add the galangal a little earlier so it would cook more. Maybe I'll take the time to make the curry paste from scratch next time. Yum! A definite addition to my regular rotation. I have a pretty bad gluten intolerance so eating at thai restaurants means interrogating the poor server about the ingredients and not always getting correct information and having a reaction that lasts for days. Making something this good at home helps out a lot! Thanks for the recipe.

The author of this recipe is actually incorrect about coconut milk not being used in Northern Thai cuisine. The daughter of someone who grew up in Northern Thailand, I know for a fact that coconut milk is used in many authentic Northern Thai dishes (and coconuts do grow in that region as well, not just in the south). This curry tastes much better when made with coconut milk. Additionally, the recipe calls for far more curry paste than is necessary, if you buy the curry paste pre-made from a store. Also, I think it tastes better with Thai chilies (or bird's eye chilies) than jalapenos, but those are often harder to find, unfortunately. And to refute what another reviewer stated, small Thai eggplants (often called aubergines, I believe) are used in authentic Thai dishes. When cooked correctly, they add a unique and delicious flavor to this curry.

I had chinese eggplant and precooked it as indicated. I felt the curry paste was excessive and only used 2 TB, as well as the liquid: only one cup was all that I needed. Finally, I dredged the meat in a bit of rice flour, which made the sauce thicker. A winning combination of flavors!

I made this with Thai eggplant (the round, green and white golf-ball size), and used 1 T prepared curry paste and prepared chicken broth. It was done in the time it took me to cook the rice to accompany. Fast, easy and tasty, but you have to love eggplant!

We loved this version of jungle curry. The Thai eggplants are hard to find but worth the effort

I used Lebanese Egplants which turned out fine. I would recomend a little less Stock - say 1/2 cup as the vegies loose moisture but overall very tasty.

This is no way a gourmet delight, just a hodge-podge of anything found around. I've seen this made with frog, even snake. Eggplant should never, ever be allowed in any form close to a stew - which is what this is. Discretion is a far better ingredient.

I used store bought red curry paste - which simplified the recipe considerably. Very good - although I substituted regular eggplant as well and it turned to mush.

This curry was just OK. I happened to have all the exotic ingredients on hand, except the Thai eggplants, so I used a big one baked as directed. It turned to mush. I also cut the pork pieces too big. Next time I'll use the smaller eggplant and add more peppers/curry sauce. This was good served with coconut rice. My kids like the name!
