I used gruyere which went nicely with the hazelnut crust and I also added an extra egg yolk to the souffle base. I made them the night before, reheated them and served on a bed of greens with sherry vinaigrette and they were delish. The guests raved.

Have made these souffles many times. The recipe scales up well and other cheeses -- from parmesan to gorgonzola -- also work well. Instead of the baby greens, I've also served them with creamy corn and Smithfield ham (not bad for Thanksgiving) or sliced green apple and golden raisins. Gorgonzola version with figs, etc. Versatile, I guess I'm saying. . .

I love this recipe. I've prepared it twice as first course for dinner parties for "tough" crowds. It is elegant and extremely impressive - and the best part is it can be made ahead. I toss the greens with a light lemon vinaigrette and arrange the souffles overlapping the bed of green slightly. Garnish with lemon slices.

This is really a VERY light souffle. In comparing it with other souffle recipes, I notice that the ratio of egg whites to yolks is much higher than most. It's too airy for me.

The souffles were wonderful once served. However, in preparation the 1/3 cup whole milk called for was clearly not enough. We wondered whether or not this was a mistake as we added an additional cup of milk in order to make the roux plus the milk liquid enough to fold the egg whites into. Also, they stuck to the bottom of the souffle dishes, as well as to the cookie sheet. Should the cookie sheet be lightly greased? The texture and taste were wonderful.
