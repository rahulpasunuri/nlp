Wow. Don't trim the fat and get the grill as hot as you can. It doesn't even need the sauce. I liked it better with the dressing from the Roasted Brussels Sprouts (part of menu).

These are absolutely DELISH! My guests devoured them, and they don't even need the sauce, they're so good (in fact, they barely touched the sauce, which I had fortunately bought from Trader Joe's, at other reviewer's suggestion). I'm sure marinating them over night intensified the flavor, so don't skip that important step. I used dark brown sugar, and since I had sake on hand, opted for that. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I'll definitely be serving these again!

Terrific, especially the sauce. I marinated the chicken for 24 hours, and used the food processor for the shallots -- no more tears!

This was very good. I used a little curry paste and coconut milk in it but turned out wonderful

This is my go-to appetizer recipe. I can throw it all together in a zip-lock the night before, and have it threaded on the skewer and "grilling" on my stove with very little effort. I also buy TJ's peanut sauce to keep this recipe easy.

I'm only weighing in because I think it is important to know substitutions work. Made this for a party of 60 (recipe x4 for 8lbs of chicken). Forgot shallots so I used about 3/4 to 1 cup of red onions. Thought I had fish sauce on hand but no; used oyster sauce - go figure (about 1 tbsp) and low sodium soy sauce (also about 1 tbsp). I had sake on hand (I think it makes a difference - I don't drink chinese rice wine so it seems only logical to me). Hit it with a little hoisen I had in the fridge; marinated for only about 4 hours and it was VERY flavorful. I cannot imagine why others had no flavor. Hint: stick your finger in your marinade and taste it. Oily maybe but you'll taste what's going on. I didn't make the peanut sauce (thank you Trader Joes) but will definately try it next time.

Very good. I think it is important that you actually marinate the chicken for the time recommended (for those of you who said it had no flavor.) We also had leftover red curry dipping sauce which we were spreading on bread for days later. At one point, I mixed the sauce with some noodles and shrimp to make a Thai noodle bowl which also tasted great.

Exceptional! A real keeper. I made it with Red-Curry Peanut Dipping Sauce. My picker eater husband even told me it was great without me asking for his review!

Excellent dish - I made this as one of the dishes for a party I catered for 150 people. The flavor of the marinade was awesome. It was a huge hit and they went fast. However I used a different peanut dipping sauce. Tip for those burning skewers - don't light the second burner on the grill - fill the skewers only halfway or less making sure the end is covered, then lay them so the exposed portion of the skewer in not over flames - then you have the simplicity (and fun) of the wooden sticks with no problems.

I made these with tofu instead of chicken and they were delicious. Great appetizer.

Wow, were these awful. I've made sates from this site before and I hope to find the recipe I used in the past. The fish sauce here was SO overwhelming, it smelled like the chicken had gone bad. Easily the worst recipe I've ever made from Epicurious.

my husband and I love Thai food and have had a lot of it. I made these sates for a party (w/ a different peanut sauce) and they were absolutely FABULOUS. The addition of fish sauce and sake makes a world of difference in the recipe and they explode with flavor. The guests are still raving weeks later! I can't wait to make them again.

Served this for Sunday football, what a hit! Wonderful flavors, kids loved it! Glad I double the recipe, cuz it went fast!! Only thing I didn't like was having to skewer the chicken, kept sticking myself!!

Excellent! Have served this twice, both times at patio parties. Guests loved them and asked for recipe. Spice is just right(removed the seeds).

The chicken and sauce were really good, just spicy enough. But my wooden skewers burst into flame on the grill, even after soaking in water for well over an hour. Next time I'll use metal.

Terrific. Flavorful, easy & juicy. Funny how sates are sophisticated skewers and kid -friendly finger food simultaneously. The thighs don't dry out and are really delicious. The sauce is HOT. Watch your curry and pepper amounts. We halved the serrano and it still had to be cut w/ coconut milk to tame the fire.

Fabulous! Excellent chicken. My three and six year old ate several of these with a side of grilled pinapple and jasmine rice. You can get the Thai red curry paste at Nob Hill Foods if you live in Northern Ca.

We loved this recipe! Marinated the chicken for 24 hours and the taste was great. We grilled on metal skewers over high heat on the Weber gas grill. Used this recipe as a main entree and served it with a spicy peanut sauce.

This was very good! I felt that the marinade did not flavor the chicken very much. I am not sure if I would marinade them again. I was surprised because the marinade has great ingredients. The dipping sauce is awesome!

We made most of this menu over Memorial Day. The sates were spectacular. We'll make them again and again. The sauce was incredibly hot, but we all loved it (left the seeds in, etc.)

Chicken thighs instead of breast meat! Thank you! Finally someone realizes dark meat for flavor. Marinade recipe makes a lot. I will increase the amount of thighs in the next go around.
