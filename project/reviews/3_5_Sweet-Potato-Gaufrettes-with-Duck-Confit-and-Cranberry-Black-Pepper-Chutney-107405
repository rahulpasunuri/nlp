The flavor combination of the confit, the sweet potatoes and the cranberry chutney was excellent. Like another reviewer, I took the easy way out and used sweet potato chips. That made it a quick, easy recipe...

I simplified the recipe by using purchased sweet potato chips in lieu of making the gaufrettes. These were the clear favorite of several hors d'oeuvres I served at our Mother's Day celebration. The potato chips I found were unsalted and the confit wasn't terribly salty, so I salted it slightly while heating it. If you're using purchased chips, buy more than one bag as about 1/2 the chips are curled and unsuitable for holding a topping. The chutney is fantastic - try the leftovers with game meats or roast turkey.

These are OK, but not worth the effort.

I think the cranberry contrasted nicely with the duck confit. The sweet-potato crisps were difficult to cut with our mandoline but they were pretty.

Made this for a NYE dinner people loved it. If the sweet potato is cut too thick it will soak up the grease and you won't get the crisp chip you are looking for. The chutney was great, and all tastes blended together really well.

I used a food processor slicer to make the potato gaurettes and fried until crisp. Tartness of cranberry was a great contrast to the sweet potato and duck. Would make these again.

I made this appetizer for a cocktail party. I made the sweet potato gauufrettes the night before as the recipe suggests can be done. The chips were soggy by the next day- I reheated them in the oven just prior to serving the dish, and after about 20 minutes, the chips were soft again. I also thought that the flavor of the Cranberry compote was too overpowering for the flavor of the duck. This recipe was not worth the effort.
