For a first-time hollandise sauce the recipe works. It is a bit too buttery and thick. You can add the butter in tabs and it works well. Definetely we'll try it with less butter and moré cream

Good taste and far less fussy and more healthy than the more buttery version.

It should only have 14oz of butter instead of the full 16 according to my class lab manual. Otherwise, it's good.

Perfect. Hollandaise are on of the most difficult things to make on the planet& these directions work very well.

This is a perfect basic Hollandaise. instead of using less butter I added another egg yolk and the balance seem to be great. cooks! be careful about over cooking this or you'll get a very thick sauce. lots of stirring lots of low heat lots of time :)

This was great. Based on the reviews I used less butter, about 2/3 of a cup. Also, I added the butter in pats and just let it melt into the egg mixture (low heat). Thanks for the tips!

First time trying a hollandaise sauce on my own, it came out well but a bit buttery and thin, probably just a personal taste thing but next time I try it I think I'll use 1/2 - 2/3 the butter recommended here. Overall success though.

I decided to make myself a a quick breakfast/lunch today and I chose to make Egg Benedict and for that you need Hollandaise. The sauce was delicious, but it had a lot of butter. I will make this again, but I might tweek things a bit. Thanks!

Add some capers and half a teaspoon of the spice called 'Aromat'. Aromat is found in England, Canada, Australia and South Africa. Aromat Ingredients Vegetable Oil - Spice Extracts with Celery - Mushroom Extract - Herbs - Garlic Powder - Onion Powder - Yeast Extract - Salt - Flavour Enhancer - Lactose (from milk) - Wheat Starch - It is also suitable for vegetarians. BTW: Aromat contains some msg. When I make eggs benedict, I use smoked salmon as I do not eat pork. It is delicious. Instead of white muffins, I use wholewheat muffins or toasted slices of whole wheat bread.

great basic hollandaise - just like the name says. be careful not to cook the yolk/cream too long or you'll get a very thick sauce. I did have to add a bit of lemon juice to go with the vinegar - about a teaspoon but it still tasted very buttery. delicious tho.

I thought this was easy, and very nice, rich Hollandaise, but it was a bit bland and buttery tasting. I bumped up the cream a bit and added cracked black pepper - gave it more depth.

Hands down the best, just as written -- don't change a thing. Exceptionally good over steamed asparagus or on Eggs Benedict. I've never seen brunch disappear so quickly.

Bazaar. I've never seen a hollandaise without tarragon. Looked this up because I wasn't sure of all the ingredients. I made a low-fat, low-cholesterol version though and it turned out great! I did add the 1/4 tsp. tarragon. Used Egg Beaters, low fat milk and Smart Choice margarine. Tasted just like the full fat version!

What a great recipe this is the first time i have ever tryed to make this type of sauce and i love it i did changeit a little bit insteed of cream I used Carnation light & creamy evaporated milk this not only works well but is 98% fat free i also used margarine and I added it straight form the container this made sure that the eggs would not curdle.

Wonderful! If you cut the butter into pats and add a couple at a time, it is much easier to manage than melting it. I didn't have a problem with the consistency. It came out perfectly! I did take advice of other reviews and did not add any salt at all, but used salted butter.

this recipe's tip about how to recover if the butter curdles worked perfectly. i did exactly as the recipe said, starting over w/ another yolk and it turned out great. only thing, i think it is a little salty, might use half the salt it calls for next time.

On my 3rd attempt, I finally got this recipe right and it turned out delicious. To make sure the butter mixed in well rather than melt the butter beforehand I cut it into pieces and added it 2 pieces at a time into the mixture until it was all melted in. That worked great and was much easier than the recipe directions. Like others here I also recommend using unsalted butter and adding salt to taste otherwise it is quite salty. I'd definitely do this recipe again since I love eggs benedict and will be happy that I will be able to do it right the first time next time :)

This is a good recipe. However, if you have found it to be too salty, then you should either not add any salt as per the recipe, or you should use unsalted butter, and then add salt to taste. I find that the hollandaise, and more particularly a bearnaise, benefits from a bit of saltyness. It cuts the fattiness of the sauce, and in the case of bearnaise, balances the sour from the vinegar.

Good recipe. Zeiker- you didn't do it right if it resembles melted butter. You have to let the eggs cook a bit more. The mixture starts off like melter butter, but then should resemble thick cream. It's not a matter of evaporation, but of the yolks thickening. If they don't, you're temperature is too low. But be careful. Too high a heat, and you'll have scrambled eggs. Hollandaise is NOT difficult, once you get the hang of it.

This is a classic hollandaise recipe. The trick was to heat it VERY SLOWLY.

I found it rather difficult to make. It did not come out anywhere near what I expected it to. My husband really did not enjoy it.

Like others have mentioned, too salty (and I like salt). Also, the recipe left out a crucial item of information - that the sauce must cool to show any semblance to a creamy sauce. Per the recipe, you are left with nothing more than something resembling melted butter. Only after it cooled on the plate, and after a good percentage of the oily butter separated and ran off, did it look anything like a hollandaise sauce. In the future I will most likely modify to include half the butter and chill before serving.

I found it to be very salty. And a lot of trouble to make.

This was a good homemade hollandaise sauce. I didn't go the fancy route in my cooking routine - I simply prepared it on a medium-low heat in an ordinary saucepan. I whisked my ingredients until warm then added the butter. I personally like a lot more lemon juice than called for. The texture was creamy and the taste was light.
