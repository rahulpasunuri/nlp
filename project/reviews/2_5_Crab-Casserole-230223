I love fresh herbs, especially cilantro. I also love fennel. Seems like this recipe tried to combine too many flavours without adding any real zest. I did, however, like the heartiness and stick to your ribs aspect of the casserole. Try it with extra hot mango pickle!

This was OK-not great. The vegetables seemed to clash with the crab rather then compliment it.

Very tasty, and easy to make. Although their are a large number of ingredients, the flavors meld very well. The finished product sets up well, like a strata with crispy sheets of phyllo. We'll definitely be making this again.
