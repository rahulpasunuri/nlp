Tasty and very low calorie. For quick weight wise lunches, I froze leftover soup in pint containers to take for week day lunches.

Fantastic every time. This soup has been my "go-to" comfort food since Thanksgiving 1999! 10 years is a tried and true success story. I like to make extra chipotle sauce and freeze it in ice cube trays to skip the work for future batches. It works like a charm. I also go with mostly leek, and just half an onion, but will occasionally throw in some shallot to change it up. Have tried this with both homemade chicken stock and vegetable stock - the chicken stock provides far better flavor, but some people preferred an entirely vegetarian dish.

This soup is fantastic! The combo of soup with chipotle sauce is superb. I followed the recipe exactly. Will make this over and over again.

Unsalvageable; sad loss of a great butternut squash. Don't bother with this recipe. There's a GREAT squash soup recipe on epicurious called Winter Squash Soup with Gruyere Croutons (http://www.epicurio us.com/recipes/food/ views/WINTER-SQUASH- SOUP-WITH-GRUYERE- CROUTONS-2997). Try that one instead.

This recipe was fabulous, and not nearly as time-consuming as it sounds. I was only cooking for two, with whatever ingredients were available in my pantry, so I used two hefty sweet potatoes and about two cups of butternut squash, along with full amounts of the rest of the ingredients.. It was wonderful! I would even recommend it with or without the chipotle sauce. Consider adding candied pecans for Thanksgiving dinner.. Also, since I didn't have any chiles in my pantry, I reduced the amount of water in the sauce and instead used powdered chipotle mixed with ancho chile powder. It ended up stinkin' spicy, but still delicious in the soup.

I chose this recipe because it included a lot of ingredients that I had left over in my pantry -- sweet potatoes, butternut squash, turnips. I also added rutabagas to the vegetable broth. This soup is a lot of work! And less flavorful than I had hoped. While the vegetable broth was cooking, the whole house smelled wonderful. Same with the soup -- it was very aromatic. I confess I did not use the Chipotle Sauce recipe in the magazine, but followed what Chapel Hill, NC suggested. That produced something thicker than a sauce. I went ahead and added the entire thing to the soup which made it VERY spicy and delicious.

I'd make this again, but would try to tinker with it somehow to perfect it. When the soup was in the bowl, before adding the chipotle sauce (which I made the short way with the canned stuff, like it seems most did), I added sweet dark dark miso as well as the honey and lemon juice. Then some thick yogurt. That worked for me.

I made this for a group of very NON-Adventurous eaters....It was a HUGE Success! Everyone loved it! The flavors were extraordinary. try this on a cold fall evening in front of the fire with warm crusty bread.MMMmmmmm....

The soup alone was dull dull dull. I loved the chipotle sauce I made, although it was somewhat different from the recipe. I sauted a small onion with a couple of cloves of garlic, then zapped that in the cuisinart with some cumin seeds and about 3-4 canned chipotles. That was awesome, and helped the soup a LOT. But the soup alone? eh.

We dug this soup. The hot sauce was more 'smoky' than hot and it went well with the flavors in the soup.

The soup was great. I had a hard time finding dried chipotle peppers and dried ancho chiles so modified the chipotle sauce recipe using canned chipotle pepers alone. It was still great.

I have to admit that this soup was one of the highlights of our Thanksgiving meal. To save time on the chipotle sauce, just puree some canned chipotles with adobo in a cuisinart, add 2 cloves roasted garlic, 1/3 cup sauteed onions, and enough broth to obtain a sauce-like consistency. The combination of flavors of smokey-hot chipotle sauce with the rich, sweet taste of squash and sweet potatoes was fabulous. I would not serve the soup without the sauce, unless you have guests who have no tolerance for heat.

This was fantastic! Made just as written (including honey). Couldn't find the dried peppers for the chipotle sauce so I pureed some chipotle salsa instead - worked great and added a nice zing. Also mixed equal parts sour cream and milk to drizzle with the salsa. Beautiful to serve to dinner guests.

What a delicious fall soup and the chipolte sauce adds such rich, wonderful flavor. My guests were asking for seconds (even those who said they didn't normally care for butternut squash or sweet potatoes)It's a little involved to make, but well worth it.

Delicious. I tried it several ways. I added 2T white wine to each portion before serving and substituted lime for lemon juice. The chipotle sauce gives it an entirely different flavor. It is good both ways and nice with Chipotle if you like hot and smokey.

I loved this soup!It has a nice, creamy consistency without adding any dairy. Didn't have lemon juice, so I substituted apple cider vinegar. Gave it a nice zing! The chipotle sauce really rounds out the flavor!

Huge hit at a Thanksgiving dinner. Even the sweet potato haters enjoyed it.

Great recipe, no added fat, butter or cream, yet it has that wonderful creamy texture. I would most likely add more chipotle sauce and salt next time to give it that extra zing that I prefer.

The soup was very creamy and tasty. There was no need for added fats (cream or butter). The chipotle is crucial. I just pureed chipotles canned in adobo sauce and it was an excellent combination.

I made this for supperclub along with a light cobb salad using sugar snap peas. It was delicious and everyone raved. Had enough for a light meal the next evening too.

This was delicious! I like the squash soup with cream base and butter better--but this was different and very good! Some liked it with the sauce (delicious) and some without. My husband loved it--my guests like the creamed base better.

I have made this recipe numerous times (without the Chipotle sauce, though). It is a huge hit. The flavors are subtle and the dish is elegant. I will continue to make this as my staple for special dinners.

I made this recipe with purchased broth, kabocha squash, and yams. The flavor was good but the main problem is that I didn't make the sauce which would have balanced out the sweetness of the soup. Even if I do make it with the sauce next time I think I will cut back on the honey or omit it. Also, I will try making the broth from scratch.

My sister served this soup at a dinner party and it was absolutely delicious! I have never been a huge squash fan, but I could not get enough of this soup. The sauce is well worth the effort and really adds zest. A great way to enjoy an autumnal evening.
