I made this cake for xmas 2001 and it was delicious. I was looking for this recipe, cause I want to make it again. I guess the quality of the almond paste you use is important in the final result and the strenght of the almond taste. And if you're not sure of the intensity of the taste, I suggest you add a bit of natural almong extract. This recipe reminds me of a traditionnal swedish xmas cake that is eaten with whipped cream and lingonberry preserve. Only, in Sweden, it is presented in small two bites individual cakes

This cake is excellent -- not sure what the problem has been for other reviewers. It has a subtle but very satisfying almond flavor, though it is a mild cake. I've also made it with almond-pistachio paste (42% almond, 8% pistachio, 50% sugar) and it's quite nice -- adds a little bit of depth and a slight bit of earthiness that rounds out the flavor. I've also found that instead of the kirsch cream and lingonberry preserves, I prefer it with whipped cream made with the syrup from Amarena Fabbri cherries (which turns the cream a lovely pink) and a few of the cherries with syrup drizzled over the top.

Not much almond flavour, just a yellow cake with Kirsch cream and Lingonberry. Try it with Almond extract or Amaretto. Oh and by the way, it has 8 EGGS and 2 STICKS OF BUTTER, EWWW, ICK, CHOLESTEROLT!

I haven't made this cake but I was wondering if anyone has compared it with the Almond Cake with Kirsch. The other (which I have made) uses the same amount of almond paste for a cake half the size. It almost like a coffee cake it's so dense and I see this one compared to a pound cake so I was just wondering. I guess I'm asking how much almond flavor does this cake have?

This has become my most favorite cake of all time!

This cake is very dense but moist. Think pound cake. I live in a small town and didn't have luck finding lingonberry or Kirsch. I substituted blackberry brandy and used a combo of blackberry and raspberry preserves and garnished it by drizzling the warmed preserves over the bundt cake, filling the center with cream and piling fresh raspberries on that. dusted the whole thing with a bit of powdered sugar and got raves. In fact- my visit now is to print up the recipe for the ladies at work. For the other review- if you prefer lighter cakes, look for one where the egg whites are whipped and lightly folded into the batter. When a recipe calls for many eggs and lots of butter the result will be quite dense.

I was very disappointed in following this recipe. It did not raise and it was heavy. The butter caused it to fail. Did it need more flower. I cannot tell you how disappointed I was. Did anyone else have any luck?
