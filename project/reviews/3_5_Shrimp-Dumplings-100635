I liked these, but really thought they needed the dipping sauce in order to be interesting. Until they were dipped, they were pretty bland. But I think this is a recipe that could be altered easily to make the dumplings really good. The recipe made 20 dumplings for me (maybe my wrappers were small). Also, I made them on a weeknight, since it was a quick recipe. While the process was simple, it was a bit tedious for a weeknight when I want things to come together a bit more easily!

I thought this was good - not great. My husband thought they were just OK. Very easy to prepare.

Added some pork sausage, rice vinegar & toasted sesame oil and used the round dumpling wrappers. Steamed the dumplings in a basket after frying. Probably the easiest filling recipe I've tried yet and very tasty! Didn't make dip, thinned some hoisin sauce with soya sauce. I like sweet dipping sauce.

Gosh, what a delicious recipe! I had a party with 10 -12 appetizers, and this went the fastest. Ran out of fresh ginger, so I left it out, yet they tasted great all the same.

This is a great recipie. Everyone raved about it. I've made it about 6 times and they always turn out perfect. To add a little zip I used low sodium chicken stock instead of water..Yummm!

The first time I made these they were awsome and I have been making them at least once a month and lately every two weeks or so. They are so much fun. I use them as an appetizer to put on the table while I'm getting everything else ready for my week-end dinner guests. Even my 18 month old daughter loves them. I made a batch and she ate at least 10 of them.

This was a wonderful dish! Very tasty, and not overly fishy. I made them to take a friends house. By the time I arrived they were soggy. That is my only complaint. Even re-heated the next day and soggy they were still yummy!

I will be making these weekly. They are absolutely delicious and low in calories too. Everyone loved them. I did not use the dipping sauce and instead I used a sweet chili sauce.

FANTASTIC! These were SO good, I could barely believe that they came out of MY kitchen! To the filling, I added a 1/2 C of fresh cilantro leaves, chopped & I used scallops instead of shrimp, which worked just as well. I also used less soy sauce in the filling (1 tsp). I cooked & assembled them in small batches, which goes quickly, once you get into a rhythm. Also, I've found that brushing the entire wonton wrapper lightly w/ beaten egg white works best for holding them together. Forget that "water around the edges" bit. You don't need "boiling hot water" for steaming - regular water is fine & the cooking time is shorter per batch than indicated. To the dipping sauce, I added peanut butter, oyster sauce & Asian chili paste to give it more flavor & "zing". This is a great basic Chinese dumpling recipe & you can use almost any filling. I also tried chopped shiitake mushrooms, scallions, water chestnuts & cilantro. Next time, maybe I'll add lobster too - I can't wait to try all kinds of future fillings for these - perhaps even making Italian ravioli using the same cooking method.

I added some sweet rice wine and crushed fresh garlic to the dipping sauce. Les salty and smoother. I also added some chili sauce (the asian kind) to half of the dipping sauce for those who like it hot.

Excellent, easy recipe; dipping sauce was a little too harsh-added some sugar (honey would work also); will make again and again

These were soooo TASTY!!! I doubled the recipe and got way more than the 28 expected. The browning then steaming seemed a bit labor intensive since I had many. The dipping sauce was a fabulous compliment. Everyone at my party devoured them.

I had never made dumplings before, but tried this recipe for the first time for an important dinner. They were incredibly easy to prepare and tasted wonderfully. I added chopped spinach and also a little chili paste to the sauce. I also prepared them about three hours before I planned to serve them just to the point of browning the bottoms. When the company arrived a few hours later, I only had to add the boiling water to steam them and they were hot and ready to eat within minutes. Wonderful appetizer. The presentation and flavor were stunning.

Easy and excellent. I served these with the soy dipping sauce and the spicy peanut sauce (Gourmet - April 1996).

I actually dropped these into a Tom Young Goong type of broth after steaming them and they were delicious. This was a request from my husband. I will definitely make them again straight with dipping sauce. They are the quintessential shrimp dumplings, it seems. Delish!

Super easy and great - I have made this several times. We dip the dumplings in a little wasabi and/or hot mustard for a kick.

I have made this recipe countless times now, and all who try the dumplings beg for more. Easy dish, especially if you have helpers to fold them. Great for brunch.

First time I ever made dumplings. I normally don't make things that involve so much labor like hand folding dumplings. I tripled the recipe, that was a lot of folding. Anyway they were a hit. Did not steam them I boiled them, like raviolis, in chicken stock. Served them with dipping soy sauce and peanut sauce. Try them, worth the work.

Tasty filling and not difficult.

Very easy to make. I steamed some in a bamboo steamer with lettuce underneath, which makes for a nice change.
