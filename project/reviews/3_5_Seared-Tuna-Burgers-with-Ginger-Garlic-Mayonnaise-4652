My family loves this recipe. It is quick and easy both for prep and clean up. We've also tried it with other fish and with sauteed soft crabs. Works with everything!

This recipe was really easy to make, but it wasn't really that flavorful. There was also no need to double the recipe for four steaks.

Great weeknight dinner -- the sauce was wonderful, especially with a bit more lemon and a few dashes of hot sauce.

Wow - this is super tasty! And amazingly easy!! I turned it into a salad instead of a burger and had rocket (couldn't get arugula) and mixed leaves, as well as french fries.

This is soooooo good. I have tried it with tilapia too, but it doesnt hold together well enough. Stick to the recipe and you wont be dissapointed!

Wow. Awesome, quick recipe and very good. I can't leave well enough alone and added some avocado to the top, and it was heavenly!

I guess this is not so much a review as a recommendation. Try these burgers using leftover ginger aioli from the soy-sake shrimp recipe. Out of this world!

I added tomatoes and grilled asparagus on top - so easy and fast to make on a weeknight. And it looks GREAT

Really fantastic dish! IMHO, the best fish sandwich recipe on this site. The lemon peppery taste of the mayo and arugula is a great complement to the buttery tuna.

Very nice twist to a grilled hamburger. I sprinkled the tuna with salt and garlic pepper and then grilled outside as opposed to searing. I too added dijon mustard and honey to the sauce and it was yummy. I also topped with tomato slices (because they are so in season)in addition to the arugula.

Excellent and couldn't be easier. I am generally not found of cooked tuna but this dish works. Add some additional lemon juice, hot sauce and lots of arugula.

Easy and fast for a light supper or lunch. For a twist, I sprinkled Shichimi Pepper (a blend of Japanese spices) on the tuna steaks before searing. Enjoy!

Incredible. It's a favorite in our house. I've made this many times, and given the recipe to lots of friends. Never a disappointment.

I didn't have arugula, just lettuce, which was too bad because otherwise this would have been a five star recipe! It's light, clean tasting and the mayo mixture just perfect. Best of all, it was a snap to make - gourmet fast food.
