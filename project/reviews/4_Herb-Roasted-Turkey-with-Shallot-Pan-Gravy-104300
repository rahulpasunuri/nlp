I have used this turkey recipe for the last five years as the turkey always turns out with a beautiful golden color and tastes great. However, I have not had much luck with the gravy as the shallots burn to a crisp and there is very little broth in the pan by the time the bird is cooked. I baste every 30 minutes with 3/4 cup broth. Any hints on how to keep the shallots from burning to a crisp?

I am never tempted to try a new recipe for turkey at Thanksgiving. This one makes the best gravy I've ever had.

Outstanding! I used a bunch more shallots in the bottom of the roasting pan and ground them all up to add to the gravy. My family went nuts, the turkey was so moist! The leftovers were also fabulous; not at all dry. This will be my go-to turkey in the future.

Made this pretty much as written and it was very good. Brined the turkey beforehand which guaranteed moist breast meat. The gravy was excellent and everyone loved it. The only change I might make is to add less stock during the basting so more brown bits develop in the pan. Will definitely make it again.

I don't usually post reviews. I was meandering through recipes for my favorite time of year, Thanksgiving and saw this recipe posted. Let me tell you, I have made this receipe for years and it is simply the best ever!!! The shallot gravy is phenomenol. Not one ounce of turkey or gravy has ever been wasted. Make this turkey this year...and every year as it will become a treasure for years to come!

Loved it, turkey turned out great. I used the "butterfly" technique from another recipe to shorten cooking time but loved the herb-salt-pepper-butter-shallot flavorings and the gravy made from this recipe. Very easy and delicious gravy.

My sisters and I split the cooking for Thanksgiving and I usually make the turkey. Saw a recipe similar to this in a local paper. Told my youngest sister about it and she directed me to this recipe. OMG!!!!!!!!! I will never make any other turkey except this again. I pureed the shallots and used dry vermouth instead of wine. Even our kids loved it!!!

fantastic recipe. i have made it the last five years. if i want to double the broth to have more gravy do i need to double the wine too?

This has become my go-to Thanksgiving turkey recipe. The gravy is just out of this world! I tried brining the turkey last year, and the meat came out mushy and undercooked. I'm back to this recipe this year and my mouth is already watering.

My mother-in-law has been doing Thanksgiving dinner for 53 years. Last year, I decided I wanted to give it a try. I made this turkey recipe. It was a hit! Everyone said the herbs were perfect and it was so moist. It was so good that I have been asked by my mother-in-law to make the turkey again this year...

WAY too much butter. The stuffing even ended up too oily from the excessive amounts of butter.

Rating: 4
Every year I try something "new" that I have picked up on TV or seen online to get the best turkey and this year was no exception. I will not have to look again, this is the best recipe ever! I will continue to make this recipe every year. The turkey was so moist and the gravy was amazing. I also increased the stock to make sure I had plenty of gravy and I cooked my turkey breast side down after icing the breasts with ice in ziplock bags for an hour before cooking. It was a hit with my family. Everyone agreed it was the best turkey ever! Thanks soo much for the recipe.

It's been years since I did the turkey for T-day - and this recipe was PERFECT! It was a huge hit with my guests. The herbed butter spread under the skin ensures that the breast meat will be moist and flavorful. The shallots and herbs infuse a delicious flavor through all of the meat. I'm fortunate to have an herb garden in the back, so I used all fresh-picked herbs, which made for a powerful herb taste. I used about 1.5 times the amount of stock for basting, and ended up with a lot of juices - which I cooked down a bit to reduce, intensifying the flavors. I also took a suggestion from a review below and pureed some of the shallots to blend in with the gravy. Note that the recipe calls for way too little flour - I needed to double it to get the gravy to thicken enough. Be sure to take your turkey out of the oven just before it hits 180, and then cover it with foil to stand for 20 minutes. It will continue to cook inside for a few minutes, and then your breast meat won't be overcooked.

It was my first time making turkey at thanksgiving and I was very nervous. However, this recipe was easy and tasty- and I had a very successful thanksgiving dinner. We used extra herbs, and made a "raft" out of carrots and celery and laid the turkey down on it.

Delicious recipe for my first turkey! I prefer to keep things on the healthy side so I used about 1/4 of the butter called for and still recieved rave reviews. I didn't add butter to the gravy either, just the herbs. The shallots really made the gravy outstanding, I just wish I had more of it, next time I'll add more broth. I already have requests to make this again for Christmas dinner.

Awesome. First ever turkey (as you can tell from my panicked note below). I used a 20 lb bird and it was terrific. Gravy was, as advertised, excellent (though mine was a little thin).

This was delicious! I've made a few turkeys, but so infrequently that I always feel like it's the first time. THis was really very good. We had to cook the legs and wings a little longer but we put them back in the oven with the shallots and it just smelled amazing. I was too full to eat more, but considered having it for breakfast!

I've made this twice now for Thanksgiving and everything about it is fabulous. The turkey is moist and flavorful and the gravy is wickedly good. I added rosemary to the herb butter this year and used a lot less shallots and I still had more than enough. This one will become my standard recipe for Thanksgiving!

I was concerned about not brining the turkey but it came out juicy and beautiful with great crisp skin. The gravy is beyond delicious. I left the shallots in the gravy and pureed everything with my stick blender. Everyone raved.

Out of necessity, I had to buy a fresh turkey at Whole Foods which cost $75! I thought this better be a fantastic recipe and it was! My only problem was there was not enough left over gravy which was absolutely delicious. I would add more broth the next time.

The turkey was great, but the gravy was off the chart! The herb butter and wine give the gravy a rich smooth flavor unlike none other. This is a keeper!

This is the best freakin' turkey ever! The gravy will bring you to your knees :) The only thing I did different was to put the shallots and gravy in my food processor and puree until smooth, then returned to the pan to thicken with the flour/butter mixture. I use this recipe with a whole chicken or whole chicken breast too. No sense waiting for Thanksgiving!

This was the first time I ever made a turkey by myself, or a turkey in the oven. Additionally, my family never made gravy when I was growing up. I made this for myself and some guests for Thanksgiving, and everybody loved it, especially the gravy.

I've made this recipe the last three Thanksgivings and it's been a big hit every time. One of my guests just asked me to send the recipe. That's why I'm on the site adding my two cents. My tip: use big shallots if possible. The most time consuming elements is peeling those shallots. Maybe some day Trader Joe's will sell them pre-peeled but for the time being you're on your own.

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner this year. It is only the second turkey that I have ever cooked. Easy preparation, though it seemed to need a lot of extra chicken broth for basting. Gravy had terrific flavor. I highly recommend to all.

This is my favorite Thanksgiving turkey. The flavor is exceptional, and the gravy even better. I have made this with both full turkeys and boneless turkey breasts, and always get a turkey with great taste that is moist and memorable. My family begs me every year to use this recipe.

Look no further, you've found your turkey recipe for this year. Every Thankgiving I review hundreds of recipes to see what I'm going to make. the one constant each year is this turkey. If I could bottle the gravy and sell it, I could retire in a couple years. It's amazing. The one thing I do differently is use a hand blender to break down the shallots and make it a smoother gravy. As for the stuffing, I prefer to bake it separately because of the amount of butter going under the skin of the bird. I have baked it in the turkey, though, and I had plenty of drippings for gravy. I can't remember how much longer I cooked it though. As someone else said, prepare the herb butter and skin the shallots the night before to save on time.

this sounds like a fabulous recipe with unanimous 4 forks-- but I want to try it with a cornbread stuffing of some sort; can anyone recommend one that goes particularly well? Also, how will it change the roasting time and amount of pan juices if the bird is stuffed? Is it best to bake the stuffing separately for this recipe? Thanks in advance....

Terrific recipe. The turkey looked beautiful; nicely browned and the herbs dressed it up even more. The turkey flavor was great and very moist; the gravy was wonderful. Only caution is I thought the recipe could be more precise about how much of the herb butter and chicken broth you use at various stages of preparation. I made some notes for next time because this will definitely be my standard for Thanksgiving from now on.

I brined the bird for about 8 hours in Alton Brown's brine, and then followed this recipe exactly. Several relatives came up to me and said (out of earshot of the usual cook) that this was the best bird they ever had. A word of warning though, if you do brine the bird, do not make gravy out of the pan drippings. Too salty.

As said many times below, you'll never find a better gravy. It was incredible. The turkey, too, was very moist and delicious. But that gravy is what dreams are made of. One tip: throw in a few more shallots because they are like candy and people were picking them out of the pan every time I turned my back.

This was my first-ever turkey and I made it for Thanksgiving. I used a fresh, natural turkey (no injections to make it juicy). The only change from the recipe was that there really weren't any pan juices during the last hour of roasting, so I just used another 1/2 cup of broth per basting. The turkey was perfect - very moist and flavorful and the gravy was wonderful. Everyone RAVED! I was really proud!

I made this turkey the first time a few years ago when I was the hostess for the family Thanksgiving feast for the first time, when I was a beginner cook and my new mother-in-law was coming for dinner. Talk about pressure! The turkey was the moistest that I have ever had and the gravy was fabulous. My mother-in-law was impressed enough to pass the sceptor to me to host the Thanksgiving dinner for the next year and, I suspect, forever. Excellent recipe!

We made this recipe two years ago but I couldn't find my magazine, so I came online to retrieve it. I was pleased to read the other reviews and to see that my judgment about this recipe was vindicated--it truly is the best gravy ever. Indeed, I didn't even know why people fussed so much about gravy until I tried this one. (As for the person who used the gravy mix, well, try a little harder this year!)

I made this when it appeared in Bon Appetit and have made it every year since. It is always requested. This was the best turkey ever and a tip to keep it extra moist is to rub the turkey down with mayonaise before beginning. It will not change the flavor at all, but will give you moist tender turkey. Great recipe!

Absolutely fabulous dish...the turkey comes out moist and the sauce is out of this world! Be sure and use fresh herbs. I halved the recipe and used a 5# turkey breast, since we don't eat legs or wings. Definitely one of the best dishes I've found here.

I loved the shallot pan gravy. I put stuffing in the bird on top of the herbs and shallots, and, I have to say, it came out deliciously.

Rating: 3
This had great potential, but didn't live up to it. We were gifted with a smaller, "untreated" turkey. I adjusted cooking time accordingly, but the pan juices were negligible and what there was burned to the bottom of the pan as the broth just kept evaporating (and I kept adding & basting). It tasted & looked good despite this, and with all the prior rave reviews I might have to try again with a different type/size of turkey.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. The bird turned out wonderfully; however, I did not follow the directions for the gravy. I used Turkey gravy mix and added some of the pan juices to it. I don't think the pan juices would have produced ample amount of gravy for the meal. Overall, the recipe turned out wonderfully.

We did a trial run for Thanksgiving, and it was a good opportunity to try a different turkey recipe. We roasted the turkey in a turkey bag, and it turned out very, very tender and moist. The gravy was tasty. Overall, I would rate this a delicious recipe, but not an exceptional recipe.

Wow, this was really good. Made for Mothers Day... The best part? The roasted shallots in the bottom of the pan. Fabulous. Served with Shredded Brussel Sprouts w/ Scallions (off this site), fresh homemade rolls, and Banana Cream Pie w/ Chocolate Chip Cookie crust. Very big hit with the fam!

This is a great roasted turkey recipe and I have only made a turkey a few times. The gravy is great. My only problem was that the breast did not brown nicely although it was very moist - I think it needed more time without the aluminum foil. Next time I might try it with cheese cloth instead of the foil.

This was the first turkey I had ever made, and as nervous as I was (nobody likes a dry bird), it turned out to be spectacular!
