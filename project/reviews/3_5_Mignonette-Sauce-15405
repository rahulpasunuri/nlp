Why is Vancouver wrong? He stated this is the recipe. It sure is what I've had when I've had Oysters with Mignonette Sauce - at the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, NY and other places. I'm sure the sauce described by IBDof is tasty, but it isn't mignonette - and I've only had it with red wine vinegar.

What's with you people? This is a recipe for Mignonette, a classic sauce for oysters. You may have a thousand more favored oyster garnishes, but they are NOT mignonette . So why are you trashing this for not being something else? I'm looking at you especially, Tap Room guy from IDBoF whatever that may be. Frankly, if you haven't had oysters with a classic mignonette, you're missing one of life's great treats, but to each her own.

The recipe, I am familiar with, contains coarse ground white peppercorn and cloves in a muslin and, it comes with white wine vinegar when applied to lamb or chicken; it comes with red wine vinegar when intended for beef or potatoes.

This IS the traditional receipe as long as you use red wine vinegar. Vancouver is wrong.

Brad - while your sauce may be a good one, it is not a mignonette which is wine vinegar, pepper and shallots with the optional addition of salt. I am sure that there are many other great sauces out there but this is a traditional recipe and the proportions are just right although the salt could be reduced to taste.

My recipe is much better. Combine to taste: * Shallots, finely minced. * Flatleaf parsley, finely minced. * Lemon juice, freshly sequeezed (enough to give it a very wet salsa-like consistency) * Drizzle of CPEVO (just enough to add a little richness, mouthfeel and flavor - but not enough to make it oily) * A few stray drops of simple syrup (just enough to add a tiny trace of sweetness in the finish, but not enough to make it sweet) Mix, and let rest for 1-2 hours in the fridge, to let the flavors marry. It will thicken slightly, and the shallots and parsley will tenderize in the acid. You shouldn't need to add salt ... clams and oysters are already sufficiently briny. At most, add a whisper of white pepper.

fantastic over blue point oysters and a glass of champagne! use shallots not onions for the best flavor.

Great alternative to cocktail sauce for oysters on the half shell!
