Too sweet for my taste. I ended up doubling the lemon juice and adding a pint of fresh raspberries (pureed and strained). Then it was perfect.

Incredible. It is a great accompaniment to cakes or can be used for a topper on ice cream. I love the simplicity of this recipe.

This was perfect! Sweet but not sweetened. And ready in an instant. I whipped it up and served it over purchased angelfood cake for an instant dinner-party dessert. My guests were cleaning the plates with their fingers!

This is a very simple and excellent sauce. My favorite use for this is with a very rich flourless chocolate torte.

Wonderful sauce, the crowning glory for the raspberry pistachio ice cream pie with almond praline. Would be especially fun to make pie with sauce at Christmas time because of the colors, other than it was absolutely delicious!
