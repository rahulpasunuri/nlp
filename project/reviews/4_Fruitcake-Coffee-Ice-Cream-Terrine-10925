I LOVE FRUITCAKE!!!! I also love coffee Ice cream, and a dessert with the combination of the two was just heavenly. To make this dessert even better, use either Ben and Jerry's "Coffee Heath Bar Crunch", or any of the Starbucks coffee flavored ice creams. I know it sounds really strange, but try it!! Also, use a good quality fruitcake and the results will really please you.
