Not recommended. The cakes didn't hold together very well, and the addition of the shitakes was not good (plus, the mushrooms didn't get cooked through). I didn't especially like the taste of the aioli, either. There are too many good crabcake recipes out there to use this one again!

Yum! They're a little tricky to get to hold together (I've used a little panko, as a binder and coating, when I don't have time to let them sit). Regular lemon and sour cream are ok, but it's a much better recipe with the more subtle flavors of Meyer lemon and creme fraiche. But good luck finding a Meyer outside of citrus-growing states. Some gourmet groceries carry them at certain times of the year.

THis recipe was disgusting! I picked fresh crab out of the critter. What a waste of good crabmeat! Cook's Illustrated 1995 (August) had a fabulous crab cake recipe. Wish I had used the fresh crab for that recipe instead! Will never make this recipe again.

Excellent! Use a gentle hand when mixing together ingredients, as well as when you turn them in the pan (as stated earlier by another reviewer, before you cook them, let sit in the fridge for a bit, 10 minutes). The flavors are very delicate. These would be wonderful for serving at brunch. Although a regular lemon may be used, The Meyer lemon is worth seeking out, as their semi-sweet, delicate flavor does not overpower the crab.

Our friends served these as a first course on Thanksgiving. They were absolutely divine!

Made this tasty recipe last night. Very easy. Perhaps my shitake mushrooms were on the large size...4 was just a bit too much. Other than that, would make again.

I thought these were excellent, and so simple! You do have to let them sit for a few minutes to hold together before cooking.

This recipe was quite easy and quick (only difficulty was in cooking getting the fritter to hold together but by the second or third fritter it worked) and DELICIOUS! Served it to guests and everyone loved it. I didn't have Meyer lemon and used regular lemon and it was perfect.
