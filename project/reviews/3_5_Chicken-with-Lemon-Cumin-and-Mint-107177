Really makes a chicken breast interesting!

Following other reviews, I omitted the chicken wings and cut the lemon juice in half. I did not have lemon oil so used olive oil only cut that back to 1/4 cup. I baked the marinated thighs in a clay pot, with a lid surrounded by large pieces of potato and sweet potato, rubbed with the marinade at 375 for 45 minutes. The thighs I used were bone-in and skin on so I removed the lid and broiled the dish until the skin was browned and crispy. So easy and delicious. I am making it again tonight for a ladies get-together.

Liked it for sure although I would recommend all thighs and no wings. Went really well with couscous and cucumber/tomato salad

You don't need quite as much oil to cover this much chicken. Lemon amount was fine, but then I used Meyer lemons because I have a tree full to use up, & they are milder. Double or triple the garlic & salt. But otherwise, very easy & quick, fresh tasting.

This is a great recipe! I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts, which I do not recommend; they turned out slightly dry, even though I covered them with foil and was careful to not overcook them. The combination of flavors is fantastic, though.

This dish was good, but the lemon was a bit overwhelming, even though I used less than called for. I might make it again with a different version of the marinade that's less heavy on the lemon. Also followed advice of others and layered mushrooms and thinly sliced potatoes under the chicken and marinade (couldn't find the kind recommended so used baby portobellas). They added a bit of body to the recipe.

Very forgiving recipe! I accidentally added way too much paprika and only used the juice of one lemon. I also used chicken breasts and only marinated for about 15 minutes. It turned out wonderful! Very flavorful, juicy, tender, and super easy. Will definitely make this again.

Definitely easy, with ingredients you already have. Didn't have much flavor beyond the lemon, it over powered the other flavors. I made it with chicken breasts over rice. Good dinner, but I wouldn't make it again.

Easy, light, and tasty! A 1:1 mix of mint and cilantro was used for a more mild mint flavor. Great to pair with roasted vegetables.

I finally got a chance to try this recipe with mint. It needed a lot more mint than the little package from the grocery store provided. The flavor was actually better with the oregano. Best thing is that it's really easy. I also used the micro plane for the lemon zest -- only way to do it.

Love this dish. Great to double or triple for a dinner party. I use mint or cilantro interchangeably -- delicious with either herb. I tend to pass the lemon over a microplane rather than zesting, just because it's easier.

We made this in a resort cook-off today and BBQ'd it rather than broiled,and boiled down the marinade with a little leftover Pinot Grigio that we strained for a sauce. With a few grilled lemon slices and sprigs of mint, it looked great and tasted better... even the 5 year old liked it. We took first place! Nan and Elizabeth from Canada at Hilton Head

Fabulous dish! I also made a few changes worth noting. Used the juice of 1 lemon along with the peel of half a lemon. I substituted corriander for the mint and used olive oil instead of lemon oil. Also layered sliced cremini mushrooms followed by thinly sliced potatoes in the roasting pan before covering with the chicken and marinade. Then roasted the entired dish under the broiler. Once the chicken was done, I placed the potatoes and mushrooms back under the broiler to get some colour. Served with crusty bread to sop up the sauce - it was just delicious! - wife and kids loved it too!

I wanted to use mint and chicken, and this used only ingrediants I had. It was quite tasty as I made. Lots of changes. I used olive oil - 3 weeks ahead for lemon oil was not in the cards. I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts - and I cut them into bite sized piece, marinated and then sauteed it in the marinade. I added about 1T flour at the end to thicken the sauce. I also got some of the flavors into the rice which worked quite well.

The market was out of fresh mint so I used fresh oregano from my garden. This dish was still excellent but I can't wait to try it with mint.

Rating: 4
Easy to make and delicious! I omitted the lemon zest (didn't have fresh lemons), doubled the garlic, and used a bit more cumin and paprika than called for. I did use the mint... I was afraid that it would ruin the flavor of the dish, but it added a wonderful light note that balanced the spices. Will definitely make this one all summer as we have loads of mint here!

This is pretty good but 1/4 teaspoon of salt is not nearly enough for this quantity of chicken. Next time I would also increase the cumin and bake the chicken because the wings need to render more of the fat in their skin.

This is easy to prepare. I substituted 1 1/2tsp cumin +1/4 tsp cayenne pepper for the paprika. Chop a bit more mint for garnish. I simmered the marinade juices with 1/4 cup dry white wine until slightly reduced then strained and served over chicken.

WHOAH! So easy and SO GOOD! And I didn't even have to go buy new groceries!

This was delicious! I made a few changes and substitutions that I think brought it home: 1. Cilantro instead of mint--this was incredible. 2. Chose the olive oil over the lemon oil--it would have been WAY too lemony otherwise. 3. Added one extra garlic clove, as well as some crushed red peppers and chili powder, just for a little spice. 4. Put in an extra 1/2 teaspoon of the cumin. The only thing I would do differently next time is the lemon zest. About a third of the required lemon I would actually zest with a zester. The other two thirds I would again use the peeler, but then chop up the pieces a bit more. Otherwise the pieces of zest you get are sometime too large. A great dish!

Delicious! I used boneless chicken breasts, cilantro instead of mint, and ras al hanout and chipotle powder instead of hot paprika, because that's what I had on hand, and it still turned out great!

I've made this twice using only boneless skinless thighs and baked it in the marinade. I found there's WAY too much lemon, so on the second attemmpt I doubbled the spices and left out the lemon peel. This didn't have much effect--still too lemony. My next attempt will include doubling the spices, halfing the lemon juice, adding the peel, and 2 tbls. of honey.

I made this with chicken breasts. Cut down the olive oil and increased the spices/ garlic and it was pretty good for a quick, healthy weekday meal. With the leftover marinated (but uncooked) chicken, I cooked down with some Greek yoghurt the next day. I liked this version even better. Overall, a good easy recipe. I think that with bone on thigh meat, on the grill, this could be delicious.

This is my favorite chicken recipe of all times. It works just as well with split chiken breasts as well, but the thighs come out delectable. Goes great with cous cous and a chpped cucumber salad.

I'm agreeing that the marinade/dressing benefits from doubling and adding some spice (I added red pepper flakes as suggested)- I disagree with using *an entire bulb* of garlic....I used about 4-5 cloves and it was much too much. Also took other advice and used breasts on the bone- delicious. Served with couscous....which was perfect.

Cinci's right -- it's a great dish, if you mess with it. I think the culprit here is the paprika--if you're using ordinary paprika instead of spicy,add some Tabasco--or chipotle powder, which is what I used and it was tremendous. More mint--or mint extract if your mint is anemic, works well also. A great picnic dish as well.

I used this recipe as a guide rather than following it exactly, and the result is a very tender and flavorful dish that always gets lots of compliments. When I make it, I use LOTS more garlic - an entire bulb of pressed garlic. I double the spices (esp the cumin), and add red pepper, and use one lemon for juice and zest. I make it with a cut-up whole chicken, and shove the chunky stuff under the skin, and rub the outsides of the chickens with the remaining mixture. It's messy, but worth it. Then I grill the chickens on a covered charcoal grill for about an hour. It goes well with a greek salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, red onion, olive, feta and olive oil. This is a nice combo because you can do all of your prep ahead of time. I don't even turn the chickens. After you put the them on the grill, you can sit back and relax with a glass of wine until your guests arrive!

Absolutely delicious. I served it with rice that mimicked the marinade: lemon zest, lemon juice, paprika, cumin, and coriander.

I made this using bone in breasts with skin, and pushed a great deal of the spice mix under the skin in addition to letting it marinate. I agree with the rest of the reviewers that say this was missing something. I doubled the amount of mint, even, and it really didn't come through. I might make it again, but I would have to do something to rev up the flavor - crushed red pepper, perhaps.

Made this as written except using only boneless chicken thighs. Marinated them for about 5-6 hours, and then grilled the chicken. My husband and 2 teens all enjoyed it and said I should make it again. I think the additional time the chicken spent in the marinade helped with the problem some reviewers had that there was not as much flavor as they had expected.

This turns hum-drum chicken tangy and flavorful. Instead of marinating I just stirred everything together and simmered it for 20 minutes. Quick and easy!

I agree with the cook from Pennsylvania. I was expecting more flavor. I admit I forgot to sprinkle the chicken with mint and garlic at the end. I'll try this next time, maybe it'll add that punch I was hoping for.

I thought the marinade would give the chicken more flavor than it did. I doubled the amount of chopped garlic and mint at the end and this did the trick.
