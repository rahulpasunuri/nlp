Made this (as written) for Christmas dinner and it was very popular. It was light and fresh-tasting to go with all the other rich food. Easy to make ahead and nice that it didn't need reheating or last-minute fussing. I didn't add all the pickled onions to the beans, and the leftover onions were great on sandwiches and salads the next day.

I made this Thanksgiving day and nobody much cared for it. However, leftover the next day it was really tasty. The onion and dressing flavors permeated the green beans and really improved the dish. Make it a day ahead.

Good Thanksgiving traveler. We loved the piquancy of the pickeld onions, and the fact that this recipe didn't need any last minute cooking or reheating. It did add the dressing just before serving to keep the beans from discoloring.

Eh, decent recipe, I suppose, but nothing really special. It was, however, nice to have something on the Thanksgiving menu that could be prepared ahead and not served hot.

I love preparing vegetable dishes for pot lucks, as many of my friends are vegetarians. While this recipe does not add protien to the meal, it is a delight for the palate. I am a life-long lover of pickled anything, the sweeter the better. This recipe hit the spot. I have never tried to pickle onions before, but this was so easy, I think I'll keep playing with this form and see what happens. The recipe was a bit confusing in its directions, and I ended up adding the maple syrup and oil to the main pickling stock, but it did NO harm to the onions, probably enhanced the maple flavor. I did a variety of other work in the kitchen while preparing this recipe (being the multi-tasker that I am). Additionally, I loved that it was a cook ahead, and store in the refrigerator type of meal - perfect for a pot luck. I will definiately prepare this dish again.
