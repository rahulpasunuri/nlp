I was looking for a recipe to use leftover egg whites and found this. I'd never eaten a baked alaska, let alone made one, but this sounded fun and it was. It was really easy but you do need to plan ahead for the freezing time. I used vanilla ice cream and left out the cardamom. It's very impressive and very good. I will make it again.

yummy! yummy! yummy! I had never made a baked alaska before and this was surprisingly easy. It takes time to freeze, but there is very little time spent in the kitchen. It was a hit! The peach ice cream was fabulous with the sauce! I wouldn't change a thing.

Es muy rico, pero porqué no ponen la fotografía de la misma para darnos mas cuenta de como se prepara?

I love this recipe! It is easy to make but it looks super fancy. Next time I would probably leave out the cardamom or maybe try to substitute it with cinnamon. The fruit in California is so sweet that you probably don't need to add anything.

My guests loved this recipe. I couldn't find peach ice cream so substituted peach frozen yogurt, less fat and just as delicious. Very easy to make.
