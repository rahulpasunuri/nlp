Quick and easy. I substituted shallots for the green onions and sauted them with the red peppers from the start. The trick with the sauce is to deglaze the pan with the white wine and reduce to only a few tablespoons before adding the cream.

Great recipe! It was easy to make and turned out very well. I substituted wall nuts for pine nuts and it still turned out quite well. I would recommend adding broccoli as well, however. Goes well with white wine.

I chopped the green onions instead of cutting them lengthwise. My family really liked this dish, and I have made it a couple of times.

My husband and 2 and 4 year old sons loved this. I made as directed, but took advice of other reviewers and added garlic (6 cloves). I was a little disappointed with consistency of sauce -- VERY thin. I knew it was supposed to be light, but it was like milk. I added a bunch of parmesan to thiken a bit. Served with chilled asparagus, blue cheese, tomatoe salad -- great combination!

I was looking for a pasta dish that would help me use up some extra sweet peppers, and this one was surprisingly delightful. At first glance, it looks almost too simple and subtle, but after several bites the flavors bubbled together in my mouth. I used tagliatelle and I imagine a variety of pastas could be substitued for the penne. The cream sauce was just enough to add a light flavoring, without being so heavy as to drown the dish (as one often finds in fettucine-type recipes).

This dish was wonderful. The presentation was spectacular and my guests thought it was outstanding. I added a bit more garlic for some extra punch.

This was quick and easy. I only used 1 pepper and added a diced small tomato. Also substituted evaporated milk and a bit of light cream cheese for the heavy cream. Was not spectacular, but nice for a quick dish.

Yea, ok, so this dish is decent, but only if you're looking to try it for the sake of trying it. I made it a year ago, my health eaters thought it had too much butter drippings/greasy tasting in the mouth. While my rich food eaters felt that it lacked anything great. A lot of work for a mediocre side dish/ wouldn't serve it as a main.

Quick to make and delicious. It doesn't get any better than that! When my supermarket was out of heavy cream I substituted light cream with no loss of flavor. The sauce wasn't quite as thick, but it was still good. I may even try it with 1/2 and 1/2 to cut out some more fat. My husband doesn't like pine nuts, so he left them on. My 8-year old loved this dish. Served it with fresh pita bread to mop up the sauce. We'll definitely have this often.

I thought the recipe called for too much red peppers--I like the idea about roasting the peppers. I also seasoned with garlic salt.

This pasta recipe is a favorite of ours. It is quick and easy. The only ingredient I found was lacking was garlic. I added 6-7 cloves grated. What a difference. I also roasted the red peppers.
