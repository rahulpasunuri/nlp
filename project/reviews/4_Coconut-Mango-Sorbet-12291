I couldn't find cream of coconut so I just scooped out the creamy part from an unshaken can of coconut milk. I'm not crazy about mango by itself, but it mixes so well with the coconut, pineapple and lime here...delicious!

Wonderful, easy dessert. I doubled the amount of coconut cream to give it more flavor.

I've made this one twice now and it definitely a keeper. A great blend of flavor, but the mango really shines through. I double the recipe for my Cuisinart ice cream maker and it freezes to a beautiful consistency. At a recent pot luck I froze it on site and it was gone in a flash. It does become very solid if put in a freezer, so is best frozen and then eaten immediately. It only takes 30-45 minutes, so perfect to start just before dinner. Just need to find a spot for the Cuisinart-it's way to loud to have in the kitchen!!

This actually has a lot less cream of coconut than other recipes. Our store now carries a squeeze bottle which is great for these less-than a can recipe! We really enjoyed this recipe and will do again. Perfect solution for my very ripe mango.

This was truly luscious! The cocnut cream gives it lots of body...my guests were thrilled!

Many thanks for the reviews. Based on your comments, I experimented a little. I used light coconut milk and increased the amount to 1/2 cup. I made the syrup with only 1/2 c. water to account for the increase in fluid(used a 1 c glass measure in the micro to account for small volume). Then, I added 2 tsp coconut extract- imitation was all i could find. The end result tastes very good, though i suspect the texture is creamier with cream of coconut. I liked it quite well, easily enough to make it again.

Scrumptious! I served this as the final course of a 4 course Thai dinner, and it received rave reviews from everyone. I too wince at the ingredients of the coconut cream, and would love to hear if anyone has been successful with alternatives.

Heavenly! I've made it many times and it's always a hit. If you can find key limes, use them - makes it really tart and refreshing!

Very, very tasty. However, I am not pleased that cream of coconut has hydrogenated soy bean oil in it - making what could be a very healthy treat, not quite as healthy. Next time I may try sweetened condensed milk (maybe even fat free?) with a touch of coconut extract as a replacement and see how that works. I really like the creamy texture of this sorbet....mmmmmmm.

This is definitely a keeper! I've made it many times, and is so refreshing for summer. I can make the mixture ahead of time, and add to the ice cream maker (Cuisinart) about a half hour before I want to serve it. I always double the recipe, use cream of coconut, not coconut milk, and use the zest of one lime.

Excellent flavor, but the coconut taste was barely detectable. I doubled the recipe as recommended, but would stick with the original proportions next time to see if that helps the coconut shine through. It did not freeze to the nicest consistency, however-- again, perhaps because I doubled the recipe? Tasted very, very good.

As other reviews before me, this is awesome! I added a little more lime zest. This sorbet has the richness of the cream of coconut but not overpowering the wonderful mango and lime taste. Great refresher!

I've made this sorbet three times exactly according to the recipe--it's absolutely delicious, and I've gotten nothing but rave reviews from those I've served it to. Double the recipe!

This has great flavor! I used coconut nectar instead of cream of coconut; the nectar had less body and less sweetness. I found I had to up the sugar to balance it out, so I would recommend sticking with cream of coconut. Otherwise, delicious. Made great popsicles!

I changed this recipe to pineapple instead of mango. 1 1/2 cups of pineapple (fresh) along with 3/4 cups of the juice. 1/2 cup of the cream of coconut and 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice. This turned out wonderful. I added lite whipped topping along with toasted pecans and coconut for crunch, the flavors were excellent together. Add this one to your recipe file.
