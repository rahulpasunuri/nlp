Delicious and perfect for summer. Like everyone else, I did not use an ice cream maker. I use an ice tray and put melon cubes in my soup. I also made a cocktail by adding a little more lime to the soup and mixing it with rum.

This was delicious and easy to make. Great on a hot day. Received compliments from my guests and my 1.5 yr. old liked it too. I did not need an ice cream maker. My plums were very ripe and sweet. Don't think that I needed the full cup of sugar.

Perfect summer dessert. Soup and ice together is delicious and warrants additional high marks for the colorful presentation. I managed just fine without an ice cream maker and will definitely make again.

This was just lovely - a very nice, refreshing dessert on a hot summer day. The tarragon adds lovely contrast to the sweetness of the plums and honeydew. It was easy to make. It could easily be done without an ice ream maker. Just freeze and stir it until it resembles a granita or an ice.
