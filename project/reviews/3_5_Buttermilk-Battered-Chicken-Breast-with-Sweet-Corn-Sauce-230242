Excellent recipe! Used only 1 cup of broth+ marinated in buttermilk for 1 hr and it was perfect.

I LOVED this. The sauce is soooo yummy just wanted to eat it on its own. Fantastic recipe I make it at least once a month! My family loves it too!

made it for the family.(3 adults-4children) all liked the chicken but no one liked the sauce.

Yummy! Since others said the sauce was a little runny, I did add a shake of cornstarch while it was reducing, which seemed to help some. I also used some little dried red pepper I bought in Zanzibar, but don't know what it is (looks like the little chiles in Indian cookbooks) and it definitely was spicy enough! The batter smudged off the bottom of the chicken when I lifted it--adding more oil after flipping would probably fix that problem.

Not that great, just OK. wouldn't waste my time making it again.

I wasn't that crazy about this recipe - I thought the sauce was kind of runny and the chicken itself so-so. With all the chicken recipes out there, I wouldn't waste my time with this one.

I substituted a chili blend (basically everything listed) for the specific spices. I also STRONGLY recommend using a non stick grill pan to cook, otherwise the "crust" of the chicken sticks to the pan, not the chicken! My kids loved this and so did my husband and I.

Awesome! My kids even ate it. I served it on a bed of baby spinach and it added a lot. I made the sauce earlier in the day and reheated, great and easy for a weeknight, but I am planning on doing it for guests too.

The chicken comes out with a very crispy crust and OH so tender inside. Sauce is sweet with a hint of spicy, suggest puree only half instead of all of it to get more of a corn relish/salsa. Excellent meal!
