This was way too sweet for me.

Very good! Beware of overheating the pan - if the sugar burns it gives a bitter flavor.

Very v. good., a hit with boyfriend and guests. I used excellent (and sweet) Comice pears so I reduced the sugar from 1/2 c to about 1/4 or 1/3 c which was perfect. I took another reviewers suggestion to reduce liquid a bit after removing pears and this made a nice thick sauce to put on top of the crepes when broiling. Served with 2 dollops of Haagen-Dazs Dulce de Leche frozen yogurt. Perfect.

How quick and easy can you get? This was simple to throw together as I was prepping the rest of dinner, and I just let it simmer a while. Served over vanilla ice cream, and it was wonderful. The only thing I might change (and perhaps my pears were overly juicy), would be to remove the pears at the end and reduce the liquid more, as it was rather runny (but no less delicious).

I made these with the crepes and fudge sauce, what a treat. I used ultra light cream and it was still great. Will be making these again.

This was wonderful. We've eaten it by itself, over ice cream, and I've made the sauce to put over oatmeal in the morning. I'd recommend adding a teaspoon of vanilla to the sauce for a little something extra. This is the dessert I use to impress company.

Next time, I'll use dark brown sugar and cut the amount of lemon juice in half. It was good but just a little too tart. It was great over waffles the next day.

The pears at the grocery store were not ripe, so I tried this with fuji apples--it was delicious, and my girlfriend loved it. If you try this substitution, be sure to add LESS sugar than the recipe calls for (the apples are already sweet). I served the apples with vanilla ice cream.

This was delicious and so easy. I used Bartlett pears. We served it over chocolate cake with whipped cream - yum!
