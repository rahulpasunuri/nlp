I've now made this several times for dinner parties. Everyone always loves it and its great for preparing ahead of time. Leave at room temp and then serve with a bourbon sauce. There's never any leftover.

Yum! I made this to use up some bread and marsala. My dish ended up being too small, so I didn't put all the custard or raisins in, but used the same amount of bread. I also left out the figs and lemon peel, and used half and half and 2% milk and only 3 tablespoons of butter. and only baked it for an hour. it was very good and rich without a sauce.

I have eaten bread pudding from sea to shining sea and never tasted one that had as much to offer. The figs, apples and raisins combined with the lemon scented vanilla custard were heavenly. I have served it warm topped with a bourbon sauce to end winter dinner parties on several occasions. It always plays to rave reviews! Thanks for this amazing recipe.
