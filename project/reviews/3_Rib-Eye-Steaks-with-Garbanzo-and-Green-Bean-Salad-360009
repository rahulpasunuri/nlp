I am sad to hear that several reviewers did not like the salad - I haven't actually made the meat in this recipe, but I've made the salad about dozen times, and it's always been a great hit at parties, especially in spring-summer-fall. It's very elegant and easy - the key to making it great is a VERY good white wine vinegar. I've been using a Spanish Chardonay vinegar that I got from FreshDirect.com, and it's fabulous in this salad. Also, do use some salt - it really helps to round off the flavors.

Bean salad also tastes great with yellow wax beans fresh from the farmer's market...and I prefer to boil my own garbanzo beans for even better taste.

Not bad, but not wow. The steaks are just grilled steaks. The rub is similar to something that I would put on most steaks. The salad is fine, but the vinaigrette is short on flavor. I added some of the lemon juice and some extra cilantro and Italian parsley. Next time maybe a spoonful of mustard or some garlic/shallots would help give it a little more punch. To the salad I added some roasted red pepper and homegrown tomatoes.

Made some adjustments to the recipe to fit my taste and it turned out great! Instead of white wine vinegar, I used white balsamic vinegar. Switched up the proportion of the haricots verts and garbanzo (heavier on the haricots verts). Didnt have mesquite on hand, so I used a Ribeye dry rub and a little chipotle powder. Wife and I loved it!

This salad is completely lacklustre!! It tasted fine but when I'm sitting down to dinner at the end of the day I want to be able to rave about what I'm consuming. I won't make it again.

A good mid week meal or for the weekend. We grilled the steaks on the gas grill. Great favor. Enjoyed the salad and will make again to serve with other entrees. Only had one can of garbanzo beans and that worked well. Lemon peel and cilantro added a fresh touch to the dressing.
