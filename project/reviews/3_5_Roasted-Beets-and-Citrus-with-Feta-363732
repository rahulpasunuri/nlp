Definitely time consuming but so delicious! Make sure not to add extra zest to the vinaigrette as it becomes a little too tingly on the tongue.

Great combination of flavors and drew rave reviews at dinner party last night. Substituted fresh goat cheese for the feta because that's what was in the fridge, and I would do it again. Might be good with some toasted sunflower seeds sprinkled on top, too.

Roast the beets ahead of time and then peel and slice as needed. Squeeze the juice from the citrus membranes into the dressing. So delicious!

If you like the ingredients, you will love this salad. The flavors are fantastic together. I roasted the beets a day ahead to save time and next time I make this I will peel the citrus ahead of time as peeling and sectioning it is time consuming on a work week night. I will definitely be making this again. Enjoy!
