I thought this cake was good, but not exceptional. For me, cakes are all about the cake itself and I did not find the cake part of this recipe to be outstanding. It was just ok. It worked well with the lemon curd and the frosting, but was fairly bland and not as tender as I would have liked. Maybe that was because I left out the xanthan gum, which is not a common ingredient in my kitchen. The cake did store well and was enjoyed for several days in our household. I found the frosting recipe did not make quite enough. I will probably augment by at least a quarter next time. Also, for those who think the recipe is too complicated, I used store bought lemon curd (Dickinson's is a popular East Coast brand) that worked very well.

Very lemony -- too much for me. Made it with flour, so perhaps that made a difference...

In a word: unbelievable! My youngest daughter makes this for me for Mother's Day, and it is a true labor of love. I have Celiac Disease, so it is hard to find great recipes - this is one of them. It is not a quick, easy recipe, but the effort is well worth it, trust me!

With the number of people opting for gluten-free diets these days, I must say that this cake recipe has served me well. I have made it 3 times so far. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. It was excellent! The second time, I doubled the cake, filling and frosting to end up with a four layer 12 inch cake. It was spectacular! The third cake was also a 12 inch layer but this time I followed a reviewer's suggestion to substitute coconut oil instead of canola. It was better still!

Have made this cake twice now and it's been a hit both times. After reading the reviews before making it the first time, I made the following changes: Doubled the lemon curd recipe, with extra lemon zest for tartness. I only made half the amount of the frosting but it was plenty for the cake and definitely was not too sweet when combined with the cake and filling. I agree it is expensive to invest in the ingredients for the brown rice flour mix, but I keep them in the fridge and have used them for other gluten-free baking adventures. ALSO It would be nice if Epicurious would highlight the fact that the words "brown rice flour mix" actually link to another ingredient list and recipe. A friend of mine printed the recipe not realizing that there was a link embedded. Her cake did not turn out well, as she only used brown rice flour.

I made this cake with regular flour, cut the sugar by 1/2 cup and did not add guar gum to the curd based on reviews by other users. I found the cake itself to have wonderful flavor, but it did not rise much and it was not as moist as I would have liked. I wonder if one could use 1/2 unsalted butter and 1/2 canola oil...I will make it again, but with modifications (separate the eggs, beat egg whites and fold them in, as well as sift the flour and will report back.

This is now possibly my favourite cake. It takes quite a bit of time and effort to make, BUT IT'S WORTH IT. I just recently went gluten-free and though I wasn't looking for a particularly gluten-free cake recipe (as this was for my grandmother's birthday), I was happy I came across this. I, too, like the other reviewer(s), used coconut oil instead of the canola oil and IT WAS SO FRAGRANT, ESPECIALLY when it came out of the oven. The best part was the tang from the lemon that contrasted so well with the light coconut flavour. The icing was quite sweet, but the cake was nice and moist. I had seconds and wish I had gotten thirds, fourths, fifths! WILL DEFINIELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN.

Rating: 4
Excellent cake. I substituted coconut oil for canola oil and it was wonderful! The touch of coconut flavor is a very nice compliment to the lemon. I used a different lemon curd recipe that called for whole eggs and no guar gum because I didn't have it. This was well liked by all dinner guests.

Success! Made the cake using all-purpose flour - omitted the brown rice flour mix and the xanthan gum. Amazing. I actually had lemon frosting leftover. Will make this again and again - love lemon!

Second attempt on this recipe - to overcome the density, I separated the eggs and whipped the whites before adding the other ingredients. I waited until the layers had passed the clean-toothpick test before removing them from the oven. But the layers still fell in the middle, making them virtually impossible to slice cleanly. I ended up with such a mess that I resorted to using a food ring to cut small cakes and I frosted those. Brown rice flour is gritty - period. I will make this delicious cake again, with cake flour.

Rating: 4
A winner every time. I use regular flour without problem. I always reduce the sugar slightly, and still it browns quite a bit. The homemade lemon curd and frosting are what make the cake. I, too, have trouble with melting frosting. Just keep the cake chilled until just before serving. Fresh raspberries are a perfect complement.

Rating: 3
I will try this recipe again because it tastes amazing - but I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with very dense and heavy cake that didn't rise evenly and had a slightly gritty toothfeel. (We lost electricity for close to 10 minutes about halfway through the baking time, so I am prepared to suspend judgment until I've tried again under ideal circumstances.) The curd and the frosting are both flawless, and the frosting recipe is ample enough to really frost the cake. Because I don't cook gluten-free, I did find it quite expensive to shop for this cake.

Delicious! If you are a lemon fan, you simply must try this cake. I made this for Easter with a few alterations, including substitutions to make it completely dairy-free. It is hands down the best cake I have ever eaten. I used cake flour in place of the brown-rice flour mix, did not use xanthan gum, and replaced the milk with almond milk. For the curd, I left out the guar gum and replaced the 1/4 cup unsalted butter with 1/4 cup Earth Balance Natural Buttery Sticks. I then frosted it with Luscious Lemon Frosting from Food.com. Next time I bake this - and there will be plenty of "next-times" - I am going to try and freeze a good part of it. All self-control goes out the window with this sitting in my refrigerator.

Way too complicated, very expensive ingredients, and not very fluffy. The curd is excellent, the icing is perfect. The cake itself? Not so much.

This cake was delicious and a hit with the kids and adults at a recent birthday party. I substituted the dairy ingredients for non-dairy options since one of the party goers was dairy intolerant, but otherwise followed this recipe to the letter. It turned out beautifully. My only grievance was that I found the cake to be a bit too "moist" - oily. I think substituting at least some of the oil for butter/margarine/Earth Balance might have prevented this. Even still, it's a great cake that is deserving of all of the rave reviews.

I made this cake using all-purpose flour and without any gum anywhere but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. This cake has the potential to be fabulous except that it is ridiculously sweet. I have no idea how to bring the sugar levels down without destroying the wonderful texture of the cake crumb. Based on what others have said, my only option would be to find a different, less sweet and lighter frosting. Maybe something mascarpone based with a minimum of sugar would do the trick.

Just an incredible cake recipe. I made this for a friend's birthday party, which had a tea party theme, and it was devoured. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! Everyone took home extra pieces, which was sad because I wasn't left with enough leftovers! The only change I made was the omission of xanthan gum, because I didn't have it. Otherwise, made as written. It IS time consuming, but worth it!

We are a gluten free and dairy free house due to my son's allergies. This can make baking quite complicated, however, this recipe is my new go to recipe. It was fantastic!

Wow. I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday and it was a HUGE hit. Just as everyone has said, if you didn't know it was gluten-free you'd never guess.... I doubled the lemon curd and used a lemon cream cheese frosting from another recipe instead of the buttercream. I also added a layer of fresh raspberries between the layers and put strawberries and raspberries on top. Great cake for spring/summer!!! And glad to know I can make a delicious gluten-free treat for those who can't usually partake in our office birthday celebrations.

I made the cake for my daughter's wedding shower last night. Following the advice of others I used 1/4 cup of Italian mineral water for a portion of the milk. Only had 2% milk, but it seemed ok. I did double the lemon curd and used it for the two middle layers. I used the frosting for the other lemon layer cake on this site. I added 1/2 cup of cream and that made the perfect amount. There were 3 ladies who were gluten intolerant, who were quite shocked that they could actually eat the cake. Rave reviews and there was fighting over the one remaining piece.

I think may be among the best cakes I've ever made and devoured. We used Meyer lemons straight off the tree, which added a freshness that mirrored the bright yellow curd--the epitome of spring!

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and substituted 1 cup of all-purpose flour and 1.5 cups of cake flour. I also left out the xanthan gum.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. They kept saying what a 'big cake' it was and indeed, after serving 9 portions, nearly half the cake was left! The slices looked gorgeous on the plate. Like many other readers, I eliminated the xanthan gum and guar gum, and used 2 cups of bleached white flour and 1/2 cup of cake flour and doubled the lemon curd recipe. I opted for the frosting from the Lemon Layer Cake with Lemon Cream Frosting, using 1 cup heavy cream, 1/2 cup confectioners sugar, and about 1/2 cup of the leftover lemon curd. Unless you are a very deft cake-froster, the frosting was a bit skimpy but frankly more frosting might make this cake overly rich. I'm curious to try the recipe with the brown rice flour, and hope to take that opportunity in the future.

Unbelievably good!!! I made this as a 3-tiered cake for my parents' 50th wedding anniversary and it looked and tasted wonderful (and got huge raves!). I had intended to do the recipe basically as-is, but I couldn't find brown rice flour anywhere in my parents' area, so I had to settle for regular white flour. The only thing I skipped was the xanthan gum in the cake mix and the guar gum in the lemon curd. The frosting was especially delicious!

I made this cake with AP flour and Alton Brown's lemon curd (didn't have the guar or xantham gums on hand) and it turned out fantastically. I had enough cake batter to make 3 8-inch cake rounds.

Made this lemon cake recipe with lemon curd frosting from "Lemon-Layer-Cake-with-Lemon-Cream-Frosting" on this website. Used white rice flour instead of brown rice flour. Simmered raspberry preserves with a handful of fresh raspberries and spread this between 2 layers of the cake. Used lemon curd frosting between other 2 layers. Decorated with fresh raspberries. Cake and frosting were incredible. My mom was pleased with her Mother's Day dessert!

This cake was nothing short of incredible. I'm always thrilled to find a gluten-free recipe and this one is outstanding - impossible to distinguish from a "regular" cake. I decorated it with blackberries and strawberries, everyone loved it and asked for seconds. Gorgeous texture, luscious flavour, and the lemon curd was delicious. I followed other reviews and didn't use guar gum, just cooked the curd for longer (stirring constantly) until it thickened. I also strained it. I made the curd a day ahead, chilled it overnight, brought it to room temperature before spreading the next day. I subbed almond milk and it worked fine, next time I will try the soda water trick (see other reviews). For the buttercream I ran out of confectioners sugar so I used half a cup less than called for and it was still very sweet (it's ok, it's a cake, it's supposed to be sweet :) so I will do the same next time. I used three 8-inch cake pans and it turned out great. I can't wait to make it again. Thank-you for such a gorgeous recipe!!

The only lemon cake recipe I'll ever need, this one hit the spot! I used cake flour in place of the other. The batter seemed runny, but it rose nicely. I baked in 3 layers for 25 min and they are beautiful and so delicious I could eat the cake plain and be happy. The edges are brown and sort of caramelized and the tops have a slight sugary crispness. Mmmm! Forgot to double the lemon curd as recommended and wished I had. For the frosting I used 1 stick of unsalted and 1/2 stick salted butter, the zest and juice of an entire lg lemon along with the lemon extract and a little vanilla, and added the powdered sugar until it was thick. It is absolutely delicious!!

Great gluten free recipe. The lemon flavor is light, but very refreshing. I took another reviewer's advice and used the lemon cream-cheese frosting from another recipe on this site. I know it's silly, but I love how people are substituting to make this recipe with wheat flour, when so often it's the other way around!

Thanks to everyone for their advice. I used 1.5 cups King Arthur white whole wheat flour and 1 cup King Arthur cake flour and the texture was great. I skipped the lemon curd and instead split the layers and filled each layer with cherry-plum jam and then used the delicious lemon frosting on top and sides of cake. This is just a luscious cake.

A superlative cake! I made it for the dessert dash at the school auction and it brought rave reviews (and a big donation). I followed the other reviewers' advice, used all-purpose flour, sifted, substituted 1/4 c soda water for 1/4 c of the milk, and omitted the xanthan and guar gum. I needed to double the recipe for the lemon curd, and used the extra for two mini tarts later. I also needed 1-1/2 recipes of the lemon frosting. Plan on a lot of lemons! You'll need two lemons for the cake for zest, two lemons for the curd (double recipe) for juice and zest, and 1-1/2 lemons for the frosting, zest and curd (for 1-1/2 recipe frosting). I decorated the cake using another lemon, very thinly sliced and patted dry between paper towels.

I made this cake for Thanksgiving because my daughter has a gluten allergy, and it was fantastic, receiving rave reviews from all the family members! Everyone was surprised that it was gluten-free since it was light and airy, without the usual "gluten-free" aftertaste. Because other reviewers disliked the lemon frosting from the original recipe, I substituted it with the lemon cream frosting from the "Lemon Layer Cake with Lemon Cream Frosting" recipe on the epicurious website. Be sure to use the epicurious recipe for lemon curd (click on the link from the recipe). I topped the cake with fresh fruit: raspberries, blueberries, strawberries, kiwi, and mango.

This was an absolute hit with my husband for his birthday cake and our neighbors who came over, but I made some major alterations to the recipe. He wanted an orange/chocolate combination and I didn't like the other orange cake recipes on Epicurious. So, I substituted orange wherever lemon was called. I added 1/2 cup Grand Marnier for 1/2 cup of the milk. For the lemon curd, I made orange curd, using equal parts orange juice and Grand Marnier. Instead of this frosting, I used the chocolate ganache from the Chocolate Ganache Cake recipe. I also used a high quality almond paste -rolled it out and added it in between the 3 layers of the cake on top of the orange curd. Time-consuming, but the end result was well worth it. Sophisticated, superb and satisfying!

Easy, delicious and rave reviews. I changed a few things: I made 3 layers (bake ~25 minutes), skipped this curd and frosting, and used the lemon meringue buttercream recipe from this site.

This really was delicious, and stayed moist for days. I made it into mini cupcakes. Bake time was about 10 minutes. You need to fill the cupcake wells a little more than 3/4 full as it doesn't rise a ton. I tried 2 toppings. The first was a lemon glaze which was refreshing. The second which was more popular with the mini cupcakes was a dollop of lemon curd topped with a small piece of candied lemon peel. Looks great and tastes fabu!

I made this cake with a mixture of all-purpose and cake flour, and it turned out great. My three-year-old had requested a lemon cake for her birthday party, and it was a definite hit. Very moist, light, and tangy. Next time I make it, I will double the recipe for lemon curd -- it was almost adequate, but a little skimpy. Same for the frosting -- next time I'll multiply it by 1.5. The lemon curd also requires straining for a smooth texture. Here are the changes I made this time: 1) instead of brown-rice flour, I used 1 c all-purpose flour plus 1.5 c cake flour 2) omitted xanthan gum 3) omitted guar gum 4) strained lemon curd 5) added up to 1 c more powdered sugar for frosting 6) increased lemon extract in frosting to 1 teaspoon and my plans for next time: 1) double the lemon curd recipe (although I might not use it all) 2) multiply lemon frosting recipe by 1.5 (although I might not use it all) 3) I might use a greater proportion of cake flour in the flour mixture

This cake was spectacular. Like many other reviewers, I used all-purpose flour and omitted the guar gum and xanthum gum.

I take back what I said before -- I must have done something wrong the first time -- the cake and lemon curd are great! Just omitted the guam like others suggested and used regular flour (sifted).

The lemon curd and frosting make this cake- my guest are still raving about this dessert! We have gluten and dairy allergies in the family so I always adapt recipes to meet their needs. For the cake layers I substituted 4 cups of 123 Gluten Free pound cake mix for the flour, salt, bkg pwdr, xgum & sugar. I followed anothers advice and used part soda water with Almond milk. I baked this mix in 9 inch pans. For the curd (and frosting) I substituted Earth Balance for the butter, and left it on the counter after it was cooked. I had no problems spreading it on the cake but it barely covers the cake. I made extra frosting (1&1/2) and had left overs.

I wish they would've noted in the title that this is a gluten-free cake. That way if people CAN eat gluten they would know they could easily modify it to be significantly more cost-effective. If you can eat gluten, just use all-purpose flour and omit the xanthan gum. For those of us who cannot have gluten--we're used to spending a gazillion dollars on baking supplies, so all of these ingredients are already in our pantry. This recipe is just one of dozens of amazing recipes that appears in the book Gluten-Free Baking Classics. Buy the book. Make the cake. You won't regret it!

IN SHORT: Excellent moist, fluffy cake with great flavor and texture. Delicious lemon curd. Overly sweet and heavy icing. CHANGES TO MAKE: 1) Replace 1/4 c. of the milk w/ soda water to give the cake more lift. I did this and it rose nicely. 2)Unless you like heavy, super-sweet icing, use a different icing recipe. The ratio of 2-sticks of butter to 3.5 c. powdered sugar ratio is excessive and makes for icing that melts too easily in warm weather. I will try a lighter butter cream, but add the zest and lemon from this recipe next time. 3) The guar gum isn't necessary for the lemon curd. You'll have to cook it longer (about 20 min. on low heat in heavy skillet or double boiler stirring constantly), but it will thicken enough without it. COOKING NOTES: If the curd is made in advance, let it come to room temp. before spreading. Otherwise it's too thick to spread. EXCELLENT BATTER IS SURELY GOOD FOR OTHER CAKES: A good choice whether you must bake gluten-free or not. I plan to try this batter in other recipes. I agree w/ others. It is the best GF cake I've made. This recipe owes some thanks to Bette Hagman, RIP. The wheat-free flour mix used is her exact GF baking mix.

To the cook from Mumbai: I've read that glucomannan flour can be substituted for xanthan gum. I wouldn't worry about the guar gum, though -- I don't know what it's doing in the lemon curd recipe anyway! I use a different curd recipe that's simple and fabulous. If you can't find xanthan or glucomannan, I can send you some xanthan. You shouldn't have to miss out on this great cake! caitlinette@yahoo.com is my email. Good luck.

I made this cake for our "Superbowl or Whatever Party" since hardly anyone among our pals likes macho food or football.Cake was a huge success even though it was a pain to make. The Xanthum Gum & Guar Gum are at Health Food stores in the baking section but the Xanthum Gum cost $12.75! Bought it anyway and also used the grainy Red Mill and Arrowhead Mills flour. Having cooked with Brown Rice flour before I really came to love the results and unusual texture. As much as we loved the cake there were basic problems in making it. 1. There wasn't possibly enough batter to fit in two 9 or 10 inch pans so I used two eight inch pans. 2.Cake barely rose maybe because of that dreaded phrase "mix only until just moistened". I can never quite know "should I leave all the dry lumps unblended????" 3. Cake was thin & extremely tricky to slice each layer in half even with my best MAC knife. 4.Lemon curd was sticky and VERY hard to spread once chilled. 5.Also 3 1/2 Cups of confectioners sugar unsifted makes for a grainy frosting. 5. While I was doing other things I let the whipped frosting stay in my KitchenAid bowl and it became a little "airy". 6. It was hard to spread on the cake in pretty swoops 7. and once again not exactly enough batter for my two 8" cakes! I decorated it with extra Meyer Lemon zest and stuck small round Nasturtium (edible) leaves around the sides and a few curled very thin lemon slices on top. It looked stunning! Guests have emailed and requested the recipe so I am sending them this site tho I got the recipe from my Gourmet magazine since the photo looked very appetizing. Despite the hassle I will make this cake again since no-wheat people love it as well as us wheat-eaters. Can't go wrong with that light , fluffy lemon flavor . Next time I will lessen the amount of sugar and try the less grainy version of Brown Rice flour.

In answer to the previous reviewer's question, yes, without xanthan gum you will likely have a crumbly mess. You should be able to find it in a health food store or online. If you're not allergic to wheat, you would be better off to use whole wheat pastry flour. Worth the trouble either way!

I made only a few changes: Like a previous reviewer, I used the three 8 inch pans -- the height is always impressive; I only sliced the center loaf in half for the icing; AND I covered the icing with coconut flakes...do not ask how good this was...

I made this cake only because a guest has celiac disease... but it was fabulous -- and I would make it again for any company. I substituted guar gum for the xanthan gum and it worked perfectly. Also, I made it in three 8 inch pans -- and just used the lemon curd between the three layers. The cake was tall and elegant and got rave reviews.

This cake was not only easy and fun to make, it has now replaced carrot cake as my husbands favorite dessert! I served it for Christmas and everyone was crazy about it and all asked for the recipe.

Wow - if you didn't know this was gluten free, you'd NEVER guess it. Even the wheat-eaters loved it. Texture was soft and light, and the curd and icing were quite good, although I found the buttercream a tad sweet. If you know someone who can't eat wheat, make this for dessert. Everyone at the table will thank you.

My mother has celiac (an allergy to wheat)and when I saw a recipe for gluten-free cake in Gourmet Magazine, I thought, this must be good!And I was right!!! My mom said it was the best gluten-free cake she's had. The only change I made was I did not slice the 2 cakes in half to make 4 layers. I just put the lemon curd between the 2 cake layers. The do-ahead factor is also great. I made the curd 2 days ahead and the cakes 1 day ahead and the cakes stayed very moist. If you know someone with an allergy to wheat, I urge you to make this cake...they will LOVE it!
