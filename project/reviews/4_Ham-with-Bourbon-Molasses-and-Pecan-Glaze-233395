Made this ham for Easter and it was incredible. Everyone, all 18 people, raved. We ate about half of the ham and planned another get together to eat the rest on homemade rolls. I've made a lot of hams in my life but this was the best one ever! Couldn't find fresh apple juice so just used plain bottled, still came out great.

Four forks for flavor on the glaze, but three forks for the directions. 425 was too hot for my spiral-sliced ham and curled/dried the first several slices to a ham-jerky texture. Next time I'll pay more attention and use a lower temp.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving to huge raves. This is literally the best glaze I've ever tasted. This is not only great for the ham out of the oven, but it's also wonderful on sandwiches later. As I'm writing this review, I'm making this again but increasing the glaze ratios (about 1.5 times larger) so I have plenty for leftovers. If you love a sweet glaze and pecans, you'll absolutely love this!

I have made this recipe for the past three years at the holidays and will be making it again this year. The crust that is created with the glaze is AMAZING. So easy to prepare, and delicious!

I didn't like it. My guests raved about it and the glaze but not me. I was disappointed that a $3.69/pd x 21 pound whole ham $77, was boring. Made it exactly as written with the following exceptions: Made 1.5 times as much glaze. Mine was 22 pounds. At 10 min per pound = 3 hrs 40 minutes to reach recipe 135. My butcher and many reviews suggested 15 or more = 5.5 hours. In 2 hours it was at 125?? Still 4 hours til dinner, I dropped the temp to 250 (2 Oven Thermometers) So at 3 hours it was 122? Bumped to 290 for an hour = 125? Oven temp was exact. Bumped it back to 325 and reached 135 in 5 hours. Applied room temp glaze at 425 and in 6 hours was 155 and glaze was starting to burn, pulled it out and carved in 30 minutes. Boring, perhaps 2 qts of juice. still red at bone. Next time I will cook two pork roasts.

This recipe is such a wonderful recipe. I made it last night for our dinner together with Crayfish and Prawn Salad with Butterbeans and Bass escalope with pine nuts and black olives that I discovered at www.gourmandia.com and www.wikichicken.com , the recipes in the site was really amazing take a glance at those site for more exciting and nutritious recipes. Have fun!!

There are a number of misleading elements to the cooking directions for this ham, which is very tasty in the end once one makes adjustments. First, the internal temperature noted of 130 - 135 degrees is far too low for the final result. Instead, it really refers AT BEST to the temperature at that stage of the cooking, that is, before the final cooking time listed and resting time. Second, the suggestion of 10 minutes a lb for a ham weighing 16 - 18 pounds is far too low. The time necessary to cook through to the bone is closer to 15 - 20 minutes a lb. Following the directions to the letter as written here will produce a seriously undercooked ham at the temperature listed. As for the chutney recipe suggested as an accompaniment, it is delicious. One can use clementines instead of tangerines and skip removing the membranes of each section.

This glaze was killer. Use it. Simple, sweet, perfect ham glaze. I added a Tbsp of maple syrup to mine.

My daughter-in-law was serving turkey and asked if I could bake a fresh ham. This recipe was a DISASTER. Maybe I should have used a smoked ham or soaked it in a brine for 1-2 days. It turned out exactly the same as a pork roast but it was absolutly tasteless the color of the meat was nothing like the photograph.

Wow, what a great ham! I try a different one every year for Easter, but I may have to stand pat on this recipe from now on, it was that good. I've never tasted a better glaze! The one change I would make next time is not to use a spiral-sliced ham -- I may just be imagining it, but it seems that it would dry out more than an uncut ham. Lining the pan with foil was a great tip, and I will remember it for next time. Even with the double layer the pan still needed to be washed, but cleanup was a snap compared to the sticky messes of previous years!

I doubled this recipe for our Christmas ham. At the time of application to the ham, it was great to have extra to pile on the ham and let it melt down the sides. The glaze was fantastic. It candied almost and the nuts and glaze stuck to your teeth at its thickest points. The flavor didn't sway to one ingredient or another, but was a nice mild sweet glaze. We will make this again for sure.

Delicious! I didn't have apple juice however so I substituted some orange juice and a couple of tblsp. of apricot passion fruit jam. I also used less brown sugar and because of a pecan alergy, just eliminated those. It was still the best glaze I've ever made.

WONDERFUL! I made the glaze first with the mustard, but I didn't like it at all, so I threw it out and made it again without the mustard. I also didn't have a clue what light molasses is, so I used Lyles Golden Syrup. Yum, yum.

It was good. But... It tasted more like a pork chop than a HAM. Anyone know how to make it nice and pink colored and sweet rather than pork choppy? I mean the part that was glazed was glazed, but thats just the crust, the rest was just ok...

I noticed that many people said this recipe took much longer to cook so I followed my butcher's advice and did 20 minutes per pound. My cooking time was 10 minutes per pound, just like the recipe said. Anyway, other than that, this was fantastic and quite the crowd pleaser. I ended up taking it out of the oven when it hit the desired internal temperature, I kept it covered until a half hour before serving, slathered it with glaze and put it back in for the final step of cooking the glaze. Turned out beautifully. This definitely will be my Easter staple going forward.

I used OJ and Apple Brandy (because that's what I had) and also had to sub quality maple syrup for the molasses. It was still easy and awesome! Will make again with the right ingredients soon-

We had this for Christmas dinner this year, and it was delicious. Luckily our time frame was flexible, because the time it took for our ham to reach 130 degrees was considerabley more than 10 minutes per pound, probably closer to 20 minutes. I served it with Potato gratin with white cheddar cheese, another or your recipes and it was a great success. Will definitely make it again.

Very good and fairly easy to prepare, minus applying the glaze paste which was a litlle difficult, but all was worth it. Used dark molasses and light brown sugar b/c that's what I had. Incidentally, the remaining glaze paste is fabulous to saute with greenbeans!

My ham was pre-cooked, so I wasn't able to let the glaze get to the hot bubbly stage - the ham would have dried out too much. But even though I basically just warmed up the ham with the glaze on it, the whole thing still tasted fabulous. It was everyone's favorite dish. Next time I'll get a ham I can cook properly and really give this recipe a fair test. I know it will be a winner! (Also, I didn't have light molasses so I subbed Lyle's Golden Syrup - worked great.)

Love the sauce on this recipe. Next time I'm going to make extra and same some on the stove top to add after the ham is sliced and on the plate!!!

We brought this to a Thanksgiving meal with the family. There was plenty of turkey left, but the ham was GONE! We've already gotten the ultimatum to bring it for Christmas. We'll have to make extra glaze though, everyone used the drippings instead of the gravy for their potatoes...:)

I made this glaze for my Christmas ham and it turned out well, despite my oven dying half-way through (yes on Christmas Day of all times!). I didn't eat any of the glazed part of the ham, but my guests who did raved about it! I can't wait to actually try it the next time I make it (when my new oven will hopefully not let me down!)

Best ham I've ever had...and much better than the usual clove spiked ham. Incredibly moist, delicious...if I knew ham could taste like that I would have made it sooner. My ham took much longer to reach 130 than 20 minutes per pound...more like 25 - 30 minutes per pound.

I made this ham for our family's Christmas Eve dinner and it turned out FABULOUS!!! The glaze was almost like candy. We did cheat and purchased a pre-cooked smoked spiral ham - cooked it according to directions and put the glaze on for the last 30 minutes of cooking. Just spooned it on and packed it in between the slices. Make sure to use foil in the bottom of the pan for easier clean-up. This will definitely be our newest family tradition - everyone is still talking about it!

Excellent - rave reviews at Thanksgiving. The only change made was substituting brandy for bourbon (brandy was at hand). The glaze turned into a wonderful crusty sweetness. It was thick, but did not have trouble putting it on the ham. Served with Cranberry Ginger Chutney from this site, which was another holiday winner and great w/ the leftovers. This was an easy fix because made the glaze the day before.

I have made this twice now and will make it many times again, although I generally cook my ham at a lower temperature. The glaze, however, is to die for. It provides a nice, sweet, complex flavor. I'm sure I will make this again and again.

It was my turn to host our family's Easter dinner, and I followed this recipe to the tee. Although I found the paste very thick and a bit difficult to work with (hard to "spread)...everyo ne LOVED the finished product. I think this is one of the best tasting glazes I've ever had and will most definitely try tweaking the recipe just a little to make the glaze a little easier to spread. But all in all, certainly a "keeper"...it will be demanded by the family next year...I think it's made me the official Easter dinner host for our family forevermore.

I made this recipe last night for my (semi)fussy inlaws using a smoked bone-in ham. By far, this deceptively simple recipe was the best glaze I have ever eaten! Rave reviews from around the table, too. Per an earlier suggestion, I rubbed the ham with some brown sugar ahead of the cooking process to help seal in the juices. I also found the paste to be a little thick; so I splashed in a little more apple juice and bourbon to get it to a spreadable stage. The ham came out with a beautiful dark color with a nice subtle coating of the crushed pecans. The reserved drippings were a favorite as a sauce / gravy over the ham slices, too. This one's going to be a keeper for our family!

This was delicious, and pretty easy (my favorite kind of recipe). The flavor of the glaze nicely permeated the meat, and despite overcooking it (up to a final temp of 170, instead of just 160), the meat was still really juicy. I'm sure I'll be making this same recipe for Christmas dinner next year too!

I made this ham today and served it for Easter dinner and my family loved it. I served it without the tangerine chutney because I was unable to get the jalapeno pepper jelly, but it was still fabulous. My brother who refuses to eat leftovers, packed himself a doggy bag. It even topped last year's recipe, BAKED HAM WITH MUSTARD-RED CURRANT GLAZE AND RHUBARB CHUTNEY, which was fantastic too. I would most definitely make this again!

What an absolutely amazing ham for Easter. I bought a half of a spiral sliced ham so I didn't cut the diamond pattern into the ham. I had trouble getting the glaze to stick so I ended up dumping all of the glaze over the ham at once, and then smearing it in quickly. Even with the pan completely lined with aluminum foil the glaze made quite a mess, I ended up deglazing the pan to clean it up.

I purchased a 8+ lb precooked spiral sliced ham from Sam's Club and warmed it as directed on the package, which took about 1 hour and 10 minutes. I then made the Bourbon, Molasses and Pecan glaze without diviation from the recipe and hand-packed it on the ham; I retunred the ham to the oven for another 45 minutes at 425 degrees as stated in the recipe. WOW! Not only did the ham look beautiful, but everyone raved about it. I have to say, the glaze makes all the difference in world. I will definitely be making this recipe again using the precooked spiral sliced ham. I saved the leftover glaze in the freezer, as I think this will be good on other cuts of pork and maybe even on Salmon.

I made this glaze for our 9lb christmas ham yesterday. It was up against a jambalaya stuffed Turduckin. The ham won the contest by a huge margin. I had 14 people and all said the ham was welcome at our table next year but Turduckin was politely uninvited. I served with the tangerine chutney. It was a wonderful accompaniement. I prepared the ham as per the recipe. It came out perfect. The chutney I substituted fresh florida oranges (undrained)my mom brought home with her and omited the zest. delicious.

Rating: 4
The taste was WONDERFUL - even my Mom, who is a huge fan of Honey Baked Ham, agreed that this beat Honey Baked Ham hands-down! The only problem - I did a 9 lb ham and it took almost 3 hours at 325 (following other reviewers' advice to not up the heat to 425). In desperation, we DID crank the heat to 425 for the last half hour and still barely came in at the safe temperature (and the glaze got very crusty, but still delicious). The ham was delicious, but next time I will follow the ham's printed package guidelines and count on 20 mins. per lb. at 325. If I had done a 16 lb ham as the recipe calls for, I think we'd still be waiting! (PS the 9 lb ham still used the entire glaze).

Made this for Easter Sunday and by so doing bucked the family tradition of eating a HoneyBaked Ham. This was infinitely superior and while it was a little more work, it was completely worth the effort.

Made this for Easter and it was sooo good. I took reviewers suggestions and roasted the ham with the glaze at 350 - perfect. The thickness of the glaze is dependent on how much you reduce the bourbon and apple juice. I placed the leftovers in a ziplock and added the juice that was a the bottom of the roasting pan. I defatted it first. Fabulous. I made a 9# bone-in half ham and it took longer than 10 minutes/pound to reach 130.

Served the Ham for 8 theater buddies last nite-rave reviews! I would never do the Tangerine chutney again-ever-too spicy, and labor-intensive. Just plain nasty. The Buttermilk Spoon bread was light & delicious-may grate a little parmesan in next time. Not a bite of that left, either!

I had 80 guests for dinner last night as a surprise 40th birthday party for my husband. I served this and every person asked for the recipe. It was so fantastic. I made the glaze the day before and let it sit in the fridge to blend the flavors further. I left the juices of the ham in the pan when I added the glaze & I also let it rest for 30 mins before carving. Serve the glaze as a "gravy" with creamy mashed potatoes & you will have very happy dinner guests. Great cold leftovers too!

I made this ham twice over the holidays and it was a big hit both times. I used a heavy hand with both the bourbon and pecans, and on the second try I roasted the ham with pineapple slices prior to glazing, which gave it a nice, acidic layer of flavoring.

Rating: 2
Followed suggestions to bake the glaze at a lower temp (325) and had no problem with smoking. Much of the glaze slid off the ham and was wasted in the pan. The molasses flavor was dominant and masked the flavor of the bourbon. That being said, we did enjoy the ham---I just don't think this recipe has any edge over simpler glazes.

Really good ham,we usually have the ham done with pineapple every christmas,this year I decided to go diffrent,and this was a pleasant addition to the table.The tangerine chutney was delicious.I couldn't find the molasses called for so I used a thicker one but less of the required amount. Reallly nice ham.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner. This was my first attempt at baking my own ham verses purchasing a spiral cut glazed ham. The crust of the ham got a little burnt and I would recommend cooking it a little shorter or using a probe thermometer with an alarm. After scraping away the burnt fat on the top, I continued with the glaze and baked for 20 minutes instead of 30. The end result was absolutely delicious and all my guests raved! It was even better the next day!

The ham was excellent (mine was just under 9 pounds) and I used the whole glaze recipe. The foil saved me from hating the mess the melting glaze made. The chutney was outstanding.

I cooked this for Christmas dinner with rest of menu from Dec. magazine. The ham didn't get done and had to raise temp. to 400 and cook it an hour longer;it really could have used even more time. Put it in oven next day and cooked for 2 more hours. It still was not tender.

Very good! I had to leave out the pecans (husband has nut allergy).Made it for family Christmas dinner and the whole family loved it and my mother-in-law asked me to make the glaze for her newyears eve party : ) The tangerine chutney was delicious too and colorwise looked beautiful on the holiday table. Agree with a previous reviewer that a lower oven setting for the glazing part is better. I had no choice as I was roasting a goose side-by-side with the ham at 350 degrees. And even at this lower setting I had to pull the ham way before the prescribe time because it started to smoke. It was done and I think that a longer time and a higher setting would have just burned the glaze and dried out the ham.

I made this ham for an early family Christmas dinner last weekend. I was given a beautiful organic farm raised & smoked ham as a gift & wanted to do it justice..thought this just might be the recipe. While the glaze was tasty it was a mess! MAKE SURE YOU USE FOIL! Making the glaze adhere to the hot ham was a challenge. Glop it on thick (my ham weighed 8 lbs & I used a full recipe) As it cooks the glaze melts all over the place & smokes like crazy! I would NOT use a 425 oven, more like 375 would be just fine. The chutney on the other hand was the perfect accompliment. Segmenting & seeding the tangerines was a challenge but worth it. If I were to make this again I would not do the glaze, (can't beat the old fashioned brown sugar & mustard) there are others that would be just as good...definitely do the chutney...great for left over ham sandwiches.

For the cook from greece: the ham you are seeing for sale is precooked; it's not the same as used for a roast such as this. I sneak mine into the country from England :) but you could probably look into someone shipping mail-order from England or even the US if they are willing to express ship to you overnight. It won't be cheap though.

Rating: 0
to the person in greece, yes there is more involved than just a leg of pork. ham is usually the upper leg of the pig, that has been brined and then slow smoked, the bringing you could do yorself but smoking is very tricky, i would definately not try that yourself. depending on the kind of ham you buy it can be either ready to eat, or needs to be cooked through, the one for this recipe needs to be cooked through, so those silly little grocery store black forest hams wont work. there are dozens of different types of ham available, some are seasoned, some are more smokey. the one you pick really depends on your tastes. hope this helps

I just have a question... What exactly is a ham? we live outside of the states and what they sell as "ham" is only luncheon meat. Can I just get a butcher to cut a leg of pork with the bone in and then is there some process, salting,etc that we can do to turn it into a ham?

Rating: 4
Wonderful glaze. Very simple and the best part is the fact that out of a fifth of bourbon only 2 ounces are required for the recipe and the remaining 23.4 ounces can be immediately consumed while waiting for the ham to complete the cooking process.
