What a wonderful recipe. Morels are one of the most delicious mushrooms ever. At lifegourmetshop.com You can find them at great prices!

This is simply fantastic. So easy, elegant, and decadent! If you have access to fresh morels, this is a fantastic preparation. I might consider serving it over fresh pasta or gnocchi next time. I finished it off with truffle salt. To die for!

I tried this recipe with a mixture of fresh morels and fresh spike mushrooms. I didn't have heavy cream on hand, so I used whole milk. Delicious!

Used dried morels. Big mistake. Like eating leather. Also, made mistake of adding salt before the end of cooking. Cream also vanished. Would next time double cream, use assortment of wild mushrooms, and very little salt (which is absorbed by the mushrooms) as well as doubling the flour for the roux.

Treat yourself to fresh morels and pour this over a simple, perfectly cooked omelette- fabulous!

Man! Why have I waited 37 years to try morels? Got a jar of dried from a friend months ago and finally tried this recipe. I used plain yogurt instead of the cream, poured it all over one huge piece of sourdough toast and ate the entire recipe to myself.

YUM!!! I added a handful of chopped fresh herbs at the end, and a little more cream. Served with toasted challah. With or without the herbs, these are the bomb!

YUM!!!! I added a small handful of fresh chopped herbs at the end, but I don't think it really added anything. These are great with or without the addition. I used toasted challah.

Made this two days in a row. What's not to like about morels, butter, and cream? We had picked a couple of pounds of morels, and liked this dish so much the first day we made it again with the rest. Did make a change by using toasted, crusty rustic Italian rolls.

I dont know whether to give the credit to the recipe or to the morels. My husband went crazy when he tried it, it was absolutely delicious. I used fresh morels, I think that fresh morels would make anything taste great. You cant go wrong with this recipe though. We are addicted to morels now, an expensive habit, beware.
