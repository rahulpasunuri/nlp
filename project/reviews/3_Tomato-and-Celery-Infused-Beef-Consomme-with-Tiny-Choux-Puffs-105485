The eggs cook long enough to kill any possible bacteria. The consomme is heated to above 160 degrees anyway. This classic technique is used in almost every restaurant in the world. If it were unsafe, they wouldn't do it. The CIA says that you should be able to see a dime at the bottom of a gallon of this consomme, if not, you didn't do it right.

I've used shells & whites to clarify also. It isn't a bad idea to wash with "light anti-bio soap and rinse immediately" if it'll get the guy to do use the technique, plus I buy organic eggs and I have seen "brown stuff" I'd prefer to wash off, a quickie isn't going to leave anything in the shells.

this is a classic prep technique. However, it is not necessary to use antibacterial soap on eggs, the shell are very porous and the taste of the soap may absorb into the egg. As the broth is simmered for quite a while any bacteria on the surface of the egg would be killed anyways.

A consomme is the perfect soup to start a meal with, it is light an elegant. Don't let the eggs in the recipe discourage you. This is the traditional french method to clearify broths. Just remember NOT to boil soup after clearing the soup. Try adding Red Pepper that has been peeled, chopped, and simmered in some broth. Also, try adding tomato paste mixed with paprika.

To Bob:thewriteguy: Yes, I've made this and probably 20 variations. It's the "classic" method for clarifying any stocks for impurities. I would suggest cleaning the eggs before cracking them with a very light antibacterial soap solution and rinsing them well. Also, although I can't access the pate choux recipe for "tiny puff balls", I would also suggest cooking the flour mixture until it pulls completely from the sides of the pan while stirring, thus ensuringthe flour is fully cooked.Then, incorporate the eggs. Time-consuming, yes, but well worth the effort!

This sounded interesting so when I clicked in, I was shocked to see the recipe required egg whites and their SHELLS! This sounds so gross and absolutely revolting! Has anybody tried this? If so I'd be very interested to read your review. Thanks.
