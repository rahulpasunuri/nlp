I took this to a foody party and it was a big hit. The hummus was perfect. Presentation was great with the broccoli standing in the middle surrounded by the chokes and then breen beans. I skipped the potatoes. Everybody asked me for the recipe. Only reservation was the time designated to cook the vegetables. I would cut time down substantially to make them al dente. I will definitely make this again.

The vegetable combination and presentation was wonderful, however, the "hummus" dip did not go over well. Would not make it again.

I actually gave this recipe to my sister-in-law to bring to a party (She asked for an "assignment") so I did not actually do the work. However, the dip was wonderful and the presentation of vegetable was beautiful. Nice recipe, and I look forward to making it myself!

Excellent hummus. The fresh thyme really makes it. Smooth and creamy, great for guests...make sure it's chilled, which enhances the flavor.

Very tasty and easy to make. I like the addition of thyme which makes this a little different than your traditional hummus. I added some radishes and cherry tomatoes to the platter for more color.
