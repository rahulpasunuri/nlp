It was okay for one time only--no one really cared for it. I thought it had an odd flavor. Would not make again.

Excellent. Served with Cilantro Coconut Rice and Chickpea Salad with Parsley, Lemon and Sun-Dried Tomatoes - both from this site. Teens and adults loved this. Made with chicken and the result was great. Apricot relish was yummy. Tossed everything in the food processor making it quick and easy. A definite keeper.

Wow, wow, wow! I probably average 2 new Epicurious recipes a week and this is the very best thing I have found on this site (and my first review). It is just fantastic. I served it with the chickpea-cucumber-sundried tomato salad recipe from this site and my husband and I both agreed it was the best meal I've made. Wonderful.

Wow! This recipe turned out even better than I expected! The glaze was amazing and everyone loved the apricot relish. I even put some of the extra glaze on the side to use as a dipping sauce. It had great flvor, Highly recommend!!!

Fantanstic. Served with or without the apricot relish. We have used the tamarind glaze on several different meats - ribs, beef tenderloin, pork - and it works on it all.
