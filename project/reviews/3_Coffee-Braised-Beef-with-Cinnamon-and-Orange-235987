I used a rump roast instead of chuck, and it turned out to be quite dry. Next time I'll brown the outside first before I put it in the oven to braise. The flavors were great though.

I must have made this recipe about a dozen times and it's been an absolute winner since day one! The meat comes out fork-tender and the infusion of all the ingredients is definitely a delight on the palette! I've even made this in the slow-cooker a couple times with also a great outcome. Love it!

This was incredible, easily one of the best recipes I've gotten from epicurious. I used a 4.5 lb roast (shoulder I think), and cooked it for about 3.5 hours. Since the cut was slightly larger than the recipe called for, I doubled the other ingredients (except onion). The liquid was about halfway up the meat when I put it in the oven and there was still plenty left to make a great sauce afterward. I also marinated the meat overnight in Worcestershire, onion, garlic, etc. It was falling-apart tender, and everyone who ate it loved the flavor combos. This is now my "go to" roast.

Wouldn't recommend it at all. I was really looking fwd to the outcome, as the flavour combination was very promising, and was reaaly dissapointed. I used a 1kg chuck (Scottish), which I cooked for almost 3 hs, and it was still not tender at all. The sauce separated into two faces, even when hot, you were able to see the olive oil drops floating on top of the black, coffee-based liquid sauce (not appealing at all) Flavorwise it was interesting (I marinated it overnight), but that was all, horrible texture and worse appearence

There is something wrong with this recipe. There is no liquid left when you are done braising and the meat is very dry. No one at my table liked it unfortunately :@

Excellent combination of flavors, with rich beef taste gently supported by orange and spice. Patience will deliver fork-tender beef; I flipped the meat every hour. A great recipe to try if you feel you're a one-trick Brasato pony.

Tasted like a regular stew; nothing special.

Although I didn't taste the orange and cinnamon flavors very strongly, this was an easy easy recipe that everyone loved, including my picky kids. Great for a party when you've got a lot of other stuff to do and need to feed a lot of people.

This was okay, but not anything special. My meat didn't absorb the flavors and it was dry because it cooked too quickly. Wouldn't make it again.

I followed the recipe exactly- A very interesting combo of flavors that we loved- and it makes the house smell great.

We liked it so much it's become the 'sunday roast'! I cut the meat into large chunks to speed things up a little bit when we're in a hurry.

I marinate the roast in the sauce overnight then when cooked created a new sauce to eliminate the problem of the meat not absorbing the flavors and it was wonderful and my kids want me to cook the christmas roast this way. It was wonderful.

This was delicious. The reason for cooking the meat so long after it is "done" is to make it tender. It will be quite tough and not flavored if you just cook it until it's no longer pink.

I thought this recipe was easy, inexpensive, and delicious. I had 15 people for dinner and tripled the recipe (all 3 roasts fit in my large pot). Everyone raved about it and it couldn't have been easier since it is not necessary to brown the meat first.

This was not a good recipe - the beef cooked too fast, and did not absorb the flavor of the cinnamon and orange like I felt it should have. I wouldn't recommend this to others.

My beef cooked much faster and I thought it was rather bland. Won't make again.
