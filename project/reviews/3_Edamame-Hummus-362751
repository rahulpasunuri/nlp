Made the recipe as written... but it really needed a lot of help in the flavor department. Ended up using alot of pink peppercorns to the mix. My company said they liked it, but I'll stick to traditional chickpeas.

Made this exactly as written..and based on other reviews, I doubled the tahini, the lemon juice and I still found it sort of bland...so I added 2 Tblsp of crush garlic. It was soooo yummy!

I made this exactly as written and it came out great! I am taking it to my sister's house for an appetizer before Thanksgiving. It is going to be a big hit I am sure.

What an awsome recipe. The edamame and sesame paste made this a nuttier flavor combo than the chickpeas have. My husband ate almost all of this dip when I made it for a BBQ. This recipe is a keeper!

I love edamame hummus, but as written, this recipe is pretty bland. You need about 2x the tahini and bit more lemon juice. I also added about 1 tsp of wasabi powder that made a really big impact on the flavor.

This was super quick and easy to make, and came out really well. I did use a 16oz bag of edamame though, which worked fine. I also used garlic oil instead of regular olive oil, and it gave it a slightly stronger taste. I made it for a class project on healthy foods, but my family tasted it and wanted me to leave some behind! It is really good.

While this recipe was simple to execute, it lacked in taste. I even added a roasted poblano pepper and still nothing. It is healthy, but healthy food should still taste good. I think we'll stick with chickpeas for hummus. I make a red pepper hummus that is really tasty.
