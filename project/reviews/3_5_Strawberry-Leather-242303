made some yesterday and loved it, although agree that less sugar would work best. As a Mexican I love candy and fruit with chili powder, so I added some and it tastes great!!

so awesome! a great treat. I used fresh strawberries that i picked and this came out awesome. I followed the recipe but since i only had 4 cups of strawberries, i used 2/3 cups of sugar. the time in the recipe was fine for me though and i ended up keeping it in the oven for 3 hrs. now im going to experiment with other fruits!

Agreed that less sugar shouldn't be a problem. And I also had to cook longer on the stove and in the oven. Delicious, nonetheless.

this recipe was so easy, and the fruit leather tasted amazing! i am going to experiment and try to make it with less sugar, though, especially while fresh strawberries are in season. also, i ended up cooking the strawberries longer (on the stove and in the oven) than the recipe said to.
