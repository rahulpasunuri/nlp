Very good weeknight dish. I did add some chicken broth to prevent dryness but other than that stuck to the recipe. I've made a recipe similar to this one in the past, but I really liked the inclusion of pine nuts in this one. I will definitely make this again.

I recipe was good with a little tweaking. I followed the suggestion from other cooks to double the sauce amount and by doing so it was perfect for 3/4lb linguine pasta. I added about 1/4 cup white wine to the shallots after they sauted. I allowed the wine to come to a boil then added the cream and allowed the mixture to boil again. The rest was made as stated. It turned out very nice and I will not hesitate to make this recipe again, as it is a quick, easy and tasty main course for dinner.

This was quite good. I cut out the olive oil, added basil and chopped leftover ham to the final sauce, and served over cheese tortellini. Very easy weeknight meal.

Cooks who think the recipe is too rich or too dry should consider using the standard pasta cooking technique of saving about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water and using as much as is needed to thin the sauce before adding the pasta. It works.

I keep sliced pancetta in the freezer so used that instead of bacon. Didn't have a shallot so used a 1/4 cup of vidalia onion. Put the sauce over store bought cheese ravioli and it was a great week night side dish. I finished it off with a sprinkle of sea salt. Paired it with the Sicilian Grill-Roasted Chicken but grilled pieces not whole chicken...all quick easy and family loved it.

Have been making this for years. Always quick and yummy. To prevent dryness, don't boil down the cream as much.

This was ok...I didn't have shallots on hand so I used garlic...that may have made the difference. I will make it again with the shallots and see how it turns out. I had to double the sauce because otherwise it wouldn't have been enough...serve with plenty of freshly grated Parmiggiano...the real stuff not the stuff out of the green can!

This was EASY and good, but I did alter it a tad. Cut the olive oil out (why would you use it with fatty bacon anyway?) and then reduced whipping cream to 1/3 cup and ADDED 1/3 cup of chicken broth. At first seems saucy, but in min. after adding the cheese at end, the pasta absorbs all the liquid. Thus this wasn't dry at all. Good one to make quickly after coming home from work.

This had a nice flavor but was EXTREMELY dry! Make sure to double or triple the sauce.

Simple and tasty. I added skim milk to make more sauce without adding more calories.

Excellent blend of flavors and easy to make. I would also increase the amount of cream in the recipe. I added a pound of large shrimp when frying the bacon.

A wonderful mixture of flavors and textures.

Did not like this at all. Used hickory bacon but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Quite good. I will make again, but will double the sauce, as it was on the dry side.

This dish is wonderfully tasty, I added some sauteed bell peppers and the flavors went together very well.

This pasta dish is a good one. It is very rich (not to be used as a side). I doubled the recipe for the sauce as recommended and am glad that I did, otherwise it would have been too dry. Add mushrooms and/or chicken for an even heartier meal!

This recipe has become a favorite at the fire station, our cook has dressed it up a little, adding julienned red and yellow peppers, mushrooms, scalions and chopped chicken breast that is first cooked on the grill and doubling the heavy cream. It is so popular that many fireman are bringing the recipe home and making it at family dinners and gatherings and getting rave reviews.

This is unbelievable good particularly when considering the limited preparation effort! We've prepared this several times.

With all the rave reviews, I was enthusiastic to make this recipe, however, was sorely disappointed. It borders on being average, tasty enough, but certainly nothing memorable. There are many other recipes in the Gourmet database that are far superior!

For something so simple, this recipe was exceptional! As I always have sun dried tomatoes and bacon in the house, this could turn into an easy "What to have for dinner (and I need it now)" recipe.

This is an excellent sauce. Very tasty, creamy and rich. The bacon, sun-dried tomatoes and cream combine to make a very luxurious taste for the palate.

This dish has become a favorite! I substitute half-and-half for the cream and add an extra 2/3 cup of it. Toasted almond slivers work just as well as pine nuts. Combine the leftover pasta and sauce to microwave the next day for lunch.

This is so delicious! I highly suggest tripling the sauce. It rivals any good pasta dish you will find in a restaurant, and it is relatively easy. Be forwarned: Very rich, very fattening, but so worth it!

I doubled the sauce, and added some chopped grilled & peeled red peppers. It was yummy. How could it not be!

I also doubled the sauce and used hickory smoked bacon. Love this recipe just wish I could make it as well without the cream! Tried yogurt and it was no where near as good!

I agree that there wasn't enough sauce. I added cubed chicken to the recipe and thought the dish turned out well.

The ingredients go very well together however it was not enough sauce for 8 oz. of fresh linguine. My family found it quite dry. It did however,look great! I will add more cream next time. The aroma was wonderful.

It was not what I expected. I liked it, my husband did not. So, of course, if he does not like it, it does not get made again.
