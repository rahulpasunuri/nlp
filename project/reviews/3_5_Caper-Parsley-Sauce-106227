Made this to go over fresh tuna fish cakes (tuna was on sale) and it was excellent. I have anchovy paste in a tube so used about 1 1/2" of paste. Put this on hard boiled eggs today for breakfast. Can see using it on steamed vegetables to perk them up.

Excellent with the fish cakes. Used four anchovy fillets versus six. Would also serve a tarter-like sauce too.

Very good sauce. It's much better if left for a day in the fridge for the flavors to meld. I doubled the garlic and skimped a bit on the olive oil.

I had to do a lot of juggling with the proportions to keep from being to tart. I served homemade tartar sauce on the side and that was just as popular although surely not as healthy.

The sauce was great with the halibut cakes, and I caught one guest scraping out the sauce at the bottom of the dish and eating it straight. I used freshly marinated anchovies instead of canned, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing.

while my dinner guests enjoyed this sauce served witht the halibut cakes i thought the sauce was too tart - and i am usually a big fan of lemon! i tried adding more olive oil to soften the flavour but still did not like it. i would use a good home made tartar sauce instead.

I made this sauce for the fish cakes and it was just delicious! My husband just loved the way this sauce compliments the great "mild" taste of the fish cakes. I wouldn't change a thing. I will try our leftover sauce tomorrow with pasta as some reviewers suggested.

I made this with the fish cakes. The flavor was perfect with them. A little goes a long way. I love something tart and fresh with a savory main course.

This recipe is fairly tart, but I wouldn't change a thing. We had leftover sauce on top of eggs this morning. Really good.

This is a delicious sauce. I tried it first with the fish cakes and then leftovers on sandwiches. Yum. Also great on pasta

I made this exactly to the recipe and was pleased with the result. Next time I would only use 4 anchovies as the flavor is slightly pronounced. I used it over poached salmon and was very pleased. I can not see using with beef as I believe the header suggests, only seafood.
