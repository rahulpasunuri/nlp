This is a favorite at our house. Don't understand everyone wanting to leave out the zucchini and squash--that's the recipe and the reason I like to make it often in the summer to use up home-grown harvest. The only changes I make are to make two pizzas since it makes a lot of topping, so I adjust the bbq sauce accordingly and add a little extra cheese and of course, cilantro. More, please!

This was incredibly good and so easy to make. I didn't use the cilantro because I didn't have any on hand.

Excellent! Tried with a little variation to suit our taste. Would like to have it again.

I was looking for a chicken pizza receipe and saw the great reviews for this one. It sounded so good. We love BBQ chicken, love pizza and love blue cheese (which I added based upon reviewer suggestions). While it looked nice, the taste combination just wasn't for us.

My boyfriend and I loved this. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and added cheddar and a little bleu cheese. The topping is VERY substantial, but delicious!

My and I loved this! Very easy to make. I took the advice of other reviewers and added cheddar and bleu cheese on top. Also used spicy BBQ sauce. There is a LOT of topping on it, but I think it's delicious.

This is a great recipe if you make a few modifications. I'd recommend omitting the squash and substituting spinach or more zucchini. Also, I like to use half cheddar and half mozarella for the cheese that is called for. Overall a great recipe and one that I will make frequently because it is quick and delicious.

My husband raved about this one! I made these individual pizzas by putting them on pita bread. The pita got nice and crisp -- and the single servings were much easier to handle. Definitely easy to make!

I just wanted to add one twist to this recipe that i've been doing for some reason every time i make it, and it just adds a little something different. Try this recipe with a handful of Feta cheese over the mozerella and other toppings. You could also try bleu cheese instead of Feta if a stronger flavor is what you like. On anouther note, i only use cilantro and RED onions with no other vegtables.

This was a quick, easy recipe that resulted in a "wow" pizza! I used a couple handfulls of spinach instead of the squash and used leftover grilled (and marinated) chicken from the night before. I definitely would not skip the cilantro if you are a fan of cilantro. This really is the featured ingredient in this pizza. The more the better!!

I'm a huge BBQ chicken pizza fan and I liked the addition of the zucchinni to this one. I did make a few changes though - I coated the chicken with BBQ sauce and broiled it on both sides and I added jalapenos for a kick. I recommend Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce - it is great

I would make this again with some modifications, as I felt it turned out too sweet. Used a large zucchini and a small Mexican squash (couldn't find crookneck). Used a 12" Mia pizza crust, and added about 1/3 of a chopped green bell pepper and a few minced garlic cloves to the skillet when sauteing the onion. Put about 5 Tbs. BBQ sauce on the crust (did not drizzle any over the top of the pie). Totally forgot the cilantro. They ought to call this a veggie pizza, since both the chicken and cheese flavors were lost. If I make this again, I would cut the amount of both the BBQ sauce and squash by about 25%. If you want a veggie pizza, skip the chicken!!! I think I will try subbing picante for the BBQ sauce in the future.

This pizza was awesome. I omitted the chicken and took someone's advice and added carmelized onions, as well as mushrooms and red bell peppers.

This pizza was so easy to make and so delicious. I followed the advice of other reviewers and eliminated the squash, carmelized a cup of sliced red onion and it was perfect. My husband doesn't normally like bbq chicken pizza but he said this was the best pizza he has ever had! I can't wait to make it again.

I was lucky to get one slice left!! Eliminated the squash and served with a salad instead - Can't beat this for an easy and delicious quick weeknight meal.

I've never liked the idea of barbecue chicken pizza, but for some reason this appealed to me today. Maybe it was all of the good reviews, maybe it was the rain. It just sounded good, so I made it - sort of. I omitted the squash ingredients because my husband doesn't like these, and I just didn't feel like dealing with them. I omitted the cilantro, because I forgot to get some at the store and had none left at home - only an unpleasant mush of what was once a bunch of cilantro. I added some mushrooms and a couple cloves of garlic. I also roasted the boneless chicken breasts halves with worcestershire for chicken and few other seasonings thrown in for good measure, then chopped the roasted chicken into cubes. The result was fabulous! The barbecue taste was subtle and added a bit of sweetness. I actually used a tablespoon more than called for in the recipe. The sauce was K.C. Masterpiece Hickory. Very easy dish and very tastey. I will certainly make this again, next time adding the cilantro.

great zah, thanks for the laugh, France, it's so true that we take ourselves too seriously. I used Deluca's crust and Diana Sauce BBQ and omitted the squash and added asparagus and green as well as red onions. What a treat. Thanks, H.

I just can't stand it when everyone else loves something and I don't, I always wonder if I'm missing something. I think the key with this one is barbecue sauce - I'm just not a big fan. If you don't like barbecue sauce I suggest you skip this one.

This is a staple in my house. I don't like Boboli (not judging), so I do use homemade crust (we usually have some dough stashed in the freezer for lazy nights). If we have homemade sauce, we use it. If not, we use the bottled stuff. I omit the squash because we prefer this to be as quick and easy as possible. And, frankly, I think it's kind of gross with the sauce.

This is my standby weeknight dinner, except that I'd usually do either veggies or chicken, probably not both on the same pie. And what's with the cilantro in EVERYTHING? For those who can't stand cilantro, lemon basil makes a nice substitute if you can get it; otherwise, chopped fresh flat parsley gives a nice "green" flavor without the yucky cilantro-ness. Obviously you can substitute whatever herbs you like but I have had good results with those 2 working well in recipes that call for cilantro.

To the reviewer who asked about removing a negative post, I think if you look back, the original poster thanked someone for defending him. He(she?) made reference to fresh store-bought ravioli being world's away from Boboli. This site only lets you post once.... Anyway, pretty good recipe and certainly easy for a weeknight dinner!

Hey, who took the nasty comments off? The review from CA on 1/9 is not on the site. In any case, I have to say this recipe was great. I can go from fine dining to the ocassional Big Mac (don't flip out- I work out like an animal so I burn it right off). In any case, I don't think reviewers need to poo poo the use of ready made items in recipes. Expand your horizons for God's sake. I make many things from scratch, but sometimes I want a quick recipe. There is nothing wrong with that! Amen!

I don't usually modify these recipes when making for the first time unless there is some general consensus in the reviews that warrants adjustment, but I did make soem changes to this one in the interest of convenience. I used a grocery prepared rotisserie chicken breast chopped up and a ready made "Pub Style" crust. I also left the squash out and carmelized some red onion instead. It ws delicious! I've made it as an appetizer for a dinner party, as well, to rave reviews!

My husband likes the BBQ chicken pizza served at Sidney's in Saint Paul. I wasn't sure about it. Made our own crust, piled the fixin's on the raw shell, baked it on a preheated 450? pizza stone for 15 minutes. Oh, yes! His critique: "tastes like Sidney's but better." I'm a convert.

Loved this pizza! I bought the refrigerated pizza dough (pillsbury) and made my own thin crust pizza. Also, replaced the squash with sauteed red onions. I turned on the broiler at the very end to get the cheese golden and bubbly. Watch it though, the crust burns easily.

This admission will probably send some people into orbit, but I used a Pillsbury Pizza Crust. Left off the veggies, carmelized the onions. I was really pretty happy with the outcome!

I agree about ditching the vegetables. I used a pre-cooked Safeway chicken and a Boboli. Also, carmelize those onions. . .makes it perfect!

HEY! Someone stole my recipe! I've been making this for my husband for the 8 years we've been married. Boboli included. I wound up ditching the zuchinni and squash as I discovered I don't like it on pizza. Use Red onions and added garlic. Now my kids love it. Talk about fast and easy. I use the Tony Roma's BBQ sauce when I can find it. (I can only seem to find it in costco on occasion) If I'm feeling like making a "gourmet" version on a weekend, I'll make my own crust (in my bread machine shhhhh.) and use fresh mozzerella. Yum yum yum!

To A Cook from SF-Thanks for speaking up, fresh ravioli (albiet storebought) is WORLDS away from boboli. I'll bet you've NEVER bought a boboli.

To Cook From CA on 1/9: your remarks were not only rude, they were an invalid argument. You cannot speak for every "classically-trained" chef. You can't possibly know what they would or would not use as ingredients. I think it's safe to say that even trained chefs cook like everyone else once in awhile. Last night I boiled store-bought (albeit fresh) ravioli, tossed on a little diced tomatoes from a can, drizzled on some high-quality EV olive oil, and some chiffonade of basil -- and I'm a graduate of the French Culinary Institute in NYC. Sorry to prove you wrong, but you asked us to speak up.

I changed the recipe a little bit by making my own pizza crust, baked it first of course and omitted the squash. Everyone loved it.

A fabulous recipe - although of course I harvested my own wheat for the flour and slaughtered the chicken myself . And it only took me a week to prepare! Everyone at my dinner party loved it - unfortunately I fell asleep before tasting it. Thanks for the laughs food snobs!

Quick, easy, and yummy! I used rotisserie chicken breast meat , a pre- made pizza crust, red onion, and already roasted garlic in place of the veggies. It took about 30 minutes to assemble, saute the onions and garlic and mince the cilantro plus another 15 minutes to bake. Perhaps there was a little too much topping, and next time I might add some sliced mushrooms, but overall it was a winner! For working folks who don't have all day to cook, this was excellent... better than any bbq chicken pizza from W. Puck or Cal. Pizza Kitchen, in my humble opinion.

For a complete variation - tandoori chicken pizza. Buy / make (whatever makes you happy) a pizza base and top with tomato based sauce, bite size pieces of chicken breast that you've previously fried in a mix of tandoori paste and plain yoghurt (50 - 50 usually works for me), sliced mushrooms, red onion and mozarella. Serve with sliced avocado, mango chutney and more plain yoghurt.

As a "food snob" in training at the Cordon Bleu who lives with another professionally-trained "food snob", I have to weigh in on this one. We made this for dinner last night and felt no need to draw the blinds as we--Sacre Bleu!--unwrapped our Boboli crust and--Mon Dieu!--put chicken on a pizza. Wolfgang Puck puts some crazy things on his pizzas, and no one asks him any questions, yes? Again, many of the pros RELY on and are THANKFUL for shortcuts such as prepared crust. It's to the point where I can spot the printed recipes in Gourmet and Bon Appetit that will spark these debates on this website. The only thing we changed in this recipe was to grate our own cheese, as the pre-shredded is often too dry.

When I was a kid Mom made homemade pizza and it was always a treat. I used her recipe for a thin crispy crust (it only takes about 10 minutes to make your own and sooo much better than store bought) I know BBQ chicken pizza isn't traditional, but it's one of my favorites. I love yellow squash, but am not crazy about zucchini so I substitued purple onion and roasted garlic as suggested by another reviewer - DELICIOUS.

Rating: 2
I only gave this a two because I liked it, didn't love it..BUT it is a great way to disguise yellow squash and zucchini, those good for you vegetables that neither my husband nor I are wild about, and is a relatively easy, solid meal. I followed the recipe as written except for substituting refrigerated Pillsbury pizza crust when my grocery didn't have Bobolis. The marrying of the flavors was excellent and I ended up with a lot of extra chicken/veggie/cheese mixture to which I will probably add more BBQ sauce and stuff into pita bread for lunch for the next couple days. The idea to use prepared rotisserie chicken is a good one which I might employ next time.

I really love this recipe. I have never tried Boboli before but wanted to try it, so when I saw this recipe I got my chance to see how it tasted. We are always looking for new recipes and this is going to be an all time favorite for us. I want to try that Greek bread and parsley next time to compare. EXELLENT!!!!!!

Rating: 3
Great pizza!! I don't know what "Boboli" is, but the 8" 'Greek' pita bread (ie. without a pocket) worked great. I substituted parsley for cilantro (cilantro = 'scary spice' for me!). The suggestion of goat cheese sounds like a wonderful addition, will try next time. And about that 'Jack Daniels' bbq sauce from a previous review: I bought it last summer, but was really disappointed that there was no actual Jack Daniels whiskey in it! It's still good, but, kinda false advertising, don't ya think? (Maybe I should just add some myself!).

Excellent with goat cheese - just crumble over all the other ingredients. By the way - unless you've actually made the dish we are not interested in your opinion. "Sounds delicious" just doesn't entice me to try a recipe.

This comes together fast and looks awesome when it comes out of the oven. Tastes great, too! I avoided the clinatro (I'm allergic to it) and used Jack Daniels bar-b-q sauce which added a lot of zip to it.

I haven't tried it YET. Because I am the only one who will eat the squash, I would substitute it with red and/or green/ and or yellow peppers. It sounds SO Delicious!!!!!
