This recipe is good, but much better with roasted garlic and rosemary potatoes.

after reading the comments about 'something lacking' in the recipe, i decided to roast the asparagus in olive oil and salt instead of blanching it. i didn't add any garlic because i thought it might overpower the dish - as other reviewers discovered. i added a pinch of sugar to the vinaigrette which added a little depth. my husband and i were both really pleased with the result. i'll make this (modified) recipe again.

I'd make it again, but I'd probably go through the suggestions given by other reviewers, to see if I could find some ideas to improve this dish. It wasn't bad, mind you, but it wasn't fantastic--I too found it lacking . . . something. Other than changing the amount of potatoes I used (I realized early on the "three medium" potatoes would be far too few), I made the recipe exactly as it says . . . and it's okay, but it's missing something.

I do the same thing with green beans, but I also add chopped garlic to taste. I serve it very cold.

This really needs garlic, a goodly amount of sea salt and perhaps a splash of vinegar (white, rice or balsamic).

Modifications: I doubled the amount of asparagus and potatoes, and quadrupled the amount of oil, mustard and lemon juice. The cup oil was used to bagna cauda a whole head of garlic (see the comments in the 12/27/99 review). Potatoes were roasted whole and never cut. We had a few roasted red peppers lying around, and added those. Make sure that you either use just the top 2/3 of the asparagus spears, or peel the bottoms before cutting them up -- the bottom third can be woody, especially late in the season. Huge crowd pleaser at our Fourth of July oyster barbecue.

It sounds delicious. I thought it was tasteless-wouldn't make it again.

I made the version recommended by another cook including roasted garlic. It was very good. I made it the day before I served it. The garlic seemed to over power the dish. Next time i will use half the amount of garlic.

We made this for my husband's aunt and uncle and my mother-in-law is still talking about how much they enjoyed it. She wasn't even there! It's nice and lemony and great with thin spring asparagus.

As with most potato salads, it's difficult to get proportions correct. I used new baby red potatoes. My family loved this dish. The most important thing is not to overcook the asparagus.I also added fresh basil.

I liked the Cook from Toronto's suggestion: I sliced the 3 potaotes 1/2 thick and roasted them in Rosemary oil with the garlic (turning after 20 minutes-until nicely brown.) I also think the Mayo addition works well. I added a 1/2 t of hot paprika. Yummy warm. We didn't HAVE leftovers to fight over. Thanks TORONTO Cook!

Readers - don't get discouraged by these reviews. I have some modifications that will turn this into a dish beyond belief! I recommend that you mix the potatoes with olive oil and lots of rosemary and grill them in a barbeque basket until they are nicely brown. Meanwhile, in a glass casserole, cover with olive oil a heads worth of peeled garlic cloves. Put the casserole in the oven at about 450 for about 30 minutes or until the garlic cloves start to brown. Add the roasted cloves to the salad along with the grilled potatoes and steamed asparagus. The oil from the garlic is the best part and should be added to the salad. I also added a little bit of mayonaisse to the salad. If you think this salad was good the first day, we were fighting over the leftovers the next day. Incidently, this way of cooking garlic is called Bagna Cauda and makes an awesome apetizer. Serve the cloves with french brend. I also like adding fresh herbs to the mixture while its cooking.

Although I didn't have the problems Mr. Higgins seemed to ( I steamed the potatoes and asparagus the way I usually do, and 5 redskin potatoes = 1 pound), I found this dish wanting something. My daughter loved it though, and took home the leftovers.

Don't waste your time or money. The ingredient portions are wrong (how large are these 3 new potatos?) and if you cook the asparagus and potatos as long as it calls for, you won't end up with "firm but tender". You'll end up with mush.

I used the juice of an entire lemon and a bit more olive oil. The dressing was great & the salad made an excellent accompanyment to fish
