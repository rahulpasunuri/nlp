For our Easter Ham, we decided to try this glaze, we had no apples/apple jelly, however we had canned pineapples, so I pureed the pineapples with the rest of ingredients, the sauce was the right consistency after the puree. Glazed the ham placed in back into the oven and allowed it to finish baking with the glaze. OH MY LORD, this was FANTASTIC.................. Next time I will try it with the Apple Jelly.

This recipe added a special flavor to the split pea soup that was made from the remains of the ham.

Made this for Easter dinner. Everyone seemed to go back for seconds. It was delicious and very easy to make. One thing I did was to bring the ham to a boil for 1 1/2 hour, and baked for an hour at 325. It came out moist, and not too salty. Definitely will make for the next holiday.

We had this at Easter everyone loved it. We usually have a honey-baked, but we'll have this from now on.

The glaze was wonderful. My family loved it. I did however make one substitution. I used apple butter instead of apple jelly.

Cooked this ham along with a great turkey recipe for last Thanksgiving. Everyone fought over seconds and thirds on the ham. They liked the turkey, they craved the ham. Having it again for Easter as I have been begged to do this so many times. I charcoal grilled the ham for about 4 hours which added to the overall blending of flavors.
