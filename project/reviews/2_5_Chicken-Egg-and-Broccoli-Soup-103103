I started the soup by sauteing broccoli, fennel, and several cloves of garlic in 1 Tablespoon butter. Added a generous amount of salt and cayenne pepper. Immersion blended the soup before adding the eggs. Very wholesome, cozy soup. Cold night. The soup made our noses sweat.

I thought it tasted great. I took the reviewers advice and added garlic, and cayenne pepper. It made a nice touch. The hubs and I really enjoyed this, though word to the wise it is a LOT of broccoli so if your not used to that much you might want to use a little less.

This is a yummy soup! But since i made some improvements upon it like other reviewers i couldn't give it the full 4 forks. I too added an onion and garlic cloves (2), which i sauteed. I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes for some kick, and took my immersion blender to it for a creamier texture prior to adding egg.

Sorry for the multiple reviews that probably skewed the rating. Computer problems.

I would give this recipe zero forks if I could.

So easy and so delicious! I make this all the time now, as it's perfect for a chilly night or afternoon, and the ingredients are basics that I always have on hand. I've also made it with cauliflower and that worked out very well.

I sauteed onions and some garlic, then the broccoli, before proceeding with the broth and adding the egg. The soup is good but it still needs something. The addition of the egg is fun. I think I'll try it again at least once, possibly with some cayenne.

This was surely easy and quick. I added lemon to the egg and broth mixture and also put a garlic clove in the broth with the broccoli. Neither addition made this delicious. I will not make this again unless I am desparate!

Really great and easy. I had some beef broth also and used a mixture, turned out fantastic. Suprisingly tasty with so little ingredients.

Very good, simple and healthy! Spinkled the parmesan in soup bowl and next time I will take out the broccoli before adding the eggs mixture.

I used veggie stock but didn't cook the broccoli with it because I thought it might make the stock taste bitter. So I steamed the broccoli, then added it to the stock with some lemon juice. And because I love onions and spices I threw in a handful of chopped scallions and some red pepper flakes to taste. This is a lovely, quick soup!

I love this dish not only because it is delicious, but also because it is so simple to make and very healthy. I could not bring myself to use canned chicken broth so I simply boiled some chicken breasts with skin, put in a chicken bouillon and used this for the soup. I also cut the cooked chicken into small strips and put them into the soup.

Super with some chunks of cooked chicken breast. I mixed the parmesan cheese in with the egg and broth instead of sprinkling it on top. Yummmmmm.

Delicious! I added tofu and diced chicken breast to it. Healthy and tasty!

It was ok, I guess, but I feel like it needed something-maybe garlic. I chopped up some chicken breasts and threw those in, and they were good. I'll try it again to see if my taster was just screwed up.

This soup is great. It's basically egg drop soup with broccoli, so it's easy and healthy and delicious. I will definitely make it again!

Where's the chicken in this soup? Easy to make yes, nutritional yes but I want pieces of chicken in my soup.
