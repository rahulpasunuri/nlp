This sauce is scrumptious, but it does depend on top shelf vinegars to avoid the complaints of too sweet, too vinagar-y. I used an aged sherry vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar and an 18 year-old balsamic. Grocery store vinegars just won't do here. I have served this sauce with veal, goose, duck, and bone-in 2 inch thick pork rib chops. I use a mix of fresh mushrooms instead of the dried morels and it always turns out perfectly.

This was good, but I agree with the folks who found the end result too sweet and too vinegary. Between the veal demiglace, morels and veal rib chops I used, I felt this was NOT a good use of expensive ingredients. I liked it okay, but for the effort and cost I would not make it again.

I have done this numerous times for a wide variety of guests and it is always a hit. One of my favorites for a special occasion.

I made it the first time and mixed up the order of the reductions and it came out fine, though I don't recall what I did. The second time, I have to agree with another reviewer, the sauce was much too vinegary and sweet.

I used this sauce with veal scallopini rather than chops, and it worked very well. The sauce is delicious but has a very intense flavor from the vinegar and all of the reduction. My main purpose for making the sauce was to use the fresh morel mushrooms available for the first time at a local grocer, and the sauce was so intense that it almost overpowered the mushrooms. Next time I will be careful to use maybe a little less vinegar and to use more mushrooms.

Overall I thought this was an excellent recipe. Very rich. Perfect with veal rib chops. I look forward to trying it with a nice filet. I did add two tablespoons of butter at the very end because the hint of vinegar was still a little too noticeable.

This was one of very few Epicurious recipes I've tried that I really didn't like very much. I love morels.....and all the other ingredients. I made it exactly according to the recipe to go with a whole Beef Tenderloin......grilled rare. The sauce was way too sweet.....the morels could have been raisins, according to the taste. Everyone seemed to like it, but I see no point in ending up with a sweet sauce when you have wonderful ingredients like morels and a nice veal stock. I think the syrup completely overshadowed the morel flavor.

This is a great basic sauce. I used it with veal scallops and porcini mushrooms instead of the morels (I prefer their taste and texture, personally). One hint, make sure to let the sauce reduce quite a bit. The richer, the better.

My guests rated this sauce an average of 3.5 forks and I agree. I served this with roasted monkfish and changed the recipe as follows: used 1/2 fresh morels and 1/2 black trumpet mushrooms; used chicken stock instead of veal (we don't eat veal); added about one tablespoon of butter to sauce right before serving to give it a beautiful shine. I also served roasted garlic mashed potatoes and steamed baby carrots. Wonderful, a lovely meal for a special occasion.

This was delicious with the veal chop that we did on the grill (1st time this season - the snow is finally off the deck steps). As much as I enjoyed the sauce, I am not sure I would spend $15 for 3/4 ounces of dried morels again. I think any flavorful mushroom would work just as well. I envy my Cornish neighbors their fresh source of morels.

Cook from Cornish NH This is an A+++ it was so good. I made it with dried morels to see if it would be good enough to make with the fresh morels which we gather in May. My Husband a very hard to please person with food, just loved it. The only change I made was, I could not find veal anything, so instead I used the better then bullion, 1 teaspoon beef, 1 teaspoon chicken, 2 cups water.

OK, although I couldn't find morels during a quick lunchtime trip to the store, I did use shitakes--and was very pleased with the results. Can only imagine how wonderful they would be with morels! I, too, can imagine this sauce on other items (filet mignon, pork tenderloin, etc.)! A definite keeper!

This is a robust yet versatile sauce. We have served it with veal, standing rib roasts, and filet mignon. We have only prepared it with dried rather than fresh morels which, I believe, have a more intense flavor and rehydrate to a pleasant texture. This has become a favorite for special dinners. We highly recommend it!

This is a rich sauce without being heavy due to the lack of fat or cream. Excellent mushroom flavor. The folks from Minneapolis should learn to spell BEURRE, then maybe we would take your comments seriously. MAYBE.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. For those ppl who use fresh and didn't know about the bugs my advice is to soak the morels in water for a few hours before you plan on using them. This process makes the little critters come out of hiding leaving you with fresh, clean morels.

I went to the Farmer's Market and saw fresh morels so I walked away with $25 worth (1 lb) and clicked onto Epicurious. Unfortunately, we were swayed by the preponderance of 4 fork reviews for this recipe. We are not sure what others were thinking. We could hardly taste the mushrooms! We would have been far better off just to saute them in butter with S&P. We decided that if we had to fix the recipe, we would make it with shitakes or portobelloes, cut the sugar down and then swirl in butter and or cream at the end, because it tastes like a buerre blanc without the buerre.

Me and my husband found nearly 5 shopping bags of these mushrooms after reading about them on the internet. I made this for a group that we usually have over, everyone was raving about the sauce. People kept asking what the crunchy things were. I assumed that they were charred bits of the chops. Well, then a gentleman found a bug in the sauce and then other people started finding bugs! Two of the ladies with weaker stomachs vomitted at the table after learning that the crunchy things they were eating were insects. What a terrible experiance. If you make this I would suggest oyster mushrooms instead of mushrooms that bugs hide in. I now have friends who will probably never eat my cooking again and a garbage can full of mushrooms.

easy, pretty, very yummy. My dinner guests actually applauded at the end of the dinner. I used 1/3 pound fresh morels and 2/3 pound button mushrooms to reduce the cost. Everything else was added according to the recipe. This could be served with any roast meat such as pork or even lamb. Delicious!

Fantastic sauce and quite simple to prepare. I soaked dried morels in beef stock and substituted beef stock for the veal stock. The morel mushroom flavor really comes through. I can't imagine a substitution would have as good a flavor.

This was a wonderful sauce and I made it with button mushrooms.....outstanding!!!

We were fortunate to find close to two hundred morels this Mother's Day, and I've got to say that this was one of the best uses to put them to. I have made two batches of sauce, so we used one with the veal and froze the other. I recommend this highly!

I used fresh morels and served it with thick pork chops. After completing the sauce I was a little worried that the taste was bitter, so I added a little more sugar and balsamic vinegar. My guests raved about it, and I must agree that it complimented the pork perfectly.

This sauce is wonderful!! I used morels that I had dried this last spring and served it with a boneless rolled pork loin cooked on a grill rotisserie. I got rants and raves! Will try it on venison loin later this fall.

A very good sauce - delicious

This sauce was tremendous. Although it was meant to accompany veal, it went equally well with lamb. I cheated twice on the recipe (used portobello mushrooms instead of morels and used Knorr instant demi-glace) and still had a superb result.

Really needs to be made with morels. If you cannot find them fresh, order them dried from a specialty food shop.
