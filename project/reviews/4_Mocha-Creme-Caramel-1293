Ive been Making traditional Creme Caramel for 15 years and its one of my favorites! I wanted to try something different but have before with bad results (with other variations). I thought Id give it one more shot and was skeptical of this due to the coffee and chocolate in combination with a traditional creme Carmel. I honestly did not have high hopes for this but followed this to a tee, Only I used a mix of extra dark and milk chocolate in the ganache. All I can saw is WOW. I Simply cannot believe how well chocolate and the Coffee flavors work with Creme Carmel. This is absolutely divine! I truly think this is one of the most delicious desserts I have EVER made. Hands down a winner!

This is a wonderful recipe. The caramel done in the Microwave is brilliant but you can burn it if you go too long. To make the caramel - cooked it at full power for 3 minutes then I did it for 30 second intervals until it became the golden brown we were seeking.If it gets too dark it can burn. As for the Ganache... My guests loved it. I'd keep it. Also, the dollop of whipped cream is much needed and totally compatible. Getting them out was a cinch. I was totally unsure how they would release since I had never attempted this before, but I took the refrigerated ramekin and gently dipped the bottoms in warm/hot tap water, ran the knife around the edge and inverted - They all came out beautifully! Yeah! DELICIOUS!

This is my go-to dessert for company. It is divine. Even my daughter who doesn't like chocolate (unnatural child!) loves this and begs for it regularly.

Sublime! A great dessert to serve your date! Don't skip the ganache; it is a nice touch. I used instant espresso powder instead of coffee granules.

I've been making this dessert since it first appeared in Bon Appetit 14 years ago. It makes you look like an amazing chef, but is almost foolproof. I'm grateful to the reviewer who mentioned microwaving the caramel - saves pans and time and increases my likelihood of making this more often. Personally, I wouldn't omit the ganache. It adds to the sex appeal of the dish, and can always just not be eaten. I've had terrific luck with Guittard chocolate chips for my 8 oz. of chopped chocolate.

I have made this one so many times now. I follow the recipe exactly and it has turned out great every time!

These were excellent the first time I made them. I'm back for the recipe again to make them tonight. They were a bit runny when I served them, but I think it was because I increased the recipe to make each one slightly larger, and so they were undercooked. Be sure to bake until there is only a very slight jiggle in the pudding. I, unlike other reviewers, think the ganache was easy and excellent. It really sets the dish apart and makes it more memorable. Very impressive dessert!

Delicious recipe. But I omitted the chocolate ganache and I will try 2 whole eggs and 2 yolks. Otherwise it is too rich. Also I made the caramel in my microwave and it was ready in 3 mn at full power.

I agree with the other reviewers - a lovely change from the standard creme caramel (1) dark chocolate worked well (2) needs to be served with a dollop of whipped cream or some fruit to balance the sweetness/chocolately-ness (3) I tried the foil cups suggestion, but they leaked caramel after cooking. Make sure you use tough foil.

To Calgary cook: In former restaurant life, we would use a ramekin or custard size foil cup instead of ceramic. After running knife around edge, invert onto plate and pierce a paring knife through the bottom of the foil container. Should shake out with a thin glass of caramel on top.

This was delicious. A few changes though. Use semi-sweet chocolate, skip the Ganache, it's good but not necessary and makes for a lighter dessert and next time I will use instant expresso powder instead of regular coffee powder. I had a heck of a time getting the darn things out, any ideas??

This was delicious and very easy to make. I added one step when I poured the custard through a fine sieve before pouring it into the cups. I don't know if it was necessary, but I wanted to be careful to have it completely smooth. It was impressive and wonderful!

This is a great recipe which I have made several times. I like it best with a dark chocolate ganache instead of the milk chocolate ganache (just substitute dark or bittersweet choc. in that part). Also, I have made it in one large glass pie dish, as a "flan" for a Mexican themed dinner party. This worked well, too!

This is a delicious recipe. simple and elegant. i have also tried it with white chocolate in the custard with great results. the caramel is somewhat unnessecary and can easily be avoided. instead try topping it with a raspberry sacue.

This is an excellent variation on the traditional creme caramel. Very easy to make. A good recipe for a dinner party, as you can make a day ahead. I served it with fresh fruit, which made for a very pretty presentation.
