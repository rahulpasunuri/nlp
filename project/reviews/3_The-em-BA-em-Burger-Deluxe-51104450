For all of you snobs out there who think you know it all, you don't. You'd be surprised how many people cannot make a decent burger! My mom was an EXCELLENT cook who gave me the foundation to become a professional chef. However, when she was a young wife and mother she made terrible hamburgers! She would overcook and way over-season the meat with garlic, onion, black pepper, etc., totally obliterating the taste of the beef, and she didn't even toast the buns! We had to ASK her to please put cheese on them! You see, there were no burger joints in the small town she came from so she had no template. As I grew older and was allowed to help cook for the family, I took over as burger cook. THEN the burgers began to rock. I simply imitated the luscious, juicy burgers from our fabulous, family- owned, neighborhood diner/burger stop. This was BEFORE there was a franchised, fast food, cookie-cutter, drive-thru on every block. This recipe merely gives people the basics and most really need it. The worst burgers I've ever had have been in the homes of people who think they make "great" burgers! Are you one of those?

Follow the instructions carefully, including the 20% fat. Comparing this to In-N-Out Burgers is the ultimate compliment!

Kosher salt? Seriously? That's way too coarse (kosher salt is a very coarse grade used to extract blood from meat, without dissolving). Fine sea salt is more appropriate.

LOL reading some of the comments. Every now and then I suspect whoever posts these daily recipes at Epicurious gets bored and tries to stir the pot. But then I remember it wasnt that long ago we had to teach our next future Daughter in Law how to boil water.

How to cook the patty is all well and good, but for the very best hamburger you must toast and lightly butter the bun. Now you're in burger heaven!

In an age where "Umami Dust", foie gras, artisanal cheese and a plethora of other epicurean toppings are added to the humble burger, I believe this recipe is meant to be a return of sorts to the classic American treat that many of us secretly crave and love despite our claims of being foodies. As a hospitality professional, I have worked with countless chefs who cannot make a decent burger to save their lives and it never hurts to remind even the most skilled cooks about how satisfying a burger can be when prepared correctly. As a lifelong West Coast dweller, I can say that this burger reminds me of those at In-In-Out, which, coincidentally, famed chef Thomas Keller counts among his favorite foods. I suppose all the haters out there who consider this recipe too plebeian consider their tastes to be far above and beyond the founder of the French Laundry. Yikes.

i happen to LOVE American cheese on a burger. It's that or blue and my first choice is American...with hamburger dills. and yes, I AM a foodie.

Oh darn. I viewed the picture and the recipe doesn't say anything about what that red stuff and green stuff is inside the bun. Are there other websites and books that are available to help me know what these are? I wouldn't risk the potential failure that may result from my attempting this recipe without the complete details.

Here's an alternate recipe. Drive up to the drive-thru window at McDonald's. Clearly annunciate, I'll have the number 1 combo. Take cash out of wallet but only after rolling down window. Then hand money to cashier. Drive up to second window. Make sure your window remains open so that second attendant can hand you food. Put soda in cup holder in car. Place bag on passenger seat if not occupied otherwise secure where it otherwise won't get jostled. Drive safely to a location where you can enjoy your McDonald's take out. Use ketchup, salt, napkins and straws provided in bag as needed. Keep our planet clean and always dispose of trash properly. Was this BA recipe for a hamburger some kind of a joke?

American cheese? It's not even real cheese. At least do cheddar!

The most difficult foods to make well are often the simplest. Perfect mashed potatoes, hard cooked eggs without any grey, good coffee, and yes hamburgers. The fewer ingredients, the more it comes down to quality and technique. Many people don't discern or care about these things, but need to belittle those who are new to cooking and need to learn. It's the foolish who don't repeat the basics thinking they're too good to need the practice.

There's a recipe for ice water? Where?

Seems like an awful lot of salt for this recipe. I think my cardiologist would be screaming at me if I ate one of these burgers.

I don't see what all the hullabaloo is about, if u know how to make a burger just go to the next recipe. There are lots of young people out there now days that don't know how to cook, this is basic instructions for them.

People don't magically know how to make a good burger. Everyone has a different level of cooking knowledge and everyone has to learn the basics somewhere. Obviously, most of you think that, because you know how to make a decent burger, everyone else should, too. It must be awful having to share the world with people who aren't as smart as you.

I agree with Batroun from New York but I use half short rib meat and half sirloin ground coarsely. Perfect flavor and texture. I can't wait for them to post the ice water recipe...I get really thirsty standing in front of the grill.

So wait, the meat goes INSIDE the bun! I always got to the end but didn't know what to do with all the pieces. The rest of you can mock this recipe all you want but for me these instructions taught me so much, not just about burgers, they taught me about life.

Consider this a venue to learn and possibly help the novice as well as the seasoned cook. Tips and tricks should be shared, so even those "Expert" berger-makers out there might learn a thing or two. Chuck has the right amount of fat for a juicy burger, unless you a fitness nut! Remember: Eat right, exercise, stay fit, die anyway!

Why start with chuck meat? Yuck. Buy prime ribs--the ribs, the rib meat and grind it. Or prime sirloin--again, grind it yourself.

to publish this recipe is just plain silliness. Hopefully we all know how to make a plain burger. Use your space wisely. Katherine

A couple of "Do Nots!" for a better burger. Do not compress meat, too much, when making the patty. Do not keep flipping and squeezing the juice out of the burgers on the grill. I like to add a 1/4 Lb. of ground sausage (various blends) to 1 lb. of chuck. Also a bit of garlic salt, or other spices, once in a while.

I ground my own beef for these burgers, hubby LOVED them! He has lunch at In-N-Out every week, these looked like their burgers but were way better!
