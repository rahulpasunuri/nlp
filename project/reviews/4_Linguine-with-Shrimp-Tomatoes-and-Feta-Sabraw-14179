Exceptional!!! I closely followed the recipe, except I took the advice of reviewers who (1.) suggested pre-roasting the garlic and (2.) stirring the feta into the hot pasta before adding the other ingredients (makes it so creamy!) and (3.) increasing the basil and adding chili pepper flakes. I did not have time to chill the sauce and let it rest, and it was still fabulous. But when people went back for seconds, they said it was even more delicious, so if you have time, I would suggest that you do not omit this step. Will make this again and again!

I've made this a gazillion times. It's a regular in our home. I've never chilled the sauce and I add kalamata olives. I also don't use the whole amount of feta...

I made this recipe tonight with the help of previous reviews and it was excelent! I cooked the shrip in olive oil, garlic and red pepper flakes until done. I did not chill the sauce because I was ready to cook the pasta and serve the meal. I added the leftover oil/garlic/red pepper from cooking the shrimp to the water for the pasta. This made all of the flavors come together wonderfully. We served it with a very nice Pinot Noir as was suggested in another review and the combination was great. I will do this again and serve it with toasted/buttered french bread.

I won't rate this because the fault of its not being tasty may be the fault of my basil which, picked in September, may have been past its prime. My expectations far exceeded the result. I also liked it better warm rather than cold with the pasta. Not my favorite recipe!

Didn't bother chilling the sauce and added chopped kalamata olives. I used penne since it made more sense, shapewise. Made twice in a row it is so delicious and easy

I have made this probably 8 times. It is so easy, especially since most of it can be prepped ahead of time. I didn't change a thing and wouldn't!

This is quite good. It is similar to another one we make with oregano. Unless it is early in the season, I would not use cherry tomatoes because the skin can be tough. We used 4 large peeled and seeded tomatoes.

I made this last nite and thought it was awesome. It was so easy to make and had such good flavors. It is a good summer pasta dish. I used about double the amount of basil from my garden, but didn't use the whole 6 oz container of feta. I sauteed the shrimp with garlic and olive oil and then added the marinade (minus the feta) to make a warm sauce. I grated two cloves of garlic for the marinade and used the other two for the shrimps. Add the feta as you toss the pasta with the sauce so it melts a little and adds a bit of creaminess to it. I would like to try the non-cooked sauce next time with my yellow and roma tomatoes. I brought the leftovers to work for lunch and it reheated very well.

Excellent dish: fresh, bright tastes and color. I like it best using pre-cooked, shelled crawfish, which may not be found everywhere. Pre-cooked, shelled baby shrimp are also tasty and fast. Worth a try! (I do usually reduce the garlic).

Very fresh and very simple. I found that the finished dish was not quite as warm as I would like because the marinated ingredients were still a bit chilled even after being added to hot pasta. I will make it again though.

This is a great recipe - quick and easy, and with great flavor. The only change I made was using pre-cooked baby shrimp instead of medium sized uncooked shrimp. I only did this because of time constraints, but I actually liked the size of the baby shrimp mixed in with the pasta. I think if I made it again, I would keep the baby shrimp. We had 2 guys at our table that night too, and they both loved it. My sister liked it so much she printed off the recipe and made it two weeks later for our parents, who also loved it.

I didn't make this , but had it at a dinner party last night. When I found out that the hostess got it from this site, I knew I had to add it to my recipe box. This has the right amount of everything, including flavor. I could eat it every day. Perfect!

This was easy to prepare and had a very fresh taste to it. I modified the recipe by cooking the shrimp with some added garlic and chili flakes which I think made the shrimp tastier. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this!

I ended up sauteeing the tomatoes, scallions, garlic, and shrimp together and throwing the cooked pasta into the saute' pan. It turned out quite well and all my kiddies ate with gusto.

Couldn't have been easier to make. Didn't chill the mixture, due to time constraints. Next time I will cut one of the garlic cloves. Will definitely make again.

I used fresh summer tomatoes instead of cherry and for time used pre-cooked/shelled shrimp. The meal still turned out delicious. Next time will use more basil and less garlic.

Quite delicious considering how easy it was to make. It was made tastier with the addition of toasted pine nuts and roasted garlic

This was great and SO quick. I had very little basil and was a wreck that it would be bland but used a flavored feta. I also used cooked shrimp that I just heated up in a pan with some sale, pepper, red pepper flakes and olive oil. I also made the sauce and let it sit for half an hour but did not refrigerate then take out- no time and it didn't need it. I made this with half spinach and half plain pasta- it was quick and great! I'll make this again and again.

This dish was delicious and easy too. One of my favorite restaurants prepares a similar dish and I wondered how they kept the integrity of the feta and the veggies. Now I know. I fixed this for my husband's birthday and he said it was better than any restaurant's version. Thanks for a great new recipe!

Since I'm not a fan of big chunks of raw tomato, I diced them up. I used feta cheese, straight from the brine, something I've never done before -but I'm so glad I did! It is awesome!!! My husband loved this recipe and he is a verrrrry picky eater. Will definitely make this again!

This recipe has become a family favorite in our house. We make it at least once a month. Try adding different seasonings to add an extra flair.

my husband and I loved this dish. I forgot to reserve the pasta water--so it was a bit dry. I won't forget that next time. I also halved the recipe and it was just enough for the two of us. Also, I prepared the shrimp and marinade the night before. The next day, after work, all I had to do was make the linguine and it was ready to eat. Talk about fast food!

I love this recipe, but instead of using raw garlic, which is sometimes too strong, I substitute oven roasted garlic. This adds a delicious mellow flavour to this great dish.

I used very thinly sliced plum tomatoes, and it was a delicious light meal. I look forward to doing this with fresh summer tomatoes. It is between a salad and a pasta dish and very refreshing.

I used basil from the garden and the freshest ingredients possible....this is an awesome repipe. In one variation I used steamed brocoli and baby carrots.

The blend of ingredients was perfect. My wife brought it to work with her, the nurses raved about it. This recipe is definitely on my file.

My hungry family of 9 couldn't wait an hour for the sauce to chill, so I carried on without it, and it was great! I even forget to shell the shrimp (I had a few glasses of Merlot during preparation...oops!) and the troops didn't seem to notice - the meal was just divine.

This is really, really easy and delicious. Use the freshest ingredients possible! Perfect week night or casual weekend dinner. I also skipped the hour in the fridge - I let the sauce sit out for about 30 minutes.

this was very tasty. i modified it by grilling the shrimp on a stove top grill,adding a handful of chopped kalamata olives and serving with grilled pita toasts. i didn't bother chilling. also i utilized a technique i like when using garlic in a dressing. rather than chopping,i create a garlic paste by grinding a clove with kosher salt in a mortar and pestal(sic).
