This was my first attempt at cooking fish and I liked this recipe except for the anchovies! They turned a delicious piece of talapia into a fishy tasting mess. I'll definitely make it again but sans anchovies.

It's unbelievable how good this is for the ease. I used talapia, peppered the fish and sprayed it with buttery spray before covering it with the onion mixture. I used cilantro for the parsley and squeezed lime instead of lemon. It was fabulous and healthy.

Loved the simplicuty of this dish. Had all the ingredients on hand except I used catfish. It still turned out great. I don't eat a lot of salt and did not find it to be too salty as someone else suggested. Am going to try the Red Snapper A La Nicoise tonight!

Could not be easier -- made this in 5 minutes! It came out a bit salty but you could rinse the capers and/or anchovies (I didn't). Capers and anchovies are a great way to add lots of flavor without many calories. I used snapper (any white fish would do).
