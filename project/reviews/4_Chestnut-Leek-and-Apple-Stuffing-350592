Best stuffing I've ever had. I've made it the past 3 years and it's always the most popular dish and the most requested the following year. This one has become a permanent fixture on our Thanksgiving menu.

Flavors were delicious - I added a little stock to moisten it & should have added a bit more. Nice change from the usual sausage based dressing.

This is one of the best recipes I have made. Even better reheated. Liz

Very good, though I will probalby keep trying to find the *best* stuffing recipe out there. "Bottled roasted chestnuts" were $18 for 5oz. at my market. The same product "roasted chestnuts" in an envelope-like package can be found in the Asian foods section of your market. $0.99 for 3oz.

Delicious, but not the most amazing I've ever had. I will probably use this again, but it is one of those recipes that serves as a fabulous base from which to experiment. I used two additional cups of bread. I didn't use white at all...I used a combination of a multigrain/herb bread, whole wheat bread, and rye. I also roasted fresh chestnuts - I've never had jarred chestnuts, but they are rather costly, so I'd rather roast my own. I also tossed in about 3/4 cup of fresh chopped cranberries. I used more salt than called for. It's a pretty stuffing and i love the basic idea. Try it :)

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was good, but not great. Next time I'll try something else

Made this the last two years and looking forward to making it this year again. I just add a little more apple and chestnuts and no thyme (not every one likes it at our table) and I substitute the cream for chicken or vegtable stock. I think it is more hearty for meal.

This is a very rich stuffing. The flavors are wonderful together, but next time I will decrease the amount of leeks and increase the amount of bread. BTW - roasted chestnuts are always soft, whether you buy them in a bag or from a street vendor still in the shell.

I made this for thanksgiving and thought it was very tasty. I did find it to be very rich and heavy, so keep that in mind when choosing other side dishes. Also, I doubled the recipe but found that I didn't need to. One recipe made a very large amount.

This recipe is awesome! It's my new Thanksgiving staple. I like to add water chestnuts too for added crunch.

Unbelievably delicious. It was the favorite dish of Thanksgiving dinner, and that included amazing turkey with truffle butter! This dressing was deceptively rich and creamy, with lots of taste. So much better than I would have guessed. I did not change anything, and recommend that it be made as directed. The bottled chestnuts from Whole Foods, tho pricey, were deliciously smooth and creamy.

Made this for Thanksgiving and really enjoyed it. Few changes - roasted chestnuts along with bread cubes rather than buying bottled, used sourdough bread, 2% milk instead of cream and added a couple handfuls of dried cranberries. Yum!

Overall very good. I also bought bottled chestnuts. They weren't at all crunchy they were almost creamy. I also added a bunch more cream because it did seem too dry.

The cream and chestnuts were too rich for my taste.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and overall it was very tasty. The only suggestion I would have is to use fresh chesnuts instead of bottled because of a. the cost (the bottled kind was $11) and b. the texture: the bottled chesnuts were soft and we would have preferred them to be harder. I would also suggest using a variety of types of bread, such as pumpernickle or wheat in addition to the white bread. Other than that, very tasty and a nice alternative to the traditional variety.
