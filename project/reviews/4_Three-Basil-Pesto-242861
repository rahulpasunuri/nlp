I have been making this pesto since 2009, putting it in food saver bags in small quantities and freezing it for use throughout the year. The exact kind of basil you use is not important. Any combination of basils, picked fresh from your garden, will produce a tasty pesto to be used with pasta, pizza or chicken.

Since I just harvested the last of my basil plants, this is a terrific recipe to use with fresh from the garden herbs. To use everything I picked this morning, the recipe should be quadrupled. There is a lot of latitude in this recipe. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to know what to substitute when the ingredients are sparse. You can use walnuts in place of pine nuts. To stay on budget, sometimes I'll add some ricotta cheese with dry Parmesean cheese. We'll have some tonight and the rest I'll freeze for future meals. Quick to prepare, easy to use and store, and the clean- up is fast, too.

Next time I may add 1/2 the cheese and take the lemon suggestion. Made it in the blender and needed to add lots more olive oil as it had the consistency of paste. Flavor was yummy but definitely would use food processor and less cheese

this is a good basic pesto recipe. i like it because the ingredients can be added to or subtracted from in order to make basil just the way i want it for any given dish.

Parsley gives this pesto a really odd flavor. I'd never made pesto before and wish someone had pointed out to me that pesto is usually just basil. This is a variation that seems to appeal to some, but it's not the flavor I'm used to and not what I was hoping to create.

Was I not supposed to toast the pine nuts? I thought this recipe tasted too strongly of pine nuts. Granted, I didn't have the various types of basil and just used whatever basil it is they sell at the farmer's market, but I had to add the juice of half a lemon (and I generally shy away from lemon juice in recipes as I think it can easily overwhelm the other flavors) to brighten up the overly nutty, and slightly over parmigiana taste of this pesto. Since it was a very thick pesto, the lemon also brought it down to the right consistency. It ended up fine, but definitely nothing special. Next time I might just buy the Whole Foods brand stuff and call it a day.

For a good pesto, would be better to use a mortar in marble, but If you dont have this, it is possible use a food processor on low speed to avoid overheating the basil leaves. Common mistake is replace the pine nuts with almonds, peanuts or cashew nuts. An Italian traditional dish with pesto are the "Trenette al pesto": http://www.academiabarilla.com/recipes/liguria/trenette-with-pesto.aspx

I'm hesitant to review this recipe because I had to make it in the blender due to my food processor not working so I'm not sure if what I ended up with is comparable to what this recipe intends. This also required me to make a few modifications. I only used italian basil because thats all I could find at the store and I also added the zest of a whole lemon plus a little juice. But the biggest change I think is I added at least a half a cup of olive oil - mainly because it was required for making it in the blender. This was an absolute mess to make but the flavor is just out of this world!!! Easily the best pesto I've ever made at home from scratch. What I ended up with was more of a pesto "paste" versus the gooey, oily concoction I'm more used to but it will be interesting to see how this turns out in my recipes. Garlic bread, added to cream for pasta sauce, chicken/shrimp dishes - I can't wait. The flavor is very intense but mine was not bitter at all and I honestly could have put in more garlic but I'm fine erring on the side of caution. I can always add garlic to whatever recipe I use this with if required. Also, I toasted the pine nuts and used a parm-romano blend that I can find pre-grated at the deli. I should also note that I halved this recipe and I have enough pesto to last me MONTHS. I rolled half of it into a log and also froze several single servings in pouches with my food sealer.

DO not know yet how to review, as i have not yet made it - but, the ingredients do not list "pepper" but the directions do - what gives?

Simply used straight bunch Basil leaves zest of 1 lemon along with garlic fresh ground pepper and olive oil. Only ever add cheese when Im preparing a meal or topping with the Pesto I never incorporate into the Pesto mix when i make it....much more flavourful freshly grated Parm. Try unslated peanuts fraction of the cost hard to tell the difference in texture or taste. If u want more pine flavour throw in a few pine needles to taste. Dont worry about oil volume as pesto is always bitter and I always cut it with Alio Olio when cooking or topping. Try also a touch of sugar works wonders. For a great Pesto Pasta sauce incorporate pesto woth some alio olio and chicken stock gives you a great smooth and subtle sauce.

I have been wanting to experiment with substituting California pistachio nuts for pine nuts and did so tonight with the garden's first bumper crop of basil. It was delicious. I recommend others try the substitution. Toast and measure the shelled pistachios just as you would pine nuts. A sweeter more delicate flavor and much less expensive dish!

Made this without the pine nuts, as a) didn't have any; and b) have an aversion to them (especially since hearing a radio report about a condition called "pine nut mouth" - no kidding - which causes one who has eaten completely normal-seeming, fresh pine nuts to suffer days or weeks where everything s/he eats has an awful taste). Anyway, used all lemon basil, and added the zest of one lemon, and it was very nice on whole wheat rotelle. Guess it's not a true pesto at all without the pine nuts, but thought it was worth putting it out there for anybody who has an allergy or otherwise avoids the nuts and still would like to enjoy pesto.

OMG - Crazy good. Make this! I only used reg basil leaves and added 3 pinches of lemon rind per other reviewers. Can't wait to add this to pizza, pasta and sauces.

Do not make this in a blender unless you reduce the amounts. I used a large Kitchenaid food processor to make the full amount, using only basil leaves. I needed to add appr. 1/2 of olive oil other wise it would have been too dry. I ended up with about 18 inches of rolled out pesto. I followed another the advice of another cook make a two foil rolls. I loved the idea of lemon-zest. I loved the taste and will have enough pesto to last a very long time. edit this note : this recipe has been added to your recipe box Do not make this in a blender unless you reduce the amounts.

Used mostly Italian basil with about half the parsley called for, plus about a cup of spearmint. Toasted the pignoli and added the lemon zest as suggested, and used much more Romano than Parm. Absolutely wonderful.

I made this with trepidation...don't have all those types of basil available at the market. So I made it with just regular Italian basil, and added a touch of lemon zest, as per a previous reviewer. Also toasted the pine nuts. The first taste seemed a touch bitter, but I let it sit for about 30 minutes. WOW. WONDERFUL. Yes, the small amount of oil makes it a denser, more solid pesto (you can't drizzle this stuff). But it is so delicious, it doesn't matter. We had it on caprese and on fried eggs (fresh from our hens). REALLY GREAT.

Absolutely fabulous pesto. Harvested my basil but had no lemon basil this year. I added a pinch of finely grated lemon zest and it worked out fine. This recipe makes a lot of thick pesto, so I made a roll about two inches in diameter, rolled it tightly in saran wrap and froze it in a plastic bag. Should be easy to slice off pieces this way. Can't wait to cook the pasta for dinner and to try it on bruschetta.

I forgot to add that I took the advice of the other reviewer and toasted the pine nuts first. The bomb.

I've been making pesto for years and love this one because it's very light on the olive oil. I used only 4 tbsp of oil and green and purple basil. The reduction in oil really made the basil shine. My whole family loved it including my picky 5 year old.

I was not able to find the three basils so just used regular bush basil and only the reggiano. I also toasted the pine nuts first which added a great flavour. You might also want to add a bit more olive oil depending on what you are using it for but this is one very fine Pesto.
