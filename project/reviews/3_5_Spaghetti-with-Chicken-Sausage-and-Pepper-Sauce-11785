We didn't have wine in the house, and having read the other reviews, it looked ok to skip it - so we did. It was absolutely delicious! I used hot Italian chicken sausage, which was perfect to go with the chicken.

Was a bit bland to me. Wasn't as tasty as I expected. May try it again, but I'm not sold.

this recipe was well-received by our guests, but required some doctoring and a lot more time than the recipe says. i skipped the red wine and, as other reviewers suggested, added crushed hot pepper flakes and fresh parmesan and romano cheeses to the sauce. it took almost two hours to prepare and reduce the sauce to the consistency i wanted. in all, this was good but not sensational. a sort of bland crowd pleaser.

if i were to make this again, i would try some of the additional ingredient suggestions to alter the recipe....i was extremely disappointed with the recipe as listed.

I didn't have chicken breast or italian sausage on hand, so I used tuckey bacon. I didn't use the heavy cream. I did use tomato sauce, tomato paste & diced tomatoes Italian style. It was perfect for this winter day. I will try it next time with the ingredients requested. Bob wants me to make it again.

This was very good. The presentation was so-so, but the flavor made up for it. Quality ingredients are a must.

My fiance made this for the first time after I found this recipe and suggested it. We used turkey sausage and chicken- liked having both meats in the sauce. We used extra garlic, and it actually added a lot of good flavor. I would recommend adding a little flour if you feel the sauce is too thin.

Simple and easy but also very good. I added hot pepper flakes and threw in some mushrooms but will probably leave out the sausage next time and double the amount of chicken instead.

I veered from the recipe only because I was dealing with what was in the kitchen at the time; the result was so delicious...instead of onion I had shallots, instead of green bell, orange. No chicken. Wine & cheese pork sausage (from Trader Joe's, mmm)casings removed. A box of baby grape tomatoes whirled in the blender. Fresh basil and no cream. I worried that it wouldn't work without the cream, but it was the best pasta sauce I've ever made!

What a terrific recipe! It's simple and delicious. I opted for mild Italian sausage and spiced it up a bit with crushed red pepper. I'll definitely serve this one for guests at the next opportunity.

This was an easy and delicious recipe! I added mushrooms and red pepper flakes and used penne pasta instead of sphaghetti. The recipe says it serves 2 but I served 4 people without changing any quantities. Will definitely make again!

So very, very tasty. A nice departure from regular spaghetti. My husband liked it, too.

Great basic recipe. I used andoulle sausage and a (really good!) jar of tomato sauce (I know, not very culinary but I had it on hand). I also used chicken tenders for the breasts and omitted the wine and sugar. Otherwise followed the recipe and it was wonderful. Served it with Bacon and Blue Cheese Salad with Caesar Dressing BA 10/1991 for a great and simple dinner.

I tripled the recipe (with a bit extra meat), and still served five adults and five (young) children! I used yellow and red peppers, and also sauteed the chicken first, then sauteed the vegetables in the same pan after removing the chicken to a warming platter. Easy to make with basic ingredients, and even my 3 little ones liked it! Definitely will make again

i made this recipe x6 and it was still really good. i used a couple of left over bay leaves and at my boyfriends request used over sized shell pasta.. i also put in an extra 1/2 cup of whipping cream because the recipe was so huge it didnt really make a caloric difference, just made the dish better... besides that stuff, i pretty much stuck to the recipe and it was very good and very popular, i would definitely make it again, it is so easy and a very good way to use up extra chicken breasts.. a very good dish that is very very easy

A delicious dish that is easy to prepare and really can be made in less than 45 minutes. I used fat free half-and-half instead of the cream (as mentioned in a previous review). I also left out the green pepper. This dish was such a big hit that you would never know how easy it was to prepare!

This is so simple and quick to make! Tastes great too! Used hot turkey Italian sausage...browned the chicken and sausage 1st then simmered with sauce. Also, used half and half instead of heavy cream. Delicious!!!

This sauce gets 4 forks for ease of preparation and taste -- a great weeknight meal. I left out the chicken because I used chicken sausage, which I took out of the casing. I browned the sausage and then threw in the veggies to brown. I chopped everything up very chunky so it had a rustic texture to it. I used three garlic cloves, added mushrooms and red pepper flakes because I like it spicy. Delicious and I will definitely make it again.

Wonderful! This dish was much better then I expected! Not only was this dish fairly inexpensive, but it was simple to make. i substituted dry sherry for the red wine because i ran out of red. my whole family loved it.

Although I made a few changes & doubled the recipe, this recipe was quick and delicious. My family loved it. I omitted the chicken, used hot sausage patties, crumbled, and fresh red & yellow tomatoes from the garden (I blanched them, removed the skins & chopped them). I added a bit more heavy cream to thicken and cooked it a bit longer. Fabulous. Will definitely make this again, & probably for guests as well. Great in the summer when all these veggies are abundant.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. We use our own homemade sausage. My Italian in-laws (big food critics) loved this one too.

Rating: 3
I did as others suggested: added lots more spice. My twist was instead of just plain can tomatoes I used tomatoes w/ green chilies (14.5 oz) and used Tony Chachere's seasoning. I also omitted the red wine and heavy cream. For our taste it didn't need it. I believe I will omit the chicken next time too. The sausage was excellent!

My husband loved this recipe. I did brown the sausage and chicken first, took them out of the pan, then sauteed the onions, garlic, and peppers. Then put the meat in with it and followed the rest of the recipe.

good but it is missing something to make it very good. I used crushed tomatoes as someone suggested. I put some tarragon in it and it made it better

This was an odd one. My husband and one year old (picky one year old) gobbled it up - but it just wasn't what I expected. I added mushrooms, as my daughter loves them. I think I overcooked it when the meat went in, because I am somewhat paranoid about meat being cooked thoroughly. I thought the cream would thicken it up much more than it did. Think I will give this another try and be more careful about overcooking it. The rest of the family like it so much it deserves a second try.

The dish goes together quick and without a lot of mess. I didn't have any red wine, so I used sherry, and I left the chicken out all together. I found the dish to be rather bland, and I don't think the cream was really needed. The sausage though was fantastic, and I'm going to try the method of boiling the sausage in the sauce in other recipes.

Quick and delicious. I loved the sauce sauce. Next time I'll probably just use sausage, but definitely great with the chicken too.

Rating: 2
We gave this 2 1/2 forks; it was good, but not great. Next time, we'll add crushed tomatoes instead of diced, for a thicker sauce. We did increase the spices, and added mushrooms, which helped. So, next time, 4 forks, for sure!

Another 1st time user! This meal was great - a nice change from the typical red sauce. I am not really a cook - so it took me a little longer to make then it says - I also took advise from others and added more spices. I would de-case the sausage next time - I find it easier to work with! Enjoy it!

This dish needs more then a four rating. I read all the reveiws then doubled the recipe and doubled it again. I did not use the chicken, I used red pepper not green and used 1/2 cup of heavy cream; I served it with penne this dish is truly wonderful. Kids and husband loved it. Fed all five of us with leftovers and froze the rest. Yummy,yummy,yummy

This dish was very popular with the family. I added a lb. of mushrooms and increased the basil and garlic. Warning: recipe says it feeds 2 so I doubled it. We could have fed the neighborhood.

Previous reviews indicated this recipe might need some spice, so I used hot merquez sausages and a 1/2 cup spicy prepared sauce to zip it up. I'll certainly do this again.

Healthful, and certainly easy, but dull. I'd give it a fork and a half it I could. Add hot sauce, perhaps. And cheese.

Great tasting and very quick and easy to make. My family loved it. Didn't have heavy cream, so I used half and half instead. Also had to substitute the sausage for Kielbasa. Will be cooking this one at least once a month at home! Thank you for another great one!
