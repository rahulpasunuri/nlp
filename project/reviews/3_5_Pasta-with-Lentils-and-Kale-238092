Boring.... I LOVE lentils & I enjoy Kale & I thought this should be good. There is NO taste to it other then what you add on your own. I used Jalapeno pepper ( last of the harvest )- I added some lemon juice - I added allspice ( should have added more ) I doubled the lentils - needed it. I will eat it - makes A LOT... but I removed it from my recipe box. It's OK... but it did not live up to the reviews that I read.

I'm not going to rate this because I changed an ingredient, but I want to share that I used Baby Kale (about 2/3-lb, roughly chopped, added at the same time as the pasta to the onions and lentils; kept mixing and folding until the kale was wilted - - about 4 mins). The final dish was quite "meh", I think it needs the punch of the bitter mature kale.

Excellent! I used collards instead of kale because that's what I had. Added a pinch of red pepper to the onions with great results. A perfect amount of sweet and spice. Cooked the lentils in half water, half chicken broth, as such used less salt. Rich with flavor and a great way to get greens-adverse people to give them a try. Passed around a bowl of grated parmesan reggiano for people to add at-will. This recipe will likely become a weeknight staple in my house. Easy, healthy, good.

This was great! We had late autumn kale in our garden that I wanted to use, and invited a neighbor to join my sweetie and me. Followed the recipe pretty much exactly - added red pepper flakes. And used Barilla Penne Pasta Plus, which has more protein. My sweetie grilled Italian sausages. All in all a healthy and tasty dinner. I'll make this even when the garden is dormant!

I tried this with red instead of green lentils. I cooked them gently in chicken broth. That was about the only salt this dish needed! Make sure to completely and gently caramelize the onions -- that is the kick in the dish. I also added a few drops of fresh lemon, lots of fresh ground black pepper, before adding the toasted breadcrumbs. This is a good, relatively guilt-free, satisfying dish.

This recipe deserves four forks from me at the very least because I learned how to make caramelized onions without burning them! It also looks beautiful and is delicious! I used regular curly kale. Before the pasta was ready I was ravenously eating the lentil-kale mixture out of the pot! I had a bit extra of lentils, kale, and pasta, but I forgot to add extra onions. So on the second day I made extra (original amount) to add at will. The onions really boost the flavour and I would strongly recommend making extra (leftovers can be used for garnishing a variety of Iranian soups known as "aash" [hint, hint]). I tried adding a bit of nutritional yeast at the table but I found this to drown out the delicate flavours so I don't recommend it.

I was hesitant to make this dish b/c it's the first time i've ever tried to cook with kale and it sounded too healthy to taste good. That being said, I wanted to use a whole grain instead of the pasta, so instead of the pasta, I ended up mixing in brown rice. Not only did I love it, but my friends who were invited over for dinner loved it too... and one of them told me ahead of time that she hates kale AND lentils! Well, I have now made her such a believer in both that she asked me to send her the recipe!! I served this with an oven roasted chicken breast prepared with garlic and lemon which complimented it quite well. This recipe is definitely being added into the rotation!

This dish is delicious! I added sundried tomatoes as others suggested. I also cut up one large sweet potato in cubes and tossed it into the boiling kale water after removing kale. I cooked them until they were close to done then put in pasta. The pasta I used was Trader Joes Vegetable Radiatore. Yum!

Wow - Awesome! I was so skeptical of this recipe thinking it would lack a lot of flavor. However, I still tried it b/c of all the good reviews. I followed recipe pretty much exactly, but cooked lentils with a bay leaf and some fresh rosemary. Topped with a little breadcrumb & parmesan cheese. It turned out super delicious! My entire family (who usually hates my healthy cooking) loved it! This is a keeper!

Delicious--a simple, exceptionally easy dish with unexpectedly rich, robust flavor. It has become a standby in our home--with a couple of time-saving changes. I caramelize the onion, then toss in the uncooked lentils and a bit of pasta water and let them begin to cook. I then add the kale right in, without precooking, and let it steam with the onions and lentils. Whatever you do, don't skimp on the time spent caramelizing the onions. This dish is especially good tossed with shredded smoked chicken and a pinch of dried red pepper flakes.

Yum! My husband totally poo-pooed this recipe upon hearing the description; he thought I was just trying to make one of my super healthy dinners, but he was more than pleasantly surprised with the results. I think he co-opted most of the leftovers. The caramelized onions definitely are key, so really be sure to start with a ton (a bit more than the recipe calls for) and let them cook low and slow. The sweetness of the onions complements the earthiness of the lentils and kale perfectly, making for a scrumptious and hearty veg meal. Delicious and super healthy!

yum...added carrot, onions, bay leaf, thyme to cooking lentils (didn't have celery), pinch of red chili flakes. Also added sundried tomatoes to the kale and lentil mix for sweetness. I could only find green kale. Had it with whole wheat pasta, nuttiness of pasta went great with the puy lentils - a keeper!

loved this dish! combined two things I love - kale and lentils. I also added carrot to the onion, a little thyme and also added fresh turkey sausage for some added protein. Used multi-grain pasta bows and was so good!

This was really quite good. I already had the lentils prepared, used whole wheat pasta, and substituted rapini instead of kale. I also used bread crumbs as a garnish to keep the recipe vegan. Definitely will make again.

I listened to the reviewers and added carrot, celery, bayleaf to lentils, cooked pasta in kale water, doubled the onions to 2 large ones and was sure to cook them slow and sweet...Extremely healthy - brought it to vegan friends at the hospital while their mom/grandma was dying knowing they couldn't order out vegan food easily - who knew I could cook vegan with such delicious results! They all wanted the recipe, even the non vegans. The grated cheese and drizzled good olive oil is a yummy finish. Kale is a superfood and very helpful in protecting vs macular degeneration. A keeper recipe.

Really good! If we make it again, we would use more lentils, probably double, or reduce kale to about 1/2 lb. Add white wine too?

Great recipe. I cooked the lentils in chicken stock and threw the Kale in with the lentils instead of boiling them in water. Also used a small amount of minced garlic, which gave it a nice dimension. Would certainly make again.

This dish is amazing. I made it as the recipe calls for. I know several people cut back on the oil, but it seemed fine for me and is important if you will have left overs. The onions did take a bit longer than stated but worth the time. I used brown rice pasta for a little more nutrition and highly recommend it. It has the same taste and texture as regular pasta with more fiber and protein. This dish rescued me from some intestinal distress while on vacation. It's an amazing body balancer (at least for me).

Rating: 4
This has become a staple meal in my household over the past few months. I've made it with a few different varieties of kale as well as swiss chard, and it's reliably tasty and healthy. It's also excellent with brown rice if you're not a fan of (or avoiding) pasta. It's easy to vary the dish a little by adding some toasted pinenuts, currants or raisins, and chevre. A splash of balsamic vinegar and a little thyme are both good additions, too. This is a good, reliable weeknight recipe -- I can get this on the table within an hour.

This is absolutely lovely if the onions are caramelized properly! Like many here have said, spending the time on those onions is the real trick. I didn't know how to caramelize an onion before attempting this recipe. I used this guide to teach myself, and it's really helpful: http://simplyrecipes.com/recipes/how_to_caramelize_onions/. I also add sausage to this dish (it doesn't necessarily need it; I just like it that way).

Delicious. I forgot to save the lentil cooking liquid and the pasta water, so we just used this as a topping for our whole wheat pasta. It also reheated easily the next day. The onions definitely make the dish taste wonderful, and the lentils add a nice texture.

I have been using recipes from epicurious.com for years, but this recipe prompted me to sign in and leave a review. This is so delicious and impossible to mess up. I burned the onions, overcooked the kale, used whole wheat penne, and it is still delicious. A perfect meal.

I am surprised by the people who feel the need to make extensive changes to this recipe. This is one of the few that is perfect the way it is. Extremely flavorful despite the fact that it is only seasoned with salt and pepper. This combination of ingredients just works really well. It is a great recipe to make a big batch Sunday night and then have leftovers all week. That said, to make it a hearty standalone vegetarian meal, I like to double the amount of lentils.

So delicious! We used mild Italian pork sausage and added 2 cups of chopped kale for the last 4 minutes. The whole jalapeno added a good kick, and the lemon juice made it taste really fresh. I put a dollop of light sour cream on top for come creaminess. The depth of flavor was amazing, definitely the best soup I've made all winter.

A yummy, healthy & easy winter night meal. I made some changes to keep it simpler: Added chunks of chicken sausage that I sauteed, then removed. Caramelized the onions, and added garlic & the kale to the pan at the end, with a little olive oil. Used whole wheat spaghetti that I tossed into the pan (cooked), along with pre-cooked lentils from Trader Joe's, and the sausage. A little extra olive oil, salt & pepper, and some Parmesan cheese & I was done! Seemed easier & a little more flavorful than the original recipe. I liked it!

great pasta, terrific ingredients, and quite simple and relaxing to make. does take time, but it's a very methodical, unrushed type of recipe. i do think there needs to be a little garlic in here somewhere, though... it's just not a perfect recipe, but it's pretty darn good.

Rating: 2
Seemed kind of bland. We added some red pepper flakes and freshly shredded asiago and parmesan cheese. I cut some corners with the cooking times and steps, so some of the problem might have been that the onions weren't completely caramelized. The lentils were a great addition, but I think I prefer our usual spaghetti and kale recipe. If I do it again, I'll be more careful with the onion.

Rating: 4
We thought this was delicious and we're not all that crazy about Kale! I did cook the lentils in chicken broth rather than water and added the bay leaf. And I broke spaghetti into pieces because I forgot the penne. Other cooks are totally right--the key is the carmelized onions.

Delicious but time consuming to make.

Making this dish was one of the best things I have done lately. Eating it was even better! Even my boyfriend who only 'tolerates' kale and lentils loved it. The secret is to be patient with the onions. Take a deep breath and let them caramelize properly, it takes a little time but soo worth it! YUMMMY!!

Rating: 4
A great way to use kale--very tasty! I made a few changes: as others recommended, I added thyme to the onions, bay leaf to the lentils, and the chopped carrot. I also substituted barley for pasta (just because we eat so much pasta already) and added some chopped dried mushrooms that had been plumped up in a cup of very hot water. I will also definitely try it with whole wheat pasta sometime.

Took others suggestions and simmered the lentils with two bay leaves, added some dried thyme to the onions, and added some crumbled feta cheese to the finished dish. Sprinkled grated parmesan on top and my husband and I thought it was a winner. Definitely adding this to my "kale" dish list!

It wasn't horrible, but it was bland as all get out. There was a lot more effort put in than flavor coming out, that's for sure. Even taking into account recommendations for spices, extra flavoring sauces, chili, etc., it still lacked substance. Won't make again.

This is such a great meatless dish. I've made is many times, using curly green kale when I couldn't find the Tuscan variety, canned navy beans when I didn't have lentils, and added mushrooms and garlic to the onions. The description is so true - let the onions get all nice and brown - scrumptious!

I wanted to welcome in fall, and try out cooking with Kale, since I really never had. I really liked the comments from everyone and did add in a few suggestions..Added the thyme, bay leaves and carrot to the lentils, caramelized the onion with butter/o.o and then left out the pasta and just simmered the cooked kale in with the onions and tossed in the lentils. Delish! I loved this and plan on making it again! I doubled the lentils and would leave out the pasta for a healthier alternative..and of course, you could cut the o.o and butter in half to really slim it down. My friends loved it too.

This dish is amazing the day after making it. It's great hot, but I love it much more when I'm having it for lunch the next day. It takes timing and coordination to make it right, but it's worth it. I've made it more than a few times and still need to read the directions as I cook. I also doubled the onion once because they are what adds all the flavor and it was excellent.

Really good and fairly simple to prepare. The lentils gave both a heartiness and a distinctive flavor to the dish. I do think there's room in this recipe for some extra flavor -- fresh thyme or sage, in particular, might be a good touch.

I know, I know. Lentils and pasta? Tuscan kale and a bunch of onions? What a strange combination! Trust me, I was thinking the same thing and was skeptical up until the moment I tasted it. This was amazing, loads of good taste, and was pretty simple. The few modifications I made were to cook the lentils with 2 bay leaves and 1 peeled carrot (discarded after cooked) for more flavor. I also added 2 minced cloves of garlic to the onion at the end of cooking. And if you don't like kale, I think you can include it anyway because Tuscan kale has a mild taste compared to the curly kind. Plus, all the other flavors overpower it so you'll just get vitamins from it without the taste you may not like. I highly recommend this dish. Very weird but very , very yummy!

I was looking for more of a vegetable side dish, so I omitted the pasta increased the onions slightly and doubled the amount of lentils. I cooked the onions according to the directions in a very large pan, plus added 1/4 tsp thyme (took about 45 min). I cooked the lentils (with bay leaf and salt) as directed while the onions carmelized. I then added the lentil cooking liquid to the onions along with the kale and cooked for about 10 minutes with the lid on. Finally, I added the lentils at the end along with some lemon juice and salt. I thought this method cut down on the amount of pans necessary. I only used two pans (one for lentils, one for onions). My 3 and 5 year old both said it was good. I thought it was great. Even without the pasta, a meal in itself.

When I saw this recipe - it looked a little boring but i had all the ingredients already so I made it out of convenience.

I was looking for a recipe with Kale and came across this one over a year ago. It is outstanding, with a wonderful earthy flavor. I'm a vegetarian and this has become a staple. My 17 month old daughter gobbles up the kale pieces...she loves it! I always add a little more onion because I love the flavor, and a little more lentils for an extra protein boost. About 2 1/2 cups of onion and 3/4 cups of lentils.

Delicious! For some reason I didn't expect this to be that good, I just wanted a quick vegetarian supper. We were digging for thirds. I used frozen spinach for the kale since I didn't have the kale and bf hates it - it was perfect. The caramelized onions give the dish such a rich taste. I will make again!!

This surprised me, I thought it would be a healthy dish, but it was really tasty. I followed the other recommendations and added a bay leaf to the lentils and fresh thyme. I also used I trick I learned at a cooking class, for failproof caramelized onions, use half olive oil and half butter and let it cook on low, for about 30 minutes, stirring infrequently. Lastly, I drizzled an lemon-infused olive oil over the top and served with parm. Will make it again!

This is a great dish. It's not difficult at all - simply takes some time and a couple of pots. I think that the folks who didn't like the dish probably didn't follow the directions concerning salt. It is a key seasoning in this piece (along with the onions). I used the thyme and bayleaf and I added tons of pepper and measured the salt accordingly. I also added about 1/2 teaspoon salt to the kale/pasta water, which I think is quite important. I will definitely make this again with my local kale.

Oh my. This was fantastic. I think the reviewers that didnt like it must haev under- caramelized the onions and not seasoned it enough.

Both my husband and I liked this dish very much. As earlier cooks suggested, I added half a bay leaf to the lentils and two teaspoons of chopped, fresh thyme to the onions. Since much of this dish's flavor comes from the caramelized onion, I used two yellow onions rather than one. This would be a great main dish to serve to your vegetarian and meat-eating friends alike. I'll definitely make this again. Note: The lentils took 35 minutes and the onion nearly 40 minutes to cook.

What a wonderful earthy flavor! I did add a bay leaf to the lentils and thyme to the onions as suggested. I also added about 1C chopped Honey Baked Ham left over from Christmas - yum! Just to simplify things, I chopped the kale right after I removed the ribs, and added it to the onion and lentils to wilt. If you want the full flavor of this dish, it's absolutely necessary to let the onions carmelize!

This is really good in a stick-to-your-ribs pasta-e-fagioli kind of way. I used pink lentils instead of green with no discernible ill effects, and I followed the excellent suggestions to put bay leaf in the lentils and thyme in the onions -- thank you, Epicureans!

The ingredients in this recipe are some of my favorites, but I wasn't super impressed - I may have need to cook the onions even longer. I did think it tasted better as leftovers the next day.

I am also very surprised of the ratings that state these ingredients don't work well together. I have made this recipe over 5 times now and LOVE it each time. My wife and I love this healthy, easy recipe and it tastes delicious. We actually made this for her family and they absolutely loved it. Haven't found one person that we have made this for that hasn't like it! I will use some of the tips and add thyme to onions and bay leaf to lentils. Thank you!

I, too, am a little surprised by the negative reviews on the site. The predominant flavors are obviously the lentils and carmelized onions. So, if you don't like lentils or don't properly carmelize the onions, you might be disappointed, but for the rest of us. Mmm... I did add a bay leaf to the lentils and some dried thyme to the onions. Oh, and to the person who thought the pasta water made a bad sauce, it's not supposed to. You add the water to thicken the existing sauce and keep the pasta moist. By the time you serve it, it should not be watery. This recipe is a serious keeper. It was hearty, very healthy, and delicious. My boyfriend had thirds.

Rating: 4
I'm a little confused as to why other reviewers have been lukewarm on this; it's fabulous! But you really can't skimp on ingredients--use French green lentils, fresh kale, a good extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle with a quality parm. And don't try to hurry the onions, to get that amazing sweet, caramelized flavor, you need to sweat them for a long time on lowish heat. I think the people who didn't like this might not have used great ingredients??? Anyway, I've made this several times for guests and everyone loved it!

I used a mixture of Kale & Swiss chard. Like other users suggested I added a bay leaf to the lentils and added thyme & oregano to the onions. My husband mentioned that some cooking wine would have been good too. I also made the breadcrumb topping and sprinkled shredded parmesan on it. It turned out tasting ok but it sure wasn't worth all the work! It uses a lot of pans and takes a long time. If it were easier I might make it again.

I was excited for this recipe, but upon tasting it, VERY disappointed. The cooking water is a bland excuse for a sauce. I don't think the caramelized onion flavor comes through at all, and the recipe, while a great base to build a more enticing dish upon, is a complete failure. I will be featuring an updated version soon on my blog, www.freshcrackedpepper.com

I altered the recipe a little. I used small french brown lentils, collards, and cooked some carrots with the lentils. I garden and wanted to use the carrots, collards, and onions from my garden. Also, I used a brown rice medley - since I wasn't in the mood for pasta. It was AWESOME!

This recipe has become a standard in my house with a few minor additions. It requires a little extra spice, in my opinion, but it can be easily turned into a delicious vegan dish. I used red onion for more color and vitamins, penne that had been fortified with omega-3 (that new Barilla Plus stuff is good), a bay leaf in the lentils, fresh thyme while sauteeing the onions, a little oregano, and nutritional yeast instead of cheese. I also slightly undercooked the pasta even more than usual, and that allowed it to retain its al dente nature during the heating. It is absolutely delicious, and a very well-balanced, triangulated meal either for vegans or just for someone who wants a little break from eating too much meat and dairy products.

i make a very similar dish, using just one pot instead of 3-4. the only ingredient difference is that i use brown rice for the starch instead of pasta, which i cook along with the lentils. also, i saute the onions first, then cook the lentils in that same pot (with the onions, so that the flavors meld.) i add the greens (i've used both chard and kale) towards the end. so much easier! though i suppose you do save time by caramelizing the onions at the same time that the lentils are cooking.

This was pretty forgettable, in addition to being a pain in the neck. All the ingredients have to be cooked separately, so you end up with a lot of balls in the air at once, and a lot of dishes. It was okay but not worth the trouble. Probably would be better with chard instead of kale.
