The 2 people who gave this a poor review didn't make this recipe... why do they bother commenting? Rich creamy avocados, such as Choquette or Doni (or Haas, if you must), want the acidic contrast or they go flat after a bite or two. This is an excellent preparation if you have the good avocado.

Way too much red wine vinegar - I like adding 2 medium tomatoes sliced in wedges plus 1 tablespoon capers to provide the acidity; and increase EVOO to 3 tablespoons.

Great salad for a cuban meal. The pickled red onion was a great counterpoint to the avocado. My guests really liked it!

Nothing to rave about. The vinegar was overpowering, although I did marinate the onions for 2 or 3 hours.

I'm a terrible cook and this is amazing and easy! You basically can't go wrong. I think having a good red wine vinegar helps. Seriously delicious. Will become a go-to dish.
