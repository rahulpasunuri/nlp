Simple and delicious. Didn't have mango nectar so found a recipe for it and used that.

I have made this cake numerous times and now have my substitutions down pat. I use coconut milk instead of the mango nectar and add some crystallized ginger to the batter. The coconut adds a lovely richness and does not overpower. Yum!

I should have heeded the other reviews! I followed the directions exactly and had a terrible result. Cake looked great but was soggy and pudding like. Won't do again.

AMAZING! It was so moist and flavorful. The best cake I have had in a long time. I love how the top cut nice and crispy around the edges. I used mango from a can.

I don't understand when someone says a cake is "too sweet." Nothing is worse than a bland-tasting cake. This cake is perfect. It's moist and delicate yet bold and bursting with flavor. I didn't have mango nectar so I used mango marmalade that I had made the day before with fresh mangos from my tree. It was excellent. I'm definitely making this one again.

i used a filipino brand of mango nectar since it didn't have hfcs. Also I used frozen mangoes - it was awesome. Lots of rave reviews.

Really loved it. Made it for work and everyone thought it was great. Easy way to use up left over or not great mango. I cut the butter in the cake part in half. And used mango puree as suggested in other review.

This is very good and easy; I've used canned mango which makes it easier. It goes well with my Caribbean menu of jerked chicken, pigeon peas, plantains, etc.

I was not very enthusiastic to do this recipe because what some reviewers said. For the topping I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup because mangos here are quite sweet. I also reduced the sugar to 2/3 cup for the batter. The result was amazing. It was really easy to make and there was nothing left of it. I served it with vanilla ice cream. It was a great hit. I made it again and replaced the mangoes with pieces of pineapple and added pineapple juice to the batter. This turned out more moist and creamy than the mango one, but equally delicious.

This was a visually attractive cake, but nothing special to eat. We made it as directed, mango puree from squeezed and chopped fruit. It was very sweet. Maybe tamirind, or something to offset the sugar and sweet mangos could make it better.

I was about to use canned mangoes when I read the reviewer who suggested blueberries. Had some wild ones in the freezer from last summer. Absolutely delicious! I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup and that was perfect for my taste.

The cake was delicious. The mango topping tasted oddly. I would use the cake recipe again but with a different fruit.

No, no. I won't be making this again. Call me lazy, but it took far too much time for a mediocre result. The poor mangoes lost all of their magic here; they were killed twice: first with a serious overdose of sugar and again when they were cooked. Even after reducing the sugar in the batter to 3/4 cup, this recipe was just sweet. I agree with another poster: mangoes should just be eaten raw. They cannot be improved upon by cooking them. I can see the logic of a pineapple upside down cake far better: there is a balance between the acid in the fruit and the sugar in the recipe. There is no balance in this mango recipe. Having some left over batter, I plunked it in another cake pan, put some blueberries on top, sprinkled with about a tablespoon of sugar and a bit of cinnamon and baked it. This "accidental" cake was preferred to the one I set out to make. If you want a mango dessert, peel 2 or 3, put them in the blender with about a cup of heavy cream, sugar to taste and one envelope of unflavored gelatine previously dissolved in a bit of water. Blend and refrigerate.

I love it! The cake is moist and delicious. I do agree with another reviewer that this cake may not do justice to really good mangoes - in the future I'd use canned/frozen/not-so-good fruit. Instead of dirtying another pot, I melted the butter and sugar in the baking dish while the oven was preheating.

Beautiful to look at, but ... once inverted the juices from the sugar-glaze the center of the cake became mango pudding. Yuck!

I read that mangoes were in season and decided to peruse mango dessert recipes and came across this one. What an absolutely delightful cake. The cake itself is light and sweet and the mangoes were so much nicer than the traditional pineapple upside-down cake. I'll definitely make it again and will use some of the suggestions offered for something a little different.

After popping this in the oven, while cleaning up the kitchen, I found the bowl with the SECOND HALF OF THE FLOUR sitting on my island!! After a bit of equivocating, I decided to pull the cake out of the oven and fold the flour in. You'd never know it, the cake turned out great! Still, it needed a little something more to get 4 stars rather than 3. I sprinkled some chopped pistachios on top, which provided a nice crunch and color. Maybe my mangoes were too sweet, because the flavor wasn't complex enough, just sweet (I did use Kern's mango nectar). Maybe next time I'll use regular salted butter and dark brown sugar. And perhaps a dash of chinese five spice powder or cardomom.

This cake was wonderful. I made it for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I found lots of mango juice, but no nectar (being a novice cook I do not know the difference). As such, I simply took the pits and skins from the mangoes and squeezed them by hand to make the nectar myself. This worked great. The nice thing about this cake is it is not overly sweet. It is light and moist. The topping is lovely. I will make it again.

I thought this was yummy and pretty, especially for how easy it was. The cake was a very good match for fruit--slightly less dense than pound cake; it could even be served as coffee cake. Also used mango puree instead of nectar. However, if you have very high quality mangos, as I did, I agree with the reviewer below that this dessert does not do them justice. I'll make it again, but when I only have canned or cheap fruit.

I made this recipe because we have had a lot of mangoes this season and it was wonderful. My daughter does not like them and she loved the cake. I followed the recipe step by step and it turned out great.

Made first time with following modifications, frozen mango chunks, tossed all three eggs into the batter. Came out amazing. So good we ate it all before Easter, so I made another, this time trying more healthy alternatives, only egg whites and half the fat and sugar in batter. Definitely not worth it. Stick with the full fat version

I have made this for three different dinner parties, and keep getting requests to bring it again. I use Trader Joes Mango Sauce instead of the nectar and it works great.

Absolutely delicious cake. I added blueberries like the other cooks suggested which really added alot to the cake. Very impressive looking too.

This recipe requires a lot of work considering that it uses the most delectable fruit on the planet (good by itself) I am not sure the recipe does the mango justice. Maybe if there weren't so many steps in the recipe.

Easy & delicious. Added fresh blueberries, too. As previously mentioned, I had no nectar, so pureed some of the mango

Have made it three times. Easier and BETTER way...put generous pats of butter all over bottom of oven proof skillet. Iron or Caphalon is great. Lay down any kind of fruit (I used mangos, blackberries and raspberries, mixed). Sprinkle with brown sugar. Make batter as stated. Pour over fruit,etc. When removed from oven turn onto plate almost immediately. Some fruit sticks to skillet...you can see where it goes on cake. ALWAYS heat a little in micro to serve. I can't make enough to keep up with requests.

My sister and I made this cake, twice. The first cake we made according to the recipe. It turned out great, and my friends loved it. The second cake we used cake flour instead of AP flour, put the mango pieces on the bottom of the pan then poured the sugar and butter mixure on top of it. That cake turned out good too. We also served the cakes with wipped cream that had mango purey in it. Very good. I perfer the acctual recipe to our doctored one. All in all, a great cake.

I came across this recipe whilst I'm quite unwell; the reviews made me more delirious so I was determined to make it. No nectar of any kind so I just mango pureed the softer bits up to its needed amount. Didn't beat butter & sugar till fluffy - too weak. So melted the butter and beat the sugar with it, added whole eggs beaten together and followed the rest of steps. So worried in case didn't turn out right but it did! Only thing missing was cream, which I'll buy later for my afternoon tea, *wink*. Yummy.

Easy and delicious comfort food. French vanilla ice cream is too good on top.

I've never made an upside down cake before, but it turned out wonderfully. The topping was scrumptious. The cake was dense, moist, and buttery. I used peach nectar like the other reviewers suggested, but I wish I had stuck with the mango nectar. I was hoping for a stronger, sweeter mango taste.

Rating: 3
Great recipe! The cake came out fluffy and delicious. Its better to use mangoes that are not so ripe so that they are easier to handle and so that they do not become too sweet when mixed with the sugar and butter. Will definitely make again.

A very nice dessert treat. I made a different mango upside down cake recipe recently and tried this one to compare the two. This one wins the prize! The cake itself was very tender and fluffy. As a previous reviewer, I also used peach nectar. Although it's a nice touch, the flavor of the nectar doesn't stand out (but it's a fun idea so I'm going to keep using it; maybe trying other nectar flavors). Position those mangoes in a pretty arrangement in the pan and you'll get "oohs" and "ahhhs" when you present this cake! A dusting of powdered sugar over the cake and whipped cream on the side would finish it off nicely.

My first time ever using fresh mangoes, and this recipe turned out perfectly. I used it for a gourmet club dessert, and it was very well received. I will definitely make it again, and will probably try different variations with different fruits and nectars.

This cake was outstanding. I used fresh mangos and peaches. I used peach's nectar instead of mango's. I decorated with cherries on top. My family and I ate this cake in two evenings. We loved it and it is very easy to make. I hardly recommend it.

A little labor intensive but worth the effort. I think it would do well with a little whipped topping just to jazz it up a bit.

I also think this is nothing special and was disappointed. The mango part was good but the cake was very plain, even with the nectar as the liquid. Won't make again.

I haven't tried this recipe with mangos, yet. However, I made a few of these cakes with canned pineapples (in their own juice, no sugar added). I took the cakes to a rehab house full of guys and everyone loved them! No one ate just one slice. To make the Pineapple Upside-Down cake: substitute the mango slices for canned pineapple chunks, and the mango nectar for the juice in which the pineapple chunks came in.

A light fluffy cake, made with relative ease. I served it to guests at a luncheon, although it was recieved with appreciation I felt it was nothing spectacular. I would make it again, but would use it as a casual treat for family at home.

The cake was easy to make and baked beautifully in the allotted time. I served it with some fresh whipped cream. It was loved by the entire family - even those not fond of mangos!

I liked this recipe; it was relatively simple to put together. I peeled and sliced the mangos the night before, and added a touch of allspice to the brown sugar mix. It was a big hit with my guests. The only problem was the top of the cake cooked too rapidly, so I had to cover it with foil for 10-12 minutes to give the center of the cake a chance to cook.
