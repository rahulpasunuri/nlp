Absolutely one of the best things I've ever made. I did the first part on the stovetop and then transferred all into a tagine in the oven at 325 for about an hour. I doubled the ginger and added canned artichokes, but otherwise made it pretty much as written. no problems with bitterness due to the lemon, maybe because I sliced it super thin. fantastic, and not excessively difficult. Took about 2 hours start to finish. Yum.

Followed recipe exactly and the result was a very bitter tasting vegetable mixture because of the whole sliced lemon - the forkfuls that included a piece of rind were inedible. Perhaps preserved lemon might have been better. I noticed that some reviewers added more sweetness which I agree would have helped.

This is a great base recipe for a tagine but requires some tinkering. I doubled all the spices and sub'd low sodium chicken broth for water as the others suggested. But there are a few other things you can do to make the dish exceptional and full of flavor. 1) Use skinless dark chicken ON the bone. The bone has a tremendous amount of flavor that transfers to the tagine. Also the dark meat holds the spice better; 2) Dry rub the chicken with cinnamon, ginger, cumin, tumeric, salt and pepper and let it sit for 30min+; 3) Brown chicken before it goes in pot; 4) Add quartered turkish apricots when you add the carrots (they have some sugar that balances the spices); 5) Add a tsp of lemon zest; 6) Add 1-2 tbsp of sugar at very end - eliminates any bitterness and helps balance the dish and all the various components. I served the tagine over an authentic couscous with hot peppers in it. Delish!

I doubled the spices as other reviewers suggested, but it was still extraordinarily bland. Imposingly, voluminously, aggressively bland - like eating a variety of tasteless yet interestingly textured shapes. I could taste chickpea and mint, that's it. The vegetables did turn out perfectly cooked with great texture. But I am utterly confounded as to what happened to all the flavor from the spices... I've made successful chicken tagines in the past using other recipes. It's not that the flavor was subtle here, it was just absent. I suppose using chicken broth & preserved lemon might help, but I won't be trying again.

This is a delicious recipe! The only modifications I made were to brown the chicken before browning the onions and garlic, and replacing the lemon slices with chopped preserved lemon. Otherwise, an excellent dish, and very good served over couscous.

I used this recipe yesterday, and it was an absolute smash with my dinner guests. Like many of the other reviewers, I doubled all spices except the cayenne pepper (including garlic and ginger) and used a large vidalia onion. I used 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth and 3 Tb of lemon juice instead of whole lemon slices. Next time I might add some lemon zest for an added kick. Instead of bone-in chicken pieces I used boneless breasts (7), and I added 1/2 cup of sliced green olives and 1/2 cup of golden raisins near the end of cooking. The stew was absolutely delicious.

Rating: 2
This turned out very bitter for me -- so much so, that I'm surprised more reviewers aren't commenting on the same issue. If I were to make this again I would definitely use the lemon zest and the fruit only, and discard the white pith. Or I would use preserved lemons.

Served this for company, and it was very well- received. Agree, recipe makes a lot....not a problem, b/c the leftovers are fabulous. I used all boneless skinless chicken thighs, peeled/cubed sweet potatoes rather than chickpeas, no green beans, no cayenne but rather a couple of tsp of hot pepper jelly, low salt chicken broth in place of water, and did all spices 1.5X. Also added red peppers for flavor and color. Served over couscous, with bowls of chopped mint, chopped cilantro, and toasted slivered almonds on table to be added as desired. Super!

Agree that this is textured and unusual-- really enjoyed it, and so did my houseguest who is very tough to please when it comes to cooking. Didn't have enough chickpeas so added some canned pintos and it worked well. Part of me wants double the spices but on the other hand maybe it's supposed to subtle and not like a hot curry. Anyway, I'll try a sweet tagine next.

Rating: 0
I agree all spices except cayenne could be increased. What I like about this (and my teenager liked it too) was how texturally complex it was. Green beans, carrots, garbanzo, chicken, tomatoes; and I served with a small amount of brown rice though not necessary if you are holding back on grains. Plenty of fiber in this dish without.

Just made this for friends. It was great. Doubled the spices. I think next time I will 1.5 the spices rather than double. Tastes great with rice too and I agree with the wine rec, had a nice South American Syrah with it, very nice.

This is good but not fabulous. I made it exactly as written and should have listened to others' suggestions to double the spices (but not the cayenne). It tasted a little one-note to me. I think what's missing is the characteristic sweet that could come from raisins or apricots. I will try adding some of these next time.

Rating: 2
This recipe needs to up the spices to 1 1/2 teaspoons also water should be replaced with chicken broth and a cinnamon stick should be used rather than ground along with preserved lemons for an authentic taste. The cilantro should be added at the end to bring out it's a fresh flavor. I also seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper,cumin,tumeric,lemon juice and marinated it for at least 30 minutes then quickly brown before adding it to the stewed mixture.

I made this dish Friday night for Shabbat dinner for my husband, my brother-in-law and my dad...I have to say, it was AMAZING!!! Everyone loved it and has been talking about it for days! Leftovers were fantastic! I agree, definitely double the spices, and instead of water, I used chicken stock and still felt it could use a bit more salt...the recipe doesn't call for salt at all. Otherwise, I can't say enough good things about this dish. The aromas alone from the kitchen made us desperate for dinner for hours! I served it with a side of the Curried Couscous also from this website, the result was just show-stopping!!

Rating: 4
I think the spices in here worked really well. I did add a little extra cinnamon, and substituted sweet potato for the chickpeas. I was going to be busy all day but had an hour in the morning, so I sauteed the onions, garlic, and ginger with the spices, then threw in the sweet potatoes, tomatoes, and carrots, and dumped it all in the slow cooker. I skinned chicken thighs, placed those on top, and added about 3/4 c chicken broth rather than the 2 c water it calls for. Cooked on low for about 7 hours, with great results. After it was done I reduced the cooking liquid in a small pan on the stovetop for about 10 minutes to make a thicker sauce, and topped it all with fresh mint (essential in my opinion). I served it over israeli couscous. It made wonderful leftovers for lunch the next day -- several colleagues wanted to know what the delicious smell was coming from the microwave!

Colorful, very healthy, simple and quick to prepare, relatively inexpensive -- and, most importantly, delicious. Most of the ingredients were already in my kitchen, and I was glad to find a use for cilantro stems, which I usually discard. This recipe will become a regular.

Followed the suggestion to double the spices, then used half the recommended amount of lemon and used cubes of roasted pumpkin instead of chickpeas. The result was really nice, with the sweetness of the pumpkin balancing the tartness of the lemon perfectly. I will definitely use this recipe as a guideline again in the future

I love this dish! All the chopping is a little time-consuming, but it is well worth the effort. I have to say, it's much better than the tagines I've had at Moroccan restaurants - and I don't even use a tagine! Serve with Moroccan mint tea, and you have a perfect midwinter meal.

I made similar alterations to the recipe (doubled spices, increased lemon) and I added about a 1/2 cup of honey. The honey gave depth and complexity to the flavor, and made the dish amazing! This will definitely become a staple dish.

If you are a fan of more traditional uses of these flavors you may find the dish under spiced. I would atleast double all ground spices and lemon, increase the amount of chicken stock that is called for and spend the time to reduce it before adding the chicken. The recipe is a great group of ingredients but is weak on porportions to deliver the best flavors....a waterdowned version of a traditional tagine.

My husband and I made this the other night, served it over couscous and absolutely LOVED it!!! We cut the recipe in half since it's just the two of us and we wished we hadn't so we could have had more leftovers to enjoy. After reading the reviews we did change it up a bit . For the halved recipe, we used 1 lemon in total - we thinly sliced half of it and cut out all the pith, but still added the zest. We then added one slightly thicker slice, pith and all, and the juice of the other half (a little less than a tablespoon). We used chicken broth instead of the water and doubled all the spices except for the cayenne. Make sure you salt the chicken before you add it, we forgot and added about a 1/2 teaspoon before simmering and we still had to salt it quite a bit on the plate. We served the mint on the side so we could add it to our own tastes - my husband liked a little, I liked a lot. Don't omit anything - the complexities of the flavors are just right! We actually found ourselves excited the next day in anticipation of eating the leftovers. This one is a keeper for sure!!

Rating: 4
This is great! A really fabulous flavour. The trick to not having any bitterness - is NOT to exclude the lemon or decrease the amount, but make sure you cut off as much of the pith (that white stuff between the skin and the lemon flesh) as you can. So, that will possibly mean - depending on the lemons you have - cutting the rind off first and slicing that up, then dicarding the pith and cutting up the lemon. It truly is worth the while. YUMMM.... I'm definately making this one again...

I used one preserved Meyer lemon (reserving the pulp for another use). This recipe felt authentic to my own experiences as an AFS student to Casablanca years ago (Maroc, '74), and being a good Greek girl, I thought the lemon level was perfect. I doubled most of the spices except the paprika, and was generous with the ginger. I used 1# each of boneless, skinless breast meat and thigh meat. This worked perfectly in my Emile Henry tagine that I received as a Christmas gift this year and I can't wait to do it again for guests. It was better by an order of magnitude than other more sweet recipes, so it was a hit here.

I wish I could give this recipe a 2.5. It was good, just not really good, and certainly not great. I have some leftover and I'm hoping that like other reviewers have said, that it will get better with time.

Rating: 3
I didn't make this exactly per the recipe, so that might explain why I give it 3 forks, unlike some others who have not rated it as well. I pretty much used the recipe as a guide for the spices, and even then I increased the amounts based on feedback here. But basically I first browned the chicken, removed it, then sauteed some onions/shallots/garlic until golden, then deglazed it with some chicken stock (~half can) and added in the spices. I cooked it until most of the liquid was gone, then added the chicken back and the remainder of the stock, and also threw in the lemon slices (1 lemon) and some cilantro stems. Simmered for a little bit, then added in the chickpeas. Unfortunately there was a little too much liquid so I had to simmer for longer than anticipated, which resulted in slightly softer chickpeas (although not mushy). Towards the end, I added some baby carrots and some raisins, and then topped it off with some chopped cilantro. Overall, the flavour was quite good, and I would say the only real flaw was slightly overdone chickpeas. I had intended on adding some crushed tomatoes, but there was already too much liquid so I omitted that. The carrots and raisins also added another nice layer of flavour (a little sweet from the raisins) and texture (a little crisp from the carrots). This was a good example of why I always read through the reviews before trying the recipe out. Just looking at the recipe, I wouldn't have guessed that it might come out underspiced or over-tangy (from the lemon). I always try to read all the reviews, and if there seem to be a disproportionately large number of similar comments, I'll heed the warning.

The recipe was good but everyone in my family felt that the lemon flavor overpowered all the other spices. Next time I would only use 1/2 a sliced lemon and no lemon juice.

While it sounds weird to put a lemon in this, it added great zest to the recipe. It makes a ton of extra sauce but that's fine. Freeze it to use again and simmer chicken breasts or thighs in it.

There was just something missing. I tried doubling the spices, but that didn't fix the problem. Next time, I'll use only thighs and substitute chicken stock for the water. This recipe will require some meddling, but I like the idea.

This is a great winter stew. I made about 1.5 times the recipe, using 3 gigantic boneless chicken breasts that I cut into strips, 2 cups chicken broth instead of water, 2x the spices (2x what was called for in 1x the recipe), used the lemon rind, slicing the lemons paper thin, and added about 3/4 cup of chopped dried apricots. I used green beans as the recipe called for and thought they were a good choice. Next time, I would add more lemon (note that I didn't increase the amount of lemon, based on everyone's reviews) and even more apricots. I think that 1.5-2 cups of broth is the right amount for 1x the recipe -- I really like the broth part of this meal, and actually thought that serving it over couscous dulled the flavors a bit and would have preferred it as a stand alone stew. 1.5x the recipe makes enough for at least 8 -- I'm going to eat this all week long. I also wonder if some plain yogurt might make a nice addition as a garnish?

Doubled spices (careful with cayenne), sliced lemon thinly w/ mandoline (threw in the remains - at end, squezed the end, then discarded. Used 1/2 the liquid - chicken broth instead of water; used fresh tomatoes + tomato paste instead of canned; used frozen peas instead of beans; threw in small fingerling potatoes at same time as carrots, and added raisin toward the end. Next time, will add toasted/sliced almonds at the end

This recipe was fantastic! It was pretty easy to make, didn't take too long, and has a wonderful light, yet pungent flavor. I took the previous reviews to heart and changed a few things- rather than slicing the lemon with the peel on- I peeled it, then sliced it. The result was a tangy, but not overpowering lemon flavor. I also subsituted peas for green beans, and used medium sized chunks of chicken breast for the meat. I served it over quinoa, and not only was it delicious, it's remarkably healthy! I am definitely going to make this again!

The flavors were good, but I found this a little too sour--if I make it again, I'll probably add some raisins and maybe more onions or something for sweetness. Also, I needed about 10 more minutes cooking time for the carrots and chicken.

Absolutely use Meyer lemons in the recipe! they are sweeter and thin skinned with little pith; only the thinnest of peels were left and were very good. They added brightness to the taste. I adapted the recipe for a slow cooker by cooking the onions thru spices as written (well, halved the cayenne and doubled the cumin), then mixed with the other ingredients, and layered the skinned and boned chicken on top. Delicious, but don't stir the chicken: it just dissolves. Better with peas than green beans. Served with yogurt on the side and naan; next time, I'll use garlic naan. I will make this again soon.

Rating: 3
This recipe is quite good. There were so many conflicting opinions with the addition of thinly sliced lemons that I decided to add it and formulate my own opinion. I sliced the lemons with peel very thinly and found that it made the dish bitter. I panicked and removed what lemon I could salvage after simmering the chicken for 30 minutes. In the end, it was still bitter. I added more spices, escpecially cinnamon) to counter the bitter taste and found that it worked somewhat. There was still a hint of bitter aftertaste. Instead of chicken leg-thighs, I used chicken wings (since it was already in the freezer) and boneless skinless chicken breasts. I also used peas instead of green beans per another reviewer's suggestion. I will definitely try this recipe again without the lemon peels. The medley of spices are great and will probably do without the lemon peel.

Perhaps the best new chicken dish I've made in a long time. I suggest making chicken in morning, cooking through,cooling, adding green beans when you rewarm (serve crunchy). Don't overcook! Wonderful melange of flavors. Thinly sliced lemon peel works as a good substitute for preserved lemon.

Rating: 2
Good, not great. I doubled the spices, used chicken broth instead of water, sliced the lemons paper-thin, and waited three days for the flavors to meld (all per user suggestions). I also served it over sauteed monkfish (had a filet in the fridge) alongside the chicken, which worked nicely. But the bitterness from the lemon rind never really went away--ultimately, it obliterated all the other flavors in the dish.

One more note is that this recipe makes much, much more than four servings. We fed six people with left overs for 2-3 days after. It can tend to be a bit spicy (hot) so a little goes a long way. Great with a very pourous wheat bread.

I lived in northern Morocco for several months and this is the most authentic tasting recipe (and final product) I've tasted State-side. I don't ever remember seeing greenbeans in anything I ate(could be a regional ingredient), so I substituted with fresh frozen peas towards the end. If you slice the lemons VERY thin, the slices literally dissolve into the tagine and is not bitter. Be very sure to remove all seeds and the hard, thick ends, and the white stringy middles. This dish requires all the spices (it's basically the ras el-hanout blend which, in other recipes on Epicurious is supposedly only found in specialty stores) and the herbs (the mint at the end combinded with the coriander, cumin, paprika, lemon and cilantro seals the dish). This is fantastic. I also just halved chicken breasts to put in the pot because I hate eating chicken off the bone. One twist would be to add some golden raisin at the end (not too early or they will get too hot to eat). This is not common, and usually raisins and currants are eaten with couscous dishes, but, it lends to the Moroccan flavour.

I think this recipe is stupendous, but I nearly didn't. I cooked it one night to serve the next night, and, tasting it, I was worried about the bitterness of the lemon peel. To tone it down (or bring other flavors up to meet it) I tinkered just a bit: I sprinkled more cumin on it rather liberally and added a double chicken bouillon cube. By the way, I'd used canned baby artichoke halves rather than the green beans. Anyway, my very discerning guests were crazy about it the next night, and we liked it well enough, but the real discovery was that IT WAS PHENOMENAL ON THE THIRD NIGHT. I wound up drinking up the remaining broth as if it were manna. I can't wait to make it again--and again and again.

Disappointing. I adore so many of the recipes I've gotten from this site, but this one just seemed less than the sum of its parts.

We ate our way across Marrakesh on our vacation last month and this was my first attempt at making a tagine at home. Scrumptous. I served it with a Gewürztraminer and a Syrah - we wanted to see which we liked better. We found that the Gewurz calmed/cooled the spices down, while the syrah tended to amp them up, both worked well. Moroccans don't serve tagines on cous-cous, but rather they serve them with a dense round bread cut in pie-shaped slices that you dip in to soak up the juices. A cous-cous with veggies is typically served as a separate course.

With all due respect to those who chose to omit the lemon in this recipe, my family found the lemon to be the key ingredient in this dish, and the whole sliced lemon gives a subtle, distinctive flavor. I sliced the lemon very, very thinly on a Japanese Benriner, and the lemon dissolved into the sauce. There were no large chunks to bite into. Try it and see!

Thank you to all previous reveiwers: I cut wayyyyy back on the lemon, used chicken broth instead of water, and "upped" the spice content to suit our tatse. I loved the recipe and thought it tasted good enough to be served in a Morroccan restaurant. Will certainly make it again.

I really liked this dish, and got many compliments from my guests. I didn't think it was too lemony at all. After reading the reviews, I was afraid that the tagine might get too bitter, so I chopped up my lemon in large chunks so that I could remove it easily. It wasn't necessary- I kept tasting the tagine as it cooked, and it never got bitter. I did remove the chunks of peel before serving though. The only change I made to the recipe was to double the cinnamon, since 1/8 tsp seemed too little to me. I served it over whole wheat couscous with dried apricots in. Quite the healthy, but still very tasty meal! A side note- remove the lemon seeds from the lemon. I didn't, and biting into a lemon seed is not a pleasant experience.

BEWARE THE LEMON PEEL! I made this as written until time came to add the veggies. I tasted it and it was so bitter, I was ready to toss everything but the chicken. Instead I fished out as much of the lemon peel as I could, and added some plain old sugar (which I hate to add to anything), which made it edible, but I still apologized to my husband for the bitterness. When I re-heated the leftovers, I added honey. It was better. If I tried this again, I would (obviously) leave out the lemon peel.

Outstanding! I used chicken broth instead of water, as suggested by others. I followed the recipe directions for adding lemon slices and juice, and did not find it too lemony. In fact, biting into lemon rind in the finished product was a pleasant contrast to the taste of mint, cayenne pepper, cilantro. It's an amazing blend of flavors, balanced just right!

Just omit the carrots and suggested couscous and you have a perfect "South Beach" phase one dish. Very tasty, even if you're not concerned about diet. Easy and quick to make, full-flavored. I just used lemon wedges, no juice; an entire 15 oz. can of chopped tomatoes (it is January, after all), about 3/4 cup chicken broth. This recipe actually works the way it's intended to, as many like this turn out bland.

I adapted this recipe for my slow cooker, and the meat turned out wonderfully tender. It was a little heavy on the lemon flavor, which drowned out some of the other spices, though, so next time I'll use a little less (maybe just the fresh lemon, and no juice?).

What an excellent dish with so many possibilities. I really only used the recipe as a basis to do what I wanted and get it to taste the way I like. Good writeups from others helped form the perfect dish. I definitely stepped up the spices, used chicken broth instead of water and didn't add the lemon slices. Instead I did the Caribbean technique of letting the chicken sit after its been washed and skinned in some fresh squeezed lime juice, salt and pepper....about 30 minutes while I prepared the other ingredients. Another important thing is the right cookware, Le Creuset if just my favorite and allows for such great browning and even cooking. I did brown the chicken first. Remove to platter. Then saute the onions, garlic and ginger. Add the spices (be generous). Then return the chicken. Then add diced tomatoes (I used the canned ones, ok scold me later), chicken broth and some saffron tea I picked up from another recipe...you basically just steep regular tea as you would but throw in some threads of saffron. Added parsley and cilantro, didn't have mint and didn't feel like buying it...didn't have anything else to make with it. Added the carrots, grean beans and garbanzos...I like the other writeups recommendations for either butternut or acorn squash or even zucchini, either would be great but felt the carrots just did go better with green beans and garbanzos. I also added dried figs which made a lovely balance with the spiciness. And also kamalata black olives, I know green in tagine but I like black...go with what you like! I did slow cook it for about 2 hours (barely noticeable boil level). The result was the most integrated tasty full bodied sauce, albeit it thin unless you add thickener...which you could pull some of the broth mix in some tomato paste and thicken it that way. Best served over couscous. Great dish to be creative with! Enjoy!

This turned out very spicy (my fault), but good. I had a jalapeno, so added it thinly sliced & think I over did it with the cayenne pepper. I cooked it a little more than recommended, that made the chicken fall off the bone. Didn't add the mint. Served it w/plain couscous.

It's a keeper! Took suggestions, cut one huge lemon in half and threw in two quarters. Perfect! Used dried mint from Middle Eastern store with success.

This was EXCELLENT, one of the best recipes I've made from this site. Following the suggestions of others, I browned the chicken quickly first, before adding to the stew. Also, I used one and a half cups of water instead of two, which was more than enough. I didn't use the mint, and found it was great without it. Also, I added some diced dried apricots to the couscous to give the dish a sweeter taste, and it was amazing. Finally, this serves way more than 4 servings - it could serve 8 people. Enjoy!

FFFANTASTIC!!! A couple of minor changes - I used dried chickpeas, hydrated overnight. Lacking sweet paprika, I went with smokey Spanish paprika, and cut the amount to 1/3 of what the recipe called for. My dinner guests and I loved the complex deliciousness. One good friend, who's eater well over 1000 of my meals, said it was just about his favorite of them all. What could I do? I had to invite him to help me polish off the left-overs the following night!

One of my favorite recipes. Spices meld into a wonderful, fragrant and flavorful combination--but definitely round up in quantities. I've both tried with thin slices of lemon (as directed) and with combination of zest and juice, depending on how thick skinned my lemon was. Make a big pot and enjoy the leftovers--they're even better.

This is absolutely wonderful. After reading the other reviews we played it safe and used lemon zest and lemon juice (1 lemon) instead of putting in slices of a whole lemon. It needed some additional lemon juice at the end. We also left out the chick peas and added chunks of butternut squash. To bump up the spicing a bit (since some people said it was bland), we used rounded spoonsful of everything except the cayenne. We loved it. We'll definitely make this again.

Like a watery, not-so-flavourful curry - even though I rubbed the chicken with extra spices.

Everything seemed fine until I added the sliced lemon which imparted an overwhelming bitterness rendering the dish nearly inedible. Maybe its because the lemon was thick skinned with a lot of pith. Next time I'd try preserved lemon or omit it entirely.

Yum! This one rave reviews from both my husband and myself, and it was very simple to do. I left out both the cilanto and mint [not a fan] and used big chunks of zucchini instead of carrots and it was delicious. Also used boneless, skinless chicken breasts and it was fine. Can't wait for the leftovers. Next time, I'll try the red pepper harissa [also on Epicurious] to go along with it.

i liked the lemon, i think it is kind of important, otherwise it isn't really tangine. i agree that the addition of something sweet would help to offset the tangy lemon flavour, and that would be traditional. definitely doubling up the spices would be good, it wasn't as spicy as i would have liked. i also browned the chicken first, critical for maximum flavour! i also noticed that every other recipe for tangine seems to include olives, so i will give that a try next time.

This dish was *fantastic*! Per previous reviews, I cut the lemon in 1/8's so I could fish it out before serving -- no bitter taste at all! Also, I browned the chicken first, and doubled the minced ginger and all the dried spices. My only comment is that the carrots need to be cut a little smaller to cook in 10 minutes. Served it with Israeli (pearl) couscous. Definitely will make this again and again!

This recipe was great....I browned the chicken as one of the cooks suggested....and added quartered fennel, turkish apricots and whole dried figs as suggested by another tagine recipe on epicurious.com. But I also strongly agree with the cook who advised to be careful of the lemon. For us, it was too strong to use fresh lemon....we felt it put the earthy Moroccan flavors way out of balance. So we will make it again, but without the lemon. Overall a good recipe. We made it in the morning, left it to simmer on the stove, went out for an afternoon ski, came back to a great dinner.

Yum, Yum, Yum. Made this last night & it was terrific. I followed advice of a previous rewiewer and cut the lemon into 8ths', so that it was easy to fish out at the end of cooking. Other than that, I made it exactly to recipe, and it was wonderful. Can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch today!

Very flavorful. But be careful of the lemon. Next time I will use lemon preserve or just the juice from the lemon.

I absolutely loved this recipe, in its original form. I decided, when on a health kick to try it a second time -- omitting the chicken, and adding vegetable broth and more veggies to turn it into a super-healthy thick & hearty soup (more like an exotic stew). It has since become my favorite meal, and everyone I have ever served it too loves it as well. I double the recipe, omit the chicken, and add: 1 potato (or parsnip or sweet potato) cubed; some chopped spinach or collard greens; 2 cans vegetable broth; more water to desired consistency; more carrots to liking; 2 fresh tomatoes chopped, and whatever other veggies you think would be good -- but keep the carbs down,it really doesn't need it. It's absolutely delicious! I serve it with just some crusty whole grain baguette w/ butter. Maybe a little parmesan or white cheddar grated on top. It is soooo satisfying (and healthy to boot!)!!! Once you double the original recipe & turn it into a soup/stew following the above, it feeds 2 people for an entire week. For variations during the week to avoid getting tired of it, I've had the following on the side to mix in on different days of the week: cous-cous, barley, wild rice, and/or chicken (sauteed with just enough of the spice mixture to give it some flavor stand-alone: coriander, cinnamon, cayenne, paprika, onion powder). Yummmmmmmm.............

I disagree with the cook from Toronto that "chomping down on a lemon is disconcerting" and so did my guests. I served this dish at a small dinner party and got raves from everyone. Definitely a keeper, although I forgot to add the mint just before serving. I'm looking forward to remembering next time!

Great dish! I browned the chicken at the beginning, removed from pan and THEN sauteed the onion, garlic and ginger in the drippings & proceeded with the recipe. I also cut the water down to about 1 or 1 1/2 cups. I had no problem with the lemons but instead of slices, I just used 2 lemon quarters, squeezed the juice into the pot and then threw the quarters into the tagine but we didn't EAT them at the end. I removed them once the dish was finished cooking.We also enjoyed the complexity of the flavors...it's a keeper for us, beautiful colors, too!

I was a bit skeptical of this recipe but I really enjoyed the varying flavors. I would recomend using less water (I used a total of 2 cups) and definately serve with couscous. I would make this again.

I didn't rate whether I'd make this dish again because my forks are for the spice combination. I needed inspiration for chicken breasts to pair with the steamed broccoli with hummus. I used this spice combo on the chicken, sauteed some onion, then deglazed with some tomato sauce and chicken broth. Don't skip the cinnamon, that really gives the chicken a neat taste.

A very nice change from the spice and texture combinations that we're all accustomed to. Be careful not to use hot paprika as I did the first time I tried this! I toast the spices in a dry skillet first. I also use chicken stock instead of water, it makes the thin broth a little tighter. Agree that couscous is the perfect accompaniment.

Not the best I've made of its type but okay. I too, found the cooking time too short, especially for chicken legs. Next time, I would wrap the lemons in a couple of cheesecloth bundles. Chomping down on a lemon chunk is off-putting.

Make sure you serve this dish with cuscus: the broth is too runny for bread or rice. The grocery store was out of fresh mint, so i had to use dried, and I used only chicken tighs. Was a big hit. Very complex, interesting flavor.

A jumble of spices and herbs leads to a confused dish with a runny broth devoid of taste. A letdown.

I changed the final cook time, as I felt it was not tender enough. I put the whole thing in the oven for a half hour more than the recipe called for, putting the final veggies in at the last 20 minutes. This dish was beyond compare!

Excellent. I put a little more spice in, and instead of regular lemons I substituted preserved lemon - I made the Paula Wolfaert recipe and you have to use them in something! It was great. Definitely one to make again.

Hey - make this recipe! My husband and I thought it was great - my only change was using a whole free range chicken cut up.

I thought this was a great dish! I disagree with some of the others here--the whole, sliced lemons were yummy and didn't taste bitter (I used organic lemons). I do agree it could use even more spice. Although a little soupy, serving it with couscous counteracted that nicely. It's definitely at its best the day it's made. This recipe is a keeper!

I loved this recipe. It smelled wonderful and was very tasty. I loved the lemon pieces. I sliced the wedges very thinly and they were a great addition to the receipe. I did thicken the sauce with flour and loved the result! Our guests loved this dish served with basamti rice!

I on the other hand thought the addition of the thinly sliced lemons absolutely made this dish(was not bitter-tasting). As an avid cook of Indian cuisine, I've made lots of dishes with chickpeas and this is certainly one of the best. Fabulous!

The recipe is delicious; however, there is room for improvement. The lemon quantity should be reduced to 1/4 or 1/2 a lemon. To avoid bitterness, use an organic lemon where pesticides will not dilute the tanginess of the skin. I would also double the amount of the spices, as the other ingredients mute them a bit during cooking.

I also thought the dish was inedible due to the whole lemons, but think it would be entirely worth making again, minus the lemons. Maybe use the zest instead?

I made this on a cold winter afternoon, and the house smelled wonderful. The dish was superb, and my husband went back for thirds. I opened a fresh can of Hungarian paprika, and found that a large can of Progresso chick peas was contained the needed 2 cups. The lemon was a wonderful addition. The leftovers should be even better!! Excellent!!!

While the chicken was baking, it smelled so wonderful. However, this recipe was really disappointing. The dish was bitter from the lemons and very bland and the sauce was thin. Let me put it this way, we ordered a pizza for dinner.

I have always found Bon Appetit to be a reliable source for new recipes but was sorely disappointed with this one. It sounded delicious but was all but inedible due to the bitterness from the lemons. I would assume that the use of preserved lemons would ameliorate this problem. I don't know why the recipe did not call for them in the first place.

I have made this healthy dish twice already - it does have a somewhat bitter taste from the lemon, but my family enjoyed the dish very much - even my five year old! I liked the seasoning - the ginger smells great during cooking. It took me about an hour to prepare, start to finish, and made great leftovers. The sauce is fairly runny, but great over rice or cous-cous. The dish (perhaps due to the bitter lemony flavor) tastes like it helps fight colds.

This dish just doesn't measure up to the picture and the list of ingredients. It smelled heavenly during cooking but came out tasting bland. I suppose you could increase the amount of spices used but the overall dish just lacks something. Sorry, I don't recommend it.

This recipe would have been delicious, except for the whole, sliced lemon. The bitterness of the lemon pith completely overwhelmed the dish. I would make it again substituting lemon rind or preserved lemons.

I must say that I had a very different experience than the previous reviewer; I was very impressed by the way this dish turned out, and to me it looked very similar to the photograph and tasted like a very authentic tagine dish that one would get in a Moroccan restaurant. It did take a bit of fuss, as there so many ingredients, but they all melded together quite well, and I wouldn't hesitate to make this again as a "company" dish.

i'm a personal chef in san francisco and prepared this meal for a family i regularly cook for. the photo looked good enough to eat, so i gave it a try! the sauce did not thicken, and i found it over all to be very bland. it definitely needed more spice, and if i make it again, i will simmer the chicken much longer before i add the vegetables and use chicken stock instead of water, and much less of it, adding as needed.
