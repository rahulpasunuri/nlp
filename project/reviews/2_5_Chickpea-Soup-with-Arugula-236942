Using this recipe as a point of departure, I cooked a package of dried garbanzo beans. Lightly sauteed the onion, carrots, celery, bay leaf in the olive oil with the addition of 4 big cloves of smashed garlic, added everything except the arugula to crockpot, cooked til beans were done. Had arugula pesto in the freezer, made at the end of the season when the arugula has started to bolt and is very peppery (much more so than the baby leaves) - served the garbanzos with a dollop of pesto and big grating of cheese (asiago, it's what was on hand), with additional pesto and cheese on the table. With grilled chicken sausages, salad and french bread, nice meal.

blah,blah, blah. I added a can of stewed tomatoes with garlic and basil and 2 TBSP chili powder. It helped, but I will not make this again.

I agree w/the previous reviewer that the fast white bean stew is better. To that recipe I add a little dried red flakes and more garlic than called for for umph! I have made it w/both cannellini & w/garbanzo beans, and actually prefer it w/the garbanzos. (makes it very spanish).

I have to agree with other reviewers--this recipe just didn't stack up. Hard to say why based on the ingredients and cooking method, but the flavors just don't seem to come together and it tasted more salty than flavorful. There's a much better quick stew on epicurious called Fast White-Bean Stew; it's faster and tastier (although it's not vegetarian).

I added sauteed linguica and pureed most of the solids. With these additions, we found the soup quite tasty and very easy to make.

This soup can be greatly enhanced by adding other, leftover vegetables sitting around in your fridge. I added green onion, green chili, red bell pepper, double the garlic, and a fresh chopped tomato. While it's not the most mind-blowing dish, it's very nutritious and good with crusty bread.

I thought this soup was really bland. I can't put my finger on what was missing but something was.
