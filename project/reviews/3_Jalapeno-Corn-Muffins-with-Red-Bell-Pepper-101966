I recently had lunch at Mesa in Las Vegas, and let me tell you... this recipe doesn't compare. It's not a bad recipe - just kind of bland. If I make it again I'll add more jalapenos and more sugar.

Delicious result but plenty of prep, that's for sure. A food processor is essential if you expect to get out of the kitchen anytime soon!

I added 1 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar cheese. I liked the recipe, and I would make it again. However, I plan to look further for a better corn bread muffin recipe.

Quite labor intensive for the end result. I find the muffins to be very heavy... no wonder with a cube of butter.

This corn bread recipe was moist, slightly sweet, and had great aroma and color. We doubled the jalapenos because they were mild. This recipe compliments the New Orleans red beans and rice well. Its a keeper!

My husband and I enjoyed these muffins. I used corn and jalapenos fresh from my garden. Substitued parsely for the cilantro - should have used cilantro for the extra flavor kick. I also added some grated sharp cheddar cheese. These muffins freeze well.

I've had this many times at Mesa Grill and the recipe is as close as you can get. It's great provided you serve it with the appropriate dinner.

Yuck! What a waste of time, energy and ingredients. As much as I love cornbread, I just couldn't get myself to finish eating one muffin.
