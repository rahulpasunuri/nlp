Ok I'm not gonna lie, I doubted. Thru this entire recipe I thought I must have been doing something wrong. The marsala sauce looked and smelled amazing but just didn't quite taste right. I forgot to smash the garlic, pressing it into the sauce and of course couldn't remove it later. I used anise seeds instead of fennel seeds because the store I went to didn't have fennel seeds. The dry rub smelled so heavily of anise that I swore the chicken was going to taste like a black jellybean. I left out the cream due to dairy allergy. Then I tasted it and the flavors are INCREDIBLE together. The spice is perfectly balanced, marsala flavor is strong and the licorice is a delicious afterthought. I really can't believe it and can only imagine how much it would have improved if I'd added the cream. Make this. Seriously.

I have made this several times, everyone really raves about it!

this was awful. Not what I expected. I love chicken marsala but this was sweet and spicy but not the flavor I would expect at all. And, way too much trouble not to like.

We loved this recipe. I used bone-in breast and thighs with skin, rubbed with the spices and baked in a 350°F oven for about 35 minutes and finished on the grill. The sauce was exceptionally good. A winner!

This was so easy and quite tasty. My only modification was using Merlot instead of Marsala ("use what you've got")-it reduced very nicely. The grilled carrots contributed to a nice presentation, I served the dish on a platter and they were a big hit. This dish could be in a South Beach cookbook.

The sauce simply over-powered the chicken. I'll stick with my simple white wine/shallot gravies.

This is an easy, quick and wonderful dish! I've made it several times and it always turns out wonderfully. Also, try adding some dried tyme to the sauce for another layer of flavor.

I agree with the previous comment. The chicken with the rub stands on its own. Barbequed 3 small cut-up chickens. Planned to serve this later in the week, so we ate alot of the chicken cold for lunch. Delicious! I pan roasted the carrots, then added the chicken to reheat with some sauce(minus the cream). I cut the sauce in half because it seemed like alot. Also, I found my porcinis were moldy so diced & sauted some criminis. I failed at the cream, it didn't blend very well. It tasted good, but not great. The carrots were wonderful.

This recipe was quick, easy and good enough for company. The carrots are good but not necessary. The spice rub is what makes this dish and I keep using it on chicken even when I don't bother with a sauce. I significanly reduced the butter in the sauce for health reasons and it was still rich and delicious because of the Marsala and Porcini.
