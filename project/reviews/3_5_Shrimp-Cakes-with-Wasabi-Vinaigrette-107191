We made this as an appetizer last night. The shrimp cakes and the sauces were wonderful! Very easy to make and thoroughly enjoyable. We made them again today for lunch since we enjoyed them so much!

Has anyone that is writing a review actually made this recipe?

To "A Cook" on 10/25/02: I note that the recipe is adapted from a similar offering by a Japanese chef. Here in Japan, mayonnaise is used in a vast array of recipes, actually- everything from sauces to salads to *gack* pizza toppings. These shrimp cakes seem quite at home with such a dipping sauce. May sound funny, but really not at all uncommon. Very much looking forward to giving this recipe a try!

To NY on 10/25: I recommend the vinaigrette - assuming you like wasabi. I made it 2 ways: one as written; and one omitting the mayonnaise, but mixed in a blender for emulsification. The mayo version looked a little nicer, but I preferred the no-mayo version. I don't know - something about mayonnaise in Asian food seems wrong to me. I know, I know . . . I too have had plenty of sushi rolls that included mayo, but I stand by my opinion. My only comment about the shrimp cakes themselves would be more shrimp/less fish (budget allowing). Afterall, they are SHRIMP cakes.

To those who have made this dish - how is the Wasabi vinaigrette? I'm thinking of trying it on a salad served with seared tuna.

To all the whiny people who haven't made this recipe: I tried it this weekend and I have to say it was a colossal waste of time. I would have better spent my time getting on a plane, flying to Vancouver, getting takeout from Tojo's and bringing it back to Montreal. Really. As far as the ingredients go, I assume it was the grace of God holding these shrimp cakes at Tojo together, because I certainly had to add a lot of bread crumbs. Don't waste your time, folks.

To the cook from Gardena, CA: http://eat.epicurious.com/dictionary/food/index.ssf?TERM=mesclun It's simply the fancy salad mix from supermarkets. I find that the food/drink dictionary on this site is very helpful. Just go through the "Learn" menu at the top of the page.

To Gardena, from the "Food Dictionary" on this site: "mesclun [MEHS-kluhn; Fr. KLAHN ] Found in specialty produce markets and many supermarkets, mesclun (also called salad mix and gourmet salad mix) is simply a potpourri of young, small salad greens. The mix varies depending on the source, but among those greens commonly included are ARUGULA, DANDELION, FRISÉE, MIZUMA, OAK LEAF, mâche, RADICCHIO and SORREL. Choose mesclun with crisp leaves and no sign of wilting. Refrigerate in a plastic bag for up to 5 days. Wash and blot dry just before using." I think that in Europe rather than in America, the required mix is more specific than that given here.

Would like to try this recipe but what is "mesclun"? Other ingredients have been defined but not "mesclun". Thanks!

Oh, okay cook from 10/18, and your comment about the huge amount comments is gonna help.

If anyone has actually made the recipe, would you please comment. The ongoing complaints about lack of ingredients or opinions about the magazine are becoming tiresome. I read the reviews in order to decide whether to try a recipe, and whether any alterations are recommended.

Would the "Cook from Philadelphia" please refrain from editorializing about GOURMET magazine or its editor? Either make the recipe and rate it, or don't make it and go away. Your complaints about the magazine are best suited for the reader's page.

This looks like a great recipe. I have made shrimp cakes and as a seafood lover, I certainly will try this recipe. I may change the ingredients a bit and just before frying I shall roll cakes in Panko bread crumbs.

I don't think this dish is not that complicated if you use an instant Konbu-dashi, granule comes with small packet and you disolve into warm water, instead of making dashi from scratch. It still tastes good. You can find instant dashi from ethnic food section of well-stocked grocery stores. I bet this taste pretty good.

This recipe is very similar to the one i used in my restaurant its a good recipe. There is some things that need not to be explained ie plating you cvan plate it however one pleases. why explain it it makes the recipe drawn out. But the wasabi vinegrette and the mirin recipe are simple. Most high end supermarkets carry the ingredients needed if not subsitutions are easy if you get creative. Overall not a bad dish though

I can certainly get all the ingredients... that's not the point. I guess it just seems rather overwrought and a lot of effort for an appetizer... though I might order it out someplace. I started cooking at a very young age and got over my "fussy food" phase. It did seem like a ridiculous recipe to me, but that's perhaps just my taste/opinion. That said, I do think Gourmet has suffered enormously since Ruth Reichl took over. I was a 12-year subscriber and canceled in her first year. I've recently been buying it again, to see if things have changed, and they haven't. sadly.

Try searching on the internet for the ingredients; especially try ethnicgrocers.com. Penzey's Spices is also a real good source for hard-to-find spices as well as Dean & DeLuca. Cheers.

even as an ex-pat living in Nairobi, Kenya I can find the ingredients from our limited resources to make this recipe! It sounds ONO-licious!!

Can't understand why anyone would want to live some where you can't get these ingredients? And what is so complex about this recipe? The reason someone makes this recipe is because it tastes good.

This is why I also don't subscribe any more. But I do really like and appreciate the web site. The reviews offer great feedback about the recipes.
