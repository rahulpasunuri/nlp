Do you think you can freeze these vegetables after pickling?

I loved this vegetable dish. It is bright and colorful, crunchy, tart and a little sweet. It is seriously delicious. Reading the ingredients I wondered if it would be too salty or too sweet, but I thought it was perfect. Since you are not drinking the brining liquid, I don't think you are consuming too much of the salt and sugar. This time I prepared it, I stuck to the recipe. I am looking forward to playing with some variation.

These are so simple to make. I made a batch for a party and had multiple people ask me for the recipe. The reviewer below who said they were too salty, maybe that could have had to do with your selection of olives and if you were including the olive juice. We did not find them salty at all, but perfect!

These were WAY too salty, I ended up throwing them out

This is a great recipe. I also add fennel seed to the pickling liquid. You can do a short marinade for 4 hours or less which results in lightly pickled vegetable which is delicious. I serve in a big glass vase (a la Martha) with a metal slotted spoon. The colours are amazing in the glass vase.

Made these as a side for a dinner of "three cheese lasagna" and a romaine salad with lemon parmesan dressing(all from this site). I did cut the recipe in half and did not use all the vegies called for. They were wonderful.

Delicious and easy. For health reasons I used only 2 tablespoons of kosher salt and it still tasted great. I didn't have peperoncini or cured olives, used peeled and blanched garlic cloves and pearl onions and canned olives (less salty). Absolutely beautiful
