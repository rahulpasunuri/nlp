Not bad, not great. I felt that the pancakes were a little lacking in flavor. I was making it as a quick dinner for kid, so I didn't use the garnish, or make them perfectly round and brown, so perhaps that detracted from it. I would say I would make them again, but not something i will keep in my monthly repetoire.

I have used this recipe many times for special occasions. People alway rave how unique the flavors are. I add some seasoning to the sour cream to bring out more flavor.

I am not sure the "southwest" flavors of the pancakes really marry well with the smoked salmon. The pancakes on their own were tasty - I may try to think of some other topping for them (guacamole?).

Simple and yum. My guests thoroughly enjoyed them, and that's good enough for me!

Although this recipe sounds amazing, the pancakes lacked any taste whatsoever. I was quite disappointed. The texture of the pancake was quite rubbery.

A perennial favorite with my guests. It is easy, tasty, showy. Everyone likes it!
