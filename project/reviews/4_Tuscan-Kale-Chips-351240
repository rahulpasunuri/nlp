These are seriously the most wonderful things ever. All I use is pepper, olive oil, and smoked salt and they turn out delicate, crispy, and delicious. I would make these every day if I had the time.

I tried doing these two ways: Exactly as described, and with balsamic vinegar. Hands down, the clear winner had the vinegar! I recommend trying a tray of each and running with the winner. My husband liked them as much as potato chips, and that is saying a lot!

I made some of these using a salt free spice blend from Costco since some family members have to be careful about sodium. I think they turned out a little bitter because some of the dry herbs/spices burned. They're still edible but I won't use that blend again. The plain salt and pepper ones are fabulous! As for storage, I made these 24 hours ago. Once they cooled, I broke some in half and put them into an old tall mayo jar. The others went into ziplocks. A day later,the jar chips are just as crunchy as last night but the plastic bag chips lost a lot of crunch.

I had once tried "broccoli chips" (made from the leaves), and hadn't liked them. I heard a lot about kale chips so I thought I'd give them a try. I had just enought (curly) kale, which I ripped into smaller pieces. The leaves were probably quite broad because I couldn't fit them into one layer. The ones that were on top didn't crisp as well, but I thought they were ok anyway. Not all of them got oil on them, and I think the best ones had some oil and salt, so I think I'll add more next time. The pepper was nice too. I'm going to try this recipe on the broccoli leaves I have on hand. My mother, brother and husband each tried one and expressed interest combined with dislike. I however, ate quite a few (maybe half) right after cooking them and am taking the rest to school as a snack. I think these probably taste better when you know how healthy they are. ;)

We discovered Kale Chips at a new eatery in our town. We love it with almost anything. We have even sprinkled Balsamic vinegar on it before cooking and it came out wonderful.

Really good, easy to make. I baked a few minutes extra to insure the kale was nice and crispy. I've tried sprinkling a bit of sesame oil for a nutty flavor. My kids love it.

I once bought a bag of kale chips and they were so awful that I actually spat out the first chip I ate. After that, I avoided the idea of kale chips for a very long time - that is, until I stumbled onto this recipe. I was astonished with how absolutely delicious these are. I've tried it with curly kale as well, which is just as good.

Darn - I was so excited to make these because I love Tuscan kale, but I didn't like them. They don't make a nice presentation because the leaves are ugly once baked. The texture is light and crunchy, but they're messy. Finally, the taste was okay, but not so great that I would want to make them again. I'm certainly in the minority, though!

People raved over these and demanded the recipe. Everyone swore I must have used garlic, but I the only changes I made to the recipe was to cut up the leaves, use spray olive oil, and baked about 28 minutes.

My boyfriend made these using walnut oil instead of olive oil, with curly kale for 33 mins. Delicious. I'd trim out the center ribs all the way down to the tip. They got sort of sharp and I had to eat around them. I'd also reduce cooking time to 30 mins. They had a hint of burnt taste at 33.

I love roasting broccoli so I thought I would give it a try. I love kale and this is a great way to get my friends to try kale. I cut it into pieces and seasoned it with truffle oil, lemon juice and garlic before I put it in the oven. SOOO AMAZING! I will make this for sure again!

This is easy and delicious. I love kale and this is a fun variation that my toddler enjoyed. I used an organic spray olive oil and only sprayed one side, and it was perfect. I don't think it needs more than salt--the flavor was great using lacinato kale.

Couldn't be easier for a healthy snack. I used just plain Kale, I don't know what Tuscan Kale is -- and it worked great. I used about a tablespoon of maldon salt and they were a touch too salty, so I will use less next time.

Used kale right from my garden, just used a little salt this go round but am looking forward to trying it with the smoked paprika. Guests were a little skeptical at first but once they tried it, they were gone!

Rating: 2
Easy to make (if you use a sharp paring knife to remove those pesky stems) and infinitely adaptable. I liked smoked paprika the best (we made batches with S & P; garlic powder; smoked paprika; each added with the oil; and a batch with S & P that had sesame seeds and sesame oil added after the cooking). Also used spray olive oil; some on the cookie sheet and some in a gallon zip-loc bag with the spices. We took the advice of "massagers" to coat the pieces lightly and evenly. It took 30 min for "dinosaur kale"/Tuscan kale. They will definitely stand up in a vase but they are easier to eat when cut down to chip size. Make 'em large chips because they shrink significantly during the "roasting". They were great with wine and it's hard not to wolf them all down. I think the cheaper, common curly kale would have even more "chipness" so we'll try that next.

Rating: 4
These were quite good, and I think they'd be even better, as some reviewers suggest, by adding other spices like garlic powder or smoked paprika. I further cut the leaves into smaller pieces after removing the center stalk, and found the easiest way to coat them (more) evenly with the oil was to rub it onto them.

Yum! Yum! Yum! So easy and tasty! Only problem is they will be gone too fast!

I had noticed this recipe, but thought it sounded weird. I decided to try it after my husband bought kale chips at Whole Foods -- $8 for a few handfuls! Kale is so cheap, I decided to experiment. Used curly kale, a tiny bit of salt and pepper. They were much tastier than the store-bought dehydrated chips. So light - they almost shatter in your mouth! They'd be perfect with a glass of red wine. Only problem -- they do lose some of that crispy light texture when stored in an airtight container. Has anyone figured out the storage issue? I will keep experimenting.

We LOVE these chips! Great, easy snack. We munch them at home, and have shared them many times with our wine group and at other parties. They're a hit with everyone, including those who don't like greens! Better tasting and better for you than potato chips! Fun to serve - in a glass block vase!

Super easy and yummy! I've been reading all about kale chips online and in magazines and finally decided to give it a try. I purchased the kale before reading the recipe and didn't know that there were different types. I'd ended up with the curly kind, but it didn't seem to matter. I made two batches, one with just salt and pepper, and the other with salt and sugar as someone suggested. I also let the curly kale sit in the oven for 35 minutes. They turned out light and crispy. I couldn't tell you whether they keep because my entire household (including a 2.5 yr old and 6 yr old) devoured the chips within a few minutes of them coming of the oven. I will definitely make this again!

Absolutely delicious. I couldn't get Tuscan kale, so I used the regular curly-leaf variety and baked the recipe just a few minutes longer. I also cut the kale into potato chip sized pieces. Next time I will try using celery salt.

These are surprisingly delicious! I use olive oil cooking spray and lightly coat the leaves. Instead of salt, I use grated parmesan cheese.

Yummy and addictive. 3 forks for simplicity of this recipe. I have made these twice now. I found that 20 minutes at 250 degrees was perfect for the type of kale I used. I used a sea salt in a salt mill and freshly course ground black pepper. I will make these chips regularly.

YUM. Followed recipe exactly--simple and delicious. I agree to be careful with salt--the next day, it seems to be stronger. I stored the kale in tupperware after it cooled overnight, and the kale lost its crispiness. Any tips on how to store?

Rating: 4
We make this with young Red Russian Kale so as not to worry about cutting. In a convection oven it's done in 10 minutes. Thing with kale though is to watch the salt - somehow kale can taste very salty all on its own with none added. Note: I've read (but not tried) that you can also make these in a food/air dryer with no oil.

I forgot to mention in my post that prepping them in the zip lock let me travel.

These are great! To keep from messy crumbles, next time I'll make sure to cut skinny pieces that easily fit into my mouth. I usually cut kale with scissors. The real trick is to put the raw kale strips in a zip lock and massage the oil to evenly coat. If some centers come out dry, then massage with your finger. You may find some bake faster. I'd remove those and let others bake a few more mins. Keep your eye in it!

Really good, but took closer to 45-50 minutes to get truly crispy. You definitely need to remove the entire stem/rib, because it's like a wire cable and nearly inedible. not sure if they would stand-up, like in the photo, but still a great, interesting party app.

Rating: 4
I've been appalled at how much kale chips cost in grocery stores, and wanted to make my own... these are perfect. I used a whole bunch of curly kale, de-stemmed but didn't worry about leaf size (just ripped), spread on two baking sheets and drizzled olive oil (didn't measure), sprinkled salt, pepper, and smoked paprika as one reviewer suggested, and baked at 250 for 40 mins, stirring once halfway. Light, crispy, easy and delicious.

Have just made these and while they have an interesting flavor, the thinness and flakiness of the leaves can catch in your throat if not careful. I had some that had more oil on them than others, and these were definitely a little easier going down.

The trick to this recipe is to get the right variety of kale. We like Dinosaur Kale the best, it is bumpy rather than curly. I also use a 350 oven, and more olive oil does Not make this better, but smoked paprika does.

I made a variation--added a splash of balsamic vinegar with the olive oil. The end result tasted like an expensive appetizer at one of the expensive restaurants in town. The toughest thing about this recipe is knowing when to take them out of the oven. You don't want to undercook but don't want to overcook. Really yummy!

Rating: 4
This is the most surprising recipe I've made in a long time. Tastes very similar to potato chips, but at a fraction of the calories. Important to remove entire rib: take thin 5" knife and run along both sides of rib to easily remove. Next time I might experiment with different seasonings.

this is excellent. i spent some time at a health retreat in Vermont and they served this with a healthy dinner and I just loved the nutty good crunchy flavor! I put my oven on 350 and it is convection. Didn't see this recommended time/degree until now. It worked perfectly just the same. Keep a watch on it tho!

Rating: 4
LOVED this! However, note to others. be sure to use dinosaur kale, aka lacinato kale, aka tuscan kale. The curly kale won't taste the same. The dinosaur kale is a deeper dark green and not as curly. It is harder to find., you likely won't see it at supermarkets, like Von's/Safeway, but will easily find it at the natural food type stores, like Whole Foods or equivalent. Also, we use more than 1 tablespoon oil, actually we use a pastry brush to individually coat each kale leaf. My 6 year old loves this - hates most veggies, but loves this! Even wanted to bring it to her class' winter party potluck! Ha!

Even my kids liked it. I crumpled up the leftovers over a salad, that was good too. Ours turned out a bit too salty, but that might have been our own issue. Fun!

Don't be fooled. This is basically an edible garnish. And not all that pretty at that. This recipe is NOT terrific with cocktails because it delicate and crumbles and gets black stuff in your teeth. Granted, it is a good way to get some dark green leafy vegetables in you, but is not a "company-type" dish. I might make it again for myself, but that's as far as I could go as a recommendation.

Rating: 3
This tasted quite similar to a flash fried baby bok choy available at a nearby restaurant. My husband and I loved it and my 2 year old liked it at first, but it does have a bit of a strong finish. Could be because I made it with curly kale, which took 35 minutes at 250 in my oven, but I rotated my pans 1/2 way thru so I let out a bit of heat then. I made two batches and for the second added a bit of sugar and the amount of salt as written in the recipe. I cut back on the salt in the first batch as so many reviewers suggested, but my husband and I preferred the sweet/salty version better.

Rating: 4
These are delicious, especially if they're seasoned well with salt and pepper. They're amazing for new kale eaters as well as kale lovers. They do take a lot longer to crisp up in my oven at 250, so I usually increase the temperature. They seem to keep alright overnight, but lose some of their crisp. Popping them back in the oven for a few minutes the next day solves that problem though. Kale yeah!

I have a question for those who have made this recipe--do they keep at all? I want to make some for a bridal shower but I would have to either make them the night before or that morning. I'd rather do the night before, but even if I make them that morning they wouldn't get eaten until about 3 pm. Thoughts?

I have a lot of kale in my garden and am thrilled with this recipe. I hadn't dreamed that greens could be roasted successfully. The results are wonderful - easy, healthy, and addictive. My daughter and I could not stop eating them. Mine were quite homely and really did not present well in a glass or on a platter, but no matter because they are certainly a novel and welcomed addition to the usual snacks with cocktails.

Easy, tasty, and addictive! Go light on the salt -- the kale has enough brine flavor on its own. I was generous with the pepper instead. My only complaint: The finished chips are far too fragile to travel, so I couldn't take them to work for lunch.

fun and delicious way to snack on something REALLY healthy! I am making the last batch right now. The only change, was I used the convection oven at 250. It took about 20 minutes and the kale was still bright green and paper thin, and CRISP. I sprayed the olive oil on very lightly - it doesn't need much and went quite light on the salt and pepper too. I will make this for company soon! This batch will be in my lunch tomorrow at work!

Great recipe. I have a 1 year old, so I didn't use any seasoning- still tasted great. I made a triple batch, so we had leftovers. Although they didn't stay crispy over night, I put them back in the oven for 5 minutes and they were even better the next day.

I was sure I'd love these since I love kale and I really enjoy roasted greens such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, but they are only ok. My 5 year old son liked them the most but even he tired of them quickly. They lack a dimension that the other roasted veggies have. If I try them again (unlikely) I may sprinkle them with sugar since that has been my success strategy for broccoli and Brussels sprouts.

My kids could not get enough of these chips! Did one batch as instructed, though I thought the salt actually took away the natural sweetness of the tuscan kale. Then did a batch with sesame oil and seeds....very nice! Will try sumac powder next: I think that would be very good on it.

Made alot of different recipes from this site for super bowl--beef broccoli wontons, sticky sesame chicken wings, mexican clam dip, etc. but these by far were the most talked about. They were very, very good and the only thing that we all speculated on was if the nutritional content of the kale got roasted out of them? Anyone have any answers? Next time I would consider incorporating some garlic into them--perhaps using garlic flavored oil instead of regular olive oil.

These looked really good and were definitely interesting, I didn't love the flavor however and I think they ended up tasting slightly of Nori.

I loved these. A few notes. The picture to me looked like leaves without center stems cut out so I did some both ways and it is better to cut that center stem out. They really are too tough. I also did some with truffle salt, some with fennel pollen and some with smoked paprika salt. They were all good and strangely addicting.
