I really like this cake. I made it when I first saw the recipe and finally got around to making it again this year. I made it with a mix of golden and dark raisins because I never have currants on hand and it's delicious!

fantastic recipe! I agree with the cook from Monkton - very gingerbread like fruitcake. This is my second year making this, last year it was a hit and has been requested this year for Thanksgiving morning breakfast instead of Christmas - a nice kick off to the holiday baking season.

Excellent - very rich, and filling. I used cranberries with raisins and currants. Bread was packed with fruit, very dense and moist. I think this is my new favorite fruitcake.

Delicious-the name doesn't do it justice as it is more of a dense gingerbread with a coffee flavor. I substituted dried cranberries and cherries for some of the raisins and currants and it was delicious! The cranberries in particular add a nice tartness every once in a while. Would make a great gift-I used mini loaf pans and they still needed about 2 hours and 40 minutes.
