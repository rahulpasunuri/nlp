Brilliant recipe. My father, who is the pickiest eater, enjoyed this dish and had seconds. It is perfect over rice. Did not change a thing except I didn't have cayenne so used chili pepper which wasn't hot enough. Sprinkled chili pepper flakes to add the hotness. Superb. Don't change a thing! Served this w/ chocolate tart (found on this website).

I only used the marinade from this recipe and I used it on pork kebabs. Good lord this is delicious! The flavor it gave the pork is seriously amazing. Definitely saving it to make again.

Made this for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit, even though I only used one bell pepper. (Forgot to buy the other two while I was at the store!) It did take me forever to turn the mango and peppers into matchsticks, but for a party it was worth it 'cause it looked as pretty as it tasted!

OH MAN THIS IS GOOD! The yogurt sauce has amazing flavor. We almost licked the plates! I didn't have chutney so pressed some ripe fresh mango and some peach preserves through a strainer and just added a splash of white wine vinegar and lime juice. I also added avocado to the salad. This was incredible.

great recipe! I make the shrimp all this time now- the yogurt helps to make a great coating on the shrimp- so good over the salad or over rice or quinoa. Only change I made was once that i cook the shrimp with all of the marinade as well and it creates a great sauce especially if u serve with rice! Enjoy!

This is ALWAYS a big hit as a summer dish, and I often make for big potluck dinners - it's also a good dinner party meal if you include a side of brown rice. I often add a little more cayenne to the shrimp marinade, but the dressing as written actually has quite a good kick to it. The dressing will also keep in the fridge and is good on most salads.

Beautiful salad! I used mixed spring green that had purples and greens and when mixed with the mango and red bell pepper it was stunning in appearance. The flavors were great too! The spiciness of the dressing and the shrimp worked well with the sweetness of the mango and bell pepper and the cilantro added just the right flavor. A restaurant quality salad.

This was wonderful. Served to my book club. Mixed in arugula as the watercress was a bit leggy. Simple to prepare and lovely to serve. I found the spice combinations to be perfect on the shrimp and in the dressing. Served with naan bread.

EXCELLENT flavors,Beautiful presentation. Was surprised at the wonderful taste of watercress and cilantro together(I did add some mesclun mix to stretch it). I'm not a heavy dressing user, but now I have FANTASTIC leftover salad dressing YUM!!

Absolutely gorgeous and delicious dish! I grilled the shrimp rather than sauteeing - this way they kept much more of the marinade on them and were really appetizing to look at.I also used Patak's hot mango chutney instead of Major Grey's - it's not really hot, just has a little more zing.A combination of baby arugula and baby spinach prewashed in a bag from the pruduce section mae it come together in a snap. Really a lovely and elegant dish!

This was very tasty. I do agree with the reviewer who expected more from the marinade, however. Next time I will try serranos instead of jalapenos. I also think the shrimp would do better grilled than sauteed - they did throw off a lot of liquid and ended up basically steaming. I added rice, since we were having this as a dinner entree. The sharp watercress adds a nice contrast to the sweetness of the mango - if you're going to substitute I'd recommend arugula or another sharp green instead of plain spinach or lettuce.

I served this at my son's 18th birthday/Superbowl party and everyone loved it! I followed an earlier suggestion not to do the extra step w/ the chutney, and it was fine. I would use less sesame oil next time I make it.

Fantastic salad to dress up a potluck barbeque. The salad has beautiful colour, texture and flavours. I made a few minor changes: I reduced the oil in the dressing to only 3 tablespoons and the as well, I used half baby spinach and half watercress for the greens.

This was a wonderful salad, and works well as a main course, though next time I think I might reduce the portions, serve a larger crowd, and accompany it with some other dishes. For those as ignorant as I was, coriander=cilantro=Chinese parsley... I'd only known coriander as a dried spice or seed, and had never heard of fresh coriander. Also, be sure to buy the mangoes firmer than you normally would, or you'll have a heck of a time trying to julianne them.

Despite the great reviews, and the fragrant promise from the marinade, this recipe just didn't do it for me. While it was very pretty and colorful, I was expecting something with a bit more kick. It seemed like a lot of the flavor stayed in the marinade, even though I gave it more than 24 hours. After cooking, the shrimp gave off a lot of liquid; maybe this carried off the flavor? Might try it again and increase some of the spices.

Very distinctive taste! I rearranged it a little: served the shrimp over basmati rice accompanied by the salad, and went a little heavy on the mangos. Dressing (has quite a kick!) for salad keeps well in fridge.

This is delicious!! Made it for visiting Indian co-workers and they were even blown away. Will be making it again for my daughters birthday.

It's 2001 and this dish keeps on going. I made it in 1996 and have made this dish repeatedly over the last 5 years - ALWAYS with rave reviews. It's worth the time and effort. If you need a substitute for chutney I found a chunky marmelade works just as well. This dish has remained my all time favorite!!

We have repeatedly made this salad since it was published in 96, that's 4 years now. I haved also substituted chicken strips for shrimp, to have variety. It works equally well.

excellent.the flavors were excellent. some problems with the directions. no need to seive the chutney, just chop the bigger pieces. we did not add 6 c of watercress sprigs, we did one c watercress, plus one bunch chopped spinach, and still felt more greens would be nice.

Excellent dish!! We added red onion(mandolined)and we cooked the shrimp in a stick-free pan with all the marinade. We also substituted canola oil for the vegetable oil. Other than that the recipe stands on its own. Superb, and we're very picky!!!

Every time I make this dish it receives rave reviews. The last time I made it one guest asked if I was a professional chef! It's especially tasty when it is pared with potato samosas.
