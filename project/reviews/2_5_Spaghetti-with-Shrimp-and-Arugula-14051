I found this uninspired. While normally I love arugula, it didn't really work here - there was nothing to balance out its peppery bite, and it dominated the dish. There are so many terrific shrimp pasta recipes out there that I won't bother with this one again.

I did not have any parsley so I used fresh cilantro, extra garlic, wine and olive oil. I also added some scallions. Instead of lemon zest, I used lime as well. Very tasty dish - my family loved it.

perfect for a hot summer evening. it was subtle but not so subtle as to be blah. i read the mixed reviews but gave it a whirl anyway. i find most of these recipes are short on sauce quantity so i increased all the flavors a tad. i didnt use any parsley at all, doubled the garlic, upped the lemon zest a bit, used fresh spinach spaghetti, a smidge more wine to finish off the shrimp, and a pinch of red pepper flakes. yum. an excellent use of arugula and very easy to make - after you devein the shrimp...

I was preparing to make this and then read the reviews and thought, "uh oh." I went ahead and made it anyway, and I'm glad I did! The flavors in this dish are light, but very good. I used 3x the garlic because I was a little concerned about the recipe (and we like garlic!), and I think this made it very good. I'd definitely make again and recommend the three cloves of garlic.

I made this without the lemon zest but with garlic and red pepper flakes. Unfortunately I overcooked the shrimp, but it was still pretty good....and FAST.

This was very disappointing. It lacked flavour and was a waste of fresh arugula and shrimp.
