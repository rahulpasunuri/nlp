EIther the temperature or the time are way off in this recipe. After 45 minutes my milk had a hard, burnt crust on it. The "Cook from Florida" below suggests that the "Cook from Atlanta may have had this same problem because of not putting the milk in the water bath. I assure you that I put mine in a water bath. SOmething is off and I'm surprised noone else has noted it.

Yum yum yum! And simple, even though it takes a while.

I made this wonderful recipe for my family a couple of times...then I started to substitute red wine in lieu of rum. This is a combination better known as "Cajeta Envinada", a popular sweet sauce that it is used to top Toasted French Bread, as well as fruit, ice cream too, of course. Enjoy. Delicioso!!!!

It is impressive that you North Americans still have no commercial dulce de leche available. Anyway, this recipe is fantastic.

I make my dulce the leche in a way it is done all over South America. Put the can of sweetened condensed milk (unopened) in a pressure cooker, fill with water to cover the can. Cover the pressure cooker, set at high heat, when the little thing on top starts hissing really loud, lower the temperature to medium so that is kind of just hisses slowly and after half an hour, turn off. When completely cold, open the pressure cooker, take out can, open and voila! dulce de leche! Make sure you open the can carefully because it might splatter if it is still hot.

It's fantastic! It's also so easy. I make this all the time serving it over a premium vanilla ice cream for guests. I use dark rum and add a little bit more for taste. Keeps in the fridge for awhile, but better fresh. Serve it warm!

I am going to make this today, however, I cook mine a little differently. I had to do a search on the recipe as I couldn't remember (it's been TOO LONG) if I was supposed to use Evaporated or Sweetened Condenced Milk. I put mine on the stovetop in a saucepan covered with water, bring to a boil, cover, reducing heat. It cooks longer (3 hrs) but easier to keep an eye on the water level. This is addictive stuff w/o icecream!!

Your cook from Atlanta must not have read the directions well, the condensed milk goes in a water bath and then in the oven. How do I know what went wrong in Atlanta?? It happened to me. I've tried it again - love it - made vanilla ice cream and added the Dulce de Leche.

Duh, it seemed so simple. One ingredient (at first), two dishes, one temperature. Why it was burned and crusty after 30 minutes at 425, just as directed, I'll never know because I won't be trying again. Just glad it hadn't been an integral part of a company dessert.

I made this wonderful sauce and served it with ice cream and the grilled pinapple, and my friends, my husband and I just loved it! I am making it again soon!

Let's try to be a little more helpful and polite. To the cook from Birmingham, put all of the milk in the dish as described in the first part of the recipe. The "remaining ingredients" that you later add to the milk are the rum, the vanilla, and the salt.

Answer to previous reviewer: The whole recipe is a sauce.

i'm confused. how much milk goes into the dish and how much is saved for the sauce?
