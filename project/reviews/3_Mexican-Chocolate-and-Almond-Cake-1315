I just wanted to share a more authentic version of this recipe: http://www.mexicandessertrecipes.net/Mexican-Dessert-Recipes/mexican-cakes/index.php. The cake itself is quite similar in outcome but much tastier and richer - it adds a cup (!) of butter, 2 more egg yolks, and 4 oz more of chocolate! I used some Mexican Ibarra drinking chocolate and some unsweetened chocolate. The sauce is a caramel sauce that gets poured on and coated with toasted almonds. The link also includes an amazing recipe for raspberry salsa with lime and mint - only I didn't bother straining it as it was delicious without doing so. The cake was a huge hit!

This was a big disappointment. I thought the flavors sounded great together and was thrilled with how it looked. But the first bite was a let-down. So I waited, but even the second day I still did not like it. I wish I had left out the orange and just went with the cinnamon. Interesting texture, and it came out quite moist just as the recipe was written. I did make the sauce, but I didn't like the cake either way, and neither did my family.

I thought this recipe was good, not great. It doesn't have the richness or complexity of another recipe I have for Mexican Chocoloate Spice Cake, which has more chocolate and fewer eggs. I did think this cake needed the glaze to give it some life.

We made this dessert for a scouting event-it won the "most authentic" category. We didn't have time to use the oranges or make the topping, but even without them this dessert was wonderful and so easy to prepare. Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake would have been absolutely beautiful, if I had followed the directions. As it is, it was DELICIOUS. Not dry at all. I added 4 tsp of mild pasilla chile powder, 1 tsp cinnamon, and a pinch allspice, left out the orange. I was thinking mole - would have substituted pumpkin seeds for the almonds if I had had any... But, you really need to let it cool in the pan. I did mine in a bundt pan, (got to get a springform!) and it came out in two pieces, top and bottom half. The top part stuck to the pan even though I had liberally buttered it, and it was non stick. Nothing a little whipped cream won't disguise, though, I hope! Didn't bother with the sauce.

Chocolate, orange peel, toasted almonds...I was excited to make this. Turned out to be my first epicurious disappointment. The cake was really dry when I served it right after baking. Funny though, I think it DOES mysteriously improve overnight. I'd reccommend baking the day before.

I added one extra yolk and one extra white to this recipe. It came out lighter, and was easier to fold everything together.

I made it for the Mexican Independence Day party. Everybody loved it! It is light and has a lot of flavor from orange rind and cinnamon. I did not make the sauce and I served it with whipped cream and raspberry dessert wine. It was just so good.

At first glance, I wasn't too impressed. However, after it sat in my fridge for a day, I finally took a bite and was hooked. I wouldn't waste the time on the sauce, it doesn't need it. Perfect with a dry glass of red wine, fresh non sweetend whipped cream and perhaps a berry or two. I loved it plain also. Chocolatey but not sweet. Perfect for the chocolate craving moments.

ohh this is to die for. The combination of flavors is great and with a slice of orange for garnish it just adds to the whole dessert. I will make this again very soon.

Served with oranges, this cake tastes similar to a spice cake with chocolate overtones.
