This is a wonderful summer dessert, full of berry flavor! Note: don't wash raspberries, just pick them over. They don't need to be perfect, as everything goes into a blender and the solids will be sieved out. I recommend using a regular blender rather than a stick blender, to avoid splattering berry juices which are hard to remove from clothing. Removing the solids takes about 10 minutes, working with a fine-mesh sieve and a curved scraper, but it's worth it. Also, because of the alcohol in the sorbet, it will not get rock hard when frozen, so don't let it sit out before serving--dish up immediately. I served the sorbet with linzer cookies (made with raspberry jam) for a complete raspberry festival. And also the rest of the bottle of champagne!

I followed the directions 100% and the sorbet turned out to be spectacular!

Used white wine, cheaper cherry liquer and raspberry and blackberries. Terrific. Left some of the berries not blended.

Wonderful! My husband was just put on a low-fat/low-sodium diet and this was a hit.

This is a very good sorbet. I served it with slices of fresh pineapple and strawberries.

This is a very easy sorbet to make and is deliciously tart. I served it in phyllo dough cups and topped with fresh berries. It makes an impressive dessert that is easy to make. A small bottle of champagne contains exactly one cup which is perfect for this recipe.
