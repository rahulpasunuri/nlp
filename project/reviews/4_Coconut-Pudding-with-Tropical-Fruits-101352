I love this recipe. It is super easy, relatively guilt free and holds up well as a fast, easy (and delicious) pie filling! I substituted 1 c. coconut milk and also added some unsweetened cream of coconut (actually powdered cream of coconet). Everyone loved it, including some hard core dessert people! This is now a go to recipe for dessert.

Great! As I was serving a vegan crowd, I substituted a mix of almond milk and cream of coconut (to get a rich creamy flavor and texture). I used a mashed banana for the egg. Served it over a bed of Nilla wafers for a Mardi Gras. So good it disappeared instantly!

great recipe. but i changed some things for the better. first, i used half & half instead of lowfat milk. then i used coconut milk (1/2 cup) and 1 tbsp. cream of coconut instead of flaked coconut. i got rid of the papaya and increased the pineapple and banana to 3/4 cup each and finally i got rid of the cinnamon and used grated white chocolate instead. you can also add some dark rum if you like and garnish with strawberry slices.

In terms of time/difficulty/end result: a total winner. Creamy, tasty, simple. Really, really good.

A great recipe since it has fantastic flavor and is fairly low in calories in fat! Very easy and you can really use whatever fruit you have available. I used pineapple alone and my guests loved it.

Easy to make and delicious! You can use almost any fruits.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. We love creamy desserts and coconut flavor, like coconut cream pie, but this pudding allows us to enjoy the combo without overloading on fat. It is a great summertime dessert with the fresh fruit.

I should know better than to try a low fat dessert on copany. Maybe I screwed up somewhere, but the pudding was quite thick when hot, then when it cooled, it was VERY thin. And the coconut (frozen, which is the only way my store carries unsweetened coconut) was grainy in the pudding despite much blending. Yuck to the pudding. I did like the pineapple with basil, which I made as the fruit layer based on another reviewer's raves.

This pudding is at least 3 forks by itself, but instead of the suggested fruit, I alternated it in parfait glasses with the Pineapple with Basil recipe (substituting lime juice for lemon)--WOW! Now that is a low-fat dessert to write about! All of our friends loved it and went back for seconds. We liked it so much that we made it again the next day since there weren't any leftovers!

Very simple and delicious comfort food. You could probably skip the blender step if the coconut was shredded finely.

I thought this recipe was great! The coconut pudding was absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I didn't have all those tropical fruits, just fresh pineapple. It was a taste of paradise.
