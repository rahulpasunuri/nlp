I am torn between three and four forks, but I think the ease of preparation compared to the payoff pushes it into four-fork territory. I screwed mine up...the beans were slightly under-cooked, and I used too much garlic (7 medium sized cloves) that could also have been sauteed a little longer before I threw in everything else. Even still, it was pretty darned good. I used a 28oz can of tomatoes, and might even use a little more next time, as I felt like the tomatoes and sage really made the dish. Agree with the few others who said that good quality oil is helpful, but I also agree it doesn't need a full half cup. I didn't measure, but am certain I didn't go over a 1/4 cup. Such a tasty, flavorful main dish with a nice crusty focaccia and a big red. Yum!

this is one of those recipes that looks too simple to be good. but there is a lot of flavour happening in this dish! I'm amazed! I am a garlic lover so upped the garlic and added some red pepper flakes but otherwise stuck to this exactly and am already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow. Italians know food!

This was really good. I am not a planner, so I used the pressure cooker instead of soaking the beans overnight. They came out really creamy and delicious. Even my children, ages 2 and 5, liked it.

For HANNAH...I found the answer at napastyle.com, "In Italian, an uccelletto is a small bird, so to cook beans all'uccelletto means to use the same seasonings you would use for a small game bird, namely, tomato, garlic, and sage."

I have to say that this is one of my all time favorite recipes. I have been making it for years and I wouldn't change a thing. In all of my 35 + years of cooking, this is the first time I have commented on a recipe. It is that good. Distinct and earthy flavors. Exactly as it tasted in Tuscany. Highly recommend it paired with lamb, fresh tuna, or salmon and spinach as a side . Thanks for the treasure!!!

Doesn't uccelletto mean 'bird'? Where is the bird?

With the following changes - this was delicious! I used less oil and added: red kidney beans to the white, fresh thyme (as another person suggested), mini pasta shells, and frozen spinach in the last 5-10 minutes which really made it tasty.

I'll refrain from rating since I deviated from the recipe -- I only had 1/2lb of dried beans but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. It turned out more like a tomato and bean soup, but was absolutely delicious! Look forward to making it again as written.

so good!! I used a lot of the suggestions from previous reviews. Used canned beans, less oil, added thyme, red pepper flakes, and doubled the garlic. Removed 2 cups of the beans and tomatoes at the beginning and pureed in the blender and added back to the pot, also stirred in parmesan before serving and sprinkled each bowl with parmesan on top. This was a big hit at a tailgate party on cold day. We scraped the pot clean and left people wanting more. This is a great basic recipe that you can customize to your tastes and make your own.

Yes!!! Make this! Make it now!! This was *easy*, economical and oh,so good! Like one of the earlier posters said, serve with a great crusty bread and nice red wine. My whole family *loved* this. I used 3 cans Great Northern beans, 2 cans diced tomatoes, beef broth instead of water, doubled garlic and sage. This will be a regular at our house. Yummy!

Awesome! just make sure you cook the beans all the way before you add tomato.

So incredibly easy and yet so delicious. I always have these ingredients on hand, so it's perfect for when I don't really feel like putting in much effort. Definitely a family staple now!

Use canned beans and this recipe turns into a super easy last minute dinner. I added some parmesan cheese, some red pepper flakes and doubled the garlic and sage. I used a hand blender at the end to puree some of the soup and make it thicker. Nice, easy, tasty.

This was a great dish, tasty, easy, and hearty. Great the next day. I thought I had overcooked the beans, but in the end it was just creamier. Seved it with fresh baked bread and some good cheese. I also added fresh thyme with the fresh sage, and doubled the garlic, but didn't really change anything else. I would advise folks to use a good quality olive oil for this, since it is a prominent flavor.

OMG! This was one of the tastiest dishes I have EVER made. Although eating as much of it as I have done in the last 3 days has, ahem, underscored the bodily effects of so many beans! I used three cans of Northern Beans, a large can of Muir Glen diced tomatos, 5 cloves of garlic, dried ground sage and stock instead of water. Added TOOOOO much salt and had to use some potatoes to draw it out, but seriously, this is my favorite thing I've cooked in years.

Not what I expected, but very tasty. Mine came out more like bean soup.

With a few adjustments, this dish was incredibly easy to make and absolutely delicious. I used only 2-3 tablespoons of oil, instead of a half cup, which was plenty. I also used canned chicken stock instead of water, 2 cans of white beans instead of home-cooked, and a 28-oz can of whole San Marzano tomatoes. Fresh sage was key, as was a big pinch of sea salt. I wasn't expecting much from such a quick, easy weeknight dish, but the taste is really wonderful. This is going into the regular rotation.

So easy to make and absolutely delicious. I modified as follows: Substituted reserved bean liquid for chicken broth. Also added a small piece of Parmesan rind. Used 2 diced tomatoes 14.5 ounce cans and dried sage. Is wonderful with a nice piece of bread and a big glass of red wine.

Turned out very well. I quick soaked the beans by bringing them to a boil for 2 minutes then removing from the heat and letting them sit for an hour. Then cooked them in veggie broth, used 5 cloves garlic, added some yellow bell pepper and added a dash of tobasco sauce and a teaspoon of pureed chiptole pepper in adobo sauce. this gave a wonderful slightly smoky flavour. Very good!

very nice, exactly the kind of recipe I was looking for. I used 3 cans of drained northern beans, 3/4 cup of vegetable broth (instead of water), scaled back to 2T of olive oil, and 1 14.5oz can of tomatoes. I also added a dash of crushed red pepper to spice it up in addition to the fresh sage. It's a keeper.

This is the simple, perfect bean recipe I've been searching for. They're great with any grilled meat, 10 times better than potatos.

Great side dish, easy to make, went great with a lemon and sage pork chop recipe. Drizzled a little extra virgin olive oil on top when served, adds a nice touch.

This recipe was delicious! Tasted just like what they serve at my favorite Tuscan restaurant. Goes great with grilled meats.

I think the comment from Chef Lewis was invaluable. I cooked the beans with 4 cups water and 4 cups lamb stock, which I believe made a tremendous difference. I used more garlic, less oil, a 28oz can roma tomatoes, and at the end I stirred in some goat cheese. It went very well with a butterflied leg of lamb. Also the reserved lamb stock makes all the difference when added instead of of cooked down plain water.

Good basic recipe. We added a little chicken base for additional flavor and served it under a spinach cheese curry and roasted lamb chops. Goes great with beer bread and a Jacob's Creek Cabernet
