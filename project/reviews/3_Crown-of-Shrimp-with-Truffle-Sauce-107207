We chose this to make for a fund-raising dinner for our Symphony, serving six 'total strangers', so it had to be good. It exceeded expectations. We used 3 tiger prawns per person. I was leary of the chestnut puree (and in fact made a backup), but was most pleased with how the flavor and texture complimented the shrimp and truffle sauce. This was also my first time using truffles, and I was so pleased with how much lovely flavor these beauties imparted to the sauce. I used diced parsnips, celery root and sweet potatoes, and added some chopped fresh tarragon while I sauteed them (all together - that was fine). What I especially liked was how much prep could be done a day or several hours ahead of 'show-time'. It only involved about 12-minutes of active cooking time to poach the prawns and sautee the veggies. Then a few minutes to plate them, and that was even easy. Bravo!

The delicate flavour and texture of the prawns didn't gel with the root vegetables, and I didn't end up with the culinary debauchery I was expecting from these ingredients. Disappointing considering the amount of work. However, the prawns were beautifully done; I would recommend using only that portion of the recipe with lighter, fresher accompaniments.

Dear Lord, cvsuarez! Even at my school where we are immersed in "inventiveness," I've never even considered doing what you suggested. What a fabulous idea! Fabulous! And to the reviewer who dissed on it: truffles really ARE too expensive for some of us peons, esp. the broke students who are coughing up $40,000 in order to learn to cook for the rest of the world--it seems like sort of a waste of money now, considering cvsuarez has the ingenuity and forethought of many pros.

Thanks to cvsuarez for the truffle tip. Your creativity and inventiveness should be applauded. It's a clever idea for those who work in a restaurant and can get their hands on great ingredients. I'll try it myself because I always enjoy a good kitchen trick.

Oh please, BORROW a truffle??! They're expensive, yes - if you're making a parade float out of them! But a couple bucks for an oz. or so is well worth it. Use a truffle shaver - a little really goes a long way. I know someone too cheap to spring for golf clubs because he only plays a few times a year, so he borrows from people. Don't be like that guy!

BORROW a truffle!! Ask a rich friendly cook or chef to lend you a truffle, put it in a plastic bag with a couple of shelled hard boiled eggs and leave the bag in the frig for a cople of days. Return the truffle and use the white of the hard boiled eggs exactly as you would use the truffle.
