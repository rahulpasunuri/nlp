First time I attempted potato salad. This really is a good, solid recipe. The red skinned potatoes I used were too big, so I cooked them longer and ended up cutting the slices in half after cooking. I also added celery. I used lower fat mayo and sour cream, and it worked out fine... creamy with good flavor. Plus it was light.. not like heavy, drier potato salads that have eggs and bacon. And it was really easy to make.

I have never been a traditional potato salad fan--too much mayo, icky eggs--it just wasn't for me. Have been looking for a great sour cream/mustard-based recipe forever, and found it in this one! Based on other reviews, I added about four stalks of finely-chopped celery, and used green spring onions. I also had two strips of leftover, cooked bacon from breakfast that I added. This will be my go-to potato recipe from now on! And steaming the potatoes in the microwave made this quick and easy to prepare!

I found this recipe from a friend at a barbecue- who led me to this website years ago. This salad always gets such rave reviews when I bring it to events. What a great standard potato salad! You can't go wrong. My mom likes to add egg to her salad.

OMG! This recipe was delicious! I did however add thinnly chopped celery. It definately delivered some crunch. Next time I might consider adding in some crumbled bacon. If anyone tries this, let me know how it goes!

I made this for dinner tonight. Just a couple of 'personal preference' adjustments; I sauteed my onion with some pancetta before adding both to the dressing. All I can say is YUM. Excellent flavor! I can't wait to see what its like after spending a night in the fridge!

I've made this several times and we really like it. Very light and refreshing...a cool salad especially for summer. Love the touch of Dijon. Next time I will add celery as well.

I cut 9 red potatoes in 1/2 inch slices, and then cut each slice in half. then i boiled the potatoes in water with a LOT of salt added. i put the heat on medium high with only a slow slight boil for about 18-20 minutes until tender. drain and toss with distilled white vinegar and lemon juice. cooled them down in freezer for a few minutes. used food processor to separately dice parsley, 5 green onions and enough of dunbar's sweet roasted red peppers (12oz jar) to fill 1/2 cup. mix with helmann's light mayonnaise and sour cream (put 1/2 cup in instead of 1/4 cup to minimize the mayonnaise taste) and dijon mustard. peppers ended up being more pureed then diced, so i whisked them in with the above ingredients. once the potatoes have cooled to room temperature, i mixed the dressing in layer by layer with the potatoes and a tons of thinly chopped sweet celery (crescents). it is AWESOME! so delicious and worked perfectly! the potatoes are perfectly tender and not mushy and the peppers taste great! and i think the celery added a TON of extra crisp and tastes great. i would DEFINITELY make this recipe again, especially since i ate a ton of it right after it was done :)

Fantastic version of a classic. The roasted red peppers add a tangy touch (chop 'em small!) I added chopped celery and a dollop of mustard. Also used rice vinegar instead of white vinegar. Added a nice tartness. The steaming of the potatoes worked well. My friends loved it, so did I!

Mediocre. The bell pepper doesn't go particularly well with this otherwise uninteresting potato salad. The fresh grape tomatoes tried by another reviewer sounds like a real improvement.

This potato salad is great. A few changes I would make next time.... cut up potatoes into small cubes....add 1/4 cup diced celery....use green onions. its so easy.

This was an excellant potato salad recipe. Bursting with zip! I used pimentos not roasted red peppers and was still pleased. Definately a keeper. We had the Buttermilk fried chicken with spinach salad ( from this site) as the main course.

I only gave 3 forks because the salad REALLY needed some salt and pepper and some finely-minced celery to round out the flavor. I used Yukon Gold instead of red-skinned potatoes, as I prefer the waxier potato in a salad. They were wonderful steamed. The proportions of the dressing were perfect for a creamy salad, and I will definitely make it again. I didn't have roasted peppers, so I used fresh grape tomatoes, which gave a nice color and a burst of flavor that made the salad excellent.

I didn't like this recipe. It's not what I thought it would be. I was very disappointed with the results. I will not make it again.

This is a delicious potato salad. I roasted my own red pepper (just one medium pepper was needed to get 1/2 cup chopped). I have finally figured out that the key to good potato salad is a good amount of salt in the potato water and then tossing the warm potatoes with some type of vinagrette before mixing with other ingredients. Yummy! I served this on mothers day and my mother-in-law went back for seconds and couldn't stop talking about it!

This was an all around good tasting salad. I doubled all the ingredients for the sauce. My problem was the red potatoes. They didn't steam long enough and were crunchy. I took this salad to a Labor Day picnic and received no comments on it. I will probably make it again using russet potatoes, as the sauce was pretty tasty. I'm still in search of the BEST potato salad with a sour cream/dijon mustard sauce. The best I've ever tasted was many years ago in a little deli in Sunnyvale, CA. They're no longer there. Any recommendations out there?

I loved this potato salad and so did everyone else at our barbecue. I added a little more of everything in the dressing, especially sour cream and lemon, and I used a spicy hot mustard to give it some bite. I also did half And I don't know if it was the peppers I used (Melissa's fire roasted sweet red bells) but they added tremendous flavor to this dish. It was beautiful and delicious. I'd definately make it again.

Well.. I had the real thing from Zingerman's recently and made this potato salad at home! Both are delicious.. this recipe is almost an exact match!

This could have done with a bit more dressing but other than that it was delicious. I had only one complaint from one of my guests, that it tasted like store bought potato salad. Needless to say I will not be inviting this person over again for dinner. I thought it was very good and I would make it again.

I took this salad to a cookout with friends. While they all enjoyed it, I found it a bit bland. It was definitely a nice change from the usual potato salad.

I agree that the roasted peppers added more for the eye than the palatte but still it is a welcome addition! I made this for a pre-4th of July bbq and people devoured it. Definately not your average potato salad!

I made this salad for a Memorial Day cookout. It was a hit. I added crumbled bacon and thyme and used extra sour cream, as suggested. I will definitely make it again.

I loved this. I roasted the red peppers myself, and I thought they added great flavor (and color) to the dish. The flavors blended very well together. I am looking forward to making this for my family's next get-together. I think they will like the change from the normal potato-egg-celery version.

This is a great potato salad that is a big hit in my catering business. Men, women and children love it! Does well doubled and quadrupled if necessary.

I thought this recipe was tasty; however, it really needed 50% or more of the sour cream and mayo to make it really creamy. I also added pickels to it for a little extra zing. Sadly, the red peppers added more look than flavor.
