Correction on my previous review. I used Tillamook X-Sharp White Cheddar cheese, not yellow. Next time I'll go to Whole Foods or a cheese shop and try the Cantal. I just made it again tonight for another small dinner party. FABU!!

This was so excellent. I used x-sharp yellow Tillamook cheddar and will try the Chantal cheese next time. This recipe is now my go-to cheese tart. Rich yes, but also very flavorful. It was also surprisingly easy, including the crust. No reservations giving this 4-stars. You won't be disappointed.

I've said this before (yes Newkiki, you), if you are unhappy with the ingredients in a recipe, pick something else rather than being righteous & opinionated. I thought this was delicious & THAT's my rating.

I made this as soon as I received the magazine this month. It was absolutely delicious, the entire family loved it. Using Cantal cheese is best. This crust is really nice too.

I made this last night with flank steak and spring salad. It was fantastic. I ended up baking it a few minutes longer than suggested and adding a bit more nutmeg and pepper. This is great for brunch or as I did a side. If you are debating about making it, go ahead and do it. It's easy and has big flavor.

Thanks Novak! newkiwi? "you people" seriously? I'm with the flavor and rich food people, and my arteries are just fine. I am voting 4 because I have a healthy attitude towards excellent food and recipes and this looks like it is a keeper.

@newkiwi Yes, not all of us eat food food that would bore a cow. Just because you have no concept of moderation is no reason to give this recipe a poor rating, especially if you didn't bother to even try it. Btw it is fantastic.

Sounds good but, oh, my arteries!! Add up the fat content/calories of all that butter, heavy cream and cheese! Do you folks out there still eat like this?!
