I used this as a first course for an elegant dinner, and my guests were thrilled with it. The combination of the red beets and the green cucumbers was beautiful, and the taste was zesty and fresh. I used a slotted spoon to plate the vegetables so there was no extra juice on the plate. I didn't have 24 hours to marinate it. I made it in the morning and served it in the evening, and there was already enough taste to make it delicious.

I make this 3 - 4 times a year and it is fantastic. I love beets. The shallots are a good addition.

Good recipe for beets, which I always find hard to incorporate into meals. Recommend draining beets carefully before adding to cucumbers or everything will turn red.

A simple, delicious way to get your vitamins. This is an elegant and colorful way to enjoy the substantial texture and earthy flavor of beets along with the crunch of everyone's favorite - the refreshing cucumber. Or the faint of heart can enjoy their cukes alone - more beets for me!
