I'm really shocked by how much I liked this recipe. I sub the sweet sherry for apple cider vinegar (found tip online that your should use 1/2 qty vinegar and 1/2 qty water). I also used regular breadcrumbs instead of panko and I broiled the butter/breadcrumbs sauce with the fish for three minutes. It was REALLY good and the fish had a nice crisp.The marinade infused the fish with a spectacular flavor. I also just used smoked paprika from trader joe, because that's what I had. Will definitely be making this again since even my two year old loved it!

Truly outstanding. Fish was succulent and the onions superb, the sauce was a great topper. Try it, you'll like it.

followed this recipe to the nines the fish was so-so the onions were room temp maybe they wanted it to be like an onion salad I felt that they should have been heated. there are better fish dishes don't waist your time on this one.

I simplified this recipe drastically (mostly bc I didn't read the recipe until 9:30 at night and was hungry!). I eliminated all marinating, steeping, and settling time; just carmelized the onions, added the currants, vermouth (dry, not sweet), rice wine vinegar (didn't have sherry), and some honey and currants for sweetness. Simplified the panko too - just butter, garlic, lemon, and panko. Cooked the fish with olive oil, lemon, and salt/pepper. It was delicious and only took about 30 min start to finish.

Everyone I mean everyone loved the fish- Comments like "the best ever" and "fabulous and outstanding" and all wanted the recipe. I am making it again tomorrow for other company. And my husband is thrilled. And you can cut the butter in half.

Diet food? With 1c butter, 1/2c+ olive oil, hardly. And of course it's delicious: GARBAGE cooked in this much butter would be too!
