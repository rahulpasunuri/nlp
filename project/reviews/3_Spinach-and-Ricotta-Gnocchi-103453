Awesome, added feta to the gnocchi and tossed in a Gorgonzola cream sauce. Unforgettable.

I thought this recipe was really nice! I have made the recipe exactly as written a few times and it is very simple and may be too much so for our overstimulated taste buds. I would recommend tossing the gnocchi with a simple sage/butter/olive oil sauce which will enhance the flavour and texture of the gnocchi without covering them up. This recipe is fantastic as is, but it is definitely open for interpretation! I think tonight I'm going to bake them with a little cheese on top and see how that goes!

This was okay. I read the reviews after I decided to make them...useful information about removing excess liquid etc. The texture was nice and delicate. My main problem was this seemed to be too plain.

I've made this recipe two times before to great success, although adding in more flour than called for. This time I tried to triple the recipe for an upcoming dinner party. Thank goodness I planned to prepare everything in advance....what a near disaster. I used frozen spinach, squeezed dry of all water, chopped fine and then squeezed in paper towels to remove any lingering traces of moisture. I also used whole milk ricotta and drained that too. This time I used only the flour called for and chilled the dough well before forming into dumplings. It seemed to hold together fine, so I thought I'd finally succeeded in getting the dough to form together as the original author intended. Days later, when I took out the well chilled dumplings I'd formed, I attempted to carefully poach 1/3 of them in barely simmering water as I'd done before. They completely disintegrated into spinach soup. What a disappointment. After that failure, I tried to steam another 1/3 of the dumplings in a pyrex dish in the microwave with a tiny amount of water, covered with plastic wrap. Those too, also fell apart. With the last 1/3 of the dumplings, I finally came up with a solution to salvage this tempramental dough. Form into dumplings and place in a glass dish with at least 1/2 inch in between. Microwave uncovered (with no liquid) for 2-3 min. Then let stand for 2 min. This allows them to expand and set up, and firms them up far better than boiling/poaching will. After microwaving and allowing to rest, drizzle with melted butter and sprinkle with parmesan. Bake at 400 for 10-12 minutes. Serve with homemade marinara. Delicious and a way to avoid the disaster that often results from trying to boil or poach the gnocchi.

I can't believe someone added 2 cups of oatmeal to these. That is actually kind of brilliant, but I would think one cup would do fine. I have always loved spinach and ricotta gnocchi and will say another great addition to these is a touch of mace, and black pepper!

If you want to make a beautiful looking dish, serve this spinach gnocchi with sweet potato (or butternut squash) gnocchi, and potato gnochi. To save myself some work, I make a base mix without the puree, and divide it into 3 portions, addding the different purees to each one and adjusting with flour if needed (the amount of water/moisture is different for each kind of puree).The tri-color effect is stunning and delicious!!! As they're all very flavor and colorful, I like to serve them with a very light cream sauce or butter sauce with sage

They were very tasty once broiled and sauteed according to others' suggestions, but not worth the time it took. I am glad I made the once but will not make them again.

I always get a good laugh over how people don't follow recipes on this site and then complain and give them poor reviews. And now I've gone and done it! Seriously this recipe is fabulous, because it's so very forgiving. I carefully followed other suggestions, up to a point. I drained the ricotta and cooked spinach in a colander with a weight on top and squeezed out as much liquid as possible, and threw all the ingredients in my Cuisinart. It was then that I realized I didn't have any flour. So I added about 2 cups of oatmeal to the mix, and whirred it until the dough began to separate from the sides of the mixing bowl. I made a quick spicy tomato sauce with black olives, mushrooms, and lots of peperoncini to mask any oatmeal flavor, used the double spoon technique to drop the "oaty gnocchi" into a pot of boiling water, drained them, tossed them in a casserole dish, spooned the tomato sauce on top with a sprinkling of asiago, popped it in the oven, and asked my husband to remove the baked gnocchi from the oven when he heard the timer. About 45 minutes later I heard him say "Hey, you'd better hurry up before I eat the whole dinner!" I thought he was joking. Then I realized I hadn't told him about my secret ingredient. So now it's a fabulous gluten-free low carb oaty gnocchi. Yum.

Very tasty, but a bit unsightly. I halved the recipe to serve 2 as main, added garlic and parsley to butter, and added more parmesan. I broiled them for 2 minutes with the butter and cheese on top. The gnocchi held together, but the spinach bits sticking out were not attractive. Next time, I'll puree the spinach, and maybe make the gnocchi smaller.

I enjoyed working with this recipe and opted to add in a few more ingredients: small green onions, some basil and chopped sun-dried tomatoes. Taking the advice of other reviewers, I broiled them after brushing them with butter, then tossed them in a saute pan with some minced garlic, the remaining butter and olive oil. Yum!

I cut down the flour and used the technique of two spoons to drop each gnocchi into the simmering water. Other than that, made it and served it exactly as in the recipe and it was delicious

Followed others' directions to simmer the water then turn it up once the gnocchi had cooked for a bit. I didn't have any trouble holding them together and they were tender and tasty. The next time I will puree the spinach. Even the chopped baby spinach was too stringy for my taste. I definitely will make these again.

Really nice dish. Even though the ricotta we got had no excess water at all, it still required more flour, possibly twice as much as stated. (I accidentally bought wholemeal flour, but despite the bits it worked out fine). We also tossed them in a hot buttered pan on the stove instead of putting them in the oven, which made them very slightly crispy on the outside and nicely soft in the middle.

Turned out lovely. Took advice of other writers. Used the last of my homegrown spinach which wasn't as much as it called for. Squeezed it REALLY dry. Whole milk ricotta doesn't need to be drained. Also I put in one large crushed garlic clove. I used plenty of flour - a cup in the dough and lots on the board. I also made sure the water was at a BARE simmer. It turned out wonderfully, and I also served the majority as leftovers many days later. These are light and delicate. Not hard to make. Makes tons! A real treat!

I have made this recipe several times, and every time I think what a great way to get spinach in your diet! Important not to forget the butter and Parmesan cheese at the end. I always get request from my family to make this for them, and it is so easy.

awful! the gnocchi fell apart in the water and were completely flavorless - a lot of effort for nothing

This recipe was incredible and very simple, to my surprise. I broiled my gnocchi with olive oil and garlic and then sauteed the remaining garlic with anchovies and broccoli raab (That I had already cooked in some of the remaining pasta water) and butter. I tossed the warm gnocchi into the pot and sauteed them for a minute with everything else and then served it with fresh parmesean. The sweetness of the ricotta and the nutmeg was the perfect balance with the bitterness of the raab and the saltiness of the anchovies. I will definitely be making this again!!

Excellent dish, I made it with the feta cheese, broiled it in the garlic butter and parmesian cheese and then laid in in a very small pool of this Ragu sauce: http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=103230 You won't find anything better than this anywhere.

I have made this recipe many times with good success. Couple of suggestions: 1. Wilt spinach in a wok on low temp with a lid. turn periodically to keep from burning. Squeeze water out with back of a large spoon. Faster and adds less water than blanching in water. 2. Take two small spoons and form ball directly out of the mixing bowl and drop into water. Much faster than having to form each one and then transfer to tray, etc. Think of it as LEAN cooking!

I used one square pack of frozen spinach, and improvised adding the rest of the ingredients accordingly, making sure to squeeze out all excess H2O & rolling the dumplings in plenty of flour. I mixed in feta instead of parmesan for extra flavor, then took the advice of other reviewers & broiled them after brushing them with melted butter & sprinkling with grated parmesan--this last step really made the dish! Bon appetit!

I was a bit intimidated, but just trying it out for myself first so went for it. I'm glad I saved some for someone else cause they are fantastic. Used crumbled feta instead of parmesan and was liberal with flour. Also drained everything as suggested and kept the boil closer to a simmer. Very tasty!

The preparation is very quick, but the cooking is long and tedious. The recipe states the ability to prepare it one day prior to cooking, but I kept it in an air tight container up to a week, taking out and cooking a little every night.

There is a similar recipe on this site, Spinach Ricotta Gnocchi with Tomato Sauce, for which I gave a lengthy review. Those intimidated by making these gnocchi, and it is very tricky, may find my comments helpful. I hope so.

One of the prime motivators for me to try a recipe is mixed reviews. It has become a hobby. Today I made these gnocchi and they were as light and tasty as those made by my grandmother. Following the recipes precisely is not mandatory, but knowing your ingredients is vital. Well drained spinach should be dry..flour should be top quality, unbleached hard wheat flour. You get the idea I am sure. Just one hint to maintain the integrity of the gnocchi.. when they rise and the water returns to the boil, turn the heat dowm so that the boil is just barely above a simmer. That will prevent the breakdown which many reviewers mentioned.

I have made this recipe multiple times now. The first time was a bit of a disaster, because one definitely needs more flour than suggested. However, knowing that, I've made double and triple batches successfully and the dish has always been a hit either as a first course or main dish. These are light and delicious. Don't get discouraged if the batter is soft -- add flour -- it's worth the effort!

Our dear friends made and served us this dish recently. What a treat! It was fabulous!!! I'm trying it myself in the very near future.

I found the recipe definately needed more flour. It is very important to drain all liquid from the spinach and also the ricotta. It held together well during boiling and I took the advise to put in oven after pouring on the butter and parmesean to toast the cheese nice and brown. Yummy. Even my 20 month old son liked it.

Both my wife and I loved this recipe. I agree with others who stress squeezing all the water out of the spinach. Also, the amount of flour is a matter of judgment (which is probably why the recipe says "about" 1/2 cup). I usually need to add about an extra 1/8 cup in the dough and generous amounts on the board. This goes great with lots of things, but keep it simple, grilled salmon or filet mignon would be perfect. Avoid any sauces other than the butter and parm, that way the flavors really come through.

Delicious. A little time-consuming but well worth it. I used Locatelli Romano instead of parmesan which is stronger. I served it with Rosemary Roasted Salmon (Bon Appetit 2/00). Everyone loved it.

These were the worst gnocchi I've ever made. They fell apart in the water and were a complete waste of time and money. There are sooo many good gnocchi recipes out there, I don't know why this one is here.

I have made this recipe a couple of times for dinner guests. It is a fabulous recipe and the presentation is especially nice alongside a salmon dish. For the people who have difficulty with the dough, the secret is to squeeze out as much water from the spinach as possible. You can let the spinach cool down to accomplish this. When you are rolling the dough, make sure you have plenty of flour on the board. This will keep it together.

good base recipe. I modified the technique a bit, to minimize difficulty in shaping the gnocchi. First, drain the ricotta in cheesecloth over a strainer to remove excess water. Next, after dough is made refrigerate it for at least an hour. Finally, when gnocchi have been boiled place in casserole and sprinkle generously with melted butter and parmesan cheese and place briefly under broiler to bubble and brown cheese. Wonderful!! (PS you can make this ahead up until the broiler part)

Gnocchi made in this area of Tuscany is much different than potato gnocchi we are used to getting in the US. I've tried similar spinch gnocchi in Tuscany and found this similar and delicious. These are supposed be soft not firm like gnocchi you can buy frozen in the supermarket

I just don't get it! We love gnocchi, and have been trying to find a good recipe that can compare to the dishes we ate in Italy. This ended up gluey and one big mess. We experimented with adding flour and changing cooking time, with no luck. Don't know what happened.

Heavenly. I also added a dash of mace to the butter as it was melting, since I love mace with spinach. Nice.

I agree with the comments. I've made potato gnocchi and liked it a lot better because it's usually a lot springier. I didn't find this recipe difficult to make, but there are better recipes out there.

Gnocchi is supposed to be made with potatoes. That is the traditional style. This recipe was not easy, tasty or even close to what my grandmother taught me.

I question if this is a good recipe for gnocchi. I added a lot of flour, and still couldn't keep my dough from being pretty sloppy. They cooked up alright, but were a little heavy in the end. Perhaps there's too much spinach? By the way, isn't gnocchi made with cooked potatoes?

Rating: 4
To the previous writer: Gnocchi are generally pretty easy, but the addition of spinach makes them tough. I suspect your spinach still had too much water in it and you should have adjusted the flour accordingly.

what a waste of time and money. the dough was a absolute mess and i ended up with spinach soup. i had to throw the entire thing away and send out for a pizza. perhaps the flour proportion is wrong and the lack of potato in the recipe is to blame. i had such high hopes for this recipe but instead was aggravated.
