Made these for my boyfriend for V- day, and they turned out very well and tasted great. I was a little intimidated at first, having never made spring rolls before, but they were super easy to put together. I added some chinese 5 spice after reading some of the other reviews, and it definitely helped! Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

I thought these were good, but I would have liked a little more flavor... maybe some chili paste, or five-spice mix. I'm sure I'll make them again, it was very easy.

I modified this recipe by using ground chicken (insted of pork) and adding 2 tsp minced garlic to the chicken mixture. Be careful when cooking these, due to the thin nature of the spring roll skins they tend to burn very easily. I served with a dipping sauce made of 1/4 cup honey, 1/4 cup rice vinegar, a dash of red pepper flakes and 1 tbsp chopped green onions. Delicious!

Who doesn't love these tasty parcels. I read some spring roll wrap issues, if you can find "Doll" rice paper brand you will have a easy time working with them,they come in packs of 20 sheets. Making a simple syrup and adding some ginger, lime leaves and sambal makes a nice dipping sauce.

Randi--don't know if this is "authentic" to this recipe but try adding some Chinese 5-Spice (cinnamon, star anise, anise seed,ginger and cloves) I always add a little of this to my egg rolls and it's great. Go easy on it at first, and then taste--it can be overpowering.

No - you can't hold these once made, but you can pre-wrap them a bit and cover with saran. As for the seasonings, try adding portabello mushroom which gives a nice flavor. I also love pickled ginger in the filling - yummy! I agree - too many bean sprouts - needs more cabbage.

I am not an egg- or spring-roll fan, but my husband is, so I gave it a try. I omitted the shrimp because I don't like seafood, but otherwise followed it to the letter; They came out delicious! I think next time I'll add more bamboo and less bean sprouts, though, since I found their flavor a little overpowering. My husband insists that there needs to be some kind of "spice" put into them next time, though. Any suggestions?

A Cook From Lakeland, FL There is a definite difference between "egg roll" wrappers and "spring roll" wrappers. Egg roll wrappers are thicker, vs the spring roll wrappers are very thin and crispy (when cooked). A comparison would be fresh ravioli pasta vs phyllo pastry.

Yummy. I added the 2 cloves of garlic to the pork as suggested by Daryl from Rome, GA. I didn't have a problem with the rolls getting soggy. But I figured it was because I used egg roll wrappers (I 'm not sure if they are the same as spring roll wrappers or not) since I couln't find spring roll wrappers. But in any case these were wonderful.

I prepared this dish for a business cocktail party i had the pleasure to cater. It was very easy to make and the guests love each and every last one. I served the rolls with a sauce derived from the drippings that were strained from the stuffing mixture along with some asian spices and cornstarch to thiicken. I must agree with Daryl (the cook from Georgia) that these must be cooked and eaten immediately or else they will become soggy. They can be held in a 300 degree oven to keep them crisp, but just for a short time.

to the cook from ithaca: you used the wrong kind of wrappers. instead of the dried rice paper wrappers (which are vietnamese in origin and should be immersed in warm water for about 15 seconds until softer but not mushy), use the wheat-based chinese spring roll wrappers.

Easy, classic preparation. I used langostines for some of the shrimp and added a little minced garlic, too. I froze my batch of 12 dozen and fried them (partically thawed) on the beach during our annual luau. Perfect with all the classic sauces, too.

The recipe never said how to prep the rice paper which makes is frustrating for someone who is not familiar with this product.

An excellent recipe for Spring Rolls, characterized with a delicate flavor. I would suggest adding 2 cloves of minced garlic to the pork mixture for flavor enhancing. This is a delightful recipe, easy to follow, with relatively quick preparation time. The rolls should be eaten immediately as they will get a little soggy if left to sit for very long.
