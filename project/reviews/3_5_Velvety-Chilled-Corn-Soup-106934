I'm going to make this amazing corn soup again today. We make this soup at least 5 times every year during the corn season. We use only "Brentwood" yellow corn. White corn will give you a bland taste. The other reason, (beyond taste) to use yellow corn is the bright yellow color of the finished chilled soup. The white corn makes the color an off white grey color, who would want to eat that? White corn is popular becuse the farmers can grow white corn cheaper than yellow corn. The soil does not need to be turned or refortified as often. This is the problem with growing corn for fuel. The same soil is used over and over without growing a soil fortifing crop in between the corn growing season. Now the corn that is being grown to feed cows and for fuel is being sold for human consumption. Go to Safeway and you will find only white corn, this alone should be a Red Flag ! If you can not obtain fresh yellow corn in your area then you may not want to make this soup. Although if you do want the best yellow corn on the planet, then email me during the corn season and I will figure out how to ship you a box of fresh Brentwood Yellow corn. It might cost you $100 dollars but I would do it for any cook commited to fresh yellow REAL corn, not corn grown for fuel or to feed cows !! I live 45 miles from Brentwood CA and would get you a box from the corn farm when I purchase my corn and overnight ship it to you !! Then make the soup and live the experience of Yellow Corn. :) Note: if you make this soup with white corn and you "love it", fantastic!, food, wine is all about what "you like" !!

This soup was a big hit with my picky husband (why typically abhors cold foods). I used yellow corn (for color) and I sauteed the onions/shallots before putting in stock (I used veggie stock). It was a labor intensive dish, but given the response, I'd make it again.

I've made this several times and it can be fabulous BUT be sure to saute the onion first or it will always have a raw onion flavor. I always strain the solids. The color, texture, flavor are lovely.

My five year old daughter LOVED it.

While I thought this was easy to make, I have to agree this was bland. The only significant flavor was in the garnish.

It is a sad day when a recipe so spectacular gets so few forks ! Although the result is good the recipe is not detailed enough. So to get the very best chilled corn soup you ever had in your life follow these tips. 1. Always use yellow corn, white corn is used to feed cows. 2. Use a blender to liquify the corn, onions and broth, really churn it up. 3. Next use a very fine strainer to filter out the solids, then filter again, you should end up with a bright yellow silky corn cream. 4. Important that the amount of chicken stock to corn is correct, I use 7-8 large ears of corn and 3 cans of canned chicken broth, shallots and the onion. 5. When you cut the corn off the cobs put all the corn back into the broth not just 4 cups. you should never have to thin the soup with extra broth. 6.For extra flavor add a garlic clove and 1/2 bay leaf to the pot with the onions on step 1 of the recipe. 7. Make sure you season with salt after the soup is cooked and strained,add some pepper too. The creamy texture along with the rich sweet corn flavor is out of this world.

With all the busy work involved in this recipe, I told myself that my guests better really love this one. They didn't. I thought it was okay but I really like chilled soups in the summer. Many people don't like chilled soup, and the flavors in this are too bland to work chilled.

This one is bland and -- though I double-checked the recipe to be sure I'd done everything right -- turned out more watery than velvety. If I made it again, I'd consider leaving in the solids.

I thought it was extremely bland. It was a lot of work. I agree that it looked like dishwater. My husband wouldn't touch the stuff.

I adore corn and love the flavor of soups made with fresh summer corn, but this fell far short of the mark. Curiously bland with little flavor, despite the fact that I used delectable, locally grown corn to make this. This soup needs something, but I can't put my finger on just what exactly. Salt and freshly ground pepper might help. This was a lot of work with little reward in the end. It wasn't awful; just underwhelming.

found this to be too bland for my taste. i used white corn, and it needed a drop of yellow food color to make it look more like cream than dish water. if i try it again, i will roast the corn first.

Hm. This needed something but has potential. I added cayenne pepper and may serve it next time with cheddar cheese muffins. Creamy but a bit bland.

This was so fabulous! I didn't strain the solids out becuase it looked like it would taste yummy with them in. I also used white corn (it's what my vegetable stand had) so the solids made it not look so bad. I loved this!!!

This soup is unusual and my guests loved it. I added a little sugar to achieve the right sweetness.

V nice soup. I have also made a similar corn soup where you grill the corn on a BBQ (husks and all), then cut the kernels off and boil the cobs with the stock before adding the reserved kernels and pureeing once the cobs have imparted their flavour.

Wow - corn soup seems to inspire fightin' words, huh? Mark Miller has a wonderful corn soup recipe that calls for grilled corn, and I am hooked on that. Grilling gives the corn an earthy flavour and carmelizes the sugars. I don't bother pulling out the silks before grilling: if the corn is ver fresh I just grill (or oven roast) the corn. If the corn is slightly "aged" (not farmers' market fresh) then I will soak it for 5-10 minutes first, then grill/roast. Really yummy.

Bellevue: Since the recipe calls for boiling the corn in the broth that you later use as a base for the soup, I believe that grilling the corn would sacrifice some of the depth of flavor that boiling it in the broth would impart. But then again, the grill would potentially add its own nuances, so I think it's a personal judgement call. Grilling may also add dark flecks to the color of the finished product - do you care? Maybe, maybe not. Either way, enjoy!

I'm surprised that several of you have commented on the cook from NY's manners, when you yourselves have been incredibly rude... This person was not being rude at all. Perhaps you should learn a little self control.

Made this recipe for the first course of my neice's bridal shower luncheon. Absolutely delicious - I've had to send the recipe to many guests. We used white corn and the color was extremely pale. Next time I will use yellow corn and see if the end result is more pleasing to the eye. We also omitted the cucumber and slivered chives for on top of the creme fraiche.

I haven't made this yet either but I certainly intend to. (I hope no one minds if I write here, since I haven't actually made this.)I grill my corn by pulling the husks back, removing the silk and placing one layer of husks back around the corn, soaking it in water for about 30 minutes and placing it on the grill. Tastes and smells so good and I bet it will be great in this soup. As for the NYC guy, you can make better use of your time by learning grammer,typing skills and manners. This website is informational and if you're just on this site to insult people who are trying to learn, maybe you have too much time on your hands.

To NYC, you are quite arrogant! All comments are welcome here, and, besides, the cooks were asking questions!!

how do you grill your corn? I haven't tried this yet but it sounds interesting

I'm sorry, I haven't made this yet, but I'm wondering:I've developed a taste for grilled corn and am wondering now how using fresh/grilled corn on the cob would affect the taste of using *it* instead of fresh/boiled?

I got rave reviews with that soup. Delicate taste. It is a little bit of work, but worthed. Do it the day before, it's even better the following day. I will definitely do this again.
