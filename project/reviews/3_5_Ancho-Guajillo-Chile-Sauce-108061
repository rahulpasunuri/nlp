I don't know why but my sauce came out bitter...it must have been something with my chiles. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh oregano in place of dried. I've had chile sauce before and it did not taste like this. I don't think I'd risk it again.

This was amazing. First time making something like this. I used it on the Potato, Carrot and Chicken Enchiladas. You have to puree well until the bits are gone. I'm freezing some, hope that works out. Really good, not too spicy, great smoky, authentic flavor.

Excellent traditional base recipe! This is no 'gringo' recipe! Use this to guide you to create your own favorite enchilada sauce! I use California chiles, New Mexico chiles, Guajillo chilles, and, or Ancho chiles. Any combination that you prefer will work. I do not measure the salt, Mexican oregano or garlic - just add to taste (I add way more than is called for in the recipe)! Puree all ingredients before cooking. Saute puree in hot oil until the sauce reduces and is a dark red color. Be sure to use Mexican Oregano as it has a distinct flavor that gives this sauce a true authentic Mexican flavor! ENJOY! =)

This is practically identical to the salsa I make when making Posole or traditional enchiladas. This is wonderful!!!

I love authentic Mexican sauces; they make all the difference in taste of the dishes. A Mexican lady came to my house and showed me how to make several dishes; in this sauce she always added a couple whole cloves and about a half a layer of onion to the blender.

Great mix of the two chili's...I also strained the sauce,and initally heated the chili on a pan in the oven. I did add more salt, but I add more salt to most dishes..and garlic too...it was great, still have some, will use it with shrimp tonight..(actually brought the dried chili back from Florida this winter..several types, as they are not as available here..not in bulk anyway)..

This is one of the best chile sauces on this sight for ease and taste. Personally, I prefer the sauce strained without little pieces of chili skin, but that was the only thing I did different from the recipe directions.

This is great. I live in Mexico and it is great to have recipes that I can use the products that are from this area. Thanks so much
