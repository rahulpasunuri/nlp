I made this almost exactly as written and found it divine. Our lobster shells did not survive the meat-removal process, so we ended up broiling the mixture in a casserole dish instead. Make sure you have some bread to sop up the incredible sauce!

OMG...this was absolutely devine! I added a little leek with the mushrooms and substituted the sherry (cldn't find any) with Chinese Xiaoxin cooking wine with a little sugar and it turned out absolutely fantastic! Really simple recipe with brilliant results, will definitely be making this again.

We made with lobster tails, just 10 ounces - removed meat, cleaned, chopped and sautéd lightly in olive oil. Increased the amount of mushrooms. Served on white rice - made an excellent and not too heavy meal. Served with green salad. I think it could be made without the lobster - excellent balanced flavor.

A decadent meal that is easy to make and absolutely delicious. If you are squeamish about the lobsters, try asking your local fish market to clean them for you. Then simply cook them and remove the meat. My New Years Eve specialty, of course I'm making it tonight! Go ahead, try it!

I made this tonight to celebrate the completion of our kitchen remodeling. My husband says it is the BEST lobster he has ever had.

Made it last night for my birthday dinner. I did all of the cooking and making the sauce during the day. Insted of putting it back in the shells I used ramikins and toped them with buttered panko crumbs and kept them covered in the frig. To reheat I put them in a water bath and covered with foil and heated in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. took off the foil and poped them under the broiler for just a few minutes to brown the tops. I also added some minced shollots and a little more sherry. Very good recipe we will make again for sure!

Yum, made this last night using lobster tails as I, like several other reviewers, just can't bring myself to plunge a live lobster into a pot. This wasn't very difficult but did have a wow factor. I agree that a splash of lemon at the end is nice. Served with seeded bread to soak up the sauce and roasted asparagus too. Delish!

Yummy - but rich. I think this is better as a side in a surf and turf - or an appetizer rather than a full dinner portion. I think a squeeze of lemon at the end would have been good- but I made exactly according to the recipe other than just using lobster tails - so it was fast and easy.

Wow! What an excellent recipe! I only made two modifications.. I used lobster tails rather than whole lobsters (squeamish about the live lobsters), and I made puff pastry cups to serve the thermidor in rather than using the shells. My husband and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED this recipe!!! Can't wait to make it again! We are thinking of making appetizer sized pastry cups to serve it in for the holidays along with the rest of our holiday meal! YUM!

This was wonderful served in 4 1/2-inch puff pastry vol-au-vent shells. I had larger lobsters and omitted the mushrooms. (We'd had mushrooms for lunch that day and I didn't want them again at dinner.) I cut the lobster meat a little larger and because my lobsters were females, I added some of the roe (coral) put through a fine sieve. I also upped the sherry a bit because I found you couldn't really taste the small amount given in the recipe.

I have made Thermidor before but with a cream sauce versus the custard one here, and this one is far superior ! only addition I made was to add 2 finely diced Shallots to the butter and mushrooms. Because i only could get my hands on the tails, i actually served it over seared Filet Mignons ( Surf-n-Turf of any kind is my favorite, but this was beyond what i have ever made. Try it !!

I found frozen langostinos at Trader Joe - little "loberster tails?" I guess. Anyhow, I used them and I substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the cream and it made an outstanding meal. Cut the time down to 15 minutes.

Very special Christmas Eve dinner. Since I bought the lobster meat already shelled, it was quick and easy to put together. Also, my sauce wasn't at all thick, but I didn't mind. Despite the sherry and the cream, it wasn't too rich either. Next time I will try this over risotto. Homemade cole slaw is a wonderful side dish - fresh cabbage with a tsp sugar, vinegar, and mayo, plus salt and pepper to taste. It brought a taste of summer to our "white Christmas."

LOVED IT! Increased the paprika and sherry just a bit plus a dash of cayenne to pick up the finish a bit. Used diced not chopped oyster and cremini mushrooms and sauteed. Finished with mixture/custard under broiler in phyllo cups, then a fresh chive for phenominal appetizer! Crazy flavor/great presentation. Perfect for the holiday season.

This is my husbands favorite way to eat lobster. It's beautiful as well as tasty. A great way to cook dinner for any special occasion.

It's a winner as is, but more elegant over puffed pastry. Use double boiler to make the custard.

As crazy as this sounds, my husband and I turned this recipe into Lobster Thermidor mac & cheese! It was spectacular. We added a can of crab meat, too, but wouldn't do that again because it was a bit too sweet. We had a similar dish at our favourite local pub and wanted to do it at home. Don't omit the sherry - it brings all the flavours together.

I love this!!~ I make it every year for Valentines Day/my anniversary. I have my fish market steam/ crack the lobster meat. I went on line and purchased the large shells and served my thermidor inside of them. Excellent presentation and wonderful flavor!!! Trust me-I'm picky!

I made this as an appetizer course for 15 guests. Was relatively easy, but I modified the recipe to fit my needs. Instead of whole lobsters, I used lobster tails. I didn't boil the tails as suggested in the recipe. I began by using scissors to cut out a 1 inch wide area to extract the meat. After all the meat was pulled, I fanned the tails and baked them at 350 degrees for about 10 minutes to get them a beautiful red color. Then, while the mushrooms were sauteeing, I also sauteed the lobster meat in a pan with butter. When they were nearly done I combined the meat with the mushrooms. I also substituted Maidera instead of sherry. Not as good, but acceptable. Using a double boiler for the cream and eggs was an excellent suggestion - be sure to get the custard as thick as possible. Everyone raved about the Thermidor, some even suggested that it may have been the best appetizer our restaurant has done.

The whole family loved this dish. The type of mushroom is not specified, but I would recommend enoki mushrooms. Despite the high amount of butter and cream, the dish feels light and tastes like it came out of a three star kitchen. Goes well with a side of spiced saffron rice. Make sure to adjust the seasonings according to taste: you'll find that the flavors of the salt, paprika and pepper obscured by the addition of cream. Also, use a double boiler to make the custard ensures that it doesn't curdle.

Loved the recipe. I cheated to save time. I purchased lobster tails, and went from there. More expensive, but much easier. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
This was easier than I thought it would be; getting the meat out of the lobster took the most time. Instead of putting the mixture into the tails and broiling, I just poured the mixture over puff pastry and served it on a plate with steamed asparagus. I was afraid my husband would think this was "too girly," but he loved it. I would make this again, but not soon, only because I think we ate our yearly ration of butter and heavy cream in this one dish!

I made this for my husband & father-in-law for fathers day and everyone loved it. I will note that this is NOT something that you just throw together - especially when making 6 portions. I probably should have cooked and picked the lobster the day before so that my husband didn't spend quite so much of fathers day running after 3 small kids rather than relaxing. Filling but delicious and the perfect once a year extravigance.

NEVER EVER take cooking advice from Australians! There is nothing wrong with dropping lobsters into rapidly boiling water. I've been doing it for many years. Why freezing a lobster to death is preferable is a big question mark to me.

NEVER, EVER plunge live lobster into boiling water. It you do not know how to kill them properly, put them in the deep freeze for not more than 20 minutes and them cook them. (Sea water is best) I first tasted lobster 55 years ago and it is still my favourite meal. This is a real good recipe.

Very good but extremely rich. I thought the sauce tasted great even before adding the custard, which made the dish almost too rich. My wife , who professed not to like thermidor, had nothing but good things to say about this version. I added a good extra pinch of cayanne. Also, I only cooked the lobster initially for 5 minutes and then only 2 minutes in the sauce and skipped the broiling altogether.

Rating: 3
This was a delicious dish. Following other reviews, I only boiled the lobsters 5 mintues. I was making it for two people and halved the cream and eggs, so there was not a lot of sauce. I will make a full recipe next time. This dish is very quick once you have the lobsters out of their shells, but that took me nearly an hour!

This was a real treat, very tasty. I added double the cayenne to give it some extra punch. I'm NOT one of those people who's always subbing milk or 1/2&1/2 for cream, and I still found this to be VERY rich. I made the whole recipe for 2 people and it was a bit of overkill. I'd say that it would ideally feed 3 adults as an entre. Served it with a lovely NZ Sauv Blanc - YUM!

This is easy and delicious. Why would anyone precook the lobster? I shelled them raw {after killing the lobsters}, there is plenty of cooking time for the lobster, if they are precooked they get tough. I also tried this recipe with shimp and scallops and it was equally good. I added a little cayenne pepper and some saffron for color.

This dish always gets rave reviews. I agree that you need at least 1 whole lobster per person as an entree, and should be carefull of cooking too long. I have successfully substituted Marsala wine in place of the Sherry and usually add a sprinkle of parmesan prior to running under the broiler. Recently had this in Venezuela where it was made with the local spiney lobster (for about $22 including a starter and 1/2 bottle of wine).

I served this today for Christmas dinner, following the recipe very closely except for the fact that I used ramekins instead of the lobster shells for baking. Everyone raved!!! Two notes that I hope will be of help... First, one of my sons 'volunteered' (ho!ho!ho!) to help me with the dish. Lacking the proper tools, I put a hammer in his hand and told him to get that claw meat out the best way he could. lol Together, we managed to get it assembled in about 30 min -- and actually had a blast doing it. But if I hadn't had a very able assistant, this would have been extremely time-consuming and stressful!! Secondly, the recipe indicates that it serves 4. And I assumed that meant 4 entree portions. Well, NOT! As written, it just barely makes enough for 6 tiny servings as a 'starter' course. I doubled it for 12. If I'd had 14 guests, I would have been up a creek! So recruit some help and be aware of quantities. Bottom line: I splurged on $60 worth of lobster for this recipe, and it was $$ WELL-SPENT!

YUMMY!!!! I am known by family and friends as an advanced cook, and love to do gourmet items,and this is wonderful!! I used the ingredients listed exactly, but instead of using shells to serve, I served them in individual souffle bowls. I boiled the lobsters for five minutes as opposed to nine suggested in recipe, and the lobster was "al dente". You have to be very careful when cooking this delicate meat, too long and it becomes chewy and tough. Cook them a little less (stil opaque inside), and they will finish cooking when added to the cream and then broiled. I made a creamy wild mushroom saute with crostini for the appetizer, and started with a ceasar salad, then served the thermidor with garlic bread (made a paste with olive oil, butter, parsley, and kosher salt for the bread, and used a baguette instead of italian, this is much more delicate, oh, and of coarse like 50 cloves of garlic!!!) and put it in the oven on lower shelf while thermidor was under broiler. both items were ready at the exact same time! I also served this with mushroom risotto. We had a bottle of champagne with this, and for dessert a staggs leap chardonnay (very nutty and smooth) with an apple baked in puff pastry and fresh whipped cream. This was a perfect combination, guests were actually drinking the sauce from the souffle cup after finishing the lobster! EXCELLENT!!

This is the recipe I've been searching for for 45 years. My Dad took me to the 'Kings Restaurant' in Hollywood, Ca. in Nov. '52 and this looks and tastes exactly as I remember the dish. Wonderful!

Faaantastic! Next time, I will boil the lobster for 5 minutes versus 9. I used oyster mushrooms and will use them again. 1 1/2 lb lobster per person seems about the right portion.

Made it for New Years Eve (followed the direction exactly), using a 2 lb lobster and added some poached scallops to the lobster mixture. It was fabulous!! I'm trying it tonight - this time having my local grocery store steam the lobster while I continue my shopping, then just assemble everything when I get home.

Absolutely wonderful! I made this recipe several times and I love it. I serve the lobster in the shell over plain rice. It is delicious.

AWESOME. Served it to close friends for a special Christmas dinner with some of the reserved sauce, and warm butter for an alternative. Instead of 2 lobsters serving 4 people, prepared 4 lobsters to serve 4 people without doubling any other part of the recipe. Nothing but compliments.

Although this is a expensive meal to make, I would do it again.I made the following changes to the dish, using another receipe to compair, I added 2 tablespoons of Gruyere cheese and 2 tablespoons of parmesan cheese to the custard mix and sprinkled a little parmesan cheese over prior to browning, also I used small oven safe bowls for cooking instead of lobster shells.
