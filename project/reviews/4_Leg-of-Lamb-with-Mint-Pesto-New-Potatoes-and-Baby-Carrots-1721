I used boned leg of lamb from Trader Joes. I removed it from its mesh bag and rubbed pesto on and stuffed it back into the mesh bag. When using a boneless leg, 140=medium. Marinating overnight is a must! Vegetables turned out soggy but good.

This recipe was absolutely fabulous. Even my picky 2 year old loved it. I changed the pesto recipe somewhat. I used 1 cup mint and 2 cups basil because thats what I had on hand. The only downside was the cooking times were a little off. By the time I added the carrots, the lambs temp was over 140. Next time I make the recipe, Ill adjust the cooking times.

I was a little turned off by the unattractive greying/browning of the pesto on everything: carrots, potatoes and lamb. Tasted good (couldn't really taste the mint), but looked yucky. There are other lamb recipes that I will use next time.

I never ate leg of lamb (let alone cook one), until I met my husband. I was nervous about making this. It was simple and delicious! I've been making it for him for 18 years now! The mint pesto is what makes it so unique. I lost the paper recipe and was thrilled to find this on the web site! Enjoy!

I don't eat meat but made this for my husband and two friends who do and they thought this recipe was perfect. I followed the roasting times exactly and it came out rosey pink. I loved the taste of the mint pesto and used it for my pumpkin gnocci. Very easy and you can prepare everything a day ahead and you can actually be with your guests instead of being in the kitchen cooking. This goes into my permanent recipe files. Thank you Epicurious.

High marks to the whole recipe - I also used a butterflied leg of lamb, and seved the mint pesto as a condiment. I think we lucked out with an unusually fine leg of lamb. THe mint pesto is a refreshing variation on a mint accompanyment to the lamb. My fiance loved it.

Made this yesterday for my new hubby! He loved it so much, he asked for seconds. I used a boneless butterflied leg of lamb, everything else was exactly the same.

The lamb was fabulous. Succulent, tender and flavorful, and the scent of the pesto marinade filled the house yesterday. A beautiful Easter dish, will definitely make this again.

Very tasty and simple to make...marinate overnight to ensure that the flavors are strong.

My kids had seconds and thirds of this lamb roast which for my daughter is amazing. I didn't have walnuts so used almonds instead. Also didn't have enough fresh herbs so added dry and it was still delicious and tender and moist.

Made this for Easter, and it was a crowd-pleaser (among a crowd that typically do not like the idea of eating lamb). My oldest nephew tried it for the first time and had 3 helpings! I think I overcooked mine as well, but it still tasted great well-done.

The best lamb yet! My husband, the food critic at our house, gave it a standing ovation and conceded it's as good as his marinated grilled lamb. We are growing fresh mint and basil, so I made the recipe to utilize them. Before winter sets in, I intend to make and freeze the mint pesto so I can make this lamb for company in the winter months. I let my lamb sit overnight and all day the next day. I'm lukewarm about lamb, but this showed me I can truly enjoy it. Try this easy and delicious recipe.

Made this for Easter dinner last year. Very nice flavor - although I overcooked the lamb (which I usally do - I'm trying to get better) Will try again.

Just served this for Easter Dinner - delicious. Substituted pine nuts for walnuts and had to put the potatoes back in the oven for half an hour to let them cook through. Great make ahead meal.

I'll be making this recipe tomorrow, then I'll review. It does sound fabulous though. Commenting on annoying Tums ads--lose them please, very irritating and makes my computer work even slower than it does now with Comcast as my server...another gripe!

I've made this recipe every year since it came out in 93? My family loves it and is an annual Passover/Easter request. It's simple and delicious.

I made this for Easter 2001, and it was a big hit, even considering that many of the guests had never tasted lamb. The roasted vegetables were particularly good.

Delicious and so easy! Perfect for a spectacular Easter dinner. Everyone loved it! Used pine nuts instead of walnuts, thanks for the tip! Great for a dinner party because everything can be done ahead.

this is a great leg of lamb recipe. makes plenty of pesto good on potatoes and carrots too. pine nuts substituted and overnight marinated. delicious.

This has become our new Easter meal. I use pine nuts in place of walnuts, but either work well, and I suggest preparing the evening before and letting it chill overnight. You'll get better flavor.

quite good - would definetely make again -- I made a gravy out of the pan juices adding just a touch of fresh mint - quite tasty

Absolutely delicious! I made it for a party and everyone loved it, it is also easy because everything is in one pan and you can start it the night before. The cooking times where wacky though, not enough for the potatoes too much for the carrots and the lamb should cook till about 150-155 degrees.

I made this when it appeared in 1992 and had lost the recipe. I was so pleased to find it again online. I have made this for people who swear they don't like lamb and they love it.
