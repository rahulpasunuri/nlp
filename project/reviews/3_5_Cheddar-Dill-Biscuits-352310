My batch only made 6 biscuits, but they turned out really tasty. This is one of the easiest recipes that I have used to make fresh baked biscuits. Yummy!

I can't say I particularly liked this recipe. The sharp cheese was lost, I couldn't taste the dill at all. Though, it did smell very good while it was in the oven. Just disappointed with the flavor.

We made these exactly according to the recipe, except for substituting dried dillweed (1 T.) for the fresh dill. Excellent! Making them big and tall and cooling them before serving is correct. For lunch, we're going to split the leftovers and fill them with paper-thin slices of ham.

These need no butter or other embellishment. We are going to split the leftover biscuits, fill them with some paper-thin slices of ham, and call it lunch.

Gonna be honest..the flavor was weird to us. The texture was delicious, but there was something about the combo of cheddar and dill that didn't work. IF I make them again I might substitute a different cheese, perhaps parmesan.

These are quick to make and really tasty! They were crisp on the outside and flaky inside.
