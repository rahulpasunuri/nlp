I made these for a friend who is gluten free. She liked them very much, as did others who do not need to eat gluten free. They were very easy to make. I think they would be good dipped in some chocolate as well.

Easiest and best PB cookie recipe I've ever tried. Love this one, and my gluten-free friends do, too!

These are just good, simple peanut butter cookies. They are not too sweet and they have the perfect texture - a little crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. I'll try using brown sugar instead of white sugar next time.
