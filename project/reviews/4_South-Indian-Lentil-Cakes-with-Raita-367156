Disclaimer: I never made the raita. However, I have made the lentil cakes twice. The first time, I did as another reviewer had and par-boiled the legumes/rice and let soak while I prepared the other ingredients. The texture of the cakes was totally fine, but I found the cakes to be generally lacking in flavor and spice. Again, this may have been because I didn't make the raita. The second time I made these cakes, I used the jalapeno seeds, more cilantro and mint, and moreover followed the soaking instructions. I was again frustrated. Maybe because I used an immersion blender and not a proper food processor my patties were grainy and crunchy instead of smooth. I need to find a better recipe.

Made this several times with whatever ingredients I had at home and it is a hit with everyone including my 3.5 year old! It is full of flavor and healthy- what could be better?

This was so delicious!! I want to put the yogurt sauce on everything. They little cakes are much more filling than you might think too, so good!

Wonderful! Full of flavor, and very healthy and filling. The cakes held together well and turned out crispy brown. I love the Raita, and the garlic really amps up the flavor.

This is a really excellent dish. I didn't read the recipe close enough and didn't realize you had to soak the legumes for so long so I compromised and par-boiled the legumes and the rice (about 3 minutes) and then let them soak for an hour while I got everything else together. Not having tried the other version, I can't really say how they compare but they came together perfectly this way. They didn't fall apart at all and still had some crunch in the finished product. I found the Raita a little bland so I put in more cumin and a touch of ancho chili pepper powder which made a big difference, imho. We paired the cakes and raita with baked arctic char but I think this would be a good dish on its own.

This was an interesting recipe to try but not tasty enough to make again.

Made this as directed, and will make it again for sure. Easy, delicious, good nutrition. I fried the lentil cakes a day before serving and then re heated in the over. They were fine, but even better fresh out of the frying pan.

Wow! I don't even know what more to say about this recipe. It was unbelievably delicious. Light, refreshing, the flavors are so well-blended, yet distinctive. I processed all the lentil cake ingredients together, even though it said to only use the food processor on the first 4 or 5. I thought this worked well, because then everything sticks together really well. I also used baby spinach leaves, and as peas were out of season, I used frozen peas. Worked fine. I also let the rice & lentils soak for about 7 or 8 hours. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe nearly as described, but followed a previous reviewers suggestion to chop the spinach, cilantro, etc together first in the food processor, set aside, and then process the lentils and rice, per the recipe. I didnt bother with the roasted garlic though Im sure it would have added a richness to the dish. Next time, I would increase the ginger , cilantro and mint, and add some cumin to the lentil cakes. But even as is, this recipe was a big hit at my dinner table, and I will definitely make it again!

Not a review--32 of the 34 reviews are the same review--the submitter either kept pressing the submit button because it didn't show up immediately (don't do that, by the way) or there's another glitch. If you are looking for the reviews, the very last page at the bottom as the 3rd discreet review.

For the amount of time this recipe demands, I was hoping it would be better. The lentil cake itself is good...sort of like a spicy falafel. The raita was bland, but in a way that IMO was not the best complement to the lentil cake. I almost think a mango chutney would have been better. When I had a bite of the cake with the raita and the roasted garlic it was better, although the taste of garlic was, in some bites, a little overpowering.

These were delicious! I used the ingredients listed, with the suggested substitution of spinach for pea tendrils, but simplified the preparation by tossing all of the ingredients except rice, lentils and peas into the processor first, and processed until finely chopped. Then I added the rice and lentils (which I had soaked for 3 hrs) and processed until the consistency of a thick paste. I added the peas and used on-off turns until the peas were coarsely chopped. I made the mixture several hours in advance and kept covered in the refrigerator. The raita and roasted garlic cloves were perfect accompaniments.

There cakes were delicious - although delicate flavor - could probably add dry spices to batter if you wanted something stronger. I used red lentils which visually contrasted the green peas and arugula nicely. I should have chopped the arugula. The fresh green peas out of the pod were perfect. I soaked the beans/rice for 3 hrs, I'd like to try soaking them before work and see if they still turn out ok after 8 or 9 hrs of soaking.
