I too didn't have time to drain the yoghurt. It would have been nicer if I had done so. It really should sit together for a few hours anyway so next time I'll drain the yoghurt. Very tasty regardless of the thickness.

I modified it slightly. I padded a collander with paper towels, and chopped one cucumber, seeds et. al, and added a healthy bit of ground sea salt, and let it sit for a few hours. Then I put it in the fridge overnight. The next day added the yogurt, lemon, oil, garlic, sea salt, baby mint leaves and "a lot" of dill. Put it in the fridge for a half hour. It was wonderful.

Delicious! I used whole milk yogurt and doubled the garlic. It was wonderfully creamy and quite tasty.

I made this recipe yesterday without the dill, as I had none on hand. I let it sit and marinate in the fridge for a couple of hours and it was very good. I simply used plain yogurt, garlic, salt and pepper and lemon juice and dipped with toasted pita bread. I love dill and plan to put that in the dip next time. I also forgot to add olive oil, which may have made for a better consistency.

SHOPSKA in Greek/Bulgarian. This is a great friend with roasted lamb and grilled peaches and pears. Amazing. I add mint leaves and a little cilantro.

I've tried different versions but this is the best. It is great on homemade gyros. I've made it many times and it always turns out great!

Excellent. Make sure to use lemon juice instead of lime juice.

This is a basic recipe that is very good! This is labeled as a "dip" but I also use it as a sauce for pita sandwiches of different varieties-- with falafel sandwiches it is great! Sometimes I substitute dill for dried mint, and press raw garlic with a dash of salt (at the same time) which gives it a beat of heat.

I am very pleased with this recipe! It tastes even better than those in restaurants. I drained the yogurt for about 4 hrs & only hand squeezed the chopped cucumber. Stick to the required amount of garlic, any more will make it too spicy/pungent. I also added a bit of sugar for taste. It turned out a winner!

Simply and tasty, I served it with a range of other dips made from recipes from this website (hummus and an eggplant dip). I didn't drain the yoghurt (I used one that called itself "greek style") and it turned out fine, not runny at all.

Don't worry too much about draining the yoghurt. I didn't bother with it, so the dip was a bit thinner than it should be, but it was still fine.

This was an excellent recipe, and I will continue to make it over and over. A Perfect, low fat dip for summer. I added an extra clove of garlic, because I happen to be a garlic lover. It was great!!!!

Didn't taste a bit like the real thing, not like what I had in Greece at all.

This was the perfect summer dip... light and refreshing. I served it with pita slices, cucumber slices and cherry tomatoes -- all of my guests loved it!

I read the reviews and someone suggeseted almost doubling the garlic, which I did. It was still not garlicy enough for me. Next time I will double the garlic and add 3 t of dill instead of 2.

This recipe is terrific. I use dried dill and a little extra lemon juice because I like mine to be very flavorful. I also salt mine to taste. I make it every couple of weeks all summer long.

I didnt drain the yogurt for more than just a few minutes and it turned out fine. I almost doubled the garlic and that gave it an extra hit! Definitely a concoction I'd serve with pride and definitely it gets better with every passing hour as the flavours mix!

Everytime I make this everyone demands the recipe even though I cheat by using fat free yogurt. I definately add plenty of extra dill and nice firm cukes is a must. My boyfriend even hid a batch from his roommates once!

very very good. I would add more dill next time.

I made this with no changes and liked it quite a lot. However, when I served it to group of six people, I found that three of us liked it and three of us did not think it was so hot. I can only assume that this is a dish that is not universally loved although there are those of us who would love to eat the entire bowl with homemade melba toast, fresh vegetables, or chips of some type.

My daughter used this at a luncheon. She broiled chicken breasts, cut into strips, marinated in olive oil and lemon. She served it in a pita bread with the cucumber dill as a sauce. It was really great! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipie.

I thought this recipe was good and would make it again but it was not "knock your socks off good". I used 2 cloves of garlic which was plenty garlicy for me but I did find that I needed to add quite a bit of salt (approximately 1 Tlbs). I took this to a gathering with some carrotsticks and pita bread triangles and people seemed to like it.

I was yearning for cucumbers and yoghurt when I made this dish, and it still held no appeal to me. It was virtually tasteless.
