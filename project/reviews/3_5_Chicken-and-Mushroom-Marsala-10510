So, this was really yummy. The chicken was absolutely perfectly cooked. I followed the suggestions to increase the mushrooms and liquids -- and was glad I did; we ate every bite of the extra sauce -- but that increased the cooking time significantly; it was almost two hours from when I started cooking till the chicken was ready. I served it with brown rice (delicious with mushrooms) and Caesar salad, and everyone loved it.

Fabulous & easy! I threw in a strip of locally made, organic, smoked bacon to flavor the mushrooms & onions. It added an earthy, something special! A great recipe, for sure.

I made this for my roommate because he likes mushrooms, so I doubled the amount of mushrooms and sauce. In the end, I wasn't impressed with this dish. It lacked something. I even added extra spices but that didn't quite make up for it. It tasted OK but more like the mass-produced fare you would get in a restaurant vs a gourmet-style meal. I'm going to look for a better recipe for Chicken Marsala.

This is a quick and easy delicious meal. I followed the instructions and the sauce was thick and delicious. Others mentioned that they had trouble getting the sauce thick enough. If you reduce the sauce as per the directions this will not be a problem. Definitely a repeat.

overall pretty good, but I suggest pounding the chicken breasts without skin, It should give the chicken more flavor.

I really enjoyed this recipe! It is very easy to make, so it would be a perfect weekday meal even after a long day at work. I agree with those who recommend increasing mushrooms, but that's the only change I would make. Yum!

Rating: 3
Not necessarily exciting, but yummy all the same. Would definitely recommend more of the wine/broth ratio and more mushrooms to the meat so that there is more juice. In addition, put small amount of corn starch (probably 2 T whisked with 2 T water) in after liquid had reduced to thicken just a touch. We served it with whole wheat angel hair pasta, asparagus and a spring green salad combo with balsamic dressing. Some additonal chopped fresh parsley for the top of each plate for presentation. Delicsh!

This recipe was so amazing. I did everything pretty much to the tee, but added extra mushrooms. I should have actually used more chicken broth and Marsala too, because I felt like we needed more sauce (most of it evaporated off), but it left everything really yummy and tasting like the sauce. I served the chicken with steamed spinach and plain pasta with olive oil and Parmesan and it was really delicious. My boyfriend came back for seconds on this one. Making it again tonight.. and adding more sauce!

Nice recipe. Easy to make! I made a larger amount of mushrooms and broth so there was enough sauce to pour over rice.

I made as written, except I used skinless chicken breasts. I did not pound or dredge the chicken. It took me 1 hour to prepare. I used a whole onion as called for; that was way too much. I would only use half an onion in the future. The recipe was not extraordinary, but I would certainly make it again.

Very delicious, very easy to prepare. I used 2 lbs. skinless, boneless, thinly-sliced chicken breasts (shortens cooking time and more pieces to go around!) Restaurant fare for half the price.

I find that chicken can be rather boring at times. This recipe was pretty easy, and turned out VERY delicious. Using a mandoline made slicing the mushrooms a breeze. Use Marsala from the liquor store is a must, not the grocery store kind. I Will definitely make this again.

This was OK, but I thought there would be more flavor. I kind of missed the cream, but not the calories of the cream. I think a splash of Marsala at the end might do the trick.

For all of the purists that think a review and rating must be exactly the printed recipe, do not read on. I just threw together a terrific meal based on this recipe and another Chicken Marsala with Sage on this site. So I tossed in a fair amount of sage and, because I love it, I added slivered pancetta as I was cooking the mushrooms. It was terrific. I served well seasoned green beans on the side and we loved it. I would never discard perfectly good fat when I needed more for the next step or for the beens. Cooks Illustrated has a great Chicken Marsala and I remember that they think one of the secrets is to use sweet Marsala rather than dry, which is what I do now.

I have been using this recipe for Passover Seder for years. Since I can't use butter with meat, I substitute Earth Balance (organic) margarine and the flavor doesn't suffer. I make it a day in advance using bone-in thighs, and drizzle a little more marsala when rewarming to serve. It is a classic recipe and requires no futzing around.

Added some chopped fresh sage to the mushrooms and onion while cooking. Good recipe and without cream this is a little easier on the body. I pounded the chicken breast to reduce height and have them cook evenly.

I didn't read all the reviews, so maybe someone else has suggested this already, but my favorite Italian restaurant in Chicago (Roseangeles) does this using portabella mushrooms cut in about 1/3 inch thick strips. SO good. They also put a nice chiffonade of basil on top when serving it.

This one is realy easy and does not contain flour filler. I modified this by cutting the breast into cubes instead of cutlets, the sauce coats nicely, but I increase the marsala by a 1/2 cup and keep tasting for balance until it just right.

I made this for my Italian mother recently and she raved about it. It tasted even better the second day. I am not a very good cook and can barely boil water, but this was easy to make. You MUST double the chicken stock and wine. I used one cup of each and still could've used more. Another key is to use a decent Marsala wine. This has become the only marsala recipe I'll ever need.

Rating: 4
I love this recipe and everyone I have made it for loves it! I added 3 different kinds of mushrooms (shitake, portobella, white button), shallots instead of onions, 2 garlic cloves, more parsley and some thyme, and also added more chicken stock and marsala. Served with garlic mashed potatoes with rosemary. Yum! I am on a salt restricted diet, and just omitted salt, and I decreased the butter in the sauce to make it (somewhat) healthier.

Rating: 2
I used portobello mushrooms lightly breaded the chicken (which was beautiful) but the mushroom sauce was incredibly bland. It seemed to need more flavor, I added more salt and pepper and some cherry tomatoes I had around for added color but was disapointed. Next time some sage, tyme or rosemary.

This was good, but far from great. Too many onions, not enough Marsala. Might try again with sweet Marsala and porcinis or shitakes. Easy to make, but needs some help.

Rating: 3
Excellent! I followed a number of recommendations from other cooks and made a few changes of my own. I took the advice of an earlier cook who suggested reducing some of the marsala with olive oil and butter, and this intensified the flavor. I also used less broth and more marsala (in addition to the reduced marsala). Since I don't like onions, I used several small cloves of minced garlic, together with garlic oil instead of regular olive oil; the garlic didn't overwhelm, but did add an extra layer of flavor. A couple of mistakes also turned out well: after browning and removing the chicken (which I'd pounded, floured and cubed, like earlier cooks), I added the reduced marsala to the pan first, before the garlic and mushrooms; fortunately, this worked out well, and the mushrooms absorbed the wine. Then, I mistakenly added the wine and broth together, but this also worked out fine. Rather than just add the last portion of butter to the sauce, I melted it in the pan I'd used for the reduction and whisked in some flour, which I cooked for a minute before adding it and the chicken to the sauce. It just goes to show--even those of us who are far from expert can make this dish work! Thanks to all who made suggestions!

Used boneless and skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts but didn't use any butter, just olive oil to saute the chicken. Drained ALL the fat out and added 3T olive oil which I then heated in the same pan and to which I added lots of rehydrated porcini mushrooms plus some fresh wild mushrooms along with TWO sliced onions and shallots and garlic as recommended by others. I also doubled the marsala, added a cup of dry white wine, and doubled the chicken broth. Used both doubled parsley and some lemon as an earlier cook suggested. This was the MOST DIVINE chicken I've ever made!!!!!!(According to my whole dark-meat loving family....)

Like others I made modifications, but I thought this was a good base recipe.

All in all it was deemed a success.

I made a few variations to this recipe and it was delicious!! I took the advice and used more marsala and more chicken stock. I also thinly sliced a medium shallot and added a clove of chopped garlic. I pounded the chicken breasts out to about a qaurter of an inch thick and lightly coated them in flour which I added Itilian seasoning and some freshly ground pepper and salt to. I reduced the stock to about half, but will reduce it slightly more next time to make it a bit richer. All my guests loved it and I am sure the next time round will be even better.

Rating: 3
This is a classic. Agree with other reviewers that you have to be patients and let the sauce reduce enough. Had lots of left overs the next day so I cut up the chicken into bite sized pieces, cooked some pasta, warmed the sauce, poured it over the pasta, added some shaved parmesan and had the best chicken and mushroom Fettuccini ever.

Rating: 4
Delicious - my husband is full blooded Italian and loved this dish. I did not bread the chicken because I did not want to muddy the sauce with breading. Cooking down as required gives the sauce a rich, thick, creamy texture without having to add creamed ingredients. I did add some slowly sauteed garlic and left the marsala and chicken broth ingredients as recommended. At first it seems way too saucy, but, patience pays off with unparalled smooth, rich flavor. I purchased boneless chicken breasts and pounded them until thin. They were moist and tender when sauteed, with a beautiful golden brown exterior. They did cool off while the sauce ingredients were cooking down, however, adding them back into the sauce as recommended, warmed the chicken sufficiently. I did, however, double all sauce ingredients. I served the Chicken Marsala alongside penne cooked al dente with butter, fresh parsley and sauteed garlic. This is now a family favorite recipe and one we will enjoy often.

i'd wanted to recreate the incredible chic marsala we always order out & when i actually got down to it, thought i should generally follow a specific recipe 1st. altho not mentioned in this recipe, when i was at the wine store i discovered a SWEET marsala exists & knew that would do the trick when i got around to making this. after reading several reviews: used boneless/skinless chicken breasts, lightly pounded & then lightly floured to keep the meat moist. probably ended up doubling/tripling ingredients for sauce (i LOVE the sauce to begin with). to address one cook's concern about the chicken cooling too much while the sauce reduced, i started reducing half or so of the marsala in a separate pan with some olive oil & butter, while i prepped the chicken. after the chicken was browned, (boneless/skinless) there was no need to discard anything resembling chicken fat. considering the overall amount of sauce i wanted, still only used a small scallion & added, too, a healthy tablespoon of minced garlic to the pan the chicken was browned in. after adding broth & cornstarch slurry, simmered the mix several minutes, realized i should have added my pre-reduced marsala & the remaining marsala (it turned out fine). add remaining butter, as much freshly chopped parsley you'd like. after butter is incorporated, add chicken & turn through the sauce a few times & serve (over cappellini), with sauce spooned over the top of the chicken. think next time i'll reserve 1/2 the mushrooms until sauce is almost reduced. if you have more sauce left over than you know what to do with, spoon it over any leftover cappellini and save it for breakfast! TOTALLY awesome!

Excellent dish! All in all, it is an easy, forgiving recipe. I added a clove of chopped garlic with the onions and mushrooms and a pinch of dry rubbed sage with the marsala (which I too doubled upon the suggestions of previous raters).

This was very easy to make after work. I listened to other reviewers and cubed the chicken and floured it which reduced my cooking time to about 10 minutes instead of 15.

I like the marsala flavor and there was not much of it in the sauce after it had been cooking for a while. Very easy and I would definitely make again.

I make this as-is frequently and it is ALWAYS a hit. I've also adapted it to my crockpot for work nights by using boneless chicken breasts and reducing the amount of broth. Toss all of your raw ingredients in to the crockpot and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours. It's the best smell you'll ever come home to!

This was very tasty, although I wish I had read all the reviews prior to making - I will definitely switch the proportions of wine and broth next time and double the sauce. I did sub shallots for onion, though, and that worked out very well. Nice flavor. One question - on simmer, it took a long time for the sauce to reduce. In the meantime, the chicken sat around getting cold, even covered up to stay warm. I'm concerned that with doubling the sauce, this problem will be even worse. Did anyone else have this problem or have a good solution?

I made this for a dinner party, and it was a big success. I pounded the chicken halves until they were thin, though, and lightly floured them before I browned them.

I made this dish tonight, and my husband and company loved it. My sister who always orders Chicken Marsala at fine dining restaurants said my chicken was really good! I made only a few changes. I did not flatten the chicken so when browning the chicken breasts in the olive oil and butter, I covered the skillet to cook the chicken all the way through. Also when it calls to discard all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet, I did not. I left it all in the skillet. I think it made more sauce in the end. My chicken was very moist and very tender. I think this was an amazingly tasty dish. I will definately make it again! And Soon!

This is a great recipe. However I find that if you use dry marsala, 1 whole cup is good, and if it is sweet marsala use the recommended amount. In addition to this recipe, at the last step before serving, I add a worcestire flour mixture to thicken and flavor the sauce. This mixture is 1/4 cup of cream, 2 tsps worcestire, and 2 tsps of flour. This was included in a different recipe for Marsala, and it does improve the flavor and the consistancy of the sauce. In addition, I find that using the sweet marsala is the best!

I've prepared this dish several times and it has become a favorite in our household, both because it's so easy to prepare and because it looks and tastes simply fabulous. This New Year's, I modified the recipe just a little to make a sauce for game hens and the result was awesome. I usually prepare this dish according to the recipe with the following exceptions: I use skinless breast of chicken and I substitute port for the marsala. I know - it's not Chicken Marsala anymore, but it is simply delicious.

While I do think that this dish was definitely good, it did not live up to my "Marsala" standards. I followed the recommendations to swap stock and wine amounts, but I halved the chicken as there was only two people. Perhaps I did something wrong in the prep. but the end result had a somewhat bitter flavor to it, almost acidic. I may try again, but I think I will search for another "marsala" recipe.

First try at this recipe was bland and thin, so I've incorporated other people's suggestions. Pounded chicken breasts, seasoned with S&P and Montreal Chicken spice (Costco) and dredged in flour before sauteeing.

This is such a delicious recipe. I dredged the chicken with some flour before browning it. Instead of using onion, I used two shallots. I also doubled up on mushrooms, dry marsala wine and thickened up my sauce with some flour (cooked it first with the mushrooms and shallots so it doesn't have that raw taste). I left about 1/4 sauce in the pan and tossed it with some cooked linguine and chopped parsley. It was fabulous!!!

Really enjoyed this recipe. I used pork tenderloin instead of chicken, as it was what I had on hand. Turned out fairly well, just had to watch the "timing". I increased the marsala to 1 cup as well...the only thing I would do differently is not let the sauce boil down so much, or add more marsala and broth, as I like having a little more sauce left. I like to serve this over rice or pasta, and there simply wasn't enough "juice" left to coat it.

We thoroughly enjoyed this dish. Followed reviewers advise and chopped the onion fairly fine and increased the marsala to 1 cup. Did add a little cornstarch at the end to thicken. Used boneless skinless chicken breasts pounded flat. The many pages of 4 forks on this should be a dead give away to what a great recipe this is!

My husband and I loved this dish - I have even made 2 huge trays of it for a party. I dredged the chicken cutlets in flour before I fried them however. Also, the chicken did not seem tender enough to me, so I poured the sauce and chicken into a pan and put it in the oven for 10-15 minutes - it came out tender and delicious.

I recommend Tripling the sauce. 32 oz. of low sodium chicken broth and a whole bottle of SWEET Marsala wine. I've never seen onions used at a restuarant, so I didn't use them. Try lightly dusting the chicken in flour first before browning the chicken. and let it simmer for longer then suggested, about 40 minutes.

The entire dish was great. When making it again I will triple the ingredients for the sauce & use about 8 or 9 Portabello mushroms sliced fairly thick, 1/2", for a full 6 servings.

This is one of my favorite recipes on Epicurious. It has a nice light flavor. I too omitted the onion because I'm not a fan. I thought the sauce was delicious but too runny. I will try adding a cream next time.

Because the majority of readers suggested to double marsala, half broth, then double entire amounts, lightly flour breasts, I decided to follow suit. I always flatten breasts because the texture and flavor is better in my opinion. But next time I make this, if I make it again, I will definitely pass on flouring the breasts (and I just barely dusted). After adding the chicken back to the sauce, the "crust" of the floured chicken disintigrated and became soft...yuck! In order to have a great texture on browned chicken (without flouring it) make sure you have COMPLETELY dried the breasts prior to frying, and the temperature of the pan must be VERY HOT (but not on high) BEFORE adding the breasts. The flavor of marsala was stronger than I would have preferred and enough sauce for about 5 pieces of chicken, and I'm a "heavy on the sauce" person. In the end, I also added a touch of cream to thicken the sauce. Im not an onion ring fan at all, so I think I'll chop them finely so they are less conspicuous and become more of the sauce (they also work more as a thickener this way too, if done right). Next time I make this recipe, I plan to follow the recipe as written (adding flattened chicken), so I can see where the adjustments, if any, really need to be made.

I will definately be making this recipe again! My husband and I loved it. My only suggestion would be to double the sauce recipe as it does get very thick. I also used chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts. As always with tenders the cooking time is less, so be aware of over-cooking. However, the benefit is that it becomes an easy weeknight recipe.

Rating: 4
This recipe was fabulous, although, I had to follow the suggestions from the cook from Littleton, CO dated 12/8/02. Those were wonderful suggestions!! I doubled the amount of mushrooms, which ended up being the perfect amount. At least doubling the sauce is necessary. The sauce gets very thick and gets harder to spread around all the chicken pieces. Maybe next time I'll triple the sauce. And, I switched the amounts of chicken broth to marsala wine as the cook from Coloardo suggested. The amount of onion recommended in the recipe is the perfect amount. I also used skinless chicken breasts, tenderized them until 1/4 in. thick and dredged them in flour. This is absolutely necessary! I served this on a bed of fine linguini and my honey thought I could have my own restaurant!

An easy and quick recipe, but far from the best marsala dish I have had. Still searching for the perfect recipe to rival that of Carmine's in NYC! I would make again, but would season a little more. (I did double the marsala and half the broth like most of the reviews.

This recipe was great! My local Italian grocer had "flatened" veal, so I made a combiniation of chicken breast and veal (I following others' advise and used skinless chicken breast and also flatened it between saran wrap), dredging both veal & chicken in flour that I seasoned with salt & white pepper. I also took others' advise and switched to 1 Cup Marsala and 1/2 Cup low-sodium chicken broth, which gave the sauce the perfect flavor - the kind I've had in restaurants. Only problem - it only made enough sauce for 1 person - 2 at best, so I will try doubling the sauce next time. I also served this just like my favorite "Marsala" restaraunt does - with a side of fresh angel hair pasta tossed with a little olive oil & fresh parsley. I also made "Aunt Enza's Tiramisu" from this website, but we havn't tried it yet, although, if the taste of the mascarpone mixture indicates how good it's going to be (not too mention all the great ratings it's received), it will be a perfect finish to this meal!!!

Rating: 3
As written, it puzzles me that this recipe calls for leaving the skin on, and from the other reviews, it appears that most used skinless breasts as I did. The consensus on pounding and a light dredging in flour is a must --I seasoned the flour with salt, pepper and rubbed dried sage. Also used 3/4C marsala & 3/4C chicken broth, crimini mushrooms, and used sliced shallots instead of onion. As one other reviewer did, I added sun-dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts. Lovely!

Rating: 3
This recipe was very easy to follow. My husband liked it, however, I found that I did not have enough sauce to spoon over the chicken. I did make some modifications, I halved the ingredients, but still used 3/4c of Marsala. I thought the chicken would be sweeter. Maybe I will add more marsala next time. I also pounded the chicken and floured it.

Definitely do not use sweet marsala. I ended up with a syrup better suited for pancakes than chicken. Tonight I'm getting a bottle of dry and will remake the sauce to salvage this dish. Based on the reviews I'm sure everythings going to be okay!

I agree with everyone that this is a great dish. I made the changes everyone suggested (pounded and floured breasts, increased Marsala). Amazing flavor - will definitely make again!!

Rating: 3
Definitely dredge the chicken breasts in flour first - it will help to keep the chicken tender during and after browning. The first time I tried this dish, the sauce got too dry. So on the second try, I used 1 cup Marsala, and about 3/4 cup chicken broth. More importantly, instead of letting all the mushroom liquid and the marsala completely evaporate, I let about 10% of moisture remain in both of those steps. Don't worry - The chicken and the subsequent reductions can take care of excess liquid later on. Otherwise - great recipe, especially with steamed veggies and/or mashed potatoes.

My husband, who has never made anything from scratch in his life (I'm serious!), made this for me tonight for my birthday. It was fantastic! And, obviously very easy. A couple of changes that he (I) made were dusting the chicken with flour, and instead of finishing the sauce with more butter, used a slurry of corn starch and chick. broth to thicken it.

This dish is fabulous! I followed the recipe as is and was very happy with it. The mushroom sauce was delicious and my picky partner loved it as well. Next time I will follow other reviewers suggestions and pound the chicken. It was a little bulky for the delicate sauce. This recipe takes some time, but it is well worth it!

Rating: 3
I did as other reviewers suggested and pounded and lightly dregded the chicked (the floured chicken gave the sauce body, it did not thicken the sauce to a gravy). I doubled the sauce but did not switch the amt's of broth and marsala - since I only had 1/2 cup marsala I added 1/2 cup chianti and it worked well. A very quick and easy dinner with lots of flavor, will make this again with all marsala.

Rating: 4
This was soooo delicious, I followed the recipe exactly as written. However, next time I will follow the advice of the other reviewers and pound the chicken before sauteeing -- the mushrooms and onions were sliced thin and the sauce was delicate, therefore the chicken needed to be so too. As written (without pounding) the chicken seemed too "chunky and thick" for the sauce. After pounding, I might very slightly flour the chicken but I wouldn't dredge it because I wouldn't want the flour to effect the sauce. I think the thinner chicken breasts will definitely be a better balance with the overall recipe. I did follow the reviewers advice and used slightly more marsala than called for in the recipe and it seemed perfect. This is a fabulous recipe and we'll try it again very soon! (P.S. I think Boston, MA was actually reviewing "Chicken Marsala with Sage".)

Rating: 3
This dish is very good and fairly easy to make. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts which I dredged in flour first. I highly recommend this step. I omitted the onions and the dish still came out yummy. I would have liked more of a pronounced Marsala flavor so the next time I make this dish I will take the advise of others and double the Marsala and reduce the chicken broth amount. My picky boyfriend even enjoyed this recipe! I will make this dish again!

I made this for dinner and my husband LOVED it! I was surprised because I wasn't expecting much. I cut the recipe in half since I was only making for two, but wished I had kept the full recipe for the sauce since we didn't have any leftovers. As described below, I flattened the chicken and dredged in flour. I was concerned about making a pasty sauce by cooking the chicken in the sauce in the end so I just cooked sauce while I tented the cooked chicken. When finished, I spooned the sauce over the chicken breast which I set over a bed of pecorino romano mashed potatoes. Yum. We will make this again.

This is a very convenient recipe to make, as the ingredients are easily to hand. Two forks only because the sauce is not as rich as it should be in my estimation. After reading the reviews, I think more sauce is required and less onion; at least that is the direction I will go next time. We did flour the chicken, but I think pounding them flat would be more to the recipe's benefit and fit the Marsala style.

I am not much of a cook, but with this recipe you wouldnt know it. I live in Italy, this is definitely an "american" dish, but delicious.

First, I coated the chicken in flour before cooking. This adds texture, and helps thicken the sauce later. To the mushrooms, I also added some crimini and shitake, which also have more texture and an earthier flavor. Also, rather than slice them thin, I quartered them. Recommend you double the amount of Marsala (or even more) to get the flavor that you will find in most better restaurants. Finally, for those who want an even more pronounced Marsala flavor, make a separate roux, add Marsala (as much as you prefer), cook until appropriately thickened, and you have made a gravy to pour over the chicken when serving.

Fabulous dish! I also floured the chicken, although I used skinless boneless breast. As others did, I used 1 cup of Marsala and only 1/2 cup of chicken broth. I like times in my recipe. I browned each side for about 5 minutes. I sauteed the onion and mushrooms for about 6 minutes and when I added the Marsalla I waited about 5 minutes before adding the chicken broth. 15 minutes was just the right amount of time to simmer the chicken. I took out the chicken and let the sauce thicken while we ate our first course. Then, I served the whole dish ontop of some brown rice. Delicious!

I had a craving for Chicken Marsala, and this absolutely hit the spot. I made a few changes, based on some personal preferences and recommendations made by others. Namely, 1) Used skinless breast, pounded to even thickness. 2) Used quartered mushrooms (and slightly more). 3) Dredged the breast lightly in floor seasoned with salt and pepper. 4) Used some extra Marsala, for a stronger Marsala flavor. 5) Served with noodles.

This is our all-time favorite marsala recipe. Simple and delicious. We've made it for special occasions, and even as part of a New Year's Eve dinner in with close friends. Always a hit!

This was a great recipe. I used chicken thighs with the skin on and with the bone in instead of chicken breast. Also I took a previous cook's recommendation of dredging the chicken in flour before sauteeing it - that added a lot to the recipe I felt.

With those changes this was a fantastic dish and my husband really liked it.

This is an absolutely wonderful and easy dish to make. I've served it for two dinner parties, and my guests absolutely loved it! I've made two changes to the dish, however,that have made all of the difference: 1. I add 4x's the marsala to the dish (or to taste). The amount indicated, just doesn't give it a strong enough "marsala taste" to me. 2.I add considerably more mushrooms, including portabellas. 3.I actually lightly flour and fry the chicken before adding it as indicated. It gives the chicken a better texture and parts of the "fried chicken" bits separate into the marsala mixture, thickening it and giving it extra flavor. My band of culinary experts gave these enhancements a thumbs up, and created my best chicken marasala and mushroom dish to date. I also serve it "Italian style" in a giant bowl for scooping. I accompany it with green beans sauteed in butter and old-fashioned garlic mashed potatoes.

I went to an evening baby shower and this was served with the Asparagus Rosotto Rice Dish. The meal was Amazing. My friend made some subtitutions by omitting the chicken broth and using 1 and 1/2 cups burned off Marsala Wine, and breading the chicken in flour/garlic salt/pepper before browning. Also add 1 clove crushed garlic and 1 Tblsp tomato paste or ketchup. To make meat more tender and have the kitchen cleaned up before dinner guests arrive place the entire dish in the crock pot for a few hours on low, and the meat falls apart in your mouth. Try it w/ the rice too. Enjoy!!!

I tried this recipe and thought it was tasty and very traditional for a Marsala sauce. A recipe that I've used time and again in the past is very similar and I like better. It includes a slice of mozarella placed on each breast once flipped in browning process and spinkled with fresh parsley and a few capers. When making the sauce at the end, a 1/4 heavy cream goes in with the other ingredients. These additions do add calories, but the end result is wonderful!

I did it with thighs (that was what was on hand, plus I like dark meat) rather than breasts and it was really good. The sauce matched any Marsala I have had in a restaurant, at least to my own biased taste. Plus it's easy and fun.

Talk about gourmet for the middle of the week(and it's tomorrow's lunch,too!!). Simple and the sauce is delicious. This will definitely be in the permanent file.

This was a simple and tasty dish. I served it with Risotto con Funghi Porcini and a nice chianti. I would make it again, perhaps with emphasis on trying to enrichen the sauce by experimenting with the wine.

I've tried this recipe many times. It's my specialty. I experimented a little bit the other day with veal. I cut the cutlets into small (about 4" pieces) and marinated them with salt, peper and the onion used for the recipe. Two hours prior to cooking time I laid a bed of onion on a big plate and placed the veal. Then salted and peppered both sides. Then covered the veal with the remaining onion and covered the plate with aluminium foil and put it in the fridge. The veal came out delicious.

Excellent! As a scientist (and family cook)I follow the principle of Occam's Razor - What is simplest is best! By the way, taste being highly subjective; this recipe does indeed taste much the same as the "restaurant version" - better in fact because I know who made it, ME!

I had to laugh after reading some of the reviews from people who had changed the recipe, and complained it didn't taste right.What did you expect? I totally agree with the cook from Seattle. This is great and very easy. Give it a try.

I don't have to make this recipe to know that if the reviewers change the recipe and then find it is not what they expected, then maybe they should make it as written. You can not "cut things up to cook faster" or "add peppers" and then say, "gee, this didn't taste like it should!". Try learning the techniques and reading about the dish you are making before you add your own 'touches' and you will find that you will have results like the pros. Oh, and yes, don't expect those results until you practice, how many times do you think the chef in your favorite restaurant has made that dish that you expect to alter it and make just as well?

Pretty good, but not like my favorite restaurant. It was easy and quick. I cut up the chicken to cook faster, and served over fettucine with fresh steamed broccoli. Yum!

My husband & I love this recipe! We sliced the chicken up into smaller pieces & let simmer along with the mushroom & onion mixture. We also used a little over 1/2 of the onion & substituted 1/2 a shallot for the rest of the onion. It was wonderful! Served on a bed of angel hair pasta.

This was a very easy, yummy recipe. I didn't think this took very long at all! I used chicken breasts, pounded. I also added red and green pepper. However, I didn't think this tasted like chicken marsala that you can get at an Italian restaurant. I have made a recipe similar to this from Cooking Light and I thought the Cooking Light one tasted as good, with a lot less fat.

This recipe was excellent!! It is a little time consuming, but if you have the time, go for it. You don't need an extravagant kitchen to achieve the results. I made orzo pilaf as an accompanyment. My family asked for me to make it again.

This recipe is easy and so delicious! I served it for a dinner party and everyone - even my children - loved it. Like some other reviewers, I increased the amount of marsala and made more sauce. I served it with buttered angel hair and it was definitely a hit!

I followed the recommendation to chunk the chicken - carful you don't cook it to long. I also added garlic to the mushroom and onion saute. Make more sauce - it's good over pasta.

This recipe is really excellent! I increased the amount of Marsala to 1-1/4 cups; this provided more of the delicious sauce after reduction . I also cut the breasts into large chunks rather than cooking them intact so the cooking time was reduced and there was more Marsala flavor in the chicken. Try serving this over linguini with grilled fresh vegetables.

I have made it several times and I change the following: -bread then pan fry the chicken first then continue with the recipie -make twice the amount of sauce

I am trying to find the "perfect" Chicken Marsala and this isn't it. Last week I tried a recipie in Silver Palate which was much better - richer and more "Marsala-y". That being said, the addition of onions and garlic was a good improvement.

Did not add onions, but sauteed the chicken in garlic. Added 1-1/2 cups Marsala instead of the broth; used portabella mushrooms. Delicious! thanks to all the other reviewers for their suggestions.

I am an amateur in the kitchen, yet I got raves for this one. Easy to understand and simple to prepare, this dish will become a staple at my house. Perhaps this woman, who opens as my husband calls it, a mean box--meaning prepared foods--can become a good cook too!

I tried making the Cooks Illustrated version of this dish and it turned out terrible! The alcoholic taste still was present, even after I had boiled the sauce for five minutes. The taste was too overpowering. Perhaps the omission of the pancetta was the culprit? Definitely would want a marsala without the strong alcoholic taste.

Rating: 0
To "A Cook" thanks for the correction on the lemon juice amount. I have updated the info and offer the following recipe for my fellow Epicurious users. This recipe is from the May/June 2000 Cooks Illustrated magazine: Differences between the Gourmet and Cooks Illustrated recipes are as follows: 1) dredge chicken breasts in flour; 2) saute 3 slices of finely diced pancetta with the mushrooms; 3) omit onion; 4) omit chicken broth and increase Marsala (SWEET, please) to 1 1/2 cups; 5) add one minced garlic clove; 6) add 1 teaspoon tomato paste to sauce; and 7) add 1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice to sauce. Another note is to boil marsala until it's reduced to about 1 1/4 cups, about 5 minutes, which will take off the alcoholic edge. Otherwise, the techniques for the Gourmet recipe are the same for the Cooks Illustrated, including adding butter at the end (which you health-conscious people can omit and it will still be delish). The flavor in the Cooks Illustrated recipe is better because by omitting the chicken broth and adding the garlic clove, tomato paste and lemon juice let the marsala flavor shine through while also making for a more flavorful sauce. Try the above changes and you'll have the best tasting Chicken Marsala ever. The sauce is so yummy that I love just sopping it up with plain white rice. One note for the above recipe: I have made this substituting ketchup for the tomato paste -- who wants to open a can for 1 teaspoon?! This recipe is truly delicious; try it and see!

I have made both this and the "Cooks Illustrated" version, and prefer theirs. The depth of flavor is better. Also, the cook from San Francisco that supplied that fine recipe called for 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice. The origional recipe calls for 1 1/2 TBLS.

Great dish!!! I would next time though use a better Marsala wine as I used one bought in the super market and maybe add also a little dry sherry.

My family and I liked this recipe very much. I used boneless thighs instead of breasts. I used Madeira instead of Marsala. I didn't cook it as long as stated. I didn't add the 2 tablespoons of butter at the end but I did throw in some chopped tomato...hmmm maybe I just invented a different dish! Served it over buttered noodles and it was a hit!

many people have asked me for this recipe. the children have never liked mushrooms until now. i make this dish almost weekly. awesome dish

I tried the Cook's Illustrated recipe as well and it was outstanding. I cannot stress enough that you should NOT reduce the Marsala Wine too much otherwise the sauce comes out too sweet for my tastes. Like it was stated in the previous review, five minutes is all you need. I am curious if anyone has tried the recipe with a Dry Marsala Wine. Also, make especially sure the pan is very hot prior to cooking the chicken. Three minutes on each side is all you need.

I have used both types of Marsala wine and prefer the SWEET variety. My favorite mushroom is the Portabella. It gives a hearty quality to this elegant Italian dish.

this was agreat recepie I did add a little bit more of marsala to the recepie since the onions took over too much. My entire family loved it so much. I did it twice already and the second time i added a can of golden mushroom in addition to some "real" mushrooms and it was awsome..

This is like most marsala recipes but the mushrooms really make it special. If you pound the chicken, don't cook it as long as the recipe calls for. If using rice or pasta, the liquid reduction times should be shortened.

I also modified the recipe by using boneless, skinless chicken breasts (and sweet Marsala wine is a MUST). However, I pounded the chicken thin between wax paper sheets, and dredged in flour. I also used additional mushrooms, but kept the suggested amount of onion, chopped VERY fine (delicious!). Adding a little more sweet Marsala wine at the end, with a touch of corn starch made this recipe simply DIVINE!! I am the envy of my entire Italian-born family!!

I followed Scottq's suggestion and used sweet marsala wine. I modified the recipe somewhat: used skinless chicken breast, 1/2 an onion, and served it over bowtie pasta. I wanted a thicker sauce to spoon over the chicken and pasta so instead of reducing the sauce at the end, I removed 1 Tbsp of the sauce while chicken finished cooking; cooled the sauce; added 1 1/2 Tbsp marsala and 1 1/2 tsp cornstarch. When the chicken finished cooking, I removed it from the pan and stirred in the marsala/cornstarch mixture to thicken the sauce. I will definitely make this again! The flavor was outstanding.

First of all, I always lightly bread chicken for dishes like this. It turned out great. Even reheated for lunch the next day! Second, a WHOLE onion? Please! It took away from the taste of the marsala. I would use 1/2 next time and more mushrooms. Lastly, I didn't cook the sauce as far down as they recommend. I served the chicken over rice, so you need sauce! Overall a good recipe, though!

It wasn't at all what I expected - recipe is way too heavy on the broth - you couldn't take the Marsala.

I have made this recipe with both sweet and dry Marsala, and recommend making it with the sweet. A little splash of Marsala as the dish finishes helps the taste a bit also. Very good over a quality pasta, but some may want to thicken the sauce a bit.

This was a wonderful dish! I did use only half amount of the marsala and had pork chops on hand, so I used that instead. I lightly marinated the pork chops with a little ginger, garlic, soy sauce, and corn starch. My husband raved about it. I'll definitely make it again.

My family loves this!! I make it at least twice a month. The time it takes is worth it. Maybe the folks who gave it lackluster reviews are not using real butter - margarine just doesn't cut it in this receipe.

I have been making this for years, my husband asks for it more often than almost anything else. I often serve it with wide egg noodles, and if I'm lucky enough to have chantarelle mushrooms, I use those. But it's also perfect as is -- simple and delicious.

Very tempted to give a 4 to balance out the undeserved low scores. The marsala sauce was absolutely the high point. I wouldn't even think about tampering with it (like the other reviews). The chicken was surprisingly juicy & tender. Go ahead, see it for yourself. We're finicky and we were happy that we chose not to dine out tonight.

This recipe turned out lackluster. I was searching for a cclassic chicken marsala and settled for this one. Hopefully the real mcCoy is out there somewhere. Endned up adding mushroom soup to this one in the hopes of making a REAL sauce.

Needs a little more substance and color. Maybe and idea of what or how to serve it with and I would go with a red onion as to not take away from the sweetness of the marsla, as well as a yellow pepper, since they seem to be the least potent in the pepper family.
