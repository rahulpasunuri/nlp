Tasty! I didn't quite get 3 inch rounds, more like 2.25 inch, so they were a bit thicker. Couldn't curl them, but no loss. Gone in 24 hours. I baked on a silpat and that worked well. Definetly will make again, easy too!

So easy, so yummy! Very nice for company. Make them ahead, they wilted in the humidity after a day, even in an airtight container, but were fine making them that afternoon to serve in the late evening. Great compliment to other more complex desserts, buttery and cripsy!!!

These have a lovely taste. Don't forget (as I did in making my first batch) to pat these down with a fork -- otherwise you will end up with macaroons.
