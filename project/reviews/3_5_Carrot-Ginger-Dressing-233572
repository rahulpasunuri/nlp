oh my god it only took me 15 years but i finally found the recipe that tastes just like DOJO's carrot ginger dressing! i did not modify anything except i used my blender for the whole process instead of using a food processor & switching to a blender. this recipe is simple & amazing! i am buying mason jars today to make them for my friends who miss DOJO's. seriously people make this & eat it up! YUM!

Super yummy. Went heavy on carrots as I had a bunch. Used with sautéed bok choy/garlic/cayenne and tofu. Pretty too

I thought it was killer, but needed a touch of sweetness to round it out. Used a Tbsp of honey. Perfect!

Such an easy dressing to make!! I would have never imagined.. now I know what this dressing is made of. So easy to mix with every type of greens! and so healthy!!

This is almost perfect! I personally like more soy sauce. I added about 1/4 cup, and also increased the rice vinegar to 1/4 cup. Added a dash of sriracha sauce (hot chili sauce -- any hot sauce will substitute). I didn't have any sesame oil, so I substituted about 2T of roasted sesame seeds. That worked fine but I think the dark sesame oil would be better. Also, for expediency, I put all ingredients minus the water into the food processor and blended it up. I like it a bit course, like in a Japanese restaurant. No water was needed for me. Excellent! Thank you!!

This is the closest I've found to the dressing used by NYC's Dojo Restaurant in the late 80's and 90's! The recipe is fabulous without any changes. Serve it Dojo Style over brown rice and a mix of steamed broccoli, carrots, and bean sprouts. Now, to find the recipe for Dojo's tofu burger that was the crown jewel of that amazing dish...

Delicious! I used 2T chopped onions and 1 T chopped garlic in place of the shallots. Put it on a salad of mixed red and green lettuce, cucumbers, and avocado. It was such a hit that people had more salad after the main course.

I made this dressing but instead of using shallots, I used a 1/4 of a sweet onion. I also added 2 tb spoons of honey. Using 3 "medium" size carrots could be misleading as it depends upon the meaning of medium. I suggest using a cup and a half instead or just size the amount based upon taste. It worked out ok, but mine does not necessarily tastes like in Japanese restaurants.

Oh yuck. All I taste are bitter shallots. I had to dump in soy sauce and ketchup to get any flavor. I'm not a harsh critic on Epicurious, either. There are better recipes out there for this dressing.

Delicious. I did not make any changes to the recipe and brought it to a party with baby greens. This dressing was a hit.

It was the most disgusting thing I have ever tasted. SIKE!

Great base but definitely not satisfying without something else, even with the suggested ketchup. We went with Indian spices, Garam Masala and some cumin. Really great!

Great dressing! Using another reviewer's suggestions, I added 1 Tbsp ketchup and an extra 1/4 Tbsp of soy sauce. It had just the right thickness and taste to dress a simple salad. My guests really enjoyed it.

Fresh, quality ingredients are key in this recipe! It's almost identical to the ginger sesame dressing at all of our favorite Japanese restaurants. We love it over fresh baby greens!

Great base. I agree that some ketchup (no mayo, though!) is a good idea, as well as a seeded chopped tomato (which allows emulsification with less oil) and maybe some brown sugar if you like it sweeter (about 1.5 tbsp was great). This was great on a basic garden salad, also on steamed veggies, and on a cucumber/carrot salad.

Very good dressing. You can drastically reduce the amount of veg. oil for a lower fat dressing though it will not emulsify as well.

just so-so, it seemed too watered down for me, it was just missing something...

This is similar to a dressing I have been making for years that we really enjoy. We did not like this one as much. Increasing the soy sauce to 1/4 and adding 1TBSP. of ketchup makes the dressing base exactly the recipe we prefer and closer to those served in Japanese restaurants. That said, I like the chopped carrots and shallots in this one that mine does not call for. I think I will continue to add them. An added bonus is that this dressing has around 25 calories per tablespoon--served on cole slaw mix as a salad, it is very healthy and diet-friendly.

Uh oh! Fat fingers this morning....I hope this doesn't post twice. In the middle of typing a 'review' when the wndow shut down.... Anyhow, as I was saying: Have yet to prepare this, but anything with ginger and sesame is bound to be a winner. Question, though: On what would you serve this? Greens? Something with shrimp? Looking for suggestions, please...

This sounds almost exactly the same as the recipe that I use, which is also amazing (only it makes a lot less), except that it include mayonnaise. For those that like a creamier dressing, a dollop of mayonnaise gives this recipe a little substance. Just an idea!

Great and easy. Tastes a lot like the dressings at Japanese restaurants.

I love this dressing. It tastes like dressing that you would find in your favorite sushi restaurant! I added a little more rice wine vinegar, but I like more vinegar, generally speaking.
