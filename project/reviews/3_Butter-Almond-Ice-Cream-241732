Agree with the first reviewer - the consistency is elegant and creamy, in some ways like a gelato. Might add some vanilla extract the next time for an extra depth of flavor.

This recipe makes a perfectly delicious ice cream. Made exactly as directed, the ice cream had a similar consistency and flavor to Haagen Daas. Not super exciting, so I'm not sure if we'd make it again, but really, what's not to like?
