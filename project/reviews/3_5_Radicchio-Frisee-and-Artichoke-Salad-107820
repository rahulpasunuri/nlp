I was not impressed. Though the raw artichokes were VERY interesting, the frisee and radicchio were overpoweringly bitter with such a light dressing. I added Sherry vinegar and lemon to help balance it out but still not a show stopper for the amount of work involved.

Wow! This is my new favorite salad. I served it at a dinner party last night and everyone raved. I made it ahead so I mixed the dressing a few hours before serving and let the artichokes float in the lemon water for a few hours, too. I choose artichokes that were about fist-sized because they are more tender and flavorful. I also used champagne vinegar, but I don't think it was a "make or break it" substitution. Most of the people at the party said they aren't radicchio or frisée fans, but they loved the freshness and mild sweetness of it. Not bitter at all!
