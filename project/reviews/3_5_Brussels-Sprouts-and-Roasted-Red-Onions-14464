Great recipe, easy to make, and very rich tasting. Warning: it's not beautiful. The roasted red onions take on an eerie hue and might cause alarm to some diners, but a gathering of six or more will devour it in short order.

Very, very good recipe. Didn't change a thing and it tasted just grand. The color combination is really lovely. Make sure to cook the sprouts just a bit. The smaller the sprouts, the better!

Like the flavors of the recipe but the texture was a bit monotonous; would add something like pine nuts, pecans or walnuts next time to enhance the textural qualities.

I have made this dish several times, and will be using it again this weekend for a dinner party. It's a perfect recipe for a party because you can make everything in advance and just warm it with the sauce before serving. I know I'll have another group of fans of this dish after this weekend!

Wonderful. Very good for children, BRUSSELS SPROUTS without bitter taste.

Easy and spectacular dish for Thanksgiving ... makes a great presentation. I made it a few weeks ahead, slightly undercooked it, then froze it in an oven-safe bowl ... Took it out in the a.m. and easily had it ready for dinner. And it's true ... even people who don't like brussels sprouts will like this!

Great recipie! The flavours play nicely between the roasted onions ( don't forego! ), sprouts, and o-my-goodness the mustard is the surprise star, raising this medley from good to great! I mixed 1 T pommery mustard with 1 t mustard powder and just enough water to keep it moving... Yum !

I would make this again minus the roasted red onions. I only used one large onion and that was plenty - nine must be a mistake. Too much bother roasting etc. Instead I will sautee chopped shallots in the butter then add the cooked sprouts and then the mustard mixture. You can use different flavored/textured mustards which would give a nice variation of taste.

If you like brussel sprouts, you will love this recipe. I made for Thanksgiving and can't wait to make it again.The roasted onions add a tasty sweet and savory touch. Don't be put off by the amount of onions as they cook down by quite abit.

Great sidedish! I served it at Thanksgiving and received rave notices. The only change I might make in the future it to either decrease the amount of onion or increase the amount of sprouts.

This dish is a complete hit in my home. The bitterness you sometimes encounter with Brussels sprouts is sweetened up by the carmelization of the onions. Delicious!!

This is better than the same old boring way I usually make brussell sprouts. I omitted the mustard sauce because I think that the carmelized onions and sprouts have enough flavor to stand on their own.

I changed the recipe slightly to include crisped bacon added at the end of sauteeing. I would use less onion than recommended and chop it up before adding to the sprouts. I also recommend cooking the sprouts a little longer, they were quite crisp still. It was a great side dish!
