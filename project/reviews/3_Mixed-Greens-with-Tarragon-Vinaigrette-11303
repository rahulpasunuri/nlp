Going to use the leftovers as a marinade for grilled chicken breasts. The raw shallot overpowered the tarragon for a salad dressing. I am going to substitute chives for a shallot next time. Used extra tarragon because I did not have tarragon white wine vinegar. Having fun cooking at Tideaway, a vacation rental in Fort Bragg, California.

Very simple salad and the dressing is GREAT!

Excellent and easy. A very simple light dressing. I made once with butter lettuce, it was perfect. Made again with spring mix, but it did not hold up against the strong taste of the spring mix.
