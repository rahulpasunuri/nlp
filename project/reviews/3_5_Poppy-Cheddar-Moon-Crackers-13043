Thanks to a previous cook, I used the food processor - perfect. We liked the crackers better when they were made without poppy seeds. Also, check the crackers after 10 minutes - ours were done in less than 12 minutes.

Very good! My husband couldn't believe I made them at home! Oh, I forgot to sprinkle salt on top, and don't think it's needed.

I made these as an afternoon nibbler for our dinner group guests and everyone loved them. I doubled the recipe and used a small biscuit cutter to make circle shapes. These are simple to make. I always think it's important to freshly grate the cheese and not purchase pregrated, but maybe that's just my thing. I'll make these often.

Relatively straight foward. Recommend leaving salt off of the top. I used different Halloween shapes and it was a hit. Use a fine ground cornmeal and make sure they are all rolled out the same thickness. Excellent.

Simple, fast and yummy! An addition of cayanne is a must. I skipped the egg wash - not necessary.

I was looking for a Cheezit style cracker and this is it! They bake up a little thicker than the store brand, and not as crisp, but the flavor is amazing! Plus you don't have to worry about how many chemicals are in it. I didn't add the poppy seeds, instead seasoning it with a tablespoon of jalapeno Tabasco. I highly recommend this recipe.

This really rates 3 1/2 forks. Delicious, easy to roll out, and awfully cute for Halloween.

Very easy to put together. Rave reviews at my open house. I cut them into tiny christmas tree shapes.

Very good & Very Easy!!! Next time I will add some cayanne or garlic to these, just because I love garlic, but they are nice just the way they are. I served the with a gourmet cheese platter and they were perfect because they were a great cracker, but the flavor does not overpower any of the cheeses, even the delicate flavored ones. I do not have a moon shaped cutter so I used a Triangle,worked fine, and probably easier to serve with cheese & meats.

these were a lovely treat, and, as another reviewer stated, it is fun to surprise everyone when they ask for the brand name. however, i would not make these again. although fairly tasty, they are nothing to write home about. i generally prefer to make something complex and extraordinary, but that is just me!

I really enjoyed making these crackers. The dough was very easy to work with. They are very tasty, however, I would add a little cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp. garlic powder/salt. Both times I have made these I have gotten rave reviews. It's so much fun to surprise people when they ask where I bought the crackers at!!

I've made this recipe three times. Doubled it the third time. Super addictive crackers! Easiest using a food processor.

Great! Make sure to roll very thin and not underbake. A really tasty variation is with sesame seeds and parmesan--reduce bake time to 8-10 minutes.

After you taste these, you will NEVER eat a store-bought cracker again!! Like the other reviewer, I didn't get 75 crackers out of the recipe. I think it was between 50 and 60.

I brought these crackers to supper club as an appetizer a couple of years ago and they were a hit. Now my friends always request that I make them a batch! I do not get 75 crackers out of this recipe-guess I'm not rolling the dough thin enough. (But great nonetheless!)
