Added potatoes and carrots to the parsnips for Christmas Eve Dinner and It. Was. Wonderful.

This dish is wonderful on many levels. It's absolutely delicious and it's very simple to prepare. Even though it's roasted, it almost seems like parsnip fries. We love parsnips, but even people who think they don't like them will like this dish. It was perfect as is, but next time I might try it with rosemary instead of thyme, just to see the difference.

Once again to the parsnips! A lovely side dish. I haven't made it in 4 or 5 years, but two of my guests are vegetarians so these'll go quickly. Since one of the two is a Vegan, I'll substitute a margarine concoction or olive oil for the butter.

Too easy and so incredibly delicious. I am not a huge parsnip fan but I ate all available. Like many others, I kept them in the oven longer than suggested, and they were even more thoroughly carmelised on the outside and fluffy on the inside and were delicious.

Simple and delicious. I also added butternut squash, red onion, sweet potato and some cloves of garlic. Fresh thyme and rosemary were key IMO. Cooked 2 hours at 325 with my turkey & they came out nice and caramelized.

Made this today for T-giving side dish--everyone liked it, no one (including me) had ever had parsnips before. Glad we gave them a try! I followed the recipe exactly, and I must say that the most time consuming thing was trying to get them cut up to matching size. I used a 9 x 13 pan, and I cannot imagine that you could use anything smaller and fit all in one layer. Took 40 mn to roast, not 30, and I did not cut large. I gave only 3 forks because it was good, but not so outstanding that I couldn't stop eating it or anything :)

This was also my first time trying parsnips. They were delicious! I really appreciated the sweet caramel flavor that came from the brown sugar. It went really well with the duck I served for thanksgiving.

This was my first time roasting parsnips, and they turned out very good. I used dried thyme instead of fresh, cut the parsnips in pencil-sized pieces, and baked at 375F for an hour, alongside a 3- pound free range chicken. I served it with salad, and the sweetness of the parsnips complimented really well the chicken, and the balsamic in the salad dressing.

Loved it! Added garnet yams with the parsnips and a pinch of nutmeg for a little spice. My husband loved it.

Nice combination of flavors earned a thumbs up from my foodie husband! Did have to roast the parsnips about 15 minutes longer than the recipe called for, though. Maybe my parsnips were too big.

I will be making this dish again! I followed the recipe to a tee. I made it when my sister came over for dinner, and she hates parsnips and gobbled this up. It is just a side dish so it isn't spectacular, but still a great recipe. As other reviews said, it would be suitable for holiday get togethers.

Another parsnip dish my family gobbles up. I loved seeing the message from the reviewer whose kids eat parsnips and brussels sprouts...definately doing something right!

Love this recipe. Works well with sweet potatos too.

At the suggestion of another reviewer, I added a few carrots for additional color. Spectacular fall side dish! Perfect for entertaining, as the vegetables can be prepped ahead of time and the last minute work is quick and easy. Very impressive in both appearance and flavor; will definitely make again!

Really good. I will make these again. Sweet and spicey and nutty.

Simple delicious dish! Mine cooked perfectly in the stated time. I made sure they were all about the diameter of a pencil - or maybe a little bigger. Might add more thyme next thyme (hehe) but definitely making this again and again.

This was tasty but took about an hour for the parsnips to cook. I'd test this out before making for company.

This recipe is easy to make and delicious! It was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. I am making it again for Christmas.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner yesterday and everyone loved it. I was asked for the recipe by several people. I did add carrots for color and do believe it enhanched the dish. Try it!!

Absolutely beautiful and delish. We had it for Thanksgiving and it was a nice compliment to the traditional side dishes. I'll be making this at home with some carrots thrown in, and a little less thyme.

Loved it. Cooking time was too long though or maybe my parsnips were small. Great way to make a difference with a vegetable.

This dish was wonderful! I always thought parsnips would be awful, but now that I have tried them, they will be a staple for us. I added carrots as I only bought three parsnips. As much as I like the flavor of thyme, the next time I make these I will cut back on it as it seemed to overpower the taste of the vegetables. Ironically, I own the cookbook this recipe came from, but never thought to check there!

This was great at Thanksgiving dinner -- the right flavor; the right complement to heavy turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes; and also looked attractive and appealing. (Fresh thyme improved flavor, appearance.) Tasted great, easy preparation. The only problem is the reaction of others when you say "parsnip." This vegetable needs a new name. Earth oyster? Poor man's truffle? Whiteroot?

I'm just midway through making this - did some advance prep for Thanksgiving. Anyway, we'll see how the final thing turns out, but FYI the sauce is utterly gorgeous... just butter, balsamic vinegar and dark brown sugar. I promptly made another batch that I'll either use to overglaze the parsnips during cooking or I may baste the goose I'm cooking with it (just brush the outside skin) toward the end of the cooking time. I had no idea these flavors would meld so well. It's a spoon-licker for certain.

nothing heralds spring in vermont like fresh maple syrup and freshly dug parsnips! (we've even had Easter dinner in the sugarhouse at times!) I LOVE this recipe -- i'm not totally crazy about thyme, so i used a little less. can't think of any possible way to improve this recipe, but if i were looking for ways to ruin it, i'd add that parmesan, Pittsburgh!

Got rave reviews for this dish from people who had never eaten parsnips. Cooked it with a crown roast and apple stuffing, so at 325 degrees for about two hours. I also added some carrots for color. The parsnips were soft on the inside and a bit crispy on the outside. The nutty flavor was a nice complement to the pork.

I thought this was so-so, but everybody else gobbled them up, so maybe it was my own peculiar taste buds. It was extremely easy to prepare.

I didn't know how yummy parsnips were till I tried this recipe! I have some modifications too (always do): add a few sweet potatoes or yams and use red wine vinegar instead of balsamic.

We love this recipie. I often add squash, sweet potatoes or carrrots with the parsnips. Also, it is very good with already roasted beets addded at the end - so you don't turn everything purple.

This recipe was very easy and moderately good not great. I added some freshly grated parmesean cheese at the very end which helped a little.

In roasting parsnip I have found that pre cooking them in boiling water makes for a much more tender finished product, they are one of my children's favorite vegetable, right behind brussel sprouts.
