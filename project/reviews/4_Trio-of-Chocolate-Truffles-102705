This is very easy to make except I might have chilled mine too long in the freezer - didn't roll very well in the nuts and coconut. I just used cocoa powder and confectionary sugar and a few w/ nuts. I also added some Bailey's for a little kick.

Great truffles. Definitely messy to roll. I left mine in the refrigerator too long and didn't have the time to allow the mixture to soften up pre-rolling, so it was tough to get them covered in coating. Great taste though.

I've never made truffles before and I found this recipe fairly easy to follow. I used a combination of Valrhona and Scharffenberger bittersweet & semisweet bars, which I chopped with a knife before adding to the hot cream. I was in a hurry, so I put it in the freezer to cool rather than in the refrigerator. I ended up almost completely freezing them, which made them a little hard to shape, but with a melon baller it would have been pretty easy. Incidentally, I made them for a party, and learned that one of my guests makes truffles professionally - and she said she freezes the ganache, so maybe that's not a bad way to do it. Mine did hold up very well - they sat out for a few hours and did not get that soft. I covered them in cocoa, chopped almonds and coconut, and I don't think they needed anything else. I recommend splurging and using the best chocolate you can afford - I think it is the quality of the chocolate that really makes the difference in the results.

Awesome Awesome Awesome. Although some people arent a fan of the bitter cocoa, I love the mixture of the bitter and the sweet. If you are making these for other people; make these with just enough time to spare before any party otherwise you will end up eating eveything before you get there. AND - put them in the trunk so you don't chow them down while you drive.

Fantastic! Fabulous! So easy to make. I'm going to start varying it up by adding liqueurs, peanut butter, etc. These were such a big hit. I couldn't believe I was shelling out so much money to buy them at Godiva's. I used light cream instead and I can't tell a difference. I also displayed them on tiny cupcake liners. Very pretty. Absolutely a winner.

I remember complaining about shaping the chocolate before, but I made this recipe again for Xmas and Holy Delicious, Batman! So good! I did use Callebaut, and I chilled over night, so maybe it was just easier AND better this time. No problems with anything being too soft. So, so, so very delicious.

Delicious! Only issue for me was I only got 2 dozen truffles, a bit short of the expected 30. Only dipped them in the cocoa and coconut and they were a huge hit. Served them as part of a sweets platter at a holiday open house along with chocolate covered strawberries, chocolate dipped pretzels and rum balls.

This recipe is simple and I find the process of shaping truffles into round balls very meditative. These rich, sweet treats got rave reviews at a party last summer, and now I am making them for Holiday gifts. Delicious!

These were really easy to make. It's true, as mentioned by others, that they can't stay out for more than a few minutes before they start getting soft. However, I tried the suggestion to dip the truffles in dark chocolate. The result was great, chocolate that was able to be handled on the outside, and they melting, delicious inside.

This is so easy and so delicious. Like other reviewers, I experimented with flavorings, making a peanut butter version, an expresso version, a rum version and an orange/sambuca version. Oh my God. Totally decadent. The only mess-up was when I attempted to make white chocolate truffles. I should have known. The white chocolate never set up in the fridge or freezer so I was not able to make balls out of it. These make great holiday gifts as long as they are kept refrigerated or at least cool.

This recipe is a no-fail christmas gift every year. The original issue is still sitting dog eared in my bookcase. My Mother has come to expect them year after year and she absolutely loves them (and she knows her chocolate!!). I do change the flavorings depending on my mood, but they come out delicious every time. Enjoy!

To make the dipping a piece of cake...sorry for the pun.....Wilton makes candy dipping spoons and forks. Very inexpensive and very easy. I found them at my craft store.

What a waste of time. Took several hours and all I ended up with was gooey little balls of what tasted like rich cake frosting. Came out globby even after six hours in the freezer. Wound up throwing the whole mess out.

Amazing.....I used Hershey's chocolate chip cookies and rolled some in cocoa and others in pistachos. They taste divine. I will definitely try more variations next time...orange essence, peppermint essence and maybe stuff each truffle with an almond or hazelnut.

This recipe is too easy to be so decadent. It is wonderful every time and I have made it many, many times. In fact, it is now a traditional Christmas gift for friends. They love it and talk about them all year.

This was a great recipe for ease and great results. I noted other reviewer's concerns re: adding extra liquid. I boiled the cream with a split vanilla bean instead of using vanilla essence. I might add however, that when I added (quite a bit of) liqueur, I found the end product to be very forgiving, so I definitely won't be worrying myself unecessarily with that issue next time (and there will be a next time!!). I thought the plain chocolate ones were just that - a little plain. I highly recommend them with kahlua, then rolled in crushed toasted almonds. I made some with orange liqueur and toasted coconut, but it needed some peel added to adequately bring out the orange flavour.

These are a wonderful end to a dinner party. I served with fresh strawberries and the champagne raspberry cocktail (with chambord) from this site also. A truly perfect combination! I used callebaut semisweet chunks and added a little espresso powder and kahlua. Then rolled some in cocoa and some in raw sugar. The latter were the best and most popular. These will be a favorite of mine and so easy. (I too used a melon scoop to form the balls...easy).

This recipe is indeed a keeper. I made these for a party using Grand Marnier, adding a bit more chocolate to make up for the two tablespoons of liquid. I also added a quarter teaspoon of finely ground cayenne pepper, to give them a kicky aftertaste. They went FAST. Using the chocolate chips for the ganache really cut down on the prep. It did set up a bit on the loose side, and the bath in warm dipping chocolate made the truffles stick to the dipping fork, so I ended up hand coating them in chocolate that had been tempered and allowed to cool a little. (Just put a little puddle of tempered chocolate in your palm, and roll the truffle around in it). I gave them two thin coats, and they held up in a pretty warm room without going all mushy. (but they did go quick!)

The reviews speak for themselves. The beauty is that you can add whatever flavor suits your taste and they do make great Christmas gifts. As for ease and taste, this is a good recipe. They do stick a bit when rolling but it wasn't a problem for me. Just make sure they're chilled long enough.

Thanks to the reviewer who suggested dipping in chocolate to help with the softness of the truffle. These were delicious - though I had to keep them all for myself because I had such a hard time dipping frozen chocolate into melted white chocolate and they were a mess. I'll try again, though; I've since read more about doing this (have to make sure the melted chocolate is hot enough but not too hot, and use a fork to dip it in and bring it back out, letting chocolate drip off the fork tines). I split the mixture into 3 parts after adding 1/2 the vanilla, then used peppermint extract for one, dipped in white chocolate; cointreau and orange zest, rolled in toasted hazelnuts, and the third was the original, more vanilla rolled in cocoa. Made sure the total liquid added was equal to the original amount of vanilla called for in the recipe. Oh, also tried some of the peppermint ones rolled in crushed candy canes, and the candy became sticky - didn't like these. Definitely would do again and try dipping in different types of chocolate.

Just made this for the first time and the result is wonderful! I used a small melon-baller to scoop the mixture after chilling it in a bowl. It made nice, round, consistently shaped truffles, and I only had to use my thumb & forefinger to help shape the chocolate. This would be very messy if done just by hand. I split the recipe into 2 batches - in one I added Cointreau, the other Chambord - yummy!

This is such a simple recipe with an impressive result. I served these recently after a dinner party and everyone who loved chocolate raved about them. I'm going to make more for Christmas and will try rolling them in hazelnuts. I didn't have pistachios, so I substituted walnuts and pecans along with the cocoa and coconut, delish!

I make these every year for Christmas to give as gifts. I don't change a thing in the recipe. They always get rave reviews. This year I added some Frangelico to the mixture. We'll see how they turn out . . .

This is an excellent base recipe for truffles! You can flavor them and/or roll them in anything!! I used white chocolate then divided the mix in to thirds. One third I flavored with vanilla extract and covered in white chocolate. One third I flavored with peppermint extract and rolled in crushed candy canes. The last third I flavored with almond extract and rolled in toasted coconut. Delish!! Although this recipe only calls for one 12 oz. bag of chips, I found that I needed almost 2 bags to get the desired consistency, which should be like pudding while it's heated. I made it initially with just the one bag and even after freezing it was still runny. I plan to make chocolate ones next, maybe some with Chambord (raspberry liquor).

I must be doing something wrong because (and they tasted delicious anyway) I did not find these so easy to make -- huge mess to roll them in your hands and then try to roll them in the toppings. Must have parchment paper or they stick terribly. What am I doing wrong? Also not nearly as pretty as the picture, but who says truffles have to be round? Other than that..yum.

Made it this weekend, making more tonight! Super easy starting place... I cooked espresso beans in the cream and used kaluah rather than vanilla... will try raspberry espresso and candy cane coated tonight! Great for gifts!

This dish was delicious and easy to make. If made for a dinner party, make before the main dish, so you can allow it to chill. Delicious! Use a high quality chocolate for the best tasting truffles. Can't give this one enough praise.

I used this recipe as the basis for a taste I've been trying to capture. I added 1 finely diced green chilli with the vanilla. The result was a rich dark chocolate taste which was replaced by a sweet (gentle) heat as the chocolate taste faded. Easy and exactly what I was going for!

This is an easy recipe which makes for really good truffles. I dipped about half of them in chocolate to make a crunchy coat. 1 cup chocolate chips and 1 tablespoon shortening, heated in the microwave. Then I just plopped the truffle in the melted chocolate, covered it and put it on wax paper to harden in the freezer. I rolled the others in coconut, very good!

I made these several times-for gifts and to serve during the holidays. To say that they were "well-received" would be an understatement. They are so easy to make, and people just rave about them. Also, the flavoring and garnishing variations are endless. A great recipe!!!

This is a pretty common truffle recipe. I love to make truffles and like that you can flavor them with anything - I like to use Grand Marnier and a little orange zest. I'm somewhat surprised after all the comments on how soft they are that no one has sugested the solution! All truffles, correctly made, are soft. If this is a problem, making them difficult to handle (it is for me too), simply take the the truffles while still frozen and dip them in melted chocolate (dark, bittersweet, semi-sweet or white). After the chocolate sets they're easy to handle and no more instant melting; yet at the same time you still have that soft melty inside!

Although this recipe couldn't be easier, I was very disappointed with the finished product, as the truffles were very soft. They could not be left out at room temperature for more than a few minutes without getting too messy to pick up.

I also thought these were fairly easy. I had to store them in the freezer after they were completed due to the very soft consistency--do not let them sit out long before serving! I found that I did not need such large quantities of cocoa, coconut, or pistachios. About half the amount or less will do to roll all the truffles. I prefered the cocoa topping.

Very good and easy to make! I used these as a perfect gift for Valentines Day and received rave reviews. Try substituting chopped peanuts for the pistachios.

Very easy to prepare. In addition, I also used white chocolate and I handrolled the truffles. I didn't use the coconut but I did add macadamia nuts to the centers of some of the truffles. Watch the cooling time, they were ready to roll in about an hour.
