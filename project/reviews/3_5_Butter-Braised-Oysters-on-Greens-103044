I found that the vinegar overwhelmed the flavor of the oysters.

Superb. And to the cook from Seattle--you can cut down on the butter without affecting the flavor too much, and "a lot" is two words.

My new favorite oyster recipe, and I only made it because my husband came home with four dozen oysters instead of the crab I'd asked for. I doubled the recipe and took it to a New Year's Eve dinner, and put the skillet full of oysters straight on the table with the pile of crostini and greens nearby. People gobbled them up with their wine and everyone absolutely loved them. The sherry vinegar gave the oysters a lovely warm, sweet, nutty flavor.

I found myself with a couple of pints of fresh oysters given to me by a friend who was leaving on vacation. This recipe was a fantastic, quick way to enjoy them! One note - lacking mesclun greens, I made a salad of fresh leaf lettuce, tomatoes, and thin-sliced red onion. Threw in a sliced plum as an afterthought and dressed the whole thing with a simple balsamic viniagrette. The occasional sweet tang of the plum as I ate the salad with the oysters was the perfect foil (I thought!) for the meaty, savory flavor of the oysters. Thanks for a marvellous oyster recipe that doesn't call for bacon, tons of cheese, breading or heavy sauce. (Sure, there's kind of alot of butter but it doesn't seem heavy). This simple preparation lets the flavor shine through - and it's so easy!

I have never cooked oysters before. This recipe is superb. Will be doing again soon.
