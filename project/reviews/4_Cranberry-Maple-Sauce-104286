I, too, have been making this ever since 2000. I had thought about trying something different for this year's Thanksgiving dinner, and then I asked myself why I'd want to do that. This one is a winner and everyone loves it. Making it again in 2012.

I have been making this for years. If you don't have maple extract on hand, you can eliminate it. The recipe is perfect as is for a simple cranberry sauce taste; you can also spice it up if desired.

I love all types of cranberry sauce. Unfortunately, my extended family prefers it simple and basic. This is a nice way to add depth and interest to cranberry sauce without turning off the less adventurous relatives. Nice recipe and very easy.

This is a MUST MAKE every Thanksgiving! We now live in the southern hemisphere so I must search out frozen cranberries to make this recipe. But Thanksgiving just wouldn't be the same without it!!!

I completely cut out the brown sugar and the maple extract, because I wanted to use only ingredients the Native Americans would have had access to. It turned out delicious, not too sweet, and not too maple-y. The copious leftovers disappeared in under 24 hours, and folks were begging for my recipe.

This cranberry sauce made me see GOD! It is absolutely, insanely delicious. This is the one I'll be using for the rest of my life. My alterations were as follows: I did not use maple extract. I used 1/2 cup loose brown sugar (it was plenty sweet with the maple and this allowed the tartness to shine through). Also, just an FYI, I used grade A maple syrup for this (sugar house made). All my guests loved this recipe and several asked to take some home with them.

I usually puree the sauce after cooking and then throw in chunks of walnuts. People LOVE this stuff!

I've made this every year since 2000. A winner. I make a double batch and keep it in the fridge for awhile. Add more maple and put it over cornmeal pancakes, add demi glace and you have a sauce for duck. Yumm-o ala Rachel Ray.

This has been our favorite-ever cranberry sauce recipe since we made it in 2000. Everyone loves it every year. We make the recipe exactly as written (although I like the idea of adding nuts!) and after Thanksgiving, we even like it on toast as jam! (Yes, I guess it is rather sweet....)

I have made this recipe the past 3 Thanksgivings, and also brought it to other people's homes for Christmas dinner. I add 4 cans of drained mandarin oranges and about 3/4 cup chopped mixed walnuts and pecans. It is so delicious. People rave about it and I have had many requests for the recipe.

I've made this sauce 3 years running and love the taste and how easy it is to make. I don't particularly like tart cranberries, so I like the sweetness of this sauce. My husband likes the tartness, so I will try the suggestion from others of adding some lemon and lemon zest to cut the sweetness a bit.

This is our favorite cranberry sauce. We've made it for a couple of years now. I leave out the maple extract and add the zest and juice of one lemon to round out the taste and so it isn't quite so sweet.

With the addition of a little lemon zest and juice this recipe is outstanding. Otherwise its a little sweet and flat.

I found this way too sweet - I love the tartness of cranberries, and didn't think that came through as well as it could. I will make it again, but with half the sugar, because I did like the maple flavouring with the cranberries. I added walnuts to mine, which gave it a nice crunch and a slightly different flavour.

This quickly became my favorite cranberry sauce recipe. We use it all year.

I made a half recipe with one bag of cranberries, but instead of halving the water I eliminated it and added 1/2 c. bourbon. This was great if you like a bourbon flavor, the adults loved this. I have made lots of different cranberry variations over the years, this turned out to be one of the best ever.

This was a very simple and delicious recipe. I definitely did not feel it was too sweet. In fact, this was my first attempt at homemade cranberry sauce and I was so happy with the results. Will definitely make again-my family loved it!

It was WAY TOO SWEET for me... so I cut the amount of maple sugar down, and added a little bit, to taste, as needed. The maple is really a nice touch and it is SO EASY!

It was a very tasty cranberry sauce, but it was just a trifle over-sweet.

I have always preferred a traditional cranberry sauce. You know, Sugar, water and Cranberries. If you are like me and don't particularily care for the Cranberry sauces with lots of additions (ie: pineapple) then you are going to love this recipe. It is the best cranberry sauce I have ever had. I will make it every thanksgiving to come.

Excellent and different! After reading the recipe while waiting in my dentist's waiting room, I scribbled it down on some scrap of paper I had in my purse because I just HAD to give it a try and boy am I glad I did. I made 2 batches year. One batch I left with my in-laws and I took the other batch with me to Denver where I had Thanksgiving with family members from across the U.S. It got HUGE raves both here in CA as well as in Denver!!!!! I love it! It's easy and tastes SO good!

I just made this for Canadian Thanksgiving - AWESOME! Even better the next day with hot leftover turkey sandwiches.

I made this for Christmas instead of my usual chutney. It was too sweet. The maple flavor overpowered the cranberries and was too sweet as an accompaniment to the turkey. It was still fun to test it. There were a few that enjoyed it alot.

I made this, along with several other recipes for Thanksgiving Dinner (in fact, almost the whole dinner came from the November Bon Appe'tit!) and my guests raved over it. I have been requested to bring it to Christmas dinner at a friend's house.

Very distinctive maple flavor...will definitely make it again next Thanksgiving.

This was my dad's contribution to Thanksgiving dinner. He used an intensly-flavored grade B maple syrup from Vermont - it proved to be an outstanding addition. The combination of maple and cranberry was divine. A nice change from the more traditional cranberry sauce - we'll definitely serve it again.
