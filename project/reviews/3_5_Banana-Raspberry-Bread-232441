I've made this twice. It's different than regular banana bread, but I really like it's moist texture studded with raspberries which create little pockets of berry flavor. I added walnuts the first time but not the second time - liked it both ways. The first time I only used 3 bananas but made it second time with 4 large very ripe bananas and worked great - so moist and I love the banana flavor. Recipe has some flex. I put the frozen raspberries straight into the batter without rinsing (which I recommend), so the coldness may have made the baking time longer, but it baked for 10 extra minutes until I felt it was ready (1 hr 10 min total). Next time I will try adding a bit less sugar (someone suggested 1/2 cup) and try subbing 1/2 cup flour for oats, or one cup of the flour for whole wheat flour - for added whole grain healthiness.

As others suggested, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I also used Robinhood Nutriblend flour instead of white flour. the bread turned out very well. next time I'll add some cinnamon.

Outstanding recipe, moist and delicious. Substituted splenda for sugar for even healthier recipe. Definitely recommend! Next time, adding walnuts.

Like another reviewer, I only had 3 overripe bananas so I added a little more milk at the end so wet the batter. Other then that and replacing the raspberries with blueberries, I followed the recipe as written. It is moist and delicious..best banana bread I've ever made. Brought it to a party with a side of softened butter and the crowd went wild! Will definitely make again, next time adding some walnut.

I must apologise because I made several changes to this recipe as I'm trying to reduce the amount of flour & sugar my family consume but this turned out so well I have to share! In place of 2 cups flour, I used food processor to combine 1/2 c flour, 1 c oatmeal, 1/3 c ground flax seed, 1/3 cup ground almonds, 1/3 c unsweetened coconut. I also used 1/2 c splenda instead of sugar and upped the vanilla to 2tsp. I also omitted the berries and baked for 1 hour. Turned out moist and delicious! Will definitely make again!

I used the 1/2 cup sugar as recommended by others, and it was plenty sweet. The top of the loaf got gooey over the course of a couple days after this was made. I think next time I'd add a little more flour or bake it longer or something, because I ended up eating around that part of each slice. Stored it wrapped in aluminum foil like I always do for banana bread, but I've never had this problem before.

Surprisingly good considering there is no oil or butter in the batter. I mashed the 1 cup of raspberries along with the bananas, then folded in a few extra whole ones. I also used 1 cup of whole-wheat flour and 1 cup of all-purpose. Lastly, taking the advice of other reviewers (thanks!) I only used 1/2 cup of sugar. I like things sweet and that was plenty. Looking forward to making this again!

I also used 1/2 cup sugar, and it turned out perfectly sweet. The flavors weren't overwhelming, and it was super moist

Delicious! I used only 1/2 c sugar and added a dash of cinnamon. I also left the bananas lumpy instead of completely mashed which gave it a great texture. I think next time I'd puree the raspberries instead of adding them whole. I'll definitely be making this again soon!

I was disappointed in this recipe, i made it into muffins instead of bread, the muffins were dense and not flavorful.

I just made this recipe and it was great! Very easy and definitely a people pleaser. I only used three bananas because I had less than I thought I did; I think it could've used a fourth. I will certainly make this again.

I really like this recipe. I have made it twice. It's really simple and the results are just beautiful. As someone else said, it makes a perfect loaf and the texture and flavor are really good. The only thing I changed, though, was the amount of sugar. I reduced it to 1/2 cup and it was good enough for my taste.

My hubby and I just had a slice (still warm!) and YUMMY! My boys will be happy in the morning :) I made the exact recipe (my banana's were perfect!) and it turned out great!

This bakes into a beautiful loaf! I can't imagine why others found it unappetizing, although I'll definitely add more spice next time. The ginger and cinnamon I added wasn't quite enough. I used 4 medium overripe bananas and did not think it was too banana-y at all. I used about 1 1/2 cups mixed berries, which may have cut some of the intense banana. I'll also swap some flour for oatmeal next time; I think it'll add a nice texture to balance the berries and bananas. Definitely will make again.

I made this recipe last night exactly as the directions said to make it, and it turned out great! It smelled delicious while it was baking, and it was a wonderful alternative to the usual morning toaster pasty I normally would have had. I am keeping this recipe around.

Excellent recipe. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar, and it was very good.

If you're expecting a super-sweet bit of confectionery like you score at Starbucks, look elsewhere. This is a more nuanced bread that will do well as breakfast and as a snack, but if you are looking for a sweet fix, there are better alternatives. Thanks to the advice of everyone here, I made some adjustments for my double batch. I cut way down on the bananas-- five smaller organic-- about what the recipe calls for without doubling. Had I used what was called for, I have a feeling the resulting product would've been very mealy and excessively banana- tasting. For what it's worth, I also added a tsp of almond extract and a tsp of cinnamon (half what others called for, as I didn't want the additional flavors to be overwhelming), and added about 3/4 cup of extra fresh-picked raspberries. Baking took about 55 minutes in my non- convecting gas oven. This neophyte baker was happy with the results and would make it again, although this time, I might double the cinnamon to make it more noticeable, or perhaps add nutmeg or simply use pumpkin pie spice.

I thought I'd give this a try to lighten up my family's fat intake. It was dry, dense and not great. I'm sorry I wasted the bananas and berries on it. This bread was more punishment than treat to eat. My family wouldn't touch it after the first slice.

I thought it was verry good family loved it I did make a few changes i add brown sugar in place of white sugar and i add 1 cup of whole wheat flour and i took a half a cup of wheat grem and a half cup of organic pumpkin flaxplus granola and put it in the blender and tell it was the same as flour and use it in place of the other cup of flour and i add dried cranberry instead of raspberrys

This was not good. Just make your favourite banana bread recipe - and add some raspberries, as this recipe suggests, and I'm sure you'll have a delicious bread. The taste and texture left something to be desired. This is touted as low-fat, which it is, but it is absolutely unsatisfying. Just one slice of a regular banana bread would be infinitely more enjoyable than eating this entire loaf. That's it for me, I'll never try a 'no-butter, no-oil" sweet bread (or muffin, or scone) again. After 45 years of baking, I should have known better.

Very Yummy. Used the prescribed 2 bananas, substituted brown sugar for the white and 1 cup blueberries for the raspberries. Added some cinnamon and nutmeg and sprinkled the top with white sugar. Only took approximately 50 mins to bake. Fellow workers approved.

Having made this bread at least 5 times in the last year, I feel I should let you guys know a few things. First, the people who wrote the recipe were kidding when they said 4 large bananas. It is more like 2 large bananas, and if they are medium, sometimes 3 will work, but be careful, because there is still danger of the uncooked center and burned outside. Second, you can use any berry you want - in fact, i regularly use the frozen berry mixes, with great success. Third, sometimes if i want something even healthier (as if this is not healthy enough) i substitute a quarter cup of quick oats for the same volume of flour and add a tablespoon or more of flaxseed flour. It still turns out great. But the thing about using fewer bananas - that's key, unless you want to end up with inedible banana mush. In conclusion, this bread is delicious when made correctly, and quite edible when 'healthified' even more :)...

I made this bread with blueberries instead of raspberries (I had them onhand) and Splenda instead of sugar, as my father is diabetic. Additionally, I added a cup of chopped walnuts and folded in the blueberries AFTER both the dry & wet ingredients were fully incorporated so they wouldn't smash. It turned out wonderfully! For a healthy recipe, this one is tops - terrific.

I had a lot of bananas so made two loaves, and since I was low on flour, I used half all-purpose and half whole wheat in each. I also cut down the sugar to half a cup, and substituted chopped strawberries for raspberries in the second loaf. Both came delicious. I didn't miss the sugar at all; in fact, next time I make this bread I might cut it down even more.

After reading some of the reviews, I deciphered that maybe 4 bananas were too much. I cut the recipe to 2 bananas and substituted blueberris for raspberries (it's what I had on hand). The bread baked off just fine and for no more than the hour designated by the recipe. I'll make this often!

I love this recipe! I like the lack of fat and the very moist bread that results from the bananas. I often pair a slice of the bread with a yogurt for a quick breakfast. My friends that have tasted the bread rave about it!

I love this recipe. It works great with any type of berry. I also add 1/2 tsp each of cinnamon, nutmeg, and almond extract. You can also add nuts and brown sugar on top.

I added about a 1/2 cup of chocolate chips because I love chocolate and it gave a little bit of sweetness to counter act the tartness that the raspberries gave, I also did half raspberries, half blackberries, and I liked the product!

This bread was enjoyed by my co-workers. I added 1/2 cup more raspberries and think 1 cup wouldn't be quite enough. Next time I will sprinkle a little brown sugar over the top before baking and maybe add some finely chopped walnuts. The 1 hour baking time was perfect for my loaf.

This recipe was OK, but not great. My seven year old took the lead in making this because the recipe was simple and straightforward. We hoped the raspberries would give the bread a to-die-for taste but they didn't. The bread took approx. an hour seven minutes to bake even though we have a convection oven. It should have taken less than the posted bake time. Using fewer bananas may shorten the bake time. We will continue our search for that illusive ultimate banana bread recipe.

This was delicious, and amazing that it is so healthy--the fat isn't missed at all. It is flavorful and moist. I only had 3 bananas, added about 1/3 cup applesauce, and was generous with the rasperries (frozen). I baked it for 1 hour 5 min, and realized it was still slightly underbaked after cutting into it. However, it was still good. Next time I will bake longer and try using 1/2 whole wheat flour.

A lot of work for okay results. Suggestion: add the raspberries after you've mixed the batter with the dry ingredients, otherwise the berries will be complete mush.

I made this tonight and thought it was really quite delicious. Another reviewer thought the cake was a little dense, so I added about 1/4 cup of oil and a bit more smashed banana, and substituted half the sugar with brown sugar. It was really quite delicious -- amost like a banana raspberry bread pudding. I served it with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and more raspberries on top. I recommend it heartily!

This bread was pretty tasty, but lacked the spice that makes conventional banana bread so delcious. The raspberries were a nice tart touch. If you want a less sweet banana bread then this is worth a try.

This bread is pretty tasty, and the raspberries are delicious. But it is a very heavy meal. I wish the bread wasn't so dense!
