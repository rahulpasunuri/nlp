Used russet potatoes, no Calvados, and basil in lieu of parsley. Also, I chopped the apples into smaller cubes. After pouring the sauce over apples/potatoes, I cooked it at 350 for about 30 minutes because it seemed weird to have crunchy raw apples with the scalloped potatoes... Turned out GOOD... surprisingly good...

A lovely potato salad in the Fall when there are so many apples in the green market. I thought it was fine (and healthier) with half the amount of dressing.

This dish appeared to be a nice twist, but was so-so. As another reader stated, it lacked bite - and I did add minced yellow onion. The apples were good in it...I think it just needs a different combination of ingredients. I wouldn't make it again, especially as is.

Who would think that apples and cream could so enhance a potato salad? The crunch and mild sweetness did wonders for what is usually an ordinary side dish. Everyone asked for the recipe. First made this when it was first published in Gourmet, and now it's a favorite.
