As the name says, its very easy. I didn't bother with using cake flour and it came out great (flaky, not like shortbread), and literally takes less than 10 min. I used less sugar, as it was for a quiche, and a bit more salt, which worked fine for a savory crust. I rolled it out between two sheets of plastic wrap, chilled it for about a half hour and it was ready to go. Getting ready to make another....

I used whole wheat flour instead of cake flour, and milk instead of water. I used it for a savory pie, so I cut the sugar in 1/2. It was plenty sweet for me so I will cut the sugar in 1/2 for a fruit pie as well. I was in a hurry, so I froze the dough for 30 min instead of refrigerating for an hour.

The name says it all....EASY pie crust. Flaky and delicious. I did not think it was like shortbread at all.

I didn't think this crust was like short bread at all. In fact, I've made several other pie crusts with recipes from epicurios, and several from family recipes, etc., and this one is by far the best. I've already shard the recipe with 5 other people and they all love it. No one complained that it wasn't flaky enough, which may just be taste. I highly recommend it and make it for all my pies.

It's my own darn fault that despite noting that the pie crust recipe has cake flour AND sugar in it, and I STILL tried the recipe. So why am I complaining that it wasn't remotely flakey, and instead tasted disturbingly similar to shortbread? Because I want the next person who sees the high fork rating who comes along hoping for a buttery, light, classic pie crust not to find that they have wasted their time and ingredients on this recipe. The person who said it tastes like a cookie is right. Ick.

This is a great tasting, easy to make pie crust! Followed other reviewers lead,froze butter and shortening. This is easy to process and a cinch to roll out. I will make it with savory herbs for quiches and such. Best crust recipe I have ever used.

This is a really excellent pie crust. I hadn't made my own crust in years so I was way out of practice, but this came out beautifully. I took the advice of people here and froze the butter and shortening, and it really worked well.

Wonderful pie crust! Reduced the sugar by 1/2 for a quiche...loved it! I always put my diced butter/shortening in the freezer. Much easier. Also, didn't use food processor and it's fine by hand.

I always dread pie crusts, but every year I attempt a different recipe. This one is perfect. I rolled out five pie crusts in no time. The edges were uniform, not jagged and it was a breeze to place in the pan. I used frozen butter and shortening which I think helped and rolled my dough on wax paper which I stuck to my counter with water. Easy and tastes great!

By the way I don't have a food processor. I just worked the ingredients with my hands and it was perfect.

I don't know that this crust was any easier than most. Pie crust is of course not brain surgery. It was however amazingly delicious. Absolutely perfect. Buttery and fabulously flaky. It had a flavor almost like rugalach dough which is amazing since there is no cream cheese in it. This is my new staple pie dough recipe. Amazing!!

I baked it as a shell to fill with chocolate cream pie filling. The results were a badly shrunken shell that tasted more like a butter cookie than a pie shell. Didn't use it...

This pie crust has worked for me! I've even frozen half and used it a month later. It's not very sweet but it's a good base for sweet pies.

I could not believe all the glowing reviews for this pie crust but they were all true. Easy to make, easy to handle, flaky and flavorful. If your pie crusts looked like the map of South America when you rolled them out, this is the crust for you.

Simply wonderful. I doubled the recipe and used one crust for an apple crumb pie and the other for a coconut cream. Both turned out very nice. This has to be the best pie crust recipe I've ever made. Very easy to handle and FLAKY!!!

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe and used the second half to make a lattice top for a cherry pie. Because there was butter in the recipe, the top crust was a beautiful golden brown. It was my first time making pie, and it couldn't have been easier or turned out better!!!

This was the most amazing crust I've ever had! And it is so fast---I had it in the fridge in about 7 minutes. I had a Trader Joe's can of crabmeat that I wanted to use up, so I decided to make a crab quiche, and LUCKILY was too lazy to run to the store for a pie crust---came across this recipe and I am forever hooked. I was afraid that because it had sugar in it, that it would be too sweet for a quiche, but it was perfect--flaky, delicious flavor...THE best pie crust recipe I've ever made.

This is by far the best pie crust I've ever made (and I've tried a number of recipes). It was tender, delicious, and so easy to handle. I used for a lattice-topped pie, which I don't make that often because of the hassle. I agree with the previous reviewer...I'll be making more pies now, also much to my husband's delight (he grew up on his mother's excellent pies).

Neven let it be said that an old cook can't learn new tricks....I am no pie maker for sure, but my husband loves them. I've always used my mother's traditional recipe, but was looking for something fast and easy for Father's Day. I like this new-fangled machine they call the food processor.....this crust was easy enough I think I'll actually be making more pies....much to my hubby's delight!

Excellent, I have used the same recipe for many years with two changes.. I use cold milk instead of water and add 1/2 t of baking powder to the dry ingredients.

This is an excellent pie crust recipe...very tender and flakey...and holds up to a liquid pie. I used it for pumpkin pie, too, and it was delicious.

Very simple to use! It even rolls out easily and "flops" into the pie pan without crumbling or losing its shape. Great taste makes this recipe a real winner!

Perfect!! The recipe was not only easy to follow but it tastes great. I modified it just a bit by adding a touch of orange juice.
