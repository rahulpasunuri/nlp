Wow! Just made a batch of these with my 8 year old. Super easy and super yummy. Made 24 minis (12 min) and 5 regular (20 min). Didn't have whipping cream on hand so I thinned the icing with milk instead and it was super light and fluffy. I piped it on and they look perfect. Off I go to lick the icing bowl!

Three forks because it's nothing terribly inventive, but still much better than anything you could find at the grocery store. My oven usually runs a bit high but these took 28 minutes to cook, and the recipe definitely makes 12 cupcakes in a standard pan. The frosting yields a little less than I would have hoped for, but it is indeed delicious and fluffy. The cupcake can definitely stand on its own if you don't like peanut butter--they crack beautifully on the top.

These were very good, but I agree with everyone who said they should be done as minis. They are just too heavy otherwise. I had some trouble getting the frosting right, so just went without. Some of my friends had them with ice cream and loved it.

I made my famous brownie (which is similar to this except less much sugar) and the peanut butter frosting with some alterations: 1/2 cup powdered sugar + 1 cup homemade peanut butter + 1/2 stick salted butter + vanilla extract + 1/2 cup original yogurt. It's making a stir in the office, some claim it's the BEST brownie EVER!!!

Easy, easy, easy! This made 40 minis, which is the way these should be eaten-all in one bite. Use your pastry bag for just a dollop of frosting on top. The frosting makes it. Even though I like things sickening sweet, the mixed-in chocolate chips could be 1/2 cup mini chips IF you make the minis. I plan to use the frosting somewhere else - don't know where, maybe a chocolate cake?

My family loved these and so did I. I only had a small issue with the frosting, maybe because I used a peanut butter that was the "natural" kind...? It was just very thick, not light and fluffy, still delicious but not pretty. Over all though, delicious:)

The peanut butter frosting was excellent! Not too sweet, perfect! Very rich dessert though so if you're looking for something light, look elsewhere. Excellent recipe which was not that difficult to make.

Delicious brownies! However, my frosting tended to be a bit runny / not as stiff so my friends and I ate the cupcakes without the frosting. I would almost recommend doing a vanilla frosting with a few tblspoons of peanut butter instead.

I made this practically as is. I did use freshly ground peanut butter and at least double the amount of cream in the frosting. I doubled the recipe and it made 12 full size cupcakes and 24 mini's. I will be making these again. The frosting is amazing!

I also wanted to mention to previous reveiwers...Use some commom sense for goodness sake!! If you don't want something extremely rich, don't make a Brownie with Peanut Butter frosting! How can this not be extremely rich? I don't get these people who make this and then are shocked because it is very sweet and rich...That is the point!!! Go and get your head examined.

I made these babies for work and they got RAVE reviews. I received emails saying "best cupcake EVER" and "absolutely incredible." I was so sad I hadn't saved one for myself! They're pretty quick, despite the need for melting down chocolate and such. The recipe doesn't make a lot...next time I may try the mini versions that other reviewers suggested. Can't wait to try one myself since the reviews were so amazing.

I was so disappointed with this recipe b/c the taste was outstanding but there were two major problems. One, they were VERY greasy. Under the liners in the muffin pan there were pools of grease. I double checked the recipe to make sure I did everything right and I did. Second, they stuck to the wrappers - not just a little, A LOT. I had doubled the recipe for a bbq and am having to trash all of them b/c I'm too embarressed to bring them. It's a shame b/c they tasted great but just a big greasy mess!

The chocolate cake part is really good but the peanut butter icing was gross. Its way to sweet and thick. After I tried it I felt really sick to my stomach and everyone took the icing off and ate just the cake. Next time I'm just making the cake and forgetting about the icing.

Serve these with a shot of insulin! There must be a mistake in the frosting recipe - there is definitely too much sugar (and I like sweets!) I felt so bad after tasting the icing that I never even ate a cupcake. But those who did said that they were way too rich.

iT was REALLY rich, a bit too rich for my liking. Despite reducing the brown sugar, it was still very sweet. The peanut butter frosting turned out perfect for me. I used almost double the amount of whipped cream that the recipe called for and i beat the whipped cream and peanut butter till it was very light and fluffy. Reduced the icing sugar by half too.

terrific! even better than you can imagine. accidentally forgot the second round of chocolate chips but the cupcakes came out perfect nevertheless - 20 minutes was just the right length of time. also omitted walnuts (intentionally). used all 4 tsp of cream in the frosting and it's incredibly addictive. these were very easy and such a huge hit that I'll definitely be making them again.

When people say a chocolate recipe is too rich, it just makes me want to try it. Swapped out the semi-sweet for 60% cacao chips and did the rest as is - YUM. I love these plain with a glass of milk, but will make the PB frosting for the PB lovers in my family.

I am actually reviewing the peanut butter frosting, not the brownie. I made brownies from a mix (Ghiaradelli's, our family favorite) in a mini muffin pan. I made the frosting from this recipe, increasing the peanut butter to 1 full cup and omitting the whipping cream. It was fantastic! Everyone loved it!

These are good but very rich. This recipe taught me the importance of using a double boiler with chocolate--I made them once with the double boiler and they were great, and then I made them a second time with direct heat and they were flat and greasy.

While the flavor of these was delicious, mine also came out somewhat brick-like. I had a hard time finding the right cooking time, as the inside was perfect and chewy, but the outside was hard as a rock. They tatsed good, though and were easy to make. I'll give them another shot, probably.

Absolutely decadent. Followed the directions and used half and half to thin out the icing since I had it on hand, but these were gobbled up instantly. I made them in a mini muffin tin, and it made about 30.

These are the BEST cupcakes! Use the peanut butter frosting for sure. They are rich, but that's what brownies are all about right? I can't imagine an un-rich brownie. That's just weird. If you're making them for kids, the mini cupcakes would be better. I imagine little ones wouldn't be able to eat the whole thing. These are too good to waste even the smallest crumb!

Really yummy cupcakes - very, very rich. I made as mini cupcakes as other reviewers suggested. They were about perfect.

I have made this recipe dozens of times with great success, however, because they are sooooo rich, I prefer to make them as mini-cupcakes. Each recipe yields about 36 mini-cupcakes. I also prefer to use foil liners, as they are much easier to remove. One more thing: I frost them with homemade cream cheese frosting...yummy!

Absolutely outstanding! I made mine as a bar-cookie: brownie in a square pan, topped with the PB icing. Raves all around!

I doubled the recipe, and used half cocoa powderI added 2/3 tsp baking powder and a splash of milk (maybe 1/4 cup) and they came out less dense and a little more cakelike than the other reviews suggest but they had the PERFECT brownie taste. No sticking problems and not as dense as a browie. Afterall, I wanted them to be a little cupcake-like. Creamcheese frosting is delicious here - cuts the sweetness a little.

Rating: 4
I don't know what those cooks are thinking who said this recipe was a "waste of good chocolate." Not only are they THE BEST chocolate brownie cupcakes you will ever have, they are also THE EASIEST to make. I used my metal mixing bowl to melt the chocolate, so all I had to do was pop it onto the stand mixer and add the rest of the ingredients - Presto! Cupcakes in one bowl! The cupcakes are fantastic, and the frosting is perfect - and I am NOT a huge fan of peanut butter. I will definitely make these again and again!

I'm following up to the icing-only review that I did below. These are some good cupcakes! With the icing it just made it a nice fudgy, peanut buttery treat. One thing I didn't do was add the nuts, (1) because I prefer my brownies unadulterated and (2) my tongue is sensitive to walnuts. If you like nuts in your brownies then it would, I'm sure, be great that way. Fun and easy! I do suggest doing mini cupcakes because they really are rich (this coming from a chocoholic). Per previous suggestions, I baked them around 12 minutes and they came out great. I ended up getting 28 small muffins this way.

Rating: 4
This is only a review of the icing - I'm making it in advance for a birthday party next week. It is great! As with everyone else, I agree that this stuff is EXTREMELY RICH. I added the 4 tsp. of whipping cream as instructed, and although I could have sat down and eaten it with a spoon, LOL, it seemed way too thick and rich to go on top of the brownies that I am going to be making. I put another couple of spoonfuls in, which gave it a wonderfully creamy consistency and a little bit lighter taste than with just the 4 tsp. whipping cream. My little girl, who doesn't like peanut butter, licked the beater clean! It's also VERY easy and quick to make. A plus in my book!

Rating: 4
I've made these several times and everyone gives them rave reviews! I recommend making mini-cupcakes, since a full size one is often too rich for one person and smaller size allows more to enjoy! If they're coming out too hard, try cooking for less time - the batter should be sticky on a toothpick. As a result they stick to the paper cups, but licking them off is half the fun!

Rating: 4
I can't wait to make these again!!! I made them for a super bowl party and they were a huge hit. The two that were left went to work with me the next day and were gone in minutes. I wouldn't change the recipe at all. The frosting is similar to the filling of a buckeye and absolutely incredible.

I just made this today and it was really delicious. Sinfully chocolaty and rich - it is more of a brownie than a cupcake, nice and chewy. Used regular paper cup liners and didn't have a problem at all. The frosting was easy to work with, but I agree with previous reviewers that it is hard to make pretty without piping it on. I found the frosting a bit too sweet tho, so next time I'll cut the icing sugar a bit or add more peanut butter. I baked them in smaller muffin pans so I got about 18 cakes, which made them just the right size as these are SOOOO RICH!!!

I agree with Toronto here..biscuit-like. I have a much better brownie recipe that would work better for this recipe. This was a waste of good chocolate. I only use natural peanut butter, too, so the frosting may not have been what others appeared to love -- really didn't care for it that much. Sigh.

Delicious frosting and cupcake!! Don't be afraid to use natural peanut butter, it worked out fantastic. Great flavor and texture in the frosting, and I piped it on top with a pastry bag and it looked pretty too. The brownie part was delicious, however, after cooling, each had a small hollow in the center. Curious.. they didn't fall, they looked perfect on the outside and tasted great. I left out the nuts because I was bringing them to a get together with some people I know don't like or can't have nuts. Not sure why the hollow centers happened. Perhaps the altitude of approx. 500 ft.? Will definately try these again.

Rating: 4
I thought these were some of the best cupcakes I'd ever made. They did stick to the paper cups, and the frosting was difficult to make pretty, but they tasted amazing. I added a lot more walnuts than the recipe called for, and used the cheap safeway brand peanut butter, otherwise I stuck to the recipe.

This is a must if you like peanut butter and chocolate!! After eating the last one or two, you start thinking about how wonderful these cupcakes were and want to make another batch asap.

I dont understand how most frostings came out way to thick. Mine was really light and fluffy. I used 2tbs heavy whipping cream and 1/2tbs whole milk and beat the frosting on high. I guess the whipping cream is what gave it that light texture. The problem is probably that some of you "health nuts" are afraid to use anything but 2% milk. If thats the case then the only solution in my opinion is get over it and indulge for once or DON'T MAKE THIS RECIPE. Seems simple enough. If that's not the case for the rest of you then just try again and make sure your milk and or cream is nice and cold.

This is a recipe for "cupcakes" and "frosting". I loved the brownie cupcakes. They were really easy to make and really fast. I was not sold on the frosting, which was basically buckeye filling, for those of you who have had this homemade candy. My husband liked the frosting, but I probably wouldn't make that part again.

I also followed the previous suggestions and made mini cupcakes. They were delicious. I wouldn't cut the frosting in half though because then you wouldn't have enough for each cupcake. I didn't have any problems with the frosting being hard to work with and i used 2tbs heavy cream and 1/2 tbs of milk. I would suggest being generous with the frosting to cut the richness of the cupcake. Will definitely make again since they were really easy and took almost no time at all.

I was looking for a chocolate and peanut butter dessert for my best friends birthday... like others have said, these are not cupcakes - they're brownies, they're very dense. I was disappointed with the frosting, too - I needed it to be a bit lighter in order to spread easily (ended up "shaping" it onto the cupcake with my fingers!). They taste great but I won't make them as directed again. I will consider doing mini cupcakes, though. They'd be great little bites but, regular size (and I made 12, not 10), they're a bit much (even for this chocoholic!). Hopefully my girlfriend will like them... I'm packaging them in a little box with a knife and fork (she'll need them!!).

I didn't have unsweetened chocolate so I substituted a bar of Hershey's milk chocolate and threw in a few more chocolate chips - the cupcakes were still excellent.

I disliked this recipe as much as everyone else seems to like it. The cupcakes took much longer than I had expected to make, sunk in the middle, were very greasy, stuck to the paper liners, and, although moist, crumbled when I went to peel off the paper. What's more, who ever sets out to make only 10 brownies? Had to triple the recipe for a class party tomorrow and, frankly, I'm going to be embarrassed bringing them even to a first grade celebration! Oy!

Rating: 4
Wow. These are incredible. I made them into mini-muffins for a party. They were a success! I also made a little mistake that may have ultimately contributed to their supreme yumminess by melting together ALL the chocolate at the beginning instead of reserving most of it to stir in in the end. The result was a very rich, tender, dense brownie. I think next time, I'll do it the same way intentionally. Try these!

This is by far the best cupcake recipe in the universe! They are the best when still warm with cold milk and if you really want to experience the heights of extacy, make some vanilla ice-cream to go along.

I measured out 1/4 cup batter for each cupcake, and I only got 8. I lined the cupcake tin with paper liners, and had to take them off the finished cupcakes because they were so greasy.

I could only eat 3/4 of one, and I love chocolate. Next time I might serve them warm with vanilla ice cream to cut the richness.

This recipe made wonderful cupcakes! I made them for a party and got several compliments and requests for the recipe. The previous reviews are correct in halving the frosting recipe...I made 12 cupcakes and had plenty of frosting. The frosting is delicious, but rather greasy (...it IS peanut butter!), so you don't need too much of it on each cupcake. I did not find the cupcakes greasy at all, and they were simply delicious...but they are rich so keep a glass of milk handy. I could see how they may come out dry if cooked even slightly too long...I watched them carefully, and they were crumbly, but not dry. I don't know how well they keep, they were gone the day I made them!

Recipe needs improvements. The frosting recipe as is, is enough for a double batch. I have children so 10 cupcakes doesn't go far once their friends come over. My solution was to: double the brownie recipe, cut the white sugar out, add a tablespoon of baking powder (as I prefer lighter brownies), add 1/2 cup of flour, add about 5 tablespoons water, to substitue pecans for the walnuts, and to substitue 400gr European bitter sweet chocolate for the chocolates. The result was very nice and I will be making it many times in the future.

Love chocolate, but did not like these. There are better brownie recipes out there. Found the combination of walnuts in the brownie with peanut butter frosting to be unusual. Next time I want a chocolate/peanut combination, I'll reach for a Reese's or make peanutbutter cookes with chocolate chips. Will not make these brownie cupcakes again.
