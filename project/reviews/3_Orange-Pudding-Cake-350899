Well thanks all the your reviews! I used the juice and zest of 3 naval oranges. Reduce juice to .5 cups. Followed recipe otherwise. Wife loved it. I will be making this again. Cannot wait to try other citrus.

I confess, I read all the reviews first and I made this with a fix so really, 3 forks is accurate but with the fix, a resounding 4 forks. Orange isn't nearly the powerhouse that lemon is so when you cook with it, in almost every case I need to concentrate any juices involved and that's exactly what I did here. I squeezed a full cup of orange juice and then reduced that down on the stove to 1/2 cup. Otherwise, I made the recipe almost exactly as advertized and it was rich, delcious and filled with a full orange taste. I say almost because I also increased the zest to one tablespoon. You must also remember to be careful with the zesting. If your oranges are smaller, you'll need three or four to get a tablespoon but thats ok, you'll need three or four to get a cup of juice too! Do not hesitate in making this, it's a wonderful change from the norm.

I had a couple of navel oranges that I wanted to use up, and I wanted dessert without a trip to the grocery store, so I tried this recipe. After reading the other reviews, I added the zest from both oranges; that gave plenty of orange flavor. I also added vanilla, cinnamon, and cardamom. With the spices and a glass of amaretto, it made a nice, satisfying dessert.

Excellent. I did add orange zest extract (natural, not artificial) and the result was very nice, subtle taste. Next time I'll add a spoon of Grand Marnier. The highlight of this cake is its texture, flan-like bottom, souffle-like top and everything in between. I baked it in several smaller recipients which is nice for individual servings. Can be nicely turned onto a plate when it cools somewhat. Real pleasure...

after reading the reviews, i guess the only reason i can give this recipe 4 forks is because of the major adjustment i made. i used 4 meyer lemons instead of 2 oranges, and 2 tablespoons of orange juice instead of lemon. it came out fantastic! my boyfriend and i ate 3/4 of it as soon as it came out of the oven, only cause i had to save at least 1/4 for work. meyer lemons are very aromatic and in season so i'd say use a citrus with a stronger flavor than an orange..maybe clementines will be the next experiment!

Technically it was great, nice pudding, light fluffy top but it absolutely no taste. The vague oranginess was weird, as if some ingrdient had benn forgotton. The old fashioned lemon pudding cake I make has mush more zing. Suggestions for intensifying the flavor?

After reading the reviews from the other cooks, I decided to add some orange extract to bump up the citrus flavor. It definitely had an orange taste after that, just not a natural one. This dessert wasn't that sweet. I think that and a more natural orange taste would have made this dessert almost perfect. It was light - incredibly light - and fluffy. Do not eat this hot - the custard hasn't set yet and is a bit oily (bleh). Do no eat this cold - the souffle part gets dry and stiff. Warm is definitely the best way to enjoy this dessert. If I make it again, I'm going to have to figure out how to get that orange flavor to come through better without having to resort to an extract. Perhaps make an orange juice reduction... or add some orange curd. We'll see. I'm giving this two forks for the lightness of the dessert - that was amazing.

This was extremely mild in flavor--I could hardly taste any orange despite putting in extra zest. There are easier more flavorful recipes.

To the cook from Minneapolis, it really skews the rating to rate a recipe you have not made.

To the cook from Washington: We had lemon pudding cake growing up, but my Mum's recipe is lost. Like yours, it didn't require the water bath that all the recipes I have found do. I'd love to get your recipe. Submit another comment , & maybe we can arrange it.

I have made this same dessert for years using lemon zest and juice. I am anxious to now try the orange. I'm sure it will be very good also. The lemon version is excellent. I always top mine with whipped cream

What a disappointment. My mother's lemon pudding cake is sooo much better and it doesn't have to be cooked in a water bath.
