The butter in the recipe ensures that these have a rich taste. I agree with other reviewers though, too much onion and garlic powder; next time, I'll reduce those and up the curry a little. These get a little spicier the longer they sit after baking. A hit at New Year's Eve, an even bigger hit the next morning!

I was so excited about these, but being allergic to dairy, I had to substitute Earth Balance for butter. The pecans got too brown, perhaps because butter has a higher water content than the Earth Balance spread. Now I know to cut the toasting time down. They are not inedible, though. I sprinkled them with some Maui Gold natural cane sugar and that made them a lil sweeter. I think they need more sweetness to balance the flavors.

I can't show up at our annual Thanksgiving potluck without bringing these or there is a revolt!

I asked my husband to try one when I made the first batch (following the recipe exactly) - he kept marveling at how when you first pop one in your mouth, it just tastes like a pecan...and then each flavor creeps up on you and surprises you, ending with a "wow!"

I LOVE this recipe! Chop them up and use them on a salad. Serve them with cocktails. Serve them for Thanksgiving appetizer. Give them as a holiday gift!

I used garam masala instead of curry b/c that's all I had. Tasty! I definitely like the mixture of sweet with spice/curry, but am not sure I liked the garlic and onion. I even used much less of those than the recipe called for. I like the reviewer's suggestion of sprinkling turbinado sugar over them after they've cooled slightly for additional crunch.

I made them without onion and garlic powders, much more elegant that way These pecans are simply elegant that way!

Nothing special. Tastes like checks mix.

I stumbled upon this recipe two years ago and have been making it for social gatherings ever since. It's lovely as written, but can withstand tinkering - my favorite way to do it is to leave out the garlic and onion, use a hot curry powder and increase it to 1 tsp., and add a pinch of cinnamon. I also like to double the quantities, using a mix of raw cashews and pecans. Finally, once the nuts are mostly cool, I toss them with a light sprinkling of raw sugar and a bit of extra salt - makes a great crunchy coating. Basically, I'm not allowed at parties without "those nuts" any more, and this is the first recipe I've ever bothered to review, so... thumbs up.

This recipe was very good - I substituted almonds for pecans & results were still great! I served them at a party and everyone found them addicting!

My husband and I love spicy food so I though these sounded great, but we both found the seasonings to be out of balance and overpowering. I followed the recipe to the letter and found that they tasted overwhelmingly of garlic and onion powder. If I were to make this recipe again I would cut down on these ingredients.

Made these in a desperate attempt to get a quick appetizer together for a Thanksgiving party. As soon as I took them out of the oven, I knew they were going to be a hit. I immediately made up a second batch. People keep asking for them and since they are so easy to make, I am only too willing to oblige. I have made them half a dozen times this holiday season and will make them more. I have varied a little on the ingredients. It is delicate. The salt makes a difference. It is all a balance of sweet and savory and salty. Also, I think the curry I used made a big difference. I used the Sweet Curry from Penzeys (www.penzeys.com). Mmmm.

Simply fantastic and fantastically simple! Pecans are crisp with a great sweet 'n' savoury flavour that is not too spicy/overpowering at all. No single spice is dominant, just a great blend of flavours. Next time, I will increase the curry powder to 1 tsp. as I would prefer it to be a bit more distinctive in the spice mix. This recipe is a real keeper! Cheers!

Wonderful no matter how much pecans cost this winter. Addicting and everything else everyone said in their reviews!

Bet you can't eat just one handful! My family is all on a low carb diet meaning I'm not allowed to make chex mix for the holidays. Believe it or not, these pecans taste a lot like chex mix(the homemade kind) and are just as hard to put down. I've already made several batches and Thanksgiving is still a week away. The first bite might be a bit odd to some since it is an unusual combination of flavors. If a little too "spicy" just add another 1/2 to a full tbsp of honey. You might have to cook them a bit longer so that they're not sticky.

Simple enough to make, but the aroma was overbearing and taste was overpowering. The description said 'good with drinks,' my tasters thought they might be good if you were drunk!

Correction, the salad I made the pecans for is actually, SPINACH SALAD WITH APPLES, AVOCADO, AND BACON - yummmy

The pecans were a huge hit! At first, I thought they might be too spicy for some but the flavors settled down overnight and they were the perfect blend of spices for everyone's tastes. Got several requests for the recipe.

I've been making this so many times and I just love this!! I tried it with maple syrup instead of honey and with some other spices instead of curry. This is a great party snack!

I've done lots of different spiced nut recipes to give as Christmas gifts, but this is tops. The crisp candied effect that you get from baking them with a honey coating is quite delish. This would also be good to do this recipe with walnuts and then add them to stir-fries like the Chinese do (candied walnuts). I intend to give lots as gifts for the holidays. I did freeze them and they even taste good before they've had time to thaw!

Mmm! This has got to be one of the easiest, tastiest recipes ever. You can whip these together in a matter of minutes with minimal mess and effort. I've made them several times now, and while the recipe is wonderful as written, I've found these alterations also had great results: 1. I've yet to find a nut this recipe won't work with. I've tried hazelnuts and brazil nuts -but pecans are still my personal favorite. 2. The spice mixture lends itself well to improv. This time I added a half teaspoon of ground ancho pepper in addition to the usual ingredients. YUM! If you wanted to make this recipe non-spicy, I think the ancho alone would do the trick as well. I agree with the previous reviewer: I have no idea how long these keep -they're never around that long!

The pecans were delicious! A bit on the spicey side, but my guests loved them. Very easy to make and quite tasty. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I am a caterer in Maine. I used this recipe on an hors d'oeuvre set up for an art opening. They compliment cheese, crackers, veggies and punch nicely. Everyone loved them and I will certinly use this recipe again.

A wonderful blend of spice, salt and sweet without any of them dominating! Can last more than the recipe's suggested one week, if you can keep your family out of them!

This was a big hit at my Thanksgiving dinner. My husband took them to work & they were eaten right up. I added some toasted almonds this time, and will try adding cashews next time, as well.

These good, not great. I felt like they needed a little more honey whick I will add next time. The best ones I have ever made are from the Inn at Little Washington Cookbook. There is a similar and easier recipe on this site--Spiced Pecans--that I plan to try next.

I made these for Thanksgiving. They were easy to make and quite tasty. I would definately make them again.

These are fabulous and take no more than five minutes to put together. I didn't have garlic powder so I just smashed up a garlic clove and added it to the butter mixture.
