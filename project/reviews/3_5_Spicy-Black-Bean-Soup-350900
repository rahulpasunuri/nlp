This is one of my favorite recipes, but I use chicken broth instead of water. It is just too bland without some sort of broth. It is also good with shredded chicken added to the mix, but add it after you blend the other ingredients.

its just too bland. I added chipotle chili, roasted green and red peppers and still thought the flavor was just not there

Excellent! The whole family loved it! And it's healthy! I think maybe adding some chicken after sauteing it would be good for next time would add some variety to the texture. Also, don't be afraid of spice. I think it could have had a little extra pinch of spice in it. Plus salt to taste.

Good potential, but it is definitely missing something. I agree with other reviewers that it isn't particularly spicy. And I also used 15oz. cans of black beans. I think the recipe needs three cans this size, otherwise the soup is a bit too thin.

Very tasty and delicious. I only had 1 15.5oz can of black beans so I had to proportion the ingredients, but it turned out very well. Only problem is that I put in a bit too much salt... LOL!

This was indeed a quick, easy and tasty meal. I will definitely make it again, but would make some adjustments as well. I didn't have a jalapeno pepper, so I used a cayenne. I used vegetable bouillon instead of water as well. I added some lemon juice to brighten the flavor as well. All in all, it turned out very well, and I'll certainly try it with more vegetables next time.

This is one of my favorite recipes. My only complaint is that it doesn't have enough veggies in it so I add a red pepper, roasted corn, carrots and sometimes celery. Super healthy and filling that way, too.

I'd add only that I thought the chili powder overwhelmed the other flavors. I'd cut the chili powder back by 1/4 tsp or so. It was spicy enough for me and my spicy-loving husband.

oooh, and don't forget the lime. It really brightens up the soup.

Really good with a few modifications. I can see why a few users would think it was bland because it's pretty low on spice for a recipe with "spicy" in the name. I used New Mexico chili powder, not the stuff you get in the grocery store (which already has cumin and oregano in it), doubled the amount of all spices and added an extra clove of garlic. Skip the salt until the end because most canned beans are loaded with salt, as is any canned broth. As another user pointed out, take the bay leaf out BEFORE blending. Or just cook a little longer and don't blend at all -- the beans break down nicely. Nice with cool avocado slices and a grilled cheese.

Super easy and fast to make, and very delicious. Very flavorful and hearty. The last trick of adding the pureed soup made all the difference. Definitely will make again!

Delicious, savory and filing as a main course with a side salad. Used broth instead of water for extra flavor. Would use only two cups of liquid, instead of three, for thickness. Overall, loved the recipe and will surely make it again.

OK, so I don't like hot hot hot. Used veggie broth, added a little salt and about 1/2 of the jalopeno. What a yummy soup. Kind of mild but very flavorful. Will serve with the sour cream and green onions as suggested.

This is very easy to make, and partly for that reason I'm sure I'll make it again many times. I doubled the chili powder, cumin, and oregano, added plenty of salt (was way too bland as written). I used water instead of broth, but will probably use veg stock next time. Might add chopped carrots or something to the saute just for extra nutrients, but I think this stands fine on its own. Would look lovely with a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro, or avocado, as others have suggested. Glad to have an easy soup recipe to add to the home cookbook!

I did not find this recipe bland at all, though I did slightly increase the chili powder. I used water, not broth, and my omnivore spouse thought I had made a special batch with meat stock just for him. This is definitely going into a frequent rotation.

Nice, easy soup to make. I doubled the chili powder, cumin and oregano. I also had no fresh jalapenos, so I threw in a can of minced ones.

this recipe is a good base for what can be a great soup. i had to add chicken broth half way through because it was way too bland without it. adding chili powder and other spice and using hot peppers also brought this soup to life. i'm sure the recipe is great if your vegan or vegetarian, but it needed some pizazz.

Excellent, easy, and satisfying. My husband didnt even miss the meat! I double the recipe to make as an entree instead of an appetizer and it turns out great.

I made this and used a good vegetable broth instead of water. I also topped it with avocado and sour cream, and it was delicious! Very easy to make, and a crowd-pleaser for vegetarians if you tweak it this way.

Made this soup with canned black, garbanzo & great northern beans. Added some chopped tomatoes and hot chili flakes. Took advice of others and made it with chicken stock - my own. The finished product when is pureed is pretty with the different colors. I will make this again.

Bland!! I even used chicken broth instead of water and still this soup has little flavor. It was super quick and easy to make, is very healthy, and the heat quotient from the jalapeno is just right. But none of that really matters if the taste isn't there - and it just isn't. I will definitely not make this again.

I used 2 jalapeno's (with seeds), and a little more chili powder & cumin. Also added some salt & pepper, and used chix stock instead of water. Left it all in the pot & used my immersion blender. Topped with chopped green onion, cilantro, shredded cheese and fried corn tortillas, cut into thin strips. Next time might add chopped avocado and chopped tomato garnishes. The lime squeezed over the top really brightened up the dish. Easy and yummy!

I made this soup last night and it was very tasty. It definately needs more broth as it is super thick (I used vegetable broth instead of water). I added some corn kernels to the soup after blending. I served it with some totilla chips, sour cream, sliced avocado and chopped cilantro and my boyfriend loved it!. It was very easy to make and would definately make it again!

Fabulous. Sub'd LS chicken broth for most of the watr and only had jarred jalapeno's on hand. Served w corn bread. Will certainly become a regular on the rotation.

I haven't tried this, but wouldn't it be better to remove the bayleaf before the puree? Would make it much easier to discard it later!

have not tried this one as yet. It is similar to a recipe I already use but has a few different spices included so would like to try it. I think I would use chicken broth instead of water. I agree about the sour cream addition on top, also some grated cheddar cheese if you are not having a cheese sandwich with it.

This recipe was very quick and easy, it has a nice subtle flavor. I added some frozen sweet corn which was good. Its not a thick soup, there is alot of broth.

I thought this was delicious. Very easy to make. I didn't seed the jalapenos because I wanted it fairly spicy. Good with a spoonful of sour cream on the top.
