Really awesome! I did make some additions though...added garlic sautéed fresh corn, crushed red pepper flakes, halved cherry tomatoes...really nice versatile dish, easy, and enjoyed by everyone.

I made this so much since I discovered it last summer. It is awesome to take to a summer picnic since you don't have to worry about keeping it cold. The flavors are so good. I substitute chives out of my herb garden in place of the green onions most of the time.

I made this recipe tonight to accompany grilled shrimp. What a hit! It was delicious as written. I realized when writing this that I forgot to add the lemon juice, and it was still incredibly good and easy. I will add more arugula next time as it usually comes in a 3oz tub anyway, and I only needed half for the recipe. Definitely a summertime keeper.

KO - second comment - I used orzo added feta left out pine nuts. Just as good perhaps better. This is a summertime favorite for us and *so* easy. Also updated my fork count because of the versatility of the recipe.

terrific. Use half a box of orzo instead of the rice. works even better.

This salad is amazing - definitely a keeper. I was in a hurry for last minute guests so I cheated a little. Used frozen brown rice, and instead of chopping olives I used fresh black olive tapenade, which is basically minced kalamata olives & olive oil. Also followed another reviewer and used fresh chives instead of the green onion. Even the 4 and 5 year olds loved it. My 5 year old has been asking me to make it again.

Excellent! Made this last weekend on our sailboat and got rave reviews from all our guests. Followed receipe except added more arugula. Serves at least 10-12.

I changed this recipe slightly. Rather than 3/4 cu of slivered olives, I added about 1/2 cu of olives and 1/2 cu of sliced, marinated artichoke hearts. After cooling, I added about 1 cu of crumbled feta to the rice rather than the romano.

This is a wonderful dish. One time I used a little roasted garlic chicken broth in addition to the plain chicken broth. Great taste. Last time, as suggested by another cook, I added lemon zest. DO NOT REPEAT MY MISTAKE!! It totally overwhelmed the other flavors. As per usual, I added sundried tomatoes. I believe Feta would be a good addition as well.

The combination of flavors and textures is absolutely delicious! The pine nuts are essential. I've kept the leftovers for a few days and still tastes fabulous. Try some grilled shrimp with this - heaven!

I cut this recipe in half, to make enough for two people, and to have enough for lunch the next day. Substituted asiago cheese, and wehani rice. It was delicious, and so easy to make. Very light, but filling. WOuld definetly suggest for a pot-luck.

This was so good, we couldn't stop eating it, even though the sandwiches never showed up and it was our main course! I added some halved cherry tomatoes which added nice color and sweetness, and used basmati rice. Yummy!

This is great! I like this salad so much--the mix of flavors and textures is nearly perfect. I'll make this again and again, although I'll probably leave out the cheese--you don't need it.

I am a fan of rice salads and this is one of the better ones I've tried. The cheese was a surprisingly good addition. Hint: Don't refrigerate before serving, it makes the rice too crunchy.

I had an abundance of arugula in the garden, so thought I would give this a try. I am obviously in the minority, but I didn't particularly care for this dish. I like each of the ingredients individually, but was not impressed by the result. In the recipe's defense, my husband liked it well enough to have seconds.

We all loved this dish -- men,women and children. Only modification I made was to use 2 tablespoons olive oil instead of 5 as we never eat anything drenched in oil. I think feta cheese would be an excellent alternative to the romano. Also might try adding a bit of lemon zest.

We, too, have made this several times and really enjoy it. We had it to accompany grilled chicken recently. For the first time, we had left-overs and for us, it's worth noting that it isn't as good left over.

Wow, love it. Can't wait to take it to a potluck tonight.

I will make this again, but next time I will rinse the olives before putting them in and use a few less. The olive flavor was a bit overwhelming.

I've made this recipe many, many times since I first saw it in Bon Apetit a few years ago. This may be the only dish I make exactly as the recipe reads. That is saying something.

I forgot the lemon juice, replaced gr onion w/chives - and the salad was a huge hit - very yummy! took it to a potluck and the dish came back very empty - the recipe sounds very simple but it comes together very well

I made this for a BBQ party I was having and it went down a treat. For all you British readers 'Arugula' is what we call ROCKET. Also, I used Pecorino cheese as I guessed it to be the nearest thing to Romano. Despite the need for a measurement conversion table and 'American' dictionary, this was a joy to make and eat!

Wonderful recipe, and every time I make it for a picnic or office party someone always wants the recipe. My only modification was to add more lemon juice, and I also have freqently used a little feta cheese instead of the Romano. This recipe has become a summer staple in our house.

I've made this recipe many times. I've given it out many times-it is great with barbecued venison.It doesn't need to be refrigerated so it works great at potlucks.
