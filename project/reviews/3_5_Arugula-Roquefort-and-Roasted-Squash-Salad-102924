I would not make this salad again. Too many flavors which were each delicious but just did not work togeteher. I will try a similar salad with squash, arugula, walnuts prepared this way, oranges, blue cheese and use orange juice with walnut oil to prepare dressing rather than lemon juice (but I'm certainly no expert at this).

Well, I am going to be one of the few dissenters. While I like each of these ingredients separately, I think that together it's kind of a mess. The flavors are interesting, but I really do not think that this works.

Don't overcook the butternut squash! (We microwaved ours for a total of about 12 minutes). This salad is DIVINE.

Make this often. The combination of flavors are perfect and elegent. I cook the squash in the shell cut in half. Otherwise, the seeds are worth the effort, and for please use a fresh lemon! The ingredients deserve it! Bo Appetit :-D

Maybe I did something wrong, but the texture of the squash didn't go with the salad. The dressing was so so. Deleted from my recipe box, will not make again.

My roommates and I loved this dish!!! Will definitely make it again.

Loved this! The hardest part is preparing the uncooked squash - I might try roasting it in the skin next time. The seed "croutons" are a really nice addition. I put a little too much cheese in there, and found it too powerful, so I'll put less next time. Definitely making this again!

Absolutely fabulous! I almost ate the whole recipe by myself! I used an acorn squash rather than butternut, but I don't think it would make a difference.

Everyone raved about the combination of tastes and textures in this recipe. The squash seeds were spectacular and worth the effort. I substitued butter lettuce since arugula was not avaiable. Definite keeper.
