The ingredient list matched what I needed to use up, and this was very easy to make. However, vinegar dominated the flavor. Enjoyed it more after adding more cukes and yogurt. None went to waste, but I'll keep looking for a more appealing recipe.

I am desperate to use up an abundance of cucs and zucchini from the garden so I tried this. While it is edible, I will not be making it again, it really doesn't have anything going for it and I'm not quite sure what would improve it.

Great recipe for the explosion of summer zucchini in ones garden. I accidentally added all of the salt to the soup but fixed it by adding another small zucchini and about 1/2 c of yogurt. Delicious (especially with a glass of dry white wine), no cooking and SO EASY!

A good way to use zucchini if you don't have time to cook it. I added garlic, used chardonnay wine vinegar and used the cucumber with peel and all. I like the taste (including heat from the pepper and garlic), but not the texture. Perhaps I beat it too long to avoid the chalky texture mentioned in another review, but it's too light and frothy for my taste.

I too was so skeptical! Raw zucchini? Raw onion? But it's really good. Especially if you chill it a bit before serving. And it takes 5 minutes. I'm going to try freezing a bunch while my zucchini is in season. Even my 7 year old kind of liked this.

Definitely take it easy on the vinegar - start with about an 1/8 of a cup and you can always add more. Also watch out for adding too much onion. Otherwise delicious.

Made it this evening. LOVED it!!! My body was so happy with the influx of fresh veggies! I paired it with a baked salmon filet, and it was wonderful. I do not like spicy foods, so I left the chili out entirely. I used unfiltered apple cider vinegar, and also added a little bit of fresh dill I had from making my Salmon. I didn't need the cream at all -- it felt extremely satisfying just by itself. I have tried to eat raw zucchini before and did not like it. This recipe took away whatever texture does not agree with me in raw squash

For a super easy, no cook soup, this is delicious! Nice flavors, refreshing with a bite. Next time we have a summertime gathering I'm going to serve these in small glasses as appetizers. Yum!

Excellent cold soup. Made it as is. My wife remarked on the abundance of different flavors. Be sure to use good WINE vinegar (not the regular old distilled white vinegar from grains...)... This will be a staple for us from now on.

I made it, substituting a local green chile hotsauce for an actual green chile and also putting the coriander directly into the soup. Added a dollop of greek yogurt rather than creme fraiche. Leftovers were eaten the next day - everyone loved it.

Refreshing, delicious, and a great way to use abundant zucchini and cukes this time of year. I skipped the creme fraiche and used unsweetened soymilk instead of water.

surprisingly delicious! when i read the recipe i was a bit skeptical, but this cold, raw soup was fantastic. after reading the previous review, i cut the water and vinegar (i used rice vinegar) in half. i was also so distracted that i forgot the creme fraiche and the onion, but it was still delicious. will definitely make again and again!

This is the second zucchini and cucumber based soup I've tried this week to get rid of some CSA produce and it's by FAR the best! I used tarragon vinegar, left out the water (I like my soups thicker), added two cloves of garlic, some pepper and put a whole seeded small chile pepper in and it was wonderful. One reviewer mentioned the soup was chalky, but I let the soup blend for several minutes and it smoothed out to a nice consistency. The creme frache, doctored according to this recipe, was a little too salty, however. Next time I'll cut back on the salt I add. I will definitely be making this again!

I thought this recipe was wonderful, though it my not be to everyone's liking. My family and I love vinegar, but for those of who don't, cut back! It is quite spicy. This is great along side a grilled chicken dish.

I found this to be a bit gritty. The flavor was just okay.

This was super easy to make and quite good. The only thing I would change is to use less salt in the creme fraiche next time.

Great way to use zucchini AND cucumber - which come out of the garden faster than we can eat them this time of year. Really good - better the next day. I used tarragon vinegar as another reviewer suggested - excellent. My husband even liked it and he never likes zucchini.

My husband makes this soup all the time. Our friends request it.It is a fabulous starter to any grilled meat. We did it last week with grilled butterflied leg of lamb, pesto phyllo triangles, morroccan carrot salad, grilled baby artichokes, greek salad, and almond macaroon ice cream made during dinner!! It was a great meal!

This sounded like a different, intresting summer soup and certainly was. It had a chalky,sour, unappealing flavor.

I loved this soup! I took into consideration the other reviews and used tarragon infused white wine vinegar (slightly less than 1/4 cup) and it was perfect. I imagine it would also be good with other flavored white vinegars as well (champagne, lemon/basil, etc.). I served this with the lamb skewers with white bean salad also from the same issue of Gourmet and on this site. Great meal overall.

Would not make again unless someone can come up with a way to lessen the vinegar taste. Made for friends who wouln't tolerate chile, so left it out, but found the taste of vinegar too strong & didn't serve it so I have alot to eat myself. (hate to throw anything away. Help?

I was timid about making this because one reviewer reported it to be 'slimy' which is certainly NOT how one wants one's food to be! But I couldn't resist it since I had all ingredients on hand, it takes only 15 minutes (if that) and it is friggin' hot outside today! I'm glad I did. It is very good! Kind of a tarator/tzatziki, I think, that of the three folks in the house who will be served it this evening, two will like it and one will ask "Do I *have* to eat it?" So that just about meets the '75% (or 66.6%, really) of the people who tried this would make it again.' Actually, this review will change that percentage...hmmm.

Super easy and quick. Forced to make substitutions (tabasco for the pepper and whipping cream for the creme fraiche) but it's still very good--light and cool with an itty-bitty bite.

I took this to the neighbor's as my contribution to dinner. My husband and I really liked the taste. The jalapeno added a nice subtle "kick". Mrs. neighbor couldn't eat it. Said she couldn't "wrap her taste buds around it". Mr. neighbor will eat anything and cleaned his bowl. I'll definitely make it again.

Not much taste and a slimy consistency.

The operative word here is yummy. A delicious cold soup which is a great way to use zucchini and cucumber. I will tone down the vinegar just a bit the next time. I substituted a few shakes of chili powder for the green hot pepper, and made a creme fraiche substitute using heavy cream and buttermilk (ala Joy of Cooking). My wife and I really liked it.
