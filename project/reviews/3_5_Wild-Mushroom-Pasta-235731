As described in the summary, this is a very basic recipe that allows for a lot of creativity. I had dried black trumpets, chanterelles, morels, and lobster mushrooms and a bag of button mushrooms. I soaked the exotics in 1.5 c. boiling water, sauteed a shallot with the garlic which added a lot of flavor, deglazed with a white table wine and tossed with fusilli pasta. I had no chives or parsley so followed the advice of others and added rosemary and thyme, which was fine. The lemon adds quite a bit of kick.

Excellent dish with very few alterations. I had no chives on hand, used 1 tsp of fresh chopped thyme. Used pappardelle noodles instead of the fettuccine and did reduce the mushroom soaking liquid to 1 cup as recommended by another reviewer. I found the recipe simple to make and will definitely make again.

This was a great dish with modifications. I didn't make it as it currently was made. I actually found this recipe to accompany a wild mushroom pasta I bought (with porcini, morel, shitake mushrooms). http://www.deciopasta.com/wild-mushroom-p-38.html The pasta was amazing all together! I also threw in a cup of chopped onions at the simmering phase.I did not end up using parsley, so i'm not sure how much of the recipe was affected.

This turned out wonderfully, with a few alterations based on other reviews. I started with garlic and shallots, then deglazed with dry sherry. I used only fresh mushrooms (chanterelles, yellow foot, white oyster, and hedgehog), then added chives and lemon zest, omitting the lemon juice and parsley. (The lemon zest is key--it brightens the dish and brings out the clean earthiness in the mushrooms!) I finished it with some heavy cream, and I served it over homemade fresh pasta with a grating of Pecorino Romano... it was a smash at my weekday dinner party!

This is a wonderful dish, and one of my all-time favorites. It's a great use for freshly picked mushrooms, because it really emphasizes their subtle flavors. If you choose to buy the mushrooms, you can save money by buying bulk mixed dried mushrooms. 3oz of dried is equal to 1lb fresh.

We found several meadow mushrooms, about 1 lb. Added 1/2lb of fresh asparagus 1/2lb shrimp. No dried mushroom and none that were suggested.

I dropped the chives and rosemary and sauteed a shallot instead. I also used a tablespoon of roasted garlic instead of the fresh cloves (less aromatic--more subtle). Fresh black trumpet mushrooms are a great addition but I think the chantrelles are too delicate in flavor -- they get overpowered by the others. I also added 1/3 cup of Chardonnay and 1/3 cup of cream to the mushroom liquid to finish cooking the pasta. The pasta (I used penne) absorbs a lot of the liquid as it reduces. Add wine+cream as needed until the pasta is cooked to your liking. My wife was extravagantly 'shroomed.

Upped the garlic to 3 cloves and used fresh rosemary, parsley & a leek as well as added in some mild french sausage. I used dried morels I had collected in the spring, fresh chanterelles collected just for this dish and tossed in a few stray cremini from the fridge. I forgot the lemon and it was still wonderful, but I'm sure the extra punch from the zest and the bit of acid would just make this a 4.5 fork rating!

With a few modifications, this is a delicious and fairly quick recipe. I added some dry white wine instead of some of the mushroom cooking liquid and substantially increased the amount of garlic, parsley, and chives - I think without these modifications it would be a bit bland. I served it with chicken, homemade focaccia bread, and lemon-garlic roasted asparagus, and my boyfriend couldn't stop exclaiming how good the dinner was.

I made it for a Valentine's dinner and it was delicious! I follow the suggestion of adding rose mary and thyme, not to much and ended just great! The whole menu was excelent!

Made this tonight. Spent $45 on gourmet morels, chantarelles, oysters, etc. and it was terrible. I followed the recipe exactly, but was very disappointed by the outcome. Now, I'm equally disappointed by the amount of leftovers. I'm trying to figure out how I can turn this dud into something else. Nigella Lawson has a recipe for lemon, garlic, and thyme mushroom pasta that is out of this world. It was featured on NPR in August 2008. Definitely check that one out instead.

Add a little fresh chopped rosemary and fresh thyme to help supply a "woodsy" flavor...don't get too carried away or you will lose the deliciousness of the mushrooms.

I absolutely loved this! I used dried Porcini and Morel mushrooms and fresh Shitake and Criminis. It was delicious! I used a little less soaking water for the mushrooms and it came out nice and flavorful! Worth the splurge on fresh, organic mushrooms.

Delicious! The mushrooms you use must be the key because it was in no way "bland." I used fresh cremini, oyster, and chanterelles and dried porcini and morels. I also used only about half the amount of water to soak the dried mushrooms so that probably upped the intensity of the mushroom flavor. I used pappardelle pasta but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. The lemon is essential. It added a really fresh kick. I didn't find it to be too much work either. I made it on a weeknight and served roasted asparagus on the side for a complete and elegant meal.

this was a little time consuming for pasta, but well worth it. I subbed mascarpone cheese instead of butter in the end.

Intersting dish. I loved the various flavors and textures provided. It needs something else. Any ideas?

I made this for my family for dinner, and everyone loved it. I used rigatoni instead of fettuccine and did salt it liberally, which draws out the juices in the mushrooms in addition to enhancing the flavor.

Wow, I'm scratching my head over all the reviewers who said this dish was bland! Did they all use plain ole button mushrooms or what? I thought this dish was delicious, but of course I really love mushrooms. I used a dried wild mushroom mixture as well as fresh cremini, shitake and oyster mushrooms. I pretty much cooked as directed except I used 3 large cloves of garlic rather than just one; I used a tiny bit extra coarsely ground black pepper, which added a little zip; and I used 2 or 3 times the amount of lemon juice called for. This dish is kind of expensive but totally worth it when you've got a hankering for a pasta dish that's just a little bit more refined than the usual pasta dish.

This needs a little more "woodsy" flavor...I added some fresh rosemary, upped the garlic and black pepper and added some parmesean cheese at serving..Also used some portabello mushrooms for an added earthy-ness...Play around with this and it can turn out very good.

I was worried after reading the other reviews, but my solution turned out to be in the words of one of my cooking instructors "don't be afraid of the salt." I liberally salted the mushroom-soaking liquid, as well as the pasta water, and then seasoned it again to taste before serving. I also used 4 types of mushrooms to give it more depth of flavor. Overall, it turned out simple but delicious.

I agree with other reviewers...this recipe is rather bland. I have cooked it twice and found that it is definitely better with morel mushrooms.

I love mushrooms but was disappointed with the dish in the end. It took a while to make and didn't have enough flavor. I wouldn't make it again.

This was SUCH a disappointment! The flavors were bland and (although not really watery) tasted watery. The tastes didn't blend and there was no depth.

I guess I'm the only one who didn't care for it... the dish seemed a little "too simple to be true" when I started, but I love mushrooms, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. I was disappointed (and now I'm stuck with tons of leftovers!) It wasn't terrible by any means - but it was boring. I don't think I'd make it again.

I make variations of this recipe all the time. It is fast and satisfying. I tend to make it with a sauteed chicken cutlet. Also nice as lunch meal all on it's own with some good bread, yum. And since there is no cream, pretty healful, and loaded with mushroom vitamins.

A simple and versatile non cream based mushroom sauce - the "sauce" (really it is just cooked mushrooms) would be great as a simple side dish or over roasted chicken. Definitely reserve pasta water and add it. Very nice.
