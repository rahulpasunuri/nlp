Excellent. Could probably make 6 servings instead of 4. Nice kick.

I am so glad I found this!!! My husband is a fisherman and we have fresh caught tuna often. It is so nice to have a change from the asian/soy, etc I could not find the chipolte and adobo sauce and just added a few shakes of hot sauce and it was just fine...I'd probably just do that again! We thought this would be a great appetizer on a rice cracker. Spicey...but the jicama is a great equalizer. I will make again and again...and share with many!

Deeeee-licious. I went a little heavy on the minced chipotles in adobo, so the sauce had a bit of bite, but the flavors were exceptional. Also used smaller 5-inch tortillas, cuz hey, who wants to eat a taco the size of their head?

This recipe is like REM...definitely part of the regular rotation. When we can't get jicama (due to yuppyville grocery stores that have no clue), we use asian pear, which works pretty well. And we shamelessly substitute Chipotle Tabasco for the canned chipotles. The sauce is amazing and simple and healthy, the 5-spice rub is so easy. One of the highest-yield recipes I have ever met (-: Make it for the friends you like, because everyone will come back again.

My husband and I love this dish! It is a perfect balance of tartness, sweetness, smokiness and spices. It's the best fish tacos we've had in a long time. I used cider vinegar instead of vinegar in the orange juice and chipotle reduction, but also added a teasp. of honey to balance out the tartness. I also used only 1/2 teasp. of the chipotle and that was the perfect amount of kick. I substituted thinly sliced green cabbage for the jicama because I didn't have any on hand. I left the oil out of the slaw. I stirred a teasp. of honey, lime juice and a teasp. of warm water in a small bowl before pouring the mixture into the slaw. The rub was perfect. Because I wanted to pan sear the fish instead of standing out in the rain to grill, I skipped the oil, and just sprinkled the rub directly onto the tuna. Then, I lightly oiled a hot skillet and seared the tuna for a couple minutes on each side. My husband ate the tuna, avocado, slaw and orange-chipotle reduction in a flour tortilla. I pile the tuna, avocado, and sauce on top of the slaw and did not miss the tortilla one bit.

Absolutely delicious. It's a very fresh dish, well balanced... AND HEALTHY! I recommend using the jicama and maybe a little apple but too much aple would be too sweet. I used curly parsley instead of cilantro because I love it, and even my wife "the cilantro freak" loved it. I pan seared the albacore tuna steaks (1" thick) for 3 1/2 minutes for each side and it was TOO MUCH. It was completely white inside. Do less time instead.

The spice rub with the tuna in this recipe is great! We modified the rest of the recipe slightly to make it a quicker weeknight dish. Instead of making the sauce, I used a high quality Mexican sauce from the Hispanic foods section. We also substituted thinly sliced, chopped green cabbage for the jicama and arugula. I mixed the juice of 1 lime with 1/2 cup low-fat sour cream to drizzle on at the end along with some chopped fresh tomatoes and the avocado. We've made them several times and one of these weekends I'll try making the sauce from scratch.

Very good! Give yourself some time, as it is a bit more time-consuming than some recipes, and the tuna took a surprisingly long time to cook, but nothing difficult or confusing. I used apple slices instead of jicama and it was a delicious substitute - sweet and crisp. Would like to try this again with a white fish.

Rating: 4
This is amazing - made it two weeks in a row and am making it for a friend tomorrow. Didn't have Jicama so used an apple and it was delicious. I doubt I would use anything but an apple at this point. It is hot though so if your palatte is a little sensitive use a little less chipotles.

Absolutely delicious! And easy to make too. I didn't have chili powder on hand so I substituted Old Bay seasoning instead. I have to believe the Old Bay made it even better! Served with yellow rice and black beans with ice cold margaritas. If you make this for yourself, you are in for a treat. If you make this for friends and family, prepare to receive lots of compliments. This is definitely added to my "Quick, what can I make that's easy and remarkable!" list of recipes.

This is an excellent dish to feed a small dinner party. Per the other reviews, most of the work can be done in advance. Sushi grade tuna can be quite expensive, so I wouldn't recommend this for a big group. While the sauce is quite hot, it mellows considerably if you let it sit in the fridge overnight.

This recipe is amaaaaaazing! Now, I'm the type of person that replaces jalapenos with serranos and habaneros in most recipes so I was very generous with the chipotle when making the chipotle OJ reduction. Needless to say, I have been humbled; that sauce is SPICY. Spicy in a good, "oh god, I'm going to drink this stuff by itself even though it hurts" sort of way. Don't bother with sour cream; the avocado adds the perfect amount of creaminess. I had some for lunch the next day and didn't even bother with the tortilla; just throw it all together and have yourself a spicy, crunchy, sweet, savory pain salad.

If this recipe sounds even vaguely enticing to you, don't hesitate - make it now! The smoky tuna, sweet, crunchy jicama, spicy chipotle reduction (I make it extra-spicy), and smooth avocado are such a fantastic combination. I've made these tacos loads of times and am always newly astonished at how yummy they are. They also work well for company since you can make pretty much everything in advance. I actually made them for a dinner party and served them with the Black Beans and Rice Your Way for the vegetarians. Everyone raved.

This recipe was excellent. I used 1.5 times the orange juice called for and tossed shredded arugula with the cilantro, lime and jicama mixture. I'm in love with the spice mixture and plan on using it regularly in the future.

This was great. I made this w/ Halibut. I made my slaw w/ shredded zucchini, jalapeno, basil, lime juice and salt and pepper. I also used high fiber tortilla that I think added to the overall flavor. As another reviewer suggested I cut the Chipotle to 1 tsp (If I had some sour cream on hand I may have made it hotter, it was still plenty hot) I keep a can of chipotles in adobo sauce that I had already pureed in the fridge for lots of recipes. It keeps indefinitely in the fridge, and it comes in handy for chili etc.

Loved this recipe, so delicious and different from run of the mill fish tacos. Used a little more oj in reduction as it was very spicy. Used finely shredded green leaf instead of arugula, that's what I had on hand. I seared instead of grilled and also used corn instead of flour torts. The hubs raved and went back for 3rds!

These are SO good, and were a big hit, even with those who don't normally like fish tacos. The sauce might definitely be spicy for some, but it was just the right amount of smoky heat for me. I would recommend sticking with the jicama and arugula, because the flavor combination is delicious and the jicama provides a nice cool crispiness. Will try with sour cream next time to cut the spice.

This was very, very good. Sauce is quite hot. Substituted zucchini for the jicama and baby spinach for the arugula because that's what I had on hand. Also,used frozen Ahi tuna steaks from Costco. Served with sour cream to cool off, although by the second taco I was used to the heat and preferred it without the sour cream. Really wonderful.

Rating: 4
Wow. This was great! I followed the recipe almost exactly, but I do have a few notes: 1.) I skipped the arugula, and instead added some shredded cabbage to the jicama to turn it into more of a slaw. Yum. I will do this again next time, too. 2.) I used sushi-grade ahi, but I think next time I'll just use albacore. You can't taste the fish enough to make it worth the extra $$$. 3.) I don't think you need to brush the tuna pieces with olive oil. Mine stuck to the spices just fine without it. 4.) These tacos are SPICY! I love spicy food, but my mouth was burning after eating these (not in a bad way; I'm just saying... those with delicate palates should steer clear!) I think the sour cream that others have recommended is really crucial here. It balances out the heat. ENJOY!

WoW! These were easy, delicious, and impressive. Used green apple instead of jicama, and added some sour cream on side as others recommended. Perfect. Served with the black bean, corn, and tomato salad on this site.

This is a wonderfully tasty yet simple dish! I can easily imagine it as a salad, too. The dry rub is key, but the OJ sauce is fabulous as well.

Love this recipe! The chili crust is wonderful. Could eat the tuna steak alone as a main course but the addition of the arugala, avocado and jicama salada push this recipe over the top!

Rating: 4
finally got around to making this today and it was amazing. The jicama was a bit time consuming. I ended up using cider vinegar as that was what i had on hand, i did not use the arugala and ended up adding a green apple to the jicama. Served the tuna on top of the "slaw" with the avacodo's and drizled the orange chipolte sauce on top of it. I also took the advice of other reviewers and added some sour cream to the sauce as well as a drop of honey.

Very spicy is right! I made this as grilled rubbed tuna steaks served with the sauce - people were sweating, but they still kept eating. :-)

I made this as a salad, and I thought it was amazing. More surprisingly, my husband (not a salad man) did too. I used gala apples and their sweetness was perfect with the cilantro and lime juice. Dressing was VERY spicy, even with the added sour cream. We used the leftover "dry rub" on a pork loin that turned out beautifully. The sour cream dressing is nice with the pork as well.

We've been making this dish repeatedly since we found the recipe a year ago. It's one of the best things we make, hands down. Someone suggested green apple slices for the jicama and they're wonderful with the cilantro and offset the hot sauce too. True the sauce is a bit overwhelming (big dollops of sour cream are a must) and the recipe isn't exactly a snap but it is not one to pass up. Guests request it and we dream about it.

I've made this several times, and recently did it "deconstructed" as a salad. Used exactly the same ingredients. Bed of arugula (OK, I used half arugula, half mesclun mix). Molded round of the rare tuna with the avacado on top. Made dressing of lime cilantro and olive oil. Drizzled the orange-chipotle sauce on the avacado-tuna stack. Cut corn tortillas into matchsticks and fried them until crispy. Used them and jicama matchsticks to garnish the salad. Really, really great. Guests said they liked it better this way than made into tacos.

I have made several variations. First, I almost always make this an open-face taco salad, layering all the ingredients over blue corn chips rather than wrapping them in a tortilla. I also always add low-fat or non-fat sour cream on top. For the tuna, I usually substitue apple or cucumber slices for the jicama. More flavor. I once made this with some leftover slices of rack of venison, with pear slices substituted for the jicama, again, over blue corn chips rather than in a tortilla and with nonfat sour cream. Very delicious. I imagine it would be good with rare beef slices, too.

I left out the arugala, and whisked some sour cream (about 2 T) into the sauce. Quite good. I made it again with shrimp instead of tuna and that was also tasty...just go easy on the spice rub.

Just made this to take to work for dinner and it's so tasty I had to have one now. Such fabulous textures and flavors! I couldn't find jicama (odd, since I'm in NYC) so I used granny smith apple and it was perfect. The sour crunch was the perfect compliment to the spicy tuna and creamy avocado. I also added LF sour cream to the sauce, and I'm very happy!

Outstanding! Added sour cream to the sauce as suggested by others. This got raves. Will definitely make this again.

Wonderful combination of flavors. I took the advice of another reviewer and stirred in sour cream to the orange chipotle reduction and it was a perfect sauce to compliment the tuna. It was so fresh and not too spicy. The jicama salad was a nice compliment as well. We will be making this again - perfect for summer.

Hi, I just wanted to comment, since I actually ate this dish at the East Coast Grill the other day and was looking for a *similar* recipe. I have not yet cooked this, but was astounded to find what I had on the site! Anyway, the sauce as served at the restaurant is, frankly, ridiculously spicy. They don't drizzle it over the tacos. Instead they arrange the tacos on the plate with the arugula, avocados, jicama, and tuna, and give you a tiny cup of sauce on the side. I added just a tiny bit of the sauce to my tacos and they were absolutely heavenly. (Also, I think they are using blue corn tortillas this summer). I hope that helps.

The sauce is way too hot as described in recipe. We cool it down by stirring in a generous amount of sour cream after it's reduced and off the heat. After that, the recipe is a perfect 10, a huge crowd pleaser.

This is one of the best things I've ever made. The only tiny change I made was to add some diced onion to the jicama mixture. This has a wonderful blend of flavors. We did not find it too spicy, although it is plenty spicy. You will not be disappointed in this recipe.

The Chipotle-Orange Sauce was WAY too hot...was the recipe supposed to say 1 teaspoon of Chipotle instead of 1 tablespoon? The chile crust seasoning was very good; I would make that part again, but not the sauce.

Really liked this. The orange sause was super and the arugula added the unusual.

We did not like the arugula or the spice mixture. It was too much spice (not heat) mostly the corriander, overpowered the dish. Needed way more heat. We had to add some sour cream, tomatoes & hot sauce to be able to finish it off.

I have not made this recipe, however I have made "Fresh Tuna Tacos" from this site (which were great)....and a TON easier to make. Thought I was just write that in case you want a quick alternative.

I thought that the dish was had terrific flavor! I cooked the tuna for the duration listed in the directions, but I thought that it was a bit over cooked. I would cook it for 3 minutes a side next time. I also used a saute pan, as opposed to a grill or grill pan, since I was looking for a nice seared crust. As for the sauce, it was TOO SPICY for us, and we like heat & spice! So, after making it according to the directions, I added another cup of orange juice, 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar and 1 tablespoon of honey. I reduced it again and it was much better for us. I would make this again in a heartbeat!

We had no Jicima so we used shredded cabbage instead. Also used a Pic de Gallo with it. Also reduced the orange sauce to 1/4 cup to intensify the heat and flavor.
