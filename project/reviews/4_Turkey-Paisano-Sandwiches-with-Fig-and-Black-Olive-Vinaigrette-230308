My 4 stars are really for the tapenade/vinaigrette, as I modified the overall sandwich a bit. I left our the peppers, and used arugula for the lettuce. Pretty awesome and sophisticated for such little work. Definitely enough that it would impress if brought to a picnic or potluck. The fig-olive mixture is great for salads also.

This sandwich was just okay, nothing spectacular.

This is our family's favorite sandwich. I have made it many times and decided I should give it a rating. I make the fig sauce exactly by the recipe, but have used a variety of good cheeses. When I have arugula in the garden I replace the lettuce with that.

Fail. The sandwich was cacophony of flavors that really didn't blend that well. Maybe if it was more about the spread, turkey and cheese that could work. All and all, a lot of work for a mediocre meal. The spread was good, without the olives, I'll use it as a salad dressing.

This will certainly become a staple for me to whisk off to work with, it's so quick and delicious. I love the fig tapenade paired with the fresh, crisp veggies. Green olives work fine in a pinch and I think more fig jam can be added to taste.

This sandwich was fabulous! My husband and I loved it. I didn't have provolone so I used fresh mozzarella and it was great. I used the fig preserves (not raspberry). It was messy to eat but well worth it.

This was such a great combination of tangy, delicious vinaigrette with a simple turkey/provolone combo that I had it for lunch 3 days straight (and even made one for a friend, who couldn't stop talking about it).

Was a little skeptical at first when I saw the recipe came from SELF, but it was so good, especially the fig/olive spread. This turkey sandwich is definitely not boring.

Sandwishes can get boring not this one it is a nice meal for a lunch out at the park or just at home on a hot summer day!

Excellent!! This vinaigrette is outstanding, regardless of using fig or rasberry preserves. I now use this vinaigrette on most everything!
