This is so delicious! Perfect for the end of the summer bumper crop of tomatoes and peppers! The mint makes the dish, along with the pomegranate molasses. And the bite of the pepper is perfect.

This was a very good side dish to serve alongside the zucchini pancakes with feta. Together they make a great meatless meal. I'm unsure if pomegrante molasses is the same as pomegrante syrup, but the syrup was all I could find. It worked just fine, although the salad was a little juicy. A slotted serving spoon solved this problem perfectly!

Easy, tasty and nutritious. I left out the walnuts only because we have allergic people in the house but this was great.
