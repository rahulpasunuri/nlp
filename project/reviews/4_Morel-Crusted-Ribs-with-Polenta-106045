This recipe was delicious. I was unable to bring myself to braise big, beautiful morels as required but, on the plus side, I found that this was a fantastic way to use all the bits and unsightly pieces at the bottom of the dried morel baggie! I made several dishes featuring morels for a tasting and this one was one of the top favorites.

This is a keeper for sure! I used Robert Mondavi Chardonnay for the white wine, which seemed to work well. As it was just for me and my husband, I only did just over 3 lbs of ribs (which gave us plenty for leftovers), and did not find morels at the store, so used porcinis instead--excellent flavor. Skipped the crusting part, as did not have bread or mustard on hand, and still loved it! Served with farfalle pasta noodles and Haut-Médoc wine--delicious!

Robust and very flavorful. Very nice that you can do most of the prep well in advance.

Excellent. I made this for my husband and I and can't wait to serve it to company. I use a food processor so it was not that labor intensive. I had dried shiitakes so used them instead of Morels but would like to try morels sometime. I used boneless short ribs from Costco but didn't take into consideration the bone weight so had plenty of meat! I served it with Creamy Polenta with Parmesan (this site).

I forgot to mention I dbled the sauce cos I was using just over 5lbs of short ribs. I also stuck to the recipe except for the type of mushrooms I used.

This dish is so flavorful! I don't know why that other reviewer had no flavor? Perhaps they didn't use the mushroom water? Anyway I used dried porcini and dried shitake (only because the price of dried morels were too stupid and I wanted to dbl the sauce). Aunty loved the crispy bread topping (as did I) and my husband and his brother told me to 'post-it' this recipe to my forehead so I never forget it! Even though everyone loves my cooking (all epicurious recipes) I'm always "oh whatever" but with this one even I said "wow- even I like this one!". This is a fabulous chilly day recipe and I definitely recommend dbling the sauce and then you'll need to make extra polenta cos when everyone wants more sauce they need polenta to sop it up. Great recipe!

This was good. I'm not a fan of Short ribs but I would do this again. Instead of rubbing the ribs w/ the herbs, I whisked the herbs w/ some oil, poured them over the ribs and let them rest in the fridge for a couple of hours. I stopped short at adding the crumbs-couldn't figure out how to add them to the meat since it cooked off the bone. Instead, I pulled the meat to the side, added the dijon mustard to the sauce, simmered the sauce and then served it over the ribs. Also, I used turkey stock instead of the wine and combo of beef and chicken broths. Mixed with the reserved liquid of the mushrooms, it was a great flavor. My husband wasn't quite sure what this would be like so he waited for me to taste it first. Once he did, that was it. This has become one of his favorite ways for me to make them. Try this dish as stated but it's a great base for other ideas.

Fantastic! We, too, used wild dried mushrooms, instead of morels and red wine. The ribs were boneless and soooo tender! I will definitely make this again!

My husband begs me to make this- he'd have it weekly if he could. It's labor intensive but worth it, especially if you can find morels.

I made this dish for a Gourmet Food Club and everyone LOVED it!! It was amazing!! I used boneless short ribs(from Costco-half the price of the local butcher) and substituted dried shiitake mushrooms for the morel's. It was a labor intensive dish but well worth it. A great winter meal.

I made the ribs, sans morel crust. Made roasted red potatoes instead of polenta. Really wonderful flavor.

As I just noticed the only review being quite negative, I thought one might like another opinion. My outcone was fabulous, but I did change some things from the printed recipe. First of all I did not use dried morels as I dislike the flavor that dried mushrooms impart. I have the great fortune to have sauteed fresh frozen morels in my freezer as well as fresh frozen morel stock. What a wonderfully rich flavor and texture they gave the dish. I also used King Arthur brand polenta. I would also cut down on the breadcrumbs. This was much work, but a huge success in my home.

This dish was very expensive to make, time consuming and not worth the effort. I made it for company and it was awful. No matter how much I skimmed it was greasy and the morel taste was overwhelming. Don't bother.
