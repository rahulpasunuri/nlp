At first glance, this recipe doesn't look very exciting. But, the flavor was excellent. I added a splash of Cardini's Lemon Herb dressing to the sauce and baby yellow squash mixed with zuchinni for color. The presentation was lovely--a delicious blend of flavors.

I found this receipe and had to try it. I had everything with the execption of shrimp and zucchini. I made the mash without the zucchini and it was still great;it compliments the Snapper that I used, very well. My family loved, including my four year old. I will make it with zucchini next time.

Think of this as a "basic black dress" recipe- dress it up or down and it's still a winner! Consider the advantages: two of the main elements, the lemon sauce and potato-zucchini mash can be prepped in advance. Busy nite? On a budget? Skip the shrimp. Can't get rouget? Get tilapia, perch, sea bass, snapper or grouper.. just adjust cooking time to the thickness of the fish. Company coming? Select a thicker piece of fish such as chlean sea bass or snapper and do the whole recipe- thicker cuts allow a little more flexibility in timing. Serve with an arugula, endive and watercress salad and baked tomatoes provencal and this is definitely a company meal.
