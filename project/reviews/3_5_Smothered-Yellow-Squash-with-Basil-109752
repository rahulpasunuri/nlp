A great alternative to fried yellow squash! I made it for my two room mates and I and we all enjoyed it. I also found it quick and easy to make.

This recipe was a godsend--I needed to use the season's last basil and some yellow squash I bought in the grocery store. It came out delicious. I used a stick free skillet, so the browning took longer and was probably not as crispy as a normal skillet would do it. I also gently sauteed sliced onion before adding the browned squash back. It could have used more basil because of the onion, maybe? Anyway, I know this was loaded with healthy phytochemicals in addition to the good taste.

Great quick and easy recipe. It's even easier if you substitute a TBSP of basil pesto for the fresh basil.

Very nice way to serve yellow squash. I think I'll add some green or red pepper next time.

This was quite nice. I never dreamed I put basil in squash, but it's a wonderful flavor combination. Who knew?

A lovely, simple, delicious recipe. Nothing like using farm fresh ingredients! Everything picked today!

We were totally overwhelmed by the yellow squash our 2 plants produced so I tried this recipe. Although it was easy to assemble and tasted okay, will probably not make it again as there are so many other really good recipes incorporating yellow squash on this site. It was just okay.

Worked well to use up some extra squash. Although I enjoyed the dish, it's not something I'd go out of my way to make again.

I grew up with this recipe, but we sauteed the squash (and thinly sliced onions) in bacon grease -- not a lot -- and added LOTS of black pepper. This is a nice healthful update to our traditional recipe.

Wonderful dish!! Made an excellent side dish for pasta with pesto.

We really enjoyed this dish. I had a whole lot of yellow squash to cook up. So this worked out perfect. I ended up adding purple basil from the garden which added a hint of sweetness.

We live in the South and have a plenitful supply of yellow squash-did add chicken broth instead of water and we loved it! Served with the tarragon turkey burgers and fried(with olive oil)corn and cumin. Yum

This was great! Easy and fresh tasting and a good way to use those yellow squash that ripen all at the same time in summer!

Instead of adding salt, I sprinkled it with goat cheese before serving. Delicious!

This is delicious. I added onion and mushrooms and served over whole wheat pasta. My sister, who is vegan, loved it.

Very tasty served over plain couscous. But 4 servings? No way! I will use half the oil the next time to make it a bit more of a lower fat dish. Might also try the wine someone suggested.

As noted below, great way to use yellow squash. You can get by with half the oil, but it is important to cook in separate batches to get maximum browning results, I added some hot red peppers from the garden too for a little heat.

Flavorful and easy, and a great way to use up all that summer squash.

This is quite good but it cooks down into what seems like puny portion size so adds up to considerable calories for what I wanted, a simple weeknight vegetable that's easy (it is) AND healthful.

this was great with fried pork chops and mashed potatoes.

Very nice light summer side dish. I served with a steak but it have gone better with chicken or fish. Easy to make and adds so much flavor with very little fat! Maybe add some parmeson cheese on top to be a littel more decandent.

This is a standard recipe in my family during the summer. We eat it almost daily when the squash are in full production. It's also great with half zucchini and I believe it's even better with marjoram than the basil.

This was very nice. I love the fresh herbs.

This was delicious. I did not have yellow squash so I used an Acorn Squash that I cut into cubes. My husband and I both agreed...it is the bomb.

This was great! A tasty new (to me) way to prepare summer squash.

Great side dish, quick and simple to make. It is about the only way I can get me kid to eat squash and like it. I agree with the earlier poster to add plenty of basil, and the dish goes GREAT with Cajun.

This is a great dish!!!! I made it the way Collin from MI suggested by adding tomatoes, mushrooms, sautéed chicken and parmesan at the end. EXCELLENT main dish!! Thanks Collin!!!!

I haven't tried this yet, I just found the recipe today, but I'm hoping to try it this weekend. I'm responding right now to those who have had printing problems...I've never had a problem in the past...but THIS time I DID! Just like some of you, the ad printed on top of the ingredient list...so I experimented...I closed that particular window, then opened it again, and there was a different ad (one just running along the top instead of jutting into the recipe on the side, this is for the "printer friendly version") and it worked! So give that a try, it might help you too! I'll be back with my review....

i used this recipe then adapted it a bit. I cooked up some thin spaghetti then added butter and a basil paste while it was still warm and set it aside. then i followed the squash recipe except that while simmering i used a dry white wine instead of water. i poured the squash/garlic/olive oil/white wine mixture over the still warm spaghetti/butter/basil mixture and it came out great. everyone loved it.

As for the printing problem, when I try to print out the "printer friendly" version, all I get is the ad--no recipe. So I just do the "copy & paste". You'd think they would have figured out this one by now---been going on for sometime.

This is a great way to make use of vegetables coming on fast in the garden. I will be using this receipe again. I am another person who, using the 'printer friendly' version, has the adds cover portions of the printout, making them impossible to read. I have complained to Epicurious to no avail. I see no reason to run adds on the printer version. Please keep up the campaign to 'Lose the Adds'. -- B.G. Cook

To the person who didn't like the ad when they printed out the recipe: Try using the "Printer Ready Recipe" link at the top of the page next time. It gives you a version that is straight text without any ads, color or extras.

Not just for yellow squash. Zuchinni and othe "gourd" veggies all work great. In a restarant I worked in we made a dish called "jardinaire" (of the garden) using lots of gord veggies, mushrooms and, black pepper. Add tomatoes in the last 30sec. and, a handfull of grated parmesian just at the end. ALSO a great main dish with the addition of sauted chicken, beef, shrimp, or scallops. YUM!!

Hello; I thought the recipe was good, but the "print out" was flawed by the advertizment on the same page...bill

Yes, I will definitely try this, but with variations. The squash was just picked, so I really could not go wrong!More garlic, More squash, zucchini or tomatoes added. Do Try this, but be patient. Healthy side dish

With fresh locally grown squash, and my own garden basil, this was a lovely side dish. Be sure to use squash that's no bigger than medium. The big ones have tough skins and large seeds.

My friends and I LOVED this recipe and I will definitely be adding it to my list of "regulars". Don't skimp on the fresh basil if you can help it -- that's what makes it so YUMMY! Also, I tend to forget how much squash tends to "reduce" when cooked -- I will double the recipe next time AND I'm going to try the grated cheese idea as well!

Saw the recipe in "Gourmet" and tried it today with wonderful results--definitely a keeper. I substituted chicken broth for water and lemon pepper for the salt/pepper seasoning. I also topped with sharp grated cheese just before serving. A big hit with the family. I'll try it on guest this week-end.

Outstanding! Didn't have fresh basil on hand, so I skipped the garlic and tossed the squash with some home-made pesto. A great hit with a non-lover of squash. This is quick, easy and delicious. I think you can tinker with the seasoning without fear.
