WONDERFUL potato salad. I made 2/3 of the recipe, and it made 4 nice side servings. Used white russet potatoes (peeled) because that was all I had, and subbed Enova for olive oil. For my 2/3 recipe I did use a whole cup of onions and 2 large garlic cloves. Used slightly less dill pickles (1/3 cup, chopped) because mine were SO puckery. YUMMY--kind of like a less greasy, no-bacon German potato salad.

Very good and no mayo!

I just finished making this recipe. And since I manually chopped, minced and diced, it took quite a long time and for not much potato salad. I would make it again if I had a lot of time to spare, and it is tasty. However, don't bother unless you use a food processor.

If you love brine flavors, you'll love this salad. I was intrigued by the flavor combinations and it may be my favorite potato salad recipe. Just a note: this salad is best at room temperature; It loses a lot when eaten cold.

Probably great for organics and vegans. Very dry, dont be afraid to overadd all ingrediants besides the potatoes.

Finally - a potato salad that my boyfriend (who has a phobia of mayo) likes!

Thought this was a great twist on potato salad. Loved the Old Bay seasoning!

I made this recipe for a family reunion last year, it was a big hit, I was asked to make it again this year.Many family members asked for the recipe. I really think the Old Bay seasoning and the dill pickle is what made it taste so good. This is a great recipe, because there is no mayo, and it can sit outside for a long time without spoiling.

I read the article and went and bought old bay. after cooking this dish, I felt that it was a dish created for old bay and not a dish created for a potato salad. but, on the upside...old bay is a neat spice mixture. a bit of bay leaf, a bit of celery salt and a ton of chili pepper. so thanks for that hint. some people need old bay..and some people need ketchup on their failed dishes. lol!

All my friends liked this salad. First time I made it I used a garlic pickle & it wasn't as good as when I used pickle relish.

Delicious! Tastes better the next day and easy to make. The Old Bay makes the difference; nice and spicy. This recipe is definitely a keeper!
