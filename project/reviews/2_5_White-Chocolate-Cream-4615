Very simple and worked perfectly. My strategy for not stirring in the cream too soon was to do something else to allow the white chocolate to cool down properly!

Fabulous and easy to make. You just need to be patient and attentive to your ingredients and it comes out perfectly!

I combined this with the whipped cream filling from the chocolate-orange buche de noel: I melted the chocolate, then used the hot water from the double boiler to melt 2/3t gelatin, heated a bit of cream to add to the gelatin mixture, and cooled it. I then whipped the cream to soft peaks, added the gelatin-cream mixture (cooled completely) and then whipped it to stiff peaks. Then I made sure the chocolate was completely cool and folded cream into it, then folded the cream-chocolate mixture into the rest of the cream. Sets up fairly quickly. I used the cream to fill a chocolate cake for my grandmother's birthday. Taste-wise, this is really excellent, and I agree - make sure everything is at the right temp and your cream will be fine.

No problem here. Slow and steady with the chocolate and cream.

i had good luck with this recipe - lettining the cholclate cool thoroughly and adding the cream slowly - no lumps and a smooth, delicate flavor. I've used it with numerous other desserts.

Lumpy chocolate sauce!! The souffles are very good, but you are better off just serving them with whipped cream.

I, too, had the seizing problem like the previous reviewer. I suspect the white chocolate mixture was still too warm for the cool whipped cream. The final product was lumpy, so-so in taste and not presentable for company. The chocolate souffle, however is outstanding and has become a 'staple' in my house. (Chocolate IS one of the food groups right?)

This did not turn out at all how I thought it would. When the two ingredients were put together, the chocolate siezed into lumps. Also, there is almost no flavor. Maybe if you use more chocolate and put some unbeaten cream in it would turn out better. As is, I would not recommend at all!
