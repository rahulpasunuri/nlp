This is delicious, and a lovely way to use up extra grapes that are getting a bit old. I actually seeded my grapes, and I'm glad I did, although next time I'll use seedless. I cut them in half, and that didn't seem to affect the texture in any adverse way. The cake itself is delicious, but was definitely improved when I topped it with a simple lemon glaze (about 2/3 cup powdered sugar and the juice of one lemon). The cake really benefited from this light glaze, in my opinion.

I made this yesterday, and loved how easy it was! This will be my new go-to recipe for leftover grapes I don't want to eat raw. I used a regular 9 inch round pan and skipped the orange. The cake is subtle, not too sweet, and moist just like the header claims.

Ms. Wells does it again! This is a wonderful recipe. The olive oil/butter combination makes for a smooth delicate batter. For those who can't get over the seeds, look for "champagne" grapes. They are perfect (you can even serve champagne with the cake!). We ate our first slices without the confectioner's sugar and thought it was just right, but the sugar does give a more finished look when the cake is plated up.

I too used the grapes growing along my back deck. A simple and lovely cake for brunch or with a cheese plate in the evening. Substitute ice wine for the milk for a more sophisticated taste.

This has been a family favorite of ours for about 3 years; we saw it on the Epicurious cooking show originally. We make this cake whenever our local market gets Black Corinth aka Champagne Grapes. I have tried using other kinds of grapes but these are really the best in this cake. It is a little labor intensive getting all the stems off these tiny grapes, but well worth it, if you have kids to help you it goes faster because they can eat a few while they help and you will still have plenty for the cake. You can also stock up if you live an area where you don't get this kind of grape very often, they freeze and thaw well. I love how the little grapes stay moist and juicy inside the cake and the small grapes on top make a wonderful presentation they almost look like currants when the cake is finished and the first time I served this to guests they were very impressed how moist, delicious and different it was.

I was very excited about making this cake, it sounded so unique. I went to a local vinyard and got some wonderful seeded grapes. Nice to eat on their own, but I have to say the seeds were not enjoyed in the cake. No one would eat more than 2 bites. If I did try it again I would definatly use seedless grapes.

I served this at a dinner party. This was fantastic. Used organic red seedless grapes.

I thought this cake was just ok. I will not make it again.

I thought this was only okay. I used concord grapes- some with seeds, some without. (I got tired of trying to seed them all.) People didn't find the seeds to be a pleasant crunch. The taste was fine,and it's easy enough to prepare. The cake is more of a tea time cake, I think.

This cake was well received by friends. I used seeded concord grapes and did not remove the seeds, which created an interesting and unexpected crunchiness. Next time, though, I think I'll opt for seedless and would recommend the same.

Unbelievably delicious. Made it with grapes from the vines in our backyard -- who knew they could perform more than a decorative function? Seriously, one of the tastiest cakes I've ever made, easy ingredients to amass, and I had no problems following the directions to a T. Fantastic.

This not too sweet cake was thoroughly enjoyed by the entire family and guests as well. The method of preparation is straight forward and the results predictably dependable. A great recipe to add to your repertoire.

This is a wonderful cake! I made it for my family and it disappeared in record time. I got asked when I plan to make it again and it will be very soon.

This was really delicious!! Saw them making this on Epicurious on the Discovery Channel, and just had to make it. Was lucky enough to have champagne grapes on hand. This is so light and simple to make. I can't wait to have it with coffee!! If you don't have small grapes or champagne grapes, I might think about cutting them in half. Try it, you WILL like it!!!

This cake was perfect. Easy to make, too. The simplicity of flavor and the mild sweetness reminded me of the best European desserts. Because I live in Minnesota, and it is still "winter", the grape selection was limited to one kind only. I imagine that different grapes would produce other delicious results. The recipe instructions are perfect. No need to punt. Cake is good for any time of day, but especially nice for breakfast.
