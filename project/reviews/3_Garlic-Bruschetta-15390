well its not garlic bread similar to garlic toast,since garlic toast is with butter its not exactly that too. sounds nice as a garnish for soup or salad but use it as a base and use your imagination folks .

Yes, it is simple. Yes, it is delicious. Yes, you can add whatever you like. Made as is, it is perfect with a homemade bowl of minestrone & grated parmesan.

It's garlic bread! Which is OK but on a website for "Epicures" perhaps it should be the base for other toppings such as tomatoes, basic and mozzarella.

Simple, delicious, just like in Italy....

This is a scrumptious recipe - the Tuscan version of garlic bread caled "fettunta." The whole deal here is excellent olive oil and a little parsley to garnish finishes it off nicely. Best part is, the garlic does not have to be peeled, it will come off automatically when you scrape against the crostini.

Very basic and simple. However the best recipes I've tasted include tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and chopped italian parsley with basil.
