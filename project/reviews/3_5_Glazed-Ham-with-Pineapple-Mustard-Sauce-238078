We have made this for easter and for thanksgiving, and will continue to use this as our only ham recipe, as it is delicious. Everyone raves about it. The ham comes very moist and the flavors are just enough. Wouldn't change a thing, this recipe is perfect. Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Having two packages of thawed pineapple chunks (Hurricane Sandy had attacked our freezer, which was the least of our post-storm worries), on the 11th day after the storm and 24 hours after having power restored), I sought a sauce for a pork shoulder that had been roasting all day. This sauce is magnificent. I've been making pulled pork by seasoning a pork shoulder, wrapping it in two layers of aluminum foil and roasting all day at 275 degrees F. Also tired of traditional BBQ sauce, I figured I could find a pineapple-based sauce given my need to use the fruit before it spoiled. I simply blended the pineapple chunks in a blender, measured out the 2.5C needed and boiled it down to .75 C. Added the Dijon mustard, salt and pepper. The thyme i added from our garden, which had been freshly washed by the six inches of snow we had 3 days ago, and WOW. I will make this again and again.

My family and I loved this recipe. I skipped they thyme because the grocery store was out and used a cooked, natural, spiral cut ham. Otherwise I stuck to the recipe. Wonderful, we loved the mustard sauce but it is strong so you need to like mustard. The leftovers made awesome sandwiches with the mustard sauce.

This sauce was labor intensive. Followed it exact. If you don't like mustard and I mean bity mustard flavor, pass this recipe up. This rcipe is enugh to baste three 8 to 10 pound hams. The sauce was passed and a couple of guests tasted it but no one chose to add it to the meat. Bad choice for a good ham!!!

Made exactly as directed and it turned out great, I wouldn't change a thing. Shared the meal with four people and we saved the 4 lbs of leftovers in the freezer for future lunches and dinners.

Easy. Made with a pre-cooked ham. The sauce was good - tangy and sweet yet pungent. Great on sandwiches the next day.

I made this ham for Easter this year assuming it would make a ham that was "just fine" (I'm not a huge ham fan). I have to say that I was amazed. The ham was excellent. It was so moist and the flavors blended so well. Basting throughout the baking was key. I made the recipe just as is and was very pleased with it. My guests raved about the ham. This is a keeper for Easters of the future.

I've made this ham every Easter since the recipe came out in the April 2007 issue of Gourmet, and it's always exceptional. It's become a staple for my holiday planning!

This came out great, I had several people tell me that it was the best ham they'd ever tasted when I served it on Easter. I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe, just follow it and you'll be successful!!

Fantastic! I followed another's advice and added whole cloves to the ham. I had to cover the bone of the ham with foil for the last 30 minutes or so of cooking. This ham will be a family holiday tradition. I'm using the hambone now in another recipe from epicurious with hominy...

I made this for Easter this year and loved the recipe. It was so simple and the glaze really cooked into the ham, making it tasty even without the sauce - but for my guests, the sauce was the best part.

The sauce was very good, a nice change of flavor from the sweeter sauces usually served with ham. Was aked for the recipe after I served it for Easter dinner.

Sauce was very good but the flavor from the basting did not really come through. Might make again.

This was good, but I could not get the sauce to cook down to a syrup in 20+ minutes of boiling.

I made this exactly as written and it came out great. My husband really enjoyed the reserved mustard. Simple and delicious.

We all loved this recipe, which is what I used for this year's Easter dinner. It was succulunt and delicious and incredibly easy to prepare! Definitely is a keep and I'll make again. I did score the ham and added cloves (I just couldn't "not" do that!) and we all loved it.
