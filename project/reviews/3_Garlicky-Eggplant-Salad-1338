It's simple, and infused with the taste of roasted garlic from all those slivers. I heeded the warning of another reviewer, and held all but a couple of pinches of cumin. That was really all it needed, so that the other flavors, including my garden-fresh oregano, could shine through.

I usually love eggplant, but this recipe turned out too earthy. The cumin was overpowering, and the tomato is necessary to counteract it. Probably won't make it again, but if I do, I'll cut down on the cumin and add more garlic.

I had this dish for the first time at a friends house and I loved it so much that I am going to make it this weekend for the Superbowl....it is more like a dip, so be prepared to have pita bread with it. Also I added more garlic than it said to add, for garlic lovers that is the way to go.
