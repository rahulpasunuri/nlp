I added fresh corn cut from the cobb and roasted poblano and jalapeno peppers plus added the hominy as well. I also used the suggestion of adding avacado as a garnish. Great flavors. Would consider this a great, easy go to dinner

I thought it was pretty good . . . better than most mexican restaurants and not as good as this one place in Oaxaca. I used leftover roast pork and sauteed the peppers with the onion in the first step and added the pork after everything else (since it didn't need to cook). I think to make it good it must be topped with cabbage, radish, and lime. If you want it spicier, add some jalapeño or habanero.

I used canned corn and a green chile pepper instead of the hominy and poblano. Next time I will use less stock because it was a little too soupy. Also, "as is" the recipe really only does make two servings, so adjust accordingly. Overall a nice addition to the family dinner rotation!

I added a few chopped serrano chiles for extra heat but otherwise followed the recipe to the letter. It's just OK. What am I missing here?

What's not to like? Highly recommend topping with some sour cream...and pepitas

We didn't have any fresh poblanos, so I substituted canned green chiles. I also switched out the meat with a cup of diced parboiled potatoes, which were added back into the soup in the last 5 minutes. The final product had a pleasnt kick. Be sure to use a quality chili powder, since this is the first flavor that really hits your senses.

Made this for the bf last night and it was great! Had left over pork shoulder so I used that, canned corn, and ground cumin and it was still awesome! Definitely recommend.

I made this using frozen corn and it was delicious. Doubled the recipe to have enough for lunch.

There are two reasons not to use canned hominy when you make posole; the taste and consistency of the posole and the extremely high sodium level in all canned veggies. I made this with frozen posole and it was quite nice. I was introduced to the recipe by a friend who made the canned version. The difference was amazing. Do yourself a favor and get frozen or dried.

YUM! I generally find myself at a local Mexican joint every Wednesday slurping up their pozole, but now I'm happy to say I can make it at home. I used a much spicier pepper and topped it with sour cream, may add avocado next time.
