Chicken was great...but that dressing was just awful. Love the combination of the veggies...just have to find another Asian flair salad dressing to enjoy it.

3 1/2 forks really! I was a bit skeptical about this recipe, but wow, what a nice surprise! Crunchy, fresh, sweet, salty, yummy. I only used 1 1/2 cups of green bean, and 2 tomatoes. Did not have serrano, used red jalapeno. I will have it for next time. The chicken does make a difference. I used thighs ( I too don't prefer chicken breast) and broiled 5 min ea side, letting it rest a bit in the oven until fully cooked.

Very yummy! In wintertime, when tastey tomatoes aren't available, substitute slices of red bell pepper. They will provide the color and will do just fine in this recipe.

I liked all the crunchy fresh veggies and peanuts and the dressing was super tasty.It was quite a bit of work but I think that is because I need a new grater and to use whole carrots instead of baby carrots, ha ha. Next time I would add more chiles. I think the chicken would be better baked and shredded.

Excellent crunch, excellent flavor, control the heat by varying the Thai chilies, gets better after being in the fridge for a day. Tempted to split the cabbage between red and green, next time. It is a bit of work and I wouldn't use a food processor. Very good!

Yum! Only change I made was to sub lime zest for the leaves - could not find them. I used four little thai chiles and it had quite the kick. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious. I made the marinade in the food processor to simplify my life, and broiled the chicken as some other reviewers suggested. I found out at the end that I was out of peanuts, so I missed those. I think they woudl have made it even better. The only other real change I made was that I sprinkled an extra thai chili pepper over my salad, but I have what is probably an abnormal obsession with those little things :) I was a bit underwhelmed when I tasted the salad before adding the chicken, but with the chicken, yum.

This was exactly the kind of dinner I was looking for after an indulgent holiday season. Marinated chicken in an oil, lime juice, garlic, ginger and soy marinade for just 30 minutes before broiling chicken. The dressing is really great - all in all a really refreshing meal for any time of the year.

Does anyone check the reviews. Of the 42, 36 are the same.

Good salad, but not worth the prep time. The dressing is delicious, but the marinade needs help.

Very tasty! It does take a little planning, though the only thing I couldn't find was the long beans and subbed green beans instead. Definitely a keeper. Next time I will bake the chicken to keep a little more of the lemongrass flavor that got lost in the pan saute. I recommend squeezing out the grated veggies in a collander or cheese cloth--the daikon added a little too much liquid for my taste. I didn't have peanuts, but will definitely use them next time. The marinade was quick, the dressing was quick, and putting the veggies through the Cuisinart was quick. Great addition to my recipe collection.

A great salad, and the marinade is worth saving all on its own. Yes for most people it requires a bit of prior planning to assemble the ingredient list but it was completely worth it. This one is definitely getting saved.

My friends and I made this salad for dinner and we couldn't get enough. It's so healthy too! And the chicken gets so tender with this marinade.

Very tasty and healthy, but not as great as I thought it was going to be. A nice lunch dish but I will not make it again...not enough bang for the effort.

Makes your taste buds dance! Could not find kaffir lime leaves, so I did the suggested substitution. Also skipped the thai chiles. A lot of prep work, but worth it because it makes a lot! Hubby and I enjoyed 2 dinners and one lunch each. Keeps well if you don't toss the dressing until you're ready to serve.

Wonderful main course for a refreshing, zesty and healthful meal. To simplify, I left out the cabbage, lemongrass, kaffir lime leaves and radishes and just used cucumbers, carrots, tomatoes, green beans and cilantro as my veggies, and it received rave reviews. I never thought I could make something that resembled a Thai restaurant papaya salad--but this is amazing! Do NOT skip the fish sauce--it makes the dressing!
