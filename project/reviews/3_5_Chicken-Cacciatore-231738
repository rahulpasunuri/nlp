I made this recipe recipe for a big family dinner, and it was a dissapointment. The one high point was the roasted veggies; that was a plus compared to using only canned tomatoes. Downsides? Not enough salt, no garlic, no bell pepper and overall weak flavor. I made a second batch for wife and I adding items above, plus some balsamic vinegar and more basil; that was good. I won't make this recipe again.

When reducing the wine, I added 4 anchovy fillets and let them melt into the wine/canned tomatoes/broth mixture. And I added six chopped Kalamata olives at the end along with the rosemary, basil and capers. This is a great recipe - perhaps a bit more work than I thought, but worth it.

This is one of my favorite recipes. I do make three small changes that I feel enhance the flavour. I brine the chicken, toss in a parmasen rind to the tomato sauce, and when it is finished cooking I mix in a tablespoon or more (depending on the taste) of a purchased basil pesto. Oh, I also use Osso pasta but that dosen't really count as a change.

Made this recipe and I could have licked the bowl it was so good. I made one altercation and that was adding 6 Spanish olives at the end as I like olives with my cacciatore. Not sure why other reviewers said it needed salt. It was perfectly seasoned and I wouldn't change a thing. Also, the recipe calls for salt and pepper 3 times. Maybe they glazed over those steps? Just to close, this recipe tastes like it is out of a high end Italian restaurant. Definitely making again.

I'm in agreement with more than a few other cooks about the following things: 1) needs salt, not much flavour other than tomato 2) NOT a quick recipe despite being categorized as Quick & Easy 3) not worth the amount of work to prepare or money that went into the ingredients

Only in the magical and mystifying world of Epicurious does this recipe qualify as "quick and easy." It takes two hours to make and it is in no way worth the time. Skip it.

This recipe provided the bones of an excellent cacciatore. We used our own frozen heirloom tomatoes(plum & mixture of green zebras, persimmon, zapotecs), deboned chicken breasts and thighs cut into slices, and roasted whole garlic cloves with the vegetables. We also served the cacciatore over spaghetti squash from our garden. We started the dish early in the day so that by the time we served it around 7pm, the flavors had married which made for a delectable dinner party!

Really a delicious dinner! I used fire roasted crushed tomatoes instead of regular canned tomatoes. Added garlic to the roasting vegies as well as a red pepper. I Needed to roast the vegies a bit longer because of the liquid from the tomatoes. Used a whole cut up chicken- but would use only breasts and thighs next time since that is really the only parts we like. added calamari olives in the final reheat. Really good. Might cook the chicken longer so that it falls off bone. I had the vegies roasting while I did the chicken and it didn't seem to be that big in terms of labor. All ingredients were organic and the flavor was incredible! Read More http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/notes/Chicken-Cacciatore-231738#ixzz17oIaBpE2

I don't usually write reviews, but read them everytime I try a new recipe. I doubled this recipe for a larger group, used half fresh tomatoes, half green pepper, added the black olives another reviewer suggested. It was very good the first night, but the leftovers the second night were fabulous. If I make this again for entertaining (which I undoubtedly will), I would make it the day before and let the flavors blend. I've made other cacciatore recipes but none as good as this one.

This recipe was fabulous. I made it exactly as is and it couldn't have been tastier.

There were a couple things that I did differently: 1) I used two boneless/skinless breasts and five boneless/skinless thighs (seasoned with one garlic clove, rosemary, basil, pepper and season salt) 2) I used one each: red, yellow, orange bell peppers and omitted the plum tomatoes 3) I used half of a large Walla Walla sweet onion 4) I didn't have red wine so I used white cooking wine 5) Instead of Sherry wine vinegar I used just plain red wine vinegar 6) I did it all on the stove top since I didn't have a pan that can go in the oven. I sliced the chicken into strips, covered with seasoning and then placed in the pan with hot olive oil. I let the chicken cook until it was almost done and then placed in a bowl. I followed the directions for the sauce. While the sauce was coming to a boil and simmering, I sauteed the veggies in another pan. Added it all together when it was ready. It definitely cut down on the original cooking time! It was delicious and I am so glad that I added the things I did, definitely brought out more flavors. Plus, they were ingredients that my dad puts in his recipe - and his is the best chicken cacciatore I've ever had!

I thought this was just perfectly delicious. The seared chicken was incredibly flavorful, and I wanted to fight my husband for the roasted vegetables. We served it without pasta to save calories but did not miss it at all. Completely worth the time and definitely a keeper!

AmAzInG!If your sauce lacks a bit of flavor, don't reach for the salt!!!!! Reduce reduce and reduce. Simmer that baby on medium low till it's pasty and the saltiness will intensify (along with every other flavor) Make your own broth too. I put a chicken back [leftover from a whole chicken.... oh look! this recipe calls for one!] along with any mix of green spices (bay leaf, rosemary, time parsley) you don't have to use the actual spice part, just the stems and throwaways works fine. This includes practically anything you'd throw in your compost heap (used chicken bones, the frond of fennel, celery, the skin of onions) If you want to add something a little special you can throw in a quartered onion. Boil all that in some water and vuala: broth. Don't skimp on the Sherry Wine Vinegar, it's key. (use good red wine)

Brings back strong memories of the Chicken Cacciatore my father used to make. Delicious!

Finally swung at this one. Now that its a hot summer day, I used my charcoal grill instead of the oven for all prep other than the finishing steps (chix in sauce in oven, then on the stove once the veggies are added back just before serving). The roasted flavors were great. I followed the rule that you never cook with wine you don't enjoy drinking. Would that contribute to some of the bad experiences others have had? I also added some garlic slivers to the wine as it reduced. Couldn't cook the dish without some garlic. I used three cloves. Also, had to hunt around for the Sherry Vinegar as given the underwhealming experience some have noted here I was not going to assume that Sherry Cooking Wine would substitute. We will definitely enjoy this one again. Next time instead of using boneless skinless thighs I may mix in some breast meet. BTW, I salted the chix and let it sit in the fridge for several hours before cooking. Prior to putting the chix on the grill I rinsed off the "stale" salt and started over with fresh salt and pepper as it went over the fire.

followed the recipe to a T and honestly, the flavours are so dead I might as well have cooked it in the microwave from a frozen dinner pack. It didn't taste like something home made, fresh, bright flavours etc. Just boring and dead on the palette. Will never make again.

We make this recipie every few weeks. We add a little parmasen cheese, a little roasted garlic, some hot pepper flakes, chicken thighs and usually make enough for two nights. That way, its worth the extra effort.

This is a fabulous recipe. I made it again tonight for dinner and the house smelled heavenly from the sherry vinegar. I also torked the recipe a bit~added sun dried tomatoes to the roasting pan, because I wanted to finish the jar. Also, only had dried rosemary, so I used fresh thyme and added dried rosemary to the deglazing process. I also added garlic, because that's what I do! Lovely recipe! Only downside is it does require a bit more work than an average dinner, but the results are way above average.

Quite good although it took a bit longer to make than I had hoped for. I think I will use less tomatoes next time, and more spice. I also added garlic.

I made this for Sunday dinner and it was increidible. My husband said it was a keeper and keeps asking for it whenever we have company. The sauce was great with the pasta and tasted great the next day. I have used a red pepper and garlic and it tastes just as great with these additions.

This was very good, I just added some garlic to the oil when I fried the chicken, and I added sweet peppers to the roasted vegetables. It was very good, would def. make again. I didn't have Sherry wine vinegar so I used a little apple cider Vinegar, and I had no capers, next time I will make sure to have the rest of the ingredients and make an even better dish. :)

This is, unquestionably, the best Chicken Cacciatore recipe I have ever eaten or made! I've been a professional chef for over 20 years and have made countless versions of Chicken Cacciatore but when I ate this at a friend's home I was totally bowled over! The chicken on the bone adds mega-amounts of flavor you just can't get with boneless breasts. And if you want a thicker sauce, just let it cook a bit longer. The only thing I did was add some roasted garlic and a bit more capers. By all means - MAKE THIS DISH!!!

This is one of my favorite recipes with the following changes. I don't add the capers and I actually puree everything (excluding the chicken) together before I bake it. I use boneless chicken breasts or eggplant when I am cooking for vegetarians

This was mediocre -- won't make again. Sauce was not thick enough. Didn't like the bone-in idea to go with pasta. For all the efforts it wasn't worth it.

Delicious! I followed the directions and then added black olives near the finish line and snuck in a few extra capers as well :) I then served it on a "soft" Polenta which sopped up the sauce beautifully. This recipe is a keeper, next time I will roast up a handful of garlic too.

This was OK. I am not sure it was worth the effort put into it.

If I had it to do over again, I'd better manage the fact that this makes a great sauce, but the chicken is bone-in. I don't like putting bone-in chicken atop pasta, because you're going to have to take it off to rip at it anyway. Good recipe though. Some of the comments were helpful. I added garlic to the roasted veggies. Worth trying and working with to develop into your own thang.

Excellent! I substituted whole canned roma tomatoes and didn't roast them, but I roasted the other veggies, adding a couple cloves of garlic and a zuchinni. The sauce consistency was just right for serving over the pasta.

I added one clove of minced garlic to the tomato, mushroom, and onion mixture before roasting. I've made this for several friends and it's always a hit!

Although roasting the vegetables is probably a good idea and one I'll try with future chicken cacciatore recipes, this particular recipe missed its mark. For my taste, it would have been improved with a thicker tomato sauce.

I almost did not make this based on all of the negative reviews, but since I love roasted vegetables, made it anyway. AM I GLAD I DID! This is, in my opinion, the best chicken cacciatore ever! The roasted vegetables give it a richness and depth of flavor I've never achieved with my old recipes. The only thing I did different was to cover this dish while it baked so as not to lose any liquid to evaporation. At the end I added some tomato paste to thicken all those lovely juices in the sauce. This will be the only recipe I will make for chicken cacciatore from now on!

I made this for some of my friends at college at my apartment and everyone loved it. There was not a bite left on a plate. I added green peppers to this recipe also. Only thing I would do different next time is add some more vegies. Great simple dish.

This recipe was delicious, A big hit at my dinner party. I made a few substitutions though. I browned 1/2 lb of hot italian sauage and sliced it thin and added it to sauce. It gave it a nice punch. I also roasted 2 red peppers and added them as well, and they were delicious. I also substitued 1 tsp of fennel seed for the capers. I used boneless chicken breast sliced thin and allowed the entire sauce with meat to cook for over an hour. The chicken came very tender. Served with fresh pecorino ramono cheese and it was perfect.

I thought the roasted mushrooms were excellent, but overall the recipe lacked the wow factor to make it worthwhile to make again. There are better chicken cacciatore recipes out there.

Very flavorful - Use a good wine, a good chicken broth, firm tomatoes, fresh herbs and reduce the sauce almost to a syrup. We skipped the pasta: that was a distraction from the wonderful veggies. I use a round, high-walled, 14" stainless roasting/serving pan to minimize the inevitable splatters.

This is now officially my chicken cacciatore recipe - the pre-roasting of the vegetables makes it something special.

Even with grocery store plum tomatoes this was fabulous. I blanched and peeled the tomatoes. I added cut up chunks of garlic to the roasting vegetables, and also mashed garlic to the sauce. I roasted the chicken broth and canned tomatoes in the pan I had roasted the other vegetables to get every last good bit of the roasted vegetables. I also used 3/4 cup of red wine. I debated using skinless boneless chicken as I usually make that substitution, but I stuck with the cut up chicken with bones and skin and I was glad I did.

I was disappointed with this recipe. The vegetables were mushy and I didn't like the end result. I think the recipe on the Epicurious site for Spicy Chicken Cacciatore is so much better. (just disregard the rating from someone who made it with red COOKING wine and then rated it low)

This recipe is fantastic. Conventional recipes that I've tried always have a slightly murky flavor, due to their reliance on canned tomatoes; using fresh is always best of course, but who wants to heat up the kitchen in August? This one has a bright, fresh flavor that is tempered with the carmelized onion and slight smoke of roasting. I served it over Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa rosemary polenta triangles. It was amazing.

Thanks, San Jose, for your suggestions. Because the vegetable are roasted, they hold their shape, even when cooked for over an hour, so the sauce has a wonderfully lumpy texture and very deep flavors. Great leftovers.

I've made this dish throughout the years, but this was the first time for this recipe. It was incredible (with a few alterations) Added 3/4 c red wine (instead of 1/2 cup), added 4 cloves of minced garlic to the pan drippings (instead of none), and roasted the vegetables longer in the oven until the mushrooms were browned (about 1-1/2 hours)...as promised, the flavor was deeper and richer and my search for perfect Cacciatore is over!

Yes, it's time intensive, but most of that time is inactive leaving you free to do other things in the kitchen. I used a good Chardonnay as I had one open and kalamata olives in place of the capers. Delicious!

I didn't care for this recipe at all. It was a lot of work and made a greasy mess on my stovetop and I only used one tbsp. of olive oil to brown the chicken. I had to fry the chicken in two batches and then place chicken and sauce into a roasting pan. I thought this dish would me much more flavorful. Too much basil.

I first reviewed this great recipe March 16. Last weekend I made only the roast veggies to serve as a side dish. I added 10 whole garlic cloves, chunks of zucchini, sliced green pepper, lots of fresh cracked pepper and kosher salt, stirred in fresh basil when finished. Mmmmm, what a delicious veggie dish to accompany roast chicken. Please give it try - I'm sure you will be as pleased as I was!

While I'll agree that this recipe did create a lot of dishes, but it was well worth it. My friends and I made it this weekend for our families and everyone raved! We used an excellent wine in the sauce and we think that made a huge difference. We also recommend adding a little Italian sausage to the mix!

I tried this recipe to see if it would work for a Wine Dinner with friends. I look for recipes that won't keep me in the kitchen and away from my guests. It lends itself well to that and the hearty flavors will work great with wine.

This dish lived up to its picture and tasted great as well. Made it on a Sunday afternoon so I roasted the vegetables early in the day and set them aside. After that, prep didn't really take very long. Sent home some leftovers with a friend who wanted to know how I made "that sauce." Great flavor.

I left myself too little time to get dinner done at a reasonable hour on a weeknight, but all the time it took to make this recipe was absolutely worth it. The roasted vegetables were amazing. I also added whole garlic cloves to the pan. Other than that no changes. It was delicious!

Made this last night and it was a wonderful dish! Used thighs/legs rather than a whole chicken as we prefer the more flavourful and moister dark meat. Roasting the vegetables was a stroke of culinary brilliance - imparted so much depth of flavour and visual appeal. I included several garlic cloves in the roasting pan, and also added minced garlic to the sauce - simply cannot cook Italian without garlic! A little time consuming, but well worth it. Served with rotini, a simple green salad and artisan parmesan bread, this cacciatore was nothing short of outstanding! Thanks so much, Epicurious!

Those who tasted this dish said it was the best version of it they have had. Roasting the vegetables was essential and resulted in a wonderful complex flavor. The chicken had to be browned in two batches, as it didn't fit in the pan in one.
