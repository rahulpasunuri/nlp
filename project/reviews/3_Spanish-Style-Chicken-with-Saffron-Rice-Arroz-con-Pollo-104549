I'm giving this two stars because if I had not read everyone else's reviews and had stuck to it by the letter, it would have been an awful dish. With modifications, it was OK. My guy really enjoyed it, but the effort it took to make it come out right kind of killed my enthusiasm for the end result. Here's what I changed: used two onions used double the garlic used 2 cups of wine 28 oz tomatoes with liquid same chicken broth. I used a dutch over as well, on the stove for the first few steps and then in the over for the last 25 minutes - it took more than double the time in the last step to make it cook evenly. If I'd kept it on the stove, the rice would have been unevenly cooked. Definitely put it in at 350 with the top on for the last 25 minutes. I'd make it again, but only because my guy really loved it. I'm definitely still searching for a better one.

I would make this again with modifications. 1. There is way too much rice in this dish. It is disproportionate to the amount of chicken. I would half the rice. 2. The rice was under cooked and I added extra time and liquid. Reducing rice should help this. 3. This is tasty, but a bit of heat would help. Might ad some hot pepper next time.

I made this dish for my husband and I, we both loved it very much. We had a sweet red wine to go with dinner and both loved it... I will make it again together with my newly discover fabulous dish, http://www.gourmetrecipe.com/recipes/chicken-fruit-salad an easy and nutritious salad! Have to try this one!

I changed a few things in this recipe because I am not a fan of tomatoes with rice or peppers. I, also, used chicken thighs only plus brown rice so I won't comment on cooking times. I recommend this recipe for the mix of marinade, spices, onions and garlic. They are delicious! The marinade for the chicken left it moist and tender. I imagine if you like tomatoes with rice and peppers this recipe as directed must be very good. Some commenters recommended adding paprika. As much as I like paprika, I would've missed out on the subtle flavor of the saffron. I tasted the onion and chicken broth before adding the rice and I would recommend that for onion soup. This recipe took time but it was worth the effort. I would use it again.

this was really delicious and healthy. I made some changes: used 1/2 cup sherry instead of wine, added hot pepper, used brown rice, used water instead of chicken stock, used 1-1/2 tsp of salt (to make up for the lack of chicken stock) and used 2 onion instead of one (and cooked the onions alone for about 10 minutes which made them sweeter). After everything was in the pot I brought it to a boil, covered and put in a 350 degree oven for 1 hour. Delicious! Plus healthy!

I've always liked this recipe but I've never cooked it in a skillet. I always use a dutch oven and (after browning the chicken and cooking the bell pepper on the stovetop) I place it in the oven. I've never used wine but I always add some cayenne to give it a little kick.

I read the other reviews first so did the following: increased white wine to 2 c., used a 28-oz. can of diced tomatoes (because thats what I had), which increased the liquid. I still used 1 1/2 c. chicken broth. I also added 1 T. of Better-Than-Bouillion Chicken flavor, which makes it taste richer and gives it salt. I used extra garlic and a large onion. I increased the cooking time of the chicken in the rice and broth to 45 minutes, and left the lid off the last 15-20 to reduce the amount of liquid. It was very tasty, not mushy, and the chicken was fully cooked and the liquid absorbed perfectly into the rice. Easy clean up and one large pan!

I'm a big fan of arroz con pollo and was excited to try a new recipe, but this didn't work out for me. I followed the recipe carefully, but the flavors just didn't combine the way they should for this dish.

I noticed that there was not enough liquid for the rice to sufficiently cook, so i added more wine and broth. overall, good recipe. I also added about a cup of mango/keylime salsa - wonderful!

I tripled the recipe as I was cooking for 15 people. I used drum sticks which was cheaper and made for great portioning. I substituted cilantro for paprika which gave it a Mexican feel rather than Spanish/Mediterranean. Since I was making a lot I didnt want to use to much white wine so I only used ½ white wine and ½ water. I did not use pimiento-stuffed green olives so that it wouldnt turn off any taste buds. I used ½ chicken broth and ½ chicken bouillon for affordability. If you are going to triple this recipe the final step will take about 25-30 minutes  not only 15 otherwise you will have undercooked rice. My rice was a little mushy  but I think that just came from stirring it  I should have let it rest after the initial boiling. This is a great find which I plan to use as one of my aces when having guests over. PS I love Spanish Saffron and so did all my guests.

To avoid mushy rice, I used long grain brown rice. Used fresh tomatoes and left out a little broth to compensate. Cooked for at least twice as long because of the brown rice (not sure how long - was watching the ball game) and meat fell off the bone tender (I used legs only). It was fantastic!

this recipe was a disaster! i take responsibility for two errors: cooking it in a le creuset dutch oven (as i'd cooked the last arroz con pollo recipe i made, with fabulous results) and putting in a little bit of extra broth after 15 mins, as the rice wasn't cooked through and there wasn't a ton of liquid left. in retrospect, i think the low-heat stovetop method would only work in a shallow saute pan; the dutch oven is best placed in the oven for more even heating. anyway, i followed the recipe except for substituting 1 tsp smoked paprika, using 2 cups broth, and 1 cup combined beer and pale dry sherry. the flavors were pretty nice. but after 15 mins neither the chicken or the rice was done, and after 20 minutes, most of the rice was mush (some wasn't even cooked) and the chicken was only nearly done. the flavors were OK, but consistency truly awful. if I were to make this again, in a saute pan, I'd use a firmer (medium-grain) rice, and/or convert the recipe to cook the chicken in the liquids for 20 minutes first, then add the rice and cook for 15-20 mins. in a dutch oven, i'd cook the chicken as above but then put the whole pot in the oven at about 350 for at least 20 minutes. the yummy recipe i used before, which came out far better, is here: http://www.williams-sonoma.com/recipe/chicken-with-saffron-rice.html

I made this in an electric skillet. I would cook the chicken a bit longer to ensure that it is done before setting aside and cooking onions and pepper. I also added a chopped jalapeno pepper to the onion for added zip. The green olives make this recipe in my opinion--do not omit them!

Rating: 0
It was really simple to make and tasted great. I did not have a 12" cast iron so I used a dutch oven-like non-stick and it still tasted great, but I had to cook a little longer. Putting the frozen peas at the end was genius as they were really green, tasty and not mushed up. When we served it we drizzled some olive oil on the rice. It was really good.

Rating: 3
I made it with quartered bone-in chicken breasts (skin on) and added more veggies than called for (including the olives). Adjusted the spices accordingly and added red pepper flakes because we like some kick. Made cuban bread and simple salad to go with. I might next time add some spicy spanish sausage if I have them on hand. That would be a nice variation. A solid 3 forks. Tasty and so easy I could do it drink and blindfolded... thankfully. ;)

I used half chicken half shrimp...I just added the raw shrimp when I added the cooked chicken. I thought this was ok, a little bland. My boyfriend liked it though. I think next time I would double up on the garlic, use a peas and carrot mix instead of just peas. Add some hot pepper powder to give it some kick. I also didn't use red pepper...I don't like cooked peppers.

Rather bland, especially the chicken. Also takes a fair amount of attention. Just wasn't really worth the hassle

I could not find saffron, so I followed the advice of another review and used turmeric. As other comments suggested I added more spice. I sprinkled skinless chicken with sharp paprika and used one tablespoon of smoked paprika instead of 2 teaspoons of regular paprika. Did not use the olives and used more broth than the recipe called for. It also took longer to cook than stated. With these changes this recipe is a keeper.

This reminds me of Americanized versions of paella that I have had. It's nothing really all that special as is but would probably be worth playing around with. I like one reviewers suggestion of using chipotle chiles instead of paprika.

A few reviewers thought this recipe lacked "zip". Consider stirring in Mexican Mole sauce (Mexican Chocolate + Mexican Cinnamon are the dominate flavors in Mole) in place of the Saffron. I used about 3 tablespoons of Mole. Mole is thick and a bit prone to burn, so add it toward the end and watch your moisture content the final moments of cooking. I prepare Chicken and Rice in a cast iron Dutch Oven, which gives a very even, diffuse heat to the contents and burning the Mole was NOT a problem. Mole is widely available. My local Wal-mart sells prepared Mole in sparsely populated Levy County. Buena suerte! JBS

I've been making this recipe for several years now, and it's easy and delicious. I use brown rice instead of white, which changes the cooking time, and sometimes I substitute veggie broth for the wine if I don't have any. Now that I've gone vegan, I use tofu instead of chicken, and it's still lovely.

Rating: 4
My fiance and I loved this recipe. I adjusted a bit. I left out the olives as I don't like them. Since I couldn't find saffron at my local grocery stores, I substituted 2 boxes of Goya Yellow Rice. Since this equals 2 1/2 cups of rice, I cut the chicken broth back to 1 cup. I didn't want the rice to turn out mushy. I also used chicken thighs for the chicken. I will definitely make this one again.

Try chipotle peppers in lieu of the smoked paprika. I always have a jar of those in the fridge, but rarely do I have smoked paprika on the shelf. They also add a little more kick ;)

I keep coming back to this recipe. I love it for the very reason that I treasure my first edition Joy of Cooking - it provides a great starting point that leaves lots of room for variation. I also love this recipe because it's so easy - basically you brown the chicken, soften the vegetables, then throw everything together to simmer. It makes a healthy, easy weeknight meal. I add cumin and red pepper flakes when I put in the saffron, and about 3/4 cup of chopped cilantro when I add the olives/pimento. Fabulous. Brought it to work for lunch and couldn't resist eating it by 10am.

Have made this several times with a few changes. I left out the olives, used 1/4c less wine to keep rice from getting mushy and used red/green & yellow peppers 1 1/2 total. Used 2 packages of Mahatma Saffron Rice instead of saffron and long grain rice. This was perfect and easy. Added cayenne to the chicken while cooking and also to the rice mixture. Gave it a nice kick. Have also added cooked spicy turkey sausage and/or shrimp with chicken. Everyone loves this dish.

Made this last night for friends. Had read all the reviews so I was prepared. I made in 2 large pans, used one for chicken (small cut up pieces of breast) and the other for shrimp and scallops, then mixed upon serving (seemed more like an easy paella). I kicked up the cayenne, needed additional liquid and salt and added red, yellow and orange peppers for color. Served with chopped green olives and cilantro on the side. Everyone loved it and my husband had 3rds.

This one was a hit out the park. I used Vigo saffron rice rather than purchasing saffron separately - made it a little too salty, so will try the same method next time but without adding salt. I will also add come chopped carrots and green pepper and cut back on the peas (not a big fan of them).

I have to say I was pretty unimpressed with this recipe. The taste was alright, but it took much longer than one hour to cook. I only used dark meat, which does take longer than white meat, but even after browning in the pan first, the chicken was not cooked through for a very long time. The taste is good, but not anything special or exciting.

For those who think the peas don't contribute anything, they are a traditional ingredient and add good color contrast. Spiciness can be added by those who like it. I use fresh chiles when I have them, cayenne when I don't. Don't forget to use salt. It makes all the difference between a flavorful dish and a bland one.

We stirred in some cooked, crumbled chorizo to boost the flavor - I think this would have been pretty bland without it. Unfortunately it did make it a little greasy. Not spectacular, but good enough that I'd give it another go.

It was alright, I even ordered the saffron on-line to make this recipe. Wasn't all I hoped it would be, I always order Arroz Con Pollo at this wonderful Mexican restaraunt by my Grandmother's house in Los Angeles, it is absolutely the best!!! I hoped to find a recipe that would equal it, but.... didn't happen! Although it wasn't what I hoped for, it still had an interesting taste to it. Just for the record it is also a popular Mexican dish as well as Cuban & Spanish. If you really want good food, you should try Mexican...Its the bomb!!!!

It was tasty, quick and easy. Will definitely make it again, incorporating the suggestions I've read here, i.e. shrimp and spicy sausage. Definitely needs a kick of some sort. Used a family pack of skinless chicken legs and 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes. I don't like olives so I left them out. TIP: Salt generously. I added a 1/4 tsp. after adding the wine and it wasn't nearly enough.

uhm.... paella? basically its the same recipe my (spanish) grandmother gave me. The only difference is the variations from each region in spain and the "paella pan" its cooked in. I thought it was almost as good except the olives made it a bit too salty. Threw in some shrimp, frozen calamari and mussels Ole!

A couple modifications, took the beer suggestion and added both yellow and red peppers which made the dish very pretty. Also cut chicken into bite size pieces which I think cooked better. My two suggestions- use a big pan because the dish dries out if the pan is small and add a LOT more spice. It's a bit bland without something extra.

Just made this tonight...I didn't have all the ingredients so compromised. Used fresh chopped tomato instead of canned, adjusted other liquids to compensate for the juices. Used chicken breast tenders instead of dark meat. Also did not have saffron on hand, but did have a package of the "Mahatma" yellow rice, so used that. Ashamed to admit, but used canned peas instead of frozen...the dish was great! Going to take a tip from another reviewer and add some chorizo next time. Reminds me of paella! Quick and easy too! Hubby loved it...said it was better than the arroz con pollo his dad used to make. (Now, that's a compliment!)

You have given the correct prep. method for spanish rice dishes, but in almost all of your spanish rice dishes you include tomatoes and the juice. they should not be used in spanish rice dishes especially when using saffron. Tomatoes seem to mask the flavor of saffron and other flavor fragrants absorbed by the rice as well as give the rice a pasty taste.

We enjoyed this dish very much. I used skinless thighs on the bone as they are less likely to dry out. I tried the beer as suggested-good tip. I think the paprika is a key ingredient-I used 1 teaspoon of good Hungarian paprika plus one teaspoon of smoked Spansh paprika. Also a bit of cayenne for zip. 30 minutes cooked everything just right-garnish with chopped cilantro. I think that sometimes people aren't thrilled with a recipe because they don't taste and adjust the seasonings to their taste. A little bit of salt and pepper added at the end can really bring out the complexity of flavours that make a dish interesting-not salty! Anyways this dish was very tasty- Its even better reheated the next day.

Rating: 3
A distinctly flavored dish that we enjoyed a lot. I read some of the other reviews and think this could be a disappointing dish to some -- you have to really like the flavors in the recipe (ie: saffron, olives, cilantro) to like this meal as those flavors are distinct and strong. I didn't have enough paprika, so I added some red pepper and it added a very interesting "kick" to the dish that we all enjoyed. It did take me longer to get the rice to the appropriate level of done ness than the recipe states (15 minutes is a joke!!), and I agree with other reviewers -- I used a big paella pan and it ended up being too small. I will make this again, but will probably use chicken breasts (faster cook time) and will again use the red pepper/paprika blend. I think the suggestion of adding chorizo is a good one -- probably will try that next time.

Rating: 3
Great way to rev up chicken and rice. Regarding the pan issue, I used a six quart saute pan, and everything fit fine. I had the opposite problem than some reviewers-- at the end of cooking time, my rice was cooked but my chicken was not. I ended up fishing out the pieces and finishing them off in the oven. Regardless, this was fast and easy, and I would make it again. The rice was especially good.

This recipe has become a staple in my family. Once you have the ingredients handy, it comes together quickly which makes a great one dish dinner for a busy mom with four teenagers and a husband to feed.

This recipe was GREAT! I've been looking for arroz con pollo that taste like it came from a Cuban restaurant I love and this is it. Like most reviewers, I also made some revisions: used boneless chicken thighs, beer instead of wine, and Goya Sazon instead of Saffron. It still came out wonderful.

We loved this as an off the beaten steak and potatoe track, fun dish for (the right kind of) company. Though, I had to last minute improvise the finish. I used 8 boneless chicken brests and along with 2 cups of rice and all those vegatables; no frying pan is going to be nearly big enough to finish this dish on the stove top. I combined the rice, veggies, and liquids and spread in a lasagna pan and placed the chicken brests on top. Bake at 350 for at least 40 minutes to get rice done. Next time, I will nestle the chicken down into the rice and liquids deeper so they remain juicier in the baking. Also, though the recipe uses a dry white wine, I thought with the rich tomato, paprika and saffron favors; it served better with a Reisling or favorful Rose.

Really terrific; tasted like a dish at my local Spanish restaurant. I added a bit of cayenne (1/4 t) and an extra can of tomatoes for more juice.

The rice needed longer to cook than the recipe said so I'd also add more broth or tomato juice.

Made this recipe and it's great! I didn't have all of the ingredients, so I substituted beer for the wine. In place of the saffron and rice, I used prepackaged and preseasoned yellow rice with water in place of the chicken broth. It made everything much easier to purchase and prepare. We needed a larger pot than the one this recipe calls for -- be careful!

Fantastic comfort food. I used about half the amount of chicken and added a pound of smoked beef sausage. I browned the sausage in the skillet first to remove some of the fat, drained the fat and browned the chicken andfollowed the recipe from there. The leftovers made great lunches for work. Next time I may try the beer substitution other reviewers recommend.

Very similar to my Panamanian version. The chicken is browned, simmered with tomato, broth, and seasonings. Then the rice is 'fried' in hot oil for a bit, and the liquid is added. After the rice has cooked for a while, add chicken, peas, olives, and some capers. If you want more character, add a little hot pepper sauce, or cook a hot pepper for a while with the chicken. Lots of zing, and a great a buffet dish if you bone out the chicken. In fact, the chicken can be cooked the day before if you want to; very handy for feeding a crowd!

Before de comunism took over my country the Cuban families used to have this dish at least once a week. You need to cook the rice a little longer as you can see in the picture the rice looks half done and instead of wine we use beer.

I am going to make this recipe tonight but wanted to let the cook from Tehachpi, CA know that depending on how spicy the dish is, balance it with a fruitier wine. If this dish is only mildly spicy, I would suggest an albarino from Spain - crisp, high acid, fruity. On the same wavelength, I am also seeing some very food friendly wines from Portugal that are very inexpensive. If this dish is VERY spicy, go for a reisling or if that's too sweet - a dry gerwertztaminer. Try to stay in the home country (wine-wise) that the dish is from - they're much better at pairing food and wine and probably have something that I don't know about that would match this dish perfectly. Avoid anything oak aged if you are truly interested in bringing out the best qualities of the wine. PS- Made it last nite - very good - used parboiled rice instead of regular and it cooked perfectly. Also used the smoked paprika suggested - very spicy but good.

My husband and I made this for the first time a couple of days ago and both liked it very much. We didn't use a whole chicken, since it was just for the two of us, but instead bought a couple of bone-in breasts, a thigh, and two drumsticks. We had copious leftovers, so maybe next time we will just make it with the bone-in chicken breasts, and skip the rest. I also had to cook the mixture longer so that the liquid would be reduced. All in all, though, a very tasty and relatively easy meal.

This is in response to the cook in Ocean Grove, NJ. To avoid mushiness I suggest using Uncle Ben's Rice which is a firm rice. Also avoid constant stirring of the dish since this will allow the starch to be released from the rice. Another suggestion is to use less liquid. For example for 1 cup of rice instead of using 2 cups water use 1 3/4 cups water.
