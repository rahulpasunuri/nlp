This is a good recipe. I've made it several times. It's easy and tastes better the second day. As many reviewers note, the heat in this dish can vary greatly, depending on the red curry paste you use. I always double the amount called for in this recipe. Even so, it's sometimes too mild. When that happens, I just add some cayenne pepper. It will spice the dish up without changing its flavor. Also, the tofu should probably be cooked a little longer than 4 minutes.

Brilliant recipe, have made again and again for people. I usually use, if I can, marinated tofu for extra flavour and have had to replace fresh basil with dry (still delicious)! I usually pair it with the recipe for coconut rice also on Epicurious.

I was really excited for this recipe, but it ended up being terribly bland. I added some more curry paste and salt in hopes of more flavor. In fact, the rice I had with it had more flavor.

We make it with smoked tofu and coconut cream (instead of milk). It's absolutely brilliant! We make it again and again and never get tired of it. Obviously the quality of the ingredients is key, so don't expect to get good food if you use, e.g., cheap ass curry paste.

My hubby was craving Thai tonight so I made this. Delish! I used half the coconut milk and used some Old Fashioned peanut butter since I didn't have peanut oil. We upped the Thai curry paste since we like things more spicy. Served over oriental wheat noodles. Loved it!

This recipe needed much more flavor--I would up the among of curry paste used and also add some more soy sauce/salt and garlic. The sauce was a good consistency, but even after a few days it wasn't as good as many of the other tofu recipes on this website.

The sauce was indeed a little thin, but I liked it quite a bit. The leftovers were awesome (the sauce got thicker). Also, the next weekend I went out for Thai food and ordered something almost exactly like this. I was more impressed with this recipe after that :)

The other commenters are right about how thin the sauce is. I used half a can (200 ml) of lite coconut milk and I still had to thicken the sauce (used a tablespoon of rice flour, sprinkled on top so as not to clump up) and that worked really well.

I LOVE this recipe I make it often. Definitely have to add some fish sauce after the curry. And I use more peanut oil to fry the Tofu longer so it gets nice and brown with lots of flavor.

Too much lime, and I love lime. Sauce too thin. Ginger did not cook in the amount of time allotted. Flavors did not blend

very bland even with more salt and lime. we started calling it "slop"

To make this even easier, I substitute veggies with a bag of frozen "Greens of Envy" from Trader Joe's (combo of spinach, edamame, broccoli, asparagus and green beans). Quick and very good.

This was so easy, quick and delicious. Will make it often.

I enjoyed this very much. I used Japanese eggplant and green beans in place of the zucchini since I can't buy it in my area. Also, I did not want to vegetables to become very soft so I let the tofu marinate in the sauce for a couple minutes and then added the vegetables, letting them simmer until they were cooked to my liking. Not only did this make for tasty veggies, it also allowed the sauce to become nice and thick. I served with coconut ginger rice.

I give this 4 forks in regards to being one of my favorite weeknight recipes. The fish sauce and a good red curry paste add to a more authentic flavor. I love that this recipe incorporates tofu and vegetables (things I'm always trying to eat more of), is so quick and easy to make, and is really tasty (modify as needed with extra lime, chili garlic sauce, etc. as noted by other reviewers, also versatile in terms of types of vegetables, I always add yellow squash . . .).

I liked this recipe because it's quick and simple. I thought the sauce had a really great tangy taste to it and I didn't need to add salt or pepper at all. However, I felt that I had way too much sauce and I wished it had thickened more. I served it over basmati rice and that soaked up a good deal of it. I would make this again, but with 1/2 c coconut milk instead.

My family liked this and they're all meat eaters. It has a little kick to it, needs salt, but very satisfying, healthy and quick. Served it with coconut rice. Will make again and again, but probably wouldn't make for company.

This is a terrific, tasty recipe, even if it's not "authentic" Thai. It needs more lime than 3T, though, and I also added minced garlic. I used the full tin of coconut milk and, following another reviewer's suggestion, used fish sauce instead of soy sauce. The flavours are subtle, not overwhelming, and blend beautifully. Plus, the recipe is so versatile - you can use whatever veggies you like! (I found sugarsnap peas worked really well.)

this dish has become a staple in our house. it's a generous portions without it being too heavy - and we appreciate the quickness of the preparation - great for a weekday. and definitely all the flavors are right on.

I liked it, family so so on it. I did not have red curry paste so I used various spices. Otherwise followed recipe exactly. It did not thicken much; not sure if curry paste would have thickened it. I liked the flavour, pleasantly sweet and mild touch of soy, but others found milky tofu and cooked veggies a bit odd. Not the best, but a starting point.

smelled wonderful, but tasted too acidic. i don't know that i'd make this recipe again, but if i were to, i'd increase the coconut milk, add garlic, and decrease the lime (3 tbsp. is far too much--the lime drowned out the other, more delicate flavors). also, my sauce never thickened! a disappointment.

Contrary to previous reviewers, I rather liked this dish. I also wouldn't describe it as bland, although its flavors weren't super-strong and assertive. Rather it had a plesant combination of tastes from the lime juice, basil, ginger, and curry paste. I made this as written, except for substituting light soy sauce and light coconut milk for the regular versions of these ingredients, and served it over rice.

Just one look at the list of ingredients would tell you that this couldn't be very interesting. What do you expect from a so-called "Thai" recipe that contains no onions or garlic? Not to mention lemon grass or chiles. It's just gotta be bland.

Bland...don't bother.

I cook Thai often and this dish is just missing a few key ingredients . First, I used Thai Basil and roasted red curry (doubled the amount). I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar and about 2 teaspoons of fish sauce. I totally agree with the reviewer who added chili/garlic sauce--I threw in about a tablespoon but if you don't like it hot you can just add garlic. I think this recipe also misleads the reader in the cookign process. I removed the veggies once they started to get soft and then made the sauce with just the tofu. Once the sauce had thickened I added in the veggies and served immediately to keep the veggies from becoming too soft.

I sort of made the recipe as directed but then had to alter it. As the first reviewed stated it was "just ok". I was looking for a bit more zip and spice so I added chili garlic sauce to it for zip and doubled the red curry paste. I also added a bit more lime then as well. I had high hopes for it as it sounded so good - but this one will not make the repeat recipe list. Oh, I also added sliced mushrooms, and the red pepper and green zucchini make it a beautufl dish filled with color.

I would like to read a review of this recipe cooked exactly as written. It seems to have great Thai flavours, but I missed the boat. My rating also must be taken with a grain of salt as my results were "ehhh", BUT I feel I made too many week night substitutions in trying to make this quick and easy: Substituted lemon juice for lime juice, substituted blanched green beans for red bell pepper, substituted vegetable oil for peanut and omitted the basil. Two cooking tips I can provide: Fish sauce should be substituted for the soy sauce. Make sure to dissolve red curry paste in a small amount of coconut milk and then add that quantity to the srit-fry as a whole. A little dab of curry rarely penetrates a whole pot adequately in my opinion and you get more watery coconut flavor than curry.
