I too was very dissapointed in the texture of these cookies although the flavor was nice. I bit into them not expecting them to be "cakey" so, at first, I thought I had done something wrong...and then I read the reviews. I made them for my boyfriend and he also did not like them. He thought they tasted like oatmeal sponge cake. I wish I would have read the reviews first, as I usually do.

Horrible! These were like cake with flecks of oats and didnt resemble oatmeal cookies at all. I would not recommend making these if you love plain old oatmealraisin cookies. Very disappointing and would never make again.

I made significant changes to this recipe, but they resulted in a scrumptious delight. My only problem is rationing the family! I've never made so many changes but thanks to all the reviews they pointed my way to a better cookie. First, I used only 2 Cups of raisins, then I increased the butter to 1 3/4 sticks. I ran out of vanilla, so I used a tsp of vanilla powder that I happened to have on hand. I used 2 1/2 cups of flour, but 1/4 cup was whole wheat flour. Several people had mentioned that these cookies were "cakey", so I decided to omit the 1/2 tsp of Baking Powder. Also I chose to use the chocolate chips and substituted pecans for walnuts. The result as I already said, was delicious. The cookies were so filled with raisins, pecans, and chocolate chips that it seemed like the only reason there was any batter was to glue together the many goodies. Needless to say, these are not your typical refined oatmeal cookies, rather they have a rugged texture. As other reviewers have remarked, it was vital to not only tap down the batter, but to be sure that it all stuck together. The cookies don't spread, so it depends on your spoon "workmanship" to glue all the separate pieces together. I'm sure they would be still tasty if you decreased or omitted the raisins, nuts, or chocolate chips to suit your taste. I considered adding coconut, to the recipe, but didn't due to impassioned pleas by my husband. Next time however...

Great Cookie, Good recipe too. I think i will try some Cranberries instead of raisins just for fun and see what happens on the next batch. Thanks a lot from a cookie monster.

These are excellent cookies. The spicing is well-balanced. My kids are picky and announced that they would only eat chocolate chip cookies. Well, that was before I took these out of the oven.

The flavor was good, the I used less than half of the raisins recommended and that was more than enough. Also, the consistency of the cookie was very cake-like. I usually like a chewey cookie so this recipe was disappointing.

Very moist and wonderful flavor. I do like a little more cookie dough in my cookie, though. These might better be called "raisin cakes". If you like LOTS of raisins, this is definitely a good recipe.

These were the best oatmeal cookies I have ever made! I have never before cooked the raisins and it makes such a difference to the taste of the cookies!

An excellent cookie recipe. The spices were well balanced, and the blend was delicious. I would highly recommend this one.

A nice, almost "traditional" oatmeal raisin cookie, taste-wise. This recipe produces a somewhat "cakey" cookie that does not spread much. It has a very well-balanced taste (and I was generous in my measurement of the cinnamon and cloves). Personally, I prefer a chewy cookie, but my mom loved this. MY NOTES: The boiling water will not cover all the raisins, so be sure to stir them every 10 min. or so to make sure that they all plump evenly. I let them soak for the 30 min, but I barely got 1/3 C of liquid from draining them. I omitted the nuts and the prunes/chocolate chips. I ended up with a very wet batter (it seemed way to wet for cookies), but the cookies baked up fine (and quite moist). When I flattened the cookies as directed, then the baking time (for me) was about 9 - 11 minutes and I did need to let them cool on the cookie sheet before removing them. However, if you do NOT flatten them (which I neglected to do the first time, since I wasn't paying enough attention to the directions), the cookies will still turn out fine, but they will take closer to 11 - 13 minutes, but you can remove them off the cooky sheet immediately. <> Oh, one more thing -- this recipe makes a TON of cookies. Next time, unless I am cooking for an army, I will probably try cutting it in half.
