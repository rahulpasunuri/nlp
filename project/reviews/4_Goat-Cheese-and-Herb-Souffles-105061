Perfect, puffy and flavorful. Made for a brunch and will make again!

These didn't have the puff, the drama, of most souffles I make. That's mainly because my dishes were 1-cup rather than the 3/4-cup capacity specified. They tasted wonderful. But my husband didn't think there was enough, so next time I'll make it for 4 instead of 6 people. That way I can continue to use my 1-cup dishes.

Excellent recipe, and comes out perfectly every time. I have found that the cooking time is usually closer to 30 minutes rather than 20.

These are hands-down the best souffles I've ever tasted. I even made them with only egg whites (subbing 3 whites for 3 yolks) and I was still bowled over. I thought about skipping the red onion as I'm not a big onion fan, but it added a wonderful layer of flavor to the dish. The souffles browned beautifully, and they were so good that one wasn't enough! I'm going to try reducing the cheese to lower the amount of fat for my next batch. I've made a lot of savory souffles and this one makes the top of the list.

doubled the recipe for 12 persons, made it couple of hours ahead to time and ended with excellent results. Every one love it. and easy to make on top!

This makes a wonderful main course for a brunch. It is also a lovely first course. I've made it several times and always get rave reviews!

These were just great. Yes, they fell immediately after taking out of oven, but the taste was wonderful. I had some extra cheddar cheese on hand so I used a mixture of about half cheddar/half goat cheese. Perfect.

This tasted great. My only concern with the recipe was that just dumping the egg/milk mixture into the butter/flour will scramble the eggs, so it needs to be tempered or taken off the heat. I guess overall, this is just a more advanced recipe than most on this site.

I've made this several times; each time more successful that the last. I finally bought a copper bowl to beat the egg whites which helped give the souffle more of a rise. The first few attempts, while not as dramatic as the picture, were delicious. It's now a staple as is versitle enough to be a main dish or as a first or second course.

This is definitely a keeper! I used white onion, more thyme, and 6 oz. of Montrachet and the flavor was fantastic.

My friend and I made this dish together as a starter dish of a five course meal. We had some difficulty stiffening the egg whites, and had to try several times. The outcome was not at all like the picture, but it was still very good. Be very careful not to overbeat the egg whites, and be sure to use a mixer and watch very carefully. I will definitely try it again.
