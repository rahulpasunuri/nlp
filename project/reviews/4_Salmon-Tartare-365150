I liked this, but I modified it to more like a ceviche served on toasted baguette. I added both cherry tomatoes and some avocados, mixed in a bit of wasabi instead of the jalapeno for a little kick. Then I put a bit of Japanese mayo on top. If I were making it for guests, I'll probably just mix it to wasabi mayo to top for better presentation. Great recipe though!

I made the recipe almost to the word served with garlic crostini. I found the taste needed to be rounded out a little so I added a little mayo to mellow and sweeten a little, I will definitely do that again. Reminds me a little of Tuna Poke in Hawaii. Maybe some capers and tomatoes will be added next time...

I may never cook salmon again after making this exceptional recipe. I made it on a whim and thus lacked several ingredients. Substituting onion and garlic for chives and shallot, adding more black pepper to compensate for the lack of jalapeno, and increasing the quantities of all ingredients relative to the salmon made a delectable dish. I thought it was improved by adding soy sauce and diminishing salt. I ate it in true tartare style, with no crackers or chips. Yum, yum, yum.

I didn't think this was a crazy amount of prep work and the final results was really delicious. I don't even like cilantro and I really enjoyed this dish - I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

Does anyone know if this can be made a day ahead? I'd like to make it for my husband's 50th bday party but am worried about the amount of prep and will probably need to do it the day before.

Great recipe. Lot of prep work but worth it. Nice flavors, textures, pretty much stuck to the recipe. Will definitely make this again

Delicious, easy and very quick. We even forgot to add the sesame oil and it was still very tasty! Served it on rice crackers instead of chips. Definitely will make it again!

Delicious and simple. The flavors work well together the cucumbers and ginger give it a nice fresh taste.
