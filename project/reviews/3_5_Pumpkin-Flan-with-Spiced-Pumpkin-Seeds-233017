P.S. Some reviewers asked about how to remove the pan from the water bath safely. I put the oven rack in the lower third of the oven and removed the unused rack so I could reach in and lift out the casserole dish (it has handles...) without having to pull the rack out and possibly slosh hot water. Once the flan was removed, the water level in the bath was low enough that I could comfortably lift the pan (using both handles) without risk of spillage (or you can wait for it to cool, then remove). To fill the water bath, I used a large measuring cup to pour the water in after the flan was already in place inside the oven within the larger pan.

I've never made a flan before, so I was a little nervous about preparing this for Thanksgiving dessert. I used an oval 2-qt ceramic casserole and cooked for an extra 15 mins (until the knife came out clean). Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It came out perfectly and was delicious -- like a crustless pumpkin pie. Excellent with or without the pumpkin seeds on top.

This was really good. I made some changes based on my flan experience. I took about half cup sugar, placed it on a Pyrex pan and melted the sugar stirring until caramelized. Then carefully swirled the melted sugar around holding the pan with oven mitts until it was fully covered. You need to make sure to place the pan with water in the oven before you start the recipe as the water needs to be hot before you place the flan in the oven. I added one more egg and one more yolk and also increased the vanilla a bit. I also cover the Pyrex pan while it cooks in the oven. It is like a cross between a pumpkin pie with no crust and a flan.

This is without a doubt one of the most delicious and unique desserts I have had in a long while. So much better than boring old pumpkin pie! It's really easy to make and looks beautiful.

I would also decrease the sugar a bit, however, this dessert is a winner. I baked it in a bundt pan which gave a stunning presentation - try to avoid pooling of the caramel in the bottom of the pan while it is hardening which will preserve the shape of the mold while baking. Chill as long as possible before inverting and for an extra precaution, dip the baking container in a warm water bath for a few seconds. Why are there complaints about the amount of caramel?! Serve the flan with some sliced fruit (I used papaya) and use it for that or just eat it as it is -

To by adiabunny from Toronto, ON: As with any flan, you MUST cool it completely, then unmold. It'll set while it cools.

Love this recipe and get raves when I make it....I once forgot to put the pumpkin in and it still worked! :-)

This is totally fabulous, can't wait to bring it to Thanksgiving dinner. I'd never made flan, but craving pumpkin, decided to try it. No whole milk in the house, so used about 3/4 c. 1 percent and 1/4 c. half and half. I also added a dash of cloves along with the other spices, that's my grandma's trick that I always follow for pumpkin desserts. I also didn't have pumpkin seeds, so served with a dollop of whipped cream. It unmolded beautifully as soon as I inverted the pan, the liquid released fine. I covered leftovers with foil, and it was actually more flavorful the second day. Can't get much better than that for a do-ahead holiday dessert. Oh, one other thing, I plan to try adding the gingersnap crust from the other recipe on this site. The texture and flavor of this filling recipe seems superior to the others, but adding the crust might be interesting, too. Try it, if you like pumpkin, you'll love this one.

I made this recipe for thanksgiving last year. I love pumpkin flavor, but don't typically enjoy the crust so I thought this would be a great try. It was a overwhelming hit! I still get told that this was the best dessert people have ever tried.

I just made this recipe thinking it was like the flan that we are familiar with...well after 2 1/2 hours in the oven, the knife came out clean, but when I inverted it, it all collapsed and was still raw...so I tried to put it back in the pan and back in the oven..not sure if it will work. Extremely disappointed.

Wonderful taste, but had a little issue with weeping. A great substitute for pumpkin pie, so I think I will try it again. Made it today for a gluten free moms group, and they all loved it.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was wonderful. Everyone loved it. I think the pumpkin seeds, took it over the top. At first I was hesitant to use them, then decided what the heck, they were made, why not? Well, I am glad that I did. It was all anyone could talk about. Happy day! I love it when you try something new and it works so well. The only thing I would say is that it took me much longer to bake, about 1 1/2 hours or so, for the knife to come out clean. I didn't panic, I just waited until it came out clean. So, heads up. Give it a try, you won't regret it.

This recipe was superb...tasted even better two days later. I'm surprised the ratings were closer to 100%, its a fantastic, easy recipe.

Delicious - everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved this. I made individual flans in ramekins rather than one big one but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Only problem I had was that most of the caramel hardened and stuck to the ramekins when I unmolded them! It was fine b/c I think there was too much caramel anyway, but I'd love to know if there's a trick to getting the caramel to stay pourable.

I think some people are making the water bath WAY harder than it needs to be, simply pull your dish from the water bath, don't try to remove the water bath from the oven until it's cool. I would strongly recommend NOT pulling the whole thing at once - those kinds of burns are no fun.

My advice on removing finished dish from the water bath. I used individual ramikins which are easily removed with a strong pair of tongs. I would think you might be able to remove the larger version with a pair of super heavy duty rubber gloves? The real, real, heavy and thick ones you buy at the hardware store? With an old towel? Or the Maui Ca writer idea is good too...take out the water with turkey baster, but seems like a lot of time in front of a very hot oven....and the water only needs to go half way up on the dish. Pour it in once dish is in pan.

My suggestion to avoid getting water on yourself or on the beautiful flan. Put the pans on the rack in your oven then with a large liquid measuring cup fill it with water per recipe. Then as you are opening the oven to take out your finished flan use the same method you using the laddle or a turkey baster. Hopefully you will eliminate any further burns as some writers commented on here. This recipe is sure to be a favorite of mine, family and friends! Smiles always!!!

I had really high hopes for this. I would agree that the texture is fabulous but it is dreadfully sweet . . . and that is just so overpowering it ruins it. There was at least twice as much caramel as was necessary and the flan itself had too much sugar.

There is a character in a children's cartoon who makes Pumpkin Souffle Flambe Brulee and this is what I was requested to make by my 4 yo son. This recipe was an excellent approximation, and was enjoyed by all. The texture was perfectly smooth, the flavor delicious, and oh, yeah, it was really easy. My first flan, and it was perfect. I didn't make the seeds, but served it with slightly sweetened fresh whipped cream (had to do something with the left over 1/2 C cream!).

Really good! I was looking for an alternative to pumpkin pie, that wouldn't leave people missing pumpkin pie for thanksgiving! Everyone loved this- the spiced pumpkins seeds were a great texture and flavor contrast. It was even good the next morning with coffee (always an important characteristic for a Thanksgiving dessert!) I will definitely make this again!

This was a great option for our Thanksgiving because I needed a gluten-free dessert for a relative with celiac's. He really appreciated this one. I thought that it tasted almost like regular pumpkin pie, so I'm not sure I'd make it again but I certainly enjoyed eating it. I loved munching the spiced pumpkin seeds plain!

Rating: 3
The presentation on this is beautiful. I had to sit the ramekins (I did 8 small rather than 1 large) in a hot water bath to get them to release; but, the melted caramel was beautiful. For my taste buds, it's waaay overkill on the sugar. I would usually only 1/2 cup next time. I would also cut back a little bit on the spices. For a composed dessert, a shard of nougatine sticking out the top, some creme fraiche and a ginger cookie would be stunning!

I have made the Pumpkin Flan (Gourmet Nov 05) for 3 Thanksgivings now, and always dread the part where I take it out of the water bath at the end. Pulling out the oven rack with hot water threatening to slosh into the flan-or me-is just really stressful. Is there any secret trick to getting a dish out of the water bath without burning yourself or soaking your potholders in the process? I am getting ready to put this on my menu again, and would love any tips from anyone out there...Before you tell me to forget the flan, think again. It's just too good!

Very dense and not a true flan texture. Maybe I will make it again with less pumpkin. It got a few nods at my Halloween Party.

OK, this is really really delicious. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of cream + milk and skipped the pumpkin seeds; otherwise followed the recipe. Probably important not to skip the sieve step as it ensures the most amazing creamy texture. There's a sliver left in the fridge but it's calling my name. Made it for my grateful book club and will likely make it for family for Thanksgiving. Used (organic) canned pumpkin and it was perfectly fine.

LOVED IT...the spiced pumpkin seeds were a big hit. in the flan part I changed it up a bit by using 1/2 cup condensed milk and than 2 cups 5% cream and than I cut down on the sugar used a bit less than 3/4 cup (I did misread and put the sugar with the milk mixture) but it worked.

Differently delicious. I followed the recipe to the letter except for the pumpkin seeds (can't find them in my area). I served it at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it -- even some who don't like the traditional flan texture. The texture on this version is velvety smooth (from the pumpkin I guess). I made it again on the last night of Hanukah (to share with some friends) and, again, a big hit. Love this dessert and it's so easy to make. Will make it for my husband with the spicy seeds whenever I can find the seeds.

This was a huge hit at our family dinner. I omitted the pumpkin seeds. To make the caramel I added 2 TBSP. corn syrup and 1/4 tsp. lemon juice. It worked perfectly. I also used fresh pumpkin from a pumpkin I had baked and pureed. This was so good I cannot wait to make it again.

More that anything I was a bit disappointed in the tecture. It's really not flan custard, it's more between cheese cake and custard. It is tasty and full of pumpkin flavor. My guess seemed to like it, but I wouldn'd say they raved about it. Not sure if I'll make it again.

I made this recipe for a brunch and it was very easy to make the night before. Be sure to fully cool it before you chill it though, otherwise the caramel tends to stick to the dish. Big hit though and would definitely make it again!

This recipe was a hit at the office (I made it for a coworker's birthday). I myself would have put a little less pumpkin in so that the creamy texture of the flan could come through a little more. But I'd definitely make this recipe again.

YUM! I opted not to make the seeds - I like the silky smooth texture of flan - and didn't want to disrupt that with a crunch. I made this for Thanksgiving for my family and everyone loved it. The second they were served and started eating - the whole table got silent as they made little 'happy' food noises! I made it again for Christmas with my fiancee's family - and got the same response. Highly recomended. The directions are nearly perfect (adjusting cooking time as all ovens are a bit different.) I've made traditional flan before - so the thickness of this prior to baking was a bit odd for me - it's got all that pumpkin pulp in it. But don't worry - it works just pefect. Enjoy!

This desset is absolutely fabulous. I omitted the nutmeg as I don't care for its flavour, and also the pumpkin seeds on top. The flan has a very creamy texture and delicate flavour and I would liken it to a heavy creme caramel. I found the cooking time to be exact. This is an excellent dessert to serve after a heavy meal. The raves were many!! I will be making this again for sure.

I didn't make the seeds - but the flan won absolute raves at our dinner party. It has a very creamy texture and the pumpkin added a very nice flavor. It did take a little longer to set than the recipe had suggested. I will definitely be making this again.

I will definitely do this again. Very tasty. BUT I will make a double recipe and put it all in the 2 quart heavy saucepan. If this turns out more to my expectation regarding presentation, I will resubmit and rank it a 4 forks!

I only made this since one of my guests was going to bring a sweet potato pie, rendering pumpkin pie a bit redundant, but I am glad I did! The flavor is very similar to pumpkin pie, but the added interest of the seeds and absence of crust made it a bit more unusual. Would definitely make again (and the friend ended up bring store-bought (!) sweet potato pie that was just awful.)

This was great! It tastes like pumpkin pie without the crust. I did, however, find that it took almost 2 hours to cook instead of the 75 minutes shown in the recipe. Keep that in mind if you are making it the day you plan to serve it.

Rating: 3
Wonderful! I totally disagree with the comments that this is just a pumpkin pie without the crust. It's WAY better. The creamy texture really makes it, and especially the caramel flavor. I would recommend, though, that if you really want it to look like the picture, let it chill for at least a full day so that it fully sets. Otherwise it'll slump a bit after unmolding. I also think the flavors meld better after a day in the fridge. Also, trust that it's done after 75 minutes and pull that sucker out, even if it looks a little jiggly. It'll finish setting as it cools and chills.

Loved the seeds on top, and the final product looked beautiful, but tasted suspiciously like one other reviewer described-- pumpkin pie filling without the pie. Not a big hit with the guests.
