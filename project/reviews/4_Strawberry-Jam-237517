Terrific jam but the Campari really makes it special as it balances out the sugar and provides depth to the flavor. If you're not going to use the Campari I'd cut the sugar by at least half a cup.

I made this without the Campari since I didn't have any on hand. I reduced the sugar by 1/2 cup and I still thought this was too sweet. It resembled Smucker's far too closely for my taste. I have another recipe for the same item and I'll be sticking with that one. In fairness I should say that my roommate loved it.

I had super-ripe berries from the farmers' market so I reduced the amount of sugar by 1/4-1/3 of a cup. I also used Meyer lemon juice (it's what I had) and so I used the zest from those at the end and vermouth because I didn't have Campari - still delicious. I would love to try this with the orange and Campari, though!

I don't like overly sweet dishes so I used half the sugar, substituted more lemon juice for water and used Port instead of Campari. I used this to top plain Greek yogurt...delicious!

Delicious. Very simple. The lemon brightens the flavor up. I replaced the Campari with port to no harm.

Like the previous reviewer, I picked some local strawberries and decided to try something from epicurious. This was a really easy recipe to make. I threw in orange and a tiny bit of lemon zest. I didn't have campari so I put in a little bit of vermouth. I thought it made the taste richer without making it taste like "alcohol." Yummy!

I bought very ripe local strawberries yesterday and needed a fast recipe to conserve them. This is quick and amazingly simple with tons of taste. I really like the orange zest added at the end.I did half the recipe and excluded Compari since I had none on hand. I will try the panna cotta that goes with it later this week.
