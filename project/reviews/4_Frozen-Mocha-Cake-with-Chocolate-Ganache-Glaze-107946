This is absolutely delicious. I did use a few shortcuts: I used a Betty Crocker box cake mix because I was crunched for time. I baked this in a square springform pan and cut in half horizontally. As another reader pointed out, raw eggs are used, but are safe if heated over simmering water to 140 degrees; instead, look for Davidson's Safe Eggs which are pasteurized eggs in the shell--a wonderful product, especially for these desserts. Feel free to use SafeEggs raw egg whites without heating--another time saver. I did double the ganache recipe and assembled it as another reader suggested: spread it over the top of the assembled cake; freeze until firm. Pour remaining chocolate ganache over the top, allowing it to run over the sides and freeze again. The square shaped cake easily served 20. Great for a crowd.

Be aware this recipe uses raw egg whites. Definitely a winning recipe - everyone loved it! Flavor and texture were wonderful. It's critical to chose a quality chocolate for the ganache, with preferably 70% cacao. Also I increased the Kahlua in the ganache a bit over 1/3 cup, a good move. For the cake and filling, I used a sweeter 60% cacao and followed the recipe exactly. As others have stated, the top will be glossy if the final application of ganache is performed quickly while warm and you let it spill over the edge (just using the spatula for that part). As long as you use parchment paper and let the cake fully cool for an hour, it's not that hard to get it out of the pan - I don't know why others questioned the value of the two cake layers - they were tasty and perfectly proportioned as written in the recipe. I liked the coffee beans as-is, a nice bitter crunchy compliment to the sweetness of the ganache. I will definitely make this again. It's complex but not difficult and active time is about one hour - the rest is wait time while it freezes and sets.

My boyfriend and I made this cake for my birthday and it was so amazing! Since his family hates the taste of coffee, we decided to add different flavors to it such as instead of Kahlua for the filling, we used french vanilla. Instead of Kahlua again for the ganache, we used vanilla. The cake layers were seriously melt-in-your-mouth! I can't describe it any other way. As reviewers said, they are thin, but they're not thin like talking. They're about 3 inches thick but it does go great with the cake! The filling tastes like wannabe ice cream and mousse combined. It is very rich! In the process of making it, you're going to make your own home made whip cream and a marshmallow-like texture! I used dark chocolate for the layers, chocolate chips in the filling and the ganache. The dark chocolate for the ganache somehow turned to milk chocolate and the vanilla didn't really bring out much flavor. The chocolate over-powered it. The ganache also wasn't extremely hard like chocolate flakes or on other cakes I had tried. I was bummed about that. =[ It was semi-hard and soft. There's another recipe for ganache that I should have used that would make it hard like it's supposed to be. Overall, it's a very rich cake but it's a good cake! The coffee flavor would have made it really yummy, too! Also, you do need to double the ganache!!

I really enjoyed the filling part of this recipe (it would get 3.5 forks by itself), however I was disappointed with both the cake and the glaze. Despite following the recipe, the cake came out dry and tasteless. The glaze tasted good, but was too heavy for the lighter texture of the filling. In future, I may make this with a different bottom cake layer and no top layer and simply drizzle the top with some of the glaze. Or I may just make the filling.

Rarely do I re-rate a recipe but this is worth it. Make it the one time and it gets easier. I now make it in little individual servings (Norpro Mini Cheeesecake pan). Once frozen I pop them out and smooth the sides and top (no top cake layer) with a knife I dip in warm/hot water. I Jackson Pollock the sauce on the dessert plates, place my frozen thimble in the middle and just before serving, pour a generous amount of glaze over each so it runs down the sides (I have NEVER achieved the smooth shiny coating in the picture). Nonetheless, garnish as you like (I like strawberries) No fuss, no muss and no cutting/slicing. Always a hit!

I made 2 of these cakes recently - one to test and the second for a gourmet dinner club. For both of them, I used extra Kahlua in the filling and glaze and made 1 1/2 times the amount of glaze for ease of application. For the second cake, I doubled the cake recipe for thicker layers and found it to be perfect. The thin layers the recipe yields are just too difficult to deal with - falling apart and hardly worth the effort being so, so thin - didn't add much to the taste and texture. The key to the glaze is to first apply the crumb layer, freeze and liberally pour more over the frozen cake and quickly spread a few swipes with a large offset spatula. The key to a shiny finish is NOT to fool with it too much, spreading, etc. I made the second cake several days before I needed it and wrapped in plastic wrap and heavy foil. Several hours before the dinner party, I heated up some of the extra glaze that I had refrigerated and poured it over the top of the cake, tilting and spreading once or twice. I put it in the freezer uncovered til I needed it and the finish was shiny and beautiful for presentation. I decorated with chocolate covered esspresso beans as shown and also dipped large strawberries in dark chocolate and then drizzled some white chocolate in a zig-zag pattern over the set strawberries, which I put around the cake. It was a HUGE hit - as promised, the filling tasted like yummy soft ice cream and the cake layers were fabulous with the ganache. I can't believe some people are suggesting not to include the flourless cake layers! I can't wait to use this fantastic do-ahead dessert again!

I have made this recipe numerous times and it is always a hit. It takes 2 days to make, but the freezer does most of the work. I like to make a chocolate transfer sheet and break it up to decorate the cake. it gives it another WOW factor.

I've made this 5 times now, following the recipe to a T, and it's exceptional each and every time. In a pinch, the International Delights Cafe Vienna can be used in place of the instant espresso powder. This recipe has floored guests each and every time.

This was a nice mocha cake, although there are other recipes I prefer. I am only writing to second several of the previous reviews. First, I didn't feel that the cake added anything particularly worthwhile; perhaps is Kahlua were added to the batter? I would have preferred the filling and ganache alone. Second, be liberal with the Kahlua! I added more to the glaze and feel that that really made the dessert. All told, it is very tasty, but not out of this world.

I made it for Christmas dessert. This dessert tastes amazing. The filling is actually similar to Starbucks Java Chip Ice Cream. Is it a lot of work? Yes. But well worth it. People were asking for second helpings. Only issue I had was getting the first thin layer of ganache to cover the filling without mixing in with it. It all turned out great, however. I disagree that the cake layers didn't add anything. The whole dish was perfect.

I received a lot of compliments from my dinner guests for this recipe, but it was a lot of work and wasn't something I could just 'throw together' My one tip would be to be liberal with the Kahula (I love the stuff) and don't be afraid to let it sit out of the freezer for a little while to thaw before you serve it -- I just think the flavours come through a little better when it's softened.

Made this and Lime Mousse Cake, also on this site, for pot luck dinner. Although this is a very good dish and presents nicely, I don't think it is worth the extra work. I agree the cake adds little and the glaze should be doubled just to make the process easier. Other dessert was much bigger hit at dinner!

Served this for a dinner party and it was wonderful. It was easy to make but time consuming--I made it the day before and then added the ganache the day of. As other reviewers said, take time to really read the recipe and then break it into steps from there. I made the cake layers in silicon cake pans which made them easy to get out without tearing or breaking. I made in a springform pan which made it easy as well. One comment I didn't find that the cake layers really added much to the cake overall so I think another time I might just make the filling, freeze it and then add the ganache. I decorated with fresh strawberries dipped in the ganache.

Definitely a crowd pleaser. My guests loved it! I didn't find it too hard to make - but it definitely requires a few days to make. For example - I was to serve this on Sunday afternoon, and after reading the recipe a few times (as suggested by many reviewers - thanks) - I realized I had to start it on Friday!! You should really start making this recipe 2 days before you are to serve it. My only other words of advice are to let the cakes cool COMPLETELY!!! The recipe says an hour or so - but it took so much longer, and when they were still semi-warm, they were even more delicate than when they were completely cooled. The cakes are really so thin and easy to break. But if they do - don't worry too much - because the ganache glaze will fill in any major cracks or breaks. Oh, and one last thing - you should 1 1/2x the ganache recipe AT LEAST. I did that at the advice of other reviewers and I found it to be the perfect amount of glaze. ENJOY!!

I agree with all the other commenters and loved this cake. One suggestion I have: Take the recipe's advice and heat the egg yolks, kahlua, and sugar in a METAL bowl over the simmering water I did this the first time using a glass bowl because I didn't have a metal one, and I couldn't get the temp high enough. The mixture peaked at about 120 degrees, and I didn't want to overcook it by leaving it on the stove for twice/three times as long to get it up to temp.

GO ON AND MAKE THIS!!! I was almost disuaded from making this after reading the reviews of a grueling experience. I am SO glad I went ahead and made it. This is amazingly good--both taste and presentation. There are some really good tips in the reviews, and I offer them to you in a summary here. 1) Read the recipe a few times to acquaint yourself, 2) Use top quality chocolate, 3) Make this cake over two or three days; it is labor intensive, but won't seem very tough this way,4) When removing the cakes from the pans, be very gentle and use a large spatula to guide them onto cardboard rounds, 5) Put the cake together in a spring form pan to freeze it, 6) Double the ganache; this may make a little extra but eliminates the stress of covering the cake in an attractive manner; the ganache hardens quickly. 6) Decorate with chocolate covered espresso beans.

I made this cake for a dinner party in honor of a friend visiting from England. Yes, it was huge hit! I have already been asked to make it for a friend's birthday on December 26 and for New Year's Eve. Everyone raved! Worth every hour of effort.

I just made this for my boyfriend and it's absolutely killer. Most likely one of the best cakes I've ever made, I've already been asked to make it again but I think I need to break it down in steps a little better than I did. It's pretty interesting cake to make when you don't have a double boiler or a springform pan, next time I'll be better prepared and it'll be even yummier. I highly recommend this recipe.

I have now made this cake a few times. Very time consuming but the attention is worth it. Everybody loves this cake! I forgot about doubling the glaze this time around which made glazing the cake more difficult. Oh Well its good anyway you slice it!

This recipe was great! My mom just had a dinner party and I made the desserts. This cake was a HUGE hit; I've never gotten so many compliments. I pretty much followed the recipe, except that I used amaretto instead of Kahlua. It was fairly time consuming, but well worth the effort. My little brother has already decided that this is going to be his next birthday cake. It looks really fancy when decorated with chocolate leaves and small dollops of whipped cream.

I made this last summer following the recipe exactly and it turned out very well. I made it again now for Passover, and it was nicely different than the usual flourless chocolate cake. I cheated and bought ice cream this time because I was afraid to try the recipe without using the corn syrup. I softened the ice cream and mixed in chopped chocolate chips. I got lots of compliments and my daughter who likes to say she doesn't like chocolate complained there were no leftovers.

I just made this cake for Easter - it also served the purpose of a birthday cake for various family members. For the cake layers, I didn't have parchment paper in the house, so I generously buttered and floured the pans. The layers were still a pain to get out, and the edges fell off. This was actually ok, since I was able to smoosh the broken pieces into the mouse, and once you freeze the cake, the pieces just freeze together. I actually wasn't that pleased with the taste of the cake layers. The flavor was bland and the texture seemed to soft. I would have prefered something with a texture more similar to a thin brownie - that chocolatey and with a fudgy texture. For the chopped chocolate in the mouse, I just chopped up chocolate chips, which left some whole chips - tasted fine. I did double the glaze, had some leftover. The glaze firmed just fine. The final cake had to be transported to the Easter gathering, half an hour away. I covered it loosely with foil, and by the time we got there, the cake had softened but was in good condition. Finally, when it came time to eat the cake, everyone was impressed. When they tasted it, they were amazed. The cake did melt considerably after about 20 minutes, so I returned the last two pieces to the freezer, where two of my uncles retrieved it an hour later to finish them up. I was worried kids wouldn't eat it because of the kahlua, but they all loved it. I'd definitely make it again, make it the day before, you'll love it and stun everyone.

I read the other reviews before I started this cake and followed the advice of doubling the ganache recipe, which made plenty of chocolate. So, obviously I don't know if the original recipie was too little, but doubling did work! I know this cake looks difficult, but I have made my fair share of cakes and this is one of the best and well worth the effort and mess. I had forgotten to put the parchment paper under the two thin layers of cake before baking them, and as everyone mentioned, these layers are very thin and difficult to work with . . .however, if you do forget this or simply don't have parchment available, just loosen the cake around the edges using a knife (cake should be slightly seperated from the cake pan after baking) and use a rubber spatuala (very gingerly) to remove the cake from the bottom of the pan. I highly reccomend this cake, rich but fantastic!

This recipe took time and patience to make, but it was SOOOO good! It looks so elegant - all of my friends were impressed. Next time I make it, I will use bittersweet chocolate for the ganache glaze, as it was a tiny bit on the too-sweet side, but I'm not complaining. I doubled the glaze recipe, per the advice of other reviewers, and had plenty to spare. The coffee beans on top were the perfect touch. Yum!

Somewhat of a challenge, but it was a fun one because it uses several different baking techniques. More importantly, the result was terrific - my guests all loved it. I put raspberries on top instead of espresso beans, to add color. I wish I'd read the reviews first, because I didn't think to increase the glaze and it definately would have helped. I also agree with the reviewer who suggested this would make a great Passover dessert.

ALTHOUGH I AM AN EXPERIECED BAKER, I GENERALLY LOOK FOR ORIGINAL AND UNCOMPLICATED RECEIPES. THIS WAS SOMEWHAT MORE INVOLVED A DESSERT THAN I WOULD COOSE TO DO. HOWEVER, AFTER READING THE REVIEWS I DECIDED TO GO FOR IT. THE SPRINGFORM PAN WAS A GOOD IDEA. I HAD NO PROBLEM WITH THE DELICATE CAKE. THE GLAZE WAS TRICKY. I WENT 1 1/2 TIMES THE RECEIPE FOR THE GLAZE ENSURING I WOULD HAVE ENOUGH. THE FIST LAYER OF GLAZE DID NOT GO ON EASILY. THE GLAZE NEVER REALLY THICKENED EVEN AFTER PLACING IT IN THE FRIDGE TO FIRM UP A LITTLE. I THEN ADDED EXTRA CHOCOLATE TO THE REMAINING GLAZE TO FIRM IT UP. THAT WORKED WELL. THE FINAL COAT WENT ON FAR BETTER AND GAVE A MORE PROFESSIONAL FINISH.I USED CHOCOLATE COVERED EXPRESSO BEANS TO DECORATE THE TOP OF THE CAKE.NOT SURE I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN.

While this was a delicious dessert, I would not make it again simply because there are two other mocha cake/torte recipes which deliver the same great taste and textures but are easier to make. Try Bon Appetit's Mocha Custard Tart (my favorite!) or Layered Mocha Cream Torte. For this dessert- having to use an electric beater on the egg yolks over simmering water, and then needing two other bowls to beat cream and then egg yolks separately, plus having to pull out my coffee grinder to finely grind chocolate - well, that's a hassle, and why bother if other recipes are equally tasty and simpler?

I made this for Father's Day and it was a hit. Most of the family could not believe I did not buy it from a gourmet bakery. Also, if you are not an expert, don't be discouraged. Just read carefully, and take it one step at a time. After reading the recipe and the reviews, I was very unsure about making this cake. But, I read the recipe about 10 more times and became comfortable with what I would be doing. Instead of 9" cake pans, I used 8" pans and the cakes came right out with breaking. If you do use 8" pans, do not double the filling or glaze, it will be too much.

This was not hard, it just took a little patience, which was definitely rewarded -- it was delicious. The cake layers were delicate but not impossible to deal with. I had no instant espresso, so I added a little strong coffee instead to the filling. If I were doing this again but in a bit of a rush, I might try using softened mocha chip ice cream in the center. It wouldn't be as light, but you'd still get the overall effect.

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit. Even people who didn't want to eat dessert ate every bite. It's a bit labor intensive, but it has to be made in advance, so that makes it invaluable. The cakes are fragile -- mine were stuck to the boards and I needed to use a knife to peel them off in one piece. But the glaze covers every thing, so it doesn't really matter if they fall apart. Great taste and presentation!

My husband saw this cake in my Bon Appetit magazine and said, "This is what I want for my birthday." I love treating my family to decadent deserts for special occasions, so I was happy to give this a try. It was actually an easy recipe if you can break it up over the course of three days. Needless to say it was a hit. Our noisy family was silent after the cake was served -- they were completely absorbed in the rich flavors. Excellent!!!

What a great 'make ahead' dessert-especially for the summer. My guests loved this cake. Only two variations: I doubled the ganache (rather have too much than run short) and I decorated with chocolate covered espresso beans. Will definitely add to my list of favorites!

Although I feel like I am in the minority, I had a really hard time with this cake. I spread the steps out over three days. I am an experienced baker, but my cake came out looking nothing like the picture. I think maybe my freezer was too full and the air didn't circulate enough, because my glaze didn't really set up. It did, however, do a very nice job of coating everything in the freezer. After all of my difficulties, it did taste incredible, and I will make it again, if only to prove that this cake can't beat me!

I made this over two days. It is time consuming but not difficult. Carefully preparing the pan with either wax paper or parchment paper made the thin cakes more sturdy. Use mini chocolate chips to decorate the edges. There was not one bite left!!

I didn't have any problems with this recipe except for how fragile the cakes were. They were almost impossible to not break when moving them. It was fine to piece them together, however, because once they were frozen the ganache covered up the mistakes. I also mada a batch and a half of the glaze as suggested by others. It ended up looking great and tasting delicious.

Beautiful and delicious...Don't be afraid to make this cake. Really when you think about it, it's really simple. Just relax and divid it into steps like the recipe calls for. Once you've baked the layers, you can use a 9" spring form pan to put the whole cake together and it comes out of the pan much easier and has a nice look to it. Before you put on the ganache you can cut around the sides, if needed, to even the whole thing out. You don't have to decorate it exactly like the picture either. It's fun to make something like this and sit back and watch your guests/family ohh and ahh!

YUM! I made this for Passover (no flour) and it was a huge hit! My husband's new fave dessert (he is a chocolate and ice cream lover). You need time, but each step is not hard to do. Great for do ahead as it stays in freezer fine for a couple days. I doubled the ganache topping and would do that again when I make it next time, and there definitely will be a next time!
