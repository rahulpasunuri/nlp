I served this recipe over an elk ribeye and it was delicious. A must try.

I am defintely in the minority here. This was quick but bland bland bland.

This was delicious! We had it over pasta and my husband and I just loved it. I made a few substitutions because I am vegan. I sbustituted plain water for the chicken broth, corn syrup for honey, whole wheat bread for the white bread (because I didn't have white bread on hand), and olive oil for the butter. The flavor is complex - spicy, garlicky, and smokey (in a good way, like roasted veggies). The aroma from the hazelnuts is fantastic and the nuts add a nice texture, but I wasn't able to taste the nuts much. My husband is on a low-sodium diet, so I left the salt out of his and he said it was delicious. I will definitely make this again!
