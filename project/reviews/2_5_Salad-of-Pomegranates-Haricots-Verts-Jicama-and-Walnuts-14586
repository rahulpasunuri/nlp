This salad is delicious, colorful, and unusual. I have made it several time. The only change made was to add salt to the jicama and pomegranate juice mixture and also to the salad when assembled. I also served the salad on a boston lettuce leaf on each plate. Once you have juiced the pomegranate half on a citrus juicer, you can get more juice out of the seeds by putting them into a potato ricer.

This recipe is ho-hum at best, nothing to write home about or try again. It has no bite or complexity but is bland and blah...
