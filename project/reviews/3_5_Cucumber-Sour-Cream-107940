The sauce is an excellent accompanyment to salmon and, as another reviewer noted, a tasty dip with veggies or pita chips. It's a definite keeper and very easy to make.

I loved this sauce, I served it on little salmon sandwiches for my coctail new year's party and they were really good!

Really enjoyed this sour cream. I especially enjoyed it with the cold salmon the next day. This is the perfect accompaniement to cold poaced salmon and I look forward to making it again. I did add some horseradish to jazz it up a bit the second time and it was wonderful.

I've made this dish twice and I've been asked for the recipe each time. I would agree that the mustard could be reduced by half and more cucumbers are great,too. But, overall, it tastes so clean and fresh; it's just great. It is definitely a keeper.

I used watercress instead of arugula in the sauce which was good and "peppery". Also used the Fat Free sour cream which was just fine.

This recipe makes the salmon dish colorful, perfect for spring. Easy to make, which makes it a keeper. The Dijon came on a bit strong for our tastes, however. I would cut that back a bit next time - maybe by half? I would also add more cucumber. Another possible variation of this recipe would be to substitute dill for either the arugula or spinach, or both. Not sure how that would work with the salmon marinade though.

This brilliantly coloured green sauce is delightful - clean, fresh flavours prevail and it is perfect alongside the salmon. It would also be good with other fish or served as a dip. Served for Easter dinner, it was a huge hit and reminded me of the fact that "spring has sprung".

We really enjoyed this sauce over grilled salmon. We used the leftovers as a dip for raw veggies and pita. Will definitely make again.
