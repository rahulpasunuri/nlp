I first made this as a starter course for Thanksgiving years ago and it was remembered and requested as part of Christmas dinner this year (we did a Feast of Seven Fishes on Christmas Day-not very authentic, but fun)and this made an excellent addition. We had a little of the sauce left, so plan to use it as a starter for some oyster soup. Meant to add the garlic as suggested by the reviewer from TX, but I forgot, maybe next time

This dish has been a standard for our family as a holiday appetizer since we first saw it published in the magazine. We also use it as a light meal with a salad and glass of full-bodied white wine. Even oyster "fearers" like this.

We added minced garlic to the shallot and celery as it sauted, substituted half-n-half for the heavy cream and added more cayenne (we like it spicy!). This recipe had a lighter flavor than we expected and served with a crisp lettuce leaf, a slice of homegrown tomato , and a wedge of avacado, made a tasty light dinner.
