They're pretty and curiously delicious. I'd never done anything like this but I'll do it again because it took very little effort.

I made these last year and they are addictive. I will be making them this year again, just because they are so pretty and tasty. "Brushing" the cranberries was too ridiculous. I simply dumped a few berries in the syrup at a time and then fished them out with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl of sugar. It was much faster. I did have to change out the sugar because of some clumps, but for what sugar costs - it was worth it. The sage leaves did NOT turn out right, and I did brush them. They didn't stay pretty green. Plus - there not edible.

These little cranberries were so good that I couldn't stop popping them in my mouth as they dried. I just served them in a bowl surrounded by the sage leaves, and Thanksgiving guests just tossed a handful on their plates. (I didn't make the grappa jelly.) I had no trouble with the syrup, although I used every inch of counter space as these guys were drying. But they were worth the effort -- a nice unexpected treat!

I made this to garnish the cranberry grappa jelly, and it was pretty. But it's difficult to coat each cranberry with melted sugar syrup! I ended up putting a toothpick in them, which took too long and the syrup cooled and got a bit too thick and gloopy. The sage browned in spots when coated with the hot syrup. I don't think I'd go through the trouble again, as pretty as it was. But it was nice to discover that raw cranberries covered in sugar are delicious!
