Only two small tweaks. Ad some mushrooms while cooking the shallots, and use stock instead of water. Follow the rest of the recipe to a T and it will come out delicious.

Good starter recipe, I substituted wine for the water and added the wine and balsamic with the braise. The sauce reduced down to a wonderful rich topping for the chicken when serving. Served with wilted baby spinach (which took in some of the bacon) and couscous. I think next time I will go with a more bitter green to counter the sweet sauce though - maybe kale (and still use the bacon!).

I made this recipe last evening using 4 chic thighs. I added a few onions as I didn't have enough shallots. This is a keeper recipe, for sure. Balsamic and bacon finish is just super.

Rating: 3
Good recipe but it is MUCH better with mushrooms added as you thicken the sauce. It makes for a "meatier" ragu type of sauce. Also, use a good chicken stock instead of water. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great and I will make it again.

I love this recipe. I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts sliced thin and floured. I add crushed red pepper, sundried tomatoes to the shallot, garlic, bacon, balsamic reduction. I also add water to temper the vinegar. I cook this for guests a lot as everything can be made ahead of time and then warmed up. Definitely a winner.

Rating: 3
a great dish. I prepared it as others with boneless, skinless breasts which I floured prior to frying. And I sauteed mushrooms with the shallots, garlic, balsamic and bacon. I didn't cook all of the chicken that night so I had extra sauce. when I cooked the remainder the following night, I added water to loosen the sauce and some diced sun dried tomatoes which added a lovely flavor. As with most sauces, I felt it got better with time. I would prepare the sauce one day ahead. Better flavor and makes the cooking of the chicken a cinch.

This was great and I would definitely make it again. I followed the recipe exactly until, in the end I felt it needed a little extra kick and I added a capful of apple cider vinegar and it was EXACTLY what it needed. It took it from good to great. I made it in October and it tasted just like fall. Love this and maybe I'll even make it again tonight.

I used two boneless, skinless, chicken breast halves, halved the other ingredients, and added a tablespoon of rosemary with the garlic. The sauce was rich and delicious.

Rating: 3
I'm giving three stars to an adulterated version of the recipe. However, the problem I had with this was that the chicken didn't have enough flavor compared to the finished sauce. I would have added the vinegar into the sauce when finishing the chicken. My changes were as follows: red onion instead of shallots, pinch of red pepper, peas and arugula at the end as to not have to fix a second side dish. I served it alongside Ziyad Maftoul Baladi Couscous (very earthy flavor).

Very tasty.... used two large boneless, skinless breasts - and stock instead of water. Loved the sweet onion, sweet garlic combination, and the vinegar did not overpower after reducing a little bit. Will make this again.

The concensus around the table was that this dish is "yummy", hence the 3 forks rating. But my heavens,there was a lot of fussing in the kitchen to get it done. It was like the hokey pokey: you put the bacon in, you take the bacon out, you put the chicken, you take the chicken out, you put the shallots in, and you shake it all about... so while it is a one pan wonder, it requires a lot of attention. Mashed potatoes was, in fact, a tasty accompaniment, along with some green beans.

This was delicious, but it took way longer than 1 1/4 hours. Peeling the shallots is time consuming. Also, I had to add a tiny bit more water after about 10 minutes of braising.

This was great, made almost just as is. I used chicken breasts with bone and skin on, but removed these before serving.

I don't understand the negative reviews about this dish. Although it isn't the most inspired chicken dish that I have ever found on epi, it is delicious and reasonably simple. I think that some of the substitutions that I saw people use would have taken away from the overall flavor. The bacon fat truly does add to the finished dish as do the shallots. I have to admit to using chicken broth and wine instead of water though.

Made this tonight, also using boneless skinless breasts. I made only two breasts, halved the shallots, but still did a (nearly) whole head of garlic. Unfortunately, I didn't think to reduce the cooking time, so it was a little dry. I didn't think the bacon added much but fat -- next time I'll skip the bacon and just use olive oil. End result: very good, but not my favorite.

This was a big hit with my husband. I used sweet onions since the store was out of shallots. Shallots would be better, but it was still delicious. Next time I would season the sauce with a little salt and pepper before I add the chicken. I served it with mashed potatoes/rutabagas and steamed Brussels sprouts. Yummy.

Fixed this recipe tonight for dinner and served with a green salad and mashed potatoes. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again the next time we have company. I don't know what I did differently. It didn't take me two hours to make this. From the time I started chopping the shallots to the time we ate, was one hour five minutes. Unlike some who found the sauce thin, mine was just thick enough. If you don't like balsamic vinegar, you won't like this recipe. If you don't like shallots or onions, if you substitute, you won't like this. I also found that the bacon I used didn't produce a lot of fat, and I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I barely had two tablespoons of fat to cook the shallots in. My husband even commented on how good this dish was. With such few ingredients, it isn't difficult to make.

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful! I used 4 thick cut bacon slices, lots of carmelized onions, skinned the chicken and topped it off with rounded teaspoon of poultry demi glace. Use top quality balsamic vinegar & don't skimp on the garlic!

I've made many recipes from the Ep, but I rarely rate. I enjoy reading the reviews, but I for the most just do my own thing and move on. HOWEVER, I noticed the recommendation from the Boston cook to check out: http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105172, and I did. I liked aspects of both, so I decided to follow this recipe but for a few changes/insertions. 1) I went with boneless skinless. Shoot, ain't a shortage of moisture so why add fat? 2) Boneless skinless cooks faster so I let the garlic work for 10 minutes solo before I put the chick back in. 3) I added some dried basil (1/2 teaspoon maybe?) when I mashed the garlic. 4) Tossed in a few grape toms and let them work just long enough to see them split. Result? Some taste vittles. Oh yeah, I the mashers with bacon sprinkles. I make it up in the gym tomorrow. Oh yeah!

Rating: 3
A good starting point, but I suggest the following additions/substitutions: 1)deglaze the shallots with white wine once they are cooked. 2)don't use water, use chicken stock. 3)I added chantrelle mushrooms and it was a great addition. It was delicious, use the best balsamic vinegar you can and err on the side of too little. we paired this with a very fine aged aussie chardonny and it was perfect!

Great dish. I used boneless skinless breasts insted & would suggest that you simmer only 20-25 minutes to keep the breasts moist. Also slightly less coking time for the shallots.

One of my favorite things from this site so far! I used skinless chicken breasts rather than buying a whole chicken but didn't change anything else and it was incredibly good. I would definitely not skip the bacon, as it adds a unique flavor. Also, I think shallots account for some of the flavor too, as they're lighter than onions. I served this with the sage and white cheddar mashed potatoes also on this site.

Rating: 3
Just a few comments: we cooked this using onions instead of shallots, red wine vinegar instead of balsamic, and half the amount of bacon suggested. It was still good, but the taste was somehow a bit to plain, somewhat unidimensional. Perhaps using balsamic vinegar and more bacon could have done the trick. Any comments?

One of our wintry-night favorites. We've make this dish fairly often, both with and without the bacon, and the quality of the balsamic is key to the outcome. If the garden variety salad dressing-quality vinegar is used, the dish is pretty good; but if finished with aged balsamic (or even half and half dressing and aged) it's absolutely stupendous--no bacon required to spice it up.

Great potential. I also used onions instead of shallots and omitted the bacon alltogether. Will try again with less vin. and more onions (really carmelize to get the full flavor.)

This was so-so. I will try it once more with less vinegar as it overwhelmed the other flavors. The shallots and garlic were very good. I will also skin the chicken. After braising, the skin was limp and detracted from the taste.

sub'd flat champagne for the water; it is spectacular for company and for winter dinner parties. Use cast iron for better temperature control.

This recipe was awesome! Of course I made a few changes like using boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken, and using wine instead of water.

I will definetly make this again. I served it with the red roasted potatoes with lemon. Excellent!

A pound of shallots? Are they nuts? This is a bistro dish....vidalia onions work beautifully. If they aren't in season, use sweet onions and a touch of sugar. You must not skimp on time when carmelizing the onions...take the time to let them darken and sweeten, it's key for the sauce. If you don't make the bacon, you don't have the flavor base for the sauce! I used 1/2 cup ck. broth (stock) and 1/2 half cup white wine for the water. I would suggest, if you can stand it, taking the skin off before serving. The initial browning may help the flavor but once you simmer it the skin turns....well, yucky. REMOVE IT! I added the garlic after the onion cooked ten minutes, covered. Also, I cooked mushrooms in some left over bacon grease then added them at the end. Be sure to use a good quality balsamic, 12 year old was wonderful. This dish takes 1 1/2 hours start to finish but...it's easy and the flavor is great.

My husband is not typically a vinegar fan and he loved this dish. I followed previous suggestions such as using wine and/or chicken broth instead of water (I used a 1/2 cup of each). I even omitted the bacon, and while I'm sure it's quite tasty with bacon, we didn't miss it. The sauce was divine and especially good over mashed potatoes -- YUM!

Rating: 2
This dish was OK - the sauce was good, and I like the crumbled bacon (nice texture) but I used chicken thighs/drumsticks and I did not like how the meat turned out at all. I did not cook the shallots as long as they suggested and added the garlic in along side the shallots. The shallots were plenty soft and the garlic could have been even more tender.. The recipe took alot longer to cook than 30 minutes! I would probably use less bacon fat or sautee in olive oil instead (although I did like the bacon crumbles at the end) and I would use skinless breasts instead. The skin on the pieces shrank back and the drumsticks were NOT appetizing. For anyone liking the Balsamic element in this recipe, I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this recipe to you! Much easier and absolutely DELICOUS!! http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=105172

I thought this was wonderful and my husband had seconds. I didn't use as much balsamic vinegar as my husband is not a big fan of vinegar. I used chicken broth as an addition and it had just enough flavor of the balsamic vinegar that it was superb!!

In a word - fantastic! In fact, my family and I cannot understand how anyone could NOT like this recipe! It is far from bland, as some said. There are definitely not too many shallots, as some said. If you just use wine instead of watr, as I and many others did, and make sure to cook the balsamic vinegar down to an almost syrupy consistency, you cannot go wrong.

Rating: 2
My husband liked this recipe very much, I thought that it was lacking in something, maybe a bit of fresh thyme would have been nice. I don't think that one needs to add the bacon at all as it does tend to get overpowered by the balsamic. I used skinless chicken which worked fine, a bit less fat for those of us who are health conscience. I served this with browned spaetzle which was a very good alternative to mashed potatoes which can seem a bit mundane. Also, as Vidalia onions are now in season, I used those instead of the shallots.

Rating: 1
This dish took a great deal of time to make (although it wasn't labor-intensive). We couldn't taste the bacon at all, and because of the balsamic vinegar, the whole thing took on an unappetizing color. I won't make this again--there are just too many other options.

I like this recipe because it doesn't call for a lot of ingredients. I do think you need the bacon fat but I agree that you don't need to sprinkle the bacon bits on the chicken at the end. Something about the shallots cooked in the bacon drippings brings out a complex rich flavor. I used chicken breasts only and it came out very good and moist. Next time you fry bacon, save the fat and cook this dish. Definitely goes well with mashed potatoes.

Rating: 3
Definitely comfort food. Try it using only thighs, well trimmed. I,too, didn't use the bacon sprinkles, but did use some bacon fat and olive oil to saute. Although it was very well liked by my family the first night, the vinegar had become too strong by the second. I would suggest adding the vinegar when reheating if preparing ahead.

Rating: 3
While the whole process realistically takes about 1.5 hours, but there's enough down time along the way to prepare a side dish, make a salad, and set the table. It was not excessively complicated or difficult to make. FLAVORS: The flavors of the sauce are defined by the tang of basalmic vinegar, the sweetness of the onions, and hints of flavor from the bacon and garlic. CONSISTENCY: The consistency of the sauce is defined by the softness of the onions combined with the silkiness of some of the rendered bacon fat.(Note: Don't substitute out the bacon because it will certainly change both the consistency and the flavor of this dish. The crumbled bacon at the end, however, seemed entirely optional) The consistency of the chicken is that of browning and then braising... Still tender, but a little drier and stringier rather than succulent. RECOMMENDATIONS: I added some grey/sea salt and would recommend doing the same. In terms of side dishes, I would recommend pairing the chicken with something not-too-rich, such as garlic mashed potatoes or white rice with some green peas, green beans, or spinach. FINAL TAKE: In the end, my wife and I really enjoyed it and will definitely be making it again. It's not very fancy/impressive, but it is very satisfying and good enough for guests. I would liken it to jazzed up comfort food. (NOTE: I also like this recipe because most of the ingredients could probably be bought up to 10 days in advance, assuming you freeze the chicken, which is always helpful in stretching out the time between grocery store trips.)

Rating: 2
As other reviewers have said, I expected this to taste much better than it did. I made it exactly as written except I didn't use any bacon. The chicken was rather tough, which surprised me after it had simmered so long. I will try it again with the suggestion of adding 1 cup of white wine instead of water. I'll agree--for the time it took to make, this recipe was not all that fabulous.

The key to enjoying this dish is to honestly ask yourself the following questions: 1) Do I like vinegar? 2) Do I have a cooking assistant? It takes a while to make this dish, and it's not the "talk to the guests while the dish is cooking" kind of recpie. It's the stand over the stove and do lots of stuff recipe. With that in mind, the finished product was very very good, akin to something you'd get in a restaurant. I doubled the vinegar, and used a white wine for cooking the chicken, and it was flavorful, rich, and very tasty. Just make sure you like vinegar and you have some time on your hands. :^)

I had great results with this dish, though I made a few alterations to make it more to my taste. For instance, I used just over a pound of skinless boneless chicken breasts and 4 bacon slices instead of 6, added a tablespoon of butter to the shallots after 5 minutes, and used wine instead of water. Other changes I thought were appropriate happened to reduce the overall prep time: I browned the chicken for only 2 minutes each side and caramelized the shallots for only 10 minutes overall instead of 20. The chicken breasts were braised for about 20 minutes or so. One thing is absolutely key: use high-quality balsamic vinegar-- mine was an aged, imported variety that made the dish. Definitely a keeper.

A hint to the 10/19/01 reviewer. Whenever we have upset stomachs after eating chicken, I find it is usually due to improper handling. Usually, when my hubby cooks, he isn't careful with raw chicken and sanitizing after cleanup. I figured this out after stomach upset two times in a row after he made chicken. I was cutting fresh fruit, which came into contact with the area he failed to sanitize. This might be a better explanation, than too many shallots!

In the end, this was a very tasty dish, but I did do some improvising. Went with the white wine suggestion. Believe it or not, would probably do a little more garlic, a bit less balsamic vinegar (which I love). Didn't use all the recommended shallots. This may or may not be due to the fact that I use boneless chicken breast -- who knows? It was yummy in the end, though. The mashed potatoes were the perfect side.

Way Too many shallots. I made this receipe for 6 adults instead of 4 as indicated in the serving size for this meal, and used 3/4 of the amount of shallots and there was still too much. I also used skinned/boned chicken breast which I found to be better then keeping the skin. I agree this would have made the sauce more liquidy as the fat melts from the skin. I served it with garlic mash potatoes, steamed broccoli and a nice Pinot Noir. My company liked it very much, I'm still in between about making it again. If I do, it'll be changed quite a bit.

I scraped the last bit of sauce and bacon from my plate and picked at the bones like a mandolin, to find one last morsel of chicken to spread the sauce over before I popped the fork into my mouth. Such sweet harmony. We did not rise from the table once we heard the litte bell from the kitchen telling us that our plate warming oven was left on. We had to let the rich flavors soak in. We heeded the suggestion of one other reviewing chef and added wine instead of water and from another, we increased our garlic count. Alas, we also waited for the sauce to thicken to sweet richness. It was a wonderful autumn meal.

Where do you add the vinegar? My emailed recipe doen't include the addition? Thank you, BJ albjmc@msn.com

Instead of a cup of water I used a cup of white wine and reduced the sauce. It was a huge success with both the b/f and the kids. Served with mashed potatoes to sop up the extra sauce ... no left overs.

This recipe is fabulous if it is done correctly. Potatoes are perfect to saok up the yummy extra sauce. This is a make again and again recipe.

Recipe was messy (greasy) to make and a little more trouble than it was worth. The flavors were good, but I was still disappointed

I followed the recipe except that I used a bulb and a half of garlic. Mine did not seem that large and we love garlic. Obviously the first reviewer was not impressed with this recipe. My wife and I were blown away by it. I thought a pound of shallots were a lot to use, but the flavor of the sauce on this chicken was truly incredible. I made it last night for dinner and I can't wait to make it again. We also served mashed potatoes with the chicken as suggested. For a vegetable I used fresh kale and fresh portabello mushrooms with some garlic, there I go again, and hot pepper flakes in a covered frying pan with about a cup of chicken stock. Great combination. Try this chicken recipe for yourself and make sure you reduce the sauce at the end of cooking the chicken. This is really important to enhance all of the ingredients and bring out there wonderful flavor. Sooo good!

This was fine, but not incredible. There are lots more really terrific chicken recipes that are basically a similar preparation. I'd use those over this one.
