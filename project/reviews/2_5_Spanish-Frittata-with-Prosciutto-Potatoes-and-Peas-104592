Given all the likable ingredients, I thought this would be a fast dinner. Alas, it TOTALLY lacked in flavor. Granted, I did not have any truffle oil, but I tried grating parmesan over and even that didn't bring this dish up to any kind of acceptable level. Probably the worst thing I've served my family in a long time.

The basic ingredients are a good idea, but the recipe is lacking. Shame on the recipe testers for not figuring out that the potatoes should be salted first. It didn't occur to me until afterward that of course, the potatoes needed salt. The cooking method was terrible too. I would use the same ingredients again, but use the classic stovetop/broiler method for cooking, salt the potatoes when I cooked them in the skillet, and leave the salt out of the eggs, allowing the salt from the potatoes and prosciutto to compensate.

Very good. I followed the recipe but in the future will modify how I cook it in order to avoid rubbery eggs. Keep the burner on low while assembling the frittata so that the bottom portion of the eggs set. Then, switch the broiler on high, slide the skillet underneath (on the top rack) until the rest of the frittata cooks and is browned - about 5 minutes. I use this method for other frittatas, and it works much better than baking.

Very good... I am not reviewing the exact recipe b/c it was a spur of the moment thing and I used what I had on hand. That included purple potatoes and regular ham. But I used fresh shelled peas... It was delicious served with a sprinkling of fresh dill, a dollop of creme fraiche, and alongside a baby romaine salad with balsamic and olive oil. Simple and elegant...

I used caramelized onions spiced with paprika instead of peas, and regular ham and it tastes delicious. Next time I will bake about 15 min. and broil it for a couple of minutes also. It did not fully cook in the center so I overbaked it, and the outside came out a bit overcooked. That was the only flaw, otherwise this is a good recipe.

This is a great quick dinner - especially if these are items you tend to keep on hand.

"Scrape out and discard any browned bits from pan"??? That's the best part!!!

I was looking for a Spanish recipe and this one looked pretty good until I came upon the ingredients. Prosciutto is an Italian ham, not a Spanish ham. If you want authentic Spanish, I would suggest using a Serrano ham instead.

I made it for a recent brunch. Quite convenient as I got all the filling ready and just assembled it and put in the oven while the guests started on the appetizers. As for taste, it is a bit bland for me. Next time, I'll add some other spices in addition to S&P, maybe chopped scallions or parsley with the eggs.

This is a great week-night dinner. Easy to make and everyone likes it. The truffle oil adds a nice touch but it's not necessary.

This recipe was delicious, easy to prepare and has a nice rustic appearance. I put it under the broiler for a few minutes just to brown the top and cut it into squares as I was serving it at a cocktail party. Everyone loved it!
