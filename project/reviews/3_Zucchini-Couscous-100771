I love couscous but this was a bit bland, even using the broth. Needs more cumin for sure. I would jazz this up more but then it becomes a different recipe!

I added purple-leaf basil, two crushed garlic cloves, sweet paprika and almonds. Delicious!

Was good but to make it a four instead of water use chicken broth (low fat/low sodium works just as well) for flavor, and I use a mixture of sauteed onions, tomatoes, and yellow and green zucchini rather than just the zucchini. add spices like garlic, basil, salt and pepper to veggies as well.

This dish was not bad and easy to make. However, I needed to give it a little more flavor.

This is an excellent recipe and it's also very good cold. I think as a salad I may add some tomatos to it.
