It is just as all others have said: easy, delicious, and beautiful. To make it without some of the sugar, blue agave works well and has less of a glycemic response than sugar or honey. I have also tried it without any additional sweetening since the ice-cream and sorbet bring plenty.

Yummy. I use the creme de cassis, sugar and lemon sauce on fruit salads and it is great.

So simple, refreshing and delicious. My guests all raved, some actually licked their glasses clean. I used strawberry and lemon sorbet with vanilla ice cream, blueberries, strawberries and raspberries.Will make again and again.

This was wonderful. I used only raspberries because I had just picked a quart of them. Instead of whipping the cream I made a simple homemade ice cream and just put the raspberry sauce on top. Out of this world!
