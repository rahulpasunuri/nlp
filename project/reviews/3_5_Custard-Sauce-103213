Rich, delicious and easy to make. I used a combination of chicken and duck yolks, and brown sugar, added a pinch of vanilla and my British husband said "best custard yet!". Be sure to whisk the dickens out of the sauce as you take it off the flame, which will reduce the lumps to nil.

I would add to this a little vanilla to taste and for the adults ,we sometimes add a good whiskey or rum or even cointreau.What ever suits you and to taste.A 50+year holiday tradition.
