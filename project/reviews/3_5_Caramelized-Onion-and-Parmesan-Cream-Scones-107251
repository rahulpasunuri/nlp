You have to remember that when you don't follow a recipe exactly, you are experimenting. And, as with any experiment, you may or may not like the outcome. For example, every salt has a unique flavor and some are saltier than others. Fine salt will fill a tablespoon fuller than coarse salt. Some hard cheeses have a higher salt content and are more flavorful than others. If you heavely salt the onions, you might need less salt in the dough. And, if you use whole grain flour instead of light cake flour, you need a little more liquid to make it work. If you follow this recipe exactly, you will most probably like the outcome. It is slightly saltier than other scones I've made, but moist and flavorful throughout. For my personal taste, using a dense sprouted spelt flour, I like to add a small sprinkle of sugar, some herbs de provence, and a little extra cream or water until it reaches the right consistency.

These really are lovely scones. I was unexpectedly out of onion so used shallots, with delicious results. I think a little rosemary would have made them even better.

i have made this recipe several times and enjoyed every one. i sometimes add some fresh rosemary midway through sauteeing the onions. i usually use 1/2 all pupose flour & 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour which seems to work well.

These were pretty good. I actually caramelized the onions (instead of just sauteeing them) with white wine, thyme, oregano, brown sugar and a little salt until they were jammy in consistency. I think it helped to moisten the scones a lot! I also found them to be just a tad too salty. Next time I will only add a scant 1 tbsp of salt and I also used about 1/3 of a cup more cream.

I was really excited about this recipe based on other reviews but I found the scones to be significantly lacking in flavor. I did err on the side of caution, again... based on other reviews here... and decreased the amount of salt so perhaps that has something to do with it but still... I used quality Parmesan so it's a surprising result. Texture wise they are not all that great either. Perhaps due to the parmesan being a hard cheese with less fat than something like cheddar or swiss. I even put a little extra cream in the mix to moisten it up and they still turned out a bit dry. Bottom line, they're edible.. but not without butter or dipped in soup or stew. For eating plain I will stick with the cheddar chive scone recipe on epicurious instead.

These were great, but next time I will leave the salt out. The parmesan cheese is enough salt.

These were fantastic- tender, good texture and a great party food as they taste good warm or room temperature. Everyone raved!

A hearty endorsement and confirmation of my wife's review below: I snagged a couple before she brought them into work, and they were stupendous . . . especially for a non-sugar-eater like myself, who craves the rarity of a cake-like savory snack. Bravo!

I brought these to work, and everyone who tried them said they loved them. Several people said they were very moist..."for scones." Next time I'll make 3 dough disks divided into 6 scones each, so they'll be a little smaller. Also, I ended up using about 1/4 cup more cream than called for.

Very good... But a note to the last reviewer. Make sure you use "coarse" salt. If you use regular table salt, they will be too salty.

Mmmm, yum! I used Kosher coarse salt and it didn't seem too salty. My guests really liked these and even asked to take some home.

The recipe is very easy to use, and the overall flavor of the scones is great, however the 1T of salt appears to be wrong, they were very salty, too salty. I am going to try the recipe again and only use 1t of salt.
