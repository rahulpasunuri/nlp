Love, love, love this recipe. We didn't have pancetta and pine nut prices are through the roof, but even without those delicious compenents it is great!

Made this without the pancetta, and it was very easy, pretty, and delicious.

Sound wonderful, BUT I have to mention that it is odd that Epicurious had this under 'You Don't Need Meat' and the second ingredient for the salad is meat! lol. Oh well, I will just have this a night without my vegetarian daughter!

This is 31/2 forks really. Easy and delicious. I tried also with arugula, but it's really better with spinach.

A beautiful and intriguing dish, and mighty tasty. The toasted pine nuts added a wonderful depth of flavor. I did increase the garlic as others suggest, and it was a good move. I'll be bringing this to our staff potluck Christmas party - it will definitely hold up my reputation for bringing interesting food to work.

this was great! i made it for a potluck with vegetarians, so i skipped the pancetta, but heated the cabbage with a bit of olive oil and added some salty sheep feta on top for a bit of tang. a good way to use up a giant head of cabbage!

I had this salad a few times at Adriatica in Seattle and it was wonderful. I'm glad to have found a recipe that is true to the original. Nice work.

Not only does it look beautiful, but it tastes fantastic, too! I was out of some ingredients, but it didn't matter. I used applewood sliced bacon instead of pancetta, and I was out of pine nuts so I didn't use any nuts at all. The dressing was delicious; I highly recommend adding the honey because it cuts the tartness of the mustard and balsamic vinegar, and brings out some sweetness in the red cabbage. Surprisingly, it was a nice side dish to a pasta we concocted with bacon, eggplant and leeks.

This was good - followed recipe exactly and worked well. Bet you could make all ahead of time (except the spinach) and then reheat and add spinach just as rest of dinner is done.

Everyone loved this dish. I made it for Christmas Day 2008. The red cabbage portion of the recipe would make a lovely side dish by itself. The only thing is did differently is that I did not use the honey and I made more of the vinegarette dressing. I cannot wait to make this salad again!

This was so delicious! The only substitutes I used were toasted sliced almonds instead of the pine nuts and thick cut bacon vs. the pancetta, since I had both in the fridge. I toasted the almonds separately in a small skillet and set them aside until the end. I then cooked the bacon separately in a larger skillet, and set it aside as well. I cooked the cabbage in the small amount of bacon drippings, which added a delicious flavor to the cabbage. I used a mandolin to slice the cabbage as it was suggested by one reviewer to cut it as thinly as possible. The cook time was only about 5-6 minutes. And, I used about 1/2 head of cabbage for the two of us-- it seemed like the perfect amount for the recipe. The balsamic viniagrette finished it off beautifully! I topped the warm salad with the reserved bacon and toasted almonds. This will definitely be added to my regular winter rotation!

Excellent! Even the "tough" hunting guys liked this cabbage recipie. I served over Basmati rice with salmon (skip the salmon if desired). Great to use with the red cabbage my Dad grows. I used toasted almonds in place of pine nuts; thick sliced bacon cut in 1/2 inch pieces in place pancetta. You can make the cabbage ahead of time; but heat and add spinach before serving. The balsamic vinaigrette is delicious! Enjoy!

Wow. This dish was remarkably yummy. We used almonds instead of pinenuts and added a little EV olive oil. This is a keeper.

My boyfriend is a tough critic, and he absolutely endorsed the four-fork rating. I made no changes, except that I forgot to buy fresh garlic... I used -- gasp! -- dried, granulated garlic. It was delicious!

Phenomenal - added a few dried cranberries and topped with a few sprigs of alphalpha sprouts. Looked great and very tasty!

I love this salad. I couldn't find pine nuts, and even without them it was a taste sensation. They would add a gorgeous crunch though and I'll look out for them for next time. I cut the red cabbage very fine and threw it in with the bacon (no pancetta available), and found that it softened faster than other reviews had led me to expect and that the bacon didn't suffer by staying in the pan. Of course, it's a thick Cairo bacon that never really got crispy, which may have had something to do with it.

A good salad--and healthful! A couple of suggestions: 1.) cook the pine nuts and pancetta and then remove them from the pan before cooking the cabbage. Add them back in at the end. 2.) make sure you slice your red cabbage as thin as humanly possible--otherwise it takes forever to cook. 3.) if you intend to double the recipe, the above two caveats are all the more important!

This was really delicious and I think would appeal to people who tend ot shun vegetables. I made it with bacon because I couldn't find pancetta and it worked beautifully. I would defintely increase the cooking time on the red cabbage (more like 15 minutes).

Fast, easy, and pretty on the plate. I used proscuitto instead of pancetta. I recommend removing the pine nuts and meat from the pan before steaming the cabbage, because they get way overdone. A half-head of cabbage seems about right for this recipe.

This recipe is fabulous. As a vegetarian I decided to omit the bacon and instead I cooked sliced portabella mushrooms along with the cabbage and spinach. Suddenly it was a main course! Delicious, beautiful, and ALWAYS a hit with guests.

I made this for a cooking club I just joined, it was a big hit. The only changes I would make is more spinach, more garlic, and use regular bacon if you can't find pancetta. Yummy and gorgeous to look at.

I thought this was wonderful! (husband too)! The only change that I made was to use regular bacon instead of the pancetta (what I had), and to use a little more spinach. Very fresh and healthy tasting, and just beautiful presentation. Loved the pine nuts!

This was very easy to make and everyone loved it. They all asked for the recipe. The only change I would make is to add more spinach.

I thought this recipe was very easy to make. When making the dressing, I realized that I didn't have any dijon mustard on hand. In place of it I used dijonnaise. Even so, with 4 cloves of garlic instead of one the dressing came out great! I served it for a dinner party and everyone loved it.

i'm giving this dish a 4 because it's very tasty, plus it's really easy to make AND incredibly good for you. i did make a couple of changes: no mustard, and kale instead of spinach (had it in my fridge). and since kale is thicker than spinach i added it to the pan to help it wilt a bit. the vinegar + cabbage makes it somewhat like a coleslaw, but then there's the kick of the garlic -- mmm! -- and the yummy nuts that change it around. finally, it's gee-orgeous to look at.

Yuck. I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband and I both thought this dish was just a huge waste of time. There are so many other epicurious recipes for spinach, or cabbage which are just wonderful. Try something else before being disappointed with this dish.

This recipe is wonderful. It is hard to get pancetta in north central PA, so we made it with thick sliced local bacon instead. My husband and I liked it so much that we made it twice in one week! We have added it to our favorites file and will definitely make it again.

The first time I made this recipe,I followed the ingredient listing exactly as it was written. I wasn't all that thrilled with the results, but I could see potential for it to be really good with some changes. I tried it again with the following amendments and the results were wonderful. For the balsamic vinaigrette: 1 clove garlic, minced, 1/4 t salt, 1 t dijon mustard, 1 t honey, 2 1/2 T balsamic vinegar, 1 1/2 T extra-virgin olive oil. For the salad: 1/4 C pine nuts, 4 oz pancetta, 1/2 lb red cabbage, shredded,1 10 oz bag baby spinach. with these changes, the dressing had some real character and the cabbage didn't overwhelm the spinach. This way, the recipe deserves a 4 fork rating and I'm passing it along to some friends of mine. I will definitely make this one again.
