Wonderful, easy, delicious. Served with Israeli couscous, mesclun salad with dried blueberries, toasted walnuts, gorgonzola, honey/fig-infused white balsamic vinaigrette and a California merlot.It stewed stovetop for almost three hours.

Straightforward (jarred chestnuts are great!) and delicous. Used a boullion cube and Mucscadet wine, but the fresh sage was essential for this prepration. My family (including a carrot-resistant husband) loved it!

When I found an ancient, freezer-burned package of veal stew meat in my fridge, I had very low hopes for turning it into anything, but I hated to throw it away. Found this recipe, and give it a go--the meat looked funky at first, but after cooking, it was tender and tasty--I will not only make this again, but will do so for my New Year's supper next week! Feel free to use precooked chestnuts. (Who can face the peeling?) I did, and they were just wonderful--such a nice combination.

I just made this dish and it turned out fabulous. The only complaint I have is that I mashed the chestnuts and the flavor is very very faint. Maybe because they were jarred and not fresh? I made the whole recipe until you are supposed to add the carrots, put it in the fridge overnight, and then added the carrots and finished it up tonight. Made the prep much easier. My whole family enjoyed it! (including a picky 2 yr old)

I love this recipe, but 3 T of sage is over my limit. I find this suits our tastes much better with about half as much sage. Also, I like to double the liquids to have more sauce to go over the risotto or garlic mashed potatoes that I like to serve with this.

Outrageously Delicious! I've made this with veal, lamb, and beef omitting the chestnuts. We are carrot lovers so I more than double the amount. This has become our stew "go to" recipe!

Delicious. Even my husband, who doesn't like stews, loved it. I used jarred chestnuts from Williams Sonoma which considerably cut down the prep time. My only complaint is it's very expensive to make (but worth it, i think!).

I did use chestnuts from a jar and they were delicious. I prepared the dish up to the point of adding the carrots the day before in order to let the meat cook longer and this also made getting it ready for dinner the next night quick and easy.

This dish is stellar- it never disappoints and is easy if you get the chestnuts in a jar!

Very yummy. I took another reviewers advice and doubled the chestnuts. Next time I won't. For my tastes less is more with chestnuts I learned. I think next time I will also try with red wine instead.

Excellent. I didn't have veal, so I used beef stew meat, and substituted red wine for white. I was a little short on carrots so I threw in some parsnip to make up the difference. If I have to substitute beef again, I might try using rosemary instead of sage (the sage was great, though). Easy to make, and you can roast and peel the chestnuts in advance, as I did.

I have made 2 batches of this stew one with veal and one with venison. Both were delicious. I like the Chestnuts mashed up a little. It thickens the sauce and ensures you will get a little chestnut with each bite, wonderful!

Great recipe - making it for the third time. This is a seasonal favorite when fresh chestnuts are available - nothing like the flavor of roasted chestnuts (although they take some effort). Served with pumpkin risotto to rave reviews.

This stew has a wonderful flavor. My husband is not a fan of chestnuts, so I serve them warmed on the side as a garnish.

I made this for as a quick meal for guests, and it was delicious, easy and something different.

Outsanding dish!!! Made it for my parents and now my dad wants my mom to make it for him. Served with Mashed potato casserole and a mesclun salad with roasted red peppers, black olives, feta cheese and citrus basil fat free dressing.

Delicious and different, and very easy, if you use Williams & Sonoma's peeled chestnuts (I added a few more than the recipe called for). Served it with pilaf and steamed sugar snap peas and it was a lovely and elegant dinner. This would also make a good buffet dish as it's pretty resilient.

This is an outstanding and simple recipe with great flavor. As I chose to make this as an end of winter dish, the stores were out of fresh chestnuts so I settled for a jar. Can't be beat!

I have made this dish many times. It works equally well with less expensive beef stew meat. Not as subtle, but every bit as hearty.

This was delicious. I used considerably less veal than the recipe called for (about one pound) and added more chestnuts (about 30). I also added more wine and stock. A great dish for winter.

I had a lunchen and prepared this dish for my 3 friends. One year later they are still talking about it. It was so easy and so good, I prepare it often.

This never fails to draw raves! I use canned or jarred chestnuts (much easier!) Serve with noodles or rice.
