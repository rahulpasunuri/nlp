Simple and tasty recipe. Made with turkey breasts and came out great. Served with lemongrass coconut rice.

The combination of the chicken broth and the coconut milk gave the Thai Red Curry Base a perfect balance for the heat in this recipe. The lime smoothed out the edges of the sauce.

Very tasty - I used green curry paste from a local food market that specializes in ethnic cuisine. Because we love sauce, I doubled the sauce ingredients and added a red bell pepper to the onions/curry paste. Served with steamed vegetables and rice, with sauce over everything. The sauce is very similar to the jade green curry we get at our local Thai restaurant, but I prefer the chicken breasts cooked at home over the few little tidbits of chicken they serve us. Extremely easy to make; I am sure that this recipe can be modified in many ways to please different palates, but as is, it is quite good.

Wonderful recipe! I used Patak's curry paste. The sauce was thin due to my addition of a whole can of chicken broth, but the overall taste was great. I will make this again and again!!

Great basic curry recipe! Doubled the lime juice, added most of the coconut milk from the can, and added some extras: whole red chili peppers (1 chili=mild 2=medium 3=spicy!), bamboo shoots, 1 or 2 lime leaves, little bit of lemongrass, two onions. Also marinated the chicken (which we diced) in the curry paste beforehand. Served over jasmine rice.

I love this recipe I make it for my boyfriend all the time. I also took tips from other reviewers and add garlic and cinnamon for more complexity. It's an easy dish for a curry fix :)

these were very good. I used a green curry paste and it went well with the chicken.

Tasty. I cooked the chicken in raw coconut oil and I use "thai kitchen red curry paste" - It comes in a small jar. I also added extra ground coriander, cumin, garlic, and lime leaves, and shredded a carrot into the mix.

This was my first experience making a curry of any type.My Wife however loves the stuff.She ussually uses an Indian recipe.However she went back for seconds of this recipe.I used this recipe for a baseline,sauteing celery,carrot and onion.Then adding bamboo shoots and some peanut butter. Love food and love to cook this was a wonderful change. Thank you Glen

This was terrific. I 'doctored' it up with some freshly grated ginger in the saute and used shallots instead of scallions. At the end, I threw in a handful of fresh cilantro.

I want to thank all the previous reviewers for their seasoning suggestions. I added bay leaf, cinnamon, ground ginger and garlic - and a handful of Trader Joe's Jumbo Raisin Medley. I used Trader Joe's Light Coconut Milk, which is thick as whipping cream. The sauce thickened up nicely but it took more than the two minutes specified. Served it over green tea soba. This would probably be good with any tasty hot Indian Relish, such as vindaloo, garlic pickle, or hot tomato relish. Browse at pateks.com and see what ideas come to you. Next time I might add whole cashews to the dish as well.

I made this and everyone raved. Following advice from other cooks, I added garlic and lots of fresh cilantro.

Based on the recipe given this dish is nothing special. It does however give you a great base to work with. I used many of the suggestions given by other reviewers such as: more coconut milk, use cinnamon stick, bay leaf, ginger, garlic, lime juice and zest and definately use dark meat, like chicken thighs. I also used Yellow curry paste and curry powder and it came out great. After all of these modifications, the final dish is wonderful, you can also adjust the heat as needed. Served it with jasmine rice and sauteed baby bok choy - excellent. This sauce would also be wonderful on a piece of fish.

Rating: 2
I would make this again with the same modifications but on it's own it is pretty plain. I sliced the chicken added and when the sauce thickened I added chopped chilies, mint, basil and cilantro and fresh coconut. I definitely don't think 2 tsp of chili paste is too much. I served with stir fried veg. in peanut sauce and steamed rice. A fast and delicious Tuesday meal.

In the case of this recipe, it is a great boon to read the comments before making the dish. Just reading the recipe, you might not understand that this recipe functions best as a base recipe for Thai-style red curry chicken. As such, it's a great base, but it definitely wants something if you make it according to the recipe and don't add anything special. I added freshly grated ginger (1 inch) and peanut butter (2 tbsp) and made a double recipe of sauce. I cut the amount of chicken stock by about half because my coconut milk was pretty thin. The sauce wasn't quite spicy enough so I added more red curry. (I found my red curry at a regular supermarket in an area with a high percentage of Asian residents - maybe one from an actual Asian food market would have been better/stronger.) I wished I had some fish sauce to add when I finished, but it was still a pretty good product. Next time, I won't add the peanut butter (or will cut in half the ratio maybe) and will add fish sauce, steamed & cubed butternut or acorn squash, julienned bamboo shoots, julienned carrots, and Thai basil. Overall, this is a good recipe as long as you remember to personalize it.

I make Thai curry dishes all the time, and it always amazes me when I read recipes that call for 2 tsps of curry paste (and most recipes do) because it's just too much. I always cut way back, using 1/2 to 1 tsp. curry paste, with 1 large can of coconut milk. Then it's fine, just the right amout of heat and flavor. I hope other people will try this recipe, which is actually quite good, but just cut way back on the curry paste.

A memorably bad meal--way too hot for my friends and me to eat. You know there's a problem when your guests are digging into the plain steamed broccoli and leaving the chicken on their plates! I agree with the person below who said that it must all come down to the brand of red curry paste used. If I were ever to make this again (and let's face it, I won't) I'd start with much less curry paste.

This is a THAI curry NOT an Indian curry. They are completely different!

Thai food is our very favorite dinner-out meal. I made this recipe exactly as printed. Let me tell you, the two teaspoons of curry paste nearly blew my head off. I added the rest of the can of coconut milk, then added an additional can of coconut milk. We just spent a month in Thailand and I can tell you this original recipe is definitely NOT a Thai dish by any stretch of the imagination. I threw out the recipe - it simply cannot be saved by any amount of tweaking.

Rating: 2
I would make this again, but I would change it a bit. It definitely doesnt make enough sauce, especially if you simmer it like one cook suggested. Up the quantities for the sauce so you use the whole can of coconut milk. I simmered with potatoes as suggested and therefore dont recommend browning the chicken first. It would stay more tender and pick up more flavor if just simmered until done in the sauce. I also added red pepper and some finely chopped serrano chilies and it was still on the bland side.

I am thrilled that I can cook Thai cuisine! I am definitely glad I decreased the curry paste though as even with the smaller amount, it definitely had quite a quick. Oh, and I also added cooked cauliflower as an additional ingredient.

Although very easy and quick, the onion flavor overpowered, next time I will lighten up on the onion and sautee them much longer...I still can't get the flavor out of my mouth.

Good basic recipe. Found it to work better when I cubed the chicken, added some peeled potatoes, and let it simmer for about 30-45min. We also enjoyed it more with the whole can of coconut milk and added broth.

Rating: 3
An excellent dish. Next time, I would increase the amount of sauce I made so that the whole can of coconut milk was used. I also found the amount of curry too hot. I would suggest using a quarter teaspoon and adding more later if necessary.

Easy to make, also with ordinary curry paste. Using chicken on the bone adds to the flavour.

I like Thai food but this was my first try cooking it. I used green Thai curry paste instead of red, and served the sauce over the chicken as well as over drained, boiled yams. I doubled the recipe. It was easy, very fast and delicious. I'll try red curry the next time just to compare.

We're a bit tame in our household, so I cut the curry paste in half and served it with a coconut ginger rice. We all enjoyed it.

I must admit that I've not tried this recipe. However, just reading it makes me think that it would not be very good. I make my own Thai currys and they vary from batch to batch since I add all ingedients to taste. For instance, I would first saute cut raw chicken with yellow onions until browned. I would then, for example process the following (assume substitutes for the real Thai ingredients): garlic, fresh ginger, anchovy paste, fresh cilantro, dried red hot peppers, and lemon and lime rind along with fresh lime and lemon juice. To the sauteed chicken, I would then add coconut milk, fish sauce, soy sauce, and the processed ingredients listed above. This, I would allow to simmer and the last 5 minutes I would add many green onions, sliced in one inch segments, and an assortment of vegetables such as red peppers and bok choy.

This dish was absolutely deliscious. I followed Virginia instructions and added her suggested ingredients, along with about a pound of sliced chanterelle mushrooms. Mushrooms were added during the glazing stage. Twas perfect.

The liquid needs to be thickened, and possibly add some more spices; but the recipe is a great starting point. Will definitely make it again.

This recipe was amazing EXCEPT i used mild curry paste and substituted coconut ginger soup instead of the coconut milk. I also added a little flour to thicken the sauce up. EXCELLENT!

With so many great recipes for curry out there why would anyone subject themselves to this mundane recipe?? Any curry recipe that says any old curry mix will do should set off an alarm that it will stink. Look for a recipe that is closer to the Ceylonese contributers changes to the recipe or, at least one that acknowledges that all curry spices are not equal. Blah! Shame on Bon Appetite!

Rating: 1
I am married to a Ceylonese man and I must say that this recipe lacks all of the ingredients that classify (curry). I would add cinnamon stick, cloves, garlic, fresh ginger root, and bay leaves to the onions. (Take the cinnamon, bay leaves and cloves out after cooking.)THIS will add the flavor you need. Substitute boneless chicken thighs for the breasts since they do not dry out and also add flavor. Cook the chicken in the onions, this will also infuse the meat with the flavors above. I think that these additions will help this recipe.

The recipe was a great base. I live in the ' Caribbean so I used fresh dry coconuts (which was grated, some water added then strained). I added patatoes and a little garlic. I made it for a group of four so i doubled the ingredients. But with the coconut I added an extra cup. Not too hot for the children because of the extra coconut milk. I also used regular dried curry which was spicy but not hot. great recipe.

Consider us the wimps someone else mentioned. We ate it all but felt it was all heat and not enough flavor.

Following other reviewers' advice I made this dish with some peanut butter, red and green peppers, and garnished it with toasted cashews. Despite this, it was still bland and in need of something. Following many Thai recipies I have made before, I decided to add some brown sugar (approx. 1 Tbsp) and some fish sauce (probably 2 tsp.). I also added extra curry paste, extra lime juice, and thinned the sauce with both extra broth and coconut milk. These additions helped considerably, but it was still not up to par with other Thai curry recipies I have tried. I'm not sure what else would make this as yummy as I hoped it would be.

Disappointing. Still missing something EVEN after taking suggestions to add vegetables and roasted peanuts. I think it needs some sweetness. Aside from being hot, I thought it LACKED flavor.

Great recipe but needs changes - I added a tbsp of peanut butter and little bit of water to dilute the chicken broth (it also makes more sauce). To serve, sprinkle dish with roasted peanuts.

I made changes to this recipe since I didn't have any red curry sauce in the pantry. I used regular curry powder, and added 1/2 tsp each: garlic pwdr, ginger, and 1/4 tsp each pepper& cayenne pepper.I halved the lime juice and added reg. vinegar. (don't like lime much) I also added the whole 14 oz can of coconut milk to increase the sauce which I put over brown rice and veges. Very good. Kids under 6 didn't approve though - too spicy,& don't like the saucy type foods. Very very good, but I don't know if my changes changed the original recipe too much to consider this a rating-!

This was an easy and tasty weeknight dinner. The red curry gives it plenty of kick (almost too spicy!), but I still felt that it needed an extra "something." I'll try adding one or more of the following next time: roasted peanuts, coconut flakes, ginger, shredded carrots...

Thai red curry paste really must vary in heat. Neither my husband nor myself were able to eat it, it was so spicy. I ended up pouring some of the sauce out and adding more coconut milk. Although it was very quick and easy to make, it seemed like it was missing something.

Make 2 separate batches for parties: the first is mild, the second is hotter. This way, people can determine the degree of oral stimulation they require and desire. Quite delicious. The cook adds or withholds the spices to determine the "heat." Bon apetit.

Gosh, I'm normally not a joiner. I returned to this fabulous recipe to e-mail it to friends and couldn't let the last review stand without comment. This recipe is easy (and so, so good you see) that I would eat it anywhere. It's warm, but could be even warmer. The flavors play like fine wine. Can't say enough about it. It's a keeper and a repeater.

After reading previous reviews of this recipe in which people say they had to add more curry since it wasn't hot enough, all I can say is "Wow!" My boyfriend and I must have really wimpy tastebuds, because I made the recipe using Thai red curry paste and we thought it was WAY too hot. Our mouths burned so much, we couldn't really taste any of the flavors. From now on, I'm going to stick with my favorite recipe for Curried Chicken from the Jan. 99 issue of Bon Appetit, adding just a touch of the curry paste for warmth, not scorching heat!
