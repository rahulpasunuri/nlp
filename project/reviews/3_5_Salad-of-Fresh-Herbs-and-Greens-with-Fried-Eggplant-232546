My friends and I made this for our Gourmet Dinner Club. It was fantastic! The greens were amazing and the eggplant made for a unique dish. I would absolutely make it again!

I left out the sorrel, arugula and increased the amount of spinach and it was a hit! Very pretty dish!

I made this salad (minus the optional sumac and chervil) for dinner guests, and served it as a side dish with grilled steaks and a grape tomato salad, and it was wonderful. The guests raved, and they are real "foodies", so it was a true compliment to this recipe.

reminds me of summer luncheons on the island of Bourgaz,Turkey.
