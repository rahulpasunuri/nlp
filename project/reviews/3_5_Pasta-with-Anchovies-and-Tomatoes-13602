DEE - LISH!!!! The person who recommended restricting the salt at the end is correct; it could push it over the top.

I don't think I would add any additional salt since this recipe includes capers, prosciutto and anchovies. I also think I'd add extra tomatoes and parsley. Overall it was very good. Even my five year old loved it.

I loved this, and my kids did too. The anchovy just depth to the flavor. Don't omit! This pasta is good hot,it's good cold and it's good reheated in the microwave. I make a batch of pasta every week to leave in the reifrigerator for my kids to eat whenever they get hungry. This is one of their favorites.

I love anchovies and this is similar to the Putanesca pasta sauce, which is my favourite. This was a popular recipe and we'd make it again.

So quick, easy, and good! We, too, added Kalamatas, and I used anchovy paste instead of anchovies. Will try it tonight with anchovies.

I thought this recipe was very tasty and super easy. However, given the previous reviewer's comments, I made the following modifications: used 3/4 lb pasta, used 2 cloves of garlic, added a handful of kalamata olives. Also, I don't eat meat so didn't add the prosciutto. I think even making the recipe as-is, it would be very good.

Made this dish for a dinner party, fair but wouldn't make it again. It was bland, seemed to be lacking something.
