Just okay in my book. With the great ingredients and reviews I expected a WOW! I love gratins but thought this recipe was bland and not particularly creamy. For one thing, all the cheese is on top and it should be layered into the gratin. The crusty top was good but below that - potatoes.

i loved this recipe. it is definitely a keeper for me. Great twist on Au Gratin potatoes, with an awesome kick from the Poblanos. I have tried several Au Gratin recipes and this is the best I've tried. Another great twist for these potatoes is to serve them the next day on tortillas with eggs, beans or any variation thereof...the poblanos and cheese with the potatoes are great for breakfast tacos!

this potato dish has become a staple at all of our holiday meals, and it's easy enough that we often have it for any winter-time special occasions. funny story: the first year i was going to make it, i sent my husband to the store to pick up the ingredients. he is not the cook in the family, and he misread the list and bought 35 POUNDS of potatoes (he saw that I needed 3 1/2 lbs, and misread as "31 lbs"... Then, he wanted to surprise me by peeling them as a headstart before I came into the kitchen. We had enough potatoes to feed every hungry belly in a 100 mile radius. The story is legendary in my family, and we retell pretty much every year.

Family loved this, with a few changes. Increased garlic, charred 2 poblanos and 3 jalapenos, and toasted and coarsely cracked about 2 Tsp cumin seeds which I layered in with chiles and cilantro. Solid side dish, with enough flavour to stand up to a spicy main.

I was surprised at how uninspired this dish tasted even though I love all of the ingredients. It's like there's no synergy (yeah, that's a wonk word but it fits here). Used suggestions from reviewers who seemed to have found the secret for making it work but to no avail. I won't be making this again.

This is a favorite and always well received by company. If you don't want to roast the chilies,just pop open a can of mild green chilies and use those.

This was a winner - used a lot of salt & pepper as suggested by other reviewers - delicious!

Tired of standard gratin potatoes, I served this with Christmas Eve dinner to rave reviews. I only used 2 poblano chilies and added some chopped jalapeno instead. I also used a hot pepper Monterey Jack cheese and added cayenne pepper between each layer with the salt and pepper. Make sure not to exceed the layers, I followed this to a T and still had some overflow in the oven. My substitutions made this pretty spicy and over the top, but then again, I am a native New Mexican. You could do this recipe without any variation and I think it would still be fabulous.

This was a HIT!! I salted every layer and also put Cayenne and Chopped garlic on every layer. When doing the layers half the Chilies and cilantro to end up with the potatoes as the last layer.

This excellent side dish had the right amount of kick for us. Having 3 prolific Santa Fe chile plants, I too used those for this recipe -- ten of them, 5"-8" each -- as did the cook from Oakland. I added a large pinch of cayenne to each potato/chile layer and substituted a Mexican cheese called oaxaca for the two cheeses in the original recipe. Delicious served with a chicken from the smoker.

Really great. Rich, tasty, flavorful. I plan to make again and again.

This was great, and I could see making it the day before and finishing the day you serve. Halfed the recipe with no problem. I salted each layer, but it still could have used more. I'll be a little heavier-handed next time but will definitely make it again.

I thought this dish was fantastic & so did my Thanksgiving company, it was eaten right up! I did add extra poblanos, from the suggestion below. This recipe is a keeper.

I was about to give up on this recipe having shared the surprisingly bland experience with NC...but this year I doubled the poblanos and accidentally added all of the cilantro during the layering (3/4 cup) even though I was cutting the recipe in half. I still topped it with more at the end. Also the market(s) were out of anejo so I used the Romano which after 3 tries on this recipe I highly recommend as well as salty chicken broth. It is really better if made the day before and cooked for 1 hour and then reheated the next day for 15 min then topped with cheese and cooked 15 to 30 minutes more. It was INCREDIBLE. I will definitely make this again and again.

I've made this dish several times for guests and they always have raved about it and asked for the recipe. Easy to make and very rich.

Everyone raved about this dish at our last Holiday gathering. I added a sweet onion to the layers. I used 2 cups colby jack instead of monterey for color and added another 1/4 cup of strong romano. I layered the cheses as well. When I removed the foil tent, I baked another 10 minutes before adding the final cheeses for crispiness. I also added a pinch of jalepeno.

I've made this dish so many many times. It is always so good. However, I have found charring and peeling the chilis to be unnecessary. I use 5-8 Santa Fe chilis, (the very pale green ones). I stem, seed and chop them, no peeling. And I only use Monterey Jack. Once I forgot the cilantro, and the gratin was still wonderful. I highly recommend this dish! Happy cooking!

This recipe has found a permanent home on my entertaining menu. I have made it for many people and recommended it to even more. I think it's excellent as written, but it would be easy to play with the flavors depending on your taste.

We made this recipe for Thanksgiving last year to go with our Cajun style Fried Turkey. It was surprisingly bland - don't know what went wrong
