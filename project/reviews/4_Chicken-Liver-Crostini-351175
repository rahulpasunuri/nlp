This was a hit in our house! I thought it would be more saucy, so may use more liquid next time. Topped of with a drizzle of truffle oil.

This was very, very good. I've never prepared chicken livers (or any other livers) before but I had no problem with the recipe. I made this for valentine's day dinner for my husband and we made a large dent in it. The leftovers were good for a few days afterwards.

Deelish! I also added 2 minced cloves of garlic as well as 4 chopped crimini mushrooms. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These were very good, and my family liked them a lot. It was also very convenient to be able to prepare them ahead of time. I might cut back on the capers a little bit next time.

This is a delicious recipe. I doubled the amount of liver to 1 pound- but stayed true to other amounts. I substituted dry white wine for the Vermouth, as I didnt want the result to be sweet. I added one pressed garlic clove. Next time Ill use 2 cloves and add more pepper flakes (or my favorite Belizean hot sauce).

This is fantastic, I wanted to eat the whole bowl myself. Even the kids liked it.

I always saute the chicken livers while the chicken is raosting - I put them in a small cast iron pan with butter and chop them as they brown. They are actually quite delicious with just a little salt and pepper, served on a cracker with cream cheese. Sometimes I go the extra yard as in this recipe, but either way, yummy! Just keep the pan on low, because you want the warmth to melt the cream cheese!

These are so-o-o good. I made a double batch as a new year's eve appetizer, and they disappeared as fast as I put them out. Even people who claimed not to like chicken livers were going back for second and third pieces.

Very easy and quick. I found it needed more pepper flakes. After assembling we kept them warm in the oven for a short time with no adverse consequences. My husband and guests loved it. Will definitely make this often for guests.
