Outstanding! I use toasted walnuts instead of pine nuts and serve as a side dish with linguine. Whoever said it was "bland" must have dead taste buds.

I served this with grilled shrimp and grilled bread, it was amazing. I roasted the garlic with the peppers, left out the pine nuts and used about half the whipping cream.

The sauce was tasty, but a bit too rich. If I make it again I would definitely cut back on the fat--half and half instead of whipping cream, for starters! My dh thought the toasted pine nuts overwhelmed the flavor, but I love pine nuts so that didn't bother me. He would have preferred them sprinkled over the top instead. I'd say I would be making too many modifications to feel like I was making this recipe again--I'd be making something inspired by this recipe, but not the same at all.

Besides roasting/peeling the peppers, this sauce was a snap to make and got good reviews served over grilled tilapia and pasta. I doubled the garlic; the leftovers were even tastier than fresh!

Our family is lactose intolerant. I made the recipe using plain soy milk and it worled very nicely. If you want a thicker sauce, use less than the 1 cup the whipping cream calls for and adjust to your liking.

This sauce is delicious! I, too, left a portion of the pine nuts whole for crunch and texture. Only thing I added was a bit of crushed red pepper and freshly ground black pepper. I poured it over large pasta shells stuffed with the remaining mixture I had left from the "Scallops Cakes with Cilantro Lime Mayo" in the April Bon Appetit issue (should be on this site soon). We both agreed we liked the scallop mixture better in the pasta than as cakes. After baking I topped with shells with addt'l parmesan and broiled until golden brown - yummy!!!

I don;t use the pine nuts, but add a healthy shot of Tabasco sauce at the end. It can be reheated, but on a low slow flame.

I was not as impressed with the flavor as I hoped, but my guests loved this sauce! I served a big Italian buffet and almost all of the sixteen people said that this was their favorite dish. I have to remember that most people don't like sauces as spicy as I do. Obviously, this was one of those cases where a rich flavor didn't need more.

I love this sauce! Unfortunately, it doesn't reheat well, so plan to use it all when you make it.

We have been making this recipe since we saw it 1998! It is always great, you can use 'bottled' peppers in oil too, and this is a good marinade for shrimp too.

Very tasty! Unfortunately I "over-toasted" my pine nuts (ok, I burned them, oops!) so I toasted some walnuts & used them. I thought it was very good, the sweetness of the peppers really came through. I pureed all the ingredients in the food proccessor to get a smooth texture. After I added the cream & simmered it, I let the cream reduce to thicken the sauce. raves from all, & it is very versatile

Fantastic! If you don't have time to marinate the scallops for 3 hours, it will still be good (though, obviously, more marinating is better).

This recipe was so easy! I used baby bell peppers, and they roasted fast. I left on some of the skins -- it didn't affect the texture too much. And I substituted walnuts. I'm not big on peppers, but I love this. Will definitely make it again.

Very good. Used half and half to cut some calories and added enough cayenne pepper to give it some kick. Will serve with lobster ravioli.

This is a good sauce even if you do omit the cream. It stands on it's own well without it. This is also a great use for too many red peppers in the garden. Great, easy, quick way to make them into a pasta sauce. I will make this again, without the cream, and simply serve on pasta as a side dish. Don't let the reviews scare you. Just try it and then make your own variations mext time. Enjoy!

It is a good recipe but for the calories and fat I would rather make something else. It is a very rich dish.

I wanted a sauce for potatoes tapas style, and this was close to one at my fave tapas place... I used almonds (so does the tapas place). I will make it again, for my next tapas party, but I will use sourcream, I think, to make it thicker... if you're lazy like me, the peppers in the jar save much time.

Excellent sauce, served with the fettucine and scallops as recommended. I used jarred roasted peppers for the sauce, which made the recipe more manageable than fooling with fresh, and tasted and looked just fine. I didn't add cream or any dairy enrichment of any kind, and it was just fine without.

Substituted pecans for pine nuts, and that was quite nice. Used whole milk instead of cream. Overall, I suspect that there is a typo in the recipe, because if you add 1 C cream to all that stuff, you'll produce significantly more than 1 C sauce. We found that the milk tended to overpower the red peppers, leaving the sauce bland. We ended up throwing in a few extra peppers and some dried chipotle powder (available from www.penzeys.com), producing acceptable results.

I omitted the pine nuts as I didn't have them on hand. Still delicious! Vlassic now makes broiled red bell peppers in a jar; taste great and a huge time saver. I used one jar. I would roast the garlic next time. The raw garlic was too overpowering for the delicate flavor of the bell pepper. Looking forward to enjoying this recipe again!

I omitted the whipped cream, added 1/2 c ff sour cream, cut the olive oil in half, much healthier, and worked great. Next time I will leave half of the pine nuts whole

This was OK. We really prefer the red pepper sauce on this site with the FETTUCCINE WITH RED PEPPER AND BASIL SAUCE. It is much better for you and has more flavour.

I agree with the other comments of blandness, however, I added a little bit of roasted green chile to the mix and that seemed to really boost the flavor. As another cook suggested I left out the cheese and nuts I think it works much better this way.

Hearing complaints of blandness, I added some crushed ginger and some red pepper flakes. I also didn't grind up the pine nuts with the peppers and cheese - I wasn't making pesto after all! And instead of whipped cream I used yogurt cheese, the kind you make by draining yogurt until it's somewhat firm. Over spinach fettuchini and sauteed chicken breasts, it was really good!

Yum. Everyone wanted the recipe. If jarred or canned peppers are used it's very easy. I rinsed them off before processing because they taste a bit salty. Fresh peppers are a bit more work but are so much sweeter Everyone wanted the recipe.

I used fine ground walnuts, served it as an appetizer to 25 men. It was a big hit!

Sauce is indeed very good but like some other posts here it is somewhat bland. Sauce this bad for you should taste *much* better. Perhaps adding some hot sauce or cajub spices/pepper would make it have some kick. I also dropped the nuts because I didn't see what they'd add to the dish. Made the sauce for the linked scallop dish.

This is the easiest and most flavorful sauce I've ever made.

The pine nuts made it too chunky and did not add any flavor. Go with a roux or reduced cream and to thicken instead and add a little Marsala. It tasted much better the second day. I would make it again--toast the pine nuts and toss them with cooked orzo and then put the sauce over.

I love this recipe! The aroma that results when all the ingedients are blended is just amazing. I served it with a full bodied pinot noir.

This sauce is rally good. Easy, too. Guests think I slaved all day to make it. For a different twist, I have also used this on pizza (minus the heavy cream). Spread on pizza dough, top with a little cheese. Excellent!

This sauce is absolutely wonderful. I have made it many times and always receive lots of raves. I just serve it on fettucine, but one of these days I plan on making the seafood pasta that it was intended for.
