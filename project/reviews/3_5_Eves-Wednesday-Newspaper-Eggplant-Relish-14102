I made this when it first appeared in Gourmet. My whole family loved it. I lost the issue of gourmet that it appeared in, and i am so happy that I found it!

I fusrt tasted this a few years ago when my sister-in-law made it. My remembered taste was better than what I made yesterday but I attribute that to live and learn. The base recipe is good, easy and fills a number of useful applications. It can also be frozen and freshened with vinegar according to her. I tripled the garlic and it still didn't come out as garlicky as I would like. Maybe I'll cut the sugar next time aorund.

Very easy, I liked the fact that it can be made in advance. I made this, cutting back on the sugar, vinegar and oil, added extra garlic. Also, I cut everything a bit bigger than recommended. Tastes good hot, almost like a ratatouille (minus the zucchini)-would like to try it served in a ring of couscous as a main course. Great for vegans.
