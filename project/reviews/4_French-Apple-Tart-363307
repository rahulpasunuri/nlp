Very simple and easy to make. Feel free to make Ina's pastry, but Pepperidge Farm puff pastry works like a gem here. I think I sliced my apples too thin because it was done in 40 minutes. Also added cinnamon, ground ginger and a tiny bit of fresh ground nutmeg to the sugar. It was a generous amount of sugar and I did not use all of it. The tart did stick to the parchment paper in places. I strained apricot spread and used calvados for the glaze. Maybe I'm a minimalist, but I thought there was too much glaze as well and would cut back on the amount used next time. Lastly, this is six GENEROUS servings. I think it depends on what meal the tart is following. I can see large portions if the meal is light and simple, but if you use it at the end of a Thanksgiving type of dinner, you'll easily get 10 servings. I will absolutely make this again and it will become an autumn staple in my home.

I really enjoy Ina Garten and have made many of her recipes in the past, so I was looking forward to making this tart - but ultimately found the outcome to be just okay. I think reading the opening description of the recipe by Ina made me think this would be my new fave for an apple dessert, but honestly I'm glad that I tried this out as a weeknight dessert for my family and not as a dessert for guests. This will not replace my favorite apple tart recipe which is the Apple Tart with Caramel Sauce, from the Nov 2006 issue of Bon Appetit.

This was my first attempt making a tart and it was amazing. The recipe was easy and simple to follow. I used granny smith apples but did not have the jelly or Calvados for the glaze. Instead, I used honey diluted with a tablespoon of water and warmed with a tablespoon of butter. This was delicious and the best dessert at our 4th of July celebration. Will definitely add this to "my favorites" recipes.

Delicious dessert and a pleasure to make. A pleasurable experience and made even more so by presenting it to my husband who declared, my G-d, this is delicious. I didn't have apricot jam or Calvados so substituted a good French (St Dalfour) marmalade and a little water. Perfect! Highly recommend this recipe.

This is the best dessert! The crust comes together easily and is more cookie like than pastry. Not only is this beautiful, but so delicious. I used apple jelly and Applejack to glaze. Don't skip this step, it makes the apples so flavorful. Can't wait to make this one again.

So easy; guests loved it/asked for recipe. Puffed pastry works fine for crust if you're in a pinch. I made it in a round tart pan with 2-3 layers of apple slices and it worked fine. The apricot jam/calvados is essential - for taste and presentation. I used Granny Smith apples and about 2 Tbs less sugar than recipe calls for.

stunning. Made this for New Year's Dinner and will never make an apple pie again. After a huge meal the family wanted another piece of tart because it was so good. The only downside is there is none left for my breakfast.

It was my first time baking a tart and it turned out wonderful. I used a tart pan instead of a sheet pan. The crust was little hard; next time I'll try making it thinner. Used cider together with the apricot conserve and it worked really well with the tartness of the granny smith apples. Everyone said it was amazing.

I made this last night for Thanksiving, I wanted to try something different than apple pie. I cut it up this morning and tried a small piece on the end and it was very tasty. The crust is nice and buttery and flakey, and the apples really stand out. I followed the recipe exactly minus the rum... I only had vanilla vodka so I used that :-) I think I will serve this with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side sprinkled with some cinnamon sugar, just for that traditional thanksgiving feel.

Loved it! Easy to make, beautiful formal presentation. Used about 1/3 the butter to dot on top, and maybe only 1/4 of the sugar it called for on top. Couldn't imagine it any "buttery-er" or sweeter. Used extra crust cut off from the sides to create a lattice on top.

I am not a pie and pastry whiz. I was not expecting much but this turned out perfect! I made the pastry exactly as written then used it to line one 10" round and one 4"x11" rectangular tart pans. I ended up using 5 apples and didn't have any jelly on hand (why use apricot and not apple? I don't get it) so I brushed it with some boiled cider (from King Arthur Flour) that I did have. It was perfect! I was afraid that the bottom crust would be soggy from all of the juice and butter but it was fine. I sent the bigger tart with my husband to one event and took the smaller to a different event and they all got rave reviews. The boiled cider gave the apples a nice golden brown color and intensified the apple flavor. No way would I add cinnamon to this.

This recipe made a delicious tart. I used a 10" round fluted tart pan but halved the recipe and omitted the butter on top. That may have been a bit too skimpy all around but I am shocked that this recipe is intended to serve 6 people. Not surprisingly, at that rate one serving has 600 calories! I don't advocate "diet" desserts, but this is really excessive. This recipe should yield 10-12 servings.

Simple, gorgeous, and delicious. Used rum for the glaze--if it's to your taste to add cinnamon or other flavors, fine, but I wanted this to be a French tart, not American apple pie, and enjoyed letting the apples speak for themselves.

I am surprised this recipe does not have more reviews! It is such a simple recipe, even with making your own crust, which by the way, is delicious and mouth watering. The texture of the crust is just right; a little bit flaky and crisp, and softer at the bottom of the tart. I baked mine in a round tart dish, and made three layers of apples. I added sugar, (I used 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown) cinnamon, and butter on top of each layer. The apples came out flavorful and soft. I also made the glaze with water, apricot jam, and a dash of vanilla extract (didn't have rum or Calvados). It was extremely tasty! I highly recommend this recipe to those who are intimidated by baking or are just starting off. The crust is definitely worth making and is super simple to prepare. I will definitely be making this again!

I did not make my own puff pastry-even a chef can't miss using the frozen sheets. I seasoned the apples with cinnamon and sugar, I don't measure, just to taste. Don't let the apples sit too long macerating, it will make the pastry soggy-be sure to use the Calvados and glaze. I used a pizza wheel to cut the dessert and made a quick butterscotch sauce using 8 oz. of unsalted butter, 8 oz. of heavy cream and 14 oz. of brown sugar-mix in a pot, boil for 5 minutes, whisking while it boils, chill and save--my husband adores this sauce-sauce the plate first, then place an apple square on top, a scoop of French vanilla ice cream and listen for the ooooooooooossss....
