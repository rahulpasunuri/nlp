Not nearly spicy enough. I made sure I started with pretty hot jalapeños, and you really couldn't taste them in the bread. They shouldn't be sauted that long, maybe not at all. The onions also don't really add anything, it's just not a complementary flavor (and I LOVE onions) - I'd leave them out.

This was moist, just as I thought it might be. I love moist corn bread. I used green chilies by mistake and it was still quite good. This will be the recipe I turn to for cornbread.
