Probably the best pancakes I've ever tasted. A bit time-consuming, but so worth it. The apples make a wonderful texture, and the little hit of lemon wakes up the whole thing. I made these several times when my daughter was just beginning to eat things other than purees, and she loved them. I loved that I could make a batch on the weekend, freeze some, and just heat one at a time for her during the week.

My family adores this recipe! It is a little more time consuming than run of the mill pancakes but worth the wait. I have used honey cinnamon butter instead of the cinnamon butter called for in a pinch.

This was delicious and being the fat soul that I am, I could probably eat the butter as is. I think I'd only make these pancakes going forward.

Good stuff. Pretty easy to make, apples make it super yummy, butter is fantastic and it freezes well. We don't usually use it all up, so I bring it out later for use on sweet breads.

Love this recipe. Reminds me of my time in England. I made ahead dozens and dozens for a church brunch and froze them in zip lock bags. Just defrosted in the morning and warmed for a few seconds in the microwave and then onto the warming trays. They're also great just at room temperature for a quick healthier-than-regular pancakes breakfast or snack for kids or like the recipe says for teatime.

I have made these pancakes several times and they are always a hit. They stay super moist even if you keep them warm in the oven. I substituted some of the white flour for whole wheat and added some ground flax seed and they were still delicious. Don't be scared of the super thick batter consistency...

Wow! The only problem I have with them is that they are so filling that I can't eat all of them in one sitting! I only had one Granny Smith apple so I had to use a Gala in there as well, turned out just fine.

Even the person in my family who doesn't like pancakes love these. The cinnamon butter was the biggest hit though. I make that with every kind of pancake. My only complaint is grating the apple was kind of a pain.

I've made these pancakes twice without the apple mixture and they are quite good. More milk needs to be added, particularly as the cooking progresses, the batter thickens up a lot. However, this time I made them with the apples and they are phenominal. Subtly sweet and almost creamy inside. Next I may do the whole recipe and make the cinnamon butter too!

These really didn't live up to my expectations, the apple was lost in the overpowering flavor of the lemon, and the butter, while good, smothered any strengths the pancakes might have had. Overall this left me thinking of the faint citrus smell of dawn dishsoap- good when I'm cleaning but not what I want foremost in mind when I'm eating.

Really filling but quite yummy and a change from regular pancakes. Quite easy also. The cinnamon butter is yummy although I am sure that the pancakes would also be good with maple syrup, apple sauce or any number of other suggestions.

I doubled the recipe, used pears & cinnamin instead of apples, and skipped the lemon juice & zest. Everybody loved them.

This rating is only for the cinnamon butter, which I made to go with popovers from another recipe on this site. The butter is amazingly delicious! I had to substitute Meyer lemon zest for the orange zest because I discovered midway through the preparation that we were out of oranges. No matter, it turned out great anyway. This butter would go beautifully with biscuits, toast, waffles, etc.

Grating the apples is kind of a pain, but it's worth it. My kids gobbled them down with no syrup. Amazing.

I've made these pancakes a few times. They're great! I use a combo of skim milk and lowfat sour cream instead of the whole milk. I also do not use the lemon peel--i never have one on hand, and the lemon juice itself seems to be enough. Also--these pancakes freeze VERY well. I make the whole recipe for just myself and my husband on the weekend and freeze all the leftovers to eat on busy weekdays. Butter seems to freeze well also. Enjoy!

Not worth the effort of grating apples etc., it doesn't taste much different from plain pancakes. The cinnamon butter was a hit though.

This is so good! I have recommended it to several friends already. I had it for breakfast and it was perfect. The butter is so good, save the extra for cinnamon toast or biscuits! I did not have the lemon problem other cooks had mentioned. A new Sunday brunch staple for sure!

Whoa Lemon! My husband and son refused to eat these. I didn't mind, as I find the lemon lightens up the heaviness of a batter pancake, but that much juice and zest combined with already tart apples really was a little overwhelming. The butter is essential. Next time, I may try a sweeter variety of apple, like a jonagold, and decrease the zest by half. The butter is marvelous - would be excellent on pumpkin biscuits.

This is a wonderful recipe. My 13 year old son asked me to make them again (next day), "you have to mom,there's still some of that good butter left". This would be great for a brunch or special guest breakfast. I wouldn't change a thing.
