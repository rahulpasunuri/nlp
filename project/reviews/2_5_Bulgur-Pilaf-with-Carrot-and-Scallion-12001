A very simple way of using bulgur which is just what I was looking for having never used it. I did zazz it up some with a teaspoon of curry powder because I was in that kind of mood, but this seems like a solid "foundation" recipe that you can play with very easily which I appreciate.

Nice change from rice. Didn't have scallions so just sauted a bit of onion and toasted the bulgur in olive oil, gave it a nice nutty flavor.

This is a good, basic recipe. I usually don't doctor recipes the first time around, but I needed an Asian side dish and couldn't find one that wouldn't require me to run to the store. So, I used this recipe as a base and swapped in sesame oil for the olive oil and soy sauce for the salt. It was low-key but good and very simple to throw together.

Better than the other (more complicated) bulgur recipes that I have tried from this website. I think what I liked was the simplicty of its flavors. But, it's still not quite what I an hoping for, so I'll keep searching ...
