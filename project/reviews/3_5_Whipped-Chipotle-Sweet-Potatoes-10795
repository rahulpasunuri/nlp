This was a delicious addition to Thanksgiving dinner. I added extra chipotle, and everyone loved it. We added a bit of heavy cream, as it was a tad dry, and didn't think it would hold up well to the second baking without any extra liquid.

I thought it was ok. Hub didn't like. Won't make again.

Absolutely delicious! This was the best dish I made for Thanksgiving! I don't normally eat sweet potatoes (didn't think I liked them) - but I'll eat these! I halved the recipe, made them the day before and baked them the next day - perfect! Highly recommened, for taste and ease.

I liked the combination of flavors but my potatoes were pasty and I couldn't get past not liking the texture. May try again but boil my potatoes.

I like this combo of sweet and spicy. I used canned organic sweet potato puree for convenience, and I added a few tablespoons of fresh lime and orange juices and some cumin. I don't think the butter really adds much flavor, so I'll leave it out next time.

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I will be passing it along to all my friends. The combo of flavors is great!

I also liked the flavor of the chipotle with the sweetness of the potatoes. Although next time, I will not be whipping them with the hand mixer, I felt that it gave them a mushy texture.

Very good. As most reviewers warned, add the chipotle a bit at a time, tasting as you go. And it's even more piquant the next day.

this was very, very tasty. everyone loved it... what they didn't know was how easy a recipe this is. i used 2 whole chipotles and didn't have any problem with the dish being overly-spicy. I also added in some maple syrup for some sweetness, which balanced things out nicely. i will definitely be making this next year!

Made this for Thanksgiving. What could be simpler than these 3 ingredients for a delicious side dish? The long baking concentrates the flavor and sweetness, and the chipotles add a subtle smokiness as well as spice. This is now my favorite recipe for sweet potatoes.

Didn't have the 1.5hrs to cook the sweet potatoes in the oven, so microwaved them, then followed the recipe. The combination of smokey chipotle with the subtle sweetness of the potatoes was excellent. Served them with the maple salmon on cedar from this website. A very nice combination.

Today I am making this for the 3rd time. What I have learned is START SMALL with the chipotles in abodo sauce! You can always add more after you've finished whipping the potatos. I love the taste combination of sweet, savory and spicy!

Absolutely delicioso!! The flavors blend very well together. Made this at Thanksgiving and this will become a traditional recipe. Looking forward to taking the advice of another cook and making it for a Cuban-themed party we are having this summer.

Just made these for the company Thanksgiving potluck. DELICIOUS! Will become a Thanksgiving classic for me. Took the suggestion of other reviewers and added a couple tablespoons of pure maple syrup. Definately raises this recipe from a 3-forker to a 4+forker!

We LOVE this recipe for sweet potatoes. Who cares about calories anyway??? Even if you don't like sweet potatoes, try this...you'll be a convert.

This dish got raves from my husband, who polished off every bit of the leftovers. We loved it, and will be making it again.

I didn't make this, so I won't review it until I do. I had it at a Thanksgiving potluck a while back (the person who made it told me she got it here) and haven't gotten around to trying it yet. It was DELICIOUS. I think I ate most of the dish MYSELF!

I thought this recipe was fabulous. I did add some onions that had been sauted in bacon grease, and, of course, seasoned with salt and pepper to suit my taste. The smoky flavor and the heat from the chipoltes was perfect. I love sweet potatoes prepared any way except candied, but these were wonderful.

Easy, delicious, and a bit surprising. It's a new classic for me.

My partner hates sweet potatoes. But he loves this dish. I add a teaspoon of maple sugar to add depth.

Great smokey flavor but it really needs more complexity. I've made it twice and each time it seems bland. Add maple syrup and/or brown sugar and the flavors really develop. Not worth it as written.

This is a nice departure from many of the cloying sweet potato preparations. The smoky chipotle flavor serves as a nice counterpoint to the sweet potatoes. As others have noted they're very spicy, so add the chipotles gradually to your liking.

I thought the cook from Austin mis-read the recipe. It's not 1 1/2 - 2 CANS, it's 1 1/2 - 2 CANNED chipotle peppers, which it about 1 tablespoon. A whole can would be inedible. But even just two peppers was PLENTY of heat. Also, I always cut the pepper open, and scrape out the seeds before using. I thought this dish was good, with a little more butter, a little salt, touch of white pepper and a hint of maple syrup as suggested. Thanks!

Around this household, we prefer this recipe with a bit of maple syrup or honey, to taste. Then it is a good three to four forks!

Made this last thanksgiving. My husband and I both love the flavor of chipotle peppers in specific, and enjoy eating spicy food in general, but we found this way too spicy (even w/correct measurements) and altogether not a good blend of flavors. I make a regular (white) potato mash w/these peppers which is much better--for some reason, I don't think they blended well in this dish. Will definitely not make any version of this again.

A unique and delicious way to prepare sweet potatoes. The chipotles add a wonderful spicy flavor but the potatoes can still be served with a wide range of foods-- I served it with pork medallions in pear sauce and a steamed vegetable--lovely winter meal.

I have the feeling this dish will become a staple in our family but I should confess that my first attempt was not entirely successful. I live in Texas and we like our food hot and the chipotle peppers I purcheased were in a 7 oz. can. They made a lot more than one tablespoon of paste when mashed. And I'd like to tell you that I have any skin on the roof of my mouth at this time but it would be lying. Watch those measurements!

Very easy and very good. Goes well as part of a Cuban meal with shredded pork, yellow rice, black beans. I just mashed everything up with a fork, as I don't drag out my mixer very often. I just love chipotles!

This is a great dish for those who like sweet potatoes on the savory side. The chipotles add a nice warm kick (or hot it you like). A great change of pace.

Spicy, delicious, and healthy. This dish goes well with stir-fried greens with soy sauce and sesame oil. Also delicious with roast turkey or chicken. We love it!
