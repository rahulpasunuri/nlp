This is a family favorite. As I tend to ad lib on recipes, this week was no different. The addition of key limes to the stuffing and a generous sprinkling of smoked paprika to the skin right before roasting made for a spectacular change.

This is a delicious roast chicken recipe and I'll certainly use it again. I did need to roast it for an additional 15 minutes however. It wasn't done after the 65 minutes recommended. The ginger flavor was delicious - I wouldn't skip this ingredient!

I've made this chicken about 20 times now. It is so good, that I don't even want to try a different recipe. It comes out PERFECT every time! SO DELICIOUS!

About three (3) years ago, I embarked on learning things I don't know how to do and that included, roasting a chicken. This recipe helped me and what I loved about it, is the fact that it can be done by anyone anywhere in the world. In most tropical and developing countries, rosemary and other herbs are a luxury but the use of ginger and garlic in this recipe allows the chicken to achieve the taste level and moistness it deserves. Plus, it is really crispy!

hey sounds like a great recipe but i don't really have a whole chicken so i was wondering if like it wound still be good if i did it with skinless boneless chicken breasts. I would really apritiate it if you could help me thanks

This has become my standard for roast chicken. The breast meat always turns out tender, even if overcooked a bit, and the stuffing infuses it with delicious flavors. The only change I make is to use clarified butter (ghee) instead of olive oil, as olive oil burns and smokes at those temperatures.

This was simple and incredibly delicious. This had to be one of the tastiest things I have done to a chicken. Make sure you use a shallow pan if you want to make sure it browns all over. I cooked a 3lb chicken, and agree with other comments that it should be cooked longer - it was stuffed to overflowing! Next time I make it, I will make a paste out of the ginger & garlic, and use it as a rub under the skin.

Really love this recipe. Simple to make, ingredients readily available and it's delicious. I've only one issue and it may be my oven. I would roast for an additional half hour. I will be making this recipe again and again

I was snowed in and did not have all of the ingredients, but it turned out so well, that I still had to review! I did not have fresh ginger or a lemon. Following a previous post, I used powdered ginger instead ... while I am SURE the fresh ginger is much more amazing, the powdered ginger was still great. The only addition I made was to mix unsalted butter with some herbes de provence and stuffed under the skin. Still did the olive oil and seasoning on the outside as well. The skin turned out perfect!! Followed the temp/roasting directions to a tee and it turned out perfectly! Moist but completely cooked through. Will be making regularly!

Love this recipe! I, too, wondered about cooking covered or uncovered and have tried both, which leads me to this question: Does anyone find this recipe to cause a lot of smoke from their oven? I assume that it is the olive oil burning. I am cooking in a gas oven, and have tried roasting and convection roasting. I found less smoke with a piece of foil loosely covering the bird for the 60 - 65 minute portion of the cook time, but there was still some. Any other experiences like this? All of that said...this is a big hit with my family!!! Best sb

Have had trouble with good roasting in the past, but the directions here are perfect! Make sure to leave uncovered to get a crisp, browned skin. It was unclear to me whether or not to cover the first time I tried this. I love making it with different flavors - my favorite is to use fresh rosemary and thyme in place of the ginger. Definitely a keeper!!

Simple and tasty.I would definitely make this again.

This is the best roast chicken recipe we have ever come across, even with substitutions or additions. My only comment is that we usually have to cook for much longer (+30 min?), maybe because we get smaller chickens here in France, and we stuff too much in there for it to cook quickly! Cannot recommend enough.

Just prepared this recipe with my own variations, and I am breathless! My partner exclaimed that it was the best roast chicken I have ever made, after inspecting the breasts thoroughly for doneness while carving. I kept a small pan of water in the oven out of fear of drying the bird; yet, the skin turned out beautifully brown and crispy while the meat was succulent and bursting with flavor. My adjustments: 2 lemons 4 tbsp fresh rosemary chopped, in lieu of ginger 2 tsp thyme 2 tsp garlic powder, in lieu of cloves kosher salt no olive oil Robbed the seasoning inside and under the skin, then stuffed the rosemary and lemon in. Turned out I cooked to an internal temp of 170F

This has become a wildly poplular standard in our home, prepared just as written. Crispy skin, tender meat, subtle, lovely flavors. A real winner! I am asked for the recipe constantly, yet it couldn't be easier.

Simple and easy every day chicken. Always moist! The skin turns out so crispy and salty-it even tempts me to eat a little bit. I love the mild lemon and ginger flavor the first night and the flavors are mild enough that the chicken tastes great the second time around in "leftover dishes"

I followed the recipe exactly using fresh ingredients and it tasted like an ordinary chicken dinner. I didn't even taste the garlic or the lemon or the fresh ginger. I would probably opt to make a tastier chicken next time.

The lemon, garlic, and ginger truly perfume the chicken in this simple but delicious recipe. I did not have the Hawaiian salt so I used a local sea salt. Will make again and again.

I've been routinely underwhelmed by the roast chickens I've made. They're usually lacking in any kind of interesting tastes. This is a really yummy roast chicken recipe that is not much work at all. I had a feeling this would be a hit as the lemon, garlic, and ginger are my favorite flavors. I really recommend this recipe. It is by far the best roast chicken recipe I've had.
