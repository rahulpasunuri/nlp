I never appreciate reviewers who change a recipe. Having said that I changed the recipe and am reviewing it. I am allergic to wheat so I used a combination of brown rice and spelt flours. My children are vegans so I used soy margarine and egg replacer. I did not have dried apricots so I used fresh cranberries in the batter. Instead of water I used orange juice. This was a terrific Pineapple Upside Down Cake. My guests did not guess that it was a vegan dessert and everyone asked for seconds. A definite must keep recipe.
