This was good, not outstanding. I agree that 1/2 cup olive oil is way too much. I just drizzled some on, and tossed the mushrooms.

This was very tasty, but it seems like an awful lot of oil for this many mushrooms. I have roasted many veggies and usually use just a few TBSPs of oil. When I used the full 1/2 cup here, it smoked a LOT, which has never happened with other veggies. Perhaps use less oil? Perhaps use regular olive oil, not EVOO? (my sense is that EVOO doesn't tolerate high heats as well). Perhaps lower temperature a tad? I usually roast at 475, not 500. Will try again tonight with these changes and see.

I used the basic recipe, but had to improvise with what was on hand. Portobllo, button and dried porchini. I made it as an appetizer by hollowing out 4 inch zucchini, cut in half and roasted till soft.

This was a wonderful side dish to steak. However, the next time I do it, I am going to leave the mushrooms either whole or just cut in half. They shriveled too much. Also, I did not have rosemary, so I used tarragon, and it was still great.

Roasted Rosemary with Shiitake Rocks!!! - Had to modify a bit from what my spouse left me in the frig. Mix in small bowl: 1/2cup olive oil 2 large Rosemary shoots, cut 1 inch 1 diced shallot onion salt pepper Spoon over single layer of 2 large Shiitake mushrooms, sliced 1/4 in on a cookie sheet. Cook 18 min at 400 deg broil convection (I thought 500deg was too high), stirring only twice, Side: In pan with 1 tbspn olive oil, 12 asperagus, cut 1 inch, 1/2 zuchini sliced, 2 onion greens sliced; Cook 10 min, medium heat; Serve with fresh, diced tomato for color on top, followed by a dolop of sour cream mixed with 1/2 tsp mustard & 1/2 tps horseradish. Bread: Baguette Wine: Definitely light red; I had a Nero D'Avola (Sicilian) or a Pinot Noir would be fab. Dessert: Fresh sliced pear, sprinkled with cinnamon, nuked in microwave 30 sec, with 1/2 scoop vanilla ice cream on top. Meal: To die for.

Roasting really brings out the flavor of the mushrooms. I would add fresh ground pepper before roasting, otherwise, it is a great recipe.

I didn't prepare it with the suggest menu, but did make it with a pork roast. It is a delicious, simple side.

This was great. Made it with the tenderloin.

As part of the menu with the filets in cognac-mustard sauce and spinach and roasted garlic custards, it's the perfect side dish. It's very simple to prepare and rounds out the plate.

We added some bell peppers (red, green & yellow), and used only the leaves of the rosemary so that they could be enjoyed along with the vegetables.
