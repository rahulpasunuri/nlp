so-so recipe. Cookies were buttery, but they crumbled a bit. Didn't have the problem with the press, because I had read somewhere else about freezing the cookie sheet for a few minutes--that way the cookies instantly stuck. Not much flavor besides butter, I added more vanilla and the grated rind of a lemon, chopped extra fine to fit through the press

Had NO trouble getting this through my press. Delicious! Very buttery, a little delicate for intricate shapes (wreaths)but worked perfectly with more solid shapes.

This recipe was made the best spritz cookies! I almost didn't try it because of the other reviews. I had no trouble pressing them out of my cookie press. You have to make sure the butter is good and soft. I left mine out overnight.

Made an OK sugar cookie but did not work in the spritzer at all.

The cookies are nice if you like butter, but they crumble WAY too easily. I would make them to eat at home, but not to give away.

A bad recipe. The dough would not come out of the cookie press properly.
