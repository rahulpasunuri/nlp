This is a wonderful recipe, sweet, tart & bitter all at once, & profoundly lemony. I'm always looking for more ways to use the Meyer lemons off my tree, & this pie is definitely a keeper. Changes: I sliced the lemons as I do for marmalade by quartering them lengthwise & slicing to approximately 1/8" thick, with an overnight maceration this is plenty thin enough. If they're still too big for your taste, a quick chop in the food processor after you've blended the eggs & flour together will do the trick. I used Mark Bittman's all-butter crust without pre-baking, it browned well & was crisp & flaky throughout. Give it a try, if you love lemons you won't be disappointed.

Made this for Easter dinner. I think its interesting that reviewers vary on the sweetness - some say too sweet and others say not sweet enough. I thought it was perfect. I let the lemon/sugar mixture sit for 16 hours (overnight+). We really liked it.

I did not like this. The sharp taste was unappealing and the texture was lumpy. I only let the lemon and sugar sit for 4 hours so perhaps a longer time would have brought a better pie. I would not make this again.

Made this along with two other fruit pies for a party and my guests almost unanimously preferred it to the more conventional and much more labor-intensive pies (peach and apple-cherry). I used Meyer lemons from our tree, so it wasn't as mouth-puckeringly tart as it would have been with regular Eureka lemons. My only problem was with the recipe itself: The ingredient list calls for pastry for a single crust, yet the photo and preparation instructions make it clear that this is a double-crust pie. Also, the recipe for the recommended pastry (Barry Maiden's Butter/Shortening Crust) states that it is a soft crust, better suited for single-crust pies.

This delicious pie is easy and inexpensive. My family loved it even though my daughter prefers a smoother texture and asked me to puree the filling next time. It is very sweet as written, so I reduced the sugar by a quarter of a cup. A great crust, will make or break this recipe. I will definitely make this again!

I have eaten Shaker Lemon Pie at Shaker Village in Kentucky, and this recipe is very, very close. Excellent.

This pie was absolutely delicious but very sweet. A small slice in the morning is perfect. I would suggest leaving the lemons in sugar overnight not just three hours as the lemon peel softens to a better texture. I will consider adding something next time. Either another fruit or maybe even a floral extract of some kind as the lemon is not very complex.
