I love this rice as a staple side and usually leave out the apricots and currants just to cut down on the price. I could eat this all by itself!

This was nothing special. Kind of bland. I made this as directed.

I've made this several times and have added 1/2 teaspoon of cayanne pepper to spice it up which is perfect complement to the currants and appricots. This is an amazing recipe and well worth making.

Great side dish exactly as instructed. Nice presentation, as well. I made it for a party and had lots of rave reviews.

Delicious and easy recipe. I used Apricots only and added whole peppercorns and cumin seeds. Instead of ground saffron, I used saffron leaves soaked in milk which adds a lot of depth. Served with moroccan style cornish game hens and moussaka, it was wonderful.

i've made & modified this dish several different ways [when i don't have all the ingredients] and it's always delicious. i tend to prefer it with brown basmati rice, which requires longer cooking.

Question ..? I've recently returned to USA after 35 yrs. overseas & am looking for a REAL long-grain white rice. Today, at suggestion of neighbor, used Uncle Ben's and could barely see the grains. (Never again!) Would someone please give me some Brand name info'? TX

This was "okay". Followed the recipe exactly - and while it didn't turn out bad, it was not "that" great either.

Excellent! Followed the recipe without modifications for a Christmas potluck dinner. It's a good presentation, travels well and was a big hit. I liked it just the way it was, but will play around with some of the suggestions. Looking forward to making it again!

Excellent! I was short on time to make a side dish for a Christmas potluck - this was a good choice. I followed the recipe without modificantions and it was a big hit! I liked it just the way it was, but will play around with it a little. Good side dish for just about anything - looking forward to making it again.

This recipe was liked by everyone at my table, including my mother in law that doesn't like food with flavor. Overall, very easy and great taste.

Outstanding! I made it this time with a mixture of brown rices, which added a lot more depth of flavor. Served with baked Rock Cornish Hens and sugar snap peas. The brown rice takes longer to cook, but it cooked on top of the stove while the hens baked.

I make this every time we have Jerk Pork Tenderloin. Perfect side. Everyone loves this dish. I give out copies every time I make it for guests. It also travels surprisingly well.

WONDERFUL! Have made numerous times (and given out the recipe to my guests almost as often). I use 1/4 cup almonds and 1/4 cup pistachios for the nuts, and have used golden raisins in it as well.

Yummy recipe! Very easy for novice cooks (like me) to follow. Was huge hit at my dinner party. Served this with the Chicken in Cava and it was a good match.

Delicious! I made this dish for my children's International Food Day at school and didn't expect to like it all that much myself - will definately make again.

Wonderful. Devine. Simple.

The recipe mentions roast turkey, goose or ham, but this is perfect with lamb, either a roasted leg or chops. I used flavorful and aromatic jasmine rice.

Absolutely FABULOUS! I always serve it with chicken cordon bleu and it's always a hit! I don't use the currents or apricots, just the almonds and it's raves all the way. Try this, you'll love it!

Delish! I served this with Chilean Sea Bass with a Sherried Garlic, Lime & Tangerine Chutney. It went very, very well. There was none left to pack up!

OUTSTANDING !!!! Served it with Deep Fried Turkey and it was a great addition since we had no gravy. Loved the fruity flavors and nutty crunch. Will double it and take to the next potluck. Didn't have currants so used dried cranberries. Worked great.

An unplanned dinner party last night lead me to search for quick recipes using ingredients I had on hand. This dish received rave reviews from everyone (and every single person had seconds). I substituted dried cranberries and raisins for the apricots and currants, and served it with the Spanish-Sytle Garlic Shrimp with Ham and Bell Peppers (listed as an hors d'oeuvre on this site, but it made a nice entree along with the rice.) The rice had a wonderful -- but not overpowering -- flavor and texture, and the two dishes together had a very nice combination of slightly sweet, slightly tart and slightly hot flavors. Highly recommended -- delicious, unusual, and very easy to prepare.
