Excellent----it's become one of my summertime staples, especially alongside grilled foods. I cut the avocado into a dice rather than slices, which gives it more of a relish consistency. The sugar and lime juice cool off the jalapeños considerably, so experiment with adding even more chiles. I've served seared scallops on top of this, and I've prepared it without the cilantro for certain guests----it's still tasty that way.

Awsome recipe, received raves from everyone!! I added a can of imported hearts of palm which really enhanced recipe. Dressing had a nice little kick. Will definately make again...and again!

There's better recipes for expensive avocados, and for Vidalia onions as well. About all I could say about it is it's interesting. Also, 1/2 of one lime makes 1/4 cup!

I am not an avocado fan but had one I needed to use and this salad was good. Would buy an avocado to make this again.

So simple, so yummy! I had no cilantro or jalapenos on hand, and I had to use bottled lime juice, but it was still delicious. Instead of the jalapenos, I used a bit of chili powder and some chili flakes. The Vidalia onions were great. A simple answer to: "What shall I do with this soon-to-expire avocado?"

Super salad! I used sweet Walla-Walla onions and cayenne pepper to taste instead of the jalapenos, whisking the dressing by hand instead of using a blender. A great sidedish to pork in the summer--the dressing tastes very much like that on an avocado-onion salad at our favorite Cuban restaurant. I'll definitely make this again.

Outstanding and outstandingly simple. What more could one ask?

Killer salad!!! Instead of drizzling the dressing on the avocados and onions, I gently tossed them together. A guacamole lovers dream!

This is delicious and different. I had a lot of requests to share the recipe.
