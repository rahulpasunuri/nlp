This recipe was very easy to make and surprisingly delicious. I did make a few small changes. First, because I love the taste of lemons, I used 3 tablespoons of grated lemon peel rather than the recommended 1. Also, because my mother has trouble with seeds in her teeth, I ground the anise seed in a spice grinder. Finally, I cut the pieces differently. I rolled the dough out to pie-crust thinness, then cut it in half lengthwise. Then I cut each half into 16 strips (about 1/2 inch each). To form the twists, I used two strips and wound them around each other. This method produces a total of 16 twists that are about 3-4 inches in length. While you are at it, make a double batch using the other half of the puff pastry--the egg wash will last for both sheets of pastry. I made a double batch (32 strips) and there were NO leftovers. People loved these. They are great for taking to a brunch when you don't have much time. Next time I will experiment with poppy seeds, cheese, and a variety of other toppings. This one is a keeper!
