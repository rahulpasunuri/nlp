my twelve year old will eat 3 - 4 pounds of these at a sitting. My adjustments I add a cup chicken broth, maybe a cup of water to the soup . Also a pinch of saffron. and maybe a quarter cup of chopped italian parsley after the soup is all cooked. Cook the mussels directly in this soup and serve. And i use the left over wonderful soup/broth to make a pasta with swordfish and scallops over pasta

I made this last night for a dinner party (for 9 people in total) - so thats about 3.5 kg of mussels! Mussels are in season now so its great. Everyone loved the mussels! Instead of tying the herbs in a bag for the bouquet garni, I let it all run loose. I think for the best texture/taste, I used 3 cans of tomatoes and the last pound was fresh tomatoes. Turned out to be a nice chunky sauce. I also cooked it for way longer than 30 minutes.

This was surprisingly easy to make and absolutely delicious! I would make this when having guests over if you want to impress! I replaced the celery with black olives, left out the bouquet garni and seasoned it with my own herbs from the cupboard, and used canned plum tomatoes. With my leftover sauce, I used it for pasta sauce the next day! YUM!

I would increase the onions to 2 1/2. Use 3 if you're using medium yellow onions. Double the garlic. Skip the celery. Double the oil. Bouquet garni is alright, but Herbes De Provence are much better. Excellent!

I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and added the mussel-cooking wine to the sauce along with the mussels. The dish was pretty good, but it could have been more flavorful. Also, my tomato-onion-celery mixture was too dry to simmer properly. Next time, to solve both problems, I'll add 1/2 cup of chicken stock to the tomato mixture before simmering.

This is a very easy, yet fantastic recipe. I appreciate the comments, they definitely helped my modifications to the recipe. The store was out of mussels, so I substituted clams. I followed the advice of the comments and kept the wine that the clams cooked in & made for a soupier sauce for dipping french bread, which was fantastic. I spiced it up with serrano pepper & used baby green bak choy in place of the celery.

Fairly easy to make and very tasty. My only complaint (which should be easy to amend) is that the "sauce" wasn't very saucy. It was mainly just the cooked veggies with very little liquid. I took another reviewers advice and added some of the wine leftover after steaming the mussels. That seemed to help. Served it with a fresh baguette.

We used like 5 garlic cloves and added the wine to the tomatoe sauce after steaming the mussels...Delicious! It was amazing. We used canned tomatoes. I will definitely make this over and over again.

-I would have not used a casserole dish for the mussels and instead just used a pot. And I covered the pot to make sure they all opened and got equal heat. I also used a half bottle of wine, not 1/2 cup with the mussels and clams. -I mixed everything from both pots together, that is, I didn't pour off the wine as they suggest -I added half of the wine to the tomato broth while it simmered (I didn't seem to have enough liquid) -I used 1 pound clams 1 pound mussels -I also used a ton more garlic, because I love it :) -Have lots of good bread on hand to dip into the broth

Made some mods...put in some habanero pepper, no garni (what the heck is that), 1 onion, lots more garlic, a bay leaf, fresh oregano instead of basil... very flexible recipe. Don't think you can go wrong here :) Will def make again

I skipped the celery and bouquet garnis, and added a little hot pepper flakes. I drained most of the liquid after steaming the mussels, but kept some to dip crusty french bread in - the liquor mixed with the tomato sauce made a nice sauce.

I can't figure out why they would recommend to pour out the salty goodness the mussels themselves give off, as well as the wine. Keep both in. I like my sauce thinner to lap it up with bread or noodles.

It was great, the store was out of mussels so I used some smooth baby clams. So it's not just for mussels. YUM. Everybody loved it. The stragglers loved it even when it was cold.

A great recipe with lots of time for simmering and enjoying a glass or two of wine with company. Have a good french stick to mop up the sauce!

This is great, easy and straight forward. I add the wine to the sauce and then steam the mussels. you eliminate one step and in doing so, enhance the flavor!

Not bad initially; it was better once I added wine to the sauce. I used tomato sause instead of tomato paste so there'd be more sauce and served it over pasta.

I would prefer a white sauce

An excellent dish. Next time I am going to double the tomatoes and serve it with pasta.

This was a quick, easy and delicious thing to make during the work-week. I varied the recipe slightly... I used a larger can of diced tomatoes, no celery and I also chose to add a little wine to the sauce just for that little extra pizzazz. I served a mixed green salad and some asagio cheese bread (yum!)- the meal was a huge success. I will definitely make this again.
