Like some of the other reviewers, my caramel sauce seized up to hard candy as soon as it hit the pork. Was concerned this might happen, but decided to follow the recipe. Poorly written recipe, which ought to address this issue.

A nice weeknight meal but nothing special. As my youngest son said "it tasted live every other Asian dish you make." Not worth trying again.

Attempted to make this tonight. Honestly, I never have trouble following recipes, but all I ended up with was some really pretty hard caramel candy on top of thin pork. My pork was at room temperature and I cooked the mixture exactly as specified. Not sure what I missed, but won't try this one again.

This is a fabulous, very genuine recipe. Here are some tips to help those who have had trouble with this. Please note that the recipe calls for 1/4 in thick chops. This is very thin. If you try to pound out a 3/4 in chop to 1/8 of an inch, it isn't going to happen no matter how hard you whack the thing. Either cut them in half yourself or have the butcher at the store cut them for you fresh. In dealing with this sugar, you only need to heat it until it is JUST melted. If you keep cooking it until it turns a darker brown you will have candy and not a sauce. I also don't understand the reviews that claim it takes a long time to make. If you follow the directions it comes together in 15 minutes. I serve it with steamed veg, brown rice, and a side of nuoc cham sauce, which is a snap to make yourself. Just search the internet for a recipe.

Love, love, love this recipe! Have made many times to rave reviews. This is a take on traditional "bun" that you will get in Vietnamese restaurants. I add ginger and garlic to the marinade. You must make this with the Vietnamese Rice Noodle Salad that went with the original printing in Gourmet. For that, I add chopped cucumber and bump up the sauce with sweet chili sauce and additional rice vinegar and other ingredients. Just simply fabulous and not at all bland if done as directed. I also just soak the rice noodles - they don't need more cooking. Don't leave anything out on the toppings - crushed peanuts, fresh chopped cilantro, grated carrots, green onions, cucumber, etc are all key. More prep than the recipe says but absolutely worth it! YUM!!!

It took me a long time to make this recipe (mostly to pound the loin chops thin... even then i couldnt get them to 1/8-inch) and it was not worth it. It didn't taste vietnamese at all.

my 3yo twin boys gobbled this recipe up. the key here is not letting the sugar go from being molten to scorched, and for those who haven't worked with hot sugar/candymaking before, this process happens in a matter of SECONDS. i used thin-sliced pork chops from the supermarket and didn't bother pounding it because i didn't have the time. i melted the sugar and but started stirring with a silicone spatula once i saw that some of the clear melted sugar was starting to brown (e.g., burn). the sugar became a bit lumpy but stirring prevented scorched sugar. once all the granules were melted, i allowed the sugar to turn the color of very pale honey (cooking an extra 5-10 seconds) before i added the lime mixture. the sauce turned a mahogany brown that looked and tasted just like the restaurant chops. i will defintely make this again, seeing as how i love vietnamese food but don't live near a restaurant.

I found this to be quick, easy and delicious. I have never caramelized sugar before but found it very simple. I didn't have any lime so I subbed rice vinegar and used sliced pork instead of chops. It was still very good. I only had to use a small sauce pot for the marinade, a bowl to marinate in and a pan for cooking. I don't know what happened to the reviewer who had to use every thing in her kitchen! ;-) The whole process only took 20 minutes; just like the recipe said! I think it would score 4 forks if cooked on an outdoor grill.

I thought that the problem was that the sugar may have been cooked too long & hardened fast. So even with short heat this was a mess. I ended up marinating the pounded pork in dark brown sugar & sweet garlic & chili sauce & grilling it on a gas grill. For the noodles I bought Thai Lemongrass & chili noodle box for 2 & added some extra veggies like carrots & red pepper. Perfect outstanding meal that was super quick. Do not waste your time on this one.

I followed this recipe to the letter and as soon as I dumped the caramel over the pork chops it turned to hard candy. No "tossing until well coated" was possible. What a disaster! -- had to reheat the caramel and then basically dredge the pork pieces through it before grilling. After all that the flavor was definitely not better than "okay". And "20 minutes start to finish"?? -- I don't THINK so. Will NOT be making this again.

Loved this dish, although it was NOT quick! Took forever to do the prep. But the final product was incredibly good - we made a huge batch with Vietnamese Rice Noodle Salad - perfect.

I too thought the pork was very delicious but wondered how the restaurants make theirs darker. I will try marinating a little longer or adding a touch of dark soy sauce to give a pork a more mahogany color. It was relatively easy and will definitely make this again.

I grilled the pork and also made some Nuoc Cham (Vietnamese Dipping Sauce) to sprinkle over the pork and rice. The pork was very good but the color and texture was different than the restaurants - maybe because I didn't pound it. Mine was much lighter - not the deep brown like in the restaurant. The sauce was very good and did have the same flavour as the restaurants. But it was all still quite good and I will make this again.

The family and i love this dish. the pork is nice and sweet, although it doesn't match the noodle dish, it goes nice with steamed rice and grilled vegetables.

Quick kitchen? I used every pot and pan I own, scorched the first batch of sugar, had to throw away the wooden spoon...come on now, I am a fairly experienced cook and this dish took at least an hour to put together. Clean up was longer. The caramel sauce was ridiculous. You can marinate the pork in the same ingredients with a little honey, add some sliced scallions, and the flavor is much better. I thought this recipe was a disaster.

I have made this dish twice now and my family loves the flavor. The first time I made the dish I was in a hurry and I mixed all the ingredients together and just heated enough to dissolve the sugar. I then marinated the chops overnight in the mixture. Then we grilled the chops and basted on the marinade like BBQ sauce. The second time I followed the direction exactally and had the carmelized sauce first. We will definitely make this recipe again and again.

Didn't really care for this too much, on the very sweet side and seems to be missing something but not sure exactly what.

I used tofu instead of pork and it worked great. All I did wsa toss the caramel, while it was still hot, with cubes of tofu - tasty!

this is the second time I'm making the dish. the first time, I happened to have all the ingredients on hand and it sounded interesting. We loved it! This time, we're making it for company, and instead of using a grill pan, we're doing it on the grill for another dimension to the flavor.

I rate this a three because its a bit unusual and my kids all liked it. I was a bit dissappointed with how the caramel hardened when I poured it over my pork even though my pork wasn't real cold. I may next time spoon caramel over pork when frying to ensure it isn't hard already.

seemed like more work than was worth it - not so special for me.

I'd jump it up to 2-1/2 forks. Nice dish with the salad. Takes longer to make that suggested. We'll have it again.

Delicious. Perfect for a hot summer night. Tasted just like it does in Chinatown.

Next time we are grilling outside I want to try it. I could see making it with several pounds of pork for friends. Of course with a bit of garlic and pepper flakes added to the sugar mixture. I made it as is for dinner tonight, with the exception of reducing the sauce to put on the pork when serving. Family liked it.

Yuck...it was sticky-sweet with no life at all. A complete disappointment. I will not be making this again.

I knew to add red pepper flakes to the sauce and it was still dull. The salad was limp and needed alot more flavor. It also took more than 20 minutes and I am a pretty quick prepchef.

My family loved this dish with the noodle salad. I served it with a side of blanched fresh snow peas. We felt it was a wonderful warm-day dinner - since we FINALLY have warm weather to celebrate! I added a teaspoon of chopped garlic to the pork sauce (with the scallion mixture) but otherwise prepared it just as the recipe suggested. It would be good with a bit of zing in it as well; I would probably use Chili paste or peppers. Hot sauce would work, too, but it would change the flavor quite a bit because of the vinegar in it.

This made the kitchen smell wonderful but it didn't have enough zing. DEFINITELY did not work with the cold limp noodle salad. I'd try it again if someone had any ideas on how to give it some heat. Chilies or pepper flakes? Would be great with a fatter noodle maybe egg noodle with cocoanut milk.

I thought these pork chops were pretty good, but my family did not love them. I made them with the Rice Noodle Salad shown w/them in the magazine, and the two did not go together well. These porks chops are more of a cold weather dish--serve w/roasted potatoes--not the noodles.
