Wouldn't make it again - very uninteresting flavor. Used half chicken stock and half water for this recipe.

I havent tried this dish yet it kinda reminds me of my grandma's "gumbo zaire", which consists of greens (collard, mustard or chard) seasoning (onion garlic and spices) and chicken, sausage (andouie is good) and ham hock. If you add sausage and more meat the dish should come out better.

Great soup. Couldn't find swiss chard so used 1/2 head chopped cabbage. Will make this one again.

I like vegetable soup; my husband likes barley, so thought this would be a good compromise. It really pleased neither of us. I thought it bland and uninteresting; he disliked the bitterness of swiss chard.

My goodness, just absolutely DELICIOUS! Only change, used all chicken stock (low-fat)... WOW...

Delicious! This recipe has become one of our standbys for leftover ham. We use leftover hambone instead of the smoked ham hocks the recipe calls for, and add extra chopped ham. Spinach works well if you can't find swiss chard.
