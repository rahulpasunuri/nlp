received rave reviews - cooked for a weekend dinner with 6 teenage boys - they loved it - and it was a fun meal.

I've been making this for years! I joke that it is bastardized bibimbap but I like 'bibimbap at home' better. Here are some ways to make it easier: 1. if you are going to only do some of the veggies, do the zucchini and the carrots together since they are basically the same thing. The hardest part is cutting the carrots up into match sticks, but you can cook them in the same pan on different sides. 2. The sauce is basically hoisin sauce so if you want to be lazy, buy some at the grocery store. I also like adding srirracha sauce. 3. Def. use sushi rice! Sorry to judge, but using brown rice is weird. 4. I'm not really into bulgogi so sometimes I buy a nice piece of tuna and sear it with sesame seeds. I've also done tofu on top. I guess everyone who just got mad at me for saying brown rice is weird can pile on me for not liking bulgogi now =).

I made this with all of the mix-ins for a girls night and it was a hit. Everything was super easy to make - I started marinating the beef and made the rice the day before, and the veggies right beforehand. I will definitely do it again.

We loved this dish. I made the beansprouts, mushrooms and carrots as mix-ins. Can't wait to try the others next time. Substituted chicken breast for the beef- worked just fine.

My Daughter-in-law made this for us about 6 mos. ago. I made this recipe when I received the bon appétit magazine and it was great! I have made it with pork and chicken and it was all very good. I have added it to our "gotta have" dinners!

Delicious and easy to make. It just takes a little bit of time. I used short grain brown rice and it worked out great.

This was our big New Year's Eve celebration-loved it. I would have never believed that 1 lb. of beef would be enough for 8 people, but there are so many vegetable side dishes that we barely touched the meat. We made all of the sides except for the mushrooms. Crunchy rice is our new favorite!

My daughter made this last night. She substituted eggplant for beef. It was very good, and not as complicated as it seems in the article. We ill definitely do it gain.
