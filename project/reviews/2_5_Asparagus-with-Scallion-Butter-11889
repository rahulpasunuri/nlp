Made this to go with Thanksgiving dinner, we all love asparagus. This was very good, and everyone at dinner commented the same. One thing ... it did NOT reheat well as leftovers. It picked up a bad taste - I'm thinking from the lemon maybe? So my advice is only make enough for that meal, and throw out what is not eaten!

It wasn't that it was BAD, it just had no flavor, therefore, I would not be interested in making it again.

The scallions didn't add enough flavor to cut through all of the butter. The asparagus seemed weighed down by all the butter, I prefer my asparagus a little crisper and I may have cooked them too long.

Scallions, my favorite veggie, meet asparagus, my husband's favorite veggie. Don't strain the sauce, but don't add anything to it either. Perfect as is--a quick and tasty adornment. Remember that the recipe makes way more than enough for 2 people, and use the microwave to cook the asparagus first. Great!!

Don't drain off sauce...keep it whole and add a little cream and a couple of turns of white pepper.
