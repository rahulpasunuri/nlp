I used this receipe for the chicken marinade only - it was perfect. We grilled chicken for tacos and this was just what I wanted. I left out the tequila and the cumin and marinaded the chicken for about 6 hours. Everyone loved it. We used just- picked limes and you could really taste the flavor in the finished product. Definitely will make again.

I have used this recipe for years, but not for the burritos, just for the marinade. I omit the Tequila and I love garlic, so I add a bit more. Any guest I've ever served it to has raved about it. I always barbecue it and make extra to freeze so that I can pull it out at a moments notice, defrost it and add it to tossed salad along with fresh avocado. It's fantastic!

Nothing truly special about these. The marinade was not flavorful -- maybe a different marinade would make these pop.

I was in the mood for some "real" burritos, so I made this with the following modifications: I charred the red and yellow bell peppers first, and smoked one ear of corn, one yellow squash and one zucchini squash in a stovetop smoker, sliced them all up and added a drained can of black beans and rolled it all up. It was fabulous!

We thought this was good but not a "keeper". Don't be afraid of the tequila. You can't taste it at all.

I marinated the chicken for 6 hours but flavor was bland. Was not impressed with dish.

Way too much oil. This marinade makes enough for twice as much chicken which I added and STILL way too much oil. Overall flavor was good though even without the tequila since I had non on hand. Would make again using less oil.

This has to be our faviorte Epicurious chicken recipe. We tend to make it more often in the warmer weather while we sip Margaritas. We just love it!

I tried this dish for a group of friends but didn't want to make burritos. So I cooked the chicken ahead of time and put in a baking dish, then topped with the chilis and cheese. Just before serving I warmed up in the oven and served with Spanish rice. Wonderful dish. Flavor came out great and will make again and again.

I marinated the chicken in a plastic bag for a day (8 hours). Wasn't too impressed with flavor, perhaps needs to marinate overnight... The overall dish wasn't too exciting. I sliced the chicken for easier rolling and eating.
