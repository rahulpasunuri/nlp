Delicious recipe and very different. Everybody loved them. I used grouper and for the aioli I used the regular smoked Hungarian paprika, since I did not have the hot one, and added more cayenne pepper, few drops of liquid smoke and 3 drops of Tabasco. I started with 1 cup of mayo instead of 1.3/4 cups and adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly. Definitely I will make this again.

Delicious, used freshly caught Porgies for the fish and Panko bread crumbs instead of matzo and rolled them again in Panko (like the crunch) before frying. We used a little hot Hungarian Paprika and I do agree that you have to like garlic.

Can I freeze this recipe ? And then serve at room temperature? Thx

Fabulous!! Served them as part of a Northern African meal and they were a hit! Prepared the cakes and sauce the day before and reheated the cakes in the oven. This worked very well. Only change I made to the recipe was to add about 1/4 cup canned sardines to the fish to boost the flavor.

These were horrible. As written the recipe had a terrible texture and the aioli had way too much garlic (and I normally can't get enough garlic). Modifications could make the texture and sauce better, but don't make the recipe as it is now.

I substituted tilapia instead and panko bread crumbs but then followed the recipe to a "t". It turned out delicious! Had guests and grandchildren over and I received reviews like "Oh - this is a KEEPER!" and "You have GOT to make this again!" The sauce was a big hit too and the sauce really zips up vegies too! Gonna try the sauce on grilled tuna tonight!

I thought these turned out great and my guests seemed to really enjoy them. It was definitely something different on the table! They were easy to make, very flavorful, and made for a nice presentation. Next time I might make them a bit bigger so that each cake serves one person--the cakes turned out so small that people took 3 or 4 each.

has anyone made this without matza meal? would it fall apart?

A wonderful alternative to gefilte fish, which I love. I made this with halibut, as suggested, and it came out wonderfully, although I'd like to try it with a less expensive fish next time. I did a rough chop in the processor and was careful not to pulverize. I wanted it to have some texture. Due to some of the comments, I used only five cloves of garlic and was not overwhelmed. Great flavor, fairly easy and highly recommended dish, especially with the aioli.

This is a great recipe, I added 1 teaspoon of cumin instead of 1 tablespoon, a tablespoon is too much. I added extra pepper, cayenne works too. Also, decreased lemon juice by a little bit. Its perfect for Passover, everyone loved it.

easy to make. i rolled the cakes in bread crumbs (or matzo meal) before frying. very easy to prepare, and they taste good, too! i chopped everything, i don't have a food processor, and they taste just fine.

I love north African food and also love a good fish cake. But this was a very disappointing dish. Fish cakes were too heavy a texture, and the aioli was too sharply acidic. Cannot recommend. --

I halved the recipe and used talapia. I accidentally put in the full 6 garlic cloves in though.... the fish cakes were a mouthful of flavor. I think I would double the garlic next time too. VERY good.. will make for future dinner parties.

Served as our first course for Rosh Hashanah dinner - delicious! I am not a fan of gefilte fish and I was looking for an alternative. Followed some tips from other cooks. Carefully pulse fish in food processor only to a coarse texture and remove to a bowl. Chop onion, garlic, parsley and cilantro by hand and add to the chopped fish with spices, beaten egg and breadcrumbs (or matzo meal). Mix together gently, but throughly. Reduce amount of garlic in aioli to 4 cloves. The hot, smoked Spanish paprika gives the sauce an exceptional flavor, so do try to find it. I used Haddock because the Halibut was $25/lb here. The make-ahead option works great.

This is fabulous! My husband caught some marlin and it tends to be a little sinewy. This was the perfect recipe. I didn't have matzo meal so I used rye krisps crumbled and ground corriander since I was out of cilantro. Coated the cakes w/ panko and the cakes were flavorful, cripy tender and delicious. Served along side a romaine salad w/ a balsamic vinegrette

I loved it and my husband, a foodie, who was very skeptical loved it. I used grouper because it was freshest.

These are so good. I made them a few times. My guests all requested the recipe, my kids devoured them and my husband asked me to keep a supply of them in the refrigerator so that he can nibble on them any time. They reheat beautifully and moist. This is a definite keeper!

What a great hit at Passover, everyone kept grabbing some more of the "little fish- burgers." The texture was very nice and the ailoi was yummy.

We loved this recipe. It was simple and fast and spiced just right. I used striped bass for the fish and crushed saltine crackers since I didn't have matzo. Absolutely will make these again and again. Also, the aioli was a perfect touch and would definitely recommend making it.

Found them a bit bland...however, it's a great way to do something different with white fish. And I am wondering if salmon would not be great here!

I had leftover halibut that had been poached in white wine and lemon juice. I followed the recipe but used the cooked fish, and it turned out wonderfully! Very quick (without the aioli, alas), easy, and delicious!

The fish cakes are great, but it's the aioli that makes this recipe special. They disappear every time I serve them, and on a food table, people dip crudites in the aioli too. I am considering them as an alternative for the people who don't like gefilte fish next Passover. Sephardic food rocks!

Have made these several times for dinner parties and they are always a hit. The aioli is a must. I make them as written except I make them more the size of crab cakes, and serve as a main dish.

Wanted to like this, brought to a friend for Rosh Hashanna, but the consistency was tough and the cakes were not easy to form. Maybe next time use fresh bread crumbs to lighten up. The spicy sauce is terrific

These are probably the best fish cakes ever... used bread crumbs instead of matzoh, made hamburger patty size, refrigerated for an hour to set and then lightly dipped each fishcake in a beer-batter and rolled in panko crumbs to give a nice crispy exterior. Made the most amazing fish sandwich of all time with some nice arugula, tomato and optional slice of swiss cheese. Has inspired my wife to invite friends over to our new house (I cook)!

I served this at a cocktail party for 70 people. It was flying off the trays. The spicy aioli is magic when combined with the fish cakes. I used the sweet paprika/cayenne mix to great success. I highly reccomend this recipe.

This is an outstanding recipe that allows for great innovation. I had over a hundred pounds of Halibut in my freezer from fishing in Alaska. We have tried every possible recipe for what is, essentially, a mild fish. Overwhelmingly, our guests felt, over several different parties, that this was the best.

I am not a fish lover, but this recipe is delicious and not "fishy" at all. My husband loved it and my two year old ate it withour complaints, so I will definitely make it again. To save time I made larger cakes than the recipe called for and I didn't need as much oil as it called for, either.

Having lived in Tunisia during the 60's, I can attest to the high quality and authenticity of the fish cake recipe. However, if you want an authentic aioli with true Tunisian flavors, use harissa instead of the tomato paste and Spanish paprika or paprika + cayenne. It makes a huge difference!

I made this recipe for passover and received rave reviews. My strong recommendation is not to grind the fish or any of the ingredients in the food processor. Instead, finely chop half the halibut and coarsly chop the remaining Halibut. It will give a much better texture to the fish cakes. I chopped all the remaining ingredients and mixed in a bowl. I made them the night before and heated in the over before serving. They were great with the Spicy paprika aioli.

I'm not a huge fish fan and I thought these were great. I used Italian bread crumbs instead of the matzo meal and a mixture of the onions that I had in the house. For the sauce I added a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce instead of the tomato paste and powdered peppers. Really really nice dish. I was not looking forward to dinner tonight since I was planning on fish. Found this recipe though and what a great dinner! I served with oven fries and a salad. Yum!

My husband and his friends caught HUNDREDS of pounds of halibut in Alaska, and when they returned we had a dinner party we called "Halibut Fest 2005!" This was everyones' favorite dish and I have had many requests for the recipe. I made them a day ahead, and they heated up perfectly in the oven for the party.

Very tasty. I rolled mine in the matzo meal prior to frying and it gave them a nice toasty crust.

Lovely flavours. A dish that even non-fishy types can enjoy. And it really does reheat nicely.

I don't generally like fish, but these were actually really good. And, as someone who has been to Tunisia, you actually do get a little hint of the flavors of that country. The sauce was a very nice complement to the flavors of the cakes. A big hit at our party!

I recently was the host for my Gourmet Group. The theme was dishes of the Mediterranean and I had each couple bring a dish from a different country on the Mediterranean. I picked this dish to represent Tunisia based on the reviews here. Wow! Even though the entire menu came out beautifully, I thought that this was the best dish. I have a personal chef business and made it for a client the following week. It even reheats well.

I just did a half recipe of these to taste-test as part of my Moroccan/Sephardic menu for our Passover dinner for 16. They are superb, so easy to do, and I love the fact they can be done ahead and rewarmed. I used haddock and, for this 'rehearsal', made the cakes a bit larger (got eight out of 1 lb. of fish). The mayonnaise dipping sauce is a cinch to improvise - no need to follow recipe exactly. As an hors d'oeuvres before Passover dinner (not a Seder) am thinking of making these even smaller, like fish balls, to be eaten on picks with one dip into the sauce.

I am a personal chef and made this for a family who wanted to eat fish (however they don't like any "fishy" fish. This is the first recipe I have made for them they all liked. I will try it again for others. My only problem was to be sure it isn't processed too long or the patties get kind of tough.

Delicious and simple. I made the cakes a little bigger (took less time!), and everyone loved them. The aioli was good, but maybe some home-made mayo with garlic, plus the flavorings here would have been tastier.

Delicious fish cakes, the spice really gave them a great taste. Big hit at my Passover dinner. I love the fact that they can be prepared ahead and they heat perfectly in the oven as suggested. They freeze well, so go ahead and make the whole recipe and freeze. Paprika Aioli added a wonderful accompaniment

These fish cakes were a huge hit with both the adults and children. I used cod instead of halibut, and I used a bit less salt than the recipe called for, and they were wonderful. I found that we only ate about half of the aioli, next time I'll cut that recipe in half. These were fairly easy to prepare, much lighter than standard fish cakes, and will be a staple at all our future seders!

The entire family agreed that the fish cakes were outstanding. Spicy, good texture and not difficult to make.

These are really tasty little suckers !! I think the recipe has a mistake in that it seems to suggest that all the ingredients should be "processed until smooth." This is contrary to any other fish cake recipe I've used. You might get a pasty mess. I processed the fish as specified and then blended by hand all the other ingredients, whippping the egg. This allows for appreciation of the separate flavors and a slightly crunchy texture. You can reduce the amount of oil considerably with a good nonstick pan. Given the amount of onion and garlic in the cakes I reduced the garlic in the aioli to four cloves and slightly reduced the amount of cayenne as well. A cilantro garnish finishes the dish nicely. All the spices puzzled some of the more traditional passover guests but the dish kept getting eaten.
