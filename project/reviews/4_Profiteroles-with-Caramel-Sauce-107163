This was my first time making profiteroles and I couldn't believe how easy it was to make. They were the hit of the family 'dessert' night. I changed the filling to a chocolate and orange whipped cream and I added a chocolate and orange sauce over the top with the caramel sauce too. It was so yum! It only made about 28 instead of 4 dozen so I'm not sure if mine were too big but they were a perfect 3 bites size for me. Definitely recommend this recipe to others! :)

I love this recipe. 2nd time I used it to make Profiteroles -- the first time I made bi ones by mistake but this time I made them the proper size but experimented a little more with the fillings. For 1/3 I flavoured the pastry cream with a package of instant cappuccino and dipped profiteroles in dark chocolate. Filled the next 1/3 with the lemon curd from the pavlova recipe on this site and dipped in white chocolate. The final 1/3 I filled with the marscarpone & whipped cream filling from the buttermilk cake and marscapone recipe from Epicurious and then had the caramel sauce (with bourbon) from this recipe for dipping. All were great and well received.

I made caramel sauce and profiteroles, but served w/ vanilla icecream instead. The caramel sauce is to DIE for. I could get very fat on this stuff :)

Raves over these - I almost hate to say how easy they are. The best choux recipe on this site. Definitely mound the batter using a pastry bag or plastic bag with hole cut into the corner - you want height. The direction to slit the pastries and return to the oven gives them great texture. I've done this filling and sauce. But now, in the spirit of easy, I've moved to vanilla ice cream or leftover frozen mousse with good quality bottled chocolate sauce and raspberry puree.

My pastry puffed up nicely but when I put in the filling I realized there was no bottom! All the filling fell out onto the pan... Everything tasted great, though. Does anyone have any ideas what I did wrong?

Very Good. I made a chocolate sauce in addition to the caramel sauce and drizzled both over the pyramid before serving which looked great. I also only used fresh whipped cream for the filing. This is one of the better choux pastry recipes.

Simply delicious!! This was my first attempt at profiteroles, so I have a few suggestions for newbies like myself. Piping the dough was important--I spooned a few and they ended up flat, so I cut a hole in a plastic bag to pipe them into tall balls rather than dropped spoonfuls. They puffed right up. When making the custard, add the boiling milk VERY gradually and mix well. I was surprised by one reviewer's suggestion of using vanilla pudding, but I can see now that it would work quite well, especially for large groups. However, this custard is delicious--I added a teaspoon of fine mexican vanilla. The sauce I made was a chocolate-honey sauce (also on this site) so that I could do it ahead and just re-warm for serving. It was a fantastic rich chocolate sauce, and I added a generous splash of whiskey. They were fabulous. Everyone assumed they'd been purchased from a bakery until my boyfriend was sweet enough to point out they'd been made from scratch.

I made this receipe for my boyfriend last night and we were both well impressed. I didn't make the caramel sauce though, went for straight toffee instead, wish I had gone with the recommended sauce. Even still this was so so yummy! And so very easy to make.

First off, if you're gonna make profiteroles, this dough recipe is the BEST! Instead of making the filling, I will make instant pudding. It's quick easy, and has just the right texture to fill with all kinds of flavors! Everyone LOVES these things. MAke them smaller and you have instant little creme puffs.

to santa rosa: watch the sugar in the pan like a hawk--once it turns a rich, maple-ish brown (it will only last for a second) add the cream and whisk like crazy

I've made these puffs a million times and they just get better! They are requested for every event. For the custard, I suggest straining the egg mixture, just to get the yellow egg bits out (that's purely an aesthetic thought, though!)

I just made the caramel sauce and it was so delicious it was dangerous to have around! The first time I made it was a total success. I've tried three other times and it hasn't happened again - it turns hard, crystalizes, or burns. Same ingredients, same saucepan (heavy, Le Creuset) - I'd love to make it more often. Any ideas???

Fantasic!!! These little puffs make all your dreams come true! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. I make them for birthdays and parties, and no matter how many times i serve them, the reactions are always fantastic! They're great for finger food, deserts, or even just snacks!

Very delicious, especially with kids! In summer time, it's very good to use vanilla icecream for the filling. For a quick sauce, we can use brown sugar.And for the glamour, I made it "flambée" with a dash of Amaretto!!!
