Loved this recipe. My 6yo really enjoyed it as well. its the only soup I've made to date that she will actually eat voluntarily....that says something to me.

delicious soup! I made it using leftover turkey breast and wing meat. The recipe made a huge portion of soup and reheated very well the next day. Next time I will make it using even more veggies and perhaps some pesto stirred in just before serving.

I started with a turkey carcass from Thanksgiving with this recipe, so the broth/turkey instructions weren't followed exactly. But the end result was fantastic! The family declared it's the only turkey soup I should make from here on. A great combination of flavors!

Made a few minimal adjustments. This is a plentiful recipe and delicious!

Very good soup with a depth of flavor-- even on the first day. I used the remainder of a turkey breast and turkey stock following the directions fairly closely. I added alittle red wine while it was simmering and some grated parmesean cheese. I will make this recipe again.

This is a great soup and easy to make. I made two variations...The first time I used chicken drumsticks instead of turkey wings based on what my market had. I cut most of the skin off before cooking the meat to keep the fat down. This worked out great and I didn't have to skim the top at all. The second time I tried it with two whole chicken breast, skin removed, and quartered into large chunks with the bone still on. I prefer the consistency of white meat in the soup and it was easier to take off the bone. Also, both times I skipped the basil due to an allergy. So I can't speak to if this helps the soup, but no one I served it to missed it. I think next time I'll try it with swiss chard or some other green leafy veggie. This soup was great and we ate it for days, although you may need to thin it out with a little more liquid over the course of reheating it.

This is the best turkey soup I have ever made! The orzo and the white beans make this soup really special. I also add handfuls of spinach towards the end of the cooking time.

Excellent soup! I did make a few changes. Started with the turkey carcass in a roasting pan and covered with water. I simmered that with a chopped onion for an hour and then removed the carcass and proceeded. I did not bother to saute the onion and garlic, just added that to the stock with the tomatoes and herbs. I had some swiss chard left over from my Italian stuffing and chopped that and added to the pot. After taking the turkey off the carcass, I added that to the pot and then added the celery, carrots, orzo and 1 can of cannellini beans rather than 2. We ate this for several days. Very nice change from typical turkey noodle soup and this will now be my favorite for leftover turkey.

Made this with leftover turkey from Xmas dinner and turkey stock. It was a huge hit with the entire family - everyone asked for the recipe. The basil makes the soup. We also added freshly grated parmigiano reggiano at the table. This will be a post-turkey staple.

This was soooo good. Will continue to make this except using shredded chicken only because Thanksgiving is the only time I would have leftover turkey to use. A great spin on chicken noodle soup :)

No tweaking necessary from this cook. Hearty and satisfying on a cold day.

The combination of turkey, orzo, white beans and basil is lovely-- but to make this soup wonderful you have to tweak it a bit. I made a rich turkey stock and used it instead of the pre-made chicken broth. I used the carcass, wings and bits from last night's turkey to make the broth and then added freshly cooked turkey to the soup today. This I feel yields a nicer result than using chunks of the cooked-to-death turkey that has been used to make the broth. Also, I added some shallots, parsley and dill as well as cubed butternut squash. This is a great basic recipe for turkey soup. I gave it three forks because as written it is just a jumping off point.

This is a great soup to make with leftover turkey. The flavors were all there but I didn't care for the consistency. I prefer a more "brothy" soup.

There is something to be said for the wonderful combination of both fine chicken stock and orzo. This is a simple, and yet wonderful combination of ingredients. I did modify somewhat the turkey wings with the smoked variety as this added a stronger flavor than the non-smoked turkey wings.

Delightful. Used the thighs and legs from a huge turkey, ditali pasta in place of the orzo (a small tubular pasta) and great northern beans-all with excellent results.

I made with left over turkey. Definitely delicious - I even called to tell my dad to try it next time.

very hearty, easy to make, awesome for leftover turkey.

Great recipe to mix up the turkey soup repetoire - sort of like turkey minestrone. I too used the leftover turkey carcas, only had mixed beans and no celery but, otherwise, made the recipe as written. Turned out really nicely.

Actually, I came up with this recipe because I was confronted with a 20+ lb. turkey carcass that I didn't want to go to waste. Bon Appetit modified the recipe - it really is easier to use leftover turkey to make it.

So easy and rich in flavor. Great way to use up Thanksgiving turkey. I pureed the tomatoes slightly, threw in some leftover green beans, and added extra basil but stuck to the recipe otherwise. Followed others' advice and used good chicken stock. I'll be making this one again.

This beats out my mom's turkey soup! Make sure to use a good chicken broth... it makes a huge difference.

This was a good cool day recipe. I think I put too much chicken broth in, as the taste was too salty the first day we had it. However, I added about 4 cups of water and it was much better the second day. The flavors were nice. I added fresh lemon thyme and I won't skimp on fresh herbs when I make it again.

Not earth-shattering, but good. And a good use of Thanksgiving leftovers.

Delicious way to use up Thanksgiving turkey, and so easy, too! Makes a tasty and satisfying hot lunch or light dinner with some fresh crusty bread--and it freezes well. It's the third great soup I've gotten off of this site. Keep up the great work!

Pretty decent way to use up turkey, which I don't particularly like. Some suggestions that I thought improved it considerably: saute two finely diced carrots and two finely diced ribs of celery with the onion at the beginning; substitute thyme for oregano; cut the canned chicken broth in half and replace the rest with water; saute two more finely diced carrots and ribs of celery and add along with the tomatoes; lose the orzo and substitute coarsely chopped kale, escarole, or other dark greens shortly before serving. Also, if you do chill first, skim the fat before continuing.

This soup was delicious! I used a leg, a thigh and a wing instead of all wings. I'm glad I did, the wing didn't have much meat. The only ingredient I didn't have was the fresh basil and I don't think anyone missed it. I served this with some crusty French bread and a salad. Everyone loved it! I would definitely make it again.

This soup was delicious and hearty, but forget using turkey wings. It is far simpler to use left over turkey instead. I sauteed all the fresh vegetables together, then added 4 cups of chicken broth, simmering until vegetables were crisp-tender. I added cooked orzo, cannellini, diced tomatoes and turkey simmering until heated through. Finally topping off the soup with fresh basil, salt and pepper.
