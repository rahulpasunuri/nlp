Don't listen to the arrogant "cook" above. Canned pumpkin is the ONLY way pumpkin pie is made. Canned is fresher and has more vibrant flavor than any mush he can hollow out of a rotting pumpkin he bought at Walmart that was picked 20 days before by a child in south america. Please, "a cook" spare me.

Yes, I concur with the previous statement! How can you call this a FRESH pumpkin pie when it calls for CANNED pumpkin? I would think that epicurious would call for the reader to get a pie pumpkin roast it AND its seeds, etc. And while I'm at it - if you ARE using a pie pumpkin, aka sugar pumpkin - you SHOULD augment it with some butternut squash, which has a superior flavor

This is not "fresh" pumpkin pie. It calls for canned pumpkin.
