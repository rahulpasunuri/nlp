Definitely a keeper. The flavors of the dip and the bread crumb/green onion mixture gave the chicken a full bodied flavor that rivaled any chicken seasoning I've tasted.

This is a great recipe to take to a pot-luck. Easy to fix and can be served at room temp.

This turned out great (altho I forgot to turn the chicken so the bottom was mushy) I skipped the green onions and added about 2 cups of crushed pecans to the bread crumbs, It was a great recipe.

I used basil instead of the green onions and served it at a picnic. Easy to fix and eat.

Yuck. I thought this tasted awful. However, my children (aged 3 and 7) loved it. I would never serve it to guests; but perhaps it's a good recipe for what my grandmother would have called "nursery food." They will request it, so I would make it again for them (easy) but next time, I'll plan something different for myself.

I thought this recipe was very good. I also like the fact that it is quick and easy to do for a weeknight dinner.

2 1/2 forks! I used coarse-grain DIJON mustard and increased the worchestershire sauce by 1 tsp. My husband loved it and I thought it was pretty good.

My husband loves these drumsticks so I make them quite often. They are pretty good...

This tasted good, but not so exciting. I thought it tasted a bit like some frozen, ready-made stuff, but juicier. It's quite easy to prepare, though you might as well try something else.

I tried this for a simple dinner, and found it to be lacking! The premise of mayo dipped chicken in crumbs is fine, and I regularly use mayo (with additions) prior to breading food, but the flavor just didn't come together. The crumb mixture was OK, and my kids picked it off and put it on their broccoli, but not worth repeating.
