I've made this recipe a few times, and have now discovered some do's and don'ts, so thought I'd share. I was able to cut the sugar down to 2 cups (instead of 4), but any less than that messes up the ratio and prevents it from setting. Wait until everything has melted (marshmallows, sugar, cream) before doing the 6 minute countdown, and boil it on medium (for those who suffered from sudden expansion), stirring constantly. Use dark chocolate (not milk -- again, it screws up the fudge's ability to harden), and really really beat the mixture at the end to get it to bind. It's best to let it set overnight if you can manage! All in all a great recipe!!!

This was my first attempt at fudge even though I have been a fudge fan for years. The recipe is terrific. I followed previous reviewers suggestions about using marshmallow creme and boiling in a stock pot. The texture is creamy with a great sweet chocolatey flavor. I used 3.5 cups of sugar and would decrease this even more to emphasis the chocolate flavor. I used a large jar of marshmallow creme but wonder if the small jar would have been better for a firmer room temperature texture. My only error was using too large a jelly roll pan. I much prefer thicker fudge pieces to the .25 inch thickness my pan yielded. The recipe says to boil for exactly 6 minutes. My sugar/marshmallow/sugar mixture behaved is such a way to make this a little hard to figure out. The mixture would boil if I was stirring it but did not boil if I did not stir. Due to my confusion I probably boiled it for 8 minutes. If this recipe failed or was grainy you did something wrong.

Made it the first time per recipe. I like my fudge more chocolate than sweet, so I tried it a second time. I halved the recipe, used 8oz of unsweetened, and crushed peppermints instead of nuts. It turned out perfectly. BTW, the half recipe worked fine in a 3qt sauce pan.

This is the second time I have made this fudge and it is the best. I use a jar of marshmallow creme instead of the marshmallows and I add that to the chocolate bowl instead of boiling it. Lots cleaner to make.

I can bake, but I can't make candy. This is the first fudge recipe I have made that has actually turned out like it's supposed to. Last year, I tried several recipes that failed. None of them included marshmallows or marshmallow cream, so I do think that's key. This recipe could stand to cut some sugar, it is very sweet. Granted, fudge is supposed to be sweet, but it is something I will toy with next time. I'm just happy to have not wasted 12 oz of fine chocolate, like I had previously. Great recipe for people who aren't familiar with or good at making candy.

Perfect fudge! This is the first fudge recipe I have ever tried and, like others, I was nervous given the mixed the reviews. I'm so glad I took the risk! Followed the advice given by other reviewers and it came off without a hitch -- used a LARGE, HEAVY pan (cast iron/enamel) to allow for expansion and prevent burning and stirred the final marshmallow/chocolate mixture until the spoon left a wake (about 5 minutes). Toasted the nuts first, used 1 tsp. vanilla and substituted 2 tsp. strong coffee for the other two, used 1/2 bittersweet and 1/2 semi-sweet Ghiredelli chocolate chips to eliminate the need for chopping (and significantly less expensive than the bars) and poured into two 9 x 9 cake pans. Still soft after setting for a few hours at room temperature, but *perfect* the following day. Pieces are about 1" thick.

This is a FABULOUS recipe! I have been using another similar recipe that has the same amount of sugar and yields the same servings, but the sugar never really dissolved. That is not a problem with this recipe! I followed the advice of the other reviewers and used a soup pot to cook the ingredients to allow for expansion (cast iron). I also substituted the vanilla for coffee as suggested by a few other reviews. It turned out fab and doesn`t taste nearly as sweet as my other recipe which I am throwing away today......This is my new go to fudge receipe!

This recipe is very good and works well if you follow the directions EXACTLY. I used a 9 x 12.5 jelly roll pan which was the perfect size (fudge is approximately 1/2 inch thick). I had to stir the marshmallow/chocolate mixture for quite awhile - - 3 to 4 minutes before it was ready to pour into the pan. It set-up perfectly and is velvety smooth. I'd definitely make it again.

The taste was good, but the author left out a lot of information. For an infrequent candy maker, I didn't realize how much my mixture expanded so I didn't boil for the full 6 minutes to keep it from completely boiling over. USE A BIG POT! The other info that was left out was the size of the platter/baking sheet to use. I used a large baking sheet and it poured out so thin my pieces came out like postage stamps. RECIPE AUTHORS: PLEASE DON'T BE VAGUE!

I followed the directions exactly (other than substituting espresso for vanilla, as suggested) and had wonderful results. It set solid and tastes great. I can't imagine why so many people are having trouble with this recipe.

This was an easy and great recipe. I read through the other reviews and was glad I did. A bigger pot than you think you'll need is essential. My fudge took longer to cool. I had it in the fridge over night before I cut into it. The result was tasty, rich and smooth. It also kept in an air tight container, in the fridge for several days; Which was great because it took awhile to eat through it all.

Great Recipe. Just what I was looking for. Candy shop good. Mind the large pot comments and do spend some time stirring at the end. I'm just learning about the whole 'resist' part at the end, but it does greatly improve the texture and decrease the set time. This recipe does not require a candy thermometer, but tastes like it does!

I tried this recipe and it was a failure. Since the chocolate I used was the best and very expensive I will not use this recipe again.

Well, I really debated about whether or not to try this recipe since the reviews are so mixed. However, I decided to go for it and was very pleasantly surprised. I followed the recipe almosts exactly and it was delicious! I used bittersweet chocolate and followed another reviewer's suggestion and used a bit of vanilla and some strong brewed coffee. Very creamy and smooth, not too sweet and seemed to set up well in the refridgerator. Do be sure to use a very large pot for the marshmallow mixture. It more than doubles in size while it's boiling - I had to very quickly transfer the mixture to a larger pot in order to avoid disaster.

well, I tried this recipe but the marshmallow mixture didn't come to the boil for ages and they ended up just burning-do you know how i could bring them to a boil without getting them to taste like burnt charcoal?!?!?

I've used a recipe very similar, and had excellent results. Alot of people seem to be having trouble getting it to set, or said it would melt as they ate it. Try reducing the butter by half, and use mini marshmallows instead of regular ones (about 10 oz) Also, I don't add the marshmallows right away. After the milk and sugar have cooked, I stir the mix into the marshmallows and chocolate, stirring rapidly. The more you stir, the better the texture and shine. Eventually it will resist and thats when I know to put it in the pan.

Much too sweet, and didn't set completely - it was all right to eat straight from the fridge but got melty really fast. I used bittersweet chocolate and it ended up tasting like milk chocolate. Lining the pan with foil made cutting it up a breeze.

I adore this recipe. The fudge makes a lovely gift and is wonderful to bring to get togethers. Friends always rave about it.

This recipe failed on both attempts at making it. It never fully set either time though the directions were followed to the letter. The taste was ok but not something I'd present to a guest or as a gift.

Line the pan with foil before adding mix. You can pull the foil and fudge out to ease cutting. Second, I had to put the fudge in the fridge for at least 24 hours, so the fudge would be firm enough to cut. It was worth the wait!

Toasting the walnuts to add to the recipe is key for great tasting fudge but...the end product was too soft. We had to eat it with a spoon! I don't know what I did wrong. Maybe didn't beat it well enough before pouring into a prepared pan.

I love this recipe. It took a few iterations to get it right, and I needed to buy a larger sauce pan. The mix, when boiled, will over double in volume. If it does not, then you are probably going to get (really tasty) sloppy fudge.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well this recipe turned out and it is easy to make (no thermometer)! I made it in a 13"x9" pan. The first batch seemed a little too sweet (I used semi-sweet chocolate). For the second batch, I substituted strong coffee for the vanilla, which cut the sweetness and made it perfect. Toasting the walnuts is essential. Just beat it until it looks glossy and smooth, the ingredients are all incorporated, and the mixture begins to feel very heavy on the spoon because it is beginning to set.

Was hoping this was THE Easy Fudge w/Marshmallow recipe but it is too soft, as other reviewers mentioned, even if it tastes fine. Not firm enough to send in the mail.

I have always avoided making fudge and now I can't stop! I have made this recipe about 20 times now and it's incredibly easy to tweak. I've adjusted ingredients and made Bourbon Pecan Fudge, Kahlua Hazlenut Fudge, Bailey's Cashew Fudge -- you name it -- it's awesome with booze. The secret seems to be in the Marshmallows. I don't know what they are, really, but I think they're made by a Chemical Company in Jersey. Whatever is in them, it makes this recipe easy and it works! I have friends now and people think I'm beautiful. You simply must make this recipe and then play with it. You might even become rich and famous.

Okay, let me start by confessing that I'm legendary for making ridiculous messes in the kitchen, whether I'm making Thanksgiving dinner or cold cereal for breakfast. Things turn out tasty, usually, but oh my, the clean-up. That said, I really tore up the kitchen on this one. And that said, I'm definitely going to try this recipe again, because it's yummy. I didn't use a large enough pot for the marshmallows and such, so there was a boiling-over incident, complete with tiny gooey burns on my hands. I didn't have enough sugar in the house, so I used a cup of regular sugar, a cup of vanilla sugar that I mananged to unearth, and a cup of "Splenda for Baking," which is specifically NOT recommended in large quantities for confections, due to texture issues. See where this is going? Nowhere good, by the looks of it. But I soldiered through, poured the stuff into a parchment-lined jelly-roll pan, and put it in the fridge overnight, after it had cooled (and I had, of course, burned my tongue in too-hasty, over-eager, curious tasting attempts). It tastes great (if mega-sweet), it's smooth like real fudge, it seemed to set up just fine in the fridge, and all's right with the world. So far. Now, enjoy a good laugh at my expense, everyone. And try the Milk Chocolate Truffles from Bon Appetit in February of 1999 (or thereabouts). Those are terribly messy and delicious as well.

Please help, I really am frustrated with this recipe! I am hoping to send the fudge for Christmas. I made this fudge and wasn't sure the time needed to mix/stir. Plus, I used half of a sheet pan (sheet pan is approx. 13x16) and the fudge seemed to thin. I can't imagine how the author was able to get 8 dozen pieces. What size pan and cut pieces was she using? Thanks, Margaret

I would make this again, although, like VA cook below, my fudge did not set until I put it in the fridge for several hours. I did not know when to stop beating it and would appreciate some input on others who have been successful -- do you wait til the fudge thickens somewhat and is creamy (like old-fashioned fudge) before pouring into the buttered pan? I wasn't sure, so I beat by hand for a while, then poured it out when it thickened a little. After refrigerating, it tasted heavenly! The only problem is that it now has to be eaten refrigerated, because it's a little too soft at room temp. I may make it again to see if I can win!

Hi - the cook from SF again - for the cook from Sterling - humidity may be the cause of your mushy fudge. Try adding a few more large marshmallows (two or three) and increasing the boiling time by a minute to a minute and a half. Good luck!

This is the same recipe as my family's tried-and-true fudge recipe and the name is true to form. There is no candy thermometer needed, no formed ball stage and no fail. This is the only fudge recipe I use because the fudge always sets, is always creamy and never crystallizes. You can make it with or without nuts, sprinkle crushed candy canes on top for a festive idea, or use other flavored chips (like peanut butter) instead of the chocolate. One thing to note - never make a double batch. The cooking time will be different and the fudge will not set properly. This is a quick enough recipe, however, to be able to make two batches with ease. Enjoy!
