A hit at our dinner party. Perfect combination of flavors. It also paired well with the Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Peach BBQ sauce. We have a lot of creamed corn recipes that have been passed down to us between our families, but my husband said that this one is by far the best.

This has become part of our Thanksgiving tradition - it goes so well with roast turkey! I add a little corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit. We never have leftovers.

My family loved this. Very colorful dish and also very tasty. I didn't seem to have the problem of it being soupy as others state.

Good, but could be better; needs more flavor. Also very soupy.

Great combination of flavors. I wish i'd read the reviews about it being soupy before I made the recipe, because I thought I had that problem due to using half & half instead of cream. Also used canola & olive oils instead of butter and didn't miss it. i would leave off the sprinkle-on scallions. Nice dish to use with farmstand corn.

Had out of town guests, served this recipe. Received rave reviews.

This dish was very tasty. I will omit the sprinkled on green onion and cook the sauce down just a bit next time. Everyone really liked this dish.

I thought this was just okay; but my husband loved so maybe a 2.5. I could not find just bourbon so used Jim Beam Kentucky bourbon and fresh Iowa sweet corn. For me the sweet on sweet may be why I didn't love it.

Made this to go with the Pork Tenderloin with Peach BBQ Sauce. I read a few reviews about the corn being "soupy." That, and my husband is not a creamed corn fan, so I used half the amount of heavy cream. I added 1/3 cup cream cheese in place of the second 1/3 cup heavy cream (instead of cornstarch as some had success with.) I think the cream cheese made it less soupy, very creamy and rich. Would definitely make again!

I divided this recipe by 3 in order to make 2 servings. This was delicious after solving its blandness problem by adding 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper to my 1/3 recipe. Subbed green for red bell pepper, red onion for shallots, frozen (defrosted) corn for fresh, and rum for bourbon (didn't have any). The sauce never did thickly coat the corn, so I mixed the second half of the cream with a bit of cornstarch before adding it. My husband REALLY liked this and wants me to make it often. It is a very simple recipe and was a good side dish with "Roast Pork Loin and Potatoes", also on this site. A very satisfying meal.

The recipe turned out great! As others have mentioned it is a little thin. So, I dissolved a little corn starch in cream and it thickened it up to a nice consistancy.

The ingredients were too expensive and the taste was not well liked by my Thanksgiving guests.

I was very disappointed with this recipe. The bourbon taste was too strong and the recipe was soupy. With the price of red peppers, shallots and cream,I wouldn't bother with this one again.

This was good, but not the kind of creamed corn I was expecting. I was looking for something with MUCH more thick cream sauce and not too many competing flavors for my Thanksgiving dinner.

Delicious. Due to the "soupy" reviews, I cut the amount of cream in half. Perfect!

I agree with all who voted "soupy". I used scotch instead of bourbon but couldn't taste anything.

Easy and delicious. A little too fatty--I would try cutting back to half and half or milk.

I made this along with the Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Peach Barbeque sauce. Everyone loved it. I did think it needed a little more flavor though. I might cut back on the liquid next time as it was a little soupy. I also made it ahead and reheated. Turned out fine.

Great flavor plus quick and easy recipe. I would like to try it again with fat-free half and half to lighten it up.

Very good and simple to make. I added a little extra bourbon. Can be made in advance and reheated.

Delicious. Great summer side dish. Subtle flavors and easy to make.

We liked this dish alot. Served it with the Grilled Pork Loin with Peach Barbecue Sauce. We liked it because the corn still had a firm texture; it is not so pulverized as some creamed corn. Used fresh corn from the farm stand and I am sure that helped make it the delicious dish that it was.

Delicious! Made this with the pork tenderloin and everyone raved about it. While the recipe says serves 6-8, if you like corn this will only serve 3-4. Reheats well.

I've made this twice now, to great reviews. This is always the first dish gone at a party....I successfully made with frozen corn (ahead of time, and then reheated).

This was i>delicious./i> The bourbon and corn flavors really meld beautifully. Made exactly as the recipe said, except used frozen corn (all the fresh looked sad and woody.) The result was a little too soupy for my taste, but a smidgen of cornstarch at the end solved that problem.

I had this at a dinner party and it was quite good. Despite all the ingrediants, the corn was not over powered. PS-Hate the new Epicurious format...=(
