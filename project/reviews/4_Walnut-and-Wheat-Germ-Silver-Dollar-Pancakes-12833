YUM! These were light & tasty! I substituted pine nuts for the walnuts & yogurt for the buttermilk, but I don't think that affected the recipe much, as it is originally written. So this is a fair review, in that regard. This is a great recipe to use with your own creative bent. I made a 2nd batch using grated orange rind & some vanilla extract + another tsp of sugar & they turned out even better than the orig!

This recipe is easy and quick and makes for a perfect weeknight or brunch meal. We pureed and heated a bag of frozen strawberries with a little sugar and lemon juice to use as syrup.

The blender method didn't work for me (the batter was too thick), I will probably try using a food processor next time, or just do it by hand.
