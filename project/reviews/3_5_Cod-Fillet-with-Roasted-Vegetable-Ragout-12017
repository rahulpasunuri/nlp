Vegetables get a 4, though I think the zucchini chunks are too big. The fish gets a 2. Other reviews said the fish was bland so I added olive oil, garlic and lemon juice and peel and it was still kind of tasteless. Next time I will double the sauce and drizzle over the fish as well.

This recipe was a big hit at the dinner table. It was simple to assemble. As mentioned in a previous review, I also found the veggies a bit too watery, so would choose to charcoal grill next time.

This was simple and tasty. I used dried thyme and some additional vegetables--yellow squash, mushrooms, kohlrabi. I seasoned the fish with sea salt and lemon pepper and squeezed some fresh lemon juice over it. That, with the sauce from the veggies gave the cod enough of a flavor boost for me. My veggies took only 15 minutes to brown, and next time I will add the fish after 10 minutes, because I'd like a little crunch to the vegetables.

the vegetable ragout is absolutely fantastic..and I substituted like everyone else with what I had (eggplant and kale..surprisingly good). The cod was delicious with just a little bit of seafood seasoning and some extra lemon juice...I found the breadcrumbs a bit unnecessary. delicious!

Okay, it was great with some modifications. I didn't have zucchini or bell peppers so I substituted broccolini, potatoes and cremini mushrooms. Used 1/2 red onion and 1/2 white onion. A dash of red pepper flakes and doubled the sauce. A great easy meal with lots of flavor.

I really wanted to like this but the recipe just didn't work for us. The vegetables were pretty tasty, but the cod was tasteless. Won't be making this again.

Excellent. It is light with a wonderful flavor. I skipped the bread crumbs, so this recipe took even less time to make.

Simple, elegant, tasty, quick and easy! Having no zucchini on hand, I almost passed this one by. Thanks to the comment from Prince George I successfully substituted brocolli. And the clean up was easy too.

The bomb. Definitely a do-again, even though there are so many recipes ....

I enjoyed this dish alot, although my ragout was a bit watery. Any suggestions on how to prevent this for next time?

This recipe was very good. I also added 4 new potatoes (quartered) for starch and a teaspoon of red pepper flakes to the ragout. It was super quick and easy and was a "one dish" meal that we will make again.

Very good. Suggestion of adding sweet potatoes was great.

This dish is so easy and perfect for entertaining. I left out the bell peppers and added shallots and eggplant. I used fresh thyme and oregano and extra garlic. Good fish is key. My husband and I really enjoyed this dish and I will be making it often!

Yum. This was so easy and so delicious. I can't wait to make it again.

Great dish and like the suggestion to add sweet potato or eggplant. Served it with Feta/Hazelnut Ravioli on the side and I pureed the vegetable ragout to get a chunky sauce for both the fish and ravioli. Bread crumb topping is key.

The ragout is excellent, with or without fish. We've used it with sole (adjusting cooking times for the fish). I've also added some cubed sweet potato. In fact, you can add or subtract just about anything except the lemon juice, soy and Worcestershire sauce at the end. This is now a staple in our home.

My husband will be very disappointed if I don't make this again...he stood over the counter finishing the leftover vegetables before I could put them in a tupperware. Easy and delicious, this is a winner.

This was lovely. So easy and quick to prepare and so tasty. I loved it and will be making again and again. Just added a sprinkling of dried thyme too along with the fresh thyme. The toasted breadcrumbs sprinkled on the top really made it and I nearly didn't bother with them!

I will make this again for a week night dinner. B/c it is a little different than typical roasted veggies and fish and just as simple. However, it is nothing special.

This is so good. I add Japanese eggplant to the vegetables just because. I have prepared this dish twice, and have prepared the vegetables once on their own for a side dish. Delish. And healthy!

This recipe worked really well with just dried herbs as we didn't have the fresh variety.

This has become a staple for us. Really tasty, and so fast and easy.

This is a great recipe. Be sure to have top quality fresh fish and a thick cut. Also use fresh thyme and more than the recipe specifies. I have made this dish many times and it is always a big hit.

I would eat the vegetable ragout with just about anything. It saved the dry, tasteless cod I bought.

I, too, am surprised by the negative outcomes. I was just pulling this from my recipe box to make the Friday night after Thanksgiving. I have served it to fairly sophisticated company and it comes out beautifully and flavorful every single time.

So surprised to hear such negative reviews!!! I've made this several times, and yes there were times it came out so much better. The key is to use a shallow metal pan for the vegtables. The "burnt brown bits" at the bottom of the pan turn into a very rich sauce once liquid is added. I typically season the fish with "old bay" and other spices. I love this recipe!!!

Great dish. Good flavor and it was easy to make on a weekday.

This recipe was fast and easy, but the cod was void of flavor and tended to dry as it was roasted on top of the vegetables. Overall the dish lacked flavor.I would hesitate to waste the cod on a dish such as this one.

Ifzero had been an option, that's what I would have selected. Can't imagine that my ingredients where that much different from the others, but my results certainly were. The combination of flavors was pretty awful. We tossed it.

Already a keeper for a "make a good dinner after work" household. We added one large sweet potato (peeled and cut into 1/2 inch cubes) for a touch of starch and also doubled all the ingredients for the sauce. Amazingly easy to make one-dish wonder!

What an easy dinner for after work. I added red potatoes and a sweet potato for some starch and left out the bread crumbs. Can't wait to make it again.

We use sea bass in place of cod and add mushrooms sometimes. Just keep in mind the sea bass ie thicker and takes longer to cook.

Very tasty. Highly recommended

Excellent and very easy recipe. It's become a regular among my friends (everyone I make it for wants the recipe and it's so easy that they actually do make it). But we use Chilean Sea Bass or Turbot and we don't bother with the bread crumbs.
