These are FABULOUS!!! Oh my goodness! I did a couple things different. I used wild rice, since it has more flavor than white or brown. I added fresh oragano to the rice while it cooked to impart more flavor. I also forgot to add the 3 TBLS of lemon juice to the filling. I did add 3 TBLS lemon juice to the braising liquid though and that was the perfect amount for the dish. These are going to be wonderful for my picnic tonight! :)

I made this for our neighborhood gourmet group. I did not cook the leaves before stuffing - when I saw what they looked like after the cooking, I realized that this was a wise move. The leaves would be much too soft to hold the rice mixture. They tasted good, but were labor intensive, as others have mentioned. I found that a jar of leaves, at least the one I bought, did not hold as many leaves as it said. From one jare I was able to make about 32 bundles, and only 30 survived the cooking process.

Very good. Didn't blanch the grape leaves. Put thickly sliced potatoes under the dolmas when I steamed them. Put extra grape leaves between the layers.

I would make it again--however--I too wondered about the onion. I just chopped up a whole red onion and followed the directions as if that were right. I had a ton of left over grape leaves, but I also think i may have used the wrong kind of rice--but whatever i did was great. I would make again when ihave time--have to admit it was more labor intensive than i thought--but worth it. Dont' offer to Whip it up but if you have time,you will look like a pro!

how much chopped onion? Recipe does not say.

I did love this recipe but the leaves were cumbersome and were kind of chewy in the end. Since I loved the rice, next time, I'm stuffing peppers with it. Less stressful. Also, does anyone know the origin? Sounds more Sicilan than Greek or Turkish (but I'm an admitted Italophile)

Made with 6 oz ground beef instead and it was still great. My bottom layer of grape leaves was soggy, so will try with the potatoes next time as suggested by another cook. I'll bet that the potatoes would be good too!

rinsed grape leaves with cold water, did not blanch them. Also, did not cook rice prior stuffing... came out great. no tears. A good idea is to cover the bottom of the pan with thick slices of potatoes, this way a low level of water left after the grape leaves are done cooking won't be touching the bottom layer of grape leaves, which will tend to unroll them.

Made these for Roman Ruins Murder Mystery dinner and they were fantastic. I did not blanch the grape leaves but instead just rinsed them several times in cold water. I wonder if that would help keep them from tearing. Mine did not tear at all, wrapped up quite nicely and steamed up to perfection.

I found the preparation of everything up to wrapping in vineleaves extremely simple and quick. However, the vine leaves kept tearing and the stuffing came out and I ended up just serving the rice mixture as a rice salad in little bowls and it was so delicious and popular. I will definitely make the rice again but serve it as an accompaniment to a main meal rather than completing the recipe with vine leaves as an hors d'oevre.

The recipe ingredients did not contain onions as it called for in the recipe directions. I finely chopped one onion and it seemed to turn out as expected.
