So good! I changed it into a dairy-free version though. I used shortening instead of butter and since I'm a stay at home with limited resources, I decided to try and use canned mango (not perfect, but still tasty) and then used the juice in the can instead of mango nectar. I also added 1/2 cup of vanilla soy milk. And for the brown sugar I used the splenda mixture version of it. Served with So Delicious Vanilla Soy Ice Cream. Delish!

I thought it was great and it was suprisingly easy. The ginger was a nice touch. I did think there was actually too much fruit for my taste. Next time I'll make it with just banana and mango. Served it over vanilla Haagen Dazs. It was great!

Made it with hawaiian apple bananas and without the pineapple. Used homemade coconut ice cream topped with mac nuts and it was amazing. Go easy on the sugar if you have delicious ripe mango because there are so many great flavors that will be flooded with a super sweet ice cream AND super sweet topping. For the coconut ice cream just use a couple cans of coconut milk, some brown sugar to taste, and a little vanilla. If you get the coconut milk that has guar gum in it, it will help prevent ice crystals from forming. Very important and have good mango!

I had all the ingredients on hand, and very ripe bananas and mango. The result was quite good. I'm going to use it tonight as a sauce over grilled salmon.

I thought this was excellent. I served this to my guests after a Thai meal. They raved about it.

I love Bananas Foster, but this? it didn't even come close. If I make it again I will try simmering the mango and pineapple for a few extra minutes so they cook a little then adding the banana at the last minute. As it was I found the pineapple too acidic and contrary to the sweetness of the banana and vanilla ice cream. I didn't think the flavors blended well at all. I was very disappointed.

I added another banana, one didn't seem like enough. I also used passion fruit nectar rather than mango. Over ice cream, it was delicious and very easy to prepare.

This was "okay" but I was disappointed. For what's in it, I thought it would be better. I prefer the old fashioned Bananas Foster.

I planned to serve this dessert when we had some friends over for dinner one evening, but ran short of time. When I admitted my predicament, all of our guests volunteered to help--one person was handed a mango, another got the pineapple, someone else got the bananas, etc. etc. The kitchen was a beehive of activity. This dessert is just "to die for" and everyone contributed--making for a memorable & tasty evening!

This dessert is divine. I made it as a finale to a Thai meal (Vegetable Summer Rolls, Grilled Salmon with Thai Curry Sauce) and it was perfect. And this is from a person who usually forgoes dessert, it's not my thing. I do, however, love the contrast between hot and cold in this recipe. This is lovely, and easy too.

Awesome! But next time I wouldn't use a full half cup of brown sugar-- it was a bit too sweet for my taste--- but delicious! YUM!

Absolutely delicious. It probably goes without saying, but the riper the mango, the better.

This was delicious! I had to use a guava/orange mixed juice in place of the 1/4 C. mango nectar and I would feel comfortable using any kind of 100% fruit juice as a substitute for the mango nectar. I am going to add an extra 1-2 Tb. rum next time to increase the rum flavour.
