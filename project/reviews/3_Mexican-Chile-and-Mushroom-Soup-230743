I thought this recipe needed something,so I added double the tomato paste and cumin and it was good. Next time I would add an extra 1/2 onion and an extra garlic clove and possibly garnish with chopped cilantro.

Very disappointing. I was expecting a lot more flavor. In order to make this edible you'd have add lots more spice to it and perhaps make it a creamy soup.

The soup was excellent. I didn't have a dried ancho chili so I used the pasillo I had. Not as hot as I wanted so did add a little ancho chili powder. In addition, I wanted it to be a main dish, rather than a side dish so I added leftover chicken breast and a little avacado. I also added a dollop of sour cream when I served it. Creme Fraishe or queso fresco would have been good also if I'd had it.

I followed the recipe exactly, but wasn't very impressed. It certainly wasn't terrible; I just didn't think it had very much flavor or heat.

Tasty - followed the recipe as suggested with the exception of adding an additional chile. A lime slice on presentation would be wonderful! Looking forward to trying it again.

I used a New Mexico chili because that was what I had on hand. The soup turned out quite spicy so I added half & half to each serving, which tempered the heat level without destroying the flavor. Yummy on a cold day!

Great recipe. I made the following changes: I roasted the garlic whole, until blackened in spots, without crushing. Used 2 chiles and 6 medium garlic cloves. I roasted the chiles for about 10 seconds a side, any longer and you'll burn the chiles resulting in a bitter soup. I rehydrated the chiles afterwards in about 1 1/2 cups of hot water. Used chicken stock instead of broth. To richen it up, I used about 1 cup of Mexican fresh cream. Added one chopped grilled chicken breast that had been seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and ground cumin.

The second time I made this soup, I reduced the broth by 1 cup (2.5 cups total), increased the # of mushrooms, and added a tiny bit of ground cumin. We use this heartier version as a main course with a salad for two.

ugh!! Gross. This tasted horrible. I can't imagine a worse result with such delicious ingredients.

A few tortilla strips for garnish, a slice of lime for it's juice. Excellent!
