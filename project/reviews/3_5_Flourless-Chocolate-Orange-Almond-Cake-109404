Excellent cake - got rave reviews. After reading the other reviews, I made a few modifications. Added 1 stick of butter and reduced cocoa powder to 1/4 cup. Instead of grinding almonds and chocolate, I bought ground almonds. Then I melted the chocolate and butter in a bowl over a pan of hot water, before adding to egg yolks etc. Turned out beautifully and was very moist.

This cake was pretty easy and it got rave reviews from my guests. Very moist and rich without being heavy. Ididn't give it 4 forks because I really couldn't taste the orange over the bittersweet chocolate. So the next time I make it I am going to reduce the bittersweet chocolate by about i ounce and increase the orange peel to 3 tablespoons. I may increase the orange jouice as well by 1/4 cup.

Tasty. Light and fluffly but not too dry. Good with frosting or syrup or on its own. I used vanilla extract because I'm too cheap to buy vanilla bean. I didn't have time to make the sorbet so this review is for the cake only.

This cake was a hit - taste-wise, even when it flopped. The texture was moist but didn't come out of the pan well one time. I thought the egg whites were whipped too dry. I followed the recipe as written. I just covered it up with a store-bought dark chocolate frosting.

Beware, this is not the usual dense, rich flourless chocolate cake. Without butter this cake tends to be a little dry and does have a texture to it. Not headed to my favorites list.

We thought it was just okay for the amount of time it took/bowls dirtied. Followed recipe to a T, but required an extra 30 mins in the oven...still didn't quite set quite right.

I make this cake every Passover and it consistenly gets rave reviews. My family (who is not Jewish) have adapted and adopted it as a spring Easter cake. It is a real crowd pleaser for anyone who loves chocolate.

This was an absolute hit. I replaced the vanila bean with a 1 teaspoon vanilla extract to help keep the cost down. It was served sprinkled with powdered sugar, a garnish of sliced orange, and a dab of freshly whipped cream.

Even when the almonds are very finely ground, they add a crunchy aspect to eating that the kids found disconcerting. The grown-ups loved it, though. It would be interesting to make this again with almond flour to see how it changes the texture. Overall, *I* thought the texture and flavor were great. Very simple to make. I used that English brand Terry's orange-flavored bittersweet (dark, not milk) chocolate orange ("Just whack & eat") grated into the batter. I think it intensified the flavor. If you like chocolate and orange, try this cake!

Really moist cake with just the right mix of chocolate, orange and almond flavour. Especially good for all those carb-conscious guests.

While this cake was delicious, it was very crumbly for some reason and fell apart when we took it out of the pan. I might add some melted butter to the batter if I make it again. We made a vanilla frosting for it, and everyone at the gathering praised it. This cake can make you popular.

We made this for our gluten free son-in-law, and everyone loved it. The only problem we had was the nut/sugar/chocolate mixture was thick and lumpy and did not "fold in" well, and we ended up with large bits after the egg whites were added. Consequently, we had to mix it with beaters, then beat three more egg whites, then folded it in, and it was delightful!

Took this cake to a friend's 50th birthday party and got lots of requests for the recipe. Instead of the orange chocolate sorbet, I made orange sherbet. A delicious combination!

I too was looking for the Chocolate Marscapone Cheesecake recipe... but it so happens that I recently made the flourless chocolate-orange almond cake recipe from Bon Apetit. It was wonderful, and received such rave reviews from everyone at the Passover Seder we attended (13 od us), that I made it again to celebrate Easter with my family - again, rave reviews. Since I didn't make the sorbet to go with the cake, I dusted it with confectioners' sugar and served it with fresh berries. It's now a requested favorite with our families.
