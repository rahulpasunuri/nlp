Yum! This recipe is both easy and delicious. Because there's so much cutting involved it takes a while (probably an hour and a half), but it's worth it. I nixed the 8 basil leaves at the end and substituted white onions for red onions.

Very boring, no flavor. Would never make this again.

Great dish, though awkward to eat. I recommend putting everything through a mincer before placing it on the bread.

I have a red dye and preservative allergy so we used lemon juice instead of the red wine vinegar. Delish! We also cut a left over loaf of sourdough into large croutons, tossed with olive oil and toasted- tossed with the salad. Yum!

Although I didn't care for the salad on the bread, because I found it awkward, the salad mixture was incredible. It took me back to what eating was like, growing up in a Croatian family.

I enjoyed this dish for dinner and lunch at work the next day. I did not get tired of it.

I made this side dish all summer long for my family and friends, and modify it depending on what veggies i have. It's perfect to put in a whole wheat pita and have as a lunch all by itself! I love this recipe
