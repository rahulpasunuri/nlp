What a lovely, lovely recipe. Just perfect. Although I purchase my jaggery at my favorite Indian food store online at www.indianfoodsco.com.

Excellent with just about everything! It made quite a bit and I froze it to use as marinade in the future. Served it at my bookclub and they all wanted the recipe! Yum!

I suggest using the Thai tamarind cooking concentrate. That way you don't have to mess with separating the seeds from the paste.

One of the very key ingredients in this chutney is grated ginger. Add about 2 tsp of it while cooking the sauce. Another ingredient is rock salt (called Kala namak in hindi). Add about 1/2 tsp.
