I skipped making the salsa by using my favorite spicy store-bought salsa. I boiled the shrimp in a fajita seasoning along with some chili powder and paprika. Chopped up the shrimp after they boiled and layered it all in a container. Delish and super simple!

I made this last summer for "Movies in the Park" in Chicago and they were a BIG hit. I thought that the flavors melded perfectly and can't wait to make them again this summer.

I made this recipe as published for friends visiting us from overseas - it was the first course for a picnic on the beach in Naples, Fl. Everyone raved about the flavor - I thought the shrimp salsa was delicious, packed with flavor. The three couples all asked for this particular recipe, which is very telling. Thank you! It was yummy, can't wait to make it again.

I really wanted to love this...and my husband did, but the flavors just didn't seem to meld together very well. The salsa was a bit...off...the shrimp seemed to be the wrong meat, and I used good ones. I probably won't make this again.
