After enjoying Renee Shepherd's wonderful "California Stuffed Chard" (uses ground turkey, no bread. Hence, much lower fat/carb/calories), I tried this for variety. Would NOT do again.

This was great! Delicious! I also did not tie these up into purses, it seemed too fussy for me also, and just not a great way to eat chard that is hanging over the "purses". I have made stuffed grape leaves for years, so I used that technique and it worked very well! I just sauted all of the leeks and it all went inside. I also found that it made 24 leaves, not 20, so just make sure you have more chard on hand. I used extra pieces of bigger leaves to lay over top of where you cut out the stems. I've been growing chard for MANY years and never made a rolled chard dish. I will definitely make this again, and you could even use this to make up your own recipe.

I made these but instead of the fussy purses I lined muffin tins ( silicone works extra well) with the chard, filled them, folded over. excellent and easy.

I made this for a party and they were a hit. Everyone raved about them. Yes, they are tedious to make, but the presentation is awesome, plus you can make them up ahead of time and bake when you need them. For vegetarian guests, just leave the sausage out of some of them, they are still tasty.

This was quite tasty but I didn't rate it because I made several changes. I used it as a clean-out-the-refrigerator recipe, and instead of leeks used a red bell pepper, some shallots, some garlic, and basil. The leek ties seemed WAY too much effort; I just folded over the leaves sort of burrito-style, which worked well. Also, my chard leaves must have been much larger than theirs (1.5 lb chard = 6 leaves!) so I had fewer bundles, which also cut down on the fuss.

This is a great recipe, but making the purses is a little fussy--even for me, a person who is always being teased for my complicated approach to food! It took two pairs of hands to do the tying. I'm making this again right away but this time I'll just roll the chard instead of tying up. Used a moderately spicy Italian sausage and it was great. I love chard and am excited to have a new recipe for it.

This was good - I used 2 parts Italian spicy sausage to 1 part sweet sausage - Next time I would use all spicy, since the whole meal (I made most of the menu) has sweet undertones already - would provide a nice balance. I also accidentally bought chicken sausage, pork would be much better.
