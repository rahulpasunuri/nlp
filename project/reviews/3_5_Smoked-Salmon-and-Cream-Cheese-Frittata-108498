YUM! This was the first frittata I've ever made and it couldn't have been easier. If you like bagels and lox, you'll love this recipe.

Fast, easy and delicious. This and the Mummers make for a perfect 2010 New Year's day breakfast.

This is the first frittata I made. I had friends over for brunch. It turned out perfect! Everyone enjoyed it and I was so pleased!

Mine didn't turn out as dainty looking as the picture, but very tasty nonetheless. Quick in the morning and makes you feel rather accomplished at so early an hour, with very little work involved.

My fiancé often makes me smoked salmon frittatas for breakfast. You can easily reduce this and make them single servings with smaller pans. I love frittatas because they are easily used with whatever you have on hand.

I had planned nothing for dinner.Knew I had eggs so looked up a "frittata" recipe.This was quick, easy and really good. My family loved it. I made it pretty much as recipe stated. Served it with Canadian bacon and homemade oven fries. Would make again.

I tried to make this lighter, hoping it would still work, and it did. I used 5 egg whites and 4 whole eggs, fat free half and half, low fat cream cheese, basil, green onions, parsley and gravlax salmon (has dill on it) and used Pam instead of olive oil. Wonderful.

We thought this was yummy. I did use half and half, didn't have chives so used green onions, used random herbs from the garden and odd bits of cheese along with the cream cheese, It was so tasty and so easy! Was that too many changes to rate this?

O.K., but had to be served immediately. Once it got cold it wasn't very tasty.

Love this as written, doubling the salt unless the smoked salmon is extra salty.(A good one won't be.)Tried a version with dill, parsley and scallions for the herbs and liked it too, but prefer the basil version. A great brunch or light supper.

To the cook from Menlo Park - I would omit the person who found the salmon overpowering!

Asparagus makes a nice topper to the meal, crisp and delicious blend with the smoked salmon flavor.

I made this for a brunch, all but one person found the salmon overpowering in this dish. Would make again omitting the salmon.

I made this for Mother's Day brunch and it was quite a hit. Personally, I thought it was a tad bland but the whole family enjoyed it-- next time, I will use higher quality smoked salmon-- I'm sure it would make it even tastier. And, it was so fast and easy to make.

Oh, my, yes. Had no chives or basil so used dill instead (not half bad with salmon, you know!). Also, used a 10-inch pan with no difficulties. Wonderful at brunch with a simple endive salad. Next time, though, will add more black pepper or even cayenne for a bite because the flavors are a bit bland.

I made this for brunch, and everyone loved it--one thing I'll have to remember for next time, though: make sure to press the salmon in; otherwise, it just sort of sits on top and looks like a pizza.

Just made this for the first time and it was great!! So easy - a great after church breakfast, simple and very good. Especially loved the cream cheese chunks. Even the kids liked it. Will definitely make it again!

This was easy to prepare. I added some shallots which gave it a little more flavor.

Have made this several times for a quick and easy brunch. Good at room temperature. Use a good quality smoked salmon, tho; last time we made it we used some cheaper smoked salmon from Sam's Club and, while the fritata was still good, the difference was clear - much better with a high quality fish. My 8 year old loves it too.

I served this for company brunch and got a lot of compliments. But I added some potatoes to it. Now I am going to try putting in some sweet onions.

This was pretty good. Not outstanding, but good. I'd add some of the chopped red onions to the frittata, and maybe punch it up a bit, but pretty good overall.

This was a wonderful and quick brunch dish. I added some lightly steamed asparagus along with the salmon. I also used 1% milk. The frittata turned out so colorful and springy. Served it with home-fried potatoes and onions and maple strawberry peach parfait. Did the whole brunch in under an hour! There wasn't a crumb left.

I always love to find recipes that are easy and delicious. This one fits the bill. I made it for a special brunch and everyone agreed that this is a real treat. Will add it to my favourites list.

I forgot to buy cream cheese, so I scattered little dollops of creme fraiche instead which worked nicely. I also added thinly-sliced boiled new potatoes which I had leftover from the previous night.

My husband and I loved this dish and it was easy to make. He took the leftovers to work for his lunch the next day. I used a bit more salmon than the recipe called for.

I slightly overcooked -- need to really watch this under the broiler. Decent taste though.

Made this for a Sunday brunch, and added sauted mushrooms. This was a big hit, and I would definitely make it again.

I've been making my own version of this dish for years and use a different technique which never fails. It begins with sauteeing finely minced green or red pepper and shallots or scallions in a bit of olive oil. Pour the egg mixture over, letting it set briefly on the stove. Then add your cream cheese in dollops all over the top and lay the whole smoked salmon slices on top. Place the pan in a preheated 425 degree oven for 15-20 minutes. It puffs and browns lightly. Let it sit for a few minutes before cutting into wedges for serving. Best success comes from either a Le Creuset skillet or their Tart Tatin pan.

A take off on Lox, Onion and Eggs...with a fresh bagel or bialy ,a hot cup of coffee and you've got the best breakfast around ! To New York Jews this was a special Sunday breakfast.I still consider it a treat,especially when you can get some real good smoked belly lox.

This worked for me and my family. We had it with sauteed spinach and bagels. I didn't use chives but instead chopped 1/2 an onion very finely and browned them before putting the egg mixture into the skillet. I also may have used slightly more salmon then called for in the recipe.

LETS SEE,I DID A COUPLE OF THINGS DIFFERENTLY...LEFT OUT THE BASIL,TOO STRONG FLAVOR FOR ME. GAVE THE PAN A QUICK SPRAY WITH PAM, THEN USED BUTTER FOR A WONDERFUL TASTE,AND USED A LOT OF FRESHLY GROUND PEPPER.WHAT A WONDERFUL BRUNCH...THANK YOU...
