I don't know what the fuss is all about. It's bland. I've had much better puddings than this, and they're lower in calories too. I make a pudding parfait with chocolate, butterscoth, and vanilla, and any one of those components is better than either of the puddings here. This is not worthy of anyone's time.

So I made this for a dinner party, as something a little different. It was good but nothing to write home about. I love peanut butter but this layer was way too sweet, it overpowered the chocolate layer. And it was way to peanut buttery. I am not sure if it was the fact that I used Jif low fat creamy peanut butter or maybe the fact that I de-sweetened the chocolate pudding simply by the fact that I used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate. But my review stands, the peanut butter layer was way too sweet and overpowered the other flavors of the dish. But that being said I was slightly surprised that peanut butter pudding was not to bad.

Added an extra quarter cup of peanut butter to the PB pudding, and it was perfect. Chocolate pudding was really delicious, but came out with lumps. Maybe will sift the dry ingredients next time? Easy, works as it says it will. Reese's cups lover enjoyed this combo!

Easy but needs more peanut butter, way more. That section of the parfait barely tastes of peanuts. I'll try this again but will ramp up the PB by a considerable margin.

The flavors were wonderful but the portions really were way too much. I divided the recipe into 6 portions as described and was sick to my stomach after eating one portion. - and I normally eat huge desserts! I would make it again but will definitely make 10 or 12 portions out of this recipe!!! Oh, and I used dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate. If you like Reese's cups, you'll like this recipe.

Our family prefers dark choc to milk choc, so I used bittersweet Ghiradelli instead of semi-sweet, and that was good. Adults & kids all liked this. However, next time I'll make this into 8 servings, as these were too big & filling after a full dinner. I didn't have enough time to chill for 2 hours, but 1 hour was fine -- it set properly, just was not cold. This was quite easy to make, and I had most ingredients in the house, so I'll probably make it again.

Outstanding! Have made repeatedly and I don't even like peanut butter. Added touch more kosher salt and used bittersweet chocolate, added tablespoon more peanut butter. Skipped the whipped cream,used martini glasses, garnish with swirl from aerosal whipped cream and rough chopped roasted peanuts. Holds extremely well without garnish in fridge and recipe doubles and triples well. Rich enough that you can halve each serving as well in smaller glasses.

Excellent and easy. Takes about 45 minutes total cooking time I have found. I was running out of time so I threw them into the freezer which greatly sped up the time for them to become thicker. Overall made it 2x and both times to great reviews.

i made a few adjustments and it was AMAZING. i increased the quantities a bit and used mostly (2%) milk and just 1/3 cup of cream in each pudding. i sweetened the chocolate pudding and whipped cream with agave nectar and served the whole thing as a trifle with two layers of graham crackers - one on the bottom of the bowl, one in between the layers of pudding. i sprinkled cocoa powder on top of the whipped cream on top. people were drooling! oh and yes, semisweet/dark chocolate for sure.

I only made the chocolate pudding part of this recipe and poured it into an oreo cookie pie crust. It was easy and really good! I will make this again!

Made this recipe last night. SO GOOD! It was really fast, easy, and amazingly delicious, albeit pretty decadent. (Couldn't quite finish it, but now I have leftovers-yay!) This is a really solid recipe especially if you are in the mood for comfort food. Will definitely be making again, although it might be fun to play around with a coconut, chocolate variation...hmmm.

didnt really liked it, the peanut butter part was good but in general it was too sweet, next time i would use dark chocolate.

These are both solid pudding recipes. Not too much cornstarch, but enough to get the job done. Like others, I doubled the salt in the peanut butter pudding and used bittersweet instead of milk chocolate in the chocolate pudding. Those were my only changes. An easy (if casual) weeknight dessert.

I only made the Peanut Butter part. It was Delicious!! though I think it would have been better if I had not used JIF.

so easy. so good. made this last night for part of a girls night dinner to rave reviews. skipped the whipped cream although i'm sure its great with and layered the puddings. hold the 1/2 the peanut butter pudding in the pan by pressing saran wrap on it. whisk it up before layering on the chocolate. yum

Kids and adults love this recipe. I used Trader Joe's all naturual (salted) peanut butter and thought it needed more salt in the peanut butter portion to bring out the peanut butter flavor. So, I doubled the salt and found it just right.

Mmm, lovely! Hubs made this for Valentine's Day dessert (as I watched and tried not to meddle). Added more PB since he's a PB addict, and skipped the whipped cream topping. Somehow it seemed there wasn't enough chocolate to make the layers equal. I would have liked more chocolate. A perfect dessert, and super easy and fast to prepare.

I agree that this pudding is very good, but it seemed to need some added texture to take it from good to fantastic. I'd suggest adding something to give it a little crunch between the layers, like crushed nuts (peanuts, perhaps!). The recipe is also rather sweet, so some of the other suggestions for bittersweet chocolate would probably work well.

Great pudding..very easy and yummy. Made it for a birthday party, it was loved both by adults and kids. Used 70% dark chocolate. Delicious and sinful with all the heavy cream... A real treat!!

I'm actually not a huge peanut butter fan and yet absolutely loved these. The PB is subtle and perfect. I also used a bittersweet chocolate over milk. It probably makes it less sweet and gives it a richer chocolate taste. Definitely really good. Oh, and no need for the whipped cream.

We loved this recipe. Knowing our dark chocolate fetish, we used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk and loved it! And, I added an extra tbsp (or two!) of peanut butter to give that pudding a little more kick. We loved it. We did not add powder sugar to our whip cream, instead using only cream, sugar and vanilla. Loved it and am already ready to make it again!

Excellent. I have made it for two different dinner parties and everyone loved it. I shaved some chocolate on the top of the whipped cream. Great presentation. I will keep it as one of my stand-by recipes. I highly recommend it-

FANTASTIC! If you are a peanut butter & chocolate lover you will flip over this and so will your guests. I used all milk (no cream) & semisweet chocolate chips and it still turned out great. The chocolate pudding was a hair lumpy, but that could be because of the chocolate I used or I let it sit too long-I don't think you need to wait the full 5 mins before spooning on top of the PB pudding.

I'm in total agreement with the boycott of whatever Mom's Kitchen is. I consider it sacrilege to violate the professionalism and collegial spirit on Epicurious in this fashion.

Ummmazing! I almost passed this one by. I thought "no egg yolks, no butter, how could this be a rich and creamy pudding?" It was wonderful, and as rich and creamy as any I've ever had! Don't be discouraged when making the peanut butter pudding---before the peanut butter is added, the base doesn't thicken very much, even with the cornstarch. When the peanut butter is added and brought back to a boil, it somehow instantly thickens the mixture. Can't wait to make this again, and again, and again. Cheers all, Jeff

Very easy, the peanut butter pudding especially is outstanding. I only had semi-sweet chocolate for the chocolate pudding, which was a little too strong. Milk chocolate would be a better choice.

This should be taken off of "Dinners."
