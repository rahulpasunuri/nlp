This is very easy to make but there is a fine line between dark amber and burnt, be careful and watch the sugar when it gets close to amber in color. I have Circulon cookware so there was no need for the brushing with water. Sauce thickens as it cools. The taste of carmel is creamy. Worked well with my Harvey Wallbanger cake.

Great recipe. I skip the brushing with water procedure by covering after the mixture comes to a boil and cooking on low for three minutes. This washes down the sides of the pan. Uncover and proceed as directed in recipe.
