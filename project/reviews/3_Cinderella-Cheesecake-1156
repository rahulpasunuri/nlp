Although I did not like this recipe or its reviews, I used its topping in a delicious Peanut butter cheesecake on the foodtv.com website under"peanut butter cheesecake"which was great. I used a chocolate cookie crust using Nabisco famous chocolate wafers. It was like a Reeses peanut butter cup in a cheesecake.

My husband loves this cheesecake. It takes longer than 35 minutes in the oven as the recipe states. He loves to bring it to work functions. It's always a hit!

great cheesecake--I've never made the brownie crust, always use a chocolate cookie crust. Very creamy texture.

I thought this cheesecake was terrible. I usually love peanut butter and chocolate combinations but this was an exception. There is no fairy-tale ending to the effort put forth to make this disaster.

I've been making this cheesecake since it first appeared 11 years ago. It ALWAYS gets rave reviews and turns out perfect! Depending upon my oven, (we've moved a few times) I have had to cook it longer. It actually gets 10 forks in my household

I am a devout cheesecake lover, but let me tell you, THIS WAS THE WORST CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER TASTED. The cooking wasn't nearly enough and the taste was just terrible. So be warned, that if you are trying to make something for that potluck and you think that this cake might be the dish. think again and search for another recipe.

DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE! It was a terrible disappointment. After baking it for more than twice the stated baking time, it still was not done. I had to throw the entire thing out-- a waste of nearly $15.

A different tasting cheesecake--well received by the birthday recepient. The cake has a brownie like crust-which you prepare in two steps (time consuming). The cheesecake interior is a velvet smooth consistency. I baked for 35 minutes (low altitude) and it was completely set with no cracks. Top is nice in appearance without topping. However, I did top the cake and doubled the sour cream topping. In lieu of piping peanut butter rosettes on top for garnish I crushed 3 peanut butter cups and sprinkled on. A word of caution--do not add peanut butter cups until just prior to serving, as they were a little soggy in appearance. Overall, the cake had a professional appearance and didn't taste bad--I just didn't like the crust. I also added three peanut butter cups (diced) into center of cheesecake--a nice addition. You should double this to about 6 cups to make an impact.

I made this cheesecake for a Christmas party, and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone loved it. It took a while to make, but it was definitely worth it. A very rich dessert. How can you go wrong with peanut butter and chocolate?

Every year I make my girlfriend a cheesecake for her birthday and a few years ago I made this. Although I never got a chance to try it out (they scarfed down the whole thing), she absolutely raved about it. It is very rich and a little time consuming to prepare, but she wants me to make it again

I made this cake when the recipe first appeared in 1991 and logged on to the web to find it after I lost my copy. I've always done a variation on this recipe. I use a chocolate graham cracker crust instead of the brownie crust listed in the recipe. I also add a few chopped peanut butter cups to the batter. Rather than use the sour cream topping in the recipe, i decorate the top of the cake with slices of peanut butter cups arranged in a little pattern. I've made this cake for many parties and it is ALWAYS a conversation piece. Never have to worry about leftovers!
