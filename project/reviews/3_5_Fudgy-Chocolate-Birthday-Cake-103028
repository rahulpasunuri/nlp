Deliciously decadent. For that special person on their special day. I've been making this cake each year for my daughter's birthday since 2000. We love the combination of chocolate and raspberries and the pink rose petals add the perfect touch.

Really good. Made as written, but have also made two cakes and topped each with strawberries. Yum!

Excellent! It was a huge success at a pot luck at work and a beautiful presentation. I added a layer of raspberrys between 2 nine inch layers and raspberrys on top which gave it a very expensive look.

Rating: 3
Really good but Really rich! Raspberries are required to balance this out. I put them between 2 cakes (9 INCH FOR 30 MIN) instead of the 8 inch cakes. I still think I should have added more raspberries to the inside to cut through the richness. I will try this next time with milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet. Overall we liked it a lot, but it's not a cake that you can eat more than one piece of.

I just made this again today. This cake is so delicious. I actually make it in a tube cake pan, bake at 350 for 45 minutes, cool for 20, then slice it through the middle to make two layers. I put lots of fresh raspberries between the layers too. I love it!

One of the best recipes I've tried this past year. My husband can't stop talking about it. He says it's the best chocolate cake he's ever had. This one's a keeper! Also increased the sour cream and only used 1/2 the chips in the batter. I had lots of extra frosting. Fresh raspberries in the center IS A MUST!

Rating: 4
Very very good and super easy. I made it with mini chips in the cake which I would do again and extra jam in the icing because I love raspberries! I put fresh raspberries in between the layers and it made a HUGE difference. It took this cake from good to amazing. Adding some raspberries on the top as garnish made it very pretty too!

Rating: 4
As with previous reviewers, I made this with the 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and the full cup of sour cream in the cake batter, which did not affect the baking time, but otherwise followed directions exactly. Have approx. 1/2 of icing left, but will freeze to save. Highly recommend this recipe.

Rating: 4
The frosting is what makes this cake special; it is so fudgey and decadent. Since it is extremely rich, it is important to cut the richness with fresh raspberries in between the layers. I will definitely make this cake again but will probably just make the cake according to the box directions.

This cake was not only easy but really moist and wonderful! I iced it with a brown sugar buttercream frosting (to die for) and filled it with vanilla cream custard which I made with brown sugar rather than white to go with the buttercream frosting. Everyone loved it. I will make this over and over again.

I made the frosting with strawberry jam and didn't add any sugar! The result was good (not excellent!)... I will try it again with raspberry

Great cake, although I made a bunch of substitutions. I used melted butter instead of the vegetable oil, 1/2 cup of strong coffee + 1/2 cup water instead of all water, a whole cup of sour cream, and only 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I frosted it with chocolate syrup frosting from the cake mix doctor. I had a house full of happy cake eaters and almost no leftovers.

I made this cake today for my daughter's birthday. I used 1 cup sour cream as other reviewers suggested and I reduced the chocolate chips--I would like to try the mini chips like someone suggested the next time I make this cake...and I will be making this cake again! The raspberry jam in the frosting was excellent. I also only used 1 cup powdered sugar for the icing . All in all a very tasty, moist, yummy chocolate cake! My family thought it was quite good.

If you want a little cake with your frosting this is for you. The "frosting", after it's on the cake, turns into fudge candy. It overpowers the cake. And why change the recipe on the box cake? The changes didn't do squat. And adding chocolate chips to the cake...Why? Yuk. This was not good. Needless to say I'll never make this again.

I made this and it was super easy and got rave reviews! I made it with 1 cup of sour cream as recommended in the reviews and the cake was nice and moist. I LOVED the icing. It was a good thing that I took this to a birthday party because otherwise I would have eaten the whole thing. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 4
Loved it! did it with only 2 layers instead of three (I discarded 1/3 of the cake batter) and I followed one of the suggestions here and added fresh rasberrys between the layers and it was a hit! it is heavy to eat, but a crowd pleaser.

With all the good reviews i thought I would give it a try. Easy to make, made as directed. This is not a recipe I would make again. The cake turned out fine but I did not get the compliments that most of you got from your tasters and I used quality ingredients. The box cake I made two weeks before got alot of compliments compared to this recipe.

Amazing cake recipe -- super moist and I use this recipe whenever I need a chocolate cake base. The frosting is great as well -- but you don't have to use it all of the time (some don't like raspberry flavor although I think it's great). This cake is always a crowd pleaser and the frosting works great on everything from cakes to brownies!!

I used strawberry jam instead but found the frosting way too sweet - I would use only 1 cup of powdered sugar next time. And, I would also try the 1 cup of sour cream in the batter. Overall the cake was mediocre.

I followed previous reviewers suggestions and added only 1/2 c. chocolate chips to batter, and 1 cup sour cream. I also used canned icing and added 1 oz. raspberry liqueur to the batter and 2 T. to the icing. I topped the cake with fresh raspberries and chocolate shavings, it was very pretty and Delicious! I made it for a birthday at work and everyone loved it! I've had three people come to my desk in the last 15 min. to tell me how good it was. I'll definately make it again, especially since it's so easy.

It's not necessary to add chocolate chips to the batter. So you only need to buy one package, for the frosting. I added thawed-out frozen raspberries in between the layers, which made it a lot tastier. Without them I think this cake would have been kind of boring.

Decadent. I must admit, I cringed when I saw that the recipe called for a box mix, but the end result was outstanding. I used 1 c. sour cream in the cake and mini chocolate chips.

i made this in 2 layers, not 3 and accidentally left out the sour cream in the cake mix. there was too much frosting and the raspberry taste was a bit overwhelming. if i do make this again, i'll use strawberry jam (but less than half a cup). as someone who usually makes boxed cakes (yea, yea, i know, save it for someone who cares) i find that this cake was just OK, not great.

I made this cake for my daughters 3rd B-day. Everyone absolutely loved it. It's a chocolate lovers dream!! I also used a cup of sourcream, it only made it creamier. I bought store made icing and layered it 3 times. I also skipped the raspberries. I will be making this cake very often. It is a fantastic favorite!

Rating: 4
The cake was divine. The first time I made it, I screwed up and ended up using 1 cup of sourcream in the batter. It actually tasted better this way (I made it as follows the second time, and I feel it was better with more sour cream). I used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips in the batter, which was just enough. I also topped the cake with raspberries and the presentation was wonderful. I think this is the best chocolate cake I have ever made!

Rating: 2
The fluffiness of the cake just didnt match well with the choc chips mixed into the batter, I recommend omitting them. The frosting, although tasty, is too rich and dense for such a soft cake.

This cake was excellent, but I think there was a little too much chocolate. Next time I make it I will definitely leave the chocolate chips out of the cake. It took away from the wonderful raspberry icing.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday. I invited his friends to come for cake and to surprise him. Being new to their scene I wanted a cake that would please both my beau and his buddies. This cake exceeded all expectations! They asked me if my cake flopped and if I had gone to a bakery to buy this one. They were all WOWED It was rich, dense, and moist. A perfect birthday cake for chocolate lovers. I used only half of the icing that I prepared.

I have made this 3 times now and it is always a rave--except for one thing. I accidentally put in the whole 1 c of sour cream the first time, and it was so good that now I do it every time.

Wow. Holy richness of chocolate. Very delicious, but you need to take it small doses with lots of milk. Absolutely fabulous and pretty easy to make, including the frosting. Frosting hardens quickly, so make it when you are ready to assemble the cake.

Great easy cake to make on a time crunch...but maybe next time will cut back on the powdered sugar on the frosting since I thought it was too sweet. Otherwise, received compliments on the moistness of the cake and the raspberry flavored frosting.

I've also made this with yellow cake mix and I like it even better that way.

This cake was moist, rich in flavor, & had a good consistency. I used only one pack on semisweet chocolate chips, but found that not all of the chips had melted... next time I'll use 1/2 cup of chips to make the batter and use the rest for the frosting. One last tip, when you are adding the frosting to the cake, make sure that the top cake layer is placed facing up, otherwise your cake will crack. For those of you who might find the taste too rich, try eating it with a rasberry sorbet, it makes all the difference! Enjoy!

Rating: 3
Great cake, but make sure to grease the pan really well or the cake will fall apart. I've made it without the chips in the cake and it's just as good! The frosting is great b/c it doesn't leave cake crumbs in it!

The frosting set a little more firm than I would have liked, but it was very well received by my co-workers. It was super easy to make and took no time at all. Great for a last minute cake that doesn't taste like it came out of a box.

Very good cake. I only used 1 bag (12 ounces) of mini chocolate chips - otherwise, the cake would have been too sweet. The mini chocolate chips melted and made the cake perfectly moist. The birthday girl was allergic to raspberries so I substituted strawberry jam. After I frosted the cake, I added strawberries on top. Overall, it's a good recipe for beginner cooks like me. I'll make my next cake from scratch.

I get SO many compliments on this cake!! One time I didn't read the receipt closely and yup, put in the 2 bags of chips into the cake batter...the first time I made it was for DH 4-0. Of course, he only likes it the 'messed up' way. It turned into like a Choc Raspberry Truffle 3 layer Torte. Of course, decorated with edible pansies, it's a fabulous treat!

Like it, don't love it. Very moist cake, but in the end I still think it's box cake. Used mini morsels and so glad I did because I think the large would have been too much. Brought in to work and everyone liked it and said it was very rich. Raspberry was subtle and I made (2) 8" rounds. Makes a lot of frosting.

Rating: 2
I don't usually make cakes from mixes but I was limited on time... I took the reviews seriously and cut back the mini chocolate chips by half in the cake. It turned out well - I used two 9" pans. For the icing, I used half of all the ingredients, used ghiradelli chocolate instead of chips, and added a big splash of chambord. I still had a little icing left over. It's very sweet - but tasty. For that much richness and sweetness, I'd rather make a mousse or a flourless chocolate torte. But it was quick and easy!

I'm famous for my chocolate cake b/c of this recipe! It's *so* easy! I use Pillsbury Devils Food Mix which usually goes on sale for 99 cents a box and just keep them in the pantry...I use 2 9in. round pans, because that's all I have and I didn't feel like buying 3 8in. pans just for this... It *is* very sweet and very chocolaty though...if you want you can cut back on the chips in the batter...but for 99% of my friends, that's their favorite part...jam and use a dash of raspberry liqueor though (and use the rest for pink champagne!)...use a springform pan and line the bottome with parchment paper and you can't go wrong....=)

A terrific, and easy, cake recipe for all occasions! I have made this for about 10 birthdays and it's always a hit. It also works well in cake molds since it doesn't require parchment paper -- I've done a dinosaur cake and a fire engine for my kids. The frosting recipe is a little too sweet, so I usually make a simple buttercream frosting instead (and can it for kids' cakes). Also, instead of the chocolate chips called for, I make it with just a half-bag of mini-morsels.

I completely forgot to add the chocolate chips at the end, but the cake was still great and was really fast! I melted 10 oz. choc. chips and then whisked in 1 cup cour cream for a great frosting - not too different from the one listed here. Everyone enjoyed it. This was a great way to make a cake from a box mix taste as though it was homemade.

This cake was delicious - but not for the faint of heart. It was rich and really made me think I might go into diabetic shock. I'm thinking of trying blackberry jam next time instead of raspberry. To all of the reviewers complaining about box mixes, who cares how a cake is made as long as it tastes good?

Rating: 2
The frosting was rather sweet. A warning however, do not make the frosting before the cakes come out of the oven (like I did) or it will stiffen up immensley, making it difficult to frost the cake! I do agree with the reviewer who said that this was like death by chocolate!

I didn't rate this one because I used a cream cheese frosting instead (I made it for my sons birthday party and had to have white frosting to put the decorations on.) It was great.

I am sorry, I haven´t made this recipe yet, but I must thank all you wonderful cooks that gave me an entertaining twenty minutes reading the reviews (once I started, I couldn´t stop!). I find terribly amusing how pride wins out in the kitchen... I MUST make this cake, if only to prove how delicious boxed cake CAN be, with some alterations. And to all those who complain on the amount of chocolate... ?!! Do the math... chocolate chips, devil´s food cake, chocolate frosting- I don´t know, but that sounds chocolatey.

Rating: 2
Very easy to make. A good recipe to have when you're pinched for time. Brought it to a holiday party - everyone loved it. I thought it was too chocolate, like death by chocolate- needed ice cream, perhaps on the side. Even received a complimentary call next day about the cake. I guess you have to love chocolate. The only thing I did different was I used raspberry pastry filling in place of the preserves. Would make it again, if I was in a hurry.

Rating: 2
The cake is very good. I did have a problem with the icing though -- I followed the directions exactly -- brought the jam and butter to a simmer over medium heat, removed the pan from the heat, added my chocolate chips, and what do you know, I ended up with grainy, overheated chocolate and had to pitch the whole mess. Luckily, I had some more chocolate cips on hand so I decided to wing it and put together an icing of my own (which incidentally turned out very nice). I have to say that I am a veteran from-scratch cake baker, but chose this recipe because, with a 6-week old newborn, I was looking for something quick and easy. Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed. So just a tip -- make sure the jam mixture doesn't get too hot. However, I don't think I'd take a chance on this icing again.

This is too funny. I've made this cake twice for parties and have gotten a lot of praise. For those of you who can't follow directions maybe you should buy a cake at a bakery.

This cake was delicious and easy. A good way to keep the chocolate chips from sinking to the bottom is to dust them with some flour first and then add them to the batter once it is poured into the pans. I substituted a different chocolate icing (sour cream based) to this cake because I don't like raspberries and it was a great match.

I just made this cake for a birthday party, and it was quite a hit. Everyone raved about how delicious and chocolate-y it was. One of the reasons mine was so good might have been because I accidentally put the entire 1 cup of sour cream in the batter, rather than the 1/4 cup that the directions specify! I panicked at first, but yum! It made the cake super moist and rich. I liked the chocolate chips, but then most of them stuck to the bottom of the pans so there weren't many left in the actual cake. The raspberry jam in the frosting is interesting, but does leave a bit of a strange aftertaste, so next time I might leave it out or try a different brand of jam. And for those who complain about using a box cake mix - get a grip! If you look at the article in which this recipe appears, you'll see that it's all about how to prepare quick desserts using convenience items when you don't have time to make them from scratch. If you don't like the thought of using box cake mix, then for goodness sake don't try the other recipes in that same article that call for using - gasp! - frozen puff pastry and prepared ice cream. If I hadn't made this cake myself, I wouldn't have known it was from a mix. And I've made plenty of cakes from scratch - including a killer Devil's food.

I'm one of those "snobby - from scratch" cooks who decided to step "out of the box" (ha ha). One of our supermarkets has just launched an Organic Chocolate cake mix with no junk in it and the recipe turned out delicious! I made it in a 9x13 pan and the only change I would make would be to leave out the chips - weird mouthfeel,but that's only me.

I baked this cake a few times when it first appeared in Bon Appetit and came looking for the recipe again today. I got a huge kick out of the controversy this cake inspired. It's always been a hit with everyone who's ever eaten it. No one ever says, "Oh this must be a a box cake - yuck!"

Wow, after reading all these reviews, seems people are complaining - about their own errors. if you would have read the directions in the FIRST paragraph - it specifies the specific measurements for the cake only. In anycase...when I have to make a "rush" cake - using a box mix - adding the sour cream makes a world of difference. The way i've done it in the past is to add 1/2 cup of sour cream and a small package of dry instant pudding mix - along with a 1/4 cup of either Kaluha or Baily's Irish Cream. WONDERFUL. Top it with some German Chocolate Frosting (the one with the coconut) and your set.

I made this cake for my chocolate loving husband for his birthday. It was amazing. Because of the chocolate chip in the batter controversy, I decided to leave them out. I added the extra raspberry jam, as recommended, but ran out of sour cream and ended up using only about 1/4 cup in the icing. Maybe that's why it was exactly the right consistency - not at all syrupy. I used 2 9" pans instead of the 3 8" pans, and had quite a bit of icing left over. Despite the alterations, the cake turned out super - my family raved.

I have not tried this recipe. But had to comment on the raging Box or Scratch War. I love to bake (from Scratch) 3 layers-5 layers--I can do it all (make my own creme fraiche) whatever. But I do do the occasional box--and you know what no one seems to notice--people are happy to have free cake and if you doctor it up--I guess they get confused...I know what boxed cake aftertaste is and you can avoid it by using Duncan Hinds--their butter cake and swiss chocolate are especially good. I find that the fudge/super chocolate/super super chocolate pudding in the mix types to be the worst flavors--but that is probably what everyone is buying in their quest for choclateiest chocolate flavor. I'm a lemon kind of gal (I make my own lemon curd too) Hurrah Hurrah

I'm from the UK this recipe was e-mailed to me as a suggestion for a birthday cake for my daughter. I'm one of those snobs too that think that 'from scratch' cakes taste better, but use mixes if I'm in a hurry. BUT I can't buy a packet of devils food cake mix so can anyone e-mail me with a recipe for that, then I'd love to have a go at it and rate it. But i will go with the people that think a recipe is something you make not just open and add water. I'll use a mix as I said in a hurry, but think I'd rather have a full recipe sent to me, because the recipe for this cake would be on the box, surely what this is is a recipe for a filling? If it had all the ingredients listed i could have made it today, but some of us don't have Devils Food cake mixes available so the recipe is useless to me as it is. also what is powdered sugar ? Isn't all sugar powdered ? We have granulated - in coffee, Icing sugar and Castor sugar which is ground finer, Assume that powdered is castor? Regards Ann

I suppose I am a creature of habit, but when I see the ingredients of a cake and then a frosting, I presume that the amounts stated are for that particular part of the recipe. e.g., the cake part of the recipe called for 4 cups of chocolate chips and 1 cup sour cream. There was no mention of "reserve 3 cups of the choc. chips" or "reserve 3/4 cup of the sour cream" - consequently, since I was in a big hurry to get this cake made for for brother's birthday luncheon, I just put the entire amount of the ingredients into the cake mixture. Thank goodness I only put one bag of choc. chips into the cake batter. THEN...when I got down to the frosting, I was short and had to go back to the store to get more sour cream while the cake was baking. Nobody at the party seemed to notice the difference and said it was good, but I personally was not satisfied. Regardless of my error in the measurements, I don't particularly like cake mixes and don't plan on making this cake again.

I had high hopes for this cake. The frosting turned out perfectly, but the cake, despite the addition of sour cream and chocolate, still had the tell-tale boxed mix taste. Don't get me wrong, it was a much improved cake mix cake, but still not as good as scratch. I will make this frosting again with a scratch cake.

I've made this cake half a dozen times and the results have been spectacular. I have also served it at charity auctions and other benefits -people fall upon it as if they're starving! The addition of good quality chocolate, raspberry jam and lots of eggs masks the distinctive taste of the box mix.

Rating: 4
The cake is absolutely wonderful. One suggestion is to make the raspberry jam from scratch (getting the seed out takes a few hours), churn your own butter, and make your own sour cream. The whole process takes about three weeks but it is definitely worth it. Then use your favorite scratch recipe so you can tell everyone all the steps you took to make the cake. If you don't have the time, I think the recipe as written makes an excellent cake.

How arrogant can you get, Ann Davis & Cook from Toronto, suggesting that anyone who prefers to cook from scratch cannot, by definition, have a life outside the kitchen ? I've never heard anything quite so ridiculous. Once in a while, I'll use a boxed cake mix; most of the time I cook & bake from scratch. I think it just tastes better - & I have a job, children, pets, a garden, voluntary work & a busy social life. Its probably time you two 'got a life'.

Whats the big deal between box and scratch!!!! If you don't like box then use scratch--If you have a life outside of the kitchen use a box--How simple can that be????

I made this cake for my husband to take to work for his boss' birthday. I used 3/4 cup raspberry jam in the frosting. Everyone loved it.

How do people get so snobby over boxed cake mixes vs. cakes made from scratch? I think a few of you are basing a little too much of your self-esteem on the fact that you bake completely from scratch!

All of you people fighting about this recipe, just stop. It is only a recipe and all you are doing is making yourselves look ridiculous! Aren't you supposed to be adults? I am 16 and I am more mature than some of you are acting!

My friends loved this cake. Loved it, bottom line. I myself wasn't so impressed. Just some chocolate chips mixed into a batter, but that combination alone was enough to make everyone else swoon. You have to be a real chocolate lover to appreciate this (I guess that doesn't describe me!). I didn't make the frosting, but put a canned frosting on it. No one cared -- they loved it! So, to tally: one "no" vote and lots of "yes" votes! I personally think that the Wellesley Fudge Cake recipe on the inside of the Baker's unsweetened chocolate squares box is a dream -- try it.

This recipe is a real "sleeper". Ranks right up there with the recipe for Sweetened Strawberries. I'd serve it following Hot dogs and boiled water. Delicious.

I thought that the cake was very good; but the frosting, for me, anyway, was a disaster. I halved the frosting recipe since others said the original recipe made a lot. It was not thick enough and the cake layers slipped all over. What a mess! It tasted great, but it is very chocolately (and I love chocolate). I think I would make the cake again but use a lighter frosting than this. I also think if I did use this recipe verbatim, I would make it into a bundt cake and use the frosting more like a glaze.

Can't we all just get along? Come on people, think about it....it's only cake! .....and a damn good one, I must say. I loved it - the frosting was delicious with the hint of raspberry flavor. The cake itself was quite delicious - very moist, and I liked the chocolate chips baked in, made some bites seem like a brownie. I will definitely make again.

Actually, Michigan, in essence, you DID claim this recipe to be "beneath you" by laughing at all the people who liked it. You are getting far too excited about some harmless comments-- I think it's YOU who should skip reading reviews if it upsets you to hear a difference of opinion. P.S. Toronto never singled you out-- guilty conscience, or what??!

It seems to me Epicurious reviewers are getting more snotty each instant. The people who gave this recipe a bad rap missed one critical step: trying it. I myself have not made this recipe, but if others like to, and enjoy the results, why should that bother me? We're not reading reviews to find out whether or not people think recipes are beneath them. If seeing a recipe featuring a boxed mix offends, turn the page and try something you do find tasty.

Unfortunately I can't try this recipe yet because living in England we just don't get the same great boxed cake mixes like you do back home! But you can be sure that when I come home this Thanksgiving I'll be loading up my spare suitcase full of Betty Crocker Moist Supreme - I do every time I go home - sad but true to all you expert cake bakers! And you know, every time I bake something with a boxed cake mix my English friends rave over it - but I don't tell them it's from a box - what they don't know won't hurt them - they just think I make awesome American style cake! P.S. I bring home boxed Italian style bread crumbs too but that's another subject!

Well, boxed cake mix may be better than anything the cook from Sangus, MA can makew from scratch, but it sure tates chemical-filled and gross compared to anything I make from scratch, and I'm not expert baker.

Perhaps some people just prefer the taste of cake mix. They just have different tastes. There is really no call in insulting anybody's baking skills.

One of my favorite flavor combinations. Love the ease and convenience of box cake mixes; use them all the time. Try the Butter Recipes, Chocolate & yellow. Maybe the previous problem was the result of using ...spreadable fruit...instead of JAM. It makes a big difference in the result. In a Cream Cheese Frosting, you CANNOT use low fat, it has to be the regular cream cheese, or it slides down the sides of the cake. SUGGESTION: substitute 1/2 c. dark Rum for 1/2c. water. Keeps the cake from getting stale longer. As you know the alcohol cooks out, just leaving the flavor... Instead of adding the Raspberry preserves to the frosting, spread it between the layers. Somehow it seems less sweet. Also, sprinkle Kalhua over the layers before frosting. Alcohol also evaporates.

Yummy! I made this for a birthday cake and everyone loved it. It was rich, delicious, and really easy. I didn't have any of the problems noted in previous reviews - so if you are thinking of making this ... don't cut the amount of frosting in half ... I had the perfect amount! Maybe everyone is being really cheap with the frosting, but please people, load it up and swirl it on the top, and all is better in the world I say. Also, maybe because everyone is adding extra jam their frosting is coming out soupy (?) ... I really don't know. But mine came out perfect. Every now and then you get a bite of cake with a chocolate chip in it - mmmmm. And you've just gotta love boxed cake mix! Way better than anything you can make from scratch! It's so moist! It is their job to make the absolute best cake possible, right? Why be in denial of that ... you know it wins hands down every time!

The frosted cake is quite good. It is extremely rich and intensely chocolatey, so much so that my children did not like it. The cake and frosting are easy to make, yielding a nice product for the effort required. Contrary to the experience of many others, I found the consistency of the frosting to be just right. I did not particularly like the tangy flavor the raspberry preserves and sour cream gave the frosting, though.

Iwas unimpressed with this gloppy, too-sweet cake. I made it for my three year old's birthday party; the kids just picked at it, while we grownups ate the other dessert. A quick recipe that TASTES like one...

I thought the frosting was way too sweet. I think using an all-fruit spread or seriously cutting back on the sugar would help. The cake itself was great but I found the frosting overpowered it.

I made this cake for a group of 12 friends and it was a hit. It was very rich and lots of dense chocolate flavor. I didn't have any problem with the cake sticking to the pans. I did grease the pans (2 9inch pans instead of 3) and then lined each pan with wax paper. Then lightly greased the wax paper and dusted with flour. No sticking at all. I also tossed the chips with flour as suggested by another cook. They didn't sink to the bottom ( I used Ghirardelli). I followed the directions exactly for the frosting and thought it was great, especially with the raspberry flavor. It was not runny at all, just right. However,I did have lots of extra frosting. I wasn't sure if I could freeze the extra or just cut the recipe in half next time. I would make this cake again for the chocolate lovers in my family.

Made this for my brother's birthday. He's a big chocolate fan & loved this. I thought the cake itself was excellent & very moist, not TOO sweet. Had a minor problem like some others with choc. chips sticking to the pan but no big deal. Even though I tossed the chips with flour, they still sunk to the bottom of the layers. (I made 2 9 inch layers). The only real change I made was to the frosting. After following the recipe, it seemed WAY too sweet and goopy -- kind of like a very thick chocolate syrup. I wanted a slightly lighter taste & texture, so I added about 4 oz. of cream cheese which added a great flavor & a somewhat lighter consistency. I should have followed others' advice & cut the frosting recipe in half, however, since I had A LOT leftover. Overall, a success and a nice way to save a bit of time starting with the mix.

Coming from a family of chocolate cake connoisseurs I can honestly say this cake is beyond 4 forks, but; it does require a taste for chocolate. As for those who think from scatch is better get over it. I make cakes from mixes for family, friends, and coworkers all the time and get rave reviews for my made from "scratch" cakes all always asking where I find the time to make them. A trick for greasing and flouring the pan with out having flour still on the outside of your cake or having it taste like flour is to mix 1/3 cup each oil, crisco, and flour until smooth and then baste your cake pans. Store in air tight container in cabinet. P.S. I do have made from scratch recipes and nobody not even my sister-in-law who insists on home made can tell the difference between my box and made from scratch but of course I always let her think its home made

This cake was a hit at my daughter's 3rd birthday party! I doubled the cake recipe and made a sheet cake instead (took about 10-15 minutes longer to bake). I made 1 recipe of the frosting and still had quite a bit left over. After reading other reviews I decided to halve the amount of chocolate chips called for, increased the jam to 3/4 cup, floured the chocolate chips and greased the pan with shortening and dusted with cocoa. All worked to perfection. Thanks to all!

I was excited to try a recipe using a cake mix as I thought it would take a lot less time to make and turn out delicious as many reviewers promised (I rarely, like almost never, make cakes that aren't from scratch). I was disappointed in this recipe, however, and felt it was too much work and not good enough to make again. I thought it was way too sweet and chocolatey (imagine, something too chocolatey!). Next time, I'll stick to a simple, made-from-scratch cake or buy the cake mixes Williams Sonoma sells that aren't much simpler than doing it yourself, but are fantastic!

Fudgy is definitely the word for it. Too fudgy for my taste and most everyone who tried it. I did like the taste of rasberry in the frosting and will try that again. The cake might have been better w/o the chocolate chips.

Absolutely Fabulous! I'm a great lover of chocolate and I definately got my chocolate fix with this recipe. I, too, mistakenly added all of the sour cream in the batter (but then decreased the amount of oil) and loved it. I also added additional jam with great results. This recipe is so easy with wonderful results.

To avoid sticking, grease and flour the pans. Also toss the chocolate chips with flour before adding to the batter to prevent them from sinking to the bottom.

I have made this cake twice. Both times it was great. The first time I made a mistake and put all of the sour cream in the cake. It still turned out excellent. The 2nd time I put a little extra sour cream in the cake (since it turned out so great the first time). The frosting was delicous. I used 3/4 cup of rasberry jam and it had a nice flavor. I can't imagine any chocolate lover not enjoying this cake.

I read all the advice, and I cannot belive the issue of the frosting being *way* too watery has been ignored so much. I followed all advice about increasing the jam, etc. I used the frosting recipe on a different but very similar in spirit chocolate cake recipe. I refrigerated it for an extremely long time, added extra sugar, etc, and I was still left with something more like a drippy glaze that caused my cake layers to slide off of each other. I almost cried, thinking after this big mess I'd made of my kitchen I would have to go out and buy a cake. After hours of refrigerating and intermittently readjusting the cake and slopping on more frosting, it *finally* set and actually held together. However, it was kind of ugly at this point. Certainly not pretty enough for a so-called birthday cake. I took it to work for someone's birthday and everyone liked it. However, I personally just thought it was not worth the messy troble at all. It wasn't as fantastic as everyone else seems to think -- I could have bought frosting out of a can and used raspberry jam between layers of the cake to achieve almost exactly the same effect with none of the stress. The idea is excellent, but the actual proportions in the recipe just plain suck.

This cake is fabulous! I had no problems with the cake at all. I sprayed the pans with Pam and lined the bottoms with parchment, and had no sticking whatsoever. I did use about 3/4 cup raspberry jam in the frosting, which was wonderful--tangy, slightly sour, and full of chocolate flavor. I will never lose this recipe. I started baking at 11:00 and had a frosted masterpiece less than two hours later.

Great cake. Non cake-fan adults ate it up! Increase rasp jam to 1c, but then reduce choc chips 1/2 to 1c as icing yields more than needed. Or use extra another time. If needed whole may be milk-free: mix 2/3c tofu, 3 tbs oil & 1 tbs lemon juice to make sour cream sub; use 3 tbs olive oil in icing instead of butter. Result is rich & delicious.

I made this cake as cupcakes for a party at my office. They came out wonderful and everybody raved about them. The cake batter made about 27 cupcakes. They took about 22 minutes to bake. There was so much icing that I really piled it on each one, but everybody liked it that way. This was a very easy recipe. The raspberry flavor in the icing was great.

I baked this for our son's first birthday -- it was so good that he decided to smear it everywhere! The frosting was very sweet -- next time I will try All-Fruit spread instead of jam, which contains a lot of corn syrup. Perhaps bittersweet chocolate instead of semi-sweet. The cake was delicious and will become a birthday tradition.

Made this for my daughter's sixth birthday party. The kids actually ate the cake and commented on how good is was. Kids at birthday parties usually pick at the frosting and don't really eat the cake. Very rich. I used lots of shortening (not butter) to grease the pans and dusted with cocoa powder. The cake did not stick to the pans at all. It would probably be better with more raspberry jam in the frosting.

I made this cake for a co-worker's birthday and received rave reviews as well as requests to make it again! I took the advice of other reviewers and used parchment paper to line my pans, and increased the amount of jam to 3/4 cup. The cakes came out of the pans effortlessly, and the frosting was delicious-just enough raspberry flavor, and yet, not at all over-powering. I decorated the top with chocolate curls and candles. It looked and tasted delicious!

I made this for my husband's birthday -- it was FABULOUS. I used parchment paper after preparing the pan and didn't have a problem with anything sticking. I made a mistake and put the entire 1 cup of sour cream into the cake (oops), but didn't notice a problem. For the icing I also cut back on the chips to 2 cups, cut the butter down to 1/2, but kept the same amount of raspberry jam to get more of a raspberry flavor, and it was the perfect amount of icing -- I had a tablespoon or two to put on graham crackers for the kids. This is going to be a special event cake in our house

After finally finding 3 8" cake pans (harder than I thought), I proceeded to make the recipe. Unfortunately, the mixture stuck to the pans (even after buttering)and the cake was relegated to a crumbled mess. The taste of the cake and frosting, however, was out of this world! To avoid the batter sticking to the pan,I think I will try the cocoa powder hint from another reviewer the next time around.

I agree with the other reviewers. This is a delicious cake, and it is extremely easy to make. Beware, however. The cake is for chocoholics only. It is very rich and almost too chocolatey for some. I too experienced the minor problem of some of the chips sticking to the pan after baking.

This cake is delicious! I powdered my well-greased pans with a mixture of cocoa powder and flour, which added even more flavor. The only disappointment I found was that some of my chocolate chips stuck to the cake pans. Next time I'll line with parchment paper, then grease. I also topped the cake with chocolate curls from an entire huge chocolate bar. So divine!

This recipe was fantastic and so easy. I was a little worried that is would be too rich so I did not add the chocolate chips to the cake and only used 2 cups and 1.5 cups powdered sugar and still had too much frosting!! (I baked mine in 2 9 inch pans). I would add more rasperry next time because you could barely detect the flavor!! Everyone loved it!! And oh, so easy
