The spice was a bit mild for my taste- I'd say add and extra pinch or two of each. I made them and loved them. They're also really good dipped in chocolate.

These cookies are delicious but watch out because they burn easily due to the low moisture level of the batter. I glazed them with some orange icing, which was a good pairing.

Overall, I think that these cookies are very good, and are very easy to make. I kind of agree with the other reviewer who said that these cookies are nothing special, but there are times when you really just want a nice simple cookie. Because of some of the other reviews, I was paranoid about overcooking them, so I actually undercooked them. Most of my cookies were lightly browned on the edges, like the recipes said, but there was one that was more thinly sliced and therefore cooked faster and came out darker, and it was the best in the batch. So don't be TOO anxious about overcooking them. The spice is nice, but next time I might add a little more cloves or salt next time. Nice and easy.

These are very good but require a close eye. My first batch-- 375 for 12 minutes -- had many burned cookies. I did the next batch for 11 minutes at 350 and they were a tad too pale. I don't think my oven is perfectly on temperature, but nonetheless, the oven time must be monitored closelya t the end.

I made these for a neighborhood wine-tasting party. I omitted the almonds but added 1/2 cup of unsweetened cocoa to the flour. Before I refrigerated the dough logs I rolled them in a little sugar mixed with crushed black pepper. The black pepper made the cookies extra spicy and brought out the chocolate taste. For those who have tried the chocolate version of these from epicurious I highly recommend simply using the cocoa since it did not change the consistency of the dough.

I've been searching for this recipe since I made it for christmas 2 yrs ago. They are so good. The spice and the almond are a perfect compliment to the already wonderful butter cookie. The spice level is perfect anymore and it would be overwhelming.

A good recipe if you are making cookies in bulk for Christmas gifts. I was short the amount of almonds called for in the recipe, so I added some chopped walnuts. I also topped the cookies with sanding sugar and very finely crushed toasted pecans, which added nice flavor and texture.

I liked that these were quick cookies and I got a lot of them out of one batch. They were good, but nothing special. Watch them carefully as they get overdone really quickly.

I loved this twist on the basic butter cookie. The taste was great and slicing the cookie log was so easy compared to rolling out dough!

The cookies were delicious. They were acutally better the second day. The blend of spices were perfect. The only thing was I had to turn my oven down to 3.25% because they were browning too much.

A new favorite in my house! This wonderful, crisp, spice cookie is perfect with a cup of tea or a little eggnog. The dough is easy to handle once it's chilled. Be sure to remove the cookies from the baking sheet after 3 minutes like the recipe says--otherwise they do stick (if this happens, just reheat them a little and they'll release just fine).

I found it hard to shape these because the dough was so soft. Next time I will refrigerate after mixing to get the dough a little harder for shaping. Sliced and baked, these make a nice new shape for the cookie plate. They remind me of pecan sandies - except they're made with almonds.

These are an excellent tweak on the Basic Butter Cookies. I had no problem making up the dough and found the cookies easy to cut after four hours in the fridge.
