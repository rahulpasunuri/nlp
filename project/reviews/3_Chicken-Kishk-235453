A friend of mine, Aziza, introduced me to this recipe a decade ago. In the meantime my friend lost her battle with cancer and I lost the recipe. I was thrilled to find it here. I love this dish! It tastes even better when you cook the onions to a dark brown.

I agree with the cook from Houston- not so much work but ZERO flavour. Blah...
