I fiddled a bit with this recipe, and as for that-Of course, with certain recipes that are standards/classics/basics you'd want to follow them to the letter, but with ones like this, you can judge it on the structure and many ingredients are interchangeable. I subbed sliced fingerling potatoes for rice as a starch, and sauteed them with onions and zucchini. Also added a dash of skim milk and about 1/2c mild cheddar and 1/4c parmesan to the eggs, with chives and basil, and a pinch of cayenne because I love a bit of heat. The chard and spinach was a great combination, but other wilted greens could be delicious too, as well as any number of herbs added to the eggs

Wonderful, but I added cheese. I mixed 6 ounces of grated Swiss cheese into the beaten eggs, along with a big load of chopped herbs (parsley, basil, and cilantro). I finished the breadcrumbs off by broiling. You can also do what I did and use what you have in terms of totaling 6 pounds of vegetables. I didn't have enough spinach or chard but compensated by using more zucchini, so that the total was still 6 pounds. I'd like to try this with all greens, as in 3 pounds each of spinach and chard. I also think using butter for some of the oil would make it especially divine, as would mixing some grated parmesan or romano cheese with the breadcrumbs.

Chicago made me laugh - as a creative cook I often make changes from the outset. I am looking for inspiration, rather than instruction and I trust my experience. I used chard and kalem two types of summer squash and skipped the rice. Reduced the eggs and added half & half. Great!

Wow, that last reviewer is too judgemental. I happen to think good cooks are flexible and take inspiration from recipes to create something unique to them. And the hallmark of a good recipe is it's flexibility and useability in the average home. Clearly this recipe has all that! And it's good as it is written too.

How can you rate this recipe if you don't follow the recipe? Doesn't anyone follow the recipe the first time and then make changes the second time? You people are not real cooks!

Like other reviewers, I love the way this recipe can go in different directions. I used a pound of chard and no spinach, a few leftover peas, parmesan and sheep's milk cheese (not too much) and fresh basil. Fresh herbs really make this sing.

I didn't use chard, but increased the spinach and added some asparagus, green beans, and onion, all diced. As written, this would be bland and as I made it, it still needs fine tuning. The spinach tastes excellent in the dish, though, especially with a spritz of lemon juice. I'll stick to spinach, zucchini, onions, garlic, some thyme, red pepper flakes, black pepper and a little nutmeg. Topping it with grated romano is really good. The cooking temp or time was off as it took 40 minutes, not 20, but I think I used too deep a baking dish and will use a 9 x 13 next time.

I was inspired by the word "gratin" to modify the recipe a little. I beat the eggs with a little heavy cream and added lemon pepper, cooked the zucchini with goat milk butter and also buttered the gratin dish instead of oiling it. I omitted the chard (as I don't like it) and added a little freshly grated good parmesan in the veggies and as part of the topping. I thought this added a lot of flavour to the recipe, which could be a little bland, but healthy. And comparatively with Jeffrey Steingarten's potatoe gratin, it is very light indeed! ;-))

Otherwise known as 'tian', and originating in Provence, South of France. Can be made with any one of the greens, or with other vegetables (eg pumpkin). Delicious, easy, satisfying and non-obviously vegetarian. Good with tomato salad (for colour) or another of contrasting colour.Good cold, too!
