I used cream cheese rather than manchego. It made for a great combination and would make it that way again.

Pretty good. Looks impressive and interesting flavor, but the manchego cheese didn't melt.

i have never used guava paste before which is how i found this recipe. i wanted to try it. it is so sweet & so interesting! i shreaded the cheese because most people commented on the fact that it did not really melt. it did not melt this way either, but i grew to kind of like the contrast of that texture against the sweet gooey guava. i could not find any form of passion fruit anywhere so i pureed fresh pineapple with some papaya. it was very sweet, and not needed. i had the rest of my pouches without it. i want to do the same next time but change the cheese to cream cheese, wrap in a gyoza & deep fry.

I almost skipped this recipe based on the review from A Cook from San Franciso but I went to the website and I saw that it was powered by Amazon, I went to their website and found it in less than a minute. A little research doesn't hurt.

I was happy to find this recipe as I had both guava paste and manchego to use, but I was disappointed in the texture. The cheese didn't melt and stayed too hard although the flavor was OK. It's not hard to make and the pouches baked fine. My husband brought them to his office where the Hispanic staff absolutely loved them. I will try this again with either a fresher manchego or different cheese.

This is amazing. Made it for 8 guests and everyone loved it. Passion fruit was not in season when I made it so I used passion fruit juice and some papaya.

This recipe was a big hit with about two thirds of my dinner guests, but the others disliked the combination of sweet and spicy flavors. Eh, what can you do? Finding passion fruit was the hardest part, followed by the guava paste. I think the paste I found had been on a shelf for a long time as it never quite melted with the cheese and had the consistency of gummy bears when done - not necessarilly a bad thing, just not what I imagine the recipe was after. The pouches weren't as hard to make as you might guess from reading through the recipe either.

We had this at a party where the hostess had made 10 (!) lovely desserts and this was by far the most delicious...crunchy outside, creamy inside, sweet and hot in flavor. A really unusual and excelent dessert
