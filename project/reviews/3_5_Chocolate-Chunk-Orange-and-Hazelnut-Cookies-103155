Tasty cookies! I used a bag of Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chunks and no nuts (I was baking for a group and one person was allergic to nuts). The group liked the cookies.

As if these weren't the best cookies you have ever eaten.......you can add to the uphoria by adding some sea salt on top at the end. I can't tell you how many compliments I have gotten on these cookies. They are not too sweet. The orange adds depth while the nuts add crunch ( I use saled roasted almonds). These are awesome!!

great cookies, but, as stated before...too many flavors. For the time, effort, and expense, I would leave out the hazelnuts if I made them again. (or maybe the orange). yummy, but not amazing.

I love, love, LOVE these cookies. I find they always turn out amazing and are always a hit with everyone who tastes them. I have never actually used hazelnuts or chocolate chunks...I just substitue a few handfulls of dark chocolate chips and a couple handfulls of either chopped pecans or walnuts (whatever I have on hand). If you like the combiniaton of orange and chocolate you will love these...they are tasteful but not overpowering.

Like a perfume or wine, these cookies have layers of flavor: orange, chocolate, hazelnut. There's just enough dough to hold those flavors together. I use the big dark chocolate chips from Rapunzel, cut in half. The bags contain nine ounces, so they are just the right size.

One word: meh. For some reason, these didn't taste like much of anything to me. Maybe because there are three flavors competing here? Not sure. Slightly disappointing, because the dough tasted so good.

I made these cookies recently and they are divine, but altered the recipe...the amount of orange peel, chocolate chips and hazelnuts is way, way too much! I added only a third of each. I added just enough until the dough was full of chips and nuts...next time I will just double the cookie dough recipe. I served it with orange brandy on ice. Heaven.

I tried husking the hazelnuts by misting them with water and then roasting them at 400 for 5 mins ( per a tip I saw online). This did not work at all. I used the hazelnuts - husks and all - in the recipe. I think next time I will just use walnuts instead. I agree with some of the other cooks - the amount of batter didn't seem sufficient compared to the amount of chocolate and nuts used. Some of my cookies fell apart because there wasn't enough cookie to hold them together! I think with a couple of tweaks this could be a REALLY good recipe (especially using another cook's suggestion to add some Grand Marnier - yum!). As it is, it's just so-so.

I write this as a batch is baking upstairs. I decided to add a new cookie to my Christmas repertoir, and I am SO GLAD I chose these. VERY VERY GOOD. I actually used fresh orange juice from two oranges and quartered the amount of orange zest. Very sophisticated tasting. Very good. Breaking up chocolate is time consuming but worth it...these cookies are GREAT!

It took forever to husk the hazelnuts. I was hoping the outcome would make all that time worthwhile, but I thought the cookies were just so-so.

If you live near a Trader Joes you can get hazlenut pieces already husked. I will never do it myself again!

These were good and relatively easy to make. I used only 6 oz of bittersweet chocolate chunks (Hershey's Dark Chocolate Bar - which is a cross between semisweet and bittersweet) and it was perfectly adequate. I also cut down a bit on the hazelnuts. As stated in an earlier review, the cookies stay mounded and do not flatten out, for a more "cakey/spongey" texture.

I have made these cookies a few times. I really like the recipe. I like that they are not too sweet. Although, the hazelnuts are a PAIN! Too much work for me. I substitute pecans or walnuts. Otherwise, good stuff!

These didn't turn out as deliciously as I'd hoped. I had made a double batch, and I think I'd reduce the amount of hazelnuts. (The hazelnuts -- skinning, toasting, crushing -- were not worth the work). I had to add to the double batch one recipe's worth of cookie dough (minus the orange zest), and that helped. I couldn't keep these from overbaking, even as I reduced temp and time, though. Tasty, but not spectacular.

Try this trick. Mix the cookies in advance, wrap in parchament paper, and refrigerate. Just before dinner, drop cookies on a non-stick sheet. Bake while your guests are eating dinner. Then top warm cookies with rich vanilla bean ice cream and Amaretto hot fudge. The house smells as delicious as the sundaes taste!

Awesome cookies! I didn't have any hazelnuts so I added chopped cashews and it was very good. Very easy to make and would definitely make it again!

Loved this cookie. The combination of the nuts, chocolate and hint of orange makes for a very classy, adult cookie. Only thing I'd chnage next time is that I'd use milk chocolate only instead of half milk and half bittersweet as I did now. But that's personal preference of course.

I thought this recipe was a great change from plain old Toll Houses. I did think the proportion of chunk to dough was a bit high, and wanted them a little flatter. The second time I made them I doubled to dough part, used 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar, and added about a tablespoon or so of half and half. The cookies were the perfect proportion and texture (at least for me).

This didn't work for me, although I followed the recipe (except using chocolate chips instead of chunks). The cookies never flattened out like a good chocolate chip cookie should, and the taste was ok but not great.

Easy and Delicious. The hazelnuts were difficult to skin, but the cookies were soft and tasty. I also used semi-sweet chips and the cookies were yummy-several requests for the recipe.

Amazing cookies! So easy. I blended by hand and they turned out great -- no need for electric mixture. They looked delicious and were the perfect chocolateyness and chewiness.

Fabulously delicious cookies. I did alter the recipe, though. I made a double recipe, and instead of using 2 and 1/2 cups of sugar I used 2. And they were very much sweet enough. Also, the cookies lose nothing if you make 'em with semi-sweet chips.

Awesome! A friend said they were the best chocolate chip cookies he has ever had! The flavor combo of orange and chocolate is wonderful; I did use walnuts instead of hazelnuts and they worked out fine.

These are terrific cookies, very 'grown-up'. My husband couldn't stop with 5 (!!!!) so I had to hide them in the freezer!

I have made this recipe a couple times and people have raved both times. I'm a chocolate lover, so I would not change the bittersweet chocolate. I may try another reviewer's suggestion and add Grand Marnier next time.

This recipe will very likely find it's way into my regular rotation, to appear where I would usually make plain chocolate chip cookies. Next time, I might substitute Ghiradelli semi-sweet chocolate chips for the bittersweet chocolate bars. Other than that, it's a great recipe.

This is an excellent cookie. Easy to make, good-looking & scrumptious. I made it exactly as written, apart from reducing the grated orange zest to 3 teasps. It still seemed sufficient. I used Ghirardelli Bittersweet chocolate & the toasted & chopped hazelnuts from the Baker's Catalog (great source). Also used baking parchment & the cookies spread exactly the right amount & weren't too brown on the bottom. The cooking time is just right too. Altogether, a definite make-again (& again).

I used a combination of coarsely chopped (by hand) pecans and walnuts and a mixture of jumbo milk and jumbo double-dark chocolate chips. Next time I'd use all milk chocolate in this recipe--the dark seemed to overwhelm the cookie. To intensify the orange flavor, I added 1 T grand marnier with the vanilla, and I used about 1/4 c finely chopped candied orange slices (both peel and flesh) instead of regular orange peel. Altogether, I have to say this is my favorite chocolate chip cookie dough: it makes a reasonable, not huge but not tiny, amount, and it is of the "spongy" (rather than gooey) variety of cookie--my preference. My husband still prefers a gooey chocolate chip cookie with oatmeal and espresso in the dough, but this was great. I highly recommend trying it with the milk chocolate chips and the candied orange.

A nice cookie to serve with a latte - beware! Super rich!

Great cookie. Hazelnuts are wonderful...really good taste. Appeared a little dry as I put them in the oven -- but came out fine. Took them to a dinner party along with the giant chocolate toffee cookies in the same spread--people had the chocolate toffee cookies previously and loved them. Voted these a tie!!! They couldn't decide which ones to take for seconds!!!

One of the best cookies I've ever made. However, I didn't use 4 tsp orange peel...I only used the peel of 1 1/2 large oranges. The orange flavor was subtle.
