So easy, so good, so healthy. You can add other seasonings to change the flavors.

A little too much oil I think, but YUM.

Very good. But cooked/browned faster than recipe.So they seemed starchy.Next time I'll start w/lower oven then raise. Also, need to season well.

Great, easy recipe. Healthy, delicious and both husband and toddler enjoyed it more than other fries. I also sprinkled with Parmesan.

I also added fresh chopped rosemary from our backyard. Was soooo easy, and no leftovers. Will definately be making again.

If you've got a toddler in the house, this easy-to-make dish is perfect. It goes over big with my two-year-old and my husband and I enjoy them, too. This recipe is much healthier than the fried version, too. Try sprinkling on a little chili powder for extra zest.

Easy and well accepted. I did make a number of times and last time I sprinkled on some grated Parmesan cheese at the end,baked until melted and crusted...WOW, good..try it.
