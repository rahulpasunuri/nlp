For those unfamiliar with Chinese black vinegar - it's extremely similar to Worcestershire sauce and interchangeable. Hope this helps!

SO GOOD! I tend to dislike noodle dishes that use thickened sauces so I was looking forward to trying this and was not disappointed. I made two adjustments: I didn't have Chinese black vinegar so used rice vinegar (don't know how that compares to the real deal but the result was tasty).. I also chopped and steamed about 10 bunches of yu-choy and mixed it with the noodles for added nutrition. This is a definite keeper - fast and yummy.

This was great, with edits... I grilled the chicken (because it was too hot to have two pots boiling). I used 1 or 2 tsp http://importfood.co m/cppt0304.html (chili paste) and a tbs of canola instead of the chili oil... I forgot the garlic... I used pre-cooked soba noodles from WFM... I used shoyu soy sauce instead of the light/dark... I used 1 tbs cider and 2 tbs rice vinegars... I put it on a bed of shredded cabbage... I topped it off with cilantro and peanuts (per another reviewer's suggestions)... and finished with some thin slices of orange & red peppers. There's garlic in the chili paste I used, so I didn't miss it... next time, though, I'll use a bit of minced garlic and minced fresh ginger just for fun. Great recipe to play with!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very good that night. But then I went to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day and they were awful - it doesn't keep.

I made this dish for a last minute dinner w/friends and everyone raved. Definitely my new favorite noodle dish. I used rice vinegar in place of black, and sesame & dried red pepper instead of chili oil. I ended up adding a Tbs of miso to the sauce and a cup of veggies, which punched up the flavor/interest a lot.

Very tasty! I used 2T. rice vinegar in place of the 3T. dark vinegar which I didn't have. I agree with another reviewer, it could use a little something... steamed or stir fried vegtables would make it great!

This was easy and a definite hit: everyone raved. works well hot or cold. has nice flavour without being too spicy.

This dish was missing something. It was an unappealing dull brown...it needs something bright, like grated carrots. The taste was ok, but nothing special.

I used only regular soy sauce, balsamic vinegar instead of chinese vinegar, and peanuts instead of soy nuts. Excellent. My husband loved it. Will definitely make it again(and try it with the right ingredients).

I made a lot of changes, and the dish still came out great. First, I used fresh yakisoba noodles - available in 4-lb packs at Costco. Instead of dark soy, I used all light soy sauce. Instead of black vinegar, I used white wine vinegar. To the dressing, I added 1 T minced fresh ginger, and I garnished with cilantro leaves instead of green onions. Then, I served it up on a bed of romaine lettuce chiffonade - that gets mixed into the noodles and adds a lot of texture, color, and crunch. I just had the leftovers for lunch and it was delish! Great for a cool meal on a hot day.

This was really good and easy to make. I actually put the sauce on the stove for a short time since I wanted to add some shitake mushrooms. I forgot to stir the sauce first though and the mushroom soaked up a lot of vinegar. Will definitely try this again sometime and actually shred the chicken this time. :)

this recipe is awesome. i keep coming back to it again and again, especially in hot weather. sometimes i use smoked tofu instead of chicken. i bought light and dark soy sauce at an asian market. they taste different, and much better, than supermarket soy sauce.

I have already made this recipe twice at my husband's request. I omitted the soy nuts and added blanched Asian greens and served it as a main course. It had the right amount of spice for our taste (we like spicy food). Delicious!

This makes a refreshing dish that manages to be cool and hot at the same time. It would be especially good in the summer. I made it as written except I couldn't find Chinese black vinegar or soy nuts so I used apple cider vinegar and peanuts instead. The technique for poaching the chicken produced a tender, moist result, and I think I will use this method for poaching chicken from now on. We ate this with chopsticks, but it really ought to be served in small bowls that can be lifted to the face to make it easier to eat the long noodles.
