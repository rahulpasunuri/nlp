I have been making this tart since 1992 when it first appeared in Bon Appetit magazine. I make it every Thanksgiving, and it is always a favorite. My experience is that the recipe works whether you add the tablespoon of flour or not and you can adjust the ginger as desired. The tart is unique and delicious but simple at the same time. The "Mirabelle" in the name refers to the restaurant owned by the chef who created the recipe.

My husband is a ginger freak so I use extra ginger and I cheat and use pre-made refridgerated cust. This is a family favorite now, especially at Thanksgiving time.

According to the Bon Appetit November 1992 issue, there IS an ingredient missing. For the filling, it lists "1 tablespoon all purpose flour" right under the whipping cream amount.

First, there seems to be a mistake in the recipe for the filling. In the directions, it says to add the first 5 ingredients, then the nuts... there are only 4 ingredients listed before the nuts... from the way this filling turned out, I think there is something missing. Secondly, it wasn't very ginger-y. I would describe this as a nut tart, not a ginger tart. All in all, it tasted fine and looked fine, but I wouldn't make it again.

This tart just didn't live up to its promise. I may have overbaked it, hard to tell. But it turned out very sticky and hard, and the overall flavour was that of a somewhat bland, unexciting tart. It looked great, but that's just not enough.
