Like my fellow Bay Area reviewer, I only gave this 3 forks because I had to modify the recipe. Like her, I added onion, garlic, allspice, cinnamon, and salt to the meat (I had ground chicken on hand, so used that). I also added chopped fresh mint to the meat, but I next time I'd use cilantro instead. I had red peppers and zukes on hand, so I split them and filled them, with great results. No need to precook the peppers and zukes. I used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes, with juice, but next time I'd use maybe 20oz. I topped with fresh parmesan, but no butter. A hit with my husband -- tasted fresh and delicious.

I only gave this 3 forks because I had to modify the recipe. However, once I tweaked the recipe - AMAZING! Here's what I did: 1) Made zucchini boats out of a humungous zucchini from the garden, microwaved the 2 halves to speed cooking time. Browned 1/2 an onion, 1/2 head of garlic, 1/2 pound of lamb. Added to meat mixture: 1 tsp allspice, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp salt, finely chopped mint leaves from several sprigs from our garden. Used about 1/2 cup pe-cooked rice, plus 1 can diced organic tomatoes + juice. Stuffed all that into the zucchini boats, topped with parmesan and butter. Baked 400+ for 3o minutes or so. Glass of red wine. Yum!

As somebody who is married to an Egyptian, this is a good, traditional recipe. I'll give you some tips to make it easier, though. First off, corn oil is traditional in Egypt--but you can cook with olive oil or canola. No big deal. Same with using regular butter instead of ghee/semna. Coring zucchini is a pain, even if you have the special coring tool used so often to make mashi. Instead, slice the zucchini in half length-wise, and then hollow out each half with a spoon (make zucchini boats.) It's not traditional, but 1000x easier. If you'd like to still do the hollowed out bit, then cut your zucchini in half width wise--it will be much easier to hollow out. Instead of a pound of tomatoes (fresh), feel free to buy a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes at the store. We almost always add some chopped onion to the beef, as well as chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. You can also add a bit of mint as well. You can also add a pinch of allspice. Instead of tomato juice, I usually use tomato sauce. Hope this helps somebody. :)

OK, first of all, breaking my own rule about keeping it about the food, but to the reviewer "adult"(?) from Seatle, CA...if your really are an adult, critique like one, and you should work on your spelling, your grammar and your geography. As for the recipe, it was OK, but a great starting point for something better. I added sauteed onion, garlic, toasted pine nuts and a few Middle-Eastern spices. Will make again, and perhaps try this with lamb.

This was a wonderful summer meal for us ~ I did have a few changes that made the dish easier for me to prepare. I used only one larger sized zucchini and basically cut the recipe in half (except for the ground beef and used the full amount). I didn't need the corn oil to fry the beef so that was omitted, I didn't soak the zucchini as that really was not necessary, and for the tomatoes I used a can of diced tomatoes and reserved the juice in the can to serve as the tomato juice you pour over top. Right before baking, I topped the zucchini with dotted butter (instead of the ghee) and also topped ours with shredded mozzarella. This was a wonderful dish I plan on making time and time again.
