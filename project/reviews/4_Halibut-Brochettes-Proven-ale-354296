This was soooo good! And easy too. Served over white rice. Would probably be good with scallops or shrimp too.

Wonderful summer fare. I switched up the herbs a bit (added dill, skipped the fennel) and loved it. I also added some apple wood to the grill to add a little smoke. One of my new summer favorites. I paired it with an Oregon Pinot Gris.

This recipe is amazing! The marinade is spectacular. I used sea bass because fresh halibut was unavailable and it worked wonderfully. Although it goes without saying, use as many fresh herbs if possible for better flavor. I personally used fresh basil and rosemary. The finishing sauce is superb! Do not overlook it.

I'm making this for a third time tonight in the last 2 months. I picked up some amazing wild Alaskan halibut at the fish market and can't wait for dinner! This is very flavorful, healthy and filling. I have served this over quinoa, couscous, and tonight, over brown rice. Save some of the sauce/marinade to drizzle over the finished product, absolutely delicious.

Wow, I picked up some halibut over the weekend at the fish market and wasn't sure what to do with it so I found this recipe and decided, in spite of only the four reviews, to try it. I was blown away. I didn't have lavender blossoms and used dried herbs except for the rosemary which I had on hand. This was phenomenal. Served over rice and absolutely loved this meal. Very healthy, very light, and unbelievably delicious for its simplicity. I would have given 5 forks if I could.

We have made this a few times, each time wonderful. Our preference was to use halibut steaks cubed opposed to the more readily available filets skewered. Either way, don't pass on trying this this recipe.

Followed the recipe with what I had on hand which was everything sans the lavender blossoms. Threaded the fish on the skewers alternating with the vegetables and everything was finished to perfection!

Fantastic! Very easy and fast. I used grouper instead of halibut, but you could do this with any white fish. Fresh garden herbs are a must! Definitely a keeper.

I made this with several modifications and it was delicious. I did not have all of the fresh herbs but had basil, rosemary added dill and used the fennel seeds which really adds a nice flavor. For veg I just used different coloured peppers and red onion and put them on the skewer with the fish, which made it look great. The marinade I used for the veg was as directed but added a bit of blasmaic to give them a bit of different flavour to the fish. Finally, I used white vermouth instead of white wine and when I made the sauce, added a touch of chicken broth and cream just to increase the amount a bit. In the end, it was very good.
