Really tasty and easy to make. I used sherry instead of chicken stock and suspect this may have improved the dish even more. I also added a bit more zest than called for.

Easy and delish - a perfect side for fish. I like veggie or mushroom stock instead of chicken. A go-to for quick yummy leeks.

This is a great and simple recipe. The only thing I changed was the chicken broth to a dry white wine. From there you can branch off and substitute belgian endive for the leek.

This is an easy recipe to serve as a side dish to richer foods. I used olive oil and it was really yummy. I think that broth is unnecessary and I would omit it next time. But not a "wow" dish.

Delicious..... buttery, creamy and melts in your mouth. Perfect side for broiled sole or pan seared trout.

Never woulda thought a pile of braised leeks would go over with the 20 yr old crowd, but these disappeared on everyone's plate! I finished mine with a squeeze of lemon juice, but the boys ate theirs as is. OH, and I use homemade vegetable broth.

So easy and so delicious. I doubled the recipe for 3 people and there were no leftovers. I usually do leeks in the microwave...this is the go to recipe from now on.

Unbelievably good. So easy and fast. Will definitely be a keeper....

I've never tried leeks in my 41 years of living. I bought some to try out and found this recipe. Leeks will be on my menu often, I loved this exactly as the recipe was written.

I love this recipe. I made it exactly as written and it turned out very well. I used baby leeks and they tasted exceptionally: slightly sweet and a little galricy. I made it my staple.

I made this as a side for steaks with pizziola sauce. I added fresh thyme at the end and served with a mustard and shallot vinaigrette and also topped with sauteed asparagus. Even with additions, the recipe as is was very simple way to prepare leeks so they are really what you taset. I let the leeks braise around 10 minutes, think 20 as mentioned by other reviewers would have made the leeks too soft for me.

easy and excellent. I followed the directions using 3 fat leeks, quartered, and I left the lid on for about 7 minutes and they turned out perfect.

This was delicious. I was looking for something to make with left-over leeks in my fridge, and this was uninvolved and very good. I made it in about 10 min. tops, and I added lemon juice instead of zest to save time. I am definitely keeping this as a side dish recipe for future meals. It's was great with rib roast, and I could see serving it in lieu of carmelized onions alongside steak.

Fabulous ... hubby asked for seconds and was disappointed that they were all gone. I braised them for about 20 plus minutes. Just before taking off the stove, I added a big squeeze of lemon juice.

This was so simple-and I agree, it takes longer than 5 min.covered time. and I added a touch more broth. Served with pork tenderloin and roasted red potatoes. Great!

Not a big fan. I found it was too much onion to stand alone. Maybe it would have been better if I had cooked them for longer, like some reviewers suggested.

This was a hit--the braising really brings out the sweetness of the leeks. I made it according to the recipe, with chicken broth & lemon, and I think that both ingredients really added to the dish.

Rating: 3
I thought these were a wonderful and unusual vegetable side with a nice presentation. I only wish I paid more attention to the directions as I peeled off the tough outer layers of the leeks and they probably would have been perfect after 5-10 minutes, as opposed to the 20 minutes braising time I gave them after reading other reviewers suggestions. I will definitely make these again.

An elegant side. I substituted water for the chicken stock to good effect. Do not leave out the grated lemon zest. That touch gives the dish another layer of flavor and counteracts the sweetness of the butter and the leeks. It's just better that way.

leeks right out of my garden! m-m...instead of soaking just cut in half lenghtwise and rinse... cooked for 15 plus minutes, (no lemon )

this recipe was rich and buttery and tender. my husband who normally passes on leeks had seconds!i cut back on the butter to keep it more low fat. it was very easy tho the 5-minute-braising process took more like twenty minutes.

Great simple dish for casual to formal dinners. Make this one all the time!

I have been braising leeks in chicken stock for years, and IMHO they need at least 30 minutes to become meltingly tender and develop that distinctive deep "leeky" flavor. In five minutes they still just taste like another onion. I braise mine with stock in a buttered dish in a 350* oven for probably 45 minutes depending on size, covered with buttered wax paper and foil. I think it is a Julia Child recipe. (and very gently cleaning them under running water after slicing in half works better.)

Everything you'd want in a recipe - delicious, easy, healthy. I also added a small clove of garlic. This is now a "standard."

Very good; but next time I will add a little garlic to "kick it up"

The leeks were quite tasty. I added the crushed garlic. Next time I buy leeks, I will buy shallots, and try the dish prepared that way. I didn't find the cooking time to be much more than 5 min. It is important to use only the tenderest parts of the leek as stated in the recipe, otherwise it will be tough, no matter how long you braise it.

Found this recipe rather bland. Perhaps it was a bad crop of leeks.

I skipped the lemon since I was using it for a bed for Salmon. Don't short the washing process!

Very easy to make and very good. But it takes more than five minutes to cook this dish (try 15 or more).

Simple and delicious. I love leeks. I love the way they look on my kitchen table before I cook them. The lemon is a wonderful touch. All my guests enjoyed this, even ones who claimed they did not much care for leeks. This will be one of my new standard vegetable recipes.

This is delicious! I took a previous reviewers suggestion and added garlic and green onion to the recipe. Delicious, quick and simple!

This was a nice way to prepare leeks and so easy. The lemon zest added a very interesting taste. Definately a different twist. I am looking forward to making this again!

Very very tasty considering how easy this dish is to make. I also added a shallot, and I found that I needed to braize the leeks a bit longer than suggested.

I love leeks and this was a nice way to serve them. The leeks come out very soft and tender and the broth adds such a nice flavor. I have made this recipe at least 4 times.

A wonderful way to serve leeks - however for a slight diversion - add a tablespoon of crushed garlic and 3 small shallots. It enhances the lemon and provides a wonderful essence of lemon with garlic!
