This is a tasty soup! This time I used all red peppers and two carrots. Very refreshing. I will be eating this soup over and over again!

Easy and delicious, and good hot or cold. I've made this soup several times, and if you don't have the time/patience to roast the peppers, red ones from a jar are a decent substitute.

I like this as a summer soup - a little bland but I served it with a spoonful of guacamole in the middle. It gave a little more flavor and the colors looked awesome together.

Good soup, definitely needs the arugula to give it some zing.

We host a monthly soup night and in the summer I look for chilled soups. I am not a huge fan of chilled soups but decided to try this one. It was wonderful! There was not a drop left.

I make this soup regularly as a simple supper. I use the red peppers and we eat it either hot or cold and like it both ways.

I've been making this soup since the recipe first appeared. It's a fantastic soup to make in the summer, and guests have always enjoyed its delicate flavor. It's also visually appealing and is an ideal soup to serve with an Italian dinner.

yummy! I used red bell peppers, which had a nice full flavor. Very easy to make.

I make this soup regularily. I've used yellow bells only once because they were not as flavorful in this recipe as the reds. My husband loves this soup warm or cold and the rest of us prefer warm. I've used pinto beans, small white beans, great northern beans and cannelini. The white and cannelini are the mildest. Yum!

A wonderful break from summer's gazpacho...Added a bit of cumin and made a SMALL batch of RED bell pepper soup, swirled in the middle when served. Topped with sour cream and minced fresh basil. YUM.

The yellow peppers were overpowered by the beans. I think a little lemon or lime would help to give it a little more zip.
