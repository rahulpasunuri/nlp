Excellent sorbet! Threw in a few raspberries along with the strawberries. Well worth the extra time to put the mixture thru a sieve. Used Grand Marnier --- yummmmmy!!

Easy and delicious! I used Grand Marnier instead of Sambuca, as I didn't have any. Vodka would work well, too. The liquor really helps the sorbet freeze better. Any compatible flavor liqueur, rum, or tequila would work as well. I did sieve out the seeds, and it was worth the little bit of extra effort for the creamy texture. I churned it for about 25-30 minutes in a Krups countertop ice cream maker, and it froze up perfectly in the freezer after that. Nice recipe, and I'll make it again for sure.

My husband and I love Sambuca, so I was eager to try this, even though the Sambuca-strawberry pairing was counterintuitive to me. We both loved it, as did a guest who dropped by unexpectedly. I made it a couple weeks later for my foodie brother, and he and my mom loved it too! It's started me off on an exotic sorbet journey . . . made a kiwi sorbet tonight and am in search of more sorbet recipes at the moment. We will be having a patio party soon and I plan to make a few different types of sorbets. This will definitely be one of them.

I have made this twice already, substituting Grand Marnier for the Sambuca. It is delicious- not too sweet and very beautiful. Served in a martini glass with a dollop of light Cool Whip!

This is fantastic. It looks great, tastes great, and finally something I can make without using an ice cream maker. Will be great for the holidays, since I am planning to use red for my color this year.

I didn't have any Sambuca, so I left it out. The sorbet turned out wonderfully, even with frozen strawberries and had a beautiful dark red color and it wasn't too sweet. I skipped the sieving step, as the seeds don't bother me.

This recipe really yields a bright strawberry flavor. I made without the Sambuca, but I'm eager to try it with next time.

Wow, this was great. Used an orange liqueur, and it worked well.

Fantastic! I used tequila instead of sambuca, for that "strawberry margerita" taste... I had to use a little more than 3 tablespoons, but hey, who's counting! ;) I also didn't use the ice cream maker.. put the metal bowl it was in, inside a bigger metal bowl, and filled the space between with ice, then when it was decently creamy, froze it. Cheers!

I substituted Kirsch for the Sambuca and it tasted great. I did not use the ice cream maker, just froze it. I would definately make this again.

Refreshing, a perfect beautiful end to an rich summer meal, or elegant dinner. I love Sambuca, and don't think it's too strong at all, but if your on the fence with the flavor you could tone it down a bit. I strained the seeds out, love the smooth texture :) and the color is amazing - note - I did not use an ice cream maker - just froze it .

Good, and very easy, but one warning: You have to REALLY like the taste of sambuca (paregoric?) to add the recomended amount, two, or even one and a half tablespoons, should be plenty for most people - taste the mixture as you add the sambuca. Also, you can save time and effort, as well as add a nice texture to the sorbet, by simply adding the puree of strawberries (without forcing it through a sieve).
