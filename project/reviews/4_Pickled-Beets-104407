I didn't strain the marinade before I put it in the beets.

Great flavor! I followed recipe as it is written. This will be my go to recipe from now on for 'pickled beets'. For your interest,'Dr.Oz' on T.V. says that beets are one of the healthiest things people in general can eat, & they are especially good for 'womens' health.

I convinced my husband to try these with beets from our garden after using his mothers canning recipe for years. We used white vinegar instead of cider and processed them immediately in pint jars. A year later and it is still a treat to open up a jar. We will never go back!

This recipe is the BEST. I made this with the beets and also with hard boiled eggs for a family get together. Everyone was impressed. I am making them again to share with some co-workers.

These were good enough, but I like the Swedish Pickled Beets on this site better.

What a fantastic recipe. I just love this. I didn't cut back on the sugar like others because I like sweet foods, so I'd leave as is if you do, too. If not, then cut back. The brine is just so wonderful. I doubled the recipe, made some jars with just beets, and some with added whole hard boiled eggs and sliced red onion. Truly deliciousQ

Yes, A great always side dish. I backed off a bit of the sugar, added thinly sliced red onion to the chilled marinade and beet concoction,and served with lemon zest and parsley atop. A dollup of sour cream will take you to the Moon.

Yes, it takes a few days to make, but each step is very simple. Very good recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe for my first- ever harvest of home-grown beets. I think that if I do it again I will reduce the amount of sugar in this recipe. Beets are already sweet, and I am partial to the tart and dill flavors.

The beets were just perfect! The recipe called for 2 days, but we put the beets in the pickling marinade the first day and they were wonderful. We used them to make homemade pasta and they were perfect on the antipasto platter as well.

These are the best pickled beets I've ever had. I made this recipe as an addition to a catered event, of which most of the food was brought in from a bohemian restaurant, and 75% of the guests were my very Polish family...virtual pickled beet connoisseurs! Everyone raved about these beets and assumed they were part of the catering. I wouldn't change a thing, though I did cheat and use canned, sliced beets, which I would probably do again. This recipe is the new standard for pickled beets!!

It missed the last fork because the kids didn't eat it, but this dish made me go out and buy more beets!

Really good, easy recipe. I served these beets with goat cheese, and got rave reviews. The marinade is strong, but a nice conterpart to the dirt-taste of the beets. It's a kind of labor-intensive treat, but it is totally worth it if you like beets. Just don't let your guests spill them on your white carpet.

Wonderful, wonderful! Delicious! This is the only recipe I will use. Served these for an Oktoberfest-themed party, everyone loved them. If you like pickled beets, this is THE recipe.

This is a great recipe, shared the end product with the girls at work and they all wanted the recipe. I strained out the spices before chilling and thought it would be too strong if left overnight. Added hard boiled eggs and sliced onion, good suggestions.

So easy and good, it eliminates excuses not do it myself. My husband can't eat sugar, so I make it with honey instead and it's just as delicious, maybe even a little smoother.

I've made this recipe several times using fresh beets, either sliced or cubed. I add red onions, sliced diagonally, when combining the beets and marinade. We love it and it keeps very well in the fridge.

what if you have lots of beets, how would you use this recipe for canning?

I have made this twice, once with canned beets, recently with baked fresh beets. The baked version is much tastier. I followed the recipe except added more peppercorns and whole cloves. Also tried adding whole hard boiled eggs to the mixture....they come out purple and with pickled taste, Yum!

A KEEPER!!! Real easy to make. Next time I will add thin sliced Vidalia onions with the cooked beets. I also roast my beets now. (Better taste, less work!!) Improves with age in the refrigerator.
