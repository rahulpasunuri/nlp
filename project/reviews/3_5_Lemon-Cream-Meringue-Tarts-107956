Good taste. Meringue was sticky, maybe they need to bake longer. Filling was nice & tasty and combined well with the meringue. Lots of work, though.

This is a very complicated recipe! There are many steps involved, and it takes hours to prepare. We loved how it tasted, but the tarts were frisky, and crumbs ended up everywhere. Not recommended for a formal dinner, although it is kosher for Passover.

I was extremely happy with both flavor, presentation, and ease of preparation for this dish. For a little extra zing, I smoothed some lemon curd on the plate (also to keep it from sliding around) and dotted the top with mint sprigs and a few fresh raspberries. Made four small meringues for a dinner party. The recipe divides easily

I made this dessert for a dinner party and while the lemon curd was good and the meringues were good I thought the overall dessert was just okay. Definitely not fancy enough for a dinner party, maybe a kids birthday party.
