Had this for an after Thanksgiving dinner with close friends and it was a hit with everyone. I used cremini mushrooms which stayed nicely firm. The parsnips are a great addition and make this different from a run-of-the-mill pot pie. The biscuit topping was crisp and tasty, although I will add some cayenne next time.

Delicious! I used carrots, peas & brussel sprouts because that's what I had. I added some white wine to the veggies before the stock, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. The biscuits were to die for. A fantastic use of Thanksgiving leftovers.

Yep, it's the middle of summer and I bought a turkey, a turkey the size of a small child. Even with three teenaged boys in the house, I had leftovers. So what to do with those 20 plus leftover pounds of meat? Make this recipe! I happened to have some duck fat sitting around, so i sauteed the veggies in that (fat, how I love thee). I had already made the carcass into stock and just hadn't gotten around to the soup thing-lucky me, so I threw in about 4 and1/2 c. of that too (I had upped the veggies, and added potatoes). I do feel the parsnips were worth that quick trip to the market-they added great flavor to the dish, but I'd still absolutely add the 'taters too. I also added bay leaf and garlic to the broth, along with some other seasonings like more thyme, some parsley, poultry seasoning and some paprika. Bottom line is this is a great dish with some wiggle room to throw in hat you've got. Be sure to taste and correct your seasonings to your own taste. The extra broth worked out for me because I had upped everything else; the biscuits did suck up some of it. And they're easy and tasty even alone! A keeper!

This was a super tasty way to use leftover turkey. And gave it a new twist so that it didn't taste like leftovers.

I took some liberty with this recipe, but I ended up with the best pot pie I've ever had, so I thought I would write a review. Instead of turkey, I used the substantial leftovers of a (home-raised) goose that I had roasted a couple of nights before. So, I also used goose fat (instead of butter to cook the vegetables in) and goose broth. I omitted the carrots (didn't have any on hand), almost doubled the amount of peas, and used potatoes instead of parsnips. I'm quite sure that I added more than 4 cups of goose meat, and so it looked like I actually needed more sauce so I whipped up a little more gravy (goose fat, flour, goose broth) and added it into the mixture. Glad I did. The results were amazing. I will say that a little extra "gravy" when baking the pot pie is good, as the biscuits seemed to soak up a lot of the liquid. Also, I ended up with about twice the vegetable and meat filling that I needed for one deep dish skillet, and I had enough biscuit batter to bake an extra three biscuits. I froze the remainder of the filling, because I'm quite sure I'll be making this again, very soon. And again. And again... Summary: Very flavorful filling, perfect biscuits, adaptable recipe.

Made as directed, except used low sodium chicken broth vs homemade. While it was hearty, we felt it was bland. The biscuits way too much vs the filling - would reduce by half. This is a very heavy meal - appealing to those that are used to eating this type of meal vs protein and salad. Personally think there are more flavourful recipes for leftovers out there.

This was the best pot pie. Barefoot contessa has a good one, but this beats it! I put in 3 c. broth only. I added about three extra tablespoons flour to make it thicker. Would do this at the roux stage. I wouldn't add the extra 1/2 tsp salt with the veggies. The bouillon has enough flavor. I used 6 ramekins of different sizes. I only put in enough turkey into each serving that would be tasty. Tent the ramekins with foil as soon as they get a little brown, this makes beautiful brown biscuits. I used only mushrooms, carrots, turkey and onions. A keeper!

I made this dish for my husband, two grown sons, and their girlfriends - six people in all. We had 4 servings left over, so the recipe makes a generous amount. I used a potato instead of a parsnip since I did not have a parsnip, but it was still yummy. It was a lot of work to prepare. I would recommend this recipe highly as comfort food of the first order! It was a BIG hit all around.

This was delicious but not outstanding (compared to the Turkey Chowder I made at the same time and also on Epicurious). Made it pretty much exactly as written. The flavors were wonderful but I think I was caught up in the lack of a bottom crust? The biscuits were crazy good and who knew this Californian could make a biscuit at all? I would make it again but I am not going to be dreaming of this again like I will the Turkey Chowder.

A great way to use Thanksgiving leftovers. Somewhat time intensive but worth it. The biscuits are what make it as well as having mushrooms which are not the usual vegetable in pot pies.

Easy and delicious! I simmered the mixture until it was the consistency I wanted. I had no idea biscuits were so easy. I will definitely make this again. I expect it will become a winter staple. Yum!

This is the best use of Next Day Turkey I've tried! I subbed celeriac for the celery since I used what I had for the Thanksgiving meal and I added 3 medium red potatoes. I used just shy of 3 cups of the giblet stock I had made two days previously in my slow cooker and it was the perfect amount. The filling wasn't too liquid or too stiff. The biscuit topping, as many others have noted, is the real star of the dish. I used King Arthur White Whole Wheat flour (moved to this flour as my all-purpose years ago and never looked back) and they emerged flavorful and crisp, yet still on the lighter side. I think I used slightly more cheese since I eyeballed it rather than measured as I was grating - maybe an extra 1/4 cheddar and an extra 1/8 parm - but it worked wonderfully. I ended up with 9 spooned biscuits on top. Our family of 3 only ate 1/3rd of the dish so, for storage, I separated biscuits and filling and will marry them again in reheating. I'm glad I did so because they would have turned to mush sitting on top of the pie in the fridge. I'm glad to say that the biscuits are still crisp on top the next day. Overall, this recipe is a keeper! It's going into rotation this winter as it's satisfying, tasty, and a great use of left over roasts!

I made this with chicken breasts,and it was seriously one of the most divine meals I ever ate. The sauce was savoury and packed with flavor, the vegetables a perfect accompaniment to the crisp, buttery texture of the biscuit crust. My only cautionary note would be about salt, which is actually mentioned in the recipe as well. The second time I made this, I used a saltier chicken stock and it ruined the taste experience.

Rating: 3
I made this almost exactly as the recipe instructed; only changes were that I used chicken stock (high quality, from my butcher) because I didn't want to make my own stock, and I used cut green beans instead of peas. We loved it - the only 2 comments I have is that the filling was too watery for my taste, so I would use less stock next time, and, we added lots of salt and pepper and a bit of hot sauce, because otherwise I think it would have been too bland. I am not an experienced cook and it was fairly easy for me to make - just took a bit of time.

I have not made the turkey pot pie part of this recipe, but don't stop reading we love the biscuit. The cheddar biscuit is easy super delish and easy to whip up when you need one. My suggestions are to freeze your butter and grate the frozen butter into the flour mixture. Cutting butter in this way is the best. This is one of the best go to biscuits there is on this site. I will make some now for Thanksgiving. yum

Really delicious. And the boys loved it as well. I substitute the turkey with the Costco roasted chicken so used chiken broth for the stock and switched in potatoes as other suggested. Here's the great thing, I doubled the filling and froze half so the next time I just need to make the topping!!! Which was a much bigger hit than the puff pastry for a pot pie. Definitely a keeper

Really good. Used leftover stock, carrots and potatoes from Thanksgiving. Drained some of the liquid from filling before putting it in the oven.

Fantastic, not too labor intensive (but worth every minute of prep time), and always a big hit! I usually sub chicken breast for turkey and potatoes for parsnips, but both my husband and toddler practically lick their plates clean every time we have this dish. The biscuit crust is what makes the dish really stand out; it's a nice change from the usual potpie crust. Be careful not to use too much stock when mixing or the end result will be too runny.

The turkey part is very simple, and it tastes fine. The real star of this recipe is the scrumptious cheddar biscuit. Truly exceptional, flavorful, absolutely delicious and incredibly easy. I now make the cheddar biscuits separately, using only 1 c. buttermilk to stiffen them up a bit for baking separate from a potpie. Yummy. My husband can't stop eating them, and he's a skinny guy.

The filling is very flavorful. I would just advise that you season at each stage in the cooking to make sure to get the final result to your liking. Mine was not quite as thick as I like it to be, but it didn't hurt the flavor one bit. I did grate a bit of nutmeg into it, and used Julia Child's pate brisee for a buttery crust, as opposed to the cheddar biscuit crust, which I will make next time when I have a block of cheddar in the house...

My husband and I really liked this. Instead of a big pot pie, i made eight individual ones in ramekins, using each eighth of the biscuit dough per ramekin. They were perfect after only 20 mins in the oven. I also cheated by using a rotisserie chicken from Whole Foods and organic low-sodium chicken broth. Additionally, I used three small red potatoes instead of parsnip. I am freezing the other six in ramekin with the topping separate, so we'll see how they turn out later. The only thing i would change would be to add more broth, maybe 4 cups instead of 3/5.

Simple and delicious. Used leftover turkey, vegetable stock and potatoes instead of parsnips. I prepared the recipe as directed using canned stock, then split in half and added meat to only half for a vegetarian version. The biscuit topping is delicious per recipe. I might add more vegetables to make a more interesting veggie version, but this is a very satisfying meal as is. This is simple enough to make regularly.

This was my first pot pie attempt and it came out pretty good. My husband liked it. I used potatoes instead of the parsnip just because that's what I had. I started with 3 cups of stock and added 1/4 cup more to adjust for the consistency to my liking. The crust was easy enough to make but I don't think worth the effort. It was just OK. I think I am going to try store bought buttermilk biscuits next time. I will just cook the fillings longer to adjust for less time for the biscuits. Over all, good way to get rid off my left over turkey from Thanksgiving.

This turned out great and was really delicious. I used the recipe to use up some Thanksgiving leftovers so I have some changes: used chicken stock instead of the turkey, I had no parsnips so I used leftover mashed potatoes, I used broccoli and no peas and I had no buttermilk for the biscuits. I put the mashed potatoes in the bottom of the pan, covered with the filling and then the biscuit crust. Yum.

I found this last year searching for a recipe for all of the leftover turkey. It was an immediate hit with husband and friends. I have made it with chicken and turkey, but do like the turkey better. Excellent dish to take for a potluck. Husband asked if we would be making it again as soon as Thanksgiving was over.

I really only want to review the Cheddar Biscuit. I use it all the time with any pot pie I make. Also you can make them alone.

I was planning to make turkey pot pie tonight with puff pastry but I didn't have any left in the freezer. When I searched Epicurious and saw the 4 forks and reviews I thought the cheese biscuit topping was a perfect solution to my dilemma since I had both cheeses and buttermilk on hand. I was not disappointed; the biscuit topping was so quick and easy and most of all delicious. My husband loved it too. For the filling, I substituted 3/4 cup evaporated milk for the same amount of stock to give it a creamier consistency without all the fat of heavy cream. Used one medium potato instead of parsnip (didn't have). Otherwise, followed to a tee. It was a delicious meal!

Sooooo good! Turnips were new to me, and we loved them! Kind of carrot-ish but sweeter. I'll increase them next time. I reduced the butter in the filling and made the biscuit whole wheat, and it was fab!

I did not love this particular potpie recipe, likely because I didn't care for the combination of cheddar and parsnips. This was not a bad dish, but CI has a few variations on the skillet pot pie that I prefer. If I did make it again I would make it with regular biscuits instead (the parsnips add a lot to the filling so I would definitely not omit them).

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe and so did my husband who is very finicky, he even asked for seconds. I made it pretty much the same as the recipe except I didn't have fresh thyme so used dried. I think that the next time I will use a little less liquid as I found the sauce to be a little too runny. Also, I made the filling a day ahead and refrigerated it until I was ready to bake it. I should have reheated the filling before adding the biscuit as the filling was only just warm. The biscuit crust is to die for and I will use it for other things. Definitely a keeper.

Wow...I can only second what others have written. This takes comfort food to an exquisite new level, and I am not a big leftover turkey fan. I did omit the peas, since we don't like them, and used canned chicken broth--no matter, it was still an amazing dish. As other reviewers have said--do not omit the parsnip. I have never had one before--it adds so much to the dish, imparting a wonderful and different flavor from the average potpie.

this was terrific -- came out perfect and husband is already asking for it again. toddler gobbled it up. I had a lot of peas and a lot of turkey, so I put everything in a 9.5 x 13.5 inch pan, which meant that there wasn't too much biscuit topping but rather just the right amount. found the topping light and fluffy. we will DEFINITELY be making this again!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this recipe. I cooked a 13 lb turkey for two of people so it was a good way to use up the enormous amount of leftovers. We followed the recipe pretty closely making some minor adjustments for ingredients we were lacking (no parsnip; used dried thyme; substituted heavy cream with a touch of lemon juice for buttermilk). We didn't have any large casserole dishes so we baked it in the same pan we cooked the filling in. This had the additional benefit of dirtying fewer dishes. Unlike other reviewers I did not find the sauce/gravy to be too thin. Most of the stock was absorbed/evaporated after baking leaving the vegetables with a hearty coating. I actually prefer my pot pies to be "saucier" so when I reheated leftovers I added a small amount of water. That (in my opinion) made the consistency perfect! I imagine the surface area/volume ratio of the baking dish significantly affects how much the sauce thickens so that might be something to consider.

This is awesome. I followed the recipe exactly and it made a ton, so I split the filling, saving half to freeze for a quick dinner some other busy night. I'm not sure how it will freeze, but I guess I'll find out. Biscuits are amazing (after all, what can't be made better with sharp cheese and butter?). Perfect meal on a 20-degree December night.

Just perfect! Followed the recipe as written and don't think I would change a thing. What a great way to dispose of turkey day leftovers from the skin, bones and meat.

I think the recipe is easily adaptable, and I made it with what I had on hand, using shallots and potatoes in place of onion and parsnips (though I love parsnips and would try this again with them) Also had an open bottle of Sauvignon blanc and I sautéed the veggies in about a cup of it before adding the flour and broth. Biscuits were a hit and as I had too much dough to crowd them in my dutch oven, I baked the extra on the side.

With all the Thanksgiving leftovers we had, this recipe was perfect! I skipped the celery, peas and parsnips and replaced them with peeled+cubed potatoes and leftover green beans. I also used leftover gravy instead of straight stock. It turned out so well that it was suggested (seriously) I just make this for Thanksgiving next year :) Go me!

This is by far the most delicious comfort food I've ever made! The filling is so easy to change up - I didn't bother with the parsnip but added leek and more mushrooms. I made 2/3 of the cheddar biscuit dough and it was just the right amount (although you could bake extra biscuits on the side). Can't wait to make it again with my left over turkey at Christmas!

I loved this recipe. I had turkey frozen from thanksgiving and had made broth, so perfect. The only thing I did differently was add about 1/4 cup crumbled Saga Blue cheese to the biscuit recipe and omit the Parm. Gave it a nice cheesy flavor. Will definitely make again, because it is so flexible -- the filling can be anything you want really.

The picture in Gourmet made me want to make this dish, but when it came down to it, I realized that I'm just not a huge fan of potpie...and this recipe wasn't enough to win me over. I used rotisserie chicken from the grocery and chicken broth, which were fine, but I added less salt for this reason. Next go around I would have kept the salt as advised here. I also used edamame instead of peas, which held up well. I would have used more mushrooms, and a wider variety of mushrooms, too. I did not find the filling too runny - I let mine reduce down a little more given another reviewer's comments, but a little more sauce would have been nice. The topping is delicious - good enough to make on its own and pair with soup.

We loved this recipe! I was looking for a way to use ground turkey rather than leftovers so I used a can of turkey gravy instead of making my own. I needed a little more moisture so I added about a cup of chicken broth. I just used onions, carrots and peas as the vegetables. The cheesy biscuit topping is terrific! Just put it on the hot turkey/vegetable mixture like you would dumplings.

I thought this recipe was very good, and had a nice, rich turkey flavor, and received rave reviews from company. However, since I have never made a pot pie before I have no real basis for comparison. I also admit to some doctoring: I added one bunch of chard to the filling; I used chanterelles for the mushrooms; and I substited white wine for 1/2 cup of the chicken stock and reduced the total amount of liquid to 3 cups because it seemed thin. I also used a lot more salt and pepper than called for. In the future I might reduce the amount of crust, and cook the vegetables for a shorter period of time (they were a bit mushy for my taste).

I made this for dinner last night and we thought is was just okay. The filling was good and so was the topping. The topping was too thick and 'clumped' on the top, very much like the photo. It was too much and hard to eat. The top was nice and crunchy so I just took the soft underlayer off. I did not think the cheese flavor came through in the topping. I thought the filling could use more sauce.

I would have given it four forks for the biscuit topping alone! I did find the filling a little sweet with onions, carrots, and parsnips (full disclosure, I used homemade stock I had in the freezer that had already been made with mirepoix), so I adjusted with lemon juice, some red wine vinegar & a touch of tabasco -the added liquid totaling just about a tablespoon. I made it Thursday, a big one for my husband and me and a few small ones for friends. So far my friends want the recipe, and my husband already wants me to cook it again! I'm not a fan of re- heating in the microwave, but this re- heats like a dream. I'm sure this will be a go-to recipe for chilly winter nights to come!
