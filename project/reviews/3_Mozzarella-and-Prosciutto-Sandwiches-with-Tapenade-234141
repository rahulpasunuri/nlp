This sandwich is fantastic! It takes a bit of work to make at home but well worth it. I made it for a party and EVERYONE wanted the recipe! This recipe is from one of my favorite places in Columbus OH -- Cafe Corner -- at 3rd & Pennsylvania -- I always try to make it there when in Columbus -- they have an incredible menu of other great sandwiches -- all handmade with fresh ingredients. I wish I had all the recipes. Definitely a place not to miss!

I thought this was ok. Maybe I didn't have the best quality ingredients or maybe I've eaten too many olives lately. I think it would be better with aged/regular mozzarella. I don't know. I've made sandwiches with similar ingredients. Maybe I'll try again.

My husband and I loved it! It's the perfect summertime dinner. Pair it with a salad and crisp white wine and you're set. For us, pitting the olives took some time (we don't have a pitter) but it was definitely worth it. The tapenade is superb.
