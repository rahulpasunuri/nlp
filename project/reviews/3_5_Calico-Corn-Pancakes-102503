I make these every year for Thanksgiving - they are gone in a second! Very yummy

I lost this recipe and am thrilled to have found it again. I made it the day before Thanksgiving and it reheated well. This time I plan on adding more green onion and either eliminating or using less of the pimiento. The pimiento was totally lost in this recipe and the pancakes did lose a little flavor overnight. I think adding more green onions is just what it needs.

Enjoyed by young and old alike. It was a great prelude to Thanksgiving Dinner. I made them the day before and reheated on a flat grill before serving.
