Made this for my mother's birthday and it was a hit. She's not a big fan on anything too sugary and this recipe was perfect. Not too sweet, lighter than a cheesecake, and if you spend the extra money on the vanilla beans, it makes a big difference. Didn't change a thing, except that I made it into one big tarte. My graham cracker crust was falling apart a little, so next time I might add a little bit more butter or bake it longer. Other than that, it was a perfect treat!

This was absolutely fantastic. Per a reviewer's suggestion, I skipped the crust and added the cheesecake filling to decorative chocolate cups which I got from the bakery section of my supermarket and chilled them for the suggested 3 hours. The filling was surprisingly delicious, with such intense vanilla flavor which I added due to the Vanilla vodka I used. It turned out light and creamy like a mousse. I also doused the berries with the vanilla vodka and the result was heavenly. The best part is, it came together in a flash. This will be in my regular rotation from now on. Superb.

I have made this desert several times since it was published 10 years ago and always to rave reviews. You can skip the vanilla beans and add 1 extra tsp vanilla, but the pods do make it that much better. I like a raspberry/blueberry/blackberry combo best and top with a sprig of fresh mint!

Also made for our dinner group. The color of the berries are so vibrant,making for a beautiful presentation. Needless to say the flavors are to die for. We used fresh fruit rather than frozen. Watch the time with fresh, needs only 15 min. or so to fuse the vidka and sugar.

I decided to make this for my husband since he loves anything with vanilla bean, and we were both in heaven after just one bite. I loved the creaminess of it and the berries added that perfect touch. Definately a dessert I will make again and again.

Very good dessert! Did not change a thing except I followed others' advice and made a cake versus a tartlet.

Fantastic; served as tartlets at our "gourmet" dinner group and probably the favorite of the nite.

I changed a few things, I used 1/2 cream cheese and 1/2 soft tofu--could not tell the difference!! I made this in an 8 inch pie pan, did not have spring form. I also used frozen berries, they worked well; though a bit more liquid than fresh. This is a great dessert. The vodka is a nice subtle flavor.

Outstanding! This is so good, you'll dream about it.

This was great! Following the suggestion of another reviewer, I doubled the ingredients for the cheesecake portion. I used 1/2 regular cream cheese and 1/2 lowfat cream cheese & the filling came out wonderfully smooth and tasty. I also, used 6-tbsp more of the vodka (again I cheated & used Stolichnaya Vanil instead of putzing about with making my own). I also, decided against using vanilla bean in the filling, since the pods are pricey. Instead, I plopped in about 1-tsp of vanilla extract into the filling. If you decide to make this, definitely don't forget the berries & vodka flavoring. The berry/vodka compote will have people begging for another slice. Needless to say, I didn't have any leftovers & the springform pan was licked clean. Cheers!!

These are great! They also look beautiful. Will definately make them again.

I've made this recipe many times and everytime, every guest says it is the best cheesecake they have ever tasted. Instead of making individual cakes, I double the ingredients for the cheesecake portion and keep the same amount of ingredients for the crust and berry topping. If you haven't made this...do!

Timesaver: you can save a step on the berries by using vanilla vodka. (Stolichnaya Vanil is a favorite of ours.)

This is a great recipe. I have made it a few dozen times over the last few years and it's always popular. I make it in a full-size tart pan instead of individual tart pans (which works out great) but the filling can also be piped into miniature chocolate dessert cups to serve crowds. Also, for the berry sauce, just grab a bag of frozen mixed berries and heat them on the stove (you don't need to add anything).There was a point, actually, where my father-in-law wouldn't let me into the house without this cheesecake in hand. We ate it a lot that summer.

A great recipe that is easy and delicious. I made this for a pre-Christmas party and my guests loved it. The only change I made was to add a dollop of whipped cream for presentation. I will make it again for Christmas dinner!

Rich, but not too. This creamy, tangy dessert is my family's favorite. We sometimes do not add the fruit because the dessert can stand on its own. I have made it quite a few times and will make it quite a few more times in the future.

I've made a lot of cheesecakes in the past and the fact that these tartlets did not require baking led me to believe that they would not have 'authentic' cheesecake character. But they turned out very nicely. I have to say that if it wasn't for the vanilla-vodka berry topping, this dessert would not have been nearly as delicious. That berry mixture made all the difference. This is a simple, tasty dessert with lots of visual appeal.

This recipe is OUTSTANDING!! The cheesecake is absolutely dreamy, and the vodka-vanilla-berry mixture is pure heaven. It would be wonderful over pound cake or ice cream. Yum! Overall, this is one of the absolute best cheesecake desserts I have ever eaten and/or made. Be careful about the crust, though. It was probably my oven, but I baked it for the recommended time and it came out a bit crisper than I would have liked.

I made this dessert for Father's Day - it was excellent! It was not difficult and the flavor was fabulous. I used low-fat cream cheese. I will make this for company anytime.

This one never gets old! I've made this dessert for parties several times and it always gets rave reviews. I substituted brandy for the vodka.

This is one of the easiest gourmet desserts I've ever made. Very fresh, and you can change it by varying the types of fruit used. My only suggestion would be to make a different crust as a variation, by using crushed biscotti instead of the graham crackers.
