This was absolutely delicious, easpecially the dressing. I used large shrimp and roasted them, and used fennel instead of asparagus. My guests loved it.

When I made this last night, I divided all the ingredients in order to make a side salad for Hubby and myself. One-sixth of everything was good except that a few things needed to be decreased: 1/4 cup of mayo was enough, 4 oz. of asparagus was plenty, as was 2-1/2 oz. of shrimp. Also, I think that chopped green onion would be better in the dressing, but then I guess it couldn't be called "Chive Aioli"??? Anyway, it was a delicious side salad to accompany a burger, Will definitely make it again, as I made it this first time, except to use a little green onion!!! Enjoy.

Not very interesting...

I experiment with recipes, all the time, on my husband. The vast majority of the time, he really likes them, but his face puckered up and he would not eat it. He hated the dressing. I thought it was very average

This is a wonderful recipe for those very warm Tucson evenings. I used green onions instead of chives in the aioli and romaine lettuce in lieu of bibb. I also used large shrimp. I served it with a Catalan Tomato bread. This recipe is certainly a keeper!!

Wondeful light summer meal. The chive aioli would be wonderful on chicken and filet fish as well.

Glorious for a hot sunny day. Due to items on hand, I had to make a few changes. They were as follows: Bibb Lettuce- Substituted Mixed Greens (Continental) Bay Shrimp -Substituted 31-40 count shrimp Cherry Tomatoes- Substituted small tomatoes from my vegie garden (just picked and delish) Chopped Chives-Substituted red onion finely chopped. Very easy to make and beautiful presentation. I will be serving this salad at my restaurant for the next quarter.

Made this as part of our Easter lunch and it was wonderful. Had requests for the dressing recipe from two guests. My only advice is to make the dressing the day before serving. It was a bit too tart on the day I made it but the flavors had mellowed nicely the next day when it was served. I will definitely make this again!

Very tasty dressing that was used as a dip for the shrimp and asparagus while we were assembling the salads -- had to be careful not to use it up before the salads were ready. >>grin<< Variation on assembly is to put a bed of lettuce on a plate, radiate the asparagus spears outward from center like spokes, mix the shrimp into the dressing and place a dollop in the middle of the plate.

This salad is a winner- simple and delicious. I've also used fresh spinach instead of the Bibb, and it's just as delicious.

Made this twice now, and rave reviews both times. The dressing is a bit pungent for some palates, and can be replaced with a good oriental vinegrette. Will make again, and again!

My husband loves salads, and he didn't stop raving about this salad for at least 2 hours. The dressing makes it...it's very snappy. The salad is beautiful and would make a nice course for a dinner party, but it's easy enough to just make for a weeknight dinner.

Wonderful--served at dinner club & everyone raved. (Someone else made the dish but said it was one of the easiest recipes to do.) Have made it myself sense and definitely a delicious & sophisticated staple for us.

This was really great. I had some leftover sauce and the next day guests left the cocktail sauce and preferred this to dip their cold shrimp into. Even the children loved it.

A great and easy to make recipe. Used red wine vinegar and added a tablespoon of sugar to cut the tartness. I made it for a party and had requests for the recipe.

I made this salad for a May Day treat for work. It was fantastic! I looks beautiful and tastes great, plus it was so easy to throw together for a crowd. The dressing really made it a hit. I've been asked for the recipe by at least six of my co-workers!

This is excellent. Wonderful ingredients. We grilled the shrimp first and used Boston lettuce. I just made lettuce cups and layered the ingredients on them with the dressing. The dressing is wonderful

Perfect meal for friends down for the weekend at the beach. We had just picked up fresh Yakima asparagus, cherry grape tomatoes and then grilled the shrimp (with shells on and a dash of sesame oil). Great combo!

This was so good that my husband went back for seconds and then took the left-overs for lunch the next day. Thank you for sharing it.

I made this salad for Easter and everyone raved about it! The dressing was delicious and made more than enough to serve with the salad. I served the leftover dressing later in the week with a mesculun mix and loved that too!

This salad was delicious and easy to make. I cut the recipe in half, heated up some french bread, and it made a wonderful dinner.

I made this for guests the other night and they absolutely loved it. The bowl was truly scraped clean. Very, very easy to make. I combined butter lettuce with green leaf with good results (only because the store didn't have enough butter lettuce.) This recipe will be a staple in our house.

These ingredients are our favorite things, and this is a wonderful way of combining them. I suggest a nice peasant/rustic-style French bread on the side.

I made it recently and subed the mayo with light sour cream (California by birth) and added some cilantro. A nice Sonoma County wine and it was all good. p. s. I have also used some caper paste (from a handy tube) a dash of terragon and some hot pepper saue to rave reviews.

Fresh tasting, cool, delicious. The family loved it. It is a good do-ahead for summer eating.
