speedier version: use fully cooked pork breakfast links and heat them up while making glaze, then pour glaze over the links, stir to combine and voila - done in 10-12 minutes total prep/ cooking time!

This is one of my all-time favorite breakfast sides. Now that I think of it, I've even made this for a late night snack before. Always a winner. I've never actually used "sweet hot" mustard but that has never been a problem. Really tasty.

These sausages are one of my breakfast staples. They are flavorful, tangy, and addicting. Always a hit!

I make these every year for Xmas breakfast. I don't think you can beat them. Recipe is perfect as is.

Did not have sweet-hot mustard so used plain dijon and "hottened" it up with red pepper jelly that I had on hand. Used Jimmy Dean breakfast links. Simple to make. Served it to guests and everyone liked it. A definite keeper.

I made this for a crowd on Christmas morning, and there were mixed reviews. I thought they were great and so did some other folks, but the group was pretty much split down the middle. For the most part, the men didn't care for them as much as the women did; the guys said they liked their sausage to "taste like sausage, plain, simple and perfect."

My family loved this on Christmas Morning and it was so easy it was ridiculous! Definite keeper! What a great way to dress up ordinary sausage links!

I made this as a brunch side dish and it received rave reviews from some very discerning guests! It is so easy that I will permanently add it to my brunch recipe selection. The fresh rosemary is what makes it (along with great quality apricot preserves and chicken breakfast sausage links). Excellent!

This recipe is easy, quick and delicious! The flavors went wll with the curry potatoes and garlic eggplant I made alongside of it. My sister, who is an avid sausage fan, loved the meal. I substituted breakfast sausage for good old italian sweet sausage. Yum!

Used sweet dijon mustard as that is what I had on hand. They were great with the egg nog frenchtoast. Everyone loved them and I would make them again.

A great idea! I improvised with the technique - after cooking the sausages, I put some preserves in the hot pan until it softened and added a bit of Gulden's spicy mustard to blend, then added sausages to glaze. (Didn't have any rosemary on hand.) It added some delicious zip!

This recipe is a very easy way to make regular old breakfast sausages more fancy. Very nice flavor!

Yum! These are easy, delicious and perfect with the eggnog french toast with cranberry-apple compote for a festive Christmas breakfast. I'd cut the oil down to 1 tablespoon at most. The sausages produce some oil while cooking and need to be drained well before glazing. Everybody LOVED them!
