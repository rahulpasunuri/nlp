Using only sugar cubes to make jam is ridiculous. Doing so "because my momma said" is also ridiculous. Zooey Deschanel, provide us all with an actual reason why sugar cubes are better if one exists!

This is a great jelly recipe, I'm giving it only 3 stars because my mother makes it slightly differently and we all love it. My mom doesn't insist on sugar cubes, and adds the sugar from the start. Also, what gives jelly its gel-like consistency is pectin, found in many fruit and especially apples. So, when we're making strawberry (or any other fruit) jelly, we throw a few pieces of apple into the pot while it's cooking, and then discard them. Don't worry if the jelly seems runny at first, it solidifies in the fridge. It is absolutely delicious on fresh bread!!! Enjoy!

How is this possible to be one of the top "Healthy Foods" with 4 forks and it's reviewed ONCE by someone who's never made it? This site needs to track reviews better!
