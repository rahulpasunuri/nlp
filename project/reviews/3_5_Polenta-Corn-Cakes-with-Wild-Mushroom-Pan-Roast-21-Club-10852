Lovely comfort food. I rushed the polenta and probably used the wrong kind, the finer cornmeal but it still turned out wonderful for flavor.

I am rating the polenta recipe only, did not make the mushrooms. I used the polenta triangles under Peppercorn-crusted Muscovy Duck Breast with Blueberries recipe on this site. I sub'd Parm and ricotta cheese for blue cheese. The polenta was very good and very easy to make. Loved the roasted corn kernals in the recipe. Sliced, reheated and broiled perfectly. Will make again to serve with mushrooms!

I liked the falvor and especially the texture of this polenta with the added broiled corn kernals. I added 1 oz. freshly grated parmesan cheese to the corn meal along with 2 oz. danish blue. Instead of broiling the polenta triangles as instructed by the recipe, I rolled them in flour and fried them in a shallow pan of canola oil as I have many times in the past for a similar recipe. The polenta triangles were nice... a bit dense and dry, but good. I might add a little more liquid next time to make the polenta a little more moist and soft. (Note: I used polenta, meaning coarse corn meal, not the fine corn meal/flour some people incorrectly think of as polenta. This might affect the liquid ratio some reviewers have talked about.) My only complaint was with the mushrooms. The mushrooms and toasted nuts really did not add much to the the dish. It seems like it would be much better if accompanied by some kind of sauce, but I'm at a loss for what kind. Any suggestions?

Not a fan of the Roquefort cheese. It was a little "fermented" tasting. I think if I didn't use the cheese I would have liked it. I grilled fresh corn on the BBQ and gave it a smokey flavor, but the Roquefort ruined it. I may try it again and omit the cheese. I thought the liquid proportions were fine. After chilling it was a little mushy, but after broiling it was firm and crispy on top. It looked good!

The proportion of liquid to cornmeal is off for this treatment of polenta - reduce the liquid to 2-1 in order to get a thicker "stew" that will bear the slicing/roasting/broiling. Also, I added the roquefort crumbled on top of the mushrooms, rather than in the polenta, to keep the polenta from sticking (and it also makes the mixture more "liquidy" when you mix the cheese in). Finally, we're mushroom freaks, so I tripled those, added some white wine to the reduction and increased the shallots. Principles are good, here, though - served it at a dinner party and it worked very well. All enjoyed it.

I really loved this dish. I made the polenta with 2 small cans of chicken broth and a few dashes of cream ( if you do this, avoid salting the mushrooms). I forgot to mix in the cheese so I just sprinkled it on top before a put on the mushrooms. It was fabulous. I used shitakes and some button mushrooms for filler the second time I made it with no ill effect. Definitely use the fresh thyme and only at the end or it is too bitter. Served with lamb and fresh sauteed spinach, this was fantabulous.

Corn adds great texture to polenta with just the right amount of crunchiness. I must have added close to two cups of water while cooking to keep it from thickening too much. Will try it with chicken stock next time to see what happens with the flavors. Used fresh morels and the sauce was great. With shucking and roasting the corn it took about 40 minutes to make the polenta. I will roast the corn on my BBQ next time prior to the day I make the polenta to give it some smoke flavor.

Wonderful flavors! Served it on a bed of spring greens for added color. Easy to do bulk of work ahead of guests arrival.
