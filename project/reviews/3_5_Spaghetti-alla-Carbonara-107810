Amazing. Have always used half the pasta called for. Can use any pasta. I prefer some kind of short pasta like pipes or wheels. Silky and rich. So rich you might want to serve it as a side. Must use finely grated cheese (use a microplane) otherwise you get a gooey mess. The pepper seems like a lot but it's really good. Don't skimp on the Pecorino. Have always used bacon. Used a grassy sauvignon blanc from Australia, which goes beautifully. Also added red pepper flakes. Added lettuce and tomato after the eggs and cheese this time. I keep making it.

Had a craving for some comfort food and wanted to use up some leftover center cut bacon and an opened bottle of champagne from last night's New Year's Eve dinner. Substituted the smoked bacon for the guanciale and the champagne for the dry white wine. Result: the smoked bacon overwhelmed and the champagne was way too dry and gave it an acid bite, but it was surprisingly good anyway. I can only imagine how good this would taste if I used the unsmoked meat they recommended and some more user-friendly white wine.

Fantastic. I used this to show off some locally made guanciale, and it was fabulous. If you haven't experienced it, then you haven't lived! Now, this won't be crisp like pancetta unless it's shaved thin, but in this instance, I asked for more "Sunday bacon" style slices, and so it retained a softer mouth feel. I loved it as a difference, and the smokey taste was really something. I also used a nice white Bordeaux from Grave, and that was the final touch. It's a simple recipe, so it will really come down to the quality of your ingredients! Buon appetito...

meh... Spaghetti alla carbonara most emphatically does not have onions. Totally wrong. .... And, WRT the comment below by Kendall3 from Lake Keowee: The "real thing" as you put it does not have cream. The stuff American restaurants throw together to please their obese clientele may have cream, but the actual real thing never does. .... Having said that, I will add that pancetta and guanciale are infinitely preferable to bacon, but carbonara pasta with bacon is better than no carbonara pasta at all if all you have on hand is bacon.

Wow I screwed this up 6 ways to sunday and it was still fabulous. Made it trying to use up some bacon before it expired, so wrong kind of bacon and it was extra thick took forever to cook and the onions were ... OK they were black by the time the bacon was done. Accidentally dumped in too much spaghetti so there wasn't really enough sauce. I did have some fab parm cheese so that helped. The guys really loved it ("I can't believe Mom made bacon spaghetti!"). Dean and alan - thanks for sharing your stories!

Recipe was simple and delivered on the promise of some complex flavors with the rich cheeses and pancetta. I felt the onion was a bit overpowering and will lessen the amount, adding some fresh cloves of garlic next time. Overall the recipe yielded a "creamy" finish with the cheese and egg mix. I will definitely add to my favorites.

I would have to agree with C dean. I too first encountered this dish in Mama Liusa's tiny Neapolitan Kitchen near the port of Naples. I had it so often that the woman would make me cook it myself. This dish always brings me back to my navy days and the "hey joes" ( what the Italian street vendors would call us Navy guys) This is truly a crowd pleaser!

Rating: 4
The first time I had this dish was in Naples, It. like 83-84, I was in the Navy and Naples was always our first port in the Med. Me and some of my friends were walkin the streets looking for a place to eat when we came upon this little restaurant called Mama Luisa. This old Italian woman turned her front room and kitchen in to a restaurant and she lived upstairs. She wasnt a chef she was just a mother that could really cook. best memories are sitting and eating this dish and watching Dukes of Hazzard in Italian. it was her favorite show. Ever since then I have been looking for different twist on this recipe and this is by far the best. sry for the whole life story thing.

This was OK. I couldn't get pancetta or guanciale so used thick bacon. That may make the difference. The dish is healthier without cream, but not as good as the real thing.

Rating: 4
I substituted bacon for the guanciale and 5 cloves of garlic for the onion. I don't see any reason to temper the eggs - if you take the pasta off the heat before you add the (room temperature!) egg mixture and toss immediately, there shouldn't be any scrambling. Absolutely delicious - my fiance and I finished the whole batch.

Made this dish with spaghetti squash that I had leftover. It worked out great. I substituted salt pork for the guanciale (I drained a lot of the fat after the onions were browned). Left out the pecorino. It was really good. I'd definitely make it again.

Rating: 2
This yields a creamier consistency than that to which I am accustomed. One merit of this recipe is that it doesn't involve a mixing bowl. Therefore, cleaning is easy. The problem is that this version pales in comparison to Marcella Hazan's, which incorporates parsley and uses garlic instead of onion. I will continue to search for a version of this recipe which spares me the hassle of cleaning a large bowl.

Rating: 4
I followed the recipe almost exactly, but added about an extra half cup of grated cheese since that's what I ended up grating. I don't think this recipe would be as good without the guanciale, as it adds a distinct, slightly nutty flavor. My picky family loved it.

Have made this 3X -- so easy and really delicious! I love that this recipe uses no cream and achieves a "creamy" result. My 10-year-old especially loves it! To accomodate a child's palate, I addmittedly cut back on the pepper a bit, but otherwise, this recipe is truly a crowd pleaser as written.

Cooked it with Parmesan and Citterio pre-diced pancetta. Flavor was OK, but I will get guanciale or real Italian pancetta next time. Came out a little dry, but the flavor was nice. Dish depends on the quality of your cheese and meat.

This recipe is delicious. I make it any time I want something special that doesn't require a lot of fuss. I too modified the recipe slightly by putting a couple of pinches of red pepper flakes into the onion/bacon mixture, upped the wine a little to 1/3 cup and added fresh parsley to the egg mixture. Everyone in my family loves it!

This is one my stand-by recipes because everyone in the family, including the kids, like it. I always substitute bacon for the guanciale or pancetta, and simply use pre-grated bulk parmesan that I keep in the freezer. I also cook in a wok -- easier to toss at the end -- and let the onion/bacon mix caramelize in the wine. The flavor is good, and I always have the ingredients on-hand. Great for an impromptu dinner with friends, too.

For a while I was making this recipe on a weekly basis I loved it so much! The blend of the two cheeses really does it, but most of the time I just use the Parmigiano because I don't have Romano on hand. I also use bacon as a cheap substitute for pancetta and it comes out just as yummy.

My 7 year old son had a new friend around and his mother said that he was quite fussy and probably wouldn't eat anything for dinner. He said that he liked pasta with a cheesy sauce, so I got on to the Epicurious website and looked for a recipe for spaghetti carbonara as I thought he might like it. This was the first time I had tried spaghetti carbonara. My son's fussy friend asked for seconds and then thirds! I used chopped sliced deli ham as that was all I had in the fridge, and I only used half an onion as I thought the fussy eater might be turned off by too much onion. I was a little unsure with the measurements as I am used to using metric and didn't really have time to look up the conversions but guessed as well as I could. I also omitted the salt. All up it was tasty, light and really delicious. I'm looking forward to making it again!

This is the absolutely most delicious carbonara recipe I've ever found. It is rich, but not sickening like so many as it uses the whole egg but no cream. The onions and wine add another entire dimension to the flavor. I made the recipe exactly as written using pancetta (available at any good pork store) but using all parmigiano instead of a mix of cheeses (we find percorino too salty) and I omitted the added salt as well (not needed). My husband who is not a big carbonara fan said it was amazing, a definite keeper.

In an ingredient bind today, and this was just lunch for me, so I had to use sliced deli ham. Sauteed in OO with a bit of garlic and scallions (b4 adding the onions and wine), it was fine. Also threw in some peas. I don't always have very good luck making heat-sensitive dishes such as this (i.e., being very aware of the scrambling point for the eggs), especially if making for large parties. My work-around is cold-rinsing the pasta after draining, transferring back to the hot pot, and using my CLEAN hands to mix in the egg mixture, transferring back and forth, off and on the heat as necessary. It really allows me to precisely control the food temp and gauge it with my best instruments (hands), for a perfect sauce every time now.

Rating: 4
Delicious and simple! I added 2 cloves of garlic with the onions and some fresh parsley just before serving. In my zest to add as much parmiggiano reggiano as possible, the sauce was a bit dry. Will add an extra egg next time. Also, with the extra parm, I'll leave out the extra salt.

This carbonara recipe has become a staple for us. It's a great way to use leftover bacon from breakfast as a substitute. I like to use the Bargetto Pinot Grigio from the Traveling Vineyard in the dish and to pair with it. I also add a little nutmeg and some parsley. The nutmeg is a great addition. The parsley is mostly just garnish.

yummy! the perfect classic carbonara recipe, no cream, no butter, just the good stuff... pig fat, eggs and cheese. i also like using red wine sometimes instead of white. makes for an interesting combo. the comments on this recipe are pretty funny too. two things - 1) to ridgewood, nj: gourmet is probably required by law to include the little salmonella warning. just ignore it if you find it so bothersome... and 2) to los angeles... i'm pretty sure that spaghetti carbonara did not originate with la carbonara resto in campo de fiori in rome! it's a traditional roman recipe, supposedly having its origin as a coal miner's meal (hence "carbonara".)

Authentic. Simple. Divine. Follow the recipe exactly and leave your creativity for something else. Don't even think of using anything but the finest and freshest ingredients.

This was super delicious, quick and easy to make. My toddler loved it, too! Once I had smoked trout on hand and used that instead of pancetta (I included the skin and added a little olive oil, too). It was amazingly good--this recipe adapted well. I really liked that this recipe did not call for cream--carbonara is a creamy sauce because of the eggs and doesn't need dairy cream!

I loved this recipe because of the fact that it left out the butter and the cream. It was still nice and rich even with out it. I could only find smoked hog jowl but it was still good. I loved the caramelized onions and wine in the dish. I also used pasturized eggs due to one of my dinner guests having a heart condition but they worked well.

Good but not great. Doesn't compare to a carbonara prepared with butter and cream, and it shows in the taste. Better to splurge once in a while. Used a high quality peppered bacon, and rigatoni in place of noodles. Added in a few cloves of minced garlic into the onion mixture. Reserve some water in which you cooked the pasta to loosen the sauce as you like. Served with a simple salad of fresh baby greens from my garden, dressed with vinegar and oil.

Guanciale made a big difference. I made it a second time with pancetta the second time and it was significantly different. bacon vs. shaved ham, let's say. the guanciale imparts a slightly earthy taste and has a nice tooth to it. i also used a white wine with a little mineral quality to it, which complimented the dish nicely. i found the guanciale at an italian specialty foods shop. mangiamo!

Two mistakes: didn't use finely grated cheese (probably medium grated) and tried to reheat. Tasted ok when it was first cooked, but the egg or cheese seemed to leave what looked like little grains of sand in the pasta. When the pasta was microwaved, this turned out into almost a sandy texture, so don't try making this dish unless you intend to eat it immediately :-) I'll adjust my fork rating if I make it again.

For most healthy adults and non-pregnant women there really isn't an "egg problem". If one wants insurance, or has health problems, then use pasteurized eggs in dishes like this where the eggs are lightly cooked. They aren't that hard to find any more. Other than the whites being a little cloudy, there is no difference in the flavor or texture of the egg. Of course, if one is just squeamish about the whole "raw egg" thing, open a jar of tomato-based sauce instead of cooking this recipe, and if you ever watch "Rocky" remember to avert your eyes in the scene where he drinks a glass of raw eggs.

This is a good basic carbonara. I added asparagus, shrimp and mussels. Chicken and cored baby zucchini and yellow squash are nice additions too. To the cook worried about food poisoning: Between the heat of the pan and then the hot pasta, your eggs are cooked enough to be safe after a quick toss. The eggs will continue to cook on the way table, so there is more risk of overcooking than anything.

Tricky. If you dont cook the eggs thouroughly, you can get poisoned. If you cook the eggs thouroughly, like i did, you get a scrambled egg effect; ah - not the way its supposed to be and ah - not great?? I added peas... It was ok.

This was very good, next time I'll add more salt and another egg so it's a bit moister. It took a few minutes to grate the cheese that I recently brought back from Italy.

Tips: 4 persons -> 4 eggs (3 entire, 1 yolk). Use red wine instead - very unusual choice for cooking, possibly the same you're going to drink during the meal, it gives a better color and flavor. If you have bucatini instead of spaghetti, you're much closer to the original recipe.

Delicious - like we had in Milan - but we also added halved warm hardboiled egg on the side - by the way, of course eggs are porous. So call your local egg distributor and ask them about the last time they had salmonella detected in their eggs. Also, for fun, soak eggs in vinegar for a couple days - they get rubbery and fun to play with - no I'm not a kid, I just play one when unemployed.

Made this last night - absolutely wonderful. It reminded my husband and I spaghetti carbonara that we had in Rome -- no cream. I would highly recommend trying to find pancetta - bacon has a very different flavor since it is smoked and cured, while pancetta is simply cured. Finally, this was so quick to make. Like the recent "Macaroni with Blue Cheese" recipe, this is a bit too rich (and fattening) for regular meals, but for a special occasion dish I'd make it again. Bon Appetite!

This is actually 3 1/2 forks. It was fanatastic!!! My husband, who has travelled extensively through Italy, said it was better that what he had in Naples and that's a good enough review for me!

Our whole family, including three picky kids, loved this. I even added some frozen peas. Gotta get the veggies in where you can. Just a note: My 7th grade son's latest science project was using eggs and "bacteria". We put three eggs in three ziplock baggies with green food coloring. Within three hours, the egg had a green yolk. So, if salmonella is present on the outside, the shell is pourous enough to have a bacterial presence on the inside.

Rating: 0
Of course Salmonella can be inside the egg - otherwise the bleaching and washing process would kill all threat of salmonella. It's not just that the chickens poop on the eggs, but the poop that the hen ingests before laying the eggs can result in egg-borne salmonella. No, I'm not a Doctor, but I play one on TV.

Rating: 0
Sorry, Sutton, MA. Salmonella bacteria has, unfortunately, been found inside eggs and not just on the outside. I do agree, however, that the risk is very low. I have made this many times (usually using a couple cloves of minced garlic instead of the onion) and I have found that the hot pasta cooks the eggs. Not well done, but they are cooked.

This is very good...add more cheese...you can never have too much cheese. A NOTE ON SALMONELLA: Salmonella in raw eggs comes from the OUTSIDE of the shell. The reality is that birds poop on eggs and they become "contaminated" during processing. Use caution when cracking eggs and disposal of the shells. Wash you hands after adding eggs. This should bring your risk down to almost nothing. More importantly, in this recipe, the eggs will be "cooked" sufficiently by the pasta to kill salmonella. Lastly, ALWAYS check the "born on date" of your eggs, not the expiration date. By law, egg packages stamp the Julian date on the end. A Julian date is the day of the year (i.e., Jan. 1 is Day 1, Dec. 31 is Day 365). Look for the number like "121" near the date code. Just because your eggs haven't expired, doesn't mean they are anywhere near fresh.

I love carbonara, and will make this recipe, but please, Gourmet, don't use the weasel words "if there is a problem with salmonella in your area" ... there's a problem with salmonella in EVERY area. And if salmonella were selective, would you know if your area had a problem? Just tell us if tossing raw egg with hot pasta is a health problem! I think not -- when the amount of egg is that diffuse it is probably cooked pretty well ... so why the caution?

Sort of low fat? LOL. 2 oz of cheese, pancetta and 3 eggs is low fat? Yeah, I guess compared to eating spoonsful of lard straight out of the crock, it's low fat.

I like the fact that this recipe was sort of low fat. Next time I would add some garlic and less onions.

Been to Italy, come from an Italian family and loved it! I thought it was delicious. No snobby authentic comments here. In a completly heinous move, I had to use salt pork because my local market was out of pancetta. It was STILL good. Pleased that it had no cream in it. I do recommend free range or organic eggs though as the yolks are much more flavourful and that is a big part of this dish.

I used the ready crisp bacon from Costco. It was probably a bad idea.

This was a fast, delicious weeknight supper. I used good quality pancetta and cheese, and served it with a simple salad and baked fruit for dessert.

I have been looking for a good carbonara recipe for ages - strange that there is so many different recipes for such a simple dish. This is a great one - and the one I'm going to stick to. What works so well is the addition of wine and the absence of cream. I shouldn't eat it as I'm pregnant and our UK eggs can be a bit dodgy - but cravings must be obeyed!

This recipe was easy to make/good flavour and I would recommend it....but unfortunately my family did not care for it. They like "plain ol boring' spaghetti meat sauce!

This was a fabulous recipe. Of course, I couldn't make it exactly as written. I increased the cheese and used an extra egg to make it creamier. I also had to substitute bacon for the pancetta. For some reason, I couldn't find any pancetta anywhere. Oh well, it was still delicious. As with any Italian dish, the authentic cheeses are absolutely necesssary to the success of the dish. Serve with some freshly ground black pepper, add a salad and you've got a winner. Highly recommended!

This is a family favorite. It is the ultimate comfort food. I can't always get pancetta, but a good bacon works in a pinch. Serve with a huge green salad and more white wine. Fresh fruit for dessert. Make sure to use the best quality cheese you can get.
