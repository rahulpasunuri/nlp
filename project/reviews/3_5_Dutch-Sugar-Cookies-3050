Excellent and easy. Make this every year for the holidays but use lemon zest and lemon extract/or juice to liven them up. By far the most popular cookies for decorating (and eating).

I have been making these Christmas cookies for over 10 years. They are by far the most perfect cookie. I think the powdered sugar makes these cookies melt in your mouth. I usually make double batches a week ahead of time and refrigerate or freeze. Most Cut out cookies are very time consuming.Every year they get more perfected... my family always expects and looks forward to these cookies..you have to work very fast and make sure the dough is super cold. I usually decorate them with sprinkles instead of icing

we made theese for valentines day for friends and classmates. they were very sticky when you made the dough. when the cookies came out of the oven and cooled down we decided to try one. it had a VERY strong vanilla flavor.im not a fan of lots of vanilla. i think it would have been beter to add almond extract instead.overall they were pretty good, but i wouldn't make it again.

Excellent cookies. Easy to roll out, easy to prepare, and very tasty. Followed the recipe and the cookies turned out moist and delicious. Used royal icing to decorate.

This was a nice sugar cookie, I rolled it into a log to chill then cut 1/4 inch slices. Frosted each half of a cookie with cream cheese frosting & chocolate ganache for a black & white cookie look. They disappeared quickly!

I'd have to join the chorus saying the dough is a bit too sticky to work with, despite refrigerating half of it for an extra two days. I had to keep adding bits of flour in order to roll it out. That said, the extra flour didn't seem to affect the taste at all.

I was pretty satisfied with this recipe. I substituted some of the powdered sugar for brown sugar, and I also used maple extract instead of vanilla. I also added about a tsp of cinnamon, and I took the advice of some other people and only used 2 cups of flour. I made a vanilla glaze to put on top, and I think the cookies turned out pretty good.

My negative result on these cookies could have been my own fault, but they turned out hard and lacked any flavor. I made the exactly as the recipe called, my only problem could have been that I over mixed the dough.

This recipe was really easy to make and easy to work with. I rolled out the dough and cut out heart-shaped Valentine's cookies with my kids. We decorated them with colored sugar. The dough and the cookies are delicious!

Absolutely Amazing and the best sugar cookie version. I like intensity so i added signature ingredients(such as Grind Almonds, Ameretto instead of vanilla extract, or orange or lemon extract) to create different version BUT the base ingredients are already perfect.

Loved these cookies, only cooked them for about 11 minutes and they were nice and soft. Frosted them with a simple icing of confectioners sugar and milk. Scrumptions! First time I've ever made sugar cookies, and I'll keep using this recipe. The only thing was that I think I rolled them out too thin, they were pretty fragile afterwards.

Great cookies Tasty and easy to decorate.

While I'm sure these biscuits are loveley, they do not have much to do with being Dutch or with Saint Nicholas. I am Dutch and the statement that we eat these cookies at Saint Nicholas is either not true, based on a misunderstanding, or this partcicular tradition is so old that it is unknown to me. At 'Sinterklaas'(Saint Nicholas) we eat 'speculaas' (a spicy biscuit), 'pepernoten'(gingerbread cubes) and marzipan (shaped to resemble all sorts of things). I have never seen, or eaten these cookies at Sinterklaas, not even as a child.

These cookies are a winner! They were still soft 2 days later.

I used 1 tsp almond extract and 1 tsp vanilla, and made them bigger as another suggested, and these were great! Regarding the note left by Pixie in Indianapolis: "Busted?" Who are you -- the recipe police? When you change a recipe, ie add/omit ingredients, it becomes your own, and Betty Crocker was not the first nor only one to put powdered sugar in sugar cookies, so chill out! We all get our ideas from somewhere, and there isn't room for an annotated bibliography after every recipe. In addition, your suggestions were strange: "Instead of 1 t. vanilla, add 1 teaspoon plus half a teaspoon almond extract?" Okay, but isn't that known as 1 1/2 tsp almond extract? "Or increase to 1 tsp, like we do..." ??? If you're going to help, try to make sense.

This is it...the yummiest sugar cookie recipe I have found yet. Thick, buttery, toothy and so, so good. I prefer to roll them out 1/2 inch thick so they are a little crunchy around the edges and soft inside. Mmm. Note: this is a small recipe, so if you plan to make a lot of cookies, double it up.

Busted! This is an "adaptation" of the classic Betty Crocker sugar cookie we have been making for decades. The tip-off was the powdered sugar, a distinctive ingredient that made our Christmas cookies far surpass those made with regular sugar or, even sadder, the store-bought stuff. How can they not acknowledge their source? They added the word "Dutch" and the white chocolate, but other than that the ingredients and proportions are the same, with two exceptions that will turn this into a four-star knockout: Instead of salt, add one teasoon cream of tartar. Instead of 2 t. vanilla, add one teaspoon plus half a teaspoon almond extract (or increase that up to one teaspoon like we do -- yum!) We chill the dough and roll it out for cut-out cookies, although it is adaptable to other applications. We decorate with sugars and candies, but a family friend ices them and adds almond extract to her frosting as well for an extra kick :D

I made these for a group event this fall and placed candy corns in a circle and pressed them onto the top of each cookie. They turned out great.

Excellent sugar cookies, not too hard or crispy, they melt in your mouth. I didn't change the recipe at all

very yummy--i needed to chill it for closer to two hours, and i enjoyed them more when i didn't roll them so thin. i also used a chocolate frosting (confectioners sugar, melted semi-sweet chocolate and a little milk) and sprinkled almonds on top...

I prepared this recipe exactly the way written and experienced no problems. After my first batch (I was making 3) I did add white icing color for a more "white" finished cookie to aid in frosting with a pale pink for Valentine's Day. Yes, the batter did look sticky after mixing, but it firmed up nicely in the refrigerator. I did chill each of the three batters for about 2 hours. For frosting I made royal icing using drained cherry juice instead of extract and water. Turned a lovely shade of pink. I will add this recipe to the several sugar cookie recipes I have. It's a keeper.

I modified this alot, to get a cinnamon sugar cookie for my son's [toddler] Valentine's Day party. I used 2 cups flour as others have, used 1 cup confectioners sugar, 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar, 1 tsp good quality vanilla extract, 1 tsp almond extract, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cardamon, and 1/4 tsp salt [butter and egg the same]. I tried 2 different baking methds and the crispy ones were waaaaay better. Roll to 1/8th inch, and bake 9-10 min for a 1 inch heart cookie [my oven runs hot]. It comes out light brown, crunchy, light and crisp and not too sweet. Very tasty on it's own with enough flavor to hold any chocolate or icing or sugar; which I plan to try on them shortly.

Love this! Not too sweet, easy to make. I had zero problems, I skipped the white chocolate drizzle part - I only deal with REAL chocolate - and they were absolutely yummy. This is NOT your typical sweet sugar cookie, more for grown-ups and parents who don't want their kids chowing on pure sugar.

This is very funny, as I consider myself an experienced cook/baker. I made my dough several days ahead of baking. When my dough was done being made, I felt I had to add a substantial amount of extra flour because the finished product was almost gummy it was so sticky. So when it came time to roll it out and bake, I was worried that the dough was too dry (rightly so). I decided to go ahead and bake them and was suprised that the finished baked cookies were actually pretty good, considering my misteps. I was following the advice of another by cutting them 1/2 inch thick and baking for 8 minutes, but that proved too short a time for my oven (or maybe it had something to do with all that extra flour!). I had to bake mine from between 11 and 12 minutes for the same result as the LA cook on 6/19/02: baked, but not crispy or browned at all. My kids and I enjoyed them as is, without having applied any icing or extra sweetness. So I was unexpectedly suprised that they turned out as good as they did, and look forward to making another batch, with less flour, and see how good these really are supposed to be!

Great recipe for soft cookies if you bake for only 11 minutes, I did use a couple of tablespoons more sugar and frosted with a traditional buttercream frosting.

Great for using with cookie cutters. The dough took a little longer than an hour to chill; it was still too sticky after an hour, so I just put it back in the fridge for a while. I baked them for about 11 minutes, because I wanted them a little on the chewy side. Great, easy recipe!

The dough is great to use with cookie-cutters. Omit the chocolate topping and apply royal icing!

I love this recipe and make between 7 to 10 dozen every christmas! I've tweeked the recipe a bit but not by much. First of all, I use Lindt dark bittersweet chocolate; not white chocolate. I also keep the cookies at least 1/2" thick when I cut them with a round bisquit cutter. I then under bake them, 8 minutes total in the oven; they never turn light to golden brown--the color stays blond or white. After they cool, I frost them with the chocolate.

I took Sarah's from L.A. tip and she was right on the money. Good cookies.

These were delicious. BUT--they needed a bit of tweaking. The second time I made these, I used 2 cups of flour instead of 2 1/2 as the recipe calls for. This time the cookies were not as dry. Also--try almond extract instead of vanilla for a change! Either way, though, great cookies.

I must admit I was disappointed with the results. The cookies were indeed a little bland and for the lack of better terms: very very uninspiring. I had to compensate with copiuos amounts of frosting in order to convince my boyfriend and friends to eat them. And there was nothing chewy about these cookies. If you are looking for a sensational cookie - this is definitely not the one.

My husband brought home the standard sugar cookie dough from the grocery store--I refuse to use that yucky stuff. This recipe was quick, easy, and very good. They are light and not too sweet & very delicate if rolled thin.

After tweeking this recipe a bit, and just a bit, this is one of the greatest cookies to bake along with others for a Christmas basket of goodies! Kids love them as well as adults. I've been using this recipe since I first saw it in 1997 and everyone loves it! The secret: I don't let the cookies get brown; I let them cook just enough so that they are not all dough; but still look white when they come out of the oven and I use chocolate ganache for the frosting on the cookie instead of white chocolate which I've found most people don't care for; including myself! Tricks O' the Trade my friends!

I love this recipe and have been making it since it first appeared in the magazine. It is a light cookie that is not terribly sweet, which is why I think another reviewer found it flavorless. I lost my hard copy so I came on line to get another to use my halloween cookie cutter and sprinkles.

I have made this cookie dozens of times. I don't add chocolate, instead I frost and decorate them. I always receive compliments. These are great tasting even out of the freezer.
