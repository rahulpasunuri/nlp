Well, I'm only semi-qualified to write a review. A local company bottles a killer thai peanut wing sauce, and the reviews for this peanut sauce weren't glowing, so I used the aforementioned store-bought sauce, and made just the gai yang. Also crisp-baked the wings instead of grilling. But anyway. The gai yang sauce was very, very good. Tasted just like the only other gai yang sauce I've tasted, so that's.. good.

I found the Thai peanut sauce bland. I added three or four times the recommended curry paste, as well as grated ginger, fish sauce and additional lime juice.

I have been making this recipe for years. My family is not crazy about the peanut sauce but the gai yang sauce is exceptional.

This dish was under-whelming. The wings were OK, the peanut sauce was bland and the other sauce was just short of interesting. You could probably doctor this by adding more curry paste to the peanut sauce, etc. but I would rather have buffalo wings.

I LOVE this recipe! We've made it about a dozen or so times now - for parties & company & everyone is always so impressed. It has become our "show off" recipe now because people like it so much and are so impressed. I think the two sauces contrast & go together very well. Definitely make them both. I usually add more curry paste to the peanut sauce - & then can add more coconut milk if I over do it. I usually add more sugar to the gai-yang sauce and cook it quite a bit longer so that it thickens more. These sauces go well with all kinds of things besides chicken. I usually double the recipe & have the sauces leftover for a week or so and add them to just about everything I eat! I totally recomend serving it with cucumber salad as well - a great combination of flavors. Enjoy!

We ate this with the cucumber salad as suggested. The combination of flavours worked really well. To make it a little more filling, we served it with thin egg noodles and stirred the second sauce into it.

I used chicken tenders on skewers. I increased the red curry paste to 1 T. and the brown sugar to 1 t. The amount of coconut milk called for gave the texture I expected. The gai-yang sauce made a great contrast. I served this with toast triangles and everyone loved this dish!

Mfamily did not like the combination of wings with the sauces.

Made this recipe for a dinner club using chicken tenders (rather than wings) served on skewers. Everyone loved the crunchy peanut sauce which was initially quite thick. (I added a lot of extra coconut milk.) My favorite was the gai yang sauce. The tangy taste was very authentic. I would definately recommend making both sauces. The contrast is wonderful.
