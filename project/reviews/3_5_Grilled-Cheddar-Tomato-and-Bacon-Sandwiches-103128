WOW! I made these this morning for brunch and am quite impressed. I sprayed the grill pan with olive oil and it turned out beautifully. I can't wait to make it again!

My tomato turned out to be rotten so I had to leave it out. Very fast and tasty but not all that exciting.

mmmm, we loved it! I added some fresh chopped basil to the mayo, it iwas delicious!

Try using a 7 grain bread with a mix of colby jack and cheddar cheese followed by the bacon and tomato. A good grilled cheese also needs the accompaniment of a good pickle.

I made these sandwiches last night and they were very good--but the directions should have included to spray the pan. Mine stuck on the first side, I sprayed the pan when I flipped them and the second side browned beautifully. I did not use sour dough bread but rather a "farmhouse" style with a thick cut that my store offers. I will make these again.

This is a nice twist on comfort food - I use slices of cheddar to make the sandwich more manageable during assembly/cooking and substitute butter for the mayo.

My husband is from Sweden and is not a cheddar fan. I made this using the methods but substituted grated Munster, and used a hefty country white bread, otherwise followed it. It was fun to make, however I guess I got carried away with the mashing plate idea, and pulverized one of them. No one complained and my picky husband ate 2! I have made melted cheese before using almost the same method, but never with grated cheese in layers and never with mayonnaise always butter, this worked well.

Great comfort food!! I did have an edge here, though. I used blue-ribbon cheese purchased at our state fair (apologies to CA, but we really are still the cheese state, if not the dairy state!) Used an heirloom tomato from local farmer's market and "boutique" smoked bacon, I only bought enough slices for the sandwiches, it is expensive. I wanted to make the ordinary, special. Oh the exquisite delights of simple, good food!

I'm confused by the very mixed reviews. I served this in summer, and when all remarked it was the "best" grilled cheese they ever had I joked, "Well, yes it is in fact, since it is made with Cabot cheese's best-in-the-world rated cheddar." Make sure the tomatoes are the best.

Make sure to use a very firm type of bread because the bread that I used got very soggy. The bacon, cheddar and tomato tasted okay together, but overall, this recipe was disappointing. My favorite BLT recipe drizzles Ro-Tel dip (Velveeta and Ro-tel tomatoes) over the bacon while assembling the sandwich. The cheese dip adds a spicy zing to an otherwise classic and delicious BLT!

The combination of sour dough bread and the cheddar cheese was a sour tasting sandwich. Definatly not work the trouble. I am sticking with BLTs!

BLT MOVE OVER, HERE COMES BCT. A totally awesome combination of savory tasting elements that go together like peaches and cream.

I have been making grilled cheese sandwiches for years and never realized the secret to that crispy crust was mayo!!Thank you for forever changing the way I make grilled sandwiches.
