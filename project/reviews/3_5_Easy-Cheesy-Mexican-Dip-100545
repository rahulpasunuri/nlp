Here's the thing...people love this dip. And if you're in a hurry, it's so easy to throw together. Make it fancy if you wish, but, frankly, you don't need to.

Say whatever you want about the lack of sophistication of this dish, but the fact remains that it's delicious, easy and a crowd pleaser. Like the reviewer below, I freeze homemade chili specifically for this dish. That way you can control the heat and quality of ingredients.

My friends go nuts for this dip and I make it all the time. But I try to use homemade chili if possible (Every time I make chili, I freeze some for that purpose.) To give it needed kick, I add a lawyer of salsa between the chili and the cheese and use a mix of cheddar and pepper jack cheese.

It's easy and cheese, but nothing spectacular.

I needed a really fast and easy recipe for a neighborhood party and decided to make this. I used a can of chile with no beans, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. People ate it, but I thought it was kind of gross given the puddle of fat on top of the dish as the cheddar cheese cooled.

Rating: 3
It is a little bland, but still was gobbled up. Maybe it was the chili I used, hormel... Next time I will add some chopped onion to the chili or between the cream cheese and chili layer to add some interest. Guys love this dish! Also good substite for chili is salsa.

i call this my jersey dip. i've been making a version since i was 8 in south jersey, recipe courtesy of-- oh, one of those elementary school send in a recipe cookbooks?--with a layer of salsa instead of the chili. it's oh-so- so-so-so good. exactly the kind of delicious junk food that everyone loves to love.

I make this with chili with no beans, with a dash of mild type hot sauce added to it. I also add a can of chopped green chilies on top of the creamed cheese. FAMILY FAVORITE

This disappeared so fast. All the kids stood around the table eating the dip and ignoring the cookies and other snacks that were next to it. This recipe is just what I needed: fast, easy and yummy comfort food.

I spent the two hours making my own chili for the middle layer. I do not always have beans on hand so I made mine beanless. It turned out to be just right for a Church Pot Luck.

Sometimes you do not need 20 ingredients and 2 hours of preparation to make something that is a hit at a party! This dip is easy and delicious. No one could move away from it. I made it in a fancy pie plate to give it some flair.

Since when did pouring a can of anything over a slab of cheese become cooking. There are so many other wonderful recipes to make, why waste your time (even if it is only 5 minutes). Anyway, by the time you doctor this up, you could have truly made someting from scratch or less processed.

I have been making this for years, and it is always a hit at parties. I put sliced black olives, sliced green onions and chopped jalapeno peppers on top.

Made this exactly as directed. Can't understand why it received such rave reviews. I thought it was really BLAH!

This quick, delicious dish also tastes great with the addition of black beans instead of chili (great for vegetarians) and diced jalapenos on top to give it a little kick!

I have made this several times, and even my food-snob sister likes it. It's also good with leftover Cincinnati-style chili (the recipe is on Epicurious).

Yummy, salty, unhealthy, but always gets eaten! Fritos scoops are great with this.

Classy it isn't, but this is terribly tasty and super easy. Friends were all asking for the recipe as they lapped it up. I did use hot chili and Kraft cheddar/monterrey jack/jalapeno to spice it up and it was great.

This was GREAT! It tastes even better with alittle bit of seasoning salt sprinkled on top.. just a touch. I made this for my moms 95th b-day and the whole family beged me for the recipe. I can't wait till i make it again!

Easy appetizer that I have made many times to great reviews. I add a layer of salsa between the chili and the cheese layer. A little guacamole on top after coming out of the oven is a nice touch.

I first tasted this recipe when I was teaching - it was always a favorite on treat day in the teacher's lounge. I make it often for my husband and now grown sons - but our method is even easier. Put the cream cheese, chili and grated cheese into a microwaveable casserole. Microwave 1 minute - stir. Microwave another minute or so, until hot. I do add a few drops of Tabasco to give it a bit more zip. When I'm feeling like dressing it up, I'll garnish the top with a bit of chopped green onions or cilantro or sliced avocado. I think some of the reviewers confused this dip with the other classic Mexican dip - seven layer dip which is served cold. This dip is hot and gooey and best when served with Fritos. Not exactly gourmet fare, but yummy, quick and simple to make.

Stuck at home with three, yes count them, three starving boys, (according to my oldest who is 8), on a boring Sunday afternoon; I decided we needed a snack. Okay so they whined and complained enough that I decided to just fix them a snack instead of torturing myself with pleas from them for food!! I think I may have ruined their dinner, and mine. Oh well, so we'll eat late. I did find this to be an easy snack that they loved. THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Now I have three very happy and quiet boys sitting at my kitchen table stuffing their faces. Blessed peace at last.

This is absolutely delicious. I used turkey chilli instead of beef and 1/3 less fat cream cheese and it still tasted delicious. I didn't use all the cheese so it was quite easy to dip chips into. I made it for a small crowd just before dinner and it was rather filling, even though most of the dip was eaten, the actual dinner wasn't. So I would suggest you serve it well before a meal or with other appetizer type dishes. But I highly recommend this dip.

Great!! (I made it for the superbowl!It's perfect!!)

I'd recommend topping the dish with chopped green onions or onions. For some crunch, sprinkle with some Fritos or, at least, be sure to serve Fritos with the dip. Chili and Fritos are a good white trash combo.

First made this when living in NY, have now moved to Australia and wow the locals with it regularly. Don't change it, it is what it is, easy white trash dip no more no less. A true crowd pleaser.

This is an quick and yummy recipe but I found it a little bland. After spreading the chili onto the cream cheese, I spread a thin layer of medium salsa and some diced green chilies. Then to the top of the dip, I add some sliced black olives.

To make this recipe a repeater I changed it.....USE MONTEREY PEPPER JACK and include SPICY BEAN DIP as one of the layers.

Uh... yum. I know it's a big leap into white trash fare, but being only a generation away myself I only felt a small twinge of shame making and serving it to my Super Bowl party guests. They could have cared less and completely inhaled it! I added a good salsa, some black olives and a garnish of chopped cilantro-- either way, you won't be disappointed.

Made this for Super Bowl Sunday. It didn't please the discriminating masses. My recommendation would be to stick to one of your tried and true recipes.

Great recipe! It's not the prettiest thing you'll ever see, but it's easy and delicious. I made this for a party I hosted to watch the Canada-USA Olympic Women's Gold Medal Hockey Game and it received rave reviews (the dip and the game). Made it again 2 days later for another party for the Men's final (Canada and US again), but this time I added some chopped tomatoes and served guacamole on the side as suggested by other reviewers. It was even more fabulous. This is it for a simple dip for sporting events... (YAY CANADA!!!)

Easy and tasty and great for parties. I added pickled jalepenos on top of cheese and spicy chili to put a little heat in it and it was a hit.

Nothing great nothing bad about this recipe. Certainly easy enough, but only half got eaten at a superbowl party. If a dish like this won't get eaten at a superbowl party (GO PATRIOTS) when will it get eaten? Probably won't bother with this one again.

this ones a hit with all! I add a layer of salsa between the chili (i use no bean) and the cheese. easy and microwaveable!

Wonderful! Quick, Easy, cheap and delicious. What more do you want?!? I don't fool around with the recipe too much, other than using no bean chili and only jack cheese on the top. Make this dip--it will be gone in 10 minutes flat!

This recipe is a hit with everyone. I too have made it for the epicureans and the not so fussy and it's always the favorite. I have substituted refried beans for the chili, added a layer of salsa or tomatoes and served it with fresh guacamole. You absolutely cannot mess this one up!

I made this last minute for a friend's birthday party. When I showed up with it and revealed what it was, it was instantly dubbed "Trailer Trash Dip." I have to tell you though that even the epicurean snobs camped out around this dip and devoured it. This is a no brainer -- easy, cheap and delicious. A new staple for my parties.

I gave a large party and made many elegant party food recipes from this site that were all delicious. But what went in five minutes flat? This one. It's a snap and it' terrific. I used vegetarian chile, added a layer of fresh cilantro and sprinkled some crushed red pepper over the chile layer. Everyone loved it.

Rating: 4
The dip was great. I would use a wider pan - it makes it easier to get your chip thru all the layers. I also layered some guacomole on top after it came out of the oven as a finishing touch.

Rating: 4
This is the easiest, most delicious dip! It was a big hit at our Superbowl party. I jazzed it up by adding a chopped jalapeno pepper and green onions. Also, I added another half-block of cream cheese and melted it beforehand, mixing the chili in and then layering it on the bottom of the pan. Scrumptious!

Rating: 0
Be careful of increasing the basic recipe. I quadrupled it and must not have used a big enough pan... no one could get a chip through the top cheese layer. I would try again as a written without trying to increase the recipe before I tank it. When I mixed it up a little the guests did eat a little of it.

Made this for the superbowl - the perfect thing. Next time maybe I'll make it with just refried beans instead of the chili. I'd definitely add salsa next time too. Good, easy and perfect for a cold afternoon slouching on the couch.

My friend and I whipped this up for our girls-only Superbowl party, and we promptly inhaled most of it. We made it with low-fat chili and scooped it up warm with tortilla chips. So good!

So easy and so good! I think everyone loves this dip. I used vegetarian refried beans instead of chili and added a thin layer of salsa. I think next time I'd more salsa. Great last minute party snack.

I made this for an election night party - it took about 5 minutes to put together, and not much more than that for it to be devoured when it came out of the oven! I added a few other things - prepared guacamole, olives, etc. Really delicious.

Made the chili with beans version and also a version using salsa (Mexican style from a jar) added some sliced black olives before the cheese and it was gone in seconds. Got a call fifteen minutes before a baby shower and was aked to bring the dip. Put it together and arrived on time. It was a great hit once again with everyone asking for the recipe.

This recipe is wonderful. I have another version that is similar that I've made for years. It's Pizza Dip. You use the same cream cheese on the bottom, then layer with a jar of pizza sauce, add any pizza toppings you like, onions, green pepper (sauted) cooked sausage, pepperoni, green olives, etc. then sprinkle with parmesan and mozzarella, and bake or nuke. Serve with tortilla chips. It's fantastic too!

This is such a simple recipe -- and what a hit it was! You can serve it as is, or hype it up with some chopped olives and jalapenos. I made some fresh salsa on the side, and brought out a bowl of frito scoops. Was told that next time I should double the recipe!!!

This was very good. Everyone liked it. But, it needs a little more kick. I would suggest adding onion and green pepper, or maybe even some chilies. Will definitely make again. Football season is coming!!

Who can complain about a delicious, simple dish that everyone loves. I've been making this dish for parties or for when I have those unexpected guests. It is always a big hit. The guy from San Francisco needs to realize that you don't have to be a snob to be an epicure.

Rating: 4
This was great!!! Can someone confirm my one problem which was the cheddar was too solid to scoop through - should I use the Monterey Jack? San Fran must never have bothered to try. I used home-made chili and I think it was gourmet and my family standards are high. Give it a try.

I thought this was pretty tasty. The guy from San Fran shouldn't have even bothered with his review. Looking at the recipe, you know it's not "gourmet," so why did he even bother?

Rating: 3
I agree - the San Francisco reviewer needs to get a grip; something tasty doesn't necessarily require a lengthy recipe or prep time. I used pepper-jack cheese, and hot chili, and my dip-loving family adored it! Definitely a make-again recipe!

Rating: 3
This is a great recipe which I've been making for some time now. For a little extra zing, try using hot chili with beans and pouring a thin layer of medium or hot chunky salsa before topping with cheese. And, by the way, Monterey Jack cheese definitely works great with this recipe because it remains soft and easy to dip even after it's been out of the oven for a while.

Awesome! Will make this ahead of time and take camping this July. Used Fritos Scoops and some of our homemade chili. We will be making this often next winter. Simple is almost always best. Thanks Lexi!

The cook from San Francisco obviously doesn't know how to have any fun! I chuckled when I saw the recipe and thought I'd make it for a tequila tasting party I attended. I hollowed out a Boudin's sourdough loaf and filled it with the easy mix. It was a big hit! I got asked for the recipe and then I really had to laugh! I referred everyone to my favorite Epicurious website!!!

We call this 'Death by Dip' and everyone loves it! I make it with a can of chopped green chilies layered between the hormel no-bean chili and slices of monterey jack cheese. Can be microwaved for 13-15 minutes and stirred all together. Great served with warm tortilla chips!
