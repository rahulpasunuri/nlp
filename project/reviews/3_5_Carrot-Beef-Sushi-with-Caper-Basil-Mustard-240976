I've made this several times to rave reviews. Haven't had the problems the other reviewers have mentioned.

I can understand the other cooks' distress. I have made this for a party and everyone loved them but they are a lot of work. You must find the largest carrots, try a farmers market. Slice them on a mandolin, steam and shock them. I used thick slices of medium rare NY Sirloin roast and cut the pieces into long square rods. They are definitely better if finished rolls are wrapped tightly in plastic and refrigerated for a day before cutting. Use a very sharp knife and slice through the plastic then remove it after slicing the portions.

What a nightmare! I went through about a dozen carrots trying to get a good strip using a mandoline. They did not hold together even after some time in the freezer and then hours in the fridge. When I cut them into "sushi" slices, all the carrots fell off. I had a tremendous mess in the kitchen and a tremendous mess on the appetizer plate. The steak was great, the sauce was great and the carrots were....carrots. My advice is cut the steak into small servings, put on crostini with a dab of the sauce on top. It will look great and your guests will be able to pick it up and eat it without the whole thing falling apart in their hand.

Im actually using this recipe for a dinner party this sunday. Ive made these several times, and the first time i had no access to a steak (i was at work and costs would not like that) soo instead i used meatballs. It actually turned out really well. Im also using a very mild Dijon Mustard and it complements everything very nicely. My only suggestion to anyone who tryes to make these is to try to find Horse carrots (they are pretty big at least an inch and a half wide or soo.) they make a world of a diffrence when it comes to rolling and staing together. Also, i found it easier to use a meat slicer for the carrots but i know many of you dont have access to them. But overall i love this recipie and im sure i will pull it out again!

The carrots were impossible to work with - I also used a mandolin to cut them, and after boiling them they seemed pliable enough to work with, however the ice bath immediately firmed them back up and my rolls fell apart pretty easily - my guests loved them, however.

As everyone says here, put the roll wrapped in plastic wrap (or any tight wraping) overnight to help keep shape. I have done sushi before and the easy part of sushi is everything is sticky (short grain rice, nori [seaweed]). The carrots are not sticky and don't hold well. This looks like a fantastic starter. Unless you can find gigantic genetically altered carrots (bigger= easier to wrap) and an easier way to form this this isn't the best recipe. I will say the sauce is good with steak. I used a mandolin for the carrots. I used regular mustard and not grain. hope this helps everyone.

Making this, I imagined a staff of Gourmet test cooks and interns laughing, saying to themselves as they went to print -- who's the moron who's going to attempt this. Granted, if I had sushi making skills it might be different, but as I was battling the darn carrot strips, trying to get them to roll over, as the oily dressing oozed out of the sushi mat and got, well, everywhere ... well let's just say 1 1/4 hours doesn't begin to cover the time involved here. However. An overnight rest tightly packed in plastic wrap did seem to help it hold together, and even though the carrot didn't hold tightly, it still sliced well and looked gorgeous. And the beef cooked perfectly following the directions. One thing I'd do differently next time is to puree the sauce. I feel like the texture, even merely the grains of the mustard, kept the carrot from adhering rather than helping. And it did overpower the beef a bit. A simpler sauce could have also worked I think. This recipe was nervewracking and time consuming. But will I make it again? The oohs and ahs might just have made it worth it.

kind of difficult to cut carrots thin enough, roll, and cut neatly. that being said it wasn't impossible and it was very tasty with a nice presentation. i would definitely recommend making them a day early and wrapping them in plastic wrap overnight, i think that really helped hold them together when I sliced them.
