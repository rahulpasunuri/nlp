These are the best oatbran muffins! The recipe was very accurate and clear. There was ample batter to make each of the twelve muffins large size. I think these will be good to freeze and have on hand for the future.I will make them again.

Easy & tasty. The muffins were a bit heavy but still good. I used whole wheat flour and was generous with the raisins.

I substituted dried cranberries for raisins.These are good and quite healthy... the problem is that they "taste healthy", you know what I mean? Just good, not amazing.

Substituted mixed berries for raisins; added nutmeg. Quite nice, quite light as well.

Very good muffins! I didn't have buttermilk or oat bran, so for the buttermilk I substituted with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice combined with just enough milk to make 1 cup. For the oat bran I used regular Quaker Oats Old-Fashioned Oats. They tasted a bit dry but satisfying otherwise.

These are delicious. They're even better if you add a little rosemary to them. It provides a welcome aromatic flavor.

I normally hate it when people review a recipe with a million changes in it, yet here I am doing just that... I chose this recipe as a base for carrot ginger muffins. In a way, I followed this recipe, except that I used canola oil instead of butter, 1 cup of whole wheat instead of one of the cups of AP flour, and rolled oats instead of oat bran. Also, to make them carroty I added 3 carrots, shredded, and 1/2 cup of walnuts. I thought they turned out very good, but of course, my recipe has little to do with the recipe as written.

Very easy and tasty. Made some changes. Used whole wheat pastry flour, added 3 tbsp. flaxmeal, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, 1/4 tsp. cloves and 1/2 c. toasted walnuts. Used only 1/2 c. golden raisins. Used Smart Balance instead of butter(cut back on salt by 1/2 tsp.) Baked 18 minutes. Will make again.

I made a few changes: used half whole wheat pastry flour, have agave nectar for honey, and carrots and dried cherries in place of the golden raisins. My 6 year old ate two straight away so they passed the test. One note: the recipe says it yields 12 so I doubled it to feed my son's class. I ended up with close to 40 muffins and my muffin tins are 1/2 cup. In short, I think the recipe yields more...

This recipe seemed a little dry for my taste, then I reduced the amount of flour to 1 cup and it turned out delicious and with good texture.

These were ok, but nothing special. I subbed oil for the butter and they turned out fine.

Oh, these were yummy! I actually didn't have oat bran (whoops!) so I used 1/4 cup whole oats, 1/4 cup wheat germ and 1/4 cup semolina, trying to mimic oat bran's texture (though not its nutritional profile) based on my previous experience. Turned out great! I used about 1/2 cup sultanas and 1/2 cup whole flaxseed to add some more healthy kick. Try some (pastry or regular) whole wheat flour if you want extra toothiness. Thanks for the recipe, we will use it again!

These are not high in fat content. 1/2 stick of butter = 4 tablespoons. Dividing 4 tablespoons between 12 muffins results in each mufffin containing 1/3 of one tablespoon of butter. A tablespoon of butter has 102 calories, so the butter contributes 34 calories per muffin. You could further reduce the fat by omitting the egg yolks and using 4 egg whites instead of 2 whole eggs. Buttermilk is very low in fat, so all in all, these are pretty good in terms of fat content. Add some grated carrot and grated apple, and the nutrition and texture will improve, say 3-4 tablespoons of each. Another suggestion is 1/3 - 1/2 cup of pineapple bits instead of the carrots and apples.

The fat content per muffin is only 1/3 of a tablespoon of butter. 1 Tbl of butter has 102 calories, so each muffin only has 34 calories of fat. These are actually quite low fat on a per-muffin basis.

We might need more fiber, but I dont think we need more fat. This recipe sounds healthy, but overall, it isn't. I would love to see the nutritional value per muffin. (Especially the ones the dude made using a jumbo muffin pan!) I really dislike having to tweak more than one ingredient in muffin recipes, just to make them healthier. And if I am going to eat something I know I will feel guilty about eating, it ain't going to be a Bran Muffin that's for sure.

Great recipe! After reading a few of the reviews concerning the lack of texture, I decided to add 1/4 cup each of oats and flaxseed meal and two tablespoons of flaxseeds in place of some of the flour in the recipe. About 1/2 cup more of milk was added to loosen up the batter a little. I also added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract. The batter was just enough to fill a jumbo six cup muffin pan. I will definitely make these muffins again.

Instead of butter use Smart Balance. I use it in all of my baking and it works very well. I have not yet made this recipe and when I do I will use whole wheat pastry flour and Smart Balance. Also, will add toasted walnuts along with the raisins to add more texture and freshly grated nutmeg to boost flavour.

Oh, dear, I read the recipe too fast and USED one stick of salted butter, but they turned out fantastic. I added a whole teaspoon of cinnamon and some clove spice too. Yummy.

I used white whole wheat flour, subbed all butter for applesauce and added cinnamon. it needed more flavor for sure. Obviously since I subbed the butter for applesauce it was more dense...but warmed it was good. Begs for a cup of coffee with it...it

I'd like to try this recipe but want it to be 'healthier'. It's the butter!! Does anyone think oil (canola??) could be substituted successfully?

1/2 stick butter is 2oz/57g.

Half a stick of butter is 4 tbsp, or 1/4 cup.

Sounds like a great recipe except - how much is 1/2 stick unsalted butter. I buy butter by the pound or half pound not by 'sticks'. I hope you will revise this recipe and re-post it so I can try it out.

In response to dberwick from Cambridge, MA. Maybe some finely grated carrot would give them the needed texture. I haven't tried then yet myself. I'll report back when I do.

Two forks, but for how quick and easy it was; this is a totally serviceable muffin. The criticism is that I'd welcome a little more heartiness. I'll make it again for sure, and the next time around see what I can add to make it more of a mouthfull and less of a mouth-roof-gluer, which conveys more negativity than I intend, but is nevertheless accurate.
