How is this recipe from Bon Apetit? It asks for pre made meatballs, which I thought was the point of a Pasta and Meatballs recipe. Not to mention the sauce calls for 2 14.5 oz of diced tomatoes with Balsamic vinegar & olive oil. Are you supposed to buy that pre packaged from the grocery store? Because it doesn't tell you the amount of Vinegar or oil? If you're buying the meatballs, the pasta, and half the sauce, why do I need a recipe? I can just grab a couple of cans of stuff and throw them together myself. Why do i need to look it up on Epicurious OR Bon Apetit?

This is TASTY. Considering the amount of time invested in it. Hats off to the author! I could not find diced tomatoes with basil and balsamic. I used canned whole tomatoes (all I could find) with basil. I added 2 Tbls spoons of Balsamic vinegar. I also added a 1.5 Tsp of Italian seasoning, 1 Tsp of fresh ground pepper & 1 Tsp of kosher salt. On another note; given all the criticisms about the "shortcomings " why all the noise? No meatball recipe; college dorm simplicity, blah, blah - such fuss buckets. People, good meatballs are an undertaking of themselves not a dish you take on when a quick meal is needed. The simplicity of this recipe is what makes it especially good. There is elegance in simplicity. There is no elegance in a bucket of fuss.

This is a great middle of the week, "need to throw something together quick and don't want it to be pizza" dinner. Used whole wheat spaghetti for a nice change. The fresh basil was wonderful. However, my family did say that while they liked it they prefer my own homemade spaghetti sauce recipe. This is a good recipe for people who want something simple and quick or for those just learning how to cook.

I recieved an e-mail this morning from Epicurious Recipe Flash with the header; "Savor an Italian feast with these recipes from the latest issues of Bon Appetit and Gourmet" Hilarious!! This so called "recipe" is so lame it's actually funny. Here's to the closet comedian at Epicurious. As the great chef Julia Child once said, "Save the liver....." or was that a Saturday Night Live skit? Live From New York!! Well, you get the picture. Thanks Epicurious, I needed a good laugh this morning.

Very flavorfull! I used homemade meatballs, and to my dismay I didn't have any basil (not even dried) so I substituted with a tsp of oregano. Still great - but would definetly be better with fresh basil. I'm using the left overs for meatball hero's tonight.

What EVER would Epicurious do with out all the free, unsolicited "advice" on how to run their website and magazines? I'm known amongst friends for being a pretty decent cook, I LIKED THIS RECIPE, and I recommend this website and these magazines to friends who want to learn technique and ingredients. Does an occasional simple, tasty little recipe like this deserve so much wrath? Come on people, look at the state of the world today (REALITY CHECK) and know this is just not as earth shattering as some would have you think. Added a pinch of sugar to the recipe and would recommend the same for a few who perhaps have a tad too much time on their hands... KIMBER

There are a lot of snobs here...This is a reasonably good recipe for what little time and effort is required for it. It's a very quick, simple dinner. If you want to make your own meatballs and a more complicated sauce, more power to you. But that doesn't mean it's ok to judge and look down on people who are looking for a fast meal. This recipe isn't an insult to all "decent" chefs (I find all chefs who said that was the case indecent, actually). It's simply a recipe. That's all. And mothers, students, and everyone else who lead busy lives and enjoy the simplicity of convenience foods should not be encouraged to leave this site. They've got just as much of a right to be here as the finest gourmet chefs. I don't like to use processed foods from cans and boxes if I can avoid it, myself. And personally, I love spending hours in the kitchen cooking and conjuring up delectable dishes, but not everyone does, and to be fair, I found that this is a handy dinner when you're short on time. I pride myself on being an excellent chef, and I think no less of myself or my abilities for trying this. ~Zer0

I have been looking at Epicurious for new cooking ideas for over a year now am increasingly disappointed at the snobbery of some of the posters, particularly as they assume that everyone comes from the US, and in this case has an Italian American heritage. You may not consider this a recipe because it is similar to what you have always eaten, but for me it is a relatively new concept...I have had meatballs and spaghetti once in 32 years..and no we are not all boring or unsophisticated in New Zealand! Having said that, I will be making my meatballs from scratch as I haven't seen any premade ones here :-)

I totally agree with the last comments from the Cook on 12/12. I, too, used to look at the Epicurious website almost every day. I love to cook and it was such a great resource of recipes and helpful - often funny - advice. Over the past year or so, it has changed completely. Originally, it was unusual to come across a rude, silly or mean-spirited post. Now one has to scroll through many of these in order to find some useful, well-intended comment. I shall be looking out for other recipes sites now and won't be coming back to Epicurious any time soon.

I used to love Epicurious so much. Not only did it have the best recipes, the comments were almost always helpful and useful. So I made many, many recipes published in this site, by following the advice of my fellow epicurians. How sadly have the times changed! I have nothing against a sense of humour. I actually think it's completely necessary. But must EVERY SINGLE RECIPE turn into this? People, Epicurious has forums. If you want "witty" banter, go there. The review section is for REVIEWS of the recipe, not all these wannabe funnies. The point is, I used to come to constant comment every day and be awed by the knowledge and kindness of the posters. Now, I'm mostly bored. How many more jokes about salt water, sea water, guests raving, ready made versus from scratch shall we endure? The reviews space was such a good idea, gone to such a waste.PS to the Tribeca cook: do you even know what a hypocrite is? Because it is not "well meaning".

Snowy West Chester, you have it all RIGHT. That's what cooking is all about to me...having the creativity and confidence to improvise with what you have on hand. I do love to spend a time researching a recipe, shopping for it, serving to friends and family, but above all, I love to cook. And it takes a lot of practice and patience. This is ultimately why we are all here, right? Let's see this for what it is.

This is a deliciously easy dish to prepare, especially after a hard day at work. If you love the taste of fine wine like I do, do yourself a favor by adding a splash more, like 3 cups or even the whole jug if you have it. The brand I reccomend is "Carlos Rossi," which can be obtained at most wine shops and mini-marts. Don't forget to get a loaf of crusty french bread to soak up all the sauce!

Ever delighted to find a bargain, my SO spotted Mama Luca frozen meatballs on sale at the supermarket and brought them home. Last night, with nothing to eat in the house except the 75 cans of soup he also found on sale, I decided to give them a whirl. I heated them in beef broth till the broth reduced a little, added paprika, nutmeg, dill and sour cream. Served them over buttered egg noodles and he said, "Honey, it's good."

I have a chronic illness that can be incapacitating at times. This is a great recipe for those times. I need ti watch for the sodium and sugar in the ready made stuff, but it sure beats take out fast food and order in pizza. And our old friend salted water needs to be used. Add a slug of red wine to the sauce too while simmering. When I feel good I cook, when I don't I doctor up some ready made products. restaurants seem to rely on it all the time. I am sure all those people cancelling their subscriptions don't make their filo, puff pastry, etc. I am sure they buy bread. Life is too short to be offended by a recipe. Meals are meant to be a celebretion. Enjoy your lives. SYSCO supplies most restaurants with premade meals such as beef wellington and chicken cordon bleu. soups are frozen in bags and reheated in boiling water. crepes are frozen.

I very much appreciate Epicurious giving us these "short cut" recipes. While I love to cook, I also work full-time. It is a priority for our family to sit down for dinner together every night. And making meatballs from scratch after a full day's work is unrealistic. So Thank you, Epicurious, for the wide variety of recipes. I hope to see more of them.

Well, you should at least TRY the sauce because it is good. You don't have to add meatballs, store-bought or otherwise. Just make the sauce. Hunts is the brand they are refering to with the balsamic vinegar, etc. By the time you add the onions, garlic, wine, basil etc. it tastes quite good.

I actually saw pre-made meatballs at Sam's the other night and almost BOUGHT them. What is this world coming to? I made the second comment on here saying that this recipe was lame. I still think that way, although I'm not going to kill anyone over it. I just think they should have recipes that are more *challenging*. That's all I meant by my comment, really. Honestly. Happy cooking all!

Ah, but it IS a recipe. It's a recipe for sauce. You can add whatever kind of meatballs you like. Incidentally, frozen convenience foods are usually expensive and not as good, but they're hardly equivalent to the boxed garbage some people have been comparing them to. I actually just used ground beef, rounded into miniature patties. No filler, and almost as fast as pre-frozen. (You realize, of course, that we've been discussing value systems, not meatballs.)

Ummm, even here in Tulsa, some of us use good quality parmesan, freshly grated, instead of kraft out of a jar, because IT'S NOT EVEN THE SAME THING. Convenience foods are all well and good, especially after a long day at work - even my "from scratch" mom insists I should be using pasta sauce from a jar. But at the same time, I would never dream of purchasing pre-made meatballs, because they're nasty. Might as well get the can of Spaghettios with meatballs. But to save time, I always make a double or quadruple recipe when I make meatballs, and we have homemade frozen meatballs for months to come, even if unexpected company comes by.

Those of you who think you don't feel like cooking a "gourmet" meal after working 70+ hours a week, try being a cook at a 4-star restaurant, then coming home to cook a meal for yourself. Frozen pizzas & McDonald's look awfully good. The point is, almost everyone eats convenience foods sometimes, even those capable of producing fine food in a very short time(well, not my mother). However, one doesn't need a cooking magazine to tell you how to throw together a box of this and a can of that. And meatballs, of all things, should be made at home. I much prefer the salted boiling water recipe. At least that was from scratch.

Please, believe me, as a pregnant full-time working mom, I have NOTHING against quick weekday meals, but this recipe should never have been published in Epicurious. And anyone who is criticizing the food snobs who posted is seriously missing their point--this isn't a recipe. Why not buy the store bought meatballs, mix with jarred spaghetti sauce and call it a day? That is basically what this is--it is NOT a recipe. Epicurious usually does a much better job of offering us something quick, easy, unique, and delicious. IE, loved the pasta and cannellini bean recipe with pesto--also from the quick weeknight dinner and just as simple. As for store bought meatballs, if you like them, fine, enjoy. Personally, as the daughter of Italian immigrants, a meatball is like a hug--warm and full of love and affection. I could never buy them pre-made at my supermarket. HOWEVER, that is not my real issue--my real problem is that this is not a recipe, and you can slam me all you want.

For Tulsa and others: That's great if you prefer to take short-cuts where you can get them. Everyone does- whether it's Kraft cheese or a bag of stuffing. Personally, I was raised in an extremely health-conscious family; and since then I prefer freshly grated Parmesan cheese (also at Costco) and meats that are not bought pre-marinated. Also re: magazine recipes with complicated ingredients and steps, I see that as a challenge and an opportunity to grasp cooking techniques. I am one of those people who take cook to learn and to relax. That is how I grew up-in the kitchen at my parents' side while they cooked, etc. You have to hand it Epicurious, for bringing in such diversity of opinions.

Loved this recipe, would make it again and don't understand all the hubbub. Personally, I have never understood why all the food magazines have recipes that are needlessly complicated when there are so many ready-made ingredients out there! I always have purchased meatballs, pre-made burgers, boxes of precooked bacon, oven to table ready made rolls, etc on hand just in case company is coming. And I love the Costco boxes of pre made appetizers and mini quiches!! These are really great when company shows up unannounced! I have a made a number of recipes on this site and I just adjust them to make it easier. Bread crumbs? Pepperidge Farm all the way! Cheddar Cheese? Loves those Kraft slices! Fresh Parmesan? Why bother when I can just shake it from a big can of pre-grated I keep in the fridge! Seriously, life is way to short to spend all your time in the kitchen. Get out there and live a little!

I've been doing all kinds of "gourmet" dinners for weeks now, and I wanted a break - and needed a quick dinner. (I also had a half-package of, dare I say it - frozen, store-bought meatballs in the freezer!). This recipe was really excellent! I just added balsamic vinegar and olive oil to the canned tomatoes, and used some great leftover Shiraz. Served it with linguini, and made sure to use parmesean Reggiano. This would also be very good with chicken, or even without meat at all, as a vegetarian main. TO COOK FROM CANADA - President's Choice and Janes are national brands in Canada that make frozen meatballs. Otherwise - make a big batch of walnut-sized meatballs, freeze them on a cookie sheet, and when solidly frozen, pack in Ziplock bags in the freezer.

Last night I got off work late and I was dead tired. So I stopped by the supermarket and picked up a box of dehydrated scalloped potatos (horrors!). I went home and cooked them, adding some feta, basil, garlic and peas, and ate a nice romaine salad with it while drinking non-designer water (heathen!). During dinner I read a mystery novel (gasp! Not Shakespeare!?) and I enjoyed myself *thoroughly*. Eating well is the best revenge :P

The rest goes: It rolled in the garden, and under a bush, and then my poor meatball, was nothing but mush. The mush was as tasty, as tasty could be, and early next summer, it grew to a tree. The tree was all covered with beautiful moss, it grew great big meatballs and tomato sauce. So if you eat spaghetti, all covered with cheese, hold on to your meatball, and don't ever sneeze! Great song!

The discussion about this recipe is ludicrous. As I recall, it appeared in a section in BA called everyday cooking, not Pull Out All the Stops for Company Cooking. IN other words, it was designed to be quick, easy, and satisfying. I used meatballs from Trader Joes and they were actually very good. I understand you can get excellent ones at Costco as well. The tomatoes with balsamic just seemed silly to me. i have no objection to using tinned tomatoes in winter, but I'm not going to go searching for flavored varieties. I just wish these recipes relied less on gimmicky convenience foods that you have to search for. Otherwise, this is a fine recipe. The people who object to it are.... I don't know. Men, perhaps? People who don't have to cook for a family? People with no jobs? If Gourmet and Bon App were filled with recipes like this, then I would cancel my subs too. But they aren't! And neither is Epicurious!

I'm quite amused by all the arrogant comments. Let me fill you in on a little secret - they sell bottled tomato sauce in Italy and, guess what, it sells AND they also sell premade meatballs. Remember, they invented Barilla instant lasagna or do you purists roll out your own and let's not forget Parmalat - milk that you can store for long periods of time. Shall I go on? Even there, a quick "instant" dinner is a godsend after working all day. If you want your own homemade meatballs make extra and freeze them and make extra tomato sauce and freeze that as well. By the way, I love to cook and would rather make things from scratch but, hey, sometimes you just gotta go with the flow and convenience.

I have to chime in here, as I'm not a food snobbie at all and agree with the bought'n meatball critics. I would expect to see this recipe in say, my BHG newsletter or on the Kraft site, but not here. I come here for 'do it yourself' home-cooking stuff. 1. You don't even need a recipe for this type of meal. Buy the ingredients and throw them together. Duh. Ain't that difficult. Certainly didn't need to be WRITTEN down on paper anywhere. 2. Sure, this is a good weeknight meal. Lord knows I don't have enough time or energy to make coq au vin every night, but honestly, I'd rather just brown some hamburger, throw in some Classico and serve over spaghetti. Don't need a recipe for that either. I think the people you are calling 'food snobs' (which I have to agree there ARE some), are simply saying that this recipe might be better served printed on the back of the Barilla box, ya know? Anyway, I'm just tickled it's replaced the 'Boiling Salted Water' recipe in the number 1 spot.

I made this recipe as indicated - following the instructions exactly. (Well, not exactly, because did have to add Balsamic to the tomato sauce.) I've also made essentially the same dish before seeing this recipe and used not only frozen meatballs, but also pasta sauce from a jar! Can you imagine??! Both were quite fine for a quick, weeknight meal, which is exactly what this type of recipe is to used to produce. In fact, it is from Bon Appetit's Every Night Cooking section which features, you guessed it, Fast Weekday Dinners - Simple Main Courses for Monday through Friday.

To the cook from Ann Arbor - Obviously you missed my point. Meatballs are something that are not only made with ingredients, they are made with love.

But the pro- and anti-convenience food discussions shouldn't degenerate into name-calling.

Surely there are enough recipes on this website to suit everyone's time, talent and tastes. End of rant--I do have a practical question about this recipe. I don't believe I've ever seen canned tomato sauce with balsamic vinegar anywhere. Can anyone recommend a good brand?

If I bother to write anything about it would be that if Epicurious persist in shocking my email box with idiotic recipes of this caliber, I will consider its recipes flashes junk mail and treat it accordingly. This ain't nothing but a basic recipe for tomato sauce. The accoutremments are barely worth mentioning.

Not every recipe need be complicated or overdone. There are many cooks(myself included) who can appreciate a simple and quick recipe. If you are looking for a challenge, find antoher ercipe. I am getting sick and tired of the pretentious reviewers on this site. You are ruining the enjoyment.

Oops - I have to agree with many others who wrote in - it would have been nice if at least the sauce was a little more involved than "open a can, add some red wine!" A recipe need not have 80 steps, but if I wanted an open-your-cupboard/freezer-dinner-on-the-table-in-20-minutes recipe, I'd go to familycircle.com!

This is a great recipe for the kids (or Dad who doesn't cook)to surprise Mom with! Easy & tasty... Mine used the Italian turkey meatballs...

A nice recipe! Italian food is defined by simplicity cooked to perfection. If you use the right combinations and quality, it can be a master dish! A few suggetions: - Make the meatballs yourself, there are many fine ones noted here. - Use pecorinno in stead of parmasan. works better in dish - A fruity red wine will fitt better, making sweeted flavours enrich the whole. - Use some dried bassicicum as well - Add a few diced black olives to finnish - if u have the time, make the pasta yourself.. quite a job, mind u... Indeed relax people, especially the delusional master chefs her who have nothing valuable to contribute.

C'mon, this isn't really a "recipe" at all -- it is more like a list of instructions for someone with an IQ of 50 to slap together a bunch of ingredients and call it cooking. Epicurious is one step away from printing a recipe like "Pasta with Spring Vegetables": 1) Cook up a packet of ramen. 2) Add some chopped carrots. If a recipe touts itself as containing "balsamic tomato sauce," I expect more than to see something like, "Buy some tomato sauce with balsamic vinegar already contained in it." (Which, for the record, I have NEVER seen in any supermarket I've shopped at.) Epicurious, this "recipe" is an insult to your readers' intelligence.

Now,now kids, be nice or I will open a can of Chef Boyardi! I'm a scratch chef by nature, but, this recipe sounds pretty good, I recently went to a party and was served Trader Joes meat balls, they were fab, will try them with this sauce when I am short on time.

I look forward every week to my Epicurious newsletter, I love to cook and I certanly don't go the extra mile of buying a magazzine of gourmet food to give me recipes of frozen food, I can read those on the back label.

Ok folks, I have to chime in. Being a single guy it is nice to have a simply prepared and filling pasta dish on those cool autumn nights at the end of a busy work day. I have found many prepackaged items to be quite satisfactory. A nice bottle o' Cab and some cool jazz and this recipe works out fine. Homemade meatballs are great but I really do not have the time during the week to go into the ordeal of preparing them. I will save that for that special evening with friends.

I have subscribed to Gourmet since medical school 20 years ago. Sometimes I humbly think I am a gourmet cook after studying cooking for 25 years. This whole dialog has been really funny and a source of laughter. Face it there are times when you stuff in your face what is easy then you have a dinner out for two that is in excess of $200.00. Lucky to be an Ameican.

I find it strangely heartening to read all the passionate comments on this recipe. It's good to know that in our messed-up world so many people can get worked up over prepackaged-vs.-homemade meatballs! I'm not being sarcastic. To me, it's a hopeful sign for civilization. Long live Foodies.

Sorry guys, after reading the remarks, I have to comment. Using short cuts or packaged food, is not a crime. If you have the time and want to relax, great, if not, take the shortcut. But, really I think some people take this issure a little too seriously!

Rating: 0
You guys are really missing the point here. It's not a homemade -vs- packaged issue, per se. It's the complete sell-out of Gourmet/Bon Appetit. I believe that the majority of people that come to this website are looking for higher quality recipes. The quality of this recipe is what you would find in Family Circle, or Better Homes & Gardens. Not that there's anything wrong with that. LOL Epicurious needs to make note of what is being written on these feedback pages, and act.

Luckily, I live close to a family-owned Italian market that makes their own meatballs and sells them fresh. Being a bachelor and somewhat of an accomplished cook, this recipe is great for those nights I aboslutely have to have s'ghettis and meatballs. So there.

Yes, I like to take shortcuts with my Monday night meals. I don't think that makes me a Betty Crocker trailer trash. I also don't think shortcut recipes warrant the "Oh, there goes Gourmet/Bon Appetit!" knee-jerk reactions. It's not as if these magazines are completely full of such recipes; a good percentage of the readers appreciate the mix of the haute and the convenient. I recently came across some Gourmet magazines from the 1970's. They're a hoot - such painfully baroque menus. I'm glad we're in 2002.

To the Cook from Kalamazoo - your review was hysterical!! I am still laughing...all the way to my freezer as I grab my gourmet frozen meatballs that I purchased from the grocery store.

This is an excellent recipe for those nights when you just don't have the energy to do something special. That said, I prepared this dish, but with the following modifications. Since I did not have any store-bought "dry red wine", I used homemade, with wonderful grapes from my very own vineyard, and I whipped up a lovely bottle of post-consumer recycled glass to decant it in. Then, since I didn't have any store-bought onions, garlic, or basil--who thinks these things up?--I used my own, fresh and delightful, bursting with flavor as only your own garden produce can. Of course I used my own artisan balsamic vinegar and olive oil (from the first cold pressing, need I even say it?) and as for canned tomatoes, I've never heard of such a thing! I use only homegrown, which I monitor carefully from the time they are seedlings. Then I whipped up a quick batch of pasta, stretching it to perfection over the back of one of my Shaker chairs covered with a double-thickness of towels. Once the cheese had aged to perfection, I was almost ready to serve. Just had to grab my handy-dandy melon baller, and go scoop some meatballs out of the free-range cow in the backyard.

I agree with Beth (11/14) that making too many meatballs and freezing some is a good idea. I tried this recipe last night with a bunch of my frozen meatballs. It was delicious, although one full cup of red wine was a bit much. With a simple recipe like this one, it's important to use good ingredients: real parmigiano reggiano, wine that you can drink (don't ever use so-called "cooking wine"), and good tomatoes (Glen Muir, an organic brand, makes diced tomatoes with basil, balsamic, etc.). There's nothing wrong with simple recipes; they provide a good starting point. If one of the ingredients offends you (store-bought meatballs, pre-seasoned pork tenderloins, etc.), just substitute it!

When I make my meatballs, I always make for an army! I portion and freeze for nights when I want something easy and this sauce is it! I just use balsamic vinegar, basil and olive oil to taste as alot of any and they can overpower. The secret is the wine and I use Merlot! (If I have leftover wine I put the remainder in a mason jar and store in the fridge for my sauces otherwise it will turn if you don't have it climate controlled in the bottle) Nice sauce!

All I want to know is where I can find cans of tomatoes with balsamic vinegar,garlic and basil??? I have never seen these. Other than that the recipe looks fine...although I admit I am that terrible cook who keeps a bag of frozen meatballs around, but can make my own chicken stock.

i did in fact not make this recipe (if u can call it that) but i already know exactly what it would taste like, and you would have better luck w/ sauce from a jar and microwavable meatballs. at least then u wouldn't go through the embarassment of it being your own creation.

Sigh. The ratings/comments system for recipes on this site is becoming completely worthless. I am so sick of nearly every recipe sparking a huge philosophical debate. Did you make the recipe? If so, was it good? THAT'S why I read the comments -- NOT to see people show off their snobbery. If you're not a fan of pre-made ingredients, SKIP THE RECIPE instead of griping about the ten precious seconds of your life that Epicurious wasted by forcing you to read a recipe that you won't make.

If anyone is so busy that this recipe would actually appeal to them (or their family) they should not be spending time looking up recipes. This would cause a FOOD FIGHT if I served it.

I haven't made this exact recipe yet, but I do my own even quicker more pressed for time version (involving sauce in plastic container from the refrig section)and we all love it. When you get home late and everyone's hungry, this is real quick, and you can have a glass of the wine while it's cooking. Are you all food snobs out there ? A good meal is great, but a quick easy family dinner is what I'm often searching for !

We all have "bad hair days"! This recipe qualifies for the answer to "what are we going to eat - QUICK!" There's no shame using prepackaged just as there's no shame in "take-out".I like Bon Appetit vs. Gourmet because their recipes are in touch with reality and don't require days and hours of prep - neither of which I have.Nor do they require quantities of selectively available exotic ingredients. Those recipes were for the "good ol' days" when we were at home all day and had our own gardens.

WOULD LOVE TO HEAR FROM EPICURIOUS ON THEIR THOUGHTS OF THE PRECEDING REVIEWS...SHAME ON YOU...NO FORKS, NIVES OR SPOONS FOR THIS ONE!!!

I really think you should lighten up... everyone changes recipes to suit them all the time. Some are pressed for time, others are still learning, others have different ideas of what they'd rather use. I see that on this website all the time. I think if you want to make your own tomato sauce, meatballs etc. go for it! Lets not knock a good recipe without trying it first and by all means, use homemade sauce from fresh tomatoes and homemade meatballs. Hope you write back and let me know how it comes out.

I don't consider myself a food snob. I'm from the northeast and have to rely on good canned tomatoes in the winter for my sauce. But, come on. Any novice cook can figure how to make a sauce with canned tomatoes. We don't need to be told to add balsamic or garlic or they typical italian cheeses to make a sauce. I am all for quick easy meals but, this recipe insults your suscribers' intelligence.

I have to say - what's the big deal regarding the meatballs? I love to cook from scratch, but as a working mom with kids, it's nice to have a quickie recipe that can be enjoyed as simple comfort food. Sam's actually has a frozen meatball that's very good...lighten up, you guys!

This recipe is fine for what it represents: a quick, kid-friendly dish. With less than an hour to make and eat dinner, I will gladly use pre-made meatballs and canned tomato sauce for a decent meal. The meal is not as delicious as homemade tomato sauce simmered for hours and hand-made meatballs, but I wouldn't expect it to be. I'll reserve those pleasures for the weekends.

I didn't rate this as there were no meatballs to rate. The title for this recipe should be 'sauce for store-bought but not home-made meatballs -look elsewhere for the meatball recipes if you're inspired to cook'. Muds
