Loved this!! I read the reviews first and left all of the oil in but added about twice the lemon juice. One thing I STRONGLY recommend and that's to make this a day ahead!! Otherwise it's a bit of a salt explosion...

Loved this recipe! Consider adding 4 times the cilantro and the zest of 1 lemon to really intensify the flavour!

Tasty, simple easy. Served with grilled lamb burgers. Used 1/2 the olive oil and more lemon juice.

YUMMY!! i made this last night, it is so quick and easy. My boyfriend, who is an olive freak, LOVED it! i hate olives and i loved it too!! I did not use the cilantro--it seemed flavorful enough. This would be great spread on a sandwhich also..

AWESOME ! I made this for my husband to try and now we make it for others when they come to visit. I add a little more lemon juice and I also put all the ingredients together in the processor since it does give EXCELLENT texture. I just made it for Thanksgiving and the whole family loved it !

Delicious!! I'll definitely make this again! I did follow another reviewer's suggestion and put everything together (even the cilantro) in the processor at one time to keep good texture. Fantastic!

This is wonderful with crostini. The tapenade is very flavorful against the crisp toasted crostini. I make this a couple times a year and made it again for Christmas. My brother loves it and it's the only way I can get him over to visit. Cooks will try anything they can.

Loved it...and have made it several times since the first serving! Tip: be sure to add ALL ingredients at once if using a processor; olives will become mushy/too fine if over-chopped. Great on a toasted bagel with cream cheese!

Lovely--I used this to accompany a grilled swordfish. I added some coarsely chopped sundried tomatoes in olive oil and it was loved by all.

Intensely olive... which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Guests who enjoy essential flavors loved it... others who tend toward more tame experiences weren't as flattering. It tasted just like I expected...

Great flavor......the only thing I would do differently is I would take the time to mince the olives rather than to use a food processor as they became too processed and I didn't like the texture as much. Otherwise, great!!!!!

A friend brought this to a party I had. I now request it every time she asks what she can bring. Wonderful!

This was great. I like the tang green olives give the tapenade. I also used it as a spread for a sandwich and it worked very well.

This recipe is a great, quick and easy starter. The flavors are fabulous and the cilantro gives it an added zip.
