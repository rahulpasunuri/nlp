Outrageously good. I was skeptical about the raw zucchini, but it was soft, tender and flavorful. Thought it was better fresh than a few hours later, which is rare for cold salads - still delicious, though.

I made a few changes to this recipe. I used yellow squash instead of zucchini, left the peas raw and I added 2t toasted sesame oil. I also used black sesame seeds. The salad was tasty, the salt technique softened the squash without making it soggy and the flavors were perfect for a summer lunch.

This was disappointing. I used home grown sugar snap peas and zucchini, so everything was tender and fresh. The resulting salad, however, just "lay there" and was not at all interesting.

This was okay. Soy taste was a bit strong, and raw zucchini has a strange little aftertaste. I tried to eat it as a lunch salad; maybe if I had a protein to balance the plate I would have liked it better. FYI - if you use small zucchini you can feed it through the tube on top of the food processor; ten seconds and done!

This was terrific, even if I had to make it without the snow peas and sesame seeds since I didn't have any when I decided to make it. Brooklyn, I sliced the zucchini crosswise.

This was a very nice, light alternative summer salad. A great new way to use those summer zuccs! We used some sugar snap peas and they were even better than the snow peas.

question - did you slice the zucchini crossway or lengthwise, ribbon stylee?

I was skeptical but I have lots of peas and zucchini in the garden now... Delicious! Next time I'll add about 1 tbsp minced fresh ginger.

Oh yeah! This is THE SALAD for those who dislike mayonnaise. So easy to make, so fresh and yes... it is very good to be eaten together with the tuna miso- glazed kebab.

An excellent summer side dish. I served it with grilled lamb steak. It would also be fine with grilled chicken.
