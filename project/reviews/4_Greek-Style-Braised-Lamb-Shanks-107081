I made this for the first time, and it was delicious! There was a slight sweetness to the broth that made the taste unique and addictive. In fact, I had three bowls, it was so good! I modified the recipe to reflect the ingredients I had on hand, followed some other readers' tips, and added some personal preferences. In terms of things on hand; I didn't have any gin or juniper berries, so I skipped them; didn't have any cinnamon sticks, so used 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon; substituted 2/3 of a bottle of leftover Tempranillo for the whole bottle of Merlot; and substituted dried thyme for the fresh. As other readers suggested, I dusted the lamb shanks with flour before browning them, and I replaced the tomato paste with a can of diced tomatoes. As for personal preferences: I rubbed the lamb shanks with Greek seasoning before dusting them and browning them; cooked everything in a crockpot (1.5 hrs on high, 8 hours on low); and since I am fond of root vegitables, I added a second carrot, added a chopped medium parsnip, and a cup of chopped butternut squash. I'm thinking the latter is what imparted the slight sweetness to the dish. When everything had finished cooking, I skimmed the oil, but decided not to reduce the broth. The broth had already thickened slightly (due to the flour dusting) and its strength and consistency were already acceptable to me. I then served it over white rice (next time I may try the reader suggestion to add some orzo during the last hour of cooking). I have prepared lamb shanks many times using other recipes. I have to say that this recipe's unique set of flavors makes it my new best friend!

I almost never give 4 forks, but this was the best lamb I've had. I was just trying to use up some gross freezerburned old shanks, but they were so amazing when they came out of the oven (3 hours is right, as other reviewers have said) that I had to invite the neighbours over & have an impromptu party. I put in much more thyme, left out the cinnamon & discarded almost all the browning fat (it really is important to brown them deeply), then defatted again at the end. Incredibly good.

We make this recipe all of the time! There is no better recipe for lamb shanks, and there is no cut of lamb better than the shank. Some observations: 1.) 2 hours is not long enough! It took us awhile (years ago) to figure this out. 3 Hours, or the shank will still be tough and fatty. 2.) Get big shanks (1-1/4lbs+), which are enough then for 1 per person. Smaller shanks are more trouble than they are worth. Youll have to ask and/or hunt to find these, and only with American lamb (NZ and Australian lamb is slaughtered younger). When we see them, we buy and freeze, keeping a stockpile. 3.) Anchovies are a must, and if you didnt know it, you wouldnt know they were there. We put in the whole tin, oil and all. Its the key. 4.) Easy on the tomato paste, -we dont use it at all, but rather a 12oz can of diced. 5.) Add a handful of Greek (not CA) olives with brine for the last hour. 6.) We prefer beef stock and white wine. 7.) If you have some, a dash of Asian Fish Sauce is a nice touch. 8.) Best served with Greek oven roasted potatoes (lemon/oregano/olive oil/garlic). You can finish the last part of the braise on the stovetop. And, of course, green beans sauteed in garlic. 9.) If you make extra shanks, then you can use them, together with the sauce, to make Arni Youvetsi (a delicious Greek orzo/lamb casserole) for leftovers. 10.) True. The sauce never looks quite perfect (we dont strain it or otherwise alter it). But the flavors are so wonderful and full that after 1 fork-full, no one will care about how the sauce looks! The flavors are so pronounced that a little sauce goes a long way here. Youll be fine.

wonderful recipe, really pretty easy to make. Both times I've almost run out of gravy in the cooking process though. I don't strain out the drippings, just pour a spoonful over the top when serving. Fabulous!

Everyone LOVED this one. I have another recipie for braised lamb shanks so I followed its process because the sauce always comes out so nice and thick. Here is how I changed it: Dust the shanks with flour and then brown them. You'll find that they brown nicely in less time. Why add one tablespoon of tomato paste when you can add the WHOLE (albeit small) can? Doing so will make your sauce thicker with a nice, dark, rich colour. Oh, someone else said not to leave out the anchovies. I hate them but I put them in anyway. Oddly enough, it made a very positive difference. A couple of sprigs of fresh thyme? PUH-LEEZE. Grab a handful, tie a string around them and drop them in for the last hour - I find fresh herbs do their best work when they aren't overcooked. I let it simmer in the oven for 3 hours and the meat was as tender as can be. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes. All in all, one of the most successful meals I've served up.

This lamb shank recipe is positively delicious! I omitted the anchovies and juniper berries but I followed the rest of the recipe and it got rave reviews from the 10 people at my Greek dinner party.

This was great! It was my third attempt to make shanks, and these prove that I can make them. Used cabernet and a little madeira. Also used 3/4 of all liquid recommended. Did not have a big enough pan, so the shanks were a bit crowded, which did not affect the taste at all. Better the nex day! Made with orzo, but I think mashed potatos will go better next time.

smelled good. tasted ok. enjoyed the cinnamon flavor. presentation lacking color. dark brown, heavy, rich, comfort food. meat not tender enough to suit us. used SE Australian Merlot. had to use cornstarch to thicken sauce.

The best lamb I have ever had. Used a cab merlot and I used an emerition blender the wiz all the gravy mixture into a sauce. I did this half an hour before the dish would be finished and added orzo pasta to the sauce to cook in the sauce. It turned wonderfully. Used lamb shanks from Whole Foods and gin not berries.

Delicious! I had a shiraz on hand and used that. Strained the braising liquid and reduced it...so rich, so good. Served over whole wheat couscous for a hearty meal on a cold night.

The absolute best lamb shank recipe bar none. Excellent for a dinner party as you can put everything in the oven ahead of time. Can also be done in the slow cooker for two (with ingredients reduced appropriately).

This was amazing, full of flavour, succulent and actually not that complicated if you took some advice from some of the previous reviewers. I speeded things up by browning shanks as directed but only lightly and then roasted them on roasting tray at medium high heat for the 30 or so minutes that it takes to prepare/brown veg and boil wine/broth mix etc. This achieves 3 things: browns meat evenly, reduces braising time by half hour and cooks off some of the fat. Then followed directions pretty much to the letter. Previous reviewers have complained that sauce is too thin, no problem - just add gravy thickening granules (Bisto in England - does not detract from flavour.) But skim well first. Served it with risotto milanese (With saffron) and broccoli. Real winner.

I made this recently with store bought lamb shanks (whole foods) and then again with local organic lamb shanks. Both were outstanding but the local lamb was more tender and flavorful, which made for even more layers of flavor. I served this with saffron risotto and a very good montepulciano d'abruzzo. i cooked with a straightforward organic merlot and would be curious to hear others' comments on wines they used to cook with. note: i had a lot of cooking liquid left over but decided not to puree and reduce - instead I reduced some merlot in another pot with a bit of rosemary and garlic, then added some of the cooking liquid (strained through a fine mesh sieve) and poached diced turnip, baby carrots, and julienned spring onion which I served along with the meat and risotto. the remaining cooking liquid and vegetables i will use to put over pasta as another meal or strain and reserve for something else.

A beautiful blending, no-- a marriage made in Heaven of ingrediants. No condiment overpowered another, but they were all there in subtle harmony. Of course, home grown lamb and handcrafted wine did help. We will definitely do this one again!

After reading all the rave reviews, I was very excited to have the opportunity to make this dish. It certainly smelled wonderful-my kitchen was very fragant with the smell of cinnamon. However, the dish itself was rather bland. A couple of things may have attributed to this. The lamb shanks were from Whole Foods, and very lean, so there wasn't a lot of fat to add to the taste. Also, I think it needed more seasoning, but I don't know what more of. Any suggestions? I'll try making it another time, using less lean lamb.

this is one of the most delicious meals ever- and easy to make ahead for a dinner party. i cooked it for over 3 hours and it fell off the bone.

WONDERFUL! This recipe was soooo good, my boyfriend ( who usually hates lamb ) raved about this one. Although quite unusual, the ingredients blend perfectly and you feel like the best chef in the world when you serve this dish to your friends. GO AHEAD AND MAKE THIS ONE!

although my friends and family loved this one, i doubt i'll make it again. i found that it had a very odd smell to it that i couldn't get past. perhaps it was the odd combination of ingredients. it does taste delicious, no doubt about that and even better the next day but i would enjoy it more if my nose was too stuffed to smell it. there are much better lamb shank receipes to choose from.

Made this for the Olympic gymnastic final with toasted almond orzo and a traditional greek village salad. Fantastic sauce, but even better with rich chicken stock. I doubt the restaurant uses canned broth (I used to live near the restaurant and know they use fresh ingredients). Don't forget the anchovies (paste works just as well). Good eats!

I made this dish for a family gathering - a birthday party. Everyone raved about it; it was so delicious. I saved the left over gravy and used it with chicken, etc. over the week. Just fabulous - can't say enough good about it. I couldn't find orzo so I used polenta and that worked just as well. You have to try this recipe!

Oboy! This was fabulous. We all licked our fingers! I served it with polenta, too. Having to add anchovies was a surprise, but don't leave them out.

Delicious! Didn't strain the sauce. Used a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon instead. Added some small fresh mushrooms. Cooked covered for about 4 hours. Also deleted the tomato paste. Perfect for a rainy spring meal!

This is one of the best lamb recipes I have ever had. As a personal chef, I am always trying new recipes on my clients and this is always a huge hit. I serve it with polenta instead of orzo-the polenta soaks up some of the sauce and compliments it perfectly.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!!

Absolutely great! Because it was getting late (I started it too late in the day), I didn't spend much time on the sauce--just strained it and mushed some of the vegetables through the strainer while doing so. It wasn't as thick as expected, but it was delicious and the orzo sucked up the juices on the plate. Big, smiley faces all around! It was definitely a "Happy Easter Dinner".

Very tasty and easy. I didn't bother passing the sauce through a strainer, etc. because it looked good as it was, chunks and all. And mmm mmm mmm was it. Oh, and all I had was pinot noir instead of merlot, and that worked well.

This is a keeper. Maybe I need a large stock pot, but I don't have any oven-proof pots big enough to hold the lamb in one layer. I had to use a roasting pan. When cooking uncovered, it tends to evaporate too much sauce and I don't thing the meat gets as tender. So I cooked uncovered for about an hour, then covered with tinfoil for another hour and a half. The smell was fantastic but the proof was in the taste. Wow! I didn't bother straining the sauce as it was thick and I would have been left with very little. I did the day ahead method but kept the sauce separate and reheated the lamb carefully in a pot (put in some beef broth to sort of moist steam re-heat), heating the sauce separately and serving like gravy over it. Served it with a saffron risotto. Everyone raved.

This was excellent. I also had a problem with the thinness of the sauce, however, blending the final sauce and adding a cornstarch mixture to thicken made the sauce as thick as the one in the picture. Delicious!

This was one of the best lamb shank recipes I have ever made. You can let this sit in the oven as long as you want, the longer the better. About an hour before eating I added a box of orzo. I stirred it every 15 minutes. It absorded all the liquid and was delicious!

This was delicious - I made it for dinner last night, and my husband and I are fighting to see who gets the left overs! I didn't have cinammon sticks, so used ground cinammon with success - the aroma of this braising in the oven is fabulous. I did, however, have to braise the lamb longer than 2 hours - I gave it almost 3, at which point it was fork tender, and the sauce had reduced beautifully. This will become a favourite!

I followed the recipe exactly, but was disappointed. Even after pureeing, my gravy was thin (nothing like the picture), and the lamb shanks were tough. I have made braised lamb shanks with other recipes from this site with great success, so I'm not going to make this one again. In the meantime, I'm going to try simmering the leftovers in my slow cooker to see if I can improve them at all.
