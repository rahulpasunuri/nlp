These were fantastic, much better than making a whole loaf and very flavorful. I expected them to take longer because of other reviews but mine only took 25 minutes. I made a few small modifications- I ran a carrot and celery rib and about 4 slices of bacon through the food processor since I only had 1 lb of meat. I also subbed a little bit of "Pappy's Moonshine Madness" in for the ketchup on the glaze. My husband loved the bacon crisps but I think it was perfect without.

This is my go-to meatloaf recipe. I made it with only 1 lb of ground sirlion, cut the eggs to 1 (it bound together fine), added 2 carrots and 1 celery stalk (minced) sauteed them in the skillet for 4 minutes prior to adding the onion and garlic. I skipped the bacon. In addition, I added a couple of shakes of Louisiana hot sauce to the ketchup-vinegar glaze to give it a little zing.

My fav meatloaf bar none...thanks to all the other reviewers whose suggestions I took...like the Alton Brown glaze, and that whole milk really makes a difference. I'd like to add: no matter what size you shape the loaves, just go by the meat thermometer temp and you'll be fine. Also, I ground up at least 2T of fennel seeds and added to the mix...I love this taste in meatloaf! It tastes even better the 2nd day!! I do vote for the bacon topping...I cook it in a pan to just abt. crisp and the put in on the loaves at the end to broil them..it's an indulgence. I also mix the meatloaf mixture up the day before and leave it in the fridge to meld before baking it off the next day.

Very good recipe; easy. I agree with others, you can skip the bacon crisps to save time, calories and cleanup.

This meatloaf is the best I've ever had. It is scrumptuous! My kids and husband couldn't get enough. One early review suggested that you need to watch the cook time and our experience was the same - it definitely wasn't 25 minutes in the oven, more like 35.

Really fun recipe! A nice twist on comfort food, they look really nice on the plate as well. I left out the bacon one time and it was still great. I have also made in 1/2 cup measure for kids and it was a big hit.

Great simple and tasty. I jazzed up the glaze a little with hot sauce and some brown sugar. I like the crust you get from the individual portions instead doing a whole loaf. It also looks a little more "special" and could even be served for a casual supper with friends.

Very good, moist meatloaves. Easy to make and quick. The bacon doesn't add anything to the dish, won't use next time.

Great; easy todo after work without too much fuss. Be careful of the time. It will continue to cook after you take it out of the oven.

This is, hands down, the best meatloaf I have ever had. And I will be making it again soon. The real reason I'm writing a review is to warn folks that this dish does NOT take 45 minutes start to finish. It takes 45 minutes to bake after it's in the oven. Yes, it takes much less time than one big loaf, but it still takes longer than I had the evening I tried it.

I thought this was a very good meatloaf recipe, very easy to make and very moist. The individual loaves cook faster than the "traditional" big loaf, which I liked in getting to the table on time. I pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except that I added a carrot to my food processor when chopping the onion and garlic. Also, instead of Worcestershire sauce, I used a product called Dale's Seasoning Sauce. It's awesome stuff and I can't make burgers or grill steak without it! Finally, I used a different ketchup glaze, one that I got from Alton Brown's meatloaf recipe (which is also very good, but more time consuming). He uses 1/2 cup ketchup, dash of worcesterhire, dash of tabasco, 1 T. Honey. Bake loaves 10 minutes before topping with the ketchup mixture and proceed with the rest of the recipe. I will definitely make this meatloaf again.

I made this meatloaf with ground turkey and left out the bacon. It was very delicious. Definitely will make it again.

I am not a big meatloaf fan; however, family requested it. This version has changed my mind. I doubled the recipe and made two large loaves; used equal parts ground chuck and sweet italian sausage (casings removed); substituted skim for whole milk; and put the glaze into a slight depression on the top of the loaves and covered with a slice of uncooked pepper bacon (Kunzler's from Lancaster, PA-- the best) on before baking. Typical improvisations, I guess. My house smelled delicious, and my husband and daughter told me "not to change one thing." This is in our familiy's Top Ten. Highest rating.

Great meatloaf. Although, next time I will use 1.25 lb beef, .25 lb italian seasoned pork, and only 1 tbsp parsley (italian pork comes very seasoned). Also, I would double the sauce recipe and add .25 c of light brown sugar. It took me 30 min in oven and sauce was applied last 5 min of oven time. Best meatloaf I've ever had...and my wife liked it.

Although I usually only give 4 forks to unique or particularly special recipes, because this was so easy and so good, I thought even this old traditional standby deserved it. Made with 2/3 ground chuck and 1/3 ground pork, omitted the bacon. Flavorful and VERY moist. One of the best recipes for meatloaf I've tried. (Note: I did need to cook 10-15 minutes longer than indicated; however, I used a pyrex pan and the loaves were fairly close together, so this may have affected the time.)

My usual recipe is quite similar but calls for hot or sweet Italian sausage (mooshed up out of the casings) instead of ground pork. Having no sausage, but some ground pork, I did some improvisation with great results. My bread crumbs were in my freezer from a leftover rosemary/garlic foccacia although any decent bread would do. I added a couple of tablespoons of Italian seasoning and about a teaspoon of crushed-up fennel seed along with about a quarter cup of ketchup into the meat mixture. I then made one large meatloaf (I was in no hurry, and having the 375 degree oven on for an hour and half was quite welcome)glazed with the ketchup/vinagar sauce and laid 3 strips of thick bacon on top. My 9 year old had three helpings and ignored the rest of the meal. The house smelled great as well. The one other thing I've learned in the quest for a good meatloaf is not to waste money on lean ground beef. The texture is much better with your basic ground chuck and some kind of pork combo.

This was the ultimate meatloaf recipe, made it by the book and didn't find that it needed an altering to my taste...very yummy! Next time, might not make the vinegar glaze but that is just a personal taste thing. It was good the first night but was a little too pungent for the leftovers.

This one's a keeper... the best meatloaf recipe I've found. Moist, flavorful, easy to make (my 10-year-old does most of the work!). Definitely use the full amount of whole milk, not 2%; I would not reduce the amount as one cook recommended. Same goes for the onions. My family did not care for the ketchup glaze, but the bacon adds unexpectedly, complementary flavor.

Yum. I made it just as written and it was fantastic. Moist and flavorful and very easy to make. I liked the contrast of the tangy ketchup/vinegar with the meat -- brown sugar and BBQ sauce would be overkill to me! There is also a reason why you need whole milk for richness. I find the Gourmet recipes are well tested and of high quality overall and thus do not feel the need to fool around with them too much.

This recipe was delicious! The individual portions made it elegant (as elegant as meatloaf can be). I modified the recipe slightly (based on other readers' suggestions). I only used 1/2 cup of milk. I added a little basil, sage, cayenne pepper and ketchup to the meatloaf mixture. I added a little brown sugar and barbeque sauce to the glaze.

I brought this meatloaf (cold, for sandwiches) to a family reunion. What a hit! Most went back for seconds. I have been searching for a standard "Mom's meatloaf" and this is it. It surely will become a standard in my household.

I had such great childhhod memories of my mother's meatloaf I decided to make this one night for my husband. He raved about it! I actually made a double batch and used two small loaf pans - we ate one (leftovers for a few nights but there were no complaints!)and froze one for later. I've made it a few more times and each time my husband asks "what's for dinner?" and I say "meatloaf" his response is "badass!". So now it's called "K's Badass Meatloaf" in my house!

What a great recipe. I used a half-cup measure so I could serve it as an appetizer, and the cooking time was still 25 minutes. I used skim milk instead of whole. I also added 1 tbsp. light brown sugar to the ketchup instead of vinegar. I skipped the bacon and the broiling to save time. I had many requests for the recipe.

I made this for my husband and a guest. We all enjoyed it very much. The glaze helps keep the loaves moist and delicious. The instant read thermometer is a must to ensure that the meat is cooked perfect.

I grate the onion, use just 1/2 c. milk & instead of flat-leaf parsley use 1 TBsp. Italian seasoning. This is a good meatloaf!

Instead of baking these, I made them into oval shaped paties about 2 inches thick and pan fried them with a little olive oil. I skip the bacon, ketchup and vinegar and make a nice gravy with the pan drippings. Serve with mashed potatoes with the skins on. My son says this is his favorite food.

Instead of baking these, I made them into oval shaped paties about 2 inches thick and pan fried them with a little olive oil until they were cooked through. I skip the bacon and ketchup and vinegar. Made a nice gravy with the drippings and poured over the top. My college aged son says this is his favorite food. Served with mashed potatoes with the skins or with pan roasted potatoes with montreal seasoning on them.

This was decent, I mainly chose it for the individual portion aspect in hopes that it would be quicker to bake than a whole loaf. Could use more flavor, and did anyone else feel the uncooked meat mixture had too much liquid? I added a bit of extra bread crumbs.

Great recipe. For some reason this ended up making extra loaves for me which was a nice surprise as they are terrific leftovers. Just heat up in the microwave, make some fresh sauce (heat that on the stove) and it's an easy peasy meal. Goes well with mashed potatoes (skin on) with scallions and blue cheese mixed in.

Great flavor! We added cayenne pepper (as suggested by another reader), fresh red bell pepper, basil and sage. To make as one hole loaf double the cooking time. DON'T forget the bacon it adds amazing flavor...especially pepper bacon!

I was looking for a flavorful meatloaf recipe that was not dry, and found it. To improve on the texture even further I recommend adding 1/4 cup of flour to the mix. I also added some cayenne pepper and 1/3 cup of ketchup to the meat, but it is not required. This recipe is in my permanent file.

Excellent recipe for an everyday dish!

Wonderfully flavored and moist; a real payoff for the time involved. The sauce could have been a bit more complex for our taste. We were prepared to forego the bacon bits -- but after comparing "bites" with and without, we though there was a definite improvement in the overall flavor. Hard to describe -- just made it special in a way we didn't expect.

It was a snap to make and, if necessary, easy to "ad lib". It had a very nice flavor, which, to me, is unusual for a meatloaf and everyone LOVED it. The request is in for meatloaf sandwiches already.

I am always looking for new ways to do meatloaf, and I can't be happier with the results! I followed the recipe exactly, and it was a big hit! I even had some excess mixture which I froze and will use in one BIG meatloaf! The bacon was good, but unnecessary! The topping is also one of the best I've tried! Really delicious.

My family has not been much on meatloaf in the past, but I usually tried turkey meatloaf to lower the fat and they always turned out dry and bland. These were great! I used a combination of 1lb. ground beef and 1lb. ground pork. Thought the onion/garlic mixture made the dish extra moist and tasty. The sauce had a nice tang to it also. My 4 and 6 yr. olds even gobbled it up. The individual portions are nice, and great with roasted new potatoes. Will do again.

I would actually give this 2.5 stars if it were possible. It was okay but nothing special. Having individual loaves was nice. I just barely avoided the loaves drying out and would have preferred a sauce of some sort (mushroom gravy?) but perhaps not with the ketchup glaze. The bacon crips add some needed omphf - I should have cooked some extra strips.

I thought this was pretty good. I have only made meatloaf once before successfully; all my other attempts yielded bland or really dry loaves. However, this one was moist, tasty, and relatively easy to prepare. I made salt roasted potatoes to go with it -- another easy dish.

These are tasty and cute, and the single serving portions have particular appeal to children. I was working in too much of a hurry and made a mistake, forgetting to add the onion mixture (which I had already sauteed) until I already had the loaves formed and topped with the glaze. There was no way to get the glaze off, so I mixed it into the meat, together with the onions, and then formed new loaves. If anything, the added glaze gave the meat a little extra tang that was pleasant. The next time I make this, I am going to make the loaves somewhat smaller; they really are quite a large portion, even by the standards of my 19-year-old son. The other thing to remember is that they flatten a bit while they cook, so it's best to make them a bit taller than the hoped-for end result. Finally, it's very important to line the baking pan, as instructed in the recipe. I used the new non-stick foil, and it was clear that the meatloaves even wanted to stick to that.

Fantastic recipe that works as a casual meal or dressed up for a dinner party. Served 10 portions for a dinner of 11 (the vegetarian got a sauteed portabello) each on top of a scoop of thick chunk garlic mashed potatoes and sprinkled with long cut garlic chives. Go lite on the onions and the milk though.

These meatloaves are terrific--definitely some of the best I've had! They are very moist and flavorful, and simple to make. The portions are quite large though, and I might make a bunch of smaller ones next time.
