I am going to be one of those annoying reviewers who gives high marks to a recipe that I completely modified. However, what I'm demonstrating is that you can substitute most of the ingredients and it is still good! In my case, I didn't have green onions, so I substituted red onions and I forgot the sugar. I also didn't have coconut milk, so I was substituted non-fat yogurt and "So Delicious" coconut milk creamer (yes, the stuff for your coffee) and it turned out beautifully. I also eliminated the vegetable oil (just sauteed the onions/ginger/garlic/ with some veggie broth), but it was still rich because of the peanut butter. So I highly recommend playing around with this recipe; it's very flexible and will be delicious no matter what you put in it, as long as it has red curry paste and peanut butter!

Super easy, very good. I didn't have any Thai curry paste so I diced some fresh jalapenos with the seeds and added a bunch more lime juice. I also didn't have any chicken broth and actually forgot to add more water and salt and it was still great tasting. It's hard to mess up this one.

This recipe is great, particularly if you love red curry and peanut sauce (like me). Served it over steamed vegetables, sauteed tofu, and basmati rice, and it was exactly what I've been looking for. I did add a little lemongrass to the spices, since I had some on hand. Delicious!

Made this as a sauce for plain steamed broccoli and tofu over rice, and everyone liked it. Mild, but not boring.

I was missing quite a few ingredients for this recipe but made it anyway and it was very good. Instead of peanut butter I used 2 Tbs. of an organic ginger & peanut sauce. I also didn't have any cilantro but didn't need it. I sauteed some peppers, onion, carrots, bok choy and zucchini, marinated some beef in the curry and then cooked them all together. Let them simmer for awhile and then served over rice. It was delicious!

This is most likely THE perfect sauce. It is incredibly easy to make and flat-out delicious. We usually eat it with satay and basmati rice. A little green papaya salad with lime is the perfect compliment.

So many variations made but the feeling of the recipe was kept. Thank goodness: this was really tasty over a bed of Epicurious' Curried Rice with Cauliflower, Bell Pepper, and Green Onions. Will make again as a marinade. Oh, I didn't use broth but rather dehydrated beef bouillon. It means I didn't have to wait for the water to boil out of the sauce.

With the addition of cayenne pepper, we thought that this was an excellent sauce for grilled chicken and grilled tofu.

I had high anticipations for this sauce and it delivered. It has a nice peanut flavor with just a little kick. I did encounter a minor problem though. The sauce would not emulsify so I gave it a whirl in my mini food processor and that did the trick. We tried it on two versions of grilled satays, steak (above) and chicken (below), with threaded skewers of cubed meat, red onion, and sliced yellow squash and zucchini. We generously brushed the satays with the sauce during grilling and served it on the side as well. http://michaelbeyer.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/steak-satays-with-red-curry-peanut-sauce/

This is a really good sauce for grilling. I halved the recipe and I used 3 tbs red curry and 3 tbs peanut butter. I used shrimp and brushed the sauce on while they grilled. Very tasty. Can't wait to try this with chicken.
