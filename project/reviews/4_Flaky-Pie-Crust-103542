This is a great all purpose pie crust recipe. It was easy to make and worked very well. It was not dry and did not tear.

This is a fairly simple somewhat generic crust recipe, that in my opinion gave average results. Would I make it again, yes just because it complimented each pie that I made but it did not stand out on it's own. If you are looking for a buttery crust I would go with a different recipe.

This crust is amazing and oh so easy. Don't be thrown by the cider vinegar. The flavor is amazing.

Fantastic. I had never before made pie crust because I was lazy and thought it would take too long. NEVER again will I buy a frozen crust! This is simple and just so so good. It takes hardly any time at all and my friends were thrilled with the results!

It seemed like too much fat in the recipe, so I used 1/3 of a cup of shortening and all the butter. It was excellent, perfect crust. I used all water and none of the vinegar, and it was still good. The lesser amount of fat may help the sticky problem in rolling out that someone else in a previous comment had.

This makes a great pie crust. I like it best making it in a bowl with a pastry blender. I made it once in a processor and it was tough, so I'm back making it the old fashioned way. To the person from San Francisco who said their dough was sticky, I'm no expert, but you may be using too much water. With a hand pastry blender the dough is fairly moist without even adding the water. The last time I made it I only used about 4 tablespoons. Also, a rolling pin cover or a piece of wax paper helps a lot.

This will now be my go to pie crust. It is easy to follow, easy to work with and actually makes enough dough for two crusts! In the future I may try to replace the flour with pastry flour. The crust was nice and flaky, and was not doughy at all! Will make this one again (I used this crust with the classic two crust apple pie)

I gave this recipe four forks because it came out beautifully. It was really perfect. However, while I was making it, I had a soupy mess in my food processor and needed more flour than the recipe called for. Once I figured that out, it was smooth sailing. I will use this crust again

I just used this again to make the broccoli garlic quiche recipe from the website. lol I had the ingrediants and was staring at the pre-made crusts in the store and decided to make my own again. It was even better this time!I pre-baked the crust this time. I am so impressed! Why would anyone ever buy a pre-made crust again?!

Question for experienced bakers: When I roll out the dough, it is really sticky (sticks to the pin and keeps shrinking back). So, I sprinkled more flour on the rolling pin and surface. By the time the dough is rolled out to the right size, it became dry and brittle and nearly impossible to transfer in one piece to the pie dish. Any suggestions on how to help this situation?

Wow, amazing crust. Flaky from the shortening, full of butter flavor from the butter. I have made many pie crust recipes and this one is definitely at the top. The ratio of butter to shortening is perfect. I mixed the water/vinegar together before adding to the dough and usually use only 1/2 the amount. Make sure you scoop/swipe when measuring the flour to gaurantee a tender crust. Too much flour can toughen your dough and demand more water. I cut the butter/shortening into the flour by hand then use my KitchenAid Mixer to add the liquid. I don't own a food processor and the mixer works great. I do chill the dough to let the gluten relax, which helps makes rolling out easier. This dough was super-easy to roll and made just enough for a deep dish apple pie. I bake at 450 for the first 15 minute to get the bottom crust a head start, then reduce to 400 for the remaining 40-45 min. Perfect cooked crust everytime, no soggy bottom.

I made this for the first time yesterday. I had given up on making my own crust, but decided to try again for an apple pie I was making. I followed the recipe exactly. It was dead easy, so easy that I wasn't sure I had done it right. However, the results were fantastic. Everyone who ate the pie complimented me on the crust. I think it was the best tasting and flakiest crust I had ever eaten. I will never use another crust recipe, or buy store bought crust again. A keeper!

I used to think my mom's pastry recipe was the ultimate... until I made this one. This recipe is amazingly simple, yet with professional results! I made it last night for a meat pie recipe also found on Epi. I was surprised at how flaky it turned out, with such little effort. No changes necessary--perfect as is! Move over, Mom!!!

This pie crust saved my Thanksgiving! It's flaky, has a great taste and it's easy to work with. I used a pastry blender to mix the dry ingredients and the fats. It worked out beautifully. After years of searching for a great pie crust... my search ends here.

This is a very forgiving recipe. I used pastry flour instead of all-purpose and used half the liquid and it turned out perfect. It broke as I transfered it to the pie plate and was just too soft so I added a bit more flour and rolled it again. It was still so flaky and did not seem to toughen up at all despite the extra handling!

Question - does anyone know the baking instructions (temp & time) for this recipe?

I usually just always use the Joy of Cooking recipe. But this one had vinegar and I just HAD to try it! DISASTER STRUCK. It was very humid in my kitchen last night, the dough was clumping a bit with no moisture added, and unthinkingly I just dumped in all of the water in stead of tbsp by tbsp, and the dough was way, way too wet and almost like bread dough in some parts. But it was too late to throw it out and start again (11 pm...) so I went ahead with it, tears in my eyes. And the next day, finished product? Absolutely delicious. I don't know how it happened. But it did.

I am so glad I tried this recipe. I have never made a pie crust that was presentable until now! I ended up having to roll it between waxed paper as it stuck to my floured board on the first attempt. I will make this again!! I cannot believe how easy this was.

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great. I had some dough left over so I rolled it out, cut out squares, put it in a small amount of jam, folded the corner over and make turnovers. The turnovers were so flaky and a bigger hit than the pie itself.

This was my first attempt at pie crust in years, and the only reason I tried it was because I had a shiny new KA Food Processor that I wanted to try out. I was amazed at how quickly that KA made coarse crumbs of my dough, but that's another review. :-p Per previous reviews I was very cautious regarding the amount of liquid. In a small bowl I mixed 5 TBS of ice water and the 2 tsp of cider vinegar, but ended up using maybe just over half of the liquid because the dough would have been soggy. As it was, I still had a wet goo on the outside of the disk when I put it in plastic wrap in the fridge. It rolled out OK, but very, very fragile and teared so easily that I could barely pick it up, and that was rolled out to 1/8" thick, so it wasn't paper thin!! I rolled on floured wax paper and had to do quite the tricky maneuvering to get that dough into the pie pan in one piece. The dough was so buttery that it slid down the sides of my glass pie pan when I pre-baked the crust to set the eggwhite wash. I had to pull it back up and press down as carefully as I could, and that was WITH a fluted overhang on the deep dish! I think I want to try homemade pie crust again, especially since this KA is making it so easy, but I'm not sure if I'll use this recipe again. Honestly, we haven't tried it yet, the Apple Streusel Pie is cooling on the counter as I type. The edges are very irregular because of the sliding, and it burned on all fluted edges (my oops). It's not a 'pretty' pie, but I'm sure hoping it tastes OK! Wondering if I'll try this recipe again with less liquid or simply keep looking!?

I struggle with pie crusts and this was no exception. The flavor was well receive by all even though the crust was so fragile it crumbled when touched. I believe the problem was due to sifting the flour prior to measuring the flour. Sifting can increase volume 20% or more. I used a food processor to mix the ingredients .When adding the directed amounts of water and apple cider vinegar, the dough turned to mush. In the second batch no liquids were added . I will be trying this recipe again with unsifted flour.

This recipe solved for me the great mystery of how to make a good pie crust. Had no problems at all and followed the recipe exactly--it was the best behaved pie dough I've ever made. I refrigerated the dough overnight and noticed that it was helpful to let it sit out a little before rolling. I baked both a blackberry and an apple pie for guests yesterday, and a number of them--including my husband-- swore they were the best pies they'd ever eaten! Even as the baker, I had to agree.I credit this recipe--you could go into business using it!

I used this recipe to make an apple-blackberry pie for an English dinner party. It was a great success. The crust was one of the best I've made and I've made a lot of pie crusts. I actuallly needed a little bit more ice water. It all depends on the flour you're using. You have to decide by how the dough looks and feels if you've added enough moisture.

I always make my own crust and decided to try a different one this year. This recipe has too much shortening in it. Shortening helps make a pie crust flaky but you should not be able to taste the shortening in the finished product.

After reading the reviews, I should have been even more cautious with the liquid, but despite adding a little more than half, it was still too much. It was hard to roll out and difficult to get into the pan, but people really enjoyed the end result. I'll make it again and use even less liquid.

This was my first homeade pie crust and it was a complete success! I read other reviews first for suggestions, which has helped in the past w/ other recipes. I just chilled the shortening instead of freezing it, used regular vinegar plus a dash of lemon juice (didn't have cider vinegar), and didn't use all the liquid. I also used a pastry cloth and cover for my rolling pin. I couldn't have been happier- VERY easy, VERY delicious... I got rave reviews from everyone, and my friends couldn't believe I made the crust myself!

Looks like I am not in agreement with most on this one. It was tasty, easy in the food processor but less easy tho not impossible to roll out. I needed to pre-bake the shell, and it was so buttery the sides slid down the edge of the pie plate after 2 minutes in the oven! I whipped it out of the oven and added more pie weights(beans). it did taste good, but i have had other pie crusts that are less rich and that i like better.

I had some problems with this crust, but it turned out great. I didn't have to add any extra water. I found it very difficult to roll out. It kept falling apart. But, it was easy to patch back together. I used this crust with a pumpkin pie.

This is the most difficult crust I have ever worked with and it is well worth every bit of extra work. The best pie crust I have ever tasted anywhere.

Following the instructions in the recipe produced a crust that was impossible to work with. It broke apart in my hands, fell apart on the pie, and made the ugliest pies I've ever seen, but it tasted so good, I put up with it. Then once, pressed for time, I used room-temperature shortening instead of frozen. What a change! It was the most beautiful crust I've ever made! Easy to work with, still delicious, and just great. I'd have given it 4 forks if it weren't for the frozen/room-temperature problem in the instructions.

This is the best pie crust recipe I've found in years. I followed the instructions to the letter. The first time I did not process the flour and shortening/butter sufficiently which led me to use the waxed paper routine for rollout.

The end result is amazingly flaky and delicious -- won raves from many.

A great crust, will be my standard from now one. I used 1 c. of salted butter, cut back on the salt and shortening, and used the white wine vinegar I had on hand. Still came out perfectly.

Used this with the "Piled High Peach Pie" and made a lattice top - absolutely amazingly perfect! I floured my board before I rolled out the crust and even had to redo the top crust (because I'd never woven a lattice before) and it was still tender and crisp even with all the reworking.

Great pie crust! But beware of the amount of liquid! In my opinion, this cannot go beyond 6 tablespoons of water. I had to add a little bit more flour to be able to handle the dough. I used 2 tablespoons of sugar instead of 1 1/2 tablespoons required. For the person who asked, I cooked the crust at 375 deg. Fahrenheit for 25 minutes in the middle of the oven.

I've tried to do pie crust rather unsuccessfully in the past, but our daughter has been craving homemade pumpkin pie since Christmas, so I tried it with this crust... I didn't freeze the vegetable shortening, and I used regular margarine, as our daughter doesn't like butter. I put foil around the edges of the crust so that it wouldn't get too brown, and took them off at the end of the cooking to a get a golden brown crust, and I did freeze the crusts in the pan before putting the pumpkin mixture in, as suggested in the pumpkin pie recipe. I also did as others suggested in rolling it out between 2 sheets of waxed paper & it was a dream to work with. This made plenty for me for 2 9-inch pie crusts. It turned out Absolutely Perfect! Thank-You.

I'm not the most experienced pastry chef, so I enlisted my husband's help with this when we used the dough for an apple pie. We rolled it out in between two sheets of floured wax paper --it was a little tricky, but tasted wonderful. Next time I might experiment with rolling the dough out on my Silpat baking mat. I kept the shortening and butter in our deep freezer overnight to ensure the fat be very cold.

This is the best pie crust recipe I've tried yet (well, it should be...it has twice the fat than my Joy of Cooking recipe). The combo of shortening and butter works great. Go ahead and use regular vinegar, it works fine. I even processed the fat into the flour with a pastry blender (a lot of work, though...use the food processor if you have one). The trick to easy pie crusts is rolling out the refridgerated disks between two sheets of plastic wrap. Then freeze the rolled out crust for 5 min. It's then very easy to remove the wrap and place it in the pie pan or on the pie top. No mess, no hassle. This recipe is rich and flaky.

I had attempted this crust previously and had problems rolling it out -- I think I found a solution though.

The flavor and flakiness of this crust was great, only it kept cracking on me when i was rolling it out. And forget about trying to roll it on the rolling pin first and then into the dish.

I guess you have to catch it in that window where the crust is still cold but elastic enough to roll out without cracking. I will try this again.

Hopefully helpfull hints: I have a few recipes with similar proportions. Flour, humidity and whether or not you presift the flour can affect amount of water needed. Start with 1 Tbsp less water. Mix by traditional hand method,cutting in fat then sprinkling on water while tossing ingredients with a fork, OR be sure to use "on-off" spurts of the food processor so as not too overwork pastry.

OH MY GOODNESS! This piecrust was FABULOUS! The best I think I've ever tasted, at home or in a restaurant. It was so flaky that it absolutely shattered when it was touched by a fork. I substituted lard for the shortening, which may have done the trick. I'll say it again: OH MY GOODNESS! :-)
