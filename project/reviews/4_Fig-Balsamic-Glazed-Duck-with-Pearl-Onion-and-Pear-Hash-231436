I didn't have the sage on hand so I made the potatoes with thyme instead. I really enjoyed the taste with the duck, however, next time will follow the recipe as written

Fab and quick Sunday dinner... Made as written with the exception of the sauce-- I used 1/3 cup regular balsamic (that was all I had left) with about 2 tbs of pomegranate molasses. I added a few sprigs of thyme and rosemary to the sauce for an added savory note. The major change was the addition of 8 fresh, quartered, ripe figs. The hash is divine and the whole meal was perfect.

Thought this was dynamite. I would only change two things: 1) I would preheat the oven to 350 or so and when you turn the breasts over in the pan, pop the skillet in the oven for 6-8 minutes to get to medium rare. 2) Found that four duck breasts was actually too much food. My wife and I are able to split one breast. The leftover hash was great tucked into an omelette the next day. Also, I used the remaining duck breast in duck ragu and got another two meals out of it. The leftovers were so good I would have served them to guests without batting an eye.

All the flavors were wonderful, I just think the execution needs refining. Sear the breasts fat side down for 8 min. at med- high. Flip them in the pan and move to pre- heated 350 degree oven for 6-8 min. When they reach desired doneness remove from pan and carry on. For the hash, I worked in steps. Potatoes in the pan first for 7-10 min., pearl onions next for another 7-10 min., and the pears for just long enough for everything to get acquainted and the pears to get hot. I will serve this to guests as soon as I refine the whole process/presentation. It was delicious.

a lovely dish. rich, a wonderful juxtaposition of flavors and the kind of dish you'd be happy to order at a good restaurant. as others have suggested, it is wise to add the pears after the potatoes begin to brown to prevent their unfortunate disintegration. additionally, one should continually remove excess fat as it is rendered, otherwise you will not achieve a nice crispy skin and cooking time will increase. one final point is that you can easily adapt this to duck legs, which my 5 year-old daughter loves. i also added slices of fresh black figs to the balsamic-broth reduction. NOM!

I was searching for figs + chicken and came up with TWO wonderful recipes! I must say that even with a boneless and skinless chicken breast it was devine! I didn't have any fig balsamic vinegar but I did have a counter full of ripe mission figs! I fried 3 strips of bacon to give me a little animal fat and flavor and carried on with the recipe. I also had only russet potatoes on hand, so I used those. The flavors came together nicely for the hash with the pears and sage. What a delicious combination! For the glaze I used unsalted chicken broth and balsamic vinegar. I had maybe 1 Tbsp. of fig jam left so I added that along with 2 chopped ripe mission figs. My husband was just delighted with the meal! I will definitely make this again. For the hash, I would cut the potatoes into smaller dice and also hope that I have firmer pears on hand. It was really an easy meal to prepare and I would not even hesitate to use dried mission figs if need be! P.S. I am SO glad that I didn't let the maid screw it up! ; )

A very simple yet yummy use of duck. I used fingerlings and small white potatoes and did sautee them with the pearl onions for a while before adding the pears. Didnt have fig vinegar but did as another cook and just added a little fig preserves to the pan. Great cold weather dish.

On cooking the duck...I heated the pan to medium high, then put the duck in, turned the heat to medium low, scooped out fat as it rendered, turned the duck breast over after 10 minutes, inserted an instant read thermometer, cooked to 125 degrees, and removed the duck. It was dinner knife tender (didn't need a steak knife) and delicious. I was afraid that I would overcook it to toughness. Phew, that didn't happen. I might try a different duck recipe before repeating this one but I could live on the hash.

Duck breast...better than turkey...less expensive than turkey...easier to cook than turkey...but too high in cholestorol to be a menu staple...goood holiday alternative...the hash is to die for...it goes on my staples list as a breakfast and dinner side...next time I'm going to make it with Idaho russets...I love Yukon Golds but they didn't brown as well as russets do...the hash is even tastier gently reheated in the microwave the next day.

This was the first time I made duck. Bot the duck and the hash were incredible. Easily a company-worth meal. One thing I would change, is I would throw the onions on a pan before the potatoes and pears and let them cook longer. Recipe was spectacular, a definite repeat!

Excellent recipe. All of the reviews were right on. To get the fat rendered and crispy, sear the duck breasts fat side down for longer than 6 min, more like 8-10 min. Then, transfer the breasts fat side up to a clean skillet that has pre heated in oven at 350...then cook for another 6-8 min until medium.

I knew this was going to be special after just reading the ingredients, and the previous reviews stating "this is the best thing I've ever eaten" are not exaggerating. The flavors here are heavenly. It is both hearty and elegant. We didn't have fig balsamic, so we used a high quality balsamic, mixed with a little bit of fig compote spread we found in the store, which worked extremely well.

Delicious recipe. The key is to make the duck skin very crisp. I use yellow onion instead.

My new favorite way to prepare duck breast. Used chopped cippolini onions instead of pearl, also removed entire skin of duck before plating. Definitely simple enough to do on a week night. Delish!

I found this recipe exceptional. The next time I make it, however, I will sear the skin side of the breast at a higher stove temperature for a minute or two longer and reduce the time for the other side to get a crispier skin. Secondly, I had been wanting to cook with celery root, so I tried that in the pear hash instead of potatoes. This made the dish. While keeping a similar texture to that of potatoes, the celery root added another warm, subtle flavor to an already lovely recipe. You must try it.

This was delicious and my boyfriend and I both loved it. Next time I will try cutting thicker slices of the pear as they disentegrated this time around. Only made two breasts-Cut down on the sage to one tbsp. but didn't change anything else.

this was fabulous. I made a few modifications (due in part to my student budget). I didn't use pearl onions but instead sliced a gold onion very thinly and sauteed. It worked out well. Second, I chopped 10 dried black mission figs and sauteed with the hash, as I didn't have fig balsamic vinegar. I actually used a pomegranate vinegar that I had on hand, and it worked *so* well. This recipe was great, and I will definitely make it again when the weather gets a bit colder.

absolutely delicious. However, I roasted the potatoes, onion, and pear, each separately in a little olive oil in a hot oven, which I think brought out the flavors more. I set it aside and then sauteed as in the recipe after cooking the duck.

My wife proclaimed this to be one of the greatest dishes she has ever tasted. I quite agree.

Absolutely bloody FANTASTIC! Super easy after a tiny bit of prep for onions and potatoes, everything from one pan! I did cook the duck a touch longer than told because we don't like there to be any redness. First time cooking duck breast fillets.... DEFINITELY not the last :) Added thawed dark sweet cherries to the sauce (saw in another recipe), panfried tiny baby 'bellas with some shallots for a side dish and Christmas was PERFECT!

my first time trying to make duck, and it was beautiful! we used magret, which is a larger breast, so one breast fed 2 of us for valentine's day. it was a little rare with the given cooking times, so i cooked a little longer. the glaze was wonderful! couldnt find fig-balsamic but i found pear-balsamic. i added some red wine and 1 tbsp butter, yummy! the hash was great too, loved the pearl onions! made me feel like a fancy french chef, even on my first try.

I really messed up the recipe for the hash but it turned out so delicious I might mess it up again on purpose. I overboiled the potatoes so when they were sauted with the pearl onions and pears it turned into more of a nicely browned mashed potato dish. But, oh my, was it good! I might do this again with just a simple rotisserie chicken from the deli and use olive oil instead of the fat from the duck to saute in.

Perhaps I shouldn't review this, as I made so many changes, but it turned out really wonderfully. I had lots of baby greens and no potatos, and shallots rather than pearl onions, and duck breast fillets without a scrap of fat rather than skin-on breasts. I followed the searing directions, tossed a cubed pear in the drippings and put it aside, threw some chopped shallot in the same pan, then made the glaze with the shallot/dripping base. Around a mound of lightly dressed baby salad greens I put the duck slices and pear, drizzled the sauce over all, and threw some toasted walnuts on top. It was gorgeous, tasted amazing, and still used all the flavors of the original. If you find yourself without a potato, I highly recommend this version.
