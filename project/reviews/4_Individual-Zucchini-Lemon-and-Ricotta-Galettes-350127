It is a little fiddly making the pastry parcels, but we enjoy this very much and have made it several times. I did not make any changes to the recipe

Heck, yeah, I'd make these again! They were worth every utensil and pot I had to wash. Quiche-haters shouldn't be put off by the description saying they're similar to quiches; they're not really. I used cottage cheese instead of ricotta and also made the infamous vodka crust from CI because it is always tender. I also divided the dough into 6 balls and rolled each one into a circle. This was much less of a hassle and didn't leave any leftover dough scraps.

Bright and delicious! They took a long time to make, but were worth it. The only substitution I made was cottage cheese for ricotta (I'm a texture person and ricotta gives me the creeps). I had some issues managing to get three shells out of one rolled out piece of dough, so would probably start out with 6 balls next time, or even better, be lazy and just make a full size pie (or two, depending on how shallow of a pie plate I used).

Surpassed expectations! I made these crustless... and with part-skim ricotta. They are delicious! do not ignore these! The lemon makes these sparkle... and they taste good at room temperature, chilled, or warm. I wish I had one right now.

Delicious. I used a lemon pie crust instead of the one in the recipe, but I'm looking forward to trying that one out as well. My husband and I loved the taste of the lemon- zucchini-ricotta filling and the presentation as individual tartlets looked amazing. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was refreshing and delicious. I made the following adjustments, based on what I had on hand. I didn't have enough ricotta cheese, so I subbed in about 1/2 cup of non-fat plain greek yogurt, about 1/4 cup of cream cheese and a splash of 1/2 and 1/2. I added in about 2 T of fresh chopped basil right before filling the galettes. Also, I used a premade double regular pie crust and just made two large galettes that I cooked for the 15 minutes on 425 and then 15 minutes on 375. I didn't add the second batch of parmesan until after I turned the oven down to 375 (because I forgot) and I completely forgot to add fleur de sel (or the kosher salt I was going to use). I'm very much looking forward to my leftover lunch today!

I made the filling as written, but then I folded it into a ready-made Pillsbury dough crust. It turned out fine - yummy, actually. Sprinkled with freshly chopped parsley!

Tasty and relatively easy. I made smaller, 4" versions for hors d'oeuvres. Just remember to make extra dough.

This recipe was delicious! Made it exactly as written (with the exception of using Kosher salt to sprinkle over the top as I didn't have Fleur de sel.) As soon as they popped out of the oven I wrapped them in tin foil and took them to a concert in the park. They were perfect and portable. Even my toddler loved it.

These were great! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I did not cut out dough rounds as described. Instead, I divided the dough into six portions, then rolled out each portion on top of a piece of parchment paper to a 6 inch round. After forming each galette, I cut around it and transferred the galette (on its own small piece of parchment paper) to a baking sheet. I have had disasters with similar recipes sticking to the countertop in the past, but the parchment paper made this one much easier. The flavor of these was outstanding. There were a lot of steps, but they were delicious and made great leftovers. I took a few in a picnic lunch, and they were even good cold!

Rather than use zucchini, I used portabella mushrooms, roasted bell peppers and caramelized onions... yum. I got raves from my guests and loved the presentation.

This was a great recipe. Period. I added a little more lemon then stated, which I like more because I really like lemon

these were the hit of my dinner party! i followed the recipe exactly. i was a bit concerned about making these as i never had made tarts, galettes, or such....but they turned out well and looked great. i will be making these again very soon.

I served these as an hors d'oeuvre recently. I made a half recipe and used Pillsbury pie crust to make three galettes. I put a layer of finely chopped ham in the center before adding the ricotta/zucchini filling. Cut into six wedges per galette. Great way to use up more of my frozen zucchini from last summer.

I made these for a party a few months ago. Everyone loved them and is asking when I'll make them again. Also I had a few leftover, reheated them in the oven and they were delicious the next day as well.

I really liked the filling, though I did add a bit more lemon then the recipe called for. The crust I was not a huge fan of so next time I will use my tried and true crust recipe.

Used a store-bought "rustico" crust, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. so good i ate it for 3 meals in a row. not kidding.

Though these take a while to make, it is really worth the time. The crust was exceptionaly buttery and flaky. Only changes I made... I folded them over like small calzones and I left out the egg. This just became part of my permanant collection.

Used Pillsbury premade pie crusts and got 6 svgs from one 2 crust pkg. And it was FAB!! Lemon flavor prominent, but the tenderness of filling, even with lo-ricotta, was most impressive. Room for pretty garnishes - flat parsley and edible nastursiums. (part of a four- course all zucch menu). Can make ahead.

Great use of the summer Zuch- My husband hates eggs so I thought this would be a good with only one for the entire batch. He liked it but couldn't believe there was only one egg... the constency is eggy... but this was quite good

These were really good, was in a hurry when rolling out the dough but totally worked, rolled 3 put on baking sheet with silpat added filling and closed them then rolled out the last 3 and added them to the same baking sheet so only needed 1 baking sheet. Everyone loved these going to make them again and try to make them bite size for apps

The lemon juice and peel really make this recipe delicious! I did not have too much time so I used an organic whole wheat pie shell and turned out great. I reduced the salt and did not add any into the ricotta mixture. As I am a garlic and lemon lover, I used 3 garlic cloves and peel from a whole lemon. Also added more black pepper and for me, the final taste was really balanced. I did not have parmesan cheese at home and substituted for pecorino romano. I will definitely make it again!

Excellent! I had to use what I had on hand - cottage chesse for the ricotta and no lemon zest. It was fantastic. I personally liked the tang the lemon juice gave off, although if I had added the zest it may have been overwhelming for my families taste. The parmesean and lemon balance each other nicely. Crust was especially yummy. I only got 5 6" circles from the dough and used a scant 1/2 cup of filling for each. Instead of pleating the dough, I pinched it every 1/2" and they looked pretty - like yummy little suns :)

I made this for dinner tonight and was very impressed. It was a dinner just for two people, so cut it in half and the recipe made enough pastry for 3, and enough filling to still have leftovers to fill in ravioli or in chicken thighs for tomorrow night. The only variations I made was using pastry flour for the crust (I like pastry really flaky and use it all the time, way better than AP flour). It was a nice light spring-flavoured dinner, served with roasted eggplant, peppers and cherry tomatoes. I especially liked the light lemon flavour and the light, quiche-like texture. Will definitely make again.

Very good, kind of like quiche. Crust was delicious. For the filling I think I would have preferred less lemon though.

These were delicious, very tasty I had enough dough left over to make a 7th and the the filling was also enough to make a 7th. The crust was buttery and flaky. There were 4 of us so I thought I'll eat one and the others can have 2 each (thinking they looked small) but actually they spread out to a nice size and the filling fills 7 perfectly so 3 of us had one each and my brotherinlaw ate 4! I will definitely make again and often, couldn't really taste the zucchini- will also try using asparagus and mushrooms. We just had a BBQ steak on the side and everyone was full

So good! But they took forever to make, so plan ahead. Also, a perfect lunch with a green salad. But they're really more meal-size than appetizer-size--they do expand in the oven.

I made this as one galette, served in slices, and subbed gruyere for parmesean (just what I had on hand). I thought it was a lovely, lighter, dinner with great flavors. I would definitely make again and would do the individual version for a dinner party.

These were great. The zucchini mixture was really tangy and bright.

I thought these were excellent! I used store-bought Pillsbury pie dough but followed the filling recipe exactly. I might add more parmesan and less lemon next time. They are good warm or room temperature. Mine came out beautifully just like the picture and were delicious!

In an effort to use up that garden zucchini, I was excited to make these little tartlets and they turned out to be a delicious way to get rid of this summer's harvest - however, my galettes didn't turn out as pretty as the picture, having flattened significantly during the baking process. I'll make them again, but next time I'll try putting them in XL muffin cups to see if they'll retain their pretty, pre- baked shape better.

I was all excited to try out this recipe, and after I got started, realized, my zucchinis were not so good. But being undetered, I subbed them for shredded potatoes and sauted baby bellas and it turned out great. I omitted the lemon, but used the crust recipe which turned out very nice and crispy, I did not par bake them either. I prepared everything else as is and baked about 30 minutes.
