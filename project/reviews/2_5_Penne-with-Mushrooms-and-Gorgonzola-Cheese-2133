I missed the sauce...I had to add milk and margarine to make a sauce. I love blue cheese, and I don't think this had the flavor of the Roquefort I added. It was certainly edible, but it needs to be tweaked before I'll make it again.

Since I once had a memorable dish in Italy of zucchini, gnocchi and gorgonzola sauce, I added one medium zucchini, sliced and quartered into 1/4" chunks to the tomato and mushroom sauté. I used lots of gorgonzola, and added it back to the pasta pot along with the drained pasta and a small bit of pasta water (taken before draining). I stirred both over low heat for a minute or two until the cheese melted into a sauce. I then put the pasta in a serving bowl and spooned veggie mixture on top. It was amazingly tangy and flavorful, and very light in spite of all that cheese! I'd definitely do this again.

A quick weeknight dish. I actually added more gorgonzola cheese as I loved the flavors of the cheese, mushrooms and tomatoes together.

An easy weeknight dish.

An easy, week-night pasta that tastes much more complex than it is. I used well-drained canned tomatoes instead of fresh because that's what I had and threw in a handful of beet greens I had to use up (just sauteed them with the mushrooms for about a minute before adding the tomatoes). Maybe that helped balance the cheese. Our gorgonzola wasn't very strong, so I mixed some in with the pasta and sprinkled some on top. Yum!

Quick, easy, tasty - all the things I look for in a weeknight meal. I used a full pound of mushrooms and doubled the garlic. Other reviewers found the Gorgonzola flavor overwhelming, but I actually thought it was very subtle. As a Gorgonzola lover, I might increase the amount next time. I tossed it with the pasta instead of sprinkling it on top to spread the flavor throughout. I'd definitely make this again.

We love gorgonzola cheese and this one was a hit. I've made this several times, cooked some shrimp with it and also tried it with chicken, the better flavor being with shrimp,making a fabulous entree. If you're not sure about the gorgonzola, serve it on the side as I did with my two kids.

My family loved this! I went a little easier on the gorgonzola, as some other cooks suggested, and also used 1 whole carmelized onion with it, which added depth and the sweetness kept the cheese from overpowering everything else. Will definitely make again.

When the other reviewers said the gorgonzola was a little much, I assumed that, as a lover of the cheese, it would be fine for me. I was most assuredly wrong. The flavor of the gorgonzola drowned out all of the other flavors and was completely overwhelming. And, that was with double the mushrooms and grilled chicken thrown in! I would definitely suggest cutting the amount of gorgonzola in half or perhaps using another cheese entirely.

We loved this dish, but I would definitely recommend it for blue cheese lovers only. To make this a heartier meal, I followed the advice of one of the other reviewers by doubling the amount of mushrooms. I also added some skinless, boneless, chicken breast that I cut into small pieces and cooked with the mushrooms, and, due to the poor quality of fresh tomatoes now, I replaced the plum tomatoes with canned.

Gorgonzola cheese is also not my favorite, but somehow it works in this recipe. I think next time I'll use a whole pound of mushrooms--there didn't seem to be enough veggies to cover all the pasta. Otherwise, it's easy and very tasty.

I'm sure the fresh ingredients in this recipe would be better in the summer. Tomatoes are not at their prime now, nor are the herbs. We discovered that gorgonzola is not our favorite cheese. When I make it again, I will use a sharp romano and some provolone or mozarella.
