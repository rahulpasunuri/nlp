So, I love this recipe (it's been my go-to spontaneous dinner party recipe for almost a year), but I have to say, that I've never got it quite right. Either I forget to butter/flour the pan before I put down by pizza dough, or I forget the salt and pepper, or I overcook the potatoes...I don't think I've ever carried this recipe out flawlessly before. So word of warning: don't oversimplify this recipe in your mind! I tend to think of the few things I need (potatoes, dough, cream, thyme) and then throw it all together without much thought. Mistake. But still yummy.

This is a GREAT recipe. I did make some changes though. I used rosemary instead of thyme (just because I had some) and added caramelized onions. The caramelized onions were my favorite part, so I definitely recommend adding those. The pizza was a little dry overall, so I might try adding the creme fraiche a few minutes into the cooking time when I make this again. This is one of my new favorite pizza recipes!

Super easy and divine!

Very good, but next time would use less creme fraiche and more herbs.

Pizza is a weeknight staple at our house (when made with dough from our local bakery) and this is GREAT one. The tangy, rich creme fraiche is wonderful with the potatoes. I did not peel the potatoes and parcooked them whole in the microwave with a touch of water to steam them. The potatoes turned out nicely browned and it was a great combination of flavors.

the entire instructions are "make the dough." not very helpful.

Delicious! I made 3 different pizzas and this one was the favorite. I made a few changes -- used rosemary instead of thyme and substituted a mixture of fresh goat cheese and milk (stirred to a smooth consistency) for the heavy cream. Will definitely be making this again.

One note about this recipe: if you want to make smaller, individual pizzas on a cookie sheet (i.e. not fill up a whole pan as described), make sure to build up the crust of each pizza so that the cream does not flow onto the pan.

This was really delicious and a big hit with guests. I served 3 different kinds of pizza at a party and this recipe provided great variety.

What a nice variation from the typical pizza! The pizza not only tasted great but looked great, too. I used russets, as they were what I had on hand, and parboiled them for 7 to 8 minutes before slicing. I also used creme fraiche instead of the heavy cream. All in all, a tasty and unique pizza.

I have not made this pizza, but I have a suggestion for those who are enticed by the flavor of a potato pizza; the Provencal Potato Pizza recipe found in Annie Somerville's Fields of Greens cookbook is EXCELLENT! I've made it several times and it's always very delicious and satisfying. Here is a link to the recipe: http://www.potatohelp.com/textonly/recipes/recipes.asp?RecipeID=180 Try it, as well any recipe found in Fields of Greens.

This recipe is just as good as the potato pizza I get after a night of drinking with my pal Anna in Toronto. If you are a pizza fan, TRY IT you'll LOVE IT! PS- it's really good with rosemary instead of thyme.

Absolutely amazing! I added caramelized onions, bacon, and a sprinkling of romano cheese to this pizza...yummy!! I ended up using whipping cream instead of creme fraiche, which gave the pizza a certain flavor and flair that I had never experienced. Will most definitely make again and again!

This is very nice! I am a great fan of the spud -- as well as garlic and good bread and olive oil and thyme and kosher salt. Some of my favorite foods are in this delicious pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I will make it again and again. It is comfort food at its finest.

I had this at a friend's house tonight and put it in my recipe box as soon as I got home. It is like scalloped potatoes on bread. Fabulous! I plan to make it for an appetizer at a dinner party this weekend.
