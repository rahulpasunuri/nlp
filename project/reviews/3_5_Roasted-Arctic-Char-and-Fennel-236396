Crushed fennel seeds using mortar and pestle and sprinkled over fennel before roasting along with a shallot, finely chopped. Roasted the fennel ten minutes longer before adding the char to roast. AWESOME, and four stars with this variation. Served with brown rice and arugula salad.

Super tasty! My variation notes: used sweet clementines. Sectioned, unpeeled; squeezed a bit of juice in the oil and fennel before roasting, and left the squeezed sections in the roasting pan. Added scallions and dried chives before roasting fish. Used a good amount of salt and pretty heavy pepper. I think I may add a 1/4 cup of white wine next time before roasting fish.

This was very good and quite easy. My husband would have given it three stars but I felt it lacked oomph. Im confused about the directions that tell you to quarter the fennel bulb lengthwise and then also slice it lengthwise -- what size pieces are we aiming for? the orange flavor was a very interesting twist. After trying it according to the recipe I then took a reviewers suggestion to toss orange segments with the fennel and found this improved it a lot. I would make it again upping the salt and orange ingredients.

Very easy recipe. A frequent offering in our house. Works just as well with salmon, halibut or haddock.

Quick and easy. The squeezed orange is lovely.

I love this recipe because arctic char is a highly sustainable fish. Made it a few times and found that adding some shallot to the fennel is great. We also add quite a bit of fresh pepper to the fennel and it gives it a great spicy kick.i think the fennel requires longer to cook than suggested (and even then is sometimes too crunch), but the fish comes out perfect.

This is so easy and attractive and delicious. I add some sliced carrots to fennel. You can cook the vegetables ahead of time and then hold at room temp and cook the fish when guests arrive.

easy and good. one simple step makes it delicious: peel and section the orange and toss the segments with the cooked fennel. it's much more delicious (and attractive) than squeezing the juice over, as the recipe suggests.
