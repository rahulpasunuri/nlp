This was delicious. I used large sea salt flakes - about half what the recipe asked for. Since I couldn't find Harissa or Aleppo, I used Tapatio - which I was afraid to try, but it turned out delicious! I served artichokes with lemon garlic butter (w S & P) and rosemary bread I made in the bread machine. The shiraz was a great paring!

This was an amazing dish that got rave reviews from the group. We butterflied the lamb instead and did it on the grill. Wow!

Absolutely delicious. A bit salty as the other reviews suggested. We would consider using only 1 Tbsp instead of the 3 called for. Overall though, it is a wonderful dish and we highly recommend it.

I would like to thank the previous reviewers for their helpful info. I made this recipe last night, and used ZERO SALT in the rub. It was great! Spicy and exotic. This recipe goes into my "use frequently" file.

wasted a whole leg of lamb,following the mad instruction "3 tablespoons of salt" dont ever make this unless you are from the no salt planet

My husband made this for a dinner party and the kitchen smelled unbelievable! The only problem is the amount of salt in the rub. I'd cut it in half next time or even 2/3. Maybe then it would be a 4 forker!
