I have made this dish numerous times and it is consistently delish. I make it according to directions (I feel like the only one on these reviews who does!). I especially like the game hens on the grill; if you turn them every 7 1/2 minutes for 25 minutes they turn out perfect. The salad is tasty, but I am not a huge fan of hickory smoked almonds, so I may substitute slivered next time.

I was the VIP in the posting below by byhookorcook and she is being somewhat harsh on herself... It was all rather scrumptious!

I cooked this dish for a VIP because it seemed like a quick exotic meal. Rather it was a "plain Jane" boring dish. Nothing was succulent or "ooh ahh." The chicken (oh, sorry, "game hen" ) was most disappointing because it lacked a distinctive taste. If you're trying to impress, keep on looking, this won't do it.

I, too, found that this recipe exceeded expectations. The seasonings on the hens were perfect, and the salad is my new favorite way to use leafy greens. I substituted spinach for the arugula, as I had spinach on hand from my CSA box. I can't wait to share this recipe with friends and family!

Hot off the grill, sans the salad, this was a great way to grill cornish hens. Spices were spot on. Everyone loved them.

This is an excellent recipe. It turned out beyond my expectations. I used spinach for the aruglua. It is a nice light summer dish. Serve it with bread, if desired, and it's a meal.

Just simply delicious. I did substitute spinach for arugula for convenience, and it was fine. Also, I did half the recipe to serve 4. I would make this for company in a heartbeat.
