This muffin is somewhat dry and lacks sweetness and flavor, with the neutral flavors of the wheat and bran predominating. The main sweetness comes from the figs and pecans and without them the muffin is tastless. Not worth the effort and overall a waste of time and ingredients.

Flavors are good but muffins came out quite dry...the Buttermilk Bran Muffin recipe from this site is much better.

...Also, I used large size muffin tin and made just 6 of them.

This is a great recipe. So easy and good results. Love the subtle lemon and cinnamon flavor. I really like the slight crunchiness from the fig seeds (similar to poppy seeds). I used 1 cup WW flour and just 1/2 cup AP flour. This will be a regular for me. Looking forward to making it with different add-ins like dried cherries or apricots and dates.

Solid recipe, good results. Used only 1/4 cup sugar, since figs add considerable sweetness.

Unlike most Epicurious reviewers these days, I actually followed the recipe! LOL. Delicious. Moist, cake like texture. The figs and lemon zest make them special. I made 6 jumbo muffins and baked for the suggested 18 minutes and they were perfect.

Excellent! Nice, filling & tasty.

I think this is a great base. I made them with apples and walnuts. I also used 1 cup of ww flour and they still turned out nicely. And they freeze well so they can be pulled out for an easy morning or afternoon snack.

I think this recipe is great and a great base for other ingredients, if you don't like figs and/or pecans. I didn't find them too salty or too sweet. I did cut back ever so slightly on the salt, due a previous comment, but I think as long as you mix your dry ingredients properly, you won't find them salty. Love the lemon zest!

This is my go to muffin recipe I've been making for 3 years. I follow the directions as written, except maybe add a little more lemon zest and cinnamon. I toast the pecans before adding to the mix. These are delicious and everybody raves. They freeze great. My favorite.

i always tend to find baking too sweet, especially muffins, however this recipe was just about right. i only left out a bit of the sugar, and found them perfect. great healthy snack that my husband even loved.

Really delicious recipe. Great straight out of the oven! I halved the recipe as we never need 12 muffins in a house with two people. I also substituted coconut oil for the oil and oats milk yoghurt for the buttermilk, as I can't do vegetable oil or buttermilk. Yummy!

Followed recipe exactly. Tasted salty. Would not make again.

Nice Recipe. It is excellent as is. I made a couple of variations to suit my tastes. I subbed half of the AP flour with ground flax and subbed cranberries for figs. This will be a staple recipe for me. Thanks.

These were spectacular! I had to double the recipe because I put in too much baking soda by accident, and made some minor modifications at the same time. I used 2 and a half cups of whole wheat flour and half a cup of all purpose flour (as oppsed to 2 cups all purpose, 1 cup wheat), used unsweetened applesauce instead of the oil, and used three whole eggs and one egg white instead of four eggs. I also used cranberries and chopped walnuts because I didn't have figs and pecans, and the muffins came out fluffy, moist, flavorful, and filling. This is definitely my new go-to muffin recipe!

Used this recipe to make about 35 small muffins -- and it turned out great. I made the following substitutions: 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup oat bran, 1/4 all purpose flour, 1/4 cup coarse wheat bran. I used 1/4 splenda brown sugar instead of the regular brown sugar, and used carrots and raisins instead of figs and pecans... I also used apple sauce instead of oil and non-fat plain yogurt instead of buttermilk. Very hearty, filling mini-muffins!

Encouraged by other commenters, I made some substitutions to make it lower in fat and calories, but thought that the end product was great. Here's what I substituted: 1/2 cup applesauce and 1 cup plain yogurt for the oil and buttermilk, I omitted the lemon peel, pecans and figs, but used 1 cup of baking raisins instead, and substituted 1/4 cup Splenda brown sugar for the regular. I made it into 12 very good sized muffins. It's a keeper. Sorry the last person had problems.

Maybe my expectations were too high because of all the positive reviews. I followed the recipe exactly. Maybe they're better fresh out of the oven. I ate my first muffin the next day and decided this recipe was not worth making again.

I was forced to make a couple of substitutions that worked out very well: currents for the dates and butter for the oil. Otherwise, I adhered to the recipe and we loved the results - delicious and substantial, but not overly-heavy, muffins. I will definitely put these in the regular rotation!

I substitute blueberries for the pecans and figs and our entire family (including our toddler) love these muffins! I have to make them weekly.

I love these muffins although I always play around with the recipe a bit. I usually reduce the white flour and substitute an equal amount with flax meal/wheat germ/ additional oat or wheat bran. I interchange fat free yogurt with buttermilk and I will also leave out the oil and add a little bit of applesauce. I also like to add some dark chocolate which always goes well with the dried fruit. If I don't have figs, I just use raisins.

This recipe is great, also very easy to make lighter and more fiberful. I used 1/4c APflour, 3/4c toasted oat bran, 1c ww flour, 3T oil, 1T water, 1 whole egg, 2 egg whites, 1/4c splenda brand brown sugar, 2T molasses, FF buttermilk instead of reduced, and raisins instead of the figs, and it came out great! the smell in the house was amazing!

I had to modify this based on what I had on hand. I used regular flour, oat bran, raisins and groud hazelnuts. I probably added a bit more cinnamon and lemon zest. These were great! Not very sweet and a great snack.

I was looking for a way to use up some buttermilk & found this. Only had unbleached flour, no figs, so used dates & raisins. Otherwise, by the book. They came out great & drizzled some honey over the top - thanks to a reviewer! They are great sliced with a little butter or sharp cheese.

Another fantastic recipe! I only substituted the buttermilk with vanilla flavored soy milk and they came out absolutely yummy and moist. I did not use pecans and figs the second time I made these. I used walnuts and golden raisins, and still a winner of a muffin! If you get some honey and drizzle over the top while they are still warm, it is even better, but you are adding calories if you do so. Healthy, wholesome, and a bit of sweet too...a really great muffin recipe. You must try it!

I forgot to mention that I also added some ground Flax seeds to my all whole wheat version of this recipe. Also tried with dates as someone else mentioned and they were just as good.

Used all whole wheat flour in this recipe and it turned out great. Not sure if I like the crunchiness of the seeds in the figs but overall it tasted quite good.

This was an okay muffin but not the best bran muffin I have ever had. I was a little disappointed after seeing the positive fork ratings - maybe I expected too much. I found this muffin to be too cake-like for my liking.

Found these to be delicious! Will now be one of my favorite muffin recipes. Used applesauce for the oil and they came out beautifully.

I make these as 2-bite muffins for my 13-month-old daughter. She loves them, and I love giving her something a little sweet that's also good for her.

Terrific and easy, even with dates as a sub for figs. Cooked in convection, in a large 6-muffin tin. Perfect. Fine as is, or eat warm with a little butter and honey.

I don't know why I buy muffins at work when these are easy to make and much better tasting!
