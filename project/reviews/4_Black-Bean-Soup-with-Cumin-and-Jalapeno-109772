Yum! Made this soup as a side dish. I thought it might be too easy to taste complex & dinner worthy; but this is one of those quick, easy & simply delicious recipes that surprises. I will be adding this one into the rotation.

Nice start - used dried beans and prepped according to package instructions. Also subbed celery for carrots. Added red wine vinegar and reduced w/onion + garlic. Doubled peppers. Added smoked paprika, ancho chili powder as well. Also at the very end added spicey sausage to make it very hearty. With these few changes it's a keeper!

This is a keeper. If you are a fan of black beans then this is for you. Pureeing part of the soup is critical to give it body and texture. Warms up wonderfully so I would double the recipe for leftovers. Also goes great topped with sharp cheddar, green onions and sour cream

very good, easy, and quick. I substituted chicken broth for Imagine Vegetable broth - I don't want animal products. I also added a pinch of chili powder, half a teaspoon of cinnamon (trust me), two pinches of cayenne. These make the flavor a little fuller, which may be necessary when using veggie stock instead of chicken.

Loved this soup! I also added an entire jalapeno as we like spice. I really think the feta and cilantro (avocado, too) put this soup over the top. Making it a second time in less that a week!

This was delicious. I used Better Than Bouillon vegetarian chicken stock and a very large onion. Feta cheese added a different flavor, but the soup without it was very flavorful. This was my first time making black bean soup and it came out great, so I would say its pretty easy.

This was a hit with my whole family, too! Easy and delicious! I doubled the recipe, using 1 can of diced tomatoes $ 2 cans of Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chiles, then left out the jalapeno. I only needed 2 cups of chicken stock due to the extra liquid in the Ro-Tels. It was perfectly seasoned, needing no extra salt and pepper. I did dice up about 6 strips of bacon &used the bacon fat to saute the veggies. Then, used the bacon bits as a garnish along with the cilantro, green onions & feta. A real keeper!

This was really really good. Simple to make and truly delightful in flavor. I am already planning on making it again. I will add more heat as one jalapeno was not enough for me. Double up the recipe - you will want to make it again soon!

I don't usually take the time to leave reviews but for such a simple, fast dish, this was fantastic! Used leftover dried beans that I had previously frozen, used a 28oz can of tomatoes, 2 carrots and used an entire jalapeno since we like spice. Topped with avocado, cilantro and feta--looks beautiful (unlike some black bean soups) and was delicious.

This may not have gotten 4 forks if I hadn't modified it. I only changed one thing. I started by browning 1/2 lb of chopped Nueske's bacon and rendered out the fat, then removed the bacon with a slotted spoon. Instead of sauteing in olive oil, I used the bacon fat to soften the veggies. Then I added the bacon in after the soup was finished. The bacon added a subtle smoky flavor. Everything is better with bacon!

I used dried black beans because I had them. Soaked beans overnight, cooked with a little salt, kept the bean broth for the soup. Awesome taste! I will make it again.

Yum yum yum yum yum! I topped with feta, avocado, cilantro, and a little lime. I also made it super thick and served with rice. Two large jalapenos made this extra spicy (yea!). I did have a mishap where I only picked up one can of black beans, so I subbed with the only canned beans I had on hand - great white northern. It seemed to work out just fine, but I would stick to the original in the future...ahem...and plan better at the grocery store. I guess the only other thing I did different was use chipotle spiced small diced tomatoes. I think it gave it a nice kick. The verdict is this recipe results in a satisfying, wonderful meal. Now the wheels are turning...could be good with some greens thrown in too (spinach or chard).

I used dry black beans which I cooked the night before. Also I did not have jalapeno on hand, so I used 1 tsp of hot red chili flakes. The soup turned out wonderfully. I served it with a dollop of plain yogurt, and plain nacho chips on the side. Next time I might add some fresh corn as well.

Rating: 3
The first time I made this soup, I was super impressed with how easy it was to prepare, but a little underwhelmed with the taste... maybe because I was hoping for a spicy black bean soup. Also, it just tasted a little too much like the can... The second time I made it I upped the jalapeno to 1 large and added a diced chipotle pepper and about 1 tsp of adobo sauce. This time it was delicious (but still super easy). The smokiness of the chipotle goes really well with the soup, so I would definitely add that (or sub for the jalapeno if you're spice-averse). The feta cheese really upped the flavor of this soup and added a welcome creaminess to my spiced up version- definitely do not skip it.

Rating: 4
Excellent as is. I made white rice as well to bulk it up for an entree. Perfect for a quick, satisfying meal. My only recommendation is to double the portion!

Rating: 4
Yum! I was surprisingly impressed by this soup based off how simple the ingredients are. I probably used double the jalapeno and it wasn't too spicy. In fact, I'll probably use even more next time, 1-2 teaspoons seems too little to me. I also added cilantro to the soup, rather than a topping garnish as it was peaking its last day. Makes for a great lunch leftover.

Great recipe. I also added cooked quinoa to make it a full balanced meal. The feta and cilantro is a must to round out the flavours.

Wonderful depth of flavor from a quick and easy recipe. Perfect for a cold weeknight. This is a easy pantry staple recipe. No substitutions or additions needed. I've even used a can of diced chilis as a substitue for fresh jalapeno when I was too lazy to go to the store. I also like to top w/ chopped avocado because why not.

Great recipe - I used 1 lb of dried beans that i soaked overnight instead of the canned. I read that if you cook a peeled potato with the beans, it removes a lot of what causes gas so I did that. DO NOT EAT THE POTATO. At least that was the advise that I read on the internet. Also I substituted 3 whole fresh tomatoes instead of the canned. I also upped the quantity of the other veggies since I had more beans. Really delicious. Great recipe and would definitely make again.

I was skeptical that a recipe this easy and with this few ingredients would be that good, but it IS. I made it exactly as shown, except I removed the ribs and seeds from only half of the jalapeno, chopped it all, and put it all in-- perfect! This soup is going to become a staple in our house. It's quick enough to put together on a weeknight and healthy to boot! Love it!!

Yum! Hearty without being heavy. The only substitution I made was to use chipotle chiles in adobo sauce (I had some leftover in the fridge) instead of jalapeno.

As the recipe stands, this is an okay soup. We vamped it up a little and it was great. We used fresh tomatoes as they are gorgeous at the moment, added curry powder & paprika, tobasco and doubled the chillies. Rather than feta, we served it with dollops of labaneh, the Arabic version of sour cream. If you prefer milder flavours then the printed recipe will probably work for you. However, if you like a kick to your food, make sure you taste before you serve.

The whole family loves this soup. First time I made as directed other than substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth (we're vegetarians).

As all the reviewers said, this recipe was so simple and excellent! I've never been a huge fan of black bean soup but thought I'd give it a try. I put in a whole jalapeno and would have used more next time because we like a lot of kick. I also skipped the feta but topped it off with sour cream.

this soup is FANTASTIC! its so rich and hearty. its got tons of flavor layers. I ended up using dried beans... did an over night soak first, but the beans were still a bit firm. I set it on low heat and went off to a 4 hour rehearsal. I came back and my whole apartment smelled delicious! perfect for a cold winter day. Pureed the soup and added a dollop of sour cream to my serving to cut the heat of the jalapenos! definitely making this one again! oh! I served this with roasted sweet potato skins (just butter salt and pepper broiled for 10 mins or so) the sweet went great with the spicy!

One of the easiest and best recipes ever! I used what I had in my cupboard to make it. No carrots. But I used some mild fire roasted chiles instead of jalapeños and vegetable bouillon instead of chicken stock. I added the fresh cilantro to the soup before I pureed it and it was the best idea. So tasty and healthy!!

Healthy, fast and easy; I will make this again for sure!

Delicious and so simple! It was so good, I even use it now as a starter to make Chili, just add the ground beef and some chili spices... The recipe is very versatile, I cooked it on a late evening without wanting to go grocery shopping...so I used stuff I had in the pantry...3 different canned beans (kidney, white canneloni and baked beans), a jar of Trader Joes salsa, and doubled the jalano, spicy but delicious!

What can I say? I saw a quick and easy recipe and didn't really expect much from it. Although, when I tasted it I was completely blown away.

My husband and I love this soup! It is quick to make and freezes well. I usually serve it with tortilla chips, but have stretched the last portion over brown rice. I've had good results using leeks or scallions for the onion, plain or fire-roasted tomatoes and more jalapeno. The first time I made it, I misread the amount and put in a whole jalapeno. It was spicy, but that is how I've continued to make it. We've tried other toppings, but the cilantro and feta are perfect. I cannot put it better than the reviewer from Florence, Italy who declared it "more than the sum of its parts".

This is really easy to make. And it's pretty good. Next time I make it, I'll start with a little bacon in the pan. It doesn't need much. I also used canned chopped jalapenos just to make things easier. Tasted just fine! I would recommend using Queso Seco instead of feta. Feta is good... but queso seco would be more appropriate!

This was delicous. I made the soup as directed excpet I din't put the cilantro, or feta cheese on top. {I will top it with cilantro next time I make it, I had no cilantro on hand this time. I love celantro and I'm sure it will be a great addition to this dish.}I served this along with some rice. The addition of diced tomatoes in this version of black bean soup really adds a lot to the dish I will make it this way from now on. This dish is very aromatic and wholesome,healthy, and also economical to make.

Just finished making this soup. Because jalapenos have become milder over the years, I added 1 chopped serrano instead. I love spicy, but it may have been a bit too much. Haven't had the chance to taste it yet, but it smells delish! A note of caution for those w/ breathing difficulties, do not grind remaining serranos if more than a couple of bits, in the disposal. Even w/ the water running, the capsacin aerosolized and I inhaled it - BAD NEWS! Will try next time as written.

This is a great recipe! Only change I made was draining the black beans (I was under the impression that it's not good to use that liquid). Also used fire-roasted diced tomatoes w/garlic and increased the amount of jalapeno for spice. Pureed only half to keep some texture. The feta was surprisingly nice with the soup - delicious!

Very quick. After a long day in nursing school, I have to feed my family. In this economy, and as a poor nursing student, we always have on hand frugal black beans, both canned and dried. I substituted Kuner's of Colorado black beans with jalapeno and I also used Hunt's Fire roasted tomatoes with garlic instead of plain chopped tomatoes. Borrowing an Indian technique, I roasted cumin seeds in the bottom of a cast iron dutch oven with the olive oil, onions and garlic before adding the beans and stock. Quick and good.

I can't add too much to what other reviewers have said - this is a workhouse recipe in my kitchen because almost everyone likes it.

This soup was surprisingly good and easy to make, though i did add shredded chicken and wild rice to make it more substantial. I browned a whole chicken breast in olive oil and butter, shredded it and added it back in during the last 15 minutes of cook time. In the remaining butter / olive oil from the chicken I heated 1 cup of wild rice for about 4 minutes on low heat and then added 1 1/2 c. chicken broth. I let the rice cook, covered for 30 minutes -- until all liquid was absorbed. the rice was still undercooked, but I added an additional 1 1/2 c. broth to the carrot / onion mixture in anticipation of the undercooked rice. I added the additional rice (along with the shredded chicken) during the last 15 minutes of cooking to finish the rice cooking. I also garnished with a squeeze of fresh lime juice.

This soup was surprisingly easy and good -- though i did add shredded chicken and wild rice to make it more substantial. First, i browned two chicken breasts in butter and olive oil. Once cooked I let the chicken cool and shredded it to add later. In the butter / oil that was left in the pan i sautted 1 cup of wild rice for about 4 minutes over low heat, added 1 1/2 c. of chicken broth and let simmer for about 30 minutes until all liquid was absorbed (it was not entirely cooked). I then increased the chicken broth added to the carrot /onion mixture to 3 cups and during the last 15 minutes of cooking time I added the shredded chicken and the wild rice (the extra broth was absorbed by the rice). I did not puree, as I prefer a chunkier soup. I also garnished with a squeeze of lime juice.

I thought this was a great recipe, save for the fact that I deviated from it from the start. It was pretty much only due to necessity as I didn't have all the ingredients right off the bat, so I improvised. Firstly, I used a bag of Goya dried black beans instead of the canned variety that was recommeded. Then, I swapped the diced tomatoes for a can of traditional style Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and green chilies. Since the Ro- Tel has green chilies in it, I left out the jalapeño peppers for fear it would be too spicy. I also substituted organic beef broth for the recommended chicken broth. I thought it was really delicious. My girlfriend wouldn't stop raving to me about how good she thought it was. The chopped cilantro and the feta cheese really are exceptional garnishes and balance the flavor of the soup out well, giving it a very 'fresh' sense to its texture and flavor.

We just made this and it was really yummy. I changed a few things, I added more cumin, some chili powder and tobasco sauce. I also used cheddar instead of feta because feta is so expensive right now. I baked some corn tortillas in the oven until they got crispy and we used them to dip in the soup.

This was a fantastic, hearty, healthy and easy soup! I did make a few minimal changes: I didn't have a carrot - so I omitted it. I used 1 whole jalapeno, seeds and all. I added fresh thyme with the onion and garlic because I had it on hand. I used an immersion blender for the whole pot (where it states to add 3 cups of soup to blender)and then added in a can of drained beans and simmered for 15 minutes. I didn't have any feta but i used a small amount of cheddar as a garnish. Awesome! Will definately make again (perhaps tomorrow?!)

i type away as i enjoy a bowl of this very satisfying and flavourful soup i whipped up last night, so my comments are concise and current! i tossed in a 1/2 zucchini during saute step that i needed to use up and threw in some jarred, chopped roasted red peppers during the simmer stage (excellent addition!), used 3 cans of beans, 2 carrots and extra broth, less cumin (it can overpower this dish). topped it with chopped jalapeno, sour cream (feta is truly ideal), extra aged white Balderson cheddar and toasted pine nuts. the latter is a wonderful way to incorporate another layer of flavour and texture and works wonderfully with this simple, hearty, healthy soup-made-into-a- meal with the addition of a crusty loaf of sourdough.

Good soup, very easy to make with items I usually have in the pantry. I think I like the black bean soup with pumpkin better, but this comes together faster.

Fantastic! So easy and flavorful. Only quibble here is that the recipe does not make that much, and I will definitely double it next time as half the fun of soup is not having to cook the next day while you enjoy leftovers. A salad and maybe some bread and it is a great meal.

Simple and delicious. The easiest and best tasting black bean recipe I've tried. I substituted shredded pepper jack for the feta but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. I will definitely keep this one in rotation!

There is a health issue with this recipe that needs to be corrected: Never use the juice of canned beans. Canned beans should be drained and rinsed prior to use. I made this soup and was sick to my stomach. Doing research on canned beans, multiple sources indicate that the juice is very hard to digest and should be disgarded

Yummy. I don't know how much a teaspoon of jalapenos is so I just threw in a medium jalapeno, had it with some brown rice. Good stuff - nice balance of flavors.

I wouldn't have to have changed a thing, but I always have to play with recipes. I had a red bell pepper on hand, so I added it. And, instead of the diced tomatoes, I used Rotel. It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, because I thought the Rotel would offset the jalapeno. If you like things spicy, I would recommend adding the jalapeno in addition to the Rotel.

This is a fabulous recipe. I substitute a jar of medium salsa for the tomatoes. I like it a little spicier. the feta suggestion was fabulous.

I had a black bean soup at my favorite upscale bistro and tried this one because it looked similar in ingredients - but handsdown this is much better!And I feed 4 for the price of one bowl. I love the spicy and rich taste, added shallots instead of onion to keep it mild.

Yum! Great flavor. Took others' advice to use crockpot for beans (adding the sauteed stuff towards the end) and also to puree just half of the soup. I also used chicken broth instead of veg. broth. I haven't served yet but will top with salsa and sour cream.

Yum yum yum. Since I'm not really a big fan of carrot chunks, I grated the carrot instead. Worked out perfectly.

This soup was so good and so easy. Had a luncheon today and made this for the first time. EVERYONE asked for the recipe! Took all of no time and was delicious. I made a double batch adding only half of the beans before hand-blending. I added the rest of the whole beans after pureeing the broth. This is definitely going into my favorites.

Excellent! Not the prettiest of soups but great flavor. Made it even easier by using a hand blender. Didn't have feta so I served with a dollop of sour cream instead. I will definitely make this again.

Excellent and so easy. The second time I made it, I added an extra carrot and a gold bell pepper to the veggies, and I halved the cumin (it was quite strong the last time). I used an entire jalepeno, too. Served with avocado chunks, cilantro, and sour cream for toppings. The feta didn't really work for me here. Instead, I served the soup with green chile quesadillas. Very tasty!

This is a wonderful, filling, quick to make soup. Have taken it to the ski hill with us and there is never enough to go around. Great with garlic knots.

It is really, really rare for me to give four forks, but you just can't beat the ease and taste of this recipe. And I even use dried, soaked beans instead of tinned. I use a good homemade veggie stock or bouillon cubes instead of chicken, and have yet to feed a vegetarian who didn't love it.

My family really enjoyed this and it is easy to make. I didn't add the jalapeno pepper,just served it with green onions,tomato-basil feta,cheddar & cilantro on the side.

Very good black bean soup. I also added a third can of beans, like many of the other reviewers.

Rating: 4
Easy and yummy! I doubled recipe +1 extra can of beans. Used hand blender to partially puree beans. Used canned tomatoes with "zesty mild green chiles" and used canned chipotle in adobo sauce (1 1/2 minced with seeds removed) instead of jalapeno (Mine was mild but lively. Add more chipotle if more heat desired). Also, I used vegetable broth (swanson's organic) instead of chicken broth.

I buzzed the whole pot with a hand blender instead of just blendering three cups. I also added oregano because I wasn't using seasoned diced tomatoes and it was great. Served with sour cream, grated cheddar cheese and corn muffins, it was a simple Vespers Supper at my church that everyone loved! There was nothing left and even the finicky ones were happy.

very good - followed recipe one time (excellent) and varied it some another time and used 1/2 black beans and 1/2 dark red kidney beans (blended the red beans before adding) and it was also delicious. i did add more garlic both times.

A dinner staple, and even more so this time of year! Works with a mixture of beans (such as black and pinto), but my favorite addition is hot italian sausage! Doubles well, and great for leftovers and lunches.

This is an excellent soup recipe. My boyfriend even said it was better than soup he has had at a restaurant. I rinsed the black beans to eliminate some of the salt and added extra chicken broth. I also used tomatoes with chili peppers and served the soup with cheddar cheese, cilantro and corn bread muffins.

Wow this soup is delicious! So easy, so good. I look forward to cold weather just to make it.

very good soup, my hubby ate with sour cream on top. served with jalapeno honey corn bread. house smelled great.

My husband and I love this soup. To decrease the fat, I cut back on the olive oil (just 1 T.) and used reduced fat feta cheese. And rather than jalepeno used chipotle chile, which gives heat and depth. I may add more beans next time as one review recommended for a thicker soup. A definite keeper!!

Rating: 3
Easy, easy, easy! And tastes better than most restaurant black bean soups. I recommend changing the toppings to shredded cheese (I used Cheddar), sour cream, and cilantro or green onion. Simmer it down to thicken it up a bit. We served with garlic toasts and tossed field greens.

Delicious and very easy to make...it was perfect for a rainy night. I think next time I make it I may add about a half can more black beans just to give it a little more body. Otherwise, perfect!

I would buy this soup in restaurant. It is awesome and really easy to make. Used pickled jalapeños and it was still wonderufl. I thought it came out a tad too thick after the final simmering so I might puree a bit less of the soup next time. Make it - you'll love it.

This was so tasty and so easy to make. I served it with the cilantro and feta cheese, as suggested. I thought quesa fresca would be better, but since I had feta in the fridge I used that ...and to my surprise it was really good. I will definately make this again.

thumbs up on the ease of preparation & flexibility. in the interest of avoiding a trip to the store, I used muir glen roasted tomatoes & canned chiptoles (hint: you can freeze leftover chipotles almost indefinitely). it is on the soupier side (I prefer my black bean soup on the sludge-y side), so I simmered it for an hour to thicken it up.

We were snowbound over the holidays and I made this while everyone was outdoors shoveling the driveway, digging out cars or throwing snowballs. When they came inside for lunch, they devoured it. It's a terrific cold-weather comfort dish. I used only one teaspoon of jalapeno, but next time I'll use two to make it a bit spicier. Tweak the recipe if you want, but we loved it exactly as written.

raining and 42 degrees.....this was just what the doctor ordered. the only change I made was to add some chopped bacon to cook the onion in and doubled the amount of jalapeno.

I too had a "hankerin'" for something soulful and comforting on this rainy, damp night so I pulled this recipe and grabbed what I had in the house, desparate to not have to venture out in the rain again! I had dark and light kidney beans instead of black beans in the house and I had petite diced tomatoes with jalapenos already added as well in my pantry. Because I thought too that it could use a little kick, I added 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes and even threw in some diced chicken to give it some meatiness. I actually think I like the recipe even more now! My husband and I loved it...we will keep for another rainy day

My fiance said he was in the mood for soup so I looked for something quick and easy and this recipe was perfect! In fact, he liked it so much, he had 3 or 4 (I lost count) bowls of it in 1 sitting. I was expecting something spicier because of the jalapenos; I even put in more, but for some reason it still was not spicy. Other than that, it was perfect in both taste and texture, and healthy too!

I'd never made black bean soup before and found this to be a quick and easy recipe. Used 1/2 the amount of jalapeno called for, but would probably go for the full amount next time to zing it up a bit. Used dollop of sour cream to top instead of feta.

YUM!!! I wanted some soup for this rainy night, and this hit the spot. So easy to do and very flavorful. My adjustments: I used one chopped roasted red jalapeno and added the whole thing, which I think gave it some zip. Also used only 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and added a dollop of light sour cream to my bowlful. I used my handheld blender to puree it...I don't like putting hot soup in a blender. Very very good, and I will make it again for sure.

The flavor of this was wonderful, but it was not thick enough--next time I'll add 1-2 additional cans of black beans and I think it will be perfect for us. Used havarti, oddly, as the cheese--it melts to a lovely, gooey consistency and has a butttery flavor in Mexican dishes--I often substitute it for Monterey Jack with success.

This was soooo good, and easy. I only had 1 can of the black beans and it was still to die for, just not as dark when pureed. I topped it with sour cream, sharp cheese and cilantro. Yum!

Easy and flavorful black bean soup. I did add a dash each of chili powder and oregan, along with a bay leaf while simmering. Much better recipe than the vegetarian crockport version from a few months ago.

Excellent recipe. Followed directions pretty much exactly but let it simmer quite a bit longer. Great flavors right off the stove and will probably be even better tomorrow. C

Great stuff! So quick and easy! We had it for lunch everyday until it was gone. I've made many black bean soup recipes over the years; this was by far the quickest and one of the tastiest. Very easy, very yummy. I didn't use feta, substituted a little shredded cheddar instead. Topped it with cilantro, green onions, & cheddar. Will definitely make again; have placed recipe in my weekday file for quick & easy dishes.
