I could not find truffle butter but took truffle oil and slowly poured into blender running on high. It coagulated into a soft "butter" in about a minute. i used a little less than recipe and it worked great!

I made half the recipe. I was going to use truffle oil but used unsalted butter instead and that worked okay. I had to use a submersible blender to get the mix pureed enough. Good recipe and I would guess it to be amazing with black truffle butter.

Did a test run prior to adding to the Thanksgiving menu and was very happy with the result. Dried out the potatoes and celery root as recommended in earlier review and also substituted white pepper for black pepper for aesthetics. Used regular butter in the preparation and then put truffle butter out for folks to add as they wished. A little definitely goes a long way with the truffle butter. Overall, I loved the dish!

you need to dry out the potatoes and celery root after they are cooked, place them back in the pot they were cooked in and stir them until the mixture is fairly dry about 5- 8 mins.under low heat.If not the cream and butter will make the mixture too runny..and use white pepper NOT black pepper...nobody wants black specks in their food...celery and celery root are two different types of veg.and can't be interchanged in this recipe..Use only good UNSALTED BUTTER for this ..salted butter is not as good as unsalted butter..

This recipe was a success during Thanksgiving dinner. The truffle butter was really expensive $15 for 2oz. I think truffle oil would do the same job. I used only a fraction of the amount of truffle butter because I think it would have overpowered the subtle taste of the celery root.

Excellent side dish with our Thanksgiving day turkey. The truffles gave it a very good flavor. Will definitely make again!
