Considering the amount of time, work and money we put into this receipe it was quite dry and didn't have that much flavor. And I would definitely eliminate the celery, not sure why that was included. They were a bit dry also.

This was divine. Made the green mole from scratch following the Herbed Pumpkin Seed Mole recipe. Also followed the enchilada recipe to a tee, except heated the red onion, celery and crab in coconut oil instead of olive oil. Will be cooking this for special occasions.
