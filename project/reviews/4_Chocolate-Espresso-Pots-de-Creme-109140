This is an excellent recipe. I have made it many many times and every time it is an absolute hit. I do recommend increasing the sugar to 3 tablespoons. I don't have much of a sweet tooth but it really does let the chocolate stand out more this way. Make sure you use the best quality of chocolate you can. I've made this both with Callebaut and lesser quality chocolate. It's great no matter what, but even more delicious with good quality chocolate. Also, the recipe doubles, triples and even quadruples very well. And it can be made 1 day ahead. Just make sure to bring it to room temp before serving it. I always top mine with some whipped cream and candied bacon or candied pecans :)

Straightforward and virtually foolproof. Be careful with the espresso.

This was so good and so easy, I followed the recommendation of topping them with chocolate covered espresso beans, wow! So good!

I served this at a casual dinner party and everyone loved it. It was simple to make and was attractive garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and a couple of raspberries. It needed to cook in my oven for about 50 minutes.

Followed directions exactly and overcooked at just 30 mins. I used 3/4 cup ramekins, and filled only a bit over halfway. Ended up with only 6, so overcooking was a surprise. Since you cover while baking, it's hard to monitor. I should have checked at 20 or 25 minutes. I'll try something else next time, but for those who make this, I would definitely increase the liquid and check the baking at 20 minutes. Family liked the flavor, but the texture was more like mud than silky cream.

Exceptional! Made almost exactly as directed, except subbing milk chocolate for bittersweet. The chocolate and coffee flavors really come through, and the texture is creamy and delightful. Served with whipped cream and toasted coconut.

What a smooth dessert. I followed others by increasing the cream to 1.5 cups and .5 cups of milk. Left out the coffee and replaced it with 3T. Chombard (raspberry liqueur). I chilled the pots for several hours and melted 1/4c. seedless raspberry preserves and poured a layer over each pot and chilled till set. Just before serving, I topped each pot with a large dollop of Chantilly cream. I picked up the "dirty dishes" and they were as clean as when I was preparing the dessert--licked clean.

This was really tasty! Even if you love coffee flavor, I would recommend staying to the low or middle side of the range they recommend. This makes a great dessert if you have lots of other dishes to prepare because it's about as easy as making instant pudding (plus the additional step of baking), but it is so rich and elegant when served!

4 forks even though I followed a previous reviewers suggestion to increase the cream to 1 1/2 cups, ruduce the milk to 1/2 cup and increase the chocolate to 8 oz. I think it would have been perfect if I had left the chocolate at 6 oz. I'm a big dark chocolate fan but this was very intense even with holding the coffee powder to 1 1/2 teaspoons. Also baked only 30 minutes, but they were very firm (maybe because of the recipe adjustmenst and because I used small 2 oz French Lion bowls). But definitely jummy enough to try again!!! Christmas Eve 2008

loved it. made it twice and used a small coffee cups (traditionally used in Israel to drink turkish black coffee). everyone loved the concept of coffee based dessert in coffee cups. as other readers suggested, I increased the creme to 1.5 cups

Rating: 4
WOW! Really rich, use the smaller 4oz ramekins. 30 minutes for the baking was perfect. My friends that came over for dinner loved them and ate every last spoonful. I used Valharona 70% Bittersweet Chocolate-yummy.

This recipe is such a winner! I make it all the time in our catering business and not only is it easy, it is always a HUGE hit with our clients and their guests. If you like chocolate, it's just the best!

I've been making this recipe for years, though the one I've got appeared in Bon Appetit in '97. It's always a huge hit. Incredibly rich but a very impressive and restaurant quality dessert.

Loved it. Don't cook too long. It sets up as it cools. Yummy! And, guests wanted the recipe...always a sign of loving it.

I make this often and it's fantastic. Adjustments to make it perfect: use 1 1/2 cups cream; 1/2 cup milk; 8 oz. chocolate and a little less than 1 1/2 t. espresso. Key: only cook 30 minutes. If it is set around the edges, you've cooked it too long. My family raves about this and I can eat it too since each serving has only about 10 carbs.

I've made this twice now and have almost gotten it to mimick the "Gu" pudding I love from England. Up the heavy cream to 1 1/2 c., lower milk to 1/2 c., increase chocolate to 8 oz. and keep espresso to a little less than 1 1/2 t. No need to pour through a sieve - it is perfectly creamy without it. The key is to only cook it for 30 minutes - if the edges seem set, you've cooked it too long. With these adjustments, you'll get something thicker than pudding and creamier than icing. My family literally licks it out of the ramekins. Oh, and I don't eat carbs - I figure each of these has 10-15 carbs...even I can indulge.

I was so nervous, but this turned out really well! I must have steamed them just right..still quite jiggly when I took them out. Only had reg instant coffee, but the flavor was great! Not too rich for us in a big ramekin:-)

wait, so there's no water in the first pan, the one with the folded kitchen towel and the ramekins, but there is water in the second, larger pan in which you set the smaller? won't my kitchen towel burst into flames?

Absolutely delicious! Very chocolatey and VERY rich. Guests devoured it! Used El Rey Grand Saman chocolate and strongly brewed coffee (no instant espresso powder on hand).

Best dessert and crowd pleaser! It's now in my top ten chocolate favorites. Highly recommend. And don't overcook. Make sure it's wobbly and it will be perfect!

I made this for Valentine's Day and it was excellent!! I expected it to be similar to chocolate pudding, but it was sooooo much better than that--very chocolaty and creamy and smooth and rich all at the same time. I used 70% Scharffen Berger Bittersweet chocolate and 1 1/2 tsp Medaglia D'oro Instant Espresso Coffee. It tasted perfect!!! I also melted some white chocolate and after it hardened, I cut out little heart shapes (using a canape cutter) and placed one or two on top of each portion!

Very good, very chocolatey dessert. The guests actually moaned as they ate. Definitely keep the portions small. I was nervous about cooking it in a "water bath," but everything came out well and not overdone.

Christmas dessert at my house, was surprised how easy it was to make, had been afraid I was in over my head! Absolutely use the smallest ramekins you can find, as it is very rich, and while my guests loved it, a few couldn't finish for that reason. Would be nice with fresh fruit as a garnish, too.

Rating: 4
You won't regret trying this. Very simple yet incredibly tasty. You really can customize the coffee flavor by adding as little (or no) espresso powder as you want.Don't skimp on good quality chocolate though - it's what makes the creamy chocolate flavor really take center stage. Fresh whipped cream is all you need to finish it off.

I made this recipe for our supper club of 18 people and received rave reviews. I found the recipe very easy to make although it did take me longer than the stated 30 minutes. It took a while to finely cut up the chocolate. It was worth the effort.

Just be aware that between the chocolate and the espresso, there is a lot of caffeine. We used finely ground decaf espresso instead of instant espresso powder (we couldn't find instant decaf espresso) and it still tasted great.

Incredible. The smoothest, most delicious chocolate dessert imaginable. My husband and I made these for our Valentines dinner. They were amazing. If they did not come out smooth and creamy, you must have cooked them too long. However, you must love chocolate to love this dessert.

Rating: 4
Delicious! And dangerous- My husband couldnt stop eating them. I melted the chocolate just a little bit before I poured the boiling stuff over it, and whisked it for a long time- several minutes, until I couldnt see any little chocolate dots on the whisk when I looked at it. It was the smoothest dessert I have ever made!

My 16-year-old daughter who is not an especially accomplished cook used this recipe. Her pots were incredibly smooth, rich and decadent. We did not have milk, so we used 2 cups of heavy cream instead. I agree that a little goes a long way. My husband, daughter and I all thought these were as rich and delicious as pots de cremes we had at Bofinger in Paris.

To Athens: You got canned frosting consistency because you overcooked it. Get an oven thermometer, and never rely on the "bake for XX minutes at XXX degrees" portion of any written recipe. It's intended to be a guideline only. Cooking (even baking) is more art than science. Bon Apetite

Consistency and flavor of canned frosting. Butterscotch pots de creme on this smae website far better than this recipe.

Delicious - very creamy. I was grateful for your caveat re baking only until 'wobbly' in center, otherwise could easily have ended up with the fudgy consistency esperienced by others. The only change I will make the next time is to top with sweetened whipped cream to mellow out the 'edge' of strong chocolate and coffee.

Instant coffee powder works well instead of the instant expresso powder if you don't have that ingredient.

If you like unbelievably rich, melt in you mouth desserts then this is for you. Very decadent, very silky, great treat on Valentines day, but a little rich to have more than once or twice in a lifetime. I had no instant espresso so used instant hazelnut coffee instead, and the hazelnut flavour really developed over 2 days in the fridge. Yum.

Wow, wow, wow! Served for Valentine's Day dessert. Elegant, rich, deep espresso flavor. Definitely use good chocolate. I used Lindt bittersweet. My guests were impressed and it was a snap to make early in the day. After reading some of the other reviews about the thickness of the creme . . . I took mine out of the oven when they were still pretty jiggly in the centers but the edges looked "cooked." After the 1 hour at room temperature and the 3 hours of refrigeration, they set completely and were ultra creamy and delicious!

It WAS like fudge and I had expected something creamier, but having said that, this was really delicious. Maybe it cooked too long. The density could be helped with a big dollop of whipped cream on top when served. You could use less instant espresso too.

I loved the flavor and the texture was perfectly smooth, but much too thick. It was a bit too much like fudge, rather than pudding. I usally think of pot de creme as having the texture of velvet, and this one did not.

This was an fabulous dish and my guests raved over it. I was satisfied because it was popular, yet easy to make. The dark chocolate wwas a bit rich for me, so next time I might use part dark and part milk chocolate. Overall, it was very good though.

To the cook from Ontario: the towel insulates the bottoms of the ramekins or dishes. Otherwise, they are in direct contact with the outer pan, which cooks the bottom of the pots de creme too fast (which can make the texture coarse).

Wonderful dessert. Placed a dollop of cream whipped with a little touch of candied ginger to offset the sweetness...yum

One question - do you leave the towel in the baking pan for the water bath?

Absolutely delicious! Served it to a group of friends who just raved about it. My only note is that I increased the recipe by 50% and found I had to cook the ramekins about 10-15 minutes longer to achieve the consistency required in the recipe.

This is an extremely rich dessert. I followed the recipe exactly and used El Rey 70% dark chocolate, but topped it with a dab of real whipped cream as well as chocolate shavings. It made 5 ramekins and set perfectly in 30 minutes. Next time I would use smaller ramekins or espresso cups. The texture is a thick custard, and definitely for adults.

This was absolutely excellent. I followed the recipe except that I used real coffee instead of instant powder: Illy decaf made on a stovetop percolator (called a moka in italian). It was phenomenal (someone described it as "it tastes the way coffee smells"), but I found it needed closer to 50 min in the oven before it set, maybe because of the additional liquid from the coffee. Will most certainly make it again.
