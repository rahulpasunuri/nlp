Made these pretty much as directed with the exception of using the food processor to combine the butter and dry ingredients. They baked up nice and fluffy. I agree that they look dry as they come out of the oven but the texture was really pretty good (ok, I'm not from the South). I might try brushing the tops with cream instead of butter next time. Will definitely make these again, maybe with the addition of some cheese and spice to give it more kick. Either way, these went very well with the Guinness beef stew I made! Yum!!

very good basic recipe. i usually use skim milk instead of cream, just because that's what i have on hand. Also, I use self rising flour and they come out great.

These are about the simplest yet most delicious biscuits yet. Plus, such a simple recipe to experiment with. Have made these over 20 times with different variations of adding sugar, honey, 1/2 butter 1/2 lard, cheese, buttermilk, etc.

The taste is great for the quick and easy recipe. They also turned out quite fluffier than I expected. I substituted skim milk for the cream and they turned out tasty and rich.

Lovely biscuits. Quick and easy, and soo good. Just follow the recipe, a pastry cutter helps, or you could use a food processor to cut the butter in, then stir in the cream as directed.

A good basic recipe for biscuits. I substituted milk for the heavy cream and was pleased with the results. I believe it made them slightly more dense, though. Ultimately, delicious, easy to make, and would probably handle additions well (herbs, cheese, etc.)

Delicious! Perfect, fluffy biscuits, even with fat free half and half instead of cream. My husband loved them and said they could be a dessert.

everytime i make these they are perfect. great with breakfast, great with dinner. i have also found that they don't need 20 minutes in the oven, but closer to 12 or 15. they are tall, flakey, and fabulous! i highly recommend this recipe.

Did not rise much....I did use a wheat flour instead of all purpose. Also a bit on the bland side...I added fresh sprigs of rosemary to mine, which flavored them up nicely. I will try a bit more salt and spices next time.

Delicious! Milk (I used lowfat 1% milk) is a perfect substitute for heavy cream! They don't need 20 minutes, more like 12. Add butter, pepper, and maybe some cheese. Mmm!

I make this with half and half instead of heavy cream - I think they come out better and slightly lighter.

My husband can't stay away from these biscuits; they are really fabulous.

Good, basic recipe. Don't forget to use cold flour. Another tip I recently learned is to tri-fold the dough when kneading it - this makes it puff up and flake perfectly.

I've made these several times and enjoy the flaky, tender texture. I always use my hands to cut the butter into the flour and find that whipping cream (instead of heavy) is a decent substitute. I like to add cracked black pepper & parmesan for a savory biscuit, sometimes dill and lemon zest for a morning zing. Does anyone get a good rise from them? I tend to like tall layered biscuits and I find these don't really rise much when cut. I've made them as drop biscuits also. This recipe makes a delicious crumble biscuit.

These were very easy to make. I think I may have over kneaded the dough though. I used regular milk and they were still moist and flaky. The only problem was the bottom of the biscuits were hard - does this have to do with my oven or baking sheet?

This is the recipe I use regularly for my sunday morning biscuits. I use regular milk instead of cream so that they are a healthier version. Sometimes I also add sharp cheddar cheese. It's a good basic recipe that turns out delicious every time.

Finally I have found the perfect biscuit recipe! I had no cream, so I substituted a mix of whipping cream and milk. I also chilled the flour before combining it with the butter and the biscuits were flaky and soft...not dense like other recipes I've tried.

I make these biscuits often. They're easy and very tasty--even at high altitude. I bake them in a cast iron biscuit pan I got at www.williamssonoma.com. I think it makes all the difference in the world and makes huge flakey biscuits. Great with stew . . . YUM!

A bit too buttery for my taste and rather dry, too. I would suggest skipping the butter in the dough for softer biscuits.

Taste great and easy to make. I made the drop biscuit version and my kids loved them. Love this web site!

hi, I am from germany, when I first came over here I didn't really like biscuits...well, that changed after a while. This is my first american recipe I ever made (besides Burgers and Hot Dogs ;) ) It worked very well and my boyfriend who is american loved those biscuits.

I was so glad to find this i am from the us (ga) and was used to useing self riseing flour and could not find how to make it from all purpose flour every thing i tried they just wasn't the same they seem very heavy and not light like the biscuits i made from the light flour ( white lily ) makes but these was good thanks ..

I goofed this one, but they still came out great. I used fat-free half & half and just made them into drop biscuits. Very good, especially with honey.

These taste just like the kind my mom makes, except they are lighter and flakier (which makes them better!). I, too, am wishing there were a lower-fat version of these because they are just so good. mmm mm.

I'm not certain, but I think I had a disaster on my hands. I chose to process the dough in a food processor, rather than 'cut' the butter in by hand. Like the reviewer from NJ, it looked like a pile of crumbs at first, but after a minute or so of kneading, it shaped up. I'm wondering if the processor 'alters' the biscuits in some way because the were cripy on the outside and not very tender inside. My b/f, an American and biscuit-lover, said they were good but I think he was being polite. I was quite disappointed ... but I'll give it another go next weekend.

this is a splurge,but well worth it. not for every day but truly delicious. my 10 year old grandaughter found the recipe on this site and got me hooked on it. (she made it herself, and put jam between two thin layers of the dough before baking. a winner with the kids)

It should be noted that when you turn the "dough" out before kneading, it's really just a pile of crumbs. It may seem that there's not enough liquid. There is. Knead it very briefly, press it together, and it works. This is awfully rich, and good.

I LOVE these biscuits!!! The recipe must always be doubled at my house. I find they take a lot of preparation time, but it is well worth it. The biscuits also freeze well (if there are any left over!).

I've definitely had and made better biscuits. they were a bit tough and more salty than I expected (even with unsalted butter). This recipe was okay, but not one I'd rave about

I reckon I like these with mustard. I like french fried pertaters too.

These biscuits were great! One word of caution: be sure to reduce the amount of salt you add if you happen to use salted butter instead of unsalted butter in this recipe. I'll definitely make these again.

biscuits were flaky outside, moist inside. i used 6T. of butter in the dough and not brushed the melted butter on top. also, i made the first batch with heavy cream, but the dough didn't seem to stick together at all. i used whole milk instead and it formed a dough rather nicely. i will use whole milk from now on with this recipe.

Not my favorite. These are VERY rich and heavy. I loved the first bite, but couldn't stomach much more. Unsure if i would make them again.

Wow! Best biscuits we've ever tasted! In fact, I never knew biscuits could be so incredible. I was very careful to avoid working the dough much--also, I used half-and-half instead of cream because that's what I happened to have. This will be a standard in our home now.

Enjoy these for breakfast with honey or jam and as a sandwich with egg, cheese and ham. They are really light, high and crunchy on the outside!

I didnot have heavy cream when I decided to make these and despite this I found them to be very good and easy to make

I always wondered why my biscuits were never as good as the John 'O Groats ones in LA. Having made this recipe, I now know why - heavy cream. My husband and I have nicknamed these "The Unfortunately Good Biscuits" due to their high fat content, but eating them is a dream. I highly recommend these.
