I make this soup using Polish Keilbasa Sausage (about 12oz) instead of the bacon. I add three carrots, 8oz mushrooms, and I triple the amount of the jalepeno pepper. I have been making it this way for several years now, and it always is delicious!! People always want seconds (or thirds)!! Even better the second day!

This is good but I like to cut back the water. I use 2 qt instead of 3 qt and the consistency is more what I like, similar to red beans after also mashing with the bottom of a ladle. I've made this twice now.

I've made this recipe a few times now and I've substituted 3 or 4 cans of black beans that I rinsed before adding. After everything simmered for a while, I pureed part of the soup to give it a little extra thickness. Delicious.

Best bean soup I ever made. I changed the recipe by: Adding celery & carrot; 2 qt instead of 3 qt water; 4 small smoked ham bones instead of bacon; Water intead of chix broth. NO salt added. I also used a dollop of yogurt instead of sour cream. The ham hocks really make a difference for a much smokier and rich flavor than the bacon. Also, no need to use chix broth or any salt.

Very good bean soup. I made the mistake of salting it, which it does NOT need thanks to the bacon. I had to stick a raw potato in it to draw out the salt. I thought the bacon garnish was unnecessary given that there's a lot of bacon in the soup already. But it's a nice way to fancy up a pot of beans and like others have said, it takes easily to additions and adjustments.

Terrific flavors in this soup - I cooked the black beans in the pressure cooker before starting the soup. (I live in high altitude) This gave the beans a nice broth of their own, so I used way less chicken broth (I also like a thick black bean soup) I also used fresh thyme. I will definitely make this recipe again! I would advise to use the bacon and jalapeno, those flavors together really make this soup delicious!

I made this almost to recipe...smaller version...I put 2 cloves of garlic...no bacon...but I added scallions with the cilantro at the end...fabulous...oh and it doesn't need sour cream...soup stands on it's own..I might add lime juice when I reheat it...great stuff.

A keeper. Used only 2 qts stock, added whole red pepper, whole jalapeno (they're just not that hot these days!), can of rotel with green chilies, 3 cloves garlic, and doubled the dried spices. Soaked beans overnight and cooked in slow cooker after cooking bacon/sauteing veg per recipe directions. Served with dollop of sour cream and corn bread.

Good recipe, but I wish I had read the reviews before making it. I only added 2/3 of the chicken broth and still found it too brothy. I also pureed about 2/3 of the soup and added it back in to thicken it. Next time, I would use even less broth. I also used a pound of fresh black beans since I had them, and 2 red banana peppers rather than a bell pepper. I had some leftover salsa that I made, and I added that before adding the broth, which I think was a nice touch, but I like tomatoes in my bean soup. I know, not really the same recipe when all is said and done, but it's a good jumping off point to do your own thing.

Delicious! I made it pretty much exactly per recipe (I did use a lot less broth.) Served with rice - even my kids ate seconds.

This was really good. I used less liquid because I like a thicker soup. I also left out the jalapeno as I make everything low spice for my 4 year old. I topped it with a bit of hot sauce and a avocado/cilantro/lime salsa.

Absolutely delicious!!!! I made this soup without the bacon as my husband is a vegetarian. I used 2 cans of black beans plus 1 can of refried beans instead of dried beans, and it worked out perfectly!!! Very tasty :-)

This soup is very good - I did make the mistake of using uncured bacon and originally it didn't have enough flavor (because uncured bacon isn't as salty as most bacon). Used a bunch of peppers, both sweet and some hot peppers I had frozen and tossed in some carrots and celery as well to add more veggies. After correcting for salt and letting it sit overnight in the fridge, it was even better the next day.

I added pasta towards the end to make the soup heartier. After reading the reviews about it being brothy, decided to add another 1/2 cup of beans. It was a good soup for a cold night, but not as spectacular as all the other reviews suggest.

This recipe makes a fantastic soup. I doubled the onions and tripled the garlic. Since I had half a green pepper and two carrots laying around, I diced them up and threw them in with the other vegetables. I did not have cilantro or jalapeno on hand; I settled on cayenne and some cumin to add depth to the flavors. It was really fabulous, especially with a dollop of sour cream on top!

I made the recipe actually exactly as directed (except I used fresh oregano and thyme instead of dried, as I only have fresh), and it was superb. Brothy, yes, but not overly so, and it makes a very pleasant change from standard pureed bean soups. It's not too heavy or opressive this way. I thought the balance of flavors - the smoky bacon, earthy beans, the little bit of spice from the jalapeno, and the zesty kick of the cilantro - was really perfect, especially with a dollop of sour cream added in the bowl. This is definitely my new favorite soup and is perfect for a hearty but not heavy fall lunch. I'm sure I'll be making this all winter to keep warm.

Used leftover pot of black beans and left out the bacon. Added entire bellpepper just like everyone else and threw in some chopped tomatoes - absolutely delicious. Did seasoning exactly as writtine, a tiny bit spicy, very nice flavor. Ate it with avo and a little grated cheese on top. Can't wait to make again.

I too went with a less brothy version and ended up using about 2 quarts of liquid (1/2 vegetable broth, 1/2 water). I used a whole red bell pepper and amp'd up the garlic and jalapeno as well as adding red pepper flakes and some ancho chile powder. I served it with a little spicy chorizo. Very good.

Good easy recipe. I just use canned black beans, double the bell peppers (what are you going to do with the other half?), leave out the jalapeno b/c we have small children and use only 1 qt ckn broth and everyone, from my 1 year old son to my hubby to my very picky father in law, loves it. With the canned beans, the whole recipe only takes about 1/2 hour, so very good for a weekday night, especially with nothing to defrost. But if possible, I do prefer to let it simmer for 1-2 hours, to let the flavors meld. It always seems better the day after, even cold. I always serve it with Mexican rice and avocados and it makes a good hearty meal. One other change...I just leave all the bacon in. Sprinkling it on top didn't really add anything, and with the low sodium ckn broth, the extra saltiness in the soup is nice.

I love this recipe... just as it is or with canned tomatoes added. I've roasted the red pepper and added more than it asked for. But the broth amount seems way out of whack! I've used much less and it's still very brothy and different.

This soup is yummy. I had some grilled poblano peppers in the freezer that I subbed for the red pepper which added a smoky and spicy edge. I didn't have any stock and used water instead and it was great. I'll make it again for sure.

Perfect the way it is and lovely for a luncheon or an entree. I give it a meatier flare sometimes by doing the bacon as written, but add two big meaty boneless country style pork ribs cut into 1/2 inch cubes and seared/cooked with the bacon. And, I add three to six nice big deseeded fresh off the vine tomatoes. Either way, the flavors are the testament to a delicous meal!

For my vegetarian daughter, I use vegetable broth. I skimp a bit on the broth and add a bit more beans so that the end result is thicker. Also, I puree the whole thing, including the cilantro, because I like the thicker texture better than the whole beans. If needed, I add a splash of honey. For the rest of my family, I use chicken broth and the bacon, and I puree it all, bacon and all at the end, once again adding honey or brown sugar if appropriate. If, for some reason it turns out not as thick as I'd like, I serve it over white or brown rice. This is the best black bean soup I've ever eaten. Freezes well.

I love beans, specially the black variety,so I have made variations of this soup for years.A tip about cooking the beans: really try to soak them all night in lots of water, rinse next day using a colander under runing water,cook in a pressure cooker covered in a couple of inches of water(or unsalted broth) for 20-25 minutes then ,and only then mix in whatever seasonings and salt you want and finish cooking.That way they will always be soft and not at all "gaseus"

This is outstanding (and black beans are not my favorites), but it's only going to be as good as what you use in it. I used 48 oz. of homemade turkey broth, two cups of soaked overnight and cooked beans, and a whole red pepper. I think 96 oz. of liquid would make it way too brothy, and cooking it down would destroy it. Don't skip the cilantro.

Rating: 3
I made a quick version of this with a few alterations and it turned out really well. 1 can of black beans drained, 1 48 oz can of chicken broth, chopped ham instead of bacon, and a bit of lime juice before serving. I cooked the peppers, onions, etc in a bit of olive oil, and put the ham in with the broth.

This is a very tasty soup but has a bit too much chicken stock in my view. After the cooking time I boiled it to reduce it a little for about 20 minutes - this intensified the flavour as well. I used a whole bell pepper - it didn't look like enough. Served it to friends visiting on a miserably wet winter day and they loved the flavour. Would definitely make it again.

i cooked this down for a few more hours and it got naturally thicker and more delicious. i put in mild green canned chilis, but no fresh hot pepper. only some louisiana hot sauce towards the end. i topped it on pearl brown rice. more like black beans and rice. very nice.

A little bland, but I added a can of tomato paste and some red wine vinegar. Way better, thickens it up a little bit

Too brothy for me, so I added a can of black refried beans I had in the pantry. Next time I'll just not use as much chicken broth. I liked the mild flavor.

Tried this recipe yesterday. Husband loved it but we disagreed on the thickness. I like the "brothy" quality of the soup but he would like it thicker. Next time I will puree some of the cooked beans with some broth, then add it to the pot to make him happy...The jalepeno added just the right kick.

I used this recipe as a base and made a few changes. I know people hate it when you change a recipe and then rate it, but I was very happy with the way it came out. I cooked the beans using the quick soak method and they were fine. I didn't have red pepper so I used yellow and orange. I added 2 t of ground cumin and 3 cloves of minced garlic (I don't remember if the recipe called for garlic or not). I also used about 1/4 of the suggested stock. I added 1 can of diced tomoatoes with mild chilis. I pureed about 1/2 the soup. I also added a bag of frozen sweet corn at the end. Perfect on a cold winters night!

I have to confess: I am trying to learn to like beans (healthy food you know) and how to cook them so I didn't have to rely on canned. This recipe fit the bill perfectly! The beans were great, and black beans are not my favorite. But the second time I made this I used pintos and they tasted better than the best beans I have had at ANY Tex-Mex restaurant. And they are probably better than my cousin Mark's. Maybe we'll have a bean cook off on vacation this year. I keep several bowls in the freezer now. Adding tomatoes and green peppers (Rotel) sounds interesting. Will have to try that as well.

This was a wonderful soup. I've tried several rec. looking for a good one and this is by far the best. I added a can of Rotel as suggested by others. Served along with some corn bread and fresh tomatillo salsa! Everyone went back for a second bowl.

This soup is fabulous. I think it made about 12 servings, was very tasty, and I calculated this at either 0 or 1 Weight Watchers point/cup! Very healthy and delicious.

we also loved this soup. I added a can of diced tomatoes as well as about a tsp of beef concentrate.

This is a nice variation of black bean soup that works very well in the "Black and White Soup" (which is absolutely WONDERFUL, by the way). I highly recommend at least a look at that recipe, I've made it for a variety of guests and have had nothing but rave reviews. Happy New Year!

I made this soup to serve five or six the day after Christmas. I ended up serving 12 (filled in with a little rice), and everyone said it was the best black bean soup ever. I will definitely make it again. I did add the tomatoes with chilies as suggested (after the soup was cooked), and I would recommend that addition.

This was good however I liked it better after adding a can of hot Ro-Tel tomatoes and chilies. As others noted it was better the next day. On the third round of leftovers I drained all the liquid off and used the beans as a side for red chili chicken enchiladas. Wonderful !!!

Rating: 3
Even that I did not make the recipe, I sure will. I am cuban and black bean soup is a staple in our diet, but we do not make it this way. In order to cut the beans cooking time, we always use a pressure cooker. You can cook the beans in not more of 45 minutes.

This was a very tasty, flavorful soup. I liked the consistency much better the next day though. Mine was a little too "brothy" for me at first. I did use the "quick" soak method of soaking my beans. Not sure if that was a good idea or not? Still a very nice soup. Great with cheese quesadillas and a salad.

Rating: 3
Very good. I substituted 1/2# pork/bacon sausage for the bacon, and dried red pepper for the jalapenos or chiles. The combination of spices add a nice hearty flavor.
