I've made this a few times, with variations each time. The first time I made it as the recipe specified but the chipotle peppers were too hot. After that I used smoked olive oil (google it) and left out the peppers. I used agave instead of molasses and I prefer the milder flavor. I used a lot of sundried tomatoes, more than called for. Once I substituted roasted red bell peppers for the sundried tomatoes and enjoyed that as well. I've also used a variety of small beans instead of the navy beans, such as pebble beans from Rancho Gordo. They are very lovely to look at and hold up well in this salad. As you can tell, I enjoy playing with this recipe and it's a keeper!

Took this to a potluck and it went over really well! Definitely will make again. The only adjustment I made was to add a bit of salt to taste.
