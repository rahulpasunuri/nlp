Are you serious? Spread butter, Chives and Pepper over potatoes is a recipe? Unless you have a really delicate pallette, this sucks. Hell, quarter the potatoes, shake em in a bag of oil and lemon pepper and bake em. At least they will have some flavor.

So good and so easy! Definitely need the smallest potatoes possible. I liked half red- and half white-skinned.

Joy for this dish comes from it being simple first, and then delicious. I wouldn't have changed a thing.

Never thought such a simple recipe would put out such great flavor. I have made this dish twice already and wil take to next weekend's family reunion

This is heaven on a plate. As the previous reviewer indicated, this is even more luscious with fresh, farmer's market potatoes, but works great, too, with potatoes from the supermarket. Use the tiniest potatoes you can find for complete potato nirvana.

We rated this high because it is so easy, and is outstanding with fresh potatoes (agree with cook who suggested reddish skins possible)and chives. We can't wait until the Farmers'Market opens this summer to get top quality potatoes!

Delicious and easy make ahead. Do the chive butter and set aside. Then cook potatoes and when ready to serve, Zap the cooked potatoes in the microwave to heat them up and toss with the chive butter.

Divine. Use the smallest reddest potatoes you can find. No need to do any peeling, then. Delicious butter -- would be great with all sorts of foods. These are just wonderful. Don't skimp on the chives.

It was very easy to prepare and turned out great. I melted the butter/chive mixture and found that made it easier to coat the potatoes. I will definitely make this again.
