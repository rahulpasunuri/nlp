I made this recipe with diced strawberries in place of the blueberries, as one of my friends doesn't like blueberries. It was fantastic. Super fresh and just a hint of sweetness. I would make the cream a little more lemon-y next time.

So simple!Changed the heavy cream to nonfat yogurt and it was excellent and even lower in calories.

This recipe deserves four stars since it is easy and quick to make, requires just a few ingredients, and is delicious. I made it with blueberries picked just hours before at a local farm and mint from my garden. The combination of flavors was great! All eaters agreed.

I DID make this and served it with a single fancy cookie on the side. It was a nice dessert with very little work. Next time I think I would make a bit less of the lemon cream

I have a large mint plant in a pot, and I can't wait to make this. It's going to be good, what's not to like? A perfect dessert to use with Splenda for those of us on lo carb plans. I cook alot, and I can tell this will be a favorite.
