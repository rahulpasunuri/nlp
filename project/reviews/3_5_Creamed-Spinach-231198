Wonderful recipe. I liked it so much I put it on my website Happilyunprocessed.com. It's so important to help our children learn to eat 'REAL' food here in the US at an early age and recipes like this one make it easier for them to enjoy! Thank you for the great recipe!

This creamed spinach recipe gets 4 forks from me. It was absolutely delicious and tastes as good if not better than the restaurant creamed spinach I have had. The recipe was very easy to make. I did use the potato ricer method for squeezing the water out of the spinach as suggested in the other reviews, so I think that contributed to the success of the dish. I will definitely make this again.

Thanks to the person who suggested the ricer to remove all of the water! Previous attempts at this dish ended up soggy but not this one with that added step. Also added 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese with the salt pepper and nutmeg. Gave it extra zing. Delicious recipe I will make again.

This is super yummy! A good quick and easy side dish to get going, and really add depth to a meal. We eat spinach a lot, and it is nice to have several recipes to "go to." I sometimes don't add the nutmeg, if it does not seem to go with what else I am serving. The recipe is for 3 POUNDS of spinach, so, be sure to cut back on the other ingredients if you are not making 3 POUNDS of spinach. I always seem to forget, and end up having way too much sauce.

I have used this recipe twice in a row for Thanksgiving Dinner. It is the one closest to the version my mother made every year, pure, simple, lovely creamed spinach. This year, I made one batch with frozen spinach, and the other with fresh. I could taste a difference, but no one else commented. The hardest part of the recipe is getting the water out of the cooked spinach, but I learned a trick this year. Squeeze the water with a potato ricer. Worked great! I highly recommend this recipe.

Made this recently for a belated Easter dinner and it was fabulous! I cut the recipe in half and it served about 6 people. I did add a pinch of cayenne pepper. Can easily be made in advance. In fact I reheated some leftovers two days later and it was still delicious. Definitely a "4-forker!!

Awesome and so easy!! I used frozen chopped spinach from trader joe's. The trick is to drain the spinach of all the water as best you can- I used a bunch of cheesecloth. Everyone loved it! And I added a little more nutmeg :)

I am standing in my kitchen on Christmas Eve morning at 8:19 a.m. eating delicious creamed spinach! This is my first attempt at making this recipe, it's super quick! Spinach at my local supermarket was expensive so I bought 3 packs of frozen whole leaf spinach, microwaved them and squeezed out the excess water as I added it to the roux. Saved some time and money and still came out delicious, I hope my guests will agree. Also added 1/8 tsp. of pepper and 1/4 tsp. of salt. Happy holidays everyone!

DELICIOUSSSSSSSSS! made it several times. very easy and quick to make. wonderful side dish for a nunber of culinary delights.

Disappointing. I took some reviewer's suggestion to add the spinach right to the liquids without precooking, but I found this to be more difficult than pre-cooking it would have been. Also, my dish ended up quite watery, which is probably due to skipping the step where you squeeze out the extra water from the cooked spinach. Regardless, I give this two forks not for texture but for taste. It was fairly bland and tasteless. I added tons of salt and tripled the nutmeg, and then finally added a little cayenne, and finally it was delicious -- but as written I think its bland. I would make again only with my modifications.

Hands down, the best creamed spinach I have ever had. I cut the recipe in half but still used a whole small onion.

After cooking the onions and roux just go ahead and add the spinach with the liquids. No need to precook the spinach first...you lose all the nutirents. Just cook it in the milk & cream! Very good!

This is begging for parm. cheese! Make it easy on yourself and use a big pot to cook the onions, add the flour as directed, then just add the cream & milk straight from the fridge (no need to heat first). I added the fresh spinach without cooking it either. Just keep mixing, it eventually wilts and cooks. Mix in parm cheese to taste.

I made this dish Christmas & New Year's birthday dinner. GREAT HIT! 1st time used fresh spinach - 2nd time frozen much easier. Adjusted the flour - a little too thick. Everyone loved it.

Almost always use this recipe for creamed spinach. Love it with fresh spinach, but don't be surprised if three lbs of spinach will fill a paper grocery bag. Most of the time I use frozen leaf spinach, thawed and squeezed dry.

I agree with the earlier poster who said that this is what creamed spinach is *supposed* to taste like. It's a very simple veg. dish that (halleluia) allows you to cook it in advance rather than hover over the steamer as everyone is sitting down to supper. I would suggest that you try it as written. It's delicious with the beef roast in the same menu and other flavorful beef dishes as a subtle counterpoint. FWIW, I've made this with thawed frozen chopped spinach to cut down on cost/effort in the past and it turns out nicely, too. It's not quite the same, but good.

Simple creamed spinach that was very tasty... nothing amazing, but definitely satisfying. Serve it right after you make it for best results.

This is the perfect creamed spinach recipe. Anyone who doesn't like it doesn't know what creamed spinach is supposed to taste like, because this is it. Or maybe they can't follow instructions. I agree with the cook below who suggests you make sure all the moisture is removed. I'd add that when you chop the spinach, don't go crazy; the bigger the pieces the better. I can't wait to make it again.

This is a perfectly good creamed spinach recipe. If you like spinach, you'll like this just fine. I must say that the recent negative reviews annoy me. This is creamed spinach! It should not cost $50! Remember that its a simple dish, and you won't be searching for the "perfect" recipe.

I've made this for Christmas dinner the past two years and everyone seems to love it. Make sure that ALL the moisture is gone from the spinach before adding it to the creme/milk mixture. I use 2% milk instead of whole; it works well.

Not that great. Keep looking for a better creamed spinach recipe. I would not make this one again. I didn't care for the consistency and the flavor was just not there.

I made this misbegotten recipe for my girlfriend's family. They hated it so much that a violent fight ensued, ending with creamed spinach hurled onto the walls, ceiling and my pet ferret. I shall never forget the horror of that meal. Next time I'll use less nutmeg.

I made this exactly as in the recipe and was not amazed by the results. It was definitely the worst part of the Easter meal. Bland and blah. And all that baby spinach is not cheap! (about $50 at Stop and Shop) Just about anything would have been a better use of that money. I will never cook this again.

This wasn't bad, but I was a little let down based on all the rave reviews.

I had spectacular success with this recipe with some changes to reduce the fat. Used all 2% Milk instead of milk and cream and it was definately creamy! Used only 1 tablespoon of Butter and 3 Tablespoons of Good Olive Oil for the roux. Used one small onion as listed AND 5 Cloves of Garlic, all chopped finely in the small bowl of my food processor. Didn't boil the spinach...I sprayed the bottom and sides of my largest pot with Olive Oil spray (so spinach doesn't stick) and just filled it to the top, covered it, put heat on medium high and let the water in the spinach steam itself. (Had to stir a few times and recover and also add the some spinach that didn't fit at first until all the spinach was wilted. I think I turned the heat down to medium as the pot got really hot. Then I took off the cover, put the pot in a sink partially filled with cold water to cool it while I got the onions and garlic sauteeing. Then I put the spinach into a colander to drain, pressing as much as the water out with a wooden spoon while keeping an eye on the onion mixture. Make the roux as directed but don't forget the salt and pepper as well as the nutmeg. The salt and pepper is not listed in the ingrediants list but is mentioned. It is needed along with the nutmeg. Put in the well drained but still moist but not drippey, chopped spinach. Reheat and serve either as a "comfort food" sidedish for a cold winter night or I have even served as a hot dip with bread as an appetizer for a New Year's Eve Party! Guests also dipped lightly steamed, cooled brocolli and cauliflower in it and raw carrots that were meant for other dips but...whatever...they loved it and everyone asks for the recipe. I will make again and again!

Very easy, very rich. Used heavy cream and milk; next time would use either light cream or half and half. Frozen spinach (easier than fresh for me). Could have used more salt, perhaps.

This was really good and easy. I made the sauce the night before Thanksgiving and refrigerated it. Then T-giving AM I prepped the spinach-mixture of fresh and frozen due to my miscalculation. Right before dinner I warmed the sauce and added the spinach. The sauce could benefit from the addition of a bit of salt. Will add some homemade chipotles in adobo sauce to the leftovers.

Mmm, mmm, mmm. This recipe is delicious and easy to make. I used 1% milk instead of whole milk but I didn't change anything else.

I made this for a dinner party and I was disapointed there were no leftovers. I read the other reviews suggesting parmesan and it might be necessary with frozen spinach. But if you use fresh, the parmesan would just cover up the freshness of the spinach and the sweetness of the cream. The subtle flavors are perfect without the cheese.

This recipe was so surprisingly easy and delicious!! I made it with frozen spinach to save time and it tasted great, just like the restaurants. I don't think using frozen spinach compromised on the recipe at all. I would take the other reviewer's suggestion of adding some parmesan cheese and maybe some pancetta to add a smoky flavor like the steakhouses ...I would DEFINITELY make this again.

Absolutely delicious. I added a bit more nutmeg, and we just microwaved the spinach rather than boil it.

Great dish! I used frozen boxes of spinach (thawed & cooked, of course) and it came out delicious. I did take the advice of a previous cook and added a cup of parmasan cheese and then I added some pressed garlic. Maybe it helped that I let it sit for a while and let the juices mesh; then just re-heated it before serving. The flavor was very good!

I first made this recipe for Christmas Eve dinner, and was amazed at how elegant and subtle its flavors were, yet how hearty and substantial. It's also surprisingly easy to make. It will be an ongoing Christmas tradition, but I continue to make it at other times because it is so good!
