Great recipe, simple, easy, fast and delicious. I bought a beautiful piece of very fresh grouper yesterday, halved crosswise and cooked according to the recipe. I used 10 oz grape tomatoes cut in half, parsley instead of basil and added a few capers. Great dinner!

This was great. Very simple with nice flavors. I did dust one side of the fish with a little flour and seared it before adding the tomatoes and covering the pan. I also added chives to the basil and deglazed with white wine at the end to make a sauce. I served it with corn and butterbean succotash as the corn spoonbread Epicurious suggested seemed like it would kill the main selling point of this dish - simple and easy.

This tasted absolutely fabulous last night with grouper freshly caught from the Apalachicola Bay along with basil grown in my friend's herb garden. With regular tomatoes and garlic from the store and prepared pretty much following the recipe, this tasted like something we would have paid $30 for in a high-end seafood restaurant!

This is so simple, quick and delicious! I made it with grouper and I quadrupled the amount of tomatoes, garlic and basil - - the amount given in the recipe just seemed too little. Next time I might sear the fish before cooking at a lower temperature. Otherwise, perfect!

I have made this recipe several times already and each time the result has been spectacular. I follow the recipe exactly as written. To the fresh fanatics below: I use frozen grouper from the freezer section of my supermarket and it still turns out great. And it only costs $7 for half a kilo (enough to feed 2-3 people).

This worked great on the grill, packaging the fish & topping as prepared in a double layer of heavy duty foil.

Good and simple, but nothing special, I mean how can you go wrong with tomato, basil and garlic. Of course the star of the dish is the fish and it needs to be fresh.

I was lucky enough to buy fresh veggies at our local Farmer's Market and it really made the flavors of this recepie come out. What a delicious way to cook fish! And simple. I steamed fresh carrots and brocolli and made fresh mashed garlic potatoes.

I followed the recipe exactly using red grouper and thought it turned out very tasty. I would not do this recipe when tomatoes are not in season though. I paired it with a caprese pie.

Just made this and had to come into the den and write a review. This was FANTASTIC! Like some earlier I reduced pan juices with a dash of white wine and a touch of Basalmic Vinegar. Used heirloom minature tomoatoes, served with a side of porcini peal pasta risotto and snap peas. Folks this is a winner!

I made this recipe with everything it called for but a little extra garlic. My wife and mother-in-law were left wanting more even thought they were full. It was a quick and easy recipe with a great flavor especially if all ingredients are fresh.

This is a great recipe! We just got a fresh fish vendor at our local farmers market and I bought a grouper fillet - paid dearly for it and didn't want to mess it up. I had the first of my basil from the herb garden, so timing was perfect! Fresh tomato would have been even better, but that will have to wait. Easy, fast and delicious!!

I used very freshly caught grouper, basil out of my garden and fresh organic tomatoes. I pretty loosely followed the recipe, in that I didn't measure anything and the fish was absolutely delicious. I was pretty generous with olive oil and spices... fabulous.

The dish is very easy to prepare. The freshness of the ingredients and its flavors come together in a excellent way; as Italian cuisine is suppose to be. I would use a different type fish next time. Tilapias would be good choice.

This is a nice, simple, quick, and delicious recipe. I doubled the basil and the garlic and added a touch of red pepper flakes. I did what others suggested - took the fish out after cooking and reduced the sauce with some sherry (didn't have any white wine) and it turned out great.

Great use of our overabundance of tomatoes and basil from our garden. My kids LOVED it and wanted it for lunch the next day.

This is a nice summer fish dish and so easy! I did make a few changes. I added more garlic, the basil and a little greek oregano fresh from my herb garden, used much less oil and added a drizzle of good quality balsamic vinegar. I hate to do dishes so, I tightly sealed it all a sheet of heavy duty foil. (Be sure to coat inside the foil with oil so it won't react with the tomatoes). Then I put it on the grill with some fresh corn on the cob and summer squash and served it with quinoa. I also used salmon .... I've never seen grouper available where I live in AZ. Next time I think I will do a lighter harder to grill fish like tilapia and still can do the whole dinner on the grill. No clean up! EASY!

Deceptively easy and very good. Be sure to start fish in a cold pan. Consider adding lemon zest and capers to the tomato mixture. Even as presented this is very good.

Agree with other posts nice fast simple. Also nice with fresh Dolfin or Seabass...thicker steaks better. I seed the tomotoes to keep the liquid down. The tomotoes carmelize for a very nice taste.

This recipe is a winner...simple, fast and incredibly good. Here's my own take on this recipe. I never trust a tomato I haven't picked, so I used imported, canned San Marzano tomatoes with excellent results. At least 2 cloves of garlic, 3 tablespoons of basil and plenty of salt and pepper are a must. I removed the cooked fish at the last minute to reduce the juices with about 1/4 cup left over champagne (any white wine would be fine), 1 tablespoon lemon juice and a tablespoon of butter. I served it with saffron rice and asparagus.

Prepared this recipe tonight (August 8). Very easy but not particularly tasty...I would do it again but would boil down the "sauce" from the fish and add white wine but would add more garlic and basil to begin with and probably onion to give it more snap...Needs something more but is a good start. Grouper is a wonderful fish that can take lots of additional flavor to spark it up!!!

Cod happened to be on sale, so I substituted the grouper and doubled up the tomato mixture. Served with grilled asparagus and couscous for a FANTASTIC and light dinner!

I would have given this a four star rating, but grouper is not my favorite fish......HOWEVER I really liked it very much and so did my husband who is my best critic. I have never rated a recipe before on this website and thought it would be fun to share my comments because it turned out so nicely and was such a surprise. I served it with basmati rice and zucchini sauted with onion. I thought I was so clever to transfer the fish to a serving dish while I reduced the liquid in the pan with some white wine that I should share the idea. I read the reviews afterward and discovered that I wasn't alone. Definitely a keeper. Okay, make it Four forks!

stick with the recipe, we made it with the 4 cloves of garlic and it was much too much garlic.

Very, very good. I agree that the pan juices shoudl be reduced with an added cup of white wine while keeping the fish on a warm platter.

This was a great way to prepare grouper - after removing the fish from the pan I added a splash of white wine to the juices in the pan for a few minutes, very delicious!

This was so very good. I pickup up a fresh fillet of grouper at our Saturday farmers market in Sarasota and prepared this recipe for our dinner yesterday afternoon. The grouper weighed in at almost 1 1/2 pounds and both my wife and I love the flavor of garlic and basil. We used about 4 tablespoons of sliced basil and four garlic cloves. This was so easy to prepare and incredibly fresh and flaverful for our Saturday dinner. It really does not get easier than this on preparing a four star meal. I did cook down the liquid with some white wine and chicken stock and poured the reduction over fish and zucchini saute.

Perfect and simple. I prefer these straight-forward dishes where it's the ingredients more than the cook that lead to amazing food. I rarely follow recipes, but this is the same as anything I'd whip together for a simple meal anyway. Wonderful accompanied by couscous and zucchini

Good starter recipe. When fish is cooked, there is far too much fluid in pan; remove fish intact, boil off most of watery fluid, then add some (depending on quantity) very high quality balsamic vinegar. This punches it ups and addresses the acidity problem. Stir around pan to incorporate all pan juices reamingt, and pour over fish on platter. This works. Changes it to 4 stars.

quick, quick, quick! so easy...just what we needed for a light dinner. Didn't have any basil...substituted tarragon. Wonderful flavor.

We make this with tilapia more often than grouper because it's cheaper. It's still delicious! One of our staples.

very good...needs more tomato ...perhaps some lemon...love grouper though!

Surprisingly good. I used three cloves of garlic, which was just right. I would also consider adding chopped olives or capers to this next time for a sort of puttanesca style.

Do use the garlic. Made it with snapper. Make sure the tomato is flavorful. Otherwise,use canned Italian plum tomatoes. My husband thought this was the best fish we ever made. Be sure the fish is absolutely fresh. Bon appetit.

this dish was pretty good but definitely not the best recipe for fish that i've found. i made it with red snapper. i like all the flavors involved - basil, tomatoes, snapper, garlic... but felt that the strong basil and garlic flavors overpowered the more subtle flavor of the snapper. but the dish presents very well aesthetically as the colors are brilliant.

This is quite good. I made it with Sable fish. I bought and then I didn't know what to do with it as there were no recipes on Epicurious. I'm lost with out it. I found this recipe while checking the corn recipes. Go figure. I have fresh tomatoes, basil, and I added some fresh green pepper and onions. I'll make it again using any white fish.

absolutely delicious. Very simple and quite tasty. Have already made it many times. This recipe would appeal to people who like fish cooked in tomato based sauces. Very italian and quite excellent. I highly recommend it if you want a break from the white wine and garlic or plain grilled type recipes. It's so easy. Try it!!!!

I've never had grouper before and so wasn't sure what to do with it. This recipe was easy and delicious! Required lots of good crusty bread to soak up the wonderful juices though ...

this was a huge disappointment for such a costly piece of fish. I have made this before with basa and loved it... this time it went down the drain.

FABULOUS! I was surprised at how easy yet delicious this was. I also had to resist the urge to baste or even lift the lid during cooking but I didn't and am glad! The fish was tender with excellent flavor. I think fresh grouper is important and I also gave it one extra minute to cook.

File this recipe under tasty, quick and easy. All the preparation takes very little time and cooking it is a breeze. Even though I made it in December, it seems like it would be a great summer meal. The cooking method won't heat up the kitchen. I will definitely make this again.

This is very easy, flavorful and healthy. I used tilapia, which was delicious, but will try other fish, such as catfish and grouper in the future.

I tried this recipe tonight with snapper and canned tomatoes. It was a snap to make and a pretty tasty AND healty dish. I will definately make it again. The biggest plus was that I made another recipe from this site earlier this week: FUSILLI WITH CHEVRE, TOMATOES AND BASIL. It calls for some of the very same ingredients!

Substituted catfish for grouper, and it still came out delicious! I served it with green beans and strips of yellow bell pepper, both blanched and with a vinagrette. Great summer dish.

This was a great, quick, weekday recipe. I added some black olives and served it over a bed of couscous. Also, the grouper took a little longer (about 10 minutes) to cook.
