Good basic recipe idea! I've made this a few times, each time experimenting with herb variations such as greek oregeano, thyme, dill & mustard. Also used filo sometimes.

I made this for some family friends for an all-appetizer party and everyone loved these. I added about a cup more of the cheeses and processed the pumpkin a little bit so that it was in more manageable pieces. I also made then egg-roll shaped, using the medium-sized spring roll wrappers (~5 inches)and made about 40 pastries from one recipe. Very tasty, even pumpkin haters loved them!...Although Epicurious gives a Greek name for them, no one had seen them before.

I used canned pumpkin and traded the spring roll wrappers for puff pastry much easier!
