.). It made 3 tall glasses, and given that I'm drinking 1, it's far less fat than the cup of greek yogourt I've been having the past couple days. So I'm good with that.

I really love recipes with Medjool dates, but they really a problem with diabetics. Two dates are almost 2 carbs. As a diabetic, I am allowed 2-3 carbs for breakfast. This recipe is almost 6 carbs. I would have this sometime for a rare indulgence, but not for a frequent breakfast. It's such a shame too; I could eat a whole box of Medjool dates.

So easy, and so tasty. I added a tablespoon of flax seed, a scoop of vanilla protein powder, and about 1/4 cup of old fashioned oatmeal (uncooked). Delightful.

i followed the recipe to the tee and it came out awful! it wasn't sweet at all! i was so looking forward to this wonderfully sweet smoothie everyone was raving about but got nothing but a thin, yogurt tasting cup of nothing! i was very disappointed! i won't waste my time with this one again.

Yum! Quite sweet but that can be easily adjusted. A tip for making it smooth: soak the dates in (warm) water for an hour or more ahead of time, and blend the dates with a bit of the soaking water first, then add the other ingredients. I like to keep date paste on hand as a healthy sweetener, so if you have a lot of dates, it might make sense to do a bigger batch and keep it in the fridge. This smoothie is also good with cinnamon.

Wonderful smoothie, nice change from fruit/berry/banana types. The dates are sweet but in a mellow energizing way and are a natural with the milk and splash of vanilla. Made sure I got fresh, soft dates and no pits ! Also delicious with hemp seed milk.

I thought this was way too sweet. Used 9 ounces of dates. I would start out using a smaller amount and adding more if I thought it was needed.

DUDE!!!! I do not eat dates - I only have them in the house cuz my 3 year old luvs 'em! so as a treat i made him this & there was extra & I couldn't stop sucking it back! I didn't have any yogurt or ice cubes so I put in 1/3 cup o cream & didn't quite put in a cupful of dates. YUM-O!

My husband used to work the date festival while going to college and has fond memories of the date shakes the other reviewer mentioned. To make this lighter smoothie more like the real deal I pureed the dates in the food processor and froze the yogurt before adding both to the blender.

I have found this easy and addictive. For health reasons I need to eat a very low fat diet and it can get boring. Not only was this a welcomed, refreshing start to my day all summer, but all my aides and other helpers who were around in the morning wanted the recipe. In response to another reviewer: things don't have to be complicated to be good! The simplicity of ingredients marrying well is part of what makes this such a success, and also an easy, doable and reliable treat. Regarding the coarse residue in the blender: Not a problem for me when using fresh, plump Mejdool dates, but indeed a problem with older or dried dates. As much as I would love to experiment with bananas and perhaps dried apricots or other dried moist fruits, this may be one of those times when following the recipe as written is the only way to achieve the desired results. Its art may be in its simplicity, which may not allow for a lot of variation.

I liked it alot but I used strawberries and blackberries instead of dates

This is very very sweet. I also used dried dates and I had a lot of date pieces that didn't blend in but I didn't mind.

What a way to start the day! I used an organic, chai vanilla, low fat yogurt in place of the nonfat plain. It was a great source of energy for my morning cycling class.

Didn't have fresh dates so I used dried and put them in some water and microwaved to try to plump them up. Also added 1/2 banana. Next time I would use more dried dates as it wasn't flavorful enough with 1 cup.

My cheap old blender had a very difficult time with the dates. As a result, I ended up with lots of date pieces left unblended. The smoothie was too thin, so I ended up adding a banana to thicken it. The flavor was great before and after the banana, but the texture was very gritty. I'm not sure what caused the grittiness, but it definitely wasn't the banana. I wouldn't bother making this without a powerful blender.

yum! used few less dates, added small banana. ate along with 1/2 cup natural whole almonds for a very filling meal.

Absolutely yummy. I used whole milk and regular yogurt.Might be just as good nonfat because the dates are what makes this smoothie very very very good.

Made this today and it was very very good. previous snooty reviewer, it's not about whats complicated, but what tastes good. Dates in a smoothie are innovative and delicous.

Okay, so I made this from memory and of course there was a major memory lapse. I added no ice, no vanilla, used only 7 dates (they're called YADD dates and they are very big,soft and plump, so blend easily) and used vanilla flavored soymilk (which has sugar added) instead of milk. And, I didn't share. Yummy!

I really enjoyed this recipe. Unfortunately I thought I bought seedless dates and I broke my blender :(

This is a nice change from the daily berry smoothie and a good use of the dates that we get from our CSA. The dates make the consistency a little gritty but if made with lowfat milk and yogurt it tastes like a creamy vanilla milkshake.

This is good - an easy breakfast or snack. Would recommend chopping dates a bit first (if using whole) as my blender made quick work of the ice but didn't do as well with the dates.

I loved this the way I made it, which was full fat. Think it might br a little thin tasting with nonfat. Everything else is. I don't do nonfat.

I have good memories of being in the Coachella Valley in California and having date shakes. These aren't bad, but if you're looking for something super creamy and luscious, this isn't it...it's for the calorie and diet conscious. That being said, they're nutritious and a good way to start the day.

Too sweet. With fewer dates it might be passable. Tastes like an over sweet vanilla milkshake. Most of my family didn't like it.

Very yummy and refreshing. I had to add a little bit of sugar for my taste. I bought dates in bulk and next time I make this, I will cut each date in half to make sure there are no pits. I was afraid that one might have gotten in there as the blender was a bit loud. Delicious !

I tried this recipe just because I had some nearly dried out generic (not Mejdool) at hand and no idea what to do with them. I used low fat milk and yogurt as I don't do nonfat and I eyeballed all the ingredients. The result was simply scrumptious.
