Surprisingly, I liked it and so did hubby who hates rice and coconut. And it does go well with Jerk Chicken, which is spicy, so this doesn't need to be. Very interested in the suggestion to put Scotch Bonnet in whole & fish out at end - Thanks! Definitely do again. Makes a lot.

Being of West Indian origin, I find this recipe interesting, but not authentic. Firstly the vegetable broth is a big no. The rice should be cooked in just the coconut milk, (about 2 parts to 3 parts water) water, thyme and pimento (allspice) and a decent amount of salt. DO NOT STIR OFTEN - this is what causes the risotto consistency. Check the rice often by tasting and add more liquid as needed. Substitute the jalapeño for a scotch bonnet pepper. Do not cut, place in whole and take out before serving. The rice is not supposed to be spicy. The use of onions is optional but defiantly don't serve with raw onions on top.

Filling, but a little bland. I liked the consistency, especially with five more minutes of fairly high heat at the end to thicken it up; I added the juice of a lemon and a lot more salt after taking the dish off the heat, which helped pick up the flavors.

Ugh. Consistency wasn't bad--basically like risoto. I used black beans & lite coconut milk. I think it's the coconut milk that makes it taste weird. what a waste.

I doubled the spices and beans and this did make for a hearty dish. Still, needed something so I cooked some kielbasa to serve with it which went very well. I do not think I would make this recipe again but that does not mean it was bad, just not great.

Horrible, tasteless glop. Really. I added everything I could think of and it was still bland and unappealing. Blech.

Wonderful recipe. The sweetness and spice complement each other beautifully.

a little dull would be bored if that was my meal we added a jerk shrimp and that helped not spicy enough

I tried this recipe out of curiosity, and got nervous when it initially hit the pan, smelling completely unlike what I expected, but was amazed when I finally got it to the table. This recipe gave me serious 'vegan envy'! It doesn't need meat, but for those who won't eat without it, I recommend chorizo or maybe grilled shrimp.

This was very good and easy.

i make this pretty often to accompany jerk tofu. it's quite good, though i do my own version and agree with many of the suggestions. i use water and a whole can of coconut milk, no veg broth. it's a nice sweet-spicy dish. try some lime juice in it at the end.

Love this recipe! I usually use black beans because I like them better than kidney beans. It brings me back to home (Virgin Islands) ever time I make it!

This was disappointing, bland, gloppy (not in a good way as risotto is) and, as my daughter said, "like something that came from a box". I won't make it again.

This was just delicious, and SO easy. Serving with avocado/orange salad was an excellent suggestion, and we found that even putting a few slices of avocado on top of the rice/beans enhanced the dish.

this rice is delicious! Sorry I hate kidney beans so I used black beans instead. It was amazing I couldn't stop eating it. It is definately a bit more gluey after it has cooled but still very good.

This has been a favorite of ours since it came out in the mag about 8 years ago. Very reliable and quick. Make as directed -- green onions and red beans are key, as is some fresh pepper.

This was an excellent side dish to complement a Carribean-style main dish. To make it even spicier, we added some Cayenne pepper. We also doubled the jalepeno and all-spice. Lite coconut milk worked great!

I must admit I was very untrusting of the amount of liquid to rice in this dish, but I knew the other Epi reviewers wouldn't let me down. It made perfectly tender rice and I loved it. I couldn't find my allspice so I used a half a cinnamon stick and a little bit of ground cloves. Made this as a side dish so only put in half the amount of beans and used basmati (not a creamy rice, but cooked perfectly and didn't break the grains up as I was expecting). Used lite coconut milk so you really couldn't taste it, so next time I would use twice as much or go with the good full fat stuff! Basically, I think you can substitute at whim with this recipe and always end up with a succulent rice dish.

Mieh... not nuts about it. Had no fresh hot peppers, so I liberally used cayenne flakes; I used black-eyed peas, too, added halfway through cooking. The texture was good, and the rice was perfectly tender. BBQd pineapple made it immensely better. It wasn't bad, but not outstanding. Maybe I'm just not a coconut/allspice kinda guy.

This recipe needs a little work but is very good and easy. I've made it a couple of times and it is good idea to add the beans halfway through. I also doubled jalapeno b/c i like heat. I add about a TBLS of diced ginger and I substituted 1 cup of orange juice for the chicken stock. This adds a nice sweet acidic flavor that complements well. Also make sure it cools down before you eat b/c the flavors really develop. A great week day meal and better for lunch the next day!

Excellent and very easy, perfect for a mid-week, vegetarian meal. We'll make this again.

I'm not sure if it's because I couldn't eat it right away, but this was both gluey and bland. I think the gluey issue would be solved by not waiting to eat it, but I think it needs more spices or something to get rid of the blandness. It smelled awesome while it was cooking though!

This was okay. Granted, I accidentally put some chile seeds in the pot which made it REALLY spicy (and I have a high heat tolerance). To counter the heat, I added extra coconut milk at the end which did temper the spice, but it made the dish too coconutty. My boyfriend LOVED this stuff, though and ate a huge portion of it w/ gusto. I wouldn't make it for myself, but I'd make it again for him if he really wanted it.

I have made this a couple of times, and love it more each time. I am not a vegetarian or health food nut, so for me taste matters most (yum yum!). Last time I made it I *doubled* the recipe and came up with my best variation yet! I started off by frying one whole chopped onion (omitted green onion), a couple of jalepenos, and 2 cloves of garlic in some butter and bacon fat until tender. Then, I added the broth (I like asian vegetable broth best - more flavor), coconut milk, spices & rice (used basmati). Added 1 can each black and pink beans at last minute, added additional spices to taste, and topped with cilantro and lime creme (sour cream with lime zest and juice).

My 8 year old really liked this. We used 1 day old brown rice and omitted the stock. It was great.

This was a nice compliment to the 'Jerk Chicken' recipe on this site (Gourmet, 2002). We added 2X Jalepeno & toasted coconut at the end.

Rating: 4
We made this recipie along with a jerk Chicken dish. A perfect combination. I took the advice of others and doubled the jalapeño chili peppers. In addition, I added fresh minced coconut, and did not add the red beans until the end. The recipe had very complex flavors that came in waves. It was excellent.

Rating: 2
I added roasted pineapple as a side and loved it (I would have given it 3 forks, but I'm a push over!) My husband wasn't as fond of it as I was. He added some brown sugar to it, making it perfect for his taste. I think it has to do with his Washington taste vs my Virgin Islands taste:) I'm going to play with the spices some more.

Four thumbs up from my husband and me. A yummy and filling dish that serves two just right. I'm not crazy about kidney beans so I substituted half black and half pink beans from Goya, and added them once the rice was nearly done, with great results. Also doubled the allspice and diced jalapeno as advised. I served the rice in a shallow bowl ringed by chunks of broiled canned pineapple (I'd had in the cupboard forever) and sliced banana pieces fried in a little butter, salt, and pepper. "My kinda meal," my husband pronounced.

WOW! This and the Jerk Chicken (Gourmet, May '02) were my favorites at our recent Caribbean theme party. I added a little coconut extract and next time will add more peppers like other reviewers have mentioned. Delicious.

I more than doubled the amount of jalepeno, and that helped. Overall, though, the recipe didn't excite me. I might make it again on a weeknight when I have coconut milk to use up, but I wouldn't serve it to company.

Yuck!! Bland and mushy! Never again!

DELICIOUS! I used veggie broth with onions as it was all they had in the store, and it really added a great touch. Upped the spices a little and it was just amazing. I had no problem with red kidney beans getting mushy. I meant to wait to add them and forgot....no ill effects!!!

I thought the flavor was excellent and tasted very authentic. The rice was even great the next day warmed up.

I, too, served this dish with the jerk chicken; it complemented it very well. I added just a little salt to bring out the flavors, though. It seemed to do the trick. Anything but bland...

I did this recipe in a rice cooker--I doubled the amount of rice and spices, and added a total of 1 can ch. stock and 1 can light coconut milk, then added the beans when the rice was done. It made a good side dish with a spicy fish recipe.

Delicious and easy to make. My picky husband loved it! Perfect with the jerk chicken recipe.

I think that this dish was delicious and that it had a lot of flavor, but that the flavor was very mild (and I more than doubled the jalapenos). So I added some cayenne pepper at the end, and it was even better.

I served this as a side dish and omitted the beans. My guest really liked it. I would add more jalapenos if you want more heat.

Delicious and different. Liked by veggies and nonveggies alike. Good also if you want to add additional vegetables (i.e. eggplant or broccoli). As is, the recipe needs spicing up - it's a bit bland.

Outstanding recipe! I doubled the peppers, using serranos instead of jalapenos, and substituted shallots for green onion for a slightly richer flavour. Works really well with the jerk chicken recipe.

Rating: 4
i loved everything about this dish--the creamy with the crunchy of the uncooked scallions, the sweet of the coconut milk against the hot of the serranos (i didn't have any jalapenos left). i served it with "jerk chicken" (gourmet, february 1993) and "fruit salad with poppy seed dressing"(bon appetit, march 1996). great meal.

This recipe is simple and delicious! I use black beans instead of kidney beans; they hold up very well, never getting mushy. This dish tastes great with a side of broiled pineapple- a nice spicy and sweet combination.

I made this with double jalepeno and kept the beans out until about halfway through cooking. It turned out well and the beans didn't get mushy. Several friends had some and they all liked it.

This is very easy and good. I followed another reviewers suggestion and doubled the jalapeno. I am making it again this weekend for 75 people.

This recipe has potential. If I made it again I would double the jalapeno and the allspice and not add the beans. I found they got very mushy and took away from the consistency of the rice.

This is delicious!!! What a pleasant surprise. It IS creamy, and the flavors are such a nice blend - nothing was overpowering. It was definitely not bland. (also: I used chicken broth i/o vegetable broth as it's what I had on hand.)
