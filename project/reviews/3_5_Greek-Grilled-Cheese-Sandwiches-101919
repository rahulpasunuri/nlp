Loved this version of a grilled cheese! Such a wonderful strong flavor and it just melts in your mouth... the olive oil on the bread instead of the butter was great, something I'll do more often from now on.

I made it for my Mother and myself for lunch and we both had seconds. Very unusual for my Mother to ask for more.

What a nice twist on ordinary grilled cheese sandwiches! Quick and easy to prepare, the sandwich is a wonderful blend of juiciness and tartness. I used sliced Italian bread and fresh thyme, which added a subtle taste to the results. This makes a great breakfast sandwich.

Never met a grilled cheese sandwich I didn't like. This was no exception. Fabulous flavors, this is one to keep in the rotation.

Wonderful! Baked instead of fried...a big hit.

We loved this. I used tomato basil feta which really gave it a kick. Great vegetarian sandwich. My husband, who is strictly meat and potatoe, loved it.

Wonderful! I added sliced pitted Kalamata olives. A lovely Greek grilled sandwich.

Made these on Kalamata olive bread, they were absolutely delicious. Will do them again SOON.

Finally, a vegetarian sandwich with some pizzazz! I brushed the olive oil onto the bread, but didn't put any in the skillet. I also covered the skillet so that the cheese would melt better (I cooked it longer than 2 minutes per side, as well). All four of the people I served it to loved it.

Fantastic! I've served these sandwiches, quartered, along with a selection of others (salmon & sour cream horshradish, cheese-stuffed hamburgers, etc) for a very interesting buffet-style dinner party.

This is really a "make again"! I substituted fresh basil leaves for oregano and my family loved it.

Rich! The feta, olives and olive oil make this an extremely flavorful sandwich. Serve it with a less rich accompaniment, such as a light soup or salad, and you have a great, quick, easy vegetarian meal.
