I liked the turkey, but not the ancho gravy -- too strong.

I haven't made either recipe yet, however, as I'm searching for possible Thanksgiving recipes I found a recipe, also on Epicurious, similar to this one, but with better reviews: Achiote Butter-Basted Turkey with Ancho Chili Gravy

I ran out of ancho chiles, so substituted one ounce of dried red California chiles and one ounce of dried black pasilla chiles for 1/2 of the ancho. I think this rounded out the chile flavors. I made most of the Southwest Thanksgiving menu for our family's Christmas dinner. We had eleven people with some very disparate tastes in food, and the only complaint I heard was that some were too full to eat more! I would definitely make this again, but with a couple of modifications. Like the reviewer "Cook from New York" I also brimed the turkey (and used a fresh, no-additives bird). I will take his/her suggestion to cook breast side down the first hour and add more chocolate. I will also used the mix of ancho, pasilla and Califronia peppers again, and add more orange juice to the basting liquid. One caveat: this turkey will brown very quickly. We needed to tent ours for about 1/3 the cook time.

All our turkeys must now meet the standard set by the Creole butter/jambalaya stuffing recipe from Bon Appetit many years ago. This year's Southwest turkey was fine, but not as good as we all anticipated. I think that the results didn't justify all the preparation effort it required.

The Turkey browned very quickly but otherwise cooked perfectly. The sauce was plentiful and delicious.

This recipe turned out fantastic. I brined the turkey and also cooked it for the first hour breast side down, and it came out unbelievably moist. The anchos were a tiny bit too much, and I would probably put in more chocolate next time to round up the taste. But this will likely become my thanksgiving turkey recipe from now on.
