I made this for Thanksgiving appetizer and was very disappointed. The proportion of radicchio to goat cheese was all wrong, so there were little islands of goat cheese of beds of gray, limp radicchio. It tasted better than it looked, but not by much.It did not go over well with the guests and half of it was thrown away. If I were to make it again, I would halve the radicchio and double the cheese, but really, there are better recipes out there.

I love this recipe. The mellow goat cheese, melted on the roast raddicchio with the toasted garlic and herbs is great. Grind some salt on it before serving, along with the salt. One thought i had was that some reduced balsamic drizzled on top before serving could be good, but I like acid with raddicchio. Really, it's great as is. This would be a very nice room temp picnic food.

I enjoyed this so much that it ended up being my dinner because I ate practically the whole thing....This is great with white wine and good company!!!!!!!

Very easy, and good -- but serve with thin slices of toasted bread for best flavor
