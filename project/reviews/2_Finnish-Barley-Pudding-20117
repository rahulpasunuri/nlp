P.S. skip the pepper!

This is not meant to be anything else but breakfast porridge. I used to eat it with my mom's blueberry preserves. Yum!

Made this recipe not knowing what to expect. I think it makes another alternative to having rice with a dish and it's filling as well.

The dish was very creamy and I liked the texture of the cooked barley, but just two steps above library paste. If I were to make it again, I'd plan to serve it with a highly seasoned beef or pork dish with a gravy/sauce and horseradish or sauerkraut. In my opinion it is a winter fill-up and stick to the ribs dish.
