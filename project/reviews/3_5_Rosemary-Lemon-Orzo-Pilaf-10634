I served this as a side to Chicken Francaise. The fresh flavors really complimented the dish. I used just 1/2 cup orzo and adjusted the water to 1/2 cup as well. Next time I will definitely add some grated lemon peel as others have suggested.

A nice lemony pilaf that works well with certain foods. Thanks for the suggestion of adding lemon zest and pine nuts. I also added a lot more chopped rosemary at the end. For presentation, it needs color, so parsley or other green herbs really perks it up.

This dish went exceptionally well with a Greek style grilled chicken. I thought it looked a little pale, so I added about 8 ounces of spinach to give it a nutritional boost. It was good that way. I, like the others reversed the amount of broth to water as well. I used an especially rich stock and it made the dish really rich.

This is a great side dish with a fresh lemon flavor. I followed suggestions below and added the lemon zest, roasted pine nuts and fresh, chopped parsley at the end. I'm adding this to my Thanksgiving menu.

Very tasty, but wound up having way too much liquid. The orzo couldn't absorb it all, and it wound up being a bit mushy. Just cutting back on the liquid would fix it.

This was a really good recipe. I used all chicken broth as suggested and added zest, parsely and pine nuts. Great blend of flavors and really easy because you get to throw most of the ingredients in at once. Next time I might try adding some feta cheese right before I serve it. A keeper.

This was great. Just goes to prove that a recipe doesn't have to have 40 ingredients and be complicated to make to be good. Simple and tasty. Will definetly be making this again.

I used the suggestion to add pine nuts and lemon zest. I also used all chicken broth (low sodium) in place of water. My husband said it had a nice lemon "kick", but wasn't crazy about it overall. I loved it and my 21 year-old son also enjoyed it. The dinner guests ate it up too. I even enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day. I will make this again - but only when we have company so hubby has to eat it!

I thought this was a great recipe, although the portions are a little small. I didn't find it to be bland at all, given that it is a side dish. I wouldn't want it's flavor to compete with the main course, just to compliment it. It was an excellent accompaniment to the Chicken Costa del Sol (also on the site).

I reverse the amounts for stock and water. This is a staple at my house - especially good for company w/ kids. Kids and adults like it.

This has become a staple. I use homemake chicken stock when on hand. As suggested, use the stock in place of water. Love rosemary so I always add a little more. Probably add more lemon, too. Love it!

I quadrupled the recipe and served it at a dinner party with chicken scarpariello -- it went very well. Next time, if I serve it with something less spicy and saucy, I'll definitely use more lemon juice and add lemon zest. The rosemary flavor was perfect, but it could have been much much more lemony.

This was not bland at all. I made the following adjustments; I used chicken broth in place of the water and did not add any salt. In the last five minutes of cooking I added about 1 tsp of lemon zest based on the bland comments. This was simple and very flavorful. The orzo was very creamy and did not need anything else. I cooked it for the full 15 minutes but watched carefully. Served this with grilled wild salmon and sauteed spinach and garlic. Very tasty.

I found this recipe to be very bland. It certainly is easy to make but it was pretty uninteresting.

Easy and tasty--served with broiled lamb chops with rosemary-mint sauce--also on this website. Would definitely make again.

Everyone in my family loved this dish. Like some others, I used all chicken broth for the liquid. I also added a bit more rosemary. Delicious.

I modified this recipe as follows: Sub'd vegetable for chicken broth; after cooking I thought it needed a little extra broth, and I also mixed in about a tablespoon fresh chopped parsley and about a 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts before serving. It was perfect with grilled salmon & steamed asparagus.

This was sooooo bland. I increased the lemon juice and rosemary, added salt and pepper -- still not acceptable. So glad I didn't make it for company--it would have been an embarrassment!

Try mixing the orzo with an equal serving of cooked wild rice. Rather than use rosemary, I used fresh cilantro, a dash of freshly ground pepper and some thinly sliced sauteed (with garlic)mushrooms that I had leftover. It made a nice combination.

On the advice of those who have gone before, I used all low-salt chicken broth. My boyfriend bought the orzo and it was a different brand--almost a completely different shape--than what I normally buy. The result was sub-par--heavy, round noodles, almost like tiny pierogis! That may be why the dish only rec's 2 forks from me. Next time I will use more rosemary too. Served this with the Chicken Costa del Sol recipe on this site.

I doubled the lemon and added crumbles of goat feta cheese - be careful with the cooking time - it doesn't take quite as long as recommended - and it needs to be served right away.

I took the advice of others and used all chicken broth. I thought it was okay, not great. My husband thought it was "bland". It seemed to need something more. Perhaps I'll up the rosemary and lemon next time.

Good side dish. We took advice from Phoenix cook below and just made it with all chicken broth. Our 3-year-old liked it, big deal for us! Served with Epicurious "Grilled Lamb Chops with Salmoriglio Sauce", a super receipe.

FAST AND DELICIOUS! (Cooks faster than the 15 minutes noted.) I met, and cooked dinner, for my boyfriend's parents for the first time and served this dish with the Chicken Breasts with sun-dried tomato and garlic crust (found on this site) and had one of the easiest and most delicious dinners. It passed the parent test. I think they LOVE me now.

I agree with some of the other reviewers that using 100% chicken stock and not adding the salt was the right way to go. I would certainly increase the amount of lemon juice next time (at least doubling it). I improvised and made the pilaf with half orzo and half long-grain rice. It was a nice combination and I would make this dish again. It was a good foil for chicken, but I think would work equally well with almost any type of main dish.

Like some other reviewers, I used chicken broth (low sodium)for the entire amount of liquid called for. I strongly recommend testing the doneness of the orzo well before the 15 minute simmering process is completed. Mine was done in less than 10 minutes. (Consider how long you cook your usual pasta.) I added 2 tablespoons of toasted pine nuts; otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter except for the timing. I felt it needed no additional salt except for the 1/4 teaspoon called for. This orzo dish was delicious, accompanied by a grilled leg of lamb for Easter dinner.

This was good. It's fast and easy. And much better for you than Rice Roni or the like I'm sure.

So creamy and delicious. I added an extra 4 tbl. lemon juice towards the end of cooking time, lots of salt too. Do not add extra rosemary, there is plenty called for. I tripled the recipe and it still came out perfect in the exact cooking time called for. YUM!!!!

I always have orzo on hand and it's nice to find a new way to prepare it. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I like the basic flavors of the ingredients and appreciate this dish just as it is without adding more of any of them. Subtle and fresh. Serving it with a marinated turkey mignon wrapped in bacon tonight! KIMBER

The good news - my kids and husband liked this very well, and it's relatively simple and fast to prepare. The bad news is that I brought it to a potluck, and hardly anyone ate it! There was lots left over! I'll serve it to the family again, as it's a nice change from packaged rice mixes.

SOOOO Good! I added chopped garlic while I was toasting it and also used chicken broth dor the entire liquid portion. My boyfriend always compliments me lots on my cooking, but he loved this side dish so much that he requested it for the very next meal!

This was my first orzo dish and it was very yummy. However, I found that it needed more oomph so when it was done I added more lemon, cayenne pepper flakes and freshly grated parmesean cheese. Looks like it would be tasty cold, too, with some peas and maybe halved cherry tomatoes added.

Rating: 3
As the previous reviews mentioned, it's extremely easy. If you like rosemary, then this is the recipe for you! Using 3/4 cup of uncooked orzo wasn't very much, and, as a consequence, I altered the amount of chicken stock, lemon and rosemary to compensate. I then discovered that you can enhance one flavor over another (i.e. if you want a real lemony taste), depending upon your preference. Enjoy!

This dish was easy and quick to make, but looked and tasted wonderful. It's good enough to serve to guests. I'll definitely make it again.

This was a very easy, quick and good side dish. I served it with some grilled chicken breasts. Instead of water I used canned chicked broth for the entire liquid.
