This chili got raves at our Super Bowl party, and I'm about to make it again. Scaled up the recipe for 8-10 and used chicken stock (homemade) instead of bean juice as others have suggested. Also threw in a little extra cumin and oregano. Heat level was fine for our group, which didn't include any real pepperhounds. The best part about this recipe is how it ages -- three or four days later, not only was the taste sublime, but the chicken thighs had taken on the consistency of pulled pork. This is where using dark meat is the real winner.

This is my favorite chili, exactly as it's written. I've used boneless breasts as well as thighs and can say that both are good, but the thighs hold up better to the spices. I have also followed this recipe using ground meats, and will try it next with chunked chuck. It's the proportions of spices that I like. For those who want hotter, or for those who want less hot, the "heat" is easily moderated, making this a good, basic chili recipe.

Rating: 4
My favorite chili. I make it often and rarely change a thing about the recipe, although the recipe is flexible and adapts to uses of beef, chicken breasts (the thighs are better, though) or ground meats.

Rating: 3
Nice alternative to beef chili. Followed the suggestions of others and substituted bean juice with chicken broth. Used cayenne instead of regular chili powder; red pepper instead of green. Also added 1 1/2 tbsp of smoky bbq sauce (idea borrowed from my regular chili recipe).

Yummy, made this chili today but didn't have white beans so used Romano beans instead and added some cajun spice and grand marsala, Delish...

As many others have noted, this recipe would be 1 star without some significant changes. Taking cues from those reviewers, I added 1 jalapeno [would up it to 2-3 next time], doubled the cumin & oregano, used 1 cup of chicken broth i/o the bean juice & added sugar & hot pepper flakes. Without these changes it is bland & flavorless, with them, it is delicious!

We used ground chicken and halved the recipe. Pretty tasty, looking forward to eating it for lunch.

I've been making this for years- always gets good reviews. I do not bother saving the bean juices and use chicken broth or water instead. I have also skipped the chicken thighs and tossed in cubed cooked leftover turkey at the end: equally tasty. A dollop of sour cream and chopped cilantro make the final dish delicious.

I actually reviewed this recipe a few years ago, but will do so again as it's become a real fall staple in our house, and I've made it probably a dozen times. I use breast meat or dark just depending on what we have on hand, and it's equally delicious either way. I always add a small can of diced chiles to up the heat factor and add a little acidity which is needed, and I sometimes leave out the bell pepper if I don't have one. Adjust the seasonings to your taste as the recipe cooks, because tastes vary (I tend to like my chili on the bolder side). We always serve this with shredded sharp cheddar, sliced scallions and chopped cilantro, light sour cream and tortilla chips (Soy and Flax chips from Trader Joe's are great), all on the side so everyone can top theirs as they like. Easy, delicious and fairly healthy, this is a definite keeper! It also freezes and reheats well!

I made this with the recommended chicken thighs, but the thighs were too fatty and too difficult to clean. I would use ground chicken in the future. The chlili flavor was fine

Rating: 3
What can I say? This recipe is a great start but needs a little more. I borrowed the charred Anaheim peppers from the "blue ribbon" recipe (looks delicious but about 1/4th as healthy), added extra spices and some cayenne (and Rotel tomatoes!) Also, I used chicken thighs with bone and skin on, trimmed them of these, threw the remains into a pot woth, and added onion and celery to make a stock to reduce the soup instead of bean-water - huge improvement in flavor!

Yum, yum, yum. Great flavor, easy to make, and it's quick to make, too!

This chili is delicious and perfect for someone who either doesn't like most chili's or doesn't like a whole lot of spice. There is just enough heat for you to notice and enjoy, and all of the ingredients taste wonderful together! Plus, it's very easy to make and doesn't leave you with a bunch of dirty dishes.

My new husband loved this recipe! Before he was half way thru his first bowl he said 3 times that he 'loved this recipe and I should make this again". I did substitute sun dried tomatoes for the tomato paste and I ran out of chili powder so only used 2 Tbl but used some red pepper flakes, left out the bell peppers, and used a whole rotisserie chicken. As recommended, I used chicken broth instead of bean juice. It was great for my lunch today.

Rating: 3
Really good stuff, and as far as healthy chili recipes go, this doesn't really need any substitutions or improvement. I loved the cubed chicken (I trimmed most of the excess fat and used my kitchen shears to cut the rest of the meat -- time consuming, but great end result), but can understand why other reviewers may have used ground chicken for texture and ease of preparation. I did find that, obviously when compared to traditional chilis, that this recipe lacked a certain depth of flavor. To remedy that, I plan on substituting (or just combining it in with everything else) a can of mild chili beans, adding an ~ounce of mexican chocolate (the cinnamon in mexican chocolate is perfect for chili), and a tablespoon or so of instant coffee. All in all, however I end up making this, I do plan on making it again and again. Such a great meal to add to the weekly rotation (and it's even better reheated!).

Rating: 4
Excellent. Basically followed the recipe, but I wanted a little spicier chili than the reviews indicated this was, so I used 2 roasted poblanos instead of the green bell pepper, a can of Ro-tel in place of one of the cans of tomatoes, and threw in a can of roasted green chilis. Phenomenal flavor.

So pleased with this recipe. Both my husband and I are die-hard chili fans; we were extremely reluctant to try a chicken chili. This exceeded our expectations! I used just a splash of bean juice and substituted chicken broth for the rest; added 3 jalapenos with ribs and seeds; omitted bell pepper; added a pinch of cayenne pepper, red pepper flakes, and sugar; and the juice of half of a lime. Will definitely make again.

This is a great staple to put in your dinner dish rotation. It's super simple and low maintenance to cook. I will say it's bland if you follow this recipe exactly. I give it a 4 Fork rating with a 1/2 can of chipotle peppers. I've also added more cumin and a jalapeno with good results.

This recipe is FANTASTIC, especially as a leftover. The flavors have time to meld, it has a nice kick, and it's not overwhelmingly spicy for most tastes. I'll be making this instead of traditional beef chili from now on. Thank you so much!

Just made this recipe b/c w/ the history making snow falling in our area we'll need something hardy to eat while watching the Super Bowl. I made one change and followed others advice. I had a whole turkey breast which I had partially cooked. I cut into diced meat and added that to this recipe. Since I had so much meat I used both cans of beans and tomatoes. In addition I used a whole (small) can of tomato paste and lots of cilantro. Boy is the flavor delicious w/ just a slight kick. Oh yeah, I too added a can of chopped chilis and let it simmer much longer than the 25 minutes suggested. The sauce is slightly thicker and will be really yummy on Sunday. (Now to start shoveling out of this snow mess.)

Rating: 4
This was a HUGE hit at last year's Superbowl Party and I had so many requests for it that I'm making it again for the same crowd..Something I rarely do. I use whatever chicken I have handy, not just thighs. The recipe doubles very well but be careful with the age of your dried spices. I make sure that I have several varieties of Hot Sauces for my guests. If you don't have too many people or you have a large prep area consider serving in hollowed individual round loaves of bread.\

Great recipe! I used the following variations from earlier reviewers: I cut up a rotisserie chicken; used chicken stock instead of bean juice; added the juice of 1 lime; used Ro-Tel diced tomatoes (Mexican style with lime and cilantro), and topped with shredded cheddar cheese. I did use the full amount of chili powder. Active time for me was 1 hour, not 25 minutes. Will make this again! Thank you to all the prior reviewers for your suggestions.

I made this last night and was very pleased with the result. I used leftover roast chicken breats rather than thighs. I followed what others suggested and used 2-2.5tbs chili powder, drained the beans substituting chicken stock, used only one can of tomatoes and tossed in a can of chopped mild green chilis. I forgot the cilantro, even though I bought it specifically for the chili. I will definately make this again...and hopefully not forget to top with cilantro! It was delicious!

This is a favorite winter dish of mine and I should remember to prepare it more often. I use 1 large onion, just 1/2 Tbsp cumin. I omit the bell pepper since it doesn't agree with me, and I do not drain the beans. Add red chili flakes and black pepper for some heat.

Used cooked cubed chicken breast instead of thighs, and substituted canned chopped green chiles for the bell pepper. It's better the second day if you let the flavors meld overnight in the fridge. To garnish, sprinkle a little shredded cheddar-Jack cheese and additional chopped cilantro over the chili, with a dollop of sour cream if you like it. This one is a keeper for those cold winter nights when you want something hearty to eat.

Made this last night both hubby and 3yr old son loved it. I used chicken breast to lighten it up, and used 1 can of tomatoes and 1 can of beans it was enough. Have been requested to make this again.

Loved it. I made a few tiny adjustments - Used juice of whole lime, only 1.25 lbs chicken thighs (all i had), only 2 tablespoons chili powder, 1.5 tablespoons cumin, rinsed beans per others suggestions. Did not have tomato paste but added some chicken broth to provide some liquid. Also added corn per others suggestions. My husband ate 3 bowls and my 2 young children gobbled it up! I will definitely make it again. Oh - and only used one can of tomatoes.

Made this for my husband who literally whined when I told him it was white bean and chicken as opposed to the usual beef chili. Boy was he surprised at how delicious this was! I used chicken breast meat as that was all we had on hand. Still came out great but next time I'll use dark as that's what we usually prefer anyway. Garnished it with a little low-fat sour cream, chopped cilantro and sliced green onions. Really a great, healthy, one-pot meal!

This chili quickly found a spot in our regular rotation. Comfort food without the guilt. However, the first time I made it I realized I was out of chili powder after I had started cooking. I substituted curry powder and while the chili version was delicious...I find myself sticking to my accidental curry version more often than not.

I used a rotisserie chicken and "shredded" all usable white/dark meat. I used the red pepper substitution recommended in another review and added 2 tbls of mild green chiles and 2 chipotle peppers. I also prepared this the day before, letting it simmer for several hours before serving -- the flavors really melded. Easy and awesome!!!

Rating: 0
What a disappointment - the ingredient proportions are grossly unbalanced - far too much chili powder and tomatoes for such a small (relatively) quantity of beans. Fortunately I made it several days before planning to serve at a superbowl party which gave me time to scrap it and replace it with a more palatable dish. Never will I try this one again - I threw the recipe away.

I was quite happy with this dish. I used cubed chicken breasts instead of thighs and I used a yellow pepper instead of a green one. Next time I might try poaching the chicken and shredding it beforehand instead of cubing it. I would also skip the additional bean juice or add as needed, as mine came out a little more soupy than I was expecting.

Won 1st Place on November 8, 2009 Chili Contest! Sooo good. Added an 8 oz can mild green chilis, 1 Serrano Chili, and the juice of one lime. This will make it very spicy. Leave out extra chili if wanting a milder flavor. Delicious.

I really loved this recipe! Used cubed skinless breasts, subbed vegetable broth for the bean liquid, added a half tsp minced chipotle peppers and 2 heaping Tbs of chopped green chilies for more zest. Let it simmer, covered, for a few hrs - not soupy at all, in fact I had to add liquid at the end. Will definitely make again.

Love this chili. This time I added canned baby corn. Used poached chicken breasts. Prefer chicken thighs. Don't add too much cilantro to the chili--not everyone appreciates its virtues. Served more on the side for those of us that would wear it if it was in perfume form.

My family loved this, and I made just a few changes. Used only enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan and slightly increased the seasonings & garlic. Rather than the stuff from the canned beans, I used chicken broth (thought it might need a cornstarch slurry to thicken because of this, but it was fine) and ended up letting it simmer for about an hour. We don't care for green peppers, so I subbed a cubanelle and a couple "baby" red & orange peppers. Delicious.

Did I do something wrong? why did people say it was mild?

I use skinless boneless chicken thighs and as little oil as possible. If I have them on hand I add a wee bit of chipotle chili puree which adds as nice mello spice. Since my girls don't like chunks of anything in their sauce I puree the tomato with the sauteed peppers and onions. It is a very nice dish to bring on a canoe trip!

I made this recipe in the afternoon and left it simmering on the stove over the lowest flame for about 2 hours, til we were finally ready for dinner. This only enhanced the flavor more.

soooo very good. I have made this multiple times and it is by far my favorite chili. I like hot chili, so I added some extra chili powder and some cajun. I also added about a Tablespoon of unsweetened cocoa which I saw in another chili recipe and it added that "extra something". I added grated cheddar cheese with the cilantro and served with crusty bread. DELICIOUS!

I made this yesterday for a family birthday party, with cornbread on the side. I tripled it to feed about 20 people. It turned out great. I pretty much made it as written. I intended to serve the cilantro on the side, but forgot to put it out. A few of us added sour cream and cheddar cheese to ours with good results. I would perhaps add another can of beans or so. It's very mild, so if you're a fan of hot chili, adjust accordingly. Will make this again.

This recipe is WONDERFUL for a mid-week dinner as it requires next to no fresh ingredients, little chopping, and only ONE dirty dish! The second time, we added two more cans of beans to give it the variety of three different types of beans. (I thought one extra can was enough, but my husband thought that four was great.) We forgot the chopped cilantro on the kitchen counter but both agreed that it was great without it.

I made this chili for a football party we had the other day, and it was a huge hit! I first browned 1 lb of hot pork sausage, then sauteed the pepper, onion, and garlic is the grease from the sausage (there wasn't much), then cooked the chicken with that mixture (I used 3 large breasts instead of thighs) I didn't use the oil at all. I dumped all that into my crock pot, added an addtional 2 cans of black beans and two cans of corn (drained) let it simmer on low for about 6 hours. Outstanding!

Rating: 3
This was great and really easy for a weeknight. I browned about 4-6 oz hot pork sausage first and sauteed veggies in that - skipped the 1/4 cup of oil to compensate. I chopped chicken tenders instead of thighs and added an extra can of diced tomatoes. Upped the spices a bit to compensate. Otherwise, no changes. Definitely recommended!

Well, I usually agree wholeheartedly with the 4 forkers...probably because I only make recipes that have consistently high ratings. So I have to say I wasn't overwhelmed with this recipe although it was good enough. Perhaps I used too much chicken (which I poached and shredded in advance) but there was so little broth that I kept adding chicken stock. It was a nice enough dish, hearty, to be sure but not a WOW. I have been hosting a monthly Soup Sunday and this is the first one where my guests did not ask for the recipe.

I've made this twice. The first time I boiled the chicken then something came up in the middle of it, so I had to dump the chicken in a ziploc and freeze it for a week or so. When I thawed it out to add to the recipe, it came out in fine stringy pieces, which my family loved. The frozen chicken also had more moisture in it, so I didn't add any liquid. I made it again over the weekend. Again, I boiled the thighs, but used them immediately. The meat was not nearly as finely separated. I had to add some bean juice as well. I did not like the flavor of the bean juice, and will use broth in the future. We didn't like the consistency of the chicken as well either. So, I advise boiling the chicken until it literally falls apart or else freeze it, and add broth for the liquid. I also prefer great northern beans to navy beans.

I was hesitant to try this recipe. My husband didn't seem thrilled by the idea of white bean & chicken in his chili, but I made it anyway based on the reviews and he LOVED it.

Only minor changes (based on what we had in the freezer and cupboard) -- more onions (2 cups) and tomato paste (2 heaping tbsps); only 1 3/4 tbsps chile powder (that's all we had, but this was fine for our tastes); used combination of thighs and a breast. Used Bush's Great Northern white beans -- no extra juice, but didn't need any. Will make again as the weather turns colder....

This is the best chili recipe that I have ever tasted. I used half a bottle of beer as well as the cup of reserved bean liquid and it was perfect. This one goes to the head of my list!!!! YUM!

I used ground turkey and cooked it like the recipe said and then added some chunks of chiken that I sauteed in a little butter and olive oil with some garlic to make up the last pound of chicken. Used one can black and one white and would add a third can next time. Added the jalapeno pepper as well, thanks for that suggestion. Served it with sour cream and cut scallions. I am sure it will be even better tomorrow although I had to put it away to make sure some was left over.

this chili was a delicious chili but next time i may do something different with the chicken or not add it at all. i think shredded chicken would work better than chunks and i would probably add more beans. it was still great for a cold night!

Quick and yummy, this is our favorite Chicken Chili recipe so far. My only modifications were substituting chicken broth for the drained white bean juice and throwing half of the can of beer I was drinking into the chili.

I doubled this recipe. Used three cans of white beans and one can of black. Also used chicken breasts rather than thighs. The chili was a hit. My kids said it was the new favorite chili. I will add some red pepper flakes next time to bring up the heat a little. The recipe is quick and easy and is comprised of mostly pantry items which is nice for all us busy moms.

Our whole family loved this dish. It will become a regular when we are looking for a warm hearty fall dinner.

More than three forks. Excellent recipe. Easy. Quick. And delicious. My husband loved it and he is not big on beans

Great chili recipe. I added more chili powder based on reviews and I don't think it really needed it. A good recipe just as is.

Wonderfully easy and delicious recipe. Made it with one can white beans and one can black beans, since that is what I had in the pantry. Added a finely diced jalapeno for a little extra kick. Also topped with shredded Monterey Jack cheese and sliced scallions - did not use any cilantro. I didn't think that I would care for the chicken thighs, but they came out tender and flavorful. Even my husband, who doesn't normally like chili, loved this recipe. Will definitely make it again.

Easy weeknight dish, made for company. Used 2 tbls. of chili powder and my 2 yr old loved it. Thought the chicken thighs were a bit chewy, may try using chicken breast meat instead.

Would give 3.5 forks if there was the option. Great dish, easy to make, and the chili tastes even better the next day. Made my first batch 2 days ago. I'm making my second batch right now for friends. Didn't use cilantro, but topped it with a sharp white cheddar. For the gourmets - my kids made hot dogs for dinner tonight (ughh), but I topped mine with a bit of left over chili - I've never had a chili dog in my life - but this was awesome!

Made this as is and it was perfect for a chilly fall evening in the Valley - freezes well for later, too!

Very good. Changed it up a little though. Didn't add any white beans, but one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans. I also added some fresh jalepeno and some corn. It was delicious and I'll definitely make it again.

I tried this recipe recently, but used ground chicken breast instead and got great results. The chili has lots of heat and flavor. I will definitely make this again soon.

My family really enjoyed this. I don't like white beans as well as black so next time I am going to substitute the black for the white.

I am not a chili lover but this was really good and so easy. I followed the recipe exactly and topped the chili with grated white cheddar, green onions and a little sour cream. Yum!

This was really good, although my husband complained that it wasn't "real chili" as it contained chicken. I made it with boneless chicken thighs and it was easy. Next time I'll add a jalapeno as previous folks suggested.

I made 2 changes: I poached 4 chicken breasts in 3 cans of chicken broth for about 20 minutes and then shredded the chicken and I used 2 cans of black beans in place of white beans. Added a dollop of sour cream on top. It was fantastic.

Easy to prepare, great flavour----used black beans---wonderful addtiion-- with dark meat chiken with bones in---just used our meat cleaver to chop up into smaller pieces--(wife's a world class bone picker) its a little messy but it enhances the flavour

As a Personal Chef, I am always looking for healthy recipes. This is a great, healthy alternative to the heavier ground beef chili dishes. Followed the recipe with one addition: I added one fresh jalepeno, diced. (My client likes it spicy!) Served it with plain yogurt in place of sour cream, diced avocados and cheddar cheese corn muffins. It has been requested for a future cook day.

I had never made chili before, but this dish was so simple (the hardest thing was chopping the veggies). It is a healthy meal that filled us up. My husband had three helpings, and my six-year-old son inhaled it. I can't wait for leftovers. I think it will be better tonight because the chili will be thicker. The only change I made was to lessen the chili powder by 1 1/2 tablespoons because my kids were eating it.

Being a constant dieter, I cut the oil in half, and it was fine...does anyone know a less messy way of cutting up thighs? I love them but it takes forever to clean them up. Also, I mixed everything the order of the recipe, until the 25 minutes of cooking - threw it all into a crockpot on low for the rest of the day. Wonderful, expecially with a hefty topping of Asiago cheese.

I used chicken thighs & breasts. Ate a bowl before I added the cilantro and really preferred it that way. Though I like cilantro, it really overpowers this dish. Needs a bit of hot sauce, too!

My husband and I loved this dish. It makes a perfect meal for cold wet days. I don't like chicken thighs so I used chicken breasts instead. I'll be making this again.

Very good and different than a basic ground beef chili. I really liked the texture. The taste of the recipe will depend very much on your chili powder. I made my own of paprika, turmeric, and cayenne. Yum! I topped it with grated white cheddar cheese.

I used boneless dark meat turkey instead of chicken, and 4 fresh plum tomatoes instead of canned. To the liquid from the beans, I added chicken consomme and the tomato paste, mixing all the liquids together. This is a terrific mid-week quick dinner. I'll definitely make it again.

Very good dish!! Would add more chili powder next time though!! Very good for chilly nights!

easy weekday meal, even easier if you double the recipe and freeze for those really busy nites - while the chili is defrosting in the micro you can chop up the cilantro and you are set ( I also add green onion, shredded cheese and sour cream). Nice change from the ground meat chilis that I usually do.

I thought this was fabulous. I am dating a picky eater and he loved it!! The trick is having a high quality chili powder. Makes all the difference with the flavor. This is healthy with all the the flavorof a high test meal.

I got rave reviews for this recipe! I didn't have white beans, so I substituted a can of black beans instead. And with the chicken pieces so small, I just had to cook it long enough to chop the cilantro after I added the beans and tomatoes. It wasn't very spicy, I might change that next time. I served it with shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream. My only disappointment is that there weren't any leftovers for me to have for lunch--we scraped the pan clean!
