Thanks for the heads up on the metal skewers ! I first used a metal one to pierce a hole through the corn and them threaded all the vegetables through the wooden skewers. No matter what brand or price of saffron I buy, none ever has a flavor that comes through. So there wasn't much of a saffron flavor in this dish, although the spice did nicely color the vegetables golden. I made this recipe with the moroccan chicken, as suggested, and a slightly different couscous recipe (Bon Appetit, December 1996). It was a perfect accompaniment to the other dishes, although I wouldn't rate it outstanding on its own.

I served the whole menu from the 6/03 Bon Appetit: grilled chicken Morroccan style, couscous salad with dates & almonds, this dish, followed by honey-glazed grilled pineapple. Follow the recipes EXACTLY and the results are beyond compare. My guests raved about how perfectly balanced the flavors were. Will definately make again. I agree it's hard to get the corn on the bamboo skewers but I used an ice pick to make a pilot hole first. I just like the look of bamboo. I might use an electric drill next time.

I made it without the saffron. Love the taste of grilled veggies. I agree with the previous reviewer - I used metal skewers - way too hard to get bamboo through the corn!

This wasn't bad, but the corn is just impossible to skewer if you're using bamboo. Couldn't really taste the saffron (not sure what it tastes like anyway, though). Everyone really like the taste of the grilled corn, though. Added portabella mushrooms to it. Not bad, with some adjustments.

Easy. Nothing controversial about it.
