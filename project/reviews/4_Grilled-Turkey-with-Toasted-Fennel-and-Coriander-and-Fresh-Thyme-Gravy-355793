We have made this turkey for 2 years now to celebrate "Friends Thanksgiving". The flavor is excellent. Cooking on the grill keep things clean and easy. I agree with the reviewer who added chicken stock to the roasting pan. I found that the rub kept the juices in the turkey almost until the end and that the vegetables scorched before the fat and juices were able to provide enough liquid. I added enough stock to cover the vegetables 1/2 way. Everything was perfect.

While this recipe is tasty, I like to do it a different (and slightly easier) way. I've been grilling our turkeys for 7 years on a charcoal grill, and it is supereasy, fast, juicy, and delicious. Check out my blog post for detailed instructions. http://socialmediabar.com/grillingaturkey

This is our 4th time making this and family and friends all agree - Best Turkey Ever! It looks gorgeous and the spice rub smells amazing and adds wonderful flavor to the meat. I add rosemary branches, halved heads of garlic and fresh oregano in the body cavities. Use the carcass and leftovers to make turkey soup! Yum. Cooking turkey on the grill provides added bonus of not needing oven on all day long!

I made this by the book and it was good, but I would strongly suggest throwing some soaked wood chips on your coals to give it more smoke flavor.

It was definitely an interesting experiment. Nice to have the oven free for other things while prepping for thanksgiving dinner. But the grill did require some babysitting. We brined the turkey beforehand and then patted it dry. We used more spices than called for in this recipe (being in Indian, we always have whole spices for a garam masala blend on hand so we toasted those and ground them). Quite flavorful and moist. We skipped the veggies and didn't feel like we needed a gravy either.

Great flavor but the didn't care for the gravy-very oily. We didn't have sherry wine vinegar so we substituted with champagne vinegar. Next time I would puree the vegetables and put them into the gravy and cut down on the amount of turkey fat. We put some white wine in the pan.

I didn't grill the bird, but instead baked it in the oven. My husband felt that it was going to take too much work to monitor the grill. We ended up brining the turkey before hand in a mixture of salt, soy sauce, molasses, honey and sugar, garlic and water. I rinsed it off before placing it in the rack with the veggies. Also I used a mix of olive oil and butter instead of just olive oil and I stuffed it with chunks of onion, celery and a bunch of thyme. The seasoning was awesome, and I got many compliments on the flavor and moistness of the turkey. Unfortunately my roasting pan was scorched and my gravy didn't turn out as flavorful as I wanted it to be. But I definitely plan on adjusting this recipe for a weeknight chicken roast.

Wonderful turkey with great flavor. We brined and air-chilled it before cooking, and cooked it in a Big Green Egg. Great flavor, very moist -- delicious. The gravy was excellent as well.

I cooked this for about an hour and a half in the oven then flipped it over and put it on the grill. I added broth to the roasting pan to begin with so I something to baste it with. The spices were great! Very tasty! I made it with the sourdough, sausage dressing from the same issue of Bon Appetit--also delicious!

This was a great and easy recipe!! I cooked the turkey in a Weber Kettle Grill. Added 4-6 charcoal briquettes every 30 - 45 minutes. Cooked another turkey just in case, everyone loved the one cooked outside better!!! Thanks! Will use this recipe again!

Very good...we usually smoke a bird and various other items, but as it was just the 2 of us this year, decided to try this and we're both quite pleased. I was surprised that recipe didn't call for any liquid with vegtables in bottom of pan and we didn't get any pan juices, which was a disappointment, but I had made turkey stock & froze earlier, so used that. Only change I would make would be to add some stock/wine towards last hour next time we do this. Served w/cornbread & andouille sausage stuffing from this month's edition as well.

Good Recipe. Try doingt your stuffing on the grill as well, gives it that smokey flavor that compliments this turkey recipe. The Poker Guys wish everyone a Great Safe Thanksgiving Holiday.

This was the best turkey I've ever made. We used a relatively small gas grill, so left both burners on, and kept the temperature closer to 375-400 degrees. We had a 12 pound bird, and it was on the grill for close to 3 hours. I probed it several times with the instant-read thermometer, which didn't cause it to lose too much juice, but convinced me it was done. It came out tender, juicy, and full of flavor. There wasn't much pan juice, so I deglazed the plan lightly with some broth I'd made from the turkey neck. Most of the fat for the roux was butter, but there was still plenty of flavor from what drippings I had. I will definitely make this again.

I also wanted to add that I followed the recipe exactly as written, including toasting the spices. What I did wrong was not have a coffee grinder on hand, and instead ended up emptying a pepper grinder and filling it with the spice mix. BAD IDEA. It took 15 minutes, alternating between my boyfriend and I due to total arm failure! Def have a coffee grinder or spice grinder on hand before you start!

Exceptional! The flavors were so rich and the meat was so tender and juicy. And we even had it on the bbq about 30 minutes longer than the recipe states. We used or gas grill, but our has four burners and the recipe only notes directions for two and three burner bbq's. We lit both outer burners like the recipe calls for and as a result needed to cook the turkey for a little over three hours to achieve the 165 degree reading. Well worth the wait! We paired it with the creamed corn pudding recipe from the same issue as well as the carmelized shallot mashed potatoes from March 2008 Bon Apetit. Highly recommend all three!
