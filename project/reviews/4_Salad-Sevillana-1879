Fabulous combination. I used my own mustardy french dressing (sorry - I had it on hand) and used rocket instead of spinach (same excuse). But the combination of flat (eggs), salty (bacon) and vinegary (artichoke) is perfect. I am interested in this these days - what elements combine to make a great salad. If you like a nicoise, you will like this too. Enjoy!

Such a delicious salad! At the suggestion of a friend, I've used sherry vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar. Both versions are fantastic, but I think I prefer the sherry vinegar version.

Very yummy salad. The dressing reminds me of a French dressing. Very tasty. You will have lots of extra dressing.

This is one of my favorite salad recipes and one we pull out quite often when entertaining. Super easy with lots of great flavors - always a hit!

I made just the dressing and then poured it over sliced boiled potatoes with a little bacon, artichoke hearts, and other components of the salad and served it room temperature. I think this may be the best potato salad I've ever made

I'm reviewing the dressing only since I made a few changes to the salad content - it is delicious on many, many things and will be in our repertoire for a while. As for the salad, since I don't like artichokes, we subbed in tomatoes and mushrooms and it was delicious if you're in that boat too.

So good, it is easy and so flavorful. the dressing is really good; I had dressing for leftovers.

I´ve been making this salad for 15 years! It is perfect and will impress guests when you put the hard boiled eggs, bacon and artichoke hearts. It´s that blend on spinach that makes the tart dressing shine. I´ve tried the dressing on simple salads and it turns out too overpowering. A keeper!

I wish I could agree with the other reviewers. For us the dressing was too sweet and very, very unexciting

We enjoyed this...to the previous reviewer who wanted to know if you can reduce the oil, I used only half the oil and used extra onion in the dressing to give it that body...probably need a mild onion to do this. I also used mostly sherry vinegar since I ran out of red wine vinegar--turned out great--isn't that more "sevillana" anyway? Also used pancetta & turned this into more of a main dish by using a full can or artichoke hearts and 8 eggs total.

A twist on the normal spinach salad. The artichoke hearts are a great addition. Easy and impressive.

So good! Doubled recipe for 5 people and if we didn't control ourselves we would have eaten it all!...and should have because it was a soggy breakfast. There is plenty of dressing left and can't wait to try it on other fresh greens.

Love this salad. It's so simple yet so flavorful. The dressing is excellent; I had a lot of dressing left over.

Served this to guests at a dinner last night and was a big hit. Made sure husband wasn't aware of dressing prior to adding to salad as he doesn't like anything even a little sweet. His remark after guests left; "that was the best salad you have ever made!"

This dressing is amazing! Everyone raved. I make it even if I'm not making the salad to go with it.

We loved this wonderful salad...you won't be dissappointed! A great "make ahead" dish you can toss with dressing just before serving.

Really good. But does anyone have suggestions for how I can cut down on the oil and still have the dressing not taste so acidic due to higher ratio of red wine vinegar? Thanks.

I was surfing Epicurious today looking for recipes for a Spanish dinner that we're hosting and came upon this salad in the recipe lists so thought I'd add my positive comments to the others here. I can hardly believe it was published in 1992 and I can't count how many times we've made this over the years since I cut it out of Bon Apetit. It is consistently wonderful and always a hit. A classic!

This is my favorite spinach salad recipe, and I have made it about four or five times since discovering it recently. One time, I thought I would save a little space in the dishwasher by adding the onions, minced, to the rest of the dressing ingredients rather than using the food processor to blend the dressing. It was a mistake; the results just were nowhere near as good. Otherwise, I have made this using red onions, vidalias, and regular yellow onions with equally great results, cutting back a bit on the sugar when using sweeter onions.

WOW is right - I made this for a big tapas/dinner party with the Birthday Paella, Clams with Chorizo and Tomato Sauce, Sherried Mushroom Empanadas, Marinated Manchego Cheese on Sourdough Baguettes. This salad and the Manchego appetizers were devoured and people were asking for the recipes of their favorite dish...my friend's boyfriend was so overwhelmed, he just kept giving me the "high-five"! Taking others advice, I doubled the salad, bacon and eggs for this amount of dressing - it worked perfectly. Thank you Northbrook for the tip on marinating the artichokes in the dressing first! Brilliant.

WOW!!!! No holding back here...made this for a dinner party and it blew everyone away! Served it with Paella and Sangria for a perfect combo. Made it AGAIN the next evening (the recipe definitely makes a ton of dressing) and those friends were equally impressed. Everyone asked for the recipe. Made this salad for a third time last night and messed up(well, not really). I realized something was "off" (although first timers did not notice) then I realized the next day I had forgotten the onions - makes a big difference in both body and flavor! Thanks all who provided comments as it was your opinions that pursuaded me to try this and it is now a staple in my book!

This was wonderful! I think next time I will make half of the dressing. Lots left over. Went great with the Birthday Paella & Sangria from this web site.

This salad was good but I didn't pre-mix the salad with the dressing - which I should have. Overall tasty. I used the left over dressing in a warm potato salad - cut up baked potatoes, added cooked bacon and dressing. Cooked until warm and bubbly. My kids loved it.

This is an incredible salad! My dinner guests devoured it! The dressing is delicious and so easy to make and there is plenty leftover. Will make this again and again.

I served this salad as part of a complete dinner and found that there was plenty for 8 people. I halved the dressing and added a little extra egg. I assembled the salads indiviually, rather than tossing it all together. That worked fine, especially since I marinated the artichokes in some of the dressing ahead of time. Very good!!

The dressing was very good, and even better the next day. Why buy store bought when you can make wonderful, healthy dressing yourself?

The dressing for this salad was absolutely incredible. I paired it with blanched green beans, sliced carrots, and boiled red potatoes, and everyone who tasted it loved it. A perfect make-ahead dish for a buffet or party -- will definitely make it again!

This is one of my all time favorite salads. I actually crave it. I too add boiled new potatoes just to make it more of a meal

This was very good, a nice twist to my usual spinach salad. Although, it made much more dressing than I needed, the dressing was very good. All I had was Hungarian paprika, so that is what I used instead of regular. Really easy to throw together for a hot night, will make again, my husband liked it too. Served with spicy cold cucumber/avocado soup on this site.

Made this salad yesterday. Dressing is great for a spinach salad - I only halfed the salad dressing and it was plenty! Left out the bacon.

Great dressing recipe! I haven't made the salad with the required ingredients, but we used the salad on a butter lettuce/romaine mix topped with grilled chicken last night, and it was outstanding! Will make the bacon/artichoke/egg/spinach version next.

DELICIOUS - an unqualified "hit" with guests. I made the salad as described, but added some boiled new potatoes and blanched sugar snap peas to bulk up the salad. Everybody loves this salad. The dressing is the key - it is wonderful!

So far, I have made it twice, both times to raves from my guests. This is a definite keeper.
