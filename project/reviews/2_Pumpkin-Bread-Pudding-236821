I'm always hesitant to write off a recipe that has a few so-so reviews. I love bread pudding and had all the ingredients on hand, so I decided to try this. I wasn't impressed. The spice cake is a great move for the bread cubes, but the proportions were just off somehow. The dish was way too dry, even after I added extra liquids. It was better the next day after getting a little damp in the fridge. But overall I wasn't a fan, and I won't make it again.

This was dry and not very exciting.

I had made souffles for Thanksgiving and had 8 egg yolks left over and 1/2 tin of pumpkin. Instead of making the cake, I used 9 stale butter rolls, torn into chunks that I toasted in the oven for 10 minutes. I added pumpkin spices to the custard mix. Now this is what I call left overs!

This recipe is great! I love bread pudding and made this dessert for a thanksgiving day party at my house. It was a huge hit with our guests, but most importantly with me! After all, when everyone is gone, I am the one picking over leftovers.
