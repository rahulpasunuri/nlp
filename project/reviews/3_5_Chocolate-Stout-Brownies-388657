Excellent brownies, used semi-sweet chocolate chips and sprayed the foil with Pam for Baking.

These are gooey-but my husband and I love gooey brownies-so we only baked them 40 minutes. I think next time I would bake them longer. I did bake in the foil and didn't have much of a problem getting the brownies out-but would probably grease the foil next time. The recipe is a keeper.

I wish I'd paid attention to the direction that said "when the top is browned and cracked." I should have used my eyes instead of counting on the clock. Close to 40 minutes in, I stuck a knife and then a chop stick in. I thought I got a few crumbs, so I took the pan out. I didn't want "dry" brownies. Like other reviewers, however, the brownies never got firm. I used pastry flour because that was all I had. Maybe that was a mistake? I spent $16 for 9x9 pan (a decent metal one), $16 on premium chocolate and $14 for a 6 pack of Guinness. Result was scrumptious but the center was still like pudding.

almost more cake like than brownie like (disclaimer: i made a vegan version, substituting applesauce for eggs, which may have resulted in the cake-y-ness. They were a big favorite at a St. Pat's party.

The chocolate lovers in our family were really impressed. Rich enough we cut it into smaller servings, liked it even better the next day after refrigerating. An intriguing (& addictive) balance between sweet & salty. Made exactly by recipe with Guiness and bittersweet chips...yum!

I made this the second time and used 72% chocolate bars and the first time I made this I used chocolate chips. I think this is fabulous but the chocolate chips were just as good as the expensive bars. LOVE this recipe! Made no changes either time but sprayed the foil the second time after reading here.

We loved this recipe! Only addition was adding 3 tablespoons of sugar to the icing. Next time might try baking in several ramekins.

I found this recipe to have a very crumbly texture. I would definitely not make it again. Too much effort for a poor result.

I couldn't taste the stout and the icing was overwhelming. I have a perfect oven and my oven thermometer was registering 350 degrees the entire time and it took me 50 minutes to get this to cook and the center was still uncooked. Not a fan.

Easy recipe, and oh so decadent!

I used a 9x13 glass pan lined with no stick foil and didn't have any issues with sticking. I didn't reduce the Guiness as much as the recipe called for and I used cocoa for part of the chocolate. Not a fan of the glaze--too much of a good thing.

I had the same experience as ExhibitGirl, but I give it 4 forks and will definitely make it again. I will GREASE/FLOUR the foil or use parchment-lined springform - greased and floured. and bake longer. the edges get candy-like and the inside is fudge-like. I might add more flour next time. I did cut the butter amount. Flavor was aMAZING. With little fixes, this is a to-die- for recipe.

These tasted great, but the recipe doesn't work. First, the recipe didn't say to grease the aluminum foil, so I didn't...brownies wouldn't come out of the pan. I had to refrigerate them and then when they were good and hard I could turn them over and peel the foil off. Second, the bake time is off. I ended up having to bake them at least 20 minutes longer than the recipe said, and they were still very fudgy at that point. Third, the glaze didn't set up. Over all, a very disappointing baking experience. I made these to take to a family St. Patrick's Day gathering...thankfully I also made a Guinness cake (which turned out perfect), otherwise I wouldn't have had anything to take as these were completely not presentable.

Same as A Cook from Seattle. Gooey in the middle, charred at the edges. And tasty, very tasty. I'll make it as a petit gateau next time.

I don't know what I did wrong! I followed the recipe carefully and these were kind of a delicious disaster. The batter was bubbling at the edges, and never set even with another 20" cook time. I ended up with a pan of greasy, battery sludge with fried edges. It tastes good though!

This recipe was good, not great. I didn't care too much for the frosting, but it mellowed with time the next day. I'm sure that they would have been better on day two, but I took them to work and they were eaten! A few of the taste testers gave them a thumbs up and one said they were the best brownies she ever tasted. I might make them again, but decrease the amount of the stout in the frosting only.

This looks great. I would want to buy two bottles of Guinness, use the one cup for the recipe, and drink the rest.

I'm a chocolate snob, and picky about what deserts I like. This one is fabulous, but the key lies in using good quality dark chocolate. I was able to make the recipe amazing by only using 1.5 sticks of butter (instead of 2), and use 1 cup of sugar instead of 1.5 cups. Make sure not to overbake! I brought this to a work party, and ended up making it four more times in the next week because so many people were asking for it. Great share!

I had no problems with recipe. I used chocolate stout and served with Breyers Vanilla Bean ice cream! Yum!!

I too had trouble with sticking to the foil, but scraped off the bits for family - delicious! Everybody loved these, I thought they were better the next day (held a couple out). Next time I might try not reducing the stout as much for a less strong flavor.

I brought these brownies to a Superbowl party. Everyone raved over them. Outstanding taste! I had no problem getting them out of the pan and maybe the key is I used non-stick Reynold's Wrap.

I really loved the flavor of these brownies. I used Guinness. They turned out really rich and gooey. I buttered the pan and they still stuck a little, but the butter helped. I had to bake them about 10 minutes longer than the recipe suggested. These are great for chocolate lovers.

Don't understand why people had problems with the brownies sticking to the foil. I did not. These brownies were sooooo good. I followed the recipe. Like a previous reviewer noted, they were very gooey and most likely require a fork but they are really delicious. I was also concerned, when I tasted the glaze on its own, that the stout would make them bitter, but they were not. The ingredients work together in perfect combination. I will make them again.

I almost didn't make these after reading the reviews, but am so glad I did! Everybody loved these and I got multiple requests for the recipe. I made a few small adjustments which resulted in the dessert presenting more like a chocolate fudge cake - really dense and a bit gooey in the center. It was awesome and so decadent. Changes: *I did not foil line the pan. Instead, I used an 8x8x2 glass baking dish. I buttered the bottom of the pan only. No sticking issues! *I adjusted the heat to 325 given the use of a glass baking dish and cooked the brownies for an hour given the smaller pan and reduced heat. As I mentioned, the brownies were more like a fudgy cake. If I cooked them for 15 min longer, they may have presented more like a typical brownie. But, if I made this recipe again I would do it the exact same as it was so delicious! *I used Ghiradelli chocolate - half bittersweet and half semisweet. *Lastly, I didn't reduce the Guinness quite as much as called for as I was afraid it would be too bitter/intense. I reduced by about 1/4 of a cup and then used the instructed amounts. This worked very well.

Brownies are excellent and will definitely be made again! I read the reviews prior to making and made one change - oiled the foil before pouring in the brownie mix. They came out perfectly. Also, I used bittersweet chocolate for the mix and semi-sweet for the glaze. Everyone thought they were some of the best brownies ever.

I am glad to see I'm not the only one who had "sticking" problems. As I was making this recipe, I thought "I should probably spray this tinfoil", but, since the recipe didn't say to do so, I didn't. What a mistake! These brownies may taste great but first one has to get them out of the pan. Expensive to make (good chocolate is not cheap) so probably won't try this recipe again. There are plenty of good brownie recipes out there.

My friends call me the brownie maven because I have so many extra special brownie recipes in my collection. These sounded great, so I could hardly wait. God awful in my book, NO FORKS

Taste was great but when I lifted it out of the pan it broke all over, and I couldn't get the foil off. Was the foil supposed to be buttered? Love the taste, just had to scoop it into dishes.

Really easy to make and amazingly rich. Soooo good. Try this!
