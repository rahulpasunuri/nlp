Nice, bright green and lighter than traditional collards. Added minced garlic to saute pan first and a shake of crushed red peppers as others suggested. High quality, fresh greens a must.

I allowed extra time for the collard greens to properly cook. I also added a splash of vinegar and crushed red pepper.

Tut! I've lived and worked in Brazil and can tell you that this version of couvé would result in banishment for the cook. For authenticity one must be willing to go against the food Nazis of the US. First, the fat must be from pig. The earlier suggestion of bacon is good, although a really high quality lard from the top of the kidneys really takes it to another realm. Oh, and garlic is required.

Definitely add garlic to the olive oil; even if you don't have fresh garlic on hand, garlic powder will help do the trick.

I love collard greens, but this was a big disappointment. The greens were tough and bitter and lacked any interesting flavor combinations.

Not only is garlic a must in any Brasilian version of this, but also a slice or two of bacon help with the flavor...

MAJOR OOPS. I agree with the previous reviewer. I am Brazilian and sorry, but this recipe is *not* Brazilian without minced and roasted garlic... Lots of it!

A Brazilian-style collard green will have 5-6 fried crushed garlic cloves and the collard green will be cooked for 2-3 minutes (or more), till tender.

I blanch the leaves about 2 minutes before sautéing. Otherwise, it reminds me too much of the grass growing in my front yard.

Absolutely agree with previous review. Garlic is a must. I'm married to a Brazilian-his mother taught me this dish.

I don't have to make it to know that it's no good--where's the garlic?! In Brazil there's always be lots of it, either finely minced or smashed.
