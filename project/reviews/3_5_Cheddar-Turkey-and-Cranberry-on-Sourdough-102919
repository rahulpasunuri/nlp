Now I've tried it. Conception excellent, my execution lacking. I should have sliced the turkey thinner, smashed the (homemade) cranberry sauce, and been more patient while the sandwiches browned. Still good. Sorry, Chicago, you were back in 2000.

to Chicago in 2007: Someone like me who hadn't thought of this combination. Haven't make it yet so I can't rate it.

Made this exactly as written, and it was good but not great. Next time I'll use half the cheese, and perhaps a homemade cranberry sauce that is more tart.

I give this 4 forks because the combo of Turkey and Cranberry is such a big hit always. I sell a sandwich similar to this at my restaurant as a special. Sometimes I put it in a wrap, or some other bread. I'll use brie, cheddar or havarti for my cheese and add a sprinkle of spicy nut mix we make for some crunch. I always add a little salt, pepper and orange zest to the cranberry sauce.

I agree with one of the previous reviewers that you don't necessarily need a recipe for this--but one of the things that makes this website so great is its combinations that one might not otherwise think of. I used my mom's homemade cranberry-Grand Marinier relish and croissants and took these to work as is, without grilling. Yummy and different than my typical take-to-work sandwiches...

Great basic recipe! Kicked it up a notch,...used a croissant for the bread, smoked turkey, mayo, cran sauce,lettuce, tomato, bacon, & mature English cheddar (grated). Boyfriend loved it! Very rich,...not an everyday sandwich.

This would obviously be great - but who needs a recipe?
