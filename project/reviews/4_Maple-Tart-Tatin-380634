I loved this! I've made it twice now, and everyone thought it was great. The first time, I made it as is and it was fantastic... and surprisingly easy! The second time, I used brown sugar instead of white, and I think it was a bit more complimentary with the maple syrup. Crême fraîche also works as an accompaniment!

Downhome perfection.Great technique, which is easy to execute. Used "amber" or dark Quebec maple syrup. The caramel that is created is superb. This will be a standard in the repertoire.

This dessert is amazing! It is very easy to make and incredibly delicious. I used 5 large Fuji Apples, and some good Grade B Maple Syrup. The apples ended up the perfect texture and the caramel delightful. The instructions worked well. I won't change it a bit next time. Serve it warm while the pastry is puffy, but the next day is good too.
