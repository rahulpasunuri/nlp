Why not make like Mark Bitmann and use a food processor? That's what I did, because I don't have any other milling implements, and because if you can make brioche dough in a processor, why not mashed potatoes? The result was super smooth. I also used my mom's trick of adding a garlic clove that's been whacked with the broad side of a chef's knife to the simmering milk, then removing it before combining with the potatoes. It gives it a nice essence. Not the best mashed potatoes I've ever had, but perfectly serviceable. The real appeal of this recipe was how easy and quick it was.

This is a very simple recipe that works for all potatoes. This was the first time I used yukon gold for mashed potatoes and I did not like them at all! They are silky (not necessarily light), but I find "silkiness" to be a weird consistency for mashed potatoes.

Good basic mashed potatoes. I didn't peel the potatoes and it worked out fine. I tripled the recipe, so it was a bit time-intensive with the food mill.

Really lovely flavour

Great recipe. We can't get Yukon golds out here but I used potatoes that are specifically for mashed potatoes. Doubled the amount of potatoes but kept the butter and milk at the amounts in the recipe and the result was perfect. A keeper.

This was delicious, even with using skim milk and without a potato ricer. The best mashed potatoes I have ever made.

I made them with 1% milk, black pepper, and hand-mashed them. I also heated the milk and butter in a micro-safe glass measuring cup. The finished dish was full of classic potato flavor. I will make these again and again.

Very good, almost perfect. I could not find my ricer, so I hand mashed and then whipped with a mixer, which might have added too much air. Used 1% milk, which made it less rich. They were still great and everyone liked them.

Perfect mashed potatoes. I bought a ricer just for this recipe, will use it for mashed potatoes from now one. I doubled the recipe for 8 adults + 6 kids and it proved to be the right amount on a crowded Thanksgiving table.

Since my Mom's recipe was ...a little milk, some butter, this much salt...it was so nice to have ACTUAL measurements! I used a ricer, and the potatoes were not as cooked as I expected them, but the end result was perfect. They are a special treat with that much butter and whole milk tho!

Delicious taters! super creamy and silky but I changed mine just a bit. I reduced the butter and used 1% milk instead of whole milk and the outcome was awesome! Wasn't as fatty and super yummy which is a plus in my book. I also added some garlic and green onion which definitely turned out to be a hit!

VERY,very good the only thing i changed was black pepper instead of white. I will make them again!!!

This is a good basic recipe, but for anyone who has never made mashed potatoes with white pepper, I highly recommend that you put your nose in the spice jar before you make the decision on whether to use black or white pepper. I used white pepper, and it gave the potatoes an off, funky smell and taste.

just like my recipe, just i do half milk, half cream and use a bit of butter as well- which, however, makes it less light but veeery yummy. add a tiny touch of nutmeg for additional flavor!

Wonderful Period.

Best mashed potato recipe I have made (so far). I cut out the step of returning the potatoes to a pan for a few minutes, then to yet another bowl. I just drained them in the colander, and covered them while heating milk in pot, and there was no perceptible difference except less to clean.

WONDERFUL! silky and light and no lumps at all. Even my daughter, who dislikes potatoes, liked this recipe!

Made it for Thanksgiving dinner and figured the kids would love it but they didn't.....most of the adults felt it was too bland....and I wasn't a fan because of the work in using the potato ricer....

This was the BEST mashed potato recipe I've ever made/eaten. I hate texture/bumps/lumps in mashed potatoes, and this was really smooth and creamy! Everyone that tried these when I made them asked for the recipe! You don't even need a potato ricer if you use the yukon gold potatoes, they are so tender and buttery!

I made these for Thanksgiving, and everyone liked them, especially my sister who hates extra stuff added to mashed potatoes. They were very fluffy and were good as leftovers as well.
