I had a bunch of zucchini I needed to use and didn't want to make bread. Like another reviewer, I sauteed some onion and garlic first, added the zucchini, and then the broth. Boiled the veggies until very soft. Due to the other reviewers stating the soup was bland, I added 1/2 cup of pesto. I then heavily blended the soup, did not add cream or nutmeg, as the pesto gave it great flavor. Lowfat, no carbs and tasted great!

This can be great without the cream and parmesan cheese - just blend it for much longer. I sauteed zucchini, onion, and garlic in olive oil until the zucchini was almost done. Then I boiled the vegetables in chicken stock and 1 tsp. of cumin until they were very tender. Then I blended until creamy (keep blending much longer than you think necessary and it will get very creamy) - I used an imersion blender, which made it much easier.

I made the mistake of reading too much into the reviews. So many people said it was too bland, that I overcompensated by adding 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper and lemon zest, in addition to much more parmesan, and an extra 1/4 tsp nutmeg. The result? Spciy, lemony, overpowering. I ended up having to add a lot more whipping cream, and letting it cook on low heat for a while to allow it to get thick again. After that, it was certainly good- it has potential. I also recognized the recipe as a flexible one in terms of vegetables. I used the zucchinni as a base, but added some baby spinach and mushrooms. I sauteed garlic, onion and shallot in olive oil separately, but did not puree it in the blender, tossing it into the pot with some corn after blending the veggies for added texture. The vegetable combination itself was wonderful. Next time, I will skip the cayenne and lemon zest and allow the vegetables to speak for themselves! After all, the zest is supposed to make food taste fresher, and the only thing in my soup that wasn't fresh was the frozen corn.

This is a good recipe for a base. I added curry powder, salt & pepper, went heavy on nutmeg, added a pinch of cayenne, and then pureed with no-fat greek yogurt. Then it was divine, if I do say so myself.

sounded bland, so i used it as a base. i boiled 2c water, 3 zucchini, added 1/2c broccoli, few mushrooms, and a few cherry tomatoes. after 15min i pureed with some spinach and some store-bought pesto. returned to pot and added parmesan, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and 1/2c milk. turned out well. nice rainy day soup.

This recipe had merit but needed some help. By adding some additional salt, fresh ground pepper, curry, onion and garlic powder the soup was really great and not so bland but a nice dish. I also garnished each serving with some additional parmesan cheese. My husband really liked the changes. I will be sure to make this again.

If you have zucchini on hand, you might want to try the recipe, but I found it quite bland. I added some curry powder which helped. Next time I have zucchini, I'll make bread.

This was a very easy soup to make. However, I agree with many of the others reviewers that it is nothing special and rather bland. Additional cheese does not help the flavor.

This was a nice and easy soup to make for lunch guests. Pretty too. Guests enjoyed it & asked for more. It's not a strongly flavored soup, so plan accordingly. It went well with some tapenade (Bon Appetit May 1999), a baguette, and a simple green salad & tomatoes with fresh basil, balsamic vinegar & olive oil. Nice combination for lunch.

This was just o.k. Nothing special.

Look up "boring" in the dictionary; I think Webster's decided to replace the definition with a picture of this soup. I even used chicken broth and peccorino Romano cheese, which has more oomph than Parmesan, and added the requisite salt. It was watery and bland. I then added more cheese, which did help. Perhaps melting a smooth cheese in there would be even better; of course, then it's "zucchini and cheese soup." Perhaps I overcooked the zucchini, making it too "soupy" (ha!) But I only cooked it for 15 minutes as indicated, which didn't seem like it could be too long considering I doubled the recipe. Lucky me, I now have twice as much of this stuff to consume. Anybody want me to ship it to them?

I made this soup for Sunday lunch and it was very delicious! It is quite easy to make and has a delicate flavor . I added some garlic as it was suggested in the reviews, and was careful to not overpower the nutmeg. Will definitely make it for a dinner party!

This soup was easy and big on flavor. Big hit at a dinner party. I did add a tiny bit of cayenne and maple syrup.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was delicious! Even my family members who didn't normally like soups loved it. I doubled the recipe, but took the advice of other reviewers and did not double the nutmeg. It was perfect!

I've made this recipe several times for guests as a first course and have always received compliments. It is easy to make and has a delicate flavor that does not steal the show from the main course. I have incorporated some onion & garlic, but be care to not overpower the nutmeg. I've also tried the recipe using califlower instead of zucchini, but the tecture and appearance was not very appealling - it looked like cream of wheat. I use light cream & the recipe is a great compliment to a low fat diet.

I doubled the recipe added 2 large cloves of minced garlic before boiling. I did not double the nutmeg. I thought it would be to overpowering.I didn't blend all the way because I liked the chunks of the zucchini.

Living in the New York metro area, the land of Italian cuisine prevails! The definition of soup is to clean out the fridge! Measuring is not required! To this very basic recipe.....add plenty of Vidalia or Spanish onion (a soup staple) and some scallions. Definitely use chicken broth, forget the water. Light cream is sufficient. Be sure to add salt & pepper at the beginning and keep adding nutmeg at the end to taste. Forget pureeing in the blender in batches. This is toooooo much work. Use one of those Braun shake maker gadgets that you plug in and can puree right in the pot. After cooked and pureed, turn soup off and let set for 2 to 3 hours to blend the flavors. Serve with garlic or caesar croutons and a side salad! Yummy!!!!!

First I sauteed the zucchini & garlic in 1 t. butter and 1 t. olive oil until lightly browned, and then proceeded with the recipe. It was fabulous!

Incredibly bland. I wouldn't bother with this again. I may try the recipe for Zucchini and Rosemary Soup - maybe the herbs would help. I even made a vegetable stock from scratch (per Deborah Madison's Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone) and it was still pretty tasteless.

Simple and delicious. I omitted nutmeg, added 4 cloves of garlic and a few grated carrots for colour. Creamy and smooth - great hot or cold.

Very easy and pretty tasty, too! I added some garlic as another cook suggested, and it came out quite good. A little strong on the nutmeg, so next time I will use a little less.

Very easy to make, although I did add more zucchini than recipe says. Also, if you keep a kosher home, you can make this soup with non dairy cream and omitting the cheese.

This was the easiest soup I've ever made. Tastes nice.

Easy, quick and very good. There's nothing to the prep of this soup. I substituted fat free half and half for the cream, but only because that's all I had. It made about 3 mugs full and would be nice to serve prior to a meal. Next time, I'll try adding some garlic, just because everything's better with garlic.
