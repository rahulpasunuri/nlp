Not a lot of flavor here. Used top quality ham and didn't skimp on the cream. Much prefer a classic alfredo sauce if I'm going to splurge on the calories.

This was great! Sauted about a cup of chopped onions with 3 cloves of garlic (we LOVE garlic!) until soft, sprinkled with flour for thickening, added the wine, then half & half. Simmered then added chopped spinach & sliced deli ham, mixed in pasta and the cheese. Quick easy & will be a regular at our house.

Loved it! When browning ham, added some freshly minced garlic with a little butter. Used roselli pasta since I didn't have farfalle. My husband likes a cremier dish so next time I make this, I'll 1-1/2 times the the ingrediants that makes the sauce.

I have to disagree with most of the other reviews of this recipe. I thought this dish was very bland. It wasn't bad, just needs some more flavor(garlic for sure!). I don't think I would make this again as written but it has potential. Frankly, I can think of better recipes for the $8 block of asiago and the 2 pounds of asparagus.

I make this all the time since the recipe first came out. Very simple and delicious. I like to add fresh garlic but not necessary. One of my favorite recipes for week night dinner or company. Simple and delicious!

Buonissimo! I made this pasta this evening and it was fast, easy and delicious. I had to use frozen asparagus and decided to replace the bowties with whole wheat fettuccine and it came out great. Next time I might add a drop of the pasta water to the sauce. I will definitely make this again.

I make a point to serve this dish to my family or friends every spring. It's wonderful as is, but I some diced tomatoes to make it even better! It's always a bit hit!

I HAVE A PART TIME CATERING BUSINESS AND ONE OF MY PARTIES REQUESTED THIS. AFTER THE PARTY I GOT A CALL FROM THE LADY OF THE HOUSE STATING THAT HER HUSBAND PULLED HER ASIDE AND ASKED HER TO GO IN AND PUT SOME OF THE BOW-TIES IN A CONTAINER FOR AFTER THE PARTY HE LOVED THEM SO MUCH HE DIDNT WANT THEM ALL TO GO

Fine for weeknight dinner. I added a tsp. of minced garlic and sugar snap peas instead of asparagus. No need to make again. I'll find something else to do with my left-over Easter ham.

Nothing special, a little bland. . . but I might make it again because it definitely was very easy to do.

I have made many recipes from this site, this is the first time I felt compelled to submit a review. This was a delicious dish, made as specified, except I sauteed the onions with the ham. Very easy and very good.

The sauce lends itself nicely to chicken and fresh green beans as well.

Awesome recipe for a large group! I made it in advance and then put it in a large oven-safe dish, covered with foil and kept it warm in the oven until serving time. It was super. Everyone asked for the recipe. I will make this alot!!

A delightful springtime dish! I'd make it again using the same substitutions I had on hand - sour cream plus half-n-half cream instead of whipping cream and shaved deli ham (cut into roughly 1" pieces). I would NOT use another cheese, though - Asiago is the best for melting and flavor! Great combination of flavors - try it! (Easy to halve, too.)

This was quick and easy, good way to use up Easter leftovers. I did not have Asiago cheese but did have Fontina in the fridge, so I used that and it came out fine.

really good, kids loved it too, two pounds of asparagus is a lot, I used 1.5 and it was still a little too much. Try a little freshly ground nutmeg in the sauce.

This dish was easy to make - and even easier to enjoy! I added a teaspoon of minced garlic in with the ham and a cup of frozen peas in with the pasta and it became a truly self-sufficient dinner. Great winter meal, although the title is "Springtime...".

I gave this dish 3 forks, but my husband argued it should be 4. He absolutely loved it! I'm very finicky, however, and difficult to impress. I used about a 1 1/2# of asparagus and that seemed to be the perfect amount. Next time I would add some garlic somewhere in this recipe. Maybe with the wine (?)

The entire family loved it. It was very easy to prepare. I wouldn't change the recipe one bit. Definitely one for the recipe box.

I added one can of diced tomatoes cooking it to a thick reduction. I did this before the wine. It made a nice red cream sauce. It was delicious. No need to add salt. Ham and asiago were salty enough.

Rating: 1
My sauce didn't come out creamy... The asiago just melted in big clumps instead of a sauce. Followed the recipe to the letter --what did I do wrong? Should have melted the cheese first and added the other ingredients (ala fondue). Feeling badly because I wasted $5 worth of cheese, not to mention all of the other stuff I used.

This was great! Fairly simple and very tasty - even my 4 year old loved this (he LOVES asparagus). Two tips . . . one, make sure you have everything cut up/prepped before you start the sauce. Two, I only used 1 pound of asparagus and it was good - I think another pound would have been way too much.

A nice springtime dish. However, given that cooking both pasta and asparagus is not a precise science, I cooked them separately - otherwise I'm convinced one or the other would be over-/under-cooked. Separately each was perfect. I also used half the spring onions suggested and found it adequate.

I will never make this again. The dish looked very pretty - I didn't like the overall taste. Very so-so!

Everyone is right. This is a great recipe. I disgarded about 1/2" of white parts of the green onions and used mostly the green parts of the onions and it wasn't too strong at all.

What an excellent way to use up leftover Easter ham! I did make a couple of modifications. I couldn't find any asparagus so substituted broccoli instead. Also made a roux to thicken the sauce a bit. Turned out delicious. Can't wait for an excuse to make it again.

This was fast, light and tasty. I cut back on the green onions as suggested and used non-fat evaporated milk instead of the cream. I am going to try it with peas next time, as I think they will be equally suited to this springy meal. A great alternative to the very rich Carbonara.

Waaaay too many green onions, not tasty at all.

Our whole family loves this dish. It's super easy, fast and delicious.

This was the first recipe I've rated with 4 stars! I didn't make it with quite so many green onions... probably came out to about 1/2 cup... I thought it was enough (have 2 small children and didn't want to overpower the flavor). I also made it with just over a pound of asparagus - would probably up it to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 pounds next time! This dish is DELICIOUS! I would make it again in a heartbeat!
