I used a curly pasta,rotini, to make it easier to eat and put out lemon wedges for those who wished.Great summer dish

This was a little strange. One of those dishes that gets better as you continue to eat it. I wonder if it would be better with a tubular pasta and served as a side rather than a main.

I really like this recipe. It's a great dish for the summer, especialy in hot weather. Everytime I make it someone asks for the recipe.

I thought this tasted OK but not great. I normally love yogurt sauce but it tasted a little bland on the spaghetti. The tomato and olive topping raised it to two forks. I added grilled chicken to the left-overs and that also made it more interesting.

I liked the recipe alot. It definitely had a punch and you wouldn't like it if you don't love cucumbers!

I subscribe to Gourmet magazine and had lost the issue where this wonderful recipe appeared with picture on the cover! We love this for lunch and I have served it often. Thank you for including it on your website.

A very weird recipe. While it was not exactly unappetizing, it just tasted strange. We did finish though.
