I love this recipe! I've made it several times now and it's always great and very flavorful.

Wonderful flavor, but ingredient quantities definitely need to be tweaked. I added more bacon and thyme and I should have added an egg. My guests enjoyed it, but it was very difficult to cut and serve. It would have been easier if there were fewer onions and they were bound together by more of the egg/cream mixture.

Delicious! I added lemon zest to the crust (made with half whole wheat flour), which was a nice compliment. Also added an additional egg, as did previous reviewers. I brought the tart to a brunch potluck... very successful.

I used ten small white onions, about twice the recommended amount of thyme, two eggs, and 6 strips of bacon-- I generally tweaked the proportions quite a bit. Everything was fresh from the farmer's market. It was effing FAB. A fragrant, golden, delectable revelation. Made it with a salad of fresh, spicy arugula and apples with citrus agave dressing and some pinot grigio. Lovely.

I'm writing this review so I can flag it as inapproriate in an attempt to contact someone at epicurious...FYI this recipe with BACON is tagged as Vegetarian under dietary considerations. I found this recipe when I browsed based on selecting Vegetarian and then found Bacon listed as a Main Ingredient under the Vegetarian results. There is at least one other Bacon recipe tagged as Vegetarian as well.

Used 3 onions instead of 5 as they were really large and more bacon cos we like the taste of it. Substituted white grape juice and reduced honey instead of using wine. Also added another egg as I was making it in a large tray. Rolled pastry thinner and cooked with weights for 15 minutes and then added other ingredients. Turned out great

This sounds fabulous but I have to laugh a bit: Bacon is most definitely NOT vegetarian, therefore this is not a vegetarian dish. Can't wait to make it though!
