This was fantastic, and I am always looking for a new way to use cauliflower. The mixture does make a lot, so be prepared for leftovers. I agree with lack of flavor, but some roasted garlic, or really any herb really adds to it. I used some seasoned stuffing mixture for the topping, and a mound of asiago cheese.

This was good as a side dish instead of spuds. I did not have any bread so used panko instead, which was a mistake. I like the idea of adding boursin cheese and will do that next time. A nice dish but needs a little added oomph.

Great and different side dish. It does need more flavor so I added Boursin to the breadcrumbs while toasting. It does NOT need much in the pureeing process. I could have put the Boursin in with puree and not the breadcrumbs but it was too late. All in all a nice side dish.

I make this all the time. Instead of the butter, I substitute 1 wedge of "Laughing Cow Garlic & Herb Lite Cheese", about 1 tsp. roasted garlic paste, and 1 Tbs. grated Parmesan. I also add additional grated parm on top. Sometimes I add some steamed broccoli to the puree and pulse its a few times to get small green chunks...very pretty. We usually have this as a part of a "veggie" meal along with a salad. GREAT!

We've served this at several parties over the years and it's a lovely dish. The tomatoes MUST be firm, and the cauliflower should be very fresh and very much "in season"... we've made it a day ahead, and we've made it just as guests were arriving (for last night's party) and making it fresh is far superior! It should also be noted that it cannot stay in the oven much longer than the recipe states or the tomatoes WILL fall apart. With fresh cauliflower, this recipe is superb. And the mustard flavoured crumbs just shine through (be sure to use a good Dijon)... one friend was sure it was mashed potatoes because she doesn't like cauliflower, or at least she thought she didn't until she had some of this lovely dish! She even asked for the recipe! Another "keeper"!!!

This is a fabulous dish, but it can be very soggy/bland if prepared exactly according to recipe, as other reviewers have pointed out.Here are the extra steps I took: I chose very firm, thick-walled tomatoes that would hold up when baked. I dressed up the puree by blending in a beaten egg for extra volume and souffle-like fluffiness, and turmeric for an appetizing color. Then I stirred in grated parmesan cheese and crumbled blue cheese before stuffing into the tomato cups. This was a big success at a recent dinner party, and the delicious dijon-breadcrumb topping from this recipe will become a standard for many of my other gratin dishes!!

My husband and I have never hated a dish I've made as much as we did this cauliflower dish. All at once tasteless and repulsive, it is the epitome of the reasons why people grow up hating cauliflower. Needless to say, we won't make it again.

I made this recipe and found it a great way to prep a dinner party vegetable in advance but found the flavour too bland. I think I would try making this with an old cheddar or permesan and herbs.

I'm always looking for interesting ways to get vegetables on the table, especially those healthy but less popular selections. I thought this was really tasty, which is pretty impressive for pureed cauliflower!
