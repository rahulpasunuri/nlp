Like many of the other reviewers, I have made this recipe for the Thanksgiving turkey since it was published. It has now become a family tradition and wouldn't be Thanksgiving without it. For the reviewers who have have found it to be dry - just add more broth. I use tukey broth rather than chicken broth, and use much more than is called for in the recipe - probably just over 1 cup - try it and you won't be disappointed.

This past Thanksgiving marks the 10th year I have made this stuffing. For me, making this recipe and "rebelliously" departing from the traditional Thanksgiving meal marks the beginning of my love of cooking. It is my husband's "desert island dish" and I have made it in three states, for many crowds, always exactly as the recipe appears here. We think it is perfect as is and I have passed this receipe along countless times. My teenaged nephews devoured it this past Thanksgiving with one of them eating only this for the next day's leftover's feast. I feel it is best when it is made the day before, then add a bit more broth before cooking. Enjoy!

i have made this every year since it was published. this is a great alternative to traditional bread stuffing. (which i do not care for)i use roasted pablano instead of anaheim chili. it has become a signature item on our thanksgiving table. i use the leftover stuffing for a crust in breakfast casserole for the following weekend. big hit

I did not experience the same situation with dryness that the other reviewers did, in fact it was plenty moist. I am only giving three forks because, I personally didn't love the recipe, it tasted too much like chili to me, but all my guests loved it. Good recipe, but not my thing.

I liked the southwestern flavors; however, the stuffing was dry and crumbly. It was a lot of effort without great results. Perhaps it would have been better with more broth added to give it a more moist texture. This was the first time I have made a cornbread stuffing. I don't plan to try this one again (unless the leftovers turn out better than the day-of result).

I say yes to making it again, but without cornbread. I guess I don't like it in stuffing - it's a little dry and well tastes like corn, (I know, duh). The cornbread was very good on it's own, though. The rest is also very good with a poblano chili added and worth repeating for a southwestern feel to a stuffing.

I've made this the last two Thanksgivings, and everyone loves it! I add chipotle in an adobe sause, enhances the smokey taste of the sausage. I also add diced granny smith apples to balance the heat!

made this last year and again this year for thanksgiving. just delicious. i cheated and used cornbread mix. have made the sausage section as written, and with substitutions of roasted red pepper, and roasted chile pepper (big jim), and adding couple of garlic cloves. also halved recipe easily. i really have to make this more often!

This is the best stuffing recipe. I made it last year to accompany a non-traditional turkey dinner. It was my husband's favorite part of the meal, and he still talks about it. We found the flavor was even better the next day when we ate the leftovers, so I recommend making this dish a day ahead of time and keeping it refrigerated until ready to heat and serve.

I've made this for the last three Thanksgivings -- we can't get enough of it. The chorizo and the chili make it one of the tastiest stuffings I've ever made.

Having been raised in Chicago on the Northwest side the traditional stuffing was sacred witha never-strayed-from recipe. I surprised family with this recipe and they just raved. It is simply excellent and will become a frequently used alternative top the "standard"

I made this and the achiote butter based turkey two years ago when I was stuck far from home and had to fend for myself on Thanksgiving day. It was my first-ever effort cooking a turkey dinner. My mother didn't believe that I'd really cooked (the only thing I'd ever done at home on Thanksgiving day was to set the table) so I froze a serving of each and brought it to her in Boston when I went home for Christmas. She was speechless at first and then called my sister and raved. I even made the stuffing to go with a pork roast the first time I had my future in-laws over for a meal.
