Made a salmon Burrito with Tortilla and Salad. Very good, I would think Black Beans and Spanish rice may go well to depending on how many calories you want to take in.

Good recipe. I wanted something quick to fix, and something that would use up the leftover salmon I had in the refrigerator. Changes: Made my own salsa, because this was a last minute meal, and I didn't have the ingredients on hand for the salsa. Changes in salmon balls: I didn't have parsley or arugula, so I left out the parsley, and used spinach instead. Delicious! My husband said 3.5 forks. I served it with my own salsa, but I also opened a jar of Maui Onion mustard by Beaver, and served that along side. It was really good with the mustard.

Used canned salmon (sorry!) but it was good. Also added some diced sweet onion and red bell pepper. I used whole eggs, wanting the extra thickening power and it worked fine. Did not make the salsa, but instead used a mustard seed sauce that I favor.

these are easy to make and very good. i brought them to work, everyone loved them. the salsa is amazing. i used the fillets from Ikea, they cut up so perfectly. next time i'm adding more bread crumbs and cheese. i couldn't taste the cheese. but i love them, also next time a bigger batch of salsa. even those that don't like salmon should like these.

I have been making this dish for 2 years now and have always received rave reviews. I substitute 3/4 C. plain breadcrumbs for about 2/3 C. seasoned, use only one egg white, add a few more raisins, and have never made the salsa. It is a quick, easy, delicious, filling recipe. The golden raisins add a pleasant sweetness that complements the salmon very well. It takes a bit longer to brown them, perhaps 10 minutes instead of the 4 - 6 the recipe says, but I believe I make them a bit bigger than a walnut.
