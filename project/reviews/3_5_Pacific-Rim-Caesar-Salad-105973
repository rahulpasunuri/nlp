Actually would give it 2 1/2 forks as this was good, but not great. It may be that we are such die-hard true caesar salad aficionados that our judgement was clouded by the title. Try it.

This was excellent and an unusual combo of flavors. Definitely will make this again!

I'll be making this again, with adjustments probably. Very nice taste, not too strong but still flavorful. I served it with grilled shrimp instead of seared scallops.

Made as is, topped with seared scallops. Rave reviews all around. This is a keeper.

Wonderful. Topped it with seared tuna and served extra dressing on the side.

This dressing is absolutely amazing, simple to make, and is even better days later. Delicious!

Wonderful as written! The lime gives it quite a zing as you would guess. My only suggestion from experience would be to use lip balm prior to tasting if your lips are chapped. OUCH!

My very favorite salad recipe. Great with gingered chicken from the South Beach Diet book, too.

This is probably the best salad recipes I have found on epicurious, I really loved it, the combination of flavors is great. It's simple but the dressing has a really nice intensity in the flavor. Awesome variation of the classic caesar.

This was very good I made the whole thing as written. At first it didn't taste much different from regular caesar. After sitting in the refrigerator over night the dressing flavors intensified. I will make sure to always prepare this dressing the day before serving. I love caesar salad and this is a nice twist.

I thought this recipe was fabulous. However, I could not bring myself to add the cheese. Also, the 1/2 cup of oil at the end seemed unnecessary and I left it out. The results were incredible. Also, TOday, I put the leftover dressing on bean sprouts for a quick salad. It was wonderful!

This was the only disappointment in a wonderful Asia-themed meal that included the Miso-Marinated Sea Bass with Beurre Blanc, some Soba-noodle sushi (from Ming Tsai's Blue Ginger Cookbook) and Sticky Rice with Mango.

My husband is a huge fan of traditional caesar salad and he LOVED this version. I marinated tuna and steak in separate asian style marinades and my husband grilled them for yummy side dishes.

THE VERY BEST YET

I was apprehensive about making this because the combination of a ginger-lemongrass dressing with parmesan cheese just didn't sound right. But, intrigued by the reviews, I tried it last night and it was wonderful! The dressing is so delicious with just the right balance of flavors.

This was an excellent addition to a dinner party/BBQ. I made the recipe exactly -- and it was so very tasty. I had to send this link to all of my guests.

I was nervous about the fish sauce so I used half and added anchovies. This was a surprisingly good salad. All my guests raved about it.

Yummy! The flavors here are different and I thought they were a keeper, althought some others did not. I used the vietnamese chili garlic sauce, 1/2 the amt of nam pla, and lemon zest as another reviewer suggested instead of lemon grass.

Haven't yet tried this - but sounds good. I am confused about 'chili-garlic' sauce - should i use the chinese brands that are thick and pasty or use the more common vietnamese chili sauce often seen in a squeezable plastic container?

a teriffic salad and very easy and quick to make with pre washed hearts of Romaine. I did not have lemon grass and used lemon zest instead with fine results.
