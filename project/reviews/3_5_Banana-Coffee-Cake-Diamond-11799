Made this today with some very overripe bananas (I used 4 sm/med) - only other change was I added a bit of cinnamon and used a 9" kuglehopf mold and baked about 48 minutes. This cake was moist, tasty (I think add'l. bananas helped) and perfect. Would definitely make again.

I have made this regularly since it was first published. A HIT with my family and friends. And I don't even like bananas!! :)

Good recipe. I also cut the sugar; used 3 very very ripe bananas, net weight 250 g and 85 g cocoa. I substituted single cream, which I soured with lemon, for sour cream that I didn't have but I will follow the other reviewers suggestion next time I'll use buttermilk. It was a moist chocolate cake with very intense banana flavor.

This is really a chocolate cake and the banana flavor is not all that obvious. I'll stick to a more traditional banana cake next time.

Not a coffee cake. With a full cup of cocoa you can't taste the coffee flavoring, either. But this is a delicious chocolate/banana tea/dessert cake, with a very light, moist crumb. Everyone loved it. Takes very little time to put together, too. I used four small- medium bananas and Scharffenberger cocoa, and it was great. Baked for 55-60 minutes in a 9-inch bundt pan (a few crumbs stuck to the tester near the middle, and upon cooling it was perfect).

Next time I have ripe bananas I'll make a regular banana bread with chocolate chips. Just didn't love the flavor here.

Excellent and easy, though I think a better and more accurate name for this recipe might be Chocolate Banana Bundt Cake. Used four bananas as per the recommendation of prior reviewers so that the resulting cake had a nice mixture of chocolate and banana flavors. Very moist. Just brought this to share during the refreshment period after our Quaker Meeting (church service) and it was gobbled up quickly with many compliments offered.

I can't wait for bananas to get ripe. The taste of banana and chocolate together was very pleasing. All in the family loved it.

Good chocolate cake, but the banana undertone is just ok. For a chocolate Bundt cake, I prefer the Mocha Rum and Chocolate Whiskey Cakes on this site. Baked exactly 50 minutes and it was just right.

I love this recipe. I don't usually like cake because it is usually too dry for my taste, but this cake is amazingly moist! I have made it a few times and it has always turned out great. I add about 3/4 cup chocolate chips and once have used buttermilk instead of sour cream. This is a keeper!!

Another great cake; not sure why it is considered coffee cake. Could easily be a dessert. Easy and very tasty.

Teaches me to read the reviews! I loved this cake -moist and chocolate-y. I will add double bananas next time, as I could barely taste them. I added cinnamon and cardamom, and substituted a tbs of coffee liquor in place of espresso. Lovely texture!

I am surprised at the low rating this recipe has. My children love it, it is easy to make, and tastes delicious. I make it every time we have 3-4 overripe bananas.

I omitted the coffee, and used nearly 3 bananas. We thought it was very moist, extremely chocolatey and banana-y. I'm not a huge banana lover, but my guests took the recipe. Quite a hit.

I thought this cake was wonderful, but I guess that depends on what you are looking for. I was looking for a recipe that used my very ripe bananas that my children will no longer eat, and I wanted something with more flavor than your average banana bread, therefore this was just fabulous. I used four very ripe bananas, and I too added a glaze( 1/2c. chocolate powder, 3/4c. powd. sugar, 1/2t. vanilla & banana ext., and 2T. fat free milk). I would definitely make this again.

A delicious cake. It has a strange taste that makes you wonder.If i had the chance to rename it i will call it : mistory cake .It`s my family favoruit.

This gets raves every time I make it. Each time that I bring it to work, someone inevitably asks for the recipe. There is nothing wrong w/ the cocoa measurement. I use buttermilk instead of sour cream, as I prefer the texture that buttermilk produces.

The name of this cake is definitely misleading. It is truly a CHOCOLATE cake with a slight hint of banana. The texture is light and moist. I used very ripe bananas, but will try making it again with overly ripe bananas. Hopefully the banana flavor will be more prominent. I added chocolate chips and glazed it with a chocolate/rum glaze.

I wonder if the coco is wrong seams to be way to much, some one needs to check the amount of coco needed

This is definately a chocolate cake. I even increased the bananas from 2 to 4, and decreased the cocoa. It was moist enough, but bo resemblance to a coffee or banana cake.

WONDERFUL, just simply superb! Baking is my passion and I've been at it for many years; rarely do I come across a recipe such as this. I loved the light texture coupled with the intense flavor. And what a nice way to use up those ever-present too-ripe bananas :-) Their faint taste + espresso = flavor of liqueur, almost. Too bad the name doesn't accurately reflect the cocoa. I streamlined the mixing procedure (i.e., beat bananas and sour cream right into butter/sugar/etc., then sifted dry ingredients into same bowl). The cake was wonderful a few hours after baking as well as the next day. Usually I play with a recipe the next few times, but with this one, I wouldn't change a thing.

this is really a chocolate cake - misleading title. it's very good, I don't like bananas but I would eat this cake every week - a little moister and richer than your average easy chocolate cake - and maybe healthier? potassium - you can easily use extra bananas

Absolutely the best cake I ever made! I increased the bananas to 4 small and decreased the white sugar to 3/4 cup. Great for breakfast.

It's very moist and soft, not too sweet and easy to make. It has lots of chocolate flavor with a touch of banana flavor. My family loved it!

To enhance the flavor and texture of this cocoa cake, I added 1/3 cup Jif Extra-Crunchy peanut butter, which complemented the chocolate flavor very nicely. I also used pan release spray in my bundt pan with poor results (parts of the cake top stuck). Be sure to use the best quality cocoa powder available, which is key to keeping this cake's flavor from being bland. I agree, the cake would be more aptly named "Banana Espresso Cake" so as not to be misleading (although it DOES go well with a robust cup of java!).

I used three bananas, added chocolate chips adn chopped pecans. For the icing I used a thick fudge drizzle, flavored with coffee and just the slightest bit of cinnamon. I am a choclate cake fan, and it was a certainly a variation of the many ways to show off choclate. The banana gave it a level of interest beyond just sweet! It is defintely part of my permanent collection.

I was quite disappointed with this recipe. It turned out to be a very ordinary cake with little banana taste (although I used 3 bananas). Perhaps the chocolate overwhelmed the bananas, but I wouldn't call it a good chocolate cake either. Also, I suppose this was called a coffee cake because it actually has coffee in it. I was looking for a true coffee cake, similar to a banana pecan coffee cake I had at Macrina's Bakery recently. I was surprised not to find anything similar in the vast Gourmet repertoire.

Great cake! I added an extra banana and chocolate chips as suggested - it was delicious!

A good plain chocolate cake--not too sweet, tender and moist when made the same day and let cool. Texture suffers the second day, though. I used a light spray of Baker's Joy and the cake unmolded perfectly. Still, too much effort for a somewhat boring cake--more like a black forest cake than a banana cake.

Heavenly ! I used a high quality unsweented cocoa. It was very chocolaty. Cake is very moist and the banana & chocolate combination is wonderful. I sprinkled it with confectioners sugar! Yum ! Yum !

My mom had made this recipe and found it to be fair but with potential. She made it again but added another banana and a cup of chocolate chips. My husband and I couln't get enough and now it's one of our favorites.

Rich, moist, very good. The flavour does indeed improve and mellow after leaving the cake overnight. I've made this cake several times -- one of my favourite ways to use overripe bananas. It's more a regular snacking cake than a "coffee cake," but so what -- it's delicious nonetheless.

very moist and tasty. name is misleading I felt. Should be chocholate banana cake. Not what I was expecting for a coffee cake.
