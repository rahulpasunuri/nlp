This is sooo good and sooo easy. It's a great way to enjoy vegetables in winter. Like other reviewers, I opted to make my own vinaigrette. I couldn't find garlic and herb feta so I used feta mixed with olives instead. Next time, I would use a bit more mint. It really made the dish special.

Great dish! Quick and easy to prepare. I've made it several times now, and I increase the amount of veggies the recipe calls for because they shrink quite a bit after you broil them. Other than that, I didn't change anything. I usually pair this with the Grilled Lemon and Rosemary Chicken from this site (minus the grilled lemon). Delicious!

I made this exactly as per the recipe with the addition of cherry tomatoes. It was delicious! Keep the mint - it adds a nice dimension to the flavors. Quick and easy. Will definitely make it again.

This recipe comes out kind of like a salad. To make it more pleasing to those who think all pasta should be saucey, I added 1/2 of sour cream.

We enjoyed this dish - I suspect the original recipe is very good but we did some tweaking. The oven wasn't working so we cooked the vegetables outside on the grill (incredible!), added grilled yellow peppers, cherry tomatoes and mushrooms; and fresh basil. I'd increase the vegetable to pasta ratio next time.

I was unsure on how the feta cheese would be with this but I was extremely pleased. This is an excellent dish. I didn't use the mint though and added some garlic instead (even with the garlic-and-herb feta cheese I thought it needed it). Would I make this dish again? YES!

Very easy, very tasty, and quick just like it advertises. Just what I was looking for. I added broccoli - it'd be easy to add other veggies. My fiance and I both thought it was a great weeknight meal and will definitely be making it again soon.

Really, really yummy! Very flavorful. We left out the mint (it seems bitter to me), but the feta melted into the dressing and made the best sauce for the pasta and veggies. Made it for guests as a quick dinner before a show and it was a HIT.

This is a great healthy and quick meal. I have made it several times this summer, but add more vegetables.

Wow! I must say I was very doubtfull about this recipe, plain pasta and veggies? Well, turned out to be the most surprisingly delicious pasta dish I have made recently!

I used 4 oz. of feta cheese instead of 2. Turned out to be absolutely delicious. My fiance, who's a very picky eater, loved it as well.

Excellent dish. Easy to prepare ahead of time and roast the veggies while pasta is cooking. Would add a few extra vegetables next time. Good the next day cold or warm. Great dish for dinner guest.

Love this dish. Like my favorite pasta from Noodles and Company, Pasta Fresca. And I don't hwave to wait in line to get it! I too used my own balsamic and olive oil mix and used red onion and zukes, not a fan of peppers. Great dish and having it again next week when we go skiing. Easy and delicious!

This is a great pasta salad that I have made at least ten times. It is always the hit at every pot luck or gathering I take it to. I prefer rotini pasta rather than penne but would not change a thing other than that. It is a great easy dish.

Yummy. Took the advice of others and made a few changes. Added a vidalia onion and made my own balsamic mixture. Easy and yummy. The response was not great when I told my husband we were having pasta with veggies for dinner - once he tasted it his opinion changed and he had two bowls! This one is a keeper for sure.

A delicious, simple, after-work recipe. This was well received at my spur of the moment gathering. I added yellow peppers and in the future might add eggplant, onions, and garlic. Both guests asked for the recipe. Would make a great, different cold pasta salad for a picnic. The mint is unexpected and refreshing.

This is a great recipe for weeknights when you don't have a lot of time to cook. I make my own very simple balsamic vinaigrette, with two parts olive oil to one part balsamic vinegar, and salt and pepper to taste. This makes the flavor of the vinegar really stand out. I agree with the other reviewers that it makes excellent leftovers, and can also be served cold as a summer pasta salad.

I coldn't find the garlic herb feta so I used the tomato basil instead and added bermuda onions and yellow peppers, I also omitted the mint, added more balsamic vinegar as the others suggested and thought it was simple, versatile, and delicious.

This is good cold too. Easy to make. I added more dressing since the first time I made it, it seemed dry. Its one I'd make again. The feta & mint really make it interesting.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I liked the boost of flavor from the feta cheese and the ease of using bottled dressing.

I prepared this dish two times. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly. It was good but a little bland and dry. The second time, I experimented. I added marinated, grilled chicken, increased the amount of balsamic dressing and used grated parmesan instead of feta. It was delicious!

A a little bland. Would add more balsamic vinegar and some finely crushed garlic,for more flavor. Easy to make, great left over warm or cold.

A well-received, simple dish...easily prepared in the midst of the 3-boy-end-of-the-day-just-got-home-from-work chaos that invariably prevails in my kitchen. The recipe doubles well (almost triples, really...) and was still tasty for leftover lunches.
