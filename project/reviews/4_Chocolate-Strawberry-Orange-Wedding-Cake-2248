I made this cake a lot years ago, and I just made it again- it's a fabulous cake for the chocolate-orange lover. Skip the strawberry and substitute marmalade- you can't taste the strawberry- and use ANY buttercream but the recipe here for the exterior. I finally made it, despite warnings in the reviews, instead of substituting something else, and boy it sucks. Much too thin.

My first wedding cake and a huge hit. Very easy to make. Here are the amendments I made to this recipe: (1) Basted each cake layer with Grand Marnier; (2) Between each layer, I substituted Strawberry Ganache (not great reviews) with chopped fresh strawberries folded into homemade whip cream with a 1/4-1/2 tsp of strawberry flavor; and (3) Used White Chocolate Frosting over each stacked tier BUT finished entire cake with homemade whip cream and decorated white gum paste roses. Beautiful but more importantly was delicious!

I baked this cake in heart pans or a friend's wedding shower and it was wonderful.

The cake was good. I think it ended up being a bit expensive to make and that made it not worth it really. The strawberry flavor isn't really there and the white chocolate frosting was a pain to work with. Make sure you use barred white chocolate and not white chocolate chips (rookie mistake).

This is delicious! The strawberry doesn't really come through, and I might not bother with the slippery jam layer in the future. I made this twice - for the practice cake, I forgot to add the chocolate chips to the batter, and that cake ended up much more stable, and plenty chocolatey enough. I reccomend leaving the chips out if you have any sort of height goals...

I first made this recipe when it came out in 1996 for my daughter's high school grauation; it was a huge success. I have made it several times since as birthday cakes (cutting the recipe down, and it is always a big hit. One of the best cake recipe ever.

I made this cake twice and it sank like a rock in the center both times. The flavor was delicious, and I would love to use it-I'm surprised no one else has had this problem. I'm an experienced cake baker and have made many wedding cakes.

This was a very expensive and very disappointing cake. We tried it in a slab version for our engagement part as a test run for the wedding. Good thing! We wont be making it again! It did taste ok, however given the expense and the time to make, it just isn't worth it.

This is a tasty and easy cake. I made it in a rectangular cake pan as the other half of a graveyard base for a haunted gingerbread mansion. I used 3/4 of the chocolate chips and replaced the other quarter with finely chopped Valhrona Guanaja; I also added chopped crystallised orange peel to the batter. I split it and filled it with caramel, orange curd, blood orange marmalade, and orange buttercream, and covered the outside with the chocolate-strawberry ganache made with blood-orange marmalade instead of strawberry jam. It was fabulous as long you really like chocolate and orange.I thought the cake was very moist and the ganache recipe worked well- so appreciative of the helpful words of other reviewers when choosing which chocolate cake recipe to use!

I also had a little trouble with the frosting - even though I used less cointreau than the recipe called for. The results overall were spectacular, however. I made this for a friend's wedding (as the groom's cake) and the guests raved about it. The cake itself was yummy and the filling was divine! People even asked if I was a professional baker!

This cake was phenominal and a big hit with everyone at the reception. I used the frosting as the base coat for rolled fondant. It is however, difficult to spread the frosting over the strawberry jam without them mixing together. My solution: pipe the white chocolate frosting on top of the jam. No spreading neccesary!

I made this cake for my grandparents' 50th wedding anniversary. There was no end to the compliments, the cake was completely polished off by a group of typically non-cake eaters. After reading the other reviews, I halfed the amount of orange liquer in the frosting and added about 3/4 tsp orange extract, which gave the frosting a more firm consistancy. I followed the recipe and had no problems with the cake, it is a superb recipe

I made this cake for my wedding in august of 2002, it was fantastic and a big hit. I thought it would be complicated by lookin at the recipe, but it wasnt, i made a couple batches, and after the first time, the next was simple. I actually baked the cakes a week before, froze them, then did the filling and filled them the nite before the wedding, also made the frosting the nite before(with white chocolate melting chips, much easier)and frosted and decorated the next day. The frosting was hard, but i just put it in the microwave for a few and it was fine. No body believed that i did it myself. Saved a lot of money and had a different tasting wedding cake, not to sweet, and the ganache was wonderful. The cake itself tasted great, i served it with a little ganache on the side of the plate.

I made this scrumptious, truffle-like cake last week for my sister's bridal shower last Saturday. I found it to be, overall, very easy to make and assemble. I read the reviews and added just 1/4 cup (2 TBSP per batch) of liquer to the frosting. I had wonderfully easy-to-work-with frosting, but it did get soft quickly at room temp (but also got chilled quickly). I couldn't taste any hint of orange in the frosting, though, (it was still delicious!!) so may substitute orange extract next time. Also transported it 4hrs in the car in coolers (smaller cakes) or surrounded in ice packs (large cake) and did the final frosting on site (also transported 2nd batch of prepared frosting and it was fine). It was delicious and very well received by all. the ganache and strawberry jam are excellent touches. We've been eating leftovers every day since (they're gone today) and were happy to have them to eat. I think that it can easily serve more than 50...the big cake can serve 40, then you still have the 8", and 5", too, if you want.

This was, with minor variations (mostly in decoration) our wedding cake. Also a major compliment-generator! As in, "...best cake of any kind I've ever eaten." As for frosting problems: the frosting is more like a ganache than a cream-cheese frosting, since it has so much white chocolate. It is very temperature sensitive. If you want to make sure your cake turns out, make a practice cake with the same frosting (smaller recipe, of course!) a few weeks or so before making this one. That will give you an opportunity to see what temperatures and ods give best spreadability and hold. I would refrigerate the wedding cake before presenting, and display and cut it in an air-conditioned or cool environment. I had a little problem getting the frosting smooth enough for piping, but a practice batch fixed that. If you don't use ganache frequently, you might want to use a ganache filling in your practice cake, too. Practice makes gorgeous, and you get to have an extra cake - and eat it, too!

Just presented the finished cake at my Father's 55th birthday party. While I hoped I would fair better than my cooking peers here at epicurious, alas, I must say I am only pleasantly average. I too experienced a challenge with the frosting. The cake is heavy (weight). The MINIATURE chocolate chips (use tiny tiny chips) are a delightful surprise. I made the cake and ganache during one evening, the frosting the next evening. Assembled the cake the following day. The frosting became the texture of firm "Cool Whipped Topping." And just as cool whip will tend to ooze and melt, so too will this frosting. Even after setting all night, the frosting only "elevated" itself to the stature of "firm" whipped topping. HOWEVER, I must say I believe the taste of the frosting redeems the texture. Because I anticipated problems with the frosting, I made a batch of white chocolate ganache. The cake was assembled following the directions, yet for the crumb coating of frosting, I used a WHITE chocolate ganache. (Simply use guava, apricot, or marmalade and orange shavings, white chocolate and whipping cream. Add a little confectioner's sugar and a sprinkle or two of cornstarch if necessary.) Therefore, my cake was chocolate, bittersweet chocolate ganache, strawberry jam, crumb coated with white ganache and frosted with the orange frosting. IF you intend to pipe the icing (I piped my in a basketweave) SHAVE SHAVE SHAVE the white chocolate. I piped the icing and had tiny (about the size of a pinhead) bits of chocolate interrupt my beautiful basketweave design. The bits of chocolate, which weren't shaved, did not completely melt and therefore stuck on the teeth of the piping tip. Please email me with your thoughts. I intend to make this cake again. For those who don't like the combination of chocolate, strawberry, and orange... Well, you just don't know what tastes good : ) : ) Happy cooking to all.

Well, what did I do wrong?! It came out so dense and heavy. The taste was great, but I don't want such a heavy cake for my wedding. I'll try a lighter recipe next time. The ganache is to die for, though!

I made only the cake, not the frosting. It was the best chocolate cake I have ever had! My non-sweet tooth partner said that it was a 20 on a scale of 10. My one cautionary note for somebody making it for the first time: this is a very tender and moist cake; make sure to fully cover the bottom of the pan with parchment. I baked a 12x16 layer, which is always tricky with chocolate and the edges broke off a little when I unmolded it. I concealed it with frosting, but I'll be more careful in the future.

I have made this cake for three weddings. I personally think this reciepe is what started my catering buisness. A friend said that the cake was so good it would make you slap your momma. I have made it with the dark chocolate and with the semi- sweet and I prefer the semi-sweet and instead of Orange liquere, I use triple sec. It can be havew a strong almost overwhelming flavor with the dark choc. and the orange liquere. I love it!

Made this cake for my niece's wedding reception on 12/15. Everybody loved it! I decorated it with freeze-dried pansies (available at Sur La Table) arranged on the top, cascading diagonally to the bottom layer. I also used Boyajian Orange Oil in the frosting and the cake; it gave the cake a wonderful scent and it added more flavor than just the Cointreau or orange zest. Used 2 teaspoons in cake; for frosting - add 1 tsp orange oil into measuring cup before measuring Cointreau. For those concerned about thin frosting, use only orange oil - omit Cointreau.

I had this cake made for my wedding and it was a huge success! The best cake I've ever had, but I'm a chocoholic too. The chef had to substitute raspberry for the strawberry, but it was delicious. We served it after the wedding dinner with a New Zealand dessert wine - Noble Riesling 1999. They complimented each other perfectly.

I made this cake for my sister's wedding party and it was a big hit. Everybody really enjoyed it, however I had a problem with the frosting. I made the cake a second time for a birthday and I had the same problem with the frosting. The consistency of the frosting was not thick and I wanted to know if there was something that I could've done to make the frosting thicker.

I didn't make this for a wedding, so I only made one batch of the batter and used two 9-inch cake pans. Warning: either use 10-inch cake pans or remove about one cup of the batter. I had batter leaking out onto my oven! Yes, as previous reviewers mentioned, the frosting is runny. I made this cake on a hot day and had a bit of a problem trying to spread it on the cake. To compensate I did the following: first, I crumb coated the cake and stuck it in the freezer and also refrigerated the frosting for about an hour. After an hour, the cake was nicely chilled, the frosting was firm and it made spreading the frosting much easier. Unfortunately, when I served the cake the next day after it had been sitting out for a few hours the frosting began softening and started to slide off of the cake. My advice: make this cake in the winter time!

This cake was delicious as is without the frosting and fillings, and fairly simple to make. It is very rich with the fillings and small piece is recommended. I'm rating the cake 3 forks but would give the filled and frosted cake 2 forks. I think I would skip the jam layer and use a bit less liquer in the frosting so the cream cheese flavor is more pronounced. This cake is thankfully not too sweet, but a little too rich. I think an orange pastry cream type filling would be better.

I made this cake for my mother's 80th birthday party and it was a huge sucess. Not only did it look beautiful,it was moist, and the balance between the bittersweet chocolate, orange, and strawberry flavorings was perfect. I did find the frosting difficult to work with. My first batch of frosting was softer than I could easily work with. It was a hot day so I refrigerated the cake and continued the next day paying special attention to the temperature of the butter, cream cheese, and chocolate. This batch was perfect. Ommiting the top layer, I made the 12" layers and the 8" layers using all of the cake batter. Cooking time was 5 minutes more for the 12" and 3-4 for the 8" layer. I used roses instead of strawberries to decorate. It was the final touch to a beautiful day

I made this for my own wedding 5 years ago as a four tiered cake. It was the best cake I have ever eaten! We even had to transport it in post-hurricane Bertha winds to the hotel we were married in!! I also made a two layer version for my husband's 35th birthday. Quite a wonderful special occasion cake

I made this cake in a rectangle on two half sheet pans. The crunch of the chips is wonderful! The cake was soooo moist and delicious. I did not have any orange liquor. I substituted a T. of orange extract. Lovely!

This was my first wedding cake. I made it for a friend's wedding, and I also had people come up to me and tell me that though they don't usually like wedding cake, this one was great. The white chocolate frosting was delicious but difficult to work with and very soft. I added some powdered sugar to it, though this didn't help very much.

A friend and I made this cake as a surprise for a co-worker who was getting married, for an office party. I think this is the most crowd-pleasing recipe I've ever made. I intend to experiment with cutting it down for other events. It's great!

I made this cake for a friend's wedding. I wasn't sure about how to increase the proportions to serve more than 50, so I made two cakes. There were about 80 people there, but all the cake got eaten! Definitely the best wedding cake I've had.

We attended 4 wedding receptions and none compared with this delicious cake I made myself for our wedding. It is so substantial and very satisfying to eat, much unlike the big "birthday cake" wedding cakes that are sugary. Everyone took a big piece home with them and all raved at the glory of this magical cake. It has been 3 1/2 years since our wedding and we always reflect on the wonderful cake we made together for our wedding party. This cake is unequalled by any other.

This is a great wedding cake to make. I experimented with several different types (much to the delight of my co-workers!) before we decided on the best recipe. The orange and chocolate flavours are classic. The cake is moist and relatively easy to make. Highly reccomended!
