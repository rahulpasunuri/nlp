We made this using prosciutto instead of bacon, but the quantity was too much. We estimated. I would make this again without the meat, and I would not cook the arugula. I would just toss it in at the very end. Also, we added a fresh heirloom tomato, which was a nice touch. I'll try garlic too. But it was easy, very colorful, and tasty.

I love all the ingredients individually -- bacon, green onions, arugula, basil -- but in combination they were awful; just too many flavors going on.

Very beautiful presentation...lots of colors, flavors, textures. We loved it...what about some pine nuts on top?

I gave this three forks because of all the positive feedback, but I thought it was a little Too "bacony." Yeah I know, I read the recipe beforehand too. I also used spinach as there was no arugula to be found locally, which worked great, and added some garlic with the crushed red pepper. I think this is a great base for a different dish. Next time I will try mushrooms or artichokes instead of the bacon, and also not bother adding parmesan in first, as it made glue on my serving spoon instead of coating the pasta.

This is a quick and easy dish that I will make again. I added some extras though. I used spinach instead of argula and added garlic and mushrooms that I had on hand. I also threw in a dash of oregano to give a little more flavor. I would not drain the diced tomatoes all the way either. I liked having a little more sauce.

This was awesome. I added quite a bit of garlic to it though. And since I don't like huge chunks of tomatos, next time I'll probably use tomato paste instead. But overall very yummy.

Delicious and easy! I used fresh spinach since I don't like arugula, otherwise I made the recipe as written. A nice light tasting meal and a definite keeper.

Add a little garlic, maybe 1 clove for every two people, gives it a nice added flavor...

Try this with bleu cheese instead of parm. Nice change.

this dish is excellent. instead of the arugula I used spinach and it turned out excellent. So good that is has become an instant favorite at the restaurant that I am a manager at.

My housemates were skeptical while I was making it, but it ended up tasting great. If you can't afford the arugula and basil leaves (if they aren't in season) you can just go for lettuce. Perhaps not as gourmet, but college guys don't mind so much.

This was tasty enough, although it didn't wow me. Like a previous reviewer, I simply sprinkled the cheese on top - I don't like the gluey globs that sometimes result when you toss cheese with hot pasta. I didn't add the cooked bacon until the last minute, so that it would stay a little crisper. I'd make again for a quick weeknight meal.

I had to do a lot of substituting - but this was still great. Even my picky eater liked it - and he doesn't like much of what I decide to try my hand at. I didnt have fresh basil, and I didnt have white wine. I actually used a bit of olive oil, veg. broth and white vinegar to take the place - and it was still good. Will def. make it again a bit closer to the recipe.

Excellent recipe! It was quick, easy and very flavourful. I used turkey bacon as I don't eat regular bacon and it still tasted delicious. I'll be making it again.

This was eaten with gusto by my crew. As there were no green onions or basil in my market (it's November and we're very seasonal here) I used garlic and let the rucola predominate. Also, I got "baby" rucola and did not need to add it until I tossed the pasta with the sauce or it would have been cooked to mush. Final note: adding cheese until it "melts and coats the pasta" in my experience means it coats the pot and what's left sticks together in clumps. It was great just sprinkling the cheese on top.

My boyfriend LOVED this dish - said it replaced his favorite dish that I prepare for him regularly. Will definitely make this again - tasty and oh, so easy!

This was tasty...a LOT of herbs. My husband and I liked, but our daughter wasn't so crazy about it. I actually substituted sorrel, abundant in our garden now, for the arugula, which worked fine. Use the whole cup of parmesan.

easy to make, used spinach as arugula couldn't be found.

Very Good! I couldn't get argula in our small area, so I used spinach. It works.

A coworker prepared this and shared with me. We both thought it was very good and I plan to add it to my recipe box.

If you prefer a heavy pasta sauce this is not the dish for you. There is no need to deviate from this recipe as flavors blend to perfection. Fresh herbs are a must!!! We served with sour dough and a good Chardonnay and finished off with a snifter of Amaratto Disaronno. The only negative is...this recipe needs a classier name.
