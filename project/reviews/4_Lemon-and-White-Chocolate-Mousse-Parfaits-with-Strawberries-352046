Excellent dessert! I used fresh blueberries rather than strawberries and served the dessert in stemless martini glasses. A great dessert for serving at home or taking to a dinner party!

I took the advice of other reviewers and added a little more lemon peel to the lemon mousse, and I'm glad I did it. I also used one layer of strawberries and used raspberries for the second fruit layer. It turned out absolutely delicious! A big hit with all guests. Will definitely make it again.

this was good and relatively simple, but i wouldn't call it exceptional. i was hoping for more of a silky, mousse texture rather than a "flavored whipped cream" texture. i found that the flavors and texture are much better after chilling in the fridge over night. if making again, i would try it with raspberries to take advantage of the complimentary raspberry lemonade flavors.

When I started getting this together I thought I might have gotten in over my head but the results were tremendous and making it was fun (although my husband whipped the cream). I love light desserts and this one hit the spot. I do think we could have added more white chocolate for a stronger chocolate flavor. Definately will make again.

I made this for my sister's wedding - it was a huge hit! I used La Maison Du Chocolat Dark Chocolate Pearls and I thought that it added an exceptional flare to it. A must for all dessert lovers.

Easy, yes, but not that much mousse flavor. Tasted very whip creammy. Was looking for a stronger lemon and white chocolate flavor. If I made it again, I would boost the amount of lemon and white chocolate next time.

Fantastic! This a great, fresh dessert and perfect for summer. I might add a bit more white chocolate next time, as others have said, but it was really good as is, too.

Made this for a dinner party - went over very well! There was a TON of food, and I was afraid nobody would eat any dessert at all...I was thinking I might skip it, too, and save the parfait for later. I needn't have worried - every guest ate every last drop. Including me! Only thing to note is that I tried to use 3.5 oz of white chocolate but, maybe because I was using chips instead of a bar (I measured after it had been chopped), it wasn't enough. The white chocolate mousse hardly tasted like chocolate. I'd double the amount next time around - but, again, I didn't start with a bar.

I made this with my boyfriend a few days ago, soooooooooo yummy! My boyfriend tried the first one and had a genuine look of fascination with this dessert we had just made. Anything that makes my boyfriend that happy is worth all four forks. The mousse was very easy to make, fun to taste along the way. We threw in some blackberries and those were good too. In my boyfriends on campus housing we didn't have an electric mixer, but we hand whipped the cream, probably tasted that much better with the hard work. The distinct flavors of the white chocolate and lemon really stood out independently of each other, then come together once you start chewing. HIGHLY recommend this recipe

I made this for Easter dinner dessert and it was a huge hit. I liked a previous reviewers idea of whipping up the extra egg whites and folding into the mousse base and did that as well. I used champagne glasses and didn't find it too time consuming to make.

I was not hopeful about this being the amazing dessert it was. But I loved it, so did my guests and my kids, who'd been living on Easter basket chocolate for the day. This recipe is a winner. I followed the recipe exactly and it was really perfect. I didn't have parfait glasses, didn't feel like picking any up, so I used wine glasses, and martini glasses. Very pretty and fun.

Pretty amazing. Tried it on a whim. I did add extra white chocolate, about 2 oz more. Perfect otherwise, and a light taste to it.

Made this dessert for work today, FABULOUS!!It was so light, just right for summer. I did use mixed berries, topped with a small swirl of fresh whipped cream & a strawberry fan, very pretty...

I made this last night but changed it a bit. Instead of making two separate mousses, I made the lemon base and then added 1 cup of white chocolate to it. I also increased the amount of fresh lemon juice to 3/4 cup and whipping cream to 3 cups. It is spectacular! I would definitely make this again.

I picked up glasses from Z gallerie they looked like a perfect match to the picture

Very easy, however I think I'll double the white chocolate mousse...it didn't seem like enough to distinguish the layers of lemon.

While this was quite attractive, I thought it was a lot of trouble for some flavored whipped cream. I didn't care for the combination of the lemon and the fairly bland white chocolate.

This was so good and easy to make. A great dessert to make ahead the day before. I will be making this again!! Using fresh fruit is a must! If strawberries are not available, I think you can easily substitute another berry fruit. I used parfait glasses - but if you don't have them anything else will do - wine glass, martini glass or even some type of small bowl/ramekin will do the trick.

I made a dark chocolate mouse and a lemon mouse to layer between the strawberries and added some toasted almonds for crunch. Unfortunately, i made this in wine glasses and it was a bit overwhelming. Go for champagne flutes for a more delicate desert and for an attractive presentation.

Served this last night to dinner guests. Easy recipe, but time consuming. I thought it needed a layer of cake - even store bought angel food -- something to offset the mousse. It wasn't as big of a hit as I thought it would be.

to samanthasdad in CA, that is a fantastic idea! I will have to do that next time. And I agree with everyone, it a great touch for dessert.

Light and refreshing, the contrast of the lemon and the strawberries was a hit. Strained the lemon custard. Served with chocolate filled Pirouette cookies inserted in the parfaits.

Agree with other reviewers that this a great light dessert that is worth the effort for a special occasion. I also recommend straining the lemon curd.

I made this for Easter. It was very good. Because some of guests didn't like sugar and others didn't like white chocolate, I made some sugar free with splenda, some with creme fraiche instead of chocolate mousse. All three versions were delicious.

Fabulous. Elegant. Easy. My dinner guests loved every bite.

Great finish to our Easter dinner. Like others, I made it the day before and finished it off with a bit of fresh mint. The lemon is a bit tart but it works well with the chocolate. I also added vanilla bean seeds to the chocolate.

I doubled the recipe but had a little trouble with the lemon curd which was a little looser than the wh.choco mousse layer was. While it was good, I wouldn't bother making it again. Too many pans/layers/steps for no oohs and aahs from guests.

I have made this a number of times and it has been a hit each time. It is perfect for a dinner party where you want to have as much prepared ahead of time as possible. I always make these a day ahead and have them ready for a perfect finale.

Awesome recipe! Nice and light, very summery... I am gonna try it with raspberries the next time I make it. Also, to cut down on the fat content, I substituted the left over egg whites for half of the heavy cream. I whipped the eggs whites alone first, then the cream and folded them together. Worked perfectly!

Really nice, light and refreshing dessert. My only suggestion is to strain the lemon curd prior to folding in the whipped cream.

I made this for my parents and my boyfriend and they all loved me and asked me to make it again for Easter. My dad actually asked me if there was anymore but I cut the recipe in half so there was enough just for four people. I left out the lemon zest and the lemon mousse was still really good. The white chocolate mousse was good too but my family mostly liked the lemon. One thing that I would do differently is to cut the strawberries into little chunks. I left mine in slices and the strawberries I used were pretty big so it wouldv'e been nice to just have bite size pieces.

LEMON AND WHITE CHOCOLATE MOUSSE

This was just delicious. You will have lots of dishes when you are done, but the result is well worth it. The kids thought the lemon curd was a bit too tart - if you are making it for kids, you might consider using less / skipping that layer in their parfaits.

Make this exactly as the recipe dictates. It iw a fantastic dessert for a heavy meal. Where can one buy the parfait glasses?
