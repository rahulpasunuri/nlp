These turned out very well. I didn't have any cardamom, but I used all the other spices, and thought the flavors were yummy. I had quite a bit of the spicy cheese left over. Great right out of the oven.

Was very impressed with flavor/texture of straws and would definitely make again. However, I adjusted the spices to my taste and instead used sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and garlic with the Parmesan - Wow! Puff pastry was difficult to work with as it warmed up; might have worked better if rechilled part way through process. Straws were best right after baking; they just weren't as crisp when reheated.

I don't know what all the other reviewers were thinking. These were great! The cumin and coriander seeds added something to the otherwise boring pastry. Do what you would like with these, the basice premise is to fill the sheet with different flavors and bake. Easy and are always a great hit at my cocktail parties.

Yuk! Out of 15 people tonight at dinner, only one person liked these! Which is fine with me, because I cannot seem to get the hang of puff pastry anyhow!

Boy, they really weren't kidding when they called these "spiced cheese straws!" I'm not sure what the point of the cheese is, since the spices completely obliterated the taste of it (especially the cayenne). This coming from a person who loves spicy foods! I still would like them, and might even make them again, if they weren't such a pain. The puff pastry was uncooperative, to say the least, and no matter how hard I rolled the layers together, there's no way they would have stuck, because of the cheese and spices between them. I had to handle each layer individually. Definitely not worth the effort!

Threw them together in the hour before a party - a little messier than I thought, but even using puff pastry that had been in the freezer FOREVER, they got rave reviews and recipe requests. Also, I just used cumin, cayenne and salt, as i didn't have coriander seeds or ground cardamom on hand. Great with beer and wine.

I wondered how this would be with the cayenne, but it wasn't too hot. It was very good and easy too. It was a hit at Thanksgiving and I would make it again.

I made these for Thanksgiving last year and they disappeared right away. I will be putting them on this year's menu as well.

I thought this sounded great but wasn't thrilled with the flavor combinations. If I make it again, I will add my own herb/spice combination.

Great with champagne.

a hit with picky adults and kids at thanksgiving dinner. i couldn't get all the cheese filling into the puff pastry sheets, so i had to make double the amount of straws, but it was still very good and tasty even though each straw only contained half the cheese filling recommended.
