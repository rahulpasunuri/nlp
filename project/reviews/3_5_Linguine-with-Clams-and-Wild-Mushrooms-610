I made this mostly to recipe, except that I added thyme and used canned clams, and added the clam juice to the wine. I simmered the mixture down to half, then I then added the pasta, slightly undercooked, and the mushrooms, with the idea that I would finish the pasta in the sauce and thicken it with pasta starch. Great idea, but I ended up at the end with too much liquid after all... so for us it was a little soupy, but still delicious!

My boyfriend and i really enjoyed this recipe - quick and easy to make, and delicious too. Also, it is remarkably low cal and low fat for a meal so filling. I had some fresh baby spinach leaves (about a cup) in the fridge so I tossed those in with the pan with the mushrooms when the mushrooms were cooked about halfway through. It made a nice addition, although the recipe would be great without them, too.

OK, I used canned clams--but as I had oyster mushrooms, I figured I couldn't go wrong, and I was right. I'm generally not the biggest fan of shellfish, but I think I'm being converted! Next time I will use fresh clams as called for. Bonus points to this recipe for being very fast and easy to prepare, and for inspiring The Look of Lurve in my honey's eyes.

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe! I substituted baby Portobella mushrooms (next time I'll try the oyster & shiitake mushrooms) and added 1 tablespoon of butter, 1 teaspoon of thyme, and some clam juice in the sauce. It was delicious and so easy. . .I'll definitely make this recipe again!

The variety of mushrooms dazzles the taste buds. Used fresh organic herb linguine instead or dry linguine, tasted great. Watched those clams, I accidentally overcooked mine! But, overall the dished was tasty and delicious. I plan to make it again, this time w/ all eyes on the clams!

I liked this dish --very light and not too heavy. I served this for a holiday dinner of 6 guests and everyone raved about it. My market did not have oyster mushrooms so I made some substitutions with portabello mushrooms instead. Turned out very nicely.

Delicious both ways previously mentioned. Many guests find it difficult to deal with clam shells at a dinner party; hence, while hosting, I remove the clams from the shells after they've opened. This recipe requires little more than some finely chopped parsley, pargiano-regianno shaved over the top, and a lovely chianti. Ciao!

This is a wonderfully simple dish that allows the subtle flavors of wild mushrooms to come through. The clams enhance the earthy quality and the red pepper flakes add just a hint of heat. Why do Americans want to ruin every dish with cream and cheese???? This is fine the way it is!

Although the dish came out very good and took little preparation it was missing something. A added 3/4 cup of cream and a half cup of parmesan cheese. After that there were no leftovers to be had......
