Every year we eagerly inspect the fava bean plants in our garden in anticipation of making this dish. I have never seen favs beans for sale anywhere. Some info I wish I had when first growing favss - 3 coups of shelled favs beans requires about 6 quarts of pods, don't harvest the pods until they are about 3/4" wide. I only blanch the beans, and don't cook them further at all. Overcooking will ruin the beans. Yum! One of our favorite meals, we also add pancetta and make a main meal of it.

This recipe was delicious! I used it as directed and served it as a main vegetarian meal along with a cherry tomato salad. I spritz some lemon on top of the pasta once it was on the plate and it added a night bit of freshness at the very end. I am so glad I tried this one!

I admit it: I hate beans. I also know they're good for me so I thought this would be a great way to sneak them into my diet. YUM! At the risk of sounding gauche, I used a tin of broad beans and followed the rest of the recipe. I think you can do a lot of interesting things with this recipe and I like the suggestion of adding pancetta. Next time I may add some slivers of sundried tomatoes as it would provide a nice balance to the richness of the beans.

Easy and pointless.

I thought this recipie was a waste of both fresh favas and fresh basil. It tasted like pesto from a jar. Why cover up yummy basil and favas with too much garlic? It would be much better just to stir the favas and sliced basil into the pasta after it was cooked or serve the beans on the side.

My sincere thanks to the cook from Washington DC for the tip about properly cooking fresh FAVA beans. I never knew what the fuss over FAVA beans was until I had them in Italy. Now, I just blanch them in boiling water and peel before hand. When I am ready to serve i just sautee them briefly w/ a little EVO and a touch of salt.

This was easy, somewhat quick (if you dont count the fava shelling...) and delectable! Used fresh, organic favas from the garden. yum! good way to use favas.

Please, don't cook the fava beans any longer despite the opinion registered below. I just bought fava beans for the first time in the farmer's market this weekend & now count myself a real convert. After reading through numerous recipes, I chose to peel the beans first, blanch them (2 minutes) and plunge them into cold water until I finished the rest of my prep. Magnificent! Buttery, silky... Try this recipe using a generous amount of diced sauteed pancetta which other recipes demonstrate is a traditional complement to the seasonal beans.

3-5 minutes was not long enough to cook the favas, and they turned out too crunchy. Leftovers were better when microwaved the next day. If I make this again I will cook the beans longer. I don't know what the fuss about fava beans is; they were less tasty than plain lima beans.

This was the best pasta I have ever made. Unbelievably easy and sooo good. Like another reviewer, I sauteed pancetta, drained it, and then added it at the end. Wow!

I had a dinner party and made this dish a year ago for a tough crowd (food snobs, a world-traveled sommelier) to rave reviews. The sommelier said it was the best thing he'd ever put in his mouth. No substitutions were made - I used fresh Favas, garlic and stuck with the Romano cheese. This year I made it again (Favas are in season) and substituted good Parmesan, but frankly I didn't think it was quite as good as the original recipe w/Romano. A spring classic!

This was a quick and easy meal to make that the whole family enjoyed - our 2yr old said it was hhmm yummy. We were out of romano so we used a really nice parmesan, less basil (but fresh from our garden) and fresh noodles. Also blended the first cup of bean mixture to almost a paste and felt it held together nicely that way. My husband thought the garlic should be cooked instead.

I love fava beans and I loved this dish, although my husband wasn't quite as enthusiastic (I think he thought it was too "grassy"). I served it as a vegetarian main course with a tomato salad. I will definitely make it again (no matter what my husband says :)

this is fantastic! the romano overpowers the dish and doesn't add anything; i prefer it without. (i'm a cheese freak, too!) i processed one cup of the beans thoroughly (i used shelled edamame for convenience) first, then added another cup and pulsed it just to chop, then added the third cup whole. i loved that variety in texture that way. what are people serving this with?

This really is a light, summery pasta. I used fresh fava beans, basil, and really good pecorino. The flavors were terrific. I agree with the reviewer that said don't over do it on the garlic. I might also cut down on the basil next time a bit. I would like to have been able to taste the beans a touch more. An easy vegetarian dish and a nice twist on pesto. A little crushed red pepper could give it some kick and color to boot.

Really good and pretty "quick and easy." I also used edamame beans (soy beans) instead of fava beans - just couldn't find any fava beans and I hate lima beans. Reheats pretty well, but the basil starts to darken and doesn't look as pretty.

My first venture with fava beans was with this recipe last spring. Absolutely great with the shaved pecorino and a lot of pepper. I am making it for a dinner party tomorrow night as a first course. Yum!

During dinner last night, I couldn't stop exclaiming about how wonderful this pasta is. The flavors are fresh and bright, and preparation is a breeze. I didn't have enough fava beans, so I supplemented with edamame (fresh soy beans), which worked out beautifully. Be careful not to overdo it with the garlic, though... it doesn't get cooked, so two cloves are plenty.

My wife and I loved this recipe. I decided to add approx. 1/3 lb. of diced, crisped pancetta (oil discarded) and the dish stands up well as a main course.

I used the sauce to top bread for crostini. It was very tasty, though I used fewer fava beans and more garlic, which was more to my liking. Very good appetizer.

Delicious + healthy. The nice bright green color makes it very appealing to the eyes. The second time I made it I added some fresh ricotta cheese for fun. It was great too, and creamier.
