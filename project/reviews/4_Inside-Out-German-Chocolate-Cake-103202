Great cake! Made it for my son's birthday. Used less sugar for mix. I toasted pecans and coconut while SCM was boiling in pot for 2 hours. Cleaned bowls, etc. in between so clean up was not overwhelming and my kitchen was tidy throughout preparation. I used only 2 sticks of butter for glaze and was perfect. This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.

This was a lot of work, but worth every bit of time and effort. I've made it for 2 dinner parties. Everyone loved it. I enjoyed reading the previous reviewers' tips. The only one that didn't do well for me is heating the milk in the can on the stove. Maybe I didn't do it right. This is the recipe to make if you want to wow your dinner guests!

Outstanding! I never liked German Chocolate cake, but this is sinfully delicious!

This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe now, though often it just gets frosted with buttercream for an easier cake. Made cake pops based on this recipe that were great, too...baked the cake and crumbed it with the coconut filling to make balls- you get a feel for the right ratio as you make the balls. Then I rolled them in chocolate ganache as the outside coating. Just something different to try, and they last well in the freezer.

I submitted the prior review and just made the cake again this weekend. I made a single recipe of the cake and it was perfect for a 9x13 cake. I doubled the caramel and coconut; I omitted the nuts due to an allergy. Once the cake was cooled I spread the coconut mixture all over, like a frosting. It was outstanding. I will use the cake recipe for all my chocolate cakes, it is one of the best I have ever had.

This cake was fabulous! I did not change a single ingredient in the cake, but I did double the cake batter and the filling. I ended up with a gorgeous 4 layer cake. For the glaze, I used my favorite ganache, which is just cream and chocolate combined. I gave a huge portion of the cake to my neighbor, who later commented that living next to me is like living next to Satan. It was a compliment, in this case. I will making this cake again this weekend. Because I have very limited time, I will be making it as a 9x13 and using the filling as the frosting, no glaze.

I followed suggestions from other reviewers. I doubled the cake and filling and used 4 9" cake pans. This cake was amazing. It was almost 6" tall. I also boiled the sweetened condensed milk for 3 hours and let cool, turned out just like caramel. I made the caramel and the cakes a day ahead and wrapped the cakes in plastic wrap then refrigerated. The only thing I would do different would be to refrigerate 1 1/2 cups (rather than 1 cup) of the glazed to frost the cake. Otherwise there is plenty of glaze for this entire cake. Everyone loved it.

This cake was very well received at a Sunday luncheon with friends. The cake was wonderful although I did cut the sugar by 1/3. As others suggested, I doubled the cake batter and filling. The cake was super moist, especially after sitting overnight in the fridge. Next time I might consider decreasing the amount of coconut in the filling to achieve a smoother texture. Overall this cake was amahhhhhhhhhzing!! Will definitely make again.

DEE-LICIOUS!! Special B-Day cake. Just made this cake but made some changes: cheated & used a cake mix. I live at above 5000ft and cakes are too easy to mess up from scratch (for me) hence the cake mix. Found a product that is already Ducle de Leche made by Nestle. Called La Lechera by Nestle. Found in baking section of grocery store, much easier than 'baking the SCM". Toasted coconut and pecans over the stove mixed the La Lechera in the pan and the heat softened the contents nicely. Made the cake the night before, wrapped in waxed paper and put in freezer. Took cake out of freezer and let sit for 5-7 mins then halved the cake, easy to slice when slightly frozen. BTW I made small 6" rounds. Used serrated knife. As always be careful when slicing something slightly frozen. Yeah, not totally from scratch but results were wonderful. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Rating: 4
AWESOME! I love this recipe. It was not as difficult as it may seem. Like others I boiled the SCM for 2.5 hours on my stove rather than the oven idea in the recipe. Also, I would put almost 2 cups of the glaze in the fridge to cool for frosting. I found once I used the 1 cup of glaze to frost the cake I was short some and could not make it that smooth. Then, when I used the remaining warmed to pour over frosted cake I had almost 1 cup wasted that ran off the sides. Hope this makes sense. No matter, just make it!!!!

I could NOT believe it, he wanted a german chocolate cake with chocolate frosting! A little fussy to find dutch process cocoa here, and I just gacked at 2 1/2 sticks of butter for the frosting (somehow only 2 seemed better). I boiled the can of milk under water for 1 1/2 hrs, worked swell. This recipe is SO SO worth all the trouble, splendid birthday cake!

This cake is phenomenal. I have made this a dozen times and the only change that I make is to sub Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Chips for the semisweet chocolate in the glaze - the cake and the filling are sweet enough to balance the bittersweet glaze. So worth the effort!

This was my first time making German chocolate cake entirely from scratch, and I loved this recipe! Though it is a time consuming project, it was well worth it in the end. The only change I have to make is the amount of time the frosting should be chilled-it does not need to chill for a full hour, and it was thick enough after only 20-25 minutes in the fridge.

Very time consuming, but a labor of love. German Chocolate Cake is my husband's favorite so I surprised him with this one. Very decadent and rich. We loved the crunch in the cake. I also doubled the cake and filling recipe per earlier suggestions and put it in two 9 inch pans.

Excellent coconut pecan frosting. Put closed can of sweetened condensed milk in small pot, cover with water, boil for 2 hours. Perfect milk carmel. Will make again. Worth it.

This cake is delicious! I followed the advice of several reviewers and did the following: 1) doubled cake batter and baked in two 9" pans, then halved the cakes to make 4 layers; 2) doubled the filling; and 3) did not double the glaze, there was plenty. It made a giant cake. The main problem I had was that, possibly because of being at 5,000', the sweetened condensed milk boiled over in the oven and made a horrible mess. And that happened at 350, before it even got up to the 425 called for in the recipe. I went out and got more cans of SCM, but the second time I put the unopened cans in the pressure cooker, covered with water, and cooked for 30 min and it came out PERFECT. If I had just done that to begin with it would have saved a lot of time.

I made this yesterday. After reading many reviews, I used 2 cans of milk, since I had to open a 2nd one anyway to make 14 ounces. I upped the amounts of coconut and pecans accordingly. Although I love the filling, I thought that was a bit much. I made 3 eight inch pans but only baked for 18 minutes. I cooked the milk in the microwave until it seemed a good colour, and that only took about 30 minutes. The only other change I made was to reserve most of the glaze as frosting. This cake was delicious and worth the work, which wasn't as much as others made it out to be.

I'm making this tomorrow for a special birthday, and as I read over the recipe, I realized that I could add a suggestion that might help. You can either boil sweetened condensed milk, unopened, in the can covered with water for three hours or pressure cook it, in the can, for an hour. You can do several at a time and keep them on hand.

I made this to the T but found it toooooo sweet for my liking. I'd still make this again but will have to tweak it a bit. I love the coconut flavour, the pecans, the milk and chocolate... just have to find a way to tone down the sweetness I'm sure I can find a way to marry the flavours right...

I have reviewed this before but continue to make it for Christmas because everyone loves it so. You know a cake is good when everyone wants a slice to go! I set the cake on the serving dish and then line the edges under the cake with waxed paper. Avoids transferring the cake. Also, keep the filling a bit warm (nuke it for a tiny bit if you need to) and then it is easier to spread. Alot of time but well worth it.

OH MY GOODNESS. SO GOOD. I have to agree with the earlier review saying to not make this cake for just anyone because a) it takes quite a bit of time/effort and b) it's amazingly good and sharing just didn't seem like a good idea. I had trouble with the cake layers being too thin, but I'm going to use a smaller cake pan next time to bulk it up more. I definitely had left over filling so I'll probably make more layers next time.

Wow. Wonderful cake! Made this for my boyfriend's birthday. Might I suggest a few tips, also based on some other reviews.1) I used 2 8" cake pans from Ace Mart Restaurant Suppy and then split them with a cake wire. 2) I added instant Italian Espresso powder to the boiling water before I added it to the batter ( 1heaping tsp.) 3) This cake takes time, to help I boiled the cans of sweetened condensed milk in a pot of water for about 90 minutes 4) I doubled the filling since I made it with four layers. I used both toasted and regular sweetened coconut for texture. I have used sauerkraut instead of coconut in a GCC recipe before, it is a method used in the Great Depression when coconut wasn't available. Just rinse well and use just like you would coconut! 5) The ganache is messy! BUT totally worth it!!! Easiest way? Use that cardboard circle to build the cake, then place on a wire rack over a baking sheet or large platter to catch run off. 6) Lastly, I suggest making one day in advance to allow for ample set up of the layers and ganache, this cake is rather difficult to cut and serve otherwise. By far my favorite GCC recipe, it looks very professional and impressive, this one goes to the top of my cake list, a close second being my mom's Black Forest Cake which takes three days of prep...

I'm a huge fan, I made this cake for my cousin's wedding cake and it was amazing! It got rave reviews from everyone at the reception and they were shocked that it was the first cake I had ever made... Because it was a wedding cake, I ended up making the recipe 4 times over (and it took forever) but each time it worked like a charm. ---Only alteration (against my will) I had to use off white butter cream icing because she wanted that color. Will definitely make this again - WITH the proper glaze! If I could submit a photo I would!

I really don't think you can go wrong with this cake unless you're serving it to a bunch of coconut haters or calorie counters. It is always a hit. I've made it a number of times. It takes a couple hours so I don't make it for anyone, just the people that are important.

German chocolate cake is my absolute favorite, something my family makes from scratch for every birthday and holiday. I was excitec to try something new, but this didn't quite work for me for a few reasons. One: the best part of german chocolate is the coconut frosting. That's why there are so many layers and space on the top and sides. It was too chocolatey without enough of the frosting. Two: the coconut frosting had an odd flavor using the condensed milk. It was a little too deep of a caramel flavoring, instead of the frosting I'm used to. (did i burn it a little?) Three: My cake cracked and using a smooth ganache didn't help with the appearance of mine... plus corn syrup...yick I'm glad someone liked it, but traditional german chocolate is sooooo much better

When I first made this cake, I was certain the 9in cake layers had come out too thinly. Once I put the whole thing together, though, the layer sizes were the perfect match to the amount of filling. Even so, I might try 8in next time just to see how it turns out. Also, I took out the pecans and used extra coconut. Delish! The chocolate glaze made a mess, just a heads up, but who doesn't enjoy licking chocolate off the counter? :D

I used 8" cake pans and the layers were perfect. I whipped the cold glaze until it was fluffy and frosted the cake with that, cooled it and then poured on the glaze. I agree it needs more filling, and next time I might use half toasted coconut and half untoasted. I used regular Hershey's cocoa by the way. Everyone raved about it. Lot of steps but they were all easy.

Since I first saw this recipe in the March 2000 edition of the magazine, this has been my go-to chocolate cake recipe. I usually just divide the batter in half and make 2 layers. The cake is very light - it is important to use whole milk in the batter. Without whole milk the cake is simply too light and crumbles as it comes out of the cake pans. While the complete recipe: filling, ganache and glaze, is amazing. I sometimes just use home made chocolate or vanilla frosting to make something a little more simple. Make this!

Doesn't make sense to rate a recipe before tasting.However, I made this for my husbands birthday party tonight, and I can not wait to dig into it. It was time consuming, but I tasted as I made it, and it is going to be something very very special. It is a giant ding dong of a cake, and parked in my fridge just haunting me. I know this will be a regular in our home for birthdays and holidays. Definitely watch the toasting of the nuts, as I burned my when I followed the instructions. Had to go get more. I boiled my cans of milk in water for 90 minutes, and it turned out perfect. Be sure to let the cans cool first before you attempt to open. Mine shot the milk across the room and I had a sticky cleanup. All in all pretty easy cake to make just time consuming.

First of all I have to say that I love this just as a chocolate cake and would use the recipe again. Here are the changes I made. I doubled the cake and filling recipe and then baked the cake in 4-8" rounds so I got 4 thin layers. With the doubled filling I had enough to fill all the layers plus I topped the last layer with the leftover. For the frosting I melted the butter with the chocolate and the corn syrup but after it cooled I made some cream cheese frosting and then beat the chocolate into it until light and fluffy-yum! Like I said I liked the cake and would use it again and I will again double the reciped but next time I would bake the batter in 2-8" rounds instead. I would also make my frosting variation but would not make the filling again. I love cocounut and pecans and I like the carmely taste but I just didn't love it.

The flavors were amazing, but the texture was off for me -- too ooey, gooey. BUT I live at altitude and have not yet gotten the knack of baking at it. So my layers came out of the oven needing all 25 minutes -- and the edges were puffy but the middles all looked deflated. So, if you live in the mountains, I'd suggest figuring out some recipe accommodations to make before attempting.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was exceptional. I am using this recipe again today - though I will use pecans and coconut to garnish the top. WOW! What a treat.

This is a delicious cake!! I didn't have dutch processed cocoa, I used Ghirardelli cocoa powder and extra baking soda, and the cake turned out beautifully! I didn't double the cake recipe as some had suggested and made it with 8' cake pans instead, it came out beautifully! The filling was amazing and for the glaze I used Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips it was sinful! I think the chocolate cake recipe will be my go-to recipe from now on. I'm going to try to stop in this bakery the next time I'm in the Waitsfield Area.

I made this cake for Christmas. I doubled the cake and filling portions as per previous comments, and it was just fine. I think using a single cake portion of the recipe would have yielded layers that were too thin for my taste. I wonder if using a single recipe in an 8" or 7" cake pan would work as well? I will have to experiment next time. I boiled the condensed milk, as opposed to the water bath, and that worked great.The flavor was delicious, and my family raved out this cake, insisting that it become "a keeper". I tried to transfer the cake after assembling/icing but before chilling, and had a minor problem where the cake started to break apart. Chill first, then transfer, and you'll have no problem. I splurged and used Valrhona Cocoa Powder and Callebaut blocks for my chocolates of choice, and I think it was worth the extra money for the Holiday time.

I made this for Christmas, I didn't read any of the reviews first, so I had to find my own way around this recipe. The cakes were easy to make. I added a 1/2 tsp of almond extract, and the extra almond flavor was yummy. I made the dulce de leche in the pie plate like it said. I think there might be a "stirring" step in between the two 45 minute segments, but they forgot to write it down. My milk was perfect on the edges near the water bath, but nearly burnt in the center of the pie plate and the resulting filling when the nuts and coconut was added was much too thick to even spread. I was actually able to save it by thinning it with vanilla caramel flavored coffee creamer. I don't know why I thought to use it, but it came out delicious. I added about a tablespoon of coffee crystals to the chocolate ganache glaze -- a trick I picked up from Ina Garten. I did not need all of the glaze for the cake, only about half of it. I saved the rest and used it as a liquid fudge sauce for the cake slices which made this rich cake even more decadent. Overall, it was a major hit at my house, and made a great breakfast treat the next day with strong coffee. I know this cake is going to be requested again in the future.

This is an AMAZING cake. I made it 4 days ahead of time. After it cooled, put a piece of parchment on the top of it and then plastic wrap, then foil then froze it. ( I have NEVER frozen a cake in my whole life)! Drove it 300 miles. It defrosed on the way. We went to dinner for boyfriend's bday, they took the cake in the back, put some candles on it and it was the most BEAUTIFUL cake. Perfect. Another thing was to put the coconut/walnut filling on the top of the cake, and I put the chocolate on the side of the cake. It was tremendous!!!! 5 forks.

Oh my, this is one of the most decadent desserts I have had the pleasure of making. I substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup, and milk chocolate for the semi-sweet. I doubled both the cake and the filling and both came out beautifully. I cooked the milk in the can submerged in water. Used a deep pasta pot and kept it full. Boiled for 3.5 hours and the caramel came out beautifully, almost flan like. This will be a winner...letting it chill overnight before transporting to a birthday party a few hours away. Wasn't too much overtime. I put the milk onto boil and went out to lunch!

I have a cake company and I make this cake as my signature German Chocolate cake recipe. I make a few changes to the recipe. I use melted chocolate and add the boiling water to it and mix it into the batter. I also make a milk chocolate glaze instead of dark chocolate. The cake is very light to work with because I only cook it 18 minutes so I have to chill the cake before layering it and I chill the cake before glazing it. The recipe is not difficult to make nor is it that time consuming if you utilize time well.

I made this last night and doubled everything per many of the reviewers suggestions. That being said, it was the final step that got me: "Chill cake and transfer to a plate." This was easier said than done with a 20 lb ganache covered giant Ding-Dong of a cake sitting on a rack! However, victory was mine and the cake was plated. Making this cake was EASY--a little time consuming, but nothing about it was hard or tricky. Much easier than other German Chocolate type cakes and this one looks sophisticated enough to make ME look good! The taste is also fabulous!

I am unable to comment on the finished product at this time but do have some notes on the baking process as a whole. I followed other reviewer's advice and boiled the cans of sweetened condensed milk for an hour and a half, checking every 15 minutes to make sure there was enough water to cover the cans, and I must say that the dulce de leche came out perfectly. I did not use a dutch oven but just a large pot, I must confess that I was obviously very nervous about the can exploding and that is why I checked it that often, but I would recommend this method, it was fast and I was able to do other prep work while I waited. I did double the filling and the cake recipe because I wanted thick layers. I cooked the layers while the sweetened condensed milk was boiling and once they were room temperture put them in the fridge for about twenty minutes in order to make spreading the filling easier. I also just cooked the layers for about 18 minutes max and they all came out moist, not dry. I did not want to make the buttery glaze and instead opted for a ganache frosting/icing per other reviewers suggestions. Unfortunately, I will have to curb my cravings til our dinner party gets under way but I will make sure to add my review of the overall taste, in regards to other reviews of the cake being too sweet.

Like others, I made this recipe for my husband's birthday--he loves German Chocolate cake, and at first (hearing my daughter and I'd worked on the recipe on and off all day!) he was inclined to say it wasn't worth it. Then he tasted it. Best ever, he says. The cakes were almost impossible to work with, they were so thin, and the filling was hard to work with even warm. But the outcome--wow! Very yummy. Definitely making this one again, but possibly not until his next birthday!

Wonderful cake with adjustments. Previous reviews are worth reading. 14 mins is plenty (too long?) for the cake, doubling filling is smart, using glaze as frosting is easier. Next time I might put some of the filling on top, and I might try doubling the cake recipe but sticking with 3 pans, as they are the thinnest layers I've ever seen.

This cake was delicious! I made it for a friend's birthday. Per others' recommendations, I made double the filling and it was way too much...1 and a third would have been plenty. A stick less butter in the icing worked out well. I also recommend stirring the SC milk midway because it gets darker at the edges.

Rating: 3
A really terrific cake. But I give it 3 forks because there is just not enough "cake" in this cake. Most cake recipes use up to 3 cups of flour; this one calls for half that. Next time, I will double the batter for the layers so that the cake is more substantial. I made two instead of three layers since so many users recommended doubling the coconut-pecan-dulce filling -- happily, this resulted in a nice thick yummy ribbon of filling. Since others had reported this recipe is very sweet, I reduced the sugar in the cake batter and also used unsweetened coconut flakes. The dulce and glaze are very sweet so it was better, I think, with less sugar overall. It took me 2-1/2 hours (and I'm a novice baker), mainly because I used a can of dulce stored in my pantry, which I made using the boil-in-the-oven method. (Although some users report exploding cans while doing this, I think this is rare, and if you boil the cans in the oven using a covered Dutch Oven, if for some reason they do burst it will be inside the oven rather than on the stovetop.) I began by toasting the coconut and pecans while making the batter. While the cake baked, I made the glaze. While the cake cooled, I transferred the dulce from the can to a microwave-safe container, heated it until it was stir-able, and then combined with the toasted coconut and pecans. If the filling is warm, it is much easier to spread on the the cake. I chilled the "glaze" in its entirety and spread it like frosting/ganache, which worked well; I also made less than the recipe called for (1-1/2 sticks butter + 7 oz chocolate + 2 tbs agave syrup) and it was more than enough. Again: this is a great recipe, but definitely consider increasing the cake batter and consult the user reviews for tips on how to make the cake less time-consuming and sweet.

I am so frustrated after spending so much time and money in preparing for this cake. The layers came out ridiculously flat. It can't be because of the baking soda or poweder since neither is old, and I used a thermometer in the oven to make certain of the temp. I'm puzzled but even more disappointed. Any suggestions? Most everyone else seems to be having great success. I do a lot of baking and this is a first.

VERY Yummy!!! I made it for my husband's birthday because he loves German Chocolate Cake. I think the order in which you do things makes all the difference in terms of time. It only took me 2 hours to make this from start to finish! First, I did the boil the can technique as others suggested to make the dulce de leche (I doubled the recipe for the filling). I boiled the cans for 90 minutes and they came out perfectly! I made sure to keep the cans submerged in the water the entire time by having an extra pan of boiling water on the stove which I took from. While the cans were boiling, I toasted the coconut & pecans in the oven (watching the coconut carefully so it doesn't burn!). While those were in the works, I made the cake batter and baked it barely 20 minutes in 3 pans. Perhaps this is why other reviewers found the cake too dry is because it doesn't require the full 20 to 24 minutes to bake. After the milk was done, I made the filling and spread it. Took the glaze that I had set aside out of the fridge and put it on the top and sides. Next time I will set aside more than just the 1 cup that the recipe calls for as I didn't have enough to go around the sides of the cake. Lastly, I drizzled the glaze over the top and topped with strawberries. It was delicious and I had so much fun making it! The clean up wasn't nearly as daunting as I was afraid it would be from reading other reviews, although I cleaned as I went so it made it easier! I am going to make this again next month for a work luncheon and possibly try a milk chocolate ganache this time!

Great recipe. A little on the sweet side. There are a lot of steps, and though they are not complex, it does take a lot of time. For things to flow nicely, and have things spread while warm, you need to allow for an afternoon in the kitchen. The cake part of this recipe only took 14 minutes, and not the 20 to 25 the recipe suggests. I tested it after 12 minutes. It is a show stopper in the looks department. I decorated the top with chocolate leaves and a tiny bit of coconut.

Wow! This was great! It didn't take as long as indicated. I had everything out the morning I was going to do this. I cooked the coconut, pecans and milk (on the stove) first. While those were cooking I made the cake. When the milk was done, I made the filling and spread it while it was still warm; it was just enough and spread easily. I did change the glaze; I halved the butter and used about 8 oz. chocolate. It was plenty! I covered the top but just let it drizzle down the sides. I did it all while it was warm, did not chill any of it. I didn't even use all of it, and it was plenty. I also sprinkled some extra toasted coconut around the edges (it was a birthday cake) and the effect was just what I wanted. Very rich, but very good!

Made this for hubby's birthday and it was a hit. I made the filling the night before but then had trouble spreading it the next day because it was too hard. There were too many 'airgaps' because it didn't compress nicely in between the cake layers. Next time I will make the filling the same day and keep it warm so that it spreads. Also the cake cooking time was too long, the cake was a little dry. What I loved the most was the crunchiness of the filling, and it slightly resembled heath bar crunch. I also only used 1.5 sticks of butter and 7 oz of dark chocolate for the topping, and chilled it and applied it like a frosting. It worked great!

If you start boiling before you start the cakes, it makes your timeline flow better. Those were the only changes i made, and it was AMAZING!!!! Always a hit when i make this cake :)

This was a very good cake. I added 3 or 4 tbsp milk to the filling after it was mixed based on the comments below. I think this helped a little as far as spreading goes. Next time I make this I am going to reduce the amount of butter in the glaze by a quarter or so. Overall, everyone loved it--even the neighbor came over for seconds the next day!

I give this 4 forks BUT the consistency of the filling was not very pliable for me... i assume i cooked the milk in milk bath too long... although followed the recipe. I would add more milk or shorten the time next time. BUT- the cake- outstanding. My wife's birthday request and she loved the 'crunchiness' of the filling which wasn't expected!!!

awesome! i got a little creative and changed the chocolate "frosting" to a chocolate ganache and sprinkled very lightly fleur de sal on top ....... yum! also i added a bit of cream to the condensed milk mixture after it was all mixed together to loosen it up a bit. i may have over cooked the condensed milk a bit.

"Wow" was all I heard from cake- stuffed mouths! Made this for my future son-in-law's birthday today and he offered to "sell body parts" in trade for another slice! He and my daughter even thought this could be a great wedding cake for them. Everyone was even trying to calculate how much I could sell one for! As to the milk-prep debate in so many other reviews, don't drive yourselves nuts...just allow enough time and follow the recipe exactly and you won't be at all disappointed. The whole cake prep was remarkably easy but, yes..it was ridiculously messy! If you can clean up in between tasks and stay super organized, it's not so bad. Despite the time and lethal amounts of stray chocolate in my kitchen, I fully intend to make this again...why would I pass up so many compliments??

This cake tasted very good, and is much prettier than a regular german chocolate cake. 2 things I would change. One cup of chilled frosting is not enough, so chill a little more. The filling was very thick and dry. Cook some additional condensed milk, or add some after cooking to make it spreadable.

Yum! I made this for a friend's birthday, and the crowd was pleased! Prep takes quite a while, but worth the effort for a special occasion. I used Ghirardelli chocolate in the glaze, and several folks unable to keep themselves from "testing" it again. This is a real plate-licker.

Excellent. Several steps but none too complex. Very rich. Used a large shred coconut. Only drawback was that it does not hold up well for Texas backyard barbecue in July. Melts quickly. Will make often and serve indoors.

This cake is amazing! Made it for Father's Day and everyone raved. One suggestion: Refrigerating one cup of the glaze wasn't nearly enough to frost the entire cake. I would go with at least 1 1/2 cups, if not more.

Made this cake for my husband for Father's day yesterday. It is the best dessert I have ever tasted, ever. I used Valrhona semi-sweet chocolate. I will use this as my base chocolate cake for every dessert I make going forward. It was perfect--not too dry, not too moist.

I did not make the filling in this recipe, I used another from the America's Test Kitchen series. I didn't feel like having th oven on for so long since it's hot and humid here but I can imagine that the enclosed filling recipe would have been phenomenal. I have to say that the cake turned out really great, it would be the best chocolate cake recipe I've made, I would use it again to combine with other frostings. One note is that the batter IS very thin and be careful putting it into the over as I tipped it a bit and my cake rose lopsided. I also baked it in a 9x13 rectangle pan since I'm bringing it into the office. I toasted both the coconut and pecans for my filling as directed, for my recipe, I used 1C evaporated milk, 1C sugar, 3 egg yolks, 4T butter - cook all that whisking constantly until it boils and thickens a bit, then I add my toasted coconut and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla. Stir frequently while cooling slightly before wrapping in plastic and chilling for at least 2 hours. Fold in pecans before using this frosting. It works well with this cake. I think the recipe's filling would have produced a much richer filling than the one I used. All in all, the cake is easy to make and I'll definitely use it again! Of course this time being more ginger in the way I put it in the oven!!

I was a bit nervous about this recipe because it has lots of steps (and I am a novice baker), but none are complicated and it turns out a tasty, moist cake. I boiled the can of condensed milk on the stove for 1 hour - worked out perfectly. One reviewer said it was difficult to spread the filling. The key is to make sure you keep the filling warm. If so, it spreads like butter. Great cake! I'll definitely make it again.

Excellent cake but don't call it German Chocolate. Although has a traditional German Chocolate filling, the overall effect is that of a very rich truffle. Good cake for those occasions when you want a "wow" effect. The glaze is exactly that - shiny and very prety. It's good. And although a little fussy to make, it's easy.

This is a good cake and was much better the second day and when eaten cold. Cooked sweetened condensed milk in boiling water till carmel. Everything else went well and not that hard to make. I really liked it but thought it should just have ganache on top. Didn't like the chocolate butter top, better with cream. But.... all in all pretty darn tasty.

Wonderful cake. Way worth the effort.. But i found a shortcut:Do the nut/coconuts First, then do the condensed milk, then make your cake while thats in the oven. then do the topping. This saved me at least an hour overall.

Excellent cake, filling and icing! It came out looking exactly like the picture. The filling is thick, so it needs to be warm to make it easier to spread. The ganache is the perfect amount. It may seem like too much if it is applied to the cake when it is too thin. It is not a a quick recipe to make, but it is not difficult. It is definitely worth the extra effort!

Yum!. . .I've made this recipe several times. I am a usually messy cook, but this recipe is by far the messiest one I have done so far. I took the cakes out of the oven earlier than it says to because it was a bit dry before and it turned out moist and delicious. Everyone I have made it for love it!

I felt compelled to post as I am mystified by all the positive reviews of this recipe. I followed the recipe precisely and found the filling to be EXTREMELY thick and dry. "Spreading" the filling on the cake layers was not even possible, so I added a second can of dulce de leche (prepared from a can of sweetened condensed milk as directed in the recipe), and I still struggled with the first layer and then actually rolled out the second layer between two sheets of waxed paper for the second layer! The consistancy of the prepared filling is like a very thick sticky cookie dough. The cake and ganache looked and tasted great, but the filling, which I was excited about, do to the dulce de leche, was a HUGE disappointment, very hard and dry, not moist and gooey like the coconut topping on a traditional "right side-out" German Chocolate Cake. I am baffled as to why no one else has posted a similar complaint.

Rating: 4
Outstanding. Doubled the filling, using dulce de leche instead of baking condensed milk. Did not chill the glaze first. Just poured it over the top and let it drip onto the sides as opposed to covering the sides. Put all 3 pans in middle of oven rack to bake, as opposed to top third and bottom third. Came out magnificently. Thank you for this recipe.

As I was making this cake, with its absolutely lethal quantities of sugar in each of its components, I swore I'd never make it again. The filling, especially, seemed cloyingly sweet to me. However, it was a hit with everyone. The cake was moist and chocolatey and the filling somehow didn't seem as sweet when eaten as part of the whole. It wasn't as messy or difficult to make as some reviews seem to suggest. I baked the condensed milk in a disposable pie tin, it worked fine and no clean-up. I used 2/3 cup normal cocoa. Would I make it again? Perhaps, but it won't be on my go-to cake recipe list. Just waaay too much sugar, principally because of the filling.

WOW! I made it for Christmas and it was worth all of the time and patience (or lack thereof!). I did the evaporated milk in the pot as suggested by a previous poster Put unopened can in lecreuset and fill with water. Bring to boil and then reduce to simmer for 1 and 1/2 hours. Careful opening the can but it is perfect when it comes out). I will make it again and again. It was enjoyed by all ages.

This was a fantastic cake! I highly suggest placing it on a cake board or pan bottom, as it really helped with the transport and decoration of the cake. I used the baking milk method (as I didn't want to put myself in harms way due to an errant experiment) and it turned out fine. In fact, everyone who ate the cake especially noted the filling. I made the recipe exactly as is, except for reducing the butter in the frosting/glaze to 2 sticks and still found it a little greasy for my taste. I would definitely make it again!

I made this for my Mom's 77th birthday. My teenage nephews were bargaining for seconds, everyone loved it! the reviews make it sound much more difficult than I had found it to be.

I also added heavy cream to the glaze which I made with Nestle semi-sweet chips. This cake is a keeper!

Made this for my mother's 70th bday and she loved it. As far as timeconsuming..there are a few steps, but nothing overly challenging. The most challenging for me was trying to get the glaze on the side of the cake. I was attempting to get the beautiful smooth finish that you find on high end of cakes. Any advice? ALSO - I attempted to get my caramel by boiling my can of milk as suggested by another on this site. It didn't work...I simmered it for 3.5 hours without success.

Delicious. A LOT of work. If there is a next time, two things - I'll halve the glaze. It's just too much. Also the water bath dulce de leche was very risky/dangerous in a tiny NYC kitchen with little room to operate. Luckily I had used a Le Creuset dutch oven instead of the pie plate/foil and thus was able to safely lift the pot out of the water bath and let the water pan to cool in the oven for later removal. There has to be a better way to do that part. I'm never doing THAT again. Scary and not worth a trip to the hospital to make a cake :-)

Made this yesterday for a birthday dinner, and it is absolutely delicious. Very rich, and different from the usual German chocolate cake, in that the cake and glaze are semi sweet and dark. Takes time and effort, but the results are worth it!

Amazing! I absolutely agree with the last reviewer -- don't be intimidated by the process of making the dulce de leche in the oven as directed; it's really no big deal (although be careful when you take the foil off the pan -- it is HOT!). But next time I make this (and there will definitely be a next time), I think I may halve the amount of glaze -- it seemed a bit excessive.

I made this cake exactly as the recipe suggested - and found it outstanding - very intense with chocolate. As suggested by the name, not your typical german chocolate cake - so don't even expect that. No need whatsover to change a thing. I find it helpful to not change anything with most recipes on this site - unless there is something particularly noteworthy mentioned by another reviewer, as there a so many interpretations. Do the condensed milk as suggested - absolutely no reason to risk an explosion in your kitchen by boiling a sealed can of evaporated milk!

I loved this cake, although I would say it is not a traditional german chocolate cake. I thought the cake flavor was a much deeper chocolate than would be traditional and I was very pleasantly surprised at how delicious, full-flavored and moist it was. A lot has been made about it being time-consuming, messy and difficult, but I did not find it to be any of those things. It took me three and a half hours start to finish, but obviously a lot of that time was not actual working time. I did double the amount of filling, and I would do that again. I might have been more concerned about clean up if I did not have a dishwasher, but if you start with an empty one, it's not a big deal. My only issue with this cake was in trying to carmelize the sweetened condensed milk. A lot of the reviews seem to deal with this issue. I had no desire to risk my children or my kitchen to boiling an unopened can, nor did I want to do the oven method--water baths intimidate me. Therefore I followed the directions on the Eagle Brand website for carmelizing it in the microwave. I felt like the results were OK, but I probably cooked it a tad too long. Maybe when I make it again I will use the oven method. Also, this cake will be for extremely special occasions only, with doubling the filling and buying premium chocolate, I spent $40 to make this cake. It was worth it for my dad's birthday, but I won't be doing it for a weekend treat!

I made this last night as a special request from my son for his birthday cake. It is a labor intensive project, but one that is worth the effort. While it took quite some time to make, it came out spectacular. I only used two cake pans and put a large amount of filling inside and after the ganache topped the rest of the coconut/pecan filling in a ring atop of the cake. Looks beautiful! Also, I added a tsp of chocolate extract (purchase at the Spice House -- can order online) and also added a tbsp of vanillia and almond extract to cake and filling.

Wow! Made this for a german chocolate cake lover's birthday party. Everyone loved. A friend who went to culinary school in France told me it was the best cake she had ever had - not to mention, I caught her husband sneaking back in to the kitchen with his fork for more. Definitely a keeper.

Several months ago I made this beautiful cake for my honey's birthday, as German Chocolate is his favorite (right next to carrot cake). Even now, looking back I think: Drop dead DE-LISH! The directions are easy to follow and the cake's elegant glaze finish makes you feel like a professional. Without hesitation, I'd have to say the cake's most outstanding quality is its coconut FILLING. In another world with a faster metabolism, I would eat bowls of the stuff. MAKE THIS CAKE!

This cake was SO good! It was very rich so be sure to cut thin slices, but it was delicious! I did make a few changes based on everyone else's reviews and on what I had. I used 8 inch pans instead of 9 inch and cooked them for about 24 minutes and the cake came out moist and I had no problem with it turning to crumbs. Also, since I live at high altitude I added about a Tbsp. more of flour and my cakes rose beautifully. I also modified the frosting a lot just because I already have a good recipe for coconut pecan frosting that uses egg yolks and doesn't involve any caramelized condensed milk, but instead you just cook it over the stove for a little bit, add in the yolks, cook some more, and then add in the pecans and coconut. I doubled the frosting like everyone told me, but it was not needed as I have so much left over I am going to have to make another cake just to use it all. For the ganache I followed the suggestions by adding 1 cup cream to 1/2 cup butter. Overall, the cake was superb and I topped it with some daisies and it looked great and professional. My family loved it and I will definitely make again!

I was concerned about the time involved with this cake but using 2 ovens and simmering the condensed milk on the stove cut the time in half. I took this to a neighborhood party and it was a huge hit.

I thought the filling in this recipe was disgusting. Find one with egg yolks and butter and evaporated milk. Whatever you do, don't use the sweetened stuff. Its aftertaste is awful. As for the cake, it was merely O.K. There are much better chocolate cake recipes on Epicurious.com. The Chocolate Stout Cake, for example. The glaze is good, and I will use it again.

I have been baking this cake ever since it was first printed in Gourmet Magazine. It's my favorite special occation cake, which never fails to rock the party. I do have one trick to make things easier. I do the sweetened condensed milk on the stove. I place the unopened can in Le Cruset covered in water, with the lid on. When the water reaches a boil I turn it down to low, and contine the cooking time for an hour & half total. Perfectly carmelized sweetened condensed milk with this stratigy. Much easier, less clean up.

Every now and then you find a recipe that's an instant favorite. This is one of those recipes. Don't be put off by the reviewers who say it's so much work... it's really not if you're used to baking from scratch. It takes a lot of time, but not a lot of labor. Why boil the can of condensed milk anyway? Baking the milk in a water bath was so easy! The filling was chewy, the cake moist and really chocolaty, and the ganache was every bit delicious. I made a little extra toasted coconut and some whole toasted pecans for garnish, and went with 1 tsp. of baking powder (just because it was easier!) Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. There was no need to change anything. I'm a tough critic, and I tell you this cake is absolutely fantastic.

This cake is so good, and I'm only giving it 3 forks because cleanup is a monster. I'm not much of a baker, and by the time I was done it seemed like there was chocolate and pecan filling all over everything! I used the shortcut of boiling the can of condensed milk, but be careful as the cans can actually explode if you heat them, although this rarely happens (there's a warning on the can not to heat unopened cans for this reason). You should let them cool before you open them, and even then put a towel over it when you do in case hot milk squirts out. Per other's recommendations I doubled the filling recipe and had some leftover. I made little "cookies" by dropping little blobs onto wax paper, drizzled them with the leftover glaze and popped them in the fridge. A little sweet, but so good!

This has become my go to recipe when I need a great cake for an office function. I like a tallereven more decadentcake, so I make one and one half the recipe amount for the cake layers so each layer is a little thicker. Then Ill make double the recipe for the filling, saving enough to spoon on top of the glaze at the very end. Incredible! I definitely use the boil the can in water method but use caution when opening the can as the hot, caramelized milk has a tendency to erupt out when you make the first cut/opening into the can. A definite crowd pleaser!

I made this filling for a wedding cake last weekend and it was fantastic. I don't care much for sweetened coconut so I subsituted a natural unsweetened kind. I also used walnuts instead of pecans.As someone stated in another review you can easily make the dulce de leche by boiling unopened cans of sweetened condensed milk for about 2 hours. Just cook on med/high heat and keep them covered in water the whole time.

This is wonderful. It's time-consuming to make, but not at all difficult. I skipped the cooking-the-milk step, and just subbed a 15-oz. jar of dulce de leche, which worked beautifully. I would recommend warming the dulce de leche, though, before mixing it with the toasted coconut, toasted pecans, and vanilla, to help make the filling easier to spread. I decorated my finished cake with toasted pecan halves and a little toasted coconut. Beautiful and amazing. Makes a superb birthday cake for a German chocolate-loving person.

Made 2 thicker layers rather than 3 due to lack of third cake pan. Layers weren't too thick. Baked a few minutes longer to compensate. Used all of the filling between the two layers.

There is a slightly easier way to carmelize the condensed milk. Just boil the unopened can (remove label) for two hours, making sure the can is completely covered in water the entire time. This way you can be baking the cake and toasting the nuts and coconut while the making the milk. Wait about 5-10 minutes after taking out of the water, then make a small opening with a can opener. A small amount of hot milk may come out, but not very much.

This is BY FAR the most amazing version of German Chocolate cake I have ever eaten! It was very easy to make...and I am so not a baker. Its better the 2nd day and make sure you bring it to room temp.

Delicious, even though it was time-consuming and I made some mistakes! The cake was perfectly moist and chocolately; for added moisture, I soaked the cooked cakes in a touch of Amaretto while preparing the filling. I think I didn't caramelize the milk long enough; it was difficult for me to tell when it was done, and I realized as I was preparing the filling that it wasn't really caramelized enough; tasted a bit like sweetened milk! Fortunately, I had some bottled Dulce de Leche lying around, so subbed with most of that and it was much better; I might actually make it with the bottled DdL next time. The filling was spectacular! I used the filling on the inside and the outside and just drizzled a bit of semisweet chocolate on top. Wonderful cake if you have the time.

I did the slow cook method of the condensed milk and loved the flavor with the roasted pecans.Next time I will just make this cake the right side out

Fantastic is right. Forgiving, too: in an effort to save time, I followed the New Zealand cook's example of starting the condensed milk while mixing the cake batter... thought it would be okay to leave it in when the cake pans went in, then realized the cakes were baking unevenly amidst the waterbath steam. Whoops! Fortunately, I made the thing well in advance of serving, and after cake/filling/glaze equilibrated for 48 hours, all turned out perfect. Moist cake, gooey filling (add a pinch of salt for balance), decadent frosting. Do save a little coconut and a few pecans to decorate the top -- not so inside-out, but prettier than the picture!

This cake is unbelievable! I have made it twice in the last month for birthdays and Octoberfests (even if German chocolate cake isn't really German in origin). Rave reviews from coworkers, family, and friends. Go ahead and do the second can of Eagle Brand milk. It makes for a really great filling, not too dry, way too delicious. The second time I made this cake, I accidentally used a full cup of boiling water. Surpisingly, the layers were much higher and fluffier. Try this cake. It's a real show stopper.

Absolutely delicious and looks great. I used a bt more condensed milk than the recipe called for and I think it was needed, I also only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter (6oz) for the icing and added 4oz of cream and it was fantastic. Didn't take me much longer than 2 hours because I started boiling the milk same time as I made batter and I made icing while cake baked. So when the cake finished cooking I toasted the nuts and coconut straight away and when the milk was finshed boiling, the cake was cooked and cooled, the nuts toasted and the ganache was ready so all I had to do was assemble. Fantastic cake!

Unfortunately, although the flavor on this recipe is great, the texture is completely unworkable. The filling is too dry and doesn't adhere to the cake - at all - and the cake itself also crumbles to nothing when you try to cut it. I did the knife dipped in hot water thing, everything I could think of. Nothing worked. I ended up with a big pile of very tasty crumbs. I ended up putting little handfuls of the "cake" into cupcake liners and calling it "German Chocolate Cake Trifle." Great taste, terrible presentation.

I am an 11 year old girl who loves to bake. This was the first cake I've ever made from scratch and I made it for my mom and grandma's birthday. It was AMAZING! My family loved it and gave it nothing but compliments. I used two 8" round cake pans and the cook time was 10 minutes longer. I also accidently put a tablespoon vanilla in the glaze, which by the way made it SO good.

I am an 11 year old girl who loves to bake. This was the first cake I've ever made from scratch and I made it for my mom and grandma's birthday. It was AMAZING! My family loved it and gave it nothing but compliments. I used two 8" round cake pans and the cook time was 10 minutes longer. I also accidently put a tablespoon vanilla in the glaze, which I didn't refrigerate. Despite these changes and my inexperience, the cake was awesome and I am so grateful for this recipe being on epicurious because it made my family's day!

Use dulce de leche, available where Mexican products are sold, rather than sweetened condensed milk which requires boiling or baking. Warm the dulce de leche slightly and follow the recipe from there, stirring in coconut and pecans, and tasting before adding vanilla.

One of the best cakes I've ever made! I definitely used the "boil the unopened can" method for the condensed milk and had no explosions. It's important to continue adding boiling water to the pot as it evaporates so the cans stay COMPLETELY submerged. They boiled for about 1.5 hours and came out perfect. That being said, I doubled the filling, used bittersweet chocolate for the glaze, and did not reheat the glaze before spreading it. The dark chocolate balanced out the super-sweet filling perfectly. Added some fresh whipped cream to serve and it was wonderful!

This is as great as everyone says it is and really satisfies a sweet tooth. Plus it makes a great presentation. I thought it was a lot of work (I don't do many cakes), but you do get impressive results. My glaze was a bit runny when I poured it on top. If I make again, I'd be careful not to heat it much.

I made this cake for my boss' birthday party this morning, before work! It takes the full amount of time required even though I worked very fast. My cake layers were thin, too, but I think it is because the recipe doesn't call for much batter. It is fine the way it is because the cake and filling are very rich. Everyone loved it! *** BIG WORD OF CAUTION, though: I used the boil the can method for the condensed milk. Do this ONLY AT YOUR OWN PERIL. My cans exploded and it is just luck that the boiling milk splashed all over my stove top and walls and not on my face. I could have been seriously injured. I had planned on making a double recipe of the filling, so had two cans and was able to salvage enough from both cans to make one recipe of filling. I have to say that this method worked, and the filling was delicious. Fair warning that it is dangerous to boil unopened cans of anything!

so, it turns out that this new guy i'm dating has a birthday coming up, his favorite cake is german chocolate cake and his mother has been baking this cake almost every year for his birthday. i find this recipe, follow some of the reviewers' suggestions (boiling the condensed milk, using unsweetened coconut, doubling the filling recipe) and for the first time in my life, bake a cake. after the very first bite, my boyfriend looks over at me and says in a whisper (there were lots of people) "between you and me, this is better than my mom's. enough said.

A delicious and beautiful cake! I took the advice of the other reviewers and boiled the sweetened condensed milk. Be sure to let it cool as it will spray when it it opened still hot. I had a little trouble w/ the cake rising. I will be sure to use fresh baking powder next time. The cake still had height due to the filling. This will be made again and again.

I was unimpressed by the cake layers. They were VERY thin and didn't rise much at all. The batter is too thin. I also did not have a pan big enough to do the dulce de leche in a water bath. Who has a pan big enough to fit a large deep dish pie pan? Not me, though I am a personal chef. I wound up using already prepared dulce de leche after burining the condensed milk by trying the recipe version without the water bath.

This recipe was fantastic!!!! I noticed other reviewers say it takes a long time, but this is only because of the waiting for the cooking of the condensed milk . . . and if you plan it right, this is noooo problem!!! It was actually really easy and came out perfect and tasted great. In fact, the method for "cooking" the condensed milk is actually the method for making authentic dulce de leche (american grocery stores have a more caramelly version). My friends from argentina and colombia use this method all the time and it makes dulce de leche that tastes just like the stuff they bring back from "home"

I made this cake for an Octoberfest party. I made leaves out of white chocolate like another review suggested and also boiled the cans of condensed milk. I used a cup of cream and 1/2 cup of butter in the ganache and it turned out perfect. The filling is great, I doubled it and I might not add all the coconut next time because it was so thick it made the cake hard to cut. I made the cake in two 8 in. layers and then split them in two so I had a 4 layer cake. I brushed the tops of each layer with Frangelico liquer when assembling the cake. It looked beautiful and tasted better.

This cake is amazing! The filling is like nothing I've had before and it was delicious and easy to make. I did simmer the sweetened condensed milk in the sealed can on the stove for 90 minutes. I also used unsweetened coconut and it was sweet enough. I used 2-9" cake pans and cut the cakes in half to make three layers. There was enough filling for three layers. This cake took time but there were very few mistakes you could make. One time saving tip is to use an ice bath to cool down the icing. It took minutes to cool to room temperature instead of 1 hour in the fridge.

A suggestion on how to cut this cake. I used a sharp knife dipped in a tall glass of hot water. I did this for each cut. Dry & redip knife in between slices. It cut beautifully through the chocolate and layers.

I have made this cake many times just as written and have loved it every time. Makes a wonderful and surprising Easter dessert. One time when I was trying to cut down on time I used a box cake mix for German CHocolate cake and that worked well too.

Even though everyone raved about this cake, I thought the cake portion was drier than I had expected. I used the Dulce de Leche simply because I needed to simplify the process. I found the filling to be a tad on the dry side. Next time I may experiment with adding something to the filling to make it more moist like uncaramelized sweetended condensed milk. When someone figures out a way to slice this without dismantling it, I'm all ears! Otherwise, it was quite tasty and very well received.

Rating: 4
Delicious cake very impressive looking! I did not find the cake either flat or dry. Mine rose beautifully. I used 3-8" pans (that's what I had). That might account for a little bit of the height. Don't overbake, I have double ovens and cooked all three in center rack not more than 18-20 minutes. With the three layers and filling, it was a tall cake. I found Nestle Dulce De Leche at my grocery store and used that. I would recommend heating it, so it is easier to spread and a thinner consistency. I used Droste Dutch coco powder and Callebaut semi sweet chocolate. Frosing was the best ever. The recipe AS WRITTEN is perfect. I doubled the filling but would not do that again. I have a lot left over.

Using a brand spanking new tin of baking powder, I still found that this cake was on the short and dry side. The filling, made, as suggested, by boiling the can of sweetened condensed milk, was wonderful and I'm going to have to make it again, but with a different cake or an amaretto soak to moisten the cake bits. Thanks to the reviewers who made great suggestions.

One of the best cakes I have ever made. My husband begs me to make it. It is time consuming but well worth it. The tip to boil the can of SCM in water for 1 1/2 hours was great. The cake layers are always done sooner than I expect in a little more than half the time the recipe says. Has this happened to anyone else? May just be my oven.

I am the chef of this cake and I see alot of cooks are having trouble getting the cake to rise. Please know that Baking Powder has a shelf life and the stuff that has been sitting in your cupboard or refrigerator is probably old and that is why it is not rising.

First off, I want to say that this one of the best cakes I've ever made. And I've made MANY cakes in my lifetime! The instructions may sound daunting, but there are ways to cut down on the "active" time: 1) use the boiling method for the condensed milk (this way you free up your oven for other steps), 2) use already-roasted and chopped pecans (I got mine from Trader Joe's), 3) toast the coconut while the milk is boiling (on a side note, I only buy unsweetened desiccated coconut because I've found that the sweetened version contains chemicals that literally burn my eyes whenever I open the oven door to check doneness. It may taste better, but it scares me!), 4) make the cake batter while the coconut is in the oven, 5) make the icing while the cake is baking, and 6) if the cup of icing is taking too long to set in the fridge, put it in the freezer (but watch it!). I don't have three cake pans, so I used the two 9-inch ones I have readily available. The layers still turned out pretty thin, but it didn't even matter. Once everything was put together the finished product was breathtaking. One other suggestion: DON'T SKIMP ON THE FILLING! Double the recipe and use the leftovers to spread on good brioche - you won't be sorry! This was a fabulous cake that wasn't too sweet, had tons of flavor, and received RAVE reviews all around. Four forks just isn't enough!

Rating: 4
So good. I took the suggestions of other chefs and doubled the filling. Boiled the milk in the can, I had read that it can burn your pot so I put a bit of oil into the water (as if boiling pasta). Made the ganache half butter half cream (could not decide so split the middle). The only thing I might try differently next time is make more fosting, maybe 1 1/2 times. Love the chocolate leaves suggestion- did not read it until I was already done but will try next time- it sounds beautiful.

Rating: 4
Oh, my! Was this good! Used cream instead of butter in the ganache, boiled the can of SCM (keep it covered with water) for 1 1/2 hours, used 8 in. pans instead of 9 in. Layers were still a little thin but it looked perfect when it was all put together. (With 8 in. pans I'll make less ganache next time.) My husband and his family all loved it!

Rating: 4
If presentation isn't paramount, this cake can be simplified by making it as a sheet cake - still tastes like a four-forker, but much easier prep. Prepare a full recipe of batter and bake all in a 9x13 pan. Make the amount of filling specified in the recipe (I use the boiling method for the dulce de leche) and spread this atop the cooled cake. Pour the glaze over, cool and voila - German chocolate sheet cake. (By the way, I prefer a ganache made with cream rather than butter, as I find the butter-based glaze a little greasy).

I made this recipe for New Years only after making sure to read the reviews for it. By doing this, I reduced the cooking time in half. First thing, boil the cans as suggested for a little under the 90 minutes (I did 1hr 15mins and let the cans sit to cool). Once that is going, I put the coconut and pecans in the oven to toast, checking evert few minutes and stirring. While this was occuring I was making the cake batter and had my boyfriend oil and line the pans for me. By the time the fillings were toasted the cake was ready for the oven. Last thing to make was the glaze. I cooled only one cup of frosting, I wish I has done more to really covers the sides. I left that in a liquid measuring cup uncovered in the fridge, whisking every 5 minutes until spreadable. For the remaining glaze, instead of heating it up i just let it sit at room temp while the rest was cooling, spooned it along the sides first when the cake was assembled and then poored the rest over the top evenly. By doing this I only needed to make one more pass with the dripped glaze over the top and the whole thing was covered. I had doubled the filling and had leftovers, which i used as decoration on the outside over the glaze when it was cooled over night to fill in the indents from the layers. This took me 2.5 hours, and this cake looks and tastes better than anything I have ever baked. i also decorated with chocolate leaves as another reviewer suggested, so professional looking!

I loved this recipe!! I was a little disappointed with the flatness of the cake layers, but they tasted delicious. I think I have found out why they lacked height. Dutch cocoa is treated with alkali which softens the acidity, but undoes some of the function of leaveners resulting in flat cake layers. I read that American cocoa podwder (such as Hershey's) is not treated like the Dutch cocoa, but is more acidic and has a bit of a different taste.

This cake was a hit with friends. Using others' suggestions, I doubled the coconut mixture and simmered the condensed milk in the can over the stove. Both ideas worked well! Comments said that the cake tasted even better the next day so I may make it a day earlier next time. Recipe was time consuming, but a lot of fun!

Most major supermarkets with Hispanic food sections will carry Dulce de Leche. That cuts an hour and half out of production time. I warmed it in the microwave to thin it and poured the vanilla into it before mixing in the coconut and nuts. If you pour the vanilla into the coconut, it gets absorbed by the coconut it lands on and doesn't infuse the filling. I 've made this a couple of times, changing things each time. My preference is to not toast the coconut (still toasting the pecans). I double the cake portion and use cake flour and one and a half times the filling. A hint - if you cool the remaining chocolate frosting slightly (the part that's supposed to pour over the cake at the end), it won't all pour off the cake. Doing it this way, I was able to manipulate it into a nice smooth finish. A great, easy cake. Oh, the earlier hint about tapping the airbubbles out of the pans before cooking the cake portion is a good one. Thanks!

I was there for the entire thing, but even I can't believe I made this cake, it turned out that well. Everyone's tips were helpful, particularly the quick fix for boiling the milk (unopened can submerged in boilng water for an hour-and-a-half, watch to make sure the water level doesn't get low). I felt like a cross between a hobo and a mad scientist doing it, but when I opened the can, the milk had the perfect color and consistency. I followed every other step to the letter and the result was perfect.

I really enjoyed the flavor of the coconut/pecan layer. I will use it even if I make a normal german chocolate cake. The only advice that I have is when you refrigerate some of the glaze, do at least 2 cups instead of 1 so that you can cover the sides of the cake entirely with glaze. You'll understand after you try it.

Rating: 2
I made only the cake, as I had plans for a different filling. While the consistency was perfect, I was a little disappointed by the flavor. It was very chocolatey, which was great, but had almost a "fudge-like" taste, as opposed to a creamy chocolate taste. Still, I'd make it again.

Wonderful!! When I make it again however, I think Ill skip the whole condesed-milk-in-the-oven-for-an-hour& a half-thing, and opt for the tradition microwave version! I couldnt really tell a difference. Ill definatly still toast the pecons and coconut though, that added a wonderful touch.

The cake layers and coconut filling are quite delicious, especially with the toasted pecans. However, I found the chocolate ganache to be cloyingly sweet, even in such a traditionally sweet recipe -- it overpowered the other flavors in he cake. Alternatively, I would suggest making extra cocnut filling to apply to the top layer of the cake, and use ganache as a decorative accent on the filling rather than a medium of "sealing" the cake.

Mmm!! Outstanding cake. Everyone loved it. I made it for my boyfriend's bday, and I would definitely make it again for a special occasion. Nothing too difficult, but time consuming-- esp if it's your first time making it. I used the oven/water-bath method for the milk. I doubled the filling recipe, and since we have two ovens, I put one milk in each. For water baths, one large cast-iron pan and one aluminum basting pan. Both worked well. I had about 1 to 2 cups of filling left over, so I saved it for putting on wheat bagels later. Yum! I used Ghiradelli's semi-sweet chips for the glaze and Sharfenberger for cocoa powder. Also used 8-inch pans. No decorations on cake, just small roses and jasmine flowers around the bottom. The glaze cooled to form hair-thin swirls on top, for some reason-- kind of marblized. Gorgeous! Filling was incredible; the glaze tasted like truffle filling. Next time I will try the gold glitter/stencil idea.

Outstanding! I made this recipe for my husband's birthday and people had seconds! - My husband had thirds! Goes down well with a giant glass of cold milk at midnight...Fairly easy to make, just take your time - I used cake flour instead of all-purpose and Ghirardelli semi-sweet chips for the glaze - no complaints will make again and again.

I used all Valrohna chocolate in the cake and glaze. The cake part and the filling were extraordinary. As for the glaze, I think a ganache might have been tastier and would have been easier. It seems that the upside of the glaze is the smooth, shiny surface (rather than the taste). The top of my cake was beautiful, but the sides had drip marks that I wasn't entirely pleased with. Standingly alone, the glaze tasted good, but I think cream/chocolate of ganache would taste better than the butter/chocolate of the glaze. My modifications for the filling were to double the recipe (and I'm glad I did) and to boil the 2 cans of milk (unopened) for 90 minutes rather than use the cumbersome oven method. Both worked perfectly. The cake received rave reviews.

I have made this cake many times. It always gets rave reviews. It is time consuming!!! I typically make the coconut filling a day before. I have not found a source for Valrhona cocoa powder in Gainesville, Florida, however, though we do have a few specialty shops here (most notably Uppercrust). I just use Hershey's cocoa.

I made this cake for my father's birthday since the reviews were so positive, but was disappointed and frustrated with the results. Like a previous reviewer, the layers came out thin and uneven. It was so bad, that it wasn't possible to use them, so I made the cake layers AGAIN, this time cooking them on the same rack (layed in a triangle shape). Unfortunatly, they came out the same way. I haven't had any probelms with other cakes, so I don't think it's my oven. I ended up being REALLY creative with the uneven layers and using them anyway and the cake turned out delicious..but not very pretty. Any ideas on why this may have happened? Cake, filling and icing got rave reviews for taste - would love to have it look nice too.

This is a wonderful cake, but takes FOREVER to cook and assemble. The nutty caramel filling was the hit of my party, but it took 45 minutes longer to cook than the recipe alloted.

Vanilla ice-cream a nice compliment.

This is a pretty good cake and it looked just like the picture. If you're a coconut-pecan fan, you will love the filling. I doubled the filling recipe also. 4 ruined cans of milk, 2 burnt cups of coconut, and 1 second degree burn later, I have a few tips. (1) Cook the milk on top of the stove on low and stir it CONSTANTLY so it doesn't burn. It's much easier (and safer)than the water bath. (2)The filling will thicken if cooked long enough and it will turn a deep tan color. (3)When roasting your pecans and coconut, watch them closely or they will burn.

This is the cake I make when I want to impress people. I've made this cake about 6 times for various occasions. I follow the recipe exactly and the cake turns out beautiful, dense, rich and elegant. This is a show-stopper - but be prepared for the amount of time it takes from start to finish and don't rush yourself! All good things come to those who wait!

This is the best German chocolate cake ever. It's not too sweet but very rich. I doubled the filling too and am glad I did, it was excellent! It does take a while longer in the water bath though. I ended up cooking the sweetened condensed milk for 2 hours total. Thanks for the recipe.

Time-consuming, yes - but using Dulce de Leche would make it a cinch. BIG hit at my father-in-law's birthday dinner....I added toasted coconut on top for a festive touch, and my 8-year-old daughter loved the "croutons", lol! It was so beautiful that my brother-in-law accused me of buying it at Dean and DeLuca - not a bad compliment!

i agree that the recipe was misleading, the condensed milk didn't get substantially thicker...however the filling for the cake was still divine. i too boiled the milk on the stove and doubled the filling. i found the cake layers weren't as chocolately as i would like, and weren't robust enough for the filling, in addition, the glaze was lacking in flavour. the presentation and the toasted coconut make up for this though...it was beautiful!

I made this for my family this Easter and they loved it! They all said it was the best cake that they ever had. I would definitely make it again, but it was a lot of work. I also felt that the milk didn't seem to get as "thick" as the recipe suggested.

Ladies, I work on a bond trading desk,lots of guys-this cake- HUGE Hit:) The changes I made were for the cake 1 cup of sugar, for the filling 18oz condensed milk & 1 1/4 cups chopped pecans, for the icing 2 sticks butter & 12 oz semisweet chocolate.

Made it for a birthday at the office. Everyone raved about the LOOK of the cake, and also enjoyed the taste. Those who expected a devil's food kind of flavor were probably disappointed -- the cake part is very much a traditional german chocolate. I did use more of the sweetened condensed milk in the filling to avoid it being too dry. Overall, very dramatic (and it didn't take as much time as is estimated.) RLP

A very good cake. I was surprised that other cooks didn't have enough glaze. I will cut back next time, since the glaze was at least a half inch thick all over.

I first made this cake in August of 2001 and have made it 4 more times...it is awesome! To save time you can make the cake layers a week in advance, wrap in Saran and freeze until assembly. This has become a family favorite.

Awesome! I made this cake twice... once to *practice* and the second time for T'giving. Found the filling too dry and crumbly the first time and difficult, so used the filling recipe from the Baker's German Choc. box. Much goo-ier, much better! Also used semi-sweet choc. chips for the ganache and saved out 1 1/2C for 'patching' which still left me plenty for pouring over. Decorated with edible yellow snapdragons. My family is STILL impressed!

This was absolutely fabulous! I made one for my husbands birthday because his favorite is German chocolate. I have to admit while making his cake I swore I would never make it again because it was so time consuming (especially with little ones at my feet). However, after tasting it I made it just a few weeks later for a friend's birthday and took it to her office and had many requests for the recipe. Definitely worth the effort!

WOW!WOW!WOW! This was the most incredible cake! It was very rich, so it can serve at least sixteen. I made this for my son's teacher on her birthday, and the the staff at the school were talking about it all day! My son's teacher said this was the BEST cake she had EVER had! What a compliment!

I made this for my husband's birthday the other day and it turned out perfect! I've made a lot of cakes and I have to say that this one was one of the prettiest and tastiest. I followed the directions exactly and although it was a lot of work it was worth it. The filling is scrumptious and the chocolate glaze is wonderful, too. I bought a "happy birthday" stencil made by Wilton and used gold edible glitter over it - it looked professional! Overall, a definite four-forker.

This cake is CRAZYSEXYCOOL! I hesitate to give it 4 forks due to the richness of the cake and bitterness of the ganache even though it's supposed to be that way because I'm afraid it might not suit the tastes of all guests one might have. I loved it, enjoyed making it and would recommend it highly. Smucker's makes the Dulce De Leche which another reviewer mentioned is made by Nestle. It was perfect and no messing with the condensed milk. 1 1/2 jars warmed in the micro did it. Don't be intimidated at all anyone can make this. This will be my xmas eve cake from now on.

Great recipe. A tad time consuming, but worthwhile results. I have used this cake with other fillings with excellent results as well.

I can't cook--at all--and I made this cake for friends and family over Thanksgiving. Everyone raved about it and it looked spectacular. It took so long that I would only make it once or twice a year, but I am a novice. I would definitely make 50% more of the filling because not only does it taste great, but my cakes weren't completely flat and I needed some extra filling to fill in the space. The only other comment is to me, the glaze tasted too buttery. Did anyone else think so?

You can now buy the carmelized sweetened condensed milk in the store. It is called "Dulche De Leche" Nestle makes it. With thart step removed this is a very easy recipe & well worth the effort.

Rating: 3
I tried the suggestion of cooking the condensed milk on the stovetop and would caution people to not let it cook too long. I waited for the milk to turn "golden" as is described in the oven version, and found that I cooked it too long. Other than that, the recipe is delicious!

Rating: 4
I've made this cake several times and agree that it is excellent. I've made the filling both using the oven method and the stove-top method and find no appreciable difference in the outcome. I find the cake to be as good or better the day after it is assembled.

This is a fantastic cake. My office keeps asking for it! I do take a shortcut though, by cooking the Sweetened Condensed Milk in a saucepan over medium heat for about 7 minutes or until it has thickened, and then add the toasted pecans and coconut. This works just as well, and saves a lot of time!

Rating: 3
I didn't think this recipe was very labor intensive at all. You can make this cake over several days if you want. I made it twice this week and the second time I used the boiling the can of sweetened condensed milk process which was very easy. The second time I made it, I made the cake layers and toasted the coconut and pecans on the first day. The second day I made the Filling and put it on the cakes and the third day (the day I served it) I made the glaze and put it on the cake. I kept the cake refrigerated over the three days. I think the "Active time: 1 1/2 hr" is pretty close to right once I had the recipe figured out. I did not use Dutch Process cocoa, the regular stuff worked just fine. Now as to how everyone liked it: It is a little on the dense side, which people loved, and the semisweet glaze was enjoyed because it was rich and chocolaty (not milk chocolaty)! My friends said to give the cake (as a whole) all thumbs up! Everyone took some home to there hubbies. I will use this recipe from now on for my chocolate, nuts and coconut loving friends and family.

Absolutely amazing! I've made it 3 times in 2 months. Suddenly everyone in my family wants THIS cake for their birthday. I used 3 8" cake pans, plain old Hershey's cocoa powder, and regular chocolate chips for the ganache and it was still superb! It's really not that time consuming. You can make it while getting other things done around this house, easily.

Time-consuming but well worth the effort. Wish I had read the milk-boiling tip before I made it! Simple garnish on top center and around the base of extra coconut gave it a beautiful finish (recommend untoasted to give a nice white contrast to the dark chocolate glaze.

I used 3 8" round pans instead to make thicker layers. Toasting the coconut and pecans was a big plus in adding flavor. I had more than enough ganache to cover the cake. Very good. My husband loved it!

This cake is amazing! I'm not much of a chocoholic, but even I loved this one. It was very simple to put together, though a little time-consuming, and it was more than worth the effort. I made it for my husband's birthday (German chocolate is his favorite), and it was a huge hit. Everybody who tasted it was amazed it was homemade. My only warning is to keep a close eye on the coconut while you're toasting it, as it can burn quickly. Next time I make this cake--and I will--I will probably turn down the oven temperature a bit for the coconut.

Wow! I just finished eating a piece of this that I made for a co-worker's birthday. It was amazing. I followed the directions exactly with the only exception being that I boiled the milk for 90 minutes. I did not double the filling and found it to be perfect. Will make this again.

I made this for my cake-loving brother-in-law's 50th birthday. He loves my baking so I was under a lot of pressure to produce a real stand-out. This cake delivered big time. Rich and delicate, it was something out of a Viennese cafe. And I loved that it looked exactly like the picture. Next time I won't double the filling like some other bakers had recommended - it was almost too rich. Boiling the cans of milk on the stovetop sounded so novel but the cans I had were pull-top and I was worried they'd explode. I didn't find it inconvenient at all to bake the milk in the oven. This cake is absolutely worth the time and effort.

Great cake and not difficult to make. I'm somewhat of a novice baker and the cake turned out beautifully. I boiled the can of milk on the stovetop for 1 1/2 hours and it was perfect. I didn't care for the semisweet chocolate glaze; I thought it was too dark of a chocolate with such a sweet filling. Next time I will cut it with milk chocolate. By the way, I used regular syrup in the glaze instead of corn syrup---still turned out okay. My tip: Apply only about 1/3 of the warm glaze to the top and center of the cake. Then use a spatula to push the glaze down the sides. This will allowed me to cover up all of the crumb frosting. Then I just poured the rest of the glaze on top and it coated the whole cake.

This is a time-consuming, but absolutely fabulous cake. I have made it twice--once for my family and once for my husband's family. The two families are very different, but they both raved about this cake. It's very rich, so serve only small slices, but it keeps well for days even after cutting if refrigerated.

I've made several recipes off epicurious, which are almost all wonderful, but this one is amazing beyond words. I made this for my husband's birthday party of about 20 people, and this cake was the talk of the party -- everyone swore I got it from a gourmet bakery. It was time consuming but not difficult to make, and all the tips listed in the reviews were very helpful, especially the one about boiling the milk in the can on the stove. I made it the night before the party, and it was great the next day -- i think it was even better the day after that. This recipe goes in my "keeper" list as #1.

This was wonderful! And the small white edible orchids that I put as a spray across the top and around the bottom only made it more beautiful. I can't wait to make it again. Everyone's comments were a huge help. I too doubled the filling. However, I followed the directions on the label of the condensed milk can and cooked the milk in the top of a double boiler. However, in my anxiousness to do it all "right," I cooked the milk too long and over toasted the coconut and nuts. Next time it will be perfectly perfect.

I made this cake for my father's birthday. The end result was beautiful. I took the other reviewers advice: I doubled the filling, boiled the condensed milk, and to cut back on the richness I used half semi-sweet & half milk chocolate for the glaze. Everyone loved the look & taste of the cake. It took about 3 hours total. I will definitely be making this cake again.

I loved this recipe. I made it for easter and followed some of the suggestions made in the reviews. I boiled the condensed milk for 1 1/2 hours instead of baking it and put a dish cloth under the cans so they wouldn't stain my pot. I also doubled the filling. It looked like a lot, but that was the best part of the cake and I am glad I did. I also had to remelt the "dribbled off" glaze and reglaze 3-4 times to get a smooth finish. I didn't find that it took an excessive amount of time seeing that the finished product was so great! I made the cake and the filling the day before easter and glazed it easter morning.

I made this cake for my book group - everyone loved it! I baked the cake the night before. Also, I really appreciated the extra information in the recipe, i.e. batter will be thin. I used bittersweet chocolate for the glaze and the whole thing was just amazing. I would consider doubling the filling next time. A fabulous cake recipe - try it!

This recipe was VERY time-consuming but well worth it. I made if for a birthday at the office and the 100 people I work with were fighting over the crumbs. I got MANY recipe requests and people are still talking about it 1 month later. I did boil the can of sweetened condensed milk and was grateful for the tip. I also agree that the filling was not enough and if I ever have the time to make this again I will double the filling.

Really decadent. Everyone was really impressed with this one.I thought the actual cake (bread part) was spectacular. Took the advice of other reviews and didn't use but half of the chocolate glaze.

Rating: 4
The last time I made this cake, I doubled the coconut/pecan filling ingredients because I think the filling is the most important part of German Chocolate Cake, and I think the recipe skimps on it. Also, I think the chocolate glaze can be overwhelming (and I'm a chocolate lover!) so I cut the chocolate glaze ingredients in half and instead of glazing the entire cake, I simply pour it over the top and let it dribble down the sides.

Rating: 4
I'm saving this recipie. German Chocolate Cake is such a favorite among my friends and I love having a dressier version to treat them with on their birthdays'. The reviews were so helpful. The can trick DOES work and it WILL stain the bottom of your pot. Doing the cake and filling the night before the party (leaving only the frosting for the next day) gave me plenty of time to concentrate on other party details. It looked just like the photograph and smelled and tasted wonderful. I even liked this cake cold out of the refrigerator. My only stumble was when I poured the frosting over the cake, I didn't have it hot enough and it left drip trails instead of a smooth finish, but that was easily corrected by smoothing the drips and just heating the remaining frosting more and pouring it over the cake. I wish I had more cake recipies that worked as well, tasted as good and were as fun to make.

I'm a 19-year-old male, and if I can make this recipe with such great success, anyone can! I used the precise ingredients the recipe calls for, and the cake came out wonderfully! I received rave reviews from everyone I showed it off to! I highly recommend it!

Rating: 4
Everything about the cake was wonderful...it was fun to make, beautiful, and of course, it was delicious! I had no problems with the recipe. While making the cake layers, the melted butter hardened when added to the milk and, as a result, I wasn't able to get the liquids mixed completely before adding them to the dry ingredients but this didn't affect the cake at all. I also boiled the can for 1 hr. 40 mins. From start to finish, the cake only took me a little over 3 hours...it would take less time if you started boiling the milk while making the cake layers. Instead of assembling the cake on a rack, I did it on my serving stand...I slid wax paper strips part-way under the cake to catch the glaze and removed them after it hardened a bit. This was, without a doubt, one of the funnest, best looking, and tastiest cakes I've ever made. A couple people even said it was the best cake they had EVER tasted! I can't wait to make it again!!!!!!

This was spectacular, and so much fun to make. A couple of the comments said it was expensive, but I didn't find it so. I had almost everything I needed already. I used inexpensive cocoa and chocolate, and it was still awesome. Thanks to everybody for the boiling the can suggestion, it worked great. We didn't know how long to boil the can, so boiled it for 1 hr 40 min. We couldn't tell if it was done by shaking the can, but when we opened it, it was perfect. I made the cake layers the day before and wrapped them up overnight. That made the preparation the day of the party pretty easy. I pushed the filling into place with my fingers, which worked just fine. I never did get the glaze perfectly smooth, but it didn't matter, it still looked wonderful, and tasted even better. I had no idea the glaze would be so good, it tasted like chocolate truffles spread all over the outside of the cake. Now all I need is an excuse to make this again. It is so impressive it really deserves a special occasion.

This cake is so wonderful!! I don't bake, but I love to cook! It was so totally unlike me to make this dessert, I really appreciated all of the advice from everyone, especially submerging the milk in the boiling water for 1 1/2hr. I will make this again!! And take all the "Cudoos"!!!!!!

It took me 4 hours to make this cake and every single minute was worth it. My family raved about how this cake was like what they would get in a resturant. Serve it in very thin slices because it is so rich. A regular size piece would be wasted even among the most avid chocolate lovers. I had no problems at all with either the filling or the glaze. Just cut a circle of cardboard the same size as your cake pan, set it on a wire rack and assemble the entire cake from there. You will be able to turn the cake with ease and transfer it to a cake stand or plate with ease after the glaze is set. It may be labor intensive, but the steps are rather easy. I usesd regular Hershey's cocoa in the cake and Giredelli semisweet chocolate chips for the glaze. I don't understand why everyone thinks this cake is so expensive. I had all the ingredients except the chocolate chips in my pantry. They are staples. At any rate, make this one. It is worth all the time and effort!

GREAT recipe! I also skipped recipe technique for preparing the condensed milk and just boiled the can (totally submerged) in water for an hour. Milk came out thickened and carmelized.

They stain!)

WOW! This is an awesome cake. It is a lot of work but worth every minute. Toasting the pecans and coconut makes it and gives the cake a texture unlike any German chocolate cake I've made or ever tasted. I will make it again and again, and again. A real hit in my family.

I read and re-read the reviews before making this for a special dinner party. It is time consuming, but straight forward so not really difficult. The cake really is delicious. My only problem with it is that after a heavy gourmet meal, dessert is sometimes lost because people are too full. If I make this again, I will serve a much lighter meal so the cake can be appreciated as it should. I froze the remainder in individual slices so we can take out one at a time.

This cake was a great success at my sister's wedding shower. If you are a chocolate lover this is a fabulous cake! I agree that it is extremely time consuming (and expensive) but I decide to do the cake in stages. I froze the three cakes (and they still tasted great after 6 days), I made the filled two days before the shower, and then I iced it the night before. I decorated the cake with raspberries and hearts and people that it was professional. I think this cake can feed 16 people if everyone wanted a medium size piece (most guests just wanted a sliver and I ended up with more than half a cake left over).

This was labor intensive and the bit about the condensed milk was a pain. I couldn't make it work so I used a tried and true recipe from another book that ALWAYS works.For the glaze I used milk chocolate and iced the whole cake. I saved about 1/2 to 3/4 for the glaze. It looked nice and I did get compliments on it, but that filling idea is too much bother.

I also agree that this recipe is very time-consuming. I made it for a party and received overwhelming compliments, although many thought it too rich. I thought the glaze turned out beautifully, but did have to reheat it several times to get pouring consistency. I would only make this recipe for very special occasions.

This cake is absolutely fabulous. I highly recommend it. I agree with the others that it is fairly time consuming, but I took some advice from previous reviews that helped. I boiled the condensed milk for an hour and a half, instead of baking it. I also made both the cake and the filing the day before, and whipped up the icing the next morning. Next time I would probably try to just glaze the cake with the warmed icing, instead of icing it then glazing on top. It was too rich for me. I'm not sure the glaze would be as beautiful without an icing base though. I also decorated the base with fresh strawberries, and put one perfect berry surrounded by a fan of sliced ones on top. It looked impressive for my gourmet club.

Worked GREAT! I simplified the filling by boiling the whole can of sweetened milk for about an hour. Can needs to be almost completely submerged. You can shake it to hear it thickening. Frosting ran when i poured it over, should have been cooler, but just stuck it back in fridge for a few minutes then refrosted. Tastes great, wasnt very hard. I'd definately make it again after i finish eating all of this one!

The cake is delicious, and the recipe worked well. My only problem was when icing the cake. After stacking the layers, the filling was still warm. This made icing the sides of the cake difficult because the icing softened a bit. I would recommend letting the cake and filling cool a bit before applying the icing.

This cake was much easier to make than I thought, although the filling was too time consuming. I would suggest just substituting the Baker's chocolate recipe, the filling is just as good.

This cake is very time consuming because of the filling. The filling is easier made by a method of thickening the sweetened condenseed milk described by Alan Rachlin in his Healthy Latin Cooking cookbook. You boil a can of unopened condened milk TOTALLY SUBMERGED. I do not remember the time you will have to look it up. This was the most time consuming part of this cake. Next time I will boil a can, I've done it before, you do need to keep an eye on it so the water level is kept up or it may explode and create a huge mess (not to mention injuries if anyone is around). The cake itself is wonderfully moist and the frosting as long as you follow the directions spreads easily.

I made this cake for my husband's birthday, and it was a disaster! I followed the recipe to a T--except that I only had fat free sweetened condensed milk, so I substituted that. The water bath and long cooking time for the filling is time-consuming nonsense, and my milk cooked down WAY too much even though I followed the directions. I also found the icing a big pain--again, I followed the directions, but 3/4 of the frosting just drips off the cake, and I used expensive Callebaut chocolate--what a waste. I found this recipe so exasperating that I feel like not renewing my Gourmet subscription. I'd rather have the traditional German Sweet Chocolate cake any day (you can find the recipe inside the Baker's bar).

This is a great cake to serve with afternoon tea or for an evening group get-together. It also freezes well. My version varied a little from the original due to the limitations of my pantry - and my own forgetfulness!!! I used a cocoa product that was a mix of regular and Dutch process for the cake layers. But... I discovered the melted butter still sitting on the stove after I had put the layers in the oven! This made little difference to the taste of the cake because of the rich frosting and filling! I used Giardelli (sp?) semi-sheet chocolate chips for the frosting and substituted Lyle's Golden Syrup for Karo light syrup. I only had fat-free condensed milk which appeared to work just as well as the regular variety. I also only had about 4 oz sweetened coconut so compensated by adding a few more pecans. The result, as I said before, was delicious! Thank you, Gourmet.
