Delicious and different, serve with green bean salad.

I couldn't find the lettuces called for so I used spring mix. I also used Ciabatta for the bread portion of the program. The rest I followed as written. The combination of flavors was fabulous! Everyone loved them.

Been making it for years. Tuna Guys (out of Kingston WA) does have a younger line caught low in mercury high in omega 3 tuna that is DELICIOUS! You can order it on the web -just do a search for "Tuna Guys"

I used chopped olives instead of olive paste, and Wonder Bread (egad!) instead of the french loaf. It was scrumptious and easy.

This is an easy and tasty sandwiche. I opted to eat the kalamata olives on the side and will try spinach when my arugula gets too big. I will also try a sharp cheese as suggested by other reviewers next time.

Great recipe...have been making since 1992. Excellent for picnics...doesn't get soggy...can understand the "cheese" references below...but you need to make the green bean salad recipe in the original magazine article...it's better than the sandwich!!!!

Very good. Easy and simple. Just as a Nicoise should be. I agree with the review below: a sharp cheese is essential. Gives it that rough-hewn edge it deserves. Great for taking to work as an alternative for ordering out {for those of you who order out regularily}. Take a mug of spinach-mint soup along and you have yourself a great meal.

Good re-composition of Salade Nicoise, sandwich style. I'd suggest another essential Salade Nicoise element -- sharp cheese. [It's usually grated Parmeasan or Pecorino in the Salade.] NOTE: I accessed this recipe from All American Albacore website ... a grassroots organizing website of Western Fishing Boat Operators who lobbied Bumble Bee Seafood for a special, American-caught younger tuna that's higher in Omega-3 healthy oils.
