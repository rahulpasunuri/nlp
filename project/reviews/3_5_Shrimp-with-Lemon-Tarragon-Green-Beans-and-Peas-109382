This was good. I would have thought it excellent if it had taken only an hour to prepare. But like many good recipes it includes a lot of steps, and it took about 2.5 hours. I'm not sure the payoff was worth it compared to other 2.5-hour dishes.

Wonderful light, summer dish. The flavor of tarragon was delicious and refreshing!

Delicious! In an effort to clean out my freezer, I used frozen green beans, thawed in fridge, which worked just fine. Also, use the large skillet from the leeks for the water and veggies in the following step or else it will take forever in a saucepan to boil down the shrimp shells. I gave up after 1 hour of boiling, measured out 1/4 cup shrimp water for the next step and then froze the rest of the strained shrimp water, about 1 cup, for the next time I make this recipe. This way I will purchase already shelled, raw shrimp and then thaw the leftover shrimp water. Though both my beans and peas were frozen, the veggies had an amazing, fresh flavor. I also tossed in a little minced garlic, like the other reviewers suggested, at the end of sauteeing the leeks.

Way, way too much tarragon! Even half the amount would be too much. Shrimp has such a subtle and delicate flavour, that the tarragon simply overpowers it and that is all you can taste. I am upset with myself because I really should have known this would happen. Even if you are a tarragon lover, I suggest you start with a small amount and increase gradually.

This dish tasted very fresh and spring-like. I substituted asparagus for the green beans and served it over jasmine rice. Only used 1 stick of butter to save a few calories!

The flavors in this dish are excellent. It is fabulous for a spring meal. It is a not a quick meal, nor low fat, but a delicious treat for when you have a little more time and reason for something special. That said, I can see making again and again because the flavors are so wonderful. For those really concerned about the calories, just use less of the sauce, I found there to be planty, although it was so good over some jasmine rice.

Delicious, and I served it with quinoa which was a great grain to go with this (extremely) buttery and flavorful sauce. One thing to keep in mind though is that it takes longer to make than the recipe says, unless you are super-fast at cleaning shrimp, and cleaning, "preening" and chopping herbs like tarragon. (For me it's very time consuming!)

This recipt was a little time consuming, but it was worth it. Did not have enough leeks, maybe 3 cups, so I added garlic. I served it with almond rice and the combination worked real well. Will definitely make this again.

Hi Cook in Astoria. You'd want to boil the Shrimp shells, it imparts a deeper, richer flavor than just the shrimp could. Try it both ways and you'll see why boiling the shells adds a depth of flavor, you'd otherwise miss. Happy cooking

1.1/2 sticks of butter is not be unusual in a dish like this, especially when making herb butter. I also added a clove of garlic (personal taste) which really enhanced the dish.

Haven't made it yet, but to astrid: that's 8 CUPS not quarts. Regarding the butter,just don't put much sauce on your finished product. Should be good over some rice later.

This dish is great. I have made it with Sea scallops and used clam broth in place of the shrimp shells.I also, sauted the scallops in butter. The amount of water and butter. Isn't a problem a 1 and a half stick of butter isn't bad think Atkins, the amount of water, you need this in order for the beans and peas to cook evenly, the time of 40 minutes will reduce this to a 1/4 cup with out a problem.

I agree that seems to be a large amount of butter to use, and 8 qts. of water seems like a lot also, especially to reduce for 16 shrimp and several cups of vegetables. I have not tried it but might with less butter/ water.

I just re-read the ingredients list. It does sound like an over-zealous use of butter. Maybe you can substitute fat-back to make it more heart-healthy : )

I am willing to try this but it has been a long time since I've made something with more than one stick of butter. Are they kidding?? I would love to know if anyone can cut down considerably on the butter without ruining this recipe.
