Used bacon instead of pancetta for bugetary reasons, but still excellent!

Doubled the recipe for a bug dinner party I threw this week. I made the recipe as is, but there were definitely too many peas! You can cut down on those, but other wise it was a truly delicious, easy, and simple recipe. I had NO leftovers, and I made a kilo of pasta! A final note, using the pasta water is a MUST!

I wont rate this recipe because I changed it - I used ham - that's what I had, and it looked very pretty - and green garlic, which I highly recommend.I also only used sugar snap peas, left whole instead of sliced. To keep the prep much simpler, simply add the peas at the right time to the cooking pasta - no need to cook, cool and reheat.

Loved the flavor. Too many peas for my taste. Will decrease next time.

This recipe is easy, tasty and (relatively) healthy. The flavors of the snap peas, sweet peas and pancetta is a great sweet/salt combination (and I used frozen, so fresh will be divine). This will be added to my during-the-week repertiore.

Made this dish as is except had to use all frozen peas as they were all I had. It was delish! It is a lightly sauced pasta so we did add lots of freshly grated parm-reggiano cheese. I highly recommend this dish. BONUS = not only is this pasta delicious, it is also cheap and easy to make :) Enjoy!

Well after reading all the reviews, I will be making this today from the "Big Ol Mess" of peas from todays garden harvest. Being a veggie eater i may fry some Tofu in stead of the meat. But this sounds very tastey. Hank

didn't have any peas in the shell but worked just as well with frozen sweet petite peas. Used some really good peppery pancetta (didn't add pepper to the dish at the end). Don't skimp on the parmesan! Yummy!

This was delish. Thought I had shallots and realized I was out so I used 1 elephant garlic clove instead and it worked out fine. Also missed the instruction to "finely" chop pancetta and cut chunks that were about 1" by 1/2". I liked it that way with nice meaty chunks. After pancetta was cooked, I drained it on paper towels, poured fat out of the pan and then measured back 3 tablespoons before sauteing garlic. Cuts out a lot of unnecessary fat and gives dish a fresh healthy taste.

I changed the recipe a lot based on what I had on hand but it was still really tasty. I used just frozen baby peas (no snow or snap peas) and substituted prosciutto for pancetta. Definitely use lots of cheese!

This recipe was really delicious and rich-tasting. It made me think it was a healthier version of a carbonara--no cream, but you still got the delicious pancetta/cheese, with some veggies thrown in. I'll definitely make again.

Serves 4?! Four hungry football players, maybe. We got about 6 servings out of it. Get good pancetta and it will nicely permeate the whole dish.

i gave this recipe two forks because each individual component of the dish was tasty but unfortunately there was nothing binding it together. I think if i were to attempt it a second time I would add some cream to the onion mixture and stir in the parmesan. I would fry the bacon ( i did not have pancetta) and set it aside to sprinkle on the completed dish (mixing it in created soggy bacon pieces). Also, i found the blanching and prep work to be very time consuming without a great deal of reward. so 2 forks for tasty ingredients that just werent combined in the best way.

I liked this recipe better when it was served hot. I made this for a picnic. Much better hot with lots of cheese. The combination of the hot oil with the cheese is great. When it cooled the cheese didn't stick the same way. Also the pasta was tossed and then lost most of the cheese. Would definitely make again since the flavor was good, just need to add more cheese and toss when hot to completely coat the pasta. I also think I might have added one clove of garlic. Definitely a good baseline for a start, but I think this dish could be even better with some small touches. Oh, I did neglect to say I added some fresh chopped parsley for garnish and for taste. Definitely worth doing. Keep on experimenting!

Absolutely wonderful. Everyone loved it; kids and adults alike. Will make it again! Many times.

This is one of those recipes you can make year around and depending on what you are serving with them, you can serve hot or cold. Very colorful, and the texture varies just enough. I was too lazy to pop over to the meat market, so I just used bacon and it tasted very good. I also left my beans whole instead of cutting them in half, but everything turned out nicely! Good leftovers too!

very good and very easy. By the way, cook from Chicago, I suggest you read the list of ingredients again! The shallots are listed just above the pasta.
