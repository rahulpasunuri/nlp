This is a surprisingly good recipe. After reading the reviews I cheated and used French's Fried Onions from the can. I really liked the butter and worcestershire in the beans and the fried onions made it!

This was great. It turns a healthy vegetable into a comfort food! Took a bit longer than expected to make...the frying is a bit of an ordeal, and the flour didn't really stick to the onions, so I dipped em in egg first, and that worked.

This is a simple, yet tasty dish. I fried the onion rings until they were very crisp, and steamed the green beans longer because I prefer more tender green beans.
