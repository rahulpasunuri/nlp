It's true. This recipe does make very heavy - literally - cake, even after using cake flour (lighter than all purpose) and bakers sugar (fine sugar). The taste is ok with it's butter and vanilla flavors, but nothing to get really excited about. It certainly doesn't taste "french bakery" quality or, for that matter, "bakery" quality. Use a different recipe...this one's not worth the ingrediants or time spent.

I did not make the cake, just the frosting.It is a good idea for a great frosting. It reminds me of a seven minute frosting that I loved as a kid. Next time I would use less butter though. It kind of tastes like you are eating sweetened butter with the amount called for in the recipe. I like the fact that it is really light and not overly sweet so I will make it again with a few changes.

I really enjoyed this cake, as did the person I made it for! I made it with cake flour and baking sugar, as I was worried it might be too dense, but as it turns out, the texture was a lot like a pound cake. I topped it with a whipped frosting as buttercream would just be too heavy for this. I definitely will make this again, perhaps with a layer of cream or jam between the layers. I baked this in two eight inch round pans. The cooking time was about 40 minutes for me; YMMV. The frosting was white chocolate ganache whipped up with more cream and topped with toasted coconut and raspberries and went perfectly with the cake! The guy I made this for said it was like something you'd purchase out of an expensive French bakery, and I have to agree. It's divine, but you have to know how to make it.

I made this recipe's frosting and it dissolved at room temperature and ruined my cake. Not sure if it was the egg whites (which I have discovered are not in many buttercream frosting recipes), but I wouldn't make it again.

This is a horrible recipe. Very dense. I'm sure you could build a whole tower as the cake is heavy, (like a brick). I make it into a 9 inch cake, and cupcake, neither are good. The cake is so dry that the cupcake papers rip the whole cupcake apart. I'm going to toss all and start again with a new recipe, as it's for my daughter's 3rd birthday.

has anyone tried this? Does it need All Purpose flour or Cake and Pastry?
