Made this as is, and it was Ok, and had a good amount of leftovers. Then had the rest the next day...a huge improvement. I recommend that you make the sauce the day before to let the flavors marry.

ddn't have celery or bacon so added about 2 cups carrots which was a little too much but gave a sweet taste which was nice, subsituted ground turkey and thought it wouldn't cook well with the vegs in the pan but ended up in nice big chunks which we liked. simmered 3 hours and finally reduced. will try next time with the missing ingredients--still add 1 cup carrots (chopped in food processor) and maybe 1 TBS tom paste. really tasty!!

Marvelous recipe and oh so tasty. I followed to the letter with a few exceptions. I added 1 cup shredded carrots. I doubled bacon, but cooked separately. Added cooked bacon plus about 3 tbsp. of bacon drippings to pot. Entire family plus small child devoured their dinner.

I really liked this recipe! I only had beef in the refridge so thats what i used. I also cut the ingredients in half-added 1 carrot chopped plus Italian seasoning blend to the sauce. It made enough for the whole family -6 of us! Served it over home made pasta,garlic bread and salad~ family wants it next week for supper too! It's easy and gives me plenty of time for the pasta!

Great recipe. Cooked for 8 hours on low in the slowcooker. Didn't have enough pork, so added ground beef with the veal what pork I had. Used bacon instead of pancetta (recession special). I added a little over a cup of red wine, but I should have added white. Also, dropped about a 1.5 tbs of tomato paste and would cut down on the amount of peeled tomatoes, next time. Added heavy cream in place of a portion of the milk. Sprinkled nutmeg in there, too.

I was inspired to try this Mario Batali recipe after eating at Babbo. Based on the comments from previous reviewers, I added 2 chopped carrots, used only 1.3lbs of lean ground beef (instead of the veal & pork combo) & used only 1/8 cup of olive oil. Simmered for over 2 hours. It was fabulous.

For what this is, and there are many recipes very similar to it, it is very good. Like some reviewers I added carrots, used less thyme (1 tsp) and added oregano and basil to taste and tomato paste (1 small can). I also cooked the bacon first and drained the fat and reserved the cooked bacon and added it with the tomatoes. I used lean beef as well to cut down on the fat...I am sure not a problem since the bacon is there giving it that extra flavor. This is a very traditional bolognese recipe and I am sure that there are even more variations, but I have to say it is very good and that I will certainly use it as a standard and make it again.

This was great. Made a ton of food... I was eating leftovers all week! I used angel hair instead, and next time I might add a little tomato sauce. http://megan-deliciousdishings.blogspot.com/2008/12/fettuccine-bolognese-or-rather.html

This recipe is a winner. My changes to the recipe include: adding tomato paste and carrots, using ground lamb instead of veal/pork, and serving the bolognese over spinach egg fettuccine instead of regular fettuccine. I agree with the comments that the longer you simmer, the better the taste.

Used what I had on hand and it turned out delicious and healthy! Had no bacon or celery. Used 2lb ground turkey, lowfat milk; 14 oz stewed italian-style tomatoes, 12 oz paste (made it thicken up beautifully in only an hour and not taste acidic at all; also had NO fat to skim). Added bay leaf, oregano. Served it on whole wheat fettucine. YUM!

Rating: 4
I cheated quite a bit but the changes still worked. I switched 3/4 pound of lean hamburger for the 1 pound of veal. And 3/4 pound sweet turkey sausage for the 1 pound of ground pork to make it lower in fat. I also just passed the parmesan so people could go without if wanted. Those small changes made the dish a lot lower in fat, and it was still amazing. I only used 2 teaspoons of dried thyme but I don't think the other 1/2 would have hurt. Will definitely make this again. Everyone loved it.

This is a beautiful bolognese. Using suggestions from the reviews below, I simmered for 2 hours (makes a huge difference - takes that long to come together), reduced the thyme and added other herbs (all to taste - this is a very flexible recipe that way), used ground beef instead of veal, and over the course of cooking added about 3/4 can of tomato paste to increase the rich tomato flavor. The result was delicious.

Rating: 4
This recipe is awesome, but to make it absolutely perfect you need to simmer it for at least 2 hours (3 is better) so that the sauce is not runny and the flavors blend completely. Then, don't eat it until the next day: Leave it overnight half-covered at room temperature and reheat it the next day. And if you're like me and prefer decadently rich flavors, do the following, but only if you're willing to simmer for 3 hours: 1) Add 2 chicken livers, 2) Double the pancetta, 3) Substitute the milk with heavy whipping cream, 4) Add a small can of tomato paste. Have fun!

We thought this was delicious. We just reheated leftovers from the freezer tonight and it was better than it was two weeks ago. Based on reviews here I cut the thyme in half and I'm glad I did. I also drained the fat, because I watch my fat intake (obviously not TOO closely). The one thing I would do differently next time is to crisp the bacon first, remove it with a slotted spoon and add it back in later.

My FAVORITE Bolognese!

Rating: 4
When in Italy, I have found that many of my most favorite dishes vary from what I have eaten elsewhere in Italy. Many of these dishes vary within the same city, restaurant by restaurant. Ragu alla Bolognese is a perfect example. I've eaten it in Bologna and elsewhere in Emilia-Romagna, many times. It has been made with beef & pork, rabbit, with and without pancetta and even with chicken livers added. The city is so fanatical about its food culture that they have a formal standard for their Ragu and even for the dimensions of their pasta. All of that said, this recipe, when properly prepared and with the correct ingredients used, gives a very good representation of a basic Ragu Bolognese. The proportions (2 1/4 lbs of meat) will be enough for 6 to 8 people if used as a pasta course. The cooking time detailed in the recipe should be used as a minimum time. This dish improves as it is cooked longer and especially when it is reheated. When prepared properly it will be ground meat sauce with some small diced vegetables and very little liquid.

Please, somebody, correct me if I am wrong! A bolognese sauce is a meat sauce with tomatoes, not a tomatoe sauce with meat! I do agree however, alter the dish to your tastes!

Great recipe to make one's own. The sauce was tasty but runny so I added 1-2 cans tomato paste, a tsp. of baking soda (cuts the acidity), a generous splash of vodka, a dash of oregano, parsley, basil while deleting thyme altogether. I substituted ground beef for the pork/veal and added a pound of sweet Italian sausage (casings removed) that I crumbled and browned with the beef. My husband and son have been enjoying my famous home-made spaghetti sauce for 31 years yet they raved about this new recipe. Thanks for teaching this old dog a new trick or two!

The basic recipe is good, but I agree on the thyme - I cut it in half. I couldn't find ground pork, so substituted with ground round (15%) & 3 links hot italian sausage (skin removed). I added approx 10 chopped crimini mushrooms, 1/2 red bell pepper, 3/4 cup red wine, 1/2 tsp dried basil & 1 fresh tomatoe. The result was a flavorful dish, with a hint of spice (probably from the sausage). This will be my bolognese recipe of choice in the future!

This is a great recipe. I do make very small changes, such as I use 1/4 cup celery and 1/4 cup carrots, and I use a little less oil and add butter for some more flavor, and I add a splash of wine, white or red, whichever I have on hand. Sometimes all I have is ground beef and bacon, that works too, just use good quailty bacon. It is alter-able, but don't stray too far, it's perfect as it's written too. Impresses EVERYONE!

I used only 1 tsp. of thyme and it was still too overpowering. My husband and I both grew up with authentic Italian food, and both of us felt this was too bland. The garlic, onions and pancetta (all of which should be flavorful) were not noticable at all. I also added tomato paste, lots of salt & pepper and parmesan cheese for flavor. I will make this again but add more pancetta, much more garlic & italian seasonings, with very little or no thyme. Also, the meat could be anything --- there was no distinct veal or pork flavor in this dish.

Rating: 3
Serves 4 if they eat like Mario Batali; serves 6 or more normal people. A bit heavy on the thyme; if I made it again I'd cut back on the thyme and add some basil and oregano (perhaps that makes in not authentically Bolognese, but whatever).

I used vegetarian bacon and veggie "meat" crumbles and it was STILL great! (and a lot quicker). I know it is probably incomparable with the original ingredients, but what can I say, I am ruled by a mob of rabid vegetarians!

The best part about this recipe is that you can go without several of the ingredients and still have an excellent sauce. I didn't use carrots or celery and i only used beef. I also added some pasta water at the end. The longer it cooks, the better.

I added mushrooms to the onion celery satute. I also had to cook the sauce a lot longer in order fot it to reduce. It was very meaty, and near the end of the cooking process I added about 3/4 cup of jarred red sauce to make it saucier. I made it last night, and am excited to try it today as I think it might be better the second day around.

Bottle it! Is what my husband said. Wonderful recipe after adjustments were made.

On his FoodTV cooking show, Mario uses "brodo" or dark roasted chicken stock. I substituted a commercial glace for the stock and got a much heartier, deeper flavor. I've also subtituted fresh tomatoes and crushed tomatoes, and both worked great.

I made this again adding more garlic and adding basil, oregano, red wine and more milk and cutting down on the broth. I also added some chopped carrots. Better than the first time I made it. I will add some tomatoe paste next time to add a little bit more flavor. A great base to play with.

Excellent. I substituted game: Red Stag (similar to venison) hamburger for the veal, and sweet sausage made from Boar for the pork - I skipped the bacon. I also added 3/4 cup of milk after the meat browned and allowed it cook down before adding the stock and tomatoes. I also added 1/2 cup of Ravenswood Red Zinfandel (served this with the meal). Cooked for 1 1/2 hours. No gamey taste. Wonderful flavor. It is meaty, so if you don't like this, add more stock. Superb!

My husband and I have made this several times and for the life of me cannot figure out why anyone would rate it poorly! We LOVE this recipe! The only thing we have done differently is add a few more herbs. If you don't like that much meat - don't add so much meat. If it doesn't have enough flavor - add some. Be creative - it's YOUR kitchen!

great sauce. I used one 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes w/ puree and one 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes in juice. The simmer time for the right thickness was 1hr, 45min. I added 2-3 tsps red pepper flakes and 1/4 cup fresh basil. YUMMMMY Will use less meat next time and add sausage chunks for variety.

Fantastic!! I added 1 lb of beef with the pork and veal. I also added twice the garlic. This sauce definitely needs to cook down for at least 2 hrs if not more. Add the broth in slowly. Let some cook out and then add the rest otherwise it'll get too watery. Buon Appetito!

We really liked this. Unfortunately, couldn't find ground veal at our local grocery store so just used ground sirloin w/the ground pork. It was still great. Yes, lots of fat. I drained the meat halfway through and then again at the end. I dumped the whole can of broth into the sauce but should have only added 1.5 cups and gradually added later if needed. I will take advice from reviewers here and cook a bit longer for a thicker sauce next time. Very tasty for a weekday meal!

Rating: 4
This was excellent, but patience is required! The "cook down" time is definitely 2.5 hours or more. I was very careful about skimming all of the fat. I'd also recommend adding 3/4 cup finely chopped carrots, you won't taste them as such, but they add some depth. I also added about a cup of canned tomato sause after the sauce had been cooking for about 1 3/4 hours. This is very tasty, and won't disappoint!

Rating: 3
I'm really puzzled by the negative reviews. I made this last night and it was fantastic! (although I'll agree that it does take about 2 1/2 hours to thicken - maybe the dissatisfied cooks served it before it had "finished' cooking)It was very flavorful and not any "fattier" than any meat ragu I've had. I did use the pancetta and looked for a lean cut - maybe that made the difference. It also makes a ton - definitely enough for 6-8. I actually used the thick leftover sauce as a meat layer for lasagne - my family said it was the best I'd ever made.

I also add my confusion as to some of the other reviews. I found this to be a terrific recipe, and have made it twice in the last month. I did have some changes that I would like to pass on. I reduced the veal and pork ingrediatens by half, and made up the difference with mild Italian sausage. I also added a cup of chopped carrots and a good bit of other aromatics including Italian parsley and basil. Be patient while it cooks down, which takes at least 2.5 hours.

The ultimate comfort food. Definitely use the pancetta; it gives wonderful flavor. I followed the recipe as written, except that I put the tomatoes through a food mill before adding them into the sauce, to give a nice smoother texture. I also used wider pappardelle noodles, which held the sauce wonderfully. Try it!
