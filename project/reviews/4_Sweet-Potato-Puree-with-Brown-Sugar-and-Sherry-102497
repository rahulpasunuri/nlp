Awesome. Instead of sherry, I used whiskey, and will cut back on the butter next time. Licked the mixer bowl!!

Simple is good in this case. I cut back on the brown sugar and the margarine (instead of butter) and increased the Sherry just a little, skipped the red skinned sweet potatoes (couldn't find) and it was great! Will definitely make again.

Loved this recipe last year, as did my whole family. It reminded everyone of my grandma's thanksgiving sweet potatoes ... but without the marshmallows. You can cut the butter way down, though. Less than half, even. And I'm no wimp when it comes to butter. But 10+ tablespoons per 2 lbs of potatoes seemed really excessive. They were delicious with about a quarter of the recommended butter.

I thought this was just good. Perhaps I am just not a fan of sweet sweet potatoes. My favorite sweet potato recipe so far has been sweet potatoes with chipotle cream. This was just ok to me (but some of the guests loved it)

Served these with the chile-garlic shrimp. What a wonderful pairing. My wife and I will definetly be doing this again!!

WOW - Easy and delicious! I only used 1/2 the butter, less sugar and 3tbs dry Sherry. Very good, even by my family's standards - they love candied yams, which I find too sweet for my taste. Now, I have a way to enjoy a great veggie with my family. This is a keeper.

Love the addition of sherry. Too much butter, though--I started out with less than half that, and thought it was just rich enough that way.

I will definitely hang on to this recipe. It came out a little too thick at first so I added a little water and cream and processed again. Will keep for future!

I made these on Thanksgiving this year, and we really liked them. They are easy, and different, a bit elegant. I used less butter and sherry, and they were still just delicious. This recipe is a keeper, especially since they're so easy!

Ridiculously good for so little effort. Used cream instead of sherry (for kids), and it was too rich/sweet. MANY THANKS for the GREAT TIP from SHALOMCHARLOTTE from CHARLOTTE to add a pinch of granulated garlic to balance the sweetness. Perfect!

I am a huge fan of this recipe! We have used Captain Morgan's Private Stock Rum instead of sherry, and that works very well. I've been asked for the recipe each time I've made it, and definitely plan to continue making it.

This was ridiculously easy and delicious. Like other reviewers, I also substituted coconut rum for the sherry. Outstanding.

This recipe probably doesn't need another 4 fork review, but it was absolutely wonderful! I'm not sure if the brand of sherry matters, but I used Osborne's Manzanilla.

My mother made this dish when I was growing up, and it was always a favorite. I made it for my husband on our first Thanksgiving alone together, and he said it was the highlight of the meal. I reduced the butter by a few tablespoons (though I might not have done so if I had prepared it for guests) and sprinkled toasted pecans on top. The level of sweetness is perfect, as is the amount of sherry. I'll definitely make this again next Thanksgiving.

I've been making this recipe for Thanksgiving for at least 7 years or so now. It's always a big hit! Very easy to make, and the sherry gives it that little festive kick. It's a keeper.

Served this with ham for a small Easter dinner party. I used rum (Malibu!) instead, like someone suggested. 'Twas a big hit. Best part is that there is enough left over (there were only 4 of us) to make sweet potato gnocchi tonight! Yum!

They were the highlight of Thanksgiving dinner. The next year somebody brought a dish of their "famous" sweet potatoes that just could not touch the awesomeness of this recipe. I added more brown sugar and butter to the recipe because let's face it, extra sugar and butter = tastes awesomer.

I made it without the Sherry and it was just as delicious! You really can't go wrong with sweet potatoes.

Nothing special. Tasted just like sweet potato with nothing added.

I served this dish to about 20 people at a Passover seder. I made a modification suggested by another reviewer, using rum instead of sherry, and the guests were very happy (and kept asking for the recipe). With the rum, and a very fine puree, it develops an almost desert-like character. Not bad for a vegetable...

This recipe is good but I have it perfected. First, who has 55 minutes to bake. I micro-ed my sweet potatoes. And just a pinch of granulated garlic to balance the sweetness. Yum!

i enjoyed this recipe but it needs some modifications, etc. i would suggest not skinning the sweet potatoes first. it's easier to get the good stuff out if you don't. be sure and buy extra because after all the skinning you are likely to lose a lot. i did like this recipe but i wasn't blown away by it. also, you can probably get away with half the butter it calls for at the mixing stage.

This is so easy and good. Making it a second time for Christmas. Even people who don't like sweet potatoes like this. The sherry gives it a very nice sophisticated flavor.

While I liked the basic recipe, it seemed to lack something. I then boiled some currants for about two minutes to plump them up and added them to the puree. The texture of the currants offset the puree nicely and their slightly tart sweetness went well with the nutty flavor of the sherry.

Very good, but prefer other sweet potato/yam recipes.

I was amazed at how good these were considering the ease of preparation and few ingredients. In the past I've spent much more time and effort on sweet potatoes than I did on these. This dish got rave reviews at my annual Thanksgiving dinner. Guests said they liked these far more than what I usually make, so my search for the perfect sweet potato dish has ended. I piped these into orange cups for a beautiful presentation. The oranges added a subtle hint of flavor during baking.

This was a great dish. Very simple and very tasty. Just the right amount of sweetness. I made this with a fennel and mustard pork tenderloin. I would definately make this again.

I made this for a family get together yesterday. I was in a big hurry when I read the recipe and mistook the "tan skinned sweet potatoes" for "tanned skinned potatoes." Having just read about how to achieve perfectly fluffy mashed potatoes in "Cooks Country Magazine" I picked russet potatoes at the store. When I got home I realized my error. I just forged ahead and made this with half red skinned sweet potatoes and half russet potatoes. The result was delectable. I too skipped the mixer and had my six year old neice mash them. The kiddies disliked them, but the adults were well satisfied. I received several compliments on the light and fluffy texture and the lumps of white potato. I'll probably never make this the "right" way. It was just too good the wrong way.

This was delicious, but a bit on the gluey side. Could use a bit more sherry as well.

This is absolutely delicious. I made the sweet potatoes the night before and then took the advice of another reviewer and cooked on the stovetop a mixture of pecans, brown sugar, sherry and butter to top the sweet potatoes, reheated it in the oven and it turned out great. Will definitely make for Thanksgiving again next year.

Great! I love the dark roasted flavor of the potatoes! They are not too sweet, and the sherry definitely adds a nice taste. A sophisticated spin on an old favorite!

Absolutely wonderful. I don't know about that previous lady that added all those spices -- she must not like sweet potatoes. This is for all those that like a good baked sweet potato maybe with just some butter. Their true flavor really comes through and the sherry adds an intriguing note. I am going to make again this weekend for a dinner party. Dont' worry if you don't have both kinds of potatoes -- either will do.

This recipe was very bland. I would not make it again. In order to make it edible I added Kahlua, brown sugar, nutmeg, cardamon, cinnamon, and allspice.

I made this side-dish for Thanksgiving with my girlfriend's parents a couple of years ago, and its quickly become tradition. Now I'm expected to bring it every year, and it's usually finished off that night. I do add a little more sherry each year - maybe that's why they're warming up to me so nicely.

I've never cared for sweet potatoes; however, I really liked this recipe. Mixing the tan-skinned and red-skinned gives it a more subtle flavor and adding the sherry makes it sublime! My husband, who grew up on the traditional sweet potato and marshmallow dish, didn't like these as well. There is a definite difference!

This is a great recipe for the holidays. I used Cream Sherry and doubled the amount in the recipe. I also doubled the brown sugar. After the potatoes had everything mixed in, I put them in a dish and topped them with a butter, brown sugar, pecan mixture and baked. MMMmmm

I liked this recipe a lot-I had some sweet potatoes laying around, so I decided to make this for fun. I didn't have golden brown sugar, so I substituted dark brown sugar. Next time I'll probably use a little less sherry (a tad overpowering) and maybe a bit more butter. Otherwise, it was fantastic!

Decadence! I used a potato masher instead of a mixer and the potatoes turned out rich and creamy with a little bit of texture.
