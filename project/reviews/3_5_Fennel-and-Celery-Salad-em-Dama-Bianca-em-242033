Loved this recipe, so fresh, crunchy, and tasty. Used burrata but will use other cheese nxt time, probably parmesan shavings.

Forgot to mention in my earlier review. After making this a number of times, I now reduce the olive oil from 6T to 5T.

I make this all the time. One of my favorites. I use Burrata cheese, but think it is fine without any cheese. Ingredient list is a little weird. Why isn't 1/4 t pepper listed? Instead of 1/2 T grated lemon zest why not zest of one Lemon?

Booring tastes al together. No wow-experience here.

Oh my lord, maybe 4 forks seems a bit much for such a simple little salad, but I eat the leftovers right out of the container in the fridge, salivating like a big old dog. Used honey goat cheese and threw in a bit of tarragon and a bit more of Italian Parsley. Is incredible the next day after the flavors marry a bit!

This was good, but not exquisite. It will be a great option in the winter when fresh salad makings are hard to find, but no substitute for summer tomatoes, strawberries, etc. I served it to a dinner group and it was well-received.

This is the best! Wonderful flavors, easy to make. A good winter salad, when tomatoes aren't available.

Perfect salad any time of year. Made one change: goat cheese. Even better. I also love the name.

So simple and tasty. I did add buffalo mozzarella, but as other reviewers have stated; it is not necessary. Great recipe!

This is one of my favorite salads. I definitely prefer it without the mozzarella, despite the fact that I love cheese. I've made it with different fresh herbs tossed in...my favorites are flat-leaf italian parsley or cilantro.

Can I give this recipe 5 forks? Excellent dish. I've made it several times and I've noticed it is even better the next day because the flavors mingle. Beautiful presentation, too.

Delicious and easy!

Fabulous. Easy, crisp, and fresh. This would be perfect outside on a hot summer day. The fennel and celery stand up beautifully to the dressing - it was still crisp two days later.

I am not usually a fan of fennel. This was fresh and delicious. Instead of mozzarella I used asadero cheese which has a similar taste.

Delicious combination! Light summer salad. I didn't change a thing, not necessary.

Good flavors and good crunch.

Light and refreshing. I used one fennel bulb instead of two, only 1/4 cup olive oil, and instead of the cheese I added about 1/3 cup of pine nuts. I made it a day in advance, adding the pine nuts just before serving.
