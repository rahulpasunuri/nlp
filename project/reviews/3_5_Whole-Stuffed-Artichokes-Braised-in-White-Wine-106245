These artichokes were fantastic. It's a pain to prep them, so make sure you allow yourself a little extra time. I have a pair of needle nose pliers that I keep in the kitchen for such things. Then I can rip out the the spiky inner leave without getting poked. I browned two bone-in chicken breasts while I was prepping the artichokes, then I deglazed the pan with stock and placed the artichokes and chicken back in the pan. I pulled the meat off the bones and served it in wide bowls with a little penne and the braising liquid with the artichoke resting on top. It made it kind of a two course dinner in one bowl - artichokes and then hearty soup. Plus the some of the filling falls into the broth making it even better. I had a lot of extra stuffing because my artichokes where small so I saved it to stuff grilled portobellos with.

These came out pretty delicious. The flavors and the ingredients are perfect for stuffed artichokes, and my Italian family loved them even though they usually eat them differently. When making these, though, you need to have the technique down. I tried to make a bunch of them for Christmas Eve dinner and it's a bit difficult - so start with four and master the technique before trying to make a tray of these.

I had never tried to braise an artichoke, so just reading the instructions was a bit intimidating. But I found a great blog post that follows this exact recipe with step by step photos. Sucah a big help! http://thenoshery.com/2011/02/28/stuffed-artichoke-braised-in-white-wine/ enjoy!

Did I mention I just love this recipe? This is the 4th time and it's my favorite. I chopped up about 2 tsp of toasted pignola nuts and very subtly, it added another layer of flavor. And I agree with the cook from my hometown of Brooklyn, use 2 slices of provolone!

I've made this about 4 times now and it's one of those meals I can't stop thinking about when I know I'm gonna eat it for dinner later. When I first started making this I was vegetarian so I substituted Tofurkey brand Italian Sausage links for the sopressata and it's soooo delicious I can't imagine not stuffing it with that!! I just heat up 1 link (for 2 artichokes) in the skillet and then chop it up and mix it with the bread crumbs, etc. I always use Panko and no regrets. Oh and um...obviously you should use TWO slices of Provolone on each choke!! Whenever I make this for 2 ppl I halve the stuffing ingredients but not the braising ingredients. I may have poked my fingers a few times taking out the slightly spikey purple leaves but I have a tip! Position your fingers inside the choke so you're grabbing at the leaves on the sides of them, not with one finger in front and the other in back. make sense? oh whatever just make this! it's beyond worth it!!!

This was the first time I prepared artichokes, and will admit it was a bit challenging, especially taking out the chokes. Only changes - used peppered salami instead of Sopressata and added more Parm cheese. I used the whole recipe for two huge artichokes. The sauce actually didn't need reducing at th end, though I might blend it smooth next time. Very good!

There were some gorgeous 'chokes in our local produce market (Yes, in Feb) so I decided to make this dish again for an easy comforting light supper. This recipe has never let me down. I didn't add the sausage this time and it still works. We had that garlic bread ready and were completely content.

Definitely yummy, and as others have said, a LOT of work, and super messy! I tried steaming the artichokes for about 15 min first to remove the choke more easily, and it either made it harder, or I did something wrong (or it really IS that difficult!). Sadly, I had to use pre-made bread crumbs & dried parsley (all I had), so I'm sure it would have been even better with fresh. Used bacon in one artichoke & none in the other-- would love to try it with the real stuff next time. Also, I reduced the broth at the end & added butter-- it was AMAZING! I would drizzle it on top of the finished product next time. I wondered if it would be better if it were baked, to keep the bread crumbs crispier (rather than steamed)?. Either way, it was yummy & hearty-- almost a meal on it's own!

A local restaurant had something similar on their "specials" board. It was divine so I promised to figure out how to make them. Except for adding some lemon juice and oregano and using chicken broth instead of wine, this is the artichoke they served. Grab the garlic bread and mangia. The most effort was in cleaning the choke but besides that, it was time well spent. The house smelled so good. Just one thought: if you think artichokes are a lot of work to eat them, then why eat them at all?

Depending on the size of your artichokes, this and a salad could easily be an entire meal. I've made this twice and both times were delicious. Frist time used bacon instead of sopresatta, second time used pancetta. Both were great substitutions. Make sure you have time to do this one as it takes a lot of prep time, but the result is well worth it. I used a regular pot as i don't own a pressure cooker, and would suggest going for the crumbs from a french bread loaf. I used packaged bread crumbs the second time and it just wasn't as good.

Hated it. I've eaten artichoken on several continents since I was a kid growing up in CA and they became my favorite vegetable...this recipe was totally not worth the time (and I'm all about fine, detailed cooking). The breadcrumbs turned to a pasty mush, there was not enough sizzle or contrast in the flavors and it took way too long for the results. My family all agreed, although they didn't understand why I would want to spend the time to review for others :) A great and FAST artichoke sauce is 1/2 C mayo, 1 T Tamari (aged Soy Sauce), 1 tsp Chilli Garlic Sauce (get at Asian Markets - distinctively red and hot) and 2 T fresh lemon juice. Stir together, dip the leaves and it's great. I'm guess the quantities here, just check that the chilli garlic sauce isn't TOO hot to overpower. Blessings!

These were wonderful, and really not as much trouble as you would think. I used a standard stock pot to cook them in instead of a pressure cooker, and the long cooking time afforded me a chance to clean up a bit, work on a side dish, and have a glass of wine - and the artichokes didn't suffer at all. The finished product is a very attractive, exceptionally tasty dish. Changes I made: I left out the sopresatta to make it more vegetarian friendly. I served these with some roast garlic mashed potatoes, and made a sauce (for the plate - not the artichokes) out of the cooking broth by straining and reducing it until thickened. The extra effort of trimming the artichoke and cutting the choke out is more than recouped in the eating of the dish. Much easier when picking it apart to not have to worry about all those little purple leaves.

We love these. I prepare them exactly as written but do not add the provolone while cooking in the pressure cooker. After they are finished, I open the lid and add the slice of provolone on top of each and return the lid for about 5 min, without pressure just steam and no more heat. They are a little messy to eat but oh so good. The best I have ever tasted. This is the only recipe for these I will use from now on.

First you spend all that time and trouble cleaning the artichokes, then more time and trouble to eat them. Once I've spent the time preparing it, I would rather it weren't so much work to eat. Besides, I thought the garlic and sopprasetta overwhelmed the more subtle artichoke flavor.

These were excellent! I loved the stuffing. I would definitely make these again. Just make sure you use decent enough wine!

This is the best stuffed artichoke I have had. I used an electric pressure cooker, a 'must have', and par cooked the artichkes for 5 minutes, removed them to a cool water bath with lemon juice and after they cooled removed the inner tough leaves and choke easily. Then I just stuffed the artichokes, cooked them the rest in the pressure cooker, and they were perfect. Rave reviews!

Very good, especially the slices of provolone at the end, but cleaning the artichokes was not worth the work to me. It was my first time preparing artichokes so I assume it took me way longer than most. I'll just order them out thank you :)

A great variation on the standard artichoke. I wouldn't bother putting the stuffing in between the outer leaves the next time around though. It's nice to have a few plain leaves, as the stuffing tends to overpower the artichoke flavor. Easy to prepare, only took 30 minutes start to finish with the aid of a food processor and a pressure cooker!

This is a great recipe. The simmering liquid imparts a wonderful flavor to the outside leaves. The stuffing is moist and has a nice texture and flavor. I usually remove the outside, first two rows of leaves from the bottom of the artichoke because they stay tough no matter how long they simmer. Just pull each leaf back until it snaps off at it's base. If you like artichokes, try this recipe!

For someone that never made an artichoke before, these came out great. I did leave in a little too long and I didn't add more wine liquid but they were great.

This dish was *extremely* yummy-- and very unique compared to my usual simple steamed artichoke with lemon butter sauce.... in fact, this was an emtire meal-- just served it up with a simple greens salad, and VOILA! For the next go-around, I may try to add less olive oil, since there is already enough flavor/moisture in the parm, provolone, soprosetta, garlic, etc....

Made this as a side dish with leg of lamb and it got raves. My only comment is that it was probably too heavy to accompany a big meat dish, but it's definitely a great vegetarian entrees (sans ham, of course) or would be great with soup or a big salad.

Absolutely delicious. Depending on how much stuffing you put in each artichoke, you could make a light meal out of these. Highly recommended for anyone that likes artichokes.

Haven't tried this yet, but sounds good. However, I think I'll trim the artichokes leaving only pale leaves so that the whole thing can be eaten; the photo looks very pretty, but prepared this way the leaves are not meant to be eaten & I don't want to struggle with tough bits when I eat.

I assumed that because this was a magazine feature this month that artichokes would be in season... my market had tough and expensive ones. For reasons unknown the leaves and "meat" remained tough even after 1.5 hrs of braising. A mystery. The stuffing was delectable - saving the dish.
