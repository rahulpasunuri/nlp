I made this using the proportions as written, but instead of chopping/processing the vegetables I coarsely grated everything (except the scallions, which I chopped). The texture and flavor were great -- slightly lighter, brighter, and softer than my family's traditional potato kugel.

One of my guests for our Passover Seder made this kugel. It was delicious and was a perfect, flavorful accompaniment to our meal. I will definitely make this again and again.

I hought this receipie was pretty good. However, when you puree everything, the consistancy of the dish is rather mushy. Next time, I am going to puree only half the veggies, leaving in big pieces of carrot, zucchini and potato. Alternatively, I may use slice mushrooms and asparagus with a bit of guerre cheese.

Yuk -I made this per the recipe. A lot of work for very little return. I would not waste my time or the ingredients again. It was very bland and I was embarassed to serve it to my Passover guests. There's got to be better recipes out there.

4 forks BUT with a major change: don't add the zucchini & carrots! i made this the first time for passover & thought the veggies just diluted the flavor. this time i made it w/o both & increased the potatoes to about 3-3 1/2 lbs. i used 4 eggs & only half the butter [in the pan to heat] & all other ingredients as listed. this was the best kugel i have ever made. for years i have been trying to find a recipe that tasted like my aunt's [whose recipe i unfortunately never got]. the onions & scallions give it a wonderful flavor. definitely a keeper!

Observing the concerns about blandness, I blithely made this anyway. I did saute the onions first and upped the bread/cracker crumbs. Then I added a bit more salt, twice the black pepper and at least 1 Tbsp. of curry powder. Yum. Serve with a dollop of plain yogurt and sprinkle of cilantro.

What a hit,everyone loved it. very airy and light the only thing that I changed is instead of Zucchini, I used a half of a butternut squash.

Lacks flavor and texture. Try something else.

Excellent for Passover. It could use more than 1 hour of baking time.

An update...It was a hit with an Indian guest at my Seder who felt the flavors were wonderful. My other guests thought it was overloaded with onions and scallions yet bland. I made it with the brisket on Thursday and reheated on Sat.I remove everything that I make from the original cooking dishes and then use baking sheets and oven safe china serving platters to reheat and go straight to the table on trivets. Some excellent suggestions from other cooks reviewing but ultimately I won't make this again. Everything did fine. I always make most recipes ahead so that flavors get to "marry" with the dish. I also freeze most everything too and reheat including matzo balls and soup and all my chicken dishes for Seder. I won't make this again but liked the suggestions for using other veggies instead and cooking the onions prior to adding to the mixture.

As is, this recipe was not worth all of the work (2-3 hours of peeling, chopping and processing). However, I will try it again with a few changes. First, I cut the onions in half (based on an earlier suggestion), and I think it was bland as a result. In the future, I will use 2 onions and no scallions. Second, I think I would use chopped broccoli or spinach next time instead of zucchini. It didn't add any flavor. I might add some red bell pepper, and a handful of fresh parsley or dill. Mine also overcooked on the sides and bottom; I suppose from the preheating of the pan. We gently reheated the next day, and that worked out fine. Not sure about freezing; if anyone has leftovers, please freeze them and let us know if it affects the consistency (sometimes potatos get mushy, but not always, e.g., latkes).

This was a huge hit at our seder. It cooked perfectly in an hour. The perimeter was burned slightly, but we like it that way. My husband who never remember to comment on the food I cook turned to me during dinner and said it was amazing. It reminded me of kugels my grandmother made when I was small.

Kudos on the Kugel! We all loved the taste, texture, and appearance of this lighter than usual potato pudding.I drained the final batter to cut back on the moisture. A real keeper for all year round.

Everyone at my seder said this was the best potato kugel they ever had. I made 1 1/2 batches, but used the original amount of onions and green onions. I also sauteed the onions until they were soft before adding them to give a more mellow onion flavor. I increased the matzah meal to 1 cup (per batch) and used half eggs and half eggbeaters. I used oil instead of margarine. I forgot to preheat the baking dish but it came out fine and reheated very well.

This was good, and I think the carrot and zucchini add a fresh, modern taste. It makes a lot, way more than eight servings. Heating and buttering (margarining?) the pan helped give it a crispy, delicious crust.

A nice change from the usual sweet matzah kugels. It's colorful, easy to make and lighter than potato kugel. !

I was disappointed with this recipe. The kugel came out burned on the sides and bottom. Does anyone know why? Was it because I mixed in only 2 Tbs oil, instead of the 1/4 cup called for (which would make it much too greasy)? It was also too salty, even tho I reduced the amount of salt. I used only a small zucchini and agree that it should be omitted; it added nothing to the dish.

This was good but I changed it a lot and need to do more work but the concept is great. I didn't use carrots or zucchini because I just wanted an onion potato flavor, though it was a little too oniony. I used 5 large eggs (not extra large or jumbo)and the kugel was not at all watery. I did bake in the morning, cool and cut into squares and rewarmed in oven on cookie sheet @350 for about 45min. I wanted to make the pieces more crispy and they were. Next time, I'll add a couple more potatoes , use less sweet onions and no scallions. I think with a bit of testing, it will be perfect, almost like a latke kugel. Great partner to the Merlot brisket.

I made one yesterday AM and again today AM for 2 seders. Came out perfectly, delicious, and just reheated it for 1 hour at 300. PERFECT-IT WAS A HIT

Sorry but this is not good! Much too watery & the zucchini & carrots just dilute the potato flavor rather than enhance it. The onions, scallions, s & p do add the right amount of spice so if you eliminate the zucchini & carrots & add a few extra potatoes [and dont over process!], I think this could probably be a great old fashion potato kugel! Heating the butter first produces the perfect crust.

I like your suggestions , cook from New Jersey, and will do it that way. I just made the Merlot brisket and will finish the sauce Friday. I hope it good!!

I really want to know about making it ahead and reheating as well. Actually that is what I'm planning on doing. I'll make and bake Saturday AM and reheat for the seder in the evening. I may not even refrigerate as it doesn't seem necessary. Anybody have experience with this?

This sounded like a wonderful recipe for Seder to go with the Merlot Brisket in the same issue which was awesome. I will make it again with 1 cup matzo meal and cut the scallions and onions in half too. I would also add more salt and pepper since it was bland and had too much onion flavor. I plan to reheat some cut into squares to brown it on all sides and make more crispy. I will also fry some in oil and see which method works better. I will definitely make this again with adjustments.

4/17/08 what about making this ahead and re-heating?

Do we have to boil the potatoes and carrots before blending in the food processor?

The recipe says "blend" in a food processor. I am not sure what setting that would be on mine. Did anyone use a blender?

this is an outstanding recipe. I cut down a little on the butter and did not add zucchini...doesn't matter. My family has told me it will not last until Passover and I will need to make 2 casseroles for the Seder. A real homerun!!!!

This is a good kugel recipe - perfect for Passover. It's lighter than regular potato kugel - because of the carrots and zuke and because the vegies are blended and not shredded. A word of warning - this makes a huge kugel and I had to use the prescribed rectangular pan and a smaller pan for spillover. Recommended.
