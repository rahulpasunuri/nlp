Coming from an Italian family I usually just make my mom's marinara. I wanted to try something different and was very happy with this recipe. It's super easy to make and I love how the carrot takes away the acidity of the tomatoes. The thyme is s nice touch, although I usually use about half of what the recipe calls for.

Way too much thyme. It was all we could tast it over whelmed the sauce.

This sauce is absolutely fabulous on its own over pasta or with meat or chicken. It is easy, quick, and has a bright, fresh flavor.

I make this mostly as written and find it makes a wonderful basic sauce for pasta, meat or pizza. I shred the onion and the carrot, and since I rarely have fresh thyme available, I use dried (about 1/2 T). I also sometimes add a few red pepper flakes, and some good tomato paste if I feel it needs it. I make it at least once a month!
