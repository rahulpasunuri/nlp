Delicious! Sweet, but not too sweet. I added almond (1/2 t), vanilla (1 t) , and coconut (2 t) extracts to the batter and a bit of coconut extract to the frosting. It had an intense coconut flavor and a light, but moist texture. Everyone raved that it was the best coconut cake they had ever eaten!

This is my most requested dessert. We are all health conscious up in the mountains, but when my friends want to splurge on something sweet, this is what they want. I make one and half times the frosting because following the recipe makes only enough to barely cover the cake. The frosting's awesome! Also, I sprinkle flaked coconut on the frosting between the layers.

Made this for a work potluck and everyone loved it except for me. As another reviewer remarked, the cake is dense and it doesn't have much of a coconut flavour. In fact, I thought it tasted more like baking soda. While I'm glad people liked it, I won't be making it again.

I am not a baker, and will never claim to be. I made this for my mother's birthday. It was really easy to make, and absolutely DELISH! it was sweet without being overly sweet. I will be making this again.

Made this cake for a dinner party and it practically evaporated. A huge hit, for sure! The cake came out dense, but I think this is due to working in someone else's kitchen, in which they did not own a mixer or beaters, so I did a lot of the beating by hand. I imagine that if I made this again with the proper equipment, the cake would be airier. Even as it was, people raved about it and it disappeared pretty quickly. I toasted the coconut to go on the outside and I'm so glad I did! It added a yummy flavor and a pleasing, crispy texture to the frosting. The frosting was super delicious, quite possibly the best I've ever made. I served this with fresh strawberries in a light syrup, which everyone enjoyed. This recipe is a keeper!

Has anyone tried reducing the sugar in the cake? The frosting already seems plenty sweet.

Once again I'm making the cake that never fails to delight. And at 8,200 ft above sea level! As to wine pairings, we suggest Deltetto Arneis Passito "Bric du Liun" from Canale, Italy. Toni Deltetto and his son Carlo do an amazing job creating this lovely not-too-sweet wine from 50% late harvest Arneis and 50% regular harvest. This wine goes beautifully with foie gras as well so have it on both sides of the dinner! Merry Christmas, all!

This cake was fantastic!!! We loved it!!! I used a butter cream frosting, however, and angel flake coconut all around. This will be my go to coconut cake from now on. I also minced the angel flake coconut in the cake a bit so as not to have strings of coconut when cutting.

I think I followed the recipe exactly as written, but perhaps I did something wrong. I did not find the cake airy and light, quite the opposite, and a little tough to cut into.

This is my husband's grandmother's recipe for what was called Italian Cream Cake in Texas in the early seventies-I must have made it thirty times and it is always a hit. I am going to make it for my own 65th birthday! Always toast the pecans!

The cake was a bit bland -- but I grated some orange peel into the frosting and it was very much enjoyed by all -- and I'll probably put it in the batter next time as well.

One more thing - SERVINGS. This made far more than 10 servings. 10 large servings were passed around at the dinner party (all gobbled up) and I had another 5 good-sized portions left over.

This cake is excellent. Followed recipe exactly as written and it came out perfect. Very light and airy cake if you keep everything at room temperature. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious cake. Will make it again - in about 3 days! I made it at 8,200 ft ASL and following advice of my pastry chef friends, I didn't change a thing. Perfect. Make sure you use a big enough bowl for the buttermilk/soda mixture that you don't end up with it spilling all over the counter. Should mix it not too long before using, but make sure the reaction is finished by the time you add it. Make sure ingredients are room temperature and that you remove the cake from the fridge at least an hour before serving.
