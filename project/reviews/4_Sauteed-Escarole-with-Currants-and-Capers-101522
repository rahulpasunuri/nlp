Very good recipe. We loved the sweet & savory combo. I used cranraisens which worked great. I also used chicken broth instead of water which gave the escarole more flavor. Will def make it again,

The pine nuts, currants and capers combo is a classic Sicilian treatment, and so delicious and easy. This is a staple in our household. I sometimes add some red onion and or hot pepper flakes.

I make this regularly, because it is one of my husband's favorite dishes. He always says that if you told him when he was 10 that greens would be one of his favorite dishes, he never would have believed it. I've made it with escarole, chard, spinach, probably mustard greens too. Usually I use dried cranberries or mixed dried berries because I don't have currants on hand. But I always use capers, garlic, and pine nuts. It can be a little bitter sometimes (probably when I use something other than escarole). But a nice healthy side.

This is a very good recipe. I had one head of escarole and used the rest of the ingredients as called for in this recipe. The results were delicious. Served the escarole with a seasoned pork loin roast. I will make this with all of the ingredients as called for in the recipe, but can't imagine the results being better than this time.
