Disappointed. The consistency was good, but they were very bland, as was the chive cream. My first attempt at latkes, so maybe they were ok, just not to my liking. I might try another recipe or just jazz this one up.

The batter held together very well,the key being to get as much water out as possible. I drained the batter in a fine sieve and pressed the water out using my fist, which seemed to work very well. My only complaint is that the porcini was very subtle. Next time I will add more to the batter. It is also very important to season the batter. I particularly liked the vinegar in the sour cream (I admit I used dairy sour cream), it gave it a little more zing - i'll be trying that trick with other dishes.

The combination of flavors here are exquisite! Make sure to the potatoes really get blended because large chucks of them made it more susceptible to fall apart. The porcini mushrooms were very expensive be so flavorful - best potato pancakes I've ever had!

Made this for Christmas dinner. Rave reviews. Only drawback was I did not make enough!
