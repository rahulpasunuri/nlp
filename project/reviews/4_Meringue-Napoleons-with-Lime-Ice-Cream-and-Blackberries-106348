I must confess I used a great store bought ice cream on this one. But the meringue squares turned out perfectly and I generously swirled a chocolate sauce over the top and sprinkled toasted slivered almonds over that. No one refused the dessert! ...but I guess this became my own recipe.

I followed this recipe for meringue because I had some left over egg whites from some baking over the weekend. The meringue turned out awesome! The texture was wonderful and so easy! I wanted to make it quick & easy because I was just trying to use up the egg whites... so I grabbed some heart shaped cookie cutters and used those!

This recipe is not only impressive but absolutely delicious and a fine compliment to any meal. I prepared this as dessert for an Easter Calebration and everyone enjoyed this masterpiece. It's worth the extra effort.

This recipe is definitely a labor of love. I followed this recipe except for the lime juice. I used Key Lime juice instead and lime essence since I didn't have fresh limes. If I do that again, I'm cutting back on the juice. But this was great, a nice variation of "Key Lime Pie" with the meringues and blackberry sauce.

absolutely one of my favorite desserts. the meringues are so light and can be served with a variety of fillings and toppings. i'd like to try making them with cocoa poweder!! and definitely make the leftovers into kisses!

Discard leftover meringue?! Never. Drop it in small mounds and bake for meringue kisses. Add mini choolate chips for a real treat.

Beautiful looking dessert and very tasty! I made round meringues with egg rounds as a guide - nice and easy. Lovely mix of flavours and colours.

Wow! What a crowd pleaser! Just don't tell your guests how easy it was to make. This is also a great recipe to get creative with -- change the flavors of the ice cream and change the berries. Or, sift in a little (1/4 c.) cocoa powder and make chocolate meringues. Then use espresso ice cream, or caramel ice cream!! The possibilities are only limited to your imagination!

I chose this recipe very carefully for a dinner party, and then found the blackberries at my grocery store to be rather limp. I found some strawberries that were fresher, and substituted strawberry soup and sliced strawberries for the blackberries and sauce, and vanilla ice cream for the lime. I punched up the flavor of the strawberies by adding some dried ones, but I think it will be even better when berries are at their peak. The meringues were wonderful, and the template worked well. We loved it.

Very easy to make and lovely presentation. I did not make the template, but made this free hand and it was not a problem. The lime ice cream was very good and rich.
