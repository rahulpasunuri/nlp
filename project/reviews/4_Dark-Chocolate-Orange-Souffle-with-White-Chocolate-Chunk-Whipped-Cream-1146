This recipe was delicious! The bitterseet chocolate and subtly orange flavor go together very well. We ran into only one problem, only having 1 cup ramekins, not the larger size called for in the recipe. We cooked the souffles for 10 minutes and they ended up being a little dry and dense, not the normal light, wet, and airy consisitence I'm used to. It was still delicious though! Our whipped cream was also a little watery, which I attribute to the liquer. I'll whip for a little longer the next time to see if that helps. Next time we'll bake for less time to see if the souffles come out less dry and dense. Or actually buy bigger ramekins!

Love this recipe! Truly impressive looking, like all good souffles. And I agree that the whipped cream is not to be missed. The addition of chopped white chocolate sounded weird to me at the time, but the contrasted texture is fabulous, and the way that the creme melt into the warm souffle is one of the simplest pleasures in life.

Souffle was delicious but really bitter. I would recommend using semi- sweet chocolate as well as dark chocolate to soften up the taste. The whipped cream helped, but without it the souffle would have been way too bitter.

This was a big success at my house. I got 3 individual servings from this recipe. I agree with others. It is so easy and unbelievably delicious. A keeper and will make again & again. The sauce is mandatory!!!!

Another vote to say: do not skip the whipped cream! The souffle itself is delicious, but the whipped cream really makes the dish, both the liquor and also the chunks of chocolate, whose texture is a perfect complement to the souffle.

Easy and impressive! The white chocolate whipped cream really makes the dessert! Definitely add more cointreau and grated rind to the whipped cream. I served with orange slices sprinkled with cointreau and chopped mint.

This was easy to make and delicious. I did not use the recipe for the whipped cream. It is very rich, and I had a lot leftover, and so I froze it. It was still great a week later. I think I would use semisweet instead of bittersweet chocolate next time just to make the flavor a little friendlier to a wider array of palates.

Delicious! Made this into 4 servings, presented with raspberries on the side. Slightly increased the G. Marnier in both the souffle and the whipped cream. Despite the cream melting on the warm chocolate, the dish was excellent...and the chopped chocolate is a refreshing contrast to the smoothness of the rest of the dessert. Highly recommended!

This was very nice. You could easily make this four servings by using 1 cup size ramekins. I also served with raspberries on the side and a few sprinkled on top of the souffle. It was a fantastic combination.

The souffle was great but the whipped cream was amazing! I did not have souffle dishes so I used ramekins instead. Using the ramekins, I had enough batter for 5 souffles. I found that this smaller portion was enough, though I would make extra whipped cream next time.

This dessert was one of the best desserts I have ever tasted! It was light and mosit, and the chocolate chunks fitted in with the cake just fine! This cake was worth ten forks!

Just made (and ate) for a decadent Sunday brunch. Used Valrhona bittersweet but skipped the whipped cream. Definitely a keeper. So easy. So elegant. So simple. And SO delicious!

Have made this countless times over the years and always to rave reviews. I'm known for making desserts but this one ranks as #1 to several friends. Have made a large one, individual ones and have even doubled the recipe for 8...never a problem.

Excellent! I used Grand Marnier in the whipped cream and souffle, and it come out beautifully. Orange and chocolate make a wonderful combination.

Simply gorgeous and delicious! I'm not a fan of wipped cream, so instead I prepared an orange zest and vanilla bean sirop, that I poured at the last minute on each individual soufflés... and it was divine! I impressed all of my 15 guests with this desert, thank you!

I multiplied this by 1.5, then used 4 individual souffle dishes. It was absolutely incredible. Very rich - the combination of flavors was intense - definitely use the whipped cream recipe. All dinner guests were amazed!

Dynamite! Doubled in a 2-quart souffle dish and baked for 25 minutes.

This is a wonderful dessert to make and it is not difficult either! It is very impressive to guests and great to eat. I would suggest using Grand Marnier instead of Cointreau. I am just a Grand Marnier fan I guess.

Spectacular dessert, even though I'm not a big fan of orange. I've made this many many times, substituting different liqueurs, like Kahlua and Frangelico. The cream is completely decadent. Absolute heaven!!!

Can we please have fractions in our fork ratings? If this was possible, I'd give it another half a fork. This was excellent, in spite of the fact that I over cooked them. I did the allotted time, but never checked on them till the buzzer went off. Next time I'll check on them. The white chocolate chunks in the whipped cream was a wonderful idea. All the guests were delighted.
