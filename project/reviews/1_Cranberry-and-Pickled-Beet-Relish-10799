I love cranberries and make a lot of cranberry relishes. This is by far the worst ever. Nasty. Just plain nasty.

If you like vinegar, this is the recipe for you! I love cranberries and my husband loves beets, so I thought this would be perfect. We both had one bite that stayed with us for hours afterwards. There's either a serious misprint, or this is just plain bad.
