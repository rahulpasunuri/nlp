Wonderful, easy side dish or appie. Full of flavor but not full of calories. I used pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan for some additional flavor.

Definitely delicious. Very quick and easy. Particularly tasty with the red peppers. Highly recommended. Recipe is perfect as is. Roasting takes at least a half an hour for me usually.

My son made these and loved them. He's no chef, so they were easy and very good. He tells me he used dried oregano instead of the thyme. I'll try them myself based on his raves.
