This is one of our favorite summertime recipes. It's easy to make, tastes great, and is a wonderful way to use up some of those homegrown tomatoes.

This was delicious -- really richly flavored for a no-cook sauce. Because I served this to dinner guests, I made the sauce (sans herbs) the night before, and gently warmed it before serving over hot pasta. I also used homemade spinach pasta (tagliatelle) instead of rotelle, and it was outstanding! -Gail

Absolutely fabulous! I also added some sauteed mushrooms I had on hand...and did not add quite as much basil or mint, as the flavor was already pretty intense. Even my husband (who is not a huge pasta fan) loved it!
