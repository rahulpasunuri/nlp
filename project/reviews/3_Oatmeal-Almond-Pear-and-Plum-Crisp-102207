So easy, so fast, and so good! I didn't have almonds, so I left them out. I didn't have pears, so I used 1 1/2 cups of frozen mixed berries. Don't be afraid to substitute with this, because it's very forgiving.

Was looking for a low-fat/cal but delicious way to use my pears, and this is it! I only had pears, so used the appropriate amount and lightly dusted them with cinnamon and vanilla sugar in addition to the nutmeg. Will make this again soon!

Instead of yogurt I served it with whipped cream, and it was super, adults and kids alike wolfed it down this Thanksgiving.

We loved this! We had it warm for breakfast; it was not too sweet. I left the peels on the pears and plums for extra fiber and nobody noticed. The almonds in the crisp are especially good.

excellent and very healthy, since it contains oatmeal, it lowers the cholesterol level
