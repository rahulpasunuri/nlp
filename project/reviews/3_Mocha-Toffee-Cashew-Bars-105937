I don't usually love bar cookies, but these are delicious. They have a very grown-up flavor profile. I modified the recipe because of other users reviews: Reduce butter to 1 1/2 sticks. Reduce flour to 1 3/4 cups. Reduce espresso powder to 1 Tbsp and add dry instead of dissolving. Use whole egg in the base. Whip the mixture for a long time before adding flour, hardly at all after adding flour. Add some cream to the melted chocolate to improve texture.

Really good, a big hit, although I used instant coffee instead of espresso powder, and they had the unmistakeable unpleasant flavor of instant coffee. I'm going to try making fresh coffee next time. The recipe says that it makes bars 1 inch thick, which is not the case, but I liked the thinner bars. I only had 5oz of unsweetened chocolate, which I mixed with about 3TBSP of butter and sugar to taste, which was plenty to cover the entire pan of bars. Yum!

Always a big hit when I make them. Delicious and easy to make. The picture that was shown on the website is not correct (those are the brown sugar ginger crisps which are also good).

The raw batter is the best thing about these cookies in my opinion. The crunchy dark underlayer makes you think you are eating something overbaked, but I didn't overbake them. One reviewer said they are great with ice cream and I can imagine they are.

wow, these were something else altogether. i very much enjoyed the bitter, salty, slightly-sweet flavor here but it's not for everyone. the coffee is absolutely a strong flavor, but they're a lovely, unusual treat that i would share but w/a word of caution.

My Mom started making these at the holidays when the recipe first was published...now I make 4-6 batches every December. Always a hit. If you love coffee, add 1 more tablespoon of espresso...best if mashed into good vanilla ice cream.

Delicious! Our office loved these!

Can't imagine why the editors bought this one back from the archives! The espresso flavor was overpowering...a major disappointment.

Easy enough to make. I had no problems and the bars cut nicely & cleanly... But, I found the coffee flavor too strong and the texture of the base a bit weird: neither crunchy like toffee nor chewy like a browny. More like a coffee-flavored shortbread. Didn't work for me. There are much better toffee bar recipes out there...

A hit at my book club - even though someone else made this recipe with pistachios because she made the biscotti from the December 2001 issue

These bars were somewhat expensive to make, and not worth making again. I found the bottom layer wasn't very "toffee-ish" at all - I did bake it only until it pulled away, and used an "air-between-the-layers-pan" but I found it a bit dry, and mine too wanted to stick to the bottom of the pan (hard to believe with all the butter). I don't know why, but it just didn't come together - too bad, seems like a fun recipe to play around with - using mixed chopped nuts or trying milk chocolate just for fun. I wrapped mine up and gave it away to a real coffee lover.

I was too chicken to use that much espresso powder. Next time I probably will though. I had a little bit of trouble with the crust sticking to pan, but not too bad. They really are pretty. Cut the squares diagonally into triangles. I like the dark chocolate and the salty-sweet.

These bars are good, but I wouldn't make them again. The coffee flavor is too strong and the brownie base is too greasy. I say cut out some of the espresso and use less butter. However, I'm sure these will not sit around long, because they do taste good.

Very easy and more interesting than your usual bar cookie. The mocha layer has a real coffee flavor and isn't too sweet. Since I don't think you can ever have too much chocolate, I drizzled some more melted chocolate over the cashews. Looked pretty, too.
