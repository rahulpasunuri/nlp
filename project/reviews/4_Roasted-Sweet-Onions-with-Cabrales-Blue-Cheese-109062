I had friends for a Spanish meal: four types of tapas, paella, poached pears. This was the highlight. An unbelievable melding of flavors. The Cabrales is just a perfect flavor for this dish.

WOW - this is a great appetizer for a get together - made it twice in the last two weeks - it was such a hit the first time (for 8 people) that I doubled the recipe (for 8 ) the next time. My slices were more like 1/2 inch, used Gorgonzola since that was what I had in house and used a Chianti wine vinegar. My cooking time was about 30 - 40 minutes, and toasted the almonds for no more than 5 minutes during that time. Roasted the onions about fours hours ahead of time - prepped everything else so that dressing the platter was 1,2,3 when my guests arrived.

By mistake, I used goat cheese instead of blue cheese. Everyone loved it. I can't wait to make it again the right way.

This was a huge hit at our Barcelona cooking party. I used Valdeon cheese as Cabrales was not available at Balducci's. It was amazing, everyone loved it and I can easily see using this as a side with roasted or grilled meat.

This was out of the park amazing! Only thing I didn't add was the chopped chives. Served this at a Girls Only Martnini Party and everyone wanted the recipe. Thank you!

I brought this to a tapas party and it was a huge hit. It was a little messy, but the layers of flavours were excellent. I substituted gorgonzola for cabrales, and used a combination of balsamic vinegar and real sherry because I couldn't find sherry vinegar. Mmmm. Would absolutely make this again.

This is so easy and so good! Guests will think this was so difficult to make :) I subbed gorgonzola with tasty results.

Made this last night as part of a tapas cocktail party. I was a bit skeptical, but it was delicious. I drizzled less olive oil than called for and used less cheese (used a mild blue cheese) and no chives because I forgot to buy them. This would be so good in sandwiches.....mmmmm.

I used Gorgonzola, and skipped the almonds. I served it hot, and put it back in the oven for a few minutes after crumbling the cheese over the onions, and then sprinkled the chives. Looked great and tasted awesome. Can't wait to make it with a rib roast!

Echoing everyone else, this is a delicious dish. The flavors are so vibrant. I just drizzled oil on top at the end (rather than pour another 1/4 cup), used a bit less cheese and maybe half the chives. Will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
Never fails, I make it again and again for parties and friends coming over, always eaten, always raves! Cook some extras in case some fall apart or cook unevenly. The recommended Red Peppers are great, too, but more labor!

Although I thought there was a lot of "stuff" on top of the onions, everyone loved them. The blue cheese went very well with the onions.

Rating: 3
Very good. Used a little more vinegar than called for. Kept cheese separate. Leftovers kept in refrigerator for quite a while (made a great sandwich with some goat cheese. In the future I might just make some to keep in the fridge and just add almonds chives and cheese right before eating.

Oh my gosh, the fragrance of baking onions was a delight...I ate half of it while I was assembling the recipe! I took it to a spanish themed wine tasting and it was the hit of the party...very easy and so tasty! This one will become one of my staples.

This recipe is on regular rotation. Quite simple to make and usually have the ingredients on hand. Contrast of sweet onions with tangy vinegar and cheese can't be beat.

I Have prepared and served this recipe multiple times and there are rave reviews each time...A winner!

After roasting, I chopped the onions just a bit and served this dish as an appetizer with crusted bread and crackers. The flavors are wonderful. Big hit!

OH SO GOOD! Delish on the side of a grilled NY strip (with extra blue on top!)

Amazing recipe! Have made this one again and again with a variety of cheeses and nuts. I tried converting it into a pasta salad today - with great results. Just chopped everything a bit finer and added cooked orzo. Yumm!

I made this as a side dish for a Spanish-themed dinner party and it was really good! The smell of onions roasting got everyone hungry while waiting for the food. I couldn't get cabrales so I used Danish Blue instead.

Rating: 3
I served this as a delicious accompaniment to espresso & spice rubbed tenderloin steaks. Substituted white balsamic vinegar since I couldn't find the other. Substituted walnuts for the almonds, which stood up better to the beef.

Rating: 4
I've made this several times, it's one of my favorites because it's so simple, and most of the ingredients I always have on hand. I use Danablu blue cheese, and chopped, roasted almonds, and omit the chives. Will try balsamic vinegar someday, in lieu of the sherry wine vinegar!

Rating: 4
I love this recipe! It's so flavorful and easy. I made it in conjunction with the ROASTED RED PEPPERS WITH GARLIC, served with a cured meat(e.g.,prociutto), crusty bread or polenta, and there you have it, a delicious meal!

I made these to serve on top of pan roasted filet mignon- they were outstanding. A nice alternative to traditional sauteed onions.

Rating: 4
As amazing as all the other reviews said. Used white balsamic vinegar instead of sherry, and Roquefort instead of Cabrales, and no one was the wiser. Heavenly.

Rating: 4
I served this along with some other tapas; fantastic. I doubled the recipe, so I didn't single-layer the onions (didn't want to take the time). It was no problem. Also, my Vidalias were over-large, so next time I will cut rings in half. Leftovers were used on top of hamburgers, and were great.

Awesome recipe!!!! Have made it several times for parties and it is always a hit. Used toasted pine nuts instead of almonds and reduced the oil to 1/4 c. total for recipe (as recommended) with better results.

Rating: 4
WOW!!! If there was a five fork rating I would give it. I omitted the almonds only because I'm not crazy about nuts in my food. Although I like them all seperately. This dish was fabulous, everyone raved about it. Even the people who don't normally like blue cheess loved it.

This is an incredible dish! I could eat it every day.

I used a strong danish blue and a fine balsamic in place of the sherry vinegar. A unanimous WOW! Simply spectacular and I don't like onions.

Rating: 4
Definitely WOW. A show stopper! Noone can believe onions can taste soooo good. Great with BBQ steak. Tried three different blue cheeses and they all work great. I only oil enough to coat and bumped up the temp to 450. While the oven is on, I also throw in a head of garlic to roast - the time and temp is just right.

oh my goodness, heaven on earth. i made my onions smaller and actually served this as an appetizer before supper, with thinly sliced crusty french bread. everyone loooooved it, and it was so easy too: in the oven, sprinkle, and you are done!!! a definite keeper. probably could have gone w/less oil, my only suggestion.

I tried this recipie using a yellow onion and blue cheese from the supermarket. I let the blue cheese melt slightly on top of the onion slices. It was great!!

So delicious! Prepared exactly as called for in the recipe and it was superb... a definite keeper.

These onions were great. I think the key is the roasting. I reduced the olive oil to 1/4 c total. I also skipped the chives and almonds. I made these up ahead of time warming them up before adding the vinegar, oil and cheese (I used gorganzala). I will definately make these again.

I loved this! I've served it both as a side and as an appetizer. It's perfect for entertaining because it can be done ahead and served at room temp. I've also used Valdeon cheese with great results.

Simply outstanding. The second time I used lightly toasted pine nuts instead of almonds and it was even better. I will make this again, and again, and again.

really, really delicious - my sweetie couldn't stop raving about it,

Rating: 4
Terrific mix of flavors. The flavors actually improved after sitting for about half an hour - the sweetness of the onions mellowed out the cabrales, which is a bit intense. A terrific addition to a tapas menu, although definitely not a main course (a couple of large onion slices is plenty for anyone).

Rating: 4
This was fantastic. I love these, simple, ingredient-driven recipes. This reminded me of my summer in Spain. Don't skimp on the cheese - find the Cabrales! Also, this is the time to break out the expensive Spanish EV olive oil. just a drizzle on top right at service.

We loved this!!!

Delicious! This was a definite hit. Used Gorgonzola, balsamic vinegar, and pine nuts as one cook suggested. Made it lighter by omitting the final 1/4 cup of olive oil, and somewhat less cheese and it was still fabulous. Serve warm! Will try other vinegars in future.

This really is terrific. One thing you can do to make the dish look like the picture without going to the trouble of making the roasted red peppers is to buy peppadews. This is a South African fruit. It's a small red pepper (delicious and very pretty) that you may be able to find at a good deli.

I made this for a dinner party over the weekend and everyone loved it. I would definitely make it again.

Really, really good! To the cook from VA, I learned a tip for roasting/grilling onion rings -- just skewer 'em! Keeps everything nice and intact (of course you should soak the skewers first!).

Rating: 0
I've got the onions in the oven-help! Is the intent to keep the rings intact? That seems hard to do. I assume it ends up a jumble of roasted onions?

Our guests raved about this curiously interesting dish. Made it a day ahead, reheated it and then put on the toppings. Of necessity, I substituted chopped cilantro for the chives, basil vinegar instead of sherry vinegar, and gorgonzola. There were no leftovers.

You must love onions and blue cheese to love this one, but oh my god, how awesome. Would go great with anything, but the beauty is that it can be made well ahead. We've had it several times, but the Star was on Christmas Day, served next to a filet mignon smothered in fresh horseradish (and butternut squash puree). So FEW recipes receive all 4 stars...

My aunt made this as an appetizer for a family dinner, recently. I couldn't keep myself from the table! Everyone really enjoyed it!

This page in Bon Appetit has been bookmarked for all time! We are vegetarians and this was our main entree. I served the onions with a wilted spinach salad and the presentation was simply beautiful. I used a blue cheese that was in my refrigerator and substituted walnuts. Next time I am going to skip the oil for health reasons. This is one not to miss!!

THIS RECIPE IS SO DELICIOUS. I MADE IT WITH BEEF WELLINGTON AS A SIDE DISH AND WOW, WHAT A GREAT HIT WITH MY DINNER PARTY GUESTS! THE ONLY CHANGE I MADE WAS THAT I USED ROASTED PECANS INSTEAD OF THE ALMONDS. I WILL MAKE IT AGAIN SOON!!

This is one of my current favorite recipes of all time now, after ordering some Cabrales from DiBruno Brothers, online. I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting pine nuts, because I like them better. I've made it twice so far. It's divine, and a great starter.

Rating: 4
Excellent side dish, especially since it can be done ahead. We are serving it again for guests this weekend.

Before anyone slays me for substitutions; we have just moved from out of country and my pantry is not yet fully restocked. I used Danish blue cheese, pine nuts and balsamic vinegar with excellent results. The onions were beautiful to look at and delicious. Served them with pork tenderloin. I baked them 45 min early in day then the final 15 before eating (putting cheese on last 3 min)and served hot. I will definitely make these for a company steak BBQ--they are easy, present very well and I usually have the ingredients (I used) on hand.

I served this along with beef and it was delicious. I used the Italian gorganzola and it was mild and creamy. I'm not sure I agree with the room temperature note though, I think they're better quite warm.
