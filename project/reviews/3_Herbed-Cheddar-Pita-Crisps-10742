Pita crips were just okay. Tasty but nothing spectacular. Lots of other recipes out there I would make before these again.

We loved this recipe, and now I'm wondering why I didn't make them sooner when they first appeared in Gourmet. I cut the recipe in half and served the crisps with dinner instead of serving rolls, but next time I'll make them for guests as an appetizer to serve with drinks. I agree with the previous writer--assemble everything ahead of time, but don't bake the crisps until shortly before serving them so they're nice and crisp. They're especially good warm. To reheat them, I'd probably warm them up in the oven.

I love this recipe and so have do my guests. The only problem with this recipe is if you make it too far in advance it tends to get chewy so don't make it until right before you want people to eat it. But don't worry about leftovers, there won't be any.
