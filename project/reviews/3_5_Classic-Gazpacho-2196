i use fresh bell peppers instead of roasted, jersey tomatoes, and leave out the cilantro. I serve the diced tomatoes, onions, cukes, and bell peppers on the side with cut up shrimp and press garlic in right before serving. i always get raves over it. Best cold soup ever. throwing a jalapeno or two in the blender never has hurt it at all.

Great recipe--confirming what the others have said,even better the next day. Added additional cilantro (as we love it) and less onion...fabulous and easy.

This was incredible!! I too added the jalapeno and garlic. The only thing I would change is that I thought there was too much olive oil. I think adding chopped avacado might be tasty too although I haven't tried that yet.

Added garlic, jalepeno, and a bit more olive oil. This is even more delicious the next day!!

Love it! I followed previous reviewers' suggestions and added a garlic clove, slice of French bread and substituted sherry wine vinegar for the red wine vinegar. A keeper!

I have made this for years. Go easy on the onion, as you want to taste the freshness of the cucumber. Also, scrape off any chared bits from the bell pepper.

A wonderful recipe that I've been making for years. It's even better tasting the next day, when the flavors have really had a chance to meld.

I have made this gazpacho a number of times now and everytime I make it I get rave reviews. Would definitely make it again. The only thing I do different is I add a few cloves of garlic to the mix. Great refreshing summer dish.

I noticed that most of the nay-sayers in these reviews objected to calling it classic when it did not follow a traditional (soaked bread) recipe. I looked up several other recipes and did a bit of combining. I used white wine vinegar instead of read, added two cloves of garlic, and did put tomato-juice soaked bread through the food processor with the rest of the ingredients. I also reduced the cilantro, as the full amount seemed overpowering. It was delicious accompanied with a white wine fruti del mar pasta.

I didn't like this a whole lot...all I could taste was the vinegar...maybe the vinegar I used was too old, but I will try other recipes before I try this again.

I have been making this recipe since it fist appeared in 1991. It became one of our favorite summer rituals. This is a recipe that is great just as it is or personalized with a modification or two. Over the years, I have started adding one or two cloves of garlic, cutting back on the cilantro to either a quarter or third of a cup, and using closer to a quarter teaspoon of hot sauce. What a simple and delicious way to celebrate summer.

Absolutely terrific! Don't often give 4 forks, but this is better than any gazpacho I have had anywhere. And so easy! When a dish tastes this good, does it really matter if it doesn't follow someone's rigid "classic" guidelines? My tastebuds care about flavor, not classicism!

I made this for a pot luck at work. Everyone loved it and it was invited back. I left out the roasted pepper and added fresh green bell pepper, also added advocado.

I too don't care if this is truly a "classic spanish gazpacho". It is wonderful! It must be the red peppers that give it that extra something. I can't wait to make it for friends and family!

Use Jersey tomatoes in the summertime for the most amazing flavor!

This has been our favorite summer cold soup since I clipped the recipe in 1991 and pasted it on a now yellowed 4x6 card...it's gazpacho at our house and the heck with the purists

I would hesitate to call this dish "Classic Gazpacho" since the soup that originated in the Catalonian region of Spain is made from day old bread, tomatoes, garlic, sherry wine vinegar and little olive oil and served with a selection of simple garnishes - like chopped onion and parsley.

What a simple, easy, and tasty refreshing taste. Can't wait for my company to review it as it is different from the one I usually serve and simply delicious.

This gazpacho is simply the best. The idea of including roasted peppers is pure genius. It makes it taste amazing, and nobody can tell why.

Ignore the comments that focus on this recipe's name, i.e., whether or not this is "classic" gazpacho. Since when are recipes rated on their name instead of the finished product's taste? This gazpacho is fantastic! Let this refreshing summer soup impress you, and ignore the know-it-all attitude of those who take offense at the recipe's title.

Good South American tomato soup, maybe, but it is not Gazpacho. Real Gaspacho is easy to make: process one piece of good quality bread, garlic, several tomatoes, a few slices of cucumber and green bell pepper. Add good red wine vinegar (only) and virgin olive oil. Chill thoroughly and enjoy!

Very easy to make and very tasty. Good with French bread

Other reviewers are correct - this is not really "Classic" Gazpacho, but come on - it's fantastic! Kind of like a combo between Gazpacho and pico de gallo. And, SO healthy for you. If you sub a fat free salad dressing for the oil, the whole preparation has less then 400 calories.

Tasty and elegant. Just before serving, I added some thinly sliced smoked sausage and a few large crispy crutons to each serving. Not classic additions, but more filling.

This recipe is fantastic! I finally rediscovered it! I made this in 1993 for my fellow classmates in gradutate school. They've never experienced anything like it! Very fresh, cooling on a hot summer day! I've been searching for years because I lost my copy of Bon Appetit with this recipe in it. Thank you Epicurious!

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah... forget all of the talk about classic gazpacho, that this isn't classic, blah blah blah. This recipe makes a great, fresh soup, plain and simple. I added garlic cloves to the mix and served it ice cold. It was delicious, better than I've had anywhere. Very fresh and simple.

Added a little garlic, used 1/2 tomato and 1/2 Spicy V8 juice, juice from 1/2 a lemon and 2 ortega whole roasted green chilies. The chilies added a nice flavor, but didn't make the soup to spicy. Topped with chopped avacodo and cooked bay shrimp. Wonderful! My husband said it was the best gazpacho he'd ever had. I'll make again for a dinner party.

It may not be authentic gazpacho, but it is certainly delicious! I've been making this since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. It's easy and fresh!

not at all spanish, thus i cannot understand why this is a "classic gazpacho." spanish cooks use the very simple ingredients of tomatoes,green peppers,onions,bread,olive oil,red wine vinegar,a little salt and pepper. for some reason american cooks have over extended the recipes for gazpacho. for the one who added v-8 and bloody mary mix....that completely negates the flavor of the vegetables. as for his omitting the wine vinegar for balsamic........well you just eliminated one of the essential ingredients of gazpacho. just keep it simple and elegant..thats the spanish(more accurately andalucian) way.

Excellent! I used V-8 & a little Bloody Mary mix for base. Cut the cilantro added lemon. Balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. I always seem to play with a recipe. It was my first attempt at Gazpacho and fell to rave reviews!

I lived in Southern Spain four years and ate lots of gazpacho. The Spanish use only cucumber, green chili type peppers, bread, olive oil, vinegar, tomatoes and onions in gazpacho. . Not most of the ingredients included here. Whoever submitted this has not been to Spain

Good gazpacho recipe. I used 2 Cups of V-8 instead of 3 cups of tomato juice...made it thicker. Also, I can't believe you didn't include garlic!!! Try these changes, and it could be a 4 fork recipe.

The best Gazpacho recipe I've found. It has been a hit each time I serve it to guests. I added a little more hot sauce as well as fresh lemon juice from 1/2 lemon.

Overall, a very easy dish to prepare. Vine-ripened tomatoes make for a better flavor. Also, add 1 to 4 jalapeno peppers to the blended ingredients for a subtle zing.
