This was awful.

I think the trick to this recipe is the balance between sweet and heat, and not overcooking the shrimp. On a hunch based on other reviews, I doubled the chutney and cut the cayenne below 1/4 tsp. Just right for me and the family. Will definitely be doing this again soon (gotta use up that tamarind concentrate, right?). Found the concentrate at Whole Foods, btw. You could easily do this for company, do the prep ahead and the dish comes in less than 10 minutes excepting the rice. Enjoy!

Like other reviewers, I followed this recipe as closely as I could, reducing the cayenne for a guest who is particularly sensitive to hot spices. I was unable to find tamarind, so I used some fresh-squeezed lemon juice and a bit of brown sugar instead. Oops... I just looked at the recipe and realized I was missing the curry powder - have to try that next time!

We thought this was very good, spicy yes, it will stay on our make again list. Next time I think I may sub pineapple for possibly both apricots and prunes. Didn't have tamarind concentrate, just added a little more soy Next time probably a little more chutney, 1 tablespoon just isn't enough! Husband liked!

Made this last night and followed recipe for the most part. Couldn't get the tamarind paste or mango chutney (I was shopping at 8 PM to make that night) so used a apricot chutney and tamarind candy balls. I also left out the sugar since using dried fruit adds a lot of sugar all ready. We loved it but actually would have liked more cayenne pepper contrary to some of the previous reviews. Will definitely make this again! I think you could substitute chicken here easily!

This was amazing. I highly suggest this and could see adding fresh mango as well. Great with brown rice.

I followed this to the letter and it was wonderful. Will make again for sure.

This recipe is awesome - it's gotten rave reviews from everyone I've made it for and I follow the recipe almost exactly. The first time I made it, I was shopping in a hurry and the market I was at didn't have Tamarind concentrate so I used Pad Thai sauce instead (it has Tamarind in it...) and I forgot to get prunes so I used rasins. The second time I used prunes but I actually liked the rasins better so now I always make it that way. It's also very good with brown rice.

I thought this was an interesting dish and a good introduction indian-style cooking. Used less cayenne than the recipe stated and also threw in frozen peas.

1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper??!! We love hot food but this was way too much. It's really hard to tell if the recipe would have been good with a reduced amount of the cayenne, but I will trust other reviewers' comments, and may try it again. However, be warned, and do not follow the recipe to the letter without warning!

This is an awesome and easy dish to make. I doubled it and froze the ingredients separately which made for a great dinner another evening! The only thing to watch out for, is how spicy you want to make it. Mine came out very spicy, but next I will part of it with less spice for the kids. Thank you BA!
