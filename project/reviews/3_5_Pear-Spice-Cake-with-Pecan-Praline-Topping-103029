My family loved this cake. I made it for Christmas and it was delish.My cake sunk in the middle too and I'm a good baker, I immediately thought of using a bundt pan as others had suggested. Thanks for the tip about preventing the pear and ginger from sinking, I thought about flouring, but I usually follow a recipe as directed the first time I use it. I did not find this dry at all, in fact I thought it had a nice texture. I did use a brown sugar glaze that my family likes instead of the frosting in the recipe, but I did add the nuts to it, definitely great. If you want to try it the glaze recipe is: 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3TBS milk, 3/4 tsp expresso powder, in heavy pan over med. heat till sugar and coffee dissolve. Boil for one minute. Remove from heat and add 1&1/2 TBS of butter and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. Then you can stir in the nuts if you like.

This cake makes a beautiful presentation. I cut the amount of butter down to make a denser cake. I keep the pecan praline sauce on the side serve with slices. Don't cook the sauce very long or it turns into candy rather than a sauce. To prevent the pear and ginger pieces from sinking. I reserve a couple of tablespoons of the dry mix. Shake some of this dry mix over the pears and ginger. Gently fold the pear and ginger in after the cake is mixed and just before you put the mix in the pan.

This has turned out to be my favorite spice cake. I've baked it 4 times, and it's consistantly excellent. I make only minor changes: decrease the ginger to 1/4 cup, bake it in a bundt pan (I've tried both pans), and chop the pecans before roasting them and adding them to the caramel. I serve it with caramel ice cream. Always a big hit.

I love the flavor of this cake. Spice cake is the only cake my pie-loving family will eat, so we were all happy. I followed the revisions suggested by mdebkowski, using a bundt pan and reducing the sweetness of the frosting. The cake was incredibly moist (and still is, two days later!), but the topping was too heavy (in weight, not flavor) for the cake. Next time, I will reduce the amount of chopped nuts by half, use the original (sweeter) frosting recipe, and follow the suggestion of A Cook from Oceanside, CA, and make the frosting at the last minute and spoon it over individual cake slices.

The cake is good, though rather "flaky" or "crumbly," but very moist. However, the topping is overkill. It was way too sweet and detracted from the subtle flavor of the cake. In addition, once it hardened, it wasn't the right texture to go with the soft cake. Bottom line for me: I'll make the cake again without the topping and just dust it with powdered sugar and serve it with an appropriate flavor of sorbet, ice cream or even creme fraiche.

Like the cook from Brentwood, CA, my husband and I ate the entire cake in one weekend - it's that good.

This is a delicious, easy, somewhat impressive dessert (especially for your friends that don't cook or don't realize it's from a cake mix). I'm not a cake person either but this recipe is great for a special occasion in fall or winter.

This is really a delicious cake. I wish that it had a denser texture, but for the ease of using a boxed mix it's really amazing. I made the cake a day ahead of time but made the glaze about 20 minutes before I served it and spooned it over each slice and the accompanying vanilla ice cream. Again, I wish that it had more heft to it, but it was delicious and enjoyed by everyone who ate it.

I was a little concerned about the praline topping while making the cake, but it came out just perfect! A great combination for a spice cake. I made this cake for the holidays and guests were not hesitating at all at my offer to share the leftovers!

The simplicity of this recipie nudges it to 4 forks. So easy with impressive results. Reading the other reviews re. the pieces sinking to the bottom, I minced the ginger and pears fairly small. I also baked this in a bundt pan which not only resulted in any sinking pieces being on top when the cake was turned out, but the cake looked very pretty! Also, with some concern that the cake would be too sweet, I modifed the topping by using only 1/3C of brown sugar and instead of heavy cream, used sour cream mixed with 2T light cream. This worked wonderfully, giving the topping just a slight tang from the sour cream to counter the sweetness of the cake. Topping sat beautifully on top of the bundt shape. Terrific results!

This is truly a very special cake. Really moist and the flavor was outstanding. My only change would be to chop the nuts rather than leaviing them large just because it is easier to cut

This cake was ok. It was too dry for my taste and the flavors weren't pronounced. The topping is delicious and I would make it again to put on anything...the "Sour Cream Maple Cake" came out much better.

We're really not a cake family (cheesecake yes, but normal cake - rarely) but this cake got raves! It was easy to make and the best spice cake I've ever had.

For a cake made from a mix, it was amazing. Got great reviews and no one could believe it was from a mix.

I'm not an expert baker but this came out well. Realized at the last second that I didn't have pecans, so I baked it in two 8" pans, then used the cream cheese frosting from the "Pear Cake with Lemon Honey Cream Cheese Icing" on this site. A hit.

I really liked this recipe because it is very easy to make and really delicious. In fact I almost panicked when I couldn't find the recipe because I was planning to make it. I also liked reading about the adaptations other reviewers had made--especially the one about using blackberries. sounds yummy!

Mine did not turn out as moist as others reported, and fell in the middle (granted, the falling might be something I did, although I've baked lots of cakes and not had this problem). The other problem was the praline topping. It was good when it was still warm, but as the recipe states, the topping turns to a hard praline after it cools completely, which makes it hard to slice and destroys the cake even with a sharp knife. I think it would be better if the topping remained soft...more like an icing than true praline. I will say that the flavors were good together. Nice and spicy.

I agree a spice cake mix never tasted so good. Simple to make, lovely presentation and absolutely delicious.

Made this for my partners retirement party. I usually am a chocolate person and not big on fruit in cake but this was delicious. Everyone was very impressed and it was not difficult to amke.

I made this with a box of caramel cake mix and a generous amount of minced fresh ginger (to me, crystallized ginger tastes like fancy soap) Also omitted the molasses. Guests couldn't get enough of it, and one friend even threw in the towel on the South Beach Diet to partake!

This makes a lovely winter dessert. After reading the ingredients on the box of spice cake mix, I chose to make my own with my own fresh spices from Penzys. I modified the recipe on this site for a spice cake with a blackberry filling. I substituted the pear nectar for the sour cream, cut back the brown sugar to 1 cup, and I did not separate the eggs. the result was a moist, rich cake that was not too sweet and was beautifully complimented by the praline sauce.

I've made this recipe several times, and always get compliments, even though it sunk on me once. I only used 1 tbsp molasses, I shortened the baking time to 1 hour.

Every time I make this cake -- which is incredibly easy -- I'm always bombarded with requests for the recipe. People can't beleive it's a mix!

Quick, easy, yummy! I skipped the pecans in the caramel sauce, and it was still good.

I made this before in the Fall and it was great. It is now Summer and thought the Spice cake was too heavy so I substitued a French Vanilla cake mix and eliminated the molasses. It came out great too!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. Since my springform pan was in use I baked it in an angel food pan and it made a pretty presentation. I thought the cake was very sweet, but everyone else loved it.

Actually, a dear friend baked this cake for me on my birthday. I must say, it was the best birthday cake I've ever had! Absolutely divine! I would highly recommend this recipe...it's delish!

After reading the comments about the pear pieces sinking to the bottom of the cake, I decided to coarsely grate the pears instead. Turned out very nice, although the pear flavour was not as pronounced as it would've been with the 1/2 inch pieces. Also, instead of making the topping (don't need the mess or the extra calories!), I chopped the pecan halves into smaller pieces and incorporated them into the cake batter. Overall, a lovely cake for the autumn!

I accidentally added an extra stick of butter to the cake batter, with delicious results. I served this as a breakfast cake with strong coffee for a friend's birthday and have had many requests for it since then. Would definitely recommend chopping the pecans for cutting ease.

I was dying to make this recipe. With all the yummy extras to the spice cake mix, I thought it would be more special than it was. The praline topping was a definite hit and the cake made a beautiful presentation. I think my friends and I agreed that if it were baked in a larger, more shallow pan, the ratio of praline topping to cake would enhance this recipe. We all liked it, but would probably tinker with it some next time around.

This is a great recipe, it tastes like you spent all day preparing it but you really didn't. I have made this recipe 3 times always to rave reviews!

I have made this twice and it is to die for. Serve it with a little french vanilla or cinnamon ice cream and you'll have no arguement!

This recipe was fabulous...moist, flavorful, and the hands-down favorite at my party. The pieces of pear and the chunks of crystallized ginger in the mix were wonderful, although they sank to the bottom. Be sure to toast the pecans for the praline very thoroughly before adding them to the topping.

This is wonderful! I double the caramel sauce and serve it with the cake and vanilla ice cream. Swirl the caramel sauce on the plate. Makes a nice presentation.

This was a fabulous cake. Quite moist (even days after) for a home made cake. The cake was a perfect finsih to the pear, walnut and arugula salad that was part of the holiday menus in the 2000 holiday edition. We also served the the herb and garlic crusted strip loin, portobello and potatoe gratin and green beans with bacon and shallots. Was able to bake the cake on Sat and re-warm as instructed the next day. Not too sweet either!

This was just OK. I think the pecans should be chopped because the cake is delicate. As you slice a serving, it falls apart because the unchopped pecans break/crumble the cake. Also, topping does not get any firmer. I added more pears than called for, but maybe they weren't ripe enough. Everyone liked it, but it wasn't anything special. Looks pretty though.

With pears right off the pear tree this was a wonderful dessert. Next time I will increase the amount of pears but it was excellent as is.

Served at a dinner party for 20...everyone raved...a bit messy, but oh so good

This was quite good but there are things I like better. It could definately use more pears.

What a fantastic cake!! This is definetly going in my Favorite Recipe Collection. I can not believe it when my husband and I ate the whole thing in one weekend!!

The first time I made this I used canned pears and juice, and it turned out fine. I finally found pear nectar (Kerns brand) and used fresh pears. Either way, it's a super dessert!

I liked the cake a lot, but thought the recipe called for too much praline topping, you lost some of the pear/ginger flavor. I used only about 1/3 of the topping, but will use even less next time, or put it on the side.

This cake was fabulous! I made it for a birthday and everyone demanded the recipe. I doubled the caramel recipe and drizzled it on int two layers - it keeps the cake moist and makes it even more decadent. Helpful Hint: Pear nectar can be purchased at most Italian food stores.

Great cake! The center of my first try sunk, but it tasted great and the pecan-praline sauce disguised the sunken center well. I couldn't find pear nectar -- substituted pear baby food diluted with pear juice. My guests loved it.

This cake is quick, easy, and impressive. I couldn't find pear nectar though. What I found was that if you get a 15 oz. can of pear slices (in the juice, NOT the heavy syrup) the juice in the can is a little over 3/4 cup.

I made this for a dinner party - it was easy and everyone loved it. I used stick margarine and egg beaters as substitutions to lower the fat content. Also, I couldn't find pear nectar, so I bought canned pears and pureed them. None of these detracted from the taste - excellent!

This was delicious & easy. I also served it with vanilla ice cream. However, I had two problems - the center "sunk" even though the cake was done; and all of the fruit fell to the bottom of the cake. Neither of these detracted from the great taste, but next time I'll try a different recipe.
