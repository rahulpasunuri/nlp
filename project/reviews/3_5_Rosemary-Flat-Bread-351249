Excellent recipe. It makes more bread than I expected. I refrigerated most of it and it was great into the next week. I agree with the reviewer about added the rosemary early, though. Also, I sprinkled it with coarse sea salt. I'll be making this again soon!

I made this bread with 100% whole wheat bread flour. It was as easy as the time I made it with white flour. Very easy bread to make! No problems rising, no problems shaping or baking. and yummy. Another change I made is that I incorporated 3TBSP (yes, that much!) rosemary leaves into the dough before the first rise. I found that if I sprinkled the rosemary on top it became crunchy and yummy, but most of it fell off. This way the whole bread was infused with that nice flavor. I also sprinkled a few leaves, probably one TBSP on top before baking for the crunchiness and looks. This time I followed shaping directions to make a large rectangle on a pan. Next time I will try to make two long breads out of the one dough. I like more crust surfaces.

I just baked this bread and lemme tell you... wonderful!!! First, so easy! Took me five minutes to put it all together. I used mostly whole wheat flour I had around with about 1 cup of regular white flour, neither of them were bread flour. Also, my yeast is not the one called for in the recipe. Mine is the Costco kind that isn't rapid rise, so I used 2 teaspoons instead of the 1.25 called for. It's in the kitchen right now getting devoured. Next time I will try to make it with all whole-wheat, and I definitely want to get the rosemary to stick more.. someone suggested putting it on during the second rise.. I'll try that.

I made this last night and served it with a beef stew. It was a hit--nice flavor and texture. This was the most bizarre bread prep experience, though. First, I added a whole envelope of yeast before it occurred to me that the envelope held 2 1/4 tsp of yeast which was more than the recipe called for. It worked fine. Second, why use an extra 4 tsp. of olive oil together with the 1/4 cup? I just added a glug, rather than measuring a minuscule quantity. It worked fine. Finally, I don't bake in a stove with a "floor" on which I can place a "heavy rimmed baking pan". Instead I used a tiny sauté pan that was certainly large enough to hold 1/2 cup of ice and placed it on the lowest rack with the bread on the second lowest rack. Yes, it worked fine. In sum, don't worry about following the directions exactly and understand that the bread at first appears to be a beige gelatinous mess. It all comes out fine.

I have a very similar recipe from my grandmother that I've made for years but I when adding the rosemary, I also add diced red onion but omit the salt. It's fabulous and the onion adds another dimension of flavor.

This was my first time making a focaccia- like bread. My dough was very loose even after adding the additional flour, but it came out phenomenal. It was chewy but tender. We had to restrain ourselves from eating the whole loaf. After making it this once, it will be much easier the next time.

My original search was for bread for the bread machine since I haven't had much luck finding "great" bread machine recipes on the net. I adapted this by simply exchanging the regular yeast for bread machine yeast and making sure all the wet ingredients went in first and dry last (as any bread machine owner already knows). This is by FAR the best textured, best tasting bread dough I have made in my machine. Looks, feels and tastes like it came out of a brick oven! I did not bake it in the machine but let it rise a few hours after the final beep in the machine until it almost opened up the lid of the bread machine. I put olive oil on the parchment on the baking sheet and preheated the oven very briefly to make it warm (no warmer than 100 degrees) and let it sit in the oven for one hour with the oven door slightly open with a dish towel. Be sure the oven is off and not too warm. Also,when removing the dough from the machine, do not disturb it too much, just drop it on the baking sheet that has been lined with parchment and olive oil. Put olive oil on top as well and cover with plastic wrap. Take it out and proceed to warm oven to 475 on CONVECT BAKE mode. The result was an ARTISAN BREAD that was feather light with the texture of delicately chewy middle and crispy crust that resembled Sour-dough (but without the sour taste) that I would have easily paid 7-8 dollars in a professional french bakery. Outstanding. I have no reason to buy bread anymore! Also a great use for your overgrown herb garden.

This looks beautiful & tastes good but in making it nothing went as expected. I don't have a dough attachment on my mixer & I assume that created my problems. I did review all the Baking Bread videos on this site but my dough was so wet & sticky, it was a constant problem. Do any of you real bakers have a suggestion for what to do in lieu of the dough paddle? I used one regular mixer but certainly that's far different & gave different results. Appreciate any advice -- Thanks

I make this several times a week for my family because it is easy and tastes great. I find that it needs a little extra flour-- but I use organic flour and not the recommended Gold Medal "Bread Flour".

Absolutely fantastic!! But I made a few changes since I'm not one for following recipes to the T... I used half brown bread flour, half wholewheat + extra 1/4 spoon flour. Only 2 tbsp oil (diet-conscious), 1 tsp salt (recipes are always too salty for me), and 2 tbsp honey (cos that's what my favourite bread recipe calls for). The dough rising instructions were rather confusing so I mistakenly put on the herbs (I used various) and salt before the second rise. Consequently they stick on very nicely! I shall do this next time, too. The bread baked incredibly quickly. I heated the oven well in advance, and after about 20 mins it was done (well, I forgot to check the time, so I estimate it was 20 mins). This is good news for me because now I can have bread baked very quickly. We can't stop eating it, it is deliciously crusty.

My hubs and I LOVED this bread. Just made it, was a first time bread maker and was able to follow this with no issue. The seasalt and rosemary are perfect, and the bread came out with a lucious softness inside and crunch on the out. Lovely. We ended up putting three flavors on top, trying each. MEAT: (procuitto, garlic and parm), VEGGIE: (olive, garlic, parm and chives), and ORIGINAL (just plain flat bread)...loved them ALL! Served with a nice fresh salad...yum.

great recipe, great bread - not plagued by excessive yeastiness that plagues my other bread baking efforts. simple to make, too, and forgiving.

This recipe is great. I will agree it doesn't hold your hand all the way but it is a complete and very easy recipe. You have to be a baby or one of those people who doesn't know how to think for them selves not to be able to figure this one out. Come on people, it just bread right? Great bread at that. Oh, rosemary, love it! Seriously, you will love this.

This recipe was easy, i measured everything the first time i made this. Now i just eye ball my ingredients and let the yeast do its work. I used shortening in the recipe and it adds a nice crunch to the flat bread. I prep the dough very thin and then transfer it to a hot pizza stone and after 4 mins of baking, I add my toppings : fresh Mozzarella and Baby spinach and garlic. The bread has a great crunch! Will make this again with new toppings.

I almost didn't make this recipe because of the reviews stating that the directions were hard. I don't know if they got changed but I had no problems following them just as they are written. I almost dissolved my yeast first, but I put it in with the flour and had no problem. I did use a whole packet of yeast 21/4tsp instead of what the recipe said because I didn't notice the difference until too late. My wife and I think it taste great and I will probably make it again (with the extra yeast again).

The bread was tasty the directions are horrible. I have never baked bread before, they left out several steps. I had to search the web for similar recipes in order to figure out how to do this one. I wasted a lot of time and money. But after a few attemps and research it was tasty.

http://www.epicurious.com/articlesgui des/howtocook/primers/bread. I received the "Bread Basics" article in my mailbox and immediately wanted to make bread, especially the rosemary. Maybe I should tell everyone that I've never made bread before... I flew by the seat of my pants and still didn't end up with a hockey puck! This bread was scary at first, easy- once I figured out flour is my friend, and very tasty. I fudged a LOT of things in this too - no wheat flour, no white mix tip, rosemary & pepper mixed in, no 1 hour oven preheat (oops!)...the next attempt should be a snap & less time consuming! I'll also do more sea salt on top. Yumm!! Hints: Read the entire recipe & tips FIRST. Draw arrows to put steps where they should be (preheat oven) Read the Bread Basics article. Enjoy!

Can someone help me figure out how to do the assembly of this? For some reason, I am having a tough time picturing this...

Don't listen to the review starting with "The directions in included in this recipe...". Yes, the recipe does not hold your hand throughout, and it would seem the first part of the directions are missing...but even a novice baker like me can figure them out. This isn't exactly rocket science!?! The end result was excellent. I will be making this again, and again and again.

I used the basic recipe but also employed my breadmaker. I was surprised how moist the dough turned out but it was workable with lots of flour sprinkled on. I cooked it on a stone pizza plate in the oven. The end result was superb!

I suspect this recipe hasn't been reviewed because it hasn't been tried because the first step is missing! However, it's easy enough to figure it out. I made it and it's good but it turned out much larger (a 12" round) and fluffier than I would have liked.

The directions included in this recipe are terrible! The first part of what I think the directions should be were not included. I never did know what the whisk attachment should be used for. I am not a novice baker; but even I had trouble figuring out how to get started mixing the dough. The directions did not say how to use the extra 4 tsp. of oil until the 2nd part of shaping and 2nd rise. Once the flarbread was baked, I was not impressed. The rosemary fell off and would have been better mixed in with the dough. In the end,the bread turned out heavy and dense. Don't bother with this recipe' it's not worth the time or effort.

I'm surprised nobody has done a review for this recipe! It's my first go at baking my own bread - partly inspired by a male work colleague who makes his (I felt challenged!). Anyway, the recipe is easy to follow, I've compared it with many other recipes online and decided to stick with this. For first time bread makers like me, it's also useful to view some video (you can find some basic bread-making technique videos here on Epicurious too). I also read somewhere that salt will kill the yeast, so when making dough I didn't put the salt until flour+yeast+oil+water have mixed together. It's important that during 2nd rise you have to cover the dough (again) with cling film, many other recipes simply called for table cloth to cover - this will let too much moisture to escape and you end up with a crust at the top of the dough, you'll realise it when dimpling the dough. The result? Fantastic. Even my picky Italian flatmate said so too. He said it's like true focaccia bread =D his parents are coming from Italy in 2 weeks time so we might make another one again!
