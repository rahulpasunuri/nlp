Makes a great batter and crisp yet light as air coating. I have used this better on mushrooms and shrimp with superlative results. A good batter to have in your culinary arsenal.

Incredible! I'm not the best cook but this was super easy and amazing! My husband thought it was the delicious. I didn't have a thermometer and wasn't very strict with the measurements and it worked out fabulous. The club soda makes it! You can't go wrong!

After using epicurious.com for years, this is my first review. I thought this was outstanding! I followed it to a T and recommend using a candy/oil thermometer to check the heat. The fish was delicate and crispy and the paprika salt was great. I think using seltzer water makes a huge difference with the crispyness of the batter. I will definitely make this recipe again with excellent quality sole--I used petrale sole from the farmer's market.

A classic French preparation with a new twist. Simple and delicious. My children liked it without the paprika salt, naturally. I can't get them to eat fish, but they really enjoyed it. I fried them in my wok and that worked well. Don't try to make a ton of this because it's best served immediately after frying.
