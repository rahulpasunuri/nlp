the cornbread is great. the stuffing is on the sweet side, and the fennel flavour is very apparent. if i were to make it again, i would decrease the amount of apple and fennel and add in some nuts and a bit more stock.

My son has been raving about this recipe ever since I first made it a couple of years ago. Definitely a keeper recipe and the only one I now use for when stuffing turkey.

This turned out better than I expected. I followed the buttery cornbread recipe and was nervous because the cornbread turned out to be quite crunchy (i used coarse cornmeal). However, once we added all the other ingredients, poured the chicken broth over the cornbread and heated it again, the stuffing turned out pretty delicious. We used 10oz of cranberries instead of prunes which was a bit too much. I'll probably cut down on this next time. And, we couldn't tell there were dried apricots in the dish, so will omit next time. Do feel the fennel seed adds a nice subtle flavor to the overall dish so wouldn't skip if you like fennel.

this was quite tasty! i used dried cranberries instead of the other dried fruit, added toasted pecans and some crumbled feta. i did not use apples.

Have not made this, but seriously considering it. While I'm not opposed to prunes, wondering how figs might work instead? Has anyone tried this sub?

Color me stupid, but I STILL do not see the amount of cornbread mentioned anywhere. I used Marie Calendars Cornbread mix, because my roomie had it on hand and volunteered it. It could be that particular mix contributing to my opinion, but this recipe was SWEET. Far too sweet for my taste, even with ham, where I prefer something a little sweet. I am giving this low forks because the amount of cornbread is not mentioned. The sweet warning is just to give you a heads up, but not to criticize the recipe per se. I would have to make it again with a different kind of cornbread before I could really judge the recipe.

Geez I wish we could edit our reviews. I also forgot to addd that I too subbed in dried cranberries for the prunes which I ixnayed. Sorry for the clutter.

I forgot to add, I didn't use the prunes, I just couldn't. So I made it precisely as is sans the prunes.

Ok so I was in a hurry and didn't really read the entire recipe before I added it to the menu. I was like, cornbread? Check! Stuffing? Check! Good to go. At any rate, Xmas day, I make this and discover it goes in a PAN? What the heck? I spent beaucoup time and loot to make this meal and my turkey is going to be hollow? Quickly I cobbed together a standard bread stuffing for the giant emu-sized bird I aquired for the day, and much later on, served both. Turned out to be really good but wait folks, on our plates, we were loading up with a spoonful of standard stuffing and a spoonful of the Cornbread stuffing. Co-mingling and the result was good enough that we all started doing it. Next year I will make this again, and add it to the standard stuff or perhaps by that time I'll come up with a hybrid. A really nice side for the main event. One last thing though, who named this? It's a casserole, not a stuffing. Shame on you.

Someone gave us a honey turkey as a present & I wanted to try a new dressing to go with it. This was perfect. I did not have prunes on hand, so I used dried cranberries as someone else suggested- it was delish! Hardly any left over. Kids & hubby said it's a keeper!

I was cooking my first thanksgiving dinner... in London. So I didn't have a lot of the ingredients I needed for this (or any) of my recipes. However, this stuffing came out greattttt!!! I don't usually like stuffing all that much but this was so good! I didn't use the fennel seeds, chicken broth, or apricots. It wasn't dry at all- still great! I threw in some raisins and craisins and walnuts that I had- all good additions. Will do this again for sure.

Made this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving and liked it so well it may become my standard. I used 1/4 cup olive oil rather than butter, about 3oz of dried apricots and a large handful of fresh golden raisins rather than prunes, skipped the fennel and used fresh sage, thyme and about a half teaspoon of cinnamon. I made it the night before and folded the dried cornbread cubes in the morning. About half fit into my 17-lb turkey and the rest I baked in a dish. My husband thought it should have more cornbread. I used the recipe included (made 8 cups of cubes) so I may add another 2 cups next year.

Our favorite stuffing that we make every year. I skip the apples and use dried sweeet cherries instead of prunes and add some italian chicken sausage (with fennel). Gets rave reviews every time!

This is an excellent alternative to a traditional sausage and mushroom stuffing. I made this for our Canadian Thanksgiving and will make it again at Christmas. I used corinth raisins instead of prunes because that is what I had in the pantry and no fennel. I also added chopped walnuts.

Absolutely delicious. This ended up working out quite nicely, time wise, for a weeknight dinner. I used cornbread left over from chili night, so I only had about 1/3 of a pan, and cut the recipe by 1/3 accordingly (1 large onion, 1 large apple, 4 stalks celery; 1/3 stick butter). I omitted the dried fruit because I didn't have any in the pantry, and omitted the fennel and added sage per other reviews. I ended up about 3/4 cup of broth despite the reduction in recipe size beceause my cornbread was very dry (about 3 days old). It also only took about 25 minutes to cook, given the smaller size. This was extremely good, especially with the drippings from the roasted chicken I made poured over top. Chili night will officially be followed by cornbread stuffing and roast chicken night in our house from now on!

I made this for a Christmas dinner. Everyone raved about the stuffing and said it was the best ever. I took suggestions from others, skipped the prunes, doubled the apricots and added toasted pecans. I did toast the cornbread cubes in the oven. Also I did stuff the bird, not bake separately. I'll definitely use this recipe again and again.

This was a light and welcomed stuffing at Thanksgiving. I deleted the prunes and substituted raisins. Also, I used fresh thyme and added fresh sage. I made enough that I froze a 9" casserole of it. At Christmas I added more chicken broth, baked it and served with roast pork. Tasted great!

Delicious. Dad had second serving and then I told him there were apricots in it. :) Then told him I omitted the prunes. Decided to leave out the fact that I substituted golden raisins for them and that there were apples in it. Easy. Well worth making the cornbread recipe on this site.

I couldn't find the corn bread recipe as well until I found you can just click on the words "Buttery conrn bread in the ingredients list for this recipe and it takes you to the corn bread recipe.

For anyone who tried this recipe - I would like to know where the cornbread recipe is? I don't see it. How much cornbread is needed? Thanks for the help!

This will become our traditional Thanksgiving stuffing. It was ideal for the vegetarians in family, as I could substitute vegetable broth for the chicken broth. Also agreed with others in eliminating prunes, and substituting golden raisins and more apricots. Also agreed that fennel was too pervasive; I used very little, but will probably eliminate next year. Also could use some sage, if desired. Used Buttery Cornbread recipe, but will probably try to lighten the cornbread next year, as all that butter was probably not necessary for the final product.

This went over very well on Thanksgiving. I used some olive oil instead of butter, used sage instead of fennel and added some sausage. It was very tasty and everyone enjoyed it.

This was a big hit across the board at my Thanksgiving dinner! I made a few changes, I cut the butter in half, which was key I think! I also substituted cinnamon for fennel seeds because I didn't have any fennel seeds. It was delicious. I did a 1:1 substitution. I also used 18 prunes and 18 apricots, which I would definitely do again. Big hit!!

I made some adjustments: Used only 2 tbsp butter, omitted the celery, added pecans, peeled the apples, reversed the proportions of the prunes and apricots, and reduced the fennel seeds to 1/2 tsp. This is a good base recipe with lots of variations possible. I recommend Cali apricots, not turkish ones - too mushy.

I loved this recipe but made a few changes to accomodate what I had on hand. First, I used my leftover sourdough along with the cornbread. I also used raisins instead of prunes, and left out the fennel seeds. Next, I only used 3 TBL butter, since a stick just seemed like too much. It came out delicious and I will definitely make this again.

If you don't have time to dry the bread overnight, just slice it and put it in a low oven and turn the slices over once. This is truly delicious, the fruit is not overpowering and the texture of the cornbread is quite nice.

I personally have hated stuffing my entire life. I substituted raisins for the prunes, and the stuffing was very good, light, yet moist. I'm giving the 4 forks in anticipation of the next time I'll make this. . . when I'll substitute cinnamon for the extremely pervasive flavor of the fennel.

I made this recipe for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I made one change, though: I added sage and didn't use fennel (I'm not a big fan) and it tasted wonderful.

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. I omitted the prunes and used double the apricots. I also added toasted walnuts as others have suggested. I used Fuji apples because that was what I had on hand. I will definitely be cooking this again next year.

this was the first time I've made cornbread dressing and it was delicious! I will certainly be making it again. I loved that it was moist but not mushy.

I just love it when a recipe has the room to experiment and throw in other ingredients. I was especially pleased that this recipe allowed me to use up just what I needed to use up from my cabinets/fridge w/o having to buy lots of special ingredients. I only had to buy the fennel seeds, really! My modifications included: omitting the prunes, adding a handful of golden raisins instead, and using 2 cups chicken broth since my variety of breads were very stale. I used white, wheat, apple tea bread, and cornbread muffins. It came out excellent and was a big hit at Thanksgiving!!!

Loved the recipe--it was perfect! Not only was it a big hit at Thanksgiving, but it used up almost everything in my fridge/cabinets that I'd been meaning to use up (celery, apples, stale bread, dried apricots, etc). My modifications: Omitted prunes and added walnuts, as per suggestions in other reviews. Also added a small handful of golden raisins that went nicely with the apricots. I ended up using two cups of chicken broth since my bread was extra stale, and I used a mix of breads--white, wheat, apple tea bread and old corn muffins. I just love it when a recipe makes it easy for you to experiment and add what you need to use up instead of being wasteful and having to go out and buy extra ingredients. The only thing I had to buy was the fennel seeds! Magnifique!

I made the recipe with only one alteration, I used 18 prunes and 18 dried apricots. It was spectacular. The whole family loved the flavor pairings in the "Smaller Thanksgiving" menu.

I'm a big cornbread dressing fan and I wanted a bit of variation with my old recipe. I did not use the prunes and just used extra dried apricots. I also added a roll of sage recipe pork sausage for a savory element. I also cut the cornbread with some cubed day old sourdough bread. This stuffing was a big hit. It is now my new cornbread dressing. On the fennel seeds, I cracked them in a mortar and pestle to a powder instead of the whole seeds. Superb blend of flavors!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. Wonderful flavors. Might need to adjust the liquid a bit depending on how dry your cornbread is.

I might make this recipe again. However I would ditch the prunes. Didn't like the flavor. Also, like the last cook, I would add pecans.

A huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner - would give it 3 1/2 stars. The cornbread on it's own is delicious. Only change I might make would be to add toasted pecans. A yummy dish!!!!

This is a great recipe for gluten free eaters! You must make the cornbread from a gluten free recipe, however, and not the one they suggest on the menu. It's quite good though and a nice change from the ordinary!
