Further proof that often simplicity is best. I used escarole and endive for my version (no frisée on hand). The sautée brought out the bitter lettuces' subtle buttery notes, which were perfectly complemented by a splash of lemon. I paired this dish with a slice of whole-grain bread, a hunk of Romano, and a glass of chardonnay.
