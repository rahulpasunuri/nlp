I have the original recipe, clipped 15+ years ago from Bon Appetit. Summer staple in my house. Perfect as is. The kids who don't like veggies eat this one, too.

This will be a new staple in my house. I though the zucchini alone sounded a bit boring, so I added red peppers and corn, and it really added some much needed texture. I also threw in about twice as much garlic, a pinch more oregono, a teaspoon of salt, a bit of cheddar and wrapped it up in a whole wheat tortilla. It turned out fantastic!

We made this as a main with yellow rice on the side and loved it! Great for a healthy weeknight dinner (we used reduced fat cheese to up the health factor). The garlic adds great flavor, and it was oh so easy.

We love this dish. So easy to make when you need a vegetable.

This is a terrific dish. The salsa, garlic and zucchini were a perfect blend. Used a lime and garlic salsa cause we are garlic lovers. This will be added to the menu regularly.

Even my zucchini-loving husband didn't like this one. The salsa just seemed wrong with the vegetable.

This dish is so good I can almost eat the whole thing. It has a complexity of flavor that belies its simplicity. I think the secret is in the quality of the salsa, so be sure to use the best you can find.

Easy, quick, delicious, my kind of dish!
