Wow, this was excellent! I could not stop eating the sauce out of the pan even after I was stuffed. I think this is good enough to be one of their Blue Ribbon recipes. Per others' suggestions I used almonds instead of hazelnuts, canned roasted tomato and served with roasted potatoes and sauteed spinach. Will absolutely be making this again..easy and delicious!

Yummy! Definitely tasty but I think the sauce could have used a little something else... the hazelnut makes it a tad bland. Still definitely worth making - just needs some more cayanne or something, maybe some canned tomato or tomato paste? Lovely with the halibut.

Apparently there was a reason I bookmarked this recipe over a year and a half ago! I can't believe I waited so long to make this! Delish! I substituted grape tomatoes and almonds as that was what I had on hand. So good! The sauce makes about twice as much as is needed for the amount of fish and potato - but that's fine because this sauce would be great with pretty much any kind of meat, poultry or seafood. I will be making this again!

We had this for a Lenten dinner party. I am less than a fan of fish. I am now a fan of Halibut and have made the dish twice. I subbed the roasted red bell peppers but found the piquillo peppers better since they are not so sweet. They had no heat to them either. You can adjust that with the cayenne. An exceptional dish.

Made this recipe for dinner tonight and it is absolutely a keeper! For the romesco sauce I used almonds instead of hazlenuts. I used canned fire roasted tomotoes, and roasted red bell peppers instead of piquillo peppers, as was suggested by previous reviewers. I'm glad i didn't use piquillo peppers, as the spicyness was perfect without them. You really get the smokyness of the paprika, so definately don't use regular paprika. I agree that the sauce would work for chicken, pork, or on pasta. This sauce is just bursting with flavor. I loved the texture from the almonds. WOW! Served with rice pilaf and asparagus. Definately try it.

This is a keeper. Have substituted various fish,almonds for the hazelnuts and regular roasted red peppers for the piquillo.VERY good

This sauce is exceptional! I substituted cod as halibut was not available. Roasted red peppers make an easy substitute for the piquillo peppers. Canned fire-roasted tomatoes, drained, are a time saver for roasting your own tomatoes. I made this recipe with the roasted onions with blue cheese. Delicious. If you do make both "from scrath," put the tomatoes in at the same time to roast.

This was terrific. We used lemon cod which was a very good match for the flavors.

The Romesco Sauce is outstanding. I've made it 4 times in the last 6 months. I've eliminated the piquillo peppers everytime and it is still marvelous. I can eat it like peanut butter with a spoon right out of the food processor. The smoked parika is a must and should not be substituted.

Followed exactly and loved the results. Will definitely make again.

I couldn't find piquillo peppers at out Wegmans so I did a touch of chipotle in adobo. I also like to keep the charred tomato skin after hitting 'em up in the broiler. It's also a great sauce to use on some pasta.

This is the best recipe I have ever made in all my (many) years using epicurious recipes. The meaty halibut, spicy romesco sauce, and potatoes (I roasted them) come together beautifully. I paired the dish with sauteed spinach too. I used almonds instead of hazelnuts and increased the smoked paprika and cayenne for more kick. The sauce is great with any fish, seafood, or chicken. This is a new family favorite!

Romesco sauce was definately tasty but the fish was a little too meaty for the sauce. May I suggest a lighter white fish?

Delicious! Made this for christmas and everyone raved about it. Very easy to make... I'm going to make it again tonight! The small amount of butter is not needed and I'm going to make it without it for a healthier version.

The romesco sauce is divine! I made this recipe with salmon instead of halibut and it worked out beautifully. For a vegetarian option, the sauce would be perfect with pasta or even to use as a dip or condiment. I will make this many times again!

I used marcona almonds instead of hazelnuts with wonderful results. Roast potatoes with whole garlic cloves. One of the best halibut recipes anyplace

I never had Romesco sauce before, so I was happy to experience the taste, character and texture. Roasted Hazelnuts are superb in this dish and smoked paprika is awesome.

This is absolutely delicious. We used halibut, but any white fish would be fabulous - next time we'll try it with cod. The sauce is out of this world!

This was good, but I would not use potatoes next time. The romesco sauce however is to die for! I also substituted shrimp, rather than halibut because I had some on hand.
