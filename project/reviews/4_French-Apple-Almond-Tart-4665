Divine, first-rate tart.There is nothing difficult about preparing this tart except it does take time. Making the crust and filling in advance can save you the day of baking. ( I wish I had prepared enough space in my 'fridge for the 11" tart pan.) No Calvados but pear brandy was fine. Served seconds to eight adults.

Rating: 4
Yes, the crust is testy to make, I should of read more reviews and tried the freeze n' shred method! Also, only use tart apples; I used apples on hand, one of which was not tart and it could not stand up to the filling or contrast as the tart apples could. I used Applejack brandy but I don't think the flavor was as distinctive as Calvados would of been. Lovely and professional presentation.

My "go to" recipe for catering dinner parties or special occasions when a tart is needed for dessert..the calvados is a must...lovely pastry,great flavour combination with the almond filling

Rating: 2
I expected to like this more than I did. Somehow it came out to a little less than the sum of its parts. I thought the alcohol was a little too noticeable, and the almond filling overpowered the apples. I'll be going back to the classic; just a nice pate sucree crust, apples, a little sugar and a light glaze.

This is an all time favourite - just a fabulous flavour and looks like it just came from the patisserie. Rolling the pastry is easy between two sheets of plastic wrap - this also helps getting 14" into the pan without breaking. Have never had a failure over the many times it's been made at our house.

I very lightly toasted the almonds and added a touch of lemon zest as the green apples were not all that tart. Individual tart pans and a flower pattern on top created with apple slices made a pretty presentation. Satisfying but not heavy or overly sweet. Good reviews.

Rating: 4
Unbelievably delicious! I made this just as the recipe is written. It is without a doubt the best apple tart I have ever made and rivals any in a French bakery. I used the 11-inch tart pan and the almond to apple ratio was perfect. The crust was a little difficult to roll out and fit into the pan but I used a bit more flour and then patched the holes and tears. Folding the edge down to make a double edge crust was a wonderful idea and I will try it the next time I am making a blind-baked pie shell. When I sliced the apples as directed I wound up with more than enough to cover the top so I tucked the extra slices into the existing pattern; that made it much more sculptural in design and added to the appearance. My guests raved and my husband has asked every day since when I am going to make another one.

Delicious! When I make it again, i'll use a bit less butter in the filling (there will still be plenty of butter) -- but this is an excellent, special dessert. The apricot glaze really makes it.

Rating: 4
Love this recipe! I used a 9" tart pan and should have definitely used an 11" to spread the filling thinner and not have an overwhelmingly almond taste with every bite. Any suggestions on how to cut the pie so that the apples dont cave in and become messy? I used a very sharp butcher knife which helped the second time, but is there a trick..?

One of the best desserts I have made on this site--and I have made many. I have both rolled out the dough and pressed it in with my fingers. I don't see a difference. I have added accidentally too much Calvados to the crust, chilled the dough for only 15 minutes--it always comes out perfect. It is hard to mess this one up.

This is the perfect apple tart. I've made this many times and it has been met with rave reviews. I once made it for two male friends and they ended up finishing the entire tart in one sitting.

Rating: 4
For the people who think there needs to be an altered ratio of almond paste to apple, maybe you're not using the right pan... this is a tart, not a pie. I think the ratio is fine, the paste is a thin layer, no more than a quarter inch thick.... are you sure you're using an 11 inch tart pan? This recipe is sensational! The only thing I added was a pinch of cinnanmon, a pinch of nutmeg, and a pinch of cloves to the crust mixture ( I felt like adding some spice for the fall!). Can't wait to make it again!

Rating: 3
I agree that the ratio is a little off. Next time I will 1/2 the almond paste and double the apples and apricot jam.

This was the best thing I've EVER tasted. Thanks so much for putting it on here.

Rating: 3
Hmm. . . I've made this many times, and initially, I found it to be the best recipe ever, as others on this site do. But it has never turned out as well as the first time. There is just too much almond past to fruit ratio, even when I use a quiche pan so I can pile it high with apples. My recommendation would be to use 1/2 to 1/3 the paste. And the full amount, if not more, of apples.

Rating: 4
I have been so inspired by Julia Childs autobiography "My Life in France", that I wanted a French Apple Tart and I wanted it yesterday. So I had to make it with what I had on hand; which was Triple Sec instead of Calvados and strawberry jam instead of apricot. And it was fabulous. I can't wait to make it again with the correct ingredients! However, next time I will process the almonds longer so that the almond filling is more creamy instead of grainy.

Rating: 4
I don't know that this tart needs anymore rave reviews but here's my added 2 cents on how fantastic it was! made it for mothers day and it was amazing. Next time I don't know that I would fridge the dough - or at least will do for shorter time. Was easier to work with after it was out for a little bit. I rolled the dough into a log and cut into 6 portions and used smaller tart pans. I would also recommend pushing down and out in pan rather than rolling. Otherwise I won't change a thing and know I'll make many more times!

Rating: 3
Very nice tart. Definitely soak the apples for a long time...we soaked for over one hour and the flavor was good. Used half whole-wheat for the crust, but wouldn't necessarily recommend that...seemed to slightly compete with the almond paste and the almonds. The paste layer was pretty thin, so one might use 1.5X that layer. Overall, a very nice, simple, and pretty light dessert.

Rating: 4
Outstanding! Only change I made was to make these in 4 mini-tart pans with removeable bottoms. There was extra almond paste, although it is so good, next time I will make that layer thicker! This is delicious. Not too sweet, perfect!!!! Definately soak the apples in calvados for 1+ hours. The longer the better. I didnt put dough in processor (did it by hand) and it came out just perfect. Will be making for Xmas too!!!

Rating: 3
I loved the taste of this tart but was disappointed by the texture of the almond paste. I asked my pastry chef friend for some advice and she suggested first doing just the almonds and sugar in the food processor, thus allowing for a better, smoother paste. Maybe my food processor wasn't up to the job, but I'm hoping for a much less gritty almond paste next time around. Otherwise, loved it!

I give this 4 forks!!!!! Everyone at Thanksgiving raved about it!!! I have an entire pumpkin pie sitting in my fridge!!!! I had no problem rolling out the dough and did take the chef's suggestion of using the Calvados and apple jelly......a must!!!! My children have requested I make this dessert for Christmas!!!! This is a very easy recipe to make and recommend you try it today...I did not see the need for cooking it 8 hours prior to serving...next time I will make it the day before....I may even try making tartletts in muffin pans...not sure how long to cook it.....

I give this 4 forks as well. My 16 year-old son made this tart for Thanksgiving dessert, along with baking two pumpkin pies. The tart was a huge hit. It will definitely become a new Thanksgving tradition. It's excellent for breakfast too. My Great Aunt Ella says, "This tart would be good 24 hours a day."

Rating: 4
Out of all the recipes that I've tried on this website, I would give this one FIVE forks if that rating were available. This is the only, and I repeat ONLY, tart that I bake that my family requests annually during the Thanksgiving/Christmas holiday season. I've been making it since it appeared on the cover of Bon Appetit magazine in 1997. One of the best tarts out there. The longer that you let it sit, the more "potent" that it becomes. I use Calvados or even Courvosier as the liquor and it is fabulous. Time-consuming to make the apples overlap and look all fancy like in the photo on the magazine cover, but not as much work as it appears. The crust is good as well, I haven't had problems as were noted with other cooks. I also don't roll it out first, but press it into the tart pan and up the sides with my fingers. Takes longer and probably not "correct", but I've found that it keeps the crust from falling apart while you are working. Make this tart and people will rave. We enjoy it topped with either cinnamon-spiced whipped cream or Calvados-flavored whipped cream or even just plain. Mmmmm, I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful tart. Based on other reviews, I expected problems with the crust, but everything went perfectly smoothly. I was also afraid that the Calvados might be overwhelming because it was in the crust, filling, apples, and glaze, but it was wonderful. I must admit I was a little disappointed in the flavor and texture of the crust (I am highly critical of these things), but everyone else seemed to love it. I really liked the almond paste recipe and will use it for other desserts, I'm sure.

I made this for my Classical cuisine culinary arts class final and the French chef loved it. He said is was exactly what French pastry should taste like. I made tartlets, dividing the recipe parts into 4-6, depending on the size of your tartlet pans. It is easy to follow, and delicious.

Rating: 3
I was very satisfied with this tart...very delicious and impressive ~ loved the crust, filling, & apples. Made it exactly as written. I also had trouble with the crust. I ended up just plopping it all in the tart pan and pressing it into place using my fingers (although in hindsight using the bottom of a measuring cup dipped in flour, as I've seen in other recipe instructions, would be a good idea, too). This worked very well and I will use the same method when I make it again. Allow yourself plenty of time....this has lots of steps and wait times. I was still working on it when my guests arrived. It was good warm, though, with lightly whipped cream.

Rating: 3
I thought I would try this dessert with pears, as that combination is even more classically "french". Don't bother- this tarte really needs the zingy acidity of apples to give it a lift, IMO. Even so, my guests (who had never tried it with apples) freaked out over how amazing it was. Everyone was already stuffed full of food like beached whales, but nobody left a bite of this dessert on their plate! I suggest serving it with a warm pool of custard, instead of whipped cream, etc. And I second the suggestion of adding a tiny bit of lemon zest to the crust, too.

Rating: 4
This tart was absolutely delectable! I used store-bought pastry dough and did everything else pretty much according to the recipe and it came out perfect (super easy too!). I used 6 small granny smith apples and that was the perfect amount of apples. This is now my husband's favorite tart...

This tart will make anyone look like an experienced pastry chef! Presentation is exceptional, and the taste is great. Even the crust got lots of compliments. I wouldn't call this recipe easy considering it took me over three hours to make, but there wasn't anything overtly complicated about it. One thing I'd do differently when I re-make it is to let the apples sit a bit longer in the brandy, or use more of it! Overall - fantastic recipe.

Rating: 4
This is easy and great! To make the pastry dough better, I added some lemon zest and cinnamon to it, and suprisingly, that little addition makes a big difference. For a little extra kick you can also add amaretto to the almond filling. The dough can be made ahead of time and kept frozen. Also, this recipe is even better with pears instead of apples.

This tart was a gastronomical wonder. I'm a college student and not an experienced cook (this was my first tart) and it turned out perfectly. The apples arranged on the top look very professional. I made it for my family and they actually *took pictures* of it. I tried the freeze and shred method and it worked fairly well (make sure to freeze it very solid), but I think it would work by rolling as well. Also, I took one reviewer's suggestion of putting a flat pan under the tart pan to prevent drips. this dessert is absolutely delicious with homemade cinnamon ice cream. I highly recommend making this dish!

Okay... I love this tart and I've made it time and time again, but I only gave the recipe 2 forks because of the way it's written. Be very careful when making the filling. The author included quantities for topping the tart on the list for the actual filling (i.e. sugar, calvados, and butter). I've made the mistake of putting all in the food processor only to discover that some of those ingredients were suppose to be set aside for finishing off the topping. You end up with a very liquidy filling that doesn't set very well. Just be careful and you will get great results. This is such a classic French dessert that is really impressive!

I made this recipe with pears and it was absolutely fabulous. I did not use brandy in the crust and used it just in the almond filling. It was wonderful.

I made a crust from the Pear and Hazelnut Frangipane recipe-gourmet NOV 2001 (from this site). Then used this filling with peacans instead of almonds (for Thanksgiving). And served with Vanilla Ice cream. All I can say is wow, great dessert, I am sure the almonds are great, but if you like peacans try them also, they were great with the apples. Crust from other recipe is very crisp, easy to make and buttery although it sounds like this crust was also quite good from the other reviews. However, I will make this again and stick with other crispy crust!

There's a fear of making pies in my family, but I was willing to try a tart (I'm a sucker for tart crusts). I also love almond filling--and I had just gone apple picking.

I was concerned the dough wouldn't come together in the processor, but it did after a few seconds. A HUGE hit at thanksgiving! Looked very professional.

This recipe has special meaning to me because a very good friend and I spent one afternoon making it, sharing laughs and food memories, and finally sharing the delicious results of our labor. It turned out so beautifully that we even took photographs to share with friends who couldn't be there to taste it for themselves. This would eventually influence my decision to persue a career in cooking. When she recently lost her fight with cancer I made it again to remember her and the great times we shared. From now on, every Autumn when the apples are at their best and the air is crisp, I'll make it again.

Excellent recipe!!! Both the baking time and temperature worked flawlessly...my suggestion to those who had problems with them is to have their ovens recalibrated and/or use an oven thermometer to adjust the oven control accordingly -- a miscalibrated oven is a major problem for many home bakers! I substituted whole-wheat pastry flour for the all-purpose for a nuttier (and healthier) crust. I used 5 different kinds of sturdy baking apples for diversity of taste and texture, and I substituted apple jelly for the apricot preserves to "preserve" the "apple-ness" integrity of the tart. The Calvados is a "must" for the same reason. Also, instead of rolling out and fumbling with the delicate tart dough, freeze or chill it until very hard, use a large grater to grate the dough into the tart pan and press the grated dough into the bottom and up the sides with the heel of your palm -- not rolling out the dough prevents it from being overworked and therefore results in a more tender crust!

Rating: 4
This is definelty a keeper.I slightly mofified the recipe.I omitted the Calvados in the crust, and reducted it in the filling to 1 tbsp.I aslo added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the apple mixture.
