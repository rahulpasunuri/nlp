I would've preferred to give it 2.5 forks. I admit, I didn't have all the ingredients. I was unable to find candied oranges at any grocery store including Whole Paycheck and didn't have time to make them myself. I think that would've pushed this into 3 forks. It's a simple recipe, moist, no oil or butter & relatively healthy. I will make sure to make some candied oranges to have on hand to make this recipe really work.

I am completely wrong, no raw eggs. I don't know what I thought I read. No way to delete a comment that I can find on the site. Sorry.

I've been lurking around this recipe hoping for more reviews. It has raw eggs in the filling, so I am wary about it. Any ideas welcome.

I tryed this recipe and though it was not easy to make it was deliciously. Thie mixture of pumpkin, nuts and oranges makes this a feel good treat!
