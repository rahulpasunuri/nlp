No where is there anchovy Paste!! this was easy, light and ever so yummy. I had made Homemade Ravioli, with homemade Ricotta. I had about a cup non seasoned left over. Searched for a dessert with Ricotta, I had all the ingredients. Except Lemons, substituted Orange peel. The homemade ricotta is so creamy, I love this because it's not so sweet.

Very mediocre. I must have done something wrong.

Why does this recipe call for frying pate choux? The puffs will be much lighter and healthier if baked as usual. Nice simple filling, however.

If you read carefully, I believe that it simply states that anchovy pasta is another dish separate from this one. Hello!

Description says to use anchovy pasta which sounds like a very strange ingredient for this dish. List of ingredients doesn't list anchovy pasta. Anyone make this dessert dish w/ anchovy pasta???

I didn't bother with frying the puffs, just bought some fresh from the bakery! The filling is yummy and would taste great with croissant brioches as well. Easy, quick and worth trying.
