Although this recipe is not a stunner - it was perfect for what I was looking for. I think it added a hint of flavor to white rice. I didn't want it to overpower my main dishes but I didn't want boring white - I will definitly make this again.

I followed this recipe, but it turned out flavorless!!! I think you need to use a lot more ginger because this just tasted like plain rice. Very disappointing.

I lolve this rice. I have made it several times with basmati. You do need to cook it more like 15 minutes (or more). Use a rice cooker to take away the guesswork. It definitely needs salt, but once it's salted, it's great. No need for a sauce.

I love ginger but it didn't help this recipe. 12 minutes is not nearly enough cooking time for medium grain rice (I used Kokoho Rose) and 3 cups of water is a little too much. The rice was too wet.
