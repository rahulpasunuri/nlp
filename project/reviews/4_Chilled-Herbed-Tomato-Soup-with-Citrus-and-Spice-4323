I've made this several times. It is always a huge hit. It's refreshing and an amazing combination of flavors. A few times I've also left some of the tomato pieces in chunks to give it a different texture. An absolute favorite!

This is the perfect basis for a light summer dinner on a hot day. Use only fresh herbs. I skipped the vodka because we have kids, but I can't imagine it could have been improved. I served it with open-face grilled cheese sandwiches on fresh home-made bread. Absolutely delicious and refreshing!

This soup was fantastic (both hot & cold). I served it for my gourmet dinner club and they loved it. I added a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and it was a nice kick at the end. I would make this again. I think I would also serve it w/ goat cheese croutons - mmmmmm. Would freeze great for a quick dinner too.

this was a very good chilled soup; easy to make with some nice subtleties in flavor. next time i'm going to search hard for sodium-free canned tomatos; i thought that the salt in the canned tomatos overpowered the delicate citrus flavors in the soup. also, i ran it through the blender before straining (to get more mileage -- unexpected dinner guests). yielded a lot more and surely didn't do anything to the taste.

PERFECT FOR A WARM SUMMER EVENING SUPPER. ADDED A SMALL DOLLUP OF SOUR CREAM AND FRESHLY MADE GARLIC BREAD CRUMBS.
