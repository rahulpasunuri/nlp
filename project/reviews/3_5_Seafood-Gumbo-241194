I've made this 3 times and it is consistently delicious. I omit oysters and bacon (use bacon grease for roux) add frozen crawfish tails and andouille. My ONLY complaint is that, with these modifications, it is one expensive pot of deliciousness!

This was a big disappointment. Despite all the roux, the resulting gumbo was very thin (I thickened it twice after the original roux) and rather uni-dimensional. It was hot from the cayenne, but had no depth of flavor.

Great recipe. I modified it by taking out the oysters since my husband is not a fan, and added scallops, canned clams, and a pieced of chuncked halibut. I also added the meat of two hot italian sausages and a half a cup of brown rice. I found it gave the recipe more body, and it needed a bit more spice to it.

Awesome gumbo. Everyone loved it. Didn't get thick enough for my tastes though. The bacon added a rich flavor. We omitted the oysters, and added andouille sausage. YUM!!!

Be careful with the bay leaf. I used a whole California bay leaf and the whole dish tasted like a tree. Next time I'm only using 1/4 of a North Carolina bayleaf.

I had never made a gumbo before and I loved how this turned out. I used fresh okra which I think is much better if you can find it. You won't be sorry when making this but it is very time consuming.

I LOVE this gumbo recipe! I have made it five times and it is often requested by my family. I omit the oysters but add in a few andouille sausages to the recipe. YUM!

I found this recipe to be very easy to make (gumbo can be tricky) and adapt to taste. Personally, I'd at least double the cayenne pepper, maybe throw in some Louisiana hot sauce or something for that extra kick. I also added some bay scallops to the mix. A last recommendation: after adding the crab meat, work the gumbo around a bit to break up the lumps and some of the okra. It thickens the soup and keeps the fishy taste of the crab down if you're like me and live in a place where very fresh seafood is hard to come by.

Very delicious. It took about 25 minutes to make the roux which was a bit of a pain, but ultimately worth it. Used a little butter instead of the bacon and a lb of bay scallops instead of the oysters, no crab at all, but I bet the crab meat would have been great. Nonetheless, it was very delicious everybody loved it. Don't forget the good basmati rice.

I used this recipe as a basis - since I've been cooking for so long, I guestimate when I use ingredients. I didn't have the bacon, so I used butter with the oil, and then added some sausage later. I used a bag of frozen peppers, 2 onions and some finely chopped chicken breasts. The rest was pretty much the same. It was INCREDIBLE. I can't stop thinking about it. It's going on my list of amazing recipes.

The only thing we did differently was to add some Andouille sausage and love it. Not too think, and not too thin. Perfect for a snowy Sunday in Chicago.

One additional note: I find file to be odd stuff. While, I like to keep recipes authentic, file makes me genuinely sick to my stomach when I add it - kinda tastes like a mix between seaweed and a dirty fish tank.

Overall, this is a good recipe. I find making the roux takes practice and patience - there is no way to speed it up. Be careful when cooking the bacon, and do not burn it, or you will end up with tiny bits of carbon in the roux, and ultimately, the gumbo. Also, I would stop cooking the roux a few minutes before it reaches your desired color, as it continues to brown as you cook your onions, etc. (A friend of mine, a professional chef from Louisiana, recommends making a bunch of roux at once, taking the time to do it right, and then freezing it for later use.) In my opinion, thyme is the major player here in regards to the herbal ingredients. If your gumbo does not taste like 'gumbo' I suggest adding more...

This recipe was a great example of gumbo but if you want an amazing gumbo recipe then go to the creole/cajun recipe page at gumbopages.com. The creator of the site (Chuck Taggart) is a native New Orleanian and knows how to cook. I have tried numerous creole/cajun recipes from his site and all are authentic and delicious. Chuck's Gumbo Du Monde takes a little more work than this due to the fact that he insists you make your own stock but it is completely worth it. My mom ate gumbo her entire life while growing up near Houston, TX and she proclaimed Chuck's recipe to be the best she has ever tasted the first time I made it.

First time making gumbo and I thought this turned out well. I knew to make the roux darker than "a shade darker than peanut butter" (thank you, Top Chef) added Shiracha chili sauce to spice it up a bit and a seafood mix of shrimp, crab, mussels, scallops, etc. skipped the bacon and used canola oil, but it was just fine.

Had to add triple seasoning, make the roux extra dark, added sausage for flavor...pretty much had to add things to this recipe for it not to taste flat. Was very watery until I added a touch of white rice, extra roux and more protein. I suggest a different recipe...my own result was fabulous but you shouldn't have to add that much to a recipe to make it good...

Marvelous. My very first gumbo (and first time making a roux). I watched a video on how to make roux before I did this; it came out quite good. Oysters were not available, so I used scallops. I thought the crabmeat overpowered the shrimp and scallops, might not use it next time. And maybe more okra. I personally did not think both okra and file over-thickened it. Everybody needs to try a making this or some other gumbo, at least once in their lives. Definitely worth the time and effort.

We made the roux very dark and used chicken stock. Very good. Sprinkling a little file on top put the finishing touch on the dish. For measurers out there: Celery and pepper are 1 cup each; Onion was about 1.5 cups.

I found that then seafood was much better the day after it was made. The flavor was much more lively.

word on paul's review. The roux is where it's at for the gumbo. If you start this out thinking that you're going to make a 'soup' I think you need to research a little more into gumbo and what it's really all about. Basically the difference between gumbo and jambalaya is the thickener, the okra and file (not to mention the roux). So this could be good news to you, if you didn't make the gumbo according to plans, just name it jambalaya and call it a day.

apparently you[northlakest]don't know how to make a roux or a gumbo.If you did you wouldn't be berating someones recipe, you would be giving your opinion on how it works better by adding or deleting ingredients,cooking time,temperature etc.

I enjoyed this very much! I used the okra not the file' and simmered in my crockpot. Was delicious!

This is a great recipe but please do not add file' when using okra. The okra is a thickening agent and does not need any other thickening. You use file' only with gumbos that use no okra such as chicken and sausage.

A whole lot of work for a watery gumbo. My hat is off to anyone who can make a peanut butter colored roux in 20 minutes over medium-low heat. Get real.

I tried to roll over four forks, but couldnt get the screen to respond. So, I wanted to say that it is clearly a four-star recipe. I have eaten and made gumbo on the Gulf Coast for almost sixty years. This recipe is among the best I have ever tasted. It is amazing.
