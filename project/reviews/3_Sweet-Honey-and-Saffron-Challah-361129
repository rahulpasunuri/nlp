As this recipe stands, do not take challah. If doubled then take challah and say the blessing.

Para 5 has a "typo" -- there is an extra para (first few lines) that obviously go to another recipe. This recipe is good (w/one cure-able flaw) but but prob could be better. First, a dash of salt is not going to be nearly enough, unless you use salted margarine, which is neover a reliable way to salt a recipe. use unsalted margarine and 1 Tablespoon kosher salt. Were I to make this again, I'd add yellow raisins or maybe even dried cherries....could be a nice fit w/the saffron. The saffron flavor is nice, but not too extreme (same is true of the honey flavor). A good, solid challah recipe (and unusual method, w/the sponge -- never seen that in a challah recipe), but adding more salt is essential.
