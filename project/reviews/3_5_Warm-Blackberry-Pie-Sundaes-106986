DElicious!!! I made these for a BBQ last night with friends and got RAVE reviews. Blackberries were going for $5 for a half pint in my local market, so I scrimped a little and used frozen...still delish - - though I think I would cut down slightly on the OJ next time when using frozen as my sauce was a bit soupy. The topping really does taste like blackberry pie though. I used some scottish shortbread which held its texture nicely, and also used a slow churned fro yo in lieu of ice cream...I'll be using the leftover topping in some plain yogurt as a antioxidant packed snack!

Tried this tonight with strawberries (I've done it before with blackberries) and I have to say it turned out great. I didn't even have orange peel available. Thumbs up.

The perfect dessert for summer entertaining - it's incredibly easy, the berry sauce can be made ahead, and it looks gorgeous. Fantastic also with blueberries instead of blackberries (don't puree them, though).

I have made this three times now, once with regular old shortbread cookies, and twice with really good quality shortbreads, and I have to say the good quality cookies really make this dish. Sounds unlikely but it's true. I've also used frozen berries and think it's just as good as fresh.

Made exactly as written except that I used frozen blackberries. This one is a winner and looked beautiful and everyone really liked it. Keeper.

I know it seems silly to award four forks to a dessert with store-bought ice cream and cookies (I used Haagen-Dazs vanilla ice cream the first time and frozen yogurt this time and I think it's even better with that, and English shortbread for sturdier bits, per other reviewers' suggestions), but the sauce is so delicious, and the mixture so much more than the sum of its parts, that I want everyone to know about it! Frozen unsweetened blackberries work fine, but do use fresh orange juice (you need zest anyway). The color of the sundae is just gorgeous. What a yummy dessert, do try it.

This is way too good to be so easy. I don't even crumble the cookies, just serve them on the side. The topping is delicious on pancakes, cheesecake, just about anything. I've even used frozen berries when the ones in the produce section were less than ideal. This is one of my favorite recipes on this site.

I made this recipe as stated, except I added about one half cup of Chambord liquer. It is a blackberry liquer. OUTSTANDING. My guests loved it. If you are fortunate enough to have any left over, it can be frozen for use at a later date.

My guests were very enthusiastic about this dessert and the "topping" in particular. Made for a light but engaging conlcusion to a bbq. I found the shortcake "crust" a little lacking from both a taste and texture perspective. I think I'll try to use a graham cracker and butter crumble the next time around.

I have now made this several times. I must admit, I was biased as I am a pie baker and am a snob about homemade pie crusts, BUT, this was sooo delicious and yes easy! So, when you have already spent a lot of time on the rest of the meal, this is a delicious ending. Everyone always wants seconds. Also, if you want you can make ahead and then rewarm the sauce before serving. By the way, be sure to use good quality vanilla ice cream to do this justice!

Here in the Pacific Northwest I used wild blackberries for this dish, amazingly, my husband likes this even better than the blackberry pie I usually make with them. Fabulous!

Yummy! I love blackberries and this dessert is just delicious. I halved the recipe and used extra chunky bits of thick shortbread cookies. I could definitely see serving this at my next dinner party.

Absolutely fantastic! So easy to make and so elegant to serve. My family loved it and it took only10 minutes to make! I will serve this at my next dinner party.

My husband can't stand the -berries (black, ras, blue...) because of the seeds. Does anyone know if this would taste good with something like peaches? p.s. Don: get a life and QUIT yelling (which is what you are doing when everything is in all caps)!

Hey Don, are you still out there?

This was pretty easy and tasty. My husband said it was 'restaurant quality'; I thought it was pretty good too, but not rave-worthy. It does get top marks for presentation: the colour of the syrup against the vanilla ice cream is striking and perfect in the summer. I strained the syrup as I don't like all the pulpy bits, and saved some of the berries to top the ice cream. With the leftover, I used it on crepes the next morning. It was a nice change from maple syrup and made the crepes look very festive, especially with a sprinkling of icing sugar.

This sauce was delicious but I have to admit that I used frozen blackberries as my store didn't have fresh and I didn't have time to run around. Left the cookies in larger pieces so they wouldn't disappear and make more of a crust. My family raved about it as we had just returned from vacation and yearned for some home-cooked food. Would be wonderful over plain cheesecake too.

Yummy! Easy, too!

YUMMM! This was not hard to make and was tasty. We used the leftover blackberry sauce the following day over waffles.

I thought this recipe was really good and very easy. I took it to a dinner party and got tons of compliments. Lighten up all you food critics out there

Hey Don I'm wondering...did ya grow your own blackberries, make your own icecream, or is it just the cookies you have a problem with? I liked this recipe, I sprinkled half the cookies on top so they would not all get soggy.

Unless you're baking, almost any recipe is adaptable to your likes. I blended blackberries, blueberries and raspberries with a delicious result with this recipe...also used the store bought cookies, but left them in bigger chunks. I'd really like to see more positive comments on how recipes are adapted for a different result instead of some of the negative sometimes insulting comments being made. For some of us who have incredibly busy lifestyles, sacrifices are taken with shortcuts. Granted, we may not have the most incredible results, but we will accept "very good"!

We loved this recipe!!! To save some time, I simply mixed all of the ingredients together into the pot and brought them to a boil and then simmered them (no food processor) and it was delicious and much quicker!!!

Don sounds like a real food snob. Easy is a good thing, especially if it tastes good and everyone likes it

I made this last night and it was good. The cookies sort of melted away at the bottom, though. They became absorbed into the blackberry sauce. I used the Pepperidge Farm Chess cookies. Next time I may go with a sturdier shortbread. Or perhaps I crumbled too much? The topping was fantastic though! I used light ice cream to keep the fat and calories down a bit.

Don, Sometimes store bought is as good or better than homemade. If you feel you must make your own shortbread cookies to crumble.

Question... Could blueberries be used instead of blackberries with less cooking time?

I made this recipe for a dinner party dessert last week and it was wonderful. I served it it goblet glasses and it looked very impressive and was delicious. The store bought cookies made it really easy - no need to bake your own for it. I made two layers of the cookies, ice cream and topping in the goblet .

It was easy to make...we have wild fresh blackberries this time of year so it was fun to make something different than pie & jam. My company loved it

To Don: I haven't made this recipe, but I don't understand your objection to "store bought" anything, since it seems uncomplicated from start to finish (no one is requiring you to "make" ice-cream or carefully "fondle" the fruit). In fact, it's one of those recipes that seems to require little work - and it probably tastes good.

WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THE TIME FOR THIS WITH STORE COOKIES, WHATS THE POINT, PLEASE!!
