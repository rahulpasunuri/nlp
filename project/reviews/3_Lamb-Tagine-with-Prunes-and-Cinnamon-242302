Recipe was nice, honey made it a little sweeter than I wanted. Important note for in regards to saffron and turmeric...in general I would NEVER waste saffron if the recipe called for turmeric. And if a recipe called for saffron - then the other spices should be very mild and gentle (like this recipe) or else the turmeric will take over (color and taste) and you'll have wasted your saffron.

Lamb tagine with prunes is a great moroccan dish. Unfortunately, this recipe is anything but a tagine. What a disappointment and what a shame. The traditional moroccan recipe is so simple though, and so succulent that it doesn't need any update from "these days innovative cooks"!! The authentic moroccan tradition calls for marinating the lamb beforehand (in olive oil, safran, cuman, paprika, chopped parsley, and salt and peper), then searing it in some olive oil until brown. Remove the meat on the side, then cook onions in its fat until translucide, then garlic, then bring back the lamb, add spices (salt, peper, cuman, paprika). Bearly cover with water, bring to a boil, then let simmer until the lamb is very very tender. ON THE SIDE, put the prunes in a cup or so of the liquid the meat is cooking in (when it's almost done). Over medium heat, add honey and cinnamon and an optional drop or two of orange flower water, and cook until the prunes are tender (but not too much) and liquid has thickened. When it is done, remove the meat (only) from the heat, add the prunes and their sauce to the remaining liquid, let reduce, then adjust the seasoning by adding salt and peper if necessary, cinnamon, chopped parsley and almonds (blanched in boiling water for a few seconds, skin removed, then heated with a little bit of olive oil until golden brown and fragrant). Serve the lamb with the prunes sauce on top and then sprinkle with some sesame seeds if you wish. I'm no professional cook, I'm just a moroccan, and this is how I always cook my lamb tagine, and how I always saw my mother and other moroccan women do. No wine, no boiled meat, and no bland flavors.

And yes, sear the meat first!

Just made this recipe - to all those who thought this dish was too bland - it is if you only cook it for one and a half hours as discribed. Be sure to cook it till it gets nice and thick - better yet, serve it the day after. Just don't go and put hot stuff in it, that just over powers the exquisite flavours!

Yes, I agree with sixelagogo from NJ. You have to sear the meat and add everything separately into the enameled pot/cast iron bottom tagine. The braising liquid should be added right before the meat is returned to the cooking vessel. This helps to develop the complex flavors of the tagine.

It was hard to believe that all you had to do was toss the ingredients in the pot and let it cook. No browning, no searing. At first worried that it was just going to be a pot of boiled meat. But patience was rewarded after the prunes were added and simmered, the sauce thickened beautifully. Probably would skip frying the almonds and roast them instead next time. Served over couscous with cilantro. A HUGE HIT with my guests.

I agree with the last reviewer entirely. The flavor was entirely too subtle -- my partner called it bland. We added a hefty amount of cayenne which didn't alter the spice combo but did ramp of the flavor. We also added dried apricots as well as the prunes and skipped the honey entirely.

This was nice, but somewhat bland, despite the interesting combination of spices. I think the dish could use a bit of heat (red pepper flakes?) or a bit more punch - still, it's a supereasy, fast recipe that is worth keeping. The almonds and sesame seeds add a nice tasty crunch.

This was, by far, the worst recipe I have ever made from epicurious! I cook 6 nights a week and consider myself a very good cook. I spent $20 on my lamb, my husband and I ate a few pieces of meat and despised the taste of the sauce so the balance of the dish went into the garbage disposal. I wish I knew what all of the 3 fork reviews were tasting!

Very tasty, not a lot of trouble. I agree with the previous reviewer that I would try with less honey next time.

Couple of issues with the recipe, but overall, very tasty. Issue 1: be sure to print the recipe from this screen, not printer friendly, as the last 3 directives are missing. Some changes Change 1: I cut the honey down to 1 Tbs. and this was way sweet enough. I suggest you taste it as you add, lest you have a dessert. Change 2: I seared my spice laden meat instead of just covering it with water... That's the french in me. Issue/change 3: i used dried apricots and added chickpeas, both which worked very well Overall, very easy to prepare and flavors worked well.

This was simple to make, especially in the dutch oven. The lamb was so tender. I forgot to pick up the prunes despite it being on the shopping list, so substituted dried blueberries. I also could not find saffron (and frankly was fine as it is $$$). This dish turned out great, and my wife and 4 year old son liked it too.

This was a really easy recipe to make. My only negative was that by leaving the dish semi- covered during cooking, much of the sauce dried up - so I kept having to add water. Next time I make it, I'll cover completely during cooking and only take the lid off at the end to help the sauce to thicken. I also suggest adding a bit more ginger than suggested.
