I forgot to say, I used 1% milk instead of whole in the pudding. I doubt it made much difference, just fewer fat calories.

Excellent! I halved the recipe for just two of us. When it was almost done, I finally read the reviews, and noticed a lot of people said there wasn't enough custard. Agreed. So I made another half batch and poured it over the almost done pudding in the oven. It turned out perfect. The sauce is the best! I could hardly keep from eating it right out of the pan. After the pudding cooled, I spread the sauce over and refrigerated. I'm having leftovers for breakfast right now. YUM

I used black currant jam instead of raspberry, thinking it would give it more "zing". I also couldn't find brioche so I used torn-up croissants, and I didn't bother draining the syrup from the rhubarb - simply added it all into the mix. I also let the whole thing soak and set in the fridge for several hours before cooking. I thought the custard was superb, just the right amount and came out very light and luxurious. My only minor complaint is that the rhubarb itself was sort of superfluous; it added texture, but the flavor was overwhelmed by the jam, so maybe using black currant wasn't the best idea after all! Still, the dish overall was very, very good.

I made it with challah rather than brioche, and I agree with the cook who thought this needed more custard. The pudding was OK but nothing special on Day 1, but by Day 3 the leftovers had become what I expected in the first place -- nicely moist with tasty and interesting flavors. I'm not much of a bread pudding fan, but letting the pudding develop over a couple of days, as with good soups, could change that. I'll try it with brioche next time.

I made this exactly as the recipe said, except that I poured the fruit syrup over the top after it was done and set for 30 minutes. It was TREMENDOUSLY good and very different, kind of addictive actually...

Superb! And a year ago I didn't even like bread pudding. I think it's the name as the concept still kind of puts me off. Nonetheless, this is a great example of the dessert which I'm growing more fond of. I didn't have raspberry preserves (nor raspberries), so I boiled some strawberries with a little sugar and the water, then mashed them and carried on with the recipe. Strawberries are a natural pairing for rhubarb so this worked very well. I took a previous reviewer's idea and tore the brioche into pieces which worked well. As I like mine a bit crustier, I didn't bother with the water bath and the edges caramelised nicely. I neglected to strain the cooked fruit, so the syrup ended up baked in, which was no bad thing, but it would make for a more impressive presentation if it were drizzled over the individual servings. This is a keeper!

To me, this was good but not superb. Would give it two and a half forks. Thought it may need a bit more custard.

Outstanding recipe! Disagree with the review about not draining the rhubarb. I drained the rhubarb and cooked down the liquid as directed, and this makes a fabulous sauce to drizzle over the bread pudding.

This recipe is fantastic. A perfect blend of tart and sweet and great texture. I did the recipe exactly as it, except I saw no need to drain for 15 minutes as the mixture absorbed the moisture and was yum as is.

This was an easy, delicious bread pudding. I made it exactly to recipe, except that I used vanilla extract instead of the whole bean, and I tore the bread into pieces, which I think was much better than layering the slice halves. The sauce was a wonderful addition, but the pudding was great on its own. I was trying to figure out how to make this using some other fruit, but the rhubarb was a nice springtime treat.
