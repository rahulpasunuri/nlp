This is the best rice pudding of all time. I make it since the last two years and my family thrills over it. The flavor is unique, unusual and the texture is so much more interesting than the usual boring rice pudding... My husband says it's a sophisticated rice pudding !!! :-)

Though I use jasmine rice all the time with excellent results, I wasn't able to get it completely soft with this cooking method. I think next time I would steam the rice for about 5 minutes with water before adding the coconut broth and cooking till thick. Other than the odd texture that resulted, the flavor was quite good.

Very interesting flavors - incredibly aromatic. Don't underestimate the time it takes to make this dish. I prepared everything a few hours ahead of time - up until the step where you add the whipped cream. That may have caused it all to come out a bit heavier. If you're expecting the consistency of a traditional American rice pudding - don't. This is a more ricey, dense dessert...so a ramekin is the perfect serving size. Rather than fresh passion fruit, it was easier for me to find passion fruit sorbet. A small scoop on top was perfect.
