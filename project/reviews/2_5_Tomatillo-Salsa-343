I didn't want to use fresh basil so I used dried basil and a little fresh cilantro instead. There's plenty of room for playing around with the fresh herbs. Also, I'd suggest adding a small amount of lime juice and maybe a dash of coriander.

The shrimp tacos were great but I didn't feel as though this salsa added much to the dish. Easy to make and provided a freshness, but was a bit bland.

I was skeptical but this was a really great combination of flavors and very different from the usual accompaniments to tacos, seafood or otherwise. If anything, a little spicier shrimp probably would have made this salsa even better.

Nice combination of apples and tomatillas - it works.

I was very skeptical of this salsa until I finally tried it with the Cajun Shrimp Tacos it was developed to go with -- I doubt I'd use it anywhere else, but it really did complement the spiciness of the shrimp and chili sour cream in that recipe excellently.

The salsa was pretty flavorless and didn't add much to the recipe. Might have been better with some spice or cooked tomatillos...

I was stopped dead in my tracks by the ingredient "purchased" tacos shells. Yuk! The rest of it seems promising, but I think I'll just use tortillas and serve them as soft tacos (the chef's preference as to corn or flour would have been helpful too).

I would also like to respond to the negative review. I thought this salsa was lovely with the cajun shrimp tacos. The apples and mint complement the slightly tangy tomatillos. It's not a spicy salsa, it is a sweet one.

Just for the record, this is not the TOMATO SALSA that should be the link from "Grilled Chicken with Goat Cheese Stuffing and Two Salsas" also from the same issue.

I had to respond because the previous review was so negative. I made it to go with the shrimp tacos, and it was delightful, working well with the seafood, spice, avocado, sour cream, and the corn flavor of the fresh tacos. Context is everything.

This tomatillo salsa was horrible! Granny Smith apples? Basil? Mint? See the roasted tomatillo salsa on epicurious if you need a recipe. This one was TERRIBLE! First REALLY bad recipe i've found here!
