Very easy to make. Great when you want to make a quick, good dip for a party.

If you are making this because you love the full flavor of a good balsamic vinegar, you do not want to mute that flavor with lemon. I make it true to the recipe and was pleased. With the right vinegar it isn't bland.

Made the recipe as written, but found it to be too bland. Did end up adding 2 cloves of garlic, s/p, a squeeze of lemon, 2tsp sundried tomatoes and 2 tsp of balsamic vinegar as other suggested. Perfect with the modifications

As is, the recipe is just good. Add a couple of sun dried tomatoes, some of its oil, a tad more balsamic vinegar, a small clove of garlic, lots of s/p and the recipe becomes a three forks. Guests asked about the recipe.

This is a great alternative to Hummus. I added 1 clove of fresh garlic, tsp of fresh lemon juice, tbsp of water and 4 peices of sundried tomatoes. Skipped the extra oil. Was fast, easy and yummy!

Very bland. Not worth the effort.

Not worth the effort. Very bland.

Oh man this is so good! Not bland at all as some have suggested -- I think the secret is to use a really good aged balsamic. And don't underseason with the S & P. I could eat it by the spoonful!

In my humble opinion... this recipe is 4 forks for simplicity & amount of effort. I've done it simple using Lucini 10 yr balsamic and loved it. Awesome balsamic is the key to success. I played around with the recipe & ended up liking it less. So I am back to the KISS (keep it simple stupid), method & life is better. easier too

Like many others, I had to add a few more ingredients to make this more to my liking, but I think it's a good, basic recipe. I tripled the recipe for a larger group, and added two roasted peppers, one head of roasted garlic, and a half-cup of parmesan cheese. I've been asked to make this again, as it was a big hit!

This is okay but needs a lot of doctoring to maek it a repeat. Based on reviews I 'tweaked' it and that was still not enough to have guests go back for more.

As a chef I'll tell you every dish needs a balance of acid with salt & sometimes sweetness. I added roughly 2-3 T lemon juice, along with 2 fresh garlic cloves and 2 T sundried tomatoes. Yum!

i loved the sweetness of the vinegar with the beans. great and a nice hummus alternative.

Pretty bland as written. I added a few sundried tomatoes and freshly ground pepper, and will probably mix in more balsamic, too. Maybe would be good with those rosemary and garlic triscuits?

My husband and I both found this recipe very bland. If you need a good bean-based recipe for a spread, go find a good hummus recipe and don't waste your cannellini beans on this.

Quick, easy and healthy. Like one of the other reveiwers I misread and added a jarred roasted pepper (really misread). Added a nice taste. I plan try some other options soon.

I agree with other reviewers who thought this recipe was a bit bland. I would add a few sundried tomatoes or more balsamic vinegar. It was especially good spread on toasted pita bread slices. I rinsed the canned beans a couple of times and it was not too salty.

I notice that the recipe does not contain the information that the beans should be thoroughly rinse before being used. I find that this is totally necessary any time I used canned beans. I also see that several people found the beans too salty. When I make this on the weekend I will rinse the beans several times. This should allow me to better control the salt.

Very easy, quick and healthy. We enjoyed it and will make again!

Exceptionally easy to make. I was out of sun-dried tomatoes so I subbed in Tabasco and Chinese hot oil (wouldn't necessarily do that if preparing for kids). Pretty tasty.

I needed a pre dinner snack. This was good but I misread the recipe and thought the sun dried tomatoes went IN (not just the oil.) I added one T of sun dried tom. in oil and then only 1 T olive oil. It's easy and pretty healthy with a nice balsamic after bite but I can't imagine NOT adding the tomatoes (or something else in) for some more punch.

This was an easy, healthy and satisfying snack.

I had to add a lot more vinegar to make this dip work for me. It was pretty bland following it exactly. With the extra vinegar, it was very nice.

Nice a bit salty though. Recommend less salt

This is nice and light, very smooth and would spread easily. The canned cannelli beans have a fair bit of salt, and while I think it is the right amount, my wife is trying to avoid salt and would like less. Next time I'll try dried beans. I also omitted the oil from the sun dried tomatoes. The extra flavour would be nice but it works fine without.

I made this dip for dinner and my kids loved it.

I made this dip for the fresh veggies that I put in my husband's lunch and it is great. I added a little salt, two sun-dried tomatoes and some cayenne pepper to spice it up.
