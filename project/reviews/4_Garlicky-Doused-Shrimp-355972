Took this to a party and it was a big hit. Made a few changes. Did not make the yogurt dip (based on previous reviewers' recommendations). Just before serving I cut up an avocado and tossed it in. Did not garnish with the extra basil as the avocado added a nice green contrast. Enjoy!

Boringly bland. Based on 4 fork reviews, I doubled this recipe for a cocktail party expecting it to be the first dish empty. My guests left it after one taste. It sounds like it will be delicious, but it is flavorless. A waste of my money and time. I would have done better serving the shrimp plain with a cocktail sauce.

I made this recipe using five pounds of shrimp for my cooking club Halloween Party - the shrimp and dipping sauce were a huge hit. Easy to prepare & delicious! thanks!

Made this to take to a cocktail party.I will make this again and include some crusty bread for the beautiful marinade. Easy recipe and a crowd pleaser!Did not make the dip and didn't miss it. For the marinade, I didn't have shallots and it was fine. Did not add salt as I felt the shrimp had enough flavor BUT I added a teaspoon of hot pepper flakes. I used a 3 lb.bag of 21/25 pre-cooked, deveined shrimp. Let the shrimp thaw, peeled and put in a plastic bag with marinade. Put in refrigerator for about 2 hrs. Left shrimp in bag and brought a platter with lip, tooth picks and extra basil to party. Emptied the bag of shrimp onto the platter and embellished with the fresh basil leaves. Every shrimp was gone in no time! Will make again and again!

Very tasty shrimp, well received and very pretty presentation. I disagree with the too much garlic reviews - depends on your garlic I guess, but I could have added more as it did not seem like "garlic" shrimp, just nicely marinated. I served as others recommended with the marinade on the platter, draining off some of the liquid but the peppers/tomato/basil was pretty. No need for a side dish.

I doubled this recipe and used 21/30 count shrimp. This flew off the table at my NYE party. Very yummy. I'm not sure the dip is necessary, as the shrimp are so delish on their own!

Garlicky doused is an understatement. I love garlic but I think I'll cut back on the garlic next time I make this delicious dish. I, too, served with the marinade/salsa (added a red and yellow pepper), and it looked gorgeous on my New Year's buffet table. Skpped the sauce also.

made the marinade as described and let the shrimp marinate for about 4 hours. Didn't want to throw away the beautiful salsa-looking mixture so just served the shrimp with the mixture on a bed of fresh greens. I did this for an appetizer at our soup kitchen for a special Xmas meal and it was fantastic! So light and fresh... everyone wanted more. Didn't even bother with the dip.

this was an easy recipe for sure and quite rewarding. 2 things to note: 1) i love garlic and let me tell you to trust the recipe, you will not be disappointed by the garlic flavor you get from it. I put in 2-3x the prescribed garlic and it was potent. 2) I wouldn't even make the dip it did not compliment the shrimp very well. The shrimp had enough flavor that you won't need the dip. If you do make the dip you can 1/2 the amount since most people will probably not use it. I will definitely make this again with above thoughts. Plus the marinade/salsa would be great for other fish dishes and I bet if you put more lemon juice you could use it as a ceviche.

This was a HUGE hit! I used already cooked shimp and simply thawed them, threw them in a zip-loc bag with rest of ingredients and dumped all of it on a large serving plate. I also didn't have any yogurt on hand so used tzatziki sauce. Everyone loved it and not only ate the shrimp, but also picked up the 'bruschetta-like' pieces with slices of baguette as well. This is a keeper!
