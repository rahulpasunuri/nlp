Have made this recipe numerous times as written. It's been a hit with guests every time and is one of my husband's favourite dishes. Find the garlic flavour comes through very well with sliced garlic. Besides if the garlic is minced you run a real risk of burning it when you turn up the heat to cook the shrimp.

i live in wpg, mb canada and nener in my wildest dreams will be able to buy fresh shrimp, but frozen (uncooked is a must, the bigger the better)works great, just not to overcook, as soon as i see pink, i,m in heaven,love the minced garlic, maybe ginger as well, so easy to create with alittle olive oil and butter, fresh herbs and chardonnay ofcourse to degalce

Easy Peasy!! Added butter and reduced oil (1/2 & 1/2). Added Sriracha hot chili sauce, more pepper flakes, and white wine. Next time will pour over freash linguine.

This dish was fabulous! The key to making it spicy is to double the amount of red pepper flakes. It gives it a good kick! I also deglazed the pan with a little white wine and sprinkled the lemon juice on top of the shrimp while they were cooking instead of adding it at the end. The wine and lemon combination added a nice flavor to the dish. Bon appetite!!!

Easy, quick, and really yummy. Made these for Super Bowl and they were eaten in a millisecond.

Delicious and easy--I made these for a tapas party and they were well received. Then I heated the leftovers up and put them on pasta with broccoli..they were even good the second day!

I made this as an appetizer for a Valentines dinner party last night and it was definitely a hit. To get some more kick, I added extra red pepper and cayenne pepper. I agree that minced garlic would be an easier and more effective component to this dish than sliced garlic.

I made this appetizer last night for a dinner party and received rave reviews. I did mince the garlic and I doubled the red pepper flakes (I like spicy!). I sprinkled fresh parsley over the top for eye appeal.

BORING! A waste of shrimp!

i was not impressed with this dish at all. i didn't find it terribly spicy, or even garlicky (although i did cut the recipe down to half for serving only a few people). i felt the instructions for slicing the garlic were all wrong--you need it minced or crushed to really get the flavor, and don't let it brown! all in all, just so-so. i did add white wine, which was nice.

This was an excellent 1st start. I wish I had 3 lbs of shrimp!

Good, though I added some Louisiana Hot Sauce to give it a better kick. I also added white wine and topped with fresh chopped cilantro. I will be making this at my restaurant, to do that, I will make the sauce ahead of time and hold. Then just heat sauce and cook shrimp in sauce and add lemon juice at that time.

This dish is absolutely fabulous!! Very fast and easy to make, and the flavours really permeate the shrimp. I added some white wine and served the shrimp over angel hair pasta, which we tossed in sesame oil and minced coriander, as suggested previously. The dish is also just as good the next day as leftovers!

This recipe is definitely a keeper. So simple in preperation and flavor. (In my mind, simple is not always a bad thing in flavor.) I added a couple splashes of white wine that really added to the yumminess.

I love this recipe. I also added butter in with the olive oil (I know it's not good for you, but it tastes even better). Easy and quick, I would serve this with no qualms at the most elegant dinner party or as a quick after work meal. Serve over pasta, rice, or with some decent bread as an appetizer. MMMMM, MMMM

Simply superb! Quick, easy and delicious way to prepare shrimp. Made again last night with scallops instead of shrimp and omitted the lemon juice. Served over curly egg noodles tossed with a little sesame oil and minced cilatro. What a treat! Be sure to serve some crusty bread to sop up the yummy pan juices. Cheers!

My husband loved this one. A very easy way to make a quick meal.

Very good - also added scallops after the shrimp had cooked for a bit. Next time will add more hot pepper flakes to make it extra spicy.

This is a wonderful addition to my shrimp repertoire--different from my other favorites and we all loved it. I served with some hot french bread to soak up the great pan juices. I may try deglazing with some white wine next time to increase the pan juices without increasing fat content.

I jhave been making shrimp this way for years. I sometimes also use lime instead of the lemon and deglaze the pan with tequila. I then add 1 T of butter and sprinkle with cilantro.

I have been making shrimp this way for years. I also have used lime in place of the lemon and finished it off deglazing with tequila and adding butter to smooth it out followed with a healthy sprinkle of cilantro.

Very easy & tasty dish. I am always looking for quick meals to cook for my husband and I. We both work and don't have time for big fancy meals. You can make this dish w/rice and a veggie in less than twenty minutes (after shrimp is peeled & de-vained).I used fresh shrimp and the prep time was a little long. Next time I will try frozen peeled shrimp.

Wow!! Made this with frozen shrimp (correctly thawed, and not overcooked), and my family devoured it! We will definitely make this one again!!

Yum, very tasty and very easy. Markds is right about fresh vs. frozen shrimp.

Marvelous, simple dish. One additional note about fresh vs. frozen shrimp--frozen PREcooked shrimp can indeed be bad. However, according to a seafood specialty store I really trust here in town, sometimes frozen UNcooked shrimp is actually better-tasting than fresh never-frozen shrimp. The reason is that frozen shrimp are flash-frozen on the dock or boat before they have a chance to begin deteriorating. Never-frozen shrimp, especially in the hot months or if they come from warmer areas (such as the Gulf), can start to lose their freshness well before they get to market. My fishmonger said that he personally buys WHOLE shrimp that is STILL frozen (not thawed for display in the case) because it stays fresher that way. He puts it in the freezer and thaws it when he is ready to cook with it. Since he told me this, I've been doing it too, and haven't regretted it yet.

I don't mean to burst anyone's bubble, but once again, just because the shrimp are thawed in the case does not mean they are fresh! These were previously frozen shrimp. (If anyone is referring to frozen, precooked shrimp, indeed, they are terrible.) Ask your fishmonger about this if you are unsure. They occasionally lie, though. I visited a seafood market in Baltimore last year and the clerk insisted that the shrimp had never been frozen. I knew better because that market used the same purveyor as my business, and I personally know the salesman! I still prefer to buy the shrimp frozen and handle them myself for health reasons.

It was so easy and very tasty! I put the shrimp (I used frozen and it was delicious)on angle hair and my family loved it! I will make this over and over again!

I was in a hurry today and just didn't have time to go to the fish market, so...I used frozen as I often do and sure enough if was just as delicious as it would have been if I had to make it for my boss. I might even try it on him using the frozen next time we have them over so that I can tell rather there is truely a difference of not.

Great recipe. Very easy and simple. Have to agree with markds, though. I use the frozen shrimp quite often with lots of different recipes and they have always turned out beautifully! I have, however, bought shrimp at the fish market, and the shrimp are fresh, not previously frozen, nor do they have the heads still on. I don't think I could tell the difference between the fresh and the frozen that I use. Obviously, there are some bad frozen ones out there I'm sure, but I've never had any that taste like cardbowrd! Unless of course, they're overcooked!

I'm with you Virginia, fresh shrimp is the ONLY way to go. putting frozen shrimp in this recipe, well you might as well serve cardboard, DUH! Great flavor and very easy. Definitely a keeper!

A note to the reviewer suggesting using fresh shrimp- if you purchased the shrimp from a market or store and the heads were removed, the shrimp were previously frozen. This is almost always the case. Shrimp with the head attached are generally the only fresh shrimp available. There is nothing wrong with using frozen shrimp, there are many excellent brands out there, particularly Compass brand and a few other brands from Ocean Garden Products, an excellent Mexican company. I have found that the Mexican brown gulf shrimp superior to others, escpeciallt Compass brand- thay are hand packed and uniform in size. It's actually a better idea to buy shrimp frozen anyway, you generally don't know how long the 'fresh' shrimp have been sitting in the fishmonger's seafood case. Simply thaw the shrimp under cold running water in a colander. It only takes about 30 minutes and you have controlled the handling of the product, much safer in my opinion.

I give this dish a 4 fork because it was so easy to make (15min. max. if u buy peeled shrimps) and yet the result was sooo good. The key is to let the garlic and pepper flakes simmer in low temp. to get all the aroma into the oil. Also, I used dried garlic slices to save time but the dish still captured beautiful garlic aroma.

This recipe is great - simple and truly delicious. I used very fresh, never frozen, shrimp which definitely added to the tasty results. The quality and freshness of the shrimp will either make or break this recipe.
