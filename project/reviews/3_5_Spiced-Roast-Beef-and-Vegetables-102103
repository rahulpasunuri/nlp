125 is not medium rare. I took my roast out at 130 and was afraid it was going to be over done. I let it sit for 15 minutes and then started carving. It was still very rare! After doing more research I've found that 140 is medium rare. Luckily I had people sitting at the table who liked very rare meat!

This recipe was perfect with our 2.5 lb elk round roast. The spice rub was delicious and we added bacon since elk meat is short on fat. We used a thermometer to test the temp. and at 125 the meat was pink and tender. As other reviewers stated, the vegetables were done with the meat and didn't need the extra 10 minutes.

I liked this very much and as another viewer said, it made an excellent Sunday dinner. After braising, I bruched the roast with oil and rubbed the spice mixture over the roast. However, then I put pieces of bacon along the grain of the roast all around it to keep it very moist. I served with a mustard caper sauce I have from another recipe and it was really a hit.

Made this pretty much according to recipe except I didn't have any cilantro, so I added some fresh thyme to the veggies in the last 10 min. We used a 2 1/5 lb top sirloin roast. Yummy and would make great leftovers for sandwiches. I'd add pearl onions and horseradish for the meat next time.

Made this tonight using a 4-pound cross rib roast. The extra weight and thickness meant a longer cook time of about 1:35 to reach 125 degrees, which made for a perfect medium rare. I added garlic powder, chili powder & paprika for more smokiness. I also took Houston's tip of searing before roasting, which I'm sure was worth the effort. I added quartered onions and chunked celery to the veggies for more variety. I also made a simple horseradish sauce of 2 parts horseradish to 1 part mayo with a few shakes of Worcestershire & some cayenne pepper for extra zing. All in all a very good Sunday dinner. I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow & some great sandwiches this week. I will make this again in some form or other. Next time I will apply the rub the night before cooking and I will start a little earlier in the afternoon.

We used fresh ginger and garlic in the rub and didn't cut the slits into the meat, which can sometimes dry it out. We rubbed the roast all over and then covered with masala wine and let marinate for 6+ hours, then seared the meat before roasting. Was a huge hit and very delicious.

These instructions left me with a tough piece of meat. There should have been liquid in the pan, a cover and longer cooking time. A disappointment.

I made this and, even after reading comments, decided to just follow the recipe and just extended the meat cooking time a bit (10 more minutes) and took everything out of the oven at that time. Glad I did because the way the vegetables roasted and caramelized made this the best roast dish I've ever made. It would not have been worth the extra mess to brown it on the stove since you coat it with olive oil & herbs anyway. Will add some parsnips next time.

I used an eye round roast, about 2.5 lbs. I took the approach the Houston cook suggested and turned it around somewhat based on some reading I had done about tenderloin roasts: 1. Added salt to the spice rub 2. Applied the garlic and the spice rub 24 hours in advance, and refrigerated wrapped in plastic. 3. Cooked the roast at 300 degrees until internal temp was 120. 4. Browned in olive & canola oil, and rested for 15 mins. I don't have a lot of beef roast experience to compare this too. But the reaction it got at the table was very positive. A couple people went back for thirds. I myself thought it was very good. I didn't try the roast vegetables as written. Based on my experience roasting vegetables I do not believe the method described is worthwhile.

We did not love this recipe. It was under-whelming to say the least. HOWEVER, I am a BIG FAN of EPICURIOUS.COM, but this recipe was one of the very few highly-touted meals that we found to be so very ordinary. Upward and onward!

I made this last night and seared all the sides and ends after applying the spice rub and garlic before putting it in the oven. I think that it really sealed in a lot of the juices, and turned out pretty good.

Houston's advice should be posted as a separate recipe because while dead on, it has nothing to do with THIS less than perfect recipe. Prepared as printed, the cumin is overwhelming, the meat is tough (even with an expensive cut) and the flavors just don't ever fully develop. Okay for the newly-wed non-cook, but certainly no "epicurian" delight.

I have made this twice and both times it turned out really well. Yesterday I made it for a Superbowl supper and cooked the meat in advance to be served cold, and had horseradish cream with it. Very yummy! and there were no leftovers.

I too followed Houstons cooking method. My question is... when they say turn the oven up from 275 to 500 do they mean to take the food out till the oven reaches that temp and then continue? or leave it in? I left mine in and the oven took a long time to get to 500.

Rating: 3
This was easy to make and delightful to eat! I cooked it a little longer as we like beef more medium than rare. I also used several slivered garlic cloves and pushed them vertically into the roast every 1 to 1 1/2 inches over the top surface of the roast.

Rating: 3
This turned out great! Made it for an office party and ended up with three slices left. I followed Houston's directions, sorta basically, but may have had a thicker cut of meat so it took double time to get up to temp. Threw the vegis in after about an hour and a half and they were fantastic.

This was my first time making a roast and it fared well in the oven although I'd cook it only for about 30 - 40 minutes in the first interval. I cooked mine for an hour, and my roast was a tad larger than what is in the recipe, and it ended up a lot tougher than it looks in the photo! Anyways, it made great sandwiches later and my fiance gobbled it up :D

I thought this recipe was very good as did my family and guests. I followed the Houston method, but cooked the meat to a little under 145 degrees to get it somewhere between medium-rare and medium. I made two 2.5 lb. roasts at the same time, but only browned one of them. In my opinion the browned roast was slightly better, but none of the other people who ate it noticed the difference. The vegetables also turned out great using Houston's instructions. This was the first time I prepared this recipe, so I cannot compare Houston's method to the one stated in the recipe, but it seemed to make alot more sense. Most of the recipes that I found before I decided on this one called for roasting eye of round at about 300-350 deg. for about an hour (depending on weight and desired doneness) and roasting potatoes anywhere from 425-500 deg. for about 1/2 hour. There really seems to be no need to roast the vegetables at a low temperature for such a long time. I will definetly make this recipe again and recommend making a little extra as the leftovers make great roast beef sandwiches.

I followed Houston's directions and the roast was done to perfection. I have a tastier recipe for roast vegetables, so I probably will not make this again.

This was fine, not great, but fine. The cumin overwhelms the whole experience. Following the Houston technique gives nicely cooked veggies that are still crisp. I'll go back to a simpler salt & pepper roast next time.

I followed the Houston cook also and was amazed how it turned out exactly as stated! The meat was perfect and everything was finished at the same time in about 1 hour! Definitely won't follow the recipe cooking instructions. Now I know why it pays to read the reviews! A BIG HIT!

I followed the recipe precisely, but after an hour, the veggies were done and the meat was still breathing. I used a beef tip roast and after removing the veggies and continuing to cook (for another hour), the roast was great. Maybe the cook from Houston has it right...

Was looking for a recipe for a not so tender buffalo eye-of-round roast and decided to use this recipe. Cooked roast and vegetables without potatoes in a 275 degree oven until the thickest part of the roast reached 115 degrees (about 45 mins). Turned oven temp up to 500 and added thin sliced, thyme-coated potatoes on baking sheet. Cook roast until internal temp reaches 130 for about 15 mins. Remove roast from oven to sit for 15 minutes but keep potatoes cooking. Roast was brown, potatoes were great,

Excellent. The whole cumin really sets this off, differentiating it from and ordinary roast beef.

This dish was extremely disappointing. Roasting vegetables is generally done at a higher temperature. These vegetables were overcooked and extremely bland. The roast was boring and lacked in presentation because of poor color. Per the instructions, this dish does not work.

After experimenting with this recipe, and reading some of my more "scientific" cookbooks, this process was the best. Brown the seasoned roast on all sides in a little olive oil, then cook in 275 oven until the thickest part of the roast reaches 115 degrees (about 45-55 mins). Turn oven temp up to 500, and add veggies. Cook roast until internal temp reaches 130 (about 15 mins), and veggies until they are nicely browned. You'll have a perfect med. rare. roast and delicious veggies.

I'm being kind of wishy-washy on this one!while it tasted alright , the appearance is pallid. There is no way the veg could take that long to finish! I did add quartered onions, put them in at 350 while rubbing the roast, mine was smaller and was done in 40 minutes, tossed them in another pan, added red wine and beef broth to roasting pan and reduced. I do like some sauce. the vegs were really done but I gave them 5 minutes at 450 anyway. Next time I wouldn't bother with grinding spice and would just use Garam masala..almost the same ingredients and spicer.

I wasn't able to find the eye of round roast and ended up using an outside round beef roast. It's not a good enough cut of meat though the roasting time was just about right - with the meat rare in the middle. Even with the meat being too tough, one could tell it's a good tasting recipe and the roasted vegies were a big hit. I served it with horseradish and would use a better cut of meat next time.

I followed the recipe exactly, and checked the beef about 55 minutes of roasting. It was overcooked- it was medium well. Plus, the vegetables were cooked by then, too... roasting the veggies at a higher temp any longer would have burned them. The flavor of the roast was okay... it would have been better if the meat were more rare, though. I don't think I will make this again.

My husband loves eye of round. It was never one of my favorite cuts of beef. I tried this last night and now we both love it! The spices really add something special to an otherwise mediocre piece of meat. I always did the garlic but I think rubbing it with oil also helped to keep it moist & tender. The veggies were flavored nicely . Excellent & easy!!

Before making this dish, we read the earlier reviews. We also substituted red pepper flakes for cayanne pepper. We also added the 1/2 cup of liquid in the meat cooking process but we used beef broth. Great dish, highly recommend.

This was quite good, although the cumin flavor dominates. I think an even better cut of beef would further improve the recipe, and next time I will chop the carrots slightly smaller. The roast potatoes and carrots picked up the spices nicely and were very good.

This is a simple yet delicious recipe. I have made and served it for various occasions (from family dinners to dinner parties) at least 10 times. I often choose it for those events where I am pressed for time but want to impress my guests. I do the spice rub the night before and then bring to room temp. and pop it in the oven. The spice combination is delicious and the beef is tender and juicy.

I'm a novice cook, and this dish was simple and satisfying. Great for a chilly winter evening. I don't think you can add too much garlic. even after an hour roasting, the meat was infused with flavor. About halfway through roasting, I poured about 1/4 cup water over the roast because it looked dry, and it ended up yummy and juicy! I even made this dish in one of those cheap, throw away aluminum pans, and it did just fine.

I didn't think the results were great, and that's because this dish is not nearly as simple as written. The vegetables must be cut reasonably large, with at least two flat sides. I added some rosemary. Cook them on the lowest possible oven rack, in a good quality metal roasting pan. After the first 30 minutes, carefully flip them all with a spatula. They should be brown on the bottom. Add the meat (but you should really brown it first), pushing vegetables aside, and cook at 375 until meat reaches 125, (less than an hour if browned), not a minute longer. When vegetables are done, remove them and keep warm, as you are going to have to make a gravy. And slice meat very thin, as eye of round is not a very tender cut. The spices and garlic stay awfully strong, as the meat hasn't cooked long enough to mellow them. Now that I think about it, it's faster than a pot roast, but more labor intensive and not nearly as satisfying.
