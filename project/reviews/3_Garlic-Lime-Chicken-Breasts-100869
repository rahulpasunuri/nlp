Made this tonight and it was fine. I used a whole cut up chicken because I wanted leftovers. It was nice and moist, with a little lime kick. I dumped the marinade into the dish when I put it into the oven. Some of the garlic burned but it was yummy nevertheless!

OK, if you use boneless, skinless breasts, it's going to be bland. That's why the recipe indicates skin and bone-in. Refrain from a negative review if you have not followed the recipe.

Made this with boneless, skinless chix breast and added minced challots as well. Covered with tin foil in baking pan and left a little bit of marinade in pan to keep chix from drying out - was pretty good. Not over powering at all!

I used 4 large cloves of minced garlic and added about a tablespoon of sugar, a little ginger, and some salt and freshly ground pepper in the marinade. Instead of breasts, I injected the marinade into a whole chicken and baked it in a hot oven to caramelize the sauce. Both my husband and son made it a point to say it was great and asked me to make it again..

This chicken compliments the menu paired Quinoa, but does not necessarily stand out on it's own.

This recipe is ok,not fantastic. A lot of salt needs to be added to bring out the flavor of the lime in the chicken. I added cilantro and used limes along with the lime juice, garlic and olive oil. I served this with fresh corn and garlic and chive mashed potatoes. My husband liked it.

We thought this was very tasty for a week-night meal. For most flavor, I do think it is important to use the bone and skin-on breasts. The chicken was very moist and had a nice crispy skin. I did take another reviewer's advice and boiled the remaining marinade and spooned a small amount over the chicken. That probably helped with the flavor. Served with roasted cherry tomatoes and black beans tossed with salt, cumin, and lime.

Great recipe. Took other comments from reviewers about blandness, and added about 1/2 T. Key lime seasoning and about 1 T. Italian seasoning. I used skinless boneless chicken breasts, pierced the breasts all over with a fork, and marinated 6-8 hours. Delicious! Used leftover chicken with stir fried vegetables the next day sprinkled with a little lime juice.

This was one of the easiest recipes by far! I did add one minor thing to the marinade though. I was concerned that I didn't have enough lime juice squeezed so I added a couple shots of Schmirnoff Lime Vodka. It was fabulous!

My husband loves this dish...but with the following variation: in the olive oil (before you add the chicken), saute 4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced and 2-4 birds' eye chilis, also thinly sliced. When the garlic has browned a little and turned crispy, remove it and add the chicken. Cook chicken until done, and at the last minute add back the garlic. The dish is hot and spicy, but boy is it good! I usually make a sauce to accompany it out of plain yogurt pureed with watercress, a little lemon juice, and salt.

The chicken was nice and juicy, but it was bitter. Maybe I just didn't get a good lime, but the chicken tasted like I was eating lime pith. Maybe using key lime juice instead would cut some of the bitterness? I won't be making this recipe again.

We thought it was very good. I think the trick is to let it marinate for at least 6 to 8 hours. We grilled it served it with asparagus and wild rice.

The BLANDest chicken ever. Luckily it was served with Papaya/Red Onion Salsa (recipe to be found on this site) as the salsa is unbelievable and saved the meal. Skip this chicken, but check out the salsa.

Cheap, tasty, and simple. I never marinate, I just squeeze tons of lime on one side then douse the other side when I flip during baking. I always add oregano which keeps it from being bland.

It was easy to make and marinate, then cook later. Allows for easy casual entertaining, because it's already cooking while you make the other dishes.

Simple as can be, with few ingredients, but full of flavor. I added the grated lime zest and some dried herbs to the marinade the second time I made this. We were all surprised at how moist it came. A keeper.

I read some of the reviews of this recipe and decided to make some additions to the marinade, to give the chicken some extra flavor. I added another tablespoon of garlic, about a teaspoon of soy sauce, a little chicken broth and white wine, and probably a teaspoon (I hate exact measurements - I'd rather just approximate and give it what I think it needs) of crushed red pepper, and it turned out really well. It was flavorful, moist.... oh, I also used boneless/skinless breasts, and grilled them. I'd definitely make this again, but I'm pretty sure if I would have followed the recipe exactly it would have turned out bland. The recipe seems more like a guideline than anything - it was a nice opportunity to experiment a little, and not risk destroying the balance of the recipe.

This dish didn't have as strong a garlic flavor as I'd expected, but it was SO easy to make. I prepared it the night before, marinated for a day, and then cooked it straight out of the refrigerator. Warnings about the lime juice 'cooking' the chicken notwithstanding, the chicken was very tender, and not at all dry. I'd definitely make this again - maybe not for company, but definitely as an easy dish to eat at home.

We used skinless chicken breasts and grilled them. We reduced the marinade in a sauce pan and used it as a sauce to cover the breasts after grilling. Great comments from our guests.

This is a nice recipe, but nothing special. This is not a recipe that I would serve company....there are others that I would serve before this one. Great for the family and fussy teenagers!!!! Point of intrest: Lime and lemon juice will "cook" your chicken, so watch your marinating time

Rating: 3
Mmmm! Simple and subtle flavours (add more garlic and lime) but delicious. Use chicken breasts with the skin and bones, it makes a big difference. Must be marinated at least overnight to get the full effect. I've made this numerous times and always end up with the moisted, juciest chicken. Definitely a keeper.

It was great! I used boneless, skinless breasts, and baked the chicken covered to keep it moist, then poured off most of the juices before broiling. I had to broil it a little longer to get it brown though.

The chicken was tasty and very easy to prepare. I used skinless chicken breasts to cut down on the fat. However, my family found the chicken to be rather dry as they like their food with a lot of sauce.

I used boneless, skinless breasts and marinated this for 7 hours and just grilled the chicken. It tasted like basic grilled chicken with a little lime. It was juicy but nothing special.

OK, I"ve tried this twice, marination the chicken over night and it just tasted like plain broiled chicken. I will not be making this again.

Needs to be marinated more than a couple hours. I will try this again but will NOT use skinless breasts this time. Good garlic flavor.

Wonderfully moist. Marinaded all day, added a light sprinkling of lemon pepper before cooking. Will make again and again. Good company receipe too.

I made this dish for my cooking club. It was really easy and had a great flavor. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, and they worked just fine. I put the chicken in the marinade the night before, so that all I had to do was pop it in the oven when I got home from work. Everyone loved it! I'm going to use this recipe next for an entree salad . . .cook the chicken, cut it into bite-size pieces, and serve it over fresh greens.

3 hours' marination gave only a little flavor. Next time I'll marinate longer.

Yummy flavors!! The lime and salt really tenderize the chicken. I used boneless/skinless chicken breasts and we grilled them. We'll try the marinade with bone/skin-on chicken breasts next time.

Very quick simple and tasty. Our 10 year-old daughter loved it. I bagged it over night and put it in the convection oven next to a tray of sliced red potatoes coated with balsamic vinegar, herbs and oil for 25 min @ 400. Perfect for all! Green salad and a nice merlot....Good work night dinner.

A very simple dish to make, but it has a nice tangy flavor, not at all heavy. My husband and I will definitely make this again!

Very quick & easy. Marinating overnight really intensifies the tangy flavors. Chicken stayed moist & juicy...was definitely a hit!

Yum! I only did 2 chicken breasts for myself and my husband but kept the same amount of marinade. Added extra garlic too....they were so moist! You could really taste the lime flavor! I marinated them in a bag over night.

I followed another reviewer's advice and marinated for the full day, with excellent results. I turned the chicken once during broiling so that it got crispy all over, and added a sprinkling of garlic salt just before serving. Wonderful!

very good. Loved the fresh taste of lime. marinated about three hours.Eleanor

Broiling the skin produces a crispy outside yet retains a juicy and tender breast, no overcooking. Recommend marinating more that two hours if you like more than a subtle hint of marinade
