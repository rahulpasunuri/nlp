This salad is really delicious. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the dressing it actually is really tasty and I think that it would also make a really good marinade. I used assorted color cherry tomatoes that are at the peak of the season which made the salad even better. This will become a summer favorite.

This is really just OK. I did add ginger as many suggested. Needed it for sure, but the result was still pretty limp tasting. I will go back to an old NY Times recipe...Steak Salad Oriental..some of you may also have this in your antique files. Good Try Murphy but not will not make again

Great dressing!! I had a leftover flank steak and was looking for something to do with it. I used some local early greens, local green peas, raw ( we have had a very wet spring so no snow peas, or sugar snap peas). I added some canned mandarin oranges, scallions and the thinly sliced flank steak. Wow!! But it was the dressing that made it. (I added some grated fresh ginger, and cut down on the honey). But the dressing made it. will use it again and again.

I'll definitely make this again. I took the suggestions of some of the other reviewers and added avocado slices and mandarin orange sections to the salad, and a little grated ginger to the dressing, but otherwise followed the recipe as written. It was excellent.

I made the dressing as written, I substituted mixed salad greens for the watercress, and used carrots and cucumber instead of the tomatoes. My husband, 5 year old daughter, and I thought it was delicious. We will make this again!

Delicious, though I think next time I'd use less honey - the dressing came out quite sweet, and I had to doctor it with more vinegar and soy sauce. Made with stir-fried steak and mesclun salad, and later in the week polished off the dressing in a tomato and cucumber salad. Really fresh and tasty.

This is just as wonderful as everyone says it is. I don't often like the taste of strong, raw red onions, so I sauteed these in a bit of olive oil and then sweated them on a low heat. I used a mix of baby greens and arugula instead of the watercress. The dressing is wonderful and it doesn't take much for a great deal of flavor. I also added a sliced hard-boiled egg per serving, and next time I will also add an avocado. I also did not make the garlic paste. I just minced it as fine as I could with a knife. Perfectly wonderful.

This is a great dish for using up leftover flank steak. Highly recommend you make extra dressing for other salads. Fresh, original and a standby.

Excellent! Did as others mentioned and added fresh minced ginger. 1 tsp. I doubled the garlic. Added roasted veg. Will make again for sure!

This was a very nice salad. I served it on a hot summer night, and it was a refreshing dinner for my family. I did follow some of the earlier suggestions made. I added manderin oranges and avocado, both which were lovely addition to the salad both in taste and presentation. I also added a bit of ginger to the dressing. I highly recommend this recipe to all. As this is definitely a keeper.

Dressing does need ginger, I agree. Served it over a steak, romaine, cabbage and black plum salad - yummy mid-week dinner.

Absolutely delicious!

Avocado is a good suggestion. Dressing pleads for ginger. I like fresh heirloom tomatoes and snowpeas from the garden. Too critical only since the salad name is my last name.

Great dressing. Needed a salad recipe for leftover steak and this was a real winner. Added cilantro and mint, along with an avocado and canned mandarin oranges. You pretty much can't go wrong with this dressing. Couple of days later made salad again w/out steak and it was just fine!

We've made this recipe twice and really like it. The first time, the onions overpowered the salad, so the next time we made it, we blanched the onions with the peas to make the onions a little sweeter. The onions wilted a little, but they were much more mild. My wife also cut back a little on the garlic in the dressing and it still tasted fine with less fear of "garlic breath" the next day.

I've always wanted a recipe that used leftover steak. This one has it all! We used green beans, sliced carrots and celery and ready-made salad greens. Dinner was ready in less than 15 minutes. Some fresh sliced fruit and a glass of merlot, and we were set for the evening.

Just curious. Why would some one rate a recipe they obviously haven't tried? ARROGANCE!

My husband and I loved it, he even said that it should go on the regular recipes list. I have to admit that I deviated just a bit. I marinated the flank steak overnight (with vinegar, honey and soy sauce). Then to the salad I added cooked rice noodles, a 1/2 chopped fresh jalapeno pepper (could have added more), and sliced seeded cucumber. It was a great dinner!

Delicious. I substituted Romaine lettuce. I used leftover flank steak, which really soaked up the dressing, and wasn't a bit dry. Wonderful.
