Easy and delicious. A great option for a brain-dead day.

A great staple - I occasionally throw in mushrooms, zucchini. Sometimes I add chipotle chiles in adobe sauce for extra heat. I've also added grilled tuna and it came together quite nicely (and quickly).

This is a great quick week night dinner. I substituted corn for hominy and sherry for the port, because that's all I had on hand. Next time I will use port, but it was still worth a repeat even with the sherry.

I don't know what hominy is, but after serving this dish, I can conclude that it's gross.

This was really terrific and presented very well. I also used a good tequila, added lime, and substituted arugula for the spinach. I needed to add more tequila as I found it a tad dry. I accompanied the tacos with the chili-cinnamon sweet potatoes and mmmmmm....great combo.

I've made these twice now, with great results both times. The first time, I followed the recipe except added tequila as I had no port on hand. The tacos were fabulous with a squirt of lime squeezed on at the table. I made them just last Saturday for a party. To spice the mix up, I added a 1/4 teaspoon of dried ground chipotle chile, substituted frozen sweet corn for hominy, added about a cup of leftover black bean/chicken enchilada filling and again substituted tequila for port. Served again with lime wedges on the side, a must I feel. Guests raved, husband raved, kid inhaled and ate the leftovers for lunch the next day with gusto. This will become a staple in my house.

I made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I couldn't get hominy in time for the dinner so I just used frozen whole-kernel corn and that was great. I also added pineapple salsa to the mixture for some sweetness to balance the spice. Excellent.

These "tacos" were great! I didn't have port so I threw in some Marsala. For a delicious twist, stuff large spinach or sundried tomato tortillas with the filling, top with spinach queso (velveeta, rotel,& sauteed spinach) and serve with homemade guacamole salad!

This is a very tasty dish. It's also low-fat and high-fiber, yet my husband (who normally only likes fat-filled concoctions) gives it three forks as well. And the coup de grace is it's easy to make. I've also used it for casual dinner parties, I just make rice and a salad and the guests assemble their own tacos, so the work on the hostess is minimal.

I was all set to write a review claiming what a waste of good port, but I can't. This actually turned out to be quite tasty and a little sweet. Can't say I'll make it every week, but I'll make it again.
