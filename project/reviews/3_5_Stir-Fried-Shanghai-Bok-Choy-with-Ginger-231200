This is an excellent lowfat stirfry. Very little oil needed in cooking. And the flavors are perfectly balanced. I substituted chopped cabbage for 1/2 of the Bok Choy and really enjoyed the extra crunch.

Good, nice and light. I threw in some shiitake and julienned carrots too.

Interesting idea to "juice" the ginger. Very often with this kind of recipe there are tough pieces of ginger, but not with this. The matchsticks were fine enough not to notice anything tough or too gingery. I used a head of regular (large) bok choy and sliced it in about 1-inch pieces, and substituted beef broth for the chicken broth. I felt that the sauce was a tad too salty (I would perhaps halve the amount of salt, as there is soy sauce as well), but it's fine over plain rice.

This is really delicious and both quick and easy. Moreover, my 3 year old loved it, and was asking for bok choy again the next day. My only caution - I myself like bok choy a little more cooked than this recipe suggests, however if they cook more they start to release liquid which dilutes the sauce.

Easy and good.

Delicious, easy, and fast - exactly what you need if you have to prepare something at the last minute when the guests are already there. As always with bok choy, watch it carefully - add the broth mixture as soon as it starts to wilt, since you have to cook it for another minute after that.

I was very surprised at how tasty this was considering how simple it is. Really, really flavorful! I added chicken and orange pepper slices to the bok choy and served it over soba noodles. I also substituted fresh ginger with a tube of minced ginger that i have in the fridge.

This turned out great. Very subtle flavor and everyone loved it. I paired the bok choy with sake halibut in parchment (recipe from this site) and it was a huge hit!

Followed the directions, except used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil and added chicken, it was delicious. Will definitely make it again.

Delicious, fresh, and so simple!

Delicious, simple and easy! There is another one on Epicurious which uses butter - not it. This was just what I was looking for - a Chinese version - for Chinese husband.

I've made this twice now and each time it was successful. The first time, I used beef stock instead of chicken stock (it's all I had in the house) and I think it turned out better. I also added a bit more corn starch for a thicker sauce, but other than that, this is a really tasty and quick recipe.

I made this for company last weekend and it was a nice, fresh tasting dish. Although I used regular bok choy instead of the baby variety, it was still very good. We liked the crunchiness and the flavor didn't overpower the other dishes it was served with. For extra color, I added shredded carrot just before the bok choy was finished cooking. I think carrots and ginger go well together. This dish was quick and easy and I would most likely make it again.

Super easy to make and the ginger flavor really enhanced the bok choy! The hubby loved it too!

This was an easy and very good side dish for my asian theme dinner. Though it was super easy to extract the liquid from the ginger root, I'm wondering if it really made much difference if I hadn't done that (and just add finely zests of ginger??). Anyway, went well with the honey-soy glazed salmon and rice. Will definitely make again...and hopefully the hubby will like it, since he's not a big fan of bok choy!

I followed this recipe exactly except for the low-sodium chicken broth, which I did not have so I used regular. I think low-sodium is important as this was tasty but WAY too salty. I also added sliced shitake mushrooms, which was tasty.

Quick and easy; Great base sauce for stir fry. Will try with meat and other vegetables next time.

Solid recipe - love the ginger flavor. I made the sauce the night before so it took next to nothing to make it tonight.

Perfect bok choy recipe. Follow ginger instructions to get juice for the sauce, you will not be disappointed. I doubled the sauce recipe since we had a little more bok choy and used some as a marinade for our steaks. Absolutely delicious.

I included 1 lb. of ground pork to make it a main course. Brown the pork, drain and remove and set aside. Cook ginger and bok choy until wilted, then add the pork along with the liquids/sauce. Really terrific

We loved it! I omitted giner and will use half of the pineapple juice next time since it was a bit more prominent than I wanted.

Simple, good dish. Nice sauce. I tried making this twice and used minced ginger from a jar the second time, it is not the same! But it's still good...

This is a very good side dish. I agree with the poster who cautioned against overcooking, especially since I prefer tender-crisp vegees. I suspect next time I will just use minced ginger from a jar to cut the prep time, as I doubt there would be much difference in flavor. Also, I added a sprinkle of sesame seeds ontop of the drizzle of sesame oil.

Easly overcooks. Stir fry for 2-3 minutes after adding sauce.

Simple and delicious. I served this to guests and wished I had doubled the recipe because it went in no time. Will definitely make this again.

I must admit that I was too lazy when I got home from work to juice the ginger...but it was still delicious. This sauce would be great for any veggie stirfry. One note - 3/4 lb of baby bok choy cooks down to next to nothing. There was only enough for 2 of us - but there was more than enough sauce so you could certainly increase the amount of greens.

This is a great side dish for an Asian chicken or beef dish. Squeezing the ginger juice does feel little trendy, but it works beautifully. The juice does tend to separate into juice and solid if it sits for more than a few minutes, so be sure to mix it before adding to the sauce.

I adore bok choy, baby or otherwise, and have tried lots of ways of cooking it but this is one of the best. It seems to me that making "ginger juice" may be a new in thing, and I wonder how authentic it is and whether they do this in Shanghai. Nevertheless, I went ahead and "juiced" the ginger, and left the resultant liquid on a saucer for a while in the kitchen,because I prepped all the ingredients for this a couple of hours ahead of time. When I got around to making the dish, the ginger juice had evaporated. But the end results were excellent anyhow, and I could have easily eaten the whole bowl, if I didn't have to fight my family for it.

For my first time making bok choy, this recipe had my husband and I craving for more! This was light and delicious. I loved the broth mixture so much I made it again and added spinach. That too, was good. :)

Nice, not spectacular, but a nice side dish... Easy and very tasteful. We've only recently seen these Baby Bok Choy in our supermarkets and reminds us of the Dim Sum in Hong Kong. And the Kids ate them.
