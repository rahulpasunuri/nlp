I'd put this at 3.5 forks, if I could. Following suggestions from others, I upped the amount of parsley, pine nuts, and dried fruit. I didn't have apricots around (and it's Christmas, so no stores were open today), I used dried figs instead. My wife and I both agreed they added a nice sweetness to the dish. Also, we used wild rice and did all broth (instead of 1/2 water) as others suggested. Finally, instad of softening the onions, I browned them. Made for a very rich and delicious pilaf. We had this with a dry rubbed pork roast and steamed spinach. All around delicious and easy to make. Would highly recommend this pilaf.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some dried apricots and came upon this. Different, but tasty. Might try using brown rice next time for a nuttier flavor.

Very good. I made this for the first time last night as part of a Valentine dinner and was very pleased at how easy and delicious it was. As other reviewers wrote, I will not hesitate to try with other variations. Also, see the "food dictionary" for the definition of converted rice, it's just parboiled.

What, dear folks, is "converted rice"???

We loved this recipe. Yes, next time I will add more pine nuts as recommended by other reviewers. I will also try other dried fruits (like cranberries)in future batches. My 9 year old loved it (and he's not much of a rice fan). And yes, it's South Beach compliant (Phase 2 and Phase 3).

One of the very best simple recipes on this site--and that's high praise! Any kind of dried apricot-like fruit (e.g., peach or nectarine) works very well, too. (The easiest way to chop dried fruit into the small pieces needed here is to snip it with kitchen scissors.) I always substitute toasted almonds for the pine nuts because they seem more flavorful.

This dish was absolutely delicious. My guests raved about it and all wanted the recipe. Went well with my baked chicken and sauce (1 bottle russian dressing, 1 jar apricot preserves, and 1 package lipton onion soup; stir and pour on chicken and bake 1 hour at 350 degrees). I highly recommend this rice, and will definitely make it again!

I am back making this dish for Valentine's Day. My family loved it and its a great way to use your dried apricots. I also added chopped dried pineapple (because I had it), and it was delicious. This would be a great dish to take to a large potluck! Note: I did use more parsley and more pine nuts than the recipe calls for also.

Yummy and excellent. I put in 1/3c chopped dried cranberries after the rice began to boil, and was much happier I predict than I would have been with apricot. Went nicely with some lamb meatballs. I agree, though, it could use at least a tablespoon more pine nuts, and probably some extra parsley. Excellent dish, nonetheless.

This was really good. I would suggest using only chicken broth to cook the rice in. Also I think that chopped dried cranberries would be a colorful and tasty addition. Definitely a keeper recipe.

I made this substituting raisins at the beginning if the cooking (instead of apricots at the end). I also used more pine nuts (can't get enough of them). It was the best rice pilaf I've had anywhere!
