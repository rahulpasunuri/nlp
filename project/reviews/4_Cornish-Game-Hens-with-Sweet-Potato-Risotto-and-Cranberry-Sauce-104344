I really enjoyed this dish, and it was very easy to follow this recipe. The cranberry sauce made it a good Valentine's Day dish. My local store didn't have Port wine, so I substituted Chianti, and likewise I had to substitute canned whole cranberries for fresh (aaargh!), but it still turned out pretty good.

This was great. There's plenty of room for substitutions and creativity in this recipe. I made the cranberry sauce with Grand Marnier instead of ruby port. I roasted the hens whole in my usual way (poured white wine in the bottom of the pan; rubbed hens with salt and pepper, and roasted at 350 until done). And I made the risotto in the traditional way, used Chardonnay and added cubed sweet potatoes about ten minutes into the cooking. I also added lots more grated ginger at the end and tossed in plain cream cheese at the end. We loved it and we'll be making this for guests tomorrow night.

I prepared the rice like a traditional risotto: toasting it in the pan then adding the wine, then a chicken stock slowly until fully absorbed. The lightly seasoned game hens complimented the rich flavors of the risotto. I gave the recipe 3 forks because I don't like their preparation of the rice, but it's easily a 4 fork meal if the risotto is done properly.

This made a remarkable meal. I did make a few adjustments to the recipe to ensure success. In the cranberry sauce, I added about a tablespoon of orange zest, a few tablespoons of orange juice and a few tablespoons of balsamic vinegar. I reduced the water to 3/4 cups and I only used a half of a cup of sugar. I added a teaspoon of rosemary when I pureed it at the end and this was a great sauce. I cooked the risotto in the traditional method, I started out by cooking the rice in 1/2 cup of Riesling and then I used a sodium free chicken stock to cook the rest of the risotto. I only used 1/3 cup of mascarpone. I baked the sweet potatoes in the oven the day before (I made the pieces a little bigger as well) and added them to the risotto at the end along with the mascarpone. Finally, I rubbed butter, thyme, salt and pepper under the skins of the cornish hens. It was perfection!

This is review of risotto only. I cooked the arborio risotto style with chicken stock adding in small doses and stirring. Otherwise followed the recipe. It was good, not great, but good. It did go VERY well with the wine-braised cabbage I served with it, like the creamy mild flavors offset well with the tang of the cabbage.

I made this tonight as a test run for a Thanksgiving side dish (sans hens, of course) and it was really delish. I prepared the risotto exactly as described and it was not overly time consuming (a HUGE consideration on the big day). I used a dry, fruity Chardonnay and it was fine. For Turkey day, I'll add some dried cranberries and plan to oven-roast the potatoes ahead to save on cooktop space. This is a quick and tasty keeper.

I wish there was a way to edit a previous post rather than creating a new one. Made it again. This time parboiled the potatoes and cooked them more slowly, which was a great improvement. But I still thought the Cornish hen was the best part of the dish -- and face it, it's just roast Cornish hen.

Since cranberries are out of season (It's late Jan) I made a L'orange sauce with Kumquats.Since after reading the other review it sounded like the risotto was sweet, thus the kumquats to ad some acid. Put a rub on the hens as another reviewer, and made the risotto the regular way. Also instead of cooking the sweet potatoes in the beginning, I roasted them and added them at the end with the marcapone. It was easy and turned out fabulous!!

Rating: 2
This was good, but I actually thought the crispy, juice Cornish hen was the best part. The cranberry sauce is extremely sweet, and another poster is correct that you cannot successfully saute the sweet potatoes at medium-high heat without burning the ginger. I will probably make it again, but next time I will cut the sweet potatoes even smaller than 1/2 inch and cook them more slowly. It is a very filling dish.

Delicious! Modifications: I doubled the cranberry recipe, added raspberry vinegar, less port, and more water. Pureed and ran through a sieve twice, made a smooth delicious drizzle sauce. Spiced the hens with fresh poultry herbs & butter under the skin. Basted once with butter/herb mixture. Used a convection oven at 375 for first half hour and upped to 450 for last 20 minutes. I'll cook at 400 next time for 20 minutes, then up to 450 for last 20 minutes. I'd like skin browner and crispier than it came out. I made the risotto the traditional way not according to the recipe (cooked full cup of rice and 1 1/2 cups yams). Doubled the ginger. Plating took a while - make sure the plates are warm so the dish doesn't lose heat while preparing all the servings. I will definitely make this dish again!

This was an incredible meal and very easy to prepare. My kids even loved it. I would easily make this for a dinner party. I agree that the cranberry sauce was thicker than I thought it should be, but very flavorful and a great combination with the sweet-potato risotto and savory hens.

Wow! This was great. My husband loved it and put the cranberry sauce on a bagel afterwards. I used 1/2 c sugar and reduced it a little too long so it was thick but delicious. I seasoned the hens with sage, italian herbs, kosher salt and Trader Joe's lemon pepper mix and basted with a bit of butter. I doubled the ginger and used Muscat, toasted pinenuts and skipped the parsley and orange peel. I hope I can do this again. It was amazing and not so difficult. You can make the cranberry sauce and rice while you are cutting the yams, onions and ginger. Be careful how long you cook the yams because they will get softer with the rice. Mine were mushy with the rice but still delicious.

I used about one cup of canned cranberry sauce with whole cranberries, a bit of chicken stock, and a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar for the sauce. I also made the risotto the traditional way as a previous reviewer recommended. Yummy!

This recipe is the perfect fall dinner and makes a beautiful presentation. After reading the previous reviews, I adjusted the recipe accordingly. I cut down on the sugar in the cranberry sauce and thinned it a bit with water so it wasn't quite so thick. I used twice the amount of ginger and a lot of salt and pepper in the risotto as I thought it needed more flavor. Another reviewer's suggestion of truffle salt on the hens sounded fabulous, so I brushed them with truffle oil during the last 15 minutes. My guests were delighted with the meal and everyone cleaned their plates, including my picky husband! :)

I prepared this for a dinner with a friend. It was delicious. I added mushrooms to the risotto. I also cut out the ginger as I did not have it on hand---fine without. Next time I will cut down on the suger in the sauce---too sweet. This is a do over!

This is one of my favorite, what-do-these- people-eat-and-why-did-I-invite-them-to- dinner-again, dinners. I find it simple, quick, & elegant. I make the risotto the "traditional" way, do not strain the cranberry sauce (make it in advance, the flavors marry more) and use toasted, pine nuts (my other half is allergic to nuts, so he gets seeds). The Cornish Game hens are easy (that being the operative word for this entire meal) and quite delightful, especially with a little truffle salt and butter under the skin. Garnish the plates with a touch of the parsley, serve a mixed green salad on the side, crusty garlic bread with Danish butter, nice bottle of dry, Alsatian Gewurztraminer (as the dry Riesling will be consumed by the time you finish making the dinner) and you have a dinner party.

I found this dish very disappointing. I made it for guests and we all agreed on the following points: The risotto was nothing special, the cornish hen was merely roasted and the cranberry sauce was better not strained--with all the seeds and skins in it. That said, it presents beautifully. Something needed to be done to kick up the flavors a notch, but I'm not certain what.

Made this one last night (doubled everything) and the risotto is the real star of this recipe. The cranberry sauce was okay, but really lacked something and tasted very similar to any bottled sauce (I am not sure if it was worth the effort, in a crunch you could probably just get away with bottled stuff). I think next time I will add some orange rind and fresh squeeze orange juice. The game hen is just your basic roasted chicken, but the risotto rocked the house. The Riesling wine and mascarpone cheese are really the 2 key ingredients. Overall, my guest's loved it and all plates were left empty. I would definately make this dish again :)

I made this for Thanksgiving for my husband and I and I feel like there is something missing from the "risotto." The hens were fantastic, I put a mixture of sage, rosemary, orange zest and olive oil under their skins and they were perfect. The risotto really left me wanting to add something more to it, but by the time I realized this I was serving it. The cranberry sauce is fantastic, I will make the hens and the cranberry again, I may work on the risotto to try and fix what is missing.

Outstanding, both in flavor and presentation. I served it with the arugula salad with pomegranate and toasted pecans and it was very festive. I made the risotto differently: sauteed/toasted in butter, then wine, then added about 3 cups of chicken stock 1/2 c. at a time, then vegetables and cheese. It was creamy and very flavorful. I did double the ginger (it was still subtle) and added quite a bit of pepper. I also rubbed the orange zest into the warm skins. Next time I will probably baste the hens to get a better crisp to the skin. Highly recommend this for company, but would cook the veggie portion ahead of time.

Simple, but prep everything first, because the cooking can be quite quick. Its not really risotto, but my husband loved it.

Rating for risotto...this is a great recipe if you're willing to adjust the proportions and process dramatically. This needs way more ginger, the veggies cook better in the oven than on the stove, the risotto should be made as a real risotto using some butter on the dry rice first until translucent, then adding the wine, then a total of 3-4 cups of chicken stock by the ladel as absorbed. Add the veggies to the risotto about 2 or 3 ladels before finishing so the potato can cook in a bit. I also recommend using ~1/3 the amount of marscapone called for in the recipe. Finally, be sure to add quite a bit of salt and pepper while cooking. I finished it with grated parmesan, which worked nicely.

I made this for a dinner club gathering. I allowed for one whole hen per person, but served them as suggested. The presentation was gorgeous. One half ended up being plenty as the risotto is VERY filling. The game hense were very good, but the real star is the risotto and the cranberry sauce. I think this recipe would work very well with chicken breasts or turkey tenderloins, it's just the presentation wouldn't be as good. A great company meal, especially around the holidays. Perhaps even a good substitute for a traditional Thanksgiving meal. Well worth making in my opinion.

I tried this for Christmas Eve dinner. It was delicious and a visual delight. I used one whole hen per person and would not want to serve less. I believe I will try using chicken breasts next time, as the game hen was fun, but rather labor intensive for the amount of meat. I will make this again and again!

This was a wonderful and elegant meal, not at all difficult either. I made the risotto in classic risotto style instead of making the rice seperately and it was delicious although took quite a while. I also inserted orange zest and sage under the skin of the bird and topped with paprika to give the birds a little umph og their own. great recipe!

I made this for Christmas dinner and doubled it for more guests (note: double your cooking time too, hens were underdone at time indicated and we had to keep the rest warm and wait). The risotto totally makes the dish! (I omitted the rice because we had pilaf as a side - didn't miss it at all). Next time, I'll add a little more port to the sauce, not that it was bad, just wasn't far from ordinary either. Overall an excellent meal - I'll make it again and again.

This was really good--I made it for Thanksgiving for a bit of a change and only 2 eating. I did, however, prepare the risotto like risotto--a little shallot, then the wine, then stirring and adding chicken stock as I went. Finally, I added the sweet potato and a little onion that I had sauted earlier and the mascarpone. The hens were very moist, but I did brine them for 6 hours. Would definitely make again.

The first recipe I've rated 4 forks. Not only did the hen come out moist and flavorful, but the cranberry sauce was a perfect compliment and the risotto made the dish. I also used 1 hen/person and it didn't seem too much. Great and easy and impressive dish.

I made this dish with Pheasant. Yummy! I roasted less time because we breasted the pheasant and I squeezed a little lime juice on the pheasants. I also slightly mashed the sweet potato mixture before adding the risotto. I think it really enhanced the risotto. The cranberry sauce is awesome. I saved it to serve with another meal.

I can only enjoy the chorus of praise for this dish. My wife and I wanted to test the dish before inflicting it on company, and in my test I used a small chicken, which I split and baked according to the recipe.

This recipe is outstanding and perfect for company. The timing was right on target, the presentation was wonderful and everything was delicious. Next time, however, I will make the cranberry sauce when I begin to cook the rest of the meal--I found that after refrigeration, it did not heat up to the smooth consistency it had when I first made it.

I also served the 1 cornish game hen per person (although I could only finish half of mine), my husband easily ate the whole little bird. I agree, that serving it whole adds to the "special occasion" feeling. I gotta admit, I wasn't way thrilled with it (like other reviewers). Maybe because I am not a big fan of cranberry sauce on poultry and I followed the recipe and "drizzled" the sauce around the risotto on the plate. It was a little too much, next time I will just put it on the side. However, my husband LOVED it, so the dinner was a success!

This recipe was easy and doubled well. I enjoyed watching my guests devour their meal. I had the butcher split my hens and remove the back bone. Most people can eat a whole hen, I wish I had served 2 halves to my guests! Next time I will try seasoning the birds a little more. I followed the time carefully, overcooking can dry out your hens. The sweet potato risotto is simple and tasty. I prepared the potato portion earlier in the day and refrigerated it. I did the same with the arborio rice (keeping them sperated). About a 1/2 hour before my guests arrived I mixed them together on the stove, heating it gradually. I then added the wine and finished with the marscapone cheese (try not to substitute here). The toasted walnuts added a nice texture, I omitted the orange peel due to time (it wasn't missed). The cranberry sauce adds a delightful flavor enhancement. Enjoy!

Truly impressive and delicious recipe! Your guests will think they are eating at the Four Seasons. My only challenge was keeping the yams from turning brown over medium high heat until tender. If using an electric range, I would suggest cooking them on medium/medium low for a longer period of time to avoid burning them. Any suggestions on preparing this dish in advance before your guests arrive, especially if you plan to serve appetizers beforehand?

Definitely one of the best recipes I have tried off this site! The cranberry sauce just completed the taste beyond compare! I have one recommendation, though, and that is to do the prep work first, as I had to leave the hens in the oven on warm while the rice cooked and I pureed the cranberry sauce. It was an easy recipe, though, when all is said and done. I will probably make the risotto again as a side dish for other poultry recipes. It was excellent! I was nibbling on it before I added the mascarpone, and I actually thought it tasted better without. Definitely a make again, and most definitely for guests!!

Great sauce and wonderful flavors. I used a chicken instead of game hens and cooked it about 15 minutes longer on 450*. The bird came out golden and crispy on the outside. I was out of Port for the sauce, so I used dry sherry instead and added a tsp of ground ginger. It was terrific!

Yummy. Definitely company-worthy. I was skeptical about how all the distinct flavors would meld and was pleasantly surprised. Also, I was skeptical about how the hens could stay moist with no basting. The technique of cutting them in half, baking breast-side down kept the meat juicy and skin crispy.

This is really a great dish and very easy to prepare. The presentation is nice, and it needs no other accompaniment - although a salad starter would be nice for a company meal. Yum. We served a whole hen for each diner.Loved the walnuts, parsley and orange zest. Can use vermouth instead of Riesling.

I used this recipe for a family dinner party. It was easy to prepare. The sweet potatoes took a longer amount of time to cook - but I like tender sweet potatoes. Everyone was impressed with not only the presentation, but the great tasting (and filling) meal. The best part of the meal was when my mother asked where I found the recipe. I mentioned that it originated from the Williamsburg Inn, not realizing that my parents honeymooned there 33 years ago!

I just made this for a dinner party and everyone loved it. I served a full hen per person and the presentation was beautifulm though several guests said a full hen was a little too much. It also took me much longer to reduce the sauce. I tripled the recipe to serve for 12. If you double or triple the recipe, DO NOT change the amount of sugar in the cranberry sauce. You still only need 1 cup of sugar, double or triple everythinbg else. I had to make the sauce three times before I figured out I needed to leave the amount of sugar unchanged. Also, the risotto looks nice with smaller peices of sweet potato vs. 2 inch chunks. I did not change the cooking time for the hens even though I cooked 12 full hens. I followed the timing onthe recipe and they cooked perfectly. Very nice recipe.
