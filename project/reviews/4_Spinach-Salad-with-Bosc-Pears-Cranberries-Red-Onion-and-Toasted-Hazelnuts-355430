I am making the salad for a third day in a row. It is wonderful, and received rave review by family members. My first attempt, I found 1 teaspoon of salt too much for our taste, so I modified it to only 1/4 teaspoon, and it was much better. Also, I used candied pecans, which worked just fine.

Everyone wanted the recipe! And it is so easy! I soaked the cranberries in orange juice, and used 2 tbs of hazelnut oil to replace 2 of EVO. OMG delicious.

followed except eyeballed the ingredients for the dressing and subbed toasted pine nuts as i had them. i think gorgonzola might add another note and will try it next time. lovely salad. served with rack of lamb chermoula from this site and oven roasted potatoes. spectacular.

Ahh this was so good! Made this for Thanksgiving and it was my favorite thing on the menu. So simple, but the flavors were fantastic. I substituted candied walnuts for the roasted hazelnuts. Make sure you soak the onions and the cranberries - a winner.

Meant to add...definitely soak the sweetened cranberries in the dressing and soak the onions in water...it made a big difference.

A big hit and I've been asked for the recipe. I used 'pecan pie pecans' instead of hazelnuts - the sweetness was a treat. The dressing really benefits from the shaking. I put on the dressing then found out that Thanksgiving was going to be delayed 30 min, and even though it was 'wilted' there wasn't a drop left.

This salad was delicious - a nice change from the usual recipes that include goat cheese. Served it with the turkey pot pie with cheddar crust from this site. Easy and quick. Do not omit the onion-soaking step. it is essential to keep the onion flavor in balance.

The hazelnuts are fabulous and something different. I agree with the previous reviewer - don't change a thing when making this salad - it's delicious as is. Great starter for smoked turkey meal because of the smokiness of the nuts.

Good recipe. Not sure why people rate this salad so high and then say they have changed a major ingredient... The key to this salad is the toasted Hazelnuts. They give it its distinction!

LOVE IT. Made for Thanksgiving last year, got great reviews from everyone. The family requested I bring it again this year. My little tweak was to exchange the cranberries for pomegranate and I added blue cheese crumbles.

Awesome, awesome salad. Made exactly as written, except for using pecans instead of hazelnuts, as I didn't have any. I also didn't quite use all the dressing and it was plenty.

This salad made a great starter for our Thanksgiving feast. I couldn't find a ripe pear so used thinly sliced apple. I followed a reviewer recommendation to substitute Sweet and Spicy Candied Pecans for the hazelnuts - great. One thing to note: 1 tsp. of fine sea salt is too much for this recipe (Kosher salt or course sea salt is not as dense, therefore less salty). I realized this too late but rescued the dressing with a good glug of orange juice to cut the saltiness. This made the dressing just perfect and I would probably do the same again. Guests all enjoyed the result.

This has got to be my all time favorite for a special salad. I used cashew nuts that I roasted. I have had 4 luncheons and all wanted the recipe--it is easy if you have the spinach washed and dried. The red onions are heavenly and not strong after soaking in cold water for 30 min. I serve this with a warm Gluten-free, Wheat-free and Lactose-free roll that has Verde Pesto, slices of Parmesan Cheese,and Jamon Serraono slices. (Dried & Salted Pork) Easy and so good as well as healthy!!!

I have served this salad twice for brunch and it is a big hit. Love the hazelnuts. I tend to use only 1/2 the dressing so I just make 1/2 of it or double the salad.

This was a delicious spinach salad. I brought it to some friends' house for dinner and everyone raved. I made a couple adjustments: I added sauteed shallots to the dressing and used toasted walnuts instead of the hazelnuts. Will definitely make this again!

I brought this to a dinner party last night and it received rave reviews. I had burnt the hazelnuts so improvised with toasted sliced almonds...still delicious. Planning to make this again Christmas Eve - wish me luck with the hazelnuts!

So easy and the flavors were outstanding together. A beautiful salad to display. I tossed the spinach only in the dressing, the carefully laid paper-thin slices of red onion on top, fanned thinly sliced pear and then sprinkled with the cranberries & hazelnuts. Each salad bowl got a bonus wedge of blue stilton place just at the apex of the fanned pear. BEAUTIFUL presentation and I must say I've never had a salad devoured that quickly. Stunning for the holidays!!

perfect! made it for thanksgiving and everyone raved and wanted seconds even with the rest of the meal waiting to be served! I did go to the extraordinary length of buying hazelnuts in the shell and cracking them myself(had read an article in NY times food sect. that touted the difference btw. fresh nuts and preshelled nuts the later generally kinda stale) and wow did it make a huge difference,the nuts were rediculously good,but wouldn't take the time for everyday fare.

Incredible. Served this at a dinner party and received rave reviews. Followed the recipe to a "T", including the "Do Ahead" directions. Creating a mise en place-setup made this a snap to toss together after company arrived.

I thought this salad was wonderful. Easy and appropriate any time of year. Someone else recommended soaking the cranberries ahead of time - I just threw them in the dressing and let them marinate for a few hours. I'm not someone who measures ingredients, and this recipe holds up really well to minor changes.

What a crisp, refreshing salad. Make a little extra of the dressing, it is outstanding. Couldn't get the hazelnuts, so subbed with the cashews. The boyfriend couldn't get enough - and he's not a "salad" guy!

Great salad. I think roasting the hazelnuts and soaking the cranberries make a difference - I would not skip those steps. I do think that it might benefit from a crumbled cheese - perhaps blue cheese. I have made this twice - once with no cheese and once with goat cheese crumbled on top. I did not think the goat cheese had enough flavor. Next time I am going to try a mild blue cheese.

This has become a new staple in our kitchen. I use a little less than a teaspoon of sugar and sometimes substitute the hazelnuts with walnuts. Always delicious!

This is an amazing salad! My guests raved about it and asked for the recipe. I didn't have time to soak the onions and cranberries so I just tossed everything together and it was perfect. Oh, I used glazed pecans that I purchased from the store. Yummy! This is my new go to salad.

Yep, I loved this one too. This recipe writer must be a master, with the great tips she gives. The dressing is the standard, but tweaked a little. My guests all loved it too. I forgot to get the pears, so I used an apple (I think it was Gala) instead. Still great. Also toasted the filberts on the stovetop as oven was in use! Thanks for this recipe!

It's rare that salad becomes the focus of a Thanksgiving dinner, but this dish was talked about more than the turkey! My friend who never eats salad had two helpings, and I've been asked to make it again for gatherings. Definitely follow the directions about the onion and cranberries--these little touches make all the difference. Delicious!

We absolutely loved this recipe...even my step son, who's not crazy about salad on a good day! As other reviewers suggested, I used white balsamic vinegar and cut down on the amount of olive oil...used just over half of what was recommended. Also didn't have whole-grain mustard, so used Dijon, and it was just fine. I will definitely make this again!

I just joined this site because I wanted to leave this review. I made this salad for a Christmas party last night and another one this afternoon. At both, this salad got rave reviews. Even people who do not normally like salad enjoyed this one. And among those with refined tastes, many commented that it was one of the most interesting and tasty. So, when I join some other friends on Christmas, I plan to make it again. You cannot go wrong--this is definitely a winner! Happy holidays to all.

Outstanding Salad! My contribution to Thanksgiving dinner was a salad. Since salads are secondary, I though I would please myself by taking a nutritious salad. To my surprise, the salad turned out to be the HIT of the dinner. Everyone loved the salad and asked for the recipe. I followed recipe, except that I soaked onions for an hour and served them on the side. I added Gorgonzola cheese. I agree that the hazelnuts are essential.

This salad served as a point of departure for me. The bosc pears were too hard, so I used thinly sliced Granny Smith apples, and slivered almonds instead of filberts. I also added dried apricots which I chopped roughly. The vinigrette was exceptional, but I used white balsamic vinegar instead of dark. I will use this salad again.

Made this salad as part of my birthday meal. This is a very good salad. Wonderful combination of flavors. Soaking red onin in cold water to crisp and tone down the raw flavor was on the money and we all agreed it would be something we would do when raw onions are called for in a recipe. We did not like the hazelnuts whole because they fell to the bottom of your salad portion. We will crush them up to better distribute the flavors. My father, who we were not sure was going to like the raw spinach, to our great suprise, ate about two-thirds of the entire recipe before starting the main dish.

This is a fantastic salad. I made this for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it. I couldnt find hazelnut, so I used walnuts halves, crushed them up and tossed them in the salad. I also added some fresh mango and a can of mandarin oranges, which added some nice flavor. I placed the onions in ice water for about 30 minutes. Once I was done with the entire salad I place it in the refrigerator for an hour along with bowls (so they would be nice and cold when served). I will defiantly make this dish again and add it to my favorites. Next time I might try and find hazelnuts.

What a fabulous salad recipe! I even love the dressing... which is hard for me to like dressings with mustard. My husband doesn't normally like raw onions, but the soaking technique really subdues the oniony taste... will use it from now on!

This has become a "go to" salad for me and I've made it multiple times since it was published in November. I've found it to be versatile enough for a dinner party or a simple dinner. I've switched out almost every ingredient except the pears and dressing and it is a hit every time.

You can also use Asian Pears (one huge one is enough). I used them because I did not have the regular pears at that moment in my fridge. Onion Optional. Cranberries can be soaked directly in the dressing. You simply retrieve them once ready to serve. I did it twice already and at both time everyone was amazed by how well these ingredients complemented each other

Excellent, people loved it. We used about 1/2 the dressing and it was plenty. I'll double the spinach next time too there was too much stuff to greens for us.

I have made it several times. Starting with Thanksgiving-it was a hit! I cut back the oil and put in a little red wine vinegar in the dressing and put goat cheese or flavored feta on top. I soak the onions for longer to get the bit out.I doubled the dressing and use it for many salads. I plan to take the dressing out of town with us and get the rest of the ingredients locally for Christmas dinner.

Forgot to add in my prior review that, as others noted, the recipe made more dressing than needed for the amount of greens called for. Don't just dump in on as I did - add a bit at a time until the salad is dressed as you like it.

Made this for Thanksgiving and every bit of it was eaten up. It was really delicious - far better than I expected from a rather simple recipe. Soaking the cranberries in dressing was a great idea - plumped them up and gave them a complexity they would otherwise lack. Soaking the onion in water, however, didn't do much to remove the rawness as promised. Am making it again for a Hannukah dinner this week.

I fixed this with Roasted Fennel with Pork Loin. It was a great combination of flavors and even the kids liked it. Soaking the onions does help remove the sharp bite. And this is pretty witht he different colors.

This recipe is a keeper! I did make a couple of changes. I decreased the oil by half and increased the balsamic by a tablespoon. I didn't have the whole grain mustard on hand and instead used Grey Poupon. I omitted the sugar because my mother is watching her sugar intake. It was FANTASTIC!

I made this for our Thanksgiving dinner. It was excellent, and has been requested for Christmas dinner as well. A double recipe served 20 with no problem, but we had a lot of dishes to choose from. I used less than half of the dressing, because it just seemed like too much. Also used toasted cashews because the hazelnuts are too much of a pain. Very tasty...a new family holiday staple.

Rating: 4
We also made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was the first empty serving bowl on our table! We also thought the dressing called for too much oil and cut it back before adding to the salad. We actually forgot to add the pears and it was still a hit - I think because of the techniques - making sure the cranberries were soft/plump, putting the onion in cold water, and using baby spinach.

I made this salad for Thanksgiving and was sorely disappointed. The salad ingredients went well, but I found the dressing very heavy and oily, even though I did cut down the olive oil by two tablespoons. If you make this, I would recommend either serving the dressing on the side, or choosing a lighter dressing.

Made this salad for a dinner party and it was mmmmmmm'd by everyone. I cut the pears ahead and added a little lemon juice to prevent oxidation and then placed them in a sealed baggy until I was ready to put the salad all together. Toasting the hazelnuts is a must --- makes them so yummy. The dressing is easy and perfectly seasoned. I followed the recipe exactly and found the combination of flavors fabulous. Would make this again and again. Healthy too.

I used white balsamic vinegar because that was all I had on hand. The dressing was nice and light and paired really well with the salad. I loved the Bosc pear. It had the texture of a vegetable, slightly crisp, but had a nice suble sweet flavor that paired well with the dried cranberries. I really enjoyed it and my husband who doesn't like vinegar thought it was tasty. I think it tasted like a salad you would pay a lot for at a good restaurant. This would make a nice addition to the Thanksgiving table.
