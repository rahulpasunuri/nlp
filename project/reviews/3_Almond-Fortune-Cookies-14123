Yes! This recipe works! Withheld one star because it didn't mention dribbling in enough water to make the batter like a thin pancake dough, but picked that up from someone else's tip. With the added water the recipe will make about 12 cookies at 2 tsp batter per cookie. Use parchment paper and no grease at all; draw a 3" circle onto the paper or trace a standard canning jar lid, and have two pans alternating, baking one cookie at a time. Time consuming, yes, but makes for good results. AS SOON AS the edge starts browning, pull the pan out of the oven, and pop the pan with the next pre-spread cookie in; then immediately slide the baked cookie off with spatula, gently and with determination; flip it, insert (rolled) fortune, fold cookie, and hold to set the shape for a minute. I can't comment on the flavour, but how offensive can these ingredients be? (I used a little almond essence instead of nuts.) Smells sweet and eggy. Made these with quotes about love, on little rolled scrolls, for a Valentine's do. Will make again.

Don't waste your time! I tried this recipe because it looked easy, they're completely cakey and you can't fold them. There much better recipes for fortune cookies.

I have tried a number of recipes and this was AWFUL. The texture, the flavor everythin makes you wish for a stale resurant cookie in a wrapper.

Fun to do; thanks for the almond extract tip. My tip? Use a silicone sheet trading off between 2 metal cookie sheets, transferring the silicone to the COOL cookie sheet to prepare each batch. The temperature matters: a cool temp keeps the butter congealed, while a warm sheet causes the butter to shrink into weird shapes which will take the batter with it.

The cookie its self is very good. But I found it to be a little too "cakie" when it came time to fold it- which resulted in a not so pretty, homespun fortune cookie. My guests loved them nonetheless!

Don't understand all the kvetching. Replace the almonds with extract, thin them out a little, and cook til the edges are brown. Remove them right away, put the fortune in, fold and put in a muffin tin or egg carton to shape. These aren't supposed to be dessert, people - they're supposed to be fun conversation pieces. Although they're the best fortune cookies you can have! I use them for corporate training - I put quotes in about leadership, coaching, whatever the topic is.

A different Richmond cook here! (Hi fellow Richmonder who commented last!) I made these fortune cookies as described, but I had a problem I wonder if any of you can help with. After folding them with the fortune inside, the fortunes ended up sticking to the dough in the middle of the cookie, so that when the people opened them, the fortunes ripped in half. (They got stuck right in the center crease.) What a bummer! I thought I had them baked just to the right temperature for flexibility, but maybe I didn't do them long enough? Did anyone else have this problem?

This recipe didn't work for me as written. I omitted the almonds, adding instead 1/4t of almond extract. I then had to add 1-2 tablespoons of water to thin the batter to what I would call a thick-glaze consistency. I had to use baking spray with flour in it ON my silpat and baked the cookies for 6 minutes and they turned out beautifully. Many practice batches but I finally got it right and they're impressive!

absolute rubbish, i spent ages doing the fortunes and cookies came out too thick and would bend, i tried adding water and almond extract, still didnt work...how disappointing!!!

Another variation is to use macadamia nuts instead of almonds. I dipped a corner of each cookie into melted chocolate and sprinkled with more chopped macadamias. I too was able to turn out two at a time and let them cool in a muffin pan. These were delicious -- and beautiful!

This is an easy and fun recipe. I made them for a dinner party with a Chinese theme and they were a huge hit! I did add almond extract as suggested from previous reviewer-so delicious!

This was a fantastic recipe! I made a quad batch and used 1 teaspoon almond extract. The extract helped to make it the perfect consistency. My kids and their friends wrote coded messages and drew pictures to go inside. I used silpat on a baking sheet (still needed to use some butter). Spread it with a spatula as thin as crepes. I was able to cook 2 at a time. Immediately take the first one off, insert the message and hang to dry. The second one, form on the cookie sheet (helps to keep it pliable). If the second one gets too stiff, pop it back in the oven for 10-15 seconds and it will be workable again. I found it best to have a little browning around the edges--then the cookies were slightly crispy when they cooled. These worked fabulously and were a huge hit. Friends remarked how great tasting they were and we agree!

This was really easy. I tripled the recipe and it came out just fine. I agree with previous reviewers that you have to make sure that you spread the batter very thin - almost to the point of tranlucency. Maybe it was because I tripled it, but I found the batter very thick and a bit hard to spread - so I added a few drops of water. I didn't bother waiting for the cookie sheet to cool - it made the batter easy to spread. I spread the batter in a slighter larger circle than called for, which made handling the cookies and getting my fortunes in easier. Finally, I wore rubber dishwashing gloves, which made the hot-hot-hot cookies a lot easier to fold and handle. The tip about using a muffin pan for cooling worked great! And, everybody loved the cookies - I couldn't believe that 8 people ate them all - and had a real hoot over my "fortunes."

Good fortune cookie recipes are hard to find, but this one is pretty terrific! It doesn't really taste like the packaged ones in Chinese restaurants, but then again, woulkd you really want them to? These are light, crisp, and a bit on the sweet side. If you bake 2-3 on a Silpat mat, they gold perfectly and come right off. Fold and work quickly and leave them in a muffin pan to cool and shape - but expect to burn your fingertips a little. Here's a tip - spread the batter very thinly, until almost transparent. These cookies also keep in an airtight jar for a good while.

I use a muffin tin to hold the cookies in shape as they cool, just stick the pointed ends down into the tin. I omitted the almonds, added vanilla extract and sprinkled them with sesame seeds right before baking for a different texture.

I LOVE this recipe! I have made several batches of cookies and I let my friends write funny fortunes to put inside of them. I am suprised at how easy they are to make. Be sure to only make one or maybe two at a time. I ignored this rule at first and ended up with a lot of cracked looking cookies. If you fold the cookie right after it gets out of the oven it will be nice and smooth. Great recipe!

I tried out the recipe for a game for a PartyLite party which I knew close friends would be attending. We found it tasty and they liked the gifts they could win by booking a show of their own. Booked 3 shows! The only thing I couldn't figure out is how to bend and shape it like the premade fortune cookies.

I think these were really good and fun to make. The first few were chewy because I poured the batter too thick. You really need to pour about a teaspoon plus and spread it out from the center with the back of a spoon. The dough almost needs to look transparent (those were the ones that turned out the crispiest). They definitely didn't look like the one's in a chinese restaurant, but that's the fun of homemade.

I found these cookies to be limp and chewy rather than crispy. Both the flavor and the appearance were bland. I wouldn't recommend making this one.

I, too, substituted almond extract for the almonds. I really wanted this recipe to work, so I kept at it. But I never had any of the cookies turn out nicely. The batter was good though!

This was extremely easy and loads of fun. The personalized fortunes surprised and entertained my guests. I took the suggestion to substitute almond extract and was pleased with the results. The hint for turning the cookies on to a clean towel was also a great idea. I didn't do so well hanging the cookies to cool. Instead, I shaped them and placed them on a cold marble slab - gently holding the shape - until they cooled enough to hold shape on their own.

These cookies were fun and easy to make. I substituted 3/4 tsp. almond extract for the almonds. The flavor was great and my guests loved the personalized fortunes. This is a super recipe to make with kids but they should not handle the cookie when folding etc. because they are HOT, HOT, HOT!

These cookies were a mess-free delicious treat! We had to subtsitute almonds for vanilla extract, but it still tasted great!

I deleted the almonds and added almond extract for a more authentic feel. I baked the cookie until just bubbling on the sheet, folded them on a clean dish towl, and draped them over the edge of a tall glass. They turned out perfect!

What a mess! The cookies stuck together and the fortunes were impossible to pry from the cookie. The flavor was good, though (I added some almond extract) but this is a lot of work for very little payoff. I'll buy fortune cookies.
