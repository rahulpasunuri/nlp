Yum! Yum! New favorite cookie. So glad I made these. Perfect for the chocoholics.

These were by far the best cookies I've tasted in a long time. Crispy on the outside, with a slight chewy consistency on the inside. Very light, while not being too chocolaty. I especially love the use of brown sugar, which adds a nutty toffee-like flavor. Bravo!

I loved these cookies and gave them as gifts. They were soft when I took them out of the oven, but crisped nicely on the rack.

I should have been able to tell from looking at this recipe that the cookies would be greasy. They ended up like any cookie with too much butter, flattening out in the oven and having a greasy texture and flavor. I let them cool in the pan and they weren't completely crisp, which is what I wanted. I like the idea for this cookie, and might try a different with similar ingredients.
