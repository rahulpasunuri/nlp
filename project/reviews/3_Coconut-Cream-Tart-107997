This is excellent if you make the changes recommended by Gourmet magazine , which are to increase the cornstarch to 6 TBLS and use 2 large egg yolks instead of 2 eggs. I have also found if you cook the cream and cream of coconut (I use a 8.5 oz Coco Lopez) til thick, that you only need 5 TBLS of cornstarch. I also add toasted coconut to the top which I think is key.

Ok I made some small changes. I didn't have coconut extract so I used vanilla, I also added some vanilla seeds. For the topping I used a 1/2 cup sour cream to really make it tangy. I, like many others could not get it to set. So I baked it 15 mins at 350. It was wonderful. I will be making it again and again. It says dessert for 12 people- I served it to 7 and only 1 slice was left. I don't have a tart pan so I made it in a pie plate.

I've made many tarts and this one sounded so yummy. I was very disappointed. The pudding was way too sweet and didn't set up, even though I added 2 extra tablespoons of corn starch. And the crust was just ok. I did like the addition of sour cream to the topping as it help cut the sweetness overall. I wouldn't take the time to make this again :(

My daughter and I made 5 coconut pies before finding this gem. Its not baked in the oven, so it is extra creamy and delicious. I leave out the sour creme from the topping because we prefer it that way. This recipe is the best!

This was horrible and bland. It was fairly easy to make, and the crust had potential but overall the finished product was not worth the time and price of ingredients. The 6 tablespoons of cornstarch made the filling the texture of rubber and the flavor was rather bland and yet strange at the same time. The topping should have been much sweeter. Overall, I would not recommend.

I am reviewing the coconut cream only...I made my own shortbread crust recipe (one I've used for many years) to which I added about 1 c. shredded sweetened coconut to & prebaked. I had no problems with the custard setting up and made the recipe as directed (did not add additional egg or cornstarch). I did allow my eggs to come up to room temperature before adding to the hot custard with the extract, I poured it into the crust, allowed to cool. Then placed in the fridge until it was set with a piece of waxed paper on top. I did not make the topping the recipe called for. This is a very rich dessert as it is and the addition of sour cream sounded like too much for me. I think just some light whipped topping is plenty.

The filling did not set even using 5 Tbsp of cornstarch and 2 egg yolks. Next time I'd try the 6 Tbsp cornstarch and egg yolks and cook a little longer. In spite of the runny filling it was absolutely delicious! I toasted the remaining coconut and used it as a garnish which really brought everything together. Everyone raved and wanted me to make it again!

Why wasn't the recipe itself updated when the editors made changes to firm up the custard? It shouldn't be necessary to read all the reviews to find that out. I was goint to add this to my Tastebook, but decided not to because I can't edit the recipe based on the editors' recommendations.

Have made the custard recipe twice now paired with mango pudding. I prefer 5 tbs cornstarch to 6 tbs recommended most recently by the Gourmet staff. 6 tbs makes the custard too rubbery. Nice flavor, not creamy, too rubbery. Still looking for the perfect coconut cream custard.

The tart filling was good, but the crust was spectacular! Guests loved this. I served it with fresh raspberries and chocolate sauce drizzled over everything.

The tart turned out exactly as I expected, and was a hit at dinner! A definite repeat. I followed the changes listed in the reviews and had no problem with the custard firming up. The taste was great! Not too sweet, the topping is a nice balance and the crust was perfect accent! Great recipe!

I have made this recipe several times with no problems, this is a standard. I think that I have made it after it has been modified by the editors. The cookie crust is soo good, and the cream topping layer is a nice not-too-sweet compliment.

I was so excited to make this recipe as I love vanilla, hazelenuts and coconut. Sadly, I was disappointed. This is a very average tasting pie and not worth the time or effort.

Because of the large number of people who had problems with this recipe, the Gourmet food editors retested it. We also had problems with the recipe as printed, but after several attempts we came up with a solution we're happy with. Follow the recipe with these changes: Increase the cornstarch from 5 tablespoons to 6 tablespoons. Change 2 large eggs to 2 large egg yolks. Hope this helps.

I followed directions exactly. The custard did not set. The crust was nice; might use it for something else.

This tasted good, but the awful (runny) presentation just wasn't worth it. There's no reason for it to be called a tart - this is coconut cream pie and nothing more. As previous cooks have, I also wondered why eggs should be added, as they did nothing more than ruin the thickness of the coconut cream mixture. In the unlikely event that I make this again, I would try omitting the eggs. The crust was the best part.

Like many of you, my custard didn't set up dispite a bit of extra cornstarch and 2 more yolks (as some suggested to use). It was the eggs that ruined it. The custard was nice and thick until I added eggs and extract. Question - is there a concern serving this dessert to some as the eggs are not cooked? Or is the mixing of eggs into hot custard good enough. Why add the eggs at all? The taste was more curious - enjoyable, then delicious. Will try this again as I have a bunch of coconut cream to use (unless someone can suggest another recipe that uses coconut cream?)

I also had a soup instead of a tart even though I followed the recipe exactly. The guests loved it anyway. I may try making it as a pudding and making the crust into "cookies" to serve with it.

I did think that this recipe was a little more time consuming thatn I thought, however this was so delicious that my guests who tried this each had a second helping even though they were full. The coconut in the crust definately made a difference and dont coco lopez cream was an essential ingredient! I skipped the sugar and sour cream for the topping, just did some honey and whipping cream. This is a must do recipe if you decide to make it coconut!

I finally got it to set up (it took 3 times). I cooked it for 2 minutes, put it in the shell and baked it for 20 min.,it just started to puff up and set up about 2in. around the outside. It tasted great and held its shape.

good recipe. i added two extra egg yolks. everything turned out fine. however, i did make one mistake - i added too much of the cream of coconut. so it was very "perfumey" but it did set well and i did receive a couple of compliments. had i not made that error, it would've turned out very well. delicious crust.

it looked hard but it was easy after you got started. even when i added the whole milk and coconut cream together and then mixed the the heavy cream and corn starch it worked just fine anyway. my husband liked it but wanted to add coconut to the filling next time. i don't eat coconut but i did this one. i added some flaked coconut to the top. looked really nice.

I was a little nervous to attempt this recipe given some of the reviews, but I made sure I had coconut cream, not the coconut milk, and it turned out beautifully. I probably cooked it 2 minutes rather than just 1. I added 2 more teaspoons of sugar to the topping. I have made it twice this week. This will be a requested family favorite.

I think the problem with it not setting up for those who DID use the cream of coconut rather than milk could be due to either the eggs not being cooked though, or the starch bonds being broken. The latter issue was addressed in an old issue of Cook's Illustrated. Once the filling is properly cooked, it should be poured immediately into the crust or into another pie plate to cool for 30 minutes only. Then it can be gently nudged (not spooned) into the crust with a rubber spatula. Stirring or whisking after it starts to create the starch bonds will break them down and prevent the setting up.

After reading the other reviews for this recipe I reduced the milk to 1/2 cup and cooked the custard for few more minutes. The custard set up beautifully.

Soup it was for me too. I used cream of coconut and stirred it for about 5 minutes and it looked like it set up nicely. Poured it into shell and two hours before put the whipped cream on top, making sure it too was thick. Upon serving, it all turned to soup and instead of a tart, I served it in bowls. the crust too was a disappointment, you really needed to half the recipe, as written it is far too much for the shell. This was a major disappointment.

I followed another review and added 2 more eggs and 2 egg yolks for the custard. I also could not find coconut extract so I used almond. I finished with toasted coconut. Looked great, and was a hit.

My guests raved about this even though it was like soup. I would make it again and try cooking longer or maybe adding gelatin.

Delicious! It got rave reviews & I had no problems with it setting at all. Using cream of coconut (and not coconut milk) is essential or else you're just making coconut soup. I'll have to make it again -- I keep getting demands for more!

I recently rediscovered how good anything coconut is, so this was right up my alley. My custard didn't set very well either, but my friends didn't seem to care. I'll definitely make it again because everyone loved it so much, even if it was kind of messy. Also, I made a little more than the recipe called for and made individual tarts using mini tart pans. This helped with the appearance because you couldn't tell that the custard was runny.

I got the recipe out of the magazine and made it for Easter. I am only just now reading the reviews and I wish I had read them first. I couldn't get the custard to set and after reading reviews I think I should have cooked it longer than 1 minute. I would try again since the taste was absolutely sublime. I would also whip the cream longer since that turned out runny also. I would make it again since it was delicious. For those having trouble finding Coconut Cream, look in the Goya section of your supermarket.

I loved this recipe. I used the suggestion of adding a package of unflavored geletain to the coconut mixture. I also decided to freeze the entire dessert. It was wonderful and got rave reviews from all my guests.

I had no problems with this dessert, custard set up fine. It took maybe 1.5 minutes instead of 1 but I wonder if the problem is using coconut milk instead of the cream of coconut? I finally found cream of coconut, not in the international foods section of the grocery store, but the bartender/drink mixes section.

I tried the suggestion of additional cooking time and 2 egg yolks--mine still didn't set. The flavor was grand, but presentation pretty poor. I'd use the crust recipe for something else--that was wonderful and very easy to prepare.

I could only find coconut milk not cream and after reading the difference in the gourmet glossary ( milk has 4 parts water whereas cream has 1) I cooked the coconut milk first and reduced it. I followed the remaining instruction and got a rather nice pie. However the chocolate syrup recipe in the data base and sliced bananas great enhanced the experience.

After reading several reviews, I changed the recipe. I cooked the filling for 5 minutes instead of 1, and I then added 2 whole eggs plus 2 egg yokes and cooked the mixture over very low heat for about 2 extra minutes. The filing set up right away and everyone raved about the desert.

I would make this recipe again, but I would omit the sour cream in the topping and just use whipping cream and sugar. The sour cream was too heavy, and the dessert needed some oomph. We used this recipe for a gourmet night and all were expecting a sweet rich dessert, and unfortunately this didn't meet expectations. It was rich, but not sweet.

The coconut cream was absolutely delicious, as was the crust, but the cream wouldn't set up. After 24 hours, it was minimally set, but by then the crust was soggy. I would love to be able to make it again for guests, but won't do that unless I can figure out the problem with the filling.

This tart was excellent. I didn't have any trouble with the filling. It didn't set up really firm, but it wasn't a problem. The only change I made was to add a bit more sugar to the topping.

This was tasty, but as the former reviewer stated, it didn't congeal. I didn't even bother to add the topping because it sprawled all over the plate, ultimately making the crust soggy. I used the best quality shortbread cookies I could buy, and it really made a difference in the crust (which was really yummy).

Delicious recipe...and very easy to make. Only problem I had was that the coconut cream did not congeal as it should have.
