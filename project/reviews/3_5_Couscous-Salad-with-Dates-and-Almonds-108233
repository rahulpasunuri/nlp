Have made this delightful dish many times. The wonderful thing about this recipe is its unusual mix of flavors: the sweetness of cardamom and dates with the distinctive lemon flavor transforms the neutral couscous and garbanzos. Cilantro adds another layer, so your palate is continually discovering a new dimension. It's subtle with lots of depth. I don't like raw scallions, so I left them out. Still plenty to delight the tastebuds. A great summer recipe.

Unusual, but really tasty. Taking a tip from another poster, I added a touch of cinnamon after putting the salad together because the cardamom seemed a little one dimensional. The cinnamon made it fantastic. I could also see making the dressing with ras el hanout to give it more depth next time.

This was a very flavorful and different way to prepare couscous salad compared to the more savory versions I usually make. I pretty much followed this recipe with only two changes. Didn't have dates so substituted diced dried apricots, and used fresh lemon zest instead of lemon peel. And I did add a bit more olive oil prior to serving which I then mixed into the salad. Served this with a piece of grilled local rockfish that was baked in a light sauce of butter and lemon juice with lemon slices for garnish. Simple and great light meal for spring or summer. I'm thinking I could add cubed chilled grilled chicken to the couscous salad next time and serve as a main course with some pita and hummus.

This recipe is fantastic! I use whole wheat couscous and double the recipe for lunches for the week. I have left out the garbanzo beans but it would be healthier with them.

Great summer dish - sweet,lemony and crunchy. Prepared day before a sailing trip. Added dressing and toasted almonds on board and let sit for 2 hours. Served with Piri-Piri Chicken,Spicy Napa Cabbage Slaw with Cilantro and Zucchini Cornbread. A great combination. Couscous salad was just as good two days later. I rate this 4 Flags

Made this for a Hanukkah dinner party last night and it was delicious! I was hesitant since my husband isn't crazy about dates but after all the positive reviews decided to go for it. It was simple to make, flavorful, and got rave reviews, even from my husband. I cooked the couscous in a combo of vegetable broth and water, left out the cardomom and green onions, and used ras-al-hanout as the spice.

I bought some fregola in the California wine country but didn't know what to do with it. So I adapted this recipe (cooked it in chicken broth instead of the instant version of couscous). It was excellent -- the size of the fregola pearls juxtaposed well against the chopped dates & chick peas. It's so full of flavor I can't imagine anyone not liking it. A keeper.

Rating: 4
I made this recipe with what I had on hand, which was everything but the chickpeas, and it was a great light meal! I went a little on the light side with the cardamom, because I was cracking the seeds instead (I didn't have any ground on hand). This could also be great with some meatballs thrown in right before serving, for the people at the table who can't go with out meat in their main dish.

The only thing that I change in this receipe is to cook the couscous in chicken broth. It is great to take to parties and potlucks.

Rating: 3
This recipe has become my staple for spring and fall potlucks. I have altered the recipe quite a bit, though. I replace the cardamom with a generous amount of cinnamon. I don't toast the almonds and leave out the lemon peel. I also add more generous portions of some of the goodies. I upped the proportion of cilantro to 3/4 of a regular grocery-store-sized bunch and I use about twice as many dates and green onions. I love this recipe and it will stay in my recipe box forever.

Rating: 3
The first time I made this dish, it was well received, but I wasn't too impressed. I decided to try it again but added a diced red pepper for more crunch and color and replaced the cardammon with a tablespoon or so of curry powder. It was much better the second time around.

I didn't like anything about this recipe. I found it boring and dry and my guests only politely moved it around their plate. I did try the Couscous Timbales recipe on here last week which was so good, it made me want to try more couscous recipes. Next time I'll stick with my favorite.

Great and easy recipe. Always a big hit. We pair it with the Grilled Chicken Moroccan Style. I agree though with several of the reviews; double the green onions, almonds, dates, cilantro and add in a little extra lemon peel and cardamom.

A terrific & easy recipe. I made this without the chickpeas & used some lime juice & rind because I didn't have enough lemons. It was a big hit at a dinner for friends. I suggest following the directions on the couscous box rather than those in this recipe, though.

I served this with lamb burgers, and it was a big hit with my teenaged pre-grad party crowd. I added cinammon, salt and pepper to the dressing as well as the cardamom, and doubled the amount of green onion, coriander and dates. I also added minced dried apricots. The salad seemed a bit dry, so I mixed up some more dressing, and then it was perfection!

I made this salad for a office potluck. Most people liked it, and several asked for the recipe. I made it exactly as written, except I made it the night before. Therefore, I added half the dressing and cilantro the night before and the rest about 1 hour before serving at room temperature. I think reserving some of the dressing and herb kept the flavors fresh.

FYI for those worried about the price of cardamon in this recipe, I found it cheap at a Washington DC area Greek grocery. If you're in a large metro area, you may want to look beyond chain supermarkets.

Still one of my favorites. Cardamom is pricey but worth it for unique flavor. Add more dates and almonds and it's perfect

Okay, as far as it goes. Thought the addition of (incredibly expensive) cardamom made little difference to the flavor. Definitely important to add more dates and almonds to give it more textural interest. There are better couscous salad recipes out there.

Made this for my boyfriend along w/the charmoula lamp chops (also on epicurious)--served w/a full-flavored Lebanese red and it was delicious. He said it was his favorite dish yet at my table. Only made a couple changes--flat leaf parsley rather than cilantro, more dates and almonds, half the lemon zest, and made the couscous with half water/half chicken stock. Delicious.

First, Mr. Cairo, no one said it was supposed to be your version of authentic from the start. You can make the same argument about all the different styles of lasagne, pizza, etc. Second, to Monsieur Nice, laissez vos avis de d'autres a la maison. It's innappropriate and you stoop to his level in the process. Il n'est rien personnel, mon ami. Je sais que le cous cous en Provence (pas Paris ou le nord) est beau. Third, this was just a good dish. I made it for a dinner party and it went well, although I left out the cilantro (the most disgusting herb in the universe) and substituted 1/2 the amount with Italian parsley. Otherwise, I thought it was just an average side, nothing spectacular, but would make it again due to the ease.

I really enjoyed this recipe and am planning an end-of-summer outdoor dinner party around it. A very simple recipe to make. I was surprised by the cost of cardamom but I plan to make this recipe again and again, so it won't become one of those lost spices in the back of the pantry. Recommend making it the day before so the flavors mingle. Thanks for this one!

Followed recipe as written, and it was excellent. I'll definitely make this again and again. Even my 3-year old enjoyed it. It's best eaten at room temperature, and it wouldn't be the same without the cardamom. The only thing I regret is having spent $11.00 for a bottle of cardamom at the grocery - should have gone to a bulk spice place.

Having made this three times, I find that making sure the green onions are sliced paper thin is key and the addition of some golden raisins is a plus. I tried the squeeze tube of cilantro that is now available in our grocery and it added a nice greenish cast and tasted like the fresh. I tried making it with whole wheat couscous and it was good but the plain is much better.

Different and good. I cooked my couscous in low-sodium chicken broth instead of water. As did some others, I substituted golden raisins for the dates. My whole almonds were left in their skins, toasted, then coarsely chopped. Because I felt the salad was somewhat dry I added a bit more olive oil and lemon juice. I used grated orange peel rather than lemon, and have lately found this to be a pleasant change. You can use more of the orange peel than the lemon. I keep my cardamom seeds in an empty Spice Islands Black Pepper grinder. This is very, very handy. I made half of the salad recipe and it serves at least 4 people.

I loved this dish and made it two days ahead. Only then you can really appreciate all the flavors that this dish has to offer. For those who may find the salad a little too dry to stand alone, I have the following suggestion. Try topping it with the dip made of fat-free yogurt (3 cups), cilantro, mint, jalapenos with a bit of cumin. That makes it a dish beyond compare. Since the dip was not part of the original recipe, I gave it three forks. Good luck!

In the Middle East, NOBODY uses dates with coucous. And you couldn't substitute cardamom with cinnamon.

This is terrific! Changes: Used more dates (nearly 1 cup), toasted chopped pecans, more green onions (1/2 c., stirred into the couscous while it was still hot but in the large bowl to cool), skipped the Cilantro and garbanzos (husband's not a fan) and added more lemon. I hate when people review a recipe they've changed so much, but this was so good and so simple to tailor to individual tastes I still had to review it! Don't forget to season w/ plenty of salt & white pepper.

When I tasted this right after mixing, I thought it was too perfume-y (the cardamom) and needed more lemon. I didn't adjust, though. I took it to a barbecue 1 hr later, and everyone raved. No one could identify the flavors - it turned into a conversation piece! Several people referred to it as tabbouleh, and I didn't even correct them. I used whole wheat couscous, and a generous amount of dates. I mistakely bought sliced almonds, which I toasted very lightly in a pan and added just before serving.

I will definitely make this dish again. It is so easy and tasty. By mistake, I poured in the WHOLE box of couscous into the boiling water, thereby doubling the recipe, so had to scramble to boil more water and mix it in. Despite that it worked out just fine, once I mashed out the chunks which formed. Very filling so large servings not required. Double this recipe would serve a crowd at a pot luck or picnic for example. I did add a little more lemon juice as someone suggested, but not sure it was really necessary.

This recipe will have you humming the Marrakesh Express. It's a great side dish - easy, fast and delicious. I'm not a great fan of cilantro, but I have to admit, it sure belonged here. Also, don't be afraid of the cardamom. It has a wonderful flavor and blends perfectly with the other elements. The only substitution I made was toasted walnuts for almonds (we have a non-almond eater here). I served it with the grilled chicken, red onion and mint kebabs from this site, which I can also highly recommend.
