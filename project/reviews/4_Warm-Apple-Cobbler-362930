Excellent and fairly simple. Couldn't find miso powder and didn't look for the paste. Found a soup in powder form, sifted the onions...turned out to be a little over a tblspoon. Probably would have been fine with or without the miso. Loved this!!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. I've made it for Christmas Eve dessert, book club and many other occasions, and each time the dish was scraped clean. I couldn't recommend it more.

This was very tasty. I made half the recipe, but followed all instructions. Not too sweet, a very crunchy topping and overall delicious. Will keep making it.

I halved the recipe and it turned out great. Not a big cobbler or crisp fan but this was very good, not too sweet (thank you Granny Smith), and looked very nice, too.

I was doubling this recipe for a large party and wasn't sure if the miso was the right one so I skipped it.. it was a big hit... comfort food... would make again for sure

This was an excellent recipe, especially for someone who has made apple crumble a million different ways. The miso and ginger added an nice balance to the apples. The house, of course, smelled amazing. I wish I'd used more apples because there was a lot of crumble on top. I used 4 granny smiths and 3 macintoshes. If you like a nice thick crust, this is your recipe.

Easy to make and modify this recipe. I didn't have miso on hand so I put fresh ginger through a garlic press and used that instead.

This was ok. The miso crust was something a little bit different, but overall, wasn't blown away. Will go back to some of my other go-to cobbler recipes.

A neighbor severely trimmed an apple tree full of apples! We walked away with a bushel and 3 large bags - could be 100 pounds of apples! Well, this was a delicious and easy recipe for my first apple recipe! I always hate fussy toppings and rolling out crust if I don't have to. This fit the bill perfectly! I didn't have the Miso, however but it was just delicious anyway! Made this as a test for what to make in bulk for a large gathering next weekend. My husband's verdict? This is too good for them! It might be too good for them, but it was easy for me!

Really scrumptious, and a new twist on the apple cobbler - my toppings used to either be kind of bland dough or an oaty crumble. This topping turns out quite carmelized, almost shiny, and delicious. If you like things less sweet you could probably cut the sugar in the topping a bit. I used brown miso - don't think the type matters too much. My sixteen year old bit into it and her eyes widened in amazement - she loved it :) and she has had many a cobbler. I cut the recipe in half because it's just the two of us - worked fine in an 8x8 pyrex dish.

Incredibly delicious! As promised, the miso adds a certain level of depth to the streusel topping which sets this cobbler apart from other ordinary versions. I made this exactly as directed without any substitutions, and I suggest only watching the dish when baking. The topping on my cobbler was sufficiently browned by 45-48 minutes.

The entire family loved this recipe. It wasnt overly sweet, but still a substantial dessert nonetheless. My apples were a little smaller than described within the recipe, but I just followed cup predictions and it came out great. Not 100% sure I used the right miso, but the taste was outstanding.

Definitely a tasty dessert. I would say that the most tedious part was making the Miso streusel topping. It may be the fact that I am a beginner, but, I was unsure about which type of Miso was the best. I ended up using a bottled, white, paste type. Powder may be better, as the topping ended up not being very flaky. Taste was excellent! I made several hours ahead of a dinner party, and covered it. Was still warm and perfect temperature-- ready to serve. Will definitely make this again!
