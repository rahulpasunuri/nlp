Loved this recipe, simple and tasty. Since we do not consume many sweets, the cake was available for 2 weeks. It did not dry out and the flavor improved with time. (I wrapped it in foil) I only give a 4 for rating for truly exceptional recipes. This one is great

Excellent coffee or tea bread. I used a mixture of half cranberry and half blueberries (as I ran out of cranberries), Sometimes accidents turn into blessings. I think it turned out awesome. I would make this with any combination of berry imaginable. I'd even be tempted to use any combination of fruit as well. Some reviewers mentioned they had to bake longer, while mine actually took 11 minutes shorter, but I also used a long style bread pan. The most difficult part of this recipe was the slightly lengthy process of layering the fruit with the batter, but end results are a beautifully colorful and delicious tasting loaf. This recipe will not disappoint, Enjoy! I plan to make it again and again.

I've made this several times and like it best with the amount of filling called for -- more makes it hard to layer properly - but 1/4 cup less sugar in the batter. I've used frozen cranberries; using the post-draining juice as a glaze has just made the coffeecake sticky. Lots of other recipes involve nuts, oranges, etc. -- it's nice to have one that doesn't!

A good recipe - not brilliant, but good. I felt the cranberry jam needed a bit more sugar but appreciate this is a matter of personal preference.

Rating: 4
I made this exactly as written except I forgot to add vanilla. Used frozen cranberries and had no use for the sieve. The cranberry jam was fantastic! Also the cake had a buttery flavor I was not expecting. It was like eating shortbread cookies with jam! Good for breakfast, afternoon tea or dessert!

I would definately make it again. I baked it in a bundt pan,used 3 cups of cranberries,added orange zest,2/3 cup walnuts,1/2 tsp baking soda, and 1/4 c sour cream. I made a glaze for the top with pineapple juice and powdered sugar and it looked beautiful. Everyone loved it, I would make it the day before and let it set wrapped overnight. I think the flavor was better after setting.

I improvised on: 1) not having a 9x5x3 pan, used a cake pan instead. Had a bit too much batter, but it didn't overflow while cooking. 2) reading reviews, saw some suggested the cranberry needed to be more finely chopped. Kept chopping until very fine, then used a coffee filter to drain the liquid (sieve not fine enough). 3) Only had skim milk, so used 1/3 c milk, added water to have full 1/2 c liquid, and added 2 Tbs butter for fat content. So, with the cake pan, cooked @ 1 hr, turned out fabulous and I'll definitely make again. My mom is visiting and she really enjoyed it.

This was absolutely delicious. I had to use frozen blueberries, since I couldn't find cranberries and it turned out great. I made this for my co- workers and it got rave reviews.

I didn't think this was anything special. The chopped fresh cranberries are somewhat crunchy, less jammy than I would like. I used a bundt pan, which I don't recommend, as it was difficult to spread the batter over the filling smoothly. In this pan the cooking time was 1 hr. at 350. I liked it better the day I made it. We will certainly eat the whole cake, but IMO its not that great.

This is one of the best coffee cakes I have had. The cranberry filling is great. The second time I made this I used two and a half cups of fresh cranberries as I thought it needed a bit more filling and it came out perfect. This freezes well and can be made ahead of time for the holidays. I will make this again.

I made this for an office lunch and everyone loved it. A few other reviews stated that this is really more of a pound cake, rather than a coffeecake, and I agree. It took me a little longer to make than the recipe said but that is always the case when you make something for the first time. The only snafu I ran into was the cake overflowing the loaf pan as it baked. I don't know if that's a common problem, but my loaf pan may have been a 2- 1/2 inch rather than a 3 inch. I simply trimmed off the slightly overdone edges and the overflow before I turned it out onto my plate. Served it with fresh whipped cream with just a hint of orange in it and it was fantastic. I'm making another one this evening for Thanksgiving dessert!

For this recipe, I cut the cooking time down 45 mins. If followed exactly, this is an awesome recipe that I would make again.

This is a smashing little cake. I highly recommend adding the orange zest. I also added walnuts & I found the final combination of flavors thrilling (and addictive). The juice that was left after the cranberries drained (perhaps more for me before my cranberrries were also thawing during this process) made an incredible sauce I drizzled atop. I baked the cake in a springform pan, per personal taste in shapes, & having seen a previous user did the same with success... I'm not sure it was as baked in the middle as I would have prefferred, likely because I also had to cut the baking time. I willl try using the same pan next time & lower the oven temperature. I think I may then attain perfection.

This recipe was excellent! My husband gave me a suggestion that I tried and it worked wonderfully.In place of the 1/2 cup of whole milk I substituted 1/4 cup 2% milk and 1/4 sour cream. My family stated that this recipe was a keeper!

Love this recipe and always make it around the holidays when I can find fresh cranberries. A bit more labor-intensive than other cake/bread recipes, but well worth the effort. Always get rave reviews with this cake! Note: I always lower my oven temperature 25-50 degrees so the cake cooks evenly and doesn't get too dark on the edges.

Rating: 4
Yum! Made exactly according to the recipe and it was great. I think thick preserves would work just as well - will try next time with blueberry.

This is a tasty coffeecake, but be sure to pay attention to the directions. It is important that your pan be well-buttered and that you leave a half inch around the edges when you layer the cranberries onto the batter. If you don't do these things your coffeecake may separate into layers when you try to take it out of the pan. My pan was "well-buttered" on the sides and the corners but I really needed it more on the bottom of the loaf pan. The reviews may have mentioned this already but I didn't read all 104 reviews. For those cooks trying to cut cholesterol, let me assure you that this recipe tastes fine with margarine and egg substitute. Another recipe on this site, the Apple Bundt Cake, is also tasty and made with oil.

Rating: 3
Terrific, dense, flavorful cake (more like a pound cake). I cut back on the sugar because it was a bit sweet for me. Also trimmed off the bottom and side crusts which, for some reason, browned too much. Excellent served with afternoon tea!

Rating: 3
I really liked this and so did everyone I made it for. I didn't make it as written though, due to my inability to locate fresh (or even frozen) cranberries in February. Word to the wise--buy extra around the holidays and freeze if you think you're going to make this another time of year. So, I bought a couple cans of whole cranberry sauce, heated it and strained it in order to get 8 oz. of fruit. Then I mashed them and didn't add additional sugar to the fruit. The results in the cake were a little jelly-donutesque, but still delicious. I'll look forward to trying this as next time I can get my hands on fresh cranberries!

I would make this again. I added 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the cranberry/sugar mixture. It needed the full 1-1/4 hours baking time. Sliced nicely after cooling.

The taste of this cake was fantastic. I added the zest of one navel orange, about 1/2 cp chp walnuits and some finely chp crystalized ginger. I am an accomplished baker, but I do have failures at times. This cake did not rise nicely and I had a trough as it cooled. Not pretty enough to serve to company. Also, when I removed from the pan after the specified 30 minutes, part of the lower layer stuck to the pan. I will give it another try, perhaps there were gremlins in my oven and next time I will wait until completely cool to remove from pan. Then I will rate it and decide whether or not to make again. Stay tuned for next chapter

I made this for my co-workers during the holidays. Instead of preparing the cranberries in accordance to the receipe, I used homemade cranberry sauce that I drained in a sieve. I then baked in small bundt pans. The presentation was terrific!

Great coffee cake. I used a cup of sugar in the cranberries but still had a great, if more subtle, tartness. Next time I'll add some nutmeg and allspice, and try some brown sugar with the white.

This was memorable. I couldn't find my loaf pan (don't ask), so I turned it into muffins. They were so good, and we served them with freshly whipped cream at a brunch. They will be at least an annual thing from now on.

This is a lovely and crowd-pleasing breakfast cake. I usually add chopped nuts to the cranberry mixture and bake in a bundt pan for a more elegant presentation. Can be made the day before but wrap it well in cello-wrap. When you add the cranberry mixture make sure it doesn't go over to the edge of the pan -- if you do, the cake will fall apart at the layers.

This was an easy and tasty cake to have available for Christmas morning. I added chopped walnuts to the cranberry and sugar mixture. The cake needs to be kept wrapped in plastic wrap, or else it goes stale quickly.

To A Cook from Yokosuka JA, I live in Tokyo and found fresh cranberries in Dec. 03 and frozen ones in Dec. 04 at Costco in or near Tama Center, west Tokyo. I think there's a Costco in Chiba too. I believe you can look the location up on the Internet.

This recipe was the first one I tried from the new Gourmet Cookbook which my dear husband gave me for Christmas...(dear of him because I have at least a hundred cookbooks which I read like novels)! It was so easy to make and absolutely delicious, and all ingredients are likely to be in your cupboard and refrig around holiday time anyway. It made a great addition to a "company" breakfast buffet the day aByfter Christmas. Everyone loved it. By the way, the cookbook has proven to be the most useful one I have ever had. A LOT of the recipes turned out to be ones I have saved ripped out of the magazine. After the first 3 recipes I made from the book my husband said 'it is already worth every cent'.

I made this for brunch and 4 people nearly finished the whole thing! I didn't make the bottom layer of batter thick enough, plus my berries were still frozen so they didn't really drain, which made the loaf difficult to slice. No problem though - I just turned it upside down. I added orange peel as others suggested and used half whole-wheat flour. Yum!

Instead of plain cranberries and sugar, I used left-over cranberry sauce I had made for a turkey dinner. The cranberry sauce had pureed oranges, pears, apples, triple sec etc. I drained the sauce and layered it between the cake mixture and it turned out beautifully. It looked beautiful and tasted delicious and moist. Made it for a brunch and everyone raved about it.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe to make! The cake is very luscious, without being either too sweet or too dense. It's also very presentable, especially during the holiday season. Every time I've baked it, I've gotten rave reviews. It's a great cake to bring to parties for those cooks who, like me, aren't very talented.

I thought this cake looked much better than it tasted. Based on the reviews, I made it in an 8x8" pan. I actually think it would have been better in a loaf pan; in the square pan the cake layer was thin between the cranberry layers. A lot of people thought this cake was too sweet; I thought it wasn't sweet enough. The top was too brown, and the cake was too dense. I'm sure it could be tweaked and improved, but I don't think it's good enough to bother.

I couldn't find cranberries; before you yell at me, let me explain that I'm on a military base in Japan and I couldn't find them on- or off-base. So it's not that I live in a little podunk town. So. I couldn't find cranberries, though I hadn't really thought through what I'd do next (I had ASSUMED I could find cranberries). I put in a mix of blackberries and raspberries and while the cake tastes lovely, the fruit (I had to use frozen) is sort of lackluster and the raspberry seeds are incredibly tough! Is that from baking them or what? I fear for my friends' teeth when I serve it tomorrow. I'd love to try it with cranberries and will do so the week before Thanksgiving when all that seasonal stuff arrives, finally.

Rating: 3
Tasty and very pretty when sliced. I used a dark metal loaf pan (one of those fancy-shaped things), and failed to adjust the baking time accordingly, so my loaf was a bit browner than I'd like. Next time I'll reduce the cooking time slightly. This would look nice on a Mother's Day brunch buffet.

Very nice indeed. Orange zest is a must. Also tried it with blueberries and lemon zest, which turned out surprisingly well. The blueberries are heavier so they sink a bit, but the result was a butterfly-like pattern. Cool!

This turned out pretty well except that mine crumbled a bit when removing it from pan and had to be very gentle upon slicing. Maybe would have been better to chill overnight and then cut. The cake looked very pretty though and tasted alot like a pound cake to me. Good balance of sweet and tart.

I really liked this cake. I baked it in a 12X4" Danish loaf pan (from King Arthur Flour) that I had been wanting to try. Spreading the cranberries in two layers made for a beautiful presentation. I was interested to read about folks who added brandy and/or orange zest. I imagine both would be good. I'll definitely make this again: the beautiful red color and zesty cranberries were a real hit.

I made this more as a loaf bread then a cake. It came out very yummy. I really loved the tartness of the fresh cranberries. I didn't strain them and found that it probably would've been better to stir it all together instead of layering it. But I'll definitely be keeping it in my Christmas breads!

This came out absolutely horribly. I used a 8 and a half by 4 and a half inch pan. When I tried to unmold it, the whole thing fell apart. The cake itself was good, but the cranberries were way too tart. I ended up throwing the whole thing out. I would never make this again.

I made the recipe exactly as printed - and thought it was perfect. It's got a great blend of tart and sweet that isn't cloying or unwelcome. It's a bit more time consuming than I thought it would be and the bread took a full 1 hour and a half in my oven (which Thank you God holds a temperature beautifully) Next time, I plan to double the batch, which will be the same amount of work for twice the yumminess.

This is a wonderfully versatile recipe. I've made it with cranberries and also with frozen blueberries and raspberries. I didn't puree them, I just layered them right in. Also, I'd reduce the sugar to 1 and 1/3 cup unless you want a very sweet cake.

This bread was fantastic, perhaps I watch too much 'Food Network', but I made this for a party last night, and served it with brandied cranberries, and a dollop of LIGHTLY sweetened whipped cream - I also took another's advice, and added a tsp of orange zest and a tsp of fresh orange juice... it was fabulous!

I made this the night before to serve for dessert after lunch on Mother's Day (which is today in Canada). I was a little nervous about it because the batter when it was all done seemed really floury, but it turned out great. The only changes I made were to use blueberries instead of cranberries (bc there was a bucket of them frozen in our freezer that badly needed to be used up). I used one cup of blueberries instead of the 2 cups called for the cranberries. I took some good advice from the comments and did not unthaw them or chop them or add any sugar to them. I used less sugar than what was called for in the recipe- I subtracted the sugar required for the cranberry mixture- though it could have been alright with a BIT more sugar. I didn't layer the blueberries, but mixed them into the batter (as I put it into the loaf pan) and did not have any trouble with it crumbling or falling apart when I sliced it. I used a slightly smaller loaf pan and actually, it seemed a little big for the recipe (maybe some of the batter spattered out of the bowl durring 5 mins of creaming the butter/sugar mixture?) To serve it, I inverted it onto a plate (the top was bumby so I cut it off so it would sit level on the serving plate). Oh, yes, and I topped it with sifted icing sugar mixed with some cinamon- which gave it some nice flavour. It went over well with my Grandparents and the rest of my family who told me it was really good. :) The only thing I might change next time is add a bit more sugar to the batter and some cinamon.

I finally made this (despite the difficulty of finding cranberries in Wisconsin--yes I know it seems unbelivable, but it's true!). I made as written, except for using buttermilk. I will make again, but with some changes. The cranberry mixture is really too sweet, so I'll cut the sugar, and I like the idea of some orange rind in there. I'll also use the idea of brandy or Grand Marnier in the buttermilk, as the cake is a little bland. Overall, it could be a good, easy brunch dish (By the way, I bought a new 9x5 loaf pan for this--they were $2.98 at the grocery!) that could be made better.

Rating: 3
This was yummy, if perhaps a little too sweet for breakfast. I used a bundt pan and, although I struggled to spread each layer of batter over the filling and was convinced I would have a mess once it baked, it came out beautifully after just 45 mins in the oven. I added about a teaspoon of orange zest to the cranberries; next time, maybe almond extract in the batter and a few sliced almonds on top? BTW, does anyone else suspect that the angry comments on here are staged just to get a response? I have a hard time believing anyone who cooks can be that strung out and vicious!

This was a good recipe and one I would make again , with a few changes. I would use a little less sugar and next time I will make in the square pan, not the loaf pan. I would also just mix the cranberry mixture right into the batter and not layer it. When cranberries are plentiful at Thanksgiving I always buy extra bags and freeze them.

I had 3 problems with this recipe. First, with no food processor or chopper, it took forever to hand-chop the berries, and they were coarser than would have been ideal. (Actually, locating cranberries was another problem--a four-store search!) Next, I had just an 8x4 loaf pan, which increased the baking time and left a very dark, hard crust. Finally, the coarse cranberries left a wide swath through the bread, and the slices broke apart at the berries when you picked it up to eat it. Problems are correctable, though, and people commented on how delicious it was!

Rating: 3
This bread/coffeecake took on a pound cake like texture because of creaming the butter and sugar for five minutes. It is important if using a loaf pan to take the recipe's advice and take care in not spreading the cranberries to the edge. Doing so makes the slices fall apart when serving. Next time I will try this recipe in a square baking dish. I think that that size is more suitable to the texture and presentation of the dish. Otherwise, would not change anything else.

This is a definite hit. I used frozen cranberrries, sprinkled a little Orange and Brandy liquor over them and a light dusting of flour and they didn't sink to the bottom.

To a cook 02/14/03; sour cream addition sounds delicious. Frozen blueberries are a great substitute, but do not thaw them. Toss them in a little flour before adding them to the batter to prevent them from sinking to the bottom. Thawing them makes them "bleed" and turn the batter blue!

I used frozen blueberries (since they're out of season) instead of cranberries, reduced sugar to 1-1/2 cups, and added 1/3 cup sour cream. The result was excellent. I took it to the office (my husband loved it and insisted that I leave some at home for him, and I did). The cake was outstanding. As an aside, most of the blueberries sank toward the bottom. However, this didn't compromise the taste whatsoever -- everyone loved it. Perhaps the weight of the frozen blueberries (I was in a hurry) caused them to sink. Next time I'll defrost first or use fresh blueberries.

I too made this with frozen blueberries, drained them first and didn't pulse them with sugar, as they are sweeter than cranberries. It was very popular in our house. Next time I'm making it with cranberries. Swiss cook - look for a MOCHA recipe for cake with coffee flavor.

I had the same problem the other cook from California had -- mine came out very dense and heavy. Its ok, but not great. Thanks for the tip on the baking powder -- guess I'll treat myself to a fresh new can and try it again!

This is a great recipe, very easy to add your own thing and call it your great-grandmothers. To the Calf. pound cake disaster- always make sure you use fresh baking powder, if the tin looks a bit rusty, chances are you've had it around to long.

Used a bundt pan just for variety. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Never had a better coffeecake than this. It disappeared in a flash. I agree that many variations are possible, and I plan to try some. To the cook who asked about blueberries: Use less sugar, and skip the food processor step. Just mix. Let us know how it works.

I looked at the recipe because I needed a cake with a COFFEE flavour....I assume this is a cake to eat whilst you DRINK the coffee??!! I'll try it and let you know how it turns out!

This turned out great! I made several substitutions to reduce fat and calories. I used buttermilk instead of whole milk, egg whites only(non yoke), a tablespoon less of butter and added about an extra tablespoon of buttermilk. I also reduced the amt of sugar by 1/4 cup. It tasted great and was very moist and still sweet.

EASY and DELICIOUS! I've made it twice already (because it went in a flash.) First time followed directions exactly. Yummy! Second time, used ORANGE extract instead of the vanilla. Also, added 2 Tbsp BRANDY to the milk to make it 1/2 cup. YUMMIER! Do be sure to cook long enough, but be careful to not overbrown. California Cook on 1/31/03, please give it another chance!

My husband and I loved this cake. It was moist and delicious. I have to admit that I altered the recipe though (sheepish grin). I had homemade cranberry sauce in the freezer that I wanted to use and substituted that for the pulsed berries in the recipe. I use brandy and orange zest in my cranberry sauce so I do not know if that enhanced the flavor, but we have be savoring the cake since the weekend!

Wonderful cake with a nice crust. I think you have to test it carefully and be sure to cook it long enough. Everyone loved it.

I have no idea what happened to my Cranberry Cake! It came out like pound cake all right! It must have weighed 3lbs without the loaf pan! Mine didn't really have very much flavor, and didn't turn out at all like the picture.

This was an excellent use for frozen cranberries. I added a bit of cranbery "catsup" which spiced it up a bit. The coffeecake has a pound-cake-like consistency, which makes it a nice dessert as well as breakfast item. Very good.

I substituted raspberries for cranberries and everyone at work loves it!
