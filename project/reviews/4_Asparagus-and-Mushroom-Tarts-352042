I know this sounds crazy, but I had all the ingredients except for the pastry so I just cooked all the veggies and they were awesome. Can't wait to try it with pastry.

We used a combination of shiitake and baby bellas which was lovely. Since we had leftovers, we were very happy to find they reheat perfectly at 400 degrees for 5 minutes with the crust once again beautifully crisp on the edges.

I made this with oregano instead of thyme, baby bella instead of shiitake, and a mix of Appenzeller and Grana Padano cheeses instead of Gruyere. I also suspect I used rather less of the creme fraiche since I didn't measure anything. I also didn't wait 15 min before stirring everything into the freshly sautéed mushrooms, nor did I do any rotation of the baking sheets in the oven. Despite all the departures from the recipe, this came out SO good that the entire batch was gone in about 20 min. I was looking for a tasty departure from my asparagus-season salads and this definitely was it. The asparagus remained perfectly crisp, and the mushrooms were rich and tasty. Definitely making again.

Made these for two different Easter celebrations. I was quite surprised by the positive comments. Everyone loved them. I made the recipe as stated although I did not measure the cheese exactly so may have included a bit more. Everything blended so well. I made these in small muffin pans and got 32 appetizer-size tarts. Cooked for 22 minutes. I also chopped the mushrooms and asparagus to a small dice. The end result was easy to eat and looked so professional.

These tasted good, were easy to make,and best of all looked fancy! I cut the puff pastry into smaller squares and made these using a mini-muffin tin. It was a perfect appetizer for a baby shower. When I make this again I'll probably use baby bellas or crimini mushrooms rather than shitakes. The asparagus and puff pastry flavors dominated so you weren't really able to taste the delicate shitake flavor.

This was exceptional as written, and has gotten rave reviews every time I've made it! I've substituted parmesan for gruyere, and cut the pastry smaller for an appetizer size as well. If you make smaller sizes you'll have leftover mushroom-asparagus filling -- this is EXCELLENT stirred into good ol' macaroni and cheese (add a little extra liquid and let steam for a few minutes to cook the asparagus).

great use for puff pastry which I've cut 2/2" for an appetizer, & 3/4" as a side dish. The border really rises up well. worried about the raw asparagus but it was cooked perfectly. A bit too strong on lemon zest, added garlic to sauteed mushrooms. Also subbed mayo for creme fraiche (don't knock it til you try it!)...This dish looks elegant and tastes wonderful.

Made these as an appetizer for a family gathering today and everyone really loved them. I cut each sheet into nine squares for a total of 18 appetizers. I mixed everything together, but pulled out the asparagus to lay diagonally in one direction across each pastry square, and then spooned the rest of the cheese/mushroom mix on top. I noticed the scoring on the pieces where I had scored deeper -- it really didn't seem to matter much; I probably wouldn't even bother with that step next time... it didn't seem to really envelop the asparagus as in the picture, but it got up high enough around it to keep the filling in -- I imagine this is because the pieces were smaller than those in the recipe. These tasted so much better straight out of the oven than they did after they had cooled for an hour or so.

I made these as a starter, and my boyfriend LOVED them - he ate three in one go! (Much to my chagrin, not saving much room for the next two courses, but I'm not complaining!) The only thing I'd do is cut down on the lemon zest - it gets a bit overwhelming, and use slightly more gruyere and less creme fraiche. The nuttiness of the mushrooms is really enhanced by the cheese, but it didn't come through enough with all that creme fraiche. Other than that, perfection!!

These were absolutely outstanding! I used Baby Bella instead of Shiitake mushroom because our local store did not have enough for the recipe. The Baby Bellas tasted great with the other ingredients, and I probably saved a few bucks! I will definitely make these again!

Super delicious with a wonderful combination of interesting flavors. Like others I made them smaller for appetizer size. I couldn't find creme fraiche and so had to make my own but didn't realize until it was too late that doing so takes 8-14 hours. Consequently, while I meant to serve these on Christmas Eve, they became a Christmas dinner appetizer instead ... but they were totally worthy.

Hands down my favorite hors d'oeuvre. I have made this at least 10 x's for parties. Delicous yet more sophisticated in taste than most. Pretty easy to make, great time saver since the filling can be made ahead of time. These are always the 1st to be devoured at parties - I've learned to secretly save a few for myself!

Love this recipe. Followed directions and it turned out delicious. I also cut the puff pastry into triangles. A lot easier to eat.

Perfect appetizer when made into bite size servings. I followed a suggestion to cut puff pastry and tuck into mini muffin tin, only I cut pastry into 3" rounds and made little cups. I also only used mushrooms by subtituting the weight of the asparagus with more mushrooms. I made the mushroom saute and tucked the pastry into the mini muffin tin the night before, I put mushroom mixture in cups right before baking and it turned out great. Everyone LOVED this appetizer! I would say though that you lose some of the creaminess of the creme fraiche when it is refrigerated over night and is used the next day. So instead, if I make ahead, I would saute the mushrooms and stir in the creme fraiche right before spooning into the cups for baking. Will make these again and again. Oh, and I used all crimini and it was delicious.

This was so easy and the flavors were phenomenal from shiitake mushrooms, asparagus, fresh thyme, lemon zest, creme fraiche, gruyere cheese, and store bought puff pastry. I made a small batch using one pastry sheet and reserved the other one for later use. I peeled the asparagus and added more shiitake mushrooms as recommended. I was able to make four rectangles and paired it with Pinot Noir. I loved it so much that I decided to make it again but this time I decided to add salmon by placing it on top of shiitake/asparagus mixture. Seasoning the salmon with salt, pepper, and fresh chopped thyme and cooked it for 25 minutes depending on how you want your salmon. It became our main course and served it with salad and Pinot Noir. I will definitely make it again for the family.

These are fantastic. Like other reviewers, I made them bite-sized which meant dicing the mushrooms and asparagus before sauteeing. I cut the dough in 2" squares and fit them into mini-cupcake tins so the corners stuck out, then filled them. They baked perfectly and the filling stayed in the pastry cups nicely. So cute, if that matters. They were devoured!

These were gorgeous and delicious, so easy to make. I'm going to try smaller versions as canapes next time, although this size was a perfect first course for Easter dinner.

I made these as hors-d'Suvres by cutting each square into quarters then diagonally into 4 triangles for 32 appetizer servings. I cut the pastry margins to only 1/4", they did not puff as much as they would with a 1/2 " margin, but they needed the extra room for sufficient filling.I made the filling as written except I cut the asparagus into smaller pieces and combined shitake and button mushrooms to keep the cost down. I used a rounded tablespoon of filling for each triangle. As they came out of the oven, I added an extra pinch of finely grated Gruyère which helped hold it all together. A full tray took about 18 minutes to cook. These were a big hit and I was asked to make them again for our next gathering.

I made these for a group cooking night and everyone loved them. I did make them appetizer size as well but cutting the 5" squares into 4 trianges, scoring them individually and baking each with the filling. I made the filling earlier in the morning and pastry triangles a few hours ahead, both rested it he refrigerator. Assembled just before putting in the oven. Delicious, easy and will be a "go to" recipe for appetizers from now on.

I made this entire menu for Easter this year. The Asparagus and Mushroom Tarts were everyone's favorite recipe! They are delicious. The only change I made was to cut them into triangles, to make them more of an appetizer serving. I would definately make these again.

I prepped the pastry and filling today and made a test one before Easter dinner. The flavors are well balanced and the recipe's proportions are right on, except the thyme is a little bit strong - I would add less in the future. Otherwise, this is excellent (and easy.)

Served this as a 2nd course to a 5 course tasting dinner party, exceptional! Everyone raved about this course and it paired exceptionally well with a pinot noir. We will be using this dish as an appetizer for the holidays. I wouldn't change a thing...made exactly as written.

Somehow I burnt the bottoms of these and they were completely ruined. But I can see how the flavours would have been perfect together. Maybe I'll have better success next time...

Have made these many times. Super quick & easy. A very lush appetizer when made this way, but if your looking to trim the cost down you can opt out of the creme fraiche and get criminis instead of shiitakes. That's what I do on any old weeknight, the dish doesn't really suffer for it. But for a meal that I'm pulling out all the stops, I'd spring for the extras here.

Made 16 triangles instead of 8 squares to take to a friend's dinner party - still a little large for hors d'oeuvres if other things are being served, but SO delicious and the size didn't deter people from seconds. Used 1/3 of salt as recommended by others. Otherwise, made exactly as written and it was perfect! The lemon zest and thyme really punch up the flavor. My husband put these together, and he said that if you're halving the portions you should slice the asparagus slightly shorter so it will fit onto the tarts without hanging off the edges. I almost never make the same recipe twice, but this is now my go-to appetizer for any function. It's easy, portable, impressive, and delicious, even sitting at room temperature for a few hours.

My boyfriend was very impressed with this. It was very tasty.

Since I am fairly health conscious - I halved the amount of butter, used light sour cream in place of creme fraiche, and used shredded 2% vermont white cheddar instead of gruyere. They were a huge hit. Also, when I sauteed the mushrooms I added one small diced vidalia onion which went very nicely. Everyone was asking me for the recipe. Good stuff.

These are wonderful!! Made as an appetizer for a party and everyone wanted the recipe. Cut each into fourths on the diagonal, very nice presentation. Only change I made was I used half the amt of mushrooms, and they were perfect!

Love it....BUT I would have made 16 (halve the 8, as called for) little appetizers and have twice as much to go around. and since it's rich, it would have been perfect!!!!

One of the few recipes my bf requests repeatedly. I've made this several times various ways, though the first time I followed the recipe exactly. In a pinch I used parmesan, to a delicious effect. And another time I added a bit of crumbled sausage and a fried egg on top for a breakfast tart.

To the cook in NJ - you must have done something wrong. As written, the recipe is wonderful. In fact, we are making them again tonight. The ingredients are expensive, no doubt, but for a special occasion this is perfect. We made the recipe exactly as written (except I know we didn't use the amnt of salt it called for - husband is a salt-o-phobic) and they're divine. My kids loved them, too.

YUM!! I agree about adding less salt, but I just eyeballed it, and thankfully it wasn't too much. I cheated and used pillsbury cresent rolls and made little popovers. I also used goat cheese because our market was out of creme fraice. Quick and easy! The lemon zest is key. It added a little zing and made it a really fresh, spring tasting appetizer. Will definitely make again! Might even finely chop ingredients and make bite size pieces for a party!

Grrrrroooooossssss!!! is what I have to say! I spent a lot of money on the ingredients {$9.00 for gruyere cheese, and $5.99 per lb. for Shiitake mushrooms-I needed 12 oz.} Not to mention the cost of the rest of the ingredients. I expected this to be delicious. All the ingredients on thier own sound great, but in combination it was not good at all. The puff pastry was like dry paper with no flavor that crumbled and It just fell apart no matter how careful I was and it tasted exactly like it looked... like dry paper!! And the pastry took on a slightly burnt flavor even though I cooked it the required amount of time but it didn't look burnt. The topping tasted very blah even though the ingredients themselves should have been fabulous. My husband said it was very nasty too and he recommended that I never make this dish again. He said he would have rather been eating my home made pizza than this so called 'tart'.All in all this was wasted time and money and a big disappointment. I don't know why some other reviewers liked it!!?? I followed the recipe to a 'T', I wonder what could have gone wrong?

This is a great recipe. I served it as a first course. Cut on the diagnal and placed over small shredded greens. A lovely presentation worthy of the tart. Unlike others who don't like substitutios, I find it interesting to hear how people tinker with a recipe although that should be saved for the 2nd time you make it. Please rate on recipes as written then go play Ann-NYC

I made these as appetizers for our Easter lunch. Because I made them as appetizers I cut the puff pastry into two inch squares. I kept everything else exactly as written in the recipe. Made the filling the night before so it was very easy to put them all together in the morning. I put parchment paper over my baking sheets which made clean up much easier, with the tarts being so small the cheese melted a lot and bubbled over the edges of the puff pastry. They still looked great and tasted delicious.

I too like reviews to be of the actually recipe. However, this year since I was doubling the recipe, I could not afford to use all shiitake mushrooms. I used 1 part shiitake, 1 part baby portabella and two parts white button mushrooms. The dish still got rave reviews from our guests. The shiitakes defiantly had the most delectable flavor, but I think the other mushrooms improved the presentation.

Fantastic! I agree with the other person who asked why people make a recipe for the first time with substitutions and then rate the recipe. "I didn't have creme fraiche, so I put yogurt on the side." That is crazy! I made creme fraiche ahead of time, used spices per the instructions. My wife and I are mushroom lovers, so I used slightly more mushrooms and slightly less asparagus (forgive me, please!). Gruyere cheese and creme fraiche blended beautifully with the grated lemon peel. We served the tarts as appetizers for our gourmet dinner group. It was the only part of our pre-Easter dinner that had absolutely zero leftovers. Huge hit. Changes I would suggest: The tarts are large, so we cut them diagonally to make easy-to-eat pieces. No other changes! This is too delicious...

Instead of large tarts, I cut each sheet of the pastry into 16 pieces. Perfect appetizer size. I would definitely use less salt. Everyone gave a 'thumbs up' and the tarts were totally consumed. I made the filling the day before which was a time saver. I cooked these at home, allowed them to cool and took them to another home. There I just popped them in the oven for a few minutes - they did not get soggy at all.

This is absolutely the last time I read recipe reviews. Why? There are 5 reviews for this recipe and only 1 actually made the recipe per instructions: Substitutions: Sour Cream instead of Crème Fraiche Yogurt instead of Crème Fraiche Dried instead of fresh shiitake Broccoli instead of asparagus Tarragon instead of thyme Blue cheese for ½ the gruyere Changes: Add Truffle oil Add chicken Add deli ham & cheese Add sweet Italian sausage PLEASE if you change the recipe DO NOT REVIEW with forks. How am I supposed to know if the recipe is good if nobody actually made it??

This is a great recipe. I use sour cream instead of creme fraiche. The second time I made it, I added a drizzle of truffle oil and added some diced leftover roast chicken.

This was pretty good...I would put a higher proportion of shitakes to the asparagus. I didn't have any creme fraiche, so I served them with plain yogurt on the side. I put deli ham & cheese on a couple of them for my non- vegetable-loving son. Also, I substituted dried shitakes (re-constituted) for the fresh.

I made these tarts last night for dinner and they were FANTASTIC. I'd suggest being careful about the amount of salt added (next time I'd put it a little less). These tarts are also very filling - my boyfriend and I each had one and a half as our main course and some steamed veggies on the side and it was more than enough. They are a bit large to use as just a starter, but I will definitely make these again for dinner!

I made a couple of changes but the mushroom base was the same. I used very small broccoli florets instead of asparagus and I added some crumbled sweet italian sausage. Very good idea with lots of versatility.

This is easy and delicious! I've made mini versions for hors d'oeuvres, and also substituted tarragon for the thyme and used half bleu cheese and half gruyere (bleu cheese and tarragon are surprisingly complimentary to asparagus).
