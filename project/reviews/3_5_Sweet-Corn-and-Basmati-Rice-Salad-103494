One of the best salad recipes I have ever made...it always gets rave reviews. I would follow recipe closely however be prepared to add additional vinaigrette...the rice really soaks it up. I also grind the peacans before using...this seems to spread the flavor better.

everyone loved this salad. Two comments: I'd use less rice. Most people are wary of empty carbs these days so I made it more about watercress and corn than rice. Also, make sure to add dressing a bit at a time so as not to overdress. I only used about half of the dressing. This salad is great as a leftover too. we ate it for 2 days afterward, adding fresh greens to perk it up. Question: does anyone know how to shave corn from the cob without kernels flying across the counter?

Good salad! I thought the mustard was a bit overpowering in the dressing...would cut that back next time. Did add dried cranberries. Added garlic to the corn sautee.

I have made this recipe so many times, exactly as is. Everyone loves it from little kids on up. It is just as good the next day.

I substituted brown basmati and rocket for watercress as some suggested. My trick for uppng the flavour just a bit... cumin seeds! YUM!!! Really enjoyed it as did my guests. I may try wild/basmati mix next time.

Huge hit at a July 4 picnic - everyone wanted the recipe! Instead of watercress, a friend gave me her 'arugula' from a farmshare basket, which was actually spinach. I omitted the green onions (not a fan) and replaced with a clove of crushed garlic for flavor. The pecans and some sort of greenery is a must -- adds a nice texture and visual diversity to the salad.

Made exactly as written -- a huge hit at my bbq dinner party with requests for the recipe. Will add this to my regular rotation of summer salads/dishes, as most of it can be made ahead of time.

to reviewer lorikuzma, I actually appreciate when people write what substitutes they made and whether or not it was good, because sometimes I may not have an ingredient on hand and want to see if someone else tried it with what I do have... as now, I love this recipe and have made it before, but now I don't have any pecans and wanted to see if anyone used walnuts. So, bring on the altered reviews, my friends, good and bad!

Rating: 4
This was really good, though I couldn't find watercress and substituted arugula instead, per another recommendation. Don't leave out the pecans as they add a really nice crunch and delicious flavor.

I made this for a 4th of July BBQ and it's now a favorite of our group of friends. We did make a couple of tweaks: we prepared the rice with equal parts water and coconut milk, which gave it a great flavor. We also used a truffle infused Dijon mustard, which blended well with the coconut and used arugula instead of watercress since that's what I had in the house. I have made this 5+ times now and everyone loves it!

Rating: 4
Very, very good! I made it exactly as written, unlike those who substitute ingredients and then decide that the recipe somehow isn't up to par. It has a subtle and special flavor/texture combination. I'm definitely adding this to my permanent repertoire. And, yes, fresh corn DOES make a difference.

Rating: 3
Good but not amazing. I didn't have watercress and substituted fresh arugala, cilantro and parsley. I used frozen corn

I've made this dish twice and used cilantro in place of watercress. It is such a great summer side dish with grilled meat.

Rating: 4
MMm this salad is like nothing I've ever had before. I think the watercress is worth it, even though it's a pain to separate from the stems. I had made this to get rid of some frozen corn i'd had for awhile, and it must be SO much better with real corn!

I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. We added cherry tomatoes. I have been asked by my entire party for the recipe! I made it with the Chilantro Lime Surf and Turf kebabs.

This is a fantastic salad, perfect for grilling-out season when you want a starch that's not too heavy and doesn't need to be served hot. I grilled the corn and added the green onions raw. A great flavor and texture combo that my guests really enjoyed.

I skipped the watercress and served this warm as a side dish. Fantastic.

I've been making this since I received the magazine in the mail in June 2000. It's easy (though stemming the watercrss -- I only use 2 big bunches --takes some time) and soooo good. Sometimes I make 1 and a half times the dressing, depending on how dry the salad is. It's always a big crowd pleaser, perfect as a side for anything grilled.

This is such a great dish. I love it with marinated beef on the grill. It's fresh, easy and such a great thing to take to a pot-luck, picnic or other gathering. Our gourmet group all raved about it!

It is delicious. The vinegarette is the key. I thought the praline pecans made it too sweet, but others loved it just as it was. I also used pear infused white basamic vinegar in addition to the red wine vinegar. This time I am going to add a granny smith apple.

Excellent salad. Family and guests all agreed that it was a welcome change from pasta salad. I followed the advice of others to substitute baby spinach for the watercress and to add dried cranberries. With all of the colors, the salad has wonderful eye appeal, too.

Really yummy. I vary this dish with a pecan praline. Melt sugar in a dry saucepan until golden, add the pecans with a dash of salt. Stir to coat nuts with sugar and let cool on foil. Then chop praline and add to salad. Alway receives many compliments and raves.

Delicious. This has been a summer staple of ours since it first appeared in the magazine. I sometimes omit the watercress, add dried cranberries, and use various flavors of mustard to spice it up a bit. An excellent picnic dish!

I make this all the time and it always elicits tons of compliments and requests for the recipe. It's easy to make, but stemming the watercress (I only use 2 big bunches) takes an awful lot of time; this is not something to make when you're in a hurry.

Rating: 2
I made the recipe as suggested except cut the oil by 1/3 and the watercress by 1/3. On the plus side, it was easy to make in a large quantity and serve at room temp for a party, and went well with the grilled fish and sausages. But the taste was just OK--kind of bland. I think it would be better with almonds and next time I'll use spinach or arugula, and jazz up the vinaigrette.

Rating: 2
This was OK. It was a little bland. I omitted the watercress, subbed pinenuts for the pecans and doubled the vinegrette (except the oil - would have been way too much). I also added a diced rep pepper for color. I am still searching for a good rice salad dish and would make this again in the meantime.

Rating: 3
I made this with only one bunch of watercress and substituted slivered almonds for the pecans. The people at my party couldn't stop telling me how good it was. They cleaned out the bowl. I thought it was good, but not fantastic. Some minced red onion might be good in it as well.

This was the best rice. Everyone loved it. I doubled the dressing but used only half the olive oil it called for. I also used the spinach in place of the watercress. I will make this again.

Delicious! but... the cress overpowered the corn. And I only used one bunch, about 6 oz (before removing stems). Next time I'll use baby spinach instead, because it's really beautiful with the green contrast. Or maybe a small bunch of cilantro.

This was delicious! I have tried several of the rice salad recipes from Bon Apetit and Gourmet, and this by far the best. I used double the dressing plus extra green onions- all of the flavors melded together perfectly. A definate do-again.

tried the recipe as is and was quite pleased with the result. I've always turned down rice salds in the past...this recipe has changed my tune. I rated the recipe with 4 forks because...recipe as is is very good...but the versatility factor is way up there !!! Depending on the cuisine you choose..this recipe is highly adaptable to be a compliment to any meal.I can see cumin added for a southwest meal...and perhaps subbing in basil and sundried tomato for an italian variation. Will be making again.

This has been dubbed "orgasmic salad" by a friend. It's wonderful. I substituted chopped spinach for the watercress. Never take a shortcut with canned or frozen corn. Great recipe!

Great salad especially for a warm summer day with a lot of people since it holds up well. I substituted arugula for the watercress and the combination of flavors was excellent.

A wonderful salad. Great for picnics, no worry about refrigeration. Be sure to use yellow corn (I used white, and the salad really needed the yellow color.). I'd never substitute long grain rice for the basmati... it's just too wonderful with basmati. Very tasty.

Rating: 4
This salad has become our summer favorite. I probably make it 5-6 times. The combo of flavors is wonderful. The watercress is timely to clean but worth it. I often make it with just 1 or 2 bunches if in a hurry. Any white rice works fine if you cannot find basmati. Also tastes great cold the next day

Rating: 3
An excellent salad that offers many options for adaptation. The dressing definetly should be doubled or else it tastes too bland. I also substituted baby spinach for the watercress and sliced almonds for the pecans. I also added Craisins for some color and may even try some crumbled feta in it next time. A big hit with both family and neighbors.

Rating: 3
Great mix of textures. Used grilled corn instead of sauteed. Added balsamic vinegar and basil to vinaigrette. Added chopped sweet pepper to corn mixture. No pecans or watercress. Don't substitute regular rice in this dish, the basmati really sets it off!

Rating: 3
I made this for a picnic w/ friends recently, and everyone really enjoyed it. I let the corn & rice mixture cool slightly in the refrigerator, and added the vinaigrette just before leaving the house; we didn't think any additional dressing was necessary, but perhaps the rice being cool meant that it didn't absorb the dressing as much. I also used toasted slivered almonds instead of pecans, and left out the watercress. Good and easy; I'm sure I'll make it again.

This was a great salad, my family loved it, but 3 bunches of watercress...way to tedious for me. I used one and it was enough. Next time I am going to use baby spinach instead.

I just made the salad for a Memorial Day picnic and everyone loved it. I doubled the dressing, added 1/2 a red pepper and didn't add the watercress because I didn't have it on hand. It was great without it. Next time, I'll try it with the watercress for a different taste.

After reading the reviews about "something missing" from this dish I doubled the dressing and added more mustard, a pinch of cayenne and a crushed clove of garlic the night before. I used a basmatti and wild rice blend mix (with spices in the mix) instead of just plain rice. I also grilled the corn on the smokey joe and while the corn cooked a threw a small zucchini and yellow squash on the grill just to pick up flavor but still keep the crunch and put that in the salad with some sweet diced red pepper. I used 1 large bunch arugala since watercress was unavailable. I also toasted some pine nuts with the pecans and there you have it! The salad was served at room temp. I was great! Not only did nothing seem missing, I got compliments from everyone at the pot-luck. This is definitely a keeper!

Based on previous comments I made some modifications and thought it was very good. I think this needs a more flavorful dressing to set it off. I added honey to the vinegarette & used spinach instead of watercress. The "sweet and sour" taste of the dressing seemed to really work well. I think it would be good with bacon also, but I realize that it probably changes the whole idea of the recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe. I couldn't wait to try it after all the rave reviews, and I followed the recipe exactly, but I feel the recipe is missing something. I think at least one more tablespoon of Dijon in the dressing would help. It has potential so maybe I'll try it again with more Dijon and see how that goes. I served it at room temp as a side dish with the spicy oven fried chicken (which wasn't all that great either - lots of work on just a so-so dinner). I'll give it a try cold tomorrow and see if it's any better. UPDATE: It's not any better cold; in fact it's worse. And I've decided that I do not like watercress - the bitter taste does not go with this dish at all.
