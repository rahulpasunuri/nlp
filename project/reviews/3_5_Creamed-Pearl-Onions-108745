I loved this recipe! I did tweak it, just a little. After reading other reviews, with some saying it was bland, I used veggie broth instead of water after onions were seared and golden, the flavor was unbelievable! I also omitted the teaspoon of sugar and forgot to put in the cloves, oops, but I was extremely happy with the results. Once the onions were cooked, I threw in a bag of frozen sweet peas, heat on low, just let the peas defrost for a couple minutes until the sauce started to simmer again, perfect with a pork tenderloin. Will definitely make this recipe again!

My family loved these and have requested the recipe. I used frozen peal onions. This will be on the list for every Thanksgiving.

I used a bit more butter, a few more cloves, and found it necessary to add plenty of nutmeg with the cream. (The sauce is too bland without the addition of nutmeg). The result was delicious and a big hit as a Thanksgiving side dish!

these were okay. i would absolutely use frozen pearl onions if i were to make it again. far too time consuming otherwise. while creamy, the taste was still fairly bland.

I've never made creamed onions before, but these were terrific. Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner loved them. The little onions were a mess to peel, however.

These were not so good. Even the onion crazed one in the family thought that they were lacking. I followed the recipe exactly and the results were kind of yucky. I will use a different recipe next time, I don't think any tweeking would save this one...

my family has been making this side dish ever since i can remember for turkey dinners. we often buy pre-boiled onions and then just make the bechamel, but i have made them "from scratch" and they're just as good either way. if boiling the onions yourself, be sure to drain them very well - i suggest overnight- not to water down the sauce. enjoy.
