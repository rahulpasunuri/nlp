I was too impatient to figure out what the hell the cutting directions meant to do, but ended up cutting the zucchini in long slabs and it was a really nice change from the typical circular cuts. The seasoning suggested is perfect, especially with a mortar and pestle, although calls for a bit too much oil.

I misread the recipe and instead of cutting the zucchini into ribbons I cut them into narrow wedges (after cutting in half cross-wise). Otherwise I followed the recipe. I agree with everyone that this is a great zucchini recipe, and with one reviewer who does not give 4 forks to zucchini, although I am tempted. The zucchini does not exude moisture (maybe it's the olive oil), and is firm but done. It's fast and fantastic. It looks great with different colored zucchini. I've made it several times now, still cutting into wedges.

Sometimes it's the simple things that work the best, and this is one of them. I think the key is in the thin slices of zucchini. This was a big hit with my family.

Very, very easy and tasty-I didn't use quite that much dried red pepper cause we are somewhat wimpy but it was perfect for us

This was a fabulous recipe for zucchini. I followed the directions as stated. After frying up the zucchini, I drain the excess oil. I then added a tbsp of butter and added the garlic and crushed red pepper. I sauteed until tender then poured the mixture over the zucchini. I then topped that off with parsley and parmesan cheese. Outstanding! My husband gave it 4 forks and so did I. This is a delish way to use the fresh zucchini from the garden come August!

Really good zucchini, and probably the best I've had. I just can't give 4 forks to zucchini, sorry

This recipe is FANTASTIC and extremely easy. Instead of 4 flat slices, I cut into quarter inch pieces and cut those in half to saute and sprinkle grated parmesan on each serving. YUM!

Yum - good and easy way to prepare zucchini. I added a little butter and less oil like another reviewer mentioned.

Great recipe. Fresh and simple! I used half of the oil and a wee bit of butter and it browned very nicely. Perhaps the best Zucchini I've ever cooked!

i agree with the previous reviewer, that this may be the best way i have ever prepared zucchini. it brings back memories of all the giant trays of individually prepared antipasto vegetables that i recall seeing in restaurant windows in rome, none of which i have ever found a recipe for. (i did use less oil, and did everything else exactly as called for).

I think that this is the best way I have ever eaten zucchini. I cooked it a bit longer since the zucchini released a lot of water when I put it in the pan. Very, very tasty! The only downside was that it was a bit greasy for my taste. I think that next time I will use only one tablespoon of oil.

I love this recipe and have made it for years. I like to add sundried tomato marinated olive oil to this dish along with slivers of the tomatoe and a sprinkling of parmesean at the end. YUMMY!

Way too easy and quite good!

Sometimes simple is better. Although I couldn't resist - I added some red wine to deglaze the pan, and cherry tomoatoes. Great and easy!

Some of us did quite well with growing a garden from seed this year and couldn't bring ourselves to throw away the extra plants..... I now know one of the recipes that will frequent my table b/c of the 15 yellow zucchini plants I have growing prolifically in the garden. When in doubt - MAKE THIS DISH! Also try the Lebanese stuffed zucchini - it too is to die for.

This is so easy but so very good. Great for those watching their weight. Will make this again.

Gosh...how easy and yummy! Do NOT cover this dish while cooking. Try to use a skillet big enough so that all of the zucchini is touching the bottom or else you have to cook it a bit longer than 5 minutes. YUM!

What a wonderfully easy and delicious side dish! I loved the addition of the crushed red pepper. I will definitely be making this one again.

this is such a simple and delicious little dish! the browned zucchini had a fantastic flavor and an excellent bite from the red pepper. i followed the recipe exactly except that i used a mixture of green and yellow squash for contrasting colors. i served it as a bed for a grilled tuna steak, and my husband loved it.

I agree with everybody else-- this is a really great dish!

Took VA chef's advice and used about 1 lb. of zucchini instead of 2, kept everything else the same. Good advice - simple and superb sums this up nicely. I felt the key ingredient was fresh parsley - and, of course, make sure to top the zukes with the slightly crisp and crusted garlic / red pepper combo. Fabulous with a fresh herbed chicken dish (I prepared the grilled chicken with mint, onion, and orange), but to cleanse the palate, serve with warm, buttered brown rice or a simple potato side. Yum!

This dish is simple to prepare and very tasty. We like food very garlicky and very spicy, so sometimes I make this recipe with half the amount of zucchini called for in the recipe, but keep the remainder of the measurements as is. Key to this recipe is to use a heavy pan big enough to hold all of the zucchini slices flat in one layer so that they brown slightly. Do not cover with a lid or they will steam instead of cooking to the tender texture that makes this recipe a keeper!

This is simply not special. Next time add basil, onion, red pepper and maybe a little parmesan cheese as a garnish. Much better.

Added eggplant too - great. Put it in the oven with tomato sauce ontop to heat up....YUMMM

Excellent way to serve zucchini. I found it took longer than 5 minutes to make sure all pieces were tender so I'd start it a bit earlier, but will make again!

My children love this recipe. It is easy to make and is wonderful with the sauteed chicken, tomatoes, olives and feta and the red potato skewers with garlic and mustard.

Nice change for serving zucchini. Left off the red pepper. Simple although takes a few minutes just before serving.

This was a nice simple side dish. A good accompanyment to stronger flavors. I didn't have fleur de sel so I used pink Hawaiian sea salt, still good. I will make it again just because it's so easy and I love Zucchini.
