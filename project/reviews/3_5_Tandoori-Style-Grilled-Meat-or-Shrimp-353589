I made this as a component of the shrimp and mango salad. The flavor profile was odd and the copious amount of lime juice used in the marinade "cooked" the shrimp during the four-hour bath before it ever made it to the grill. I'm not a big fan of recipes with fuzzy measurements either: the juice from four large limes is quite variable; one bunch of cilantro; a 3-inch piece of ginger. There's a lot of variability possible.

This was the first time I made anything Indian, but it worked out really well and had a great flavor. I used country style pork ribs that I cut into cubes and threw on my grill pan. Served with Jasmine rice, green beans and zucchini, it was wonderful!

The active time is 20 minutes, but if a recipe takes 4.5 hours, it does not qualify as "quick & easy"! Epicurious, you need to get better at tagging recipes.

I agree with the previous review, the taste was just strange.

I made the tandoori last night and it wasn't a big hit with my family. I made the dish with chicken cutlets, and I found that the marinade gave the chicken a chewy texture, and the flavor was very pungent even though I only marinaded it for two hours.

Excellent flavor and so easy. Made as directed, but doubled recipe to have sauce to pass with dinner. Guests loved it. Used shrimp and boneless skinless chicken thighs.

This was a great weeknight meal. I marinated the chicken for a few hours and grilled it. Our kids that are very picky loved the chicken and ate it all!

Followed the recipe exactly and used store bought Masala. Used chicken breast, cubed and on skewers then BBQ'd. They were fantastic, although I only used a pinch of salt and would be inclined to use a tiny bit more. Served it with Jasmine rice and everyone was pleased. Very nice!

Loved it. Simple, quick, healthy. And there's enough "freedom" in the recipe to experiment, as other reviewers have shown. Thanks a lot

I made it just as specified, using store-bought garam masala. I coated and fried shrimp. At home I would have barbecued, but the vacation rental house where we are does not have a barbecue. I think it would work well on a variety of proteins -- fish, chicken, lamb, even pork tenderloin.

Delicious! I doubled the marinade, and used half for dipping sauce. I made chicken and shrimp.

Fantastic! I highly recommend this - the chicken was moist and had a richly spicy flavor while not being too strong or at all "hot". I made my own garam masala because I didn't have it on hand. I found an easy recipe online for it that used spices I already had in the kitchen. I used lemon juice instead of lime because that's what I had on hand - didn't seem to affect the flavor. I had some difficulty cooking it - it took about fifteen minutes longer than expected and was hard to tell if it was done or not - as we ate, we kept finding bits that were undercooked and putting them back. (I cooked it using wide, flat-bottomed pan on my stovetop.) I think next time I might cook it in the oven on cookie sheets - might allow for more even heat distribution rather than a charred outside (delicious) and a raw inside (gross). I served this with fresh homemade naan (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Naan/Detail.aspx) which was fantastic also.
