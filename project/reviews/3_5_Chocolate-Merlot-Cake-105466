This is one of my favorite cakes to make and share for any occasion. I followed another review's suggestion about doubling the butter and that helped make it nice and moist. I usually frost it with a simple home made chocolate frosting. For the filling, I used raspberry jelly and mixed in a bit of the merlot and a bit of cocoa powder. Top all that with some fresh raspberries and you have a divine and sultry cake that always leaves everyone raving about how good it was. I've made it several times now and receive request to bring it to holiday dinners or parties.

I halved pitted maraschino cherries into the batter and used a cherry jelly with quartered maraschino cherries to mix with the wine. I didn't have any problems with moistness, but I did add a some grated 70% Scharffen Berger and a couple tablespoons of the maraschino juice to the batter. It was a completely different flavor than just using the wine.

Perfection! I baked it at 160C for 25 min in a convection oven. Also made a syrup of merlot and raspberry jam to moisten the cake (I put syrup in all of my cakes), put in a middle layer of fresh berries, and glazed it with chocolate sour cream ganache (100g chocolate + 100g sour cream + 1.5T maple syrup).

I was so impressed with this! I only made it becasue it'd been in my recipe box for years, and we'd just opened the WORST bottle of wine, but I was trying to see if there was some way to salvage it, because we certainly couldn't drink it! I used it in this recipe, and the cake was delicious with just a powdered sugar sprinkle (didn't make the jelly or puree). I'm not sure so much that it's an "adult" flavor, more just that you want to be expecting it to not be a regular chocloate cake. If you are anticipating a new flavor, you will be very pleased!

I rated it 2 forks because my first cake came out dry as well...but as a professional pastry chef I can fix things. So on my first attempt (the dry cake) I made a simple syrup with merlot and sprinkled the cake. The second time I increased the butter by 1/2. Both options work great.

Because this dessert contained two of my favorite things (chocolate and wine), I couldn't wait to make it. However, because I live by myself, and didn't have an occasion to make a cake, I decided to alter the recipe a bit: I made a half batch, and instead of making it in a cake pan, I used a muffin tin. I filled the muffin tin half full with batter, then scooped a Tablespoon of the wine jelly in the center and topped it off with more batter. I baked them for about 25 minutes, but I think I could've just baked for 20 minutes...they were just a tad dry. The result was still fantastic! I got wonderfull chocolate cake-muffins with an exposion of jelly when I bit into them. The way I made this recipe, I would give it three forks, however, I rated four forks only because I think if I followed the directions exactly it would have been even more wonderful! I am definitely making this cake when I have a special occasion to do so!

OK I must have done something wrong. I did not leave the cake in too long, yet it came out very dry--not moist at all.

Very moist, soft and quite chocolaty - a lovely texture. Definitely an adult taste, though. I brought it to a family function and while my younger cousins did eat it and said they liked it, there was still some left on their plates while the adults licked theirs! I used the jelly filling even though it is summer, and I might actually use more next time. I refrigerated it overnight before sandwiching it between the cake layers so it was firm enough that it could have supported a bit more.

Please could someone tell me whether I should have used self-raising flour or plain flour in this recipe? I used plain flour, as self-raising was not specified, and the cake was nice but not very fluffy. Or is it just meant to be quite a dense cake?

This was terrific, and unusual in flavor. However, for texture, I added 2 oz. shaved chocolate, and reduced the cocoa by 6 tbsp. and butter by 2 tbsp. For an enhanced wine flavor in the jelly, I used one part of jelly to 2 parts of wine, and thickened it with cornstarch. It also made the jelly wonderfully tangy.

I made the cake exactly as written and although the cake had excellent texture, its flavor was not 'amazing' like I expected. I don't think it's the wine I was objecting to (I love alcohol in desserts) but to me the taste lacked depth. I also only managed to use half of the wine jelly between the layers. If I had used more it would have run down the sides. I made a creme anglaise to go with it (http://www.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=13715) and dropped dollops of leftover wine jelly on the creme anglaise on the plate and drew a toothpick through them to create heart designs. I used MagiCake strips (highly recommended) around the cake pans so the layers came out perfectly level and the flat top made a nice surface for the powdered sugar stencil I used. All in all this is a nice easy recipe with potential but I'll need to play with it to bring it from a 3-fork to a 4-fork rating.

This cake is absolutely fabulous. I must say however it is one for more adult tastes. The wine and chocolate flavors compliment eachother wonderfully, resulting in a very rich flavorful cake. I highly recommend it.

I've made this recipe 3 times now, and it was absolutely excellent. I cook in a bundt pan and serve dusted with confectioners' sugar & a little cocoa powder, and garnish with sliced fresh strawberries and good swiss chocolate shavings. I have also served with a fresh strawberry coulis and creme anglaise, which are both excellent accompaniments.

A lovely little luscious dessert! I made it with blackberry preserves in between and it's gorgeous. I considered frosting, but it's so lovely with confectioner's sugar and mint leaves on top that I'm glad I skipped the frosting.

This cake was great! I was a little nervous at first because the batter tasted "winey." But it turned out moist and very tasty. I only had 1 c. of Merlot, so I diluted it to 1 1/4 c. with water. I would recommend this for anyone who is nervous about the wine taste being overbearing, since I found it to be a strong flavor even with the dilution. I wanted to frost it so I used a variation of the chocolate-raspberry frosting (see my review there). You should make this cake!

I own a small café in my town and this is by far the top seller dessert!

The first reviewer was right: this IS an amazing cake! It's beautiful, different and delicious. I didn't have grape jelly, so I used currant jelly instead. Next time I'll try it with the grape jelly. It was a big hit with my work crowd and very luscious to look at. I loved licking the batter off my mixer beaters. This cake is easy, too, and very undemanding. Make it!
