incredible cake! I made it without nuts and used the zest of an entire orange in the cake. the cake came out incredibly thin but so fragrant! Once assembled and allowed to set, that orange flavor permeated the entire concoction, resulting in a dessert that was an incredible marriage of orange and chocolate, exactly what the birthday boy asked for! Takes a long time to make--start early!--but so worth it for a special occasion.

Really delicious but very rich. Worthy of a special occasion.

This is really, really, really delicious. But be warned (well, from the ingredient list alone!): really, really, really rich! I doubled the cake recipe to create four layers, as a few others did. I did NOT double the mousse. I also made the "Praline Chocolate Crunch" from the recipe on this site, "Chocolate Hazelnut Cake with Praline Chocolate Crunch" and I inserted a half-inch thick layer of it INTO the cake, as well as breaking it into shards to decorate the top of the cake. I would definitely recommend doing this. I added orange peel to the crunch recipe to tie the flavours together. Pretty darn sensational. :-)

I have made this cake four times now and it comes out FABULOUS every time. It is kind of fussy, with making the candied orange peels and chocolate curls, but it is so worth it. People are always blown away. It's the sort of once a year dessert that will make you famous at parties. :) It's important to follow the recipe, I stretch it out over two days, doing the cake and orange peels one day and the filling the next.

This recipe created a delicious flavorful cake. I made it to celebrate our sons 21st birthday. We had someone in the group who had a nut allergy so i omitted them. it was decadent perfection! I loved the fact i could make it the day before.

It was amazing. I followed the directions but doubled the cake to have 4 layers. It got raves at a birthday lunch today! It was worth the effort to make the candied orange peel and the chocolate curls. It looked like it came from a fancy bakery!

I just finished making this cake for a friends birthday. I don't even need to taste it to know it will be a hit. I found the instructions worked well and didn't have any trouble getting the layers off the parchment paper. I actually cut my layer in half with the parchment attached and then removed it. I did as another suggested and made two cakes which yielded 4 layers. I had plenty of filling to give a good coat on the top layer. This might have been the fanciest cake I have ever made, I usually go simpler but I was able to follow the directions easily. Thanks for a great special occasion recipe.

I am making this cake for my birthday--I'm a huge chocoholic--and as I'm waiting for the filling to set, I just realized this is a variation on a classic Hungarian torte called "Rigo Jancsi" (Gypsy John). How romantic! I'll have to put on the gypsy music when we celebrate. Haven't assembled it yet, so will post more later once we've tasted it!

This cake took a bit of work but it was definitely worth it. I followed Julia Child's technique for removing the skins of the hazelnuts. Be warned that it will stain a white pot but it works really well. The night before I skinned the hazelnuts and started the mousse. I skipped the candied orange peel. I did not use the tin foil or pastry bag technique - I just winged it since no one eating this cake would care what it looked like as long as it tasted great. And it really did. Everyone loved it! I think that this is the most decadent cake that I have ever made. I'll definitely make this again for some chocolate lovers.

Despite the difficult cake layers, overall, it tasted and looked great! Next time, I'll double the number of cake layers to give it a little more substance.

Rating: 2
The cake layers were soo difficult! They taste great, but are almost impossible to separate from the wax paper. I baked till set, with moist crumbs on a toothpick, cooled completely, and buttered the paper. Along the drier edges, the cake clung so tightly to the paper that the paper ripped as I pulled it off, and in the moist places (the majority of the cake) the paper tore off the top of the cake. We'll see how the rest goes..

I made this for a family luncheon and it was a huge hit - everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I used Ghirardelli chocolate for all, except didn't have milk chocolate, so I used 2 parts semi-sweet & 1 part white chocolate.... and with no time to make the candied orange peel, I left that off, but did include the orange zest. So rich and delicious, it should really be sliced thin.

I made this for a friend's birthday and have had 3 others request it in 6 months. It is time consuming but worth it. I split it up in 3 days: 1. candied orange peels and cake 2. filling and glaze 3. assemble the day before. Make sure you use excellent quality chocolate. It does make a difference.

Excellent, rich, chocolate mousse-like, hazelnut cake with a hint or orange. I've made this cake twice for Christmas to rave reviews of chocolate-loving guests. Once you get the hang of making it, it's quite easy. It could be lighter but then again, you're not tempted to eat too much of it and so it's more of a 'healthy' indulgence, and only for special occasions. I've experimented with serving it cold, room temp and in between and my daughter and I have decided that somewhere in between is best. It has become our Christmas cake!

Did this in three stage days. Chilled the cake layer, then cut in half, moved to foil and placed second layer on top with folded parchment between. Wrapped in plastic, froze then transported to L.A. Day before serving made filling, chilled and spread on both layers after brushing with orange cooking water/liqueur. Chilled, then finished day of serving. Everyone loved it.

I am a skilled baker, so I am pretty stingy with dessert ratings. Still I have to give this cake 4 forks. Great twist on the antiquated traditional chocolate cake. Along, with the previous reviewer, please follow recipe exactly.

I have probably make this cake 30 times by now and each time, people are amazed. I even made this to serve at my husband's restaurant for a special wine dinner to great reviews. It takes some time to put together, but if you plan accordingly the stages can easily be spaced throughout your day and is therefore not all-consuming. Dip a sharp knife in hot water to cut neat slices. Please make exactly as directed and enjoy!

This cake was amazing! I made it last month. It is very rich - but it's elegant - a small slice is such a treat that it was completly worth the time. Everyone loved it. I just came back to get the recipe to make it again! Wouldnt change a thing, definitely a keeper.

This is a chocolate lover's dream cake! I made it for my fiance's birthday party, and it was a big hit. Some were surprised that it was homemade. Very decadent and a pretty presentation. I used Scharffenberger chocolate with great results. I placed the cake in the freezer between layers to speed up the process. This cake can probably serve up to 20 because it is so rich. A thin slice goes a long way.

Hi, I made this cake for the first time and I loved it as did everyone else who ate it. The one question I have is: what is the cleanest way to cut this cake?

Three and a half forks! I showed this recipe to my 12 year old and she wanted it for her birthday cake! I made it over three days, freezing the cake then the mousse on the cake and then I glazed it and put it in the fridge until the following day. It froze extremely well and the results were fabulous. I "donated" the leftover few pieces of cake to the staff at the restaurant and they swooned, even the chef who then asked for the recipe! It rates right up there with the double chocolate torte on this site!

Wonderful recipe, and what a beautiful cake! I made this cake (x2) for a wedding reception last summer and got rave reviews (and no, I am not a chef). The filling was a bit challenging - it wanted to separate. But in the end, it was a huge success. By the way, DO make the candied oranges! I dipped the leftovers in chocolate and served these alongside the cakes. As a less sweet complement, I made orange chiffon cake and the two tastes/textures went well together.

Rating: 4
Fabulous flavors, impressive presentation! Perfect for a "grown-up" birthday party served with Port and/or Champagne. Don't be deterred by the longish instructions -- it takes a lot of time, but it's all quite easy and so worth the effort. I made this for a party of 13 people and had 4 thin slices left over. Rave reviews all around.

I am an experienced cake eater, though a novice cake baker. This is one terrific cake and one that I had no problem making. What could be better? I like some of the suggestions for variation, though it is excellent the way it is. If you are underwhelmed by the end result, you have very high standards indeed!

I made this for my husband's birthday two years ago. It was definitely different and did get rave reviews. I'll second the reviewer who said it was like one big truffle. Extremely rich. I served it to a fairly large crowd and was worried I wouldn't have enough (the cake turned out surprisingly small), but my fears were unfounded. Since it was SO rich, everyone needed only a thin slice for complete chocolate satisfaction! Still, it wasn't as fantastic as I had anticipated for all the work. I'll keep looking for that perfect unique chocolate cake...

Different from other cakes, like a giant chocolate truffle, and I would probably make it again, but something was missing. And it did take quite a long time to make.

I wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be. The orange zest is a necessity, I'll agree, but overall, it just tastes 'ok'. The pizzazz I expected just wasn't there. Oh well, on to the next one...

An amazing cake--worth every bit of labour. Cake is best when served with good coffee or tea--one needs something to offset the richness a bit. Serving slices should also be small. I followed the recipe exactly, and also made my own candied orange peel--easy to do and well worth it. Made the cake the day before and pulled it out of the fridge for two hours before consumption--that made the consistency perfect. I was initially worried that the actual cake part was too thin, but it turned out perfectly. A definite repeat; rave reviews all around.

Wife loved this for valentine's day. As others have said, this is extremely time intensive...takes close to a 6 hrs w/ all the chilling and waiting, but it's fairly easy to make. If you chill the cake layers, they're easy to put on w/o breaking up. If you chill the mousse, it's also easy to put on. Don't chill the block of chocolate or the shavings will come out as a powder. The candied orange zest strips was also easy to make and went pretty well w/ the cake. I think I'd also add a bit more orange zest to the cake next time. You can taste hazelnuts and a hint of orange zest as you eat the cake, but it's not very strong; the grand marnier glaze is probably a good idea. The cake itself was extremely rich and very chocolately; the mousse isn't very fluffy. Each person should really only have about a 1/2" slice. A 1" slice is reallllly filling.

Like some other reviewers, I made this for my husband's birthday today. It was an EXCELLENT recipe. Although it took time, it was not difficult. I'd recommend finding a good book and making a day of baking and reading. I just used Baker's brand chocolate and the cake was GREAT. Can't imagine how good it would be with premium chocolate. I used almonds instead of hazelnuts. I'd like a little more orange taste. Next time may try to substitute orange flavored chocolate for part of the bittersweet. Or I might take the advice of other reviewers and brush the cake with orange flavored liquor.

Rating: 3
While I agree it takes a long time, it is well worth it. I used a combination of valrhona and schaffenberger chocolate and for the cake layers, I used fleur de sel to give it a bit of a caramel-like flavor. It is a bit hard to put the second layer on top of other, so I suggest using a well-oiled spatula. overall great recipe!

Rating: 3
i think there was not enough cake, it was so thin I had to piece it together because it fell apart transfering it. I also put a thin layer of apricot preserves thinned out with G.M because it seemed too chocolately and I think I will make a mandarin orange coulis to serve with it tomorrow. I'm not sure if I would make it again but I am giving it 3 forks because it was easy to make and very chocolately.

I was expecting much more. The orange flavor wasn't nearly intense enough, even though I doubled the orange peel. There wasn't a prominent enough flavor, so I ended up adding coffee and rum to the glaze and filling. The cake was good, but overall there was just too much plain chocolate mousse.

This is a great, beautiful chocolate cake! I was looking for a festive type of cake for my husband's birthday and he fell in love with this one. I found it easy to make even if it required quite a bit of time in the kitchen. I used pecans instead of hazelnuts and orange extract instead of orange peal and it tasted delicious to me, with a very light orange flavor. I think it is important to respect the baking time to get that very moist result. Also, it was lighter on my stomach than I had imagined it would be with all that chocolate and butter -just make sure not to serve unreasonably big slices for dessert!

This is dynamite if you love chocolate! In making filling, whip the cream and refrigerate just before melting the chilled chocolate over simmering water. After adding the butter, if beating doesn't quickly produce a thick glossy mixture, continue to beat over ice water. The mixture was stiff enough after adding the cream to spread on the top easily. Do make orange peel as other contributor suggests. And chopped hazelnuts are readily available and save a lot of time and effort. Can't wait for an excuse (a large group so there are no dangerous leftovers!) to make again.

This was absolutely perfect and received rave reviews from everyone who tried it. I followed the suggestion of a previous post and made the candied orange peels and used the sugar-Grand Marnier mixture to glaze the cake before assembling. I also used pecans instead of hazelnuts because they seem to be more readily available here. Used Callebaut bittersweet chocolate and Scharffen Berger milk chocolate. This takes a lot of time to make but every bite is worth it.

Great cake!! I made the candied orange peel.Peeled the orange zest with a vegetable peeler and cooked in a small pan over med heat with 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of water for about 15 min until translucent. Then strain reserving the suagar syrup and let dry on parchment. Then I added a little Grand Marnier to the suger syrup and brushed it over the cake layers before I assembled the cake. It was wonderful! Do not leave out the orange zest!! It is essential! It takes this cake from the ordinary to the extraordinary! And the orange peel garnish looks beautiful with hazelnuts and chocolate curls.

I have made this recipe twice and it is just fabulous. However, I find that the filling needs more time than stated in the recipe to set both before mixing and once on the cake. Also, this second time I made it, I put extra mousse in a bowl--there is just too much to stay on the cake.

Rating: 4
This was f-a-b-u-l-o-u-s and quite a hit. Instead of the orange zest though, I used about 1 1/2 Tbsp of espresso powder. The coffee/chocolate flavor is great together. Also, instead of chopping the hazelnuts I ground them up in the food processor until they were somwhat fine...this gave it a smoother consistency.

Delicious! Delightful! Follow the recipe exactly as written (like heating the filling even if it isn't solid) and it looks great!

While this recipe does take quite a bit of your time and a little bit of money (I'd say allocate about $25 to $30 for everything if you're doing it right - that is, with premium chocolate), it was absolutely great. Everyone said it was the best cake they'd ever had. One tip: Try a touch less salt than called for; the hazelnut cake portion was a tad on the salty side when tried sans the filling, but it was fine nevertheless. Also, this recipe might lend itself really well to substituting raspberries for the orange flavor...But, the orange is excellent.

OMG, what a great chocolate cake. Made it for the 4th for 12 people & got great reviews. My husband said it was the BEST chocolate dessert that I have made. I did have a hard time finding hazelnuts here in Florida this time of the year. Made candied rose petals & orange slices along with the chocolate curls. Great presentation! I made coffee ice cream to go along with the cake. A very rich tasting dessert, well worth the time & money to make.
