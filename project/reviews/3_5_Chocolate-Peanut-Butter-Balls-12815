I'm sad this recipe has gotten such negative reviews because it is one of our family's favorites. I like to substitute Rice Krispies for the graham cracker crumbs, which everyone seems to like quite a bit. Freezing the balls before dipping them in the chocolate is key to making sure they hold together. I use a toothpick to dip the balls in the chocolate sauce and then quickly pop them back in the freezer for another 5-10 min. This year I also melted white chocolate and dipped some half in white and half in dark chocolate. These really are a great little desert!

I agree with the previous reviewer. The melted chocolate chips were a granular mess and unsuitable for coating anything. The treats were salvaged by making a quick trip to the store to buy Wilton light cocoa chocolate melts to coat the peanut butter balls. Prepared 28, served that night at a party and all were devoured. I'd make again, but use the chocolate melts instead of chocolate chips.

Could someone please tell me why this recipe was posted? I'm not a professional, but I'm pretty good in the kitchen and this was a disaster. I can't believe this was ever kitchen-tested before being posted. I ended up turning the mixture into a type of fudge. What a waste of ingredients and time.

The recipe is good. I like the added crunch of the graham cracker crumbs. I would suggest refrigerating the mixture for a couple of hours, make the balls and refrigerate again before dipping into chocolate. I do not think the butter in the chocolate is necessary. Also, try dipping in white chocolate; I received positive reviews on that combination.

These fell apart like mad. After trying to make them we gave up & ate the p.b. & choc. from their separate bowls w/ our spoons. Yummy but a mess.

This is very similar to something my grandmother made each christmas. Her recipe called for powdered sugar though, which made a big difference in how the dough handles. She also used to add some chopped pecans and some coconut, which I loved. Another, easier version is this: 1 lb powdered sugar, 1 1/2 C. peanut butter (smooth) and 1/2 C. butter, 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt. Mix well, chill dough and form into small balls, then dip chocolate. Very yummy.

Don't waste your time. The peanut butter mixture is so sticky and hard to handle. What a mess. I had to put it in the freezer in order to make it manageable. It is off my list.

I made this recipe with 2 cups of peanut butter with a third cup of powdered sugar. The dough was not crumbly with the alteration. It was great, everyone raved about it.

These are delicious! Although, I did experience a ton of difficulty with the dough. It spent the night in the fridge' and was so crumbly. My only alteration besides chilling for WAY too long was using my fingers to dip- the fork was a nightmare. Next time I wont chill it for so long. So, asthetically- not the most tantalizing looking cookie but the taste is mind-blowing- nirvana! I kept thinking about the reviewer who said to put the dough in a pan and pour the chocolate on top, to make bars. Excellent advice for next time!Thank you Ep' and Cooks for all your comments.

These "buckeyes" are classic and much simpler than many seem to think. Mash peanut butter with sugar and some butter and whatever else you want to get to a good rollable consistency and make great flavor. Use oatmeal or oat bran or crushed cereal, honey instead of sugar, vanilla flavoring, yogurt if it's too dry...whatever tastes good. Then - just melt the chocolate and dip the balls and chill them. Freezer works fast. Don't add anything to the chocolate chips - you don't need it.

AAAGGGGHHH! I can't STAND "nutritional" reviews! This is not cookinglight.com, and thankfully so!! The purpose of this recipe is not to fit it within your points plan or to lower your cholesterol. It is to meet the needs of your sweet tooth. And it does a great job at it! If you're looking for health conscious recipes, search for bean sprouts, not peanut butter balls!!!

I too am getting tired of the comments regarding calories, healthy vs. unhealthy food fat-free, etc.; this site is for people who enjoy food that tastes good and love to experiment with new recipes. There are plenty of other sites that cater to the fat free philosophy. If you want to lose weight, why on earth would you be scanning recipes about peanut butter desserts???

Like the others, it took me more than a couple of times and a little tweaking to make this recipe work. I suggest making the peanut butter mix a day early, roll them into balls, and then freeze them on a baking sheet. This will successfully harden them, and also when you pour on the warm chocolate, they won't melt as quickly, and turn into mush. For the chocolate coating, I melted it in the microwave since I had no luck getting it to a smooth consistency on the stove. When you heat the chocolate, and you find it's looking more like frosting, add a little bit of water and then reheat. This will help a lot! It didn't affect the taste, and made the chocolate so much easier to work with. Once I did this, not only were these quite tasty, but aesthetically pleasing as well!

I used to make this sort of thing when I was younger. The recipes that I used to go by included flour. Perhaps it was accidently left out of this recipe. I also don't see the need for SO much butter! Horribly unhealthy. The best thing about this recipe is that you can mix and match ingredients as you like. When I was younger I used to drizzle chocolate syrup into the PB mix! I suggest you use just enough butter to moisten the graham cracker crumbs and then add a tad bit more. Then sift in some flour until the mixture is closer to a pie dough consistency. Peanut Butter is a strong flavor so don't worry about diluting it with the flour. And try rolling the balls in sugar if the chocolate is not working for you. Enjoy!

This recipe was a dismal disaster. The peanut butter mix was sticky and pasty and never became firm, no matter how long it was chilled. The chocolate coating was a frothy mix, somewhat like frosting. The candy itself tasted great, but I needed a spoon! This recipe can only be improved by major cgange, if not total replacement.

I, too, had a hard time getting the peanut butter mixture to harden, but I improvised and made bars out of the chocolate and PB. I spread the PB on the peanut of a 8" square baking dish and then spread the chocolate mixture on top. I should have put chocolate on the bottom, PB in the middle and the rest of the chocolate on top. Live and learn. Didn't look "pretty", but it tasted absolutely decadent! Give it a shot.

I'm not sure why this recipe is getting great reviews. I followed the directions to the letter, and ended up with mushy peanut butter mixture (even after refrigerating it for THREE hours) that would barely form balls and would certainly not stay on a fork, and chocolate "dip" that was the consistency of frosting, and would never coat the balls, even if they were dipable. This was a disaster.

Wonderful recipe for those in love with chocolate and peanut butter. Make sure the chocolate is cooled or you will get a "marble" effect with the peanut butter. It doesn't matter if you do, though. They're still delicious!
