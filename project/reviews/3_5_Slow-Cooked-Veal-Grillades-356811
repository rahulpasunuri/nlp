I scaled the recipe in half and opted to use pork shoulder instead of veal. Instead of using bacon fat, I used a bit of olive oil to brown the cutlets. For my grits, I cooked them following the package instructions which called for a combination of milk and water and I substituted a bit of creamy goat cheese for the mascarpone since I had it on hand. While this was good on the first night, I found the leftovers even more delicious - perhaps it gave the flavors more time to marinate. I think the cheese was a bit unnecessary in the grits and would probably just prepare them plain if making again since the grillades were already quite rich. All in all, another successful Besh recipe attempt. http://epifurious.tumblr.com/post/34071411058/slow-cooked-pork-grillades-and-grits

Made this for dinner with a few changes - subbed pork shoulder for veal and used olive oil in place of bacon fat. Very rich and delicious and the flavor only improved with time! http://epifurious.tumblr.com/post/34071411058/slow-cooked-pork-grillades-and-grits

My family loved this satisfying entree. The recipe is very forgiving in that it allows you to use whatever meat you like (I used very inexpensive pork loin) and to vary the amount of veg you use and the type of oil. I used 1/2 bacon grease and 1/2 olive oil. I think the bacon really adds to the mellow flavor to offset the tang of the tomatoes, onions, and spice. I also added 1/2 T. sugar to balance it out. Yum! I don't think Chef John Besh meant that this dish is literally the equivalent of pot roast--I think he meant that you cook it slowly and can make it ahead and serve it later like pot roast.

Really delicious dinner. I had a little bit of difficulty finding the veal shoulder but I'm glad I persisted - it is a great cut and very tender. Everyone in the family really enjoyed this. Did substitute olive oil for the bacon fat - only because I did not plan well. Served with the cheese grits as suggested - enjoyed them but could have used more jalapeno and more cheese for our taste.

I have not yet made this recipe, but it is similar to the one I got from my grandmother. The main difference is that my grandmother used olive oil instead of bacon drippings, so hers is healthier. I do wish to comment. In the article, you stated that grillades are the New Orleans equivalent of pot roast, which is not the case. The New Orleans equivalent of pot roast is Boeuf (or Veau) en Daube. In the hot New Orleans summers, this was turned into Boeuf en Daube Glacé, by straining and clarifying the braising liquid, adding plain gelatin, slicing the beef (or veal)and arranging it in a mold lined with some of the aspic, chilled, along with cooked peas and carrots. The mold is then filled with the rest of the aspic and served chilled. Grillades are actually the New Orleans version of Swiss steak.
