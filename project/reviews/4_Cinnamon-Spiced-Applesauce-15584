Fabulous! I made a triple batch with freshly picked apples and added a 3 inch cinnamon stick to them while they were simmering. I used an immersion blender (after removing the cinnamon stick) in place of a fork to break up the apple chunks at the end. It was relatively easy to make and very good!

Made this today with all organic Gala apples and I used apple pie spice instead of cinnamon. Mashed the apples with a potato masher as the liquid evaporated and it was the perfect texture. I think the lemon juice is for color (acidulated liquid) and not flavor.

I used Trader Joe's Pear Cinnamon Cider instead of water and did not add any sugar. Delish!

Made this today and was pleasantly surprised by how good it tastes. I misread the recipe and added 1/2 c brown sugar, so just chopped up a few more apples and added a smidge ore water. Used mostly Gala and a few Honeycrisp from a friend's tree. Like other reviewers, I doubled the cinnamon and omitted the lemon. Used a smart stick to blend which resulted in a nice, coarse texture. Will definitely make this quite often this fall and winter.

So easy and so delicious! I don't know what took me so long to make my own applesauce. I left out the lemon, by the way, and I can't really imagine it could have made it any better.

My family described this as "apple pie without the crust". It's luscious.

Very good. I doubled the apples and halved the sugar. Left it chunky and ate it while it was still hot. I drizzled a few drops of heavy cream over each serving. It adds a miniscule amount of fat and a little creaminess.

As quick and easy as it looks. I like to leave the peel on  it's easier, and makes the texture more interesting. To adapt for the Crock Pot, reduce water to 1/3 cup and cook on low for 5 - 6 hours.

As with many others, this was my first time making applesauce (which amazes me, because I absolutely love apples and this time of year). And with most of the reviews, this is absolutely fantastic. Simple, and delicious--I made exactly as written and pureed the final product in a food processor (I don't like chunky applesauce). My niece and sister and brother-in-law loved it, and they are sometimes tough critics. I'm making my second batch now (less than 1 week later).

Amazing! My 1st try at homemade applesauce. Used 5 Honeycrisps & 1 Macintosh, 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 cup water. Took a long time (30 min) for all the water to evaporate, but well worth it.

I forgot to add that I used Pumpkin Pie seasoning rather than just cinnamon. Like an earlier reviewer, I'll never buy applesauce from a jar again! The recipe says it can be prepared a few days in advance. Be careful though, if your house is like mine, it will be gone before the day is over.

I made this recipe for Christmas Eve. It's New Year's day and I've made it three times since! Everyone has loved it. I've made it with Gala and Golden Delicious and will try other varieties too. Family, friends and babies have loved it. I made it once without lemon and it made no real difference. I served it at room temp and without pureeing the apples. It's helped me to eat fewer desserts over the holidays too. (Think I'll go make some now!)

I can only reiterate what everyone else has written: simple recipe, fantastic applesauce and I'll never buy it from the store again. I used almost 4 1/2 four pounds of Jonagold apples but the same measurements for the other ingredients except the cinnamon, which I doubled. I also dark brown sugar rather than the light in the recipe didn't add any lemon juice as I discovered I didn't have any, but no one missed it. I pureed it before adding the cinnamon as my kids don't like chunky applesauce. They sure love this!

This was soooo good. I used Ambrosia apples and left the skins on and it was great. I would add less water next time, and I cooked it for a little longer than the recipe said. I used Penzey's Ceylon cinnamon which was excellent. I recommend serving it warm. Yum!

I made this applesauce with apples from our tree. I did not add the amount of sugar the recipe called for and it was delicious. Like another reviewer said-I will never buy applesauce from the store again.

Yummy! I made this with 3 Golden Delicious and 3 Royal Gala apples. The only change I will try next time is to decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup.

Absolutely the best (and easiest) applesauce ever. Will never serve store bought again.

Loved it. Excellent and easy. Next time I think I will cut back on the lemon juice to reduce the lemon flavor a bit.

Very nice! I used a hand blender to puree the apples once they became tender -- left them slightly chunky and perfect!

I doubled the amount of cinnimon. The response at home was, "we're not eating store bought anymore!" I'm now doubling the recipe and have made twice.

Very good and simple to make. We like chunky applesauce, so I didn't even bother to peel the apples. Also doubled the cinnamon.

this applesause was very easy and simple. I served it warm and it was delicious.I would definetly make it again.

I also found this to be very flavorful and definitely preferable to anything commercial. I saved myself the tedium of peeling the apples, adding fiber and a pleasant rosy glow without detracting from the sauce's texture. It was delicious with Potato Latkes on this site, served with sauerbraten, sweet and sour cabbage, and dried cherry/pear/cream cheese strudel for Oktoberfest.

The applesauce was great! I used half Macs and half Granny Smiths...wonderful!

Very easy to make. Tasted very much like the filling in an apple pie. Was a bit worried during cooking that it wouldn't be sweet, but it was!

Very easy to make, and absolutely delicious. I increased the cinnamon, and added a little nutmeg.

This was super easy, and a big hit. When boiling the applesauce I added a small piece of ginger, and it gave it a slight bite.

Definitely the best home-made applesauce I've ever had. I will never, ever, buy store-bought again. I have made this for several occasions, and I always have someone mention that it is the best that they've ever had.

I agree with the reviewer who wrote "why buy when it's this good and so easy to make!" I made this as an accompaniment to the six-hour pork roast. It was not-too-sweet, and very tasty.

This is perfect. Why buy it in the jar, when it taste this good homemade.

This dish is excellent warm, but it is also very good refrigerated. I have used it as a side dish for pork chops, with great reviews from my family.
