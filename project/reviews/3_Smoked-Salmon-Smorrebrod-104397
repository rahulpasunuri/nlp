My husband and I were given a packet of smoked salmon as a gift, so I wanted a recipe that would use it well. We halved this recipe and made it for breakfast this morning. Delicious! Husband raved about it, and we've added it to our recipe box permanently.

To the cook from Victoria, BC: I can appreciate your enthusiasm, but please don't rate the recipe if you haven't tried it.
