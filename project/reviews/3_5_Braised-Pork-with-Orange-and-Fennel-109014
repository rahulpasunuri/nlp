Yum. Love the orange and anise and cinnamon. Reheated extremely well. Very easy.

One more note - re: salt. I used low-sodium soy sauce and skipped seasoning the meat.

This rocked our socks. I braised mine in a slow cooker for 8 hours, and used pork tenderloin instead of shoulder (it's what I had!). This was delicious. My dinner guests loved it, and I loved that it tasted absolutely unique, but not too out there, for unadventurous eaters. I didn't have cheesecloth, so just kept an eye out for the non-edible bits. Served with the parsnip, hazelnut and bacon gratin (also from this site), broccoli with wild mushrooms (also from this site) and roasted potatoes.

I hate to give anything 4 forks, but this came very close. Prepared the recipe almost exactly as written, substituting only parsley for cilantro. This combination of flavors is outstanding. I added almost-cooked brown rice the last several minutes of the braise, which soaked up juices and turned the dish into a complete meal. Will definitely make again.

I made this yesterday afternoon when we were expecting house guests but weren't sure what time dinner would be. It's a great recipe to make and keep warm. The meat was beautifully tender and I appreciated the complexity of the flavors. I cut down on the soy sauce and added a squeeze of fresh orange juice at the end. I thought the cilantro was perfect for the layering of flavors, and to freshen the dish. I served it over mashed Yukon Gold potatoes with broccolini on the side. I'll make this again, definitely.

I just tried this recipe with a venison shoulder (deboned), and it turned out great.

Mmmmm mmmmm mmmm! This dish is amazing. My minor modifications: - I browned the meat longer than called for in the recipe, more like 10 minutes per batch, to get it as brown as possible. - Heeding the other reviewers' warnings, I used only 1/4 cup soy sauce and found the dish to be plenty salty. - I braised the meat for 2 hours instead of 1. - I added more broth when I added the fennel and only braised the fennel for about 20 minutes, as I like my veggies tender-crisp. - I threw in the juice of one orange at the end. I served it with the Sweet Potatoes with Citrus and Brussels Sprouts with Bacon and Thyme (recipes on this site), and found it to be excellent, good enough for company. My husband said it was one of the best dishes I have ever made (and he really likes my cooking). Bravo!

I found to make this truely exceptional - I had to cook the meat for longer than called for. When the meat was starting to fall apart, I helped the process by using a pair of forks to shred the meat, removed the orange peel and other bits that hadn't dissolved. Then after draining some of the liquid, I put the pot back in the oven but this time under the broiler to carmelize, stirring frequently for consistent texture throughout the meat. When done, I drained the liquid entirely and served the meat mexican / fajita style with salsa, guac, spicy chipole sauce for those that like heat, dirty rice etc. A hit everytime!

This was fabulous. I added some red pepper flakes and orange juice, used white wine instead--otherwise followed the recipe. Really, over-the-top great. Served with mashed butternut squash. Yum.

We liked this very much; a nice complexity of flavors, and I love fennel in anything. I had only 1# of pork shoulder left, so made only one-third of the recipe, and it came out fine. It should freeze nicely.

The sauce is so aromatic that you can't help but love this dish! Substituted 1 can of vegetarian broth for the chicken broth (because I didn't have enough chicken broth) but I'm sure that didn't make the recipe any different. Extremely flavorful and the pork was "fork" tender. I look forward to serving this at one of my dinner parties. Don't hesitate to make this even though it does take a bit more "prep" time than suggested, but well worth it. Bon Appetit!

I cooked this recipe according to the directions and was very impressed with its subtile, complex flavors. My husband liked it as well. The meat was tender and the fennel was a perfect accompaniment. The sauce was scrumptious. The only hard part, where I live, was finding 3 fennel bulbs, but I did evebtually.

I noticed some said it was too salty, so--since I didn't have an orange--I substituted orange juice for 1/4c of the soy sauce. I only had 2c of chicken broth, so that's all I used and there was still PLENTY of liquid. In fact, after braising it in a covered cast iron pan on the stove top for 2 hours, I then strained the meat, simmered the liquid to reduce it, and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up at the end. It was delicious (even without the fresh fennel--I added extra fennel seed--and cilantro).

Absolutely delicious! I used the lite salt soy sauce. The flavors were wonderful.

Both my husband and I thought this dish was delicious. However, I did make some changes. I used a lean cut of pork and trimmed any fat off of it. Also, I did not bother putting the cinnamon stick and anise seeds in a bag, I just threw them in. The cilantro is not really necessary, it doesn't add much flavor, it just looks pretty.

I was intrigued by the combination of flavors in this recipe, but wasn't thrilled with how it turned out. I ended up with too much liquid, and the sauce lacked the vivid flavor I was hoping for.

Braising is an excellent way to make pork shoulder and the meat was very tender, but this combination of ingredients just did not work for us. Fennel and Soy Sauce - never again!

It always amazes me when someone will try a recipe when they do not like a major ingredient--like pork shoulder. And then they give it a bad critique. I love pork shouder--wonderful flavor. And I love all of the other ingredients. Just did not like them in this recipe. I made it the day before, which is great to be able to skim off the fat. Out of 4 of us, 1 thought it was the best beef (?) he'd ever had.

1/2 cup of soy sauce is an amazing amount of salt---way too salty. The fennel plus the coriander together gave this a foul smell/taste. I really did not like this dish. Pork shoulder has lots of hidden fat pockets/gristle, which always bothers me, and this did not add to its appeal.

This was absolutely delicious. (Really a 3.5. I am very sparing with my 4-fork reviews.) The flavor is just terrific -- it tastes like you went to a lot more trouble than you actually did. It would work equally well for a dinner party or for a busy weekday evening. I followed the recipe exactly, except for that I used star anise instead of anise seed (is there really a difference in flavor?) and used a tea ball instead of cheesecloth, per another reviewer's suggestion. I also skimmed off the fat before adding the fennel. Served with boiled new potatoes and Brussels sprouts.

Even without adding any salt to the meat, this dish was too salty, overpowering all the other flavors. The meat was tender and succulent, so it might be worth trying again with reduced sodium soy sauce.

This was delicious! Served the 1st time on rice, even better the 2nd time on mashed potatoes. Perfect winter comfort food.

I made the recipe almost exactly, just used 2 fennel bulbs instead of 3 ($3 each was a little pricey that day!). I also used boneless shoulder "ribs" (country style) as they were on sale that day. It was delicious! I used a tea ball instead of cheesecloth--very easy. I found a better source for fresh fennel, and can't wait to make it again!

We just had this great dish, prepared exactly as prescribed, except for a little extra garlic. My wife claims it's my inability to grow up and follow instructions, while I beleive it is my last vestage of rebel with a cause attitude. I would like to try it on a cold, rainy winter day, but who would have guessed it would be a bright and shiny and 72 degrees on 1/31/04 in Northern California. I did'nt add any salt and used low salt soy, and the sauce was still a tad salty. The pork was sooo tender and tasty. The only thing I will change is to skim the fat off the braised pork before one adds the anice/fennel root. Otherwise it's a keeper and a great meal for a tight budget.

This is a keeper! I would love to make this in the dead of winter for company. Like the cook in San Francisco, I didn't have fresh anise (my Safeway didn't have any) and threw in a handful of fennel seed. This was delicious; served with baby brussel sprouts and roasted potatoes. Also did away with the cheesecloth and just put in cinnamon and anise seed.

Wonderful! This recipe is perfect as is (why mess with a great thing?!?!) Delicious with Jasmine rice.

A perfect one dish meal. I also omitted the cheesecloth step and just threw cinnamon and anise seeds into the stew.

i used lite soy sauce to keep this from being too salty. Also, I didn't have fresh fennel for one batch and so use fennell seed that at least gave a hint of the flavor. satisfying.

Do you think that this would be just as good with chicken or beef?

My family really loved this recipe. I had all the ingredients except anise seed and cheesecloth. I just threw in a cinnamon stick and thought it came out very well. The pork was extremely tender. Roasted some potatoes, sweet potatoes and carrots alongside. Yummy!

This is an awesome recipe. Perfect for cold weather - hearty and soul satisfying! I added celery with the onions and garlic, and red pepper flakes for a little added spice. Served this over jasmine rice and sauteed bok choy (sauteed with a little of the juice from the braised pork). A good red wine completes the meal and makes this a total re-do!
