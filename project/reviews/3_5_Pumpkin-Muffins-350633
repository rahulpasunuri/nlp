Delicious! I used many of the changes recommended by other reviewers. For mine I used 1 cup of white flour, 1 cup of oats, yogurt instead of buttermilk (out of necessity), white sugar instead of brown (didint have any brown), I also used the full can of Libbys pumpkin (small can) and increased the amount of the spices, some I doubled, some a little less than double. I was very happy with the flavor and texture. Next time I will use less sugar (my only complaint: they are too sweet!) and whole wheat flour. I also didnt use raisins but substituted what I had - toasted almonds. Would have prefered walnuts but yummy anyway. Thanks.

As the recipe is written, the muffins are dry and without much flavor. Followed other's suggestions and DOUBLED the spices, vanilla, and raisins. Added more pumpkin (not sure how much.) Next time, I will use a whole can of pumpkin. The pepitas disappear inside the muffin - not sure the purpose they serve. On tops, they kinda fall off and make a mess. So, If you put them on top, tap them down a bit o they don't fall out. I will make this again - next time will use craisins which have a lot more flavor - and color than the golden raisins. Giving it three, because when tweaked it is good. As the recipe stands, it deserves 2 forks. With these tweaks, it is yummy.

Wish I had followed some of these helpful tips before making these. This recipe definitely needed some amendments. The muffins were good but not as moist and flavorful as I would have liked. I even added some applesauce and a few more spoonfuls of pumpkin. Next time I will try the greek yogurt and 1/2 cup more pumpkin. Also the tip to add molasses sounds like it would be delicious!

I'm not a good baker, and my muffins usually come out like little hockey pucks, but these were super moist and yummy. I LOVED them. I followed the Cook from Seattle's suggestions and used 1 cup pumpkin rather than 3/4 cup and 1/2 Greek yogurt instead of the buttermilk. I also used 1 cup quick-cooking oats, 1/2 cup ground flax, and 1/2 cup flour. Perfect.

This is a wonderful recipe. Increased the cinnamon just a bit and used nutmeg rather than allspice. Wonderful flavor and crumb.

Excellent recipe. I changed a few items. No brown sugar. Added molasses I think this added Immensly to the flavor. also added nuts and dried figs rehydrated in Bourbon and used apple sauce instead of butter. Yummy!!!! Would recommend this highly

As is, I feel this recipe would be more like 3 forks. However, thanks to everyone's wonderful suggestions, my muffins came out moist, slightly sweet, and with great spice. I used 1 C WW pastry flour, 1/2 C cake flour, and 1 cup of oats, plus 3 T of ground flax seeds. Like most, I added extra pumpkin and spices; I also subbed 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg for the cloves. I also used 1/2 C lowfat yogurt in place of the buttermilk and cut the butter in half. I added cranberries instead of raisins, omitted the pepitas, and sprinkled chopped almonds and vanilla sugar on top. Overall, these muffins were really tasty- thanks to previous reviewers' suggestions, I will definitely make them again!

I've made this recipe countless times and it never disappoints. My guests always rave about this dish! Sometimes I do the accompanying bean dish, sometimes I serve over quinoa with veggies or cous cous. I follow the recipe exactly, and I thicken the sauce and drizzle over in the end. SO GOOD!!!

Rating: 4
Excellent! I followed the recipe exactly except that I added 1/4 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup vanilla yogurt and mini chocolate chips. They were moist, delicious, and my kids devoured them. Also, I cooked in mini-muffin pans for 15min rather than the suggested 20. Didn't add the seeds.

like other reviewers, i modified this recipe. i added dried cranberries along with the rasins, increased the spices & sugar, included the zest of a tangerine, used a combination of oats, whole wheat flour & all purpose flour. I used greek yogurt instead of buttermilk (substitution of necessity). I also used 1 & 1/4 cups of pumpkin and grated about 1/3 of a whole nutmeg into the batter. I made a glaze of cream cheese, confectioners sugar, and maple syrup, which was pretty tasty. next time, i might add some dark chocolate chips.

I added extra spices and walnuts to mine. I honestly think it still would have been delicious as originally posted, but with these tweaks, they were phenomenal.

I made these tonight (for the 2nd time) for a bake sale. I used 1 cup of pumpkin puree, no seeds, no raisins, sprinkled sugar in the raw on top, otherwise followed the recipe. They turned out light, fluffy, moist and delicious! My husband loves them, and has requested that we buy them back at the bake sale! Next time I make them, I want to add walnuts, he wants the rum soaked raisins.

The description says these are fluffy but mine turned out very dense. Tasty, but dense. On day two you could hurt someone if you threw one of these at them!

Rating: 3
Upon reading some of the reviews, I decided to make minor tweaks - I added 50% more of all of the spices and doubled the vanilla. I left out the pumpkin seeds because I could not find them in the store. :-) I used craisins instead of raisins. Everybody likes craisins, and I do not know a single person who voluntarily eats golden raisins. Muffins came out OK, but a little bland and slightly dry. Also, not enough craisins. I tried again, this time DOUBLED the spices and the CRAISINS, and used 1 cup of pumpkin. They came out much better, but could still use more craisins and a tad more spices.

Rating: 3
I would give this adjusted version 4 stars after the changes I made from suggestions below. I too substituted 1 cup of AP for 1/2 WW flour and 1/2 oats. I used a fraction of the butter and filled to 1 cup with Canola oil. I also substituted 1/2 of the raisons for chopped candied ginger. Sprinkled oats and a touch of candied ginger on top ... excellent!

Great muffins! They came out super moist and tasty. After reading some reviews, I made some revisions to the recipe. 1/4 craisins 1 1/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup oats I doubled the cinnamon and ginger but only put in a pinch of allspice. Left out the cloves. 1/2 cup canola oil instead of margarine 3/4 splenda brown sugar blend 1/2 cup soymilk with a bit of vinegar mixed in (instead of 1/4 cup buttermilk) left out the pumpkin seeds. my family was astounded by these muffins! they came out really good and i can't wait to make them again soon!

Much thanks to the previous entries for all the great suggestions. I modified this recipe so much, it doesn't look much like the original. I used cranberries instead of raisins, added oats, halved the butter,used greek yogurt instead of buttermilk, pumpkin pie spice and added more pumpkin. I particularly liked adding oats to the top of the muffins before putting them in the oven, but that's a personal preference. It still needs a little umph to it. Can't wait to keep experimenting with this recipe.

Rating: 3
Definitely not spicy or sweet enough for me, but a good start. Like other reviewers I used half AP flour and half WW, which I think makes it a shoe-in for a tasty breakfast muffin. Upped the cinnamon and ginger and also added a bit of nutmeg, but it still wasn't quite enough. Next time I'd double all the spices. Those looking for something sweet and cupcakey might want to try a different recipe.

Rating: 4
What a rich - delicious recipe. I followed a suggestion in the reviews and used whole wheat flour and oats. Next time I'll cut back on the butter and add additional pumpkin for more flavor.

After roasting pie pumpkins I purchased from the farmers market, I was eager to find a new pumpkin recipe. One of my pumpkins weighed approximately 11 ounces, which I suppose is 3/4 of a 16 ounce can. I took other suggestions and used whole wheat flour (1 cup) and more spices, especially cinnamon. I did not add the raw seeds as I am not a huge seed fan in bread products. I believe these muffins were better the following day. My 11 month old loved them fresh out of the oven though! Happy Baking!

Rating: 3
These are pretty good muffins. I followed other users in doubling the spices and added nutmeg as well. I also didn't have buttermilk on hand, so made some with vinegar and whole milk. I would definitely make these muffins again, but I think adding some toasted walnuts or currants would be nice additions. Sprinkling oats on top is also nice.

I followed the recipe using organic sodas, adding 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg, and using mini muffin tin. I will make these again soon. Highly recommend this recipe.

Addendum to my review, a cook from Burlington, ON Canada. I used 1 cup of each all purpose flour and whole wheat flour for this recipe.

Rating: 3
I was actually surprised, they are quite good. I used 1C of pumpkin puree and used 1/2C all purpose flour and 1/2C whole wheat flour. It's a good way of using up the left overs of the can of pumkin puree after having made a pumpkin pie. I will freeze them for when the kids come home from university, and make more for Christmas morning...

Wow. These are truly muffins and not cupcakes, as they can handle a pat of butter without being ridiculous... As did others, I substituted Greek yogurt for the buttermilk (honey flavored), and regarding the spices, I kept it the same with the exception of increasing the ginger to 1 tsp, adding 1/4 tsp of cardamom, and adding 1/8 tsp of nutmeg. I found the spices perfectly balanced. I omitted the pepitas, but combined 4 oz. sliced almonds with a 1/4c packed brown sugar, 3 tbsp of cold butter and 1/3c flour until crumbly, and put that atop the muffins while they baked. The topping really put these muffins over the top, I think! Nothing about them is too sweet -- they're a nice mild fall muffin to return to time and time again... :-)

Excellent! Easy enough for the kids to help, tasty enough for everyone to enjoy. We used this to welcome and say hello to October. We'll pull this out again next year for sure (or sooner)!

This is a good way to use up the bounty of squash this time of year. I cooked an acorn squash in the microwave, pureed the flesh in the food processor and used instead of pumpkin. I substituted a half-cup of halved, fresh cranberries for the raisins to give it a brighter flavor and used a quarter-teaspoon of garam masala instead of the allspice and cloves. Also sprinkled the tops with chunky sugar. A winner! I could definitely envision this with chocolate chips, too, for a more decadent version.

Rating: 3
Awesome! Read the previous reviews and made several changes based on others' recommendations. Used a little over 1 cup of pumpkin, 1-1/4 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup oats in lieu of 2 cups flour, doubled the allspice, used 1/4 tsp cardamom instead of cloves, and replaced raisins and pepitas with craisins and walnuts. Lastly, added approximately 1/8 tsp of orange extract (oil) as my own personal touch. The end result was awesome and my 2 and 5 year olds loved them too!

Great, lovely recipe. I'm lactose intolerant so I tried using 'lite' coconut milk with a little vinegar instead of the buttermilk and it turned out just fine! You couldn't taste the coconut at all. Moist, not too sweet. I actually used a mini muffin pan and made 24 mini muffins. I, also, didn't add the raisins or the pumpkin seeds.

Rating: 4
P.S. Forgot to add that I omitted the ginger and the raisins. My kids would not go for either. I would not add both the chocolate chips and the raisins, I feel like the tastes and textures compete unfavorably.

Rating: 4
This recipe turned out so delicious! These pumpkin muffins are incredibly moist, light and flavorful, not too spicy. I decreased the oven temp to 375 because I was using a dark metal pan and baked them for 17 minutes. I also added some semi-sweet chocolate chips to each muffin cup of batter (after I poured the batter into the muffin tins so they wouldn't sink to the bottom) which my children enjoyed.

I do not frequent the kitchen, I know where it is, but that's about it. I substituted milk and red wine vinegar for the buttermilk, and I happen to have the other ingredients on hand(I love pumpkin, even had the seeds). This turned out great. There was a time when I liked to make muffins snd always had to be careful of the the baking soda component, always seemed to heavy.(I live at sea level).no problem with this recipe. All of my ingredients except the milk, eggs, and butter,and flour were far, far from fresh...these turned out wonderful. I particularly liked them because they are not too sweet. I found them to be sufficiently spicy, some may prefer more ginger. I love ginger, but felt the muted ginger to be appropriate.

Rating: 3
I too played the use-what's-on-hand game for this one. Luckily it's a fairly flexible recipe. I followed other reviewer's advice and added extra pumpkin. I had some really great pumpkin puree left over from last Thanksgiving in my freezer, so I thawed that out and it came to about 2 cups. I doubled the spices like everyone else, and added I cup oats (about 1/4 less flour). Instead of raisins I added chopped candied ginger, but the raisins soaked in rum sounded great. Maybe next time! Also used plain greek yogurt instead of buttermilk because it was such a small amount. I can't seem to find buttermilk around here in anything smaller than a pint. I will try this one again following the recipe closer, but I'd also like to try some of the other suggestions of the reviewers. Sounds like a lot of people got good results.

This recipe did not have enough pumpkin flavor for me. I used 1 cup of Libby's canned pumpkin and my husband and I both agreed that it was not pumpkin-y enough for us.

Rating: 3
These were pretty good. The flavor was a bit subtle and I like spice so next time i would double up on at least the cinnamon. Otherwise they were really easy and the whole pan was devoured in about 20 minutes. Changes i made: omitted the raisins and pepitas (hate raisins, had no pepitas) and subbed in 1/4 c. canola oil for the butter.

These were the best pumpkin muffins I've ever made,very moist.I used vanilla yogurt in place of the buttermilk as I didnt have any.I already had pumpkin pie spice.I used a Tsp of that,1 Tsp.cinnamon and a dash of cardamom and allspice.I made them in a jumbo sized tin,took about 30 minutes to bake.

came out good, the kids really liked them! I used a mini muffin pan that made 23 muffins and cooked in only 15 minutes. some substitutions I made: used whole wheat flour, vegetable oil instead of butter used 2% greek yogurt instead of buttermilk (only b/c I didnt want to open the big carton we have for only the 1/4 cup needed) our 3 and 5 year old boys really liked these. I told them they were rasin bran muffins since the 5 year old thinks he doesnt like pumpkin! one thing I didnt like about it was my brown sugar was very hard, so I put it in the microwave w a wet papertowel to soften...guess I didnt soften it enough as there were still chunks in the batter; so when they baked they didnt taste that sweet, and the chunks dissolved in the muffins and made carmelized 'holes'...So I would make again but make sure I had softened brown sugar.

So I screwed this recipe up royally ... and it actually turned out pretty good! I completely forgot the buttermilk and butter. After about 5 minutes in the oven, I remembered the butter was still in the microwave cooling off! So I pulled the partially baked muffins out of the oven, and simply poured the melted butter on top of them and popped them back into the oven, hoping they would turn out okay. They were! A little dry, but I'm a dunker, so I didn't even notice the difference when enjoying them with my coffee. So if you are looking for a drier, a bit healthier version, follow my mistake - omit the buttermilk, and pour half the butter on the muffins while partially cooked.

Rating: 2
Easy to prepare. I added extra pumpkin as others suggested (1 whole can vs. 3/4 can) , but these turned out so dense, that they could be used as baseballs. I added extra on all the spices, and they were pretty tasty. Just needs work on the consistency.

Rating: 3
these were quite tasty with all the spices and pumpkin flavor. i substituted 1 cup of wheat flour, and 1/4 cup white sugar for better texture. also, i didn't have pumpkin seeds and used a handful of sunflower seeds which were perfect. presentation-wise, these are definitely a muffin recipe and not a cupcake.

Rating: 4
This is a great, simple recipe. To make it healthier, I used whole wheat pastry flour and the whole 15 oz can of pumpkin, which worked great (and still made 12 muffins). I needed them to be dairy-free, so I used canola oil instead of melted butter and soy milk with lemon juice instead of buttermilk. To make my kids happy, I left out the raisins and pepitas and added a streusel topping. The muffins were delicious! (You might think with all these changes that it's not the same recipe at all, but my point is just that because this is a great, simple recipe, you can play with it and the results will still be good.)

Rating: 3
Took others advice and added twice as much pumpkin & spices-- made for a nice, moist muffin. I also took someone's suggestion and soaked the raisins in rum beforehand: very nice touch. Overall, very yummy but still a bit lacking-- needs a kick of some kind.

Rating: 3
somewhat disappointed. Seems to be missing something, and also have a slightly bitter tone. Wish I'd listened to the reviewer who subbed oats for some of the flour, as they seem a little...uhm, flour-y. Added about 3/4 can of pumpkin, extra spices (no cloves), toasted the pepitas. Next time will only sprinkle the seeds on top as, even toasted, they loaned a strange texture. Next time may try evaporated milk instead of buttermilk. Threw in small handful of choc. chips after I tasted the batter, trying to add SOMETHING. Not giving up yet, will tweak a bit since pumpkin's so good for you. May try flax seeds in the batter next time.

Rating: 4
These smelled so good when I took them out of the oven that I couldn't wait to try them out - DELICIOUS! Based on some of the other reviews, I added about 3/4 of the can (1 1/2 C) of pumpkin, added some crystallized ginger chunks, and threw in a tiny bit more of each spice. I'm also not a fan of how creamily smooth some pumpkin items are, so I was happy people were recommending whole wheat flour. Unfortunately, I didn't have any, so I compromised with 1 1/4 C flour (to make up for additional pumpkin) and 1 C oats. The texture is fantastic, although I'd probably try to chop the ginger chunks even smaller.

Rating: 3
I doubled the pumpkin as others had suggested, substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and also doubled the spices. We loved these, though they were a little denser than some muffins, probably from the extra pumpkin. I've now made them twice in one week, definitely a keeper.

Loved the final product as did my three year old who helped make the batter. I toasted the pepitas and added tart dried cherries to half the mix. We will make again and try some of the other tricks for this treat!

I used baked butternut squash - about 1 c. I substituted mashed ripe banana for one of the eggs, which helped make these less Thanksgiving-y. Dried cranberries are a nice addition.

I finished my first patch of these pumpkin muffins and am very pleased. I didn't have ginger, allspice, or ground cloves, so I doubled the amount of cinnamon and added 1/8 teaspoon black pepper. I also omitted the raisins and pumpkin seeds and added a hand-full of chocolate chips as others have suggested doing. I topped them off with powdered sugar once they came out of the oven, and would make this recipe any day of the week.

My daughter was asking for pumpkin pie so I made these muffins. But I think my son liked them even more and he's not even crazy about pumpkin flavored things. I substituted 1/2 whole wheat flour and would use all whole wheat next time - because of the pumpkin and buttermilk there's no course texture from the wheat flour. I also omitted the seeds and raisins. I made the batter the night before and baked the first batch in the morning, they turned out extremely dense and moist - really great. I left the batter in the fridge and made some batches in the next couple days and turned out a little lighter/fluffier like a traditional muffin but I liked the first ones better. The batter is really almost more of a dough. Anyway, we give it a thumbs up!

Rating: 3
The final product tasted good, but my batter was very glutinous, which was not the consistency I expected. It resulted in a very rustic looking muffin, which was fine... I just wonder if that's what it's supposed to be like. At suggestion of other reviewers, I had even increased the amount of pumpkin - the batter would have been very dry if I hadn't. Despite only increasing the pumpkin, this recipe yielded more than 12 muffins. I used the balance for mini-muffins, and still had enough left over to top up the regular sized ones. I used pumpkin pie spice and made half the batch with golden raisins and half with dried cranberries.

Rating: 4
These muffins were excellent, great texture and spot-on subtle flavors. Not just for autumn :) Only change made by my husband: nix the ground ginger and instead add finely chopped candied ginger instead, about a 1/4 cup or so. Chopped a bit more to mix w/pepitas & sprinkle on top of the muffins before heading to the oven, and this was a winner! Should have gone ahead and made two batches, will do so today ('cause you're left with half a can of pumpkin anyways, and trust me, these will go fast)...

Loved this super easy recipe so much I made it twice in a week. I made it as written except for taking the advice of earlier reviewers who suggested doubling the pumpkin (I used nearly 3/4 of a can...maybe 1 cup+?) and almost doubled the spices.... it made it really moist and super flavorful without being overwhelming. I too toasted the pumpkin seeds, and thought that added a nice touch. Enjoy!

Very good muffin. I sprinkled demerara (raw cane sugar) on top before I baked them for a little crunch. I toasted the pepitas also for extra flavor and was generous with the spices. They were moist and flavorful. A keeper.

Sweet potato substitutes for pumpkin as well (again, to avoid that half can of pumpkin going to waste--though a little pumpkin in your weekend pancakes is wonderful). I like a little less sugar and a little maple syrup instead. I took these to my sons class for snack and they were a huge hit with kids and teachers.

Rating: 4
I doubled the recipe so that I didn't have a 1/2 can of pumpkin going to waste. I didn't have ground cloves but added nutmeg instead and used butterscotch chips instead of raisins. I made giant muffins; 14 for the double batch. I baked them for 28 minutes but started checking them at 20. These muffins came out great. Moist and flavorful.

Rating: 3
These are quite good. I recommend increasing the amounts of pumpkin and spices slightly for those that prefer stronger flavours, as they are quite subtle. I don't know how much butter is '1 stick' (our butter isn't sold like that as in the US) but I used 1/2 c and that seemed plenty. To the reviewer below, I think squash would work just fine. Also recommend adding a dollop of ricotta on top of the dough before cooking for a tasty variation.

Rating: 3
I thought this recipe was really good but thought 2 changes would make them better: Grind or chop the pumpkin seeds a little before adding them. This would give them a little more texture instead of having big whole pumpkin seeds in there. Also, I think this recipe would be better made with some whole-grain flour, like if you substituted whole wheat flour for 1/2 the white flour. To answer question below, I think squash would work fine in this recipe.

We made this with extra pumkin we had cooked down to make pies with. We didn't have buttermilk, so we used soured milk, and we didn't have shelled pumpkin seeds, so we used dark chocolate chips and a few walnuts. Next time we will soak the raisins in some rum maybe? Very good!

Not having buttermilk on hand and with no other use for it, I used sour milk. Just add a tablespoon of vinegar to whole milk and wait until it curdles. It's a great substitute for buttermilk. And now that walnuts are known to be good for women, I added a handful of those chopped well. Yum!

Changes ahoy! I was all set to make these muffins, and then I realized that I did not actually own a can of pure pumpkin. I did have a dusty can of pumpkin pie mix (the kind you add condensed milk to for instant pie), and I decided to go for broke and use it instead. Skipped the spices and the sugar, used a cup and a half of the pie mix. The result was surprisingly awesome; if you have a can of pie mix hanging around, this is a great way to use it up.

I made a few changes given what I had - whole milk instead of buttermilk; a handful of chocolate chips since my son was making them with me; about 1/4 c. of ground flax; and ommitted the pepitas. Next time I will try them with more pumpkin and cut down on the butter a bit.

Wonderful muffins - perfect spicing and excellent texture. Just follow recipe as written. I recommend Trader Joe's Organic canned pumpkin, it's fantastic, not watery at all. I'll make these again and often. Exactly right baking time too.
