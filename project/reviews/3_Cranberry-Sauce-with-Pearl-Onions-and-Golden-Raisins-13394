Like the previous reviewer said, the recipe is a little difficult but kind of fun to make anyway as I have never melted sugar before. Mixed reviews from the family - my mom loved it and I thought it was just OK. I think maybe the pearl onions I bought were too large. People eating it weren't sure whether to eat them whole or cut them up. It's probably best to use the smallest onions you can find.

This sauce was very good, but a little fussy -- making the caramel was a bit of a challenge, and it's easy to burn yourself on the hot sugar. I wonder if this step is really necessary? most recipes simply combine the sugar, water, & cranberries and cook.

I have been making this recipe for the past 13 years. Still have the original Gourmet magazine,but the recipe was missing. Thank Goodness for the internet.
