The pears were wonderful! Skipped the puff pastry for my gluten free friends. Rave reviews all around.

If you can't find ripe pears, try cutting the pears into thin slices before caramelizing them. I then layered the pear slices over the tart. Also, I suggest infusing the whipping cream with the ground cardamom for an hour or so, before whipping the cream. It gives it a much deeper flavor. Wonderful dessert, quick and easy, my guests were very pleased!
