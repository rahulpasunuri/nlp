The marinade was tasty albeit very salty. I used 2 tablespoons low sodium soy and one teaspoon of kosher salt, added 1/4 teaspoon chili powder and 1/4 teaspoon paprika and it was too salty to repeat again. I will probably keep the chili powder and paprika and reduce the salt further to 1/2 teaspoon and also reduce the soy to 1 tablespoon the next time around. I served the kebabs with the Rice Salad May 2008 recipe. The salad helped offset the saltiness of the kebabs.

I'm not crazy about cumin but this recipe was fantastic. I cut my meat a little too thin but it was still tender and tasty!

This was surprisingly delicious. I took a shortcut and skewered the onion with the beef and skipped the zucchini but only because I didn't have it on hand. This is my new goto recipe for kebabs. Will definitely be making this again.

To the Cook who asked what the kebabs are sitting on in the photo, it looks like Quinoa.

Does anyone know what the kebobs are sitting on in the picture?

A very tender and tasty marinade. I make this several times a month. Tastes great with roasted tomatoes and red peppers as well.

Good stuff, this. Since it is a relatively light marinade against large pieces of meat, the cut makes all the difference. I made it with the YELLOW RICE WITH SOFRITO from this site and drank a wine made from tannat grapes from the Southwest of France. A killer match.

Add some paprika and chili powder (and reduce the salt) and you've got yourself a four forker - as it is, it only rates three.

I used 1/2 tamari soy sauce and 1/2 regular soy sauce to cut down on the salty flavor. it was fantastic. Use good quality beef for this one!!! Definitely make this again.

Great recipie...even though I overcooked the beef on the grill. It came out just a little too well done for me. I did not use the salt in the marinade and i grilled the zucchini with Greek spices. Great!

I liked the flavours but like some others just found the marinade to be too salty. The next time I make it, I will cut down on the soy sauce.

As another cook suggested, I used chicken breast instead of the beef tenderloin roast. The chicken was very good. I thought the marinade was too salty and ended up pouring the excess off and swishing the chicken with the remaining marinade and some white wine. When I made the recipe again, I'll omit the salt in the marinade. The soy sauce is salty enough. Served with a Caribbean-style brown rice, this dish was quite enjoyable.

Supurb. Really liked this one as is. Simple and delicious. I used Korean Soy sauce (it is a little different from Japanese or Chinese) and it came out great

This will be my marinade of choice whenever I'm craving grilled beef kebabs. Simple and great. I'm going to try it on chicken very soon... maybe tomorrow, because it was that good.

Wonderful. Made a double batch for my brother-in-law's pot luck wedding reception - it was wiped out. To make it simpler, I threaded chunks of the veggies on the same skewers with the meat.

To the cook from Cajamarca. Sorry everyone, this isn't regarding this recipe. But in Cajamarca, they serve a soup that is beyond belief, with a big chile sitting in the middle. It's been so many years, I can't even remember the other ingredients (I wasn't a cook then), but my, it was good. Do you know it? millcreek@sisqtel.net

To the cook in Chicago: I have been in Peru as a Peace Corps volunteer for 9 months. Lima has the biggest Asian population and Chinatown of any city in Latin America. In Peruvian cities, Chinese restaurants can be found on every other block, and the use of soy sauce is very common. Of course, to make this recipe more authentic, it would have to call for cow hearts (anticucho), a real national favorite.

I have made this dish over and over. Tastes better with chicken.

While I question the use of soy sauce in a Peruvian-style recipe, I thought these kabobs were very tasty. The butcher at my local grocery store did not have beef tenderloin so I used top sirloin. That was a mistake - a little tough. Next time I will go to the big meat market and get the tenderloin.

Wow, this meat is so awesome! The vegetables are great as well. Would definitely make this again.

Really good and easy, and perfect for summer entertaining. My guests are always delighted by grilled vegetables--they always wish they'd thought of it themselves.

This was easy, and very tasty--fajita-like in flavor. I just did regular kebabs on the grill with bell pepper, onion and cherry tomatoes. Will definitely do again with chicken, too, but will cut back on the salt.

This is a great,easy recipe to make for company and though expensive, the filet works very well with it- I also increased the amount of marinade and added sweet grape(cherry)tomatoes to the kebabs which were delicious! Be careful not to overcook -

Super dish - I've made it several times now - and consider it a sure hit - though I let the meat sit in the marinade too long one time, and the citris effect was too strong. I usually just quarter the onion and pull the segments apart - then put the onions on the skewers with the meat.

I had trimmed a whole filet and used the trimmings for this recipe. I am always trying new recipes for my family and this one was a hit. One of my sons is an extremely picky eater and this is now his new favorite! The only thing that i changed in the recipe is doubleing the marinade.

I very seldom give 4 forks. I panicked when I couldn't find the recipe and forgot the name to look it up on epicurious. In the middle of the night "Peruvian" came to me. I think I need help...........................

This is my kind of recipe: dead easy and delicious. The butcher raised an eye-brow when I told him that I was using tenderloin for kebobs, so I'm going to take him the recipe and let him try it out himself!

I prepared these kebabs for a BBQ party we had at my house last week (and ate frozen leftovers at another party just yesterday), and I did not get anything but compliments to this recipe. It was definitely a hit among my invitees.

This is a very nice, simple recipe. We enjoyed it the first time but reduced the cumin the second time and enjoyed it more. Included pork in addition to the beef and both were great! The taste of grilled onion is perfect with the meat and grilled squash is always good!

So yummy!!! The flavor was powerful yet subtle at the same time, and red onions complement the spiciness with sweetness. I also brushed the zucchini with worchester sauce for the heck of it. Very good grilling recipe!

I made this dish last night and we were blown away! I thought the cumin and lime made the marinade! I added bell peppers and some mushrooms to the grille, and it was really tasty! It's a wonderful, easy dish (but do go easy on the salt, I just added 1 tsp sea salt and that was too much!)that lends itself well to backyard barbeques. The hit dish of the summer(and almost no cleanup, if you marinate the meat in a ziplock bag!)

This dish was a hit!! The veggies were great and my picky fiancé LOVED the marinade. I will add this one to my repertoire, as it is quite easy to make.

I hate soy sauce, but there are options. And I like to replace the zucchini with bell pepper, and sometimes, add some mushrooms (I love mushrooms)

I had mixed results with this recipe -- the vegetables were good but the meat was disappointing. The cumin flavor on the meat was very stong. Like the previous reviewer, I found the recipe very salty --ok on the vegetables but not on the meat. With such a good cut of meat, I didn't think that the marinade did it justice. I would not make it again. Sorry.

Well, I said the heck with doing the veggies & meat all seperately - I put all the veggies & the mean on the skewer at the same time. Grilled them outside for about 15 mins. (turned a few times). I sprayed them with non-fat garlic flavored spray. They were delicious. My kids weren't big on them but my husband and I loved them, couldn't stop eating them!!!

I made this and the kebobs were very good, although I was thirsty all night afterwards. The meat was tender and the grilled veggies were excellent with it. This was a real keeper!

I've made this twice already and a big hit both times. Second time added a teaspoon of sesame oil and some hot sauce to the marinade. Delicious!!
