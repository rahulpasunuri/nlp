I have made this twice, and the bowls were scraped clean each time. Our little local store is really just good for beer and bags of chips, but they have what I need to pull off this delicious dessert. I make it early in the day, then remove from the freezer to the countertop before serving as I whip the cream for topping. Perfect! Even made a half batch using 2 eggs, worked fine too.

These were really rich, with intense mocha flavor! A little hard if served directly from freezer--let stand out a minute or two before serving.

I thought this was good--my husband really liked it, though. When I made this, we wanted it quickly so we ate it before it fully froze. I thought it was just OK. When I had it later when it was frozen, I thought it was much better. Definitely take the time to freeze it!

This is the best Parfait I've had. Easy to make. I place in freezer till the next day and the texture was perfect.
