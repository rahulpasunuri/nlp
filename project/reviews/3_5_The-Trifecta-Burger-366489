This stuck together well, but was pretty bitter. I don't know why. My husband wasn't able to eat it. I used homemade broth, mayonnaise, and Sriracha. My tofu had herbs in it. It needed some salt.

My husband has only been a vegetarian for 5 days now :) but he LOVED this recipe. This is a great recipe to try even if you're not vegan/vegetarian. It was so yummy and definitely packed with protein. We did fry it as suggested, and I think it helped with the texture. We really enjoyed this burger and will probably make it again... and again.

While I was visiting, my sister made these for me as I am a vegan. She did not have any TVP, so used quinoa instead. They were AMAZING! I am definitely going to make these at home. Thanks Patty!

This was great. We are not a vegetarian family but everyone enjoyed these and we'll make them again. I cut back on the Sriracha sauce (1 tbsp) and that was just right for us.

I enjoyed this recipe. Baking them for 15 minutes on each side gives them a crispy exterior and the consistency is perfect. I made sliders out of them. I used wheat dinner rolls, wasabi coleslaw, and more sriracha on top. If you're new to tofu, don't forget to press the water out of it before you start cooking. The other ingredients add enough moisture.

Er, no I would not make these again. Terrible.
