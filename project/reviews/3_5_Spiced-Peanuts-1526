I made these with raw peanuts. I didn't see whey they should be dry- roasted alread if I'm going to bake them. I also left out the curry. The flavor is really good. With olive oil as a binder your fingertips will get messy with the flavoring. It's not a big deal but I may try to see how it turns out with an egg-white

Yummy! Nice twist on spiced nuts. These definitely dress up dry roasted peanuts. They taste better next day. Make sure you drain on paper towels as they do give off some oil and color.

Not bad, but we did not find it to be an improvement on salted dry roasted peanuts.

These are fantastic WITHOUT the curry, that just confuses the taste. I put these in my Christmas food gifts every year and get rave reviews.

I doubled this recipe and added almonds for a nice mix - we had only a handful left after our party. I'm sure that other nuts would be very good but can't try due to allergies. Due to the wonderful reception they received, I plan on making these as Christmas gifts. Try them at a cocktail party, great with drinks.

Curry isn't as popular in Manila as it is in Madras (or even in Manhattan, come to think of it), but this snack sure made an impression on my guests.

Addictive little buggers! I made this recipe with Nucoa instead of olive oil . They're not "hot" spicy with only 1/4 tsp of cayenne. If you want more heat, increase to 1/2 tsp. Great party food!

Maybe my taste buds were a little out of wack but I wasn't impressed with these peanuts. They did taste better two days later, but 4 forks they weren't. The spicy pecans (Dec. xmas edition) were much better.

I needed a snack recipe for the Holidays and thought this would do nicely. I tried it today so as not to be surprised on Christmas Day. Wow, it is marvelous. A great combo of spices.

I made this with almonds instead of peanuts and gave it out to friends and neighbors for Holiday gifts three years ago and am still receiving requests for the receipe. I will be giving these nuts again this year.
