Purchased tapenade? Are you kidding me?

Loved making this dish. Super simple and easy to follow instructions. The perfect summer food while sitting outside. The flavors went well together and I was surprised at how flavorful the Mahi Mahi was.

Really enjoyed this dish. The mahi is perfect for grilling as it holds up perfectly and doesn't flake apart (i used onions to hold the fish in place).

This is a terrific recipe! Super simple and super quick. The only thing I changed was to grill the fish rather than broil it - hey, it is summer! Everything else I did exactly as written. Its been a long time since my kids fought of the leftovers!

We made this tonight and enjoyed it. I used Halibut because Mahi-Mahi was not available. I also added onions and tomatoes to the skewers, just to add vegetables to our meal. The tapenade mixture was very yummy and could be put on anything. We did not add the pico de gallo to the couscous this time, but I think I will next time - just to see if we like it better.
