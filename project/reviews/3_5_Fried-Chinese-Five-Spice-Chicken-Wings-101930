Someone asked what sauce to dip these in... I like an Orange Marmalade Sauce. Sorry for the formatting, I don't know how to force breaks in the lines. Ingredients: 1 teaspoon cornstarch 1 Tablespoon cold water 1/3 cup orange marmalade 1 clove garlic, finely minced 1/8 teaspoon grated ginger 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes 1/4 cup lime juice 1/4 cup soy sauce Preparation: Whisk together cornstarch and cold water. Set aside. Place orange marmalade, garlic, ginger, pepper flakes, lime juice, and soy sauce in a small heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Add cornstarch and simmer, stirring, until sauce is thickened. Remove from heat.

I really enjoyed this recipe... sure it was a little messy, dealing with the cornstarch, but overall just like they make at the restaurant. I really don't get why people change the recipe and rate or comment on that change, it's NOT THE SAME THING. Please stop doing it or write your own recipe then. It makes it so hard to filter through your edited review. @mharden3982 you reduce the oven temperature to 250 so after you finish frying a batch of chicken, you can place them in the oven to keep warm. (It was worded a little weird.) :)

These were delicious! Just one suggestion... Instead of the sherry and sugar, I used about 1/4 cup of coca cola in the marinade reminiscent of the 5-spice wings my mom made when I was younger. It added sweetness and moisture.

What does Reduce temperature to 250°F mean? At this point the wings are ready to be fried. Is this a mistake?

These are good, flavorful wings but they took a lot of work and made a pretty big mess. I won't make these again.

These were delicious. We grilled them to cut back on fat. We also used charcoal that had mesquite chips in it. That may have changed or added something to the flavor, but if it did I strongly recommend giving it a try.

A bit messy to make but very crispy and juicy.

Once you resign yourself to the time it takes to produce (almost four hours), the flavours are definitely worth it. Follow the suggestions of previous reviewers and let it marinate overnight, tossing occasionally - a more efficient use of your time. I also strained the fat out of the marinade after the hour in the oven and tossed it (the fat, that is), reheating the marinade on the stove and thickening it with a little Wondra flour in cold water. It made a perfect dip for the winglets. Be aware that if you use a deep fryer, this will be the last use you make of that particular batch of oil, because of the cornstarch residue - it will lower the temperature of the oil and burn more easily on subsequent batches. I got two or three recipes' worth of these delicious wings from my oil before I replaced it.

Very tasty. I have made this dish a couple of times for different barbecue parties. I marinated the wings overnight, however, barbecued the wings along with the rest of the meat instead of frying in oil. This certainly cut down the grease. Everybody loved them.

Good taste. Good texture from dredging in cornstarch prior to frying. A little dry though - any suggestions for a sauce to serve it with?

A great departure from my usual (southern fried) chicken. They were just so flavorful!! These easily rival the wings I've had at my favorite Chinese resturaunt.

These were to put it simply, "terrible". First off the recipe reads 1 1/2 piece peeled ginger root. Exactly how much is that, one tsp, two, more? I added 2 tsps and it was way too much. I then read the review about them being too dry and added as they did more soy sauce and sherry. Def it needs more as they were dry. Finally, dredging them in cornstarch, then deep frying. I almost puked! It's a good thing I tested these before I made them for company..Oh yeah, one whole onion. Way too much.!!

I added the honey as well, and my boyfriend loved it! We've added this to the list of dishes he can prepare. This is a great dish when you don't have much time to prepare or watch over it.

Mmmm... this turned out really good, just like the ones I grew up with in Hong Kong. The salt and pepper for dipping would be even better if you stirfry it in a small wok with just a dash of peanut / sesame oil.

These were great, just like the ones at chinese cafes. We also use the same method for thinly sliced pork chops. I dont understand why people are questioning the salt and pepper that is to be used for dipping, the restaurants we go to always serve extra salt and pepper on the side with lemon. We call it spicy salt. It's excellent to dip in.

I was getting tired of the same ol' Buffalo chicken wings, so I thought this recipe would be a nice change; it was a winning change. I added some sesame chili oil to the marinade for added kick. I'm not partial to the wing drummettes one finds in the supermarket as they tend to be pretty slim pickins'. Instead I bought some whole wings and cut them in half, discarding the tip. Takes a little more time, but the bird is infintely better this way. Salt and Pepper for dipping? I don't get it. Reserve the marinade, reheat, strain and pour over.

Wow! Very good - these were a big hit. I added 1/4 cup each soy sauce and sherry to the marinade (otherwise it would have been very dry), and marinated the wings for almost 8 hours in the fridge - just more convenient to do it while I was at work. They came out superb. I have never used corn starch to dredge chicken before, but was very pleased with the results (and I skipped serving the wings with the bowl of salt and pepper(?)). Will definitely make these again.

I enjoyed it very much, however, it might be improved if an explanation of "1, tablespoons medium-dry Sherry" were included. Thanks.
