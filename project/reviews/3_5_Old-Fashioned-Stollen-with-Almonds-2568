I make another stollen recipe almost identicle to this one {which is why I didn't rate this recipe} --Just want to let you all know that Stollen FREEZES AND KEEPS VERY WELL! I make extras during the holidays to give away & keep for later. Just wrap them a couple times in plastic wrap then wrap them in foil, then put into a good quality thick zip lock bag & squeeze the air out of the bag & freeze. All these wrappings will keep them from drying out and prevent them from getting freezer burn taste. These will last a couple months in the freezer! After you defrost them, just re-dust generously with confectioners sugar & they will look and taste great!

this is an excellent recipe for stollen. I have made a couple of my own revisions...I use diced candied ginger(enhanced by the cardamon), oranges, and dried cranberries instead of the usual candied fruits...you can probably use any dried fruit combo that tastes good together.this recipe makes 2 humongous loaves but i split it into 4 instead of 2 and freeze it to give as hostess gifts at the holidays.

A friend and I tried this recipe the day after Thanksgiving and were very pleased. However, we both agreed that the stollen from Black Cat Bakery in Missoula, MT is far and away light years ahead of this one. In fact, it's better than any stollen either of us has ever had anywhere! The cook from Missoula who told you about Black Cat in her review last year is spot on in her recommendation. This recipe does take some effort and, knowing that it doesn't compare with Black Cat's, we won't be making stollen again.

I have yet to make this Stollen but I have had the best Stollen I have ever had from the Black Cat Bakery in Missoula, MT. Saddly they do not have a store front but I order it during the Christmas Holidays. They will ship it anywhere! If anyone is interested in getting one you can contact them at blackcat@bigsky.net or call them @ 406-542-9043

I absolutely love stollen, and this recipe hits the mark. Agree with the addition of rum and marzipan. With regards to sugar, I just bought stollen at a christmas market in Monschau, Germany that was indeed rolled in granulated sugar, which I prefer. As a side note, it was also cooked in small bite size pieces, which was nice. I will try that with this recipe next time.

If you are looking for a German stollen, this isn't it. This is more a Scandinavian version. I grew up in a household the was half German half Swedish, and this recipe comes close to what my Swedish grandmother used to make (and which my German father wouldn't eat :=) )

I like the proportion of sugar and butter to flour in this recipe, nice and sweet. I grew up with homemade German stollen and we never had cardamom in it.I love cardamom but can't imagine it here. The brandy suggestions are good, as is the addition of marzipan. I personally use homemade almond paste, from an excellent recipe in the 1970 Joy of Cooking - a must- have addition to a must-have Christmas treat.

There is a far superior recipe on the Christmas Magazine, http://www.christmasmagazine.com/en/entertaining/recipe12.asp

I haven't tried this recipe yet but I'm skeptical, as the recipe states it can be made one day in advance, whereas traditional stollen is meant to be made days in advance and to keep well throughout the Christmas season.

Need to have the Bon Appetit staff do an update of this recipe and have Bakery Chefs comment on how to tweek the recipe for home use. The C.I.A.cookbook lists the recipe for hotel use and HUMONGOUS ovens that do not lend a hand for the baker at home.

Thank you sooooo much! Each year (for the past 10years) I make stollen for my Dad using a recipe given to me by his mother. In a recent move I misplaced a cookbook filled with family favorites, including my stollen recipe. This is the closest I have come to duplicating my grandmothers recipe. I too added 1/3 cup rum (plus some for the cook!) and soaked my raisins in rum as well, also added the marzipan. Once baked I brushed it with butter and rolled it in a combination of granulated and powdered sugar...excellent!

First, I have to say that my house smells incredible! Second, this takes waaaay too long to make! Third, thank you to all the reviews that made me decide to add rum and martzipan. I was able to get three loaves out of this one batch. My oven cooks fast, so I never heed the times for cooking, but essentially tell by smell when something is done. The bread cooked for about 45 minutes, was golden brown, and moist and chewy on the inside, just like the Stollen we used to get as kids. I brushed the outside with melted butter and spinkled confectioners sugar on the top. They are gorgeous..I'm giving the smaller loaves away to guests at Christmas Eve and keeping the big loaf for us for Christmas morning

I am about to try this recipe with the addition of the rum and marzipan, though I like stollen with the marzipan distributed evenly rather than in a rope down the middle. I just want to point out two things: One, that stollen is never rolled in granulated sugar, only confectioner's sugar. And secondly, stollen is not supposed to be a moist bread. We don't have an equivalent here - it's both dry and rich, with the high butter and egg content - almost like a cookie. The dryness is partly why it keeps so long - mold doesn't have enough moisture to grow.

My mother came from Germany and we have a long tradition through generations of Stollen baking for Christmas. This Stollen was good but lacking. Real German Stollen is flavored not only with almonds, but also with rum; sometimes filled with marzipan, and always brushed with melted butter while piping hot and rolled in lots of granulated sugar. Also, Stollen is the only yeast bread I know of which should be aged at least a week - tightly wrapped and stored in the refrigerator. It is not best when fresh from the oven. As a basic recipe this is good; but I would add 1/3 cup of dark rum to the liquid and put a rope of marzipan down the middle of the dough before folding it (sealing it inside).

I added brandy but didn't have any marzipan, which I'm sure would have been a nice addition. I completely agree with the previous review-- the stollen came out very dry and the bottom was too browned. The flavor was great, but considering how much work it is to make I was disappointed when it overcooked. I would make it again but bake it at a different temperature.

I have searched HIGH & LOW for this recipe that my mother never made. Growing up in central PA, Mom always bought what the local Weis Market had in their bakery dept. I personally found the other reviewers notes for this recipe to be quite helpful and especially loved the woman who commented on the "traditional" German Stollen. I used her tips and found great results with the addition of Myers's Dark Rum and the Marzipan. Plus the aging of the stollen loaves for about a week wrapped tightly in "restaurant grade" food wrap. I made 4 loaves of Stollen this year ('02) and with each batch, my loaves were extremely browned on the bottom. I kept the oven temp as directed plus using the lower third of the oven, but thought the loaves to be too dried out. Tasted great, no burnt taste, but too dry. Comments please. I live at 1,400 feet now in PA, definitely not hi-altitude baking as it was when living in Georgetown, CO during the 1990's.

I took the advice of the WA cook. I added 1/3 cup brandy (don't like rum)and the rope of marzipan, and also brushed the tops with butter and granulated sugar. I fooled around with the fruit/nut amounts to fit my own tastes, decreasing the raisins (golden) and increasing slightly the almonds and candied fruit. I think it's the best stollen I've eaten due to adjustments to this basic recipe.
