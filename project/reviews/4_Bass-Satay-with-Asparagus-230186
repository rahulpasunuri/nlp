The work is the day before and the broiling part is fast and fun to watch so this is a great dinner party entree. Served over sushi rice it makes for a good filling meal. I made it for a dinner party for 8 which included a restaurant chef who was blown away.

This is essentially the same recipe as the Miso Glazed Sea Bass on this site. This was fantastic although I used cod and boy did it fall apart! Would have been better to leave filets whole. Also-the marinade is enough for 4-5 pounds of fish which is how much I made (personal chef)

This is a fine dish if using black cod from Alaska - a wonderful substitute for Chilean seabass. Chilean seabass has generally high levels of mercury (and is subject to a Federal warning), is nearing commercial extinction (and is therefore generally very expensive), and is often illegally poached. You can support sustainable fishery management by choosing an alternative, and still make an extraordinary dinner! Look up "Take a Pass on Chilean Sea Bass."

Great flavor and very easy to prepare. If you don't like your food on the sweet side, you may want to cut the amount of sugar called for in the recipe. Even though this is a pretty sweet dish, I really enjoyed it. I also think you can cut the marinade ingredients to at least half the amount called for in the recipe (especially if you're only using 4 oz of fish). I used a pound of sea bass and there was still more than enough marinade.

Excellent! I could not find the Mirin, so I substituted a white plum wine with caramel. I marinated 1 lb of Chilean Sea Bass and made this as an entree. My guests loved it!!!
