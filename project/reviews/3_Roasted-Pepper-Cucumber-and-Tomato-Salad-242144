I really liked this recipe. Fresh and flavorful! I took the advice of "milong11" and used 3 Tablespoons olive oil. I didn't want to give up all the lemon juice, though, so I used 2 T. red wine vinegar and 1 T. lemon juice. I also substituted cilantro for parsley. I'd definitely make again.

No garlic? hmm.

I make this all the time. However, mine is a little different. I use Red Bell Peppers not only for color but to sweeten the taste. I broil till slightly chared, cool and peel the skin off. Then follow the recipe. The other thing I do is replace PArsley with Cilantro, again for flavor. Reduce the Olive Oil to 3 tablespoons and then replace the Lemon Juice with Red Wine Vinegar. Let sit overnight mix occasionally and serve. It is the best, more Spanish like my mom makes but with my twist.

I did add salt and pepper to my dressing, and I added a yellow pepper as well for color. I took it on a picnic with 7 adults and everyone enjoyed it.

By another name this is a Greek salad without the feta and with a simple lemon juice dressing instead of red vinegar. Perhaps an over-simplified recipe -- not even salt or pepper recommended. The outcome reflects the simplicity -- nothing memorable. In fact, basically forgettable.

This is really nice with good quality fresh vegetables. (I also tried some with harissa as suggested by the previous reviewer and it is excellent. It does, however, completely change the dish - it gives depth but takes away the bright, refreshing quality.) It was a perfect side for a chicken tajine.

The only thing I did to change this is that I used an ordinary cucumber...added a little celery...and a little Harissa. My husband loved it!
