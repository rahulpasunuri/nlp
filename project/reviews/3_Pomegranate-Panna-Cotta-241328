Had I used the right ingredients I would have given this four forks. Despite me using light cream, fat free buttermilk and pomegranate juice with 'natural flavors', my husband and I very much enjoyed this dessert. Like other reviewers mine had a slight gray/purple hue, and because of the dairy I used it didn't set as firmly as would have wanted out of a panna cotta. The flavor was excellent with a lovely combination of tanginess and richness. I will definitely attempt this recipe again...correctly!

This was delicious. I'm a bit of a panna cotta snob and this was one of the best I've ever had. I also followed the recipe very closely (I had never prepared panna cotta before) and it turned out beautifully.

This recipe was a treat to make and eat. This panna cotta is very tart and I liked the tartness compared to many of the sweet desserts I have tasted, because sometimes sweetness is just too much. Although this recipe isn't probably for everyone and I think that it depends on your likeness of dessert and whether you like them sweet or tart.

Awesome! A light and refreshing dessert. I made it exactly according to recipe. For those who don't read the recipe right through before beginning, a note: do not discard the orange peel - it is used for garnish.

One of the best deserts I have ever made or eaten. The tang of the buttermilk and the tartness of the pomegranate combine with the creamy sweet custard. Really a beautiful desert.

Not sure what went wrong here, but like many other reviewers, this turned grayish-purple. It also separated into a grainy top cream layer and bottom jellowy layer and never really set up. The taste was fantastic! but the texture and appearance made this particularly unedible.

Nope. WAY too tangy for my taste, and I even used all heavy cream instead of any buttermilk. AND I took the leftovers and added some whipped white chocolate cream to those, figuring that would mellow it somewhat, and it was STILL too tangy. Plus, the color was really disappointing; I had been expecting a gorgeous vermilion color, and instead it was an unappetizing purplish-brown. The only reason I gave it a rating of two forks is for uniqueness, and because I think the recipe could still be rescued with other ways of mellowing it.

OMG, is this good. The recipe is a keeper and a crowd pleaser. A delightful, yet light, ending to any meal.

Tried it again with cream not buttermilk. It was OK, but a traditional panna cotta with a fruit sauce is a better use of the ingredients. I won't make this again.

This is a delightful recipe. I don't know how people got a grey yogurt out of it. It was definitely sort of a pale, bubblegum pink for me and a nice contast to the blood red pomegranate syrup. I followed the recipe closely, used a 15.2 oz bottle of POM 100% juice and a packet of knox gelatin. The juice made a scant 2 cups after the 3 tblsp. was removed but it was pretty close. I also measured the reduction because I've ruined recipes in the past by messing up the liquid amounts. Of the final product, the consistancy was suprisingly light, definitely tart- sweet but the pomegranate taste overwhelmed the orange and the buttermilk flavors. I think people must be using some mixed or watered down juices to get the results mentioned here. I also think 4 hours is too little time for gelling. 5 or 6 worked for me, overnight would be best. The candied orange peel is a great garnish! I used the peeler on my lemon zester and got attractive, thin strips.

I was not impressed by this panna cotta. Instead of the bright pink color shown in the picture, it actually turns an unattractive gray/pinkish color. Not very appealing. Also, the sauce was too tart and completely overpowered the creaminess of the panna cotta.

not nearly as good as it looks - difficult to get to set like other panna cottas - tastes and looks like generic store bought yogurt

I really didn't like this recipe - cloyingly sweet and sharp all at once.

I was unimpressed too! I actually tried it twice, b/c I thought I did something wrong the first time. The second time was better, but the color was a little dingy and the taste too bitter. Also, I found this recipe more labor intensive that most other panna cotta recipes.

I was unimpressed with this version of panna cotta and prefer others I have made in the past. I followed the recipe as written but the result was a light coffee colour and the flavour was not rich & creamy like other panna cottas (likely due to the buttermilk). I do not know for sure but suspect the colour difference may have something to do with the type of pomagranate juice used. I used 100% pomagranate juice and possibly this base is just too acidic for the addition of whipping cream (mine seemed to want to curdle when I added the cream). I'm curious whether other cooks have used 100% pomagranate juice or a pomagranate juice blend for their's. I doubt I'll make this again.

i was so excited to make this when i saw the picture. it was my first panna cotta and i loved it! beautiful pink- purple color, smooth texture and the buttermilk tang with the sweet syrup was perfect. the georgia reviewer is SO wrong! i just followed the recipe as written - how they got grey/beige colored yogurt is incomprehensible. give this recipe a try. an elegant, easy dessert for entertaining. i'm delighted to add it to my repertoire.

I made this yesterday and thought it was pretty good. The color was pretty close to the picture - maybe a bit darker. I thought the flavor was great - the buttermilk is definitely there, but it goes well with the super- sweet syrup and I thought the two balanced quite nicely. The one problem I had was the time stated in the recipe for reducing the syrup - it took closer to 20 minutes rather than 10. Otherwise, I thought it was easy, pretty on the plate, and everyone loved the flavor.

The color was ok, but no one at my house would eat it because the buttermilk was the overwhelming flavor. Maybe next time I'll try it with whole milk.

This has the flavor and consistency of fruit yogurt -- pleasant, but nothing remarkable and not worth the trouble. The color is an unappetizing grey/beige, not the pink shown in the photograph.
