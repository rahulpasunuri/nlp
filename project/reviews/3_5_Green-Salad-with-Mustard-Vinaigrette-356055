I added thinly sliced onions and cut the vegetable oil (I used grapeseed) in half. Served it as a starter to my Thanksgiving guests who said that it was a salad perfected!

This was a light and flavorful vinaigrette dressing. Very simple and doesn't upstage the other meal items.

This simple vinaigrette is a standard dressing at our house. I substitute a good dollop of honey for the sugar and cut down on the oil a bit. Canola oil works very well.

This dressing is simple yet has great flavor - we made it with the onion pie and both were a hit at the turkey day gathering. the simpler the better and this hits the spot. Try it and you will make it again maybe for other salads!
