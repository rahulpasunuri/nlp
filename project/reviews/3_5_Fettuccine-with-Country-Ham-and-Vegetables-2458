Yum - You can't got wrong with cream and cheese! Used what I had on hand - onion, mushroom, pepper, ham. Thanks to the other reviewers who suggested substituting chicken broth/corn starch to make it a bit less artery clogging!

Great way to use leftover ham! I used onion instead of leeks, broccoli, and cubed sweet potatoes. Replaced the veg. oil with 1 tsp olive oil and 1T butter. Replaced the cream with 2% milk and made a corn starch/ milk slurry to thicken it up. This one is going in my repitoire.

Great way to use leftover Easter Ham. Used peas instead of aspargus. Onions instead of leeks. Wonderful!

We loved this! I made a couple of modifications to the sauce, because the amount of cream was freaking me out a little. I used about half a cup of the real deal, and one cup of fat free half and half. Then I made a slurry of half a cup of chicken broth and 2 t. cornstarch. I added the chicken broth mixture right before the ham and cheese step. It turned out GREAT. The asparagus at our grocery store wasn't looking so hot, so I substitued about a cup of peas. It was very family friendly, and perfect on a cold fall evening! I'll definitely be making it again.

There was a quite a bit of cuttin up, but it was certainly worth it! My two kids also loved it, thereby making it a keeper. I didn't have enough asparagus, so I added some frozen peas. This recipe would lend itself to many vegetables, and I will be experimenting in the future.

Like another reviewer, I've made this repeatedly and assure you that you can improvise wildly and it will still be wonderful. I've used corn instead of yellow pepper (hey, it was the same color!), dried leeks when I couldn't find fresh. Thrown in sugar snap peas. Even dumped Kraft parmesan into it instead of grating my own. I've stirred grilled pork, grilled chicken, even shrimps into this instead of ham. And in the dozen or so times I've fixed it, I don't think I've ever used fettucine yet. I've come to trust this recipe as something that any family member or guest will eat up. It's perfect for leftover vegetables. Followed to the letter I'd serve it to my most intimidating guests without hesitation. It's a rich, colorful, lovely one-dish meal.

Delicious, so very creamy yet hearty!

I didn't have heavy cream so I used my fat free 1/2 and 1/2 (i use it for my coffee) and it was still wonderful! My 7 and 3-year-old ate every vegetable and that doesn't happen very often. Loved it!

I hardly ever review a recipe that I haven't followed exactly, but when I didn't have quite all the ingredients for this one I did it anyway and it was great. No country ham so I used proscuitto, no peppers so I used a handful of frozen peas.. and only had 1 cip of cream so reduced that to 1/2 cup and added a big spoonful ( about 3 oz.) of mascarpone , the consistency seemed right so I just went ahead and it was delicious. Would make anytime !!

A great mid-week family dinner. However, I would not use as much cream. It was a bit runny, but the taste was great! Will make again for sure.

A recipe even the kids enjoyed! Although they don't always enjoy my try at gourmet dishes, they are always willing to try new ones. This particular dish got rave reviews and ended up in our "make again" file!
