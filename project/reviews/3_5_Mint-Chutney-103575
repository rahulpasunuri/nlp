Made as indicated but blended everything in the end to make it like the sauces in Indian restaurants. Very good.

Wonderful and so simple! Would add oomph to just about anything.

I served this with samosas and it was great. I chopped the onions in the food processor to save time both chopping and in the cooking. I also didn't want it to chunky.

Wow, it took very little time to make and the result was tasty. Great with grilled vegetables. Definitely a winner.

Great recipe! I served with Crown Roast of Lamb with Rosemary and Oregano (from epicurious) everybody loved it. Definetly try this.

So much better than those "too sweet" mint sauces that you get in the store. Will never buy store bought again!! Served this with lamb and it was wonderful. The red pepper gave it a nice little kick...just enough to make it interesting!

Outstanding, and not limited to shrimp..great for Chilean seabass etc. My husband was "in transport" and he is sophisticated!
