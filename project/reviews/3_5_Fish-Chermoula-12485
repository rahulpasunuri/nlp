We LOVE this recipe and have made it over and over again, usually substituting lemon juice for the preserved lemons, and serving it over rice instead of fennel. Last time I made it with preserved lemons (finally - I had preserved a batch myself) and didn't notice much difference in flavor. Our two favorite fish for this recipe are red snapper and monkfish. The scent when it comes out of the oven is just fabulous!

I thought this was great. I used orange juice and some orange flesh instead of lemon because my dad sent me some oranges from Florida. The only problem was execution, I didn't measure the red pepper flakes and got a little heavy handed with them. Mahi-mahi was our fish of choice, which seemed to be complimented by this array of spices. The coriander is a nice piece of flair.

I've made this dish once and everyone loved it -- really interesting flavors, healthy, easy and can be made ahead. I used the recipe from the Gourmet cookbook which has no saffron, 2 tbsp lemon juice & no preserved lemons and 1/4 cup parsley plus 1/4 fresh cilantro. Used monkfish and pureed the fennel because I am not a huge fan. It was all delicious.

It was OK. Granted I didn't have preserved lemons, so I used juice and zest. One of my guests didn't like fennel so I served it with couscous and sauteed spinach. Still, it tasted strange to me. Not bad, but I wouldn't make it again.

This is a fabulous dish for people who care what they put into their bodies. It has lots of fresh vegetables and tastes out of this world. My husband loves it and he is a real picky eater. I substituted fresh lemon for the preserves and cilantro for the parsley because that is what I had on hand. I added some mushrooms to the fennel and it was great.

I preserved my own Meyer lemon crop, using an Epicurious recipe, rather than lose them and then looked for recipes for preserved lemons. This one is delicious and easy. My coffee grinder did not grind the spices as finely as I would have liked, but my family was O.K. with the coarsely ground pepper and coriander. The fennel was wonderful and fragrant. We loved this dish and I will make it again.

I loved this and so did my guests. I used sea bass and served it with couscous and sautéed zucchini. I love Moroccan food anyway so this was perfect for me. I would definitely recommend it for a special occasion.

I tried adapting this to a large whole red Grouper (yes $37 fish!) I doubled the chermoula recipe, cut slits in the fish, rubbed it down, sealed it in foil and baked it until done. Bleck! I don't recommending adapting this to a whole fish... personally I'm going to stick to lamb for Moroccan seasoning.

This was delicious--I, too, made it with tilapia and it was great.

Used tilapia, fresh lemon juice and zest and ground coriander. Still excellent. Will make this often. Easy and Mmmmmmmmmm!!!

We loved it. The flavors are exotic. Instead of fennel (didn't have any) I served it over rice. It was wonderful.

Great for a dinner party because once the chermoula is made the entree is in the fridge all ready to pop in the oven. Usually don't like baked fish, but this is a winner. Complex well-balanced flavor.

I used Tilapia, and this recipe was fabulous - worth the effort!

The only thing I changed was the saffron. I used ground instead of threads because it provides a better flavor.

An ace recipe! Fun and easy to prepare. I managed to get hold of preserved whole lemons at Fairway on Manhattan's Upper West Side -- they made all the difference. Used ordinary lemon juice and wild striped bass. The fish took quite a bit longer than 15 mins to finish -- maybe need to put the dish in the top 1/3 of the oven. Served the fish over the fennel (browned and glazed in its own juices), stacked over rice noodles. De-lish-shus!

I loved it and it is quite easy to make. I did not use the fennel but instead served the fish with steamed rice.
