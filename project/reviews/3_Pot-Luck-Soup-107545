Good basic soup recipe. I added some bay leaf while simmering, ham for some meat ( for the husband, and omitted the cloves (didn't have on hand)!

OK, but a bit sour to my taste, for some reason. Threw a pinch of sugar into my bowl and that seemed to brighten it up. Next bowl maybe some apple juice.

This is a wonderful soup. Good for family and company. With a salad it makes a great meal.

I really love this soup. I sub barley for the lentils, which I prefer. This tends to thicken it up quite a bit, so extra broth/water is usually necessary. Excellent soup for fall/winter months.

Absolutely delicious, warming soup. I didn't have cloves so I used 1/8 tsp cinnamon, and three cloves of garlic instead of two. I also threw in some organic baby peas. It occured to me while I was happily slurping my fabulous soup that it would also be perfect with mussels and clams in lieu of lentils.

I made this soup twice already. Liked it alot. First time I took another reviewer's advice and substituted barley for the lentils. Nice touch. I used canned crushed tomatoes and skipped the blender. Turned out well. Very filling, nutritious and good for a calorie watcher like me.

A great vegetarian soup for a cold night! I added a few more veggies but really liked the flavor of the cloves. Definately will become a winter staple.

I made a lot of additions to this recipe, but the base recipe is very tasty. In mine, I added fresh green beans, sliced mushrooms, and white corn after the broth came to a boil. Also, I substituted barley for the lentils. Delicious! And very easy.

My mother made this soup for a family gathering, and it was absolutely delicious. I know it's good for you because my mom's on a heart healthy diet, which she follows religiously. Try this one out on a cold night.

I made this soup and so did my sister. It is very good and the calorie count is very low, good for us who are trying to watch our weight. I lost the recipe and have been looking for it.
