As mentioned in other reviews, I would approach this recipe as if you were making a pizza. Use your own personal preference for the filling but stick to the dough recipe. The portions listed in the recipe for the filling are way out of proportion but the dough recipe is great. I used another reviewer's suggestion of brushing the calzones with an egg wash and was pleased with the results. I also added red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture to add a little heat.

I used an entirely different set of ingredients for the filling (so I can't comment on that) but making the bread part of this recipe was easy and it came out perfectly!

Oh man, this was horrible. First, they took FOREVER to make. Second, the dough was too sticky and wouldn't roll out so it took forever to form the calzones. And the filling is just "okay". Definately not worth all of the time that they took!

I thought that this was very tasty. I substituted sauted fresh spinach for 1/2 of the red onion. I also gave the pastry a egg white wash to make it more golden. I agree with those who found it a touch bland, but using store-bought spaghetti sauce for dipping made all of the flavors really stand out.

I liked the calzone bread part. This has been a very good recipe to use to clean out my kitchen.

I made this for the first time last night. As most comments say, this recipe can be made a number of ways depending on personal taste. It's that the fun of cooking? :-) I made the recipe using summer sausage, black olives, the cheeses, a bit of diced chopped chipotle in adobo sauce. I left out the onions since the flavor was too invasive...I would have used carmelized yellow onions instead of red onions. The dough was great and I used it as-is but sprinkled fleur de sel on the dough before putting the calzones in the oven.

As written, I found this recipe to yield a rather bland calzone. The dough was quite good, so in the future I'll use the dough recipe and stuff my calzone with a zestier combination of meats and cheeses.

I was looking for a dough recipe and was very happy with this one. It is very easy to make and produces a nice product to use to make calzone - filled mine with the filling from the spinach and ricotta recipe on this site and they were well received by the hordes of teens that all seem to live at my house this summer.

this was a tastey experiment. I followed the 1/2 white/ 1/2 whole wheat suggestion, had to use some cheddar when i ran out of mozarella. Also used jarred roasted red pepper. It made 8 (!) medium calzones and with enough dough left over for an 8" pizza. we liked the sausage, i think other good combos are possible.

I took advice from the cook in the British West Indies, and used half whole wheat flour and half white. This made the texture much better. Home-made pizza sauce poured over the top was just just perfect! Next time I will add chopped fresh spinach to the cheese and meat filling....yummy.

I made the dough using my bread machine, following their pizza dough recipe. The sausage/cheese mixture was great. My kids do not like ricotta cheese, so I cut the ricotta cheese amount in half (kept the recipe's quantity of mozzarella) and the kids never noticed the ricotta.

I made this for dinner and the whole family loved it. I used pepperoni,hot and honey garlic sausage and lots of cheese with pizza sauce on the side for dipping.mmmmmm good!!! I cooked the ingredients and made the dough the night before and put it in the fridge.With a baby, it made making these calzones much easier. It's now a favourite here!!!

Very easy to make. I made a double batch and froze a bunch for quick dinners. I just had the last of the calzones last night, and it tasted just as good as when I made them 2 months ago. I think the key is good sausage though. I bought mine from a local Italian deli, and it really "made" the calzone.

The cheese mixture uses too much oregano, the dough is not very tasty and stuck to the counter, and the entire recipe takes too much effort for no worthwhile result. also, the sausage is far too heavy and should be removed from the recipe or replaced wtih chicken breast

We thought that this recipes was much better when we added more cheese,pepperoni and pizza sauce to it

I have made this recipe twice and thought it was wonderful. The second time around I added homemade pizza sauce and fresh sauteed spinach. This recipe is definately a keeper!!!

This was delicious! My husband and I both loved it. The dough turned out great and we both loved the cheese mixture. Next time, just for variation, I may omit the onions and red pepper and add spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Well worth the time!

Turned out very well. I thought the cheese mixture was excellent and I will use it with other recipes. I will use premade pizza dough with it next time. That will cut the time way down.

Even thought this took A LONG time it was amazing!! I never thought I could make such a gourmet calzone! It was the first time I'd roasted bell peppers and made dough from scratch, I was amazed at how easy it was. I used a "healthier" sausage, Italian turkey sausage, and it was fantastic. I will make this next time for dinner guests because I know it will impress the heck out of them!

Will definitely make this again. I added a bit of crushed chili peppers for a bit of a kick to this dish which worked very well. My friends thought that it was very good and would like me to make again. I served the Calzone with hot and spicy pizza sauce.

This was delicious, easy, although a little time consuming. Next time I will make half veggie and half meat. I am trying freezing some (unbaked), as it makes too much for two people.

I made it only with the cheese mix and red/yellow bell pepper and it was delicious. I mad nother version with roasted eggplants instead of the peppers and added some homemade pesto. I served it with Sun-Dried Tomato And Pesto Torta (also from Epicurious) and it was a hit.

I was in a rush (friends coming over spur of the moment) and I made this recipe with pillsbury pizza dough and red peppers from a jar. It was still fantastic! Quick, easy, and tasted great. A keeper!

These were yummy calzones! It was the first time I'd tried roasting a red bell pepper, and it worked fine in the broiler. As other reviewers suggested, I added mushrooms and olives, and substituted whole wheat flour for half of the white flour. I also used seasoned ground beef instead of Italian sausage, which is close to impossible to find over here. The cheese mixture was wonderful! I spooned tomato and basil pasta sauce over the tops of these before serving. Great taste, good presentation. Will definitely make again.

My family did not care for this. First of all they were huge. Second, they didnt have a lot of flavor. I used spicy sausage. Disappointed, especially since this has gotten so many good reviews.

The dough was easy to prepare. I took the advice of the other cooks and added spicy sausage. I also added sliced black olives along with my own pizza sauce. I baked the calzone on a baking stone and was quite happy with the results. I will be making this again!

I've made this several times. The dough is easy to make in a bread machine and makes the whole preparation even easier. I usually use spicy sausage and have made other substitutions but usually to please my children.

A great recipe. We used spicy sausage, added some pizza sauce, and cooked it on a baking stone. This is restauarant quality, and we'll definitely be making it again.

Good flavors but a bit bland. I would use spicy sausage and perhaps a little fresh tomato sauce.

With several adjustments, I will make this dish again. First of all, the dough recipe is delicious. Perfect for calzones, strombolis, and pizza. If you have a bread machine, make it in that and it comes out perfectly. Second, I loved the roasted peppers and onions, but I thought that the sausage overpowered their flavor. I would recommend omitting the sausage and making a veggie calzone (perhaps adding some grilled eggplant or other grilled veggies). If you want meat, I suggest using the sausage and doing a more traditional approach, adding mushrooms, black olives, pepperoni and the like. I think the filling choices are endless. Just take any favorite pizza recipe and put it in. It will definately work. That is what I plan to do. Finally, I will probably omit the ricotta next time (even though I realize that most calzones use it). I think mozzarella alone or mixed with other cheeses such as cheddar, jack, gouda, or whatever compliments your stuffing would be better. Also, thought there was too much oregano. One other must, bake it on a pizza stone because the crust comes out much crisper than if baked on a baking sheet. There are so many possibilities with this recipe; your imagination is your limit!

This is very yummy! I've made it 3 times in the last month for friends. Everyone loves them. I make one big calzone and serve with a salad. It's perfect for a casual get-together.

My husband suggested using spicy sausage next time. I served it with a spaghetti sauce spooned over the top. The peppers and onions were my favoirte part. Next time I'll make more of those and lay them over the top as well.

Luscious, even without the ricotta. I would highly recommend substituting whole wheat flour for half of the white flour.

This is great! I also had sucess making the dough in my bread machine- I added a little dry Italian seasoning to the dough for some added flavor. For a meatless filling, try chopping a couple of portabello mushrooms, and sauteing with garlic, onions, and the red pepper in place of the sausage-tastes great.

YES! This is sooo mouth-watering delicious. I wouldn't change a thing...

I make this recipe all the time! I prepare the filling the day before and set my bread machine to make the dough while I am at work. When I get home from work, the dough is ready to go. I make two calzones, my 3-year old daughter makes her own pizza, and I freeze the rest of the dough for later in the week. I use cornmeal on the baking sheets, which makes the calzones easy to slide off.

Excellent recipe. try different filling ingredients. The mozzarella, ricotta, oregano mixture is a must in using. I brushed the dough with olive oil before baking. It gave it a nice chewy texture. I felt that it did'nt reheat very well. It seemed to have lost alot of its flavor.

I am the queen of shortcuts. I used Pillsbury Pizza Crust that you unroll like fresh pizza dough. Just cut in half and form into 2 rounds. Also after cooked halfway, brush with egg wash to give it a baked glaze. I'm told I make the best calzones ever!

XLNT recipe. Most of the filling can be made the day before. The dough is easy and freezes well. Don't skimp on the cheese, they may look very fat going into the oven but when the cheese melts, the calzone deflates. Any left overs are still good the next day warmed up in a toaster oven.

Have made this recipe many times, each with different fillings. My family loved it. I found the dough to be very good and have used this dough recipe for pizza and other delights.

Great recipe, but a caution about calzones. If one substitutes ingredients containing a lot of moisture (tomatoes, eggplant, sauces), the calzone gets soggy while baking. Best to stick with meats and cheese, roasted pepper, herbs and the like. Had best ever calzone in Sorrento. It contained ham and cheese only.

Dough was very sticky and difficult to work with. I didn't use all the onions...too many! I substituted sweet turkey sausage for the regular for a more healthy meal. Very tasty!

The calzones were great! The hardest part of the recipe was rolling out the dough, but don't let that scare you. They are worth it. In 2 of them I subsituted mushrooms for the sausage and they turned just as wonderful.
