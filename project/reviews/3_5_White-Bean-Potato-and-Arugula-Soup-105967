I have to add that I cook this soup much, much longer than called for. I reduce it until the beans are falling apart, and it is a little thick. If you want your beans more intact, then I wouldn't add the bean water to the potato & stock. I also usually cook all the garlic in the beginning, and finish with chili-garlic sauce (Chinese style). It adds a special spicy tang. The parm oil finishes it nicely.

This soup is fantastic, I make as written with no changes except a longer cooking time for the beans. The Parmesan oil takes the soup from good to great. All our friends are "foodies" and they rave when I make this soup. To those who haven't had success, either you missed steps or your ingredients were poor quality. It's a pretty inexpensive soup to make for the number it feeds, so spring for good Parmesan and start with dry beans!

emulsify cold leftovers with some truffle oil and goat cheese for a fabulous dip!

My family loved this soup. However, to save washing an extra pan, I finfished cooking the potatoes in the pot with the mostly- cooked beans. I found no difference in the end product.

This recipe was time consuming which is okay however the soup was oily and did not have much flavor. I will not make this soup again.

What a waste of good arugula! I chose this recipe because I had some wonderful arugula from the farmers market and the ingredients sounded like it couldn't miss. Wrong! I don't like to sound a negative tone amidst all the positive reviews, but, frankly, this soup was a whole lot of work for very little pay off. It was one of the least attractive soups I've ever made-- there's so much oil in this soup it has a greasy look to it. If it hadn't been for the crushed red pepper, it would have had very little flavor. I certainly won't be making this again.

If you are out of arugula, or cannot find any, this recipe also works well with spinach or chard. I spice mine up with some crushed red pepper and basil. We never make the parmesan oil and it's so tasty we don't even miss it. :-)

We enjoyed this so much that I've made this recipe repeatedly over the winter. The flavor of the stock is sublime! In a hurry: substitute jar of prepared beans for dry beans. Also, I have used escarole if arugula is unavailable.

This is one of the best soups I have ever made! The parmesan oil really thickened the soup. I followed the directions exactly, and it made a ton of soup (at least 10 servings, and I still have 6 more servings in the freezer). It is worth making the whole batch and then freezing some, because the recipe takes quite a bit of time (about 2 hours, after soaking the beans overnight).

I've made this twice and it was excellent. I passed the recipe along to a friend who is one of the best cooks that I know and she did not have as much luck. I think anyone who tries this recipe should be sure to 1) use dry beans, not canned 2) reduce the broth somewhat to your liking, 3) use arugula to make the flavors blend magically, 4) add plenty of salt, 5) the parmesan oil is critical, but reduce the oil just enough to bind the grated parmesan together.

I used two cans of northern beans not drained instead of dried. I also used the adivice of previous reviewer and threw in rind of parmesean cheese instead of parmesean oil. Did add 1/8 cup olive oil toward end. I simmered my soup for an hour or two. Was thick, hearty, delicious and easy! We are using this recipe for our next gourmet supper club as well as cold weather dinners.

ahhhhhh, now this is comfort food! Wonderful! I don't know where I'm going wrong but I ALWAYS cut my soup recipe's in half and still end up with enough to feed 6 - 8 people! With this recipe, I cut all the ingredients in half except for the potato, it turned out PERFECT! I will make this again.

Delicious. I think one of the charms of this recipe is that it is a bit brothier than many Italian bean based soups. A couple of tips for lazy fans of flavor. Skip the parmasaen oil and instead add one or two rinds of parmasaen reggianno (save them in a ziploc in the freezer when you grate your parm down to the rind for other dishes) to the chicken stock as it heats up. Also, saute all the garlic, with the chile pepper, during the potato sauteing.

I think the end product turned out pretty good - my father loved it actually. But...it seemed like it called for an unnecessarily large amount of olive oil - it was pooling on top of the soup. I wouldn't make the "parmesan oil" next time - I would just toss some parm. in and avoid all of the extra oil. It was also quite watery and I had to cook it down for a long time. It needed a lot of seasoning to get it to be flavorful. Basically I think it required a lot of tinkering to get it right.

Well I was really expecting to love this soup after reading all the reviews but I thought it was just so so. I don't understand why the recipe calls for sprigs of rosemary, why not chop them? We didn't care to have them floating around in the soup. I love garlic but I think ten cloves was too much. The arugula was very nice and yes the soup did benefit from quite a bit of salt. Overall I was disappointed after so much work. I made my stock while the beans were soaking/cooking. I was in the kitchen too long! I can see how this dish could be expensive. Lots of olive oil, parm cheese and if you had to make stock like I did. Arugula is cheap though and I only used 1 large bunch and it was plenty. I would maybe try it again and use less garlic and a little less rosemary.

Great soup! I made half the recipe, since there is only two of us, and it turned out to be plenty for four. We were very glad for the leftovers because it was even better the second time around. The parmesan oil is a must - it made the soup!!

This is an awesome soup! Even my soup-hating family likes it. It definitely benefits from salt and the Parmesan Oil is a must. This is a keeper!

Wonderful soup. My meal-mates, who are on a basic level meat-and-potatoes guys, loved it. Hearty and satisfying with crusty bread on a winter's night. Don't skimp on the garlic and hot pepper and make sure you make the beans from scratch - it's worth it. But duh, you do need to add salt!!

This soup recipe is wonderful, and I wonder what went wrong for the OP cook--overcooked the beans, maybe? I also wonder about calliing it "expensive", unless OP is buying arugula in the herb section instead of the greens. (Note to OP: check out Wild Oats--a LARGE bunch of arugula costs only around $2-3.)I almost gave this recipe 4 forks. The parmesan oil is a must.

This is great. Love it. Made it canned white beans & used spinach instead of arugula. It's such a simple soup & usually have all the ingredients on hand, which makes this a fast & cheap meal.

Easy and elegant, and nutritious, too! I added extra crushed red pepper for a kick and a little salt. I used a little spinach, but found the soup really benefited from the peppery arugula.

Perhaps the worst soup I have ever had. I followed the recipe exactly. Not only was it expensive, but the taste and texture were that of baby food. As I am from the KC area, I am familiar with this restaurant's soup. Without a doubt, there are some "missing" ingredients in the RSVP.
