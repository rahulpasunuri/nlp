Just made this for dipping pretzel rods -- and it was EXCELLENT tasting and easy to use!!! I only had salted butter & light corn syrup on hand, so used these and omitted the salt. My caramel cooked MUCH faster than the recipe indicates but was perfect. Anxious to get the caramel-coated rods into chocolate & then decorate for Christmas!

I haven't made these yet, but wonder if anybody's used the caramel for dipping pretzels or something other than applies? Planning to do pretzel rods dipped in caramel, then chocolate & then deco'd with sprinkles, mini chips, etc., etc. The complex flavor of the caramel sounds excellent!

If you suspect that the molasses flavor will be too strong for you don't try this caramel. I didn't believe it would be caramel tasting but tried it anyway based on the reviews. It is very flavorful just doesn't come across caramel more of the taste you expect from caramel corn. There is probably a lot of uses for the recipe and the caramel dipped apples are good but not show stoppers. The caramel is sticky and stays soft so it keeps pooling until it get cold. It doesn't stick to apple pieces but will form around them once it is cold. It is described as kid friendly which I hope means for eating not making. The caramel sputters and can get on the skin because you have to stir constantly. It might be excellent as a center dipped in dark chocolate. It might be a challenge to get it to form so you can dip it. I won't be making it again.

This recipe was fantastic. I was nervous about the molasses, which I dislike, but I used the full amount anyway. It turned out to be the most delicious caramel I've ever made. I used honeycrisp apples, which were awesome coated in caramel...a touch sweeter than Granny Smiths, but still tart and firm. I had trouble getting the caramel to stick to the last 2 apples that I dipped, so I suspect there's an optimal temperature window in which to coat them (I tried re-heating the caramel, but still couldn't get it right).

With this recipe, I made 18 of the most delightful tasting caramel apples ever! I am not a seasoned cook, and when I was unable to locate the usual Caramels in a bag, I decided it was time to check my Epicurious App on my iPhone as I had had a wonderful experience with the Pastel de Tres Leches cake, which by the way is FABULOUS. Since I am not a big fan of molasses, I tweaked the recipe slightly - I used 2 tsp of Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla, and 1/2 tsp Molasses - was afraid to venture too far out of the box. I did however, follow the preparation instructions to the T. Some tips: 1) I used small-medium Gala apples; 2) sanitized my kitchen sink and filled with hot water, tossing all apples in and then washed one at a time with a fruit/vegetable wash, dried and inserted a lollipop stick; 3) lined cookie sheets with buttered wax paper; 4) used a medium sized sauce pan so I could control the heat on a smaller burner of my glass top stove; 5) dipped apples in yummy caramel spinning off excess, then held up right for a few seconds, eliminating almost all of the pooling - once all apples were dipped, I took a knife and slide under the apple to remove with ease, patting down the caramel on the bottom as needed and then decorated (chopped dry roasted almonds, peanuts or pecans, coconut, dark chocolate, milk chocolate or Heath Toffee bits...yum!); 6) after each apple was decorated, I placed on wax paper in the freezer no longer than 5 mins to help set faster allowing me the ability to place each apple in a cellophane bag (3x5x11) and tie so I could store (covered) overnight in the fridge. These apples were a hit at work! I highly recommend this recipe, however, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS! I will absolutely make this recipe again.

I recently tried a different recipe for caramel apples that incorporated cream and required a cooking temperature of 320 degrees. What a disaster!!!!!! It did not work at all. Then I tried this one. PERFECTION! I could not stop eating the caramel! I followed it to the letter, ingredients-wise, but I waited until the caramel was about 180 degrees before dipping. I had no problems with the caramel sticking to the apples. This is one of the yummiest recipes I have ever tried!

Rating: 4
I made 120 of these for my wedding as the wedding favor and got nothing but raves from the guests. Probably not the best idea making caramel to cover 120 apples the week of your wedding if your trying to slim down! Anyways great recipe, just make sure to test your apples. Sometimes the Granny Smiths can be a little too tart (not ripe) but they are still good.

I like so many others, had not tried a candy thermometer either. I was pretty apprehensive about this recipe. The caramel is not at all like the Kraft caramels. The taste is much like a gourmet caramel you would get at a boutique or specialty bakery. Mine turned out very well. My only problem was the pooling of the caramel. Also I found that after I took the apples out of the fridge they became very sticky after a couple of hours. TIP: Do not use foil to place them on. I used wax paper and they didn't stick at all!!

Rating: 4
Wonderful recipe!! Tips for success: 1) Remove wax in a tub of hot water with baking soda. 2) Attempt to use Honeycrisp apples. 3) Place dipped apples on Quick-release, non-stick foil 4) Use a thermometer!! Enjoy!!

I've tried a lot of different ways to make caramel, and this is the best. Good consistency, great flavor. I cut the apples for easier dipping and consuming. Had some trouble with the caramel sticking to the foil even though I buttered it. I'll butter it more next time and maybe let it cool more before trying to pick them up. yummy!

Every time we have a celebration at the house during fall and even christmas time, we turn out this "BEST RECIPE EVER" of a Caramel Sauce! I had 8 people in my family and they have all had a hand in making THERE best caramel sauce. But, when anyone tried this recipe, they quickly would change there ways. It's everything you wanted caramel to be. I use a delectable favorite, a coating of "Sugar In the Raw". Such a sweet and crunchy extra! Really festive and fun recipe

The caramel is the best caramel I have ever made. It was deep and dark and a bit salty and OMG incredible. However, the process of dipping apples and trying to get the majority of the caramel to stay on the apple is a nightmare. Skip that process, slice up the apples and dip it in this caramel and you have a winner. (Yes I tried scrubbing the apples and even bought a fruit wash!)

very very good. made these for my 9 yr old girl's birthday party ! girl's got to decorate them. smash hit! great halloween prop and decoration, too. Great fun! Best caramel EVER, for sure! and leftover caramel makes easy dipping sauce afterwards :)

OMGosh!!! Amazingly perfect caramel, and the dipping was easy. Followed the recipe to a T (which I never do, but this is "candy," so I did). Make sure you let the caramel cool before dipping, and then hold the once dipped apple upside down on its stick so the caramel has a chance to set. Had NO pooling, made chocolate caramels from the extra and was the star of the party. Unbelievably good!

These were the caramel apples of my dreams. Just trying eating store bought caramel after this! As long as you remove any wax from the apples (I dipped them in hot water and rubbed it off) you shouldn't have any problem coating them. If they are left out several hours some caramel will pool below, but I was able to easily mold it by hand right back onto the apple. This sauce remained chewy - which I loved. I used Macoun apples, the taste was delicious. This is my de facto caramel recipe from now on.

Lovely caramel - to me, it tasted strongly of the condensed milk (which I like). Keep extra apples handy - there was more than enough caramel to coat 12 apples.

They should call these grown up gourmet caramel apples. I loved the way the molasses added flavor depth to the caramel and I rolled some in finely chopped pecans, some in baby chocolate morsels and some in toffee bits. I "strung" white chocolate and cinnamon chocolate strands (melted and dropped in strands) all over the apples. They were gorgeous and received amazed comments by my kids and friends. I gently washed the apples in a sudsy bath with a vegetable scrubber and rinsed well so the caramel adhered well. These went over so well I am planning on another batch before halloween.

I made these this weekend for a party and they were amazing. I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. I used a Le Creuset pan to make the caramel and I didn't have any problems with the caramel sliding off the apples. The apples did have a waxy coating so I dunked them in simmering water, rubbed fairly hard to remove the wax and dried them. After dipping them in caramel, I dipped some in Valrhona 76% chocolate. I did a variety of toppings, mini-M&Ms, Andes mint pieces, peanuts, mini- Reese's pieces, macadamia nuts and toasted coconut was my favorite. I'll definitely be making these for a Halloween party.

I can't believe how well this recipe turned out! My family who makes everything from scratch loved these.The only problem was the overindulgence! It didn't seem to take as long as the recipe said to cook to the correct temp, but that was okay with me! I will definitely use this again!

I just made these for the first time tonight and, well, WOW! I wanted a bite-sized version to put on a Thanksgiving dessert table, so I attacked several apples with a melon-baller, inserted decorative toothpicks, and dipped away. The caramel adhered perfectly, to my utter stupefaction! And what could be better than a caramel apple you can just pop whole into your mouth? My family absolutely foundered!

I've made this caramel two years in a row. Last year it tasted great, but didn't stick to the apples. This year I scrubbed the apples under hot water to remove any wax. Next year I'll try the boiling water dip technique. This year they turned out perfectly. I don't even like caramel and I love this recipe. I usually muck around with recipes, but I follow this exactly. Everyone at my party liked the treat. I don't even dress up the apples with toppings and everyone is impressed. I also do red pears for a friend who is allergic to apples. Those are tasty too. I'll definitely makes these again next year.

Also had a problem with caramel dripping off apples and pooling. I think dipping temp should be lowered so caramel is thicker. I ended up redipping apples because the caramel was too thin - apples slightly showed through. The quicker you chill them, the less caramel runs off (so clear room in the fridge). Quite a mess and wastes a lot of caramel. Caramel was dark - would do 1/2 light corn syrup next time. Very tasty though!

Rating: 4
This recipe worked perfectly! The caramel is very delicious, exactly as written and comes out to exactly the right consistency. I read a tip elsewhere to dip the apples briefly in boiling water to remove any wax, before beginning to cover them with caramel, and this worked very well. I had one extra apple that I decided at the last minute to do, and it didn't get dipped in boiling water - it was the only apple that had trouble with the caramel sliding off. All the rest of them worked just fine. After chilling in the fridge, I covered mine in white chocolate, then drizzled with milk chocolate, so they no longer had to remain chilled. They turned out beautifully, weren't hard to make and tasted delicious. Definitely a keeper. Thanks, Epicurious, you made me look like a pro.

This is what I refer to as an adult caramel. The taste is a little more refined than what you are used to eating. I made these for christmas presents for my coworkers, so I ended up making a few batches, and did a few things different each time. I recommend adding the molasses; however, I only used 1/4 teaspoon. Also, you have to let the caramel cool for next to forever. Keep checking it though, because if you wait too long, it wont stick right. Another thing...I rolled my apples in different toppings such as crushed heath & milk chocolate chips, white, milk and special dark chocolate chips, oreos, & peanut butter and milk chocolate chips. Any candies would work well, but these are the ones I got the most compliments on. To make it a little more fancy, melt some chocolate chips with a dash of oil and drizzle over the apples. One thing I think you should know is that yes, sometimes you will have a pool of toppings and caramel on the tray, what I did was to hurry and put the freshed coated apple on a piece of wax paper, secure with a twist tie, and then put in the refrigerator to set. Worked perfect. I cant wait to make these again!

I had great success making this recipe. I followed the temps to the letter. The only thing I changed was that I omitted the molasses. The caramel was a little goey when warm but a few minutes in my frig. did the trick. I didn't add the nuts until the caramel was semi-firm on the apple. Friends and family are now asking me for the recipe. I am making these again next year!

This was a huge fiasco. I tested my candy thermometer, followed the recipe to the letter, and watched the caramel slide off the apples into one unsightly pool after another. I wonder if the previous reviewer who thought there might be too much butter is right . . . what a mess. That said, the caramel itself is delicious. Perhaps it was a mistake to count on these for Halloween and try to make them that afternoon. I'd like to try again; any advice from those of you who had success would be welcome!

Wonderful tasting carmel, but I had the same problem as previous reviewers: the carmel wouldn't stick to the apples. I had to press it together, and once I dipped it into the cashews or M&Ms a bit of it slid off. My first thought was too much butter. Maybe I let it cool too long I highly recommend it drizzled with cashews and white chocolate!

So, I did alter a few things so I didn't have to buy things I didn't have on hand. I used cheap pancake syrup instead of maple syrup, light corn syrup instead of dark and salted butter instead of unsalted and left the salt out. Yes people, you need the molasses. Yum! I also used wooden BBQ skewers instead of chopsticks and they worked fine. We prepped these for a dinner party by dipping in caramel the night before and tomorrow we will dip in chocolate and a multitude of toppings! Wowee Zowee!

I have made this recipe for at least 2 years and it is awesome in the true sense of the word. I always dip the set caramel apples in dark chocolate and then roll in what ever sounds good..toasted graham cracker crumbs,toffe bits, mini chocolate chips, crystalized ginger. A real show stopper.

I made two batches of these right before halloween, and everybody raved about them. My ex husband ate one and said it was "the best caramel" he has ever had." I did toasted walnuts, mini m and m's, plain, and white chocolate drizzled. All turned out wonderfully.

I made these today for kids ranging in age from 4-7. Like a previous reviewer, I had never made candy before or worked with a candy thermometer and had no problem. The kids loved them and I had them roll theirs in nuts, pulverized cookies, and (my favorite) crushed pretzels. I had them put the toppings on immediately after dipping caramel -- I don't know how they would have stuck otherwise. Also, I agree that the molasses is a bit much; I might reduce it or leave it out all together. All in all, these were very, very good and very easy.

I have never made caramel apples before, nor have I ever cooked with a candy thermometer. My daughter wanted to make some "fancy" caramel apples to go in her teacher gift baskets for Christmas. The directions for this recipe were very easy to follow for a novice candy maker like myself. We used chopped nuts, and drizzled white and milk chocolate over the finished caramel apples. The apples make a beautiful presentation, and taste divine! We'll definitely make these again, maybe tonight... Can't wait to share these with friends and family.

I halved this recipe because i am just cooking for myself and my fiancee. I am just getting into cooking and i dont have a candy thermometer so i just guessed when it came to the cooking of the caramel- big mistake! The caramel didnt stick to the apples very well, so we ended up cutting the apples into chunks and dipping it into the caramel. It was still sooo fantastic that way. Next time i will definitely make this with the aid of a thermometer LOL!

This recipe produced, hands down, THE BEST caramel apple I've ever had the pleasure of eating. The caramel was creamy, rich, and chewy, and covered the apples very well. I omitted the molasses, used half dark, half light corn syrup, and used the best French butter I could get my hands on. They were a hit and taste even better the next day (refrigerated). Forsake Kraft caramels forever (leave it up to Sandra Lee of Semi-Homemade Crap to use them!) -- these are definitely worth the effort.

Very easy caramel to make. Tasted delicious. Substituted light Karo syrup due to food allergy for the dark syrup. Caramel was the color of chocolate. Might possibly leave molasses out next time. Used cashews, toasted unsweetened coconut, heath bits, mini-chocolate chips and the kids wanted the sour powdered candy that comes in paper tubes.

Actually I would give this 2 and 1/2 fork rating. The caramel was very good. I followed the recipe exactly, but I think I prefer a lighter caramel. Next time I would use a light instead of dark brown sugar, maybe light corn syrup, and no molasses. The caramel seemed to be more like what I make for caramel candy. If this was cooked to a higher temp., it would be delicious for caramel candies. But for apples I like a lighter tasting caramel. Recipe also coated more apples than 12, but my apples were on the smaller side. :)

These are incredible! I only had trouble with the caramel not sticking on the last two apples. This has to be done as quickly as possible. Next time, I will enlist some help. For the reviewer looking for a smoother chocolate for dipping, use two parts of your favorite chocolate to one part whipping cream. Warm the cream til near boiling, remove from heat, add the chocolate and let sit a minute before whisking 'til smooth. Refrigerate the finished apples 'til the chocolate sets, then they are okay at room temperature. The texture of the final chocolate is incredible.

My friend and I make these together and no longer worry about the sticking problem. We dip the apples and place them on a silpat lined baking sheet and immediately cool them in the refrigerator for about twenty minutes. The caramel becomes very pliable and we hand mold it around the apples before rolling them in toppings, like chopped pecans and melted chocolate. It works out perfectly.

I had the same problem of the caramel not sticking. The problem was that the caramel was too hot at 200. After cooling a bit more it stuck just fine. Also the apples that cooled longer than the recommended 15 minutes in the fridge were easier to deal with when shaping and dipping in the toppings.

I made these apples with the children at my daughter's birthday party and they had great fun dipping and rolling in the different toppings. (Please be careful with the hot caramel - it burns!)

I live in a small town in Alaska and I have been making this recipe for the past three years for the Halloween Hoot (it usually snows by Halloween so the community puts halloween on in a central location).

Terrific! This is the first carmel apple recipe I've used that the carmel stuck to the apples. I found the recipe easy to prepare. Drizzled some semi-sweet chocolate over the top. My husband and I sliced the carmel and chocolate covered apple to share. It tasted very decadent!

I loved the carmel part of this recipe!!! It was beyond compare and makes plenty to generously dip the 12 apples. I highly recommend putting the apples in the fridge to cool before dipping them in chocolate. I wish you had included a good recipe for dipping. I just melted semi-sweet baking bars and didn't find them as smooth as I would have liked. Overall though - these were a huge treat. I wrapped them in squares of saran wrap and tied them with halloween ribbon. Great gifts for halloween.
