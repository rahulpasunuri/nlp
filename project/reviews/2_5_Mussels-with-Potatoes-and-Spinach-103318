I thought this was pretty good (the mussels turned out better than the vegetables), but my husband really liked it. My potatoes were undercooked, but browned too quickly in the pan. If I make again, I'll pay closer attention to them.

This is a very tasty, easy dish that I can even make on a night when I've had to work late. It fits in very well with my weight loss plan, as well. I've also made this recipe substituting mahogany clams, and different greens, such as chard or rappini. It's one of my favorites.
