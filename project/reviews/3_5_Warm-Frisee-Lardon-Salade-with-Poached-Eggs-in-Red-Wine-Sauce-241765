Fantastic recipe! The richness of the egg yolk mixed with the light greens, simple dressing and richness of the red wine sauce worked extremely well together. Sauce will appear thin before adding flour mixture. Be sure to cook out the flour completely for the taste of the red wine sauce to be spot on.

Loved this dish so much we made it twice. Seeing poached eggs and lardons on frisée, we were deeply skeptical, but the (yes, very time- consuming) sauce worked its magic and made us True Believers.

Where is the bread in the photo? Plating is questionnable. This is okay, but the dressing isn't great maybe different vinegar. It does have potential, however. I just don't like to have to tweak a recipe. I like a good one that needs no changes.
