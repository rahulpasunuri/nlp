I agree with another review - this recipe presents as though a lot of work was put into it, yet it's so easy. Loved the green sauce against the white scallops. The taste was indeed subtle - not too much herb, not too much bean blandness. Everybody liked it.

This recipe is a terrific change of pace. Sort of cassoulet-ish but much lighter. We used a very fresh cod filet (in chunks) instead of shrimp and mixed the scallops and fish into the sauce. served with rice but pasta would have been good too. I would't serve this if I were trying to impress dinner guests but for a quiet evening at home its a winner.

When I made the sauce for this recipe, I thought it would be an absolute "bust." I decided to go with it anyway and was surprised that it tasted much better with all ingredients in place. My husband and son are hearty eaters so I did serve it with a small amount of pasta and a sprinkling of freshly grated parmesan cheese.

As much as we love these favors individually, this dish got a resounding "Yuck" at my house. Too bad, since I was really looking forward to a flavorful, low fat, and quick weeknight meal. Oh well.

A lovely recipe. The bean sauce has such nice, vivid flavor you may want to double it. I've made this with langoustino instead of shrimp, and that's also very good. This dish will inspire you to experiment, but try it straight first. You'll like it.

It was delicious and a nice change from the usual seafood recipes. We loved it! I would definitely make it again with no changes.

An excellent recipe. Subtle flavors. Tasted like I put much more work into it than I actually did. Try it!

Try this recipe! The scallops this week didn't look so good, so I used only shrimp. This is perfect as an appetizer the recipe will serve four. My dinner guests raved. Hmmmmmmmmm good.

Wonderful!! Different. For goument mag this was an easy recipe. I might use dried beans next time instead of canned. Serve with a rustic bread.
