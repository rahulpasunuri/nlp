I love these rolls. I make them every year for Thanksgiving and they are always terrific. I'll try the suggestion of the egg wash because my one complaint is that the seeds do fall off. I put a mix of poppy, fennel, caraway and sesame on them and they're the best. Always light and fluffy with that wonderful molasses flavor.

They are OK but not spectacular. I made them exactly the way the recipe said. Now I have to admit that one member of the dinner party raved about how good they were, but alas, they did nothing for me.

these were terrific! I'll use an egg wash next time, on top, instead of the butter - all my seeds fell off while being served. Everyone LOVED them.

My family LOVES these rolls. I have made them for most holiday gatherings with rave reviews and requests to pass the butter. It is time consuming so plan ahead, like the night before. Also, and this is a BIG NOTE: do not overwork the dough, or you will end up with rolls that bounce and fly, but taste like rubber (only speaking from experience).

I used skim milk (not whole) and the rolls turned out fine. I found that I only needed about 4 1/2 cups of flour-- and even then, I added a little bit of extra flour while I was kneading. The rolls were moist and delicious, though-- and very popular.

Just a comment about the legend -- they've got it wrong. Anna was not a great baker-- according to the legend she was a lazy cook who never made anything but cornmeal mush for dinner. One night when her husband came home to find cornmeal mush on the table once again, he exclaimed "Anna, damn her!", then took the mush, added molasses and other things and baked it up into bread, for a change. And henceforth it was known as Anadama bread. That's the story. Anyway, just thought we should give credit where credit is due.

The first time I made these rolls was for my family's Thanksgiving dinner....everyone loved them. The second was for a dinner party..again a success. Easy to make just need to follow the directions carefully and set aside enough time. The first time I made them I started at 9pm and was up very late finishing the baking. Well worth it!
