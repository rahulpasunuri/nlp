Back when I was single, this used to be the dish that I would prepare the first time I had a new girlfriend over for dinner at the apartment. Very tender chicken, nice subtle flavor -- this recipe worked for me many times.

I made this with chicken thighs -- and I doubled the recipe -- and it was very good. Use the grapes, counterintuitive as it may seem. If not in this recipe, make a side of couscous with some complimentary herb (sage, maybe), pinenuts or something else for texture, and add sliced grapes to that. Yum. They are definitely part of this dish.

Delicious! I had grapes from a farmer's market that were too tart to eat plain, but were perfect for this easy, tasty dish. I used a whole chicken and doubled the sauce. Used water for the broth - so much juice comes out of the other parts of the chicken it's not necessary.

This was very moist and had nice flavor. It was an easy weeknight dinner for the family. (I used a whole cut up chicken and adjusted amounts accordingly) I didn't have riesling, so I used sherry and it was delish.

Nor sensational, but very nice flavours and presentation (I served it over plain, boiled rice). I found the chicken a little dry, although they were large breasts and I stuck to the given timings. A keeper nevertheless.

I made this tonight for my husband and after 15 years of gourmet cooking (maybe I'm that bad) he said this is one of the best sauces I've ever made. I made it exactly as the recipe said. It was really good and really east. Would be good with veal and pork.

The sweetness of the grapes complimented the rest of the sauce. I personally loved it. My boyfriend (who is not as much of a fruit lover) wasn't thrilled about the grapes. Very tasty.

I will admit that I have had better dishes, but this is a simple and reliable recipe that is difficult to dislike. I subbed halved Cornish hens, but I don't think that the results would be much different. The lemon juice does a nice job of balancing most domestic Rieslings, which have a sweet edge to them. If using a dry style, I would lighten up on the lemon. Personally, I prefer to leave the grapes whole, but each to his own. Served w/ baked rice or wild rice, I find this basic dish quite appealing.

This was very easy to prepare, however, it just wasn't that special. I probably would not bother making it again.

A good company recipe. I would cut the grapes in fourths rather than in half.
