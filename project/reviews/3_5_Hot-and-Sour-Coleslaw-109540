This is a fresh, delis way to add color & fiber to a meal. Lots of compliments at the bbq I took it. Ginger not overwhelming in the least which was my worry. Also it was not crazy hot so a wide variety of folks could enjoy. It's really good!

It was just okay. I was not blown away by the flavors. Coming from someone who likes spicy foods, the ginger was really overwhelming.

Wow!..and what a pleasant surprise. When you see the finished product and are ready to serve you may feel wary and think that you may need to perk this up..but it is a lovely, bright and flavorful slaw. I served it with spicey grilled country style boneless pork ribs & peach salsa and grilled corn on the cobb with chipotle/adobo butter. What a great meal. I used a 16 oz. pkg of pre-shredded cole slaw, 3 chopped green onions and some shredded carrots and then basically made the dressing as directed. Perfect! But it means that I used twice the amount of dressing. If I did 2lbs of cabbage I would double the dressing for amount of cabbage listed as I found the dressing perfect for 1lb of slaw. This slaw truly surprised me with intense flavor and appearance.

Quick, easy, and tasty. A few dashes of sesame seed oil really rounded it out nicely, though--highly recommended.

I love this coleslaw! I added some red pepper (for colour) and (as another reviewer did) some bean sprouts. I used 1/3 cup of cider vinegar and 1/3 cup of sugar because I was afraid there wouldn't be enough liquid, but there definitely is. Absolutely delicious and will be making this again!

Typically I don't follow recipes, more I let them guide me. This one was a great guide! I love that it is so light, and my lips are tingling a little. Will make it again for sure.

Love it. I use it on all slightly steamed vegetables, even salad.Wife hates it. Can't please everybody.

I forgot to say that I also used red cabbage - mostly because it's supposed to be so healthy, but then the coleslaw became visually stunning as well.

Have never given four forks before. What more can be said?

This was a great, simple variation on the theme of coleslaw, which is usually so bland. I think my head of cabbage (I used a red cabbage for the color) was a bit larger than 2 lbs, so I added more vinegar but kept the other ingredients the same. After sampling it, it seemed a little dry even still, so I added about 1.5 T light vegetable oil, which coated the cabbage and made the texture much better, in my opinion.

Man this is good! Looking for beautiful color? Use red cabbage, throw in a few fresh pea pods (chopped) and some been sprouts... AWESOME! Throw in some roasted peanuts for good measure, they are FANTASTIC in this recipe.

Made this as a side to the Peking Chicken Wraps from this site. A nice compliment. I loved the coleslaw, but added toasted sesame seeds, chopped peanuts and a little olive oil. Reminded me so much of a Thai spring roll. Yum! Will do again... so easy!

Always looking for low-fat recipes and this meets all the criteria for taste, ease of preparation and healthful. Definitely use fresh ginger. I prefer a somewhat drier slaw, so I don't use all the liquid. I have started adding a couple of tablespoons of olive oil because I like the texture and flavor, but it's not strictly necessary. Great recipe just as it's written.

This was fabulous, flavorful and healthy. I had a lot of cabbage and doubled the vinegar and sugar. I agree with the other reviewer that the ginger made the dish. The red pepper flakes made it, too

Excellent quick summer coleslaw. I used bagged coleslaw mix and substituted tabasco sauce for the red pepper, since I was out of the latter. Added the right amount of kick, but I would like to see how the red pepper ties in. Also, fresh ginger is key to the powerful flavor of this dish. A great alternative to the buckets of overly-creamy coleslaw you find at the supermarket.
