I've made this recipe many times over the years. I obviously love it, but I've found that although I find the flavors very subtle, if my guests don't LOVE fish, they usually do not love this dish.

This is a real spectacular lunch or dinner dish! It's an unusual presentation and flavors are great! A keeper!

A disappointment. Although this looked very pretty, I found the flavours just so-so, and was hoping for much better. It was easy to make, and the colours were good, but the taste profiles were not defined enough for me. There are better, prettier and (more importantly) tastier terrines out there...

Sorry folks, but I can't agree with the others. I thought it was extremely bland. I taste tested this prior to a formal dinner party I was having and am glad I did. I added cream cheese, heavy cream, more seasoning to no avail.

Absolutley fabulous! Made this for my mother-in-law's 50th birthday celebration and it was a hit -- it's beautiful, tastes great, and makes an ideal first course for a summer party. I served it with a cucumber dill sauce and that was a good accompaniment.

Wow! I took the cue from the reviewer in Seaside, Fl and followed her presentation idea. I was also short on time and served a store bought tsatsiki. Can't wait to make this again.

I made to serve as a cold lunch itme at my beachside cafe/restaurant. It is beautiful to look at and has a fresh seafood flavor. I used very large and sweet sea scallops and was careful to trim the salmon so that there was no trace of the dark (strong tasting) flesh found next to the skin. I would definitely make this again and my customers who ate it thought it was outstanding. I served it with a side of yogurt cucumber mint sauce (minus garlic.) The plate was garnished with cucumber slices, grated carrot and sliced roma tomatoes and fresh mint sprig. Great dish for a springtime event and easy to do ahead.
