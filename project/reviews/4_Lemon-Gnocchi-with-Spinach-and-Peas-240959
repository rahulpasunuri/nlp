I made a half recipe just for myself - I don't think a regular recipe would feed four people either. Followed it to a T except I added some diced bacon that I cooked in the oven at the very end, also I made sure to season the sauce before adding the gnocchi. Really yummy! I like the lemon. I'll definitely make this again.

We can't do dairy at our house, but I still wanted to try this recipe. We used coconut cream instead of the dairy cream and left off the parmesan cheese. It certainly tasted different because of the coconut cream, but it was a great combination of flavors just the same.

I had high hopes for this one after reading all of the glowing reviews. It was very easy to prepare but left me underwhelmed. It was just not that exciting, and not worth all that cream for something less than a "wow". If I were to make it again, I'd double the spinach and the peas to make it a little heavier on the veggies. The ratios in the recipe left me with a lot of pasta and not so many veggies. I'd also take the advice of other reviewers and scale back on the cream - use half and half or even light cream. I'm looking forward to seeing what it tastes like cold tomorrow, as it might make for a nice lunch dish.

I made this recipe as written. It was easy to make and delicious. My family loved it so much, they asked me to make it again the next night. I wouldn't say that it served 4 for a main course. Perhaps 4 delicate eaters. Three of us polished it off handily and wished for more. Next time I'll double it. This is definitely a keeper.

This was ridiculously easy, inexpensive, quick and delicious. I ended up adding more cream as I thought that there wouldn't be enough sauce (probably came pretty close to doubling it) and couldn't have been any happier (in our house cream=happiness). We couldn't find dry gnocchi so we used store bought "fresh" ones, though I think I am going to try to make my own next time. Otherwise followed the recipe pretty much to the "t". Seriously, Wednesday night just got a whole lot better.

I made this last night, I followed the recipe almost to the "T", I added a bit of milk to the cream (I didn't want to have dry gnocchi) and more lemon and lemon rind. I have to admit, I was a bit sceptical at first as I was tasting the sauce while making it and it seemed pretty bland, but I was proven wrong! this is a great and easy recipe. I would definately make it again!

This recipe produced delicious results and was quick and easy. It is my new go-to recipe for a lightning-quick week night or camping meal. It I made oregano chicken http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/Grilled-Chicken-with-Lemon-Garlic-and-Oregano-106742 as the protein to accompany it, and I think that the two dishes complimented each other nicely. I will definitely make this dish again.

I was not impressed. It was super easy and the lemon was a nice touch but it fell quite short for me. The flavors were just ho-hum and the Gnocchi did not quite fit with the lightness of the recipe. Certainly nothing to write home about. Even though it was super super easy, I don't think it is worth the time and I will not bother to make it again.

Freakin' fantastic, and super easy. I used half light cream and half skim milk, and I just used the zest and juice of a whole lemon rather than measure (admittedly, this was perhaps a tad too much lemon juice). This will definitely enter our regular menu rotation.

Simply scrumptious! Used Trader Joe's gnocchi and it cooked up perfectly plump and pillowly. Doubled the amount of cheese - so easy for a weeknight meal. Kids loved it. Served with the romaine and gorgonzola salad on this site. I thought about just adding the rest of the 3 oz of spinach in the bag - but hubs is a stickler for following the recipe. When I make it again - I will add the whole bag of spinach.

I will try this recipe, but I had to laugh when it specified to cook the gnocchi al dente.... Al dente means still crunchy, a term which is mostly used for pasta, but also veggies. Gnocchi are soft and cannot be al dente. Besides, nothing is easier than cooking gnocchi. You throw them in boiling water and when they come to the surface, they are ready. Remove them as they start to float.

Rating: 4
I loved this recipe! I used about a cup of parmesan so that the gnocchi was really coated and made sure to simmer down the sauce to make it thicker than it appears in the picture. Served it to my skeptical boyfriend who had never had gnocchi before and was told it was delicious. The combination of lemon, peas and spinach was light and summery- the perfect gnocchi dish!

I know how we all hate the reviews that involve changes but I'm going to post anyway! This dish was a life saver. I had to put dinner together quickly and I couldn't have asked for more. I used orecchiette pasta in place of the gnocchi because that's what I had on hand. Luckily I also had some white truffle oil on hand, too... so I drizzled it on top of the adult portions. Everyone loved it! A new go-to recipe! I can't wait to make it again. Delicious!

This was a great vegetarian recipe! Loved the flavors of the peas, spinach and creme. I doubled the recipe and had just the right amount for 5 people, so I think the original recipe probably serves closer to 2 if served as the only dish. I made my own gnocchi, which made the dish even tastier. Will definitely make it again!

This is yummy and easy to make! This is one of our new go-to weeknight recipes. I like the layors of flavor with the creamy, spicy, and sour. I added a little more crushed red pepper than the recipe called for but other than that I cooked it as written. It's a little heavy for an everyday meal but really nice once in a while.

An interesting change of pace...what made the dish, for me, was the lemon balanced by the "zip" of the red pepper flakes.

Timing is key when cooking the spinach and peas otherwise, it's really easy for the cream to dry out. I was afraid that the cream would curdle, but apparently the fat in the cream keeps it from doing so. The lemon, garlic, and cream create lovely bright taste all together.

The recipe was very simple but I did not like the dried gnocchi which definitely is not a good as fresh gnocchi. I also though that it could have used a little more cream as the recipe ended up a little dried out.

This was delicious! So simple and flavorful. The lemon flavor is very strong so adjust accordingly depending on your taste for lemon. This was the first time I tried gnocchi and the texture can be a little startling at first, just be sure not to overcook the gnocchi to avoid it getting too soft.

I can't give this a fork rating since I strayed so far from the original recipe. I used half cream, half lowfat milk, borccolini and spinach, and served over whole wheat penne. It came out delicious, so easy and fast! I also minced the garlic as someone else suggested, threw in a little chopped onion, and extra red pepper flakes. This is a good, basic staple that can be built on. Thanks Epicurious. Oh, and if you take the time to make gnocchi by hand- they are delicate and time consuming, but so worth it!

I am very appreciative of quick, good recipes, and this is one of the quickest. I used half and half as it had been used by other reviewers to apparently no ill effect, but I think using heavy cream would make it exponentially better. The lemon zest and juice are what make the recipe; the faintest hint of red pepper is also necessary, I think. I increased the amount of spinach and half and half; it made three main course servings. I will make this again.

The best gnocchi ever! I made homemade sweet potato gnocchi and it was a huge compliment to the sauce. Not too spicy or too sweet... just right.

Followed the recipe except used half and half instead of the heavy cream. Delicious. I did use a few tablespoons of the pasta water, so be sure to save a bit when you drain the gnocchi. I served this as part of a meal, as a second course after the soup and before the fish, and the amount was perfect for four people. I think this recipe would serve 2 - 3 if it is the primary dish you are serving.

Delicious and easy recipe. Did not use the reserved pasta water, but rather upped the cream. Also used a bit less gnocchi than listed. Turned out great. As a main dish, the portions serve closer to two than four. Will definitely make again.

Excellent quick recipe! I doubled the lemon juice (half a lemon) and pan-fried the fresh gnocchi. Not sure why it says smashed garlic - mince it so you don't have to remove it. Next time I would add more spinach and peas as I didn't have a side-dish, and as such, it only served 2. Top with fresh ground black pepper and extra parmesan.

We just made this for supper and we LOVED it. Probably helped that we were really hungry, but honestly, the flavours were awesome together. I sauteed some shrimp in garlic, butter and lemon juice then put it aside before doing the cream sauce, then added the shrimp back in to finish cooking at the end. It added a nice element. Definitely adjust the red pepper and the lemon to your taste (don't be afraid to use more!). Also, pan-fried gnocchi adds a nice crunchy texture. I added it to my recipe box as soon as we finished eating to use again.

I loved this dish. Sort of eyeballed the measurements and added chopped fresh tomatoes and more red pepper at the end. And I'm sure I used more cream (about to expire). Another change - my local grocer was out of baby spinach, so I had to settle for frozen chopped (used about 1/2 the package). This is a recipe that can be tampered with, for sure. But I wouldn't skip the lemon!

I made this, not bad, but not impressed. My all time favourite potatoe gnocchi (fresh) recipe was given to me by my Italian boss in Monte Carlo: cook gnocchi till float, add mascarpone, some cream, salt, pepper and muscade. Yummy!

This recipe is delicious, it has become one of my favorites. It's one of my emergency meals, since I always have gnocchi around, and peas and spinach in the freezer. Easy and versatile! You can throw in whatever you happen to have on hand...mushrooms, bacon, asparagus, chicken...just don't omit the lemon! The lemon is what makes this dish special. I tried it once with creamed spinach since I didn't have any leaf spinach and I don't recommend that either.

I followed the recipe exactly since it was the first time I've made it and it was good, but a little bit bland. I ended up adding more red pepper flakes to my plate.

Great recipe! Mad a few mods that worked out great: - Added the peas a few minutes later than instructed to preserve texture. (I found that there was too many peas before serving so strained about 1/3 out... next time i'll use half of what the recipe recommends) - Added a bit more cream as it was evaporating pretty quickly. (used less of the water at the end to compensate). - I preferred more lemon juice so added a tsp more than instructed (added a bit more of a zest). All in all, a great one and pretty easy to do.

I served this as a side dish with the Lemon Parmesan Encrusted Chicken. The two dishes complemented each other well. Both have with light, fresh, summery lemon-parmesan flavor. I wasn't sure about the consistency of the peas, spinach, and gnocchi in this dish, but it turned out fabulous. Thank you for the tip of using fresh spinach, instead of frozen. I lightly wilted the spinach to soften it but still leave it appearing bright green and fresh. I will make this dish again.

Rating: 4
I skipped the cheese--as someone in an earlier review noted--the possibility that it would trend toward the alfredo led me to that decision. The one thing I'd add to the recipe is time--15 minutes of settling time really improved the dish--the flavors blended, the lemon stepped back a bit. And then--as they say in France--voila! It was sublime.

Rating: 4
I absolutely love this recipe. Definitely go light on the parmesan or it will be too alfredo-y. The spicy, tangy cream is just delicious and great with the cushy texture of the gnocchi. I added bacon which was a nice extra dimension. I can imagine this would be good with tortellini.

Fantastic! My husband said it was the best gnocchi that he's ever had :-) However, the next time I make this, I will sautè the garlic a bit before adding the other ingredients to simmer and slightly increase the hot red-pepper flakes.

I made this with a bag of fresh gnocchi from Costco. It was 2 lbs fresh so I doubled rest. It came out great, but there was a little too much sauce, so I would make 1.5 on the rest of the ingredients for 2 lbs fresh pasta. I read the other 80 reviews first to see if anybody specified how much fresh gnocchi would be used instead of 1 lb dried... Anyhow, this is a great recipe and now we have posted how much fresh pasta to use...

I must have done something wrong because this dish was TERRIBLE for me. I am a good cook too and I rarely hate dishes but this one was completely off base. I did make the gnocchi from scratch so they might have been softer than the storebought (De Cecco) brand but even the sauce I did not like at all. The peas were a strange texture with the spinach and lemony kind of bland cream sauce. I will not make this dish again.

Andrea Albin: Respect. This dish rules. I went a little heavier on the red pepper, and I used light cream. I agree with Mr. 9/17/08 that it doesn't make 4 servings. I doubled everything and still had only about 5 [hearty] servings.

Absolutely delicious. I used evaporated milk rather than heavy cream as others have recommended (thank you!), used fresh gnocchi because that was all that was available at the store, and may have used a bit more than 3 oz of spinach, but otherwise kept everything the same.

Delicious. Added crumbled bacon and used whole milk instead of heavy cream.

This was delicious. I followed the recipe with the exception of using fresh peas (about 1 lb of fresh peas makes 1 cup of shelled peas). I doubled the recipe for four servings as other's suggested. Served for vegetarian friends, very impressive and very easy.

The reviews here were spot on. The combination of the lemon and red pepper makes for a delicious and exotic taste. This recipe is quite simple too.

Fabulous and soooo easy. Great addition to your week night cooking collection. I substituted fat free evaporated milk for the heavy cream (a weight watchers trick) and it tasted great! Making it for the second time tonight.

This is fabulous and so easy! It's becoming our default way to use the CSA spinach (baby and regular). The combination of lemon and red-pepper gives this a nice zing and a little kick. It only feeds 2 of us, so I would double if looking to serve 4.

So quick and easy, and very delicious. I think the cream sauce and gnocchi are a great combination. I used regular spinach torn into pieces instead of the baby spinach. A great weeknight meal, but tasty enough to impress guests!

Loved this. The lemon really gives it that extra kick. It was so simple to make and delicious. I have to say though that I made the recipe as indicated and it only fed two (granted, one of us was a VERY hungry guy). But I wouldn't count on this to feed four adults. You'll probably need to double the recipe.

I made this last night thinking my boyfriend and I would love it, we love all the ingredients. Not so much. I don't think a cream sauce is the best bet.

This recipe was excellent. I love peas with pasta. The peas give a little bit of a sweet taste and the spinich makes it a little tart, excellent combination. Next time I may add some pine nuts.

So easy to do and so good. I also used twice the lemon juice (1 TBSP) which I think worked well.

Rating: 4
Very good and ridiculously simple to prepare. The lemon really brings out the peas; I'd add a little more juice than the recipe suggests. And I agree with one of the other reviewers about letting it sit for just a bit before digging in - it mellows out some of the red pepper's heat and the gnocchi really absorbs the flavors! A+

This dish was really easy to make. My husband loved it. A great weeknight dish. We will pass this recipe along to friends.

LOVED this. Nice fresh, springy flavors, but still appropriate for winter with the light cream sauce. Left out the spinach and it was still great.

Wow. I was really impressed by the combination of flavors. I will certainly make again. I also used old frozen spinach from the freezer and it turned out fine.

Easy, tasty, healthy weeknight meal. I used fat free evaporated milk instead of cream and didn't miss it. Also used frozen chopped spinach since it's all I had. Made the dish even easier.My 4 year old loved it.

Very, Very good! I served it with grilled salmon and even my 7 and 9-yr olds loved it. I grill salmon and serve it with plain white rice a lot (My family LOVES plain food), but my family didn't complain when I served this instead. REALLY good!

This recipe was okay but I thought that the spicy and the garlic overwhelmed the cream and gnocchi. I also didnt think that gnocchi was the right choice for this. Further, I didnt really taste as much lemon as I was hoping. It might of been better with whole wheat penne or something. Overall very quick recipe though and generally tasty for a quick somewhat fancy dinner.

Gee, I hate to be the grinch, but this recipe just didn't work for us. Seemed that the garlic flavor overwhelmed the delicate notes of the other ingredients - and generally, we are garlic addicts. Maybe just one of those days...

simple, delicious, quick, easy! this may be one of my new favorite week-night recipes. next time i will omit the peas, i just feel that peas and spinach do not belong together. okay you can't go wrong with parmesan, cream, spinach and gnocchi... but i would never have thought of adding lemon. the lemon gave this dish the real kick!

Rating: 4
This recipe is fabulous; we add chicken to it, and that helps to make it more filling for those with big appetites. I've tried it with tortellini, too, but the gnocchi is so much better!

Rating: 4
Delicious and a nice change from traditional winter soups and stews. And very quick to prepare. I sauteed the garlic (2 cloves) in a little butter beforehand, and used half and half instead of cream. Let it sit for a few minutes before you eat it to let the flavors sink in a bit.

Rating: 2
I really did not like this. Whoever thinks that potatoes (the main ingredient of gnocchi)and lemon go together? I used low fat cream as some reviewers suggested and it completly seperated when the lemon was added. I think I'd just as well make an alfredo with peas than the lemon. Won't do again!

Rating: 3
No great shakes but how can you go wrong with anything that has cream and Parmesan cheese in it? I added sliced mushrooms, doubled the garlic and added extra lemon juice.

Rating: 4
This dish was fantastic! Everyone loved it and one person even licked the plate. How often do you find recipes that actually make frozen peas sing? The creaminess and the lemony citrus garlic hints meld really well together, and the colors were lovely. The only problem was that even with only three people we were still semi-hungry afterwards (I did sub half and half for the cream, so next time I'm definitely going for full-fat)

Another Four forks here. And another example of using decent ingredients in a simple dish to good effect. A combination that works very well, and so easy too. To ksowards, just pull your husband's serving out before adding any peas, and make him eat his dinner alone while you finish cooking yours ;^)

I'd rate this dish higher if possible. Wonderful flavors, wonderful complements, wonderful wonderful. I added more red hot pepper flakes, as me and my boyfriend like a lot of heat in our dishes. I also ended up adding more cream as I realized when I started cooking that I bought the wrong kind of spinach (I bought frozen chopped ) and the spinach kept soaking up the cream. I also used nearly 1/2 cup of grated parmesan--some in the dish and some for garnish. It probably wasn't necessary, but... The lemon flavor is just perfect. My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough of this dish. I might even say that it might even be better the next day as left-overs--a toss-up as it was so delicious tasting it for the first time, and such a gourmet-like treat at work the next day.

Very easy and absolutely delicious. If your grocery store doesn't carry dried gnocchi you might have luck in the frozen aisle.

My friend really loved it, would totally make it again. It's really easy too. I was surprised by how little time it took to make, while still looking like an elaborate dish.

Does anyone think it would be okay to omit the peas? I love them, but my husband is not a pea fan. Maybe just make him push them to the side?

This was the first time using store-bought gnocchi. It was delicious. I love the flavor combination. Very tasty and satisfying!

Rating: 3
The was delicious, and quick and easy. I was surprised at how well the flavors melded. I normally make homemade gnocchi, but I just didn't have time for this recipe, and it didn't matter. The store-bought kind worked beautifully (to my surprise). I agree with another reviewer, who said you should double the lemon. I did that, and still felt it could have used even more lemon flavor. But other than that, a perfect 10 minute dish.

Made this for dinner and we LOVED it. It went together in minutes using fresh gnocchi from Trader Joe's. Great easy, flavorful dinner.

This was very quick and easy! I didn't have red pepper flakes although my dinner mate would have liked the spice. Still turned out lovely using fat free half and half (wha!?). The salty pasta water added some body. We added some extra garlic and fresh basil (towards the end) as well. Next time I'm going to add some mushrooms to complement the spinach, peas and cream.

I made this for New Year's eve 2007. I liked the red pepper flakes. I didn't use the hot pasta water. There was enough sauce but they were not swimming in it.

followed recipe exactly. the sauce was very good and very easy to make. highly recommend making the gnocchi from scratch (not as hard as you would think - try the recipe http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/101335 ) because the whole dish comes together perfectly with fresh gnocchi. the sauce did have a subtle lemon flavor, if you would like more of a lemon flavor, then i would suggest adding double the lemon juice. Excellent

My fiance and I loved this! I made it exactly as the recipe called for, exept doubled the garlic and lemon, and uded half and half instead of cream. We agreed it would be better next time if I add add some prociutto. Yum!

Excellent dish! I made 6X the quantity and substituted frozen cheese tortellini which I pan sauteed in butter and olive oil. Also, I used fresh spinach and added additional parmesan. I tasted this before adding the parmesan and was concerned that the hot peppers were too much, but the addition of the cheese and the melding of the flavors made the hot peppers fade to a faint undertone that even small children liked. Fabulous recipe.

We made this as a first course for christmas eve and it was a huge hit. From my 8 year old to my 88 year old grandmother everyone loved it. I would increase the lemon just a bit next time, but otherwise it was superb, and incredibly quick and easy.

This dish was easy, yet elegant and best of all, a little bit different! I would definitely prepare this dish again.

Made it yesterday for Christmas dinner. Excellent combination of simple ingredients. Pan searing the gnocci is a great suggestion below - it was mushy. I had to pour off the sauce last minute and thicken with cornstarch and more cheese. Definitely neeeded no pasta water. Try this recipe!

Three plus forks. Absolutely will try again, perhaps with more vegetables, whole wheat gnocchi and likely with lower fat, lower calorie "cream." Will explore fat free half-and-half (an oxymoron, no?) as one reviewer suggested. Aromatic, filling, and can be made in adavance... will definitely be a keeper.

Couldn't believe how yummy and quick. Mind you, my silly little neighborhood grocery didn't have gnocchi(!!!) so I grabbed a bag of frozen cheese ravioli. Figured it was pretty fat pasta. I'll do it right next time. But it was pretty fabulous this way too.

I found this recipe to be easy as well. I actually made gnocchi from scratch and then pan-seared it in some butter and added some lemon thyme. The little crunch of the seared gnocchi with the lemon was the coup d'etat of the evening.

Very good and easy to make. Made it twice. Once with Land O' Lakes fat free 1/2 and 1/2 and once with heavy cream. Couldn't tell the difference -- both delicious.

This was really good, I added a few too many chili flakes to it so it was spicy but the flavors were amazing and it was a perfect meal for me and my vegetarian girlfriend. We ate all of it but it would be great as four servings if they were smaller as part of a multi course meal. I loved it and best of all it took only 20 minutes from starting prep to serving!

I followed the recioe exactly. It was so pretty, easy to make and as delicious as it looked. It even won over someone who doesn't normally like spinach. The only thing is that it was too good to extend to 4 people. Three servings, I would say.

Rating: 4
Easy and great tasting. Might suggest letting it rest 2-3 minutes before serving, as second helpings seemed to have more fully infused lemon taste that was a plus. Pepper flakes are also essential, mine were from a new bottle and I'd tend to add a little more if they were older.

I made this recipe word for word and found it to be very good. Pre-packaged gnocchi is just that...pre-packaged. But for a quick dinner my husband and I thought it was great. I would make it again!

Being the first reviewer, I tried my level best to stick to the recipe; the biggest change I made was to use lobster ravioli from Trader Joes instead of gnocchi. I initially didnt add the ½ cup of pasta cooking water to the sauce since I didnt want to dilute it, but found that the pasta soaked up a lot of liquid and the cooking water was ultimately necessary. The lemon juice & zest do add a lovely flavour at the end. Although this is not a glamorous recipe, its tasty, simple and extremely quick for a weeknight dinner (the sauce came together in 10 minutes).
