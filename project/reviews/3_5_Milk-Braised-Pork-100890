This recipe is great. It works fine with the ingredients as given, but I put a little butter in with my vegetable oil. Other than that, the success depends on the quality of the ingredients and making sure you brown the meat well in the initial stages. I find about 3 minutes per side (do not disturb while browning) over medium high heat works well. You can add sage, garlic, and/or lemon zest and things like that if you want, but it really isn't necessary. If you have good pork and good milk, it's great with just salt and pepper. If you don't like the curdled appearance at the end, just zip the sauce with an immersion blender. This recipe is simplicity at its finest.

My family LOVES this recipe! My kids call it sloppy johns because we serve the meat smothered in the gravy on hamburger buns. I am making it tonight and couldn't find where I had written down the recipe.

I did not enjoy this at all. The meat was totally dried out and the sauce had a smell that was unappealing. I am a big fan of Marcella Hazan and though I would love this recipe but it was a dud for me.

We thought this was very good. I jazzed up the recipe a bit by using some ideas from another pork recipe. Before browning the pork, we rubbed it with salt, pepper, ground fennel seed and sage. After browning the pork, we sauteed some shallots and then added a bay leaf, a little more fennel and a few capers to the milk. Quite delicious. We will make this again. (Economical too)

This is similar to a recipe that I have made off and on for 20 years. I continue to find the curdling of the milk over-the-top unattractive. So I use an emulsifier and have a nice creamy gravy. My old recipe calls for rosemary, garlic, bay leaf and a dash of cinnamon and cloves. It is very good.

Good, but rather bland and homely. Would add more flavor next time (garlic, shallots, herbs, etc.). The "sauce" came out tasty (I think only because I browned the meat on all sides) but lumpy and not at all attractive.

Would possibly make this again. I had a big problem, though: the milk curdled after only 10 minutes, leaving behind a watery sauce - more like curds and whey. I did not have any lemon or an acid in the dish, so I'm not sure why it would curdle. Any ideas? Perhaps heat was too high?

Used a well-marbled roast, and added shallots, like the other reviewer suggested. It turned out great! (Though I did have some reservations -- it does look too easy and uses so few ingredients!). The only problem I had was washing my pot afterwards. I used a stainless steel pot, and had a hard time scrubbing off burnt milk. Any ideas, anyone?

Rather than using a shoulder/butt (tasty but doesn't slice well), I had my butcher cut a well marbled roast from the large end of the loin. As suggested by other reviews, I was tempted to add onions/garlic/shallots to the sauce but a "Marcella groupee" talked me out of it - the result was a wonderfully nutty, deep brown sauce, though it does need to cook much longer than the 1 hour stated, and be certain to really brown the meat on all sides.

Very good. I followed advice of other reviewer using proscuitto, rosemary and shallots. It came out tasty and tender and was a big hit with dinner guests. I let it refrigerate at least overnight and cut the meat when cold. It was easier to get rid of the rather large amount of fat which had accumulated.

I have made this before it appeared in Gourmet. I sauteed shallots,proscuitto and rosemary after the meat, and then cooked it. Very tender and tasty.
