This was tasty but a little thin. I'd suggest using just 4 cups or even 3 1/2 cups of water, or perhaps uncovering the soup after the first half hour of cooking. An aside: I think I'll substitute beer for half the chicken broth next time.

It's a really simple resipe, no frills, but tasty, especially after the first day. As a vegetarian, i skipped the bacon and used vegetable broth, and also stepped up the cumin by a lot (i love cumin but find that it doesn't go a long way). I only partially pureed it to retain some texture, which was good.

Quite easy and good with in the black & white soup combo. However, if eaten by itself, it probably needs more spice. I took the advice of others and only blended half the beans. Good overall.

Not as spicy as I would have liked, but I would make it again. I've no experience to rate this recipe against another of the same dish, but when do it over again, I will leave half of the soup unprocessed so that it has beans as texture. I will also add something (perhaps chiles of some sort) to add some flavor.

I have to agree with Karin from Calif; NOT a good recipe - even with the addition of cilantro and creme fresh. We ate it, but I'll never make it again. I, too, wish I could find a good black bean soup recipe...

i have made this recipe twice now, and so far, everyone in my family loves it. we're from el salvador...so we're not used to this many ingredients in the soup (we use them all in different combinations and recipes, but never in bean soups). so it was with no little surprise that my father found it to be really delicious. i don't understand why some other cook didn't like it...i think for us this will be the recipe to repeat over and over it's so good.

This is my favorite black bean soup. The cilantro is the key. I have made this about once a month since it first appeared in Bon Appetit. I like to serve it with sour cream, also, and home made, deep-fried tortillas dusted with chili seasoning.

I have had some really good black bean soup in the past, but this recipe is horrible. I would not recommend it. The soup lacked spice, as it had no real taste. I am still in search of a really good black bean soup recipe, but this just didn't cut it.

I, too, leave some beans whole for a better texture. I omitted the bacon and used 1/2 beef broth instead of all chicken broth. I also added some jalapeno and a smidgen of chipotle. I will put one chipotle chile in this from now on. It is very good both alone or next to the excellent cheese soup.

I really liked this soup. I also really like garlic so I added another clove or too and it went really well with the rest of the soup. To spice it up a bit I put in a little less than 1/4tsp of crushed red pepper flakes.

Good, easy soup. I made it even faster by using canned black beans (Goya- in Mexican section- is better than Progresso). I went on a previous tip to only puree some of the beans, for better texture. I only cooked about half of the beans with the other ingredients, then pureed it, then added the rest of the beans, and simmered a while. I did not use any cilantro, since we aren't fans, but instead swirled a little sour cream on top of each bowl. Really good! All of those who ate it, loved it! Definitely one to be made on many chilly nights!

This is a simple and tasty recipe. I left some of the beans whole, which I recommend- it makes it heartier. Also, rice goes well with this soup rather than meat if you're trying to stick to a lower budget or if you're a vegetarian. The cilantro can be very strong, so if you're not a big cilantro fan, just add a pinch. Eat with fresh warm flour tortillas. It's wonderful!

A very good soup with a few additions. If you use water boost the flavor with chicken boullion to taste. Season to taste (salt and pepper) after adding boullion. Keep the amount of broth the same. I added some kilbasa (I like the Hillshire Farm brand). It really is good once you do some fine tuning.

This soup is great...especially in the winter months. Nice and hearty with a glass of wine and some great bread!

I thought that this was really strange soup the first time I made it. In reviewing the recipe I realized that it took 3 cloves of GARLIC--not 3 cloves. With that correction I made it again and found it fabulous
