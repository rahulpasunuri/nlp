Hands down the best tourtiere I've made or tasted. I have a very generous 9in pie dish, and I would say I was a tad short on filling. It was exceptionally delicious, however, it looked like a mess once served. As long as I've been making these pies, the one thing I've learned (which I didn't do this time) is to make it the day before and re-heat. It's simply too crumbly if you try and serve the same day.

This pie is probably the best thing I've ever made in twenty-plus years of cooking. It compared favorably with the tourtières I ate growing up in northern New England and it was well worth the two-day odyssey of cooking for my family and me. The pork shoulder made the house smell amazing as it cooked, and so did the finished pie. We skipped some of the cooling times, especially toward the end, and the results were still divine. My pork shoulder was more like 2 1/2 pounds when I started, so I trimmed away a pound of it, including a big slab of fat, and made the rest into breakfast sausage for later. The pastry and filling are more than ample for a ten-inch Pyrex dish. If I hadn't, quite frankly, sampled liberally from both the pastry and the filling as I cooked, I probably would have used a larger springform pan to hold everything. Either way, it you're feeding any more than four people there's no need to worry about leftovers. This pie is impossible to stop eating as long as you've got the tiniest unfilled nook or cranny left in your belly.

Excellent. I have been making tourtiere on Christmas Eve for many years, always with ground pork. The addition of shredded pork shoulder really gives it a lovely texture. The pastry was delicious, but I had to add at least 3/4 cup of ice water (triple what the recipe calls for). Also, with the extra meat and pastry, I made a small additional pie that I spiced with chopped roasted green chiles-- not so traditional, but just excellent.

In the midst of making this. Looks like its going to be amazing! Doubled recipe because I am going to try freezing one. Has anyone else tried this?

A show stopper. Did this in one day, but yes, 2 days would be easier. Followed recipe exactly, but used a 10 inch pyrex pie plate, and that worked just fine. Watch the liquid when braising the pork in the oven for 2 hours. I used a heavy Le Creuset dutch oven and there was no liquid left after the 2 hours. So I deglazed the pot with 1/2 cup of water and added that to the shredded pork.The final product is not what I would call a "wet" pot pie with an oozing gravy, but neither would I call it "dry". It is simply luscious and the crust is heavenly. It served 6 people generously. And all 6 are happier today than yesterday.

Update to review. I meant to say I estimated the dough needed for a regular 9 inch pie plate, not a deep dish pie plate. I had more than enough dough for a normal sized pie and the four pasties.

This recipe is outstanding. It is also time consuming because of all the cooling times. I started it late morning and ended finishing it the next day. Take the directions to mean not that is can be done the day before, but that it should be done the day before. I divided the dough into two mounds, estimating what would be needed for one for a 9in pie plate and the rest to make pasties. The pie made three meals for my husband and me and the remainder made four pasties, which I glazed with the egg wash and then froze for later use. A lot of work, but well worth the effort. I've always made my own pie crust following the Joy of Cooking directions. I didn't believe you could make a good crust in a food processor. Boy was I wrong. I followed the directions in this recipe and my husband said it was the best crust he had ever eaten. The only problem I has was that I have an old 8 cup Cuisinart and I had a bit of flour flying out of the bowl.

Absolutely delicious! This was a lot of filling so I used my 10" springform pan to bake. Added a bit of extra juice to moisten, and used allspice instead of cloves. No ground pork to be had at the market so I used ground turkey instead. It's great hot out of the oven, and maybe even better at room temperature. Will definitely be making this again.

I, too grew up in Canada, and on toutiere. I have converted a whole lot of South Floridians with my family's tourtiere, but this tourtiere was fantastic! Kind of like my old recipe was habitant and this is gourmet signeur! Absolutely excellent and worth every second of prep work. I used a rounded 1/8th tsp of both the cloves and the cinnamon and added a rounded 1/8 tsp of allspice.

Enjoyed all the cooks reviews and now considering making this.My ? is about the size of your pie pan. It seems like a lot of filling for the usual size 10" pie pan. Suggestions appreciated.

My husband loved this recipe! It was a very long process to make and I wasn't sure it was worth it to make it again but everyone's reaction to it ensured that it will be made again. The only thing I did different was with the extra drippings I made a gravy - I certainly think this enhanced it! Especially for those that were that thought it was too dry.

I have been making my French-Canadian grandmother's recipe for the past 30+ years. I now have a new favorite! This has taken our traditional Christmas favorite to a whole new level. I had a large pork butt, so I made 2--one for now and I froze one to enjoy later.

A pressure cooker cuts the pork prep down to less than 1/2 hour AND keeps the meat moist. Rather than buying a whole pork shoulder which is considerably larger than 1-1/2 lbs. I usually use pork tenderloin because one strip is just the right amount. If I'm pressed for time, I use hot Italian sausage for all the pork. This is a traditional Christmas brunch dish at our house.

Long preparation, but worth it, as the texture and flavor was wonderful winter fare.

Amazing! I followed the recipe and crust exactly except for adding back more juices from the braising b/c some reviewers commented that it was a tad dry. Mine was moist and delicious. Yes, it takes all day, but is definitely worth it and just takes pacing. Actual food prep time is little... it's just the braising, chilling, and chilling again and then a 2 hour cook and cool time that make it take hours. Plan ahead and go for it. We'll be enjoying this again this winter!

I have made many tourtieres over the years and this is one of the best. Growing up in a city which was predominately french canadian in the northeast, I have eaten this dish many times. It does take all day but is worth the time. I did however use ready made pie crust and still tasted very good. My husband who is french canadian descent loves it. I would suggest using 2 cups of chicken broth when cooking the pork shoulder.

Absolutely delicious! It was a time consuming recipe, but that wont stop me from making it again. I will just pre-braise ect. I made it all at one time and it was pretty much a day-long process! Things I did a bit differently that the recipe stated: I used 5 pinches of dried thyme since I had accidentally bought fresh tarragon... oops! I used premade pie dough because, let's face it, I'm not Super Woman!! I forgot to but ground pork, but my roast was bigger than it needed to be, so I took about a pound of that and minced it nice and fine, left the rest shredded. Other change I WISH I had made, adding a 1/2 cup of smoked gruyere would have been perfect because it was a *tad* dry. Still... absolutely yummy! I served it with olive oil roasted broccoli. It was delicious and I will make it again!

I loved this. Mine came out a bit dry, but that was likely user error since I wound up with more meat than called for and failed to adjust. I did, however, make the entire recipe from a pork shoulder, of which I ground some for the ground pork component and chunked the rest. Country style ribs would be an interesting cut to try here as well.

Comfort food at its' finest. I doubled the recipe and had enough filling for 4 pies. changed the cloves for ginger and added 1 lb ground beef. Slow cooked the pork shoulder in a crock pot.
