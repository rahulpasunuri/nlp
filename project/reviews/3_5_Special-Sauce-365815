I made this last year when I first read the recipe and it has been a favorite ever since. Adds a great zip to a burger.

Meh...Good but not spectacular. Too disturbingly like Thousand Island dressing for my taste. People liked it but there were no raves. Made as written and it was not too spicy for anyone. Probably won't keep this one.

I didn't add the adobo sauce because my children wouldn't have liked it and what I was looking for was your classic Big Mac/Thousand Island dressing. If that is what you are after this recipe hit the spot perfectly. I'm sure it's good w/ the adobo, just another time.
