I was somewhat disappointed with this recipe especially after all the rave reviews. I made it exactly as described with the exception of the cranberry compote (used sugared strawberries instead, but I can see how the cranberry would add a nice flavor). The stand out disappointments were the cinnamon and overall texture. The cinnamon offered a different take from most tres leches that I've had, but I didn't think it added anything spectacular. The consistency reminded me of a loaf of bran bread soaked in milk. Altogether the people I served it to said it was great, but I really didn't see it as a stand out dessert. Will probably use other tres leches recipes I've used in the past or just opt for a more memorable dish.

PS I used the traditional whipped cream as the topping, not the meringue.

I too skipped the compote and the meringue -- just the cake and the tress leches. It was super. Served it at a lunch BBQ at the end of the afternoon and got great reviews. Easy and good. Next time I might make a slightly bigger cake; there was enough tres leches mixture to spare. The rum was a nice touch.

The compote is unnecessary and not at all traditional. I don't think they even grow cranberries or walnuts in Nicaragua. The rest of the recipe is great!

Perfect! Followed the instructions exactly and this cake turned out exceptional. I made the meringue, even without a candy thermometer, it turned out beautifully and I think it is necessary. At our favorite latin restaurant they use maraschino cherries for garnish.

Overall this dish was worth the effort. Making it again I would make a few adjustments since 1) I found it generally too sweet 2) the nuts added nothing of benefit to the compote which was otherwise a triumph. A final comment would be that you should not attempt the Meringue unless you are quite familiar with the technique and have the right equip (sugar thermometer) as it simply will not work!

In all fairness, I can't rate the whole recipe because I didn't do the whole recipe. But... After looking at MANY pastel de tres leches recipes (and being a little surprised at how much they varied) I decided to go with this one for my first go round, which I was making for a party. I used the sponge cake (sans cinnamon, plus a little vanilla) with the milk syrup (sans the rum, plus a little vanilla). I used a whipped cream with just a hint of sugar and vanilla on the top of the cake. (Really needed to keep it simple!) We served it with beautiful, perfectly ripe blackberries. It was fantastic. I mean REALLY good. People loved it, and guests from Brazil and Mexico felt like they were at home. It is VERY RICH, but delicious, especially with the berries. The cranberry compote would compliment it wonderfully. In fact, I'm sure there are a thousand wonderful ways to personalize this cake and I will be trying some more of them, including the meringue/cranberry compote version here.

There should be a warning about the impossibity of success with this cake at high altitudes. The milk syrup is great, the cranberry compote not typical and unneccesary but the cake turns out a stcky, gooey, flat, unholy mess. Use any other cake for the base

I have made this cake 3 times now and it's amazing (and gets great feedback from guests). The Italian Meringue is lovely, but if you're nervous about making a softball syrup, you can always skip the meringue and use a layer of sweetened whipped cream instead. I've done both and both methods work well

I have been making this cake using this recipe as is. I have found it fool proof. It is devine. One of my most requested! I am intrigued by the use of coconut milk and may have to try that. Would probably leave out the cinnamon there. Make sure you are using all purpose flour and not cake flour.

I have used this recipe many times, but with a few alterations. The cake turns out perfect, but since traditional Tres Leche does not have compote or meringue...I don't include them. I use vanilla bean instead of vanilla extract. Highly recommend this recipe!

Just made it! Been searching for the "right" tres leches cake for years and this is it. It was surprisingly easy to make and just so delicious!

Absolutely fantastic, easy to make. The compote can easily be skipped. This compares only with the other best tres leches I have had, made by a Mexican chef who uses his grandmother's recipe.

Confused by all the mixed reviews I decided to trust the one from the pastry chef. Wow! Fantatic results. I'm usually not impressed by my own cooking but this one bowled me over. There is only one other place in town whose tres leches compares - and that chef uses his grandmother's recipe. This is a keeper.

This recipe doesn't work at 5,000ft, even with all the usual tricks. The milk sauce is fabulous and I'm going to try it with a different cake recipe.

I have to admit that this cake gave me big problems...I baked it way past the recommended time, maybe by 10 minutes, and it still wasn't done, and the center fell miserably. I also thought the cake was much too sweet. I ended up using the milk syrup with a boxed white cake...and substitued coconut milk for the heavy cream...4 forks for the syrup...1 for the cake.

Cook From Baltimore - I have a 10 x 3 inch springform pan. I think they sometimes come in a 3-pack at Walmart if you don't mind cheap pans. You get an 8, 9 and 10 inch. I'm going to try this recipe tomorrow.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday substituting the can's worth of heavy cream with cream of coconut milk. I think the coconut gave this cake another dimension of flavor. This is a very easy recipe and was well received. A little too sweet and soggy for my presonal taste but it came out better than other Tres Leches cakes that I've tasted before.

haven't made this yet and I want to but haven't seen a 10"x 3" cake pan like recipe called for......reviews sounded like people used all different sizes? don't know what to use??? I loved the tres leches cheesecake they took off menu at cheesecake factory.....big mistake.....

Skipped the compote and meringue (subbed fresh whipped cream) like many others. With that, the cake was so easy and so amazingly delicious. Cake was for the husband's birthday and he ate it up with a huge smile. Rich without being candy sweet. I'll make this again for sure.

This is an amazing recipe. I fell in love with this cake while traveling through South America, as it is served quite often there as a desert. The meringue and compote are excellent and should always be served with this recipe. They are wonderful and compliment this cake beautifully. I am a pastry chef and I would not change one thing in this perfect recipe. I make this cake often for dinner parties or when I have guests over and I have never had a bad review from it. Many people ask me for the recipe because they love it so much.

The 2 tablespoons of cinnamon was perfect. I was worred that I should have used less but it tasted great and went well with the rum. I used coconut milk instead of the heavy cream and evaporated milk and it came out so smooth (heavenly). Next time I will make the meringue. It feels naked without it but still tastes great. Also, I will add shaved coconut on top and coconut extract to the batter. This will be one of my signature desserts. I loved it.

This was a wonderful cake and quite easy. I only used 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I made it twice in a 9x9 pan had to cook less time about 34 minute. The cake will be very soaked and my husband didn't like that. The second time I made it I only use half rum milk syrup and served extra syrup on side. Every one loved the flavor it was the texture that through some people off. I used the extra syrup on coffee. I didn't use meringue I used whipped cream and forget the compote.

Like most others, I've skipped the Meringue and compote, and still love this cake. It's become a family birthday favorite. Topping with whipped cream works just was well.

I made this recipe, and it is absolutely delicious! I mad a few adjustments to the cake though: One teaspoon of cinnamon as opposed to the two it calls for. Also, I added one teaspoon of vanilla, and 5 tablespoons of rum as opposed to the two it calls for (it gave it the perfect amount of the delicious rum flavor). The merengue was way to light and bland for this creamy flavor rich cake so I made a whipped cream topping consisting of: 1 cup (236 ml) heavy whipping cream that is ultra pasteurized 1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 1 tablespoon (14 grams) granulated white sugar. After it was frosted I sprinkled it with a little bit of cinnamon and garnished it with walnuts and voila! A very authentic delicious cake to die for!

I made this recipe yesterday and everyone just loved it. I loved it too. It probably needed a little more syrup. Next time I will ommit cinnamon as it darkened the batter and I want to enjoy the whitness of the syrup. I will try topping it with fresh fruit next time.

This is one of the best Tres Leches recipes I've found. I have lost count of the times I've made this. The rum really adds a great touch. I will usually add slightly more than the 2 TBS therecipe calls for and I use regular dark rum. I have never done the compote part of the recipe. It sounds quite good but I have to say the tres leches stands on its own just fine.

The cake turned out great! However i will put a tiny bit less cinnamon and more evaporated milk than condensed..it was a bit sweet for me. But my guests thought it was to die for --and i did it exactly as the recipe said.

Made this for my boyfriend's family and they LOVED it. I made the recipe as directed except omitted the meringue and compote in favor of more traditional cake. I did forget to add the vanilla to the syrup - but it wasn't missed. I might even add a little more rum next time around. This will be my go-to tres leches recipe from now on. We really liked the cinnamon (I had considered omitting it because of the unfavorable reviews but it was fantastic). Another great variation would be to substitute coconut cream for sweetened condensed milk and leave out cinnamon and I'll try that next. I used an 8 by 11.5 inch pyrex baking dish and it DEFINITELY needed more than the 40 minute baking time. It's ok for the sponge cake to be a bit dry before you add the syrup, it just absorbs more! The perfect end to a traditional Mexican meal - or any meal!

I followed this recipe exactly as published. I was disappointed and would not make again. I did not like the cinnamon, meringue or the cranberry compote. Also, there was not enough milk. If you want to make a traditional Tres Leches, find another recipe.

I make this cake regularly, though I use a large can of coconut cream (not the sweetened kind) in place of the heavy cream and evaporated milk. I also omit the rum. The ccocnut adds a richness that can't be beat!

I made this cake for my birthday and although some here didn't like the cinnamon- I loved it! I thought it made it complete with the rum milk syrup and the peaches I put on top- a perfect combination. I ended up using about half or a bit more than half of the rum milk syrup recipe, only because I didn't have a lidded plate for the cake when I poured all the liquid on top. The cake was excellent- not mushy and I would defintely make it again!

What did I do wrong...our elevation here is 6100 ft.--that may have had something to do with it. Ended up using a boxed white cake mix & the WONDERFUL rum/milk syrup recipe. It worked out fine, but puzzled by the cake disaster. Any suggestions?

Two more things -- definitely use a plate with a lip because the liquid does seep out of the cake a bit. Secondly, I used a 10 inch Springboard pan and the 40 minute cook time was perfect. I didn't have parchment paper, but after greasing & flouring the pan, the cake did not stick at all.

I made this cake using the advice of the first person who posted -- I omitted the cinnamon and covered the cake with fresh whipped cream (heavy cream + powdered sugar + a little vanilla), strawberries and peaches. It was, very possibly, the best dessert that I've ever had! My guests raved about it, and I was really thrilled with how it turned out.

I made this cake without the cinnamon and added more vanilla (1tbsp) and a lot more rum (1/3 c) than called for in the recipe, then covered the whole thing in whipped cream and sliced peaches and strawberries. It was pretty much the most delicious thing ever, everyone wants the recipe.

Wow! Very authentic... Just omit the cinnamon... it's definitely a keeper.

Very very close to get the 4 forks. I ommited the cinnamon, pour the liquid very carefully and left the cake soaking overnight, and got a very moist cake, except for the center which didn't absorb the liquid. Anyway it got rave reviews and disapeared from the table in no time. People kept asking me how did I make it.

I loved this recipe and so did my boyfriend, who is from Argentina, and misses his mom's Tres Leches. He said it was better than hers(I believe it because she does not put rum in the liquid, and let's face it the rum makes this recipe) For those of you who felt there was too much liquid I would suggest after the cake cools to put it in a round dish with a lip. That way the liquid does not flow all over the place and the cake really has a chance to absorb the liquid. Also I noticed that the time recommended for baking was 40 min. I had to only cook mine for about 30, so really keep an eye on it while baking and make sure you do not over bake.

I made this cake for a hardcore, Mexican theme potluck. The cake itself was simple to make, but in a rectangular metal baking pan it only took 20 minutes to cook. After it cooled I slowly added the milk mixture about 1/4 cup at a time, allowing the cake to absorb the milk in between. I also let it still in the refridgerator overnight. This produced a very moist, wet cake. It still retained it's cake qualities rather than turning to mush, and prevented too much excess liquid at the bottom of the dish.

My new favorite tres leches. Baked and served in a 13x9 pyrex pan. All the liquid was absorbed. Also, opted for a whipped cream topping instead of the sugary meringue. Perfection!

so sorry!My review was for a different Gourmet recipe with the same name. Here is the recipe I used to great result: Preheat to 350. Butter 1 8" square pan, line with wax paper, butter again and flour lightly. Milk syrup: 2 14-oz cans sweetened condensed milk, 1/2 c heavy cream, 1/2 c milk, 1/4 c unsweetened coconut milk (not cream of coconut), 1/3 c rum. Whisk all together, reserve 1/3 cup of mixture for garnish. Cake: 1 stick unsalted butter, cut into pieces; 1/2 t vanilla; Sift together 1/4 c flour,1/4 c cornstarch and 1/4 t salt. Set aside 5 large eggs room temp; 1/2 c sugar. Heat butter until golden brown, transfer to bowl to cool, then add vanilla. Heat eggs and sugar in a bowl set over simmering water, whisking until tepid. Remove bowl from heat, bat eggs at high speed until thick, pale, and tripled in volume. Sift flour mixture over eggs, folding in gently. Fold butter mixture gently into batter, spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until springy and top is golden, 15-17 minutes. Cool in pan 5 minutes. Run a knife around the edges and invert cake into another pan. Remove wax paper, prick cake all over with toothpick, pour syrup all over, press gently to saturate cake. Cover with plastic wrap and chill 4 hours or up to 2 days. Drizzle reserved syrup over each serving, serves 6.

To the cook from Jamaica Plain - I haven't made this one, but other tres leches recipes suggest poking the cake all over with a fork. That might help it absorb more of the liquid.

Thanks so much to C. Barone from Boston, MA for the tip not to overcook the sponge cake. After baking and cooling the cake, I poured the rum sauce over it slowly, starting from the outer edges and working in towards the middle. The cake soaked up all the sauce and I could have put in more. I skipped the meringue and the compote, and the cake still tasted great. (I used raspberry syrup just for fun but it wasn't needed either.)

We also couldn't figure out whether we liked the cinnamon, but the merengue worked perfectly, and the cranberry stuff - which i almost didn't make - ended up being the perfect accompaniment. It was a little sour next to a very sweet cake. One thing I couldn't figure out - I was only able to add about half the liquid because it was literally seeping out the sides and down into the plate, and yet when we ate it, it wasn't quite as moist as it should've been...

I have have a similar recipe without the rum. The rum really adds. This is so moist you can't help but love it.

I found this cake to be quite soggy, even after boiling the milk mixture (as per a similar recipe in Gourmet magazine) for about 15 minutes. I also used 1/4 cup of rum for more flavour and used whipped cream and sliced mango for the topping instead of the meringue and cranberry compote. Some people liked it, but I don't think I will make it again. I think a nice summer fruit pavlova would have been easier and better.

This cake didn't really come out- the recipe doesn't really work the way described- we had to leave it in the original pan and let it soak up the liquid which was way too much- the first night it was great- but the next day AMAZING it got better! I'm wondering if this will work with smaller cake pans so I'll try it again- so presentation is nothing at all- but flavor- people were raving- most said it was the best cake they had tasted...

Unbelievable response from my guests!!!! It smelled great, looked great and tasted like heaven. Now that everyone knows I can make this, my friends demand that I bring it to parties and dinners. Everyone saves room. I used raspberry syrup instead of the compote, swirling it on the plate before placing a piece of the tres leches onto it. This was very easy to make. I substituted a can of "table crema" for the heavy cream and did not use clove (I do not like them). The trick is to make sure you do not overcook the cake or it will not soak up the rum milk mixture very well. This was not hard to make and it is very "forgiving" (if you make a little mistake here and there, it still comes out terrific).

I reviewed a lot of recipes for this cake before making this recipe. I had the same problem with all recipes - too much liquid. This recipe should be changed to reflect about HALF the amount of liquid used. Some people liked the cinnamon in the cake, some didn't. The meringue was just so so.
