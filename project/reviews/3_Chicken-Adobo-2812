Fabulous. Great flavors and very healthy! I've made this recipe many times over the years. Grew up in Guam and had this dish once a week. This recipe rocks.

This may not be traditional-- but is nonetheless a tasty, quick and healthy dinner, which was much enjoyed by my family. Will make again.

I am half Cebuano and half German, so, not a purist, but there are essential flaws to the recipe. The onions are a great addition and now essential to me, so I'm glad I tried it your way. But the tomatoes are just wrong. There needs to be a lot more of both soy sauce and black pepper and always use dark meat. I even like it made with dark turkey meat or pork (traditional). It is great to experiment, but it is important to try the real thing. Unless you are improving a recipe, there is no point in changing it.

Here's the thing, food lovers-- yes, I am Filipino, so I know what I'm talking about here. The recipe, just looking at it, seems just fine. Only, it might be better to use chicken drumsticks or any part with a bone. It's tastier that way. The part that spawned debate and confusion, the tomatoes and onions, that's meant to be some kind of a side dish-- a condiment, if you will. Do not add it to the adobo while cooking. Mix the chopped tomatoes and onions with some coarse salt, if you like, and eat it along with the chicken adobo and white rice like you would with spinach (or other vegie) on some other meal.

can anyone who has actually made this recipe comment on how it turned out? I understand the fury and agony over lost traditions and whatnot, but geez... this is a recipe resource, not an anthropology forum. I just want to know if this tastes any good? Sometimes alteration and innovation spark great things. Otherwise we'd all still be eating just nuts and berries and bark.

Well, I think tomatoes and onions sound good. They would give the dish a different texture and a nice balance tothe salty sourness of adobo. I am not Filipino; my fiancee and his family are. I wonder if there would be this much backlash to a nouveau recipe for adobo if other Filipino food got recognition-- I don't think so. People just hold adobo sacred because it's the only one anyone outside a Filipino household ever experiences. Try to move with the times, people. Epicurious is not all about tradition-- it's about innovation.

what chicken adobo is this???? chicken adobo ABSOLUTELY DOES not use tomatoes. Maybe, sliced sweet raw onions to garnish a bowl of chicken adobo, but not to cook with it.... How dare you rape a delicious recipe by adding such ingrdients!

I'm not a filipine but my friend is and what was up with the tomatoes????

Ooops! Okay, so serving the tomatoes and onions on top isn't exactly authentic, but there are no set rules. We do serve tomatoes and cilantro as a side at our house -- but never on top. If you can find Silver Swan soy sauce, try it. It's a little sweeter and not quite as salty as Kikkoman.

WHAT???? TOMATO? ONION? I can assure you, chicken adobo DOES NOT have tomotoes or onions in them....ask anyone who has had chicken adobo...

There is only one kind of Chicken Adobo, the traditional kind loved by Filipinos and non-Filipinos alike. Not sure what the recipe was trying to accomplish, but it certainly is not traditional version. I agree...TOMATOES and ONIONS????? Wrong.

I agree with all the fellow Filipinos--TOMATOES?!--where did this recipe come from??? Certainly cannot be an authentic Filipino recipe!!! What a laugh! And the one reviewer says"great with basmati rice"! No Filipino eats basmati rice with adobo! Needs to be short grain sticky rice or at least jasmine rice. Hilarious!!!

Tomatoes in adobo? You've got to be kiddin'! I just wrote to say that this ain't the real traditional chicken adobo served in the Philippines. However, if you like tomatoes in your adobo, knock yourself out! Otherwise, try the other adobo recipes.

I made this with chicken breasts instead of drumsticks - It was great & easy. My whole family loved it (including my teenagers)!

TOMATOES?! - Yet another opinion from a fellow Filipina

I agree with mokkajoe: Who ever heard of Filipino adobo made with tomatoes? Served with tomatoes on the side maybe...

i am filipino and i've always cooked adobo and tomato is just not an ingredient for this dish! this is good though!

The ingredients for this recipe is somewhat " striped down ", probobly to make it more appealing for the American pallet. Traditionally, lean pork (cubed), finely ground pork liver, chicken stock (instead of water) and fresh sea salt would be included for a more authentic flavor. In any case, the recipe posted on this site will suffice. ;)

Wonderful dish. Great way to use the "old faithful" chicken. Great with Basmati rice.
