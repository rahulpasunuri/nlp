if i could give zero or negative forks, this recipe deserves it. it was awful, the soy sauce taste overwhelms everything so you have a mouthful of salty. soy sauce should be used as a condiment, not as the base of a sauce. my instinct told me not to follow the recipe to the letter, but i did and the result was bad.

This is definitely not a traditional Japanese dipping sauce for zaru soba (cold soba noodles with dipping sauce). Search out cold soba recipes employing dashi stock and bonito flakes for the real deal. While I appreciate that Parade must use recipes that have easy-to-find ingredients, the hunt for authentic flavors is worth it: on a hot summer day, this is an ideal light lunch (just not this version of it).

Soba noodles taste best when acompanied with toppings. For regular Soba noodles try: Grated Daikon (japanese turnip), shreded Nori seaweed, dried bonito flakes (Katsuo boshi) and scallops (negi) acompany with MenTsuyu sauce and wasabi. For green tea Soba noodles: Thinly sliced beef stirfried with soysauce sugar and sake, beaten eggs (no salt added) cooked as a thin layer on a frying pan and once cooled sliced in to strips, scallops and Nori Seaweed. acompani with watered down Mentsuyu sauce. Enjoy!!!!
