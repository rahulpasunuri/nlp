This was one of the two dozen kinds of cookies I baked for Christmas this year. They turned out well and look pretty on a plate full of cookies.

I baked these delicious cookies for a school project and i think they are absolutely worth it! It was the first gourmet food I have made and it turned out perfect. Definitely gets four forks!

I've made these several times now, using Peach St. Dalfour jam. They're incredible. They're very simple to make. I think that because the recipe does have relatively simple ingredients, the freshness of the lemon peel and quality of the butter and flour are very important, as is kitchen temperature. Never let the dough get warm enough that the butter melts enough to become greasy. Just use a good, rich butter. I also use baker's ultrafine sugar. But I'm telling you, with the best ingredients, you can't lose with this one.

Very attractive but otherwise entirely unremarkable. Not really worth all the labor.

Cookies were ok/good - didn't have any specific taste ie lemon,hazelnut. The apricot jam dominated.
