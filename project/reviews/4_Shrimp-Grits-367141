This was quite a tasty recreation of one of my favorite southern restaurant treats. I made this recipe pretty close to as written but used white old fashioned grits instead of yellow and yellow sharp cheddar cheese instead of white and I think the color still came out looking just right. I also substituted a chipotle pepper in place of a regular jalepeno and added about a teaspoon of chipotle mole to the grits. I also added just a smidgeon of heavy cream to the shrimp sauce at the very end. I followed everything else pretty closely but forgot to put the tarragon on at the end. It was still quite delicious. Seems kinda hard to mess-up, but some folks on here diverted radically (i.e.Old Bay) and still liked it so.

This is a terrific dish! I followed the recipe to the letter, except did not have any fresh jalapenos on hand, and didn't want to use pickled ones. So, I used a teaspoon or so of Sriracha, and it was perfect. My daughter kept making yummy noises the whole time she was eating. Definitely will make this again!

This is fantastic recipe. Instead of chicken stock, I made a shrimp stock from the shells and used Sierra Nevada instead of a lager. Everyone at the table raved about it. I prefer this recipe to some of the others, as they add so much cream. This is plenty rich enough and not over the top. Next time I might add a little old Bay, just to see.

Mighty good! I used 2 jalapeños and mexican style beer and it was fabulous. The fried egg and tarragon put it over the top.

This recipe was great. I made it for 80 people and only changed a few things for logistical purposes. I played it on the safe side and only used half the tasso. I was scared it would be too spicy for such a large crowd. I also didn't add the egg since I was serving it buffet style. Next time, I will make this recipe on a smaller scale at home and follow the exact recipe.

OUTSTANDING!! The flavors are magical. I mail ordered Old School grits from NC. Make this dish exactly as is. If you can't find the ingredients, you don't deserve to eat this.

This was one of the best recipes I have ever found online. I used cubed Pancetta instead of bacon, Ranger IPA for the beer, and skipped the tarragon since I had run out. The meal perfectly served four people and I will definitely be making this again in the future.

You people are crazy! The egg is absolutely necessary. It adds richness, texture, color. It takes this dish from good to great! I made it exactly per recipe except used a local brew rather than Bud and it was perfect. Pure comfort food.

I used white grits and FF 1/2 & 1/2 and bacon. I didn't use eggs because we ate this for dinner. Also, we buy raw, frozen, peeled shrimp from Sam's for a huge savings

Possibly the BEST THING I EVER MADE! Grits: I used white quick grits (not instant). Omit heavy cream and jalapeno with my version. Add 3 whole poblanos. I burn them black directly on my gas range (no pan), takes longer than you would think. Let them rest until cool. Peel them, deseed, and puree them in food processor with a shot of Half and Half. Follow directions for cooking the grits, but with all half and half instead of water. Yes, they'll be rich. Stir poblano mixture and cheese in and season. You'll probably need to thin the grits out right at service with milk or butter. Shrimp: I used all chicken stock, no beer. Chop 1 bunch of green onions. Add white part when you add the shrimp. Season shrimp liberally with Old Bay. I put the tarragon in for the last minute. Assembly: I liked these in a bowl. Lay down grits, top with shrimp, spoon broth over the top, add more grated cheese and green part of onions. NO FRIED EGG, YUCK!

I substituted Assiago and Parmigiano cheeses in the grits and used a locally-produced breakfast sausage (Richardson Farms), crumbled. I sauteed the shrimp in the sausage grease. Because the sausage is so well-seasoned, I didn't feel I needed to add the stock, beer, or butter. I served it with farm-fresh eggs from the same producer and buttermilk biscuits. It was a hit!

Made for dinner. Used pepper jack cheese because I didn't have cheddar and skipped the eggs. Extra hot sauce added at the table too. Delicious and fast.

Fantastic breakfast. Small changes based on what I had on hand - quick cook grits, chorizo and green chiles. Very flexible recipe and fast when using the quick cook grits!
