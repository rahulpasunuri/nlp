One word: Yum! Don't leave the leeks on top, though. Mix 'em in, add a little more S+P and you're there!

The mashed potatoes with the marscopone cheese was great but not to thrilled about the leek topping. Would make again but without leeks.

We thought these were delicious, with just a bit more salt & pepper. The mascarpone in the potatoes gives a lovely flavor and richness but still lets the potato flavor come through. And the sweet brown leeks on top? Wonderful!

Good recipe but like other reviewer's, this needed a little bit of help. I also added 8 ounces of sour cream and more salt & pepper. But the caramelized leaks were a nice addition to the typical mashed potatoes!

Made this once, not again. I thought they were flavorless, very disappointing.

These are good, but need a little tweak. Like other reviewers, I found the recipe a little frustrating at first- the other flavors didn't really pop. I would recommend cutting the potatoes by a third, adding a stronger cheese in with the marscapone, and following the illustration by leaving the leeks on top instead of mixed in. This can be be fashioned into a very good dish.

This will be on my holiday table for years to come, my guests loved it and we have made it several times since. A nice twist on everyones favorite "Mashed potatoes".

As I considered mascarpone too bland for this dish, I used matured Gouda cheese (Dutch) and it came out very flavourful. The leeks on top instead of mashed together with the potatoes is a good idea.

the leeks were a nice touch on these potatoes, but that was all i liked about them. the potatoes themselves were nothing special. the mascarpone didn't add anything, but maybe another cheese would with more flavor, a creamy goat cheese, perhaps.

Hands down, these were the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. But I did think they needed a little butter -- i added about 4-6 Tbs. And the leeks were almost unnecessary. The potatoes were practically perfect without them.

Possibly best mashed potatos ever. I found that it did not need more butter to finish (unlike other reviewers); the mascarpone added a unique richness and cream texture to the dish.

Thanks to the previous reviews, I added butter and more salt/pepper. I also used gold potatoes and they came out fantastic. Everyone said that these were some of the best mashed potatoes that they've tasted. The leeks and garlic really punched up the flavor. This is a recipe that I will use again and again.

This was really good. It did need more butter, salt, and pepper to "finish" it properly. The mascarpone added a nice touch to the texture.

These were very good. I didn't really think there was enough cheese in mine (I may have used to many potatoes), so I the whole container of 8 oz, and then about 3 oz. of cream cheese. Loved the leeks and garlic, I thought they added nice flavor.

Everyone loved these potatoes. They needed butter and plenty of salt and pepper. The mascarpone gives them a silky texture.
