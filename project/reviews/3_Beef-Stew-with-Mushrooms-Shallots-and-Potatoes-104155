I also used this recipe as a base. I added paprika and cardomom to the seasonings on the beef. I dont have shallots so I just used onion. And a cup of dry wine was a nice touch. Over all I would deffently make a version of this stew again!

One of the other reasons this recipe is flat is b/c they put the potatoes in this stew! Everyone knows that potatoes take out all the flavor in a recipe. It'd be better to make a side of yummy roasted potatoes (olive oil, s&p, rosemary,etc). I agree with adding wine. Thanks!

Plain old beef stew--needs a lot of jazzing up. Followed the recipe except I cooked the stew in the oven (250) for 3 hours. Prefer the "garlic-braised beef shanks" recipe which has a lot more flavor.

A very good recipe with a great "home" flavour. I didn´t have allspice so I used paprika instead. It is very adequate recipe for slow cook electric pots. I prepared it in 4 hours in low temperature.

I thought the recipe was very good considering the ease of making it. Following the suggestions of previous reviewers: I used 3 cups beef broth plus 1/2 cup good Burgundy wine. I would recommend adding the mushrooms 15 minutes prior to the shallots - and adding carrots with the shallots. Would make a lovely winter meal with good crusty bread.

ADD YOUR OWN TOUCH to this recipe and it is wonderful. It is a great base for a beef stew. I add 1 lg. can plum tomatoes, 1c red wine, and carrots. I also put it in the oven for 5 hours at 250, slow cooking is the key to this recipe. My picky husband likes it!

Just plain stew. Some readers suggest adding spices and wine, but why bother?. I'm going to look for a better stew recipe. Even my children thought it was boring and they like bland foods.

I think the reviewer from Minneapolis was on the right track when he/she made all those additions to this stew. I made it as written and didn't care for it too much. The flavor is quite flat - all you really taste is beef. And it was quite labor intensive for a weekday meal. I definitely won't make this again - unless I add carrots and wine, and bay leaves, and... You would be better off following your own stew instincts.

This is a great recipe to start from for an easy weekday dinner. I subbed 1 1/2 cup broth for burgundy, a 1/2 lb. of assorted fingerlings, a turnip and some carrots for the red potatoes; added bay leaves, a little worsterchire (hoisin migh also be interesting), and threw a spring of fresh rosemary in during simmering. As written, I gave it two forks. Adding your our spin on the recipe can boost it to three forks.

Quite an average taste to this stew. The large amount of shallots was nice though, for once. I wouldn't make it again.

This is ok. No rave reviews from the family.

Added more beef broth, cooked half an hour more. Also added baby carrots during last 30 minutes, added shallots 45 minutes before. Added 2 TB Worsterchire sauce, a bay leaf and 1 TB of lemon juice. Excellent.

My husband really liked this stew. I thought it wouldn't be very tasty because it was so simple to make, but it surprised me. It is a easy and satisfying dish.

This dish was wonderful. There was a nice bend of flavors. My husband liked it as well. I added carrots to the recipe. Outstanding.

Delicious!! Sooo easy, and quick to make also. Just remember cut your veggies in large pieces otherwise the long cooking time boils them down to little morsels. I also doubled the beef broth. Don't skimp on the mushrooms...they are the best part!

Rating: 3
Very tasty! Worth the prep time and the wait! We found that double the amount of beef broth was needed. Also, 45 minutes plus 30 minutes didn't seem to be enough time. Try a total of 2 hours or 2:15. Also, I'd put in the shallots a bit earlier. Thanks to "Laguna Hills" -- carrots were a nice addition.

Excellent stew. As with many stews you can experiment, adding carrots for instance.

This was easy to make. I added a 1/4 cup of red wine and dash more salt at the end. Be sure to bake some crusty bread for dipping in the sauce.

Classic beef stew is something that my family has had so much that we really don't want it anymore. This recipe is not like anything we've had before and we really enjoyed. We'll have this again.

I made this for my fiancé tonight. I would recommend sticking with a low sodium beef stock, which I would cut with a nice heavy red wine. The shallots were awesome and I might go with an assortment of mushrooms next time, although the crimini I uses were fine. Also, had to add a thickener, like everyone else. But all the same, nice and hearty.

I followed suggestions from other reviews. Husband raved. The kids and I were just ok with it. I found myself picking out the mushrooms to eat since they were so good. Maybe I did something wrong, but it seemed watery. I would have enjoyed the soup thicker and richer.

Great comfort food. Saute'd the beef in large pieces and cooked in a crockpot with the potatoes, shallots, and a mixture of white (button) and baby portobello mushrooms. Deglazed the saute' pan with 1/2 cup of merlot. Added 1 bay leaf. Really good!

My fiance and I love this dish. It doesn't hurt to make your own beef broth. Also, I don't use so much allspice...just a pinch will do you.

This turned out soooo good! I was very surprized. Like the previous reviews, I added about a 1/2cup of a pinot noir and also garlic. I didn't bother with the shallots either. It was awesome. The mushrooms really add a nice touch.

This was pretty good. I added red wine and garlic, plus some carrots. It wasn't really special, but good for what it is. I guess I'd make it again if I was craving beef stew.

Delicious!! Following the advice in the reviews, I add red wine (1 C) with beef broth. Also used 1 lg sweet onion (chopped)and 2 cloves of garlic (minced) instead of shallots. I used a slow cooker, set on med, for 3 hours, instead of the oven. Came out perfect!!!

This stew was great! I also added red wine to deglaze the pan, and found baby red potatoes which were just the right size for this dish. I also made the Honey-Butter French Bread recipe to serve alongside. I'll definitely be making this again!

I found some well aged beef, washed & dried it. I followed the recipe except I deglazed the pot with red wine after browning the beef and the pototoe/mushrooms. I added a cup or two in the process. Served it for four and had raves all around.

This was a very delicious recipe. I couldn't find small potatoes either, so I quartered larger ones, also, & it worked well. I didn't find shallots in my grocery store, so I quartered three small white onions. Also, I added some garlic powder & a dash of salt & pepper to the flour mixture. Added a couple of splashes of red wine & worchestire sauce to the sauce, too. My family loved it & have asked when we're having it again! Give it a try -- you'll love it!

This one is definitely a keeper! Beef stew is usually just beef stew but this was sensational. I added dried oregano, some garlic and onion powder and salt & pepper to the flour mix. I used beef consomme instead of beef broth, pearl onions instead of shallots and I added some large slices of carrot for color. I wasn't able to get the tiny red potatoes so I used medium sized red potatoes cut in quarters. This worked fine. I also added about a cup of red wine and thickened the sauce with a mixture of the sauce and cornstarch. I served it over broad egg noodles with fresh Italian bread. One of the best "comfort" foods I have tasted in a very long time. My husband took leftovers for lunch today and was still raving about it when he came home from work!!

A very mediocre dish. I made it with round and some red wine rather than all the broth. Was disappointed because it had little taste. A quick stew but not satisfying.

Delicious and easy to make. Made it without the potatoes, but served potatoes on the side. Turned out great.

I made this recipe using a venison neck roast and it came out very well. I also boosted the thyme to 1 tablespoon.

I have made this recipe 3 times already, and each time it gets rave reviews. Not too much effort for a wonderful meal. Served it over thick egg noodles once, and kids could not get enough (and that's important when they are only 2 and 4!)

Quick and easy, especially using pre-cubed beef. Added 2 cups red wine for extra flavor; increased reduction time, but not to reduce all of it. Served over rice.

the thyme and allspice added to the flour in this dish makes it especailly aromatic and delicious. I didn't add all 18 shallots for fear my kids wouldn't like that many, so adding half the number gave flavor and they didn't even know they were in there. A real winner in this household of picky eaters.
