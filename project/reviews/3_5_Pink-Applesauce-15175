Looking for a way to use up 4 pounds of Braeburns that were too mushy to eat, and this worked very well. I replaced the sugar 1:1 with Splenda. I was afraid after cooking that there was way too much liquid, but after I ran everything through the food processor and let it chill, it was the perfect consistency. I'm not crazy about the texture... I prefer to dice apples small with peel still on and then mash after cooking. The peel in this had a chopped grain that wasn't my favorite, but the flavor of the apples and lemon juice was just right and overall, this was a quick, tasty, easy, and healthy way to keep from wasting my ingredients.

Just like my husband's grandmothers recipe - except she would add a pad of butter at the very end. Gives it a creamy texture. And she always used MacIntosh apples.

I have been making this applesauce for years--my children absolutely love it

I used brown sugar instead of white, and a little less than half a cup. I also added a teaspoon of cinnamon, and it was a delicious warm dessert on a snowy night!
