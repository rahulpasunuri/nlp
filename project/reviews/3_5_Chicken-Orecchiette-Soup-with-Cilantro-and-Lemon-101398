Not a fan :( I thought it was delicious until I added the lemon juice.

Made this when we had school canceled for a snow day! Made many changes though: used baby shells as I love those, shredded the chicken instead of cutting in to strips, used homemade chicken stock because I had some leftover, which always helps, had to use regular coriander as I didn't have seeds, added a bit of lemongrass AND! added a touch of coconut milk! I think the coconut milk really added something to the dish. Was really delicious on a cold day.

We really liked this recipe. I used the Chicken Stock recipe on this site, which made for a much tastier broth than store bought chicken broth. I also added red pepper flakes at the end to spice it up a bit, and a bit of milk to thicken it.

I made this exactly as written and we found it very light, refreshing and flavorful. The tomatoes added a lot of color to the broth, not so much to the final soup. The amount of cilantro was right. The only changes I would make in the future would be to use lime juice instead of lemon and rice instead of pasta.

This flavorful soup is a nice change of pace from the traditional chicken soups. I added fresh chile to spice it up a bit, and will definitely make it again.

This recipe was really good!! I made it with lime instead of lemon b/c my husband loves lime and cilantro (and so do I). We also didn't have orecchiette so we used farfalle pasta. I completely left out the cumin and fennel seeds b/c we didn't have any and added more coriander. On top of that I added a dash of tabasco, chopped up jalapeno and lots of salt and pepper and it was great!

This soup has a very good mix of different flavors, I recommend not serving it if someone is looking for a more traditional chicken soup with pasta. I think the recipe called for too much cilantro although I love cilantro. I would definitely make it again.

The soup was tasty and different. Perhaps a little too bland, so I added quite a bit of salt. I used the leftover broth as a base to make rice, added a little extra cilantro and it was really good!

This is a great light soup. Defineatley add the pasta as you serve it, as with most pasta in soup/broth, it will swell.

Quick and easy. I left out the sliced tomato garnish at the end, and used rice instead of pasta. I added lemon zest, sliced chinese sausage, and a chopped jalapeno pepper, which gave it a more asian flavor, and a bit of zip. Even the kid loved it!

This is a wonderful soup recipe and is now one of my favorites. The only suggestion I would have is to add the orecchiette separately since it tends to expand and absorb the broth if left in the soup. I didn't think it was that much work and have made the soup after coming home for work during the week. It's wonderful accompanied by a nice, crusty bread and a delicious white wine such as a Pinot Grigio or Fume Blanc.

Great soup recipe. I added some lemon zest to the broth, as well as a bay leaf. Also threw in the cilantro stems and all as it would be strained out later. Next time I may add some chilie to give the final result a bit of heat. Would also like to try it with rice, instead of the pasta, which I think makes eating rather cumbersome. Finally, what's with the tomatoes? They make the broth a little pinkish (not appetizing in a chicken soup), and give it a bitter, acidic taste. Leave them out.

Although the recipe is pretty involved and you may need to make a special trip to buy ingredients, it is totally worth it! Super delicious and it re-heats well.

This is a great, easy to make recipe when you're looking for something hot, light, and flavorful on a cold winter night. I cut back on the amount of chicken and used the juice of one lemon. It's going to become a standard in our recipe file. This recipe may appear like a lot of work, but it's really just chop, simmer, strain, and serve.

I found for the work that was needed to assemble the soup, I was not impressed with the overall flavor. I felt there was too much coriander flavor it.

This is one of the most versatile recipes I've ever used. I've made it without the chicken and used vegetable broth if I'm serving it to vegetarians. Made without pasta, the soup freezes very well. I've also not strained out the vegetables, and put everything (except chicken) through the blender; it makes a thicker soup. Everyone I serve this soup to raves about it.

We LOVED this recipe and can't wait to make it again. Easy and SO flavorful. I only added a couple tablespoons of lemon juice based on other cook comments and it was wonderful.

An interesting change of pace. I recommending adding a little lemon juice at a time to taste - I found the 1/2 cp in the recipe a little too bitter and acidic. Serve the soup immediately when it is ready because the orecchiette pasta will continue to swell, even at room temperature.
