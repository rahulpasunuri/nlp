this was a waste of time and money. I did not make the waffles, only the two toppings. the fruit was mushy and watery. the cheese was flavorless. I threw it all away. It was too embarassing to serve company.

I used 2 cups of all-flour and 1 cup of wheat flour, and replaced the butter with 1/2 cup canola oil and 1/4 cup melted butter. Also, as other reviewers suggested, I separated the eggs, beat the egg whites stiff, and folded them under the batter. All in all, the waffles were tasty but came out quite heavy. I also made the apple and dried fruit compote, which turned out very nicely.

Usually make the Cornmeal Buttermilk "Nesbitt" recipe here for waffles but wanted to try something different. Did not make the toppings here - we were craving waffles, bacon and maple syrup. These were great, made with a few changes just for kicks. For dry ingredients I used 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup cornmeal. For the wet I used 3 cups buttermilk, 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup canola oil. Results were fantastic, light crisp airy and wonderful waffles. My waffle- maker made exactly 16 4x4 thick waffles. Will definitely make again!

Well, I've made it twice for my annual Christmas brunch for the women over the years and the toppings are awesome. The leftover cheese sauce was great on baked potatoes and the fruit was fine as a side dish. I will definitely be making it again.

I substituted one cup of hazelnut meal for one of the three of flour, used only 1.25c of butter, and egg substitute for the eggs. Keeping it simple I topped with thinly sliced baked apples sprinkled with vanilla powder and cinnamon - with maple syrup - it was EASY and delicious.

Excellent and easy (I just made the waffles). I halved the recipe and made the buttermilk but adding a TSBP vinegar to regular milk and let sit 15 min. These waffles are light in texture and rich with flavor. It took no time to put this together and on the table.

A great basic buttermilk waffle recipe. Did not make the toppings this time, but the waffles themselves were great.

A bit heavier than I'm used to, but all in all a very tasty waffle recipe. I recommend it. Be warned, the batter is quite thick. Also, it serves 4 generously, not 6.

Made these without the toppings. Great basic waffle. Will definately make again.

Terrific waffle recipe! Our guests always rave about them. A tip to make this recipe even better is to separate the egg yolks and whites. Add the slightly beaten yolks when the recipes says to add the eggs. Then beat the whites with a mixer until firm peaks form. Then fold the whites into the batter. This will lighten the waffles a bit - creating a terrific texture.

I made these waffles for Christmas breakfast this year. They were a big hit; light, crispy, and held up well under a lot of maple syrup (we didn't make the toppings). To make life easy I made them ahead. They froze well and reheated in 350 degree oven for 5-7 minutes without any problem. Will do again next year.

I have to confess I don't like waffles, but my children do, even Eggos. I picked this recipe to try because it seemed closest to a pancake recipe that I really like. I cut the salt a little and added about four tablespoons of sugar. These waffles are wonderful. I will be making them a lot

Very easy to make and the best waffle recipe I've found so far. I used EXTRA large eggs and thought they were slightly too eggy (for health conscious me) but everyone else loved them. I omitted the salt and they were perfect!! Looking forward to trying them again!

We found these waffles to be quite salty, although the texture was nice. We used them as a sweet waffle for breakfast. We did not have unsalted butter so used a salted and it showed.

This is the best waffle recipe I have ever tried. They are fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside. My family loves them with just syrup!

Just made the waffles and they were very good-crispy and light. The waffles themselves did not have a lot of flavour, which may be why they are paired with such strong sauces in this recipe. That said, they were very tasty with maple syrup.

I made just the Tarragon Brie sauce, and while it is rich, it's easy to make and delicious! It goes well with waffles, and is a great dipping sauce for fresh, home made bread.
