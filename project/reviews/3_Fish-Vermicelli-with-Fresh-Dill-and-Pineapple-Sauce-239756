Delicious, but agreed with the pineapple sauce having far too much fish sauce. Start with all other ingredients and add fish sauce to taste. Otherwise, it's far too salty.

Too salty. Recipe calls for too much fish sauce. The pineapple didn't help in neutralizing the saltiness. Plus, the dill and onions become too overcooked. Suggestion: Cut what the recipe calls for the fish sauce in half. It is not necessary to put 1/2 cup of fish sauce. 1/4 would or less would have sufficed. I would make this again but I would not follow the recipe.

How excited was I to find a recipe so similar to one of my favorite dishes at Pok Pok in Portland, OR. The turmeric marinade is awesome and turns the fish a bright, beautiful color. I couldn't resist using catfish since that is how its prepared at Pok Pok (and of course its less expensive, too), though I'm sure the halibut is decadent. I will say, I think 1/2 cup fish sauce is WAY too much for the pineapple sauce. I'd suggest starting with 2-3 TBSPs and work your way up to your liking from there.

This meal was absolutely delicious. The grocery store I went to was limited in selection so I ended up using tilapia fillets, semolina vermicelli noodles, forgetting the scallions, and replacing the Thai chile with a red habanero but it was fantastic. Possibly the best meal I've ever made.

a lovely recipe, although we need at least a half pound per person, maybe more, and the final cooking steps can all be done at once, I think.
