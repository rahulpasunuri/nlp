I have been making this recipe since it was published in 1994 with one change: I always grill in on our charcoal grill. It is always terrific and the smoke adds a wonderful flavor and helps make terrific gravy. This year I am going to try brining the turkey first. I try to make other recipes but end up making this one about every 3 years as it is so tasty!

I had a turkey leftover in the freezer since Thanksgiving (when they were handing out freebies), so I decided to finally try out this recipe for a non-traditional Memorial Day turkey dinner. This recipe is outstanding! Others have complained it's too time intensive, but for me, it wasn't all that much extra work. Roasting and stuffing a big bird is always a major production. The paste/rub was delicious and kept the turkey incredibly juicy and moist. I might up the amount of Ancho chiles next time around - maybe one extra. But it's really fine the way it is. I stuffed the turkey with the Santa Fe Christmas Stuffing found on this site. It paired most excellently! I think even non-adventurous eaters would find this turkey extremely tasty. It's not spicy hot at all. Just very flavorful and moist. A definite do-again from me and my whole family.

Correction to comments in my review below. The scalloped chipotle sweet potato recipe is on FoodNetwork.com (not this site).

I had been eyeballing this recipe since it originally appeared in the Nov 1994 issue of Bon Appetit but my husband wasn't interested in a southwest-style turkey. THEN we moved to Texas and he became interested. In a nutshell, we have made this turkey 2 years in a row now and we both agree that it's the best turkey we've ever made. The ancho chile paste does not make this a spicy dish, but gives it a nice 'earthy' flavor from the chiles. We served it with a chorizo dressing, scalloped chipotle sweet potatoes (recipe is on this site), mashed potatoes with roasted hatch chiles and cheddar, and steamed green beans. We LOVE these leftovers!

I wanted a totally different flavor from what I serve on Thanksgiving.We loved how it looked and how moist it was. The aroma was wonderful. Definitely will make again.

I made this turkey for our gourmet club's Southwestern Christmas dinner party. The only change I made was to brine it first since I had a free- range heritage turkey. I had a 19 pound turkey and the color and flavor were fabulous. All the guests loved it. I made the Southwestern cornbread stuffing to go with it. We also had butternut squash bisque, gratin of the 3 sisters, Santa Fe coleslaw with carmelized pecans, etc. Truly an incredible feast.

It was good, but too labor intensive for such a little payoff. Maybe it would work better on a smaller bird.

This was terrific and a big hit with my Thanksgiving crowd. I'll make it again soon.

Made the rub with cornish game hens for Christmas. A hit for those who like spicier dishes! Turned out great on smaller game than the turkey. Hens were accompanied by green chile and cheddar corn bread muffins, cilantro mashed potatoes and an arugula salad with roasted red peppers. Yummy and pretty simple. : ) My mom wants to make again for company. Our German Shephard gives it 4 paws.

This recipe made one of the most flavorful and satisfying roast turkeys that I have ever made. I was skeptical, since I usually have made just plain roast turkey for Thanksgiving, but this recipe is one I will never forget and will make many times in the future. The original posting of this recipe was in 1994 issue of Bon Appetit and was paired with an amazing cornbread stuffing. worth trying!

I have been making this turkey since it first appeared. I have to say it is truly the best. I have simplified the garlic step by simply cutting the tops off and placing them in foil in the oven and later squeezing them out. Also, I always prepare the paste the day before and prepare the turkey so it can marinate in the fridge. The gravy is so delicious! I NEVER have leftovers, it's that good. That issue was the best ever, it's a keeper!

This turkey was very moist and very flavorful. I didn't like having to baste it so often, but as far as turkey recipes go, this was wonderful. It stayed moist and I could make the sauce days in advance.

I actually made this a while back for a holiday dinner party, and was amazed at how well it turned out. It was perfect, and the if you follow the recipe you can't go wrong. This is the first time I've made turkey where the only thing left after the meal was bones for stock. Incredible!

I made this for dinner yesterday (Sunday) and it was absolutely delicious. The only modification was that I did not have the allspice berries, so I used 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, they are similar in taste. I will definitely make this the next time I have a large gathering. I served it with yellow rice, drunken pinto beans and sauteed cabbage/collards with corn bread and sweet tea. Smelling the ancho chili paste made you want to spread it on bread.

I made this for Thanksgiving after reading the wonderful reviews and felt it was okay, but certainly not a good fit for a Thanksgiving dinner.

As so many said, I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe--even the cooking time was exactly right. The depth of flavor in the gravy was amazing, especially since to me gravy is usually a floury, kind of yucky thing! I did use a brined turkey and should have skipped rubbing the turkey with salt before cooking it--not the recipe's fault but mine. It was very moist and tender but to my taste just the tiniest bit salty. Next time I'll either omit that step or use a "regular" turkey.

I've made this turkey for different people three years in a row and it never fails to win me praises. It's great to hear year after year, "this is the best turkey I've ever eaten."

A delicious turkey, but there is no way on god's green earth that a 17-18 lb bird will be cooked in under 4-5 hours! The gravy is superb.

This turkey turned out very delicious. I subsituted other fresh green chiles because I could not find the dried ones at the supermarket. I purchased an extra large turkey thinking I would have definately have some leftovers. It didn't happen. This recipe is certainly a keeper.

This was hands down the most beautiful and delicious turkey that has ever entered my mouth. I was cooking for a huge New Years crowd and used a 25 pound turkey and doubled the paste. I brined the turkey overnight and then cooked the turkey uncovered for the first hour. The paste formed a second skin that kept *all* of the moisture in, so in addition to great flavor we got the moistest turkey ever. It was a wonder to behold. This is the new turkey recipe to beat. The turkey looked and tasted like those impossible staged pictures.

The flavors of this recipe are outstanding. We like it so much we use the paste on game hens and halved chickens, not just turkey. After smearing the paste, partially cook the chicken halves in the microwave and finish them on the grill (so the skin doesn't burn). Then, for total decadence, finish the gravy with cream instead of broth. Yum.

Prepared for Gourmet Club dinner and for Thanksgiving dinner with friends. A big hit!

Awesome recipe..I have shared this recipe with 6 friends who had the pleasure of eating it. Suggestion..do up a little more "roasted garlic pate and apply it to the turkey breast under the skin, especially the legs.

A truly inspired dish, and a family tradition for the past five years. To add even more Southwest character, smoke over mesquite chips. Be sure to reserve some of the chile paste to make gravy.

When this first appeared in Bon Appetit Nov. 1994 (that is a great BA issue), I decided I wanted to make it--I did for Easter 1995 for our adult children and families. Everyone enjoyed it. I did stuff it with the Southwestern Corn Bread Stuffing. Since then I've done it on a smaller scale with roast chicken. I'm thinking it's time again to make it this Easter.

I have made this recipe on more than one occasion. The achiote paste gives the Turkey a great flavor! There are rarely Turkey "leftovers" with this recipe but if there are any it makes into a wonderful Southwest Turkey Soup with Vegetables.
