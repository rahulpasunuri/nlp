This was an absolute hit for Thanksgiving dinner this evening! My 12 year old told me he could eat 15 pieces! I DID double the spices as many other suggested. That's a must. In error I did not toast or chop the slivered almonds, but the bark was fantastic. I did chop up some Emerald cocoa dusted almonds and sprinkled them on top too. I made the toffee sauce and kept it on the side. It's sinfully yummy, but I ended up throwing most of it out since it really wasn't necessary. This is most definitely a keeper!

Made this for Christmas Dinner and it was a huge hit - my husband said it was the best dessert he has ever eaten! Simple to make - followed exactly and it turned out perfect. The sauce and the bark were easy to do and added a great touch!

Absolutely delicious! A great finish for our Thanksgiving dinner. Decided to make everything from scratch (except the graham crackers) and came out, following the recipe to the letter, just perfect. I made it with a homemade vanilla-bean ice cream (Gourmet, Aug 2003) and fresh roasted pumpkin. All flavors came together perfectly.

This was delicous, and the clear winner at the christmas dessert table. I made the recipe as is but doubled the spices in the pumpkin mixture. Next time I would spice up the crust by maybe using a graham cracker / gingersnap mixture. I will also do away with the corn syrup, and make my own carmel sauce. This was very easy, and definitely a good thing to make a day ahead.

My mom has made this for both Thanksgiving and now for Christmas. At Christmas, my grandad's aide who had had some of this pie at Thanksgiving stood next to me with a large piece of pie on her plate and practically body-slammed me for an even bigger piece. It's the fastest-disappearing pie ever. I am making it tomorrow night for New Years.

Really delicious. But I recommend using a whole 15-ounce can of pumpkin and maybe a bit less ice cream, and doubling all of the spices. Also, getting all the temperatures right was really tricky. I'd advise against serving this right out of the freezer. If you freeze it overnight, moving it to the fridge a couple of hours before serving results in a better consistency, particularly if you end up using more pumpkin, because icy pumpkin is slightly unpleasant. If possible, put on the whipped cream and chocolate bark immediately before serving. And I had better results with the toffee sauce on my second try, when I served it at room temperature instead of hot.

Everyone loved this dessert. I used only 1 quart of icecream for a more intense pumpking flavor. The chocolate bark and sauce are nice, but you really don't need them. The cake is excellent on its own.

This cake is absolutely amazing. I quadrupled the spices and it was perfect. A huge hit that I will make for years to come!

"Better than pumpkin pie," says my son- in-law, now pumpkin pie-convert! Easy to make ahead & the toffee sauce is marvelous. I cheated and bought the dark chocolate almond bark. Officially a new tradition in this house!
