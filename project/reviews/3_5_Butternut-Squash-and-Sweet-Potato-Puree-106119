It's all about which ras el hanout you have. I actually combined 4 recipes to create mine and keep it in a little jar. The longer the list of ingredients, the better it is. For those who didn't like it, perhaps your ras el hanout recipe was not the best - there should not be one flavor jumping out at you - the best ones have truly blended flavors.

As written I would not make this recipe again. I didn't care of the Ras el Hanout - something in it was too strong (perhaps the mace). After I made it I added additional sugar to sweeten it up a bit.

made this for thanksgiving. Everybody loved it! Such a nice burst of flavor to contrast with the more traditional thyme/sage flavors of the day. Will definitely be making this more often and every year for thanksgiving!

I made this with vegetable broth for Thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews from both vegetarians and meat eaters! I used extra nutmeg instead of mace.

I made this for a friend for dinner and he was practically licking the plate! We both loved it. I paired it with lamb chops (Epicurious recipe) and served a special bottle of a shiraz & cab blend. Totally awesome pairing. I cannot wait to make it again.

I've been making this dish for years and it is wonderful. It is an easy make ahead and can be reheated in the oven the next day. It's perfect for Thanksgiving, but I serve it with all roasted meats to rave reviews. The spice combination is delicious. This is the best way to serve butternut and sweet potatoes. Yum!

We used vegetable broth instead of beef, thereby eliminating animals products from what ought to be a vegetable dish.

I made this for (shockingly, without testing prior) guest at a birthday dinner party and everyone love-love-loved it. If you don't have ras el_hanout in your pantry, consider buying a quantity of it from a reputable spice house and use it whenever you have a chance. It's a complex, intruiging flavor that could be used in both savory and dessert -- really -- dishes.

Not what I was expecting. I didn't like the way all of the flavors came together. It was mediocre and I don't plan on making this again.

Since making this for guests in October I have been asked to make it for dinners several times since. A real hit!

Cut the squash and potatoes in half lengthwise and bake cut side down in an oil brushed pan. Instead of scooping the flesh out, try just grabbing the skin and pressing the flesh out, or just peeling the skin off with yr fingers -- if it is cooked thoroughly and allowed to cool for awhile, the skin on both the squash and the sweet potatoes will come right off very easily with very little wasted flesh. I thought the spices were a little heavy on the nutmeg, and I cut back on the onion ("two onions" is vague -- maybe two small onions, but otherwise, one normal onion worked well) but otherwise a great dish.

We loved this dish! The spices are subtle and the onion pepper mix adds depth to the dish without overwhelming. We also served it with beef stew, and will make it again.

I thought the onions overpowered the dish. I might try making this again with about the quarter of the onions - which is odd, because I do love carmelized onions!

I left out the red pepper, as it doesn't agree with me, but the recipe was just great...the Ras el Hanout was the perfect combination of spices with this dish. The next day I pureed the leftover with half and half cream in a double boiler and served it with a spoonful of creme fraish and a sprig of fresh dill on top, the best squash soup ever!

I'd agree with adding more spices, the flavor was good but very subtle. Maybe this goes better as a side dish with something like turkey, rather than as a side dish to the pork loin we had. Roasting the vegetables gives a richer color and flavor, brings out the sweetness of the veges. Seemed to need to add a LOT more broth than called for. May make 6 servings - it seemed to be the never-ending dish for the 2 of us.

This was a huge hit at my dinner party and quite easy to prepare - i left out the red peppers due to a time constraint and only approximated the proportions of the spice but it was great - everyone requested the recipe.

The red peppers and the onions make a nice combination with the sweetness of the yams and butternut squash. The spices add a nice flavor but it's probably safe to double the amount.

I made this for Thanksgiving using all squash and it was delicious. Even non-squash-lovers enjoyed the interesting combination of spices and the onion/pepper mixture. I substituted kabocha squash for butternut because I think it has the best flavor of all the squash varieties I've tried. Kabocha has a thick hard shell rather than butternut's thin peelable skin, so you need to approximately double the starting weight of raw squash in order to end up with sufficient cooked squash flesh. And by all means cook the squash in the microwave-zap it whole for a few minutes until it becomes soft enough to cut through the equator, then cook it cut side down in a little water til very soft and scoop out the flesh.

This dish was a great change from the usual. I made this with the prime rib with cabernet jus, and the scalloped potatoes with goat cheese & herbs de provence (both from this site), and a maple glazed brussels sprouts with pancetta dish, and I could not believe how fantastically all the flavors complemented each other. This is a delicious, and relatively easy dish that I have already made again--this time with turkey, and again, it was a huge hit with everyone.

This was a great side dish - especially with the pork tenderloin entree in the magazine. It had a nice sweet flavor which was enhanced by the sweet onion/bell pepper mixture. I microwaved the yams and squash to save time.
