The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly. After cooking the steak in the pan, I immediately added shallots and deglazed with the whiskey to get the delicious brown bits into the sauce. I had the fan over the stove on for some reason and forgot to turn it off before igniting the whiskey. I knew it was going to flame high, but wow! Got sucked into the fan and caught fire. Got it out quickly and no harm came to the sauce. So be careful and prepare for a serious flame-up (I used a pretty high-proof bourbon which I'm sure impacted it). Second time we made it, cooked the steak on the grill and it tasted about the same, although I did miss the extra little oomph of flavor from the deglaze. Tastes delicious and impresses guests without a lot of work.

I made this without the whiskey (being underage and all) and it was amazing. I ate it so quickly it burned my mouth. So delicious.

For those who may not know, the cut may also be called a Top Sirloin Steak. I'm not entirely sure if it's called differently in The States or not.

Easy and fast. I was concerned about the amount of fat on my steak, but it did not end up greasy at all. If you like medium rare - the cooking time is too long by a minute or two. I used Glenfiddich 12y and the sauce had a distinct yeasty flavor. Next time I will try bourbon.

By itself, the steak was ordinary. The sauce made it worth four forks, but anyone reading the recipe can see the steak is not prepared in any special way. Next time I may grill it but keep a little fat to render for the sauce. This may kick it up a bit. The sauce was easy and flavorfull. I doubled the recipe, but would cut back on the butter by 1/3 if I were to make this batch size again. reheats well.

very good. we grilled the steaks and I made the sauce in a pan. Used garlic instead of shallots and brandy instead of whiskey. very good flavor and will make again with stated ingredients.

I made this with a boneless sirloin steak, about 1.5 lbs, (cooking for 3) couldn't find anything labeled top butt. The cooking time was perfect for this piece of meat. Basically made same amount of sauce. The flame up, when I lit the whiskey was quite high, a little scary, but no harm done. Sauce was delicious and different. Sliced the steak and poured all sauce over meat on platter.

Amazing sauce, we subbed in brandy and really liked the drama in flaming it.

Being from Canada, I've never heard of this cut of beef. Does anyone know what we would call it up here?

The sauce is wonderful - very rich! Substituted leeks for shallots and still worked well. The steak we used was somewhat thicker than one inch, so it was pretty rare, which suits me.

This was a great quick & easy midweek meal. It was tender and had nice flavor.
