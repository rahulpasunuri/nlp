A simple and delicious oil to drizzle on anything. I want to try this as a spice rub for grilled meats using powdered garlic, no lemon rind and less oil.

I agree with all the reviewers: it was delicious! The only thing I would add is remove the oil from the stove and put it in a bowl, just like it says in the recipe. Then add the minced garlic and lemon peel. I added the garlic to the oil on the stove and almost burned the garlic. Also, when your cooking scallops make sure you don't fuss with them. Let them get brown in one spot before turning them over. This recipe is a keeper@

The spice oil is delicious and easy. I served this over grilled sockeye salmon and will try it on scallops next.

Delicious combination of spices and flavors that complements the scallops beautifully. I had a wild hair and made this as a pizza. I used the spice oil as a sauce base for veggies and scallops tossed in the spice oil, with cheese and cilantro on top. It was amazing. I used about 2tbs of lemon juice in the spice oil and some extra salt and pepper. I also did not use parsley, but I'm sure it would have been a good addition if I had it around. I will definitely make this again, both in pizza and other dishes!

We loved this recipe. I used all cilantro in the salad and next time with use less as a little goes a long way. The fresh lemon juice is a nice touch. I also added a bit of cayenne for spice

I liked this receipe a lot. My boyfriend LOVED it. The flavors are unique and taste great. I'd make it again but mainly for him.

Didn't own anything specifically called a 'spice mill' so I used my magic bullet, worked fine. Couldn't find flat leaf parsley so I had to use curly parsley. While it worked out fine, if you can find flat leaf parsley - get it, because the curly leaf parsley did not work as well with the salad texture. The dish was very rich, which is why 4 scallops were plenty for dinner. It was a good dish, fun to make, but probably not something I will cook again. (wondering if the scallops would have been better breaded? Possibly didn't season the scallops with enough salt and pepper. Also had a side of quinoa with my salad to help fill me up).

Switched Cayenne pepper in for Paprika and it worked! Delicious. My boyfriend was super happy with the sauce -- just the right amount of kick from the spice for someone who likes spice in moderate amounts.

This is the first review I have ever written and it is well deserved for this simple and elegant recipe. I agree with the previous reviewer that the spicy oil was just enough without overtaking the other flavors. My scallops were harvested by a friend in Florida and they were tender and delicious. We put our scallops on top of whole wheat orzo.

Yum! This was excellent...better than any restaurant. I purchased the scallops at Costco today. My husband and 28 year- old daughter loved this...and so did I. The spice oil is spicy without overtaking the recipe. My husband wants to try the spicy oil on other fish. The cilantro/flat-leaf parsley salad is tasty and makes for a beautiful presentation. My daughter took a picture and posted on FaceBook! It all tasted fresh, like summer! I did not change a thing. I will definitely make this again.
