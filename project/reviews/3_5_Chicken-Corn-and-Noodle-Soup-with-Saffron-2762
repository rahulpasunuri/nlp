This is an excellent soup that my entire family loved. Instead of using noodles, I used orzo, which did not get too mushy on reheating. I also love corn, so I added extra creamed corn. Fresh thyme also made a nice difference.

I tried this recipe years ago as a starter to my Thanksgiving dinner, in the UK. It was so easy and remained my favorite soup of all time. Measurements don't have to be accurate, you can just improvise as long as you have the main parts right. Saffron is essential for chicken soup now. Makes chicken soup taste like chicken soup. If that makes any sense. Anyway, I give this a 4 out of 4 forks. Loved it and am probably going to make it today.

Everyone loved this! I did alter it a little. I wanted a creamy soup so I added a little flour, corn starch (couldn't decide which so I added a little of both) and milk. It was delicious! This will be a staple.

Having grown up in Pa Dutch country, I've seen several reviewers throw in a dash of this or that to jazz it up. Might I suggest worstershire sauce? I always use that in this soup but my father would also add some pickle juice.

Excellent dish! The saffron makes the color gorgeous, which becomes even more intense if you add, as another reviewer suggested, a dash of balsamic vinegar. I substituted fresh dill for the parsley and herbs de provence for the thyme, and recommend using ample quantities of both, along with plenty of salt and pepper. A squeeze of lemon right at the end brings out the flavors even more.

In the interest of time, used the meat from half a rotisserie chicken bought at the supermarket. Easy and delicious. The saffron made an otherwise ordinary dish... something a little more special. This recipe is a keeper to be made again and again.

Whole wheat noodles will keep their firmness much better than standard egg noodles, which get mushy when reheated. Another hint: if a soup is bland, add a little salt or acid: a dash of nice vinegar, a rind of good parmesan, etc.

Just like Granny used to make! I've been craving my Pennsylvania Dutch grandmother's chicken corn soup since the weather turned cooler. Though Granny passed away years ago and I'm a continent away from PA Dutch country, this soup transported me right back to Granny's kitchen.

A nice, nourishing soup, wolfed down by adults, kids and a baby. Like another reviewer, I nixed the celery leaves b/c of bitterness. The only other change I made was to add a couple tablespoons of good balsamic vinegar (brand Fini) to punch up the flavor a little.

This is probably the best "get well" chicken soup I have made in preperation for the cold and flu season. Overall, the recipe could be 4 forks if regular chicken soup is your thing. I also used only chicken breasts, and I added about 1/2 cup extra corn. I omitted the celery leaves, as I think they are too bitter.

Delicious! My only comment is not to add too much salt. Also, I didn't wait the six hours from the first part, I just skimmed it, and it was fine. In addition to my husband and I, my 2-year-old gobbled it up!

I used chicken stock and meat from two previous chickens. I find the meat retains a lot of flavor that way, instead of boiling it in stock that has a metallic taste from the cans. Semolina noodles used. Except for those three changes, I follwed the recipe excatly. It was sooooo good! Agree with previous reviews about adding salt

This soup was really good. I used chicken breasts (diced and sauteed with the onions and celery) and a small teaspoon of chicken bouillion base just to "chicken" it up. YUM!

Skipped first part of recipe. Used two whole chicken breasts - simmered for 30 minutes after bringing broth to a boil.. Removed breasts from broth, cut apart and added back in AFTER adding saffron and noodles (bought extra wide and used about 6 oz.). JUST DELICIOUS...

We grow our own saffron and this soup is a welcome addition to the recipes we use our saffron in. My husband especially loved the rich-tasting, flavorful broth

Delicious recipe, especially the saffron broth. I used 1 whole chicken breast. Next time will use whole chicken as the bones add flavor. Also used fresh corn which I sauteed along with the other veggies. Substituted orchiette for the egg noodles. Loved the golden richness of the soup. Filling yet light. Perfect for a cold, foggy coastal evening dinner.

Great recipe: Dish should be served quickly after the egg noodles are added. If you are going to store the soup I would recomend using another type of noodle. The egg noodles have a tendancy to desolve unlike other noodles.

I used boneless chicken breasts, cut up and sauteed to simplify the preparation. I am on a low salt diet, so I couldn't add the salt and it was tasty and healthy, but bland.

All my guests thought this soup was scrumptious when I served it at Thanksgiving. I agree with the preceding review about the salt.

This is a delicious soup. The recipe needs to include the amount of salt needed when making chicken broth from scratch as that measurement is important. Needs salt!! Otherwise, very flavorful and full of life.
