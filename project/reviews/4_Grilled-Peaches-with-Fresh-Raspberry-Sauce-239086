It's a bit unfair of me to only rate this 2 forks when I admittedly adapted the recipe, however... At suggestions by earlier reviewers, I omitted adding the butter/sugar to the peaches - this was a mistake. The dish overall tasted really bland - the ice cream was the saving grace. If you choose not to add the butter/sugar, then at least add some cinnamon or something to the fruit before grilling. The raspberry sauce was good - definitely strain out the seeds as the recipe suggests.

This dish is fantastic on its own for a healthy dessert - no need to add ice cream. I like a little texture to my sauce, so didn't strain it. Guests Loved it!

I didn't add water to the raspberries - just the lemon and sugar. I didn't put butter or sugar on the peaches. I did serve with vanilla ice cream. It was delicious, and I will do it the same next time!

Excellent dish for a summer night. The simple raspberry sauce was a perfect combination for the peaches and ice cream. This is now part of our "summer menu rotation".

Great late summer treat - easy, fast and delicous. Used local peaches; like others have said, do not skip the ice cream!

This recipe is simple and deicious. Perfect for a summer day. You really don't even need to remove the raspberry seeds and that makes it much simpler and less time consuming. A huge hit!

Wow, so simple yet so good. I didn't even use butter, simply sprayed the peaches with olive oil spray. Fabulous.

Excellent and simple dessert. Used half strawberries and half raspberries for the sauce, which resulted in a thicker sauce, but very delicious. Vanilla ice cream is a must.

Wonderful. Everyone raved. Will try with Splenda rather than sugar next time.
