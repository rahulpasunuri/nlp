I live in Manhattan with no access to a grill, but wanted to try these anyway. (I LOVE pork ribs). I cooked them on 250 for 3 hrs based on earlier comments, starting them dry and then turning and mopping them with sauce every hour, and finally finishing them under the broiler to crisp them up. I will readily admit I was very hesitant about the sauce: not only didn't I love it once I finished it, I kind of downright hated it. I ran a taste test early in the morning before guests arrived by quickly finishing one rib (which had been resting in the rub) and I'm so glad I did--somehow, when the sauce and rub come together, they're fantastic. You can tell by the reviews that this recipe is clearly polarizing, but you should give these recipes the benefit of the doubt and try them. (Only recipe changes: reduced bourbon--Booker's--to 1 cup. It's very evident in the taste, so use something you love. Bourbon (neat) is my go-to-drink, but it was a bit much for even me. Also couldn't find cardamom, so omitted). Expanding on my theme of "Manhattan BBQ," I paired these with the Stone Fruit Slaw and Lemon Parmesan Risotto from this site (instead of coleslaw and mac & cheese). Five of us ate 7lbs of ribs, a recipe of slaw, and half the recipe of risotto. I'll call that success.

The bbq sauce is amazing! Makes tons - cut it down by half. Rub is also awesome. This will be our go to recipe for ribs.

Made this fabulous rib recipe yet again over 4th of July, with a few modifications. Added additional brown sugar, salt and onion powder to the dry rub, put it on the ribs and left them for two days. Added additional brown sugar, vinegar and Worchestershire to the sauce. Cooked the ribs for an hour and a half on the BBQ at 250 and then seared them off with the sauce at the end. Made three times the recipe and there still wasn't any left -- and the two Texans and die-hard BBQ fans present loved it. Note - the quality of the mustard, ketchup and bourbon matters. Don't skimp!

Great recipe. Use half the amount of bourbon of twice the quality you would have otherwise used.

I'm going to agree with the minority reviews and say that I thought the sauce was to sweet and the flavors didn't seem to mesh well.

I've been using this rub recipe probably since it was published in '98. I made the sauce the first time and it was very good but I had so much left, I've never made it again. I use store bought sauce. Yesterday, I sprinkled the rub on on lightly oiled, par-boiled sweet potato wedges before I put them on the grill. Per Bobby Flay, I finished them with a light glaze of maple syrup mixed with dijon mustard. Awesome!

Rating: 4
This recipe is awesome, seriously impressive. My dinner guests were so quiet while they were eating, I was worried they didn't like it, but actually they were scarfing it down with delight. Note: I threw sauce ingredients with overnight-rubbed meat in the crock-pot for 10 hours on low instead of grilling to make it easier on a weeknight, and it turned out insane (not too mushy or weird).

Rating: 4
This is the only recipe I use when I make ribs, AND it's the only BBQ sauce I use, period. I make it with all-organic ingredients (yes it makes a difference) and I omit the bourbon altogether. I think the spice combination is fantastic. Other reviewers think it's odd, but not me! Tip: if you don't like a certain spice, leave it out! =) Anyway, I made jars of this sauce out of the bajillion tomatoes from my garden this year (it's about a 6 hour process when you start from scratch, but again, it's well worth it), and I had people offering to pay me for some, it's so good.

I made the dry rub and Neely's sauce. If I made this again, which I probably won't, I'd cut way, way back on the cumin.

When our favorite rib joint left town and the new bbq joint didn't work for us I thought I should try this recipe. This dish worked out great. I made and applied the rub as directed, putting the ribs in fridge for 24 hrs. I followed the sauce recipe closely except I used 2 6oz cans of tomato paste - i hate having half used cans of paste roaming the fridge. After having made the sauce the only change for next time would be to use LESS bourbon, the flavor was a little too strong for me. These ribs were great! I don't miss the old rib joint any more.

Rating: 4
People still talk about the times I've made this recipe and how many ribs actually got eaten. The Rub is great, even if you use it with store bought sauce. That said, this sauce is really, really good. One tweak I added was letting the ribs bake, covered with foil and a combination of apple juice and apple vinegar at 150 for up to four hours before grilling.

We are now in our tenth year of using this recipe exclusively when making ribs. Our friends will not let us try anything else. We don't bother cooking the ribs in the oven-- the grill does a fine job and I'm sure adds more flavor. I always make extra sauce, by request, to send home with our guests. These are the best ribs you will ever cook.

Rating: 4
Exceptional. We have made this serveral times for barbecues and every time our guests rave about how good these are. Suggestions 1) Slow-cook them for 4 hours at 250. 2) Don't wrap them tightly in foil in the oven. The foil steams them and they're better when they're roasted dry. 3) Brush on a bit of sauce halfway through the roasting 4) If you double the recipe for the ribs, you still only need one batch of sauce, because this makes a LOT of sauce. Very time consuming to make, but an outstanding recipe and well worth the effort. We made 5 racks of ribs and that served 20 people.

Rating: 2
I was disappointed by this recipe. I had to make a couple changes to the sauce so maybe that accounts for it: yellow mustard for half of the mustard (ran out of the good stuff), and only about 1 cup of whiskey instead of the bourbon. The rub I did exactly per the recipe & I thought those flavors were strange also. I cooked it wrapped in foil at 250 F for four hours, then grilled them for about 10 minutes... the ribs were tender but I didn't love the seasonings.

Rating: 2
Made these for July 4th and we thought they were just OK. The various ingredients of the sauce came through but seemed to be dominated by the mustard and bourbon- and not in a good way. Per the instructions of the butcher at our gourmet grocery store, after putting on the rub, we wrapped in foil and refrigerated for the day. We then baked at 350 degrees for 2 hours then grilled- it came out very moist and juicy.

Rating: 4
We are old hands at baby back ribs on the grill so I was reluctant to deviate from our 'tried and true.' This recipe did not disappoint! My husband, kids and another family of four devoured 2 1/2 slabs. I have already been asked to reprise the meal! I made the recipe but omitted the ancho chile as it was unavailable in our store that day. I put the rub on early in the morning and refrigerated the ribs all day. We cooked them on the gas grill - very low for about 45 minutes. My husband then brushed the sauce on and cooked for 10 minutes more. I think that the multiple cooking steps seems unnecessary. Simply put on the grill and use the sauce to finish. So easy!

After introducing these ribs to a Maine island July 4th fete, seven years later I am asked (begged!) to bring these to the beach party. Worth every moment of prep time and no need to change a thing, though the suggestions are well thought out.

We loved this recipe. The dry rub was flavorful, reminded me of the dry ribs they serve in Memphis. Didn't have an ancho chile, but didn't miss it. The sauce smelled wonderful and didn't disappoint. Had enough to freeze extra for later use. Mmmmm, good. Meat fell off the bones; tender and moist. I did put a cup of water in the roasting pan before I sealed it in foil.

Try these ribs and you will be pleased. I subbed apple butter for the juice, and chipotle en adobo for the ancho as it was on hand. ribs in oven for 3 hours on 300 and then finished off on the grill with sauce. I only had time to let the rub set for a few hours, but it was plenty. I agree with minimizing the cinnamon.

Oh my Goodness.......delicious! I let the ribs sit in the fridge for two days with the dry rub on. Cooked them for 2 1/2 hours @ 200 degrees then uncovered them and turned up the heat to 225 for another hour or so. Depends on how dry you like them. Took the recommendation to make the sauce the day before, excellent idea. Sauce had just enough bite. A very good receipe for that special occasion. A keeper!

This is a fantastic recipe for ribs. If you want to wow some guests with a great weekend barbecue, definitely make this recipe. Preparing the sauce ahead of time and freezing it or storing it in the fridge really make the process go a lot quicker.I would definitely suggest that you cut the salt from 1Tbsp down to 1/2 Tbsp and reduce the cayenne to 1 or 1/2 teaspoon.

Rub is excellent, and I know my rubs - use about 1/2 cinnamon to get the flavor of it. Can wrap in foil and bake at 225 for 3-5 hours and heat up on bbque or even in oven. Worth trying

two out of three in my house loved it, one thought the cinnamon too prevalent. I added liquid smoke to the BBQ sauce and would probable reduce the sweetness slightly next time. I also added a couple jalepeno peppers to the sauce to kick up the heat.

I haven't eaten the ribs yet I'll rate them afterwards too, but I didn't have apple juice so I added apple butter instead. It is really tasty! Of course, I like my rib sauce sweet. My husband thinks I could cut out the brown sugar if I'm adding apple butter to it. Very good sauce though. I also substituted chipotle chiles in adobo sauce instead of the ancho.

First;I sub'd chipolte pepper in sauce(to taste) for the ancho chili in the sauce recipe.I cut back the cardamom and cinnamom to 1 teas.in the rub recipe.Then I rubbed the ribs the night before and let them sit covered in the fridge.Next morning I sliced raw sweet white onions over the top of the ribs,covered in foil for 5 hrs.at 225,then slathered the ribs with sauce,covered them and let them sit while I fixed up the side dishes to serve with the ribs.Put them on the grill for 10-15 minutes.Done.Superb.The sauce becomes thick and smooth if you puree the vegetables before cooking them;it is great to have in the fridge for other chicken recipes.some people like bbque sauce on pizza,this could work. Be sure to save some sauce to heat up and serve alongside the ribs for dipping.Not only a 4 fork rating..4 napkins as well!

Agree totally with kimilew from Minnetonka (5/1/06). Use this recipe for the sauce recipe and the rib rub recipe, but cook the ribs in a low oven for several hours (can even use the cheaper spare ribs this way) then finish off on the BBQ. Fall off the bone good. Never had a better rib and guests RAVE!!!

Tasty recipe...the ribs had a more complex flavor than the chili rubbed ribs which has is more typical of rib dry rubs. I did both using the boil in beer technique from the chili rubbed ribs recipe, but used the sauce from this one. The sauce surprisingly worked extremely well on chicken wings as well. This will end up in my rotation...

This was amazing! I made only one change--I pre-cooked the ribs in beer for about 2 hours for tenderness--check another recipe on this site Chili rubbed Babybacks with Espresso BBQ sauce. I like this sauce better, but pre-cooked them like the other recipe. This is my new favorite!!

Everyone who has tried them has been blown away by them. I highly recommend it to everyone.

I tweaked the rub recipe a bit and made the sauce without the bourbon since a lot of children were at the party. Everyone loved the bold yet subtle flavors of the rub and the sauce was the kicker that put it over the edge. Fantastic recipe.. Cook'em slow and low and your good to go!

I don't even know where to begin!!!! These ribs were OUTSTANDING!!!!! They were so flavorful and falling off of the bone. After marinating them with the rub overnight, I cooked them in the oven at 225 degrees, covered with foil for about 3 hours. Half way through I basted them with the YUMMY sauce, I then grilled them for about 15 minutes basting them with the sauce. They were so unbelievably tasty!!!! The best ribs I have EVER had............hands down.

Only twice have I made a recipe that my family has asked me to make again. These ribs, however, have become 'The Ribs' to anyone that's had them. For special occaisions or if someone is coming to visit, the first question is whether I can make the ribs, and how spicy to make them. My father can't eat spicy food, as he starts sweating and flushes red (seriously, ketchup is spicy to him) but he will eat these, and asks me to make them. A lot of work and planning goes into making these well, and you can taste a lot of difference depending on the label of bourbon you use. I'll usually go with Maker's Mark, or Knob Creek for a little smokier taste. I've made a double-batch of the bbq sauce, but it always tastes better from a single batch...go figure, but just one thing I've found out. If you've never made them, try it out. It's a lot of work, but worth it.

MAKE THESE RIBS!!!I've been making these ribs for the past 3 years and everytime I do, every one goes wild! All agree, they are the best ribs ever: even those who swore they made the best ribs until they had mine!I put the rub on 2 days and slow cook at 200 for approx 6 hours basting with the sauce and then put on grill for no more than 10 minutes total. They fall off the bone!! Don't listen to the reviewers who did not like, they're either lying or have no taste buds or completely screwed-up the recipe. Trust me, you and your guests won't be disappointed!!

Tried the rub and the sauce on two racks of Neiman Ranch St. Louis ribs, as a departure from my usual dry rub and spicy sauce. Thought I had everything on hand, as husband drinks Jack Daniels, but we'd run out, so I improvised with Myers Dark Rum and felt that orange juice would be a better complement than apple. The sauce turned out surprisngly well, although I would have preferred using the Jack. Plenty of sauce left over for future use which need not be frozen (cook from PA take note) - it keeps for weeks in the fridge. We grilled in Weber gas grill on medium indirect heat for about 90 minutes, then served dry with the sauce for dipping.

Rating: 4
Glad you find yourself so amusing, Nebraska... you must be new to Epicurious, as variations on your "joke" have been posted for years. Anyways, on to important matters: these fantastic ribs! The rub was aromatic and added wonderful complexity to the dish (though I cut the cumin a bit, as I find it usually overpowers whatever else it's in combination with). The sauce made aproximately double what was needed, so I froze the leftovers and used it on chicken a week later. That was also great.

Rating: 3
We loved this recipe but because my husband doesn't eat pork we substituted three packs of fish sticks for the ribs. As I am a recovering alcoholic we used a pint and a half of sour cream instead of the bourbon and two cups of honey-nut peanut butter in place of the mustard. (Boiling the fish sticks first really makes them tender.) It was absolutely delicious.

WOW! These were incredible! I made them for my husband for Father's Day, and what a bang! My husband loved them, and so did I. The flavor is so intense. I took advice from several of the reviewers. I put the dry rub on the day before and wrapped the racks in foil, kept in 'fridge overnight. Then, I baked them for 4 hours @ 250 (added sauce at 2 hours), put on another layer of sauce and grilled them for about 5 min. a side on medium heat. Served extra sauce on the side. Perfect, tender, and falling off the bone. Sauce was delicious and makes a ton. I didn't have bourbon, so i substitued Jack Daniel's Whiskey that worked great. I also threw in some fresh thyme towards the end of the sauce thickening.

Rating: 1
Clearly I am in the minority here (no offense meant to those who loved these). BUT, I baked the ribs for 4.5 hrs @ 260. They DID "fall off the bone", to the extent I couldn't get them onto the grill in one piece; the texture of the meat was no longer "meaty" but more "mushy". Cardamom (@ $11/2oz) & cinnamon in the rub way too noticeable. Way, way, way too much (& too sweet) sauce (an entire jar of grainy mustard!) I am going back to the "Moore County Dry Rub" & the cooking method (indirect cooking, on the grill) in the "Jack Daniel's Old Time Barbecue Book". Easier, quicker, cheaper & tastier (to us anyway).

These were some of the best tasting ribs I've had in many years. The combination of sauce and spice rub made for an awesome meal--forcing me to give a 4 fork rating (If 3.5 forks were available, I'd do that as very, very few recipes rate 4 forks. But this was better than 3 forks.). I too cooked the ribs in a 250 oven until they were done and then transfered them to the grill at the end. I added in extra bourbon as recommended. The sauce did take longer to prepare than I originally thought (I didn't realize that it needed an hour to cook). But since my ribs were still cooking, it all worked out fine. A definite keeper.

I have been making these ribs since the recipe first appeared in 1998 and at last nights dinner once again they were excellent. My summer guest at out home in Maine expect them every year, (lobster too) they are a real crowd pleaser. I have modified the cooking slightly, before applying the fabulous Mustard Bourbon Sauce cut the slabs into easy to manage portions, 4 to 6 ribs apply the sauce cook over low heat grill until brown and crisp.

This is the second time I have tried this recipe. The first time I screwed up cooking the ribs (lacking skill on the barbeque I guess!) This time the ribs were fantastic. I made some changes to the dry rub: Reduced cardamom and cinnamon in the dry rub to 1tsp. Reduced cumin to 1Tsp. For the sauce, reduced brown sugar to half the amount. The white onion was also reduced by half. I made only half the sauce amount (even then, I had more than enough sauce leftover) I simmered the sauce for a long time (2 hours, at least) and I thought this was important for the flavors to blend. I also did not find the sauce too chunky. Maybe cooking for so long smoothes things out a bit. The sauce came out great! Slightly spicy, slightly sweet... perfect! I cooked the ribs on low indirect heat on the barbeque with a pan of water underneath for about 3 1/2 hours. As a side note, I made some chicken wings at the same time, cooked for 3 hours (no dry rub, but basted with sauce for the last 10 minutes). These were also the best chicken wings I have ever had.

Beyond delicious! The best way we have found to make these is to put the dry rub on, wrap in foil, and refrigerate overnight. Then, bake them for several hours (4-6) at 250 degrees until they are very tender. After that, all they need is a slatering of sauce and a quick flashing on the grill. Be sure to serve with extra sauce for your guests! They will be fall-off-the-bone delicious!!!

I know, this is a question, not a review, but I need to know! I plan on slow cooking them in the oven before grilling. Should they go in there dry, with just the rub? Covered? Wrapped in foil? Any advice appreciated - I'm making these for my fiance's birthday party!

Fabulous and delicious...got rave reviews from our guests. There were no leftovers. We slow baked the ribs at 250 degrees F for 4 hours and then finished on the grill as others recommended. Use good quality Bourbon and don't skimp on the amount. My husband added some chipotle chilis, honey, some red pepper flakes and some Egyptian pepper since our group likes spicy food....also simmered the sauce for several hours before using. I have no idea why people call the sauce chunky unless they aren't mincing the onion. You definitely don't need to puree/cuisinart this sauce. Putting the rub on the ribs the day before is best. A good Zinfandel will go well with this recipe, like Ridge. Truely the best ribs any of us have ever eaten!!

The recipe for these ribs is definitley a keeper. My boyfriend liked the sauce so much he poured it all over the garlic mashed potatoes and the braised baby bok choy I made to go with them. I halved the sauce recipe and still have enough leftover for a few more meals. We don't have a barbeque (sob), so I took the advice of others and baked them covered in the oven for a few hours on a low temperature and then finished under the broiler after slathering on the sauce. The result was fall off the bone tender meat that we soon won't forget.

If you are not on a diet or worried about sugar, this is a delicious recipe. I used 3lb meat for 4 and made 1/3 the amount of sauce. There was still plenty of sauce left. Used Scotch Whisky because I didn't have Bourbon. Seemed to work ok. Baked at 260F for 3 hrs as suggested before broiling for 7 min. and the meat came off the bones very easily. A very good suggestion for all future rib preparations.

I've made this ribs recipe several times. It is the perfect backyard-cookout-summer food. The sauce makes plenty for those who like to dip their ribs while they're eating and for the rest of us there is enough for two meals. The sauce leftovers freeze fine so the work can be done ahead of time.

I never made baby back ribs before and I chose this recipe because of the fantastic reviews. I reviewed all of the reviews and made a few modifications to the recipe. As suggested, I did bake the ribs at 260 for 3 1/2 hours. I cut the water but I found that the sauce was a bit too thick. I also doubled the dry rub and did a "shake n' a bag" to coat the ribs completely. I also took the suggestion of blending the sauce. By nature of the ingredients it will not be completely smooth. Next time, I might use 1 cup of bourbon. It had a very strong smell and taste in the sauce. I also added a jalepano pepper. I couldn't find any dry chilpolte. I made this for Labor Day and everyone enjoyed the ribs. This will be an annual holiday tradition!

My favorite barbecue/grilled rib recipe. Frankly, I usually use "baby back" ribs, which tend to be less meaty, but I can Grill in 30-40 min. You can eat these ribs withouth sauce, just the rub after grilling, but the sauce is very good. I freeze extra sauce for use later.

Fantastic, superb, astoundingly flavorful. Too many superlatives to list. As with any recipe, the final product is only as good as the main ingredient. Why skimp and buy measly ribs when you can spend a few more bucks on some meaty ones - especially if you're gonna dress the ribs up in diamonds and pearls? (The rub's flavor is particularly striking.) I turned my standard Weber charcoal grill into a smoker, used apple wood chips, monitored the temp @ 260 - 300, and three hours later my sashimi-lite boyfriend declared, "Damn! Those are some good ribs!"

Rating: 4
The crowd I run with is usually a very loud and talkative bunch, but once the food was on the table the only sounds heard were the nearly vulgar groans of sheer delight. Variations? Not many. I took the advice of another cook and threw the ribs (covered) in a 260 degree oven for 4-5 hours, then basted them and grilled them for 10 minutes. As an added benefit, the pan drippings were an excellent base for a killer gravy that gave my mashed taters a boost. For the sauce I substituted 2 dried chipotles for the large ancho. I like things spicy, so I would have been happier with twice that many, but do so at your own peril. I also cooked the sauce longer. Serve your ribs with a nice jammy red Zinfandel from California and invite me over for dinner!

Everyone loved them.

Great tasting rub and sauce. I've made this twice to rave reviews. However, I didn't grill them. My wife has one of those clay bakers from Pampered Chef so I put 8 lbs. of rubbed ribs into it (plus an open can of beer, half gone) and cooked at 250 degrees for 4.5 hours or so. Took the lid off, basted with the sauce for another half-hour or so and they're done to fall of the bone tenderness (lots of spotless bones afterward). The oven makes it real easy to pull this recipe off on a busy Saturday without having to worry about maintaining the grill's temperature.

I couldn't stop dipping my spoon into this sauce as it cooked. At first i thought the bourbon would be overpowering for my taste, but the end result was fantastic.

Terrific! These were some of the best ribs we've ever eaten and very easy to make. Yes, the sauce is sort of chunky, but what's wrong with that? (throw it in the food processor if you must) The taste is amazing -- don't skip or sub the Bourbon!

I have been searching for perfect Rib recipe to make at home. My ribs were a bit thin so they got a bit overdone on the grill, But!! The sauce was one of the best things I have ever made. Will use again for different ribs and chicken. I used Seagrams 7 since that is what I had -Also did not have the correct pepper or enough scallions but it still came out great, Next time I will use St Lousi Style Ribs - but may use a good Commercial Rub and just make the sauce. Maybe I will Cook a Boston Butt and make pulled pork and use the Sauce Wonderful!

These ribs are phenomenal. Twenty-five friends also agreed with me this past weekend. It was our fifth annual RibFest and these are the stars of the day. We managed to slow-cook them [about 250 degrees for three hours], before saucing them and then grilling them, for the first time and everyone agreed they were the best to date. The meat pulled right off the bone. The guy from Asheville, NC got it right when he mentioned the four or five flavor stages. That is the power of these ribs... so many flavors blended so smoothly. Absolutely delicious. Concern/Comment about some 2-fork reviews : how can you rate the recipe if you don't follow it? No where does the recipe call for steaming the ribs. Perhaps that is WHY they just tasted okay, not in spite of. Make them however you like but I don't understand how a recipe can be bashed if it wasn't followed properly in the first place...

Maybe I didn't cook the ribs right...steamed them before throwing on the grill but the ribs turned out just okay. Sauce is a lot of work for a taste that I have made just as taste as good or better starting with a bottle sauce and then adding some additional ingredients. I also pureed the sauce since I found it to be way too chunky for a bbq sauce. Oh well, have a lot in the freezer so I can try making them again with different results by cooking the ribs differently.

The first time I tasted this was at a diplomat's home in the middle east. I HAD to have the recipe and have made it numerous times for guests who rave about it - it's "to die for." Now I double the sauce and spice rub recipe and freeze it for a quick meal later. Love it!

This recipe was a lot of work for little results. The sauce is too chunky. I expected to be knocked off my feet with all the tasty ingredients. I wished I had bought KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce instead.

Best BBQ sauce ever! Prep looks extensive, but is relatively straight forward and definitely worth the effort. Strongly recommend other reviewers suggestion of blending sauce. This recipe doesn't need any modification. It's one of the few that stands on its own.

My husband did this over the weekend, only rather than ribs did a boneless pork loin roast. We put it on the (Weber) grill rotisserie and basted during the last hour with the sauce. When finished, drizzled some of the sauce over the carved meat and served some of the extra sauce on the side, although not much extra was used--the meat had a wonderful flavor. Outstanding flavors! I like the suggestion of using chipotle in adobo for a taste variation, and will try it with ribs next time.

If I were a big meaty rib, I would love to be treated this way! Sweet, Lord, keep me near the cross--this is good eatin'! The flavor hits the mouth in four or five grand stanges. Excellent! I actually heard someone at my barbecue say (in response to a question) "Can't talk, food good." If any of you have married a southerner and are out to impress the inlaws, make this recipe. That'll shut 'em up.

My husband and I HATED these. I gave our neighbor a jar of the sauce which he enjoyed.

To look at this recipe it seems a little overwhelming because of its many ingredients (dry rub and sauce), but it is definitely worth the time. This recipe is sensational. We had this on 4th of July and luckily we fixed tons of ribs because people could not stop eating them!! A real winner.

Rating: 4
Tried it the stated way and then made the following changes for the better. Had the butcher remove the membrane off the back of the ribs. Blended the sauce after cooking in a food processor. Made a double portion of the rub but cut back on the cardamom and the cinnamon by one half (for four racks of ribs). Smoked the ribs for two hours over mesquite in a smoker, then cooled, brushed on sauce and refrigerated. Brushed on sauce again before grilling for about 5-7 minutes per side. Served with Seghesio Old Vine and Hartford Court Highwire Zinfandels (1997-2000). The DID wine group loved it.

Rating: 4
Wow! Uniques flavor. My husband thought these were the best ribs ever. Did them for the 4th and they were a hit. We followed the recipe except subbed chipotle chilis as suggested and our ribs took far less time to cook; only 20 minuntes first time on the grill. I think next time I would process the sauce so it would have a smooth textures, but sauce is fine as is too. YUM!

Rating: 3
Don't get me wrong, this recipe wasn't bad. The flavor of these ribs has sort of an Indian or Middle Eastern flavor to it. But as a southerner, I've come to realize there's only one way to enjoy ribs; smoked in either a vinegar or tomato based glaze, slooooow cooked over a low fire. Mmmmm, makes your mouth water, doesn't it? :) So if you're looking for some of those down home style ribs, keep on lookin', because this isn't it! But if you're looking for something completely different in spare ribs, then these are pretty darned good!

I have rated very few recipes 4-forks, but this deserved it!!! I read all the reviews and suggestions, and will distill them here for you. BARBEQUE SAUCE: I did use only one bunch of green onions and only 2 teasp. cumin in the sauce--good calls. I started with less brown sugar, but to my taste it needed the full 2 cups. Also, mine needed 2 6-oz cans of tomato paste. I did not understand adding 1 cup water then reducing the liquid (??). I added no water, but increased the apple juice to 1 1/2 cups. In lieu of the ancho chili, I used 2 peppers from a can of 'chipotle in adobo'--great--loved the smokiness. {Note: I grated the 2 lg onions in the food processor and sauteed them with the minced garlic and chopped green onions--then pureed with the apple juice and tomato paste for a nice smooth texture) RUB: used only 1 T cumin and 1/2 teasp cinnamon--good recommendations from others. I used ancho instead of "chili" powder, and chipotle instead of cayenne pepper. The rub is SO wonderful smelling--it's the cardamon that makes it!! COOKING METHOD: I wrapped the 'rubbed' ribs in heavy-duty foil then refrigerated them for 2 days. I placed the foil packets on cookie sheets in a 250 degree oven and baked them for 3 hours. I chilled them, then cut into individual ribs--placed them on a cookie sheet and covered them well with about 3 cups of sauce. I grilled them over low heat for about 5-7 mins/side. Absolutely fabulous!!! They were tender, aromatic, and absolutely delicious!!! (I hope this tedious review is helpful!) {FOLLOW_UP: I made these the first time with spare ribs, the second time with baby backs. To our great surprise, we prefered the spare ribs--more meat and no less tender!}

We have made this twice. The first time I did as many suggested and baked at about 250 for a couple hours. The second time we did it as the recipe is written on the grill. We thought it was much better.

I made this recipe when I first found it in Bon Appetit and I loved it. Unfortunately, I lost the recipe. I have been looking for it forever, and I am so happy that I found it again. It may seem like a lot of work to someone who is used to simply putting on some store-bought barbeque sauce on the ribs and grilling them. However, it is worth using the rub and the fresh sauce. You will not be disapointed with this recipe.

Rating: 4
This is the best rib recipe that I have ever had. I listened to other reveiws and used chipotles instead of ancho peppers but I kept the full amount of brown sugar we all loved the smoky, spicy, sweet combination absolutly fabulous. The only other thing i change was that I used Rye whiskey, Crown Royal, instead of the bourbon.

Rating: 3
I followed the advice of other reviewers and made the following (all successful) adjustments. I used only 1 1/2 c brown sugar, eliminated the water, added 1 dried chipotle (could have had more) and reduced the cumin in the rub to 1 tbs. The most significant change I made was replacing the bourbon with the same amount of Boddington's ale (someone drank my bourbon without telling me). I really couldn't taste the ale, but I think it provided some extra depth to the sauce. The ribs were great but they could have had a bit more zing in them, next time I'll add more chipotles. I baked them, covered, for about 50 minutes at 400 F, then grilled with sauce for about 5-10 minutes. They were a bit tough but everyone loved them anyway :-) We had a lot of sauce left over since I just basted the ribs a few times, but it has been great as a condiment for hamburgers, eggs, etc. I will probably make the sauce separately and give it as gifts.

These are delicious ribs!! It does take some time,but the results are well worth it. We make these the day before entertaining and reheat them before serving. There are some wonderful rib recipes out there,but these are outstanding and different.

We served this at a recent dinner party and the reviews from everyone were fantastic. I spent the next three days emailing the recipe to friends who attended as all wanted it for their own collections. It's a little time consuming and you must plan ahead, but well worth it. The ribs were so tender that they melted in your mouth! We are going to add this meal to our Special Events Calendars and make it a traditional meal for winter and summer parties. I am also making up the sauce and rub to add to gift baskets for the Holidays.

Rating: 3
These ribs are fantastic, and I made them twice last summer, once using charcoal and once using a gas grill, great either way. As others have noted, the recipe makes a lot of sauce, so I froze some, with the idea of using it to make a pot roast when the weather turned to fall. I mention this only so that others who may be similarly inclined might be spared from making a big mistake. It was awful, so sweet that even my teenage daughter, who puts sugar on her frosted flakes, didn't like it. The sauce itself freezes well, though, and tasted terrific before I married it with the brisket. Maybe I will do oven roasted pork ribs with the rest.

I have been making this recipe for ribs since I found it in the print version of Bon Appetit in 1998, and think I can shed some light on the reviews. 9 out of 10 consider it the finest recipe for ribs ever created. The few others find it to have some overwhelming flavors that are unusual for ribs, and it can be expensive to make. And that's just it, the cardamom, cumin, and cinnamon are the key to it's success, but those unusual flavors for ribs will have the occasional person perplexed - it's much more than your supermarket-out-of-the-bottle barbeque. Don't alter this recipe; if so everyone will still like it but it won't have the 9 out of 10 people telling you to open up a barbeque restaurant. So make this recipe knowing that you won't have every single person at the party happy (maybe 1 in 20), but the rest will consider you a barbeque god. An example of this recipe's success...first made it at a family reunion in '98 for about 100 Southern folks (I'm from L.A. and wanted to impress them). Most of the men there bbq'd every day and knew their barbeque. When I served the ribs, music stopped, talking stopped, other ribs were set aside, and 100 people looked as if they were eating the best ribs they ever had. Oh, and make sure to use a quality bourbon.

We are rib fans from Texas and found this recipe to be just perfect. We made it with four racks instead of three, and found that the recipe provided enough rub and MORE than enough sauce for all four racks.

I am another who was disappointed after reading all the raves. I should have heeded the reviewers who said too much cumin in the sauce and cinnamon in the rub. My spices are from Penzey's and perhaps they are more potent, but the sauce definitely had a pronounced cumin flavor and the cinnamon was definitely the dominant flavor in the rub. I did half the recipe. Also was not very happy with the texture. Just my opinion, and realize I am in the minority. I only prepared two racks of ribs and as our gas grill is pretty hot for long cooking, I put the ribs in a jelly roll pan, covered with foil (after they had marinated overnight in the rub) and baked at 300 for a couple of hours. Then finished on the grill with the sauce. They were very tender and crisped nicely. I just have better sauce recipes.

Rating: 3
When I made the sauce, my boyfriend was very skeptical about the amount of bourbon that it called for. After it simmered an hour, I caught him dipping bread in it several times! It was a little too sweet for my taste (I'd halve the brown sugar and add more of the ancho chili pepper), but with the spicy ribs, it was balanced enough. He loved it and I must say that I ate my fair share, too.

I've been making this recipe since it came out in the July 1998 Bon Appetit. I cannot tell you how many people I've cooked it for and how many tell me it should be patented! It is quick to impress and it's a sure thing! The most important key to this recipe is ensuring that the rub sits on the ribs overnight if not two nights prior to BBQ. That makes the difference between tender and a little tough. Also, the sauce is equally as good on BBQ chicken. A sure way to impress guests in the summertime!

The sauce did nothing for me. Despite halving the sugar amount, it tasted too sweet for our liking. I also felt the heat needed to be jazzed up a bit with hot sauce, which I think did help the taste overrall. The cinnamon seemed a bit strong for the rub. I would suggest decreasing the amount just a bit. In conclusion, there many ingredients to this recipe that I felt need more tweeking to get it just right.

Rating: 2
I think the cook from Anchorage are on the same page. I did precook at 250 for 2 hours so the ribs were tender but the sauce was something to do without. The cinnamon really didn't belong in it at all, and I too originally reduced the brown sugar but ended up putting it back to trying to salvage it. All in all, I too have tasted better out of a bottle and will not be adding this to my favorite Epicurious collection.

Rating: 2
O.K. this is the first time I made ribs and I was not impressed. While the ribs were in the oven, were they supposed to be wrapped in foil? Mine will be next time. The sauce was good, if a little to sweet. I even reduce the sugar as suggested. However my inattention at the grill caused them to burn. NO one said anything but I know they were disappointed and may not come over next time I do ribs. guess I will have to lure them with my yummy grilled London broil and suprise them with 'supervised' ribs. Practice makes perfect!

I made these last weekend, taking into account some of the oft-repeated recommendations such as pureeing the sauce. I also cooked slowly in the oven for 2 hours, and finished on the grill. The ribs cooked fine - very tender. It was the sauce I wasn't crazy about. I reduced the brown sugar, but then added more in as I thought it needed it. My husband and I both agreed this was an "okay" recipe, but nothing great. He liked the rub quite a bit, but used very little sauce (and this is a guy who puts sauce on everything]. I thought cinnamon in the rub was too overwhelming. I would try a different recipe next time I make ribs. Personally, I've tasted better bar-be-cue sauces from a bottle. [I'll probably get Epicurian 50 lashes for that!!] I am clearly in the minority on this, however, so I'd try it if you're so inclined. Bon Appetite!

This was a fantastic recipe. I was so pleased with everyone's reaction. I admit I was skeptical while cooking the sauce, it didn't smell very yummy at the time. BUT my guests demolished these ribs! They really loved them. I followed the other reviews suggestions and par baked the ribs for 2 hours at 250 degrees, and I put the onions through the food processor to make the sauce less chunky. These ribs were ALOT of work but I would definitely make these again.

I reveiwed the recipe for Cherry Cola Glazed ribs last week (I used baby backs there instead of the spare ribs) and read that lots of reveiwers were talking about this recipe, so I decided to try it. I read all the reveiws first and did the following: I coated the ribs with the dry rub,wrapped them in foil and refrigerated them overnight. I brought them to room temp and baked them for 2 hours at 325. I made the sauce a couple of days before and instead of chopping the onions and garlic, I quartered them and put them into the food processor whirling them until very fine (using only 1 bunch of green onions), I sauted them as directed and proceeded as instructed except instead of chopping the dried Ancho, I plopped the whole thing into the pot and simmered as directed. When done, I removed the pepper and discarded it, the sauce was pretty smooth so there was no need to puree it (thanks to the prior processing of the onions, etc.). When the ribs were cool enough to handle,I brushed them with sauce and let sit for about 2 hours, in the frig of course, (brought them to room temp and threw them on the grill, basting as necessary with the sauce, for about 8 minutes on each side.We shared some with our neighbor who agreed, they were the best ribs he had ever eaten. We love the Cherry Cola ribs (I've made them several times) but there is no way to compare the 2 recipes, they are way too different and both make excellent baby backs!!!! Oh yes, I used Maker's Mark bourbon. If you don't like onions, green onions or bourbon, better make something different but if you do, OH YEAH!!

WOW! Very, very good. I took the suggestion of blending the sauce, very good idea. We threw some soaked hickory and pecan chips on top of the rocks of our gas grill.

Ohhhh. I love these ribs. They are fantastic. I've used this recipe four or five times now, with a few changes here and there, and they are always stupendous. The recipe, as it stands, is wonderful. However, I've done things like, substituted the ancho (which is so mild as to be undetectable-- ancho lends color-- not heat, at least if you're a New Mexican) with chipoltle in adobo for a wonderful smokey heat which compliments the Beam nicely. I've pureed everything in a blender, which leaves the sauce smooth as silk, which I prefer. I've substituted the apple juice for apple jack, which is awesome. All of these things are interchangeable. Slow cooking the ribs prior to bbq-ing is not, though. That makes them divinely tender.

First of all, I completely agree with all the other reviewers that these were probably the best damn ribs we ever had. I would,however, recommend some changes to the sauce. I found that the amount of both onions that it called for made the sauce much too chunky. I also thought the amount of green onions made the sauce much too scalliony. To correct both problems, I strained the sauce through a collander (removed the chunks and the offending green onions' flavor), and to correct the remaining overkill of green onions, I added some maple syrup. Next time, I'll cut or eliminate the green onions and maybe just puree the sauce. The third problem with the sauce was that there was not even a trace of heat to it, so I added a half bottle of our favorite mild Habanero Hot Sauce (okay, and a little Dave's Insanity), which bumped up the heat up a notch. With these additions, the sauce was more complimentary to the rub flavors, which I wouldn't change a bit. BTW, be sure you remove the membrane from the back of the ribs, and slow cooking them, as others recommended, before BBQing is the secret. Next time, we'll serve these ribs alongside some nice fava beans and a robust chianti.

Rating: 3
Everyone loved these but I made the mistake of putting a fresh poblamo chile in and not blackening it first which gave the sauce a "twang" taste that probably only I noticed. I used Jack Daniels. What bourbon are others using? I baked them in a slow oven and they were beyond tender.

Made these for a large party, and they were devoured. Sauce is easy, but took a while to pull together. Cut the cumin down to 3/4 of a tablespoon in the rub, and added none in the sauce.

Soooooo Good! I'm not a big fan of barbecue sauce but i really thought this sauce was great. The only thing i would change is to reduce the sugar a bit (i hadn't read the reviews before making). I halved the recipie with no problem for two of us. Still we downed about 2 pounds of ribs they were so great! I've adopted this as the official rib recipie - can't wait to make it for others.

I didn't *love* these ribs, but they were good and I think they have potential...I cooked them for about 2-1/2 hours in the oven before finishing on BBQ, and they were falling off the bone--great texture. Rub, though, had too much cinnamon IMO (and I cut the amount down slightly as it was)--I also cut the cardamom to 1 t. and I'm glad I did. Used 1 C. plus a spoonful or two of brown sugar and would stick to 1 C. next time. Sauce was too heavy on tomato; next time I'd follow another reviewer's suggestion and cut the tomato paste. I pureed the sauce to make it smooth, reserving the ancho chili pieces to make a "spicy" version of the sauce (all the peppers pureed with about 1/3 of the sauce). The spicy sauce was definitely better than the regular version. Let's just say I'm still open to finding the ultimate rib recipe.

I realized I lost this recipe in preparing my menu for this 4th of July and was so relieved to find it here on Epicurious. I've never read anyone elses reviews of these ribs, and I found it interesting so many people like us have made it their definitive rib recipe since it was first printed. We love it. Our guests love it - on the west coast and now the east. The sauce can be prepared ahead. The men enjoy cooking it. Extremely flavorful. It's the best all around.

This is a wonderful recipe for ribs. It has now become my official rib recipe also. I took the advice of many other reviewers and reduced the sugar by half and cooked the ribs in a 240 degree oven for about 3 hours. I final cooked them on a grill/smoker. In the sauce I added a couple of dried Arbol dried chili pods and increased the cayenne pepper by half. The heat on the ribs was perfect.

I too made this recipe when it first appeared. During a dinner party for 8, the guest of honor stopped all conversation part-way through to say "These are the best ribs I've ever had". I have made them a number of times since and have had great results each time.

WOW! I'm impressed. This recipe wasn't difficult to produce, but it sure has a professional air. If one would care to go a little hotter it most certainly can bre done. This dish will be used quite a bit this summer.

Very interesting sauce. I should have taken others advice and used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar; it was a bit sweet. The bourbon almost knocked me over while the sauce was cooking...I'd reduce the bourbon by 1/2 cup next time. It was still very good, although I'll try the sauce again with these changes. I'll use this recipe from now on.

I made this recipe when it first appeared in Bon Appetit in the summer of '98. It is unquestionably the best barbecue I have ever come across. I prepared it for a family reunion with many older southern black gentlemen that really knew their barbecue and it was a big hit. It takes a long time to prepare but if the directions are followed exactly it always turns out well.

I agree with the other reviewer....loved the sauce, but will use a bit less rub next time around - it overpowered the ribs a bit. Otherwise, rave reviews from my guests!

The sauce was everything the others said it was. I think you need to go easy on the amount of rub you use. I used half the brown sugar and thought there was enough sweetness to balance the other ingrediants in the sauce.

This is the best BBQ sauce I've come across. More recent Bon Appetit recipes for BBQ sauces are more simple and faster to make. The time to make this sauce is well worth it. I make a triple batch and freeze it in small portions so I always have some. Once you've eaten this sauce, no other can compare.

Simply the best BQ sauce ever. One of my friends is a former chef and even he had to admit that my sauce was fantastic. I make large batches and freeze, it works fine. The dry rub is excellent also and can be used on a variety of meats. Make sure to grill on very LOW heat so rub will not caramelize.

Absolutely delicious with and without the sauce. My sister had a 'rib-fest' for Labor Day this year, and these were by far the best. Even my mother loved them. I left out the chile, and since we had some very picky eaters, I grilled 1/2 with the rub & sauce and 1/2 with just the rub. They were equally delicious.

Rating: 3
Made this recipe for a Labor Day picnic. Everyone loved it. I baked the ribs wrapped in foil in the oven for an hour and 20 minutes and then let them marinate in some of the sauce. Then only had to grill them long enough to pick up the flavor. Like others, I decreased the sugar by half and it was still plenty sweet.

I discovered this recipe when it came out in the summer of '98 and made it at the beach for our family and my husbands birthday. It has become an annual favorite. THE BEST RIBS EVER, however, the sauce is a lot of work so I make it in double and triple batches and freeze, up to a year!!

This recipe is THE BEST! I have been making these ribs since the recipe was first published and get nothing but rave reviews from family and friends.

Also, it has been great fun to read the reviews and find out how many other people love this recipe!

I made these for dinner over the weekend, and when my husband took the first bite, he did the "Richard Dance" around the table. I think he liked them. For the barbeque sauce, I halved the brown sugar and used only 3/4C of the tomato paste. When it was done simmering, I put it in the blender to make it really smooth. I'll definitely be making this again.

A friend of mine and I had been talking about having a "rib off." We were both convinced we made the best ribs. We finally had the contest and it turned out we had the same recipe -- this one! It is foolproof and wonderful. Try Maker's Mark for the bourbon in the sauce.

I didn't have time to do the entire spice rub/ribs combination here, but the sauce sounded so good that I used it to make chicken wings. YUM. They were melt-in-your-mouth good. I added a little more vinegar and Worchestershire than was called for, because I like the kick from them. i can't wait to try the entire recipe

I won a barbecue contest with this sauce, with a few alterations. I put the onions in the food processor with some water and then strained the juice out (about 2 cups) and tossed the pulp. I do this with all my barbecue sauces and I think they are much better for it. I also added some liquid smoke and skipped the tomato paste. I think the tomato paste just weighs the sauce down without adding flavor. I simmered the ribs for about an hour and a half in a mixture of stock and spices. I truly believe this is the only way to get that "falling off the bone" quality. Then I put them in a rub similar to the one above overnight. We finished the ribs over mesquite and brushed them with this sauce about 5 minutes before they were done (any earlier and they char). They ruled, and I've got a trophy to prove it!

Rating: 4
These are "my" ribs, now. Family and friends expect me to make them at least once in the summer, and a dozen times if they're lucky. The sauce freezes quite well, and both the sauce and the rub are great on bone-in chicken pieces with the appropriate adjustments to grill tempurature and cooking time.

Delicious! On instinct, I halved the brown sugar because it just seemed way too much. I'm so glad I did, especially after reading everyone else's reviews.

Rating: 4
I found the sauce better with 1 cup of brown sugar and I had to substitute 1 tesp smoked paprika for the chilli which I couldnt find in New Zealand,I also discovered a great shortcut by rubbing on the spice mix then pressure cooking the racks in a tiny bit of stock for about 15 mins, this made for very tender ribs and the spices really penetrated without having to marinate overnight!

Rating: 4
A wonderful combination of flavors! I disagree that 2C. of brown sugar is too much; I found the sweetness complimented the other flavors very well. I would use twice as much ancho chili though. This recipe is well worth the effort. Next time I will make a large batch so I can easily use it any day of the week.

I have made this recipe many times since it was first published. Most recently we hosted a party for 100+ people from all over the United States (and beyond)and grilled 12 racks of these ribs. They were devoured! Everyone I have served them to has loved them. I also halve the brown sugar and I cook the sauce about twice as long. This is an outstanding stand-by in my kitchen.

My husband and I were not crazy about the rub, which we found to overpower the flavor of the ribs--but the sauce was incredible! We used honey mustard rather than dijon and it was wonderful. Leftover sauce was also great on chicken the next night.

This sauce is divine!!!! I used three ancho chiles instead of one, otherwise no changes. Smoked the baby back ribs for two plus hours using mesquite chips; added sauce towards the end. FANTASTIC!!!!!

Followed other users advice and used 1 cup brown sugar in sauce instead of 2. Also used chipolte chili powder instead of cayenne for rub -- added a smokey flavor. Baked for 2 1/2 hours covered at 250 degrees. Tasted great, fell off the bone. This is now my offical rib recipe!!!

Simply AWESOME ribs!

I know I am offering a redundant evaluation -- but the ribs were FANTASTIC. I usually am more aloof in my grilling -- salmon, game, etc., but thought it would be fun to try ribs, something more traditional. This recipe was definitely worth the cholesterol. It is superb; the flavors in the sauce blend excellently with the rub. I too baked them first for 3-4 hours on a low temp. I did NOT halve the sugar and did not find it too sweet. Babyback ribs deserve a sweet sauce. This sauce is both tangy and sweet. Maybe I would reduce the sugar if I used the sauce on chicken.

Great recipe! We tried it for the 4th of July in New England. We served kids from ages 1-8 years as well as adults everyone thought it was great! As a note, I halved the amount of brown sugar and used Jack Daniels (as that's what is in our house). It was fabulous. Thanks for the recipe (I am a tried and true Gourmet Magazine recipe lover so I was unsure how the recipe would turn out)!

oh my gosh.....This is the most wonderful recipe for ribs. The rub was out of this world. I used it on a brisket that I smoked also. My husband said they were the best ribs he had ever eaten. My daughter, whom doesn't like ribs ate them like they were her favorite food. I did not use the cardomon in the rub due to the fact it was $10.00 for a small bottle. As for the sauce I cut the sugar in half as suggested in other reviews. I placed the ribs in a 250 degree oven first for two hours, then put them on the grill for about 10 minutes per side. This was an awesome holiday treat!! I'll make it again!!

I thought the spice rub and ribs were fantastic, and I have decided to save this recipe for my list of "must-haves" for summer. But, I agree that the sauce was far too sweet. After having tried it once, we have since skipped it altogether. The ribs are great on their own!

I've made this recipe many times since it was originally published. I like to toast whole seed cumin, mustard seed and cardamon in a dry skillet till brown and then grind them. It adds a wonderful smokey flavor to the spice rub. I also pre-bake the ribs at 250 for several hours for tenderness.

This is the absolute BEST sauce recipe ever! I've been using it since it was first published and each time I serve it, I'm asked for the recipe.

I use Jack Daniels in mine since I'm living in the south.

I guess I was expecting out of this world ribs. They were good, but not the ultimate. We like sweet sauces, but using 2 cups of sugar would have been too much. Start with 1 cup and then taste as the sauce is boiling down. You'll be thankful you did. Prebaked them 3 hrs at 250 degrees (company was late) and they fell off the bone.

The Sauce was great! I received lots of compliments on it. The rub however, I thought was overpowering. Too much cumin, and cardamom. Next time I would use a different rub.

I slow cook these in a Brinkman smoker for about 6 hours and then finish them off on the grill.

great recipe!! be sure to evenly spread your rub so you don't get too much in one spot otherwise you will taste more rub than rib in your biteful!! Also, I, too, couldn't find an ancho chili so i bought a poblano pepper and dried at 225 degrees(on the bottom rack) for about four hours and presto your own ancho chili!!!

A huge hit! Because of another review I cut the sugar in half and it was plenty sweet. Also used pepper flakes since I forgot to get the pepper -- they worked fine. I was going to cut the quantity of sauce but am glad I didn't -- there was very little left over.

We baked the rubbed ribs in the oven for two hours at 250 degrees before grilling. Couldn't get the gas flame low enough, so we turned off one side of the grill, and placed the ribs on the upper rack on the OTHER side. The indirect heat worked beautifully, and after 20 minutes of slathering and grilling with the sauce, they were plenty tender. Halved the brown sugar, doubled the ancho chiles, and left out the cardamom because I couldn't find it. My only thought was to cut back on the cayenne a bit next time, but my husband's passionate response through a full mouth was, "Mmph, NO, mmmph,...perfectmmmmph...". So, there you have it. He did pay dearly with screaming heartburn, but that's what antacids are for. Delicious!

I feel so odd giving this recipe 2 forks when everyone else raved about it. Maybe I have strange tastebuds! After drooling over this recipe for 2 weeks, I finally made it for Memorial Day and was disappointed with the results, given all the accolades it had received. I thought it was MUCH too sweet, and the cumin flavor was overpowering. The combination of flavors and spices just wasn't "it" for me or my family. I'm glad everyone else liked this recipe, but I'll keep searching for the perfect ribs recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe. I've now made it several times (as has my father and my sister). I doubled it for my husband's family reunion and I can make it for just two. I only use half of the rub when I make it for 2 and just store the leftover rub in a container.(obviously seperate before you start rubbing) The sauce also freezes well. What could be better when cooking for only 2?

The food has not finished cooking, but the rub smells incredible and the sauce is just about done. I have never seen such a highly rated recipe on this site and my results so far are worth the effort. I question the water in the sauce: i make a sweet/sour sauce that is very similar where I heat the sauce til boiling and then cool. This recipe says to add water and then to simmer it out over the course of an hour. Is there a difference in flavor with these two methods? I can't wait to light up the BBQ tomorrow and get the ribs cooked.

Believe all the accolades! The spice rub and the sauce are terrific. I cooked one rack in the oven for 3.5 hours (a little too long I think) and then barbequed on the Weber for 10 minutes. They came out a bit crispy but still scrumptious. Big eaters will want more than half a rack each!

It seems that I have been looking for the "perfect bbq ribs" all of my adult life. I can honestly say, i have finally found it! I used 2 cups of apple juice instead of adding burbon and instead of dijon mustard, used a good honey mustard. I think next time I will cut the cumin in the rub to half and none in the sauce. The only other change I made was I used only half of an ancho chili. I'm ready to open up my own rib shack!

Just had to add my 2 cents: These are the absolute best ribs I've ever tasted. I've made them three times this summer and every time I make them, the crowd at my house gets larger. I did cut back on the cumin in the rub and I always double the recipe. I extended the cooking time to 6 hours on the grill at 225 degrees - the meat fell off the bones. You won't be disappointed!

Incredible! I needed to cook the ribs that night for dinner so I only let them chill for 3 hours but they were still great! I loved the cinnamon. If I would go a little easier on anything it would be the cumin. I did not pre-boil and the ribs couldn't have been tenderer! Great flavors!

Once you make these ribs you'll never grill a boring hot dog again! The rub is an easy way to prep the meat and you don't have to worry about spilling a big rack of ribs and marinade in the fridge. The sauce was spectacular and there was a ton left over for, yes, burgers the next day. The trick to cooking these ribs is to have the flame as low as possible. I cooked them mostly with the rib side down. Then you can scrape away any charring, flip for the last few minutes and you're done. Don't bother with making individual ribs, just grill in racks of 4-5 ribs and be done with it.

Bravo! Outstanding Rib Recipe. The sauce is really 'to die for'. I found the Ancho Chili's in the produce area in the dried pepper packages with the clear plastic packaging.

This recipe takes time and effort, but it truly is worth it all in the end.
