Soooooooooo easy and sooooooooo elegant; presentation is excellent as the plums looked like red jewels on the sorbet. I made it for a party of 20 people - everyone loved it so much there was no conversation as they ate - just satisfied smiles. Also made one serving with artificial sweetener for a diabetic - still great!

I like this topped with Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup. Those of you who search for a lemon sorbet recipe on Epicurious will understand why.

Delicious and refreshing! Make certain your plums are fairly ripe so they will absorb the marinade better. Made this to complete a meal of Grilled Steak and Asparagus with Hoisin Vinaigrette (this site), cheesy garlic bread, and sliced fresh tomatoes with basil chiffonade. A great meal that my friend who was visiting from out of state loved! I will definitely make this EASY recipe again and again! KIMBER
