This got rave reviews from even the pickiest eaters. I didn't have coriander so I substituted cayenne pepper and cumin and it was still wonderful! Also made my own garden fresh salsa to go on top. Make this with the Tequila Shrimp recipe and spoon shrimp mixture on top. I also had corn tortillas on the side for sopping up the sauce.

I made these exactly as the recipe said, and they turned out well. The only time consuming part is the chopping and cutting, the actual cooking time is minimal. I put some sauce from the Tequila Shrimp recipe on them, and a little salsa also.

These were scrumptious! I took a very large red bell pepper, threw it in the processor with half a red onion. Sauteed it in the butter, then tossed it in with everything else. Used a ton of cilantro and the kids came over and tried to eat it before I cooked it! Unfried this would be great as a dip. Threw on a bit of green chile salsa and loved it.

These were good and my 4.5 y.o. + my 2.5 y.o both ate them. I found the smaller I made the cakes the better they held together. I served them with the tequila shrimp recipe (as suggested by an epicurious menu) and it was pretty much amazing. The creamy sauce tasted great over the bb cakes.

I put a jalapeno and plenty of garlic in the mix, based on other reviews ... it was still bland! It was saved by a spicy poblano/cilantro pesto topping.

I love this recipe on paper, but it wasn't as flavorful as it looked or smelled. It was dry, so salsa and sour cream are a must.

This is an easy and excellent vegetarian main dish. I've made the cakes dozens of times and they are always great. You can top with any kind of salsa or hot sauce. I've also made them bite size, as an appetizer.

These were not bad, but I much prefer the "Spicy Black Bean Cake" recipe on this site. I agree with the reviewer that red bell pepper beats green and that sour cream is a must.

The bean cakes are fabulous, but there doesn't seem to be a link to the accompanying salsa recipe. Perhaps it's a temporary computer glitch, but if anyone has the recipe, I'd love to get it!

These were very tasty, had such a great texture and really held together. As a vegetarian, I'm always on the look-out for a good pattie and I'll definitely make this one again. The flavor of the green pepper really comes through and the cornmeal crust gives them a wonderful crispness on the outside. I served them with the cheese enchiladas w/green sauce also on this site. It was a very rich and flavorful comination.

i really enjoy trying new vegetarian dishes even though i do eat meat regularly. even my teenage son liked it, and he usually greatly dislikes my vegetarian attempts. (his famous statement: "i'm getting sick of these no-meat meals")

I really enjoyed this one, it definately needed some sort of relish or sour cream with it. I'll be cooking it again.

These are good. I've added fresh corn and a little chipotle pepper, and substituted red bell pepper for the green pepper. I like to use sour cream, plain or chipotle flavored, for the accompaniment.

My family and I loved this recipe! Absolutely delicious and the salsa recommended with it was fantastic! I went ahead and doubled the recipe and it made plenty. As I am writing this, my 21 year old daughter just walked throught the room saying "oh, that was sooooo good"...she had been eating leftovers!

Both my carnivorous partner and his vegetarian daughter liked this dish
