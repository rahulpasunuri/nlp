Made this last night. We loved it. Followed the directions exactly except that after it was in the freezer I stirred it around about every hour or so. This made it slushy and easy to scoop out.

Easy to make and refreshing on a summer night. I added a shot of raspberry liquor for a little extra flavor.

This was a bit of a disappointment especially after reading the other reviews. We liked it okay, but not enough to make it again. A bit too sweet and the texture didn't do much for us. Using a grapefruit spoon to scrape the ice was a great suggestion - otherwise it would have been hard to serve.

Question: Is it 3 pounds of watermelon with or without the rind?

This is a wonderfully refreshing recipe! It has a very good taste, exactly like fresh watermelon! I think it would be an excellent way to store away some of your extra produce. A tip I discovered: If you use a grapefruit spoon to scrape the ice, the little ridges on the spoon makes it easier to serve the ice :)

I made this recipe for a 4th of July party along with Banana Ice Cream. Both were very simple to make and can be made ahead. The flavors were amazing and the beautiful colors perfect for a summer celebration.

I happened to have an excellent cantaloupe sitting in my refridgerator, and decided to take a chance on it in this recipe (it seemed like a strange idea to me at first.) It turned out so light, yet rich, and delicious! And this is a very simple, easy, and quick dessert. The freezing is the only thing that takes time. And the stirring during the first stages of freezing is definitely assists the texture of the ice. I was just about beside myself! I intend to use a mixture of honeydew and watermelon in my next ice to wow my mother. ;D
