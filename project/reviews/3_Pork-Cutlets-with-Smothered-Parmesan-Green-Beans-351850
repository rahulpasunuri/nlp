This recipe is not difficult to make and the outcome is very good, I will make it again but next time I will have to make a little larger amount everyone was looking for more. I did not have any green beans so I substituted spinach and it was a hit.

This was a lovely dish. I had scarlet runner beans out in the garden so I used them and the result was very nice. I used skim milk and low fat sour cream mixed instead of the heavy cream...worked out well.

I love this recipe! It was quick and very easy for a week night dinner. I didn't have sage so I used a lemon pepper and some Mrs. Dash. The cutlets were tender and everyone wanted more! I will definitely make this again and again. Very, very tasty....yum!

Excellent! (made some changes, see below) Had to review ASAP because the whole family loved it so much. My son tolerates veggies but doesn't love them and he went back for thirds. We don't especially care for green beans and I forgot I even had them in the freezer until I found this recipe while searching for a recipe to use the pork cutlets and fresh sage I had. Fortunately I also had the fresh parmesan which makes the dish, so don't skip it! Here are the changes I made, mostly due to what I had available: - Used NO water. - Used a splash of heavy cream and the rest half-n-half. - Added some sliced white button mushrooms with the onion sautee. - Subbed 1/2 white onion for the shallots. - Used beef broth instead of white wine. Even after simmering the green beans in the broth and cream, I was worried it was too thin and there wasn't enough flavor, but once I added the parmesan it was right on. This recipe is a great base and you can use red or white wine or any flavor broth, change up the herbs and cheese - whatever. Thanks for the reviews about the original recipe being watery, I sure didn't miss the water in my version :)

Made this with bacon fat instead of butter. Used extra sage and garlic and fresh green beans. Very good!

I just prepared the bean recipe, not the pork chops in this recipe. I suggest using a high-quality frozen bean brand...such as Green Giant. They just taste better. I'm not sure why there was the addition of water into the beans before you simmer for 25 minutes. The frozen beans have a high content of water/ice that is released during the simmering. The water seemed to make the cream more loose that it needed to be and robbed this dish of much-needed flavor. However, this would be a great recipe to spice up a green bean casserole for a holiday meal or large family gathering. I agree with the previous post that there is too much butter and oil used to saute the shallots and garlic.

Flavor ok. The pork was tough -- maybe cook's fault? Not very attractive dish.

This recipe is awful. I decided to try it to see if frozen green beans were ever worth cooking. They are not. In addition to the soggy,pale beans, the pork was tough as nails. The recipe should have suggested pounding it out to 1/4 inch pieces. The combination of shallots, garlic, fresh green beans, wine, cream and sage might very well be a good one. Can't tell from this recipe.

The pork was fine, not overcooked or dry, but there was too much liquid with the smothered beans. Not sure I'd try it again.

This was really delicious and easy to make. I only cooked the green beans for a few minutes though- not 25 as suggested. Served it with the Panfried Smashed Potatoes.

This recipe was extremely easy and fast. I will definitely cut down on the oil or butter because it was a little too greasy for me.

This was surprisingly easy and delicious. I don't think I'd ever had frozen green beans before, and they worked really well in this dish. We used a 16 ounce package instead of 2 10-oz packages (was much cheaper that way for some reason) and it didn't feel short on beans at all. It made leftovers that reheated very nicely for lunch the next day. Would definitely make this again.
