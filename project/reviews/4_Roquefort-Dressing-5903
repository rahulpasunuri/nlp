Terrific! Served this (sans capers) as the dressing for Peyton's Potato Salad at our Super Bowl XLIV party, everyone loved it! Way to Geaux New Orleans Saints! B.J. Harrick

The best roquefort dressing ever! I added a little red wine vinegar and some buttermilk to thin it out and served it with a wedge of iceberg, toasted walnuts,a few cherry tomatoes and some crispy bacon.

We loved it! Our only tip would be to thin with a little buttermilk if it's too thick for your preference.

This recipe is a standard one for me now. I make it all the time. I vary the spice to change it a little - hotter or more mild. I like to serve it with Romaine, walnuts and hard boiled eggs. It also freezes very well.

I love this recipe. I've made it several times already. My only addition is that I add white pepper along with cracked black pepper and salt, to taste. I recently blended this dressing into cole slaw, instead of my usual mayonaise-based dressing, and it was fabulous. If you like blue cheese dressing, you'll LOVE this recipe!

I would recommend substituting minced shallots for garlic powder, while garlic powder can over-power the subtle after tastes of cheeses. Also, the addition of 1 tablespoon quality bourbon greatly enhances the fullnes of the chees.
