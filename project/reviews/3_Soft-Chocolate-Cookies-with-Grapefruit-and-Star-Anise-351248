Made this with peel of 2 navel oranges, otherwise as written. I could defenitely tast the anise and orange. I had to bake 12 minutes, and they were still nice and soft. As I am a real chocoholic I probably won't make these again for myself, but my friends really liked them. If you like this combination, try the 12/08 recipe for grapefruit/blood oange salad with a simple syrup that has had the star anise steeped in it for 30 min. So easy and delicious.

These came out soft and deeply chocolatey. If you don't like star anise, don't make them - the flavor is quite prominent, but very tasty! I didn't have a grapefruit, but I did have a lemon, an orange, and a lime. I used the entire zest of each, and the citrus flavor was complex and just present enough to notice, but not overwhelm. Lovely little cookies overall!

Nice texture on the cookies but the taste was not my favorite, nor my husbands, nor the office staff. Think I'll omit the star anise and use candied ginger or orange zest instead.

I was disappointed with these cookies. Sounded so different but they were pretty mediocre.

These were horrible. Followed the recipe and they looked perfect. But they tasted awful. And my kitchen smelled like star anise for days. I was very disappointed.

When I made these cookies I doubled the amount of grapefruit peel but I still did not get enough grapefruit flavor. I also used only 2 1/2 anise. My husband loved them but they looked plain. I added a dollop of chocolate sauce and a dried cherry to dress them up. I am curious to see what other variations readers come up with. To sum it up: Great flavor but they look too plain for a party.

I love the unique flavour of these cookies. The texture is soft and a little crumbly. Be sure the star anise is completely powdered otherwise you run into hard bits when eating. Also, the Grapefruit flavour wasn't apparent enough, maybe add a little reduced juice from the grapefruit?
