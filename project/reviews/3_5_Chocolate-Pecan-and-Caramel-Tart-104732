Loved this. Used chopped pecans in the tart as suggested by another review. It looked beautiful and my guests were raving about it. Very rich and sweet.

I have been making this for years and won a first place prize out of 30 desserts one year. CHANGES I MADE: Use salted butter for all butter called for-otherwise it is too sweet. Also used 4 oz of bittersweet instead of 2 oz spread on crust. Use chopped toasted pecans on crust or it is too hard to cut. Added an 1/8 teaspoon salt to the cream before it went into the caramel mixture. You won't think this is too sweet if you make these changes. A little salt brings out the flavors...

WAY too sweet for any normal human being(although some people did like it).

Since this was a birthday "cake", I wanted it to look great. I followed the recipe exactly, but then on top of the milk chocolate, I swirled some melted dark chocolate (pour into a plastic baggie and cut off a corner). Quickly took a toothpick and dargged it from the center outwards to the crust. Did that evenly to create a nice pattern. The end result turned the ordinary tart into looking like it came from a professional baker.

this is gooooood! it is small but then again who can eat 5 chocolate/pecan bars at one sitting. Make sure to make caramel on low heat and get it good and dark, otherwise the tart will be really gooooey

to cook in Rio from a cook in Rio too (Lagoa) try using biscoito maizena or maria, its not iedntical but as close as I think you will find

To the cook in Rio, you can try using McVities Digestive biscuits. The taste and texture are not EXACTLY the same but it makes a very good substitute for graham crackers. Hope this helps.

I would like to make this recipe, but I live in Brazil and Graham Crackers aren't available here. Does anyone have any suggestions for another type of crust that might work with this? Thanks!!

This was outstanding! I actually used 9 graham crackers and 5 tbsp ROOM TEMP butter and greased my pan, followed by the amount of sugar called for. I found this was an excellent recipe for the crust and it came out beautifully, no breaking or cracking. I used 3.5 oz each for both layers - dark chocolate - and warmed up the caramel to 220 degrees. This was a perfect combination! No spilling over, just the right consistency to the caramel. Everyone loved it and went back for seconds. Beware though, as this is sinfully rich and very intense in flavor. I served this up with vanilla bean ice cream - what a hit!

Definitely a keeper - delicious - loved by all. The only thing was, apparently I am caramel-challenged, because I tried to make the caramel sauce, not once but twice. Both times, I ended up with something soupy, buttery and sweet that bore no resemblance to caramel. I ended up at the supermarket buying a jar of caramel sauce. Oh well. It worked fine. I got a lot of compliments actually.

This tart was so delicious and so simple to make. Overall preparation was pretty quick and received rave reviews from it. I did add 1/4 cup of strong brewed coffee in the melted semi-sweet chocolate to give it an extra depth. Will definitely make again.

I originally made this for Christmas Day and it was such a hit, that I made it again for New Years Day. The second time, I used a square pan, to cut the bar into squares. It was much easier to handle.

This was fabulous! I used 4 oz. bittersweet and melted it with 1/4 cup cream. I think this made it easier to cut--cutting through solid chilled chocolate is not easy! I cooked the caramel to 220 and that was perfect. Also, if you heat up the cream and butter before adding to the caramalized sugar, it's easier and quicker. I also added 2 T. cocoa to the graham cracker crust because you can never have too much chocolate! Next time I will coarsely chop the pecans that go on the bottom. The ones I used were quite large and that also made it diffuclt to cut. This went quickly at a party with lots of desserts!

I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and made the following changes, with great success: used 6 ounces of bittersweet chocolate (liked Scharffen Berger) over the crust; used 1 1/4 cups whipping cream and 8 ounces milk chocolate (loved Valrhona's 61% cocoa variety, did not like Callebaut) in the ganache; used 3/4 cup sugar and a pinch of salt in the caramel; heated the caramel to almost 270 on a candy thermometer.

I didn't cook the caramel long enough, but it was still WAY good-my family fought over the last piece! I will definately be making this again!

My caramel was also a bit soft, but my biggest problem was the crust. It absolutely was a nightmare to cut. I thought there might be too much butter in the crust. Might cut back there and see if it helps. But I'll definitely make it again.

The final product was great but it needed to be reworked a little to give the result of a candy bar. I took the advice of others and doubled the first chocolate layer. It was the correct amount. Thanks for the tip! Others have mentioned that the caramel was too soft. After adding the cream and butter, I stuck in a candy thermometer. If I would have taken it off when the recipe suggested, It was barely at 170 and would have been way too soft. I continued cooking until 220 degrees and it set up wonderfully in the fridge. 220 seemed to be the magic number for me. Great result. Chocoholics loved it!

Yum! Like others, I increased the amount of chocolate. With the caramel I had the opposite problem as the reviewer below - for some reason my caramel layer was hard. Maybe I cooked it too long? It tasted great, though!

Made this for a dinner party and not a scrap was left over. I gave out 5 copies of the recipe the next day!

This is a good tart - divinely rich and just like eating a chocolate bar (albeit a very special one!). I must however, reiterate what previous reviewers have mentioned: 1.Double or even triple the amount of chocolate in the first chocolate layer. I only made half a recipe and my 4 ozs. of chocolate almost wasn't enough. 2.Making caramel is a tricky business, even though I followed the recipe to a T and watched my caramel like a hawk, it didn't solidify. It oozed out as soon as it was cut. I'm thinking of using a candy thermometer next time or just using another caramel recipe.

I thought this was delicious. I, too, used 4 ounces of the bittersweet chocolate- I can't imagine that 2 ounces is enough! Thanks for the suggestion. I found the caramel to be a bit labor intensive, but given the end result, it was worth it. I had to cook it twice to get it right. I would suggest cooking it a bit more slowly than the recipe says just so it doesn't burn.

far too rich for our taste. If you love candy bars, snickers, turtles, etc. and would like a dessert that really is one large candy bar, this is the dessert for you.

Turtle lovers in my family raved. Gramma said it was the first graham cracker crust she ever liked. It came out of the tart pan like a dream.

The tast was wonderful. I am a "seasoned" baker but found that the crust was too hard and came off the sides when I unmolded it. But worse, the caramel layer did not solidify and ooozed out!!! Did anyone else experience this? Maybe I did not cook the caramel long enough?

Wonderful recipe. Worth the calories! Based on other reviewers comments, I doubled the bittersweet chocolate layer and was very pleased. The crust was a tiny bit grainy - I think next time I'll try superfine sugar.

A chocolate lover's recipe. I forgot to bake the crust and came out just fine... i would make it again for sure!

Addictive and fabulous. Similar in concept to a $$$$ dessert I ordered from Williams Sonoma for the holidays. As for the taste and resulting creation, this recipe was so far superior that the two were not in the same league. I used graham cracker crumbs, and that made it slightly easier.

This was an excellent tart and I made it for my sister who is hard to please when it comes to sweets. I doubled the chocolate-if you like chocolate double it and you won't be sorry.

To die from......I made this for a small dinner party and everyone wanted seconds. It is easy to make and relatively fool proof. I tripled the amount of bittersweet chocolate because the first chocolate layer seemed too thin.
