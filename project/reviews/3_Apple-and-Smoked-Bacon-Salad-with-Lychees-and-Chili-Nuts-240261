Delicious Mix. Bacon fat pulled everything together.

OK, I couldn't wait to try this. The lychees are bad. I bought canned lychees in syrup (the only ones available) from Whole Foods. They were gelatinous, overly chemically sweet, and ruined the salad. The peanuts, as prepared, tasted good, but the smell of them roasting in the fish oil and spices was disgusting and when I woke up at 4:00 a.m. and smelled the lingering odors, it was even worse. I actually fried potato slices in the bacon fat and added them to the salad to make it more of a side dish - it was the only good thing about it. Better lychees? I don't know - I won't try it again.

Loved this salad- didn't have a chance to get the lychees, so I went without. But it was still a great mix that tasted great together, I think the secret is using fresh in season apples. Those Chili nuts are addicting on their own, and so simple to make. I'll make this again!!
