Did not have tahini and used black seseme seed in blender with dressing ingredients. Marinated onions for ten minutes and sauted rather than grilled. Added canned canelli beans when tossing. Fabulous.

The vinaigrette went nicely with the spinach and red onions. We only marinated the onions for 30 minutes and they were great. For the vinaigrette, we left out the water, increased the vinegar to 1/3 cup and used 2/3 cup of olive oil.

Who knew that grilled onions could trump grilled tuna steaks? These grilled onions (over coals, please!!) are SHOWSTOPPERS! Amazing. My tuna-loving husband marvelled that he didn't care about the tuna steaks I made to go with this... The spinach salad is delicious. Skip the ridiccio, though, it's rediculously out of place. The texture of baby spinach with this dressing is totally divine. Do serve with tuna steaks, but don't be hurt if the onions are all anyone talks about!

We loved this, added sliced fresh peaches. We served it with a tarragon cream sauce pork tenderloin - very good match.

The vinegrette was exceptional. I substituted orange juice for water and white wine vineger with rice wine vinegar. This recipe is a keeper!

The onions and dressing in this recipe are just excellent--smoky, creamy, nutty, AND tart flavors. I took the recommendation of other reviewers and substituted rice wine vinegar and since we didn't have raddiccio, skipped it. Other than that, I made the salad as described. (If you're broiling, be sure to keep an eye on the onions, I followed the recipe and had to discard a few that were burnt to a crisp). Am looking forward to making this again and will definitely try it with the raddichio next time (the addition of the bitter green taste might just get this recipe that last fork)!

Ok, I just wanted to say how upset I am at the two words I spelled wrong in my review. I know that it should be "too" and finally. My apologies, nursing an infant while typing.

I did not like this dressing. Probably because I love tahini, and the flavor was lost in the vinegar, mustard, water, and oil. The onions were fab and easy, will use them to top a salad, but the dressing was blech. I started out adding only 1/4 of the oil, but it was way to tart, so I added the full amount, then it just tasted like a simple vinagrette. I will stick to my tradional tahini dressing, 1-3 finaly chopped garlic cloves, 1/4 cup lemon juice, 1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup tahini, 1/4 teas cumin, 1/4 teaspoon coriander, sprinkle of hot paprika, 1/4 cup oil, freshly chopped parsley and/or cilantro and salt to taste.

Meh--have to take a pass on this one I'm afraid. Just OK; try the spinach salad with apple, red onion and avocado on this site--now that's a keeper! Sandra McNally Edmonton, Canada/Panama

This was a huge hit at a recent BBQ. We had it with corn on the cob and ribs, it was great because we got to eat our greens without using utensils! On top of the ease of this recipe, the dressing is terrific-creamy, tangy, sweet, yum! I used rice wine vinegar instead and a little less oil-great stuff!

Family loved it! Son however wouldn't eat the raddichio. It would be just as good if you left it out. Also, I only used 1/4 c. of oil. Still delicious.

This is a fantastic salad and dressing! If you reduce the water in the dressing by 1/4 c. and double the honey, it makes an excellent pretzel and veggie dip!

Made this as a first course for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. Didn't have white wine vinegar so I substituted red, and nobody seemed to tell the difference! Will definitely make this again.

only changes were to use champagne vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, and the addition of candied hazelnuts. loved it.

WOW. Even with all the raves, I didn't expect this to be quite as good as it actually is. When I went to the store, they were out of tahini, so I substituted cashew butter, which was delicious. I also went with Vidalias rather than red onions, and I halved a pint of grape tomatoes to give some color and additional texture. I made it for a party and it was practically the first thing to disappear!

I was looking for something different for my bounty of spinach and man oh man did I find what I was looking for! This is an absolutely delicious dressing for fresh spinach. My 4 year old loved it too! Sorry I didn't prepare this w/the recommended salad. This was simply wonderful on my fresh spinach salad. A keeper. I'm thinking this would be a great dipping sauce for chicken sate or something along that line.

ppl were asking for the recipe on this one. the vinaigrette was to die for. i added extra vinegar & apple cider vinegar to it to lend it a little bit of tartness & sweetness. will make again and again.

Great dressing on the spinach! I added eggs as per another's suggestion, and didn't have red onions so I caramelized some white ones in the dressing in the oven. Had 10 people for dinner and everyone LOVED it!

Although I have made more interesting salads this one is still very good. I LOVE what broiling the onions does to the dressing. My only addition was some chopped, toasted pecans.

I really expected to be wowed by this recipe, judging by most of the reviews. Unfortunately, although I followed the recipe exactly, my husband and I found the dressing very bland and dare I say...boring. The creaminess is wonderful, so maybe I will use the recipe as a base and add different herbs and spices or use cider vinegar, as another reviewer did.

Added grilled chicken that had been marinated in the dressing, toasted pecans, cucumber, tomato and kept the red onions raw....zowie! Every bite is magic!

This was WONDERFUL! I'd definitely make it again. I followed the suggestions in reviews, added grilled chicken, broccoli, cucumber, grilled mushrooms & red and yellow bells, and extra dressing. I added more honey, garlic, & mustard to the dressing too and then tossed all mis-ins into dressing before topping spinach off! We served it with a Viogner and expected to have lkeftovers(i doubled it)... but nothing was left! It was an absolute HIT! I'll make this again.~: )

I made the dressing as prescribed. Then grilled chicken breasts I marinated in fish sauce, the onions in the tahini dressing, and some yellow peppers. Tossed them with mixed greens and broccoli florets,grape tomatoes, mushrooms, cucumbers. Toss with more dressing. This was really awesome. Then the ultimate wine pairing-a Ferrari Carano Fume blanc(and any grassy, acidic Sauvignon Blanc would be good) and you have nirvana. I disagree with the cook who used a fork to mix the dressing-the blender whips the necessary air into the sauce to make it like a chantilly sauce-much airier and creamy and to my liking. My husband was in heaven.

This is my favourite recipe at the moment...I make it as per the directions and add grilled chicken, crispy noodles and grated cheese. Really tasty, and the dressing keeps quite well.

Wonderful dish. The onions are the best part!

I was a bit disappointed from all the rave reviews.The dressing had an odd flavour in it.Perhaps it was the coarse-grained mustard - or too much tahini. I still have lots of dressing left and will try serving with noodles as another reviewer did.

This dressing was great! I served it over romaine leaves since my husband doesn't eat spinach. I also chopped the onions after grilling them and mixed them into the salad. Next time I will add some chopped bacon and I think it will be perfect!

This is one easy and excellent salad. It is a delicious summer salad and the dressing is more than enough for other salads. Everyone loved this.

Creamy type dressing without the dairy products (added a bit less water), we especially enjoyed the onions.

This dressing came together very easily with just a whisk; I don't think you'd even need to dirty the blender. I served it tossed with buckwheat noodles (it will coat about 8 cups of noodles) and onions rather than as a salad, and it was fantastic!

Really nice! The flavors are different and very refreshing. The carmelized onion works so well with the spinach. The other reviews of this recipe are on target.

This salad is gorgeous!!!!!!!! it's a nice change from the regular dressings! I only marinated the onions for an hour and it was still fantastic. will be making this again!!!!!

We first made this salad for a middle-Eastern theme dinner (grilled lamb and stuffed tomatoes, yum!) and we've kept some dressing on hand ever since. Only advice: keep an eye on the onions on the grill - they tend to charcoalize quickly because of the sugar in the marinade!

The salad was truly delicious and the tahini vinaigrette was a welcome change from vinaigrette's with different herbs. I did not use the honey to eliminate sugar. We will make this again.

I've made this twice, enjoyed it both times. The second time used apple cider vinegar, which I preferred. It is a beautiful salad. I am going to try it in the winter with some carmelized pecans.

This is great! I used Vidalia onions instead of the red simply because I had them on hand and they grilled up very nicely. I also added 4 oz of pancetta which I sauteed until very crisp and then let it cool before tossing it with the salad. This would go well with alot of different menus. It is a keeper.

This is a great recipe for a BBQ. Skewer the onions before putting them near the grill; they're slipperly little devils. If you leave out the water and garlic, the dressing combines very easily with a whisk (I agree with previous post that the garlic was too much). The dressing also works nicely over a warm asparagus salad.

i must have gotten the proportions wrong, so the first time, it congealed in the blender :( but when it finally did turn out right, it was GREAT! THE BEAN

This was absolutely delicious! Even my 14 year old son loved it. I definately will make it again. The vinaigrette dressing was wonderful and the crunch of the onions adds just the right amout of texture to the spinach. I will probably use the dressing for marinating chicken breasts for the grill. Try it... you will love it!!!

Loved It, Loved It, Loved It!! Normally we don't like any green salads, but this one was delicious. We marinated london broil in the dressing for 5 hours, along with the red onions and grilled both. We also substituted chickory, red leaf lettuce and endive along with the baby spinach.

This recipe was quite delicious. I served it at Thanksgiving and my niece went back to the kitchen to clean up the last bit available. Next time I made it,I used a little less water. It was an excellent luncheon salad entree using some chicken breasts grilled that I also marinated in the vinagrette.

The dressing was absolutely fabulous! I added grilled breasts of chicken for an extra touch...delicious with that tahini dressing...

This vinaigrette is spectucular - one of the best I've ever made or bought. Only use a small amount of garlic though, unless you are a true garlic lover, as it tends to overpower the tahini.
