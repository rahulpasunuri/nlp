This dish got good reviews but IMO for the number of ingredients it is overlying complicated and the final product is underwhelming.

I made this exactly as written, except I used only one jalapeno. My mistake! My family thought the sauce had no heat. Next time I will track down the Thai chiles and I won't hold back, or I'll use two serranos or jalapenos. I really loved the spices, though. I was afraid more heat would overwhelm the delicacy of the shrimp. 1.6 lbs of large shrimp were plenty for four people. I did not halve the sauce. I skewered them (with shells on) to make grilling easier.

Oh my! Also raided my garden for the lemongrass and peppers. Used honey instead of brown sugar (I keep bees) Served it with plain basmati brown rice and grilled veggies, also from my garden. We loved it and the fragrance from my kitchen and patio was a bonus.

So delicious. I made it with homegrown jalapenos and cherry bomb peppers, and served it with coconut rice. The sweet and the hot balance nicely.

I made this with skinned bone in chicken thighs. It turned out great; nice and spicy. Definitely will make again.

Good recipe with good flavors but not the best thing I've made. I followed the recipe, but reduced to 1 lb of shrimp for just my husband and I. I halved the sambal quantity and probably could have done 1/3 to match the shrimp quantity. I added a bit more lemongrass, a squeeze of lime juice and a bit more salt to get the flavor I wanted. I served the shrimp with grilled veggies (zucchini, poblano and orange bell pepper, eggplant) and Caesar salad.

Excellent. Make sure to use red chilies. It makes for a "better looking" sambal.

Excellent! I added more peppers because I love the heat. Otherwise I did everything as specified in the recipe. I served it with basmati rice with pine nuts, this allowed us to eat more of the exquisite Sambal.

A lovely change of pace from our favorite Rosemary Garlic Shrimp (also on this site) - and great way to use up the remaining bunch of lemongrass in my fridge. Only ingredient I was missing was the macadamias - I threw a few peanuts in just to replace the texture. Will definitely do this again for a summer dinner, but would also serve as an appetizer.

This dish has great flavor. I thought I had turmeric in the cabinet but didn't so disappointedly had to leave it out. (I substituted saffron with a pinch of paprika.) The lemongrass I used was very fibrous even after processing and knowing that my spouse would find that detracting from the pleasure of the dish, I opted to strain off all the components. The resulting smooth sauce was amazing and my husband said two or three times how great it was! (But next time I would only strain half for him and save half as chunky for myself!)

did as recipe specified,but omitted nuts.it was exquisite.Make sure to brown the paste a bit before adding too mch water it cools the ginger and chilies down a bit so all of the flavor are released together

This dish turned out wonderful! I chopped the fresh lemongrass prior to the processor. I simmered in a heavy cast iron skillet adding oil when it reached a pasty consistency. I cooked about 10 minutes though called for about 7 mins., then added water and reduced. It's a keeper

I was excited to try this tonight as we love everything that goes into the sambal. I am not sure if I did something wrong - the only thing I can think of is that I didn't use enough lemongrass (I had 3 medium-small sized stalks), or if I didn't cook the sambal long enough before adding water, but I wasn't really crazy about the flavors. Wondering if it needed to just sit for a while to allow the flavors to meld? However, wwhen the shrimp was marinated in the sambal, it was much better. It was more like we could smell the flavors rather than tasting them. We grilled the shrimp over charcoal using the marinade as directed in the recipe and used the rest of the sambal as a dip. Then it was fine, but it still felt like it was missing something. I was hoping someone else has tried this and see if they noticed the same thing or if it was just me. I'd make this again - if I knew what to do a little differently. It just seemed too "sharp." Maybe more brown sugar? Honey? I'm at a loss.

Relatively easy, the sambal was delicious and very aromatic but it was difficult to really know the texture it should have ended up. Used unpeeled shrimp which helped keep the shrimp from drying out on the grill but also kept the marinade from really doing too much; probably no need to actually marinate the shrimp quite so much if using unpeeled shrimp as the sauce does most of the work. I also thought the sauce was a bit heavy on tumeric and the lemongrass didn't really break down well in the food processor so there were inedible hard bits left in the sambal.
