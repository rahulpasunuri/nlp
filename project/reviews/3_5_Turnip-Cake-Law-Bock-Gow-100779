really nice- I too have had the weird bland oil-soggy turnip cake you get at dim sum places, & this is much more the wonderful, flavour-packed kind you get at actual people's homes. my dried shrimp had gotten damp & unusable, but i did everything else the same (with the exception of not using the mushroom water as it makes the cake come out tan instead of white), and it came out beautifully. nothing like a hot crispy slice of turnip cake with breakfast all through Tet!

Inedible, I have had this as dim sum so I knew what to expect. I think it wss the shrimp. I would make this without the shrimp and mushrooms and maybe 1/8 of the bacon. It took a lot of time to make this and clean up took time as well. I took one bite. I was worried about the rice flour being grainy but unlike baked goods, this recipe smoothes it out.

Great recipe! It turned out great. I used Chinese sweet sausage instead of the bacon and I think it adds a better taste to it. Also, instead of using the 1/2 cup of water from the mushrooms, I used regular water since the mushroom water is pretty nasty. I also added 1 tsp of salt into the process. If you are making this for the 1st time, note that you need rice flour and NOT glutinous rice flour.

This took an incredibly long time and the end it really lacked flavor.

It is a very good recipe. You may want to add shallots, Chinese sausages and Chinese 5 spices to make it perfect! Just like the way my mother taught me.

It took me a minute to understand that the "Chinese turnip" called for was a daikon. It would be helpful to use terms like this or link to a picture or Wikipedia entry for unfamiliar items.

I wanted to make this last year, but do to the ease of buying here in Hong Kong, I didn't. But I finally did the other day and it was VERY yummy!!! I think it tasted very authentic....

This recipe is almost identical to the one my mother taught me to make. It's missing a couple crucial ingredients to make it absolutely divine, which I wont share, as then I'd have to kill you all. I will add, however, that thinly sliced scallions and cilantro are perfect additions after it's done cooking, and it's easy to substitute a finely diced chunk of vegetarian ham for the pork & scrimps. You can find it in the freezer section of most asian grocery stores.

I made this last year and I'm making it this year. It was very tasty. I used a combination of fresh shitake mushrooms and dried ones for extra flavor. Even steam some fresh mushrooms and decorated the center of the cake to give as gifts. I also used a combination of sausage and chinese bacon(coming from a meat lover family) and added chopped cilantro and green onions for exra flavor and color. My family members were very impressed and said it was the best cake they ever had.

I used this recipe last year for our Chinese New Year gathering and found it to be very authentic. This was the first year that I made the cake instead of my mom, and she was very pleased with the results. Instead of using bacon, I used chinese sausage, sliced into 0.5cm thick rounds. I have never had this cake with bacon before -just sausage. The "Chinese mushrooms" are shitake. There is a lot of work involved in making this cake, and so I bought the Kitchenaid shredder attachment, which works like a charm. Be sure to squeeze it fairly dry, since this cake was a little on the wet side (or just add less liquid). As another reviewer said, this cake can be "steamed" in any large pot/dutch oven by filling the bottom with water, and resting your cake above the water level on a small stand. I love to serve the first slice fresh, without pan-frying. Leftovers are pan-fried and served with oyster sauce or sweet/hot chili sauce. Also, if you make a large batch and think about freezing, the texture of the cake will change after defrosting. In spite of all the work, give this recipe a try- it is excellent, and those turnip cakes that you might have tried at dim-sum or a restaurant cannot eevn compare.

These turnip cakes are much better than the greasy, bland mush generally found in Chinatown. They're also hard to screw up. Ingredients are readily substitutable/omittable. For example, you can add more rice flour if you want a firmer cake. And I have on different occasion left out the bacon, used Chinese sausage, and even used American bacon. Also, a steamer isn't necessary. You can also put the casserole dish in a pot of boiling water, elevated upon a round metal cookie cutter.

I followed the recipe as is, but used Chinese sausage and added some salt. It was really delicious and authentic, and helped with my homesickness during this Chinese New Year season!

This came out just nice and is very tasty.

You can use both Chinese sausage and bacon...I also find that chunkier pieces taste better. And to the reviewer from China, it can't be that wrong, as I'm from china myself, and my mother makes turnip cake, and it has the exact same ingredients!!!

Very good recipe. I would added 2 tp of salt to this mixture. Also some chopped green onion.

Regarding the reviewer from China: If you're such an expert as to what constitutes a good recipe for this dish, why did you even follow this recipe? The possibilities that we can ascertain from your comment is that you are a) a horrible cook, b) one of those that think they are an A-class cook because they can follow a recipe, or c) a horrible cook that can't follow a recipe and blame the writer.

A good substitute for the bacon is Chinese sausage - just split lengthwise in four, slice into 1/4 inch bits, and add to dough. Wonderful.

This recipe works as many of the recipes in Grace Young's cookbook. I would recommend it to anyone who wants only one Chinese cookbook in their library (this is coming from one who has too many cookbooks in her collection!).

Your recipe is so stupid and wrong. It is a whole lot of wrong combination of ingredients and quantity. I had to throw away the whole dish. It is a disgrace and I hope you take it off the website. If you don't know how to make turnip cake don't show off as you are wasting our money.

Not a bad turnout, but a LOT of work versus just buying pre-made turnip cake from the store. It is worth making once just to impress, but the result is not particularly better tasting than any store-bought version. Finding a steamer that can hold a 8" by 4" is not an easy task either; I ended up using a waterproof spring form pan suspended in a large pot, I would have preferred a square pan but at least the springform made the cake easier to remove. Make sure you stir up the final mixture very well and pat it down so that it is as level as possible. Once you start steaming it, any lumpiness is going to become very apparent. Implicit is that you have to chop up the meat, mushrooms, and shrimp very fine unless you deliberately want it to look "lumpy" and homemade. I also put the turnip through a food processor. I didn't see any salt in the ingredient list, so I just put a few pinches in. I don't think it really needs much since the shrimp adds a small amount of saltiness.

Dear Somerville, please share how you made these vegetarian--did you simply omit the meat or did you add something extra? many thanks, VegChef

I have made a vegetarian version of this recipe many times, much to the delight of my dinner guests. They taste better than the real thing at dim sum in Chinatown! It's definitely worth all of the effort. Very tasty!

You know this must be a good recipe when my turnip cake turned out disastrous and I still give it 4 forks. My mistake? Using Japanese sweet rice flour instead of regular white rice flour (I didn't read the introduction to the recipe) and therefore miss the warning about sweet rice flour). The result was a gooey mess. A very fragrant, YUMMY gooey mess. I was so happy with the taste I ate it for three days straight! I'll definitely make it again, but next time I'll make sure I use the right type of flour.

My parents use to make this when I was a child. I remembered the Sunday mornings my mom would brown these in a frying pan. We woke up to the smell of frying turnip cakes instead of bacon and pancakes. Mom would put in chinese sausage instead of the chinese bacon and she would add a bunch of sliced green onions to the mix.

Perfect: your receipe are very easy to follow. I will not have any trouble using this receipe.
