The ease of this brittle was amazing! The taste ok, I guess you get what you give! Anyway, took the advise of others and used the microwave. I was so excited when at 7 min. it was a beautiful amber color, but when I picked up my microwave safe Tupperware the bottom had melted out!!! I had to use a paint scraper to get it off of the floor and shelves, no fun. DO NOT USE PLASTIC!!!! Round two, I used a glass bowl, and it came out perfect!

I found this very tasty and easy to make. Such a simple recipe! We chopped the nuts and thought that was better than leaving them whole.

Easy, tasty, looks like pic. I made mine with macadamia nuts (chopped lightly) instead. Thin and crisp! Not buttery - but still tasty. Prob best as a garnish, but good alone too.

Loved the idea, but the brittle was not the best. I love the idea of using brittle to decorate a cake (I made this to go with the Pistachio Brittle Cheesecake), and I will do this in the future with other cakes but will keep looking for a great brittle recipe.

I'd like to send a big thank you out to the guy who suggested the microwave... none of this heated sugar and pastry brush nonsense... just 7 minutes in a microwave and no hassle. It was beautiful on my very first try. The only problem is that it has been very sticky and melty but as it has retained its lovely glass-like look, I'm not complaining too heartily, Thanks so much for this great tip!

Following the cooking instructions of the fellow who suggested microwaving and it turned out absolutely perfect. Just microwaved about 10 seconds over the seven minutes he recommended and poured it over the cookie sheet where I'd already spread out the pistachios. A few of the nuts moved around but were easily put back into place again.

Re: granular crystallized caramel: the way to avoid this is to refrain from stirring the sugar once it is dissolved. You can also use more water with the sugar at the beginning; this will make it easier to dissolve the sugar quickly (although it will take longer to caramelize) and the results will be identical (the water is all gone by the time the sugar begins to brown). Don't stir and your caramel will be beautiful.

I didn't find this an easy thing to do at all. Tried it twice on the stove top both of which went back to the granular sugar consistency, and then a third were it was too runny. Then tried the microwave (stubborn as I am) and it was thicker but not a pretty amber color. Any suggestions? Did it by color, did it by time, just can't do it!!!Argh!

Mixed sugar and water in a microwave safe container. Microwave for approx. 7 minutes. Check often and when mixture turns amber pour on buttered cookie sheet. Viola. Slick as a whistle you have the finished product.

This is not your ordinary brittle-- thick, dull, salty, and opaque. It is transparent, golden, and sweet. It is easier to make and not have the sugar seize up on you when you use a white enamel coated pan and continually wash the sides down with a water brush. I would also recommend not stirring the sugar mixture after it has dissolved and you are waiting for it to change color. As a gift, it is beautiful. The transparency and color picks up the light and looks like a piece of art. For young children, however, it can be extremely sharp, as it pours fairly thinly, and I had trouble with it "melting" in an airtight container and on the cheesecakes that I decorated it with.

I would make this recipe again to accomodate the "Pistachio Brittle Cheesecake". It took me two tries to pull it off. I may not have totally dissolved sugar before bringing it to a boil. It took approxmiately 7-8 minutes the second attempt. I also used a white enamel pan the first time which made it difficult to tell when it became an amber color.
