This recipe is huge! It's definitely twice as much as will fit in my ice cream maker. The apricot flavor in this is intense! I love apricots, but I might tone it down a little next time. Like so many others on epicurious, I failed to make this exactly according to the recipe. I omitted the gelatin, and I ran out of (greek-style) yogurt so I added some milk and cream until I got to 3.5 cups. The mixture ended up being very thick! If you want to omit the gelatin for dietary reasons, using some Greek yogurt would probably work as a substitute thickener.
