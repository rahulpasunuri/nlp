"using finger, blend in butter"?? I can think of something longer and as firm and flexible to use to blend in the butter. A Rubbermaid spatula.

Kudos to " A cook from Mass." from 3/10/10. Those changes made me change my rating to 4 forks. Also, I used instant coffee because that's all I had on hand. Used the powerdered sugar to roll in and even added some Christmas color of red sprinkles. I used a scant teaspoonful for each cookie and came out with 35. Since they were small, I baked them for exactly 8 min and they were perfect.

The cookies were good but not fabulous. I made mine small but still did not make 30 cookies. I would make them again though.

Rating: 4
extremely simple, but very good cookies. they turn out small, but you really don't need a lot of these to feel satisfied, though I was only able to get 20 cookies out of one batch as opposed to the 30 the recipe said. Also I rolled my cookies in granuated sugar instead of confectioner's to give them a little extra crunch.

Rating: 4
Wow! This was as delicious as it was easy. I made a triple batch for a cookie exchange, and they were beautiful. I made them gluten and dairy free by using Bob's Red Mill GF flour blend +1/2t. xanthan gum, and Earth Balance spread instead of butter.

I made this twice. First time I made as written and would give it two stars--easy, but there was a certain lack of depth. The second time I made the following changes: combined flour, sugar, cocoa (used natural cocoa, so I added a pinch of baking soda), baking powder, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon instant espresso in a food processor and whizzed to blend. Cut 3 tablespoons butter (upped from 2 T) into pieces, put that in the food processor too until well dispersed. Then I melted 2 tablespoons of Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips and tossed that into the food processor along with the egg and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla. Whizzed until dough formed into a ball, formed teaspoonfuls into tiny balls, did not roll in sugar, baked on parchment for 8 minutes. Wow, wow, and wow! Much better and deeper flavor, moist, chewy. And it took me fifteen minutes, start to end. With these modifications, I will make over and over again.

Very easy to make, though I was doubtful at first (especially the part where you're supposed to mix the butter in with your "fingers"). Rolled them as directed teaspoon size for exactly 24 cookies. 9 mins made the edges a little to hard, will cut down to 8 mins for such tiny cookies next time.

I just made a DOUBLE batch of these cookies in literally 20 min...the second pan is still in the oven! I followed the recipe (doubled) and added about a 1/2 c of mini choc chips. They are so good, super easy and really pretty. I used a mini ice cream scoop, rolled and dumped in a bowl with icicng sugar...really great tasting cookies

these cookies turned out perfectly. i was looking for a recipe in which i could bake soft, dark chocolate cookies and this recipe certainly met my requests. I would however agree with many of the other reviews on the limited quantity of cookies it produces. I made a double batch and got around 24 medium sized cookies. This was a very easy quick recipe that i look forward to using again.

This is a good, easy recipe that I have been making for years. Definitely follow the advice of other reviewers and add mini chocolate chips ( 1/2 cup to a doubled recipe) to the batter. It makes a big difference and adds that extra chocolate intensity!

I made these tonight because my dh was in the mood for some cookies. They were very VERY easy to make and he really liked them. I thought they were so so. but decent, esp. nice that it's ingredients that you just have in the house.

Rating: 4
Great, simple recipe - I've made multiple times with the help of my 2 year old - but doesn't always provide the chocolate fix I needed... In that case, I've reduced granulated sugar to 1/3 cup, then added 1/4 cup of miniature chocolate chips after a few minutes in the freezer. Yum!

Rating: 4
Easier method: Double recipe. Add softened butter to dry stuff in a stand mixer and blend with paddle. Use the smallest cookie scoop you've got, scoop out and dump the dough balls into a bowl of powdered sugar. Roll around well and bake. This is an easy cookie to make and my kids love it!

I make these with whole wheat flour. Very quick and easy chocolate fix. They are best warm.

My children and I made these cookies. We enjoyed them. I got about 19 cookies out of it. I could have got more but they would have been too small. We ate them all. I thought they were something good for a chocolate craving and I didn't think it was too much work at all.

Rating: 3
Quick, easy and delicious. These beautiful little cookies would be a great accompaniment for ice cream or sorbet....recipe makes about a dozen two inch cookies.

Rating: 3
So easy, perfect for cooking with small children. the balls need to be rolled quiet small (less than 3/4inch) to get even close to the quantity suggested, and cook in less than 10 mins.

Rating: 3
I don't really like these cookies but my friends love them. They're always asking me to make them. I actually get a lot of cookies from this recipe, I just make them very tiny =P I like small things and having the cookies bite-size is nice. I dump my balls into a bowl of powdered sugar before rolling them and then dusting them again, I find this a lot less messy.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe. When I first moved to Spain, it got me through many a chocolate craving. It's fast, easy and chocolaty but it makes few cookies. That's probably a good thing since we tend to eat them straight out of the oven.

Rating: 3
These are exactly the cookies I was looking for! Perfect for that chocolate craving. Sifting together the dry ingredients (minus the granulated sugar) made the butter-incorporation step easier, and sifting the powdered sugar helped get an even coating on the cookies. It takes a few more minutes, but I think these gems are worth it.

this recipe is good but extremely small. as it was i got 9 cookies, so doubling or tripling would be good. i also had to cook them about 3 minutes longer. they are tasty, but maybe a better one is out there.

These are so quick and easy - and relatively low fat given the 2T of butter for the entire recipe. These would be great alongside ice cream, sorbet, creme brulee (I know, there goes the low-fat!), and can be made in a flash.

I have been looking for this recipe since our house burned in 1998. My mother used to make this with my sisters and myself at Christmastime when we were growing up and there was always a little batter saved to bake Santa a fresh batch on Christmas eve. I have such fond memories of these cookies and am so happy to have found the recipe again so that I can share it with my children.

Rating: 2
I doubled the recipe and still only got 19 2.5 inch cookies. Pretty skimpy. The batter didn't taste good- the finished cookies look great, but just taste okay.

Rating: 3
Yum! These cookies were so delicious, and very easy to make. It gets you hands a bit messy though. If baked just right, the center is soft and moist and the outside has a bit of crunch! These cookies are great for roadtrips and picknics...little sweet treats! I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

These really hit that chocolate-craving spot! I make these often, and I love that they aren't just yummy but also come out so nice and pretty every time. The dough is a bit soft--I usually drop it into the bowl of powdered sugar and roll it around with forks until covered. Attention, vegans! This veganizes really nicely with margarine and Ener-G egg replacer, but you may want to either use a little more than 1 egg's worth of Ener-G or add a little extra margarine to the dough, or they will be a bit dry. Ener-G worked better than flax seed and water in these. These are meant to be cakey cookies, but the flax seed just made them really dry cakes.

a family favorite...easy to make...candy add-ins for a change of pace...try it

Mix butter with finger? Are we making pie crust or cookies here? If I made these again (and I probably won't) I would do the normal cookie procedure: cream the butter, add the sugar, etc. etc. Maybe that would help the finished texture which is dry and cakey and certainly not worth the effort of all the rolling and sugaring.

I've had much better cookies than this recipe. Not worth the effort.

I had to do body checks on my teenage son to keep him away from these cookies! As stated in other reviews, the dough is very soft. I found it easiest to dip out 16 lumps of dough at a time (that's how many fit on my cookie sheet) and put them on waxed paper. The rest of the dough went back in the freezer. I worked next to the sink to save on clean-up and discovered that putting a little conf. sugar on the palms of my hands between each cookie rolling was the best way to go. Also, after the first batch, I tried just dusting my hands with the sugar and rolling the dough around instead of rolling and dipping the cookies into the conf. sugar again. The result was that the cookies came out with a lovely crisp sheen instead of a layer of conf. sugar on the outside. A big improvement! I also tried some with finely ground cocktail peanuts. I took the lump of dough and dropped it into a bowl of ground peanuts (just this side of peanut butter), turned the cookie over to get some on the other side, and then did the rolling between the palms. The peanuts don't evenly distribute but who cares? My 3 tasters (2 teens and a husband) declared the peanut cookies the best of all.

Rating: 2
The dough is very easy to make. Very easy to make cookies. But be aware that it's a messy dough when rolling them into balls as indicated. A great cookie to make with your children. I think the cookies could be a bit sweeater. But great cookies to go along with a coffee when you have guests.

I subsituted Canoleo (a non-hydrogenated, trans-fatty acid free margarine) for the butter and these turned out great! They are like little brownie bites! And oh so easy. I will make them again.

Rating: 4
My husband RAVES about these cookies. I agree that they are pretty good, but he thinks they are the best he's ever had. They are a unique combination of moist & chewy and firm and cruncy. It is as if your first bit feels a bit like biscotti, and then you get to the soft brownie part. Very good! (They don't make nearly the number quoted, and doubling the recipe makes the most sense.)

Rating: 4
I would definitely double or triple the recipe!!! Really easy and fast. I didn't have confectionner's sugar at hand, so I used flour instead: and it was great (not too sweet).

These were ok. Didn't seem to be much different than a cheap brownie mix, though. I found the dough to be awfully dry and I'd suggest that anyone who attempts this add an extra tablespoon (or two) of butter.

Terrific cookie recipe! Easy and delicious. Made these as a kid and lost the recipe. Not overly sweet, nice cocoa flavor. Used high quality cocoa from Penzeys (www.penzeys.com). Rolled into balls/powdered sugar then flattened with my fingers a bit. Baked 9 minutes at 375 for a convection oven on silicon lined baking sheets. Doubled recipe and made normal size cookies yielded 3 dozen. Will become a standard in my repertoire.

Great cookie to make with kids_quick, easy and fun to roll the balls. I needed to triple the recipe to make a decent amount of cookies. We made them at xmas, because my kids love anything chocolate. We called them "chocolate snow cookies" because of the powdered sugar on the top! Quite festive for the season!

A vivid reminder of those cookies I ate as a child -- the ones in a little brown box with a tiger on the front -- and yet strangely grown-up. Delicious.

I've made these cookies three times in three weeks now. Everyone loves them, they're quick and easy, and my 3-year-old son enjoys helping me make them. (For the benefit of those baking with their kids, the ingredient and instruction list is simple enough for even the youngest assistant, and they are quick enough that the children don't lose patience waiting for the end product.)

Found these to be quite a bit of work for the amount of cookies it produced. Though they did taste good. Kind of a brownie texture to them.

Rating: 2
The cookies are good right out of the oven, but lose their appeal after a day or so. Perhaps using a higher quality cocoa would have helped. But they are easy to make and kids would enjoy them.

Loved these -- I made them thinking I would have them to set out at a luncheon I cooked for, but none of them survived the night. The kids had fun 'helping' me coat the balls with sugar, too. Will definitely do this again.

I've already made four batches of this cookie. I love the fact that it is not sickeningly sweet. The texture is dense and cake-like inside with a crispy outer part. It's a beautiful cookie too. I found that I had better results when I didn't refrigerate the dough before rolling it into balls. It was too crumbly when I did it that way. If you can manage to salvage enough of these, they freeze very nicely.

Where's the crackle? Did I do something wrong? Maybe they will be better when they cool, but warm they taste like cake. Not sweet enough for me...maybe I didn't roll them in enough sugar? OK, not great.

I took these to Thanksgiving dinner with my boyfriend's family (pressure!) and they were a huge hit! They look beautiful & are so easy to make. I accidentally baked them at 350 so they were a little undercooked even after giving extra time, but I think in the end it made them better.

I made a version of these cookies last Christmas and everyone that tried them loved them. Unfortunately I moved and lost the recipe, I am very happy I found it again. In the original version there was more cocoa and Sambuca - these additions make the cookie even more unresistable.

Rating: 3
These cookies couldn't be easier to make and they taste great. The better quality the cocoa the better the chocolate flavour. I used a very small ice cream scoop to form the balls before rolling them in icing sugar and the yield was only 16 cookies but they looked very nice indeed.

My sister's friend used to make these every Christmas. They were my favorite cookie and we lost the recipe over the years. How exciting to find it again! So easy and so tasty. I made my first batch last night and added almond extract to make chocolate-almond crackles. I've whipped up another batch this morning and added the extra tablespoon of butter other reviews suggested. Can't wait to sink my teeth into them...!

I also added an extra tablespoon of butter and some semi-sweet chips. The cookies very tasty!

"One thing they know is cookies," our friends often say. We would not disagree with them. We've made and tried so many cookies in our short lives that we might be two of New York City's foremost cookie experts. We won't mince words about this particular cookie recipe...it is phenomenal. The appearance...like a delicious version of a hot, cracked river bed gone dry in Nevada. The dark color...reminiscent of the asphalt of a winding Georgia road in summer. And the flavor...EXPLOSIVE! COCOA WONDERNESS! APOCALYPSE! TRY THESE COOKIES!
