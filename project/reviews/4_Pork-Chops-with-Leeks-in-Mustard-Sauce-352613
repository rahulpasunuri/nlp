Very salty.

We've made this several times and find that 1" thick chops work well and that letting them stand at room temperature with the salt mixture for 1 hour was just fine. We've used heavy cream when we didn't have creme fraiche - both worked well. This recipe is a real keeper!!

Three forks because I loved the pork chops themselves, but not the sauce, which is weird because I do love leeks and mustard. I put the rub on the chops about 5 hours early and then cooked for the recommended time, which resulted in very juicy, perfectly cooked pork. However, I thought the sauce was too thick - not at all saucy. I cut the sauce recipe in half because I was only cooking two chops - maybe that was the problem. It was good but not great.

Wonderful - made it into my 'soooo good' recipe box. Will make again for sure; like other reviewers, also got rave reviews from my husband. Used 2 chops ~1.5 inches thick. Only issues were a) saltiness and b) super moist but maybe a tad overcooked - both probably my fault. In retrospect, should've halved the salt mix given we only used 2 chops. Didn't have a working thermometer and didn't believe the thick chops would cook so quickly so added another 3 mins at the end - would stick with recipe time the next time I make this. Mustard leeks were great (even with marsala wine sub) - could use as a side dish for other meals, also.

Oops - sorry -- an additional comment from the peanut gallery: In looking at the picture again, I wonder: Where is the creme fraiche? The recipe said to simmer until liquid is gone (I didn't do that entirely..I left just a bit), then stir in the mustard and creme fraiche -- that in itself creates more of a sauce. The picture just looks like the pork chop is sitting in a bunch of dried, sauteed leeks. In actuality, if you follow the recipe, it should look and taste much better (mine did). :) Again, rave reviews from picky foodie friends.

This was really, really good! Everyone raved! I followed the recipe with the exception of using Marsala as that is what I had in the house. My leek sauce was a bit more "saucier" than the picture (I think it is too dry in the picture). I had some shallots and mushrooms that were going, so I tossed them in with the leeks for the sautee. Don't skip the bacon...was a nice touch. I also used really good mustard. MMM! I served it with green apple/potato mashed potatoes with chives and a dash of very high end (aged) cider vinegar...also served with some sauteed chinese broccoli with lemon and a just a dash of balsamic. I am very particular about recipes, but liked this one. Again, my sauce had a bit more liquid to it...just a bit (LOL - more Marsala! :) ). I brined the porkchop all day in salt, sugar, water, and herbs, too -- and it did not turn out too salty at all like someone said (I used regular, non-fancy porkchops as well). Try it! It was incredibly easy, fast,minimal clean up, and would work well for even a large dinner party. It is pretty, and the sauce seems like you took all day (took me just a few minutes).

I made this using the Berkshire pork chops from D'Artagnan. I forgot the thyme and subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream/creme fraiche. I've been married 30 years now, and I can't remember getting such rave reviews from my husband,and our son as well. We'll be making this again.

This took me 1 1/2hr start to finish (not including brining time). Tasted good but didn't look that great on the plate. Omitted the brandy. Used regular pork chops and probably over cooked them.

Good...adjusted cooking time with commercial chops. Did brine first then marinate about a half hour...good!

Rating: 4
This recipe was easy and delicious. I used commercial pork chops and marinated them for about an hour. They end result was perfectly seasoned. One thing that others have mentioned, definitely keep a close eye on the pork chops if you use the commercial variety as they are thinner than the type they recommend. Also, I think the measurements were perfect. I followed the recipe exactly and all the flavors came out subtle and delicious. I made it with yukon gold potatoes pan fried with the leftover herbs.

Probably my favorite way to make pork chops. Very flavorful, and difficult to mess up--the pork always comes out moist.

I used 1.5 inch thick chops, followed the recipie and used creme fraiche and dried thyme. I made the mistake of brining the chops for ~ 5 hours-- way too salty but they were perfectly cooked per instructions. The sauce was flavorful and delicious but not at all attractive--mine looked like mud. I used a cast iron pan and probably let the leeks get too soft--but all in all something I would try again.

Rating: 4
Made this for company (including a few picky eaters) and it was a huge hit. My crowd is non-alcoholic, so I didn't add the brandy, and I forgot to buy sage, but otherwise I made this as directed. The sauce was delicious and made for good leftovers spooned over rice.

Delicious! I didn't have leeks so I used sliced red onion instead. Served with mashed potatoes and roasted carrots, asparagus and zucchini.

I thought this was a nice dish, but didn't feel the mustard flavoring came through that much. I think there are simpler pork dishes with mustard cream sauces where that flavor comes through more.

Rating: 3
This worked just great with boneless, skinless chicken thighs (season with salt, pepper and dried thyme and rosemary; after doing the bacon (or in my case, diced prosciutto, a product at our grocery store), brown the thighs around 3 minutes per side, remove then start with the leeks. Everything else the same except no finishing in the oven; just simmer thighs in the leeks sauce to reheat). However, I really like the texture of leeks and these melted away into the sauce. I might cut them differently next time so they maintain their "bite".

Rating: 4
This was Fantastic!! Didn't have the thick cut chops and had to adjust the cooking time. Still turned out GREAT. Left some of the cooking juices in the pain when adding the sour cream and mustard so I could immerse the chops in the sauce for a bit. Definitely will make again. My husband loved it. Chops got very tender.

Rating: 4
I used commercial double-thick chops, so I did a quick brine before following the recipe (1.5 c water/3T kosher salt/1T sugar, let chops sit in it for about 30 minutes). I used light cream instead of sour cream. This was AMAZING! I am going to try to streamline the recipe a bit, since it is a bit time-consuming, but I will be making this again and again.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. I only made one adjustment and that was using less mustard as recommended by another reviewer. I look forward to making this again and soon!

This recipe came out wonderful! The negative comments must have cooked it wrong. I made no changes and we enjoy every bite.

As recommended for commercial pork, I rubbed the chops with the salt mixture. They were tender, but way too salty. Not worth trying again. I'm going to move on to the next recipe.

I am not crazy about this dish. I think it is just ok. I have a simpler recipe which taste better than this one. I may try it again though to give it a second chance.

Made to every specification of the recipe, every dotted I and every second of every minute JUST AS STATED. Served with mashed potatoes and crisp steamed green beans from our garden. Turned out superbly. A perfectly cooked chop. My husband licked his plate (and I couldn't judge, I did the same thing :)

Divine. Made this for Father's Day. Added a pound of sliced mushrooms to the leeks, and didn't have any brandy so used port. Delectable.Even the kids scarfed it down. Plate licking good!!

I made this almost exactly like the recipe and my husband and I both thought it was outstanding. The only changes I made: my pork chops were "only" about 1" thick and I substituted more chicken broth for the brandy. The chops cooked to perfection in just the time suggested, and we thought the sauce had just the right amount of mustard. This was as good as any pork chop dish we've had in a fine restaurant.

Rating: 3
Sauce was great, but I had a problem with cooking the pork chops. Used quality loin chops, 2 inches thick, and followed directions. But they took over 30 minutes to cook through when you put them on top the leeks. Result was tougher chops. I even had them at room temp before searing. Maybe I should get thinner ones next time?

This was very good. My new porkchop recipe! I forgot the sage and used milk instead of sour cream. Served it with mashed potatoes.

WAY too much mustard. And I like mustard! Would use half what is listed and twice the amount of sour cream. The spices and herbs are good, but this is a lot of work for what I thought was a mediocre result

Superb flavor and fairly easy to make. This is definitely a keeper. Made as written and served with braised cabbage and a rosti.

I had some fabulous Berkshire chops that did not require anything beyond the spice rub. But the sauce was out of this world and really made the dish. I used creme fraiche and not the entire 2 tablespoons of mustard-as my daughter was looking on in horror as I added it. But you cannot taste the mustard with the leeks, brandy, and creme fraiche-it merely added another dimension of taste to the dish.

I made this recipe as written but added fresh wild mushrooms with the bacon about 3/4 the way through cooking the bacon--excellent addittion to the leeks. I served the dish with mashed potatoes with the chop leaned against them and poured the sauce around them with fresh herbs sprinkled on top. It looked better this way This is a keeper for me.

This is a great recipe. We placed the chop on the leek-combo bed and drizzled the creme fraiche/mustard on top. Looked nice.

Despite my husband's ranting that "a pork chop is a pork chop, is a pork chop. In the end it's still a pig." He said he really enjoyed this meal. Followed the recipe as written and thought the sauce was delicious. Served with roasted "smashed" red fingerling potatoes and sauteed kale. I'm not a pork chop fan, but I loved this recipe.

Rating: 4
Very easy and very good! Used "commercial" pork, but still salted just for a couple hours and it was fine. I did not return the chops to the pan, instead, finished them under the broiler, about 3min per side. Everything else according to the recipe. Delish.

Very yummy, just as-is. Served with eggs noodles. I haven't really made a recipe that featured leeks so prominently, but it was good and easy.

We loved this recipe. I think next time we might reduce the sage a bit - both my husband and I felt it was too front and center for our taste. I also would cook the chops for a shorter period of time, they were a bit overcooked following these directions - that could have to do with temperature variations from cooktop to cooktop. (For the cook who said the chops were dry, that's probably the reason - also, using heirloom pork helps, if you didn't, because it has a higher fat content and is therefore, much more juicy.) I don't think either of us is overly fond of mustard but it melds into the recipe beautifully and gives some tang to counter the richness from the bacon/pork/sour cream combination.

I so loved this!! The mustard/creme fraiche mix was the best part. For those that omitted that - I think that you're missing out. Certainly not pretty anymore, but worth it!

The leek mixture is not pretty. I think the photo they show is before the mustard and sour cream is added. When I saw it complete, I admit to feeling doubtful. However, it was absolutely delicious. Very rich flavors, so I balanced the meal with mashed potatoes.

Wow, this is really tasty. The chop is so flavored with herbs and mustard. I don't have any brandy, so I used white wine, taste fine to me. I also put 2 cups of cooked barley in it at the end to absorb the liquid instead of boiling it away which takes care of carb side. Yum!!

This was a very good recipe. I bought some very expensive chops at the butcher (that I was later regretting), but the quality of the recipe was worth paying the extra $$ for premium chops. Next time I would use better quality brandy (or cognac) to get even better results.

Wow, this was absolutely delicious. We made pretty much everything according to the recipe, with the one exception of using dried herbs du provence instead of fresh thyme and rosemary, mostly because we had them on hand. I would absolutely make this again!

I wouldn't change a thing. The flavors are extraordinary! By all means use fresh herbs. I served with noodles which seemed to be just the right thing. I'll make this again and again.

The blend of flavors and textures in this meal is exceptional, especially for those who love both pork and mustard with a passion. having made this recipe several times before to requests for repeat occurances it's one of the favorites in our house. i have had some trouble with directions, however. every time i have attempted this recipe with a chop that is truly 1.5-2" thick they take far longer than 3 mins per side to heat to the recommended 140-145 degrees.

The leek part of this was absolutely amazing. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the pork was dry and not very tasty. However, the leek slaw, or whatever you call it, would honestly be great with ANYTHING...steak, chicken...you name it. I just bought some chicken breasts and am going to make it again but with chicken. I'm telling you, you will work your butt off on this and then the leek slaw will be gone and you'll wish you had more, so I really suggest doubling it if you have a pan large enough. As per others suggestions I used half the mustard that was called for and it was PERFECTO!!!

Rating: 4
This recipe is outstanding and not difficult to make. I only had 2 pork chops, but used the full amount called for to make my sauce and while maybe not the best for my health, am glad I did! Do not leave out the mustard and creme fraiche as another reviewer suggested, it's taking away a large portion of the flavor! For people who don't love mustard, cutting in half might not be a bad idea, but to be honest I don't and while I found it mustardy, I thought it was in the right proportion and still loved it. I will make this anytime for guests. My only (slight) complaint is it looks pretty drab on the plate.

This was outstanding! I'll confess that I just picked up some bone-in chops at Target. This recipe turned them into a delicacy! We followed the recipe exactly, save for the creme fraiche at the end--our kiddo has a dairy allergy. I could have eaten all of it. So simple, too--we'll be cooking this for dinner parties soon.

This was excellent! I used pork tenderloin because I was cooking for 6. I browned in the pan then moved to a roasting dish in the oven to finish cooking while I made the sauce. I only used 3 cups of leeks (that was all I had) and it was more than enough. Turned out I was out of brandy so substituted tawny Port. Next time I will double the bacon!

Rating: 4
We have some delicious Berkshire pork and used two 3/4 inch bone-in chops...I accidentally reduced the leeks in their sauce more than I intended, until they started to break down and become more of a chunky sauce. Served with roasted & then smashed tiny yukons. My husband raved "Yum! Put that one in the Tastebook! That's a '10.'"

Rating: 4
I changed this into something entirely different, but the combination of flavors was wonderful. I basically followed the recipe, except I cubed some boneless pork. After sauteeing the leeks and garlic, I added some flour to thicken the sauce then proceeded. I put the browned pork back in the pot, brought to a simmer and covered for 1-1/2 hours until tender. I skipped the sour cream because the sauce was didn't seem to need it. Very good.

Great taste. Next time I will make the mustard sauce with only half the mustard. It is overwhelming and although good, its a bit too strong. We all loved the dish!

The rub on the chops was delicious. However, I would omit the mustard and creme fraiche next time - didn't add to the recipe. Would definitely make again. I did salt the chops early in the day and took out of the refrigerator about one hour before cooking.

This was very good. Although I know that bone-in pork yields more flavor, I will probably substitute bonless loin chops next time, as I'm not a fan (nor my kids) of cutting meat from the bone! The sauce was very rich and flavorful!

Yum! I cut the receipe in half, but for the bacon of course and it was delightful. I did substitute no fat greek yogurt for the sour cream/creme fraiche, and did not have time for the rub to set for a day - to no notice. The what was available (not heirloom) chops may have benefited from a day's rest with the rub or some brining, but were tender anyway. I will have these again and will not fret over the lack of the heirloom chops.
