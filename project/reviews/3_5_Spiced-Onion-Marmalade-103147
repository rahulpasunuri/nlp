Afriend made this with pork tenderloin and it was wonderful on the pork and on the rice.

I've only just finished making this. it's cooling now in fridge for later use on steaks tonight. I must say, I was sad that my stash of tomato paste packets in the freezer were gone/used up and the only jar of tomato paste in the pantry looked suspect, upon opening it, it burst, so got chucked for danger reasons. I added two of my very small ripe tomatoes from the yard, plus can not find my ginger in freezer to save my life and the powdered is MIA also. So not complete effect in the recipe. I'll post when it's been consumed at dinner time. I almost dropped in during cooking time, a bunch of the best tiny ruby red grapes I bought yesterday that are sweet beyond belief, but wanted to stick as close to this recipe as possible considering the two ingreds I didn't have, so thought better of holding back the grapes. Maybe next time I will though. I don't have high hopes.

I have lost count of the number of times I have made and shared this highly versatile recipe. Vidalias are more readily availabe here but that is the only variation. This is fabulous with baked chicken, turkey, on sandwiches, on crackers as appetizer, served with cold ham, and many other uses. I freeze small jars to keep on hand. Easy and versatile-I just love the stuff!

Good, but not outstanding. Took longer to cook.Made w/boneless rotisserie pork.

The flavors were good, they just didn't seem to go well together. The ginger and nutmeg stood apart from the other flavors and seemed to overpower even the onion. We won't be making this again.

I can this wonderful and simple to make Onion Marmalade, present it in a pretty jar, and give the marmalade to friends and family for holidays, hostess gifts, etc. It's different, delicious and fun. Everyone wants the recipe, but where's the fun in that?! sharing is so overrated!

This is just fabulous. Not only was it easy to make I actually had all the ingredients! Will definitely make this again, probably to try on something else next time.

This marmalade was so good, I made extra and canned it for later. Simply put into hot, sterilized 1/2 pint jars, top with hot lids and put into hot water bath for 10 minutes. It will keep a long time and makes a great gift. This stuff is great with pork roasts, too.

Very good - a great combination of flavors that blends together beautifully. I did drain off a lot of excess oil, even without having read other reviews previously. The texture is almost like that of an onion chutney. Loved the pork rec. this goes with, and I'd like to try it with chicken, too.

Awesome recipe. Don't let Cook from Boston/NYC/LA influence you. Perhaps this person smokes because their taste buds must be shot...

I make extra when I cook this so as to have leftovers. The next day I mix it with cooked rice for a wonderful taste treat.

Followed the recipe pretty closely alhtough I took my time cooking the onions. My family and friends loved this. We had it with pork and even my 4 yr old loved it.

The onion marmalade was very well received at a cook-out. We put it on burgers and grilled chicken breast sandwiches. I thought it called for too much oil and balsamic vinegar. I drained off quite a bit of each. I would start with about half the amount called for of each. I cooked the onions more slowly over lower heat and that worked well. Based on some of the other comments, I reduced the spices, giving it just a few shakes of nutmeg. Excellent. I might try adding raisins or currants to this to go with pork next time.

I too served this with plain pork chops and found it very satisfying. At first I thought it would make a very dominating side, but it is really eaten as a condiment. Having read the previous review, I skipped the cloves and nutmeg and it came out great. In fact I tasted it before seasoning and added just a touch of salt even though it was fine without, and ended up adding no pepper either. I will try it with the spices next time.

The spiced onion marmalade is great! I followed the recipie exactly and it came out wonderful. I served it palin grilled chops and it was great.

A truly horrible dish. All you taste is the combination of powdered spices, an awful, canned, bitter taste. If you use more garlic and fresh ginger, this might be passable, but it is still far inferior to good carmelized onions as a garnish. I tried to fix the flavor with more sugar and vinegar and tomato paste, even chilli powder (which did help) but it was still very bad.

My husband liked it so much, he wants me to make it for his parents when they come to visit.

This marmalade was so easy to make and was absolutely delicious. Thank you for getting the recipe. I plan to use it the next time I prepare a pork tenderloin.
