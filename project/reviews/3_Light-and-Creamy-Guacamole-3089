Just as the other cooks have said: it's refreshing and delicious, but definitely does well with extra salt and pepper and even some fresh lime juice.

Made as is, my guests loved it. I guess it was good, I just kept comparing it to real guacamole, which nothing compares to. But a good light alternative.

Awesome! This really was good. My husband wasn't as thrilled with the "undertaste" of the yogurt so I'll add more salt, pepper, and lime juice next time.

I really loved this guacamole. I didn't even do the straining yogurt thing - I just used it right out of the container - and it tasted great.

I am not a guacamole fan but my husband said it was fantastic.

Nice light alternative to regular guacamole; definitely needs salt and pepper to help balance the yogurt and lemon juice. Next time, I'd like to add some more spice (cayanne or tabasco) and maybe some diced, seeded tomatoes.

This appetizer was a snap to prepare and it looked great. I used a mandoline to cut the vegetables so they were all uniform in size. I liked it b/c it helped to lighten out a heavy mexican meal I was having for a dinner party. Also, if you forget to strain the yogurt overnight, I am pretty sure a non-fat sour cream would make an easy substitute. Lastly, this dish definitely needed salt to cut the sourness of the yogurt and lemon juice.
