Excellent for a starter. The caper sauce is outstanding with the crab cakes. My wife insists we have these as an appetizer about once a month. One of our favorites.

We didn't make the crabcakes -- already have a favorite recipe -- but the caper sauce was really good and easy to make.

Made this as a first course for an small intimate dinner as an alternative to a traditional salad. Very good. I'd make this one again.

This is a good, simple crab cake recipe, but it definitely calls for too much mustard. I'd reduce the mustard to 2 tbsp at most

I make this recipe all the time for parties. They are gone in a blink and everyone raves about them. Mix them up ahead of time and cook right before your company comes.

The caper sauce was nice, and the flavors were delicate...perhaps a bit too delicate. It left me feeling that the dish was not as distinctive as it could have been, when using such good ingredients. The crab cakes were okay, but too many breadcrumbs for my taste. We used claw meat to increase the sweetness of the crab and it was very nice. This was not a bad recipe by any means, but the other crab cake recipes had improvements.

This was a great recipe! I especially enjoyed the caper sauce. I used panko instead of breadcrumbs because that is what I had on hand and it worked wonderfully.

This was my second time trying to make crab cakes, the first time with this recipe. I was worried that the crab cakes would fall apart while I was frying them but they stayed together beautifully. I used panko bread crumbs, made the crab cakes 1/3 cup large, and served them with the caper sauce. Everyone loved them. I got the crab from Trader Joe's--they have 1 pound cans of big lump claw meat for about 8 bucks!

This was a great recipe. The only change I made was to use pankos instead of bread crumbs. I think it made the crabcakes 'lighter'.

Crab cakes recipe was only two forks as written. It needed more crunch and less mayo. 2nd time around, I added chopped sweet onions, replaced the mayo with another egg, replaced the mustard with 1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, and added salt. The sauce, however, should get four forks.

This is one of my favorite recipies with a few minor changes. For the sauce, use plain (no fat ;)) yogurt or cut the mayo with yogurt, a bit of lemon zest rather than juice and mix in herbs you like (fresh mint or thyme), +/- the chives. I agree with one of the comments that you do not need to add much to good crab for fab crab cakes. On that note, a little panko rather than bread crumbs works well. I think Old Bay is wonderful with shrimp boiled in beer! but not here, it overpowers the great delicate crab taste. Making them tomorrow with fresh Rhode Island Point Judith Crab :), sauce best a day ahead.

Thought these were very good. Only refrigerated cakes for 15 minutes while I got rest of dinner together. Redipped cakes in egg and fresh bread crumbs prior to frying. There are better sauces out there, but you don't need much with good crab cakes. Was especially delicious with garden fresh tomatoes, basil, and fresh mozzarella. Served mashed potatos and fresh green beans. Enjoyed a nice Pinot Griggio.

I have made this many times as main course (larger cakes) and they are always a hit - especially for a picnic. I use prepared bread crumbs and decrease to a cup for less "bready" cake. I also bake mine instead of frying to lighten up. The caper sauce always gets rave reviews

One more thing - if you don't make fresh bread crumbs (as I didn't), increase to two eggs, or add some cream or milk until the consistency is correct to make patties. Otherwise, it will just fall apart.

Definitely add wasabi paste or powder to the sauce; a good addition. I used panko. (I'm not going to be sitting around making fresh bread crumbs.) I would suggest, after cooling the mixture for a couple of hours, dip the crabcakes in a beaten egg, then coat with panko again, then fry. This gets a nice crust. Also, I find "Old Bay" overpowering to such a delicate taste. I used half the recommended amount, and addeed salt, peeper, and Tabasco to taste.

The cake and the sauce are perfect.

THIS IS FOR THE SAUCE ONLY. Made a different crab cake recipe, but tried this sauce. It didn't come together quite like I would have wanted. Added some Wasabi paste. Helped greatly.

For the sauce only - We thought this was great. Yes, it's a glorified tarter sauce, but you can't buy tarter sauce in Istanbul, so it's a nice substitute. I will use it later this week on fish.

I have made these crab cakes 3 times now for different groups of people and everyone just loves them. It's a very simple recipe and I haven't even been refrigerating them before frying and they stay together great. The sauce is delicious and would be good with any other fish. I have been using the lump crab that you buy in a can from Costco and I tastes great!

THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE CAPER SAUCE ONLY. Frankly, it overpowers the taste of a good crab cake.

Rating: 3
Very good; I made the cakes in minature (about 1.5 tablespoons each)and served the sauce as a dip at a party. They went in about 10 minutes and days later people are still talking about them. I used homemade mayonnaise in both the dip and the cakes; I highly recommend it.

3.5 for the sauce alone; never tried the crabcakes (stuck to the terrific 'super-rich virginia crab cakes' on this site). Tangy and incredibly tasty with extra lemon juice and fat free or reduced fat mayo. Keeper!

Too much everything in this recipe, except crabmeat. This recipe should be halved, at least, with the same amount of crabmeat. The ingredients were correct, though. For a good crab cake, keep it simple. You shouldn't need onion, celery, red pepper, etc., as many people insist on throwing in. Just get good quality crabmeat---and don't forget the Old Bay.

I used dried herbs and only made 1/3rd of the recipe as a dinner for 2... came out yummy! The sauce has a tangy sour-salty taste to it. I used more crumbs than it calls for, and popped them in the freezer for a bit to try to help them hold their shape better.

The crabcakes were a little dry, but good. I thought the sauce was way too heavy for crabcakes but may be good with some fish .

Loved the caper sauce - even though it is 'dressed up tartar sauce.' Made the crab cakes with phony crab meat, but it was still good. Even the kid ate it.

This was my first time making crab cakes and I thought the recipe was easy to follow and the result was quite good. But the recipe gets a three forks for the sauce alone. I used the leftovers for some nice ocean catfish and potatoes the next day--Yum!

This was excellent as a main dish...and I love the creamy caper sauce with any seafood.

This is a favorite of my 17-year-old, who requests them for his birthday dinner. And I make the caper sauce whenever we have grilled salmon, or any other seafood--Much better than traditional tarter sauce!

I loved this sauce and have made it several times for company. As for the crab cakes themselves, I am sort of a devotee of the Maryland blue crab; the Maine crab just lacks flavor. Also, I simplified the recipe for the cakes themselves by using an Old Bay crab cake seasoning mix that I have only been able to find in Maryland. All crab, very little filler and lots of flavor. Yum! And the caper sauce is delicious not a bit labor-intensive.

I did not make the crabcakes; I made only the tartar sauce. It was excellent but I did not use it on fish. Instead, I used it in a very simple potato salad -- about 5 medium red potatoes and 4 hard boiled eggs, nothing else other than the tartar sauce to bind it. Very tasty and very simple. Because there were no onions or celery, the salad did not get watery after sitting for a day. Try it with a good fried chicken recipe.

This was the first time that I tried Crab Cakes, and boy did we love them. We will make these over and over.

My rating only applies to the caper sauce as I haven't made these crab cakes (Can't part from the "Super-Rich Virginia Crab Cakes" recipe found on this site). This caper sauce is so good I just had to make a comment. It's sinfully good, we love it. It's fantastic and makes the cakes.

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. But instead of the caper sauce I served it with a roasted red papper mayonaise.

Breadcrumbs in any crab cake recpipe are just filler to me and make the end results bland, and I'm sorry but "caper sauce" is tartar sauce with a more expensive ingredient.

Terrific dish, however I would use less peppers next time. Quite impressive served with martini's

Not quite a review of the dish, but I couldn't help sharing that I tried the caper sauce with some pan-fried salmon and it was delicious.
