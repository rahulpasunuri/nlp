I have made this several times now and I love it. It is such a great cold weather/sick/rainy day soup. I use 4-5 quarts of water and follow the rest of recipe and it has come out perfect every time. It freezes really well also. I chop the onion, garlic and celery and leave it in the soup with the chicken after removing the ginger and the peppercorns and it makes for a heartier soup.

This has become a staple for my freezer. It is exceptionally great when a cold or a flu strikes. I up the amount of ginger and garlic and reduce the water to about 4-5 quarts. While I sometimes have it as a soup with the chicken, it's also great just straight as a broth.

Very good. I reduced the water by 1/4. I think it helped with the flavor. Do not forget to add salt at the end.

I used very fresh ginger, and it was mild but very present in the taste. I've used it as a base for other soups and stir fries as well as drinking it on its own. Very good!

I followed the recipe and it was very bland, not sure what happened. Next time I need to be "cleansed", I'll just have some ginger tea.

This recipe is a huge disappointment. It isn't worth the time and money.

This is a very light broth. After the recommended cooking time, the 6 quarts of water did reduce to under 4 quarts. I suppose some might call this broth bland, but it is supposed to be gentle on the stomach. There is another soup on this site that I have made called ginger-scented chicken soup that I liked. I am glad I made this today, because I needed it. Thank you.

This is my first review but I have been cooking recipes from epicurious for over 20 years. I was so disappointed in this broth that I thought I should let people know it was definitely not worth the time. My mom who also cooks a ton was equally disappointed. We both followed the recipe exactly and the broth was lacking in flavor and the ginger was very hard to detect.

I made this strictly for the broth (I use the chicken in sandwiches). My pot wasn't big enough for 6 quarts of water so I started with 4 and then added more as it cooked down. The broth is very light and quite delicious. Perhaps because of the very large quantity of water it is not very gelatinous, unlike other chicken broth I've made. Will make this often. (The broth can also be thickened with corn starch for a Chinese-style sauce for steamed veggies and shiitake mushrooms).

I'm not convinced that 6 quarts is the correct quantity of water. I followed the recipe exactly, and am left with significantly more than 8 cups of broth, and it has very little flavor, even after salting. I'll give it one more shot and use only four quarts of water, as another reviewer suggested.

I made this when I was ill and felt a lot better after I eat a bowl of this lovely, warming soup!

Wonderful and warming. Excellent also with ginseng and goji berries added.

This is some amazing broth, and would make a great base for any number of asian-style soups. I only had 2 1/2 hours to let the broth simmer, so I reduced the water to 4 quarts. The broth is the perfect "density" - not too heavy, not too light. I will definitely freeze some of it for when I inevitably get a winter cold.
