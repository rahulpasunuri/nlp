Trader Joe's sells cipolline already peeled so I made this recipe. Everyone thought they were delicious. I served as part of antipasti. Leftovers went into sandwiches. So good!

This is one of my favorite recipes in my file. The only problem with this is trying to keep from eating them before they've had the chance to sit for a day or two! A spectacular side dish/condiment. Really good with pork or any kind of smoked meat

just made this tonight for the upcoming thanksgiving holiday in 2 days. I found a 3 lb bag of cip. onions at costco last month, and went looking for a great recipe for them. I would suggest not adding the peppercorns, as the tastings I did when this was cooking always brought up a peppercorns, maybe add ground? My mound of of onions cooked up to half the size, and I started with 2 lbs, had used some during the weeks since I bought the bag. Taste is phenominal on the thick sauce, I didnt have to boil it down like suggeseted for the last 15 mins, it was already thick and reduced. I added my balsamic at that point. I added a full head of garlic with the cloves in quarters to the original one hour boil, and think it was a great addition. This is a great recipe, but when it cooked down is more of a appetizer than a side dish, plan accordingly on starting amount and you will more prepared. I can tell these flavors will only get better over then next 2 days till I need to serve! this is good.

Veru good. Used "real italian cipolline" onions, which are bitter. Needed to cook longer @2-1/2-3 hrs. Added more sugar, because these were especially bitter. Made them a day ahead, and they were good.

We loved these onions in Italy & in Italian markets so I saved the recipe & recently had a go at them. The taste was excellent but my boiling onions didn't soften uniformly. Maybe the odd shape of real cipolline help solve the problem but they are difficult to find where I live.
