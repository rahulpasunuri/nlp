This is very easy to make & even to modify for beef stew. Just caution on adding curry, I added extra & it wasn't the added flavor I desired. Use of tomato paste also works well vs tomatoes. This last time I was a bit more cautious & it turned out perfectly, even added a bit more brown sugar ....truly yummy! My inspiration to make this was from a high end restaurant in LA & mine was as good as theirs!

Well, I don`t understand. I followed the recipe Exactly, using porter instead of stout. Exactly. I put up with scrubbing the burnt sugar off the bottom of my Dutch oven and the 3.5 hrs cooking time... only to end up with tough short ribs (and a great deal of liquid still in the pot at the end of the cooking time). Sigh. And I was looking forward to some nice, tender short ribs. It's not all that much work, but it IS a big time investment. Why am I the only one who has had this problem with this recipe?

The only flaw this recipe has is the brown sugar rub on the short ribs. Be careful when you sear it as the brown sugar and burn very quickly and leave a nasty black sut. Otherwise...very very tasty.

It got a little warm here today so wanted to try the short ribs on the bbq. Glad I did because they turned out wonderful! Grill seared the ribs first and think that was the key!! Wonderful!!!

I made this on what turned out to be a hot day, but everyone in my family enjoyed it. I did add honey at the end because I used Guiness and I pureed a good two cups of the veg and sauce. Served it over polenta with freah sage and it was amazing and very filling.

Great and easy recipe. I didn't have regular paprika, but had smoked paprika instead and it still turned out well. We ate over rice and thoroughly enjoyed it.

this is the bomb-diggity. by cooking the ribs in a pot, instead of a baking dish or pan, the liquid will stay in place and you won't risk having the ribs prematurely exposed to the air. the taste of the stout is subtle by the time it's done, so don't worry if you don't love stout

Mmmm... Success! It came out really well and was very popular. First batch was the best, which was *before* I got nervous and added more tomatoes and beef broth. Not needed. Porter, shanks, stew meat, lots of luxurious cooking and resting time. Yum.

I am listening to a Fresh Air podcast -- by the author's of Cooks Illustrated, where they describe how they test all their recipes by doing terrible things to them, like real users do -- and I'm cooking this recipe, and I realize I'm so guilty. I'm making this for a big party. I'm not using ribs, but shanks and stew meat. I'm not so sure I've gotten the proportions right in each of the pots going into the oven. My idea is it should sort of end up with tasty bits of meat, like swedish meatballs, that are a counterbalance to cookies and mulled cider. I really have no idea what I'm doing, but I'll check back in tomorrow and rate the recipe when I do...

Short ribs have been "discovered" and are not usually very affordable here so i made this with thick slices of beef shank at half the price. Excellent! Like others I found the slight bitter edge very appealling but tempered it with a couple t's of honey. Next time I would leave the brown sugar out of the rub (add it later) to get better browning on the beef without burning. Pureed all of the veg's and sauce into a thick gravy.

Outstanding flavor that just gets better as leftovers. The carrots even taste a little sweet. I probably should have bade it a day before and reheated it, but the aromas are just too hard to resist. Added a few mushrooms which seemed to make it even richer. Served it over rosemary mashed potatoes,which was a wiiner. Served it with a syrah rather than more beer, and liked the result.

Rating: 4
This is definitely a keeper. I substituted porter for the stout as others recommended and it was perfect. I don't know why, but I didn't end up with any liquid left in my dutch oven after braising for 2 hour. However, the ribs were so rich that its probably for the best. Served with buttered egg noodles and it was perfect for a damp rainy day.

I have made this dish on several occasions. I follow the directions rather faithfully, with some exceptions. Twice I've made it with brisket. I think it works better with a flat-cut brisket than with short ribs (especially if eaten, as briskets tend to be, the next day). It may be worth knowing this as we head into "brisket season" (St. Paddy's day to Passover), when this cut is readily available in the meat case. When I do a brisket, I also turn down the heat a bit (to 325) and let it braise for 3 hours. (I reduce the sauce just before serving the next day). For those who find it bitter: personally, I like the slight bitterness, which to me is necessary for cutting through the sweetness. But I also find a handful (1/4 to 1/2 cup) of chopped dates thrown in the braising medium does wonders for the sauce, gives it a nice complexity that simply adding more sugar can't match.

So I reviewed this recipe about 4 years ago, wow! time flies... Love, it still. This time i switched things up a bit. I used the meat for one of my fillings for a taco bar; to be topped with some pickled red onion, and fresh arugula. BUT, on the cooking part. I completely forgot to buy the stout!!! My fridge choices were champagne, or ginger beer. I opted for the ginger beer, and was pleasantly surprised! It is sweeter (but I wanted that for my tacos) Ya, I know it sounds a little yuck, but, really, it's pretty good!!

I made this last night and my family and I really enjoyed it. It was a bit sweet and I wish I had added mushrooms as someone suggested. I think the earthiness would have been nice. I'll do that next time. I thought the sauce a little flat at the end so I added the juice of 1/2 a lemon and that gave it just enough extra depth. I will definitely make this again.

I loved the way this dish turned out...rich, sweet, and flavorful. I added chanterelle mushrooms (1/4 lb) to add a little veg, and texture and they were delicious on their own. I plan to make this many more times. Good idea on the Porter...I'll try that next time.

What a good meal on a cold and snowy January night. Looking forward to the leftovers. It would make an awesome beef stew instead of the ribs, will try that.

Rating: 4
Intense! My husband wants me to make these again. I took heed to other reviewer's comments about the bitterness of this dish, and used a Porter instead of a stout. That was the only deviance, and it turned out great. The vegetables are deliciously caramelized when it's done. I will mention that it's extremely rich and heavy, so keep that in mind when you're making your menu. We definitely should have served it over egg noodles.

I really looked forward to making a stout-braised short rib recipe. The sugar used in the rub burns very easily during the initial browning causing the dish to be off tasting despite the fact I cleaned the bottom of the pot to remove the bits of scorched material. I followed the recipe very faithfully otherwise and got only mediocre results. I was disappointed after all that effort.

Rating: 4
I love braising meats. This was so good. Rich,tender, and the smell of curry was fabulous. I did use a Porter instead of Stout as hubby didnt want to give up his only bottle of Stout. I did use lite brown sugar and it worked great. Be careful of Lecreuset as the spices will burn the bottom of the pot but did clean up after some elbow grease. Hubby says this is a keeper.

I always eye ball my spices. For this recipe I went overboard on every spice and it really pays off. I actually skipped the brown sugar once but found myself missing that slight sweet flavor. I made these for a dinner party and everybody in the room was melting in sheer pleasure from this wonderful comfort food. Add extra paprika, curry, pepper, mustard and garlic

Easy, delicious, no fault. I wanted a bit of sweetness so I cut back on the tomatoes to about half and added about 1 1/2 T molasses to the boil near the end. Very good.

I love this dish! There was no issue with bitterness at all -- I did add a bit of honey before putting it in the oven, but overall the flavors were perfect, robust, complimentary. Yum Yum Yum.

I loved this recipe! I made it just as written and loved the way the meat fell apart and the deep, dark sauce coated the noodles. Was great warmed up as we ate the leftovers. I like the other reviewers' suggestions to add parsnips or prunes, although with nearly 4 hours of cooking (2 and 1/2 hrs the first day, and 1 1/2 hours to warm up the second day), all the vegetables are disolved into the thick, dark, rich sauce. MMMM.

These ribs were good but not as great as I expected given many of the reviews. I followed the recipe except for replacing the Guiness with a dark amber beer and I didn't have the bitterness that many of the reviewers discussed. I liked the curry and the hint of sweet.

I made this dish for my fiancé's birthday dinner. I followed the recipe as written, with the exception of substituting a large parsnip for two of the carrots. My fiancé was delighted with the dinner and loved the flavor. At first, I did not notice the bitterness that many of the reviews mentioned, but the day after it came through a bit, but not too strongly. I might try something next time to cut it if I remember. All the flavors worked really well together, and I was quite skeptical of the curry in the meat seasoning. Next time I'd add more salt to the overall dish, as it came out a little under- seasoned. To finish the dish, I blended about a cup and a half of the veggies with a stick blender and added them back in to thicken the gravy. Instead of egg noodles, I opted to serve the ribs over polenta as suggested by another review. Overall I did not find this particularly labor intensive as some did. Definitely on the list of repeat recipes.

I thought this was an excellent short rib recipe. The only things that I changes were the spices and I blended the veggies w/ the stock for the gravy. Haven't had beef this good since my Grandma had to start cooking "healthy".

OK but not great -- the curry powder was overpowering -- I recommend using just half the amount. The search continues for the perfect short ribs recipe...

These were pretty good and pretty easy to make (watch out for burning sugar) The stout did add a bit of bitterness that should be cut with a bit of sweetness but served over mashed potatoes (I made colcannon) they were excellent.

Divine! The first time I made this I followed the directions to a "T" and it was awesome. This time however, I added about a half cup of pitted prunes, 2 Parsnips and served it with Soft Polenta. My guests say they have never had anything sooooo delicious. And I agree! Deep beefy flavour, a hint of bitter/sweet...Superb!!!

i didn't like this at all. i followed the recipe exactly, and found the finished dish much too sweet, in a sickening burned- sugar way. it reminded me of the (also sickeningly sweet) smell of the brachs candy factory in chicago when i was a kid. next time, i'll braise the short ribs in red wine, instead of stout.

Rating: 3
Followed the initial prep but then put it in the crock pot, using only 1/2 the liquid (stout, broth, tomatoes), for 10 hours at low. The braising liquid was very thin, but I thickened it by boiling it down on the stove for 15 minutes and adding a bit of cornstarch. The meat was just incredible - the stout taste penetrated to the very middle of each rib.

When braising with Guinness, adding 1- 2 tbs of honey at the end cuts the bitterness.

I used sam adams octoberfest and guinness. the flavors were dead on. Be careful when searing. The brown sugar did burn. If this happens wash your pan and add left over rub to your veggies while sweating them.

Interesting combination of spices, very tasty! To over come the bitterness I substituted sweet onion for the leaks and used Root Beer in place of the stout. Caution when browing the meat with the spices, the brown suger burns very easy. This has become one of my favorite recipes for pot roast as will as short ribs.

Definetely better the next day. I am a stout lover, but was put off a bit by the bitterness. I would try this again with a different kind of beer!

You can't go wrong with this; though the comment about the bitterness is true. I served the ribs over mashed potatoes and used the "stew" as a topping for pasta the next day. Really great.

Used boneless ribs, 20 ounces of a Stout called Gritty's Black Fly Stout from Maine. Added onion, ground fennel seed (didn't have cumin). Filled the house with delicious aromas and it tasted as good as it smelled. Yes, there is a slight bitter flavor to the sauce...that's what made it unique and interesting! Definately a keeper!

I usually make this with shoulder roast instead of short ribs and it's delicious. The meat falls apart and the sauce is delicious. I also prefer it with mashed potatoes instead of noodles, but sometimes the sauce needs thickening.

Good, but definately give full cooking time (2 1/2-3 hrs.) My suggestion: Roast short ribs in 450 oven to brown...this cuts down on the interior fat...

I would have rated this higher but the stout gives this a "stouty" flavor. If you don't like the bitter aftertaste of stouts, you probably should avoid this recipe.

Great recipe. Even the kids loved it. I made it with only 14 oz of stout. Even though, I thought the sauce was very thin. When I make it again...and I will, I will use less liquid (concentrated beef stock without the volume of 1 3/4 cups)and the full amount of the stout. Served it with mashed potatoes. Great comfort food.

My kids loved this, but my husband and I both thought it was way too sweet. Might make it again but without the brown sugar. The carrots and leeks add enough sweetness.

I made this dish twice so far and got rave reviews. Yes it is a little time consuming but well worth the effort. The flavors blend beautifully and the polenta is a nice addition. While the bone in adds flavor, the boneless worked extremely well the second time and it will for the third time as I will be making it again for more company.

Made this recipe exactly as described, with really good stout we picked up from a small brewery. Pros: a flavorful, very rich dish which complements the short ribs. Cons: the bitter from the stout comes through too strongly and clashes with the curry spices. We love curries and I love cooking with beer, but not together apparently since we didn't love this dish. I guess there are just too many fabulous ribs in B'ham and we're spoiled :)

This dish is time-consuming but not labor-intensive, and COMPLETELY worth every second it took. We used pork spare ribs instead of beef, and added some cayenne for a bit of kick. The meat was so tender and just fell off the bone, and the vegetables were caramelized and intensely flavored. A perfect Sunday dinner for us...since we rarely have the luxury of having a whole day to realx and cook.

Excellent. Cooked in roaster oven since I didn't have a large enough pot that would transfer from stove to oven.

One of the best short rib recipes I've tried. This is definitely a keeper. I used half the amount of ribs called for (there are only two of us) and used boneless, but kept the other ingredients the same. I would highly recommend making this the day before and skimming the fat before reheating.

This was one of the best rib dishes I have ever made...I am a Personal Chef and cannot wait to make it for a client, however this dish I made for our dinner tonight..The only thing I did different was made my veggies chunkier and I sliced my garlic length wise and thin, instead of chopped.

I love short ribs. I have been a Guinness aficionado since I was old enough to drink alcohol. I have had a lovely dish in England called Steak and Guinness Pie. I loved it. This recipe comes close to reproducing that taste. I remember the ten years I lived in San Diego just the way you two have described them today. Lovely city, lovely climate, good food was very hard to find. In 1978, I found a great butcher in El Cajon but I doubt it is even there any more.

I did it! I actually tried this recipe BEFORE there were any reviews (I SO need & love the feedback that I read in them.) Still - I had a big weekend away planned for 3 couples and limited cooking arrangments - so this was the perfect main dish. I made it at home, exactly as the recipe called for. Then ~ I let it cool, skimmed the fat, transported the dish & 2 days later reheated for the time called for, made the egg noodles (extra wide), roasted asparagus, opened the red wine & Voila! I appeared to be a cooking genius (which I am NOT!). Great recipe and please keep those reviews/comments coming for those of us who love to cook, but are "gourmet challenged"!

To Garden Guru in SD: I, too, shared your sentiments 5 years ago when we moved from Boston to San Diego about the lack of good butcher shops, not to mention no more than a few really good restaurants. In fact, I was so disappointed in our local meat choices that I had my Boston butcher overnight our goods on a monthly or quarterly basis and wuold freeze them. I'm pleased to report that I have successfully weaned myself off of this practice ever since I walked into Siesels' Meat Market, located on Ashton Street off Morena Blvd. I have been making short rib recipes from Gourmet and Bon Appetit on a regular basis and this is by far the best recipe I have found. Siesel's not only has the best butchers who are knowledgable and pleasant to deal with, they are more than happy to do custom cuts upon request (i.e. porterhouse veal chops which up until 6 months ago I was still getting via Fedex but all I had to do was ask and they were happy to comply.) As an aside, Costco (gasp!) sells good quality boneless short ribs that while are easier to deal with, lack some flavor compared to the boned version.

This is an excellent recipe - you'll love it. You can get almost as good results by dumping all the ingredients in a slowcooker and setting it on low for 8 hours, making the recipe not only delicious, but real easy.

Don't be put off by the unusual ingredient list. Wonderful flavor, rich rather than spicy. You will want to make it a day ahead if you use short ribs , there is a lot of fat to skim off and it's easy if refrigerated. Use a big pot, there is a lot of liquid until it cooks down a bit.

I couldn't seem to find beef short ribs with bones in, so I had to go boneless with this recipe. I got excellent reviews on it, but I did add a good deal of my own seasoning after tasting the finished product. It was a bit bland for me.

By the way... the photo looks awesome and I will definitely give it a try if and when this elusive cut of beef becomes available to me. I didn't mean to give the recipe the hint of a poor review. I just didn't fill out the top of the form as it didn't apply.

I can't belive no one has tried this yet. I'd be glad to if we had a butcher worth a hoot in this culinary wasteland of San Diego. This popular wave of short rib recipes in the past few years usually calls for a 4 in. piece, single-bone, or a two-bone, 14 oz. chunk. Nothing like this seems to be available at the retail butchers in this town. They're a bunch of low-esteem sissies with a food magazine phobia. There I've said it. I've called them out. Someone prove me wrong. Or at least bring on a good mail-order suggestion. Thanks from lowly, dining-deficient, San Diego.
