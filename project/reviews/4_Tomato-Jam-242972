I didn't really care for this as written. It took much longer to cook to produce a desirable result. I ended up adding ketchup and a can of ranchera salsa to kick it up. It ended up delicious, but only because of major tweeking.

I used fresh roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped, four garlic cloves and about a tsp of fresh thyme. The onions were sauteed longer until lightly carmelized and then the garlic was added for 3 minutes of frying time. I cooked it all longer, 20-25 minutes and gave it a couple of whirls with an immersion blender.

Used an assortment of organic tomatoes fresh from our garden-amazing. The smoked paprika took this to a whole other level. Can't wait to try this on food instead of just licking the pot.

I didn't think this was very jammy even though I did reduce it until there was no liquid left so I pureed mine. Now it's ketchup and it's delicious!

This is a wonderful addition to burgers and also with cheese and on toast - very verse-tel. I always cook it for longer than suggested to get the "jam" consistency.

I have had this in the fridge for a while now, and it is still delicious. Goes great with an egg sandwich, or with crackers and cheese. Followed the recipe pretty closely, just used a little more garlic and fresh thyme. Will make another batch when my current one runs out!

I loved this - on SuperBowl Sunday, I made this with canned, fire-roasted, diced tomatoes. I made mini cheddar cheeseburgers, used small bakery rolls and topped them off with this. It was a hit! I have so many ideas on what to use this on. Yummy!

I made this recipe as written. It has a great flavor, but is more like a tomato sauce than a tomato jam. I think the onion and garlic make it a sauce that you would use for pasta, rather than a jam that you would serve with cheeses or on toast.

we didn't use this recipe for the turkey burgers it was suggested for. We were looking for a tomato jam to use on prosciutto, manchego & arugula sandwiches. That taken into consideration, we modified the recipe by using 4 garlic cloves (we tend to increase or add garlic to EVERYthing) and doubled the sugar. it ended up perfectly on point for what we had in mind, a slightly sweet, savory pair with our sandwiches.

I've made this frequently. Smucker's used to make a tomato jam that I was very fond of, but I haven't seen it for a long time. This is better by far. Easy to make and good with either fresh or canned tomatoes. I notice that people say it's better than ketchup (and certainly I agree), but it's wonderful on a toasted english muffin with butter. In other words, I use it like jam or preserves as much as I use it as a condiment. It's also wonderful served with a mild buttery cheese and crackers. It actually keeps well in the refrigerator in a covered container, and I have it on hand most of the time. Experiment--it's wonderful. You can make it spicier, too, with dried pepper flakes or hot sauce.

I agreed with the Cook from Maclean, VA about using fresh tomatoes for this in the summer - we were drowning in them. I looked up a conversion for canned to fresh somewhere and I think it was about 8 medium tomatoes per 14oz can. Of course, peeled and seeded the tomatoes and obviously it took longer than 10 minutes to get to the right consistency (seemed kind of like a pasta sauce). I seem to recall closer to 30 minutes but I wasn't watching the time closely. Was super tasty but next time I will increase the thyme.

This is very flavorful, but I would recommend caramelizing the onions rather than just softening them prior to adding the other ingredients. Also, the name "jam" does not seem like the right description. Still it's tasty.

What I like about this recipe is that it's a new and different idea fora condiment. I LOVED it with the turkey burgers with olives and feta, and I'm really curious to try this with some others foods. This recipe makes a lot, though, so next time I think I may try just making half of it. Definitely worth the effort, though, it comes together easily but I did have to cook it longer than 10 minutes.

This is a GREAT topping for ANYTHING!! I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I used Delmonte "petit" diced tomatoes with garlic. Very, very good!

I love this recipe. I used fresh tomatoes rather than canned, and peeled them before chopping. I also used fresh thyme. It cooked down to a great consistency, and the flavor was very tomato-y, with just the right sweetness. We had some on our burgers for dinner that night. I never want to use ketchup again.

I used fresh tomatoes from my garden, and livened this up a bit by simmering the jam with a couple of teaspoons of picking spice tied in piece of cheesecloth. Skipped the black pepper all together.

it was great tasting. I loved all the chcunks of tomatoes. I think it is better than ketchup.

Why wouldn't you use fresh tomatoes when they are in such plenty right now and so delicious? I will tinker with it.

I'm planning to try this. Looks like an interesting alternative to tomato ketchup.

This recipe was very disappointing -- not bad, just not up to normal standards. Tomato Jam is normally quite good, but this version was rather plain tasting. I'd make it again, but only to tinker with it and see if the flavor can be improved.

This is excellent! It was a bit sweet, and just perfectt. I already have plans on using it in several other recipes!!! :)
