This is soooo tasty!! It certainly is not your everyday boring mashed potatoes. Great with any meat or fish. The only adjustment I made was I changed the half and half to whole milk, because that is what I had on hand. Still very delish! Great use of fresh fennel too.

I omit the fennel seed. I also add 4 oz.softened cream cheese when mashing vegies..a very good combo. Great with roast pork.
