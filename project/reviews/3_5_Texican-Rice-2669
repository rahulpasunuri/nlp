I made this for my husbands Tex Mex inspired Birthday supper.It is absolutely YUMMY. I used stock from Swiss marigold bouillon instead of the Chicken broth because we are veggies, plus I used Chipotle in Adobas sauce to spice it, love the smokey flavour. I could really just sit and eat it as it is, a great addition to the buffet table, and I think would be good for BBQ TOO!

I thought it tasted just like some rice-a-roni package. so boring.

Good,Good. I rated it 4 forks although I did make some changes (I'm a Texan): olive oil for butter, two cups long grain white rice for the 12oz of packaged, one pablano pepper instead of the bell pepper and I doubled the chili powder. All the other measurements were as per the recipe. It is easy to make a little ahead abd reheat or keep warm.

My fiancee loved this rice as a side to tacos. I would make it again just because he liked it so much. I thought it was pretty good too.

I just found my new standard spanish rice recipe! I think I'll just use plain long-grain white rice in the future, though. Not sure the wild rice is worth the added expense in this dish.

I make this rice every time we have Mexican now. My family sulks if I don't. It's the best rice recipe I have found.

This is a great-tasting Mexican rice recipe. It yields quite a lot, so if you're only cooking for two, as I was, you'll want to halve the recipe. My husband loved it.

A very good side dish with Mexican dishes.
