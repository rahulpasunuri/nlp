Made for Easter dinner to rave reviews. The baby artichokes are a bit of work however. And everything but the carrots and asparagus cook way down so you might want to have extra of everything else. I actually omitted the asparagus because I preferred to grill it outside. This was a lovely festive spring dish that is special. The salsa verde is superb and really makes it!

These roasted vegetables rival ones that you roast on the grill. The salsa verde is a wonderful accompaniment. I have made this recipe many times and everyone who tastes it remembers and loves it.

A hideous combination of flavors and way too much work. The salsa verde just added to my revulsion.

Beautiful dish! And it tasted great too. My guests were "wowed".

I didn't have fennel, but the other veggies with an herbed garlic olive oil sprinkled on top before roasting are devine. I also had a chicken cut in 8 pieces cooking on the same roasting pan so an additional sauce - the salsa verde wasn't necessary. The baby artichokes are easy to find at Trader Joe's reasonably priced as well as Henry's - sometimes a great price.
