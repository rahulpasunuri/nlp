It's good, but not as extraordinary as I hoped or as other reviews promised. I suggest tossing the sugar with the apples rather than sprinkling it on top.

Pastry is not my forte, so I used puff pastry as the base and went from there. Liked the addition of thyme to the syrup. Very rustic looking, but made too much juice, which ran out and burned.

A good recipe. It's basically like an apple pie without the top. The crust is flakey and buttery (very easily broken though). The thyme is also a very nice addition to the apples. Since they didn't have apple jelly in the store, I used 1/4 cup of blueberry and 1/4 cup of raspberry preserves. I suspect that you can substitute most jellies or jams into the recipe. Some tips: 1. Try to reduce the time to about 35 minutes (mine burnt a bit). 2. Be careful not to put too much wine on the apples (there was some spillage). 3. If you can, bake on parchment paper for easy cleanup. 4. If I were to make it again, I would divide the dough into eighths to create individual gallettes.

My guests have always loved this, and so have I.

I've been making this since it first appeared in Gourmet, and each time I make it, it's a great hit. Don't be afraid of the thyme. Its subtle flavors add to the galette's simplicity. Try it -- YOU WILL LOVE IT!

I haven't made this particular recipe, but do plan to for Thanksgiving dinner this year. I wanted to add a suggestion re. filling the galette. The galette recipes I am familiar with (I often make one with a tomato/cheese filling as an appetizer) state that when the filling is spread over the crust, leave an uncovered, 2" border all the way around. Then when the filling is in place, fold the uncovered edge over the filling, pleating it as you go. Just a suggestion...but it does look lovely and rustic that way.

It was delicious. It was beautiful. The guests were very impressed. But I think it was too much work - family and friends are always thrilled with a homemade apple pie, and it's a lot easier.

This really was a crowd pleaser. It makes a great presentation, and it tastes just as good as it looks. The dinner guests thought I had bought it at a bakery!

Like the cook from Austin, I first made this when it was on the cover of Gourmet in 1994. If you can locate the magazine, the picture was helpful in assembling the galette. This is our favorite apple dessert!

I first made this recipe in '94 when it first came out, and received rave reviews from my Thanksgiving guests. Since then, I've made it many times and have found that you can substitute the apples and thyme for peaches and rosemary with excellent results.

I made this recipe years ago when it appeared on the cover of Gourmet magazine. To my dismay I had either lost or threw away the magazine and have been trying to duplicate it ever since. Thank goodness through today's technology I have it again in time to make for Thanksgiving!

Very pretty -- looks like an apple pizza garnished with lovely little sprigs of thyme. An honest flavor -- you can really taste the apples. I think it's nice that the peel stays on; I think that helps contribute to the great apple taste. The thyme is nice but not overpowering. Good with vanilla bean ice cream on the side.

A different and delicious dessert, the combination apple/thyme is a real find.
