Not a 4 star sandwich but still a keeper. I will be making these regularly.

Indiana is famous for pork loin sandwiches too. When I make this I use pork tenderloins and use panko for the crust. No cornmeal. I usually cut each tenderloin into 3-4 pieces and pound with a flat meat pounder until thin. Then dredge in flour, salt, and pepper then a quick dip in beaten egg with a bit of milk and then into to the panko crumbs. I have sprayed them with canola oil in a Misto Sprayer and baked them until golden brown or ocasionally I will fry them in a little canola oil in a non-0stick skillet. A real treat and I think beter with the tenderloins.

I was a bit hesitant as I have never fried pork before, but these were so good. Unfortunately for my arteries, I feel as if I must add them to my repertoire. The sandwiches were enjoyed by all who ate them (on a hard roll, with mustard or ketchup.) I highly recommend them!

Being born and raised in Iowa, I can vouch for this recipe...it's as good as the sandwiches you will find sold in every little hole in the wall bar and diner across the state. Up in Iowa, they serve them with just yellow ball-park mustard and pickles. My husband, being from Texas, had to have his with mayo, lettuce and tomato. After he tasted my "purist" version, he's decided just to go with the mustard and pickles. Once the loin is pounded, it will look "huge", but part of the fun of this sandwich is that it should hang over the edges of the bun. Be sure to add the cornmeal to the coating mixture, and add more salt or seasoned salt to the mix. These are better over-seasoned than under. And serve these hot, right out of the fryer, as the crispy coating doesn't like to hold. This recipe took me back to my growing up days in Iowa. Thanks!

After traveling through Iowa and trying these sandwiches for the first time, I came home and tried to reproduce them. I didn't add the cornmeal, but that adds more substance to the coating. Thanks!
