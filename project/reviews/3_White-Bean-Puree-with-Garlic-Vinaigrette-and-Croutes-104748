I found this very bland. I ended up adding about 1/2 tsp. fresh pureed garlic and 1/2 tsp. cayenne pepper. That did the trick.

As an alternative to bread and butter or olive oil, this is healthier. I use Progresso canned white beans, it's easy and good!

Only made the bean part- but it was bland. Definately needs more fresh herbs or something.

This recipe makes a nice side dish when I want a change from the usual starches. I like it so much, that when invited to "make your own pizza" party with a bunch of foodies, I used this to make a white pizza. I spread the bean puree over the pizza dough, then drizzled the vinaigrette over the puree. I added sliced artichoke hearts, capers, and shaved parmesan cheese. We loved it!

This dish took a lot of effort but the outcome wasn't worth it. The taste was fairly bland and definitely not worth the calories. I think one could easily make a similar dish without the bread and the cream and some spices to liven it up. Wouldn't make it again.

Okay folks - let's not get crazy getting this to be a low-fat appetizer. Maybe substitute half and half for the heavy cream, but with the beans and olive oil this is not a "deadly" dish. The bread is probably more fattening. I doubled the recipe and had it for a whole week. Buy a baguette, rewarm in the microwave for 30-45 seconds and you're good to go. Easy and delicious - fat and all!

I used plain nonfat yogurt in place of the cream, and I think it probably added more zest. The dressing is very important to the flavor here. This was an interesting change as far as dips go, and I may make it again for variety, but I didn't love it.

It tastes quite bad without dressing and doesn't look nice. Humus (made with Chickpea)is a better choice if you are looking for a bean puree.

To a cook from Houston - you are right on about everything. well............did you mean eating it all at one time or spreading it out over a few hours? (just kidding) This is a great recipe. 1/3 cup heavy cream in an entire recipe I will cook any day to stay happy - and healthy. If a person is afraid of this recipe then they are too strict on themselves. Please....enjoy this recipe!!

I would leave out the bread and cream and substitute fat free fromage frais or fat free cream cheese (quark). Nor sure if either of these is available west of UK!! Or if so what they are known as. I agree the olive oil is worth the calories and the fat as far as overall health benefits are concerned.

Excellent recipe! For health-watchers: The one-third cup of heavy cream and five tablespoons is divided between six servings -- you didn't eat all the puree yourself, did you? That's a negligible amount of heavy cream per serving. BTW, olive oil offers benefits that far outweight the fact is is an oil. It is higher in monounsaturated (good) fat than any other oil; monounsaturated fats help lower blood cholesterol. This recipe really is a treat: good for you and delicious!

To the previous reviewer: There are actually FIVE tablespoons of olive oil in this recipe! It sounds delicious, I must admit, but definitely not all that healthy.

I am curious as to how anyone could think this recipe is healthy with 1/3 cup of heavy cream and 2 tablespoons of oil? I think some healthier substitutions could be made...
