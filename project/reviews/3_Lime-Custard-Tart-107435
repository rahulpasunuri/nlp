I've made this recipe several times, sometimes with lime juice, sometimes with lemon, and, after my first effort, it's always been a success. In my experience, beating the eggs gently but thoroughly before adding the other custard ingredients makes a huge difference--the custard won't separate. I found a 2" deep 8" diameter tart pan at B'way Panhandler in New York, but I've also made it in a more conventional 1" deep 10" diameter pan. I like both results--for the shallower tart pan I reduce the oven temp by 25 degrees and keep an eye on the custard for the final fifteen minutes of baking; it doesn't take as long as the deeper pan. It's very hard to keep the crust from slumping in the deeper pan, but once the shell is filled you don't really notice that the crust has shrunk. My guests have always loved this tart.

Terrible recipe. The cooking time for the crust is too long. The custard separates. Just awful.

Great recipe! I rolled out the dough to avoid leaks and put the custard through a sieve before pouring into the dish. I had some custard left over so I placed it in ramekins in a water bath and baked along with the tart. Delicious! P.S. 2/3 cup juice = 3 limes.

This is a delicious recipe. But I've had mixed success in my 4 attempts. 1st time was great, but leftover custard. Crust was thick, tough, but still delish. Other times success varied on oven temp being too hot. Suggest rolling out crust dough btwn 2 pieces plastic wrap, then put into tart pan. Cut eggs to 5, cut cream to 3/4 c., and little less lime juice. Just about fits in 8" tart pan. Make sure oven temp isn't too hot!!

I agree with the disbelief on pan size--I had enough filling for two 8 1/2 in. pans! I was a little disappointed w/the crust; it seemed a bit dense for such a mild, creamy tart. I'd change the crust and make one larger tart from this recipie.

I made this tart twice - once as practice and I'm glad I did. The first time, I wasn't careful enough in getting the crust perfectly even and it split on the bottom, so filling leaked out. It didn't look pretty, but it tasted so good and was easy enough to make that I gave it another try for company. It was a huge hit. Just the thing to top off a heavy meal on a lighter, citrus note. It will be perfect for this year's Easter brunch.

How on earth did they come up with a 8in 2in deep tart pan!? We used a larger more shallow pan and the tart set up well. The flavor and the look were great.

I was wary of this recipe initially because every other custard recipe I've seen uses the yolks only, not whole eggs. My results were more like a lime quiche than a nice, silky custard. Others have obviously made this successfully, but I wasted time and effort without achieving a dessert I could serve.

This was easy to prepare. I used 3/4 cup of bottled Key Lime juice instead of fresh limes. Also used a few spoons full of Fresh Whipped Cream on the side to cut the tartness of the flavor.

I gave this four forks because it was not only very flavorful and easy, it is light, refreshing and has a nice presentaion. I think the previous reviewer may be somewhat of a novice with tart or custards. I find they always take more time in the oven. I made this for Christmas Day 2002 and eveyone raved. It can be made ahead and it keeps well.

I just read the other four forks review and I'm glad they were successful. Mine was a diaster. First the crust was too soft, although it went in the pan nicely and after 30 minutes was solid, however, I should have done what the lady who doubled the recipe did. Increase the amount of dough. It was too thin and burnt. Secondly, the filling was very loose and although I followed the directions to the letter. It stil spilt some. But It also curdled. I had my oven set at 350 for the crust and lowered it to 300 for the filling. I even waited until it reached that temperature to insure it would not be too high. I'm quite disappointed. The filling leaked through the dough and burnt. I'm not a new cook and this is not the first time I baked a tart of custard tart. sorry, I would not attempt it again.

This is one the of best desserts that I have made over the years. The second time, I made it with lemon instead of lime because the lime was really too tart. I also changed the crust to a graham cracker crust which is a good complement to lemon. If you use the graham cracker crust, bake the crust by itself first or it will float up into the pie. My husband loved it like that, but it would look prettier if the crust stays put. This is much much better than lemon meringue pie.

Easy to make, creamy balance of tart and sweet. Excellent, easy crust. Note the recipe's instructions on filling the crust, it's clever and necessary! I would make this again. I followed the custard recipe exactly. For the crust, here's what I did: The recipe specifies an 8-inch tart pan that is 2 inches deep. Mine is 9 1/2 inches in diameter at the bottom, flaring to 10 1/2 inches in diameter at the top and is 2 inches deep. I increased the crust ingredients by 50% so that I would have more than enough for the pan and I'm glad I did. In the picture it looks as if the tart and crust come right up to the top of the pan, and even with my larger-volume pan this tart was FULL!
