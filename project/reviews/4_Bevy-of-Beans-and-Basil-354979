Definitely a keeper! Light and fresh, great for summer meals when all the beans are in season. I used fresh favas and home-grown green beans, basil and lemons. Both Romano and wax beans would be a tasty and pretty addition, as would dragon beans or purple varieties of bush beans. The only disadvantage is that shelling and then peeling favas is time consuming; however, shelled frozen favas or the edamame suggested in the recipe would not detract from the fantastic flavors at all. This will be a new staple recipe.

excellent, I only had green and edamane and it was very good.

Because I couldn't find Romano or fava beans, I used green, wax, and edamame. It was very good, but I'd like to find the other kinds of beans if I make it again.

My grocery store had no Romano beans, so I went with edamame, green beans, and blanched asparagus cut into small pieces. It was very good.

I won't rate this recipe, as all I had were green beans - but, the flavors were very nice.

So good!! I used fava and edamame and extra basil b/c I have so much in the garden. Delicious and easy, very forgiving!

This was good warm as a side dish, and good cold as a salad I could pack for lunch. I had homemade basil pesto in my fridge, so I used a small dollop of that since there is so much overlap in the ingredients. It was tasty!
