Yes, it can be high in calories but I make it with Chicken Chorizo, non-fat Yogurt and 2% cheese. It is still delicious and has been a big hit every time.

It's a very rich moist cornbread, don't expect a sweet light bread. The deal breaker for me was the calories, not worth it in my mind. I'm not looking for low-cal but this type of decadence needs to be really good.

Much simpler than many other chorizo cornbread recipes, but still very yummy. I made it vegetarian by using Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo and it turned out great!

The cornbread that eats more like a meal. I used canned green chiles which worked fine. My 19 year old son didn't like at all. I think I'll stick with my original family favorite cornbread.

Delicious. After reading through the other reviews I bumped up the heat to 365, and baked it for about 48 minutes at that heat. I also did it in a cast-iron pan (the same that I used to fry the chorizo in, and used that fat to grease the pan instead of butter), which seemed to put a nice crust on the outside rim. I cut it about 10 minutes after it came out of the oven, and let the pieces cool on racks individually, rather than in the pan. It dried it up some, and made it a more familiar cornbread consistency, while still retaining the moisture in the middle. I also used sour cream instead of yogurt.

Actually, to amend my other review - I did notice that my oven was a little hot (more like 375) when it was cooking, so I wonder if that helped make the cornbread more bread-y. Just a thought.

This is the best cornbread I have ever had -- and I grew up in the South so I know cornbread! I don't know why some other reviewers said this wasn't breadlike or that you need to add flour -- I followed the recipe exactly (though I baked it in a glass 11.5 x 7.5 baking dish) and it was certainly a bread. It's just a really, really moist bread. And the chilis and chorizo -- to die for!

This recipe is so insane. I made it with the Memphis Style Ribs on this site and it rocked.

I made this because of the wonderful reviews. I made it exactly like the recipe and it was good. It wasn't spectular but it was good. Went great with chili

I veganized this recipe and was tremendously pleased. It seemed like more of a casserole than a bread when it went in the oven but came out great! Veganized: 4 yves breakfast patties, chopped and sauteed in apricot oil in place of sausage. firm tofu 1 cup, crumbled in place of eggs tofutti sour cream vegan gourmet chedder cheese, grated. Definitely making this again! I also used southwest corn ( a blend w/ black beans, and peppers) and canned diced chili peppers in place of fresh.

Did no one else notice that it was extremely moist...like almost liquid-y? I cooked it for well beyond the 55 minutes recommended, and actually left it in another hour. It still never cooked. Then I realized that this recipe only called for corn meal...no flour. I tried adding a cup of flour and it worked wonderfully. I recommend that!

Oh. My. God. If you have not tried this, you are missing out on an otherworldly experience. Made a pan as a side dish and it was wolfed down before anything else!

My intention was to make a more bread-like cornbread, and when I realized it was going to be a little on the mushy side, I didn't think I would like it. But it was very, very good. Four forks.

I roasted a large poblano and used crumbled fried breakfast sausage instead of the chorizo. I cooked it in a large springform pan. Delicious.

p.s. I did not fire roast the anaheim chilies... I just put them at 500F in my toaster oven until they were a bit blackened. Pierce them with a fork, as they do pop open as they heat up.

This was excellent served with Emeril's veggie chili! They went perfectly together, and everyone went for seconds! FYI, the cornbread came out a bit spicy. Also, my friend accidentally used my regular corn instead of creamed corn, so I just added 2 more tablespoons of yogurt and it came out fine. Got rave reviews - thanks!

This may be one of the best cornbread recipes I have ever tried.

Can be made with ham rather than chorizo. Could add onion, other vegs to create a one dish meal. Serve w/salsa.

This recipe was very good. I used the can of green chiles and the jalepeno when I made it and it had the right amount of kick to it. It is also good reheated like another reviewer said.

Sublime! I would give it five forks. I followed the recipe to the letter, except that I used just 1/4 cup cheese. I baked the corn bread in a Springform pan, which was extremely easy to remove and made for a nice presentation.

we didn't have the chorizo or the anaheim peppers, so we made it without those and the jalapenos and it turned out great. very delicious!

Very moist and flavorful. Made it with chicken sausage (sweet) instead of chorizo and was still very good. Served with smoked turkey and sweet potatoes for Xmas dinner. YES!

YumYum!!! Good accompaniment to beef filet. Didn't have Anaheim peppers, so used roasted Hatch chiles and a jalepeno - perfect level of heat.

I made this as a side dish with chili, it turned out delicous!We liked it more than the chili! Will definitely make again.

I'm not sure why an earlier reviewer had problems reheating, I popped it back in the oven at 300 for 7-10 mins and it reheated fine. I made this along with gumbo and although everyone liked the gumbo, this was the real hit.

Very good. In a hurry and didn't have time to fire roast Anaheim peppers so used 1 jalapeno finely chopped and an 8 oz can of chopped green chiles. Turned out great. Used as a side dish for brisket. Everyone loved it. Will definitely make again and will use the roasted peppers.

This cornbread was the moistest I have ever tasted. It was a huge hit and went well with the chili we served. Hint: If you have leftovers, make sure to refrigerate or the chorizo will go bad.

Wonderful the day it was made. It lost a lot of flavor, however, the next day and did not reheat well.
