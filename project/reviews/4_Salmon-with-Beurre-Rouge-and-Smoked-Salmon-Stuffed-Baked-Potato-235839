As others have said, the sauce was no great shakes, but the potatoes were wonderful and the poached salmon was nice and light with them. Not too difficult and a lovely presentation.

I only made the baked potatoes with smoked salmon which were devine! I skipped the foil wrapping part and baked the potatoes "naked" and they turned out beautifully. I also used half and half instead of milk because that's what was on hand. I might skip the butter next time to lighten the calories, but it's perfect as is. A couple dashes of hot sauce really put it over the top for me. I served these with a light salad and both my husband and I were satisfied. Enjoy!

SO good! I made a whole potato for each of us and it was filling to say the least. Maybe buy 12 ounce potatoes to split but 4 ounce potato per person sounded really skimpy. The Beurre Rouge is good but not the highlight. The salmon is melt in you mouth fabulous!

The salmon itself was quite good, though the sauce did not add much, and I am not convinced it's worth the calories--just very mild and buttery. The potatoes were outstanding--as I am a klutz I managed to slice the potato skins making it hard to use them, so I put the mashed potatoes into custard cups instead which worked great and was a nice presentation. Overall, four stars for the potatoes and two stars for the salmon.

The twice-baked potatoes in this menu were delicious--they make a stand-alone meal by themselves, and freeze nicely. The beurre rouge was also delicious, but the two salmon dishes together are intensely rich, leaving little room for dessert!

Definitely, the recipe was easy, but I thought the sauce needed something - it was pretty basic. The potatoes are delish though, and this form of doing the salmon, including the fingerling cut, was perfect.

This recipe was surprisingly easy despite it's gourmet taste.

I loved the flavour of the "poached" salmon and, although I am told I am a good cook, I've never done fish this way in just a tiny bit of water. I will never go back to other methods (except maybe poaching in wine). I used some bits of smoked bbq salmon tips in the potatoes and maybe not as glamourous as smoked salmon but worked very well. Also, the sauce reduced very quickly and was down to almost nothing but I whisked the butter in and it was pefect anyway. I will definitely make this again.

Really excellent. I made the sauce with Marsala wine and a bit of balsamic vinaigrette and was very pleased with the results. The potatoes (which I made without the smoked salmon) are actually more time-consuming than the salmon filets, but really phenomenal.

Absolutely eye-crossing and pleasurable. The sauce for the fish is divine, and the baked potatoes are outrageously sumptuous. Everyone should make this meal & enjoy it.

The sauce on the fish was absolutely amazing. I made the potatoes without the smoked salmon, but did the same with that exception and they were yummy too. This is my new favorite salmon recipe!

A really great dish, but a bit difficult to finish the buerre rouge and assemble all of the components without the help of a crew of line cooks that you might find in Le Bernardin. For diners who are averse to raw green onions or chives I used rinsed and chopped capers and green olives. The steamed/poached fresh salmon and the smoked salmon were excellent against each other,

I regularly serve salmon up for dinner and always look for something new. This quite possibly is the best tasting salmon dinner I've ever made, and quite easy. It took much longer than the 3 minutes the recipe states for the shallot sauce to reduce (maybe closer to 10-12 min), but oh ho HO, was it worth the wait. I've never poached salmon before, and never prepared it without the use of butter or oils, so I was leary but very pleased with the end product. I'm glad I didn't mess with it while it was poaching (I almost threw in some butter). It was absolutely perfect, melt-in-your-mouth tender, and surprisingly full of flavor for just using salt and pepper. However, I was using Copper River Salmon which probably played moderately into the exceptional flavor. The potatoes were also good, but I felt something was missing, more butter perhaps? Or maybe to me, it was a clash in tastes between the fresh poached and the smoked. I may end up omitting the smoked salmon from the potatoes next time. I look forward to making this again VERY soon.

I baked my potatoes at 400 degrees instead of 40 and they turned out great. The family cleaned their plates.

I maded this dish (as written) for a birthday dinner party and everyone raved. Well worth the effort.

My wife (who is a fussy eater, but loves salmon) absolutely loved this! I loved the reduction and it was paired well with the potatos. Would definately make this again.
