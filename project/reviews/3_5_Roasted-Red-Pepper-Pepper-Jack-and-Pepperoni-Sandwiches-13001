Used the peppers out of our garden and roasted them. Cheated a little by toasting the bread, then putting the completed sandwich in the microwave to melt the cheese. Extra quick and delish!

This sandwich is so good. I'm not a big fan of coriander but it does add to the sandwich. All I can say is yummy.:-)

This was an excellent recipe, very good and zesty. Although the next time I make it I plan on toning down the coriander sprigs. It's a bit overpowering for my personal tastes.

WE LOVED THIS SANDWICH! Bless the brilliance behind this one. We roasted our peppers on the bbq grill first; then prepared the recipe per instructions; and actually finished it on the grill. Very easy to prepare and so delicious.
