This was a little different, but I sure wouldn't bother with it again. The pepper butter took a long time to make, & just wasn't worth the effort-it wasn't that good or different! I don't understand all the glowing reports on this recipe. If you do make it, be aware that the peppercorns do NOT grind up very well in the bowl of a food processor, as other cooks have noted. I ground & ground, but really think the bowl was too big for the amount of stuff in it. I ended up putting it in a small coffee grinder I keep for grinding spices. It still took a lot of grinding & scraping to finally get all the peppercorns ground up.

my food processor didn't do too well grinding the pepper. i think i should have left the butter out and grind everything, then add the butter to mix; or grind the peppercorns before simmering them. i still enjoyed this, i don't mind eating whole peppercorns but my husband prefers them ground. i didn't have brandy so i used burgundy.

While I love epicurious, I did not love this particular recipe. I paired the potatoes with the Steak with Shallot-Merlot Sauce recipe and Goat Cheese Salad. Both of the other recipes were four forks for me, but I felt that the amount of time required to prepare the potatoes was out of proportion to their flavor. For me, too much time for too subtle a flavor.

Outstanding. This time we used red wine instead of brandy, with equally good results and one tablespoon peppercorn instead of two, simply because that was on hand. One of the best potatoe recipes on the site. Excellent on the pork roast as well. The lemon added a bright note, and the thyme was perfect.

I agree with Russ and Detroit. These potatoes were okay, but there are so many other potato recipes that are better.

i really enjoyed this butter, thought the freshness of the lemon was a nice contrast to the dark flavor of the pepper/brandy. i will make this again, but maybe use more thyme, or less pepper if serving to people who aren't into spicey.

I agree with the previous review. While this recipe was okay, there are others out there for roasted potatoes that are less complicated and better tasting.

I am honestly surprised at all the four fork reviews. I thought it was okay, but not spectacular. I made sure to freeze the leftover butter for a future use.

Not only was this great on new potatoes, but the guests started puting it on the pork roast, as well (I served some on the side).

Really yummy potatoes! They could not have been better!

We made this tonight to put on some filet mignon. It was fabulous, we loved it as is. That said, next time I am going to experiment with extra brandy and maybe balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice. The lemon was great on the beef, but when I dipped our roasted potatoes in the butter I found the lemon a bit too much.

My Son made this one for my birthday! Awsome... He left out the brandy. I recommended to him.. quarter the potatoes before the cooking for shorter cooking time. The rest was great. Definately keeping this one.

Good potato dish. I served it with citrus grilled salmon and a Pinot Noir. I was hoping for a tad more brandy flavor, so I'd try a 1/3 cup next time around. Use a food processor as instructed to blend the reduction. I used a blender instead and it left whole peppercorns behind. Set a timer when reducing as mixture will boil out if you're not watching closely. I learned the hard way.

This recipe was awesome. It really wowed my friends. I keep the butter on hand for all kinds of vegetables. It is awesome with artichokes.

Not only will we make this again we will also make the butter for other things like steak and pork chops on the grill. Made butter and chopped onions the day before serving then forgot to add the onions. But the potatoes were still good.

WOW. This is great, really great. A little of this butter goes a long way for those of you concerned with fat. I used vodka instead of brandy because that's all I had. The results were probably not as rich but savory and satisfying. These are definitely company quality potatoes. The leftover butter was fantastic spread on grilled steaks the next day. Do yourself a favor, take the time to try this recipe.

I made this for Christmas Dinner and the flavors are wonderful. It does take some time to make but you end up with lots of peppercorn butter which hopefully will keep in the frig for awhile. I would definetly make this again! Very tasty (excellent with prime rib!).

I have not yet made this, but my friend who is an excellent cook & used to have her own catering business (and doesn't have a computer) tells me it is incredibly wonderful!
