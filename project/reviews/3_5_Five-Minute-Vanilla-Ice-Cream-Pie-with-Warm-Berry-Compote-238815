Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, and then added it in with vanilla ice cream instead of the pie crust. It was a hit!

This was so easy, big hit with kids - let them put ice cream toppings on their slices. Great summer dessert

I can't say enough good things about this recipe. I freeze extra and can pull it out for a last minute treat. I rarely make the pie, the berry compote is delicous just over the ice cream!

Fantastic recipe. Easy and Good.

My family and I just loved this! Real cooks, and real people, are as happy with a simple, unpretentious dessert as we are with one that takes hours to make. And making it precious doesn't make it a bit better. Maybe with the economy failing more pretentious wanna-be cooks will be enjoying "low rent" recipes like this one!

This was so easy and delicious. I did use low-fat frozen yogurt in an attempt to make it lower in calories. It was just fine. I am a fan of full- fat ice cream so I was surprised I liked it. Made it for company and it was a big hit.

Really great recipe for a dinner party - I made this the night before, and made the berry compote (using frozen berries) minutes before serving it. Super easy to make, and so delicious for a summer dessert. My friend said this is now on the top of her favorite dessert list! My grocery store didn't have graham cracker or chocolate pie crust, so I just used regular frozen pie crust and cooked it for 10-15 minutes before filling it with ice cream. I'll definitely make this one again!

Made this recently with a few more "homemade" touches: made my own chocolate cookie pie crust, melted good-quality chocolate on top of crust, chilled it, then followed the recipe. I subbed chocolate sauce from a local gourmet shop for the syrup, and used just regular vanilla ice cream. Guests loved it. Next time, I might strain the berry compote to make more of a coulis sauce. Great dessert option for a patio dinner party where you've got too many other moving pieces to worry about an elaborate dessert. Simple does not necessarily mean low-brow!

People at my party went nuts when they found out I made the ice cream pie. For the little effort it took, it was tasty and impressive.

The fruit sauce was amazing and simple but filling the pie with ice cream was quite a pain and despite using a very expensive ice cream, boring in the end. Save yourself the headache and just serve the fruit over scooped ice cream

Served this easy dessert at a summer dinner party and it was gobbled up in minutes without leaving a single bite on anyone's plate. I used store-bought butter-toffee almonds to sprinkle on top. Everyone loved it! Made it again this week with the same results.

Filling the crust with ice cream is a lot harder than it looks, and when you serve it, the ice cream is really hard to cut and not that exciting.

This was easy and really good. I am making again with a raspberry- chocolate chip ice cream and just the raspberries. Should be quite tasty.

Yes, this was a quick and easy dessert, but I thought that it was also entirely unremarkable.

It was good but like a lot of the recipes ive tried nothing about it really stood out.

I can't rate it because I haven't made it, but it sounds like a fun thing for a kid's party. It's not fancy or "gourmet", unless, as pixelvisio says, you make your own icecream; you could even make your own chocolate sauce, why not? Lighten up a little!

New Zealand, you have a point - too unsophisticated, huh? Sounds like Simple & Semi-homemade Sandra Lee's handiwork. However, my focus is often on the rest of my dinner, so I appreciate an easy dessert. If if makes you feel better, make your own vanilla ice cream. I do & my guests are impressed.

I made this last night for Father's Day. What a great dessert. I used light ice cream and frozen mixed berries instead. Easy and delicious!
