I have also added any other peppers I may have that need to go. Pepperonchini with some of liquid from the jar at the begining if I want it spicier. Also add raisins and chopped olives towards the end.

This is really divine. I slice onions and peppers superfine with a mandolin and cook them at the lowest heat possible for 1 hour. Twenty mins. before the end I add 1 medium pureed garlic clove, a bit of dry rosemary and some salt. At the very end I add 2 Tbs balsamic instead of one. Great with lamb!

I made this recipe substituting sliced summer squash for one of the peppers and then tossed it with pasta and cubed fresh mozzarella to make a meal. Delicious! Our whole family loved it.

Followed this closely, and the result was exactly what I'd intended, like the peperonata I've had at Sicilian restaurants. Delicious as an appetizer served on crostini. I garnished it with shredded fresh basil leaves.

Mmmmmm. Served at a dinner party with salami, cheeses and olives. Followed recipe as written with the exception of more balsamic.
