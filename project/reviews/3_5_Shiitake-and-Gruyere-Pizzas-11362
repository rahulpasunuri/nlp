This tasted pretty good. I used Pillsbury pizza dough instead of making the dough like in the directions. I think the directions are crazy too, saying to cook them at 500 degrees for 15 minutes on the bottom level of the oven. My first batch of pizzas got extremely burned following those directions. I had to move the pizzas to the middle of the oven and only cook them for 8 minutes.

Great Pizza!! Instead of making my own crust, I used Trader Joe's whole wheat refrigerated dough. I used 4oz of shiitake mushrooms and 8oz of cremini mushrooms. I also added cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper to the mushroom mixture to add a little more flavor.

Shitake stems aren't edible..use them in stock. Excellent pizza, btw

it does seem to be wasteful, but almost any recipe tells you to discard the shiitake stems -- they're just too woody and unpleasant in many recipes. if it really bothers you, save the stems for a mushroom or vegetable stock.

My frugal nature is somehow offended by the cavalier command to discard the stems of what is here in Illinois anyway, a fairly expensive ingredient: shitake mushrooms.
