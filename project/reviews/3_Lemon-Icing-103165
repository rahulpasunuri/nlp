I really liked this recipe. It is as what someone else said..more of a glaze than icing and that was just what I wanted for my Sour Cream Lemon Pound Cake.

I made this to drizzle over the lemon-nutmeg shortbread cookies... I think this was just a bit too lemony for my taste, although the consistency of the icing was a great topper for the cookies.

this was good but isn't this a glaze rather than an icing? I dribble this over my dutch apple pies. yum yum!

I laced this over the carrot bread recipe from mimiscafe.com, which I made as a bundt cake. Fit the bill nicely. I never made icing before, so I appreciate the simplicity.
