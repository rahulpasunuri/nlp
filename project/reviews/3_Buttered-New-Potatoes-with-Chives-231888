I absolutely love buttered new potatoes with chives, however...I always melt the butter in a saucepan with the chives. It brings out the flavor in the chives. I don't use as much butter, and sometimes it is nice to add greek yogurt to the mix to make them creamy.

These potatoes had no flavor. They were bland and boring, not worth the carbs or calories.
