I was so excited to find this recipe after having a grilled calamari with Ginger at an upscale Japanese restaurant. I was however, extremely disappointed. It was almost bitter, and did not look that appealing either. I will never try this recipe again. Bummer!

Even though I gave 3 forks, I think it corresponds closer to 2 forks, which is defined as good. This is a recipe that literally takes about 5 minutes to make (I bought cleaned squid, so no time loss there). This is super easy and fairly tasty. Nothing earth shattering, but a good, very simple recipe when you need something fast.
