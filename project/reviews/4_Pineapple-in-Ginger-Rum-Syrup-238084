I followed previous advice and increased quantities of sugar, ginger and rum by about 50%. I also added 1tsp of cinnamon. It took a long time to reduce the syrup--at least 30mins. Note that the recipe is for 10 servings. If it is just to accompany another dish, you would probably halve it.

Very easy and good - my dinner guests loved it. I would add a bit more ginger and rum the next time. I served it with a simple butter cake - sort of a deconstructed pineapple upside down cake. And for my friend with wheat and dairy allergies, I served it over vanilla ice cream made from coconut milk.

User-friendly...simple...easy and just different enough for people to ask: what's in there? The ginger is the secret ingredient. I added maraschino cherries for color.This dessert could go with savory, but it is definitely good as is. I served it with a side of spice cake.

Serve with the ham recipe from the southern accents article, instead of as a dessert - fabulous.
