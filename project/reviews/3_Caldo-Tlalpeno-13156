Very easy to make and comforting. We had this at a restaurant and decided to make it at home. The recipe was too bland, though. It needs some fresh garlic added to the stock, as well as extra heat (cayenne pepper). Other than that, it was fine. A pound of boneless/skinless chicken breasts would be plenty.

read well the recipe...its only 2 chilis, not 2 cans of chili! Yummy!!

I skipped the saute step, adding the vegetables directly to the broth, before returning the shredded chicken. It was really delicious, especially the next day, and reminded me of homemade soups I've had in Mexican homes.

a staple at our house, only thing we change is leaving out the beans, just because we don't really care for them. It substitutes the "normal" chicken soup for the adults in this family, even as a Get Well Soup. There is always a portion in the freezer.

This soup was rather lacking in originality and some sense of continuity between the various ingredients. I adore soup and I am not picky about soup, however, the chipotle totally overwhelmed the originally bland soup. I love the smoky taste of chipotle peppers, but this just didn't work out for me. P.S. To the reviewer that complained it was too spicy-- you're only suppoed to use a few TABLESPOONS, not two cans! Two cans would definately melt your lips off.

Wow. This was too spicy! (And I love spicy! - but this made my lips swell!) Too much chili to be tasty. How big should those cans of chipolte peppers be? I must have used WAY too much. Ouch. I will make this again - but with major modifications to the chili content.

If you've ever been to the Tlalpan Market and had the "caldo" sold there you could close your eyes with every spoonful and return to this magical place in Mexico City.

Delicious and quick to prepare I used two onions and increased the peppers, too. I didn't use the avocado but added a little rice which cooked with the soup and made it more substantial.

This was a wonderful and easy chicken soup recipe. I doubled the recipe and added an extra onion and chipotle pepper. The lime and avocado were great garnishes although the soup was excellent without them (you might want to taste the soup before the lime -- I think it has a great taste without it as well).

This is also an excellent soup to add fried tortilla strips to and call it whatever you want. A true family pleaser, me specially.
