I was very disappointed with the outcome. The first steps (i.e., cutting and rolling the meat) were awkward and did not work well. I was very disappointed at the sauce as well: I think the artichokes gave it an unappealing texture. I've made much better carpaccio more simply: lemon and olive oil, along with peppercorns is a much better sauce.

This was very easy to prepare, and very tasty. I made a variation of the recipe with Salmon, and used capers and a little bit of the juice they were packaged with instead of the artichoke hearts. It was a hit with everyone.

This was my first attempt at making carpaccio, and while my husband and I loved it, I will practice a few more times before serving to guests. The trick is in the rolling; be sure to leave more than three inches in between each piece as you'll want to roll it out as thin and evenly as you can get it.

Great dish, nice balance of flavours,try coating the fillet in meaux mustard then rolling in cracked pepper,then sealing the meat off in a very hot pan before wrapping and freezing. enjoy :)
