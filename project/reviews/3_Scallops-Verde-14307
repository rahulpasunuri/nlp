I made this as a first course for a dinner party. It was everyone's favorite, and many have since made it. I used fresh homemade pesto, which makes a difference.

Guests raved about this recipe, although I frankly thought it needed a bit more salt. (But then, most guests sprinkled extra Parmesan on top; I didn't.) There are not enough scallops in this recipe; when I doubled the quantity to serve nine, I tripled the scallops. If I'd had more people to serve, I'd have added yet another pound of scallops, without increasing anything else.

I soaked the scallops in cold soda water with a table spoon of sea salt for about an hour: drained the soda water off and then soaked the scallops in a mixture of lemon and lime juice for about 20 minutes before the saute: for the tomatoes use the best you can buy: it works

This dish is fabulous, very rich. It's great with a salad. And if you don't like scallops, use chicken or shrimp. Yum!

The only reason I finished eating this was because I felt it was a waste to throw out the expensive ingredients. The sauce was sloppy and looked curdled, and I would've been much happier with the plain, store-bought pesto. Never again.

I agree that the sauce is not appropriate for scallops but is a family favorite when made with chicken. I use two boneless skinless chicken breasts, halved length-wise and thinly sliced. I saute slices in 2T of oil instead of 1 until they are cooked and lightly browned. Then proceed with recipe as called for. This dish gets rave reviews everytime I make it for company and constant requests for the recipe. Note: DO NOT use oil packed tomatoes. I tried that in a pinch and it was a flop.

sauce was definitely too strong for the scallops.

the sauce was a mess a thick sauce on scallops hides to much of the flavor , and maybe if you sauteed the scallops then add some fresh chopped tomato into the sautee with the scallops then add the fresh pesto at the end I believe that might be a little lighter and a tad more apitizing.

I used fresh pesto and agree with others-too rich and overpowering for scallops plus adding the tomatoes,etc turns the sauce into a mucky color that is not anything close to verde. My husband took my copy of the recipe to the shredder so I would not mistakenly make this recipe again.

This recipe is a family favorite! Since my husband is not fond of scallops, I have used shrimp and even thinly sliced chicken breast meat. It is delicious and easy to prepare.

I usually trust epicurious.com. This was by far the worst recipe I've ever seen on the site. The combination of cream, pesto, sundried tomatoes and scallops made for a gluey mishmash of bad flavors. It was so disgusting we threw it out and ordered a pizza.

A little too rich, but the flavor was incredible. I suggest using a little less cream or it becomes too rich.

I don't know what I did wrong, but this was a disaster. The sauce was way too strong and overpowering for the scallops. I'll look for another recipe. YUK!

Big hit with seafood lovers in family. Used combination of scallops, shrimp and chicken breast. Used only 1.5 oz tomatoes. Used extra homemade pesto, cheese and heavy cream. (How can you go wrong?) Used 3+ tb shallots and 1 1/2 cups wine - reduced to about 1/4th cup.

This was very tasty, but I am partial to pesto. I used my own home-made frozen pesto, and used 3/4 cup of pesto. I also think this would be good vegetarian, with chicken or shrimp

I agree with the others that this is a GREAT sauce (I wouldn't change a thing) but definitely will substitute with chicken or shrimp in the future. I classify the sauce as "fine yet hearty" and scallops are much too delicate for such a robust sauce.

I've made this recipe twice now and have given it to my friends. I think the scallops are great , but you could substitute chicken or shrimp for a different flavour. Some people find the sun-dried tomatoes a little much. It's fast and easy and great if you want to impress somebody important!

The sauce is delicious, but the scallops are wasted in this recipe. I agree with a previous contributor, use less expensive chicken breasts instead, or just settle for the pasta for a great vegetarian dish.

I love this dish and so does anyone I have ever prepared it for...people ALWAYS want the recipe.There are NEVER ANY leftovers. I add shrimp to mine instead of using all scallops.

I thought this dish was delicious. We had enough for unexpected company and they were very impressed.

Very good but scallops kind of lost in pesto sauce. May be better with grilled chicken breast instead. 3oz tomatoes plenty and would consider 2oz next time. Dash of cayenne gave it a little zip also. Easy to make but not a show stopper if considering for company.

Excellent recipe, very easy to make, and we thought this could be made a little ahead, in order to enjoy appetizers, ( we will try this next time). There were no leftovers!!!!!
