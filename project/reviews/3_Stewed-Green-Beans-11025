I haven't made this recipe before, however, it does remind me of another recipe that I have found on Epicurious and enjoy very much.

This recipe was OK. I've made many tomatoes and onions-types of mixtures before, so adding green beans didn't really create much of a surprise this time. It could also be due to the fact that I used canned green beans and not fresh ones. But I will definitely recommend cutting down on cooking time. Quickly stew the green beans and onions, put in the tomatoes and lemon juice, heat through, and that's it. I don't see the need for all those evaporation procedures, which just made for mushy, overcooked veggies.

Nice, quick side dish. I also used canned diced tomatoes, and just threw them in with juice and all. The beans were delicious, and the lemon really brightens the flavour.

This was a really nice change from plain steamed green beans. I substituted Diced canned tomatoes for the fresh Roma tomatoes (because I didn't have any on hand) with great results. The colors looked so nice on the plate, and the lemon juice enhanced the flavor wonderfully without being overpowering. I would absolutely recommend this dish to anyone!
