I cannot review this recipe as a whole because I didn't make the oatmeal crust (I was feeding it to someone with multiple food allergies so I used a regular type vegan pie crust). I was a little disappointed in the filling though, it was sweeter than I would have liked and all I could taste was the blueberries, the other berries just faded into the background. The citrus added a really nice twist to the berry pie though. In general, although this wasn't my favorite that is to be expected because I'm not a fan of blueberries but the guests that I fed this to really, really like it and everyone had seconds.

This pie was gorgeous and tasted amazingly wonderful! My family declared it the best pie I have made and I have made many, many pies. I found the crust to be perfect, easy to work with and making the lattice was a lot easier than I thought. I did use only blueberries (4-5 cups is enough), no preserves, lemon zest in the filling and crust. I would make this pie with many different fruit fillings.

This pie is easy as can be and to die for. It lends itself well to variation; last time I used only blueberries and simmered them with orange peel and orange juice; this time (a huge hit) I used all three berries, simmering them at low for about twenty minutes, added about a quarter cup of orange juice, and splashed in two Tbsp. aged balsamic. The citrus in here, and the lovely light crust, are what make this more than just any old pie.

I made this for Thanksgiving. I used frozen berries and upped the corn starch to 3T to compensate for the extra water. It was excellant! Everyone was so full but they all raved about the pie. I actally like it better cold than at room temp.

Very good. Crust is delicious! Used all blueberries(5C), and no jam. Used 1/2 cornstarch & 1/2 flour (2TBL each). Used less sugar, but should have used more. Don't think that I'd pre-bake shell, because ends really started to burn, and center barely bubbled, but took out anyway. Filling not watery - just right.

This is a delicious pie ! The dough needed an additional teaspoon of ice water/yolk to bind it better. Also, putting the lattice together without breaking the strips is challenging but worth the pretty presentation. I was surprised how much I liked the mixed berry filling that had blueberry preserves as part of the ingredients. As other reviewers stated, the citrus in the crust and filling, adds just the right amount of bite to the taste.

Fabulous!Every one of my guests raved over this pie. I had to use frozen berries instead of fresh but everything still turned out wonderful. The pastry dough can be challenging to work with. I suggest making sure your work surface and rolling pin are extremely cold to keep the dough from warming up too much.

This is one of the best pies I've ever had the pleasure of putting together! I have the hard copy of the issue this pie was featured in, so I've been baking it for a few years now. The crust is delicious and holds together well. The filling is "to die for!" This is a great pie for a 4th of July BBQ and I usually end up making three pies because it goes quick!

I can't bake!!! This pie was easy to make and was one of the best pies I've ever eaten.

This pie has the perfect balance for a mixed berry taste! It is sweet yet the hint of citrus balances the taste so that it is not too sweet. The crust on the other hand..somewhat of a disaster. Make sure you have extra water on hand for the dough. It came out great but overall, the crust was difficult to work with. I think that the oatmeal makes it difficult, but it is worth extra effort!

This pie was better than any berry pie I have ever tasted! The citrus comes through in every bite, but gently. Beautiful!!!!

Maybe I did something wrong--this crust was a disaster. When I rolled the bottom crust, it cracked--big hint! I managed to repair it, but there was no way to make a lattice with it. Every strip I bent back cracked. I ended up throwing the dough away and baked the pie open-faced (I had guests arriving in a few hours and didn't have much choice) I decorated the top with some nectarine slices, fresh fuit and glaze and the dessert was a huge success. The filling was wonderful--it gets highest rating, the crust gets a big ZERO.

Though the woven crust is a bit time-consuming, this pie creates an impressive centerpiece for outdoor parties. If you don't want a strong lemon flavor, use 1 1/2 -2 tsp. lemon zest. Add vanilla ice cream for a real summery treat.
