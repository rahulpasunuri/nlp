While good, this prep is lacking something- not quite sure what. Maybe will try adding the cucumbers like someone else suggested. Depth of flavor just isn't there. Will try again tho- the tomatoes were yummy and husband liked it so right there it's a keeper.

Really good! I roasted the tomatoes, and they were really good. I also soaked the onion in cold water while the pasta was cooking to get rid of some of that raw flavour. I kinda think the salads would be good separate, however.

I love this salad. When it's just me, I dispense with the two-salads-in-one approach and mix it all up in one bowl, and it's just as good although not as visually arresting. I also like to add bite-sized pieces of fresh mozzarella; I also tend to char the tomatoes in the broiler rather than on a grill.

While it was ok, this was not a hit; it's really two salads, one on top of the other. While each salad was pretty good, the flavors didn't seem to complement each other.

This was really great as a quick small dinner for me and my boyfriend (we had a huge lunch). The grilled tomatoes taste excellent! I added roasted red pepper and cucumber, because I had them on hand. Definitely recommend, its even better the next day.

Gotta say- This was great! My husband couldn't stop raving. Plus it's light and good for you. A definite repeat.

We broiled the tomatoes instead of grilling, and added 8 oz. of fresh mozzarella in small chunks--yum. The juice from the tomatoes adds to the dressing, and the pasta and beans soak it up delectably. I'll grill 'em next time.

It could use more olives, some feta, and a chopped cucumber - then it'd be a 4-forker. As is, I'll give it 3. A little cheese really goes a long way though - I added about 1/2 cup of feta, some capers, half a roasted red pepper, and a cucumber to this and served it with romaine salad greens. Tasty and light.

Yuk, Yuk, Yuk! The grilled tomatoes and pasta we're yummy, but the beans and parsley were awful! Threw most of it out - what a waste!

One of my summer favorites

Fabulous recipe - I have been asked to make it for many summer dinners. Grilling the tomatoes makes it really special.

Absolutely delicious!

Very good indeed. I'd marinate the whole thing for an hour or 2 before serving though, for better taste.

Not enough flavor for someone who has lost the sense of smell.

Served this salad to a group of seven. No-one liked it and 3/4 was tossed out.

A good, healthy, simple salad. I will make it again when I don't want to heat the kitchen.

This recipe is very simple and tasty. Good hot and cold. I did cook the garlic and onions before adding them to the recipe though. My children love it.

If I have time I'll roast the tomatoes next time, but fresh chopped tomotoes work fine. I also used whole wheat pasta for some extra nutrition. Tossed all together it's another great make-ahead summer salad. Small cubes of baked ricotta were complementary additions to the leftovers.

This dish made a delicious main course. We enjoyed the layer of flavors involving the grilled tomatos, kalamata olives and basil. We paired the salad with cold artichokes and bread sticks for a wonderful summer supper. The one drawback is the lingering raw onion flavor. Next time I'll micro-cook the onions until just translucent to reduce the bitter flavor hang-over. This was all-in-all a delicious surprise!

This is one terrific salad recipe. Definately will make it again. Everyone loved it, even the kids. Made enough for leftovers the next day, but they ate every bit. I'm curious as to how Nancy eliminated 4 basic ingredients, added 4 entirely different ingredients and then said she made "this" salad.

Made this salad with what I had available. Added grilled asparagus, red onion, summer squash and a roasted red pepper. Didn't have beans, basil, olives or parsley. This is a great summer salad alone with fresh bread or as a side dish. The grilled vegetables are great.

Excellent-However a TBS of fresh Oregano gives it a new dimension.

Wonderful. I am not a vegeterian, but do try to make non meat dishes a few times a week. For those that do not have a grill I have found that you can roast the tomatoes on a cookie sheet in your over. About 450º for 15 - 20 mins. Not the same as grilled but does add flavor.

Just ok. Looking at the ingredients I thought it would be better. Not terrible, but not too exciting either.

As a vegetarian, this recipe appealed greatly to me with its classic Italian flavors. However, I was shocked to discover that my entire meat-and-potato family practically devoured the entire bowl, a rare occurance in this household that usually turns its nose up to meatless dishes. Instead of serving the pasta and beans separately, I just threw it all in a big bowl as a pasta salad and it was great. I'll definitely be making this again in the near future.

This recipe is excellent! I did substitute some sun-dried tomatoes (not in oil) for the grilled tomatoes because I didn't want to fire up the grill.

This is a good side dish with grilled meats, etc. The macaroni is a nice alternative to potatoes. Vine ripened tomatoes were not yet available so I used a couple of cans of good quality chopped tomatoes. I am certain that grilled, fresh tomatoes will add more flavor. Rather than spoon the bean mixture over the macaroni, I mixed it all together. The flavors are enhanced with time.
