It's summer, so I used the barbecue to cook the burgers, yum! I added feta bits and sliced tomato to the pita and made a salad rather than put lettuce in. I added fresh dill to the tzatziki, and really loved the results. Great recipe! I did not find any need to spice up the burgers, though maybe the barbecuing covered the need for more flavor.

This might be the best dish ever. There are only a few of modifications I made. First, I added a tablespoon of dill to the yogurt sauce. Second, I didn't have parsley so I used green onions instead of the parsley and omitted the onion from the lamb pattie mix. Second, I topped everything with some crumbled feta...and YUMMO!! For my broiler, I cooked the patties for an additional two minutes. I would recommend checking them after 8 minutes (4 min on each side) and going from there. What a delicious meal. Definitely going to be added to my regular reportoire!

Frickin' yum. Part of my regular repertoire. I've made this with 1/2 lamb & 1/2 beef, or all lamb. Try it with fresh oregano in the burger - totally worth it. I have a crappy broiler so I tend to either panfry or grill-pan on the stove & then finish in the oven, which works fine. For the tzatziki I use Greek strained yogurt and prefer to grate rather than dice the cucumber, and I like to add chopped fresh dill. I also like to add a beaten egg to the meat to get it even juicier. It's just hard to go wrong with this one (unless you overcook the meat - lamb should be pink!).

Easy to make and absolutely delicious! Really, and my husband and I are serious about lamb...

Fantastic! Note, make the sauce over 4 hours in advance to let the onion mellow and the flavors meld. I also added chopped fresh mint and more garlic than called for. The burger patties were fantastic, but next time I think i'm going to do half beef to save some $$. Definetely going to make this again.

This is a favorite in our house. The lamb is such a great departure from ordinary hamburgers. I make my own tzatziki because this one does get a little watery, but the rest of my family enjoy them plain with lettuce and tomato. I tried them with turkey today and they were delicious, too.

Delicious -- didn't think it needed to be "kicked up" at all -- was great exactly as written. Even my picky kids liked it :)

The lamb (and sauce) definitely need more seasoning than what the recipe calls for. I added a minced jalapeno and minced red pepper (split between meat and sauce), and generally increased the amounts of garlic & seasoning. Cayenne, cumin, ginger, cilantro, mint all go well with this dish. Lemon is imperative for the sauce. I did not drain the yoghurt, and found it perfectly acceptable. It's amazing how good the sauce is, considering the lack of fat. After writing this review I've decided - I'm making this for dinner tonight. You should too!

These burgers definately need to be "kicked up" as a previous review suggested. Otherwise, its kinda a waste of good lamb.

Kick up the burgers: Add chopped onions,cilantro, grated fresh ginger,a serrano. Also cumin, coriander and cayenne. Kick up the sauce: Use goat or greek yogurt, GRATE the onion, cucumber (squeeze out liquid) and garlic, add chopped mint and dill.

Just used the lamb patties (beefteki in Greek) recipe. I used 400g of mince and more bread (don't worry if you don't have crumbles, just chop some bread and if you like, wet it with some water and squeeze out the excess), more garlic, more onion (!), paprika, cinnamon & lamb seasoning (dunno what's in it!). I made 8 little ones. I made them with the roasted potatoes with garlic, lemon & oregano (from this website) and served with mustard (for me), ketchup (for my bro) & lovely chicory, tomato & red pepper salad, with a dressing of olive oil, white wine vinegar, basil, salt & pepper. Oh, and some pitta bread to go with all that! Everyone was moaning & groaning over this.

The recipe was good as advertized. We used cilantro instead of parsley.

I'm a big fan of tzatziki sauce, and would love to work on this recipe again. Draining the yogurt is a good idea, letting the cucumbers sit for a bit as well could be useful, the sauce turned out a bit runnier than I'm used to. I used a bit of extra lemon as well - it tastes great with a bit more bite to it.

I have added 2 Tbl. finley chopped mint to the meat. As for a side dish I serve Taboule and a plate of feta cheese.

If you like garlic, do add more to the sauce, and drain the yogurt as the previous reviewer suggested (paper towels work for that). Next time I make this, I will also put the onions in the food processor first, to get a finer texture for them, I didn't so much care for the larger chunks I ended up with. This is a good, quick recipe though. Any ideas for go-withs?

To get he best tzatziki, the yogurt should drained overnight in the refrigerator (put the yogurt on a piece of cheesecloth, place them in a tupperware container and put the lid on. Pull the edges of the cheesecloth to suspend the yogurt so water can drain). This will produce a much creamier sauce and you may find you don't need to use additional spices depending on your palate

Add fresh mint to the yogurt sauce! You won't regret it. ;)

The sauce is good however I too added some olive oil and additional seasonings. It tasted like the sauce I have at the gyro place. Also, I used some leftover lamb loin chops sliced off the bone. I seasoned this and grilled onions and mushrooms with some oregano and garlic then I placed it in flatbread(I warmed in the skillet with olive oil) with monterey jack cheese. DELICIOUS LUNCH!

Add more garlic to the yogurt sauce -- In fact, I added a whole head of garlic, and my family loved it! Also add some olive oil

I like my old lebanese recipe better - lots of cinnamon, alspice and salt. Mix the meat soaked bulgur wheat (follow the recipe on the package) in a ratio of 3 meat to 1 bulgur. Also add 1 grated (or pureed) onion. Salt the meat and then salt the outside when grilling. Because the meat is greasy, dip your hands in ice water when forming the patties. Serve with the cucumber yogurt sauce...YUM!

After reading the previous comments, I was startled at how dull the flavour was. Definately keep and add extra garlic. Definately let the flavours rest a little longer. Next time I will certainly increase spice for increased flavour.

Great recipe. I make this for my boyfriend (who is Greek) and he loves it. To the prior commentors, TZATZIKI IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THIS MUCH GARLIC AND MUCH, MUCH MORE! For more authentic "yogurt sauce" add some dill, MORE garlic, and drain the yogurt for at least an hour. It also helps to let the sauce sit in the refrigerator for a while to let the flavors combine.

TOO MUCH GARLIC. Tone down the garlic, add some diced tomatoes to the yogurt sauce, serve with grilled onions and grill/broil your Pita as well.

These are fab-u-lous! I am not a major lamb lover, but I do like gyros. These taste exactly like the gyro meat that you get in one of those sandwiches.

Rating: 3
I threw these on the grill instead of broiling...a little smoke never hurts. One change I would make would be to decrease the amount of onion, and substitute some feta. If you do that, don't use salt to season. If you want to add some more fun, toss some cayenne into the yogurt sauce.

For years I have been searching for a recipe that captures the flavors of the gyros that I get at a tiny greek taverna, and this comes very close! I added a bit of fresh dill to the meat mixture and made the sauce a few hours ahead to let the flavors blend. Next time I will be more careful not to overcook the meat, which was a bit dried out after the suggested cooking time. Otherwise, this is a highly flavorful recipe that joins my collection of frequently prepared favorites.

Great! Yogurt could have used a little less garlic, when raw it is very potent!

In Greece I became obsessed with tzatsiki sauce, but was wary of the calories which full-fat yogurt imparts. This is a delicious substitute -- the flavor of the sauce is just about as good as I had in Athens. It might be a good idea to "sweat" the cucumbers a little, for the sauce gets runny. Truly a good recipe.

Tzatziki is excellent as a potato topping, salad dressing or sandwich spread for hot or cold meat. Pita bread and tzatziki makes a great lunch or snack.

My husband had overcooked the patties a bit, but with my "heavy hand" next time, we should get it perfect. I also cut the yogurt sauce in half and found that was sufficient.

I think this was a bit too much garlic in the receipe; next time, I'll use maybe 1/2 as much. I use a tzatziki sauce recipe based on sour cream that I found when I was in Europe, but the overal ingredients are pretty much the same. Instead of eating this as a "hamburger", I slice the meat into strips just like a gyro, and heat the pita bread in a frypan to soften it up - it folds easier that way. Maybe a little refinement on my part, and this becomes a 4 forker!
