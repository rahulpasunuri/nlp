Love this recipe, replaced almonds with walnuts and added 1tsp of ginger. Used 3tsp vanilla, didn't have almond extract. Wonderful easy recipe that people really liked, I found the flavor mild while other reviewers said they were pungent. I brought these to a morning staff meeting at work, my co-workers enjoyed them with their coffee.

I was intrigued by the spices in these cookies but wary due to the reviews. Flat? Round? Flaky? Crispy? How long to cook? Instead I realized what I wanted was Russian Tea Cakes with these spices added. So, annoyingly, a review that is not a review. However, they turned out great and I'd recommend it if you're as confused as I am about what these will turn out to be.

These are my new favorite cookies. I forgot to give the second roll in confectioners sugar and I am just as glad since they were plenty sweet. Definitely for crispy cookie lovers with a latte on the side.

I love these cookies! I have been making them for years now. I always double the recipe and I use pecans instead of almonds, I prefer the richer taste of pecans. I like them better then the wedding cake style. I usually make both kind at Christmas.

350 degrees for 25 minutes is too hot and too long. These cookies are overwhelmed by the confectioner's sugar and are more textural than tasty.

I've made these cookies many times before (see review by acafe - that's me). I just featured them on my blog. I love them! http://unhipsquirrel.blogspot.com/2011/06/chai-spiced-almond-cookies.html

These are wonderful, fragrant and seem impressive when served! I used gluten-free flour and it worked wonderfully. I also used an extra 1/4 cup of chopped almonds. Scrumptious!

Followed recipe exactly. The cookies were very tasty. Mine came out quite hard and flat (not like the picture), but yummy.

I have made these many times and they are definitely a favorite! I've made smaller, thimble sized cookies and large, tablespoon sized cookies. Be sure to take the time to roll the cookies twice in powdered sugar to get a really white, even coating.

made as exactly as in recipe and they were wonderful-- deliciously rich and almondy. the slightly crumbly texture was perfect.

Works equally successfully with Splenda substituted for all sugar. Looks, cooks, and tastes exactly like the powdered-sugar version with far fewer calories.

Very good, I went with other reviewers and cooked only 18 minutes. Had no ground cardamom on hand but I had whole pods so I ground the seeds by hand (note to self use coffee grinder next time).Brought to Thanksgiving and people loved them, even kids.

These cookies were great, they were very easy to make and everyone said they were yummy. I will make it again.

i made these cookies exactly as written, except i rolled them in sugar only once. they were delicious, though next time i would probably reduce the spice to 1/2 tsp allspice, 1/2 tsp cardamom and 1/3 tsp cinnamon. i think they would benefit from the slightly more subtle flavour. i will definitely be making them again!

Delicious. Not crunchy or chewy. 25 minutes yielded perfect texture, but I am at high altitude. My only problem was the powdered sugar got a little gummy. Maybe my cookies were still too hot when I rolled them the first time? They don't look evenly sprinkled like the photo.

Fabulous! Husband raved. Will definitely make again and double recipe next time. Agree with another reviewer--bake for 18 minutes, no more.

So much for my "adult taste" review - I took them to my daughter's kindergarten classroom and they were immediately devoured. A huge hit!

My cookies took more like 20 minutes to bake. The texture and flavor are awesome - very tender, crumbly, melt-in-your-mouth. However, they are misclassified as "kid-friendly." I think they are definitely more for an adult taste. More sugar in the dough itself would probably help this.

These cookies were super easy to make, sophisticated, and delicious. As others found, the actual yield was less than the recipe states- I used a tbs to measure the dough before rolling, and still got ~30 after doubling the recipe. Fortunately, since they're so easy, I was able to just whip up a third batch! I brought them to Thanksgiving dinner and got rave reviews all around. Also, 2 cups of powdered sugar was plenty for 3 batches, even with rolling the cookies twice.

My husband is originally from India so he loves anything that's even reminiscent of the food of his childhood. When I make these again I'll add more spices. Nice crispy-crunchy texture.

so easy. so delicious. i guess mine were bigger, only made 15 (although i probably ate three in batter form!)

I made these for a cookie exchange, and my friends all decided to make this recipe for all their friends and neighbors as gifts. I would say that they were a hit. I didn't have any Allspice, though, so I substituted with some ground ginger and some ground nutmeg. I also didn't have any ground cardamom, so I ground the cardamom seeds myself, which may have resulted in a stronger cardamom flavor. I would suggest only rolling them in powdered sugar once, as they are sweet enough with just one roll.

Delicious, esp the flavor of the Indian spices. I tried them in the microwave, the baking time was around 2 min. But some of my cookies got burnt, maybe becasue i dint use an electric beater and tried with manual

Simply delicious! These cookies are very easy to make and have a warm, spicy, sophisticated flavor. Perfect for the cooler weather we're experiencing in Seattle these days. I reduced the baking time to 17 mins based on another review I read, and glad I did so. The cookies were the perfect texture  crunchy but not dried out at all. I also substituted granulated sugar for powdered sugar in the dough, which I think helped the texture as well. I rolled the cookies in powdered sugar, though. Lastly, I doubled the batch and the recipe held up beautifully. My co-workers raved about these&I cant wait to make them for my friends!

This was sooo easy and sooo good, especially if you like the flavor of cardamon. I mixed in the nuts first, before adding flour.

This were excellent though I made a few changes. I used 1/2 cup flaked almonds which I toasted in a hot oven and then crumbled. I also reduced the amount of almond extract and baked them for 17 mins. They came out perfectly - just like flavoured shortbread.

Wow! I also made the mistake of not reading the recipe fully, and used granulated sugar in the cookie, so that may have changed the texture from the original, but what an awesome cookie so I'll keep making the mistake. Reminds me of pfeffernusse. Can't wait to make them again and again. Super easy.

Let me tell you why this recipe is so amazing. 1) very lovely tea cookie (substitute orange zest for almond extract for a more complex flavor) 2) incredibly simple to make: 1 bowl, 1 cookie sheet 3) the batch yields a small amount, allowing you to have a greater combination of Christmas cookies without being stuffed to the gills AND 4) long cooking time allows you to clean the kitchen while they're baking. All around a good cookie for Christmas baking or winter tea parties.

Made this for a brunch with friends and it was a big hit. I found the texture to be similar to that of shortbread. The spices are just wonderful and these cookies are perfect to have with a good cup of cafe latte or tea.

Very tasty and quite easy. I would not say they are dry, this is a hard-texture cookie--not a soft chewy cookie. I've made them a few times now exactly as stated in the recipe and this cookie has earned its way into my keeper recipe file. The flavors do change quite a bit with time. I found the unbaked dough just awful but the final product is delicious!

I'm working to perfect these cookies. I found like other reviewer, 25 minutes was way too long and they were dry. The flavor is fabulous - I've made them three times now trying to get them right. Next, I'm experimenting with slivered almonds and perhaps only 1/2 cup to see if they aren't as dry. Perfect with a cup of tea.

Delicious little cookies! Perfect for a late night snack with a hot cup of tea. I froze them after cooking, and grab a couple out whenever I need them. Terrific!

These little cookies were such a hit at my last party! Everyone loved them...I also added a bit of water to hold the mix together better....thanks for the tip!

these were really good. their taste changed completely from when they were warm, to when they were cool, and different still the next day. I love them because they are not too sweet. skipped the almond extract (didn't have any) and increased the almonds. Added 2 tbsp. water to get them to stick.

I accidentally beat the butter with regular sugar instead of powdered sugar, and the cookies ended up having a very interesting texture - crumbly and a little crunchy, but still moist. I think I would do it that way again in future. I also used 2 tsp of almond extract and a little more than 1 tsp of vanilla just for some extra flavor, and got terrific results. I also used a cookie scooper to get even, symmetrical cookies.

Excellent! I wouldn't change a thing. They are wonderful. Don't overbake, though.

I thought these were great! I tried to rig my own chai cookie recipe for the Christmas season but they were a disaster. I was so pleased when this recipe came with my Bon Appetit with plenty of time before the holidays. They are much more interesting than the traditional wedding cookies. Will be a regular in my Christmas repertoire.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cookies came out perfectly. The almond flavor was light and not too over-powering. They are not chewy cookies by any means, but they weren't too brittle either. When I make these next, I will double the recipe since it made around 20 small cookies. These cookies are a spicier version of Russian Tea Cookies!

Yum! But bake them for only 18 minutes,(just light brown on the bottom) then proceed as the recipe says: cool on cookie sheet for 5 minutes, roll in powdered sugar, cool completely, roll in powdered sugar again. Enjoy! These are a spicier version of my beloved recipe for Almond Cresents from a 1950's cookbook. I made them for a birthday present for tomorrow, that is, unless we eat them all tonight!

Thee cookies were okay, but they are REALLY dry -- like a biscotti, except not as hard, more crumbly.I think they would be good with tea, though. However, the flavor is incredible. If I were to make this recipe again, I would consider doubling everything (except the toasted almonds -- they are a little overpowering & would probably use ~ 1 cup) because it only made 20 cookies. I would also consider adding a hair more butter or maybe even a bit of corn syrup to make them less crumbly.
