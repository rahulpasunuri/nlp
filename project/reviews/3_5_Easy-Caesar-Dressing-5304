I think this is really an easy recipe to do. I will make this again however i would adjust the lemon juice to about half of the original volume.

Agave 1/4 c. organic sour cream 1/3 c. grated parmesean pepper to taste Served w/ homemade italian seasoned bread crumbs on a bed of spring mix lettuce. Kids say it is a keeper!!

I didn't use the worcestshire sauce and added a bit of anchovy paste. It's delicious.

I made the recipe exactly as it instructs and was very disappointed. Next time I'll add some anchovy paste or fillets and something else to give it more of a caesar flavor. This just tasted like a vinegrette with some cheese in it.

Great recipe in terms of texture and base flavor. I added 3 anchovie fillets and half tsp dijon mustard and it improved significantly, I would definately repeat this recipe but adding a little less lemon juice. As a reccomendation use premium quality olive oil to guarantee flavor.

Great recipe, but I felt it required some changes. Here is what additions I made to the recipe: 1 Egg 1/4 tsp mustard powder 2 anchovies With these additions, I think this was the best Caesar dressing I've ever had...and my husband agreed.

Very easy recipe, and it was excellent. Better than having to deal with raw egg which is in some recipes.

i thought this was the easiest caesar dressing i have EVER made and i make caesar dressing a lot. it was also great for me because my husband can't eat eggs. i just added some anchovies and a touch of dijon mustard and used all olive oil. will use this recipe from now on.

I would make a few changes reagrding this dressing, use lemon zest as well as the juice from 2 large lemons, garlic, shallots, Oil and vinegar, SOUR CREAM (1/2 cup), 2 tbsp dijon mustard, a pinch of sugar, salt and feshly ground black pepper and a dash of cayenne pepper. Delicious!

I believe worchestershire sauce has anchovies in the ingredients list, no? My particular brand did. :) Anyhow, easy, and works for me!

I have made this several times and I love it...it is so easy..I do add more garlic and a bit more lemon..just my preference..and yes, freshly grated parm is so much better!!!

A very quick and easy recipe. If you love garlicy caesar, this is for you. It seeemed like maybe they called for too much oil. I would still do it again.

Well, I don't know the full history of the invention of the Caesar salad, and purists might not think that this is truly a Caesar dressing, but in any case this is a very tasty Caesar-esque dressing. It is especially brilliant if you want or need to prepare a Caesar dressing without anchovies or raw egg (e.g., for vegetarians, pregnant women, or people who just plain don't like raw egg or anchovies!).

To the previous reviewer: did you actually try the recipe? If you had, you'd know it tastes great. Incidentally, anchovies were not used in Caesar Cardini's original recipe-- the ingredient was added later. So this recipe is more "authentic" than most.

No Cesar Dressing can be called so if the recipe lacks anchovies.

Easy recipe. Goes great with homemade pizza. I added a tad bit more garlic and used FRESH cheese.

I made this salad for several friends. It got rave reviews. I loved it because it was so easy to make!

As a vegetarian who loves caesar salad but hates the anchovies and raw egg slime, this is a great alternative. Easy and quick. Everyone at a BBQ loved it. Did not find it grainy at all--thorough mixing in the blender took care of that.

We liked this dressing. We're Parmesan lovers so didn't find it too "grainy". Did add a tsp. of anchovy paste.

I found the dressing too grainy and not worth the time washing the lettuce.
