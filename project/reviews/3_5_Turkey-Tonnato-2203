My cook made it exactly as stated on the recipe.It looked gorgeous in the oval casserole dish with the lemon slices placed around the edge.The flavor is very nice and like one of the earlier reviewers,we had it for sandwiches 2 days later and the turkey was even more tasty.Very nice way to use tuna cans in pantry.

Although it tasted ok, just didn't look appealing. I won't do this one again.

I'm with nancy! I loved this recipe and thought that the blended flavors were deep, rich, and superb. I'm so glad to find a recipe for a chicken breast roast(so healthy) which is really TASTY. Although I made it "just for family", I think it must make a fabulous "company" dinner.

This was wonderful. I had out of town company and we were away for the weekend. I made it on Friday and on Sunday when we returned we had dinner waiting for us. Everyone raved about it. How is this for an opposite review to the first one!

DON'T BOTHER WITH THIS ONE IT'S A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY! SALTY, BITTER AND THE INGREDIENTS JUST DON'T BELONG TOGETHER.
