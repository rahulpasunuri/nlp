I agree it needs a little more flavor. It was good but not great. I used good quality everything but it needs more. I added lots of salt at the table but should of added more than I did during cooking. I am not sure what else would have helped.

Made this again last night for the first time in about a year. Still great. Still shows well for dinner guests (which mine was for a client). Learned a few new adjustments that I'll be making on my go rounds: Yes to White Wine vinegar instead of Cider however either the quantity need be reduced or you need to reduce the liquid for much more time than recommended (I reduced 1 1/2 tbls in the wine for about 15 mins). I added salt and pepper to the end broth, which is not on the recipe but very effective. Also, I used Rainbow Chard and found that to be a more complex and crisper leaf for this dish. I imagine that leafy kale or any other chard would do well. I also think that the next time I make this I'm going to add a bit more mustard for a richer texture (I used whole grain). Though I used Marlborough Sav Blanc, I'm not sure it was necessary to use that specific of a dry white.

I would definitely make this again. As for the folks who say this is not flavorful, I can only guess that they didn't season the sauce in addition to seasoning the salmon or that they used sub-par ingredients... I paid attention to a few other comments and used a Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc and Maille whole grain mustard. I didn't have fresh tarragon, so I used dried (half the amount of fresh). I also used homemade chicken broth. The dish was pungent and flavorful... Holy moly. The potatoes and spinach are a nice accompaniment, but other veggies could easily be subbed.

We made this on the spur of the moment, and didn't have spinach but we added sliced fennel with the shallots. It was delish! To those who found this recipe bland, we would suggest that your choice of wine may be to blame. This one does need a dry white wine, chardonnay won't do. Also, use a good mustard. With good quality ingredients this dish is a keeper.

I would normally only give this two forks, as "good," but it is super duper easy, as well as a complete and healthy meal, so I give it three. It's not ridiculously flavorful, but it hit the spot for my boyfriend and I when we had a bad cold. Granted my chicken broth is homemade. You need to adjust the cooking times based on the size of your potatoes and thickness of your salmon. The cooking time for the salmon in particular is too long for most pieces you would get in the regular grocery store. For my pretty typical piece, I seared 3.5 mins total, cooked in the oven for 10 mins total, and that was just about right.

We really liked this. I used leek instead of shallot, and added lemon zest to broth. Also arugula instead of spinach. Fish was perfect, moist but cooked through Easy to make, savory weeknight meal for early fall.

Lovely. One of my guests commented how earthy it tasted, very real, all the ingredients distinct. The flavor of this sort of cooking really depends on the best quality fresh ingredients. I did use baby arugula as an earlier reviewer suggested. My preferred wine pairing is a Marlborough Savignon Blanc.

Like other reviewers, I improvised. I had some fresh salmon from a local fish market - which I believe is the key. I browned the salmon, as stated in the recipe, made the sauce as directed omitting the fresh tarragon, but added a touch of fresh lemon. I don't have a traditional oven so I covered the salmon with saran wrap and microwaved for 5 minutes. I served it with broccoli I had on hand and fresh baguette. Delicious! Loved the shallot, wine, and mustard sauce! Very tasty! Great combination with the rich texture of salmon. Served with a dry white wine. Definitely feel free to improvise!

Very good, but I prefer my wild alaskan salmon more medium rare, so I would adjust the saute time or the baking time. This recipe cause salmon to end up medium well, in my kitchen.

This is a nice recipe with lots of room to improvise. I think I changed 80% of the recipe and it was great. I used swiss chard instead of spinach (and tossed in some lemon juice and red pepper flakes), a leek instead of shallots, mushroom broth instead of chicken, and a mixture of dry vermouth, rose wine, and a splash of Pernod instead of white wine. I also seasoned my broth, which it only implies but doesn't state. Delicious.

This is NOT a keeper, very bland, wouldn't make it again, though it was easy to prepare.

I found this to be a rather enjoyable and easy way to flavor and present salmon. My changes: Purple potatoes, 1 Tbl garlic to the leafy saute for a minute, roasted corn to the broth added pre bake, a few tablespoons of brothy/ starchy water added to the broth (leftover from reconstituted dried garbonzos used to make roasted garlic hummus days before) and a little less vinegar than called for. Not so likely that I'll have "garbonzo water" on hand when I next make this but, hey, I also used an exceptional mustard (Maille- gifted to me straight from Paris) so maybe THAT was the secret to the sauce! Now I'll soap box: It's weird to me that anyone would make a daily meal "by the book" and be disappointed with the results. I believe that recipes are guides not rulebooks. I have fun with them (who has exact ingredients all the time and flavor-experimenting is a blast), taste along the way and adjust as necessary. I'm only precise when baking or when trying to pull off something really special, which is when I'm neurotic in the kitchen.

This turned out very well. I added a bit of garlic to the broth and reduced the wine down to a syrup before adding the broth. I also added a vegetable boullion cube to enhance the flavor.

After reading all the mixed reviews I was a little skeptical when trying this recipe, but I love potatoes, I had Salmon in the freezer that didn't have much time left to it, and the dijon intrigued me. Well it was pleasantly surprising and FULL of flavour! As usual, I added my own personal touch and made a few changes based on the ingredients I had. Also, as with most dishes that call for wine, the kind of wine you use makes a difference. I used a dry Chilean Sauvignon Blanc that was a little fruity. I used rice vinegar instead of apple cider, yukon gold potatoes, organice vegetable broth instead of chicken, I added half a red pepper and 1 medium onion instead of shallots, olive oil instead of butter and canola, I added a tiny bit of onion while cooking the spinach and some asparagus in the final baking dish in the oven. Served with button mushrooms on the side, it was delicious!

Made this for a special friend as the two of us had wine and talked...It's a labor-intensive recipe whose heaviest lifting, for me, was the washing of 1.5 lb. of spinach! The end result was delicious and I was pleasantly relieved to see the fish had not dried out. The conversation was so good that I unintentionally left out the mustard but we just slathered some on in the final moments and it tasted just fine...

Delicious recipe. Cut out the butter and used olive oil. Grilled salmon and placed on a bed of arugula (instead of spinach--also used dried tarragon instead of fresh). Then poured broth over top and served at an Easter brunch. YUM.

This recipe was just ok. I think the mustard overpowered the other flavors and my taste testers were confused over whether it was a soup or a main entree. Too much work for salmon that tastes like mustard with soup underneath.

Not a keeper. Sorry to everyone who said this recipe is a keeper, but my print out went into the recycling after this dinner. I followed it to the T and it was flavorless and bland. And that is with the very, very good salmon I buy! The effort to reward ratio was too high for me. There are much more simple and tastier recipes.

All I can say is WOW. Great amalgam of flavors & textures. I, like some others cooked the potatoes on the stove till they were fork tender which worked well. I also was forced to use dry tarragon...if you do, use only about 1/2 the recommended amount. All in all it was a wonderful recipe...easy to prepare and fantastic flavor.

I made this awesome recipe with only one variation...I used the same heavy skillet for everything, and mixed the leftover butter with the wine mixture. You'll need to boil the butter & wine for longer than 7 minutes though :)

This recipe turned out great the first time. I picked up good quality wild salmon and sliced the skin off myself. Searing both sides is key. I also cooked the broth in advance and let sit. The potatoes however took much longer to cook. I boiled new red potatoes for 15 minutes before baking with the salmon. When I pulled the dish after about 18 min (I wanted to ensure salmon didn't overcook) the potatoes were still far from cooked through. So I pulled the salmon and put it the fillets on a plate keeping warm, then added some more broth and baked the potatoes for another 15 min. Then I turned the oven off and put the salmon back in to warm up before serving over the wilted spinach. Next time I'll just boil the potatoes for another 10-15 min.

When I decided to try making this dish I was in an experimental mood, but didn't have very high hopes. Boy was I wrong! This was a delicious dish--the broth in particular was truly lovely and well balanced in flavours. the only ingredient I substituted was the tarragon (I didn't have any on hand, so I used fresh rosemary instead). It's definitely a do-over, and quite simple in preparation.

The broth in this dish was phenomenal. All of the flavors blended together perfectly. I had to cook the potatoes longer than called for but other than that I wouldn't change anything. My husband loved it and said there would be no complaints if I made it one night a week.

I thought it was tasty, my husband said it was just OK. I precooked the potatoes longer and roasted the whole dish for a shorter length of time. My salmon was farm raised and the fillets were not very thick. I was afraid it would be overcooked if I roasted it for the 20 minutes. It was a pretty dish and I liked the combination of flavors.

Made it just as is with wild salmon and the whole family loved it. I think next time I might try to thicken sauce a little, just to see if I like it better but I can say that we all loved it and I will be making this again and again!

The moment I saw this recipe, I knew I had to make it. I don't know how anyone could call it bland. It is amazing and has much flavor to savor. Also the color scheme for it is really nice. Just when cooking it, you can really start to smell all the flavors. I am defintaly making this again.

I looked at this recipe and noticed the potatoes and immediately decided to aubstitute asparagus. I put the asparagus in the roasting pan with the fish. I did use a very thick cut salmon so I only had to reduce the cooking time a smidge. (I am glad I did because the salmon was beautiful and I didnt want to ruin it.) I also couldnt find tarragon and grow my own parsley so I subsituted the parsley upped the mustard (used a mix of grainy mustard and dijon) and it was great.

Despite some prior reviews, I decided to try this because I couldn't imagine how a dish with vinegar, mustard, broth and herbs wouldn't be flavorful. This recipe was tasty and light. I used white wine vinegar, and I think 2 shallots is overkill, would use just one next time. I used dill instead of tarragon, which worked well. Served it on a bed of sauteed greens.

After reading the mixed reviews I was hesitant to try it but I am glad I did. Some may think the recipe is bland. I found it to have a clean and fresh taste but complex enough to make it interesting. From time to time,one needs a respite from more rubust flavors. I made it for Sunday dinner and all six of us loved it!

Added to my review: I used all Olive Oil instead of using the Canola... and used white wine vinager instead of the cider (a recommendation from a previous reviewer)... didn't have any chicken broth, so made some from "better than bullion"... Takes awhile to make, too...

After reading the reviews, I was worried about it being bland, so I added more mustard and more tarragon-- used a nice quality dry white wine, a beautiful fresh wild organic salmon, and sha- zam, it was really good! Next time I will reduce the sauce more--make it a bit thicker with some cornstarch or ?? and see what happens. I really liked this recipe!

I won't bore my family with this recipe again. It's a good one if you live in a retirement home and don't have any more taste buds. The time I spent making the sauce was time out of my life wasted that I will never have back again. NEVER cook salmon that long - even if it's a thick wild cut. Sacralege to put the name "Bon Appétit" next to it.

This salmon was pretty good. I'd add some different spices, eliminate the apple cider vinegar & use some good old fashioned olive oil with some European butter. I'm a big girl and I like my calories. In my country men like a girl with a little meat on their bones. bon apetite. mama goldie

After making the broth, we really wondered about how this would taste. The broth was, as some have said, a strange mix of flavors. I admit, we substituted baby brown onions for shallots and white wine vinegar for apple cider vinegar. In spite of that, the fish and potato/onion combo were delicious. We just didn't want to pour oodles of the brother on it when serving. If I make it again, I'd probably use dill, shallots instead of tarragon and maybe consider some additions to the broth. Definitely a very nice cooking method for the salmon - it came out nice and flaky and moist. Potatoes were great, too.

I made this for a large family style dinner (which included kids, teens and adults), so I doubled the recipe. It was devoured! Here's what I did differently; Broth - I used red wine vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. I actually made the broth several hours ahead of time and simply let it sit. I reheated it just before I needed it. Salmon - Do have the skin removed! I pan seared it for about 2 minutes per side only (I think the time suggested was too long...I didn't want to dry out the fish). I did this about 2 hours before I intended to serve it. I put the seared fish in the baking pan, added the steamed potatoes and covered it with foil and let it sit on the counter. I followed the baking time exactly as well as the cooking time of the spinach. The broth added fabulous flavor to the potatoes. I served this in bowls...don't over ladel the broth...it's not supposed to be a soup dish!

This was an ok recipe, but I think you could use the same ingredients to make a much better meal. For instance, I'd roast the potatoes in olive oil with a handful of chopped herbs, while either grilling or broiling the salmon. Then, I'd make a sauce with the shallots, butter, wine, tarragon, mustard, and maybe a bit of vinegar and broth to serve over the fish. Forget about cooking it all together in a broth in the oven. Add the sauteed spinach, and you'd have a great meal with alot more flavor than this recipe provides. As the recipe is, I'd say it is not worth a second go.

This recipe was "bomb" as my daughters said. They have never liked salmon in the past the way I make it which is usually on the grill, but this time they want it again! As far as lazykate saying it tasted like "dirty socks" I would like to know from her when the last time was she ate dirty socks and if she might have been lazy in making this recipe. It was great, my whole family liked it even the ones that cannot stand fish.

yuck! first of all, i cooked it exactly as directed (and my oven temp is low if anything), and this came out way overcooked - as an earlier rater has also noted. second of all, vinegar, mustard, tarragon, and salmon? while all are perfectly fine ingredients, the combination was way too much . . . i don't know of what . . . just too much. it tasted like dirty socks.

How common is it for an 11 year old to say, "Mom, this is really great", especially when it comes to fish and spinach? I mean, these are the two banes of any kids diet! This is a filling but healthy dish that can appeal to so many different tastes. I will definately make this again. As far as I am concerned this is a meal that can be adjusted in many different ways and it will never lose it's integrity. Enjoy!

Very good! The fish turned out excellent. I would make sure the potatoes are almost all the way cooked on the stove, because baking them did not cook them much more. Good meal on it's own.
