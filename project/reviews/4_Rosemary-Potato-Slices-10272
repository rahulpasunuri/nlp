This is a super simple and tasty recipe that goes with many main courses. I altered the recipe slightly by adding a clove of crushed garlic to the butter just after melting, swirling the mixture around for about 10-20 seconds before spreading on the baking pan. This dish is great for adding to a menu with more labor-intensive dishes; after only a few minutes of preparation it cooks away in the oven while you're focusing on other things, and it's fine if you get preoccupied and leave it in a extra few minutes.

Simple and wonderful. The kind of comfort food that stabilizes a winter meal. An appropriate accompaniment to much more lively dishes.

I broiled them for a few minutes at the end to make them crispy on top. We loved these potatoes, but next time I'll use less butter, and try the fresh rosemary.

Loved this recipe for its simplicity. We cooked them until they were slightly golden on the outside, and they were nice and tender on the inside.

Everyone loves this recipe. It's even become one of my husband's favorite dishes.

I make something very similar to this dish, but I also layer thinly sliced onions between the potato layers. I dot each layer with butter and sprinkle lightly with rosemary and seasoned salt.

These were a total hit. Very tasty and tender.

So easy and yet so good! I would suggest using fresh rosemary (about 1 1/2 teas) if you have it handy. I also added some pepper with the salt.

Very good side dish. i served it with rib eye steak with mushroom saute, which also featured rosemary and the combination was very good. I ended up using a mixture of olive oil and butter (it looked dry during cooking so I poured olive oil on top while flipping the slices over.) the rosemary makes for a nice smelling kitchen too!
