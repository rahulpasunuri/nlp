Pretty good. We used mangos and blueberries instead of pears and raspberries (late March isn't really the best time of the year for fruit). Enjoyed the honey and rum combo, but used only a half teaspoon of the bitters. Anything more than that would have been overkill. For fruit salad, it's very dark tasting and full of warm flavors, so I'd consider using brighter, more tropical fruits next time.

Everyone really enjoyed this dish, yes I did change some of the fruits using pineapple, mango, apple, nectarines, red & green seedless grapes, and a mix of blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. The dressing makes the dish. I used only 2 tbsp of honey, thought it might be too sweet and added a tbsp of freshely squeezed meyer lemon juice (helped keep the fruit from discoloring) Was a big hit at easter brunch! A definite keeper

This was great--light and refreshing. I served it as part of a brunch, and it was a wonderful complement to the other dishes. The rum wasn't heavy at all; one of my guests doesn't like any kind of alcohol, and she even liked the fruit salad.

This was a serviceable salad. Nothing special, but it was tasty and refreshing. I used strawberries, bananas, cantaloupe and watermelon. I'll try again with other fruits. RH

I served this as an accompaniment to my Father's Day menu and it was great. You can use any fruit that you perfer. It was a little sweet but worked well with the menu which consisted of Chili Marinated Flank Steak (BA 7/02), Barbeque Baked Bean (Epicurious); Southwestern Layered Pasta Salad (Mastercook); and Coffee-Toffee Ice Cream Tart (BA 8/01)- great menu.

I made this as a dessert for a party and it was gone right away. I am sorry I did not make more since it was so easy and quick to make.

This fruit salad was simple and elegant and my guest ate it up! I think it's a great idea for a light finish to a hearty meal!

This was tasty with icecream, although not the outstanding sensation I hoped for. However, it was so easy to do that I will keep it on my list of dinner party faves. Everyone had second helpings, anyway, so I suppose that counts for something.

Mmm! Added pomegranate for color & texture. It was a hit. New party favorite!

I didn't have strawberries or pears,and my blueberries were frozen. I substituted an extra banana, 2 plums and a nectarine for missing ingredients. It was really good. I think it would be better with raspberries and strawberries, and I'll find out next time I make it.

I never even got a chance to taste this, because it was all eaten so fast! Everyone at the party loved it. I used spiced rum, and left out the bitters. I'll definitely make it again!

Absolutely delicious. I used spiced rum since I didn't have the bitters.

To Clancy from Leesburg: check out the Epi dictionary, according to them it is merely a matter of brand name.

Although I tend to prefer fruits without a dressing, this recipe is very good for a "dressed" fruit salad.

Can someone please tell me if Peychaud's Bitters is the same thing as the bitters used in this recipe???

I almost didn't put this out for the party, because I thought it tasted so bland. But I did, to rave compliments! It was gobbled up so fast! I would definately make it again.
