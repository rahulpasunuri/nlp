I eliminated the poppy seeds and tomato, used some coarse grain and a drop of honey instead of honey mustard, and mashed the sweet potato as another reviewer recommended. I also used some salad greens instead of shredded lettuce, and a slice of provolone instead of monterey jack. Even with all those changes, the sandwich was extremely delicious. However, I had to deduct a fork for its architectural flaws. Even with mashing the sweet potato, it was quite messy. Before I mashed, it was absolutely impossible to imagine eating it. The slices of boiled sweet potato and avocado would just slide off each other and out of the sandwich. I agree with the other reviewer that the red onion is essential.

yummy and quick. instead of mayo, i mixed greek yogurt with the honey mustard and poppy seeds and added a few squeezes of a lemon.

This recipe was OK. It was edible as a sandwich, but I actually think I'd like it better deconstructed as a salad with a honey mustard-poppy seed dressing.

We make this sans-mayo since we have 1 mayo-hater in the house. It's a great, VERY filling, very messy, very tall sandwich. We toast our bread so the honey/mustard/poppyseed goo doesn't make our bread all mushy and limp. Also, I've made the leftovers (no bread) as a salad and it's great!

Awesome. I was worried that I wouldn't be able to make this the night before, so I made it in the morning before school. Judging by how my sandwhich held up today, I think this would be a good make-ahead sandwhich... so long as you remove the tomato seeds and pat dry the tomato slices.

I've made this a few times already. I usually leave off the cheese and go with the full fat mayo. This is a great, pretty healthy, highly adaptable sandwich. I usually use whatever veggies I have that look good and whatever bread I've been baking that week.

The flavors and textures were wonderful together. My only problem is eating it. I had stuff oozing and popping out all over. Hard to keep together.

My husband and I loved these sandwiches. It's so colorful and beautiful. I used spinach instead of lettuce, and mashed the sweet potato on my second sandwich. That kind of "glued" everything together. A great summer meal.

This was such a surprise. A delicious combination of flavours, and super filling. I rarely get through more than two thirds without being stuffed:) I make it as written, except I use small ciabatta or a mini whole wheat baguette instead of regular sandwich bread. And lately I've taken to adding a bit more mustard and poppyseeds - which I think essential.

Insanely good. A great and creative vegetarian sandwich that will impress guests at a casual lunch.

I've been looking for new recipes for sweet potatoes to help me incorporate them into my diet more. This is delicious! I put less onion in the sandwich than called for, and I think that was a mistake - the crunch of the onion is a good complement to the softness of the sweet potato and avocado. Amazing combination of flavors. Will definitely be eating these often!

Pretty good. Obviously it's just a sandwich, so modifying the recipe according to your preferences is no big deal, but I thought it was pretty satisfying as described.

This sounds so weird, but it's great. I took the suggestion to roast the sweet potato, and I agree that the poppy seeds aren't really necessary. I also found that a sweet potato and fake bacon bits sandwich with mayo and shredded lettuce is excellent. Who would have thought!

Perfect summer dinner! The only thing I would do differently next time is to omit the poppy seeds, which didn't add much flavor for me. I stuffed everything in a pita and it was a great mix of flavors. I will definitely make this again soon

Surpisingly delicious. Had to go easy on the red onion, though. I think a sweeter onion would work better.

This was fantastic! I sliced the squash and roasted it at 375 with non-stick olive oil spray for about 30 minutes, just until fork tender, instead of boiling because I love roasted butternut squash. I discovered at the last minute that I didn't the poppy seeds, but otherwise made the sandwich as the recipe indicated. I can't believe how good and filling it was. Even my husband who was a bit leary devoured it! I will definitely make this often.
