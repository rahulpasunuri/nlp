This was not worth the effort. there are plenty of other salad recipes that taste better for less effort.

I used arugula and substituted crumpled bacon for the soppressata. I also used dried tarragon. It was just wonderful! I have a grapefruit tree so I was delighted to find such a delicious salad recipe!

The grapefruit juice adds a wonderful subtlety to the dressing that works especially well with tender spring greens. I used dried tarragon in the dressing so I made it a few hours ahead to let the flavors combine. Everyone loved it.

This salad was a hit at our Italian fest.I used tarragon white wine vinegar.I doubled the recipe but used 9 tbsps of olive oil rather than 12.I also added toasted slivered almonds for texture.Everyone loved the blend of flavours

I've made this salad several times and all to great reviews - last time was for a huge Easter potluck with lamb and the works. It's so fresh-tasting and perfect for spring, especially with the tarragon - don't leave it out unless you absolutely hate it! Although not mentioned in the recipe, I would use sweet soppressata, not hot.

I also skipped the tarragon. Otherwise this salad is easy and a big hit with family and guests.

So delicious!! Skipped the tarragon in the dressing, and added lots and lots of fresh ground pepper and a bit more salt than was recommended. Went perfectly with the tossed clam and cherry tomato linguine dish (also on epicurious).

Very good but just a little bland??? Try to serve as part of a dinner, I had read the reviews first so served with a spicy cream pasta dish found in this web site( fettucine with chicken and bell pepper cream sauce) and hot homemade bread. Yummy, yummy, yummy my family wolfed it all down.

Tasty and easy - a nice summer alternative to plain old salad. I actually made the recipe (using the same quantities) for 2 as a main dish and it was very filling. The dressing lacked a little zing, I might try a little lemon juice next time to jazz it up. Otherwise a keeper.

I've already made this twice- it's SOOOO GOOOD! I modified the salad, but I really have to rate the dressing-- IT'S SUPER! I used mixed greens with toasted pecans= pieces and parmesean cheese for the salad with the grapefruit sections and the dressing. I used about half the oil because it didn't seem to need it and unintentionally made it lower fat (but still delightful). I'm not a fan of tarragon in general, but this dressing makes me change my mind. Oh, and one time I sub'd chopped white onion for the shallot (I didn't have any)- it was great.
