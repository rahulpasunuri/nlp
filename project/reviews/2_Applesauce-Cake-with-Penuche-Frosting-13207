i chose this recipe because the recipe for the cake was simple and basic. i never intend to make the frosting. i've made alterations and substitutions (less sugar, baby food which already has rolled oats, dates and usually combination fruit so there is more flavor). i also prefer putting them in muffin/cupcake pans with paper liners for 15-20 minutes. i give it 3 stars bc i think they're easy to adapt. taste great with coffee and my son loves them :) he will eat an entire muffin on his own.

first, i found the breakdown of ingredients needed confusing. this only stresses the need to read the ENTIRE recipe thoroughly 1st. i made this cake for the 1st time yesterday to test it out before making it for my son's 1st birthday. i wanted a cake he would be able to have as well. the alterations i made are as follows: -i used natural unsweetened bottled applesauce -used only 1/2 cup of brown sugar (and about 2tblsp extra to sprinkle on bottom of pan) -extra butter to coat each baking pan and then dust with flour after i coat each baking pan with butter and dust with flour, i sprinkle with a little brown sugar (abt 1tblsp each pan) and then i arranged some thinly, evenly sliced fruit in a pattern (i used a fuji apple and a asian pear). it came out quite well for my 1st attempt. friends gave me the thumbs up and my son loved it! can't wait to make it for his bday. i made it with thickly whipped whipped cream instead of the penuche frosting. thank goodness for reviews :)

I really love these reviews, it saved me from a big flop. This recipe was the only one I found close to what I wanted to make, I just changed it and it turned out really good. I used applesauce from a jar, and doubled the cinnamon & increased the other spices. The cake turned out REALLY good, moist and tasty. For the frosting - I make a fudge frosting that I have perfected after much trial and error, so I used the same technique. Bring it Just barely-or not quite- up to soft-ball stage, I test it in cold water quite often. then stir it til it's cooled down, and then add the powdered sugar. (now writing this I don't have the recipe in front of me) Sometimes adding a couple tablespoons of peanut butter(or other nut butter), while stirring to cool it, improves the texture and spreadability, and if unsweetened it helps with the overpowering sweetness of the penuche.

The oats are added in the second sentence.

dull flavour, suffers from lack of salt, also has a mystery ingredient- rolled oats - which disappears between the ingredients list and the instructions. not worth the effort.

The cake is good, but the frosting is a nightmare!

The cake was okay, but the frosting was impossible. I'm sure that I followed the recipe to the letter, yet the frosting was like trying to spread paste on a cake. After I got it to a workable consistency, by reheating and adding powdered sugar, it was then almost too sweet to eat. My kids would not even eat it. If you want to try this cake I strongly recommend using a different recipe for the Penuche frosting.
