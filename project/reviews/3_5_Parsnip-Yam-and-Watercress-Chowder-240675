Delicious! I made it dairy free, by using 1/6 cup canola at the start rather than the butter and by adding about 80 mL of soy milk at the end. I intended to use coconut cream in place of the cream but felt the consistency was creamy enough due to the yams and the parsnips. I think the coconut cream would work well for any other people unlucky enough to have to avoid dairy, but it would really change the direction of the taste which I found to be reminiscent of roast dinners and welcome winter warmth.

I love root vegetables and thought this sounded interesting. It's not terrible, but it is strangely sweet and I probably wouldn't make it again. I love cream soups and I am not shy about cream, but this really didn't need it. The parsnips make is creamy enough.

Very flavorful, interesting - a satisfying treat. I modified the recipe a bit to suit the tastes of my guests - added some celery at the beginning, turmeric, curry, dill, chile and a cinnamon stick for enhanced spice/sour tastes. I also put in some red cabbage I had left over. The result was exceptional. Would definitely make this again.

Very good. Interesting combination of flavors. Hearty, great for winter.

This was a very tasty recipe. I had bought half and half for the cream, but forgot about it when I realized how smooth and cream the puree was--no need at all! A real interesting mix of flavors, and it was incredibly filling. Delish.

Easy, healthy (as others say, whipping cream can readily be subbed for lower fat alternative), but with all the comfort of good chowder.

This recipe really benefits from adding ginger after the stage when the parsnips and onions are pureed. I also used a sweet potato instead of a yam, which may have made it less sweet. It was delicious.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and only added some skim milk instead of cream. It was already so nice and smooth with just the parsnips! Maybe a hit of heat-- cayenne pepper? I must say, however, that this recipe does not quite qualify as "quick and easy." All the peeling and chopping! Goodness! It was worth it though. :-)

Very unique, delicious blend of flavors. Easy to prepare. The orange yams and green watercress against the white base make it visually pleasing as well. I agree with the "restaurant quality" statement. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream. Blending part of the parsnip mixture thickens it nicely, so the whipping cream is not really needed for the purpose of thickening. It could be omitted entirely or substituted with low fat or skim milk to make the recipe even lower in fat and calories. My husband thought it was a little bland but I thought it was delicious.

I couldn't agree with the raves more. Restaurant quality. I don't think I've ever even tasted parsnips or watercress, so I had no idea what I was in for. Do you know what I was in for? HEAVEN. That's what. Low-cal heaven. Next time I may experiment with pureeing more of the parsnip mixture and using fat-free half and half in place of the whipping cream.

LOVE this recipe! I've also tried it with red potatoes instead of sweet potatoes, and while the flavor is different it's still delicious, slightly sweet, and hearty. I definitely vote for chopping the watercress, which I usually buy at an Asian market where it's plentiful and cheap.

This soup is very sweet from the apple and yams so it is very unusual. It is good, but weird. My son made this recipe as well and also said it was weird. I tried to give it a bit of zing to downplay the sweetness with seasoned croutons, helped a little. My son and myself are adventurous eaters and this was a bit too weird.

To the poster below- nope. It has under 12g of fat and around 7.3g of saturated fat. You were reading the percentage of calories from fat. I misread at first too!

I absolutely love this recipe. The first time I made it without the watercress and it was still great. I'm normally a salt person, but even when I made it with reduced-sodium chicken broth it was fine - I think because of the sweetness. Pairs great with a nice hunk of sourdough bread. I usually make it without the cream, as it's not strictly necessary.

I really liked the flavors in this recipe. I would recommend using a food mill instead of a blender. I would also add a little extra apple. The sweetness was yummy with the parsnip. Also, it needs a little more chicken broth to make it a little thinner.

This was excellent. I had organic parsnips that I needed to use, and was so glad to have found this recipe. The fresh nutmeg really put it over the top for me. The cook from Silicon Valley obviously read the nutritional info incorrectly or backwards. This recipe has Fat (g): 11.69; Sat Fat (g): 7.30. Not bad at all.

Hold the phone! How could you, Epicurious, possibly even CONSIDER putting this recipe in your "Epicurious NutritionData Healthy Dinner Tonight" column?? It has 41.1g fat and 11.69g sat fat -- that is NOT healthy, even for a calorie burning teenager. Please, please rework this recipe or remove it from the list. I'm sure it tastes fantastic, as any recipe with butter and whipping cream would, but it doesn't meet the requirements of a healthy recipe.

Made this as instructed. Could not be better! Amazingly filling also. Will definitely nake it again (and again...)

This recipe is very good. We couldn't find watercress so used a mature red swiss chard instead. It was fine, but this would be superb with a more strong-flavored green (like watercress, I imagine) or maybe mustard or chrysanthemum greens. The nutmeg and apple added nice dimensions to the flavor. Definitely try! I know we'll make it again.

I couldn't find watercress either so I substituted baby arugula, I was it was great. I might use more apple next time (I love Granny Smiths).

Put it this way, if I were to go into a restaurant and would order this soup, I would rave to everyone about it. So sweet and delicious. It has a very rich flavor and I couldn't get enough! Worth making despite peeling so many vegetables and cutting them into chunks. Restaurant quality!

What is winter without soup? Very sweet root vegetable soup. If trying to make healthier, you can easily omit the whipping cream. The pureed parsnips alone thicken the soup. For vegans, you can also substitute vegetable for chicken broth. At the end, using 4 Cups of broth stretches the soup and still makes it plenty thick.

Made this recipe exactly as is and loved it. My three-year old niece happily gobbled it up, too. Definitely a keeper.

Really, really good !!! Very easy to make. Very filling. Went into my "best" recipe collection.

I think kale would work, but it's a little bitter sometimes, whereas watercress has a peppery and lemony bite. I would try Swiss chard, if you can get it. It's usually easy to find, even in winter, and has a lemony but sweet flavor that would go well with the cream. Good luck!

I cannot ever find watercress in this town. Does anyone think that kale might be a substitute?? I would appreciate any comments. Thank you.

Wintry and yum. Even better drizzled with hot sauce.

Wow! Followed the recipe but added some red potatoes and didn't use quite as much parsnip or cream as called for. I'd definitley stem the watercress.

Made this mid week so hence reduced the amount of butter and used skim milk instead of heavy cream and found it fantastic, fresh nutmeg makes it.
