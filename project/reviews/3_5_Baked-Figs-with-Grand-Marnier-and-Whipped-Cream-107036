This was a huge hit-- made it ahead of time as written with black mission figs and had no trouble flaming the Grand Marnier (kinda wish I'd done it in front of the guests!). After rewarming the figs, I scattered some toasted sliced almonds on the plates, then the syrup, figs and cream. Topped the cream with a few more almonds. It was pretty and I liked the additional flavor.

This was OK. The Gand Marnier added a needed punch, but I increased it to make it flame. Also used a good quality vanilla ice cream.

This was wonderful and so simple to make with the figs from our property. The syrup did not thicken as I thought at first so I boil for 4 more minutes and it thicken a bit more. I had used 1/3 cup of sugar and was still too sweet so will lessen more next time. Will try with ice cream next time. We added more Grand Marnier for the blue flame and it was beautiful.

Very easy to make and is a nice light dessert for summer. I wish these recipes would state the type of figs to use however. There are many from which to choose. I used Calimyrna but would try with Black Mission next time. The flavors go very well together. My husband was very hesitant when I set it down but his clean plate said it all. Also, I baked and finished the figs before dinner and set them on the stove top. Then when the dishes were being cleared I whipped the cream and warmed the figs slightly. Worked out great.

I found some beautiful figs at the market and wanted a dessert recipe that wouldn't tart them up too much. This was perfect. Taste your figs first - mine were very sweet, so I used 1/2 the sugar (keep in mind that the Grand Marnier adds a lot of sweetness). The flambeeing is unnecessary - you can just boil the syrup to burn off the alcohol and reduce it. The syrup doesn't get too syrupy but is delicious.

De-li-cious!!! I love figs and this recipe is perfect. Instead whipped cream I used vanilla ice cream.

This is my favorite way to eat figs other than straight off the tree in my front yard. My family loves this recipe, and every fig season when our tree makes more figs than we can eat raw, we bake them with this recipe and there aren't any leftovers!

We enjoyed these figs very much but next time I would use less sugar, as overall the dessert was a little too sweet. I also had trouble getting the Grand Marnier to flame. Next time I would reduce the syrup, which was quite thin when the figs came out of the oven, before adding the liqueur.

These figs were easy to prepare and quite tasty. Far better, in my opinion, are Sambuca Poached Figs with Ricotta and Pine Nuts, recipe on this site. I used Triple Sec as my orange-flavored liqueur. It wouldn't flambe. No one else mentioned this problem, but it seems to me that by the time the liquid boils, the alcohol would have evaporated. Another time I'd flambe the liqueur in a separate small pan, then pour it over the finished plums. I think the reviewer from Brownsville, TX has a good idea - using vanilla ice cream.

This dish is first class. My Daughter, Son-in-Law and even the two Grand children (5 yrs & 6 yrs) came back looking for more. It is very easy to prepare and a delight to serve, Keep up the good work in providing such delicious preparations.

This is really good, even with wimpy supermarket figs. It is very simple to prepare. I substituted Splenda for the sugar, and we couldn't taste the difference. The figs are good enough without the whipped cream -- I ate my serving without and enjoyed it tremendously.

I have had this both prepared in a restuarant and in my own kitchen. I tend to use real vanilla ice cream and the whipped cream. The contrasting tastes and temperatures (I serve the figs very warm).
