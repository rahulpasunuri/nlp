I didn't have any green onion, so I used some red onion I had. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. Delicious. Light and summery. Now I'm curious how it would taste chilled. Might be good.

I love simple summer vegetable dishes like this.

This is one of my family's favorite side dishes; I make it as is and add salt. I'll reiterate what others have said and stress to dry out the zucchini. I could eat this every night.

The original recipe was rather bland. I did not like it at all. But my husband seems to think he can work with the recipe to make a tasty side dish. It is a unique recipe in that steamed veggies every night can get boring. However for our tastes, this recipe was a failure as is.

I had some extra zucchini and green onions. I made this substituting cumin for dill (since that is what I had) and it was FANTASTIC. After making the veggies I put some chicken in the skillet with white wine + lemon, then put it on top of the veggies. Delicious and easy.

I give this 4 forks, because I usually am not a fan of zucchini, but I got a bunch from my farm share, so I tried this recipe. This is the first time that I felt I was eating a zucchini dish that was delicious. It was a big hit with my guests, and it was easy, too.

Simple and tasty. I tinkered with the recipe to make it match an Indian meal by using mint instead of dill, adding salt, fresh black pepper, and a little finely diced red onion at the end. The natural sweetness of the veges was a nice contrast to the heat of the Indian food.

Easy to make, very colorful, mildly flavored. A really good alternative to my usual steamed vegetables. Served it with a simple roast chicken.

I liked this dish, but my husband couldn't get enought of it! The moisture must be removed from the zucchini.

This dish was a big hit. I used it as a side dish with Grilled Salmon. The carrots didn't add much flavor, but added color. Be sure to squeeze out the zucchini. I will certainly make this again. Easy, healthy and favorful

I have been making this EXACT recipe minus the carrots for over 30 years. It makes a great, light and flavourful side dish for a heavy meal. I'm not sure that the carrots would add anything much(not a fan of cooked carrots unless they are roasted)but try this with the zucchini and you will be pleasantly surprised. Be sure to follow the directions for squeezing out the liquid-that is key.
