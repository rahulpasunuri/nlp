This recipe was delicious! I made it for a family reunion, and it was so flavorful and interesting; great for a cold winter night. I switched the proportions of wine and water, because I didn't want it too wine-y (lots of little kids). Definitely will make again :)

All i can say is... wow. What a crowd pleaser. It's the perfect dinner party dessert for a cold night. You can prep it ahead of time and when the time comes to cook it it's simply mixing the biscuit dough, dropping it in, and cooking it. 20 min and you are serving your guests and amazing, hot, and delicious dessert. HIGHLY recommended. After one try it has entered my permanent recipe collection.

This is delicious, not too sweet, and relatively easy to make. I'll make this again and again.
