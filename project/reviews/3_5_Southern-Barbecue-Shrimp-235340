Tasty! I don't know that passing the sauce adds much, so I'd either reduce amount of sauce or double the shrimp (which we wolfed down). The shrimp is fine if it's already shelled.

A friend of mine makes a recipe similar to this and it is awesome!! So for this one I made a few changes that reminds me of my friends recipe but also gives it my own touches. I kept the same amount of butter but cut way down on the Worcestershire Sauce-about two tablespoons because the flavor goes along way. Kept the same amount lemon juice but also added about 1/3 cup of dry vermouth to thin it out a bit. I cut out the old bay seasoning and used two teaspoons of Srirachi Chili sauce for spice. Louisiana Hot sauce is great too if you don't have the Srirachi. The brown sugar is great for this because I think it cuts the tart of the lemon just enough! Also, I cooked the sauce on the stove to allow the vermouth to reduce and cook the alcohol away. Broiled the shrimp and then combined everything in a big bowl with crusty bread for dipping. Yummy!!

I made this recipe for friends and they all enjoyed it! (got lots of compliments :)) the sauce tasted almost like straight Worcester sauce, so play with the other ingredients. I added more lemon and brown sugar! I served this with corn on the cob and a baby arugula salad topped with feta, lemon juice and olive oil dressing, and pear!

I thought this dish was okay. I would use less lemon juice next time, it was a little overpowering. I would also use more brown sugar as others suggested. I might make this again because it's so easy.

I loved this! I did marinate the shrimp in half the sauce for about 2 hours. I added two more tablespoons of butter to the other half of the sauce and heated. It added a little more depth to the sauce. It's a great casual dinner with guests.

I made this last week for a tv night. We ate the whole tray of shrimp,(from the farmer's mkt) and ALL of the sauce. Charlotte, will you marry me?

I made this for my gourmet club - I was assigned this dish as an appetizer. Reading the reviews scared me but I made anyway. I used deveined, peeled, tails on shrimp. I also added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar to sweeten up the taste. I marinaded the shrimp for 2 hours before it was cooked and made another batch and poured over the shrimp once it was grilled. The group loved it and all would make again.

Good for a fast & easy dinner. I used shelled shrimp which was fine. Also, half the sauce recipe because it's way too much (I wouldn't dunk bread in the cold sauce).

I would actually give this less than one fork if it was an option. I hated the flavor of this shrimp. I'm not sure if it was the combination of worcestershire and Old bay seasoning but it was a very unpleasant taste. It was a waste of time and shrimp!

This is good, but it is extremely messy. I just made a half-recipe of the sauce and poured it all on the shrimp. I am not sure you need to extra sauce for dipping. Use very large shrimp.

Not very exciting- the sauce ended up a bit grainy from the brown sugar.

The only change I made was to grill the shrimp. The sauce is simple & tasty - we were literally licking our fingers.

These shrimp were fantastic. Served them up to a cottage-ful of family while vacationing on Oak Island, NC. Bought the shrimp from the local fishmonger and the shrimp, along with the sauce, were so tasty! Make certain your shrimp don't curl up into a ball... a sure sign they've been over-cooked. We had fresh corn-on-the-cob and baguettes and lots of cold Coronas. Simple!

Grill 'em. After all, a broiler is just an upside down grill.

This is simple (mainly because the shrimp doesn't require peeling, and the sauce is just stir-together, no heating), and the flavor is excellent. Plenty of buttery, savory sauce for dipping the baguette, just don't overcook the shrimp.
