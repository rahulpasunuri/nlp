We found this quite bland and insipid in color...not flavorful at all. The meat was tender (cooked for 2 1/2 hours) and moist. Could not find portabella mushrooms, so used shitake and cremini...maybe that was the problem.

This is amazing. We have made it twice and used leftovers to make a killer bolognese sauce. 2 amazing meals in one! Would be great for company or just a chilly Sunday night, when you have time to make it!

Superb!! Not a "classic" osso buco, but a delightful variation. I did brown the shanks at the outset, and snuck in a couple of sliced carrots with the onions and celery. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. Served it with garlic mashed potatoes.

Extremely rich and delicious. One caveat though, not a dish to serve as an entree in a multi-course meal. Very filling, so keep it simple with a bitter green salad. YUM

This was a very good recipe and pretty easy. I added in one large carrrot to the onions and this added an extra sweetness as well a nicer color in the sauce. I also used beef stock instead of water. Make sure you cook the mushrooms in batches. Served with polenta and creamed spinach. A great recipe to make for guests as it can easily be prepared ahead of time...

Served this variation of osso buco on a cake of polenta stuffed with cambozola. Certainly tasty, though it all turned out a bit brown. Next time I will think of some color to throw in to make it visually more enticing. Definitely worth a try.

This was fabulous. Very easy too, This was the second time I had made osso buco, the first time it was ok, I cant remember which recipe I first used, so for my second time I thought I'd look at something different. What a difference. I was a little hesitant to roast shanks without any liquid in the pan, but absolutely not an issue, the meat was falling off the bone, melt in your mouth delicious! The mushroom sauce was very easy, rich and perfect with the veal. I was so impressed at how simple this recipe was to make. I will be making this for Christmas dinner!

I love ossi bucci and have tried many different recipes. This is by far the best I have made and has been a standard in my house for over 10 years. Osso bucco is one of the most delicate cuts of veal and I find that classic tomato based preparations overwhelm it and take away the inherent sweetness of the meat. This recipe uses all the juice, drippings, and vegetables from the braising as the base of a delicate sauce that is enfused with the taste of the meat and the richness of the marrow. I prefer to use home made chicken stock rather than water. I am also careful not to add too much basamic vinager to make sure the tartness it adds is pleasant rather than overwhelming. I serve the ossi bucci and sauce over noodles or other pasta. It's perfection. Thank you Gourmet!

Too expensive to have turned out as dry as it did. The sauce was delicious but the meat was dry and tasteless. Was it because the shanks were frozen to start? That is how the butcher told me to use them. Not to thaw them first. Otherwise I followed the receipe.

Best osso buco I ever made (or had). I browned the shanks for 5 minutes per side consistent with other recipes that I have tried but otherwise followed this recipe exactly. The low heat and long cooking time resulted in a very tender piece of meat and the sauce was just terrific.

This is one of family favorites! Easy to prepare and really tasty - it's a big hit with all of my family members (even the kids who normally hate mushrooms)

Excellent! The sauce is soooo good. The only change that I made was to add garlic to the onions and celery. I didn't find it necessary to add water to the sauce. I made the shanks and mushrooms the day before and put the sauce together before serving. Next time I may only roast the shanks for 2 1/2 hours as they were a tad bit dry.

I thought it strange no tomato and no garlic, but when I worked on the sauce, I could see it coming together. I did add 1 teaspoon of finely minced lemon zest to the mushrooms, and 3 tab. Balsamic vinegar instead of 2. The overall taste & effect (served on polenta) was glorious!

I actually made this in an electric skillet as my oven/stove wasn't working (found out that day before a dinner party!) That did change a few things...I added broth to the onion mixture after the shanks were added. I did forget to tie the shanks so the meat fell off the bones after a couple hours. Then decided to brown the meat a bit in the skillet which carmelized the onion mixture (yum!). Couldn't find 'shrooms other than white & shiitake at the market that day so rehydrated Morels & other wild 'shrooms I had. I also used a good Merlot as the wine as I feel a red goes better with veal. You can't go wrong with veal, mushrooms, thyme, mushrooms, wine AND mushrooms...not to mention the balsamic. It was a hit - I'm still savoring the sauce.

Fab! Again, Epicurious makes it easy to look like a pro. I used beef shanks instead (there is always one veal boycotter in the crowd) and added about a third of the mushrooms into the puree. I served it over gnocchi that I learned from a local restaurant. Yum!

I cooked a three course meal for a few friends and this was the main course. A braising dish by Circulon only cost me 50 bucks..and it was well worth the investment because I will cook this again and again. Only changes were 1) to flour and brown the veal and 2) to smash a whole bulb of garlic into the braising dish. I served it over parmesan couscous and with steamed asparagus. My guests only left the marrow bone on their plates.

This is a great Fall dish, very hearty and rich. I added about 1/2 cup red wine to the final sauce and reduced it some. I also browned the veal shanks. A nice combination is the Butternut Squash Polenta also available on this site.

This seemed bland and tasted like institutional food. Perhaps browning the veal before slowly roasting it would add some character. That approach certainly works well in the classic preparation for ossobuco alla milanese, which is what I will make the next time I get my hands on some expensive veal shanks.

This sounds terrific. I normally make Marcella Hazan's Osso Buco Bianca from her second book. Can anyone compare the two? Is the oven method or the top of the stove method preferable? Why don't we have to brown the shanks in this recipe? That process adds so much flavor and eye appeal in Hazan's version.

I live in the place of origin of ossobuco and I have to say that this twist of the clasic recipe is fantastic. Could not find shiitake nor Portobello mushrooms so I used a mix of white, cremini and chantrelle mushrooms with good results. I served it with couscous cooked in chicken broth and fresh peas. On the side I served a green radicchio salad with an herb vinagrette. A very elegant dish.

Never before have I experienced such a complex blend of tastes from such a simple meal. I have made it over and over again for various dinner guests. Try using the mushroom sauce over your favority rizzotto.

Just wonderful.Slow baked it in a heavy pot with tight lid for 5 hours at Lowest oven temperature. They were so tender. I am glad I tied them because they were so "fall off the bone" juicy, just like a waterballoon. Next time I will add lots of garlic.

This was absolutely wonderful. Because it was for two, I cut the recipe in half and it was an elegant meal. I would definitely make it again!

How can you go wrong with a simple to prepare and wonderful to eat veal dish. It's very easy to double the recipe for company and it really makes them feel special. A ggod Valpolicella is a great accompanyment.

This is the second year I have made this for my husband on Valentine's Day. We love this simple to prepare and wonderful tasting dish.
