Fantastic simple salad-- especially loved the bits of ginger... I made it with the following substitutions: orange juice, cider vinegar. Added some romaine to the watercress, added avocado and oops I forgot the onion!

who would have thought this simple salad could spark such controversy? I really liked it. Just made it for lunch, and did it as written except I used mixed greens instead of watercress, and I did the chicken on the grill. It screams "luncheon", so if I have an occasion to host a shower or something, this is going to be served. really tasty.

I'm a college student and I don't like fancy dishes or anything like that (pizza is gormet enough for me) so i'm usually weary of things mixed together in an unusual way. BUT... I LOVED this. As a salad at least - I made this for dinner and i Think I shouldn't have, it's more of a lunchtime thing. Anyway - The people below are right - the dressing mixes horribly BUT... it's only horrible by itself. When you drizzle it on the salad it turns it from a random assortment of ingredients to something lovely; makes it taste very salady(is that a word?). It blends right in to the ingredients and gives them a tinge of sweet flavor. The same sort of flavor that i've tasted in salads i've gotten at restaurants. I say give this recipe a try despite how strange it looks. Expand your horizons. I'm sure with a little personal tweaking (see other reviews) everyone could like this recipe since the individual ingredients aren't the sort of thing neone would dislike. I ate half of the mango that I didn't use in the salad at the same time (wonderfully delicious). And using a semi-ripe mango is a VERY good idea (avoids excess smooshyness).

I made this salad as a part of a bridal shower luncheon. It was easy, colorful and delicious! Rave reviews from the crowd. Granted I had fresh greens from the farmer's market that helped a lot. Also, I marinated the chicken in Trader Joe's Orange Muscat Champagne Vinegar, S&P, and grilled them on the BBQ. It gave the salad a real "Summer" flavor. Enjoy!

On their own, all ingredients are delicious. I loved the dressing. Think it needs to be a bit thicker, however haven't thought of what to add to make it so. The combination of the ingredients resulted in a salad with no contrast of textures. I agree with the reviewer that said it was smooshy. Next time I will include, as another reviewer suggested, sliced cucumber, crispier greens, and a less ripe mango. I just may subsitute another fruit for the mango. I appreciate your subsitution ideas. With a little tweaking, this can become a summer go-to salad.

This was a lovely, delicious salad as written with a superb dressing...love that ginger! Have also added sliced English cucumber and avocado wedges, and subbed a combo of arugula and romaine for the watercress...all with success. Please, put all this nit-picking aside and give this salad a try. What's not to like???

Henski - so, how did your substitutions work out? I love all the reviews and substitutions. Many times they end up making a just okay recipe wonderful! I really rely on them when making decisions for my Personal Chef business. Thanks for taking the time to comment on your experiences!

To artiste1: as I said to two other posters on 6/23, "my review of this recipe (the very first one) is clearly the result of my actually having made it, exactly as written. If you couldn't tell that from my saying "the dressing was way too sweet," surely the next reviewer's comment should have helped you figure it out: "Agree with first reviewer who it seems tried it." Here's a tip for you two: click on "read all reviews" before making comments. And read carefully."

Has anyone who rated this recipe even tried it exactly? Now I need to make it just to see what's up...you guys need to lighten up and just rate the recipe if you have actually tried it...I don't want to hear about how you substituted Moroccan Moon Oranges...just make it and tell us what you think...sheesh...

I have more fun reading the remarks than the recipes. Keep it up people - it beats TV any day!

The dressing is excellent. I substituted blood oranges for the mango and added avocado slices. You can let your imagination run wild with this recipe. It's the dressing that makes it unique. By the way, when you review a recipe but don't mark whether you would make it again, that averages in as a No answer. That's why this recipe has such a low "Make it again" percentage. Recipes that get a lot of comments, but no ratings, end up with very deceptive numbers. Many of us who scan a lot of recipes using the ratings to narrow them down miss some great ones because of this.

My family and I loved this recipe. Even my 14 year old picky daughter. It's a great summer salad and I will definitely make it again.

Bottled catalina dressing on beautiful fresh mango?? What is this, the 1950's? How about some jello to go with it?? Euuw.

Ah... yeah. Note to posters with anger management issues: we didn't rate it. Communication works two ways, and frankly, I appreciate seeing other opinions including different options. And so, apparently, do a lot of other people. So get over it.

Do some of you using this site not understand what "rate THIS recipe" means. When I come to this site I want to know what THIS recipe was like...not anyone's souped up, completely re-arranged version is like!!! don't rate it if you haven't made it!!! As written!!! AAAAAArrrrggghh!

None of you rated the recipe, just gave different recipes or your opinion on what it would taste like IF you had made it.

The trick with this receipe, use a firm to the touch, solid feeling fresh mango,sightly underripe is always better than fully ripe. Sprinkle salad lightly with salt, provide lim wedges for each diner and use a bottled catalina, or spicy tomatoe based dressing. I also used chunks of fresh pineapple and added some cooked prawns. Yum!

Gainesville - Thanks for the heads-up! I'm going to try this this weekend, and for new cooks who want to try it, here's what I'm going to do (I'm a very experience cook): Replace the rice vinegar with lime juice, and the crystalized ginger with plain fresh grated ginger - start with a small quantity, and taste as you add more until you get the amount of heat you like. I'd drop in a good tablespoon. I think that'll make a great dressing. Also watercress and mango? Eh. Try matching the smooshy mango and chicken with a crispy crunchy lettuce like an iceburg/romaine mixture.

Yuk. I am not even going to waste good ingredients on this! Came to this page thinking it would be a nice, light fresh ginger and orange, but savoury, dressing. Agree with first reviewer who it seems tried it. Too bad. I like the idea though, of chicken, mango and watercress, and might attempt a simple vinaigrette with fresh ginger and a squeeze of lime.

The dressing was way too sweet, and none of the flavors blended in a pleasant way.
