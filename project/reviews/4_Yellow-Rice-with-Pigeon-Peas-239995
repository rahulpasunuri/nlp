Good even with substitutions! Couldn't find the special peppers or the recao so used a big Anaheim pepper and some red pepper strips, and used double the cilantro called for. No annatto oil so used turmeric and smoked pork chop for the meat. My rice - California basmati - needed a lot more liquid. Rather than follow the recipe's rice cooking rules, I dumped the raw rice into the boiling liquids and meats, let it bubble for a few minutes, then added 2X the water for the rice, lowered the heat and let it cook down. Then, put it in the frig until next day, added more water and some vinegar to add zest, and baked the whole pot for an hour. The rice came out fluffy with a crisp crust and the flavors were rich but mild.

A flavorful, savory dish that could be a side or the main meal...definitely a keeper. Loved the flavor the olives and capers imparted. Found prepared Sofrito at the grocer's to save time; worked fine but will try making my own the next time. Annatto seeds simmered in oil for about 10 minutes-scooped seeds out and used oil. Another signature flavor for this delicious Puerto Rican dish!

Guests loved this dish. I made it to serve with pernil (Puerto Rican Pork Shoulder). I used sweet red pepper in place of the aji dulce and omitted the culantro. And I used annatto paste with olive oil in place of the annatto oil. Everything else was true to the recipe. I didn't buy sofrito because the only one I could find was the jarred Goya which has MSG in it. I can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch today!

This is an extremely flavorful and delicious dish. Like some of the other reviewers, I used frozen sofrito from the supermarket (Goya brand). It comes in tubs (12 oz. I think) and I used one tub, which turned out just right. Goya also makes sofrito in jars, but i haven't tried that. I have made this for holiday meals and dinner parties and it always gets rave reviews. Fantastic with the Epicurious Garlic-Roasted Pork Shoulder recipe. My only modification to the recipe is that since I could not find annatto oil, I used olive oil and a dash of the yellow coloring powder available in the spice aisle. Also great as leftovers!

Extremely close to my mother's and I dare say just as good. It was well recieved during my Christmas gathering and went very well with the Garlic-Roasted Pork Shoulder (pernil) also found on this site.

This dish is very good. However, since I like my rice very fluffy, I opted to try the recipe with parboiled rice instead of white rice. I thus used 2 cups of parboiled rice (ie Uncle Bens) and 2 cups 3/4 water. Believe me you do not need more water.

i thought this was amazing. yes, it was tough to find aji dulce and the culantro leaves but i eventually found it (i live in boston). It gave such an amazing depth of flavor. My only suggestion is to use a bit more water than it calls for because the rice seemed a bit hard. Overall amazing dish.

This rice was very good, although it entailed a bit of work. The only problem was finding the aji dulce to make the sofrito. I looked in 5 supermarkets that sell Latino products, as well as at the produce market in Grand Central Station. Since the NYC area has a large population of Puerto Ricans, I wonder how people in other parts of the country will be able to procure these particular peppers? (I used small peppers in place of aji dulce.)
