This is delicious! May be even better as leftovers. I did reduce the cream using only about 3/4 the recommended amount. For those worried about Kosher-ness, you could use veggie stock. Used farm share tomatoes, not sure it would have been as good with canned tomatoes. In the future I might roast the tomatoes for a few minutes to make them easier to peel.

DIVINE, though I changed so much. But the mint+tomato combination is to die for, and so is the velvety smooth texture. First, who is the magician who can get "4 to 5 pounds" of chopped tomatoes into 4 cups?! I see this inconsistency all the time in recipes. I'm gluten-free so I used arrowroot instead of flour, and I'm temporarily off dairy so I used olive oil instead of butter and coconut cream (from www.wildernessfamilynaturals.com) instead of heavy cream. My fresh mint leaves had already dried up so I used one third the quantity. I seeded the tomatoes but didn't peel (why bother?), and pureed them before adding to the pot so they would cook quicker. I didn't have a food mill, so I pureed the finished mixture and then just forced it through a strainer. That took forever since I had also first put the entire mixture in a blender, which made the mint so small it did a really good job of clogging the strainer, so next time I wouldn't do it that way. But here's the BIG difference: I didn't had ANY stock at all. I can't imagine watering it down like that! You get a lot less soup of course, but it actually tastes like tomatoes. I also added almost 2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1 tsp sea salt, and 1 tsp brown sugar. Absolutely gourmet-tasting result!

Here is someone to actually review the soup... if you haven't made it, take your soapbox elsewhere. I made it as directed, with the addition of a smallish shallot, and it was great! To thicken it a bit I added some minced pieces of 2 kaiser rolls. Don't skimp on the mint, it adds a very nice flavor. Actually, I just made a second pot and I left out some of the water and added more heavy cream, still good.

To Mr./Ms. Ginsburg from Scarsdale: You might want to ask your rabbi for a refresher-course. A soup that combines cream and chicken broth is a mixture of meat and dairy, and is therefore not remotely kosher. And while I don't usually sympathize with complaining reviews (as in, why did you use so much cream/butter? why isn't this vegan? where am I supposed to find X at my little small-town grocery store?), I agree in this instance: Rosh Hashanah is one of the two holiest days of the Jewish calendar. Nobody's requiring the magazine to honor it, but if you choose to do so, then honor the faith that supports it.

I'm no maven and haven't yet tried this recipe. but there is nothing non kosher about this "dairy" dinner.

to Chocolatl, There are many more Jewish people who do not keep Kosher and still prepare festive dinners for the holidays, than there are those who do. We greatly appreciate such tasty recipes!

I'm a Christian, but I see no reason why you would publish a recipe for Rosh Hashana that is not Kosher.
