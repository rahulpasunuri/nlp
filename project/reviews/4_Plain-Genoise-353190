This is the best, easy and rather healthier version! I needed a receipe for a Hungarian pastry that my granny couldn't "translate" for me into American measurment as she makes it by memory, you know what i mean. This is the closest and she even commented today that this is airier, softer and lighter than hers. No more said! (I do add 1 tbs. of vanilla extract, because the cake is bare, with just fruit. no creams etc.)

My new favorite cake base! So light and airy and the perfect base for fresh fruits. I made this exactly as the sheet recipe calls for, except I used all-purpose flour. I was thrilled with the way the sheet came out - easy to roll and the perfect pair for the strawberry roulade, especially since I could use the leftover egg whites for the meringue topping. I am excited to try out the chocolate version, very soon!
