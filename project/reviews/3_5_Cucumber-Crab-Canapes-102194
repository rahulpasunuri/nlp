So easy. Takes no time at all, which makes them a perfect canape. Also very tasty and very low carb.

These were great, a nice change from traditional canapes.

This was pretty bland and the mayo overpowered everything. BUT I think the problem may have been the crab. I used the regular crab in a can from the supermarket, which doen'st have a lot of good flavor. I would recommend getting fresh crabmeat for this.

Had to use regular cucumbers (middle of winter in MN, you know), and fake crab (shellfish-allergic guests), and it was still great. Plus, I think fake crab took care of the problems people had with fishy flavor and sogginess - we didn't notice either. So good and easy!

I was excited by this recipe because I was cooking for friends on a low carb diet and thought serving this on cucumbers would be great. I read the comments from others and bought fresh crab (easy to find in Seattle!), but I thought the appetizer was really bland and the mayo was very "weepy" on the cucumber rounds.

Bland until I added some cayenne.

FRESH CRAB ONLY! I made this with top quality canned crab meat and it was not good. Definitely fishy, even with extra lemon juice. Plus, it "wilts" quickly so as an appetizer, it has to be eaten right away. After an hour on a platter at a party, it looked pretty sad. Also, definitely use the Hothouse cucumber over regular cukes -- much milder texture that suits the crab.

Well, I bought the cheap stuff, $2. a can and it was excellent. You must use the English cucumber. Made the crabmeat mixture the day before.

This was four star, but the key to the success of this is to spend money on really good crabmeat. There is a canned grade that you can get that has absolutely NO cartilage and to me that is KEY. There is nothing more unpleasant than being excited about something that looks wonderful but then having to pick cartilage off of your tongue amongst the other guests. I got a one-pound can of Jumbo high grade for $37, but I served 40 guests and had enough to bring out a new serving plate of these three times, so it really goes a long way. The fake stuff is too sweet - it really was money well spent because all my guests raved.

This was so easy to make! Will be using this again for sure!

Loved this recipe and so did my guests. I used a finely minced shallot in place of the red onion and did not have fresh tarragon so I used dried. Taste was still outstanding. I also roasted and minced a red bell pepper and just added a few pieces on top of the crab for a nice presentation. I also scrapped all sides of the cucumber with a fork prior to slicing for a nice effect. Should have made a double batch though because these went fast and everyone was asking for more.

This was the biggest HIT!! Everyone raved about how wonderful it was & everyone asked for the recipe. I could not see using anything but real mayonnaise. Maybe Kimber didn't use enough salt & pepper to season.

I enjoyed this, but think next time I will try doing some thing different to "zip" it up a bit. Possibly substitute Miracle Whip Salad Dressing for the mayo, also. WILL make it again though, as it is just too easy to make and the friend who was over for dinner enjoyed it as well! KIMBER

Great recipe, simple and tasty, I will use partly peeled cucumber next time. Skin gets a little chewy.

A straight ahead recipe, nice color presentation and texture contrast. I agree with the previous reviewer to drain the crab as much as possible

The first time we made it, they became soggy. The next time, we wrapped the crabmeat in some cheesecloth, squeezed it dry, and let it drain until very dry. The recipe was excellent after that. Also, don't slice the cucumber too thin, or it's hard to pick up the canape.
