Delicious! Perhaps even idiot-proof! I've never made rabbit before, but given the difference in price between a rack of lamb and a rabbit I thought I would give it a try. I added a bit of extra garlic and followed another reviewer's advice to use the water from the shiitakes as the water for the recipe. I wasn't sure how to "cut rabbit into serving pieces", so I followed a youtube video on how to cut up rabbit- but it was large chunks. As a result I used some extra liquid to make sure everything was covered when it went into the oven for braising. I also left it to braise for almost two hours (since my oven wasn't reaching a high enough temperature for the first hour and I used extra liquid). The flavour was delicious- rich and not overly heavy at the same time. I will make this again.

Something spectacular happened with this dish that was so rich and satisfying it is hard to put into words. The sauce was incredible. The only change I made was to substitute half the shiitake mushrooms with baby bellas to keep cost down and make a more economical dish. While the shiitakes were clearly the better mushroom, the bellas were good too.

This was quite good, though I improved it the next day with the addition to the leftovers of a few tablespoons of cream. I don't add cream lightly to dishes but thought it needed it, and it was definitely much better. I made this dish in the slow cooker over a day. The sauce didn't thicken too much so not sure if this is why, but the rabbit was beautifully tender. I also substituted 1/2 button mushrooms, 1/2 dried chinese mushrooms (which are shiitake without the expensive price tag) and used the soaking liquid of the dried mushrooms in place of the water. Next time I'll boil the sauce down and add cream from the outset.

I reduced the bracon slightly and simmered 1 1/2 hours. Served over brown rice as another option. Excellent!

I've made this twice and it's been outstanding each time. I serve it with polenta and lima bean, with go well with the sauce. It is well work the time spent - and is even better the next day!

I have made this recipe four times and it is outstanding - even my teenage son likes it! We made it first while vacationing in Provence and were fortunate to secure a fresh rabbit at the local meat market and of course fresh herbs. I agree with those who comment that it needs to simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Enjoy!

i would have to disagree with the reviewer who claimed this recipe was a waste of rabbit. the taste and texture were uniquely "rabbit-esque"; much more toothsome than chicken, much more delicate than a red meat. asfter braising, the rabbit reminded me of the confit we make regularly when we're lucky enough to stumble upon a motherlode of bunnies--meltingly tender and assertive enough to stand up to the mushrooms and aromatics. we'll be making this again.

i loved this recipe. the mushrooms and garlic accented the rabbit nicely and the bacon gate it that something extraordinary. deviated slightly from the recipe by making my own pasta using half semolina flour and that was the perfect bed for the stew. served with the salad "spinach salad with grilled red onion and tahini vinaigrette". which was also excellent.

This recipe is only a rabbit recipe for the pride of serving rabbit; it is from recipes like this that the "it tastes just like chicken" cliche comes. Everything about it is geared towards disguising the rabbit's taste and texture. The taste is hidden behind pancetta, onions, and garlic; the texture is hidden because the meat is shredded off the bone after the time in the oven. Has anyone here tried this with tuna fish? There is also room to complain about the relative cost of ingredients. I paid about $6 for my frozen rabbit in NY chinatown, but about $7.50 for my shitakes. And, the recipe calls for a pasta form which is not sold in even pasta shops in NY. The dish, once brought to the table, had a taste that we could only describe as "brown." No flavor spoke to us, it all blurred. In short, this recipe has "vanity" written all over it!! (And it was a good four hours time from slicing mushrooms to serving.) (Oh, how I wish Epicurious would upload the Rabbit Provencale recipe from Gourmet in the late 80s. THAT was a good use of rabbit!)

This dish is time consuming to prepare but worth the effort. I used dried shiitakes because I think they're tastier, reconstituted, than fresh. (Also provides the chance to use the mushroom soaking water instead of plain water.) Next time I'll use porcinis -- it reads and tastes like an Italian recipe, and porcinis would be more authentic.

This is a great dish. I've made it a couple of times, and it was perfect. I would highly recommend this one.

This dish came out great! One of the points of discussion in the other reviews is how long the meat needs to braise in the oven. I cooked mine for 1 1/2 hours, and it was very tender. I followed the original recipe and forked the meat off of the bones. The sauce was a great consistency after the 10 minutes of simmering - no need to cook it down further. I served it with spaetzle. The only change I'll consider is draining off some of the bacon fat -- the dish came out rather rich.

To the extend that my review is relevant - this is very very good, the garlic actually adds a sweet and delicate flavor. I used red wine and red wine vinegar (since that's what I had on hand) and a mixture of white and crimini mushrooms, and it worked. I cooked it in a pressure cooker which I STRONGLY recommend; it took 15 mins for the meat to be tender. I removed the bones, and returned the meat to the pot. At this point I tasted the sauce - excellent. But because the recipe reminded me of an old family recipe (a one pot dish going back to the end of 19th century France), plus I noticed another reviewer's comment about serving this with mashed potatoes, I didn't stop. I added about 5 medium size peeled and cubed potatoes into the pressure cooker, and cooked for another 8 mins. after which the potatoes are tender enough to mash with a wooden spoon. Then I added the chopped liver, and fresh italian parsley. My son loved the "chicken stew", and asked me to make it again. I will - I love rabbit, even if I have to remove the bones to disguise it.

This is an excellent recipe. I have made it twice now and each time it was hit. Instead of Shiitake I use fresh button mushrooms and any vinegar will do. I would agree it needs more time to cook and that it is best to leave the meat as is on the bone when serving. I recommend simmering it slowly for at least 2 1/2 hours in a heavy skillet on top of the stove. I also recommend that at the end of the cooking to remove the rabbit and reduce down the sauce to a slightly more velvety consistency after squeezing in the garlic. I like serving it with creamy mashed potatoes.

This was indeed, a tasty dish. I served the meat on the bone, rather than forking it off. I would drain the pancetta or bacon to make this lower fat while you would still get the flavor of the pork. I served it to someone who had never tasted rabbit and they liked it quite a bit.

Found the dish very tasty, and not as garlic as you might think from the Ingredients. One observation was that cooking time for final phase, ( in oven) is more like 2 hours for tender meat.
