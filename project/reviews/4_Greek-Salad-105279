Solid greek salad recipe. No surprises and it delivers great flavour. I found barrel fermented Feta which I think made quite a difference. I passed on the parsley and added come capers,

Good basic recipe. This is one of those recipes that can be adapted in many ways. I added canned artichoke hearts, sun dried tomatoes in oil and carrot that I julienne, and fresh basil chiffonade instead of parsley. Instead of the olive oil I used the sun dried tomato oil to moisten. A keeper.

Very good and easy. I didn't bother to seed the vegetables as I was in a rush, otherwise followed as written.

Love this recipe. I always add romaine lettuce too. Have also tossed in garbanzo beans and it was great, and also tried chopped pepperonccinis. Great alone or with the kebabs.

We make the salad dressing and then marinade the veggies for up to 2 hours. We then add torn romaine lettuce, the olives and the feta, toss and when it starts to wilt, we stuff it into pita pockets. A delicious and healthy evening dinner! We even spread hummus on the inside of the pitas...Yum!!

Great fresh salad! I used most of the veggies straight out of my summer garden - sooo yummy. I can't wait to make it again!

After spending several days in Napa & Sonoma Valleys in CA, I visited many olive wineries & bought some award winning olive oil made with meyer lemons. This is the first dish I've tried it in & it was wonderful! Next time I'll use my sherry balsamic vinegar from CA with another olive oil from there.

Made this exactly as the recipe stated and it was fantastic. I suggest making this well ahead of time as it tastes much better after it's had a chance to marinade a bit. Excellent recipe.

How to improve on an already great 4 Fork rating? Make it more personal. I prefer mint to oregano, so substitute it for the oregano. I use little to no oil (just because). I prepare everything except the greens and add the vinegar and dash of oil, etc. to this, then pile these goodies on top of the un-dressed greens. In the greens department I prefer to use a European mix (radiccio, etc.) and a bit of some spinach. Croutons are a must for me, so I add those too. This recipe, as written, has made me happy many, many times and I recommend it to you, too. D.

I made this salad last week and it was fabulous! I put it in a big bowl and ate it for lunch at work all week. Just delicious. I added 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped, 2 tblsp fresh-squeezed lemon juice and 1 cup of quinoa--a grain similar to couscous, which gave all of the flavors and the vegetables a nice background. If you like couscous, I would definitely try it. I am making this salad again this week!

I am teaching a girlfriend how to cook so I chose this recipe as one of our first lessons. Wonderful, so easy and the flavors are very mild but distinct. I'm sure she can snare some hungry man with this recipe while showing off her newly acquired grilling skills with the kebobs. I added the rice pilaf to this meal and quartered fresh fruit covered with lime yogurt dressing for dessert. Oh, and thanks San Diego on tips for how to change the presentation for an authentic Greek Salad. Good to know for when I make this for my Greek friends.

Made this first time for "Greek theme" dinner for 12. Yum, with suggestions. Here's what I did to modify otherwise given recipe, following the basic directions, and for serving in large salad bowl: 6 very large, ripe tomatoes; 6 medium size cucumbers; 1/4 cup diced green (vs.red) pepper; 1/2 cup pitted kalamata olives; teaspoon balsamic vinegar. Might suggest using fresh oregano, and some lemon juice.Good as it is, I find this recipe lacks some of the pleasurable and memorable uniqueness of truly great Greek salads I've enjoyed. Ask a Greek heritage good cook about the missing touch?

I won't rate this, as I am making it today. I have to comment to the last reviewer. I am sorry you are so angered by the older reviews. If it insults you that a review from 3-4 years ago is still on the website ... don't read it. This salad sounds great. Really good Feta is key to salads like this one.

I served this at a summer dinner party as a first course, and everyone loved it. I must admit that I cheated on the dressing and used a red wine vinagrette. It's a good option if you're in a hurry, and it was delicious. I'm looking forward to having it again!

Wonderfully refreshing salad, perfect for fresh summer produce. I made it with the kebabs and loved them together. I added extra chopped parsley, and used whole kalamata olives b/c I didn't want to take the time to pit them - but I will pit and halve as recommended next time, b/c they add so much to the flavor. Next time, I'll also add minced garlic to the dressing.

I have made this recipe 4 times for summer parties and always get rave reviews. I added romaine lettuce once and my "regulars" concluded that it's better without lettuce. I always doctor up the dressing with more minced garlic and a bit of Dijon mustard.

I found this recipe lacking in several ways. Even after seeding and carefully draining the tomatoes after two hours in the fridge the salad was swimming in a sea of liquid. The feta should always be either sliced and place on the top of each serving or crumbled on top of each serving. Otherwise, I found the dressing lacking. Needed more oregano and prehaps some fresh mint. Probably won't make again.

This was a light, easy and delicious salad salad. I made two substitutions because of unavailabiltity : instead of the feta I used homemade Indian paneer cheese which has a similar consistency (especially when made at home) and used coriander instead of the Italian parsley. I did not use kalamata olives but good quality black olives (with pits).

Thanks for this simple recipe for one of my favourites. A great summer salad - I served with pork & chicken satay and tzatsiki & garlic butter brushed pita (also a great recipe on this site). My only suggestion is to leave the cucumber skins on -- if they are fresh & organic they make a very nice tasty crunch and look divine (I'd wash and nibble yours first though cuz if they are NOT fresh/organic they might well be bitter). Oh and I cubed (very small cubes) the feta throughout the salad, and crumbled some on top for presentation.

YUMMY!!! I dont care how authentic or unauthentic it is, it's Zingy-Zesty Good! this is my new favourite bring-along to summer gatherings as it holds very well for hours after being dressed (infact, marinating it for a while improves it). Be sure to buy top-quality produce, olives (NEVER buy olives that have been pitted - they lose thier flavour rapidly) and best-quality goat or sheep's milk feta for this recipe. Make your dressing with good X-V olive oil and you CAN NOT go wrong. I'm licking my lips just waiting to have this again on the weekend!

01/04/03; As an experianced cook, I tried this receipt for the first time. After making it and as always tasting it, I fealt it needed a little more 'BANG', so I added some VSOP Balsamic vinigar and some additional Feta cheese with Basil & Tomatoes. I also esed the 'new' sugar cherry toms cut in half. The mods I made made it a great side for the thick grilled lamb chops I had with it. I almost always start with someone else's receipt and modify to my own taste. Thanks again, jim herubin cummung, ga

i liked this reciped but i prefer my own version of Greek Salad. I use green pepers instead of red, but red peppers are perfectly fine. I also add shrimp which i marinate in lemon and oregano either a night before or atleast over 2 hours before. I add sweet baby tomatoes, cucumbers, green onions, and red onions in romane lettuce. I then add the juice of 1 lemon. I mix a box or two of crumbled feta cheese. I add a generous amount of balsamic vinegarette dressing and towards the end sprinkle oregano. Mix well and add salt or pepper as desired.

Other reviewers may not like what the Cook from San Diego (of the 2 weeks in Greece) had to say, but he/she is correct about the way Greek salads are made in Greece. Try it as San Diego outlined. Don't forget the kalamata olives, they're essential. Also, the green pepper, if used, is thinly sliced as is the onion.

Just got back from two weeks in Greece (and about 20 salads) and never had a salad with parsley or diced anything! The tomatoes should be quartered and the cucumbers thickly sliced. Red onion is thinly sliced. Don't toss anything either - let your guests put their own olive oil and vinegar. Last but not least, a thick slice of feta is placed on top of the salad, it is never crumbled. Green bell peppers (not red) are sometimes used. This may be tasty, but it is not a "Greek Salad."
