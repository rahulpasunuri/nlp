Excellent recipe! I followed another reviewer's advice about marinating in a sealed bag first (not overnight, just for an hour or so)-- it turned out great. Tonight (and 2nd time making this) I'm going to try using the broiler instead of the grill, per another reviewer's suggestion.

We raised grass fed beef so I was particularly worried that without marinating for 8 or so hours that it'd be tough but....NO! We doubled the sauce and marinated the meat for under an hour. Cooked the beef for six mins a side (not total unless you like beef sushi, not advisable unless you're eating beef like ours) and voila...PERFECT! The 8 - 10 yr olds at the table were especially enthusiastic...we finally had to say "ok, enough with the praise." Made it with basmatic rice and put extra sauce over that. Really great! Another reason why I continue to miss Gourmet magazine AND continue to not understand how that left our planet.

This is a go-to for us when grill season starts--but we ran out of fuel tonight and found out that broiling works just fine! Using some good crisp romaine leaves left whole allows you to make edible "boats"--fun finger food and very pretty. I don't find it necessary to marinade ahead; just follow as directed and then use the extra sauce for drizzling. Great with jasmine rice. Yum!

I really liked this recipe. Of course, I never follow a recipe to the 'T'. I used much more ginger, sesame oil, and added an onion (chopped). Sometimes I use KETJAP soy, an Indonesian sweet soy instead. I let the recipe soak overnight in a Zip-Lok bag without any air in it for full flavor. Yummm

Ok, so i'm the hero in my house after making this. My husband said it was like he was eating at an authentic Korean restaurant. And so easy! Broiled the steak instead and came out divine!

Excellent Flavour. My husband loved it too. Meat could have been a bit more tender but was still enjoyable. Tried it the next week on seared tuna steak but substituted the asian chili sauce with some wasabi paste. Was amazing! I heated the sauce so it wouldn't make the fish cold. I used the extra sauce as a dipping sauce for some dim sum dumplings we had steamed for our daughter.

I make this all the time!!! my friends and family love it and I love how simple it is. I also double the marinade but season veggie kabobs with it...the lettuce wasn't exciting enough for me. Perhaps I'll try some of these other good suggestions next time.

Very easy and tasty. I used ginger paste and only 1 t. of Sambal Oelek chile sauce. I also used skirt steak which absorbed the sauce beautifully as an after-grill marinade rather than having to marinade ahead of time as some reviewers did. This will become one of my "everyday" recipes.

Hands down - one of the best Grilled Flank Steak Recipes I've ever prepared - so tender. I did double the recipe and used half as a marinate for 1 hour as ginger is a natural tenderizer. I am planning to make this again this summer when we entertain, smells fabulous on the grill!!!

I love this recipe but I made just a few changes. I doubled the amount of sauce, marinated the meat in a ziplock overnight and reduced the leftover marinade to make a thicker sauce. Served sliced thin in lettuce cups. Fabulous.

Definately marinate the steak first. I also added red bell pepper,sliced cucumber, cilantro and mint to the salad mix

Very quick to make and exceptional flavor. The flank steak can be somewhat tough so i suggest using round steak or beef for stir fry.

I made this as written and was pleasantly surprised. I lack flair when it comes to cooking steak of any kind or variety, and I found this is to be extremely easy for a weeknight meal. I did not feel that the steak suffered from not marinating it first. We tried to eat the steak in the lettuce wrap but found it too messy so we ate it the old fashioned way with a fork and knife. I would probably add more ginger next time.

We loved this recipe...best flank steak recipe I have made so far! Our only changes were to marinate the meat first and to use low sodium soy sauce. This is easy to make and delish with brown rice and steamed broccoli. Give it a try!

I also marinated my steak before grilling. It was a very flavorful dish.

Adding sake gave it a better flavor and took away some of the salt.

Hi.I tried this recipe some time last year.It has potential, but not as is.!st the flank or ribs needs a longer time cooking to be tender,or it will get dry or burn.I would suggest that yes first use not too salty soya sauce.Then put the flank or short ribs aloready marinated into aluminum foil, wrap well and place on tray in oven on just below med heat.allow to cook, then open the foil and broil for a few minutes.Thats how I did it the second time, and it was good.but the recipe as is was not good.Hope this will help you.

This is kind of a "poor-man's" bulgogi. Like the previous reviewer, I used some of the sauce as a marinade. Definitely need to use the low-sodium soy sauce, otherwise WAY too salty. I thought it was "good", but probably won't make again.

I tried this last night for a Fireworks BBQ at the beach. I must admit, I was concerned about the lack of marinade for the meat, so I used the marinade listed in the "Grilled Korean-Style Steaks" from this website, with the sauce from this recipe. The combination was delicious, and eating the meat in bibb lettuce leaves was particularly handy for a picnic bbq. Note that the 4 forks reflects the altered recipe with marinated meat - maybe I will get brave and try it without marinade.
