Add minced garlic & a hot pepper or red pepper flakes

I, too, added vinegar, as well as some of the blanching water to keep this from being so dry. But it's very tasty, and it's a good basic recipe one could easily adapt by using different greens, different types of mustard, nuts, raisins, sausage, etc. to make this a very hearty side with a little more going on in it.

I'm always looking for new ways to serve greens - and the concept of this recipe is excellent. However, there isn't enough moisture in 2T of grainy mustard with this much kale - nor enough flavor. Next time I would add more mustard - or in my case, I used a great apple cider vinegar to give it additional punch. Used pancetta instead of bacon - very tasty.

OUTSTANDING! If you're looking for a very well-rounded, spicy kale dish, don't look anywhere else. A little pepper, a little hot sauce ... all set.
