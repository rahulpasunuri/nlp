This recipe makes a beautiful pale orange sherbet with flavors of lemon and licorice enhancing the cantaloupe to yield a perfect summer treat. I did not have Pernod and didn't want to buy it, so I used another liqueur (Midori, hoping the melon-flavored liqueur would only boost the melon flavor of the fresh fruit). If you do not have Pernod, definitely add star anise or a few anise seeds. Another reviewer was reasonably cautious about the liquorice flavor of Pernod and how it would work with the melon, but the combination is heavenly, giving the sherbet a depth of flavor without overwhelming the melon. I will make this recipe every time I have overripe cantaloupe, as it is so delicious, refreshing, and beautiful.

This turned out pretty good. I did not use the Pernod because it did not sound good, so I replaced it with rum. I also added 1/3 cup of whipping cream. This made it a bit more creamier. My husband loved it, so it will be made again. The cantaloupe flavor was so powerful and wonderful.
