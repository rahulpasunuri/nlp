Easy to assemble, for zing add 1 tsp. diced habanero, for crunch add 1/2 cup diced cucumber, for ease use 10 frozen cilantro cubes from Trader Joe's. Voila! Great for picnics when you don't want to fuss with the heat from the oven and a baked bean dish.

Take negative reviews "with a grain of salt". This is a great, healthy recipe with subtle but yummy flavors. Do add salt and freshly ground black pepper. I served along with an avacado. Perfect for lunch or light supper.

I thought this was rather bland. It needed more as a base...like some kind of grain. Everyone took a taste, but I ended up throwing this one away.

I like making this salad because I don't have to cook anything, and everyone loves it! To give the salad a kick, I use canned habeneros instead of (or addition to) mild chili's.

This salad tasted fine but was a bit bland for me. I added salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and some curry for a bit more of a kick and it was really good.

This was good, but not spectacular. I followed the recipe exactly, and, based on reviews, expected a wonderful salad. I'll try it again -- maybe it's just me -- but I wasn't wowed.

This dish mas magnificent.... I added cucumber for a nice crunch. Great side dish for chicken tiki masala, another indian dish.

Spices and chiles overwhelm the garbanzo beans. YUCK!

This was delicious. My neighbors who claimed they did not usually like garbanzo beans had seconds. A nice, refreshing and flavorful salad.
