This was so easy and so yummy! It looks as good as it tastes. I used non-stick foil and had no problem at all with sticking. I also added salt and pepper to the layers. After turning it out onto the serving platter I topped it with a bit of Parmesan and fresh, chopped chives.

The foil stuck to my potatoes. I would butter the foil or spray it with vegetable cooking spray next time. I tried to invert the pan onto a platter. The beautiful brown crusty potatoes stuck to the bottom of the pan, while the rest slid all over the serving plate. Definitely not the beautiful potato cake I was hoping for! What did I do wrong?

My foil stuck to the potatoes -- I think buttering the foil first or spraying it with vegetable cooking spray would be a good idea. I *tried* to invert mine. The beautiful brown crusty potatoes stuck to the bottom of the pan while the rest slid all over the serving platter. Not the attractive dish I was hoping for! What did I do wrong?

Oh wow, these were terrific. Sliced extra thin on the mandoline, and made one cake with three layers and another with four (slight misunderstanding as to how many potatoes constitude two pounds). Put them together -- yum! Salted and peppered all layers, and they reheated beautifully. Tasty and beautiful and -- I can say this after whipping up a second batch on the spur of the moment! -- really not as hard as you think.

There are a few things that will help for this dish to have tons of flavor, after all, everyone loves pommes frites which is very similar with oil instead of butter. The main ingredient to making sure the dish is savory is the salt, make sure to layer salt in with every other layer (the more layers, the more impressive the anna). Also, the amount of starch changes with the age of the potato, but the easiest way to negate that, is to slice the potato as thinly as possible on the mandoline (food processors will make them far too thick and have many gaps between the layers which are very unattractive. After baking, I always press the Anna with off-set spatulas to ensure there are no gaps, and then I cool the whole things down in the fridge. I later heat the bottom of the skillet on the stove while using a cake spatula to release it, flip it, and cut it into individual servings which can be easily reheated in the oven over the next five days for dinner. A very technical dish, but well worth the effort to do it right.

I made this tonight to high praise . . . even from my son who generally despises all roasted or baked potato dishes. The reviewers who complain about bland seem to not realize that pommes anna is, of course, potatoes . . . you want to pair them with something highly seasoned. Dry your potatoes and season with salt and pepper and this is no fail.

Gorgeous and delicious, and surprisingly fast and easy. This makes a beautiful presentation for a dinner party. A few tips: 1) use clarified butter to avoid scorching in the oven, 2) use plenty of salt and pepper as you layer, 3) don't omit the stovetop step--it'll give you a beautiful golden crust. Your guests will really be impressed!

The key to this recipe is drying the slices of potato before you arrange each one in the pan....that way you still have the starch necessary to bind them together and they won't scatter, as others have experienced. I sliced about half a potato at a time, drying each slice with a tea towel before arranging in a circle in the buttered pan. I used a non-stick Le Creuset skillet and weighted them with a cake pan filled with pie weights....starting off on the stove gives a nice brown bottom to the finished product, which is attractive if you flip it over onto your serving plate. I didn't need all the butter called for, but maybe it is a good idea to have on hand if you decide to make a deeper one...I only made three layers so it ended up crisp and perfect, sliding right out of the pan after baking.

I make this in a non-stick wok shaped pan. I have made this several times and have always ended up with a beautiful domed shaped crusty mound of potatoes. I add garlic and rosemary to the butter. I have also used different layers of potatoes. ie. purple, sweet potatoes. When cut into wedges it is quite impressive.

Probably wouldn't make it again, I can't get the potatoes to cake. When I invert the pan onto a platter, they just slide all over the place. To the reviewer who took exception to the name, you might want to take it up with the French, who call their very own fried potatoes "pommes frites". Those crazy French, how they mangle the use of their own language...wacky!

Good recipe, but Pommes Anna (Apples Anna)? How about Pommes de Terre Anna (potatoes Anna). Ah, Americans and their use of other languages!

This is an easy, delicious way to prepare potatoes. The cooks who complained that this dish was bland must have done something wrong. My best guess is they omitted or didn't use enough salt & pepper. Too bad for them. I make potatoes this way often, and my family always loves them. :)

i wanted some sort of baked potato dish since we had the oven on for meatloaf and this sounded like it would work fine. i added a little basil for flavor and left the skins on since that is our preference. it came out pretty as a picture but i have to agree with others--it was bland! i think we just aren't pommes anna kind of people.

Not a big fan of peeling potatoes but it was definitely worth the effort. Like others I clairified the butter. So few ingredients, so tasty.

I remember making these many years ago and baking in a dish instead of a skillet. I found this preparation to be easier and produce a better browning effect. I did use clarified butter which prevented burning. It makes a pretty dish and went well with the beef tenderloin I prepared for Christmas Dinner.

I served this for Christmas dinner with baked ham...my husband thought it was mediocre at best and lacked flavor. My brother eats seconds and thirds of EVERYTHING and he barely touched it. Maybe I'd add more herbs/spices next time or Gruyere. Too much like fried potatoes for the effort.

This recipe was a hit with all ages. I used a well seasoned black steel frying pan. The only recomendation I have is to spray the foil with some Pam spray since it stuck a bit to the potatoes. I also baked it a bit more after the 30 minutes and removed the foil and the weight to brown the top more. A great classic French preparation that went so well with the braised chicken with tarragon vinegar (also on Epicurious) that originally ran together in Gourmet.

Very good and easy. I left the skins on and used olive oil instead of butter. I also baked in a pyrex baking dish instead of cast iron, and didn't bother with the oven proof sauce pan weight. Sprinkled in diced onion and paprika as well. Mmmmm!!

Wonderfully easy! My family LOVED this. Be sure to use a well-seasoned cast-iron skillet. Clean up is quick and it will brown & crisp the potato to perfection.

While I enjoyed the simplicity of this dish, my partner thought it was boring (he does that a lot.) Using clarified butter was definitely a good thing. Maybe next time I'll indulge him and add some reggiano and garlic.

This is a great, impressive recipe. Once suggestion - use clarified butter. It will help prevent scorching and sticking, and will dramatically improve presentation.

I've made this twice, while it tastes great, it doesn't always look great, because it sticks - even with more butter.
