This was a lot of work but absolutely delicious. Used the lesser amount of oil 1/4 cup and did the salt and pepper and lemon juice after it had been run through the food processor. Forget the food mill. Used two fresh dungeness crab and kept the shells. I used all the lobster and shrimp shells as well however to save time I tied them up in cheese cloth and suspended them in the stew while simmering. I also tied the thyme and oregano sprigs together with a string and tossed them in as well, leaving the parsely sprigs loose in the base. I also added four yukon gold potatoes that I had quartered and mesquite smoked. After simmering for an hour I let the whole pot sit overnight before reheating. I then quickly and easily pulled out all the shells,bundled spice sprigs, and bay leaves before pureeing the stew base in batches in a food processor. I also had a nice chunk of fresh halibut with the skin on which I cut into 1-1/2" squares leaving it attached to the skin. I then smoked that as well. Before serving I popped the halibut off the skin using only the white meat and used that as the center piece in the bowl placing the rest of the seafood around it and then sprinkling crab meat over all that and topping with a bit of parsely. Was a major hit with our eight guests.

First of all, this was a herculean effort on my part. I just finished a dinner party for nine where this was served, and I have to say that I think I could have halved the recipe and still had leftovers. The person who commented they spent "over $100" on the ingredients (while back in 2003) was lucky...our food bill was well over $300. So, my advice is cut this recipe in half and save some serious cash. Ok, maybe you can splurge for the second lobster. But you save considerable time at the very end as I had nowhere near enough bowls to put all this sauteed seafood as it was coming out of my giant skillet; thank goodness I had one of those, too! Also, I will NOT make this again without procuring a food mill. The sieve method is nigh impossible to get the fish to pass through (I broke my sieve at about 1 AM, causing a tsunami of fish stock across my kitchen) and I about cried at having to throw out so much of the red snapper meat; especially at $14.99/lb. Everyone commented how filling this was, and considering I had an appetizer, a salad, and dessert, I think this proves you could go with a half recipe, especially if you use the food mill and spring for the crab. The crab made an excellent addition to this recipe, and I can't imagine making it again without it. I'll probably have to wait ten years to recouperate from this experience, but I'll definitely consider this for my next big seafood-lovers' party!

I served 11 people with this 8-serving recipe tonight. It has a wonderful base, velvety, yet just enough zip from the red pepper. I first made this recipe one week ago on a trial run and learned a few important things. First, DO NOT use 1-1/4 cups of oil (as called for) unless you like an oil slick covering your soup. Reduce the oil to 1/4 cup and it's perfect. Second, the base needs seasoning with salt & pepper after reduction. Third, to brighten the flavors, squeeze some fresh lemon juice into the base after reduction. Guaranteed to impress and delight. I served it with a tossed green salad, crusty rolls, and wine. A lot of work, but what a wonderful meal!

I agree with the last reviewer, it's much simpler and just as tasty to simmer the seafood that way...

OK, I read all of the reviews and I was very excited about this recipe and planned a nice party for 8. I am a good cook and followed the recipe to a T and this is what I experienced: I have always made a simple Cioppino with sauteed vegetables, tomato, wine, basil and thyme and then poached the seafood in the hot broth to rave reviews. Although this dish is good, (delicious) it is not superior to a simpler method. I spent over $100 in ingredients and could have saved myself $75 for similar results. I suggest however, if you do make this. skip the flour on the seafood and poach all fish in the bubbling broth. Serve with sourdough and enjoy.

This is the very best I have ever had! My husband and children feel the same way. It is very time consuming and expensive but well worth it. This is on my menu for my next dinner party!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.

This was very delicious and great for a special occasion. But it was costly and ver time consuming. It made enough for 10 servings. I would suggest 4 jumbo shrimp per person. 2 pounds was way too much.

The first time around, we all spent a long time deveining shrimp, but the results were worth it. Then on we bought the smallest (and of course way cheaper than the originals) unpeeled fresh shrimp available and used them to make the stew base, while using raw frozen peeled and deveined shrimp for serving. The result was just as good, and far less complicated to make

3 suggestions: Make sure your food mill really is sturdy, dry off the seafood well before flouring it, and this dish can use some added salt. Lot of work, but good.

It was quite involved to make... but worth the effort. We had several guests and it was a little hard to do the "last minute" preparation. I think it was very good.

Absolutely delicious, absolutely a lot of work, and absolutely expensive. But we ate well. To the cook from Cooperstown -- I happen to find value in any recipe reviews, even when people change a recipe and report back on their findings, whether positive or negative. It only adds to the knowledge base of a recipe. But for you to moan about people who do that, and in the same sentence to admit that you have made not fewer than 6 changes is plain stupid. And then you have the nerve to say that the broth needs more texture when you've already said you didn't use all the fish which GIVES THE BROTH TEXTURE as the recipe directs. Give me a break.

Well, I'm giving this top marks based on the response of my family to it. They loved it. They raved. My read of the recipe led me to expect something else. I changed it a bit by adding Dungeoness crab as well as the lobster, and I didn't feel up to putting all that fish in the stew base. I think that may have been my mistake. Without the fish the stew base tastes mostly of clam juice, while I was expecting something richer. My bad. Next time I think I'll skip the clam broth and make a fish stock.

Wow. My daughter is a great cook but she hadn't worked much w/ shellfish... so this was something we had great fun making together... I stuck almost completely to the original recipe (since the people who write in here and say "well, I didn't have 3/4 of the ingredients and I changed 11 things, but I did not like this" drive me crazy)... but we DID use fresh crab... extra lobster... and saved some of the fish (no red snapper so we did use cod) to use whole... Also, we could not resist mussels which added great flavor and were pretty. The broth was spectacular... yes i agree it could use more texture, but the aroma and taste were fabulous... Also, we made a garlic aioli and topped each bowlful with a dollop. Heaven at sea!

agree with wisc. I love mussels and little neck clams which i simmered in base till they opened. discard any that do not open. scrub and debeard mussels, scrub little necks before adding to base.

It is full and rich. Something not found in the "Too busy to cook" scheme.

I learned an authentic Cioppino recipe in Boston's North End which I thought was unbeatable. I was wrong. This version is incredible.

I agree with comments fr Wisconsin. Nice thing abt this recipe is that it is less garlicky than some Mediterrean fish stews. Also, the recipe can serve 10-12, especially if you reserve some of the snapper for the final stew and not the stock. Next time I make it I will add some fennel as well as tomatoes for texture and taste.

Thank you Wisconsin from California. This will be my 1st try ~ Appreciate the suggestions!

I tested this recipe before serving it to friends - I made a few changes the second time. I felt it needed more texture, so left some of the fish whole and some of the tomatoes whole. Instead of 2 lobsters, I used 1 lobster and 1 tail. When reheating the base, I added a small can of whole Italian style tomatoes, coarsley chopped - again, for texture and more of an Italian flavor. I eliminated the crab - too expenxive - not enough taste. The final result - all seven guests asked for the recipe!!! It was truly a special and outstanding dish. Vert expensive, but worth it for that special occassion. An avid fan from Cudahy.
