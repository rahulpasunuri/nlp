I can only vouch for the braised lamb and winter squash portions of the recipe which I made to go along with some leftover risotto. It was, for me, an unwieldy meat to work with, but the lamb shanks turned out beautifully. Like many previous users, I didn't discard the vegetables. Instead, I incorporated them into the sauce which was rich and oh-so-tasty. The winter squash was nice, but not as memorable as the lamb. Would make the lamb itself again.

Made this for Sunday dinner. It was a lot of work, but but worth it. Did what others suggested and blended vegetables to thicken the sauce, my husband said he would have eaten the vegetables whole - next time, will blend half and keep half as is.

One of my very favorite dinner party recipes. Always impresses and gets rave reviews!

The lamb and chard turns out quite tasty. I fiddled with the proportions on nearly everything, using what was on hand (2 lamb shanks, a bag of carrots from the local market, etc.), this is definitely a nice recipe for using up what's in the fridge. Only caveat was that we only ate the chard and lamb...I had to cook the lamb on the bottom rack because the pot I used was very tall, and that must've been too close to the element for the squash, which came out hopelessly charred.

I made this with fresh skinless turkey thighs the butcher cut for me. It was divine. I was a little reluctant to use all the cinnamon and orange peel, so I cut back a little. The sauce was absolutely delicious, but not overpowering, so next time I will use the full amount. We're looking forward to the leftovers tonight. Can't wait to make for company.

I am making this yet again for a dinner party and simply had to add my comment. People who don't eat lamb have asked me for this recipe. I recently had lamb shanks at one of the top restaurants in Vancouver.. and this recipe is much better! It was the first recipe I ever used for Lamb shanks and it will probably be the only recipe I ever use. One note I always make 2 extra so that we can have them reheated for dinner the next day..and like another reviewer I simply throw all the veggies into the processor and get a really thick rich sauce.

I've made this dish several times and love it each time that I make it. It is always a hit and I get nothing but raves from my guests. I always use a good bottle of wine and then serve the same wine at dinner. This is a family favorite.

We loved this dish. I have never done shanks before but I will definatly be making them now! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I just couldn't bring myself to strain out those delicious vegetables. I served them with the sauce over the shanks. This is a real cold weather comfort dish.

I also made this for an informal dinner party. It was a great hit. I followed the directions exactly except that I did not strain the braising liquid (I did not want to throw out the vegetables) and served the chunky sauce along with the shanks. Will be making this again and again.

I made this recipe for a dinner party of 10 people, so I had to more than double it. I followed it to the letter and it was a huge success and everyone loved it! I didn't change a thing except to thicken the sauce a little. I will definitely make this dish again and again.

My luck in the kitchen isn't something to depend on dinner for. But I am adventurous so I tried this with some friends and we were all WOWED! Now my critical husband is taking it on and adding this step:from the point of straining the liquid, etc. take the vegetables and caramelize them. Deglaze the caramelized veggies with the strained liquid and plate away! If you like lamb, try this exquisite dish!

Very easy to make. I was quite surprised by how good this was. It definitely looks like one of those dishes that you put a lot of effort into- I would make this for my next dinner party. The squash was particulary good.

My boyfriend told me that he didn't like lamb, but I have made this for him several times now and he still requests it. It does take time and that's why it's become our favorite sunday football dish.

A fabulous recipe for lamb...didn't have shanks so used boneless butterflied leg of lamb and cut it into serving size pieces. Used cab-shiraz as the wine and served same with it. Outstanding ovations on this meal. It's easy...can do a lot of this ahead of time...Try this one..it's superb!!

Yummy, I agree with Maunalis. Blending the veggies results in a wonderful rich sauce. Next time I will use boneless leg of lam.

I made this recipe for my birthday last year and included among my guests were two friends who did not particularly like lamb. I might add that I had never cooked lamb. But the picture on the cover of the October issue was so appealing and the ingredients looked so interesting that I just had to try it! I actually put together a cookbook of my own for Christmas last year of all the favorites of my friends that we had made during the years and when I gave them out during our Christmas get-together they all wanted to know if this recipe was included. They loved it especially the 2 who didn't really like lamb! It was a hit! And not difficult to make.

Too Fabulous!!!! Instead of leaving the garlic unpeeled, take the extra prep time to peel so when you want to sieve the lovely juces, carrots, onions etc you can just throw it in a blender and make a wonderful thick sauce. Will make it again and again.

This is an easy and very tasty recipe. I recommend it.

Absolutely gorgeous, and fantastic for a dinner party because you can make it in advance and keep it warm while you do the starter. I served this with roasted garlic mashed potatoes, green beans and roasted butternut squash and my guests raved!

This is an outstanding recipe for lamb shanks. I actually defat the shanks before cooking them. I also double the recipe and bake the shanks for 3 hours. The cinnamon and orange add delightful flavor and spice to the meat. The final cooking of the sauce, which the recipe calls for 15 minutes, actually takes about 75 minutes to reach the desired consistency. I've made this recipe three times now, all to my and our guests' delight.

A wonderful dish for company - unlike some other cooks, I found the prep time to be negligible, especially considering the quality of the end product. And because only one pot is used, clean up is minimal, so guests aren't stuck looking at a messy kitchen as the finishing touches are put on dinner. Although it is an easy recipe, do allow for enough time. The braising liquid reduced too quickly in the oven. At first I compensated by adding water, then I put a lid on the pot for the last 45 minutes. I found it crucial to keep the dish uncovered for as long as possible - it allows for a flavorful, caramelized surface. As for the fennel bulb and fennel seed added at the end, it did give the dish complexity, but might not be to everyone's liking. I would suggest ommitting it, and reducing the orange zest by half to suit a broader range of tastes.

I served this recipe to my fiance on his birthday. He was astonished! He is a lamb-lover anyway, and the meat was so tender it fell off the bone and melted in our mouths. I served it with a sticky vegetable risotto and vintage red wine, perfect for a crisp fall evening in front of a raging fire. The contrast of different colored vegetables (red peppers, green onions, and carrots) and the dark lamb against the white arborio rice really makes for a grand presentation. Now, every time we have a special occasion, my fiance asks, "Are you going to make that lamb again?"

I disagree with the some of the reviews! It does take time, but I feel definately worth it! I have made this several times for company and it gets rave reviews. It is important to turn the shanks OFTEN during braising however. I do not make the chard, I serve with mashed potatoes and green beans. Love this recipe!

Considering that this recipe requires a good 4 hours of total prep/cooking time, the results were pretty mediocre. I'll admit the sauce wasn't bad, but it just isn't worth the effort, especially with all the ingredients required. The squash and red chard were great, though.

This will be the third time I have prepared this. I panicked when I could not find the recipe but am at ease now as you provided it for me. It is a fun dish for company as it can all go on a platter on the table making it more informal.

Unfortunately, I went against my better judgement and braised, as the recipe requested, without the lid. This resulted in about 1 cup of liquid/stock remaining to serve as a sauce. Luckily, I had another 4 shanks in freezer---but I was forced to make the entire recipe again (a lot of work), this time braising with lid on, to have enough liquid/stock remaining to make a decent sauce for the finished shanks. Definately braise with lid on!!

I made this dish for an Autumn Feast dinner party, and everyone absolutely raved about it. Bon Apetit said it was easy, and it was, but it still took most of the day to prepare, but it was worth it. The reduced gravy was fabulous, and the shanks were as tender as could be.

So I glad I tested this on my husband and myself before I made it for company! It was a ton of work for a very weak result. I especially thought the braising without a lid was silly. All that basting when braising is usually so easy; just put the ingredients together and put the whole thing in the oven. The meat was much tougher than you expect with braising and for all the ingredients the dish was very bland. No zip! Even my husband (who normally LOVES braised lamb shanks) gave this one the thumbs down. It's not worth the effort. There are many great lamb shank recipes out there.

Very good. Not greasy, and no more time consuming than any other braising recipe. Once in oven no more work. However, I don't think the fresh fennel is needed at the end, or the orange peel. The juice/sauce WITH veggies tasted great, and I took out the garlic halves, and served them.Next time I'll keep juice as is. Used polenta and brocolli rape instead, and a good Cabernet. Got requests for a repeat.

I made this dish over a month ago and my husband is STILL raving over it. Oh my god was all we could say as we ate it. Will definitely make again!!

Undoubtedly, the best Braised recipe I have made thus far. However, the preparation was unrelenting, but well worth the endless raves I received from my dinner guests. I recommend a brilliant dry red from the Medoc region and warm crusty bread be served with this dish. Enjoy...I am certain that you will.

A lot of work but enjoyed by all. Will definitely do again.

I thought it was a lot of work for a so so dish. It was greasy even though I took all visible fat from the sauce. The Chard and squash were good and I will ake them again but not the lamb shanks.

This dish was so delicious I'm at a loss for words. The aroma in the house was so amazing that people from outside were comming in to see what I was cooking. I thought the ingredients were a little strange together, so I was unsure how this recipe would turn out. For security I also made Baked Penne with Wild Mushroom Ragout (also from this sight), turned out the 2 of them served together made an unbelievable meal. I have saved this to my recipe box and will make again and again. A keeper for sure!!!!

WOW! Absolutely delicious. Took me a while to find decent lamb shanks, so preorder them from your butcher if possible. Perfect for a cool/cold night. My wife could'nt stop raving about them. Only change to recipe was that it took me a little bit longer to reduce the sauce before it was ready for serving and I added a bit of brown sugar to the squash. Great with crusty bread and a nice French red.

Delicious and a great hit. Allow plenty of time for both cooking and preparation.
