Surprised by some of the negative reviews. I made these today...I did serve the bacon on the side as I do not like bacon inside my waffle or pancake. They didn't exactly crisp up but the flavour was exceptional and they were surprisingly fluffy for a cornmeal based waffle. A couple of tips...use a fine cornmeal as coarser ones don't soften up quickly...and make sure you are using fresh leaveners and that you are using buttermilk or other acidic dairy component (kefir, yogurt, sour milk). This will be going into our regular hot breakfast rotation. A winner

A little too crunchy (i.e., gritty) from the cornmeal (Bob's Red Mill medium). My husband liked it better than I did. Cooked up crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I used thin-sliced bacon, not thick. I think I'll just add the crumbled bacon and maybe a tablespoon of the cornmeal to my favorite recipe (Joy of Cooking).

Waffles didn't crisp up. Flavor was pretty bland. Wouldn't make again.

delicious! the combination of the cornmeal's crunch and the surprising bacon flavor really sets these waffles apart. followed the recipe to the letter except for replacing 1 tbsp butter with applesauce. must serve them right away or keep them warm in oven, though, as they go soggy very quickly (or could be my waffle iron?).

These were great. I made them for a brunch per the recipe except I used Morningstar Veggie Bacon instead of real meat bacon. No one knew! I loved the crunch of the cornmeal and the great bacon flavor. You couldn't really taste the maple syrup in them. But everyone thought they were great and loved the idea of a savory waffle.

Delicious, quick and easy. Didn't have bacon, and used half butter/half canola oil. Thank you! We found a new breakfast recipe!

To the cook from Milwaukee, try separating the eggs and beating the whites till stiff, then fold them in at the end. This is the way the Belgians do it, and you can try this trick with any of your other waffle recipes. Also, modern teflon-coated waffle irons just don't produce the same crispy result as traditional cast iron. Good luck!

Not bad. I wanted to make a different kind of waffle and these fit the bill. I used light syrup instead of maple and we thought these we're not sweet enough. I did have to add about 1/3 cup of sugar. If I do make again, I'll have real maple syrup around. Brushing butter on the waffle iron everytime I made another batch really helped make them crispy.

An excellent and easy waffle recipe. The cornmeal is fantastic; it gives them a great crunch. I've also done them omitting the bacon and adding blueberries for a sweet versus savory take. Either way is excellent.

My entire family enjoyed these waffles. I used a Sunbeam easy-clean waffle iron, and they turned out perfectly! I did not grease the waffle iron.

Our family really enjoyed these. I used a pound of browned breakfast sausage in the batter in place of the bacon (what I had) and it worked well. My three year old couldn't get enough of the. I used a Belgian waffler and the recipe only made three waffles, but that was enough for my family.

Not for me: I found these waffles to be heavy and greasy. I either served them too soon (not crisp) or too late (too crunchy and no lightness in the middle). This was not my first time making waffles so I believe it is the recipe that didn't work for me. I much prefer the recipe in the Joy of Cooking. My husband said he would prefer the bacon on the side of the waffle and not inside.

Such a great combination of flavors! How could you not like these? That said, I need help from all you fellow cooks (seriously, please, no rudeness). Why is it that I can't seem to get my waffles nice and crispy around the edges? If I cooked them longer they'd be burnt. I wonder if I need a new waffle maker? Any suggestions?

This was a hit with the our brunch crowd. It's just like my grandmother made years ago. The extra crunch is delightful!
