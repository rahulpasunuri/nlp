I really love this recipe, although I followed several other reviewer suggestions and used baby yukon gold potatoes (unpeeled), 2 leeks instead of an onion, 2 carrots instead of one, 4 cups vegetable broth and 1 cup water, along with 2 cups heavy cream. I also used 4 ears of corn, 1 whole roasted poblano pepper and a long hot pepper. I used an immersion blender but kept the consistency rather chunky. The flavors really came through. I usually don't use heavy cream in recipes but decided to go for it, and I think it paid off.

I'd give this 3 forks, but, as other reviewers have said - there is WAY too much bland broth if you follow the recipe. Instead of 2 quarts of water, I use 2 cups of vegetable broth. I also put some of the soup in the blender before serving to give it a thicker texture. With these changes, it's the favourite chowder recipe in the house, and I make it all the time.

I doubled this recipe but had the foresight to reserve the cooking liquid. There is way too much liquid in this recipe. I cooked the potatoes and corn cobs in chicken broth. After I cooked the corn and other veggies I added the cream but only about 1/4 of the chicken broth. There was still plenty of liquid. I added a couple of small chopped red peppers which gave it some zing.

Took others' advice by using 5 cups chicken broth and 2 cups cream. Also thew in half a roasted poblano instead of the red pepper. Kind of boring...lacking complexity.

We loved this chowder! Will definitely make it again.

This was great! The only change that I made was to add crispy bacon crumbles over the top just before serving. My toddler said "yummm" after each bite, and he ate so much he was in a food daze after dinner. I'll be making this again.

Very good, added bacon and leeks to the recipe. Used 1 quart chicken broth 1 quart water, next time will use all chicken broth.

I reserved and used 4 cups of the water used for boiling potatoes and corn. I also added a jalapeno pepper when I added other peppers. I think it could still use more flavor and I recommend using some chicken stock or vegetable stock as others have suggested. I used the 3 cups of heavy cream and I recommend others do as well. Heavy cream is the only dairy liquid that can handle boiling without curdling. Milk and Half/and half cannot. If you do use other milk products, just simmer the soup do not bring it to a gentle boil.

This turned out delicious, but I did make a couple adjustments. I adapted the recipe to what was in my pantry and fridge in two ways. First, I had no cream in the house so I substituted a can of coconut milk for the cream. Second, since I only had two cobs of corn I wanted to make sure each cornel was prominent in each bite. I accomplished this by fishing out as many cornels of corn as possible (after everything had simmered/boiled together for thirty minutes)  and then put the rest of the soup into the blender. In the end the soup was thick, healthy (with no cream) and full of corn texture! My husband had an extra extra helping so it gets four forks from both of us!

Loved this recipe! I also used less water (only 2 cups) and added one cup Chicken broth, which was great! I didn't have thyme sprigs so I used about 1-ish tsp of dried thyme. I also just used black pepper because I had it and I like it better than white. To cut the calories I added 11/2 cups half&half and then 11/2 cups whole milk. I also added a little extra cayenne. So yummy!

With modifications, I would give this four forks! I made the following variations: 1) Used fingerling potatoes 2) Reduced water to about 6 cups 3) Used four ears of corn 4) Added a chopped leek when sauteeing the carrot/onion/thyme 5) Used only 1 1/2 c of half and half and no heavy cream at all 6) Used an immersion blender to puree the whole mixture 8) Reserved a cup or so of raw corn and roasted it in the oven with olive oil and cayenne pepper, then stirred it back in at the end. We also crumbled bacon on top when finished...it was fantastic!!!!!!!

I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut down on the water (2 cups only) and heavy cream (2 cups only and I used nonfat half and half). Had I not made the modifications I would have given this recipe 4 forks. The garnish also gives this recipe an extra bit of excitement.

I followed the recipe, with the exception of adding 6 pieces of bacon, (cooking the onions and carrots in 1Tbsp of the bacon fat) and black pepper instead of white. It turned out great. The corn is pretty crisp still, which makes for good texture. Will definitely make again

Everyone loved it. Only made a few changes: Used 3 cups water, 1 cup chicken broth (cause I had it on hand), 1 cup heavy cream (to reduce the calories) and 2 cups whole milk. Hand blended about 1 cup of the soup and after it cooked down it was a great creamy consistency. The garnish of green onions and fine chopped cilantro was just what it needed to liven it up a bit. Definitely used black pepper instead of white for this classic chowder. Will make it again and more of it to see how well it freezes.

I loved this recipe. It's worth the hour plus it takes to make it, but I would recommend doubling the recipe and so that you have some for winter. I used less water and half the cream, added more potato and corn. I omitted the cayenne pepper and instead substituted pumpkin pie spice, which I cooked with the onions and carrots. I used black pepper, instead of white, as I like the look and flavor. At the end to thicken it up I hit it with a hand blender so that it was still chunky, but not yet pureed. It came out pretty thick to the point where I think I could have kept more of the original water in it.

I loved this, especially because it uses up the corn cobs and "milk" as well, which I hate to waste. I substituted whole milk for about 3/4 of the cream, and it was delicious.

Delicious! I modified the recipe though. Cut the water in half, and used half and half instead of cream, and cut that by a third. Also added a chopped celery rib and 3 cloves of garlic to onions and carrot. Used black pepper instead of white. doubled cayenne and added a teaspoon of paprika. Also boiled gently for almost an hour as opposed to a half an hour to get the consistency I wanted. Finished off with some grated nutmeg (~1/8 teaspoon?)Would've given it a 4 forks, but I think without the modifications, it would've been pedestrian.

The flavor of the soup is delicious but I found the broth too soupy. I added corn starch until it was the consistency I wanted. I also added another 1/8 of cayenne.

The veggie part of this recipe is great, but there was way too much broth. Definitely reduce the cream and water. I would probably used 1.5-2 c cream and about half the water next time.

The soup is delicious. I didn't want to use all the cream, so I only used one cup. Next time, I will reduce the water by about 2 cups so that the soup will be a little less brothy. I used smoked paprika instead of cayenne.
