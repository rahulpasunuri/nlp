This was absolutely delicious! However, I cooked at 350 degrees and not at 425 degrees as the recipe stated. It was a 2.08lb roast and was medium rare at 45 mins. Melted in our mouths and had beautiful flavour. It was very easy and I served with wild rice, green bean casserole and a flavourful gravy!

This is an excellent way to roast a big hunk of sirloin, but I'm not convinced the grey sea salt made much of a difference. I reckon the quality of the beef is the most important thing; I paid a fortune (but much less than a single meal at Fergus Henderson's restaurant would have set me back) and it was worth it - the steak was meltingly tender and moist, helped no doubt by its thick layer of fat. I suggest stabbing it with a meat thermometer at 30 mins, by which time mine was ready to come out of the oven to rest.
