Cooked the quinoa with the mushrooms and onions in a chicken broth. It's an OK recipe for an weeknight and much less heavy than a risotto. Used a hint of butter at the end which I feel made a difference. Good salty reggiano parmesan topped it off. I was not sure I wanted to try the recipe after reeding the reviews, but reviews around the table were unanimous ;-)

Not so hot folks but then, how good can quinoa actually get? I followed others' advice and used stock, not water, amped up garlic and thyme. Cooked quinoa with the veg/stock. Added parm and butter at the end. And still an ok result. Too much work for the average pay off. Adding a ton of parmesan at the end will help but at this point I figure you might as well make a regular risotto with all these lovely ingredients so you can really appreciate them!

Super hearty side dish. I followed some suggestions and cooked all the vegetables first, and then added the broth and quinoa to the same pot. The quinoa turned out very flavorful and surprisingly creamy. I also didn't have any open bottles of white wine on hand, so I just used a dry red and it was fine. Definitely a crowd pleaser.

CAVEAT - some improv. Following reviews, we cooked vegtables first, used sherry, then added broth, brought to boil and added quinoa, cooked as directed. probably did good things for flavor which was good(though add salt if you are not going to use cheese).

Pretty good, but I found I needed to add more liquid. Chicken stock would have worked well, but I admit to adding cream, which upped the yum-factor, certainly. It's a nice, quick weeknight dish.

I hated to give it even one fork - this was terrible! Very, very bland. Just no flavor whatsoever. Such a fail that even I agreed to go out to dinner instead of eat it!

very bland. just tasted like quinoa and mushrooms. the wine didn't really add any flavor and definitely did not taste like risotto

I made this the other night for dinner for a vegan friend. I used vegetable stock instead of both the water (to cook the quinoa) and the wine (my guest also abstains from alcohol). I recommend using stock to cook the quinoa because it gives it that much more flavor! In fact, I NEVER make quinoa with water. I omitted the cheese altogether and didn't miss it one bit. My friend was thrilled with the dish and even took the recipe home with her that night! Too bad for me my husband doesn't like quinoa but this is one I will make again and again for myself.

This dish was reasonably tasty, but nothing to write home about. I agree that it is not really a risotto as it is not creamy unless you add heaping spoonfuls of Parmesan cheese. Speaking of which, loading up on Parmesan was the saving grace of this dish, which pretty much negates any healthfulness in the low cal, nutrient-rich quinoa/mushroom mixture.

Loved it! I didn't get the syrupy consistency,but it work well as a main course. I am always looking for new ways to prepare quinoa. I bought farm fresh morel mushrooms and then found this recipe.

Very good, and easy to make. I made it twice, once using only baby bella mushrooms and once using oyster mushrooms, both times it came out well. Highly recommended!

This was fairly easy to make though none of the times were really long enough to accomplish what the recipe indicated. For example, it took quite a bit longer than 2 minutes to reach a "syrupy" consistency when reducing the wine. I would make it again, but I might change things up a bit and try cooking the quinoa like you would risotto instead of separately as is indicated here just to see what happens. I think I will add another veg like peas or carrots if eating as a main dish.

i did not like the flavor of this recipe. and i also thought it was a bit bland. i added a lot of salt, pepper, and cheese to it and i still did not like it.

Really good and tasty, quick weeknight dinner. Used fresh mushrooms, crimini and portobello caps diced small. Did substitute dry sherry for the white wine as suggested by one reviewer and the taste was fabulous. I suspect the wine would have been equally as good. Doubled all ingredients (with the exception of the sherry) so we'd have leftovers. Next time, a splash of worcestershire with the mushrooms while cooking would be a nice addition. Basically, this recipe is easily adaptable to a number of variations - a real plus in this household.

This is so good! I agree that is isn't really a risotto, but it now one of my favorites. My husband tossed in some ham that we had left over from Christmas dinner and some Italian parsley and it was a hit. Will be making this one again and again.

If you have ever gone to the market hungry, you'll likely end up with Quinoa in your pantry and not know what to do with it. TRY THIS RECIPE! Even the kids loved it. I served this as the main on our meatless monday, substituting cooking sherry for the white wine, and a garlic ginger paste for the cloves of garlic. Both worked fine. I will add more mushrooms next time I make this.

Made this dish with fresh button mushrooms and dried oyster mushrooms and used the water from reconstruction to cook quinoa in. Instead of white wine I used medium dry sherry, and instead thyme I added dried herbs de Provence. It was very tasty, and will definitely make it again and maybe add some other vegetables as well.

Great hearty vegetarian dish. I didn't have onions so I used shallots. Also increased the garlic to 2 cloves and used dry vermouth instead of wine. At the very end I added a half tablespoon of butter. Yum!

Made a few changes to this and it came out tasty (but not necessarily "risotto" like). I used dried wild mushrooms which I soaked in hot water first, of course. Used that water to cook the quinoa (along with more plain water to make 2 cups) and it came out very tasty. Added 1 T butter at the end to round out the flavors and give some depth to the dish. Next time I will add asaparagus. Everyone loved it, even my two toddlers!

I understand the point of using quinoa rather than a pasta, but this was really bad. My family wouldn't eat it. It was very grainy, it did not come out smooth or creamy as I would expect of a risotto. This dish is good if you know what you're getting, but it shouldn't be called a risotto. (I think this would be much better is the quinoa was replaced with arborio rice!)

So good. I used shallots instead of onion and I added spinach like someone suggested and it was amazing. I can't wait to eat my leftovers!

This isn't really a risotto, but it's delicious. A great vegetarian main course with a salad.

I halved the wine, used chicken broth and prepared just like I would risotta: that is, I sauteed vegggies, added quinoa and cooked for a minute, added the wine and cooked until evaporated, added the broth and cooked til absorbed, removed from heat and stirred in about 1/4 cup of parm. Served sprinkled with a bit more parm. I enjoyed this as much as I do with rice and sounds like it would be a healthier dish with the quinoa so pretty pleased.

I made this one and really enjoyed it. I would say you could use a little less wine. I noticed that I could have just used chicken broth instead as the wine taste was pretty strong. That's just me. Try it as they said and you might really love the recipe as is but if you agree about the taste, sub chichen broth or stock. Blessings

This was delicious and nutritious (with a few modifications)! Instead of cooking the quinoa separately, I first sautéed all veggies together and then added it raw to the veggie mixture with a cup of veggie broth (instead of wine because I didnt have any&gasp!), covered pan and let it cook down for almost 10 mins. I also added the following during cooking: - pine nuts - fennel (chopped) - scallions (sliced) - about a tsp of white truffle oil - about a half cup of frozen spinach Enjoy!

SO I read the reviews and I thought to myself, "how is this recipe REALLY different from, let's asy, a barley risotto." So I changed up the preparation and I found that the flavor was really interesting. First, I sauteed the quinoa in the fat, with the garlic, onion and mushrooms. Oh, and BTW, use reconstituted dry mushrooms if possible as the flavor is particularly concentrated, AND you can use the liquid to develop the quinoa. I also added some dairy near the end as the quinoa was finishing, but before the parmesan as you would in preparation of an arborio bssed risotto. I ended up mixing a black and pearl quinoa, so the dish was also visually interesting. Would I make this recipe again? For sure. Hope you all enjoy quinoa as much as I did

I thought this recipe was great. But I did make some changes. To add a roundness of flavor, I cooked the quinoa in the partially sauteed mushroom/onion mixture. I just sauteed the onions until translucent, added mushrooms and a few minutes later added the quinoa and water. I also didn't have white wine on hand so I used red and it was delicious with the thyme and garlic.

I enjoyed it... my first time cooking quinoa also. I used chicken broth for the quinoa and I sauted the onion in olive oil and a TBSP of butter. I didn't have fresh thyme so I used dried and I used two cloves of garlic instead of one. I was concerned that it may be overly sweet with all the onion and the wine, so I halved the wine and added chicken broth as well as freshly ground salt and pepper. Next time I think I'd do the same, but also half the amount of onions. I tossed some fresh baby spinach in just before serving. I will do this again it makes a nice meatless dinner.

This was okay...first time cooking quinoa. I used chicken broth, but otherwise kept it the same. The texture was fine, but it really was quite bland and not "creamy" like risotto. We'll try it again, probably with many more add-ins.

Simple, tasty and with the addition of some frozen, chopped, drained spinach at the end it's nutritionally decent. I added some dill sprigs as I was serving with salmon and quinoa should always be cooked in stock.

This dish is easy, light and low cost but as other reviewers have pointed out below, it needs some additions and substitutions to make it stand out on your dinner table. I cooked the quinoa in vegetable broth instead of water. Like another reviewer I added spinach at the end. In the future I might skip the spinach and serve the quinoa mixture over a bed kale for a hearty meal. I sauteed the onion/mushroom mixture with Za'athar (hyssop, coriander, sesame seeds, and salt) seasoning for something more robust. Finally, I added toasted pine nuts at the end. In the future I might stuff this pilaf mixture into grilled portabello mushroom caps for a nice dinner party side dish or appetizer.

Ho hum. This is not a risotto, but as another reviewer wrote, more of just a grain side dish. The recipe needed depth so I used low-sodium chicken broth to cook the quinoa and added a couple of tablespoons of butter, which isn't much for six servings, and it helped. Also added about 5 cups of chopped baby spinach which boosted the nutrient & color factors.

This was a good mid-week recipe - healthy and easy! I also added spinach the end for a one dish dinner.

I've made this twice so far and the first time turned out better. It had a nice flavor the first time, however, it is a little bland for me the second time around. My grandparents loved it though. I think some red pepper flakes would give it some kick.

As far as quick/easy/healthy dishes go this recepie is a keeper for me. The two changes I made were to use chicken stock to cook the quinoa (rather than water) and to add chopped kale to the mushroom/wine mixture. A drizzle of olive oil over top each plate is a good addition to the grated parmigano. Lastly, this dish is also fairly inexpensive, espically when served as the main entree for my family.

I thought this was just OK, a little bland, needed more mushroom flavor. If I make it again I might try starting with mushroom stock instead of water. I agree it has nothing to do with risotto, other than being a grain based side dish.

I added spinach leaves at the end of the cooking time to make a nutrionally rounded one-dish meal.

This dish was good, simple and quick to make. It really has nothing to do with risotto in either texture or process, but it was tasty all the same. I used exotic mushrooms instead of criminis, red quinoa, and served it with roasted wintersquash. Yum!

This is a quick, easy recipe. I did not have dry white wine so I substituted in half a cup of red wine and half a cup vegetable broth. It turned out to be a great side dish for Xmas dinner.
