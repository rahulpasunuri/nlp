Reading the recipe now, I realize that I left out the olive oil and cumin, oops! With just the orange juice and chipotles (I used dried that I re-hydrated first in warm water, with seeds for some kick), this is delicious. Next time I'll add the cumin, but will probably to continue to leave out the oil to save on calories. This was a huge hit at my bbq!

I have made this recipe for years and everyone loves it; however, I have made some revision. I only use 1-2 chipotle peppers in the marinade. You need to taste it to make sure it's not too hot and doesn't overpower the veggies (as mentioned by 1 reviewer.) Also, I do not use the veggies listed (especially not the tomatoes which can fall apart.) I use colorful peppers--red, yellow, green bell peppers--onions, potatoes (cooked a little in advance so they aren't too hard), mushrooms (added at the end), and eggplant. I either roast the veggies in the oven and cook them on an outside grill. If you cook on a grill, you need to make sure to drain most of the marinade since the orange juice contains sugar and can burn quickly. Hope my suggestions will compel you to give this a try!

I am a professional Chef, I really enjoyed preparing this dish. I like it's smiplicity and bold flavor. It's really wonderful when paried with either Lemon-oregano grilled chicken breast or Citrus-Ancho Grilled pork chop. Wonderful summer dish.

I don't know, it just didn't taste too wonderful to me. And I like chipotle. However, I think it may be too overpowering for roasted veggies. There are other ways to roast veggies that taste better (and are simpler to prepare).

The tomatoes were excellent but the other veggies were just so-so

Very easy to make and very yummy. I made it for a 4th of July party and made it well in advance. The veggies held up fine and were quite good a room temperature. The amount chipotle adds a nice smokiness without too much kick if your guests are a little "heat shy".

This was an easy but new twist on grilled vegetables and the chipotle gave it a nice kick. We'll add slightly more chipotle/adobo next time, as it could have used a little more heat. I just tossed the veggies in the dressing and put them on a grill rack that goes over the grill, rather than brushing it on. Added an ear of corn also, and next time we get fresh corn, this is how I'll fix it-gave the corn a great flavor.
