I cubed the lamb instead of pounding it. Worked just as well and came out delicious.

I've made this dish twice now and everyone LOVED it (even picky eaters). Served Spinach and goat cheese Brushetta as an appetizer and a couscous and lentil salad (I believe the recipe is also from Epicurious.com)with the lamb. Dessert...Baklava! :) This is one of my husband's favorites.
