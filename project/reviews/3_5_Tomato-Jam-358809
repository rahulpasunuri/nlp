I used this recipe to go with the Rosemary Cookies with Tomato Jam. It was good at first but the more I ate it, the weirder it tasted. Plus, it came out super thick and nearly impossible to spread. And once they were sitting in the cookies for a while, it became so sticky I was afraid it would pull out someone's filling!

I made the rosemary cookies w/tomato jam for a cookie swap last year and they were the hit of the night. I will say that when making this jam, if you choose to double or triple the recipe, be prepared to let the tomatoes cook for a LONG time.

I used the suggested minus 1/2 cup sugar and instead of adding chili peppers, I used pinches of cayenne pepper. I halved the recipe to produce 1 cup and added 3 pinches of cayenne pepper. It makes it a real sweet and spicy jam. Not sure if 6 pinches will translate to the full 2 cup recipe but give it a go!

Forgot to add-I didn't bother squeezing the pips and flesh out. It looks a little more rustic; and takes a little longer to cook down but still works perfectly.

This jam is fantastic. Super simple recipe and actually turns into jam as opposed to a salsa-type sauce like several other recipes I've tried. I threw in 4 hot hot dried chillis for a bit of zing. I'll be gifting this jam this year!

October 2010 Tried this recipe with the Rosemary cookies. This was outstanding. My guest could not believe that is was Tomato jam. I normally don't give 4 forks, but this recipe deserved it.

This is fantastic, although I don't know if the average person would EVER guess it is tomatoes - would probably guess strawberry or other berry! Amazing on the cookies, but also fantastic on brie and crackers, or on a turkey and brie wrap! I did cut down on the sugar by about 1/2 cup, and still found that it came together and gelled nicely!
