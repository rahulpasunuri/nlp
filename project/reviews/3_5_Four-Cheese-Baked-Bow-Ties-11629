We love this dish! I usually market-basket what ever four cheeses I happen to have on hand. This always turns out good no matter what cheeses I use! I use arrowroot as the thickner if I intend to freeze this, and it does freeze well! I just that, bake covered with foil for about 40 min, uncover and bake til brown and bubbly. Great dish and I will make often!

It's a favorite at our house. Simple to make. I love the bite of the gorganzola against the other cheeses in the recipe.

This is the perfect recipe for entertaining teens. my daughter entertains the swim team all the time, and they dont want fast food! i can prepare it in advance (its easy to double also) and bake it just before serving. tonight its with a nice caesar salad and a dessert of glittering lemon sandwich cookies - which were originally featured as a christmas cookie, but i make them year-round!

This is excellent with steak or beef dishes. It is extremely flavorful and very popular with the whole family. I have made it countless times over the past few years and it will be one to pass down to my children.

I don't know how others thought this was bland. It turned out to be a very flavorful dish, and my boyfriend (who is a very picky eater) also thought it was great! I would definitely make it again, and it's also great as leftovers.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and found it to be pretty bland. The tomatoes take away from the delicate flavor of the cheeses and when you're spending that much money on cheese, I think they'd do better to stand alone. I found a recipe for quattro fromage on-line and used the remaining cheeses with whole wheat ziti and it was very, very good. This was like fancy Ravioli.

It was really yummy, and both adults and children liked it.

Absolutely divine! This dish always receives rave reviews from family and friends. The use of the four cheeses lends a complex flavor and the tomato adds a lovely counterpoint. It develops a lush crust on top. I've had guests fight over any scraps left in the baking dish. This dish works well for everyday dinner as well as parties. Any leftovers (there usually aren't any) are equally as delicious. It is imperative that you use the cheeses called for in the recipe, otherwise you've missed the boat on why this is such a great meal!

This recipie was very good and easy to follow. Chesses were a little to expensive for this dish. Used left overs as hor dourves. I also added , hamburger meet and garlic.

I didn't care for the gorgonzola cheeze. The flavor was too strong

I love the cheeses in this recipe, and have experimented with different blues (gorgonzola, SAGA Blue, etc...) Delicious pasta, and great leftovers!!!

I thought this recipe was so good. I love pasta, and I would definitely make this again. It was a hit with my family too.

I do a lot of pastas for my clients, and the best results I get when baking dishes with a more delicate pasta is to make the sauce in advance, (holding warm) then incorporating and make sure you reduce the cooking time. This should work out so you don't have soggy, overcooked pasta.

Tastey recipe. Went to Trader Joe's as the cheese they sell is inexpensive- flavour is not compromised. Used blue cheese instead of goganzola and French fontina. Did not use as much tomatoe sauce and used a few crushed tomatoes. Did not add more milk to compensate less tomatoe juice. very yummy

I love this pasta. Rich, flavorful & delicious.

The dish should probably be called Baked Bow Ties with Tomatoes and Four Cheeses. While I liked the tomatoes, it's not your traditional "four cheese" pasta. That being said, it was ok but not great, and I personally would probably not serve it to guests unless I were making it for a big crowd. If I did make it again, I would do so with some modifications: 1) will use a firmer and more textured pasta than bowties. 2) rather than just al dente, I will slightly undercook the pasta before baking it. 3) I will use the largest shallowest dish I can find because the best part is the browned top and the slightly burnt edges where the pasta touched the dish while baking.

A creamy, delicious rendition of my favourite comfort food

A Sensational Dish. Followed recipe exactly except that the bow ties came in a 12oz. box and that's all I had. Think it would have been just as good with sufficient sauce for a full lb. Tremendous cheesy flavor as you would expect. Could easily serve 6 to 8 with just the 12 oz of pasta. Nice company dish.

Some of the remarks commented on the sauce being too dry. So I added another can of crushed tomatoes. Instead of bowties, I used a pound of cavatelli, which gave a nice consistancy to the sauce, making it almost cheesier. As with most pasta dishes, the leftovers are much better. I agree in using a little less parsley. I also found that the more times I make the dish, the easier and quicker it gets. Great recipe. Definitely a favourite.

There is not enough sauce for this pasta. It is very dry. I would cut the pasta amount down to half. The sauce is not bad, though. I think it may be better left over. I used two pints of my own home-canned tomatoes because that's all I had. There is definitely enough here for a crowd, though.

If you are looking for a filling main dish, this is it. Very tasty! Incidentally, I used rotini, which gave it a great texture. The next time I might cut down on the parsley, though.

My husband is a very picky eater. I don't usually show him what I put in any dish I'm making because he would automatically say he didn't like it. He raves about this dish!!!

Despite some of the earlier reviews of this dish, I did not find this dish bland or too rich at all. Yes, some of the ingredients (the cheeses) are not inexpensive, however, if the dish were created with inexpensive processed cheeses, you might as well buy the whole package in a tall thin box. Good cheese is worth the price! This is an excellent main course. It is often the center-piece of our dinner parties and is requested by our regular guests. Re-heats well and makes great left-overs.

Although this dish as pretty good, I have not made it again--too rich.

This excited the palatte. If you are in the mood for some cheesy goodness, made the italian way, this is the way to go. It does cost a lot to aquire all of the ingredients though...

The cheeses make this dish expensive. It is easy to make and the sauce looks great, but the dish is not loaded with flavor. I might make it again to use up some of the Gorgonzola and the rest of the Romano cheese.
