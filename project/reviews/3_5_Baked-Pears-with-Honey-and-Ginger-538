Cut the sugar and butter dramatically!!! This flavorful recipe does not need either. Use fresh ginger generously. I got rave reviews and requests for my version of this recipe. I very lightly sprinkled about 1 T brown sugar (in total) on the pears and used only 1T butter divided among the pears.

Great flavors. A great finish with a scoop or frozen yogurt or vanilla ice cream. I also like this with a dollop of softened cream cheese as a side dish for a brunch buffet.

Super. Easy and very tasty--a great base for a "healthy" ice cream sundae and a quick and nice-looking ending to a meal.
