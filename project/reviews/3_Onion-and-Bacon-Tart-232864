Love it...it is my go to easy recipe. I whip it up in a flash...using whatever base I have on hand. Frozen pie crusts, pizza dough, puff pastry, top it with a crusty bread. Easy---sometimes I toss in a little balsamic vinegar to the onion or rosemary or try cranberries. Delicious.

This recipe is fantastic just as it is...though I did make some additions that I think make it even better. I carmelized the onions by adding 1tbsp brown sugar and 1 tsp vinegar. I thought it was too runny so I halved the sour cream egg. then I added crumbled goat cheese the last 8 minutes of baking, and just berfore serving I sprinkled minced chives/scallions. I've made it as a large tart but it also words as individual tarts using 2.5" biscuit cutter. People always ask for the recipe!

I thought this dish was so-so. I found it to be a bit too sweet from the onions and I was barely able to finish the square I was eating. I also thought there are too many onions. This dish is based on the Alsatian "tarte flambée", which also adds cheese. Next time, I would reduce the onions and add cheese.

I loved this!!! These were my changes after the 1st time: I carmelize the onions in butter/bacon grease. Pizza dough is hard to work with so I now use cresent roll dough and bake it at a lower temp for longer. Add more crispy bacon and definately keep the caraway seeds!!!

This recipe was simple and fantastic. I omitted the caraway seeds, as a personal preference. And I agree with the reviewer who suggested that some thyme or mustard would be a nice addition. However, even the recipe as it appears here is simple and fantastic, and would make a very impressive luncheon served with a green salad.

This was wonderful and easy! I used light sour cream and after assembled I added a small amount of mixed italian white cheeses. Delicious! The only thing that didn't really work for me were the caraway seeds. Next time I would omit them.

Delicious! I used a packaged pizza dough for convenience.

I made this for a Fall wine party and thought it was delicious! I added a little more bacon. Make sure to bake it until its really crispy. Great as written!

First of all, this recipe is not a tart, it is a pizza. A tart uses pastry crust, not bread/pizza dough. Second, it didn't taste all that great. I suspect the tube pizza dough, and bland method of cooking the onions played a part in this less-than-stellar recipe. Even my kids, who will eat anything I put on their plate, refused to take a second slice. Some of the suggestions in the other reviews may make this recipe a keeper, but as written, I'd say pass.

What the heck is a "tube" of refrigerated pizza? Is that like a canned biscuit thing? If so, perhaps that would have been a bit more delicate that the frozen Italian dough I used. In any case, this is good but it needs a kick. I'm thinking some thyme and a touch of grain mustard - maybe even some mushrooms. **Be sure to deglaze the bacon/onion pan with a little riesling or sherry and put all that flavor into the custard. And let the onions get nice and carmelized (I don't know why recipe says not to let them brown - thjen it would have been REALLY bland. Germans.)

I made this for an appetizer. It turned out very nice. I did make my own dough for the crust. I added 1T of sugar to the onions and 1 T vegetable oil to get them going. I garnished it with crumbled Montrachet. I would make this again. Next time I would consider making a buttermilk dressing for drizzle or a dip on the side! Enjoy!
