Made this twice. First time per recipe. Delicious outcome. Second time, using four lamb foreshanks (total weight @ 4lb). Also delicious and used the following modifications: No lamb bones in the mix. Used 1/2c pomegranate molasses (syrup) plus 1/2 c water in place of the pom juice. Also after defatting sauce I did not strain it, but removed the shanks and used a stick blender to lightly puree the onions in the sauce. Served the chunky sauce along with shanks and Persian rice. Since the braise is even better a day after making, a great do ahead dish.

This recipe is unbelievable!! I didn't use the bones or shoulder as I only had 2 shanks. I also cut the recipe in half. You can find the pomegranate juice at Whole Foods. It's called Just Pomegranate. I didn't leave it overnight since I didnt have time but I did refrigerate for about 4 hours. It was sensational!!! My boyfriend said it tasted like the holidays. The cinnamon and allspice really pop. I literally snuck back twice to the dutch oven to steal scrapings of the sauce. This is one of the tastiest recipes I've ever made and cannot wait an appropriate amount of time to make it again. Yum-O!

Very flavourful! I had to alter the recipe a bit given I only had a boneless leg of lamb that had been cut into large chunks (2 ") and no lamb bones. I floured and browned the meat and then added the next 10 ingredients. Simmered for the alotted time. The lamb was so tender and the sauce was bursting with layers of flavour. Served it over Cous Cous made with preserved lemon, toasted almonds and fresh mint. Yum.

Fantastic. This was a huge hit on Christmas Eve.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner, and it was a HUGE hit, even with my Greek friend who grew up eating lamb! And it smells great while cooking.

I made this recipe with lamb shanks and omitted the neck bones. I used a dry Zinfandel and pomegranate concentrate. The lamb turned out melt in your mouth soft and bursting with flavor. I did add some more pomegranate concentrate as I was roasting it. This is a super Rosh Hashana recipe.

I have used this recipe numerous times & it is always a favorite. Leftovers make great sandwiches

This was just so-so and I followed the recipe exactly. The pomegranate juice added a tanginess that I did not like with the lamb. My husband enjoyed it much more than I did so I guess it is just a matter of taste.

We liked this dish, but have enjoyed other lamb dishes much more than this one, so we probably won't make this again.

Holy guacamole this was good. Made it for Easter this year and, despite a small fire in my oven caused by sauce overflow (need a bigger Dutch Oven, and what's a family get together without a little drama?), this dish was simple to make and absolutely delicious. I used real butter instead of margarine (margarine isn't allowed near my house unless carried by lactose-intolerant friends...pack it in, pack it out) and my butcher didn't have any bone-in shoulder roasts or neck bones (I got boneless shoulder roasts and femur bones) and it didn't suffer at all. The sauce is really gosh-wow good and there's plenty of it to go around. Good stuff.

I used a beef roast instead of lamb and it came out fabulous. It tasted very much like sauerbrauten.

I made this for a progressive dinner party where we were having cocktails at another home and then travelling back to our house with eight guests for dinner, so needed an elegant dish that could be made ahead. This worked perfectly and it was a hit with everyone! I also used pomegranate molasses which was very flavorful. I paired it with spinach with pine nuts and raisins...another great recipe that can be made ahead!

This was *amazing*. I used a boneless lamb roast that came untied when I snipped the package open. No bother, I just browned the sucker and bunged it in the oven while I was out. I shredded the meat with a fork and added it to the reduced finished sauce. The pomegranate adds a tangy, elusive flavor.

This dish is amazing. I made it with a leg of spring lamb, and had the butcher select as lean a leg as possible and butterfly it. I then manually trimmed off as much fat from the inside as possible before i tied it up with string. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, substituting the leg bone bits for the shoulder bones. The flavour is amazing - quite rich but not overpowering - and the lamb comes out very tender. I'm not a fan of lamb - indeed, this is the first time I have cooked it myself, but this recipe defies all my previous experiences with lamb. It even wasn't as fatty as I had expected. As I dislike rare meats in general, I cooked my 2kg leg (weighed after the bone came out)for 2.5 hours - just right. (For anyone struggling with metric - 0.454kg = 1 pound). Would definitely recommend this recipe - you have to try this dish. It's quite time consuming, but well worth it for a special occasion.

We threw it all in a crockpot and let it go for a few hours - the result is awesome over basmati rice or the brown rice medley from our favorite market (long grain brown rice with black barley and daikon radish seeds)!

Tender, succulent, tasty! We added more pomegranate juice before reducing the pan drippings to give the sauce more fruity flavor.

I have not made this, as I haven't had the opportunity to feed a large crowd recently. I marinate lamb chops in pomegranate juice before grilling and have wonderful results. I will try marinating in a combination of pomegranate and tomato paste to see if I like the flavor combination.

I'd bought lamb necks (for AUD 50c!!) without any idea what to do with them. This is a great recipe - with some moderation, as my husband doesn't like garlic & I had no pomegranates. However, even without these it was very successful & I'll certainly make it again. Maybe next time with all the ingredients!

This recipe was very delicious. A little time consuming but not too difficult to follow. I left out the lamb neck bones, and added in some mushrooms. I also only used 2 lbs of Lamb Shank, as the 7 lbs of meat the recipe calls for was entirely too much for myself and my boyfriend to consume.

This is an absolutly great recipe. I wasn't sure on the pomegranite juice, i have pomegranite molassas, but the label indicates it is concentrated juice, so I used half as much as called for. The next day, checking for seasoning, I added the rest to brighten up the flavors. We are doing this again in 2 weeks for company, hope it turns out as well as last night. Fab leftovers too!

This is the makings of a great classic for a lamb dish that is both full of flavor yet sublime. However the 4 times I have made it I followed a different path of cooking. I used at different times whole lamb necks, shoulder and shanks. Any of these or combination works. Have the pieces of meat, brown as directed in olive oil. Follow recommendation to then salt and pepper and drench with flour. In same pot that lamb was browned add onions and garlic. I like to combine 5 chopped garlic cloves and 5 that remain in their skin. Fry for the 4 or 5 minutes till just starting to get yellow. Add meat back in pot, add next 7 ingredients and cook over slow fire for 2 or 3 hours depending on size of meat pieces and ensuring the meat becomes fork tender. Let stew cool for at least 1/2 hour. Remove fat from top, and place meat and bones into a covered pan. Continue by boiling down sauce over medium to high heat, pressing vegetables for about 15 minutes. Then pass through a seive, return to pot, cook sauce till velvety consistency. Put meat back but do not continue to boil. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. It's very good then on th couscous as recommended, rice or even mashed potatoes. Very east meets west dish.

This was an amazing meal I've made several times now for holiday feasts with friends. While it's quite labor intensive the day before the big event, it's relative simple to complete and serve to guests. I highly recommend this recipe for any special occasion.
