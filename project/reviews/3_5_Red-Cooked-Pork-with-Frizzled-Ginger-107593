We eat Chinese Food in San Francisco and this recipe tastes authentic. I didn't change anything and used the sherry. Let it cool, then put it in the frigg over night cooked it 15 minutes longer and it came out fabulous. I especially loved the Star Anise, it complemented the pork, but didn't over power it. I was surprised that I liked the orange zest as much as I did, I usually don't, and I thought it was too much. The Dish would probably not have turned out as well without it. We used the leftover sauce as a gravy on brown rice.

Wow -- this is a delicious dinner. Yes it takes a long time and requires a lot of prep, but it is so worth it. The broth is really flavorful and the pork was so tender. Guests really enjoyed this meal. Served it with Mushroom Ginger Consomme and Asian Spinach with Orange and Avocado - both from epicurious. I highly recommend this dish!!

I used my own master sauce from the freezer and wanted to add a couple tips - when you reuse it, toss in any of the seasonings on the list (whatever you have handy) and add a couple tablespoons of soy sauce. Otherwise we find the sauce gets too meaty over time. We loved the frizzled ginger and will be doing that again.

This was really great, and would be great for a casual get-together due to the do-ahead nature. Quite simple, although the time-frame listed does not make you think so.

This is one of the tastiest dish I have ever made! The star anise and orange rind make it so spectacular!!! It got a really satisfying delicious aftertaste that lingers in your mouth. I am doing a 4 lb pork roast (now going through the chilling process in the fridge) but dropped some more boneless pork short rib so I can taste the sauce sooner ;) The short ribs tasted so yummy even though they haven't gone through the whole process (chilling for 8 hrs and baking) so I guess the pork roast must be even be more tasty. Can't wait! :)

I have been making this recipe since it first came out. It is easy to prepare and I think the frizzled ginger, though could be skipped, completes the dish. This recipe is one of my "go to" when I am busy but want something good to eat. I serve it with steamed jasmine rice.

This received mixed reviews. My husband liked the pork and sauce. I didn't like the texture of pork (used butt) but like the sauce--will try with chicken. Both children (adult) said they would not make it.

Red cooked pork is one of the dishes I crave during cooler months and this is, hands down my favorite recipe for it. The flavors are perfectly balanced, it makes great leftovers and couldn't be easier to prepare. I love the recipe as is, but I've changed it a bit. I add a handful of dried shitakes, replace regular soy with mushroom soy and cook it in a crock pot. Do save the sauce. I cook all kinds of meat in it and it just gets richer and richer. The frizzled ginger isn't absolutely neccesary, but my husband definitely misses it when I'm to lazy to make it.

I made this dish for a Chinese New Year party and it was a hit! I used a low sodium soy sauce and found the sauce to be wonderful and not too salty at all. I made it exactly as the recipe states and served it with several other chinese dishes: A veggie stir-fry, curry prawns and sesame beef. It was really a lovely presentation with the cilantro and frizzled ginger too.

Loved this the first time I made it -- we love anything Chinese -- I forgot that I froze the leftovers until I came across it in the hidden recesses of my freezer --wow, was it even better the second time around. Next time I make twice as much and freeze.

Loved it! I cooked late into the eveniong then chilled overnight - couln't help tasting evey time I went to kitchen to check/turn. Slow cooking makes a cheap cut of pork wonderfully tender. I find great variation in the saltiness of soy sauce, so be careful with it and add to taste.

Especially enjoyed the taste that the anise, and orange peel imparted. Yes, broth was salty but it is meant to be more of a dipping sauce rather then a broth to be eaten. Was glad to put to use a bottle of Shaoshing rice wine that has been aging in my pantry. Being from Hawaii I always use Aloha brand shoyu and I find that it is much less salty then say Kikkoman. Would like to use a whole chicken next time. Didn't make the frizzled ginger but instead just served with pickled ginger. Prepared a simple stir-fry of cabbage, broccoli, carrots, and celery accompanied with steamed jasmine rice. Very authentic Chinese flavor.

I got up at 6 a.m. to get this started. I should have stayed in bed. It isn't bad, it just isn't particularly good and is far too much work for mediocre results.

I'm not a pork fan, but I wanted to cook something oriental for a Chinese friend. She loved it and I liked it very much. Very tasty. I used the shoulder cut and served it with steamed spinach w/ a sesame oil and rice wine vinegar dressing. It compensated the saltiness of the meat. Drank an Austrian Schilcher (a pink, dry and kind-of-sour wine) that was quite OK with it. Tonight I'm having the leftovers with jasmin rice.

Delicious, very easy to make and very economical. I used the shoulder cut. I found my guests wanted a little more broth with the servings, so suggest add a little more to the slices, or keep some simmering. Served with garlic/ginger stir-fried broccoli. Leftover pork and broth are excellent with some thin udon or egg noodles.

This is amazing! On the recommendation of a friend, I used this for a very cheap cut of pork roast(only paid $4.00). It was incredible! I would even serve it to company.

The pork came out very salty. I followed all directions exactly except I couldn't find star anise; I used 2 tsps. of anise seeds instead. Maybe that's why. I would use half of the amount of soy sauce or less if I ever make this again.

This is an excellent slow-cook weekend meal. Serve with rice and a side of Chinese Broccoli and you are set! Its very, very important to tie the meat as it tends to fall apart as you cook and turn. It takes a long time, but its worth it and it makes the house smell oh so fragrant!

I have red-cooked pork, chicken, ham, beef and daikon radish with equally great results. The orange zest is a new one on me, tried it=loved it ! Play around with the quantity of soy sauce, sometime you may need more or less. 6-to-1 is a little too salty for MY taste, I have to watch my sodium intake, though. Ruth : Leave us ! Andy

Fabulous, low-fat comfort food. A definite keeper. I'd never even heard of a blade roast but my excellent butcher came up with the goods. I removed the skin & fat, however, & retied it (important, as it turns out). In lieu of stove-top cooking, I baked it in a low (140*C) oven for about 6 hours, so it came out lovely and stringy. Would make excellent pork sandwiches, though it's a lot of trouble to go through for lunch.

Wonderful--a light but comforting dinner--perfect for winter. I wouldn't make it if I didn't have the fresh cilantro, scallions, and orange zest--really made the meal. Served with brown rice but next time I'll use vermicelli noodles.

Yummy. The previous reviewer is right on the money. Why not say thank you for this free site, instead of complaining?

It was fantastic. I originally was looking for the Finnian Haddie also but when this recipe came up I thought "What the heck?" All I can say is geez Ruth get a grip. Search for the Finnian Haddie-I did-and found it!

As usual your site is all messed up. The picture on the page is for Finnan Haddie and the recipe that comes up is for the pork dish. I still cannot get a recipe into my recipe box. This is a terrible site. I never receive any answers to my request for help eithr. I am going to take this site off of my page.
