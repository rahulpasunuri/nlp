Yikes, I'd sure like to go back an hour in time and swirl the chocolate chips & nuts into the batter before baking. They just sit on top, not very integrated, making the "bar" portion dry and unremarkable. Regular chocolate chip cookies would have been a major improvement.

Not really sure how many forks I should give these because they are STILL not done yet! Thanks to pjskithcen... I should have followed the recipe as written. Put them in a glass pan at 300 (like Miss Person with all the degrees said I should) and they are taking FOREVER to cook! I might have to pitch them and start over. I should have trusted the Epicurious instructions. You can't believe verything you read in these reviews. Bummer.

This is my go-to recipe base for Blondies. The combinations are endless. Try swapping out the chocolate chips and pecans for a dried cherry/white chocolate/macadamia nut mix. Another good one is milk chocolate / pecan/toffee chips. They freeze well. Just wrap and freeze without cutting them, it helps to prevent them from drying out. I love this recipe and have used it dozens of times!

I just can't believe anybody puts these recipes in a 13*9.. to me, it's as thick as brittle. I started these in a 13*9 and got worried and tranfered them to an 8*8 but that was so much batter in a small pan that they're terribly gooey. I don't mind goo, but I hope they thicken up while they cool. I'm trying a different site next time. This was my first recipe from Epicurious and I'm not impressed.

I won't rate these because I made a few changes: cut sugar in half, didn't have any nuts and forgot the chocolate chips, and baked in a glass 9x9 at 300 for 30 min. Perhaps due to my changes, they turned out moist, but cakey, which was SO disappointing, as I was really craving something chewy. Still, they tasted great, and have a lot of potential. I might play around with it some more (or who knows, actually try it as written, ha!) As per my changes, 2/4.

After reading most of the reviews and then making these, I'm pretty sure I know what goes wrong for some people. Full disclosure- I have a BS and MS in Food and Nutrition so I may have knowledge that isn't known by everyone. Ok, so when you melt the butter, I usually take it off the heat when it is just over half melted and stir until the rest melts.It's important that the butter not be too hot when you add the sugar. If it is too hot the sugar changes causing the finished product to be "dry" or "hard". I mixed the nuts, chocolate chips as well as a 1/2 cup dried cranberries into the thick batter. I baked at 325 (metal pan-25 mins. I would use 300 with a glass pan. Too good!

I thought these were not good at all. The batter was cakey...not blondie like, which should be closer to a brownie. And sprinkling the chocolate and pecans on top meant that they didn't mix in with the batter.

I baked them in a 9x9 pan for 30 minutes, halved the sugar, and it was perfect for our taste.

When these work, they're great. I've made them about a dozen times over the last four years, and they turn out perfectly 3/4 of the time. I follow the recipe except I don't add nuts. Oddly, even though I do the same thing every time, it occasionally doesn't work and turns out overcooked or underdone. Underdone is easy enough to rectify - just test before taking it out of the oven - and when overcooked it makes a great ice cream sundae base.

Rating: 3
Concerned about overbaking b/c of some reviews, I reduced the oven temp to 325 and baked about 22 or 23 minutes, result was delicious but slightly underdone. I used dark brown sugar and baked it in a metal pan. Good recipe overall, great flavor.

Help! After sampling some blondies at a party which were chewy and delicious, I came home and found this recipe and made them this morning. Followed instructions, let them bake for 25 minutes and while flavor was good, they were hard as a rock...any suggestions for a chewy texture? Did I overcook at 25 mins?

A very good simple recipe! I usually enjoy cooking more gourmet recipes than this one, but these really did taste great.

Rating: 3
Very good. Very very easy to make. Before it went into the ove, I thought there would be too many chocolate chips, but in fact, it was the perfect amount. I might have done without the pecans. Nothing really exceptional - quite simple for a Bon Appetit recipe, but just a good tasting, hearty dessert.

Rating: 4
I was looking for something to satisfy my chocolate craving but wasn't too sweet. These are it! I have made them several times and they sometimes end up too sugary?? I was mixing them by hand and so I saw another recipe that used the electic mixer so I gave that a try. Seemed to work but I also think the temperature of the butter has something to do with it. As a professional chef I am never quite happy with a recipe unless I "tweak" it a bit so I use 1/2 dark brown sugar and 1/2 light brown sugar. I also use White Lily flour which doesn't have the gluten content of AP flour and I think this makes them more tender. I also add 3/4 cup of dried cherries at the end, before I add the dry ingredients.

Like most blondie recipes, these were super quick to make, but I still prefer the Nestle recipe from my childhood. This is very close to it, though!

Rating: 3
Easy to make and delicious, but WAY too sweet. I'll cut back the sugar by about 1/2 C. next time. Also, I used a 9x13 inch pan, but even using convection, I had to bake this about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. Nonetheless, these cookies are yummy.

Fabulous. And, at the risk of a complete cliche, this recipe is just like my mother used to make. The ultimate comfort-food dessert!

This is the ultimate blondie recipe. They have the perfect fudgy texture and rich butterscotch flavour that you come to expect in a blondie. I substituted almonds for the pecans the first time I made them and they turned out beautifully. The only problem was that my family and I could not stop eating them!

Very tasty and fluffy...a 13x9 pan seemed too big...I had to push the batter over to one half so it would be at least one inch thick. Delicious and easy to make.

These blondies are delicious. I have made them many times. The first time I made them as written with good results. But they are even better with more nuts (pecans and macadamia nuts work really well) and with chocolate Heath bar pieces. I also stir in half of the chocolate and nuts, then sprinkle the rest on top.

Rating: 4
These are fantastic. I shared the blondies with family and co-workers and everyone adored them. I followed the recipe to a t, but skipped the pecans. My only advice would be not to over-bake (underbaking might be better). Next time I make them, I'll be sure to experiment with dried fruit and other kinds of chocolate. A true keeper!

I love love love this recipe! My boyfriend told me these are the best thing I have ever baked (apparently it even topped the chocolate souffles I made earlier in the week). I also had a little trouble with the cooking time-- I dropped my oven to 325 and cooked the blondies longer, but the edges were still getting a little hard while the center wasn't ready. To help the blondies set up, I just refrigerated before getting them out of the pan and cutting. Sidenote, these come out of the pan beautifully, no sticking. So that was refreshing. Also, instead of putting the chips and nuts on top, I mixed them into the batter. This is a phenomenal recipe.

We liked this recipe, but we had a little trouble with the baking time; the edges were getting very dark while the center was still uncooked. I may not have spread the batter as evenly as I could have. Will definitely try again.

I was looking for something chocolate-free, so I used this basic recipe but left out the chocolate and pecans ... and instead added toffee bits. I've made these this way now about a dozen times, with high marks each time.

I read the other reviews and took the advice of using dark brown sugar as well as sprinkling some of the chips and pecans into the batter. I think this is very tasty. The brown sugar offers a more intense flavor, so I'm sure the light brown sugar would be equally as lovely, just less intense. I really enjoyed them! They are very moist and really have great flavor! This recipe is now my official "blondies" recipe that I will make over and over again.

My mom's blondies were, without a doubt, my favorite childhood indulgence. When I went looking for a comparable recipe earlier this week, I thought this fit the bill, but was almost disuaded by some of the ho-hum reviews on the site. I'm glad I persevered! This recipe was just the right amount of ooey-gooey chocolate and buttery cake-cookie. I think the trick is in the ingredients: good, locally-churned butter, high-end chocolate chips, and organic vanilla extract are definitely worth the expense!

EWWW. These were completely flavorless and boring. Do yourself a favor, if you truly like blondies do not make this recipe.

I made this recipe and while mine turned out more cakey than chewy they are wonderful. I did however make a few small changes. One I didn't have a full two cups of brown sugar so I added a little 100% pure maple syrup for some of the sugar. I also added some malted milk powder to it, as well as mixing in ½cup of Ghirardelli 60% cacao chocolate chips, sprinkling even more on top. I left out the nuts all together, we didn't have any in the house. The sweetness of the cookie plays quite well with the bittersweet chocolate of the chips. All in all it was a great recipe and I will make it again.

Very disappointed! These have NO flavor, will not makea again. Search continues for good blondie.

Very good. I melted the butter in the microwave in a Pyrex bowl, only until just melted (not translucent). It was easy to mix the rest of the ingredients right in that bowl. I skipped the nuts and doubled the chips, half in the batter, and half on top. Otherwise, followed it exactly. Delicious eaten after the fettucine with sausage and kale from this site, curled up by the fire on a cold Boston night!

If you want a chewier texture (vs. cakey), substitute dark brown sugar for light brown sugar. The higher molasses content will make for a chewier blondie (slightly darker color too). And DON'T overbake! Because I like a chewy texture, I prefer a metal pan to a glass pan - metal conducts heat better (they dry out more quickly in a glass pan). I made these with 1 1/4 cups choc chips mixed into the batter - no nuts - and then sprinkled another 1/4 cup of chips on top. Pan size was 13x9x2. A warm chunk of these and a cold glass of milk - YUM.

Don't be fooled by the simple (boring?) ingredients - these were surprisingly delicious! I followed the good advice of others and mixed in the nuts and chocolate chips (1 cup each). I wanted to take some to work, but my husband wouldn't part with any of them so we've been eating them for days. I especially appreciate not having to pull out my heavy KitchenAid mixer - the unusual (for me) method of adding brown sugar to melted butter is surely responsible for the addictive caramel flavor. Next time, I will definitely try using either dark brown sugar or the molasses sugar recommended by another reviewer.

Everybody loved this recipe. Use 1 cup each of pecan pieces and chocolate chips. I also used both chocolate and peanut butter chips instead of just chocolate chips.

These have been a great hit with the kids AND adults. I mix chocolate chips into the batter and then sprinkle chocolate/caramel chips on top. No nuts at our house! Only had one tsp of vanilla left today so I used that and added one tsp on almond extract - added a nice nutty flavor.

Classic blondie recipe that results in blondies I remember from years ago. Very chewy, very sweet caramel-type flavor; I used one cup of chocolate chips and mixed them in. I also used a glass dish and baked for a few minutes less than called for to get a very moist texture.

I made these for the kids I nanny and they loved them. I changed a couple things though, instead of pecans I used marshmallows. And instead of sprinkling the goodies on top I mixed them in with the recipe. The blondies turned out great, they were kind of like smore bars.

I love this recipe! The brownies taste so good and are addictive. I used macadamia nuts and white chocolate chips instead of pecans and chocolate chips and the results are amazing. Also, I baked the brownies about 5 to 10 mins longer because the center doesn't set in 25 mins.

Thought these were ok, but the texture wasn't great. Maybe I'll try what the Ann Arbor cook suggested with smaller pan, lower heat, longer baking. Put skor on top because of guests' nut allergies, but would make with pecans for my family.

I added peanut butter chips and chocolate chips. My family really enjoyed the recipe with this change.

I stumbled upon two things that will make this recipe incredible. 1) Substituted molasses sugar (a deep, dark brown) substituted for the light brown sugar. It adds richness and results in a dense, chewy texture. 2) I poured the batter into an 8x8" baking dish since I didn't have a larger one. Reduced the temperature 25 minutes into baking to 250 for about 20-30 minutes more. Toothpick check is necessary. This also adds to the chewy texture noted above.

Since one of my guests cannot eat chocolate (a fate worse than death, in my eyes), I made this recipe without the chocolate chips. I used the 13 x 9 pan, as the recipe suggested, and the result was delicious. At first, I had the pan at room temperature, then tasted the first one. Waaaaay too sweet, in my opinion, but the interior caramel-like substance had potential. I thought, "Why not put it in the fridge, so the caramel can harden?" I cut the bars, put them on a doily-covered plate and tossed them into the fridge until serving time. My guests, all ten of them, adored them, even the non-nut eater. They're chewy, rich and absolutely wonderful without chocolate. And I'm a choco-holic!

This is a decent recipe. The blondies look very pretty with the pecans on the top. The chocolate chips should probably be stirred in as well as layered on top. If you're looking for something easy and plain (but tasty) this is it.

We thought these were OK, but not worth baking again. Its so similar to chocolate chip cookie bars that I'd recommending making those instead (and add pecans) and you'd get a better bar.

Great blondie recipe! All the golden brown sugar gives them a caramel-like flavor that's really nice. And not too sweet (although very rich), which I like. I used walnuts instead of pecans and chopped up Vahlrona bittersweet chocolate because that's what I had and instead of leaving it on top, I stirred them in. They're also good the next day rewarmed in the microwave. I'll keep this recipe.

Very delicious and chewy blondie. Even after not spreading batter evenly into pan - didn't seem like a lot of batter. Turned out I had to bake 6 more minutes than called for because of that. Still turned out great. Next time I would make it in a 9 x 9 pan for thicker blondie. Love the recipe because you can use brown sugar that has hardened - just chop up in food processor before measuring and melt away in the butter. Easy and delicious.

After reading all the comments, I made these with 1 cup of pecans and one cup of chocolate chips, and mixed these into the batter rather than using them as a topping. These disappeared out of the kitchen so fast I couldn't believe it. Made this way, they're truly delicious.

This is a favorite among all my friends. I made it once and everyone loved it so much, I had to e-mail the recipe to four or five different people. I think it works better, though, if you double the chips (use a full bag) and mix them into the batter instead of spreading them on top. The chocolate melts in the middle that way and gives the center an awesome fudgy texture. I also eliminated the nuts because I don't really like them. Be careful about overbaking, as they will get very crunchy very fast.

This is the best blondie recipe I have tried! I made them with toasted pecans and toffee bits. I tried them with semisweet chocolate chips, but thought they detracted from the buttery flavor of these bars. Do watch how long you bake them, like you would a regular brownie. It will affect the texture (but the flavor is still great!).

Instead of Pecans, I topped with crushed toffee bars, Heath or SKOR, and chocolate chips. Great alternative if you don't care for nuts.
