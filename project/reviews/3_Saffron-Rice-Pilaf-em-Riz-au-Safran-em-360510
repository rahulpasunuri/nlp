This wound up a bit plain and bland. It might be better with either more saffron or by using broth instead of plain water. I used saffron threads rather than powder.

This was an AMAZING recipe! It tastes incredible! Beware, however, Saffron is REALLLLLLLY expensive. For a teaspoon it is probably about $20 to $30. We were able to find a little case of it for cheaper at Kroger's for $7.99 for a 1/2 gram, but most places only have the expensive kind from what I have heard. I would definitely make this again!

Made this for Rosh Hashanah and it was very good. I made it with brown rice and adjusted the liquid accordingly, but may have added a bit too much, as the rice was a little mushy. The pistachios add a nice crunch.
