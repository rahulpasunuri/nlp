This didn't really work out for me. I made 2/3 of the recipe using 1 T. + of lavendar and you couldn't taste it at all. The texture also wasn't that dreamy, smooth consistency you shoot for...it was rather dense and kind of chunky. Not sure what I might have done wrong. I also had trouble with the caramel portion. It took a very long time for the sugar to melt, and then it hardened so quickly in the ramekins I couldn't swirl it around the sides at all. They released ok from the forms, but there was a hard crust of caramel that just didn't release. Fortunately there was some sauce anyway. Had to soak the forms for quite a while to release the rest of the caramel. Think I better stick to something like panna cotta in the future. I love the lemon panna cotta with black berries on this site.

i've been making this dish over and over so many times!!! everyone loves it, even without the lavendar or the crust. just remember to cook on low heat to avoid bubbling the creme caramel. you'll get a nice and a rich smooth velvety texture. yummmm

The delicate flavour of lavender was delightful in the creme caramel. The coarse sugar in this part of the world doesn't dissolve well so some of the caramel base remained hard even after baking. Nevertheless, though a bit time consuming, the results are delicious and the texture of the custard is lovely. The presentation on a pastry shell gives the whole thing more substance--another nice touch.

This was fantastic, I made it for easter. I followed the recipe exactly and it was a huge success. Everyone wanted seconds. Next time I would make a sauce or use a garnish to give it some plate appeal. The lavender was a clean ending to a meal, but it was hard to find. I finally found it at the Spice House on Wells St, for anyone who is from Chicago...

Excellent dessert. I made it several times. I wouldn't skip the crust as it adds quite a bit to the whole thing. Also I don't find lavender taste too strong, I think it's just right.

I liked this recipe a lot. The first time I made it I found the dough was hard to work with so the second time I used shortbread tart dough. I also thought it could use one less egg and yolk. I actally made this the second time without the caramel in the ramekin but on the side and topped it with it when I was ready to serve it.

I thought this came out very well, the lavender flavour was really fantastic. (I used a bunch of flowers from the garden, I guess it was about 3 tablespoons). All the guests loved it.

This came out great!...even without the crust (I was short on time) But I used 2 Tablespoons of lavender and it was JUST right!

I agree that 3T of lavender is too much, but only barely. I would reduce only by one tbs. also, i substituted have of the sugar for honey, it gave a wonderful complexity to the dish and enhanced the caramel flavor.

delicious, smooth and light consistency. i left out the lavender, and tried different batches adding rum, cognac, citrus flower essence. and they all turned out delicious! the trick is in the oven tempature, and not to overbeat the eggs. the crust was a pleasant combination. very good!

I thought this was very pleasant and sophisticated. I did not find the lavender flavor overpowering. The texture was excellent and the pastry crust an interesting addition, although not necessary. I prefer to do this in individual tarts as its easier to turn out and is a lot easier than trying to cut the large one. Great company dessert garnished with candied or fresh flowers.

This was my first creme caramel and I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. However, anyone thinking of making this may want to halve the amount of lavender in the recipe. The lavender taste (which I normally love) was overwhelming.

Interesting but I tought that the lavender flavor was competing with the caramel. I still prefer the standard vanilla creme caramel. On the other hand I love everything with lavender, you should all try lavender creme brulee or lavender ice cream, delicious !

Nice texture, firm and silky. I didn't use the rosemary or the crust.

Incredible!! This was the hit of the party. The tart was surprisingly easy to make (although I did have a little trouble with the crust) and very delicious. The lavender was present but not overpowering. The violets were a charming garnish, but not vital.
