After reading the other reviews decided to mix the dough in the food processor, it came out perfect, had no trouble rolling it into logs. I used very soft butter,fresh grated and weighed the cheese to be sure it came to 4oz and chopped the nuts fine, i think those 3 things and seeing that it was well needed by the machine brought the dough together. The only thing I will change next time is to cut back on the salt.

These are amazing. Try them with sharp cheese. Some tips... I couldn't figure out the 4 oz (hey, I am not a baker or a cook) so I used 1 cup and it worked great. Use 1.5 sticks of butter (basically increase the butter by 50% They don't spread alot on the pan Enjoy!!

These are WONDERFUL!! Knead, knead, knead to get them to stick together. I wasn't able to slice the logs with a knife without causing them to crumble, but I was able to slice them easily with dental floss. Will definitely make these again!

I forgot to add - you can't get this to mix with just a spoon. I have to mix/knead it together with my hands and it sometimes takes several minutes to get it all incorporated. Even though it seems dry - if it holds together it's okay. Just refrigerate it for at least an hour. Delicious!

I don't understand the negative reviews. I made six batches this year for Christmas presents to rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I do use high quality flour, freshly grate the parmesan, and if the dough is too, too dry (inexplicably happens sometimes) I add a bit more butter. Unlike others, I do let mine cook 20 minutes - or just under. Also - I leave out the pepper and salt and sprinkle on both sides of the shortbread as soon as it comes out of the oven. These are like a drug to me - can't leave them alone!

It is pretty good but cook it for a lot less than 20 minutes. It probably depends on the thickness of the cookies but mine got slightly burnt in 12 minutes. Cheese lover's dream!

tasted good and smelled terrific but mine didn't hold together well enough. Refrigerated for two days as well.

Delicious and very easy. Use freshly grated parmesan from a big piece. I froze my two logs and have only used one so far, as it yielded about 24 pieces. Also only cooked for 10 mins. The results were gobbled up by our guests to much praise. Definitely a keeper.

An excellent savory treat! I make these all the time, served most recently with grilled beef tenderloin, a great combination. I whisk together the flour, rosemary, salt, pepper and nuts and that helps the dough remain together better. I did work it a bit with my fingers before putting into small logs. Chilling longer than 30 minutes also helps as well as fresh cheese.

I served these as part of a menu featuring fruit topped with apple and pancetta (without the meat for the vegetarians in the crowd). A huge hit...despite the problems with the dough which came out too dry to stick together and make slices. Also, the 20 minute cooking time is definitely too long...these are more like cookies which need a short time. I'll probably end up changing the recipe next time I make it...but I will definitely make it again!

Seems like teh comments fall into two extremes: love it, or extremely negative. I fall in the middle. given the problems other reveiwers had, I waited and added the flour last, making sure the mixture wasn't too dry to work with. I ended up with a dough that was easy and pleasant to work with. I rolled it into little cocktail fingers. That said, these were okay, not as wonderful as I had hoped. They were part of a buffet with tons of delicious food, and most did go,,,so my guests enjoyed them-just not the hit the description of the recipe or some of the other reviewers experienced.

Savory, buttery, delightful and delicious appetizer. My friends and my family love these and beg for them when I cook.

Absolutely dreadful! I can't understand why half of the reviewers had a miserable experience (as I did) and the other half raved! Crumbly, burnt, dirt, with a hint of rosemary and I put $10 worth of parmegiano regiano into these! Can anyone enlighten me as to why these went so horribly wrong?

These are an excellent rich snack that goes well with wine and beer. The flavor is great!! It seems some people are having problems with the dough cosistency though. I used chilled butter, and all other ingredients at room temp. I stopped to scrape down the butter because you need every bit to get the dough to stick together. I added the walnuts last, and that is when the dough started to consolidate.

These were a disappointment. I wanted very much to like them and ate 3 or 4 before chucking the rest. I found them very dry and strange tasting.

This dough was easy to make, and was a big hit. Reciepe was requested by two party goers. I used a good block cheese and froze the dough for a week ahead. No problems at all. Very good. I *did* not share my leftovers!

These were amazing. I have made batch upon batch for the holidays and have had many requests for the recipe. I also modified and used some other toasted nuts-although the walnuts impart the best flavor!

These are so easy to make and taste amazing! Great recipe.

These are wonderful...a perfect accompaniment to a glass of wine. After some experimentation, I found I got far better results rolling the dough into 4 oz balls and flattening them. This didn't impact the cooking time, but did make for an equally tender but better constructed "cookie" that held together better. A real hit!

A read all of the hints and had complete success - there were none left! I used slightly more firm than room temp butter, completely cooled walnuts and my standing mixer w/ paddle attachment to do the real mixing and I used parchment paper to roll and tighly squeeze the roll.

great recipe and very yummy. Dough freezes well. must refrigerate before cutting, and must cook for the whole 20 minutes or they will be crumbly. Make sure you cool before serving, or again, they can crumble more easily.

I made a double batch. Froze surplus dough for future use. Easy to slice when frozen. Very easy to form logs if you shape dough while in plastic wrap. Quite a tasty accompaniment to a glass of wine. I have made them multiple times and will use them with a bottle of wine for Christmas presents!?!?

it is an incredible recipe! use good quality parmesan. it is wonderful with martinis. everyone raves about these when i serve them. addictive!

I had problems getting the dough to hold together, as well. It seemed like a lot of cheese for the amount of butter. When the logs wouldn't hold (after refrigerating for 50 minutes and freezing for 15), I patted all of the dough into an eight-inch square pan and baked it for about 35 minutes. I sliced the shortbread after cooling - it still fell apart. The finished product tasted fine (a bit salty), but the recipe overall was a disappointment.

These are excellent. With regard to the problems expressed by other cooks, DO NOT use pregrated cheese; it is too dry. In addition, if your cheese is well aged it can also be dry. Combine all ingredients except for the flour. Incorporate the flour slowly and only add enough flour until the dough holds together. This should solve the "dry, cumbly" problems. I encourage you to try this recipe.

Nothing short of addictive! Everyone loves them - easy to make - chilling the dough & using Reggiano are critical to success. Suggestion of pairing with slice of pear was a great one!

I substituted 2 oz cheddar cheese and 2 oz parmesean and had everyone asking for more!!! Excellent, delicious shortbread!!

Rating: 4
This recipe looked really easy to make, so despite the negative reviews I thought I'd whip up a batch as a last minute amuse bouche. Happily, I can report that the results were excellent. Chilling the dough is a must, as is the fresh reggiano. When I served these, I added a few paper-thin slices of pear which really brought out the parmesan and made these little morcels look rather elegant.

I cannot imagine why the previous posters had such bad luck with these. Mine turned out wonderfully. Thy definiyely have to be refrigerated before slicing. Shortbread is a little more tricky than regular biscuit dough. Still, I had no problem shaping them into the log and baked as directed. Served them at a cocktail party and all were eaten, one guest even asked for a take out of them!!! Will definitely make more.

Two words...more butter. this recipe was a failure, not enough wine in the world to make these edible.

This was a dismal failure. Followed the recipe exactly and all we got was a bowl of flour. I think it is missing some sort of adhesive like an egg or something... We are trying to salvage it with the Rosemary shortbread recipe on Epicurious.

Rating: 1
These sounded great, but what a disaster! I admit to not being a big biscuit baker, but am a reasonable cook with nothing but success with recipes from Epicurious - until now! First mistake was not spacing the shortbread far enough apart - they really spread. Secondly, they just crumbled apart. Thirdly, can't say the taste was anything to write home about. I'll look forward to seeing how others go and will maybe try again if they have success. If anyone's got any pointers on where I went wrong, please let me know.
