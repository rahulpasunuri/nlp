3 1/2 forks...easy, good recipe. Used the achiote paste and used many other's suggestionsL added crushed red pepper to the marinade, roasted the red pepper and added fresh mint and cilantro for the salsa and finally didn't overcook the meat. Decided not to add the jalepeno to the salsa since that's the norm around here and wanted something different. It was great without it. Reserved some of the marinade and simmered it down to use on leftovers for tacos. Really, really good.

We made this the other night to eat with our roommates (with a salad of baby greens and homemade white wine vinaigrette). Everyone loved it! We made a few adjustments based on some of the previous comments that I would definitely recommend: 1) We added some red pepper flakes to the pork marinade (and might actually add a bit more next time); 2) we cooked the pork to 140 degrees - perfect; 3) we roasted the red pepper before adding it to the salsa. As I say this dish was a huge hit and I'd make both the pork and the salsa on their own at any given time, too.

This is a very easy dish with big payoff (especially if you double the recipe-the leftover pork and salsa make wonderful tacos, etc). I used dried chipotle powder and roasted the red pepper to add some smokiness/depth. Diced jicama adds a nice crunch.

I'd give it 3 1/2 forks, actually. As others have said, cooking a good pork loin to 160 degrees is bad news. I cooked it to 140 over medium indirect heat on a gas grill, then let it stand for 15 minutes in a covered dish. Moist, tender, fabulous. Now, about the recipes. The salsa and marinade both need salt (I added about 1 tsp kosher to each). I also doubled the lime juice and used half o.j./half pineapple juice. Roasting the red pepper really adds depth to the salsa, as does using a mixture of mint, cilantro and basil instead of just basil. A pinch of ground cumin or squirt of Sriracha are nice additions to the salsa, if you want to have it lean towards the spicy side.

For pinapple salsa, we used 1 serrano pepper and cilatro to make it more like a mexican spicy salsa.

Marinade was excellent... I just added a bit of cayenne and seasoned with salt, pepper and garlic before grilling. 160 degrees is a little overdone for me... I removed the tenderloins at 145 degrees and let stand for 10 minutes... they were slightly pink and moist inside. I also grilled the pineapple instead of browning in a pan. I'll definitely be using the marinade again!

Also took the advice of past reviewers that suggested the marinade needed more "heat" and added red pepper. I thought that the peppers in the salsa would be better diced.. they were too big just sliced. We let the tenderloin marinate for over a day and I think it made a big difference.. served with roasted asparagus.. overall, with a few tweaks, it was an excellent recipe!

Pork tenderloin cooked to an internal temp of 160 degrees til no longer pink, is a real waste of a nice cut of meat. In the photo, the pork is pink and juicy, the way it should be-- at 140 degrees. And the marinade needs salt. Otherwise the recipe is ok.

Tasty, but really needed heat and salt. I'd suggest the following and it will be much better: add 1/2-1 seeded, diced jalapeno w/ the pineapple salsa; add salt and 1/2-1 Tbsp. crushed red pepper flakes to marinade; reserve 1/2 c. of marinade BEFORE adding the pork and use when grilling halfway through. The flavors were just not there when I made it, but think there's potential!

My daughters made this for me for Father's Day. The oldest was concerned because she had started late and this needs to be marinated for 3 hours. We sliced the tenderloin and marinated for 90 minutes and grilled the filets over a hot fire for about 4 minutes a side. It worked fine. Salsa is extremely tasty with great contrasting textures.

good recipe, nice and easy. I used 1 TBsp pizza sauce instead of just plain tomato sauce and added the cayenne as mentioned in a review, nice touch not too much heat.

I'm always accused of being picky and from the other rave reviews, here I go again. I have to say I was expecting WOW and this was just okay. The only thing I did differently was triple the marinade (had two tenderloins) but used only 1 Tbl of chili powder because the one I had was super hot. I also marinated for 24 hrs., slit the tenderloins so the marinade would sink in as another reviewer recommended but it made for sloppy/floppy grilling and when you sliced the pork - it cut into pieces. Glad I didn't hand it off to my caterer to prepare for an upcoming grad party before trying.

I loved this recipe. I used a can of crushed pineapple and used a food processor for the onion, basil, and red pepper. I thought that texture worked well as a salsa.

wonderful recipe! I substituted red pepper flakes and cayenne for the chili powder. Also, I saved the marinate, making a second meal by heating it to a gentle boil for several minutes (as it was in contact with raw pork) added some of the grilled pineapple and the salsa ingredients (onion and chopped pepper) and served over grilled shrimp on a bed of cous cous. Excellent! The Pineapple salsa would be good with pan-seared chicken or pork strips too. oh, do marinate over night.

This was very good although I did alter a bit. I used canned pineapple and pineapple sauce in place of the orange juice. We all loved it!

I made this today and loved it. I put the pork in the marinade in a ziplock for about 20 hours....more time would only improve it! I added some cayenne pepper to the marinade as someone else suggested. I also increased the chili powder. Don't be afraid. It's only marinade... it won't overpower anything. I think I will split the tenderloin partway through lengthwise next time to have more marinade exposure, but recommend BBQ-ing it whole. I cooked it to 140 degrees, which was perfect. As some have recommended, I added about 1/2 a small jalopeno finely diced, to the salsa. Used a small dice for the red pepper and grilled the pineapple rings - about 1/2" thick, then sliced into pieces about 1/2" or smaller, and mixed in with the other salsa ingredients. I used basil from my garden, which was fabulous. The salsa is *amazing*. I'm glad I decided to run out & buy a pineapple! I served this with couscous (incidentally, the salsa works fabulously with the couscous!!) as well as a zucchini, split lengthwise & grilled - basted with olive oil & sprinkled with greek seasoning - then sliced & added to sauteed mushrooms & large chunks of red pepper. It was all *thoroughly* enjoyable! My folks are coming for a visit in a few weeks and I'm definitely making this for them.

I loved this recipe! My boyfriend and I have never marinated anything before, and it turned out wonderfully. We marinated the pork over night, which made it as juicy as could be the next morning. I would also reduce the basil in the salsa by a little. It was kind of overpowering. Bottom line: it's great.

Wow! Easy preparation with stunning results. Be careful with the chili powder -- mine was a bit hotter than I would have expected, but this makes an excellent entree for entertaining, as all the prep can be done in advance. And you can play around with the content of the salsa with impunity!

I marinated close to a day and a half and it was excellent. Definitely add jalapeno to the salsa, it needs it and is delicious. Also, grill the pineapple instead of cooking it in a pan - looks and tastes better. I saw a few that substituted cilantro for the basil but I thought the basil was excellent with the pork and pineapple.

Tasty and beautifully grilled. Make two pork loins while you're grilling--it's so yummy you'll want to share and savor for lunches. Definitely marinate overnight. And do not overcook, as already suggested. Thanks for all the reviews; you helped a beginning cook make a fine meal.

Made this for a small dinner party, it was the hit of the party. The only things I changed were to chunk the vegetables instead of thinly slicing, and I added 2 Tbls. of finely chopped jalepenos to the marinade.

Went with suggestions from reviews-cook till 140 on the thermometer. Perfect. Used Jalepeno in the salsa instead. It was a hit...

I didn't think the meat picked up a lot of the marinade flavor. I cooked mushrooms with the marinade on it and they were a great accompaniment for holding the flavor. The salsa is nice and pretty.

Made this recipe tonight for dinner, It's a hit! definitely will make it again with the followin modifications. Added 2 Tbs of chopped cilantro, and 1 Tbs of toasted White and Black sesame seeds to the salsa.

A solid 3 stars...I added some cayenne to the marinade based on the comments here, and just grilled the pineapple and red pepper with the pork. It was juicy with a nice flavor, and the pineapple contrasted nicely. Easy and worth repeating.

It's good, but next time I'm going to marinate the pork for more than 3 hours (maybe overnight) and add more chili pepper. I agree with the other reviewers that adding jalapeno gives the salsa a nice kick.

Great light bbq dinner...I swapped out cilantro for the basil because we like that flavor in a salsa. I think the recipe could use a little more heat so I might add some jalapeno to the salsa next time.

This is delicious but my family prefer my variation; Cut the meat into cubes before marinating and then thread onto skewers with chunks of pineapple, onions and peppers. Grill, basting regularly with leftover marinade and serve with cous cous.

I added a little sweet smoky paprika to the marinade, which boosted the flavor. I also agree with the previous poster about pulling off the meat at 140 instead of 160. It was moist and tender. Also think that adding a little bit of finely diced fresh jalapeno to the salsa to spice it up a notch.

I'm giving this two forks because of the ill-considered advice to cook the tenderloin to 160. If you like shoe leather, go ahead and ruin your lucious piece of meat. However, if you like your meat pink and juicy, pull your meat off the grill at 140 and let it rest for ten to fifteen minutes tented loosely under foil.

I will be happy to give a 4fork on this one. I am a big gril fan and anything with pinapple gets my attention. Bravo great meal!!

Easy, quick and delicious. The basil in the salsa is a nice change from cilantro and the taste is surprisingly satisfying for so few ingredients. I used pork loin instead of tenderloin b/c that's what I had on hand -- took slightly longer to cook, but still delish.
