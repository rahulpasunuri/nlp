Great recipe for kids - I'll be keeping this. I cut the chicken into nuggets (tenders) and dropped them in bread crumbs. I didn't feel like firing up the grill so I baked the nuggets for about 15 minutes and they were great. (I don't recommend baking the marinated chicken without bread crumbs - the marinade burns on the pan.)

My husband recently had surgery to correct an aneurysm in his mesenteric artery...The one that brings blood to intestines...Anyway, I was looking to feed him some bland food for a while and tried this...The kid's loved it, and so did my husband. It isn't a very exciting chicken recipe, but it works!

Make extra puree and put it in little cups for kids to dip the grilled chicken in.

This is a great quick and easy recipe that my four year old loves. The marinade time should be a bit longer i usually do at least an hour, overnight is best. I also perforate the chicken with a fork before putting in the marinade. 1 1/2 lbs makes a lot so I usually make a salad the next day.

Probably the worst recipe I've ever made. I choked down a few bites, but had to throw the whole thing out. I don't understand WHY this has a 4 fork rating?!

I only marinated it for 15 minutes and it only had a slight peach flavor. I will try doing it overnight next time for more flavor. My kids loved it. I thought the charred part gave it an odd taste but the chicken was very juicy inside :)

What an easy recipe...my 12 y/o daughter made it herself (with a bit of my help). We used frozen peaches without juice, increased the honey for added sweetness, and omitted the pepper (her choice). Yummy, simple delicious ingredients. For sure we will add this to our list of "Gracie's favorite dinners."
