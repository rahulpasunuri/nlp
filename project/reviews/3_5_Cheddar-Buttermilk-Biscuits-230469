I made as directed with the exception of reducing the salt a bit. I did not find them salty, rather the baking powder taste was too dominant. I was skeptical of the 4 teaspoons but forged ahead due to the good reviews. I would not make again but will try using my traditional biscuit recipe and subbing some cornmeal for flour.

I made these with a few changes. I followed the advice of some reviewers and used less cornmeal. I used 1/4 cornmeal and extra 1/2 cup of flour. I was out of chives so I added chopped sun-dried tomato (totally different than chives, I know) and I added about 3 tblsp worth of grated zucchini, thinking of my 15 month old and her veggie intake. After I had measured out 3 biscuits for my daughter, I added chopped jalapenos to the rest of the batter. The biscuits were amazing! I made them with the sloppy joe recipe, but both my husband and my daughter wanted the plain biscuits. The zucchini made them moist, which was nice. Sometimes biscuits tend to be dry but these turned out great.

Interesting yummy biscuits. I made a half batch, cut the BP to 1 1/2 teas, scant 1/2 teas. salt, used garlic chives instead of scallions. Out of buttermilk, so I thinned greek yoghurt with milk to buttermilk consistency, used about 1 cup total. Baked them per the recipe on parchment paper on an airbake cookie sheet. Yield 10 2-3" biscuits. Great!

Soooo delicious! And really easy. I added coarsely ground black pepper for a little spice - a pretty conventional solution, but it fit perfectly. We used these biscuits to make little breakfast sandwiches...definitely the right move!

I had half a batch of leftover veggie chili in the freezer. we were doing our spring cleaning the other day, so i pulled the chili out for a quick low-mess dinner. I was planning on making some cornbread to go with the chili, but realized I didn't have eggs until it was too late to get to the store... so biscuits it was!!! I was going to make my standard biscuits, but saw that I had some scallions and chilies in the fridge, so I decided to jazz it up. In addition to the cheese and scallions I added a jalepeno with seeds, serrano chili and about 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (we like spicy). I didn't have buttermilk, so I subbed regular milk with a spoonful of plain yogurt. I followed the directions otherwise. I could see how these would be too salty, but the saltiness worked with the veggie chili (which had lots of beans, corn and carrots). If serving the biscuits on their own, I would reduce the salt by half. I dropped the dough by the spoonful (I got a dozen out of it) into a casserole on top of the chili. baked at 425 for about 30 minutes, til the biscuits were cooked through. I covered the dish with foil for the last 15-20 min to keep the biscuits from burning. my boyfriend (who doesnt love vegetarian food) said, "wow, you actually made veggie chili taste GOOD!" He ate seconds and thirds! He also said he wants to cook this next time it's his turn to cook at the firehouse!

Easy peasy recipe with good outcome. Substituted cake flour for A/P flour. Used colby from freezer, eliminated the scallion and eliminated the parm. Buicuits had a light and fluffy crumb with a very mild hint of cheese. These busicuits rise in the oven more than I expected.

Good thing I reserved half of the batter so I could adjust the second batch. These biscuits have a good consistency; but they are extremely bland, even with the cheddar and scallions. I like strong flavors so I made the following adjustments: added 1T unrefined sugar, 1/4 t salt, 4 chopped fresh serrano peppers, additional 1/2 cup cheddar. Next time I'll try less 1/4 c cornmeal and increase the flour to 2 cups.

A bit too salty, and if I made them again I might substitute chives for the scallions. Also a little weird with the cornmeal. Not really your traditional biscuit if that's what you're looking for. OUr houseguests claimed to like them, but they are very polite people. I was underwhelmed.

Rating: 4
These biscuits were on the salty side, otherwise they were great. I did not have scallions on me so I substituted jalapeños with the seeds and ribs removed. I also used an aged sharp white cheddar which made the biscuits taste WONDERFUL. I followed all the ingredients otherwise. I felt that the batter was very sticky. Also I would have pushed down the mounds of dough a little as they did not flatten out much as it baked. Great texture and flavor.

Fabulous! Made them precisely as directed and couldn't be happier with the result. I will definitely make these again, especially for things like hearty soups/stews, chilies and Sloppy Joes.

Not bad! I halved the salt, used extra-sharp cheddar, and decreased the baking time to about 10-11 minutes, all as suggested by other reviewers. Definitely keep your eye on them toward the end of the baking time, as they brown quickly. I'm not sure I'm 100% crazy about the corn meal in these biscuits. Maybe what I used was too coarse, but the texture was kind of gritty in my biscuits. Overall, though, good!

Always a favorite at brunch. There is no buttermilk where i live, so i substitute it with 1/3c. low fat yogurt+1c. water. Works fine.

These biscuits were great. I followed the previous reviewers advice and cut the salt in 1/2. I also added some jalapeno peppers and bacon bits to the mix. Definately a keeper.

These biscuits were delicious, tangy and so tender. The whole family enjoyed them. I loved that the dough didn't need to be rolled out. They are on the salty side though and next time I will reduce the salt to a 1/2 tsp. Didn't have scallions so used dried chives but other than that, followed the recipe.

Based on the other reviews I cut down on the cornmeal, added more butter and left out the salt. Should've left some salt in as it turned out bland. Sage or dill would have added more flavor to it as well. I loved that it was quick and easy, will make this again in the future.

These are good. I only had mild cheddar on hand, so they didn't taste as cheesy as I would have liked. They were really easy and quick to make.

I made this last night, so easy to make, great texture and amazing flavor. I made some fried chicken fingers and used them to make fried chicken finger sandwiches with side condiments of pepper jelly and pickled watermelons + a bottle of Slingshot cabernet from Napa. Mmmm my fiance loved it!!

I made these with fried chicken last night and though I omitted the scallions and added romano and manchego to the cheddar, I really loved them. They were so easy to make and delicious with butter. My fiance ate three of them. I definitely plan to make them again.

Excellent. I made a 1/2 recipe, using 1 cup flour, 1/4 cup white corn meal, 3T salted butter and no salt (everything else I cut in 1/2). They were perfect. I had chicken in the convection oven at 350; so I added the biscuits during the last ten minutes and turned the oven up to 425. The biscuits cooked perfectally - crispy on the outside, moist in the middle. I probably had them in there about 12 to 14 minutes total. They were not sandwich size so that is probably why I got the good results.

I added a small can of chopped jalapenos and some cut up pieces of bacon to this recipe and it came out delicious!

These biscuits are as simple as they are fluffy & delicious. The recipe is a great way to use up some of those ingredients you may have in your refrigerator. I halved the recipe & still ended up with 6 sizable biscuits. I also added a bit more buttermilk to my recipe as well.

These are *sooooo* good! Based on other reviewers' advice, I added 2 tbsp. of butter and chopped fresh sage and I also had to increase the buttermilk to 1 1/2 cups. I actually got 15 fairly large biscuits out of it (not 8, as stated in the recipe). My hubby and I devoured a couple as soon as they came out of the oven. These are very easy to make and delicious. Highly recommended.

This is a nice, homey recipe. They're cheesey but not overwhelming. In retrospect, I would have cooked them about 12/13 minutes, not 15, as they were just a tad too brown on the bottom when I took them out.

Oh, and had to add 2 more T of butter, like a previous reviewer.

I really liked this recipe. 1/2 it & actually cooked it a little longer on accident. I thought I burned them, but they had a nice crisp on the top. Made them to go along with the white bean & chorizo soup. The corn meal gives it a perfect crunch & not too much corn flavor. Didn't put any green onion & added fresh ground black pepper...lots of it.

really enjoyed them. Left out the scallion. only made to eat alone. added salt (I like salty stuff didn't find them too salty) they came out flat but my baking powder is alittle old. recommend them

I've made this recipe twice. Leaving out the scallions makes it a more flexible item. An adjustment that I would highly recommend is omitting the salt - it's plenty salty with all the baking soda!

I wound up adding about 2 tbl more butter to make the dough adhere to itself a bit better; while it was sticky and a bit of a mess to work with, the overall flavor of the biscuits and eventual texture wasn't bad at all. The sloppy joe mix with it was a big disappointment, however.

Rating: 2
Made to go with the turkey sloppy joes. Hubby loves the biscuits. I liked them, but they had trouble handling the weight of the joe mix. So much so that we tackled these "sandwiches" with fork and knife. Much better as a standalone item than as a delivery vessel.

what i turned out were not biscuits. would incorporate the idea of sharp cheddar and parm with scallions into a biscuit recipe that works.

Rating: 1
Wasn't real crazy about these. Easy to make, but the cornmeal makes the texture more like cornbread than biscuits. I like cornbread. I like biscuits, but I'd prefer one or the other rather than this combination of the two.

Rating: 2
I loved the ease and texture of these biscuits but would definitely leave out the scallions next time. Blechhh. A very jarring note in an otherwise wonderful recipe. Perhaps chives or rosemary would be better? It would definitely bring it up to 3 forks IMO to ditch the scallions.

Nice crusty biscuits. Did not have scallions so made it without. Keep an eye on the clock as mine were a little overdone at 15 minutes.
