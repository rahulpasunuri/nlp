I made this for a special Christmas dinner for our wine group. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and increased the salt, pepper and hot pepper sauce in the salmon mixture. For the spinach mixture, I added some lemon zest and nutmeg and tasted both mixtures before cooking. Using a thermometer was necessary as it took longer than 55 minutes to cook. My husband and I taste tested a small slice with the Cucumber Dill sauce and both decided that the sauce was too sour. I made a vinaigrette with shallots, walnut oil and lemon juice and served the terrine on a small bed of baby greens with the vinaigrette drizzled on top. We served this with a white burgundy. My guests raved and asked for the recipe - I'll make this again!!

To Joseph15: Exactly the recipe I am trying to locate. It was published in the 80's and it was glorious. A two colored terrine of salmon and white fish on a bed of watercress. This one is almost there.

This recipe reminds me of one I am scratching my mind to remember. It was for a seafood terrine. It had a beautiful presentation of White layers, dark green layer and orange. I think it was published about the early 80's. You made a mousse of Scallops & heavy cream made one layer of the scallop mousse then you poached some spinach and mixed the scallop mixture and spinach then another layer of the scallop mixture, then a layer of rich red salmon chunks followed by a final layer of the scallop mixture. Served with a vingearette. Does any body have that recipie??

I am sorry, but I disagree with the others on this recipe. The presentation was lovely, but it is tasteless. I followed the recipe exactly, what am I missing?

I've made it several times, and every time got rave reviews. The last time, at Easter, I wanted a more interesting presentation, so I doubled the recipe and baked it in a Bundt pan. It was delicious as always and the presentation was wonderful.

I love this recipe and have made it every year since it was published. Everyone loves it, the sauce is awesome, and I haven't found it to be too dry. I make it in a fish-shaped copper pan, and the presentation is fabulous. I'm thankful to have found something great to make in that pan!

This is great but a few caveats. DON'T forget or omit the salt - the terrine gets too dry in the oven. DON'T overcook - it took much less in my oven than the recipe said - I used a meat thermometer to check frequently after about 30min. The sauce is lovely but to serve to 12 people I tripled the sauce amount because you want to be liberal with the sauce. Have made this twice - will make again.

My fiancee made this Xmas eve. It certainly looked very impressive and got a few rave reviews from those who appreciated something "different" from the typical holiday buffet fare. I personally thought the dish was tastier in it's progress rather than the final result which I found to be a tad dry and bland. The dill sauce is definitely needed as it adds flavor and mositure.

Very easy, impressive-looking. It's great for a dinner party. Arrange with a few strips of cucumber skin and a sprig of fresh dill for a nive presentation.

Wonderful, easy, and impressive looking. A great idea for a starter fish course on a bed of lettuce.

We don't get bay scallops, so I used little shrimp, and it was good. I find the recipe is better when it's taken out of the fridge in advance so that it is not too chilled.

Super recipe!! Easy and very impressive. Best of all it can be fixed ahead of time.

I made this for a dinner party this weekend as the starter. It was a big hit, and it wasn't difficult to make. The cucumber-dill sauce spooned around a slice of the terrine on a plate looked lovely.

I made this dish to serve at a party a few months ago. It was the hit of the evening. I served it with various crackers on a buffet table. It was gone in minutes. I must have had a dozen requests for the recipe.
