I liked the cilantro suggestion, and also added lemon juice and feta cheese. I also substituted (chicken) chorizo for the pepperoni and found the dish fantastic!

I made some adjustments to this dish and it turned out really well. I omitted the pepperoni and shrimp. For the dressing, I made it with 2 tbls olive oil and 1 tbls vinegar, chopped cilantro and 2 cloves pressed garlic. I also added chopped red and green bell peppers for color. I served it at room temperature and it was great!

A great side dish for a mexican meal. I dressed it down a bit and omitted the shrimp, peperoni and vinegar. I also added some frozen peas and carrots.

My husband and guest really liked this salad. I think next time I make it I will put a little fresh cilantro in it. I added some red pepper flakes for spice. I could make the rice in my rice maker which was nice.

It's really about one and a half forks. In two words - bland and boring. Flavors don't meld and the white wine vinegar is just a bad idea. I added more tomato paste but that didn't jazz it up either. Much superior rice salads out there.

Tasted rather oily--I would use less olive oil.

This was an interesting mix of flavors, and we really liked it. Next time, I'll probably add red and yellow peppers to give it a nice blend of colors.
