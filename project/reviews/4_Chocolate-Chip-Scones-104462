I may have been the reason I gave this recipe just 3 forks. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 3/4 cup of cream adding 1 TBSP lemon juice and let the mix sit for 5 minutes before using. Boy, did the cream thicken up fast! I also only had salted butter and regular sized chocolate chips. They came out so so. My buds were searching for a nutty taste, so next time I'll add some filberts or pecans. I liked the regular sized choco chips though. Mini's would be too small for my tongue to appreciate. I think the nuts were what was missing, plus I should have used unsalted butter. They are definitely getting eaten though! Not a problem!!

Wonderfully delicious recipe! However, the dough was extremely wet and sticky. I was unable to move the cut scone dough for baking. Instead, I sliced through the dough and separated the scones as best I could. After about 12 minutes of baking, I took the scones out of the oven, ran the knife through them again and finished baking them. Mine took about 23 minutes to bake to perfection. Next time I make this (and my family has already requested more), I will reduce the amt. of milk. Other than that, the recipe was ideal!

Very good, although I would recommend cutting the dough into 8 wedges not six, unless you want truly enormous scones. Following others suggestions, I omitted the lemon peel, grated in the butter (much easier!), and used parchment paper. Easy and delicious! After 18 minutes, my scones were perfect: slightly golden, cooked through, but not dry.

When my local Whole Foods stopped carrying chocolate chip scones, I was upset; I'd come to look forward to having one each weekend morning - starting the day off with a bit of delicious decadence! Then I found this recipe, and life is good again! I make a batch or two, freeze them, and, when I serve them, savor every bite.

I've been making these scones for years. Always amazing. My husband and kids ask for them all the time. I omit the lemon and add orange zest. Another variation is white chocolate chips with dried cranberry or apricot. So good!

Awesome! I made these for Christmas presents (see date-lol). Just took them out of the oven and they are AWESOME! As previous reviewers noted, the dough is sticky. If you still want the wedge look, wet your knife each time you cut the dough into a wedge (like a pie). Then *without* wetting your knife, use the knife to transfer each piece to your prepared baking sheet. --the first one comes out a bit off (just like the first piece of pie would), but the rest were perfect!

Finally a recipe for chocolate chip scones that did not disappoint. Although delicious warm, they are still yummy the next day; they have a very good crumb. I agree with another reviewer that the lemon zest was too heavy. I might skip altogether next time.

This has become my go-to recipe for any time I need to come across as a skilled baker! It's so easy yet so delicious-- I've actually found I can't eat scones at cafes anymore, because this recipe blows them all away. You can definitely substitute in wheat-flour, for a slightly healthier take.

As many other have said, these are fantastic. I did them as drop scones because the dough was so sticky. They came out light and fluffy, crisp/crunchy on the outside and moist inside. Next time i will omit the lemon, as my family did not care for the faint lemon taste with the chocolate.

Easy and delicious with a great texture! I substituted dried cranberries for the chocolate chips and sprinkled sliced almonds on top. I don't think the sprinkled sugar was necessary, especially if you tend to like less sweet scones. I'll definitely keep this recipe on hand!

Delicious and super easy. I used the food processor to cut in the butter and add the liquid, then mixed in the chocolate chips by hand at the end. I washed with the left-over egg white and sprinkled on tons of turbinado sugar and it made a wonderful crunchy topping.

though the scones dont end up as big as the ones i watched my mother make while growing up, they turn out great each time and i can use the base recipe to make many variations. Last weekend i made white chocolate cran/blueberry scones, and they were eaten by company in under an hour of pullin from oven.

I've been making these for years now, and like most reviewers, can't sing the recipe's praises enough. I've made some adjustments that have made them even more appealing to my family. The big switch is to cinnamon chips (Hershey's makes them, although they aren't in every grocery store). Other than that, I do use a little extra buttermilk which seems to give them a lighter consistency and top them with raw sugar crystals instead of refined sugar - nice texture difference. I also make it easier on myself by incorporating the cut up butter using a food processor - just run for about 9 seconds. Quick and easy. I also find that the scones are huge, and even cut into 8 pieces, they're still plenty large. Give this one a try - you won't regret it.

This recipe is THE BEST. I have used it as a base for many, many different versions of scones. It has never failed me. I have made a new discovery when it comes to these scones as well. After I cut the butter into the flour, I put the bowl into the freezer so the butter can freeze and get as cold as possible. Once frozen, I take it out, add the wet ingredients and anything else I'm adding, drop the scones onto parchment paper and immediately put into the freezer, unbaked. On the morning I want to have them, I pop them in the 400 degree oven for 17-20 minutes, or until they look done. They come out beautifully! I have tried it with cranberry orange, ham and cheese (I omit the sugar for that) and for Christmas I did cranberry chocolate chip and sprinkled the top with red and green decorating sugar. Then, I delivered to friends with baking instructions. SO...what I'm trying to say in a very verbose manner is that this recipe is fabulous! You will not regret trying it! Merry Christmas!

Loved the recipe even though I made them into blueberry lemon scones. Omitted chocolate, added a cup or so of blueberries. Did cook them a few minutes longer than suggested because last time I made these I found the scones to be a little bit undercooked. I think this is a great basic scone recipe that can be varied greatly w/ add-ins.

I've made these scones a dozen times now; sometimes for brunch parties and sometimes just for ourselves. I especially like to make them right before we travel as pick-me-up snacks for the car or the plane. They are really wonderful -- not too sweet as a breakfast food and not too breakfasty to have as a snack between lunch or dinner, or just right as a dessert. I really enjoy the little tang that the lemon zest gives. Really great recipe.

I loved these. I used orange peel instead of the lemon because I didn't have a lemon and they turned out great. Not too sweet and a good scone texture.

Although these were quickly eaten up by my family, I did not consider them a 4 fork scone. I used a mixture of dark chocolate and white chocolate chips - which I thought was a great combination - but the actual scone was somewhat tasteless and unremarkable, in my opinion. As far as scone recipes go, this seems to be one of the more healthy ones...however, next time I make scones I will try one of the less healthy whipping cream versions!

Rating: 4
To my friends, this is what I'm known for. Everytime someone tastes one of these scones, they tell me that I should open a bakery =) Though, I leave out the lemon peel because I don't like the taste of it. And I also use a mixture of white chocolate chips and semisweet chocolate chips (regular sized)

These were awesome! I made them for my husband, who's been after me for scones for a while now, and he ate three in one sitting! I used regular chocolate chips and orange peel intead of the lemon peel. Also, instead of milk, I used the left over egg white as a wash with the sprinkled sugar on top! Delish! Will definitely make again!

I thought these were okay, but nothing special. The dough was extremely wet and sticky - I tried forming them into wedges, but there was no way that was going to happen, so I made drop scones instead. I added about 1/3 cup more of flour but the dough was still too sticky. These were more like puffy cookies than scones. I prefer the Cranberry-Tangerine Scones and the Ginger Scones from this site.

Rating: 3
These were delicious scones. I subbed half the AP flour for whole wheat and they were delicious. I feel adding some whole wheat flour makes them seem more nourishing for breakfast. I also didn't have a lemon, so I substituted about 1 Tbs. cinnamon. I'd like to try these substituting some of the flour with cocoa powder and adding some orange zest. I used Hershey's semi-sweet chips, which I think are a bit sweet. This would be good with a really good quality chocolate. This were very easy too.

Rating: 4
This recipe produced the best scones I've ever had, and I not a gifted baker by any means. It's a (relatively) healthy recipe, easy to put together, fantastic texture and flavor, and you can make the dough ahead of time...not really much more you can ask for in a recipe. They are of course best hot from the oven, but I had one after it had cooled for a few hours, and it was still better than anything I've had from a coffee shop. The citrus zest was a really nice touch -- don't skip it. I'm considering orange zest for next time, might be a nice play off of the chocolate. Only caveat I can think of is to be careful with the milk -- any that drips onto the baking sheet or under the scone will burn and give a bitter flavor to where it sticks to the scone. Definitely important to keep the milk on top of the scone.

Made the recipe as shown, except replaced chocolate chips with dried currants. Made it the night before and put the pan (used a pizza pan)in the fridge. The next morning I let it sit on the counter for 20 minutes then put it in the oven. Was not too dry, like coffee house scones. Cut it into 8 wedges and then cut 1 wedge again for grandson. Everyone was surprised how delicious they were, especially for a first time recipe. Had just enough buttermilk left so made my daughter a batch and put it on plastic wrap on a paper plate for her to bake when she got home. As far as the sticky dough, I sprinkled the counter with flour, plopped the dough on that, then put a little on the top and patted it easily into an 8" circle. Where it got sticky, I sprinkled a little more flour. Also when cutting the dough, on the first cut there was a little dough stuck to my knife. I covered it with the leftover flour on my counter and cut it again and it didn't stick as much. Continued that with each cut.

This is a great recipe and it is easy to make variations. I have added cinnamon instead of lemon zest and made them with and without chips. My next variation will be cinnamon and maple syrup flavoring. Also, they are healthy compared to a lot of other scone recipes. Sometimes I add some whole wheat flour, too. I am sure I will be making these in years to come!

Since this recipe first appeared, I have made it for all noteworthy mornings, such as the holidays, birthdays, or other special occasions. My older boys, who just went off to college, request the scones when they are home for the weekend and I am happy to oblige. I always double the recipe, don't use the zest, but a squeeze of lemon juice instead. Often, I will make in advance and freeze in a single layer, and then store the frozen scones to "pop in" as the kids wake up in the morning. These are easy and wonderful. I usually reserve some of the dough before the chips are added to equal two scones and throw in dried cranberries or something other than the chips for my husband and I. The only trouble I have had with this recipe is when it is very hot and humid out....the dough is harder to handle and then should be chilled first. This is our family's favorite!

Rating: 4
Ssssh! Don't tell anyone, but this is the secret to my famous cinnamon scones. I simply replace the chocolate chips with cinnamon chips and voila! Better than the Cinnamon Chip Scones from Starbucks. I'm constantly asked to bring these to brunches. Like many other reviewers I find the dough hard to work with so I make them into drops and get about 24 from a recipe. People LOVE the smaller size since they're so rich. I also drizzle a simple icing (powdered sugar/milk) on top when they're completely cooled. I've doubled and even tripled this recipe with the same success.

These were delicious and incredibly easy to make (this from a scone-phobe who's always afraid of over-handling the dough). I sifted everything right into the food processor and followed all the steps, mixing the entire recipe in the processor (using the plastic blades to avoid chopping up the chocolate chips). I tried using both a sharp knife & a pizza cutter to cut the scones; the knife worked better. Used regular-sized chocolate chips, and they were great.

Rating: 3
My daughter made these first and used a whole bag of bittersweet chocolate chips - they were very sweet but very delicious! I made them again just a two days later because they were so easy and yummy, and this time my 7-year-old made them with me. Another reviewer said this recipe was very kid friendly - they were right. Next time, I might eliminate the chocolate all together because I love the delicate lemon flavor and think it could stand on its own. Baking time was about 18 minutes for me.

Rating: 4
Yum! We've made these twice now; my 12 yr. old son made the first batch. It's a great kid recipe. We followed what a previous reviewer had done with half whole wheat flour. We, too, used big chips (can't find good quality litte ones), and instead of trying to deal with the sticky batter as many reviewers noted, we used the "drop" method. It makes lovely round scones. Cooking time was about 15 mins like many said. These are so good! Tasty in the morning with a nice strong cup of Central American coffee.

Rating: 4
These are really excellent and pretty simple to make. The lemon zest really makes them worth 4 forks instead of 3--a delicious addition. Previous reviewers are absolutely right that the cooking time is less than 20 minutes (start checking at 15 min); regular sized chips work just fine; and extra flour is pretty crucial if you want to be able to shape the dough into a circle (otherwise the dough just sticks to your fingers). I also found that wetting my knife before each cut made it far easier to create wedges. They are large if you make only 6, but if it's your whole breakfast it's a good size (still a little smaller than Starbucks size).

Rating: 4
Very easy and delicious recipe. I didn't have buttermilk so used whole milk instead. Also regular sized chocolate chips aren't as dainty but are equally tasty. Plus they make a 3 1/2 year-old girl very happy.

Snowy Sunday; I pulled these together for sleepy teens who don't emerge until noon. I was hesitant about the lemon zest and chocolate mix, but I have to say it worked, and the kids appreciated them. Lemon zips the flavor so much so my husband thought the tiny chocolate chips were currants until I notified him otherwise. (He was oblivious due to being excited about not eating diet food)Patted out a circle and cut wedges. Buttermilk and sugar on top produces a golden scone. I will cut the wedges smaller next time as they made very large servings.

Dough was sticky-- should add at least 1/4 cup of flour the next time, per batch. Used a scone pan, which helped mold the dough. Maybe would add more chocolate chips next time. Scones turned out great, very moist...will definately make again.

Amazing! Dough was a little sticky, so I used some extra flour in the final process. Also - watch your oven; I removed them early and they were perfect! The lemon zest is a great addition. Next time, I'll try orange zest. Enjoy! Cheers from Scottsdale, AZ!

These scones are delicious. I agree with previous reviewers that the lemon zest adds a pleasant, unexpected brightness. I used regular chocolate chips instead of mini, simply because that's what was in the cupboard, and 1 cup regular + 1 cup whole wheat flour. Baking time in my (old) oven was 17-18 minutes. The only thing I'd like to alter next time is the scones' appearance. My batter was very sticky/gummy and the scones look like drop scones. That said, they're tasty and moist! I'd just prefer for them to be a better shape. Did I not mix long enough? Should I have added a little extra flour? Guidance appreciated!

Rating: 4
This recipe is amazing. The scones come out golden brown, crisp on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. This makes a less dense, less dry scone, which is what I prefer. The lemon zest, an unexpected ingredient, gives the scones the oomph to propel this recipe to "must-make" status.

Ever since Starbucks discontinues their chocolate chunk scones, I've been looking for an alternative. Here it is! I recommend using crystalized sugar (like the kind you use to decorate cookies) with the milk glaze. They glisten a bit more. I also prefer to form the dough in to a rectangle, divide into four squares, then eight triangles. It makes two more, and there was pleanty of dough!

This scones were delicious!!!! I actually also used some white chocolate chips along with the semi-chocolate chips, which added a bit more of yummy gooey-ness to the scone without making the chocolate to intense. Also, I used egg white(1 egg white) instead of milk for the sugar crust topping. The scones come out delicious- they were gone within a couple days- although, as a warning, the portions sizes were huge, so next time I make them(tomorrow!) I will definatley cut them smaller- perhaps I'll cut them into 10-12 scones, as opposed to 6. Overall, these are perfect for tea time, breakfast, or dessert- I give them a big, fat thumbs-up!!!!!!

I changed this recipe significantly since I was basically just looking for a scone dough recipe.

An Excellent Recipe! The lemon zest rounds out the flavors and gives it a light and clean taste. I didn't roll and cut wedges as the recipe states. Instead, I just scooped a healthy amount of dough with a spoon and placed on cookie sheet in circular mounds. Variations I have made: *When glazing with milk, dust with generous amount of cinnamon and sugar *Make icing with 1 cup of powdered sugar mixed with 2 tbsp milk, dash of cinnamon, vanilla extract and squeeze of lemon. Drizzle over cooled scones. Delish and Decadent!

I was a bit hesitant about the pairing of lemon and chocolate, but these were excellent. The tangy buttermilk and lemon zest offset the smooth chocolate chips nicely.
