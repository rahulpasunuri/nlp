This was a huge hit at our Passover seder last year and I can't wait to make it again this year. Like the other reviewer said, it needs more salt but the matzoh balls with fennel were delicious and a refreshing alternative to ones made with the schmaltz. My husband's comment: seder food isn't supposed to be this good! : )

We decided to make this because it seemed a creative take on matzoh ball soup. The fennel adds a delightful kick and I would definitely make this again. The low sodium broth left something to be desired, namely salt, though a heavier hand on other seasonings, such as the pepper, were also needed. Make sure you do not overcook and serve immediately once ready. Failure to do so results in limp asparagus.
