Just made this for me and my husband. He really enjoyed it and even mentioned how moist the pork chops were. Instead of rye bread crumbs, I used panko like so many others.

This was a quick and tasty weeknight dish. I did not have rye bread; so I used a combination of English muffins and ciabatta. The mustard crumbs were amazing! Even the kids loved this!

Have made this many times in the last few yrs. Right now, I do not have enough rye bread, so I will add some panko, as others have. Since I do not have fresh sage, I will try using the dried Italian herbs I have. This is a pretty easy recipe, so I reccomend it to anyone who wants to enjoy something easy and tasty with a twist.

Delicious. 1/2ed ingredients. Rye crumbs, great flavor. Wonderful recipe. Served with brussels sprouts from Williams-Sonoma.com (with bacon and thyme) and a simple, crisp, green salad. Highly recommended!

yummy. used too many breadcrumbs, but they went really well with the cauliflower that I served with the chops. Will make this again and again

This is a really quick, tasty recipe. Great when you want to use bread slightly past its expiration date. I made my own breadcrumbs by toasting the stale bread and breaking it down with my fingers. I also used McCormick's Italian seasoning dried herbs as I didn't have fresh herbs. I used dijon mustard but was careful to use a thin layer so it would not be too sour. Would certainly make it again, husband loved it.

The crust on this was delicious. I substituted panko bread crumbs for the rye bread crumbs. I probably won't make this on the pork chops again as the cooking method did not result in a tender chop. However, I will definitely make the crumbs again and possibly use on chicken or a different cut of meat.

Very good! I left out the sage (we didn't have any) and substituted cornbread for the rye bread; it made the topping sweet and buttery. I would definitely make again.

Very delicious weeknight dish. I made it exactly as directed and it was very good. The mustard crumb topping was almost like a crumbly dressing. Very tasty. I will make this again.

Three forks for how easy this is. Obviously not as yummy as recipes with a lot more ingredients and more steps. But strangely GOOD for how easy!! -a great weeknight meal. And I just used ready-made, breadcrumbs. (from whole foods not a kind with hydrogenated oil.)

Rating: 3
Very good, but definitely missing something that I can't put my finger on. I might try a milder mustard (I used a heavy-grained country dijon), or add some additional herbs to the breadcrumbs next time, but definitely one to add to the regular rotation.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. Made breadcrumbs from multi-grain with flax bread for it's interesting texture and nutty flavour and added a bit of chicken broth to the mixture so it wasn't quite so dry and didn't burn while meat was cooking. Increased time in the oven, put meat thermometer in the center of thickest chop and cooked to 170 degrees and they were cooked perfectly. Will definitely make this recipe again and possibly try grainy mustard instead of dijon.

I used over 1 inch chops for this receipe and was amazed at how moist and delicious they turned out!

Fast, easy and only one cast iron skillet. I use italian bread crumbs and, sometimes add shallots. My mom loved it and for those who don't eat pork - it works great with a slightly pounded chicken breast.

These pork chops were delicious. I found using Italian bread crumbs worked very well too.

I was very pleased with this recipe. All the flavors and textures went together very well. I loved the way the bread crumbs toasted after being in the oven for a bit. The dijon mustard cooked into the tender pork was a very satisfying combonation. I served this with whipped potatoes and a combonation of broccoli/baby corns/sweet corn and applesauce on the side. The kids loved it too.

This is a terrific weekday meal-Start to finish in under 30 minutes. I use whatever bread I have around to make crumbs and spice it up a bit. Great sliced thin and served over a mixed green salad.

These were really good. The bread crumbs smelled wonderful when I sauted them. I added some grated parmesan before baking. I'll make these again -- with a little less salt next time.

Not much to add, followed recipe as written. It was tasty and simple to prepare. Will do it again.

This is a great recipe because it is super easy and it tastes really good. I thought the chops had a lot of flavor and they were very tender. I am not a big fan of pork chops because I do not like the texure - these were juicy and tender! I doubled up on the dried sage (I was out of fresh) and I used French bread with garlic cloves baked into it from Costco. There was no need for me to add more garlic since there were whole cloves in the bread. The pork chops I made were very BIG so they took more like 12 minutes instead of 7. A great weeknight quick dinner!

Delicious. Didn't need to use the oil, since I have a nonstick pan. Used regular breadcrumbs intead of rye and served it with a side of sauteed kale with garlic, rings of onion and dried cranberries. Marvelous taste, nice presentation... and it went together quickly (though I did need just a tad longer than the 7 min in the oven for it to finish.... A 2000 Perrin Reserve Cotes du Rhone complimented it all nicely.

Will definitely hold on to this recipe. My husband and I both thought that it was a flavorful dish - it wasn't spicy, but it certainly wasn't bland either. The combination of searing on the stovetop and then cooking them more thoroughly in the oven resulted in very juicy chops. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I served it with mashed potatoes and roasted carrots (cut them into matchsticks and tossed with olive oil, salt, and pepper and baked at 425 for 20 minutes)... garnished with carrot tops for a nice presentation.

Even though my husband and I feel that the best pork chop recipe ever is "Pork Chops and Applesauce" (also on this site), I tried this mustard crumbs recipe tonight (felt it would compliment other menu items better). It was very good and nice and moist. Used pumpernickel bread crumbs and felt I had way more crumbs than needed, so next time I would cut down on them. After browning the chops, I baked them in a covered pan (sprayed with no-stick spray) for 10-15 minutes. They were very good. (But, do look up "Pork Chops and Applesauce". One does not need to make the applesauce.)

with a little bit of a change to the orginal recipe, I used potato bread instead of rye. After browning the chops & bread cubes, I baked the chops as directed. Thereafter I added 1 can of chicken broth and covered the pan... reducing the oven temperature to 350 for an hour. The chops were fork tender and the rest spoke for itself.. it was tasty!

I cook for my boyfriend all the time, and he said this was his favorite dish out of all the ones I have made! I was suprised because it is so simple and easy. I loved it as well Definetely a keeper. Also -- I brined the chops first. I do it with all pork or chicken that I make and everyone comments how moist everything I make is.

This was really good for my family. What made it especially good was that we hadn't eaten since yesterday morning, since we had to go to the hospital, and the cafeteria was for nurses and doctors only. Everything is fine now, for most of us, anyway. Hospitals are boring if all they show on TV is SpongeSquare Bobpants. Can you believe it? Fourteen and a half friggin' hours of the same garbage. Pork chops are good even on Tuesday.

This was just okay. We halved the recipe but otherwise made it exactly as written. It was easy, and certainly better than plain fried pork chops (mustard and pork is a natural combo, after all), but not as good as we had hoped. Oh, well.

Delicious! Easy to make. Substituted center-cut, boneless chops and multigrain bread. Cooking time in recipe was sufficient--chops were juicy but not undercooked.

Delicious and very simple. I used whole grain bread and served with a corn/squash/cumin side. The oven phase should be increased to about 15 minutes unless you like rare pork - otherwise great recipe.

I only had plain store-bought bread crumbs, and I'm not a mustard fan so I substituted thick creamy "gourmet" Blue Cheese dressing for the mustard. I expected less than perfect results. Thankfully I was disappointed.

This recipe was quick, easy and DELICIOUS. But it certainly took a little longer than 5-7 minutes to bake the chops.

Very moist. Great flavor. I used pork loin and butterflied the thick slices. So following the cooking directions exactly as stated worked out. My daughter who does not even like pork thought it was very good. I'd make it again in a heartbeat.

Great recipe and super easy to make. I subbed in rosemary for sage and added a little thyme as well and it was just great. I served this with a potato leek soup and a nice spinach salad - everyone loved it!

Nice touch with the mustard for a variation on pork chops. Served it with roasted root vegetables and it was a good winter menu.

Rating: 2
I found it a little bland. There could have been a couple culprits, though, so I am willing to try again. First, my oven does not get hot enough. Second, I thought the chops were too thick for this recipe--they are too thick to absorb the flavors in such a short cooking time. Finally, I used rosemary instead if sage, so that may have had something to do with it.

Rating: 3
The sage with the breadcrumbs is what's good about it. Yummy. I had to cook it longer, probably about twice as long as the recipe said. Used Portuguese white bread for the crumbs because that's what I had. Even my husband, who doesn't like mustard, liked it!

When there are so many delicious ways to prepare pork chops, why bother with this one? There is absolutely nothing special about it.

Rating: 3
Nice dish. I added some mushrooms to the breadcrumbs and used brown mustard instead of Dijon (to cater to local tastes), and it worked well. I did find that the pork needed more cooking time. I needed about 15 minutes in the oven. After only 7 minutes the pork was still cool inside. With 15 minutes, the meat was done and still a little pink and moist.

As usual, I didn't have all the ingredients, but improvised with french bread, little rosemary, little tarragon. It came out delicious, excellent idea, and my 3 and 6 year olds loved it--along with my husband.

In reply to the cook from Switzerland: You are correct in your evaluation IF AND ONLY IF you make this dish in Europe, for the following reasons - A) european pork is far more marbled and fatty than the present-day american pork. B) assuming you live at a higher elevation, being from Switzerland, than the "average elevation" cook, your cooking times are longer than at lower altitudes. I would lenghten the cooking times by about 50% to achieve the same doneness. Other than that, it's a simple, quick and tasty recipe.

Excellent, easy, fast "weeknight" meal. We are low-carbing, so used pork rinds instead of rye bread. The only thing missing was the rye flavor. We found the specified cooking times just about right. The meat was still moist, but no hint of pink in the center.

Cooking time was just right. These are 1" chops after all, be sure to check them. Family isn't fond of mustard, I used just the bread crumbs patted firmly in place, was terrific.

i think this recipe sounds fantastic, cooking time sounds right but i think it would be 4 min each side....i wouldn't cook it longer unless you enjoy dry pork....just temp it, that's all.

Haven't tried it...the cooking times can't be right....pork takes far longer to cook!!!
