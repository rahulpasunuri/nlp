Wonderful, rich appetizer. Followed the recipe almost exactly except that after blanching, I cut the endive in half lengthwise and placed two halves in separate tiny baking dishes which made for a lovely presentation. You'll want a nice grilled or roasted meat or seafood dish to follow this since it is very rich. We also enjoy grilled endive as the previous person mentions. Julia Child "The Way to Cook" presents a simpler endive dish that is more suitable as a side dish. But this was spectacular with a good champagne on New Year's Eve.

This made a superb appetizer and was a huge hit with my guests. I cut the endive length wise, brushed with olive oil and grilled on the barbq until just softened and caramelized (did not blanch first). Laid the endive on an oven proof tray, cut side up, and spooned just enough of the cheese sauce to cover the top and melt between the leaves. Sprinkled with the breadcrumbs and popped under the broiler just until the breadcrumbs were toasted and the cheese sauce bubbly. Besides a beautiful presentation it was easy to pick up and eat it with your fingers if you want. I will definitely make this again!

A simple, classic recipe for cooking endive includes only butter(and/or olive oil), tablespoon of lemon juice, julienned pancetta or prosciutto, and slow cooking, tightly covered, either on stove top (using a poelan)or in a very moderate oven, turning the the heads (whole small, or halved large)perhaps once. At the end, a splash of cream to perfect the sauce. This recipe has been used in France and Italy for decades and can't be beat. Why add flour and all the rest to a recipe which brings out the best in the endive?
