Given all the wonderful ingredients in the dressing, I expected to love this recipe. But I really didn't care for it. The dressing was thick and the mayonnaise dominated the other subtle flavors. The expensive ingredients didn't justify the so-so result.

Adequate. I served this with crab and cold veggies over lettuce. The dressing was best with green beans, but it overpowered the delicate crab.

Absolutely worth the effort. Very tasty dressing but ooooh la la what a salad. It is our Easter ritual now.

So very easy & sooooo good. I also use Costco crab. I like to add avacado slice & a piece of crisp bacon curl as garnish. will make this often

Great recipe! Pickled beet slices and whole black olives are also tradional garnishes for Crab Louis. The Louis salad is also great using shrimp instead of Dungeness crab. Fresh crab or shrimp should be used, not canned. Nothing compares to fresh Dungeness crab straight out of Bodega Bay (or San Francisco Bay).

This dressing is very good. Instead of making Crab Louie, I served it over a plain romain salad and got raves. I also doubled the recipe to use up more chives, parsley, sundried tomatoes, etc. It keeps well; just add more milk to thin it as desired.

I hate to go against the grain, but I wasn't crazy about this salad. I thought the dressing tasted a little strange with the mix of mayo, tomato paste, and the hot sauce. My husband seemed to like it though.

Great summertime recipe. The dressing is fabulous and easy to prepare. I also used low fat mayo. I used a 1# can of crab meat from Costco - it is the best, better than fresh. This is definitely a recipe for 6.
