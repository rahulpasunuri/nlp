Looked festive and was delicious. Like others, I had trouble with the custard, and it didn't seem to make enough. However, with lots of whipped cream and toasted almonds on top, there wasn't any left at the end of the party! My favorite Bon Appetit trifle, though, was the White Chocolate Tiramisu Trifle with Spiced Pears, from 2007.

My oven runs true but whoa - 16 minutes was too long! I should have taken the cake pans out when I switched them at about 8 minutes. Anyway, I just trimmed the edges by about an inch, and the cakes still rolled up beautifully. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, and have nothing to add to the other reviewers' comments except that my crowd also loved it. And I loved the presentation in my beautiful glass bowl. The recipe serves 8 with seconds.

A lot of work but WORTH IT! I couldn't find sherry syrup so i used a raspberry one and then just sprinkled some sherry over the whole thing before topping with the whipped cream. Fabulous. Impressed the pants off of everyone with this one...

I've had a trifle dish for years that I've never used and finally put it to use with this recipe. My church choir demolished it in all of about 15 minutes and still wanted more. One person said, "There's a surprise in every bite!" I concur. I had no trouble with the custard recipe. Maybe it's gas burners and patience that make the difference? It strained and set up perfectly and the flavor brought back wonderful childhood memories of my mother's custard. Never able to leave well enough alone where any recipe is concerned, I made a couple of changes. I found a gorgeous tart cherry and white peach filling that I used for the jelly rolls. I just couldn't find a plain tart cherry preserve that I thought was special enough and this one was a hit. The other change I made was the sherried cream. I've never been a big fan of sherry and since this dish was destined for church I flavored the cream with confectioner's sugar and almond and vanilla extracts. I also whipped it up a bit stiffer since it wasn't going to be eaten immediately. Make an extra batch or two of the pralined almonds. I made them a couple days ahead and they didn't last through the first day. Easy and impressively delicious. My trifle chilled for over 24 hours and the mix of flavors was out of this world! I will most definitely reprise this recipe for future occasions.

This ended up being the star of a gourmet, six course Christmas dinner. The flavor combination was stunning and the presentation was nice for a trifle. I'm not a novice with custards but I did have a bit of trouble with this one being a tad on the thin side. However, it was nothing a little cornstarch and milk couldn't fix. If you struggled with this I'd suggest checking the size of your pans. If they are too large the cake won't come out the proper thickness. Hide the sugared almonds if you make them ahead of time. It was all I could do to keep my family from eating them all before the trifle was chilled.

Theoretically, this trifle is a good idea, and it is impressive looking, but taste-wise, it's really rather mediocre. Would I make it again? Only with different recipes for all of its components, except perhaps the praline almonds, and with a number of variations, some of which I used to fix this basically flawed recipe.

My sister-in-law has made this spectacular dessert for two Christmas Eves now and it is by far the most outstanding dessert I've ever been served at someone's home! Personally I've never wanted to make or serve a trifle because it only looks appetizing until just before it's served. Then it looks like a big mess both in the trifle dish and in your own bowl. This dish is so beautiful in the bowl and so scrumptious with the jelly roll, custard, sherried cream, and candied almond components that it doesn't matter how it looks! We ALL indulged after our rib roast Christmas Eve dinner and happily finished it off for "dessert" after breakfast on Christmas morning. I resisted this dish for a year and am now looking for the perfect trifle bowl so that I can serve this some day soon.

I like to do a showy dessert every Christmas. This is by far the easiest impressive dessert I've made! Some things weren't perfect - the custard was too thick to strain and the sponge cake was a little overcooked - but this recipe is FORGIVING. Any mistakes can be hidden inside the trifle and only the impressive jellyrolls need to be pressed against the sides of the bowl. Delicious, relatively easy, will definitely make again. One more hint - use lots of sherry syrup, this was everyone's favorite part!

Sorry, Cook from SF, I have no idea what might be wrong with your custard; this was the first custard I've made and it worked just fine. You might have turned the heat up too high--you have to be patient with medium low heat, and just keep stirring. I made it on the 23rd, served on the 24th, it was excellent and a HUGE hit with my parents, siblings, spouse, etc. The sherry flavor is, in my opinion, quite pronounced, but that is to be expected. I did add a bit of vanilla to the final whipped cream. Next time I believe I will add more preserves in layer between custard and spongecake.

I am in the middle of the recipe, and I have low expectations. The custard is super soupy! I even made it twice, the first time I was sure it needed to thinken more so I cooked it till it curdled, then I did it again and am hoping it will tighten up with chilling, cross your fingers for me!

Writing again--now I see the problem, the syrup & custard recipes are in the magazine but you have search for them separately on the website. Usually the website gives links--bummer. So just recipe search "sherry syrup" and "vanilla custard" on this website and select the recipes dating from December 2008. Best of wishes.

To the previous two cooks: this confused me too...keep reading the main recipe; after that it gives you the recipes for the sherry syrup and the custard. In the magazine it directs you to page 56, and there they are. Haven't tried it yet, but I'll start tomorrow for Christmas Eve. Good luck--looking forward to reading your reviews!

I read this recipe several times and cannot figure out where you are suppose to come up w/the syrup and the custard. Am I missing something here? Hope someone can help me out w/this because i would like to make this recipe.

Looks interesting, but what is 'sherry syrup'? Is this a prepared product? As with any component I'd rather make it than buy it, but I don't see directions in the recipe.

I haven't tried this yet, but it sounds like a spectacular, but simple to make, presentation. Just one suggestion based on my experience in making jelly-roll-type cakes: remove the cakes from the parchment paper while they are still hot, put them each on a clean dish cloth, and roll them up, starting with the short end. Let them cool wrapped in the dish cloth. This way, they will hold their shape better, and be less inclined to break when you roll them.

As a novice trifle creator, I may not be qualified to write the first review of this recipe but... I loved it and so did the guests at the party I brought it to. The almond paste added a great flavor to the cake and the sherry flavor was subtle, not overpowering. Also took less time to make than I thought it would given the length of the directions. I found the picture on page 29 of the December 08 Gourmet more helpful than the one above this recipe. It showed how to arrange the cake rounds to get the impressive visual presentation that a good trifle bowl will give you. I wish epicurious.com would make a direct link to the Sherry Syrup and Vanilla custard recipe. Just one less step.

A beautiful table centerpiece in itself! Loved the candied almonds on top. The rolls weren't as large or full as I would have wnated, but that was maybe because I used a larger plan; and I definitely should've been more generous with the Sherry syrup...
