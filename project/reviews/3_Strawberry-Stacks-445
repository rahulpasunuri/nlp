Have to say I wasn't totally impressed. The cookies were very good! I guess it took the preparation for me to realize the filling was basically strawberries and whipped cream. So, I turned that into a mousse. I couldn't get it to look very pretty either. Eating the cookie with a spoon was a challange.

I enjoyed this. I made if for Christmas and it was easy and yummy. The cookies were very nice. I liked the orange flavor and using the orange juice was very clever. Made for a nice ending to Christmas dinner. Aloha from Maui.
