I used slightly larger quantities of spice than listed, as otherwise it was somewhat unassertive. This is a good recipe to make if one is already fussing in the kitchen, as otherwise the hour it takes to cook and stir these might feel a bit wasted. Still, they are very tasty, fragrant, and fairly nutritious for a "candy". Would be great as a party snack.

These were good, not sicky sweet, but very labor intensive...outcome not worth this much effort.

This is an easy recipe with excellent results. I made them for our family and they did not last a half an hour on the plate.
