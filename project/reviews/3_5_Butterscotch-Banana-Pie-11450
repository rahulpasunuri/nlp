This pie is delicious. To the person who said it was no better than commercial Jello pudding: No made-from-a-box (or came-from-a-box) dessert from Jello ever tasted as good as a pudding made at home, from scratch, by someone who has the least bit of ability as a cook. One of my first cooking efforts was making pudding from scratch, with a recipe from a box of cornstarch. That pudding was no where near as good as the one for this pie, yet it easily surpassed Jello pudding. I am not sure why your filling did not taste good; perhaps you don't like butterscotch?

This is a unique dessert and I have been making it to rave reviews for years.

I made the butterscotch pudding that this pie called for and it was wonderful. What was even more wonderful, though, was the butterscotch itself, before it was mixed in with the pastry cream. I want to make that again to serve over ice cream. Delicious!!

This pie requires quite a bit of prep time, but the end product is WONDERFUL. My husband prefers a graham cracker crust, and I also grate chocolate on the top. We had never had "real" butterscotch pudding before this.

What I really meant Worcester and NYC is that the end result was not worth all the effort. I have quite a bit of experience in the kitchen and am not prone to taking shortcuts on recipes. Jello is the last thing I would ever choose to serve company...if ever. The point was that this pie is as tasty as Jello...so why not just serve Jello...or really, why not try a better recipe!

Oh, Worcester, you are too funny!

I agree with Florida. Why waste your time when you can make JELLO instead? Like I've always said, why bother with making a Filet Mignon when there's something out there that's probably just as good... it's called MCDONALD'S. Or, why bother making a birthday cake from scratch when there's something simpler out there that's just as good.... it's called DUNCAN HINES CAKE MIX.

Try this recipe! Butterscotch is my husbands favorite pie and when I make this, he thought it was the best dessert he had ever tried. I was so so on butterscotch but this recipe turned me around. I used best quality single malt scotch (Glenfiddich) and didn't bother forcing it through a fine sieve.

Absolutely fabulous -- and I don't usually like banana desserts. This pie is time-consuming, but well-worth it. Very, very, very yummy. My husband, who does like banana desserts, said it was the best banana pie he had ever eaten by far.
