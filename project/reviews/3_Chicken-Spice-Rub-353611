Very tasty. Used about 1 teaspoon fresh rosemary from the garden, as I didn't have any dried. I was a little worried the fennel would overpower everything else, but the toasting mellows it. I would add a little more green pepper, or a few white or black peppercorns. Drizzled a little olive oil on leg quarters, rubbed with spices including under skin. Let sit 30 minutes and grilled. Very good.
