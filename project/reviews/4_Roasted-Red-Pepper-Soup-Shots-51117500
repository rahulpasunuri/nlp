This was a hit. I used slightly less olive oil as it was overpowering the flavor of the peppers.

For the parmesan crisps I like to make them in a small crepe pan since usually I do only a few at a time rather than heating up the oven and it is a cold soup. Also great in salads or with salad on side. Anyone try this soup hot?

also known as a 'frico' if you are searching for recipes. bake some grated parm on parchment and it's crispy like a cracker!
