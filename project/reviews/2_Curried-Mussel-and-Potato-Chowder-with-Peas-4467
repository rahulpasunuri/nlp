The recipe itself is simple but still rather labor intensive. Unfortunately the soup was surprisingly starchy and unsatisfying. It might be better made with real cream, but this one goes in the won't make again file.

My husband and I really liked this chowder and I found it easy to put together. His words: "Sort of exotic but hearty." One suggestion is to use a stick blender vs. food processor. Made the whole experience quicker and cleaner. Husband took it for lunch the next day and came home asking when I'll be making it again.

the leftovers are still in the fridge, 4 days later. i just haven't been tempted to go back for more. it's a pretty labor- and cleanup-intensive recipe for an unremarkable product. i will probably use the base of this (pureed potatoes) for another "cream" soup but i'll definitely use yukon golds next time. the russets were dry and starchy-tasting.
