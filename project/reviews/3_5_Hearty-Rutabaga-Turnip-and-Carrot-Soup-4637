My family loved this recipe. I used my wand blender and pureed part of it and left a little chunky...right in the pot I cooked it...no need to actually seperate. Topped off with a little creme fraiche ... SOUPer! :) Accompanied by Crusty whole grain bread.... our rainy night was warm and healthy!

This is a great way to use up those winter CSA veggies all in one fell swoop. I found it to be very bland and when I looked back at the date (1998) that explained it. Today a soup like this would have a fusion of Moroccan or Indian spices to it and in fact, I added a teaspoon of home made Southeast Asian inspired yellow curry an it did wonders for the layers of flavor and enhanced the nuttiness of the root veggies. I would also add more garlic next time. .

Because I love sweet potatoes, I took one of the reviewer's suggestions and used sweet potatoes instead of russet potatoes. I also added a few leaves of fresh chopped sage while the soup was simmering. When it came time to blend, I added a dash of cinnamon and cumin as well as a few grinds of pepper. The recipe might not need these additions - but the result was certainly delicious!

I made this soup with 2xrutabaga and no turnip, I also left out the tomatoes. My mom used to mash carrots and rutabaga together, this is sort of a soup version of that, I really liked it, thanks for the recipe.

I really didn't enjoy this soup, which is rare for my experience with Epicurious. Too sweet and not much else.

Not having leeks on hand, I used yellow onion, plus substituted 14 oz. tomato sauce for the tomatoes and sweet potatoes for the russets. I added a bit of oregano, cumin and freshly grated nutmeg, and simmered all for 45 minutes. Using my immersion blender, I blended lightly, preferring a rustic soup...then thinned with milk rather than the broth. A dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of chopped cilantro completed the colorful and flavorful concoction. With these changes, I think all agreed this was exceptional!

I have been making this soup for years, and love it's versatility. I have made it with vegetable broth for my vegetarian family members and with chicken broth and find that there's no discernable difference. I like the idea another reviewer had about substituting sweet potato for the russets. I'll try that next time.

Decided to try this for a nice Halloween dinner after reading about the turnip stew in this Russian Fairy Tale: http://bit.ly/1F6ZuT

The soup was yummy enough, but I simmered the veggies longer than called for and they were still pretty crunchy. I'd recommend simmering on med-low for at least an hour.

I also used a bit of mint and substituted the white potatoes for sweet potatoes. However, I used 2 cups of fresh beefsteak tomatoes. They were not overwhelming at all, just right.

I really love this recipe for fall. It makes a nice hearty soup to take for lunch or serve for dinner. I don't always use leek, I sometimes use onion instead for convenience. I also always spice it up a bit with red pepper, mint, oreagano, nutmeg and cumin.

This was really good. Very healthful. I did add a bit of creme fraiche and a lot of salt and pepper to round out the taste.

I have made 5 different types of soup from this site and this is by far the best one yet. I followed the recipe to the letter...when I got to the part to put 4 cups of it in a blender, I wondered if I was supposed to blend it all or just some...well I did the 4 cups only and returned it to the pot with the chunky ingredients and stirred it. The taste was fantastic, the tomatoes made it like a tomato soup but you can taste the carrots also. I added some black pepper and bought crusty wheat french bread, but thought it might be better with sweet cornbread too. I would make this again.

This is a great simple recipe. I used vegetable stock instead of chicken and reduced it by one cup. I didn't have leeks, so I used scallions. I did not puree, instead I used my potato masher to break up the chunks a little bit. The result was a nice hearty presentation. Great for the cold weather we've been having!

Followed the suggestion of a couple of cooks and substituted sweet potato for the white potato. Gave a beautiful color and more flavor. Also, only pureed two cups instead of four. Think that was a good call as I could see the 'baby food' comparison had I pureed more. very tasty.

This dish was good, but nothing to rave over. The vegetables blended nicely together. Different styles can be made with this soup, so be creative and go all out.

I took the great suggestion and used only one 15 oz can tomatoes. I used sweet potatoes instead of white because they are better for 0-blood types. Loved this so much I made it again. Did not have a can of tomatoes so I used an 8 oz.tomato sauce and it worked just as great. Both times I didn't have 4 cans of broth so I used 1 can and the rest in water and a bouillon. Add more or less water to your preference. I also used a hand-held immersion blender rather than transferring back and forth to a processor. No mess, less clean up. This soup is very filling - make a salad and call it dinner

I made this soup to use up a bunjch of turnips from my organic produce box, and am so happy I did! I added 1/2 lb. browned ground turkey, a teaspoon of time, and a few handfulls of chopped escarole (also from the box) at the very end. I didn't puree any of it. My husband added harissa at the table. Delicious! Will definitely make again.

I'm glad I followed other reviewers' suggestions. I used on 14.5 oz can of tomatoes and I only pureed about 1.5 cups of the cooked soup. Yum.

My family really liked this soup. As I like thick soup, I only used two cans of chicken broth. It was a little tomatoey, next time I might just use one can of tomatos

I added about 1/2 cup of parsnips, because they were in the fridge. I also used a quart of Pacific Line Veggie Broth, and only 1 can of tomatoes. Everyone who tasted it, love it. I didn't have any leeks, so I used Mexican Onions, because that's what I had on hand.

I used the same principle as for the rutabaga, carrot, parsnip soup in this category. I browned some cajun sausage and used the drippings to saute the onions and veggies. I added the sausage to the soup. Actually, I did not mind this soup. My guests politely ate it but it did not rate raves and I like the other better. That's the big reason for not making it again. There are too many others I either like better or want to try.

A wonderful way to get your vegies -- especially those cancer-fighting ones. I will use a few more carrots next time, or a sweet potato, because it was a touch on the sour side. I garnish it with grated Romano, and since I had plenty of left-overs, I added aniseed to some.

Next time I would only puree 3 cups max, or maybe not at all. What's wrong with looking at all the little chunks of multicolored vegetables? Otherwise, you end up with what looks like orangy-red baby food. I added 2 cans of veg. broth to start, and 1 can of chicken broth at the end. Another can would have thinned the soup too much. The flavor of this soup definitely improves with time. The day I made it, the tomato flavor was just too strong---and I love tomatoes!

The thing I loved about this recipe was that I could sneek in alot of root vegetables that are great for one's diet, yet no one has to really know what is in it! I told everyone it was a winter root vegetable soup, they had no idea what that included so they just ate it in relish and then I told then about all of the vegetables that were in it that they would never necesarily consider eating! It made a great first course to an elegant meal!
