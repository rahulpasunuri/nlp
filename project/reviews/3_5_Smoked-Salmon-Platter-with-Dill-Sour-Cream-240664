I didn't care for this at all. But I think half of the problem was the Salmon. It didn't look like the picture. I guess I don't know much about smoked salmon. I see now it called for sliced smoked salmon. What I had and used was like a steak that flaked. I didn't like the texture at all and thought the whole thing was kind of boring.

This was yummy. I prepared it a few hours ahead of time so the flavors had a chance to meld. I felt the quantity of condiments worked better with a 4 ounce package of salmon than with a pound. I used 8 ounces of salmon and doubled the condiments. There was nothing left at the end of the evening.

Can't wait to try this recipe. The son & I had a very similar appetizer at Shuckers, Seattle's iconic seafood restaurant, recently and it was wonderful. In addition to the shallots and capers, they also served grated hard boiled egg yolk and egg white on the side. Absolutely delicious! Be sure to get high quality, smoked salmon, freshly sliced.
