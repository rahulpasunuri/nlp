The flavor was really good and very easy and quick to make. They were on the grill a little too long and were charred a little. Very simple tasty side.

Made dinner for 20 for Christmas, so instead of grilling the potatoes after parboiling, I roasted them, uncovered, at 400F. I used fresh, chopped rosemary; granulated garlic; sea salt; pepper;, and the lemon juice in the yellow plastic lemon. They were delicious! There was no compromise in flavor from using dried garlic and presqueezed lemon juice, but I believe using fresh rosemary rather than dried kicked it over the top.

Very simple to make. Very good flavor. Don't boil for more than the 10 minutes or some of the potatoes will break apart when tossing in the Oil/Herbs.

I thought it would be great to have a mixture of potatoes and parsnips since we love roasted parsnips. What a colossal disaster! The potatoes were perfect and delicious but I obviously WAY undercooked the parsnips. Will stick with the recipe as is in future as the potatoes were so good.

Great flavor and texture. A fantastic way to change up the potatoes on your plate

Wow are these good! We love the crispiness of the grilled skin with the softness of the potato. A great texture combination.

Very easy and delicious. Cut the potatoes lengthwise so they were bigger and wouldn't fall through the grill. Used parsley, dill and chives.

Easy, tasty and different. We loved it.

This recipe did not work well for me. Potatoes seems oily, without the nice crispness/ fluffiness/ flavor I was looking for.

These were a very tasty and easy addition to our father's day dinner. I will definitely make again! Don't forget the lemon at the end, I had doubts at first, but it really was a great finish!

A keeper! This will go in my repertoire of permanent recipes. We used a charcoal grill and the potatoes got done super-fast - so if you go that route, be prepared to get them off in a hurry.

A very delicious recipe with lots of flavour. This one I´m going to make again for sure.

This recipe also works well on a grill pan (instead of a barbeque grill).

Great recipe. Grilled them in a Weber stainless veggie rack with the slits in it and they came out nice and crispy on the outside. Herb mix is good and you can spice it up with some cayenne if you prefer.

This is a keeper! I made it just as written using parsley and thyme that I had on hand. So simple and it was just perfect for an end of summer barbecue. Great flavors - the lemon juice adds the perfect flavor.

These are the best potatoes ever! Easy, no fail,tasty, pretty, delish. Vary the herbs to suit the mood. The squeeze of lemon juice right before serving is brilliant

These taters are exceptionally good! The first time I made these, I followed the directions as written. 4th of July picnic friends ate 'em up. This time I'm going to use the oil from a newly opened bottle of Newmans' Family Recipe salad dressing, just to use the excess oil that never seems to mix with the oil/herb mix. . )

Loved this recipe. Was a bit hard to keep them from falling through the grill, but aside from that the recipe was outstanding.

So easy and delicious. I parboiled the potatoes about two hours before grilling and let them sit in the oil-herb mixture. We have some leftovers and I am looking forward to warming them up tomorrow morning and serving them with eggs.

I make this often. It's pretty much no fail because once they are done they can be moved to a cooler spot on the grill until needed. This time I used fresh thyme and rosemary but it is so versatile in the herb department. Moist on the inside and crunchy with grill marks on the outside. So appealing!

Awesome. I overboiled potatoes, and it still worked, but some fell apart when tossed in with herbs. I also used red potatoes but would recommend a larger potato so they don't fall through grates on grill.

great way to grill potatoes in less time, and much more flavorful

This is great! I used purple potatoes and fingerlings (from my daughter's father-in-law's yard). I used an extra garlic clove (we luv garlic) and squeezed most of one lemon. Very good.

I made these last night with just plain old russet potatoes. So very good. Crisped up just like they were supposed to. Served them with grilled lamb chops and grilled eggplant.

These potatoes were a big hit at my most recent hosted dinner. Accompanied them with some Blackened Grouper and Pancetta Wrapped Asparagus. Fantastic, simple recipe with plenty of room to throw in your own little flare. Thanks!

This is an easy recipe with lots of flavor. A nice change to the usual roasted potato especially for summer where all the cooking is done on the grill.

I used fingerling potatoes (just cut them in half lengthwise) and they were to die for! The genius is in putting them back in the marinade after they cook. Amazing.

I tried this for a community picnic last weekend. Even though I wasn't too far back in line for food there was none left by the time I filled my plate despite doubling the recipe. People began asking who made the potatoes so I had to fess up. Several said the lemon was a great touch; and many asked for the recipe. Definitely will make again so that I can try them this time!

Very easy and delicious! I kept the skins on the potatoes, which added flavor and kept the potatoes from falling apart on the grill.

Very pleasant way to make potatoes. Grilled them on the stove with a grill pan and worked very well. Don't skip the lemon - livens it up nicely.

I had planned to do this on the outside grill, but it was raining, so I used my Cuisinart Griddler. It worked very well. I forgot the lemon, but it was very good without it. The herb oil is great! I made the Grilled Ribeyes with Indian- Spiced mushrooms and served with sliced tomatoes from the local Farmers market and it was a real hit with the family!

Made this with the cedar-planked salmon in the same issue. It was a nice pairing and the potatoes were very tasty. I didn't really think they needed the lemon juice, since they had lots of great grill flavor.

Good variation on potatoes. Solid recipe, but not sure the grilling adds much flavor. My slices never browned on grill. Make sure not to cook potatoes through on stove-top, because they'll be too soft to marinate and flip on grill. I did like the herb dressing and would consider tossing with cooked potatoes.
