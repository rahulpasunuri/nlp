funny, this is the way i've been making green beans for years and how my grandmother made them, but i never realized it was a "recipe." i usually cook covered over low heat for about 4 hours. i've never had to add salt, as the hamhock adds plenty of salty yumminess.

Simple and delicious. Similar to my southern grandmother's way of cooking green beans. I have also used bacon for flavoring. Be sure to add salt and pepper to taste. The longer you cook this the more flavorable. I bake southern style cornbread to serve with this dish
