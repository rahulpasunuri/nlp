The only thing that kept this from a four star rating was the difficulty in assembling. I think a large part of my problem was my ingredients. Even after towel drying the cucumber and using the saranwrap and chill method, the cream cheese still would not adhere. The fact that my salmon would not exactly stay in sheets (though it was the sliced kind) certainly didn't help either. Not sure if I'll try it again like this, but I would definitely do it in another format (sliced cukes with a dollop of cheese and a piece of salmon on top)

sorry, I didn't quite describe the procedure right in previous post. You apply the salmon-cheese to the cuke using the saran wrap. try to do it pretty tightly. you twist the ends and refrigerate for a while. Take it out and gently remove the saran; the salmon will stay on the cuke. then slice with a really sharp knife with a thin blade. You can also leave the saran on when you slice, but I think this is not as good. there.

great recipe. The technique is NOT HARD. The trick is to use the saran wrap to apply the salmon to the cucumber. If you're using your fingers, you might be having fun but there's an easier way. Wrap salmon around cucumber and gently pull saran away. twist the ends and refrigerate. Then slice.

I thought these were a great appetizer - good flavor and presentation. I made the cream cheese mixture the night before to save time. I also used a double layer of paper towels to wring the moisture out of the horseradish - made the spread very sticky and adhered nicely. Will absolutely make these again for cocktail parties.

I've made this recipe about four times, always to rave reviews. Even from those who claim to dislike smoked salmon. I almost always double the horseradish, because I love it. Also, first timers, the first time you make this will be totally frustrating. It will feel like a mess. But don't worry, no matter how it looks it always tastes delicious, and it only gets easier!

I think this is such a beautiful presentation. I recommend using Wasabi powder instead of the jar horseradish that way the cheese mixture isn't watery and it sticks better to the cucumber. Spread the cheese mixture on the fish first then wrap it over the cucumber. The trick to getting nice clean cuts, is wrapping the entire thing with seran wrap and then slice it, that way everything stays in tack. Works beautifully everytime.

Looks impressive but so easy..not to mention that it tastes so good. It's got that sushi-thing going on and I've used these as part of an Asian inspired buffet.

My teenage daughter loves this recipe, as it is easy for her to make, and it serves as a good after-school snack or a light lunch for her. We use regular cukes that we seed out. The first time we made this, it was a little tricky, but after that, we gave up the idea of photo-shoot perfection, and it actually went a lot better. Since then, it has become a staple in this house, where we eat lots of sushi. Sometimes my daughter doesn't even bother with the horseradish and chives -- just smears the cream cheese on the salmon, wraps it around the cuke and voila! P.S. -- Kirkland brand smoked salmon from Costco is a very economical means to make a large quantity of this recipe.

Great recipe! I used a high quality Scottish Smoked Salmon and a strong horseradish since I liked some zing. I used a plastic wrap coated bamboo sushi roller to roll the salmon/cream cheese mixture onto the cucumber like you would a sushi roll. I think the key to the presentaon is not to spread the cream cheese mixture very close to the ends of the salmon so it doesnt leak out onto the outer portion of the salmon and use a very sharp Santoku knife to cut it into pieces. It turned out great!

I've never been a smoked salmon fan, but made this for family. It got rave reviews and is already being requested for future parties - and I was surprised at how much I ended up loving them! Definitely messy to make - I think the size/shape of the salmon pieces makes a huge difference in the ease of rolling (bigger the better). You have to dry off the cucumbers - very important. Also, I would really suggest letting the cream cheese mixture sit overnight to develop the flavor. Finally, we ate these for 2 nights and the second night they were WAY better, but the cucs were a bit watery. I'm going to experiment with spreading the cream cheese mixture onto the salmon, layering with wax paper, and letting sit overnight, then rolling the cucs the next day. The salmon really does taste better the longer it has to soak up that flavor.

Relatively easy, needs the salt and pepper and knowing how to lay out the salmon is a bit tricky, but great results and showy presentation.

I had high hopes for this appy - I soaked the quartered cucumber in salt water ahead of time to draw the moisture out and even dehydrated them in convection oven before the prep, but after wrapping with the salmon pieces and cutting them in bite sizes, the presentation was just not acceptable. I ended up buying pre-made apps.

Great appy! Everyone loved it - the rich salmon flavour, the cool cucumber and cream cheese. The horseradish I used was quite mild, and would use one with a bit more strength next time, but not too strong. Not that hard to cut, but don't make it too early before serving, as the cucumber can get watery. Great presentation - I look forward to serving it again!

I made it precisely as the recipe calls for and it didn't seem like much trouble to me (as someone else thought). I agree with the comment about the difficulty slicing (with a normal knife). A ceramic knife worked great though.

This was excellent. I coated the rolls with toasted Sesame seeds for texture and flavor. I loved the spice of the horseradish but if you put too much it makes the cheese lose its stickiness and the rolls become difficult to form.

The flavors were GREAT, not hard to make, but were time-intensive, compared to your average appetizer. I quit after only 1/4 lb of salmon and half of the cucumber. But, they were the first appetizer that disappeared at my party! If you have plenty of time, these are worth a try...

Chopped, fresh dill would have been a welcome addition. A bit messy to slice. Maybe my knife wasn't sharp enough?

Rating: 3
Simple and fast and elegant. Went well with sushi. Perhaps add more dill and lemon zest - omit salt. Although they look nice, I have a hard time getting them rolled tight and perfectly triangular like in the photo! Directions say to make them only 1 hr before serving - I made them several hours before and they turn out the same as preparing them immediately before serving.

I made these for Thanksgiving, and they were gobbled up. :-) Just a word to the wise: make sure you dry off the cukes before assembling, like it says. I forgot, and the cream cheese didn't adhere as well as it could have, but they were still excellent.

Great! Extremely easy and very tasty!

Made this for Thanksgiving. Was a big hit. Delicious and easy to make.

Very tasty and delicious! Easy to make and quite elegant looking. I served them on a bed of chives on a silver platter. Good to know that you can make them the night before!

These are really very good. Easy to prepare and they look nice plated. I did add a dollop of black caviar to each roll. I think that it added a nice flavor and color contrast. Although the reciped stated that the rolls could be made 1 hour in advance, I missed that line and made them the night before my party. They were just fine. I'm guessing that the cream cheese mixture needs the extra time to develop the flavors.
