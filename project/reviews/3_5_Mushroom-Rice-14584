A simple and good. Maybe even qualifies as a "comfort food". This will become a staple.

Just made this. I love Mark Bittman's "simpler than pilaf" baked rice recipe w/ mushrooms & white wine - very similar to this. However, cooking mushrooms separately on stovetop makes it a completely different, & equally delicious, pot-o-rice. White wine & evaporation gives it just enough tartness.

This is a fabulous recipe. I too used basmati rice with oyster and shiitake mushrooms. I didn't have scallions so I diced a yellow onion very fine and caramelized them with the mushrooms. I added parsley at the end for the green. I will make this again and again.

Delicious! I used white button and shiitake mushrooms. Fresh dill and paprika livened up this easy and tasty side dish. I've already made this recipe twice and it has been a hit both times. Definitely will make it again!

I thought this dish was delicious. I prepared the dish using oyster, shitake, & portabello mushrooms. I also used basmati rice. I made it for me and my husband and we both loved it. It was real simple and would definately make this again.

I loved this. I used shitake, crimini and button mushrooms, shallots (didn't have scallions) and basmati rice. I added a little extra salt and it was so flavorful. I am always looking for alternatives to plain old boring rice and have a keeper with this one. Even my husband loved it and he is not a huge mushroom fan. Thanks!

Good, but definitely needs the salt. I ended up adding soy sauce too, trying to boost the flavor. I used half plain mushrooms, half shiitake, but if I make this again, I will use a mixture of strong-flavored flavored mushrooms only. I think that's the reason the other reviewers liked this rice so much. I am thinking that changing to a more flavorful, aromatic rice would help too.

I used half crimini and half shitake mushrooms. It was easy and wonderful even though I forgot the scallions until after dinner. I added the rice to the mushrooms in the pan - I don't know if it made a difference.

This rice was spectacular. I made it with fresh oyster, chantrelle and small portabellow mushrooms. It paired well with the chilean sea bass with morels in parchment. I'll be making this again very soon.

Surprisingly good, considering how simple it is. I used basmati rice (the amount of liquid might have to be adjusted) and portobello mushrooms.
