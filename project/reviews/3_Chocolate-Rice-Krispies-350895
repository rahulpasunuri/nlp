I made these as the final treat during a six-course meal and they went over spectacularly. I served them between naval oranges in Chianti and coffee/tea and they were the perfect end to the meal - not too sweet, but enough like dessert to satiate all. I put out 40 of them for six people and by the time my guests departed they'd all been eaten. I'd definitely make them again - and plan to try them with candied cherry centres (and possibly crushed candy canes) for a holiday party this year. I think both versions would work nicely.

A Cook, there is another version of this made with Copha (you guys may know it as shorting see wiki - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copha ) instead of butter and gelatine. Try this link for a vegetarian alternative, http://www.kelloggs.com.au/tabid/152/Default.aspx I know most commercial marshmallow is now made with a gelatine substitute, though you still should check the ingredients on the back of the packaging.

Does anyone know how to make home-made rice krispies? I have to stick to a gluten-free diet and would like to make them at home.... Email me: sirrix AT gmail DOT com.

I like this combination of cocoa, rice cereal, and the mini chocolate chips. A nice twist on the usual. Like the suggestion to dust with cocoa powder too.

I was disappointed with this recipe-chocolate and Rice Crispy Treats don't make a very good combination in my book. Next time I will save myself the extra trouble and (a few) extra calories by leaving the chocolate out.

I can't believe you put this under the "Healty" catagory :(

This recipe is most certainly not vegetarian. It has gelatin in it (marshmallows) which is basically animal cartilage from boiling joints. o.O No vegetarian I know eats them.

If rice krispie treats have always been one of your favorites,then you won't be dissapointed in this recipe. At first I was not sure the marshmellows were "melted"enough.They were more like a doughy blob in the pan.I held my breath and threw in the krispies and chips.I mixed and stirred frantically to have it all turn out well.I used smart balance instead of butter,maybe that had something to do with it. I'm taking it to a belated Thanksgiving dinner.It will be a nice variation next to all the other desserts

For the ultimate rice crispie treat you need to sprinkle with cocoa powder and cinnamon after forming balls.
