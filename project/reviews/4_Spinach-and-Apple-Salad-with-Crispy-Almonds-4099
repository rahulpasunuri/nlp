LOVE this salad! I wouldn't change a thing! I made this for Thanksgiving (it received rave reviews) and it's now a part of the regular rotation. Enjoy!

This is a great salad. I have used this dressing as my basic dressing on other salads. Delicious.

this salad is AMAZING!! I made it for friends last night and they loved it. Unfortunately I didn`t have white vinegar so I used a little balsamic vinegar instead and I cut back on the oil as suggested. the Almonds were delicious, definitely add lots of almonds!!

As my boyfriend said, "This was such a great way to make us eat fruits and vegetables!" I made the dressing beforehand and just tossed enough salad for two although I practically put all the almonds in our salads - they're so delicious. I'm looking forward to using up the dressing this week and eating more vegetables!

I made the dressing, which wound up tasting like pure oil. I had to add a lot more apple cider vinegar as well as Dijon mustard to salvage the dressing.

Warning: If you love almonds and sugar, make twice the almond topping so you can shove handfuls of it in your mouth as a snack and still have enough to top the salads with. The other, healthier part of the salad is good, too.

Yummy and easy to make. Served it with a simple omelet for a quick and easy lunch.

This salad got rave reviews. I did use shallots instead of onions. The almonds are yummy. This is now my family's second favorite salad! We only get McIntosh apples for about a month each year, it's a treat to have them in this salad.

A very good spinach salad recipe. Use just 1/2 the oil, and just enough dressing to coat the spinach leaves.

Rating: 4
Great salad! I also cut the oil in half. I added some blue cheese crumbles with the intention of cutting up the sweetness of the salad a bit. I liked the addition of the cheese, although the blue cheese taste was rather strong. Next time I would use a milder cheese. Definitely will make this again!

Delicious salad! I have served this both for dinner parties at home and catered events (I'm a caterer), and I always get rave reviews. I make this exactly as the recipe states and don't find the salad to be oily. Just add the vinaigrette gradually until your salad is dressed to your liking. Save the rest for another salad. I also usually double or triple the almonds when I make them in order to have leftovers. They are a great snack or salad topping.

Rating: 3
Definitely quick and easy. I was looking for something different with apples and spinach and this hit the spot for sure!

Rating: 4
This was very easy and very delicious. Even my kids liked it. I used Fuji apples, shallot, toasted sesame seeds, 1/4 cup oil, crumbled chevre goat cheese and pomegranite seeds. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. With the one further exception that I accidentally added 3 tbsp of sugar to the dressing which made it a tad too sweet for my taste but it was still good. I look forward to leftovers and to my next try when I will only add the correct 2 tbsp sugar to the dressing!

Rating: 4
You MUST cut down on the oil in this dressing or you will hide the flavors and have a very greasy bowl of greens. Otherwise absolutely fabulous. Substitution of coarsely chopped raw almonds works fine as do shallots for the onion.

Rating: 4
I have made this twice for two different events and it has gotten the best reviews of any salad I've ever made. People love it! Last night they couldn't stop talking about it. I cut the oil in half too and that seems to be plenty. I also toast the sesame seeds, and have added dried cranberries and crumbled goat cheese.

Rating: 4
This is a new favorite - the dressing is delicious with crisp apples (I used Galas) and the almonds are a perfect complement. Do put the cooling almonds on parchment paper, and try your best to keep out of them before serving!

Rating: 4
Definitely a keeper. Excellent salad to showcase apples in season - only use best crisp ones. One tip: put almonds on parchment after cooking. Helps absorb grease and helps with clumping. I added dried cherries too and it was fabulous

I was looking for something a little different for thanksgiving day and this fit the bill. Most of my guests really enjoyed it.

Rating: 4
deceptively simple but brilliant. the almonds really takes the cake. made for a dinner party and everyone loved it. make sure you use crisp apples and the oil should not be reduced below 1/4 cup or the dressing will taste too sour and sharp.

Rating: 2
We cut the olive oil in 1/2 as suggested by other reviewers, and it still seemed a little much. I did make up the dressing in the food processor, as I don't like chunks of raw onion, and it made it really easy to whisk in the olive oil. It was an okay spinach salad, if you're looking for a "sweet" salad, but we've had others that are better.

Rating: 4
excellent. didn't have spinach--used red romaine. used vidalia onion and toasted my sesame seeds. no blanched almonds, so I used unsalted skin on chopped coarsely--less butter--absolutely yummy. husband wants it again and again.

Rating: 3
The compliments abound! Definitely reduce the oil in the dressing - no more than 1/4 C needed. Also for the almonds, I quickly rinsed them w/ water and then tossed w/ 1 1/2 T of brown sugar and toasted in my toaster oven till golden. Delicious and no butter needed!

Rating: 3
We've made this recipe many times over the year in my family, and it's very good and popular at potlucks. I also reduce the butter with the almonds. I leave out the sesame seed; I love sesame, but I don't find that it adds anything to this dish. I also think it makes about twice as much dressing as you need for the amount of spinach specified.

Rating: 3
Was the salad for Thanksgiving this year, everyone liked it, easy to do ahead except for apples, which I sliced into salad right before serving and tossed with the dresssing and almonds. Will be made regularly.

Rating: 4
The whole family loved this salad. I made it exactly as written. The only tip I have is to stir the nuts up every couple of minutes until they have cooled completely to stop them from sticking together as the coating hardens.

Rating: 3
This salad is delicious -- a wonderful combination of contrasting flavors, textures, and colors. The only change I would make the next time around is to use fewer apple slices (probably by about half) and also about half the butter to cook the almonds -- the almonds were a bit greasy. Otherwise, this salad is terrific.

A delicious, elegant salad!

For just the two of us, I made one quarter of the recipe. It was the perfect amount. Did cut the oil by 25% and sugar by a bit and toasted the sesame seeds. Usually I don't like food that is on the sweet side but this is good !

Excellent salad. Great mix of flavours. Perfect for fall with fresh cortland apples. Very easy way to make sugared nuts.

Rating: 3
This was very good. I couldn not taste the sesame seeds at all so I'm tempted to leave them out next time. Also, after cooking the almonds and putting them in a bowl to cool, they turned into one solid mass of almonds. I had to put them in a ziploc bag and smash them in order to put them on the salad.

This is a wonderful salad. I made it exactly as directed...toss with enough dressing to coat...don't use it all. I now have a great recipe to serve to our friends, the gourmet cooks! My husband and I halve the recipe and use it as our main entree.....oh yes, double the almonds....yum! Thank you!!

Really delicious. Makes a little more dressing than we needed. We will definitely make this again. We thought there was a nice Oriental flavor to the salad with the sweet and sour flavors and the almonds. Might try adding croutons using a recipe similar to the Herbed Garlic and Parmesean Croutons, substituting Chinese spices and a corn oil/sesame oil mixture for the Italian spices and olive oil.

We will make this regularly in the future. We liked the almonds, but watch them closely when cooking them. They can quickly burn. I made the recipe once with regular spinach, and once with baby spinach. We like the baby spinach better.

Rating: 4
Delicious! Dressing was both tart and sweet, and the sesame seeds (which I toasted) added a nutty crunch. Subbed carmelized walnuts (epicurious recipe) for the almonds and tart granny smith apple for the red-skinned apple. Planning to serve as part of Christmas buffet.

Excellent salad. I made it based on the reviews and took it to a party hoping it was as good as it sounded. Every bit of it was gone and people were asking for more. I did cut down on the amount of oil.

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet-it's one of my family's favorites! Every time I've made this for groups I get many requests for the recipe. I recently tried sliced almonds with sugar only-no butter. Just stir over medium heat until the sugar melts, but watch that you don't burn it, then put the almonds onto waxed paper to cool. An excellent salad!

This has become my signature salad. Cut down the amount of dressing for the salad. You can make it without the almonds as well. I hope you find it as amazing as my family and friends did.

I made this salad on an evening I had friends over for dinner and everyone loved it! It reminded them of a speciality salad you get in fine restaurants. I didn't bother with the sesame seeds and used pecan pieces instead of almonds. You will definately need to cut down the oil--at least in half!

Great Salad, the dressing is excellent and I used red onions, and Braeburn apples.

This is the best salad I have ever made! My husband devours it every time! Used red onion, no sesame seeds, and cut down on the olive oil. The buttery sugared almonds are nice, but for sake of time and calories I usually just use plain toasted almonds. You will not be disappointed!

Oh Yea...this one's good! We used toasted sesame seeds and let them sit in the dressing for a bit. Delish. Also used equal amounts of oil and vinegar and a Tablespoon less sugar. Thanks everyone for your input.

Excellent salad and I am sure it would take well to variations. I used Gala apples and as suggested, reduced the oil slightly. I do agree with the comment about the sesame seeds being superfluous, perhaps if they were toasted they would ad more to the finished dish.

Wow, this was outstanding. I made it for a dinner party this past week and it was a huge hit. I used only about 3 tbs of oil and didn't miss it at all. I will make this again and again.

Surprisingly delightful and light though filling. I made it as a main course for two and its gone. I might adjust the dressing a bit next time by adding a touch of lemon and a slight reduction of olive oil. This is truly a salad to savor and remember.

This was a yummy salad that I think would go over excellently at barbecues and dinner parties. I used sliced almonds and red wine vinegar, since that's what I had on hand, and reduced the olive oil to 2T. I also added gorgonzola cheese and substituted Bosc pears for the apples, and I found the resulting flavors and textures melded beautifully. Next time I'll try increasing the paprika a bit. I haven't figured out what the sesame seeds are for, though-- they don't seem to add much in the way of flavor or texture.

This salad was very bland. Followed the recipe to the letter. Not sure what went wrong... I don't think the almonds were enough to ground the vinegars and apples. Crumbled cheese would help but the dressing needs some flavor!

Rating: 3
Good, especially the dressing. A great salad for parties because it probably would have broad appeal. Next time, I want to try the Moscow Idaho cook's suggestions, especially the crumbled blue cheese. BTW, I omitted almost all the olive oil and didn't miss it. Also, I used sweet onion because that's what I had on hand.

I have made this sald many times to rave reviews. I also use red leaf lettuce and Royal Rivera pears with this dressing.And always use crumbled blue cheese. I've used browned pecans-I use one tble spoon white sugar mixed with a generous pinch of cayenne pepper and when that's melted add one tble of brown sugar. The pecans need to be watched very carefully then not to burn. I've also substituted pomegranate seeds for the nuts, which is very tasty and colorful. It's the dressing that makes this salad so I'm happy it makes extra.

There are many good salad recipes out there, but this one is great! My husband is usually unenthused when I try new salads, and he even commented how much he liked this. The dressing is what makes it really stand out, although you can easily halve the ingredients and still have more than enough. You can also cook the sugar and almonds at the same time, omitting the butter. Next time, I will add celery and/or green onions, or even craisins! We will definitely be making this one again!

Delicious, easy and a great do-ahead salad. I substituted shallots for the onions, used nice sweet, crunchy Braeburn apples, and made lots of extra almonds, which was a good thing because they are indeed scrumptious! I recommend dressing the salad with one-half to two-thirds of the vinaigrette and then tasting it. I had lots of extra vinaigrette.

This is one of the most tastiest salads ever! I took the advice of another cook and added the bleu cheese....ah, delicious!! We paired it with the curried potatoe leek soup. I would definitely make this for any party! The almonds were a sweet treat for everyone!

This is a great combo of flavors, I used sherry wine vinegar because I was out of white wine, the almonds are a great touch. I would decrease the amount of olive oil by about a tablespoon next time. I served this with meatloaf, parmesan peppercorn mashed potatoes with tomato gravy and rolls. Everyone loved it.

Fabulous!! Will make this again and again. It is so tasty I could have just eaten the salad and skipped the rest of the meal. All my guests loved it too. I think with fall or winter entertaining this would be terrific.
