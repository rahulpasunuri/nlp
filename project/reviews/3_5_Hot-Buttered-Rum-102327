I microwaved the apple cider with the spices, lemon peel, and honey. It is super easy and delicious.

If you're looking for a crisper tasting, alchoholly flavored drink, go for it. If you want less alcohol and more desert, find another recipe.

This drink was the hit of Thanksgiving in the mountains... a cup in front of the fire was just the right thing for a cold night with the family. We decided to make it a holiday tradition.

I have a bad cold and found this classic recipe. It's perfect! Like a previous reviewer I used water (didn't have cider) and added a little honey. It's warm, soothing and delicious.

I thought this recipe was mediocre.

decrease the cider and add vanilla ice cream. Makes it outstanding. My mother in law made this and it was wonderful

Definitely make it with cider. This is the best buttered rum I've ever had. Let the spices sit for a while in the rum (if you can wait that long!).

Great on a chilly October night when you are stressed and can't sleep. Added 1/2 teaspoon raw honey to add sweetness because I made the recipe with water instead of cider. It was fantastic, warm and a soothing night cap. I will definately make it again for a snowy day.

This is soo good. With a horrible sore throat and just getting over the flu this went do so smoothly and tasted amazing. I used Captain Morgan's and even my 65 year old mother and 95 year old grandmother who both don't like rum, absolutely loved it. Use the apple cider like the other person suggested. This is my new holiday and winter drink when I am in the snow in Tahoe.

Made this as a surprise for my husband as he was working on Christmas decorations. Absolutely loved it! Used 8 year old rum and cider... the perfect holiday drink!

The perfect drink to end those chilly winter dinner parties! Just as good as my Yankee Candle Hot Buttered Rum candle!

My Lord. This is liquified holiday: warmth and spices and rummy delight. Make it with the cider. It's the best hot toddy I've ever had.

This delicious holiday favorite warms you to the core. I recommend only the cider version. Made with just sugar and water it is a big let down. Made with cider, you feel like you are inside an apple pie.
