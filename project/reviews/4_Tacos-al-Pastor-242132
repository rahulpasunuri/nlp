I don't think much is gained by grilling pineapple. I made this with the little plastic cups of pineapple and it worked out well. I suppose I'd use fresh pineapple for a party - just for presentation.

Why "kosher salt"??? This is one of the dumbest thing to mention. I guess, "kosher" is the authentic ingredient whenn cooking a mexican dish, especially one including pork!!! Duh!

I love the marinade, but I have a simple twist on this recipe that I think takes it to the next level. My wife and I made this using a pork butt roast, I think around 2-3 pounds, instead of pork loin. Rather than grilling it, we prepared the meat by pan searing the roast on all sides and then tossing in a crock pot on high heat for a little over 2 hours on high heat. These were hands down the best tacos, if not best home cooked meal I've ever had. Going to make these for the mother in law next weekend!

This recipe was a big hit with company last night, but there are a few things to note: The yield is much more than stated - it would easily serve 12. My butcher sliced the pork loin on the slicer, giving me a much more uniform thickness than if I had sliced with a knife. If you don't have access to a butcher, look for thin-sliced boneless chops. After the pork went on the grill, I put the left-behind marinade on the stove to simmer and sanitize, then when the pork and pineapple were chopped, I tossed them all in the hot sauce over heat for a few more minutes. Since I had omitted the pineapple from the marinade (following other reviews), this gave the pineapple and pork an opportunity to mingle.

you can still use the pineapple (and I would recommend it) by cooking the marinade for 5 min or so at boiling. This destroys SOME, not all, of the enzymes that break down the pork. You will be happy that you did!!!

Very good recipe. I tweaked it so you can use pork loin chops for easier prep for a small group (we're just two). I also made my own version of chipotle salsa which was easier. I always have trouble finding exotic chiles in my neighborhood. Enjoy! http://www.neurotickitchen.com/2012/05/cinco-de-mayo-tacos-al-pastor-made-easy.html

Delicious! Took the advice of other reviewers and left the pineapple out of the marinade. During winter, we also make it on the stove top instead of the grill. Corn tortillas go best with the tacos, but we've also used flour tortillas (quartered) when we don't have corn on hand.

Delicious! Agree with other reviewers that it is better to drop the pineapple from the marinade. Instead I added a pinch of sugar to help replace the sweetness of the fruit. Also, good balance of acid with the sweet smokiness of chipotle is key, and since different brands can be more or less concentrated, taste / adjust the marinade! Final tip: if you're short on marinating time, slice the pork very thinly and marinate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. In the meantime, brown the pineapple in a pan and then saute the pork in the same pan. It's still yummy!

I made the recipe, switching out only the fresh pineapple with canned to avoid the mushiness that some of the reviews complained about. I marinated it overnight and had very little mushiness around the edges. The flavor was good; the grilled pineapples definitely brought it up another notch.

BTW, guajillo powder is just plain red chili powder.

Austin is the first place I have had this dish. Many restaurants in town are famous for it. I should have known when I smelled the marinade that this wouldn't work. There is absolutely no depth to the flavor, and that's exactly what pork requires...lots of flavor. This was terrible. I only took one bite.

I braised the pork in the marinade, in the oven. It was amazing, not too sweet at all. I served grilled pineapple, cilantro and fresh lime all on the side. I will be making this again. Leftovers made awsome migas for breakfast. (I didn't have guajillo powder so I added some of the dried peppers straight to the blender. Also make sure you have enough heat, it goes great with the pineapple and pork.)

Pay attention to the comments about pineapple breaking down the meat. I suggest removing the pineapple from the marinade. Otherwise the meat turns mushy due to that enzyme unique to pineapple. Fresh grilled pineapple mixed into the grilled meat is enough.

Couldn't find guajillo chile powder, so had to grind up a bunch of dried guajillos. That was the only thing that really took any time, but well worth it. Delicious!

Ohmyword, I could open a restaurant with this recipe. I stumbled across this while looking to recreate our favorite recipe from The Mission in Scottsdale (Pork Shoulder Tacos with Pineapple Glaze). While this recipe isn't the same thing, it is fantastic! I thought that the pork-to-pineapple ratio was too great, the recipe made a TON of pork, and I will add more grilled pineapple next time. I'm also going to attempt homemade tortillas next time!

OUTSTANDING! I made this recipe for my husband and some friends and it was a huge it. It was extremely easy and was packed full of flavor! Instead of the Smoky Two-Chile Salsa, I served the tacos with the Cilantro Slaw recipe. Will absolutely make this again!

I thought this was great. The onion relish really works well with the sweet pineapple. I thought the recipe called for tenderloin and didn't realize my mistake until it was too late. So I marinated 2 pork tenderloins and grilled them. The only other change I made was to use flour tortillas (personal preference). It didn't taste like al pastor I have had before but it was still delicious.

These tacos were absolutely out of this world. Juicy and succulent! I omitted the pineapple in the marinade as experience has taught me that this can be a touch and go meaning the meat can go "mushy-furry". However, I did grill the pineapple and served it alongside the pork. My husband ate till he was stuffed. He said the flavour was so amazing he couldn't stop. Well worth sourcing gaujillo chiles.

Be sure to know that chipotle peppers have a very smokey kind of smell/taste. If you don't like that, consider putting less of the peppers in or omitting them. I used pork tenderloin and let it soak for about 15 hours and it turned out tender and flavorful. The grilled pineapple added a lot to the taste - it was delicious.

These tacos were fantastic! I had no problem with the marinade. These were so good that my husband and I could not wait to have the left overs and ended up having them for breakfast the next day! Hey, our stomachs don't know what time it is! I can't wait to make them again.

Central Market sells these- and the gentleman behind the food bar was kind enough to sell me some uncooked meat & marinade to cook at home! All you have to do is ask! The pineapple and sauce is delicious! I want to try it with shredded chicken!

We cooked tacos al pastor for 20 and it worked a treat - however we adjusted it by making a chipotle adobo from scratch and then pureeing that into the marinade. We also used shoulder rather than loin, which was way more affordable (and gave us a beautiful bone which made stock for the black beans which accompanied). We served with a lot of accompaniments but tomatillo salsa and sour cream was the popular choice. For the adobo: we simmered 15 chipotles with 4 garlic cloves, a quartered onion, 6 tsp ketchup (really!), 1/2 c apple cider vinegar, and 3 c water. Simmered for an hour (till reduced by more than half) and then pureed that into the pineapple, raw onion, etc.

used pureed chipotle and ancho insted of the guajillo - and marinated only 2 hours. so the time may not be a concern if applicable. Delicious!

So easy! I had to make some changes, but the pork came out perfectly. I had to use canned pineapple because the fresh pineapple I had turned out to be bad, & I used regular chili powder instead of guajillo chili powder. Also, tasted marinade before adding pork and it seemed to need just a little sweetness, so I added 1/4 c pineapple juice. Perfect. Grilling wasn't an option where I live, so broiled pork 7 min total (turning once) & it still turned out well! I am sure that this recipe will be out of this world when I follow the recipe more exactly.

I used the marinade for some boneless chicken thighs and drumsticks that I had. Instead of grilling, I cooked them on a hot cast iron skillet. It was delicious. I only had ground pasilla chile, but it worked out fine. My husband and I love traditional al pastor, and this is a great homemade version.

These tacos are YUMMY! Served them with borracho beans and my family loved them! I couldn't find guajillo chile powder so I substituted powdered New Mexico Chile and it worked great (if you are going to substitute, make sure you use a powdered chile vs. "chile powder",which adds salt, cumin, etc. to the powdered chile). Anyway this was very tasty and very authentic. Perfect for company b/c you can make it ahead and refrigerate or even freeze the pork in the marinade & thaw it the day of. Re: the "mushy pork"--I only hade time to marinate mine 3 hours and did sense a slight mushy- ness. I'll leave the pineapple out of the marinade next time since the grilled pineapple adds plenty of flavor. A KEEPER!

I made this for my Mexican Christmas Eve Fiesta and it was great. I tweaked it by not using the Pineapple in the marinade (I was scared off by the other comments) and then cooking the pork in a CrockPot for 2 days. It was delicious and everybody was obsessed with it.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I marinated the pork for 4 hours and it came out fine - not mushy at all. I cooked the slices quickly over a hot fire and they were crispy on the edges and yet stayed moist. I did grill some onions along with the pineapple and that was wonderful. Don't skip the lime to squeeze on the tacos - it really made the dish. I even added some lime juice to a salsa cruda that I made instead of the suggested salsa. Excellent!

I can't believe others have not complained about "mushy" meat. I've always believed it was ridiculous to marinate any meat with pineapple, as it contains bromelain which seriously breaks down the fibers in the meat. Learned the hard way in Mexico when tried marinating a very tough chicken with pineapple and other ingredients...the chicken literally turned to paste after a 4-hr. marinate. I would recommend grilling the pineapple and serving with the tacos.

It was most likely the pineapple. It has an enzyme in it that breaks down the meat.

I marinated these overnight, and the pork was very mushy when cooked. Is this the result of a bad loin, or an over-long marination in pineapple? I would be very grateful for feedback from someone who knows.

tacos al pastor go great with peanut salsa. Fry some peanuts and dry chillies, put in a blender with salt, pepper, water and garlic and then fry again until done!

well it was good, and the flavors were great BUT i thought the choice of meat, the loin, was a bit off. i thought it was sort of dry -- though MAYBE we overcooked a bit. we thought we should/could do with a fattier piece next time.

This was a fantastic dish - we used a dollop of sour cream and my "Don't put fruit with my meat!" husband absolutely loved it. Very easy.

I loved this recipe! I did not grill though, I chopped the pork first (used loin), then cooked it in a well-seasoned cast iron pan over high gas heat until it was almost crispy. I also used freshly rendered lard, which is what would be used in Mexico. You can find Guajillo chile powder online or at your local Mexican "bodega".

Jeff didn't like the idea of pineapple. We just returned from Puerto Vallarta and the BEST tacos al pastor were at a small place called Takos Panchos. Each pork taco included a small slice of pineapple.

I made this the other night for two grilfriends and everyone agreed this is one of the tastiest dishes any of us have had in a long time. The balance of the sweet/savory/spicy is divine and the overall flavor is light and delicious. I too (as another reviewer said) used chipotle and ancho chili as a substitue and thought it worked perfectly. I will definitely be making this again! Whoever said pineapple isn't needed is nuts. The grilled fruit make this dish. Definitely a keeper!!

This was a good and very easy make- ahead recipe. I couldn't find the "right" chili powder, so used a combo of chipotle and ancho powders. Worked fine. The fresh grilled pineapple really makes this dish stand out. I thought the smoky salsa was not very good on its own, but worked well with these tacos. Would not make the salsa otherwise because kind of bitter. My family raved about these tacos, and told me to make sure I save the recipe.
