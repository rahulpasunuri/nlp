We've made this time and time again love it. ALWAYS USE PASTE, not powder wasabi. I also use almost double the wasabi that it calls for and lessen the butter. Wonderful!!

I thought the wasabi with the butter tasted bitter, maybe i didn't add enough wasabi. I didn't like it. I used a homemade teriyaki sauce which made the Tuna taste very good, but we through out the wasabi butter.

Wonderful and SO simple. I did use the wasabi paste, not powder.

I had never cooked tuna steaks before so unfortunately I overcooked it but still liked the dish. I used wasabi paste and more than was called for because we like the flavor. Will definitely try it again.

We enjoyed this recipe. I took the previous reviewers advice and used extra prepared wasabi in the butter. Next time I will cut the tuna in bite sized pieces and grill it on kebabs then toss it in a small amount of the butter. It would be great for cocktail hour especially paired with a sake martini.

Loved this recipie. I read the reviews and used a little less butter and mixed the wasabi powder and served it on top of the tuna. Would definitley make this again.

Good recipe, but like a few other reviewers, I should have read the reviews (or trusted my instincts) first. The wasabi butter was blah to awful. A paste added to the butter would probably have been better. Wasabi powder just doen't have much flavor until it has been mixed into a paste and allowed to rest for a few minutes. I should have known better.

Unfortunately I didn't read reviewers' suggestions before making this dish. It was good, but next time I'll definitely try wasabi paste instead of powder.... as well as put the butter on rice. Both great ideas.

I love grilled tuna and I love wasabi -- but for some reason, the wasabi BUTTER just rubbed me the wrong way. I guess it just seemed wrong to slather butter on a beautiful piece of tuna. I liked the flavor of the wasabi -- but maybe next time just wasabi paste mixed in with the teriyaki marinade? ON a side note, the wasabi butter was yummy mixed in with the rice on the side!!

Okay. Recipe I like, but re: reviewer from Detention; your references to violence against children and others is macabre. Solitary confinement is best.

This recipe was awesome! I would definitely make it again. I used wasabi from the tube, instead of the powder so you can make it to taste. It came out great!

This recipe is so easy, quick and delicious! I did the wasabi powder with the butter and it worked out great. Add more powder if you want it stronger. This prep is a milder version of wasabi and had a creamier flavor/texture than typical wasabi. Definitely buy quality fresh tuna and sear, do not cook through.

This is an excellent dish...the wasabi butter is perfect!! Next time I prepare this dish I will sear the tuna instead of cooking through. I served this dish with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed soy beans just last week and is planning to make it again real soon.

Delicious and EASY! Did I say it was easy?... I made it with Sushi grade tuna just seared on the outside for a dinner party and it was a hit. Needed more wasabi on the side for the hardcores. Served asian noodles on the side room temp so the only cooking that took place was five minutes on the grill. No time away from your company! Everyone ate with chop sticks and had a blast. Definately mix the wasabi with water per the directions on the container. Epicurious should change that line to Wasabi paste.

The wasabi butter is horrible if made as written. The wasabi powder isn't able to rehydrate if added to butter alone, so it ends up tasting like stinky sawdust...disgusting. If you hydrate the wasabi powder with WATER FIRST!, let stand for several minutes, and then mix into butter, its fabulous. Once I figured that out, the recipe was good and simple. I've made it several times since

I'd definitely make it again. After reading some of the reviews I almost didn't try it. But it turned out to be a great recipe. (I made a reduced portion for two, just halving the ingredients as listed, and it was excellent.) I guess it depends on your taste for wasabi. If you're not sure how much to use, try doubling the amount of butter and chives initially, leaving room to taste and add. You can always discard the excess. It's a small quantity.

I had a jar of wasabi powder that I've never opened and decided to try this recipe using fresh swordfish steaks. I thought it was the most discusting thing I've eaten in a long time. Ditto for my husband. Took a few bites and 86'd the rest. Before I get slaughtered by wasabi lovers, I'm sure there is nothing wrong with the recipe -- I guess we just don't like the flavor of wasabi. I like horseradish, but wouldn't like it mixed with butter and melted over fish. I did mix the wasabi with a tablespoon of saki as suggested. Oh well, differences of opinion (and taste) are what make the world go 'round, right? Bon Appetit!

I am not sure anyone has ever done this, but I have not made this YET. I plan to when it is warm enough to grill. However, I am commenting to the person from Detention (who should be put IN detention). Next time you think of trying something new, KNOW what the ingredients are. Obviously, you don't like wasabi.

This was excellent! My husband and I were both skeptical about the wasabi butter, but it turned out great--a wonderful complement to the tuna, and each of us could vary the amount we added. Used a Foreman grill--about 2 minutes total since it sears from both sides. Just plain sticky rice and soy on the side. Definitely a keeper, and so easy! (We used Paul Prudhomme's San Fran teriyaki marinade--good match since we didn't want anything too sweet.)

I love rare tuna and I love wasabi. But this just didn't get it for me. I think it's the butter. gack!

This was my first attempt at tuna on the grill. We thought it turned out great. I used Kikoman Roasted Garlic Teriyaki for extra flavor and marinated in the fridge for an hour. I follwed the reviewer's suggestion about grilling extra 30 seconds with wasabi butter on grill and we loved it. I was overly cautious about the wasabi (I made a paste from the powder) about it being too hot. Next time, I would like the wasabi butter to have a little more kick, but now I know what I need to do.

This was really good. I'd only use a tuna filet about 1/2-3/4" though. I still like it rare, but hot in the middle too! I used Yoshida's marinade - totally good, and wasabi paste in the tube (prepared) - totally HOT. This is hotter than the powder by FAR. So if you use the tube kind, expect it to be hotter. I used about 1 Tbsp. to 2 Tbsp. butter. I also cooked mine in a cast iron pan over gas range. It's too cold here to BBQ now. Paired it with California Rolls sushi (I'll rate that too).

My husband absolutely adores this dish and insists I prepare it every week now. I have always used about 2 tsp Wasabi paste rather than powder, as that is all I could find in my Japanese market. I would have given it a 3-1/2 rating if that was an available choice.

I rarely make the same dish more than once a month, this has become a weekly must have. yum. My wasabi powder is very srong, so i would watch out the first time you make this, and thanks for the tip on adding a little water to wasabi. It works out great.

I had to read the recipe and the reviews again!! This was awful. The tuna was fine but the wasabi butter tasted just like butter with wasabi. It lacked something. We had to add soy and wasabi paste to wake the meal up.

This is in response to the lady that wanted a rating on the seaweed salad a person ate with this recipe. I am not the person...However, I was also curious so I did some checking. There is a recipe on this site for seaweed salad using "wakame" seaweed and it is not yet rated. Then there are two that use "nori" seaweed (dryed seaweed that is used for sushi rolls) and they are highly rated. They are "California Roll" Salad and Sushi Roll Rice Salad. Hope that helps. And, I'll let you know what I think of this recipe as soon as I try it...I can't wait!

We grill most of our meals outside year-round, so I had to try this one. It was delicious and so easy to prepare -- definitely a keeper. We served it with sticky rice and lightly steamed snow pea pods.

Rating: 4
Too easy not to make! Even the kids loved it (but without the wasabi butter). I followed earlier recommendations to dilute the wasabi before mixing so it blended more easily into the butter. I served with an Asian cucumber salad, grilled pineapple slices, and poached snap peas. Snap peas didn't add anything to the meal.

I am not a fish eater, but this sounded so good I had to try it. It was absolutely delicious! My husband loved the wasabi butter, but it was a little too spicy for me, so I might kick it "down a notch" next time. Served it with sticky rice. Great meal!

I buttered the tuna steaks with a little of the wasabi mixture on both sides and grilled another 30 seconds or so. It really brought out the flavor of both, tuna and wasabi butter.

A friend who is a marvellous cook made this for me. He served with a seaweed salad, sushi rice, pickled ginger and of course the wasabi mayonnaise...(hot). Very enjoyable.

Wasabi powder needs to be prepared before adding to butter. Just add some water to make into thick paste. Longer let it expose to the air, hotter it'll be.

Rating: 0
Just a little tip re: wasabi powder: its flavor doesn't bloom well when mixed directly with fats/butter. For much fuller flavor, mix wasabi powder with very small amount of sake (or water or whatever) to very thick paste, let sit for a few minutes then mix with the butter.

This is a quick and easy tasty dinner - for extra kick mix a little more wasabi in the salted butter.

This is a great recipe for everyday. Not interesting enough for a party, though I'd serve it for a spur of the moment get-together with friends. The wasabi butter is good on Salmon too.
