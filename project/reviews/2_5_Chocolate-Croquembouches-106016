Filling was delicious, as was the glaze - but the dough for pastry was a disaster. Followed the recipe exactly, and they came out like pancakes. So, I made a regular cream puff dough, and enjoyed 'not so chocolate' croquembouches. Probably won't make again.

I have a recipe for profiteroles that is foolproof and i have used it for years. Melt stick of butter in a cup of water and bring to the boil.When boilin rapidly take off stove. Add in a cup of regular flour and mix by hand until you can shape into a ball. Cool for about 10 minutes. Add 4 eggs and mix again. Takes a while, but will eventually turn into dough. Put teaspoons onto greased sheet and bake for 30 minutes in 400 oven. Dont need anything more to make it rise. And there's no need to be rude.

Despite the harrowing reviews, I put forth the courage and attempted this amazing recipe for a class picnic. It was the hit of the day!!! Not only did it look great on the plate in its little pyramids, but it tasted amazing as well!!! The hardest part is getting it to stay in a pyramid shape. The only recommendations i have is to follow the directions to a T and it will turn out great!

As noted by the other reviewers, the cream puffs did not puff, they were just lumps of dough. Disappointed.

The problem with this recipe is that the batter is made with cocoa powder. Yes, the flour is there to make the batter puff up but when it's mixed in with the cocoa powder it just doesn't work. If you really want to make this recipe, try omiting the cocoa powder and adding a bit more flour, but not too much.

I should have read the reviews before I attempted this disaster. The filling was wonderful as was the glaze, but the cream puffs did not turn out. Referred back to Julia and the Joy of Cooking and both recommended pate a choux, which as mentioned by another critic, should be a thick paste. This was not the case with this recipe. Don't waste your time with this recipe for the cream puff.

What a disaster! I was a little worried as I read other reviews. If you attempt to make this recipe here are some suggestions- don't add flour to the batter even though it is very runny. Make sure you mound it up high on baking sheets and bake the times it says. I ended up just cutting each puff in half and piping chocolate between the two sides- don't do the poke a hole thing.

I don't know whether this particular recipe works as intended (having never tried it), but what this guy is describing sounds like pate a choux, which is a partly cooked *batter* (NOT a dough) that produces pastries leavened by steam. It's supposed to be a thick batter, one that pulls into v-shaped sheets from the beaters. It's going to be impossible to handle with your hands (unless they're coated with teflon), so you must use a pastry bag (or ziploc bag with a corner cut off) to properly dispense the stuff -- note that he left that detail off. If you add flour to the mix to handle it with your hands, you will be in trouble, because the dough is too heavy to be leavened by steam alone!

Follow the directions and the picture. My problem was that I didn't follow the picture when decorating it. Instead of poking holes, you should cut the puffs in half to put in the cream. Otherwise, it's pretty good!

I tried to halve this recipe and the filling came out beautifully but the cream puffs were a disaster. I kept adding flour, both to the saucepan and after the eggs until I could shape it, then baked them. They were so hard and nasty I threw them out and added cocoa to Julia Child's recipe and they came out wonderful. I thought it was just that I messed up the technique, but the consensus seems to be that the cream puff recipe is off somehow. I also made larger puffs and just dipped the tops in chocolate instead of stacking them up.

Also found both the dough & the cream to be too wet. Too messy for me too work with, my husband persisted with choc covered hands & they got rave reviews. Next time I will add more flour to the dough & cook the cream a little longer.

The dough is a liquid mess once the eggs are added. I had to throw away the first batch. For the second batch, I doubled the amount of flour in the dough, and it worked out much better. I would make the recipe again, but only with twice the flour this recipe calls for.

I agree with another cook - the dough is impossible when you add the eggs

I made this for a Christmas open house party and assembled the puffs into a pyramid. It looked wonderful and tasted very chocolatey. I found the recipe made a lot of extra pastry cream which was absolutely delicious! So be prepared to have another use for the cream- or serve it alongside the puffs as well as inside of them. I didn't have any problems with the puff ingedients not incorporating- they turned out great. Overall, a very good recipe if you love lots of chocolate.

I am a Pastry Chef. The problem with the recipe is that there is not enough flour in the pate choux also use a bavarian pastry cream as the filler or a mousse it is more stable.

The cream puff recipe was a liquid mess. I remade the puffs using a traditional recipe adding the cocoa powder and sugar. The pastry cream, however, was delicious. I thought that 8 stacked on individual plates was too large a serving, so I stacked them up on a footed cake plate, and it was very impressive.

When I added the eggs to the cream puff dough, the dough liquefied and was ruined.
