I've had these on the little Sister Shubert yeast rolls - great heavy appetizer or brunch item! Also good with heirloom tomatoes and a splash of balsamic vinegrette

This is a good sandwich. I made it last night and loved it, but I'd like to experiment with it. Another reviewer mentions buffalo mozzarella...that sounds interesting, but also, I think next time I wouldn't bread the tomatoes... simply grill them or quickly fry them but without the breading. Also, some ranch dressing/mayo might be interesting. Great for a quick mid-week meal.

Really amazing and a huge hit! I made the sandwiches open-face and used buffalo motz. A truly amazing variation from the blt. I will make these again and again.

This is a fabulous sandwich! I like to make it for my "Southern" family but especially love to make it for all my Northern in-laws....they love the fried green tomatoes.

My husband and I love fried green tomatoes and really enjoyed this sandwich! I didn't have fresh basil leaves so I used pesto. Also I put the sandwich, without the top slice of bread, under the broiler to melt the cheese. For variety I plan to try substituting other types of meat, such as ham, for the bacon and other kinds of cheese.

Very easy to make; the basil adds lots of flavor. Definitely a switch from the old boring sandwich routine.

Very creative sandwich, much more interesting than an ordinary BLT.

What an elegant flair to an otherwise rather common sandwich. I prefer mine like this every time!

I have loved fried green tomatoes all my life. But never thought to make them into a sandwich. Great idea
