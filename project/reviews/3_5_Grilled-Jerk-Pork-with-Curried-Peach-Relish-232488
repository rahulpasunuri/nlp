Loved it. The curried peach relish was the best part--unusual flavors to combine, but it was delicious! Don't be afraid to try it!

The pork was really tasty, but there are plenty of other marinades I like better. The relish was just OK, I would not repeat the recipe without modifications. I didn't bother to blanch and peel the fruit, and without those steps it was really quite easy to make, and the skins didn't bother me. It was too sweet, and not assertive enough. I liked it a lot better right after I made it. The next day, when I served it, it really seemed to lose something. I like the suggestion of a mango and jalepeno salsa.

de-lish! the marinade smells awful, but as soon as its on the grill, everything changes and the result is fantastic. I would make half the relish, though. i had way too much left over, and it was a bit of a waste.

I really can't believe how good this was. I made it for me, my partner and a guest, and my partner and our guest could not stop eating it. I loved both the pork and the relish. I must admit that I was very very suspicious of the marinade, which looked pathetic and smelled even worse. Honestly, I was tempted to throw it out. I used some dried thyme in addition to fresh, I also used a whole jalapeno. I cooked the pork to 135 and that was the perfect temperature--it's so easy to overcook tenderloin if you go by the generic 'pork' temperature reading on the thermometer. The parts that tasted best were the portions with a dark brown/blacked crust, so the next time I cook this, I will cook it at a very high heat initially to get it uniformly browned and crispy on the outside and then reduce the temperature until it's cooked throughout. I must confess that I was making the relish/chutney late at night and kind of screwed it up by combining all the ingredients in a bowl before realizing that it needed to be cooked down, but it was still delicious. The flavors of the peach recede to the background and really just extend the flavor of the tomato, curry, and the ginger. I'd also recommend making half the chutney that the recipe calls for.

I made the pork last night without the relish. I didn't think the marinade was that special but I did two substitutions: - instead of scallions I used dried chives - I didn't have molasses so used maple syrup. I will probably try this again with the proper ingredients just to give it a shot.

Great recipe. I thought tomato and peach sounded odd together as well, it was really delicious. I will keep this recipe and make it again and again.

I made this dish for a Carribean themed baby shower after a recommendation from a friend. The pork was delicious, easy to make for a large crowd and very well received. I thought that the relish was a little too much work for what it was and it didn't get as many compliments the pork. We served it with black beans and rice and fresh pineapple slices. Next time I would omit the relish and maybe make a simpler one with pineapple or maybe mango/jalapeno.

This was really really good. The salsa was a bit labor intesive (blanching and peeling the tomatoes and peaches) but totally worth it. Tomatoes and peaches sounded weird to me, but it was great. I served it with grilled asparagus and coconut lime basmati rice. Will definitely make again!

We had a bounty of tree ripened peaches, home grown tomatoes and onions so I made this relish. It was delicious! I admit I used Walkers Woods Jerk Seasoning on the pork tenderloin. You can't go wrong with Walker's Woods. It's really hot!! Love it. The marriage of the relish and the jerk was wonderful. Will defintely make again.

Made this for a gourmet dinner party last week with a Jamaican theme, and everyone really seemed to enjoy it. It wasn't that spicy-hot. The marinade was a really awful green color, and I couldn't believe it would be good, but I made it in good faith based on the reviews it received. (Didn't turn out green!) I did grill the pork, and it was so good, I'll be making it on a regular basis (but kicking up the heat a little). I had a lot of the chutney left over - that didn't go over as well.

This was a great meal served with basmati and steamed green beans. The relish wasn't as hot as I expected (or wanted). It also seemed to be missing something - I'm not sure what though. We'll have to play with it next time to push the heat. This will definitely make a repeat appearance this summer.

This was quite simply amazing. I didn't read all the way through and so I didn't realize I had to make the relish the night before (but I did marinate the pork overnight). Even without the relish (I ended up buying store bought), this was a great, super easy recipe that I will make again and again. Was a great hit with the inlaws.

This was a great dish. I used canned peaches because I had no fresh ones and I didn't puree the relish but left it chunky. The marinade flavored the pork perfectly. This would be a wonderful dish to serve guests as so much of the work is done ahead.

This was very nice, and much easier than the long ingredient list would lead you to believe. I halved the recipe, which didn't work for blending the marinade--there was not enough to reach the blades--so would not recommend halving the marinade quantities. It made a beautiful presentation.

okay, so I have used tons of recipes from this site, and never have I been more suprised. This got great rating, so I made it for some very descriminating guest and it was a huge hit! I am not a huge fan of curries, but this was delicious. The jerk recipe was a little weak , I mixed it a few things of my own, but the curry will be added to my permanent collection.

This was a superb dish...love the versatility of pork tenderloin and the relish really made it. Don't be put off by the combination of peaches and tomatoes...it absolutely works. I had some relish left over and served it the next night along with grilled swordfish...YUM. My only suggestion would be, grill the pork to an internal temperature of 140...that's the magic number I use, and it will still be pink, and not overdone. Thanks for another winner!

What a lovely combination of flavors! Impressive results with minimal effort. Next time, I'll back off the ginger a bit and also cook it more since the next day's serving definitely had a mellower mouth feel to it. I used a pork loin instead of the tenderloin with good results. Next time, I'll cut back on the allspice. A definite "do again."

Love the marinade from Grilled Jerk Chicken (May/02 on this site) so made that instead of this one. This peach relish was simply fantastic and a perfect complement for the jerk pork. What a super blend of flavours - will make again and again!

This is a keeper! Fairly easy to make AND it presents as if you toiled for hours and hours. I can also see the chutney used as a relish with quesadillas or over cream cheese with crackers as an appetizer.

Just made the pork exactly as directed on the grill, came out great.

This is a great dish for summer. I served gazpacho first (with lots of vegetable "add ons") and a cheese stuffed grilled chili and black bean salsa and there wasn't anything except the stem of the chili left on any plate. Also, when you do it on the grill there's no mess to clean up.

Great relish recipe. After cooking the relish, I preferred the peaches to be in smaller pieces so I fished out all the peaches and cut them up into 1/4-inch pieces. Next time, I will just coarsely chopped the peaches before cooking.

I love this recipe. I added a few extra spices (clove, nutmeg, cilantro etc), marinated over night, then oven baked the pork the next day. Here is a great tip on the curry. Prepare as directed, however, instead of cooking the ginger and onion add and season the peach and tomato adding a little cilantro to this mixture. Put the oil to heat, once hot add curry and let cook for a couple seconds until pasty. Add Peach and Tomatoes and continue until cooked, just before completion add a little sugar stir and serve while still hot. You'll be biting your fingers.

Loved the peach relish. The marinade on the pork wasn't as tasty as I anticipated, despite being marinated overnight. The relish is definitely the hit here.

I loved the chutney, but next time will puree some as I like my chutney not so chunky. Also my pork seemed a bit dry. I only cooked it to 140. I can usually do up to 150 and still have it moist. So next time I will try 130. Other than that is was very nice.

Rating: 3
Great flavors ! But tenderloins only need need cook to 130 tops and rested for 10 minutes. That way they stay juicy with a slight pink tinge.

The pork was really delicious; flavor- ful and tender. I marinated it over- night and cooked it on a gas grill about 15 minutes. It was done perfectly. While the peach chutney was good, I would cut down on the curry next time, or maybe skip it altogether.

Fantastic. I used boneless pork chops and took them off the grill at 120 degrees. My friends were impressed and complimented the pork over and over. The relish is like all my favorite things rolled into one dish.

Rating: 2
The curry and ginger was a little overpowering on the pork. By itself it had a nice flavor. I baked it for 25 minutes at 425 and it turned out very tender. I probably would pan sear it first or grill it next time.

I didn't make the peach relish, so am only giving it 3 forks in case that isn't any good, but the pork was delicious. I substituted home grown jalapenos and thai peppers in the marinade and they were hot, but it's not spicy like the jerk chicken on this site. I only cooked mine for about 20 minutes and then let it sit for the 15 minutes suggested and it was done just right and very moist and flavorful.

Definitely a keeper. Great refreshing way to prepare pork tenderloin for the summer.
