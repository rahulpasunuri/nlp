Great recipe. It makes a great base for improvisation. I added some heavy cream (probably negating the benefits of not using butter) instead of the cooking liquid because I forgot to save it. I also added some garlic powder which was a good choice because it masked some of the raw olive oil taste.

Exceptional, everyone loved them, the chives and olive make the difference!

Great substitute a 'dairy-ful' mashed potatoes. I left out the chives though and added about 1/4 cup of roasted garlic- even my 8 month old loved it!

I'm not rating this because my boyfriend made this with half olive oil and half butter, but I found it fantastic that way. Great flavor and texture.

We really enjoy this recipe. I tried it initially because my dad has cholesterol issues, but I've continued to make it for my husband and kids because it's healthier and still very tasty. I've only made this recipe with Yukon Gold potatoes.

Simple and very tasty. I used Yukon Gold potatoes, which I think made the difference in taste and consistency.

This tastes okay, which is what you can expect from something that is this quick and easy to prepare.

This recipe stinks. Nice idea, but it just doesn't work. Potatoes have no body, no texture. You really need the dairy to make it good. I had high hopes for this and was very disappointed. Threw away all uneated portions.

Wonderful to discover a recipe for mashed potatoes that is neither heavy nor tasteless. Trust this recipe with sauces or gravy. Stands up, but not out!

I'm shocked! I made these potatoes, as suggested, to match the "chicken braised with white wine and garlic"... they are better than any dairy-based mashed potato I've had. Because the flavor depends on the quality of olive oil, don't use a supermarket oil... this is an occasion when the fancy $20 bottle really makes a diffeence!! I pefer spanish olive oils, but there are lots of good choices out there. Splurge... you wont be disappointed!

Surprisingly tasty mashed potatoes. I thought I'd miss the dairy components, but I was wrong. I used Yukons and didn't peel them, so preparation was very easy. Very good as is, but I'll probably experiment with other flavors when I make this recipe again!

I chose this recipe because we have some family members who cannot eat dairy and I usually end up making two types of mashed potatoes. It was a nice alternative to the usual(boring)margarine and chicken broth mashed potatoes we usually have when we all get together. Everybody loved this dish, so from now one I can get away with making just one kind of mashed spuds.

Very good, quick & simple. Big hit with the kids, too.

this was perfect for a low cal, light dinner with the sea bass with mushrooms and scallions in miso-soy sauce that was in the same issue of Gourmet. I served this Xmas week after we had gorged on all the fattening Xmas dinner. You never miss the lack of cream and butter. I used a buttery potato (red Yukon Gold) and did not feel the need to add any cooking water. Microwaved the potatoes, mashed with the skins on and sprinkled with a little sea salt and ground pepper. Could not be easier and just delicious. I need this recipe to lose some weight after the holidays.
