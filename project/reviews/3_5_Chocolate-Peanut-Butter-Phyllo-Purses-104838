I made this for Valentine's Day for my husband and kids and it just wasn't a hit. The brownies by themselves are AMAZING! I will definitely use that recipe again and again. In fact, they are probably the best brownies I have ever tasted. Almost souffle-like. But the combination of the brownies, ganache, peanut butter and phyllo just didn't go for us (and we love chocolate and peanut butter). When I make the brownies again I think I will simply serve them with a loose whipped cream. But I won't be making this dessert combination again.

This is an excellent dessert, the presentation is gorgeous and the flavors are good. I doubled the peanut butter mixture and loved it. With all this said, it is a time consuming recipe. Make this if you want to spend time making a beautiful dessert but, if you are short on time or have tons of other things to cook which are difficult; I would suggest another dessert.

I put only one brownie in each bundle and I would suggest putting more peanut butter in each "purse". These kept well in my refrigerator. I had 3 left over from my party and they were just as good the third night as they were the first. Easier than it looks...and exceptional in taste.

This is a great recipe! I made it for a dinner party and everyone was amazed. I have made them many times since. You can assemble these and freeze them until you are ready to use. I take them directly out of the freezer, then brush them with the butter and about 15 min later, you have a wonderful dessert. (I agree with a previous reviewer, however, that you need to double the peanut butter).

I made these for a party and everybody agreed...it needed more Peanut Butter...but still delicious! I cut the brownies into squares, spread on the PB and folded the phyllo around it forming a square (for those of us who have trouble with nice looking "purses"). When serving, I cut them in half, displaying the inside, and added a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Very rich and very d'lish!

YUM!! This was a phenomenal dessert. Served it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and everyone raved. I am not the best with phyllo so they weren't as pretty as I would have liked, but impressive looking none the less. The brownie was key - so fudgy. I look forward to making these again.

Of course the best part of trying new recipes is playing with them. I wanted something new, different but still easy to make as a "foodie gift". Here is the twist on this one. Make the brownies as per the instructions but dont cut into rounds, cut into rectangles. Cut the phyllo into long strips (remember to cover the sheets you are not using with a damp cloth to keep them pliable). Place the brownie and toppings on the narrow end of the strip. fold over until it makes a triangular packet. Bake until golden. Cool. NOW dip into tempered dark chocolate and drizzle tempered white chocolate over. You can box several as a gift or plate individually with sabayon or raspberry coulis for presentation. Dipping the packets keeps them fresher longer too!

I thought these were fun to make, though time consuming. I dont find phyllo to be too wily; its fiesty but forgiving... although my beggars' purses looked kinda fugly, and not like some cute little twisted sack. I dont think this recipe emphasized enough the need to brush melted butter all over the filo. Calories be damned, you gotta do it. The brownie recipe was good because it was flourless, super-choclatey and not heavy in weight like a real brownie, so unlike the other reviewer, I'd make them again. Instead of regular sugar in the peanut butter, i used powdered. It just melds better. These are grody a day later, due to the filo dough losing its freshness quick. i would cook them before dinner and let them reach a room temp by the time dessert comes. In short, go for it.

I liked this, I think you could use any brownie recipe and the phyllo dough was tough to work with - perhaps puff pastry would work. It was a hit with my guests.
