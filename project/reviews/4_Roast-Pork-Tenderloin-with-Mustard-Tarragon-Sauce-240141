Very good and pretty easy. Even the 7 year old like it. I only had 30 minutes to marinade it but it seemed sufficient.

Just the recipe I was looking for! Fantastic if you are like me and not a big fan of "sweet" flavoured pork. I did double the amount of garlic as I think there is no such thing as too much.

Fabulous & easy; found the reviews interesting as Tarragon is my 2nd fav herb next to Basil.. I added extra fresh tarragon. Great recipe & quick & easy; definite keeper!!

hey- I reviewed this in January and need to update. Made it as written this time with fresh tarragon etc. only exception was 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream. I kept the sauce on extra low heat while pork cooked and it thickened enough... better than I thought because I generally am not a fan of tarragon. Still want to say I got home from work at 5 and ate at 7:15 with polenta and peas.. amazing.

Just made this for dinner along with roasted potatoes and sauteed spinach. My husband and I both loved it. The only change I made was to use ground allspice and dried tarragon. I only used about a teaspoon or less of the tarragon. I thought the the flavors were well-balanced. This would be a great dish to make for a dinner party- it's so easy and delicious.

I gave this 3 forks because I had to change it a little. Otherwise I thought it was really good and weeknight -after-work easy. I marinated for 30 minutes with 1/4 tsp ground allspice, 4 minced garlic cloves and then cooked although I found it took longer than recommended. I made the sauce as directed but subbed 2T of fresh sage (didn't have fresh tarragon) and it turned out great. My teens even liked it and are generally not pork lovers.

A nice easy way to dress up a tenderloin. Took a little longer to cook than I expected, though. I served it with a parsnip risotto. Yummy.

Great result after a minor tune up. Herbs and spice tend to take over this otherwise delicious recipe. Reduce tarragon to 1 tablespoon. Use 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice versus grinding 8 whole. To enhance the mustard flavor combine 3 tablespoons Dijon with 2 tablespoons whole grain mustard. Fabulous!

This was bland and nothing special. The marinade was good, but the sauce did not relate. I prefer to brown the tenderloin in an ovenproof skillet, and then finish in the oven. Remove the meat from the pan when done and set aside to rest. Deglaze the pan to capture all the roasted meat flavor, and then make your sauce.

It seemed like there might be kind of a lot of flavors going on what with the rosemary, allspice, mustard and tarragon bu it totally worked. It was really lovely and special but not difficult to make.

This is delicious. I marinated for 3-4 hours, used ground allspice, wrapped the loin in prosciutto, because, well, yum. We bbq'd it as well, which was gorgeous. The sauce thickened beautifully and was deliciously flavoured...I love tarragon. The only thing I added to the sauce was a sprinkle of salt.

My family and I all liked this dish, but I wasn't in love with it. I followed the recipe exactly, but found the sauce to be a little too acidic. My husband and daughter liked it more than I did, so I may try it again with a small change. Perhaps reducing the mustard to 1 tbsp. in the sauce would help. Presentation and simplicity were both nice.

This is a wonderfully easy - yet elegant way to serve pork tenderloin. You can plate this beautifully and it tastes like a very complex recipe. It has become a veritable staple in our household - I have substituted more thyme in the sauce omitting the tarragon - as I don't care for it - tastes even better to me. A real winner

It was delicious. Husband and 2 teenagers enjoyed it very much. Sauce never thickened up, I'm not sure that it really needed to be thicker.

I don't understand the complaints about the sauce; this dish would be totally inadequate without it. I made this as written, with the exception of using ground allspice instead of whole (2 tsp) and using whole grain dijon mustard both on the meat and in the sauce. That may have made the sauce better than the prior reviewer's experiences. Also marinated for 3 to 4 hours (why not?), and cooked both the meat and the sauce for longer than the recipe called for. Make sure to cook the sauce long enough - it will thicken up nicely if you give it enough time. All told, the recipe is good, but not the most fantastic thing I have ever tasted. It gets a solid three forks.

I love pork tenderloin, but didn't like this recipe. If you like pork with fruit (apricots/ apples) thne you might not like this one either. I wouldn't make it again.

Excellent recipe. I would expect this from a nice restaurant. I added some white wine to the sauce and that was the magic touch to it all. I then coupled this with Stouffer's frozen scalloped potatoes. Pour the sauce over it all and it is incredible. I'm not a big pork eater, but I would highly recommend this to anyone. Make sure you don't get a pork tenderloin that is pre marinated in Mojo. It's not a good mix.

Roast is nicely flavored but I did not care for this sauce. I have a recipe for mustard, tarragon & white wine flavored cream sauce for chicken which I would use instead.

This was my first time cooking pork tenderloin and based on this recipe it won't be the last! Very easy and delicious. It came out very tender and the sauce gave a unique but subtle flavor. My husband even ate the leftovers (not usually a leftover kind of guy!)

I used all dry herbs on this recipe and it still came out tasty. I also substituted the heavy cream with 2 parts yogurt to 1 part low fat milk (to reduce calories) and it came out creamy still. I also substituted marjoram for the tarragon, jerk seasoning with all spice, and it all worked well. Coming from a finicky pork eater I would make this again.

THis is just okay. It actually tasted a little weird with the creamy mustard sauce. We like the garlic lime pork tenderloin MUCH better.

This produces gourmet results with a simple preparation. Just watch the cooking time as I had to go 40 minutes for slightly larger tenderloins.

The pork had a nice flavor from the marinade, but we didn't really care for the sauce. Next time I will use thyme instead of tarragon for the sauce.

So great! I also doubled the sauce. Guests were putting the sauce on EVERYTHING!! I also reduced the wine, tarragon, and broth first then put the cream in and reduced a bit more. Super!

Rating: 3
The pork marinade and mustard rub part of the recipe was quite successful. However, I had to make the sauce a bit different because the first time I tried to make the sauce, it "broke." So, I boiled down the broth and mustard, and then finished it with some cream and a couple tablespoons of butter. It complemented the pork nicely and I liked it a lot, especially because I'm going through a "tarragon phase" right now.

Loved this recipe - very easy. Split the mustard by adding 2 tbsp to marinade and 3 tbsp spread over pork prior to roasting. Sauce is great and very good on veggies as well. My family loves this recipe

Loved the sauce. I might follow one reviewers suggestion next time and brown the tenderloin first. I also think that the sauce needs more time to reduce to thicken. This would be so much better if made the day before (the sauce, that is)and re-heated.

The sauce is to die for! I simplified the recipe, however, by simply making slits in the pork and stuffing slivers of garlic into them - used a LOT of garlic! Then seasoned the pork with salt, pepper, and a tiny bit of ground all spice. Browned it on the cook top until done to medium, transferred to warming drawer, and continued with sauce using browned bits from the skillet - Truly yummy and very easy.

I wouldn't waste a full cup of white wine in the marinade, supplement with chicken stock. That's what I will do next time and save most of the wine to drink with dinner.

ps...White wine is not a necessity for the marinade. Maybe a little bit but not a full cup. Next time I will supplement with a chicken broth and save the rest of the wine to drink with dinner.

This was yummmmmmy! First of all I put the mustard in the marinade. I marinate it about 3 hours. I pan seared the tenderloin on high heat then when crusted enough I added some of the marinade to the skillet, then popped the skillet into the oven to cook the pork. I too used ground allspice. I did make the sauce per the directions but added about 1 tbsp of butter at the end to make it a little more velvety. When the pork was done, I removed from the pan and reduced the pan drippings, adding a little bit of floud and chicken stock to make more of a gravy, so we had 2 sauces for the pork.

Superb! Ground allspice on hand so I guessed at the equivalency to whole berries; 1 1/2 tsps worked but I'll add more next time, and make extra sauce as it's great on fresh asparagus.

This is my favorite kind of recipe. Easy, delicious, and people claim I'm a 'gourmet' cook. I just make what sounds good to eat; if the dish uses up leftovers (fresh tarragon, scallions, etc)., I like it even more! Thank you, Kelsey; have any more?

Wonderful recipe for a dinner party. I used more pork than the recipe called for because the first time I made this, the pork was gone. I also grilled the pork on a gas grill which gives it even more flavor.

Excellent! Easy to prepare, but gave the impression it wasn't. I served it with the Mashed Potatoes With Prosciutto & Parm Cheese. I was the host of my girl's dinner this month and they went back for thirds. I will for sure make this again. The meat did take a bit longer to cook.

I, too, used rose, no thyme, beef broth and wine in the sauce. It def took longer to thicken than 10'. Pork was tasty but the crusty skin made it difficult to carve. Oh well. I will make it again!

Great recipe. Foolproof cooking instructions since pork at 145F is still slightly pink and very juicy. Used a fruity rose, because I always cook with the wine I drink with the meal, and added 1/4 cup of wine to the cream sauce after first tasting it without. It really added more depth to the sauce.

This dish was a big hit! Flavorful and easy. I served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. I used fresh tarragon for the sauce but added some dry as well for more flavor. It took approx. 15 minutes to reduce to the desired consistency. Will definitely make again!

For ease-to-results ratio, this definitely deserves a 4. The pork was perfect - just slightly pink and fantastically tender, and the sauce was wonderful. I'm a big fan of fresh tarragon with pork and chicken. I'll confess that I didn't actually measure any of the ingredients, but even eyeballing it, the entire recipe came out beautifully. A good sign of a keeper.

This was a very simple, tasty recipe. Even the 3 children under 5 years of age liked it! I did have to bake the tenderloin 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe suggested. I was worried that the pork looked dry, but the inside was still moist and juicy.
