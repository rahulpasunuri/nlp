This is a good, basic marinade. I bought a 2lb boned,butterflied leg and adjusted slightly, using 1 bay leaf and using 1c red wine, marinated overnight. I made sure there was some pink in the meat, grilling each side about 4' at 425. There's a nice, strong red wine flavor to complement the garlic,mint and lamb. Do ahead for sandwiches later.

It is easy to cook, easy to slice and very delicious.

This is my new standby lamb marinade. It is so simple to prepare. I have made this dish twice now, once with leg of lamb and more recently with two racks of lamb. Both turned out delicious! The rack of lamb was even better because we allowed it to marinate for 2 days. I grilled it on our gas grill and really it was so good no sauce was needed. The meat was so tender. I was not the biggest lamb fan and this has me converted!

I got excited to try a four fork rated recipe. With lamb being my favorite meat I was all set for something great. I consider myself a better cook so I have to say it was the recipe. I sure don't know what I missed but I followed the recipe exact!

Simple and delicious. This worked well for a smaller roast. Also, I want to try the marinade with lamb loin chops and grill them.

This was an excellent recipe. My guests thoroughly enjoyed it. Unfortunately lamb is so expensive in South America. I actually tied the lamb up with more mint rolled inside for flavor. Marinating in the wine helped. Overall it was tasty and you didnt have to bother to pass the mint jelly.

This recipe was delightful! I added minced shallots to the marinade, used thick cuts of high quality lamb chops, and spooned a generous amount of marinade over the chops before baking. It turned out very tender and full of flavor. Be generous with the salt (sea salt in my opinion is better) and use fresh cracked peppercorns. I'll definitely continue to make this! Thanks!

I like this simple marinade because it does not overwhelm the lamb, which I am leaning towards (away from the mustard coatings I always used in the past).If you are using top quality lamb it is excellent. BBQ till it reads 130 degrees(around 45 minutes)

We followed the recipe 100% on the marinate. After a 48 hour marinate, I grilled over a hardwood fire. The grilling added so much flavor. This is by far the best lamb we have EVER eaten.
