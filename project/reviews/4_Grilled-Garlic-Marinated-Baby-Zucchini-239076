Yummy Yummy Yummy. I saved the left over garlic and oil from the marinade and used it in my pasta sauce the next night. Definitely making again and again

Really surprised at the great reviews for this. Probably wouldn't make this again, just didn't do it for me.

Simple and delicious - I served these at a picnic and they were gone within seconds.

I also adore this SIMPLE recipie. If "sashasinging from Denver" is as sophisticated as she seems to claim, I wonder why she bothered to even read this recipie? Notice she admits she really DIDN'T even try to make it - just complained about it. Honestly, let's remember the big picture here - creating and serving food is meant to nourish the soul and our loved ones and they, as well as us, the cooks, can often benefit from a little simple clarity. To cooking - I often add a step to this dish by having prepared a bowl with a small amount of oilve oil in it (apprx. 1 tsp. to 1 Tbl. depending on the amount of veggies I'm doing) mixed or whisked with a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice and about 1 Tbl. of chopped mint and/or fresh Italian parsley added. I pop the zucchinis (sometimes I also use a mixture of quartered yellow summer squash with the fluted edges) off the grill in one big group & dump them in the bowl and give them a quick swirl in the oil mix. The lemon juice serves to freshen the flavor and the mint intensifies the garlic. this does make it an added step but if your recipie happens to include mint already or parsley, you're practically home free. Also, the oil is a good chef's bread dipper. Let's all try to get along - we're all cooks and that's our primary love, right?

Wonderful...we get so caught up in doing complex foods just because we think more is better. It is nice to see a recipe every now and again that actually lets us taste the food we are cooking. Be a food snob for quality not quantity!

another reason for a recipe like this...I come to epicurious for ideas about what to cook, as well as recipes. Just now...what do I grill with the grilled honey-ginger-pineapple salmon and fresh corn I plan to serve to guests this evening? this recipe gave me the perfect accompaniment (but I'll add little yellow squash, pearl onions and crimini mushrooms to the mix)...so I don't mind the basic recipes being here

the other thing for people like sashasinging to keep in mind is that when they appear in the magazines, recipes like this are usually part of a larger menu. you should keep in mind that context when you see what may look like "simplistic" recipes on epicurious. they put every single recipe from the magazine in the database - i'm sure it's automated, which would be why recipes like boiling rice show up here. (and lastly, i put simplistic in quotes because i think recipes like this are useful not only for beginning cooks but also for more experienced cooks like me - i know from my experience with garlic that whether its crushed/sliced/ chopped/mashed makes a big difference in the flavor it imparts to a dish.)

Plan to make this over the holiday weekend. As for its simplicity, I was glad to see the suggestion to pierce and marinate the zukes. I'm quite an accomplished cook, but not such a snob that I can't pick up a tip here and there.

This is a wonderful recipe and a great change of pace. Despite other comments, some need reminding of the beauty of simplicity and some are still learning.

I don't doubt that this is delicious, but I'm confused about how this can be considered a recipe. What's next, a recipe for toast with butter? I expect more from this site. Is there really a person who needs this site to document how to put salt, pepper, garlic and olive oil on a veg then apply flame? Shame on you epicurious.

This was very flavorful and smelled great on the grill. I couldn't find the baby zucks and just cut the larger ones into spears. I'm not even a big zucchini fan. Yum!
