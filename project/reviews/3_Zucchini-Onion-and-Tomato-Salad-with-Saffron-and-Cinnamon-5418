No Forks! I completely agree with Vancouver BC - truly weird taste - we didn't like it at all.

I thought I was safe to make this with all the great reviews... but it wasn't very good at all. Weird taste and it seems like something major is missing...threw most of it out.

"2forknowledge" should not rate a dish that he didn't bother to prepare. The flavours do NOT cancel each other out - they complement each other beautifully. This is a very nice change of pace salad and will happily surprise your guests. I liked it a lot.

Made this to go with "Moroccan Chicken". It was great. Did not make it early enough so it was still warm (and would have been even better if the ingredients had melded more). I would not serve cold, however, or you'd lose the subtle flavors.

I have made this recipe and I disagree with the reviewer from Calgary. The cinnamon and mint definitely do not cancel out the other flavors. In fact, they all marry a bit too well, and the salad needs a little sharpness. Maybe some feta, this would not comprimise its low fat status. It is gorgeous to look at and is a good dish for a bbq w/ grilled meat or if you're having guests.

In my estimation the cinnamon cancels out the subtle flavor of the saffron.Although I have not made this "dish", by reviewing the recipe and technique of prep, I can taste the outcome.As well the mint will as well detract from the saffron as well. I wouldn't add as much of the mint but ,instead add pine nuts [slightly warmed and gloden] this would be a nice addition and add some charisma to this salad/meal.

a supremely simple and elegant summer surprise. has a controlled element of sweetness and very practical as well. prepare this dish while grilling, directly on the barby. (the company of beauty is a must)
