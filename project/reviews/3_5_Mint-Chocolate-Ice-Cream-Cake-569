I thought it was ok, although the crust was too crumbly and should have had some more melted butter (maybe another tablespoon) to help it stick together. My kids thought it was great, but I think a better recipe on this site is the "S'mores Coffee and Fudge Ice Cream Cake". The fudge sauce recipe in that recipe is really fabulous and would be great in this recipe, too.

I am making this for the 2nd year for the dessert table tomorrow (Thanksgiving). Here are the changes I made last year & it turned out fabulous: I put a layer of chocolate whipped cream (using this recipe: http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/103791) between the chocolate chip mint and vanilla ice cream layers (I did not use cookies and cream ice cream either). We couldn't find mint chocolate chips, so we melted Andes chocolate mints. I used an 11" springform pan and made 1 1/2 times the ingredients called for... I think adding the layer of chocolate whipped cream and using vanilla instead of cookies and cream made this cake taste lighter, although it is very rich & decadent. Off to put this together for tomorrow!

Made this with one layer of chocolate ice cream and another of chocolate-chip ice cream and put a thick layer of hot chocolate sauce between. I prepared it for my daughter's birthday party and five of the eight friends she invited wanted the recipe! Rich and delicious and wonderfully easy. Only problem came in the cutting of it because it melted too quickly!

I made this cake for a co-workers birthday and now other departments are trying to steal me away so that I will cook for them. It's extremely easy to make, and to compliment the texture I made a hot fudge sauce and spread it over the top of the finished cake (once it had cooled of course) and then sprinkled some mini mint-chocolate chips on top. Definitely a hit.

I made this cake for my son's birthday. He was visiting from the San Francisco area. When I said goodbye to my grandson who is 9 years old, and told him to visit again, he replied, "I'm coming on my Dad's birthday so that you'll make the ice cream cake again". It was absolutely wonderful. I took Leanne Hockenberry's tip and put a layer of hot fudge between the ice cream layers. We are all health and nutrition conscious but if you're going to throw all the rules of proper eating out the window, this is the way to go!

How can you go wrong with this one? Next time I might reduce the amount of cookies and add a layer of hot fudge between the cookie and ice cream layer. The flavor possibilities are endless...

easy to prepare. I used vanilla ice-cream in lieu of the cookies & cream.

I made this dessert for a dinner party. It was perfect for a hot summer night after barbecuing and a day in the pool. It got rave reviews from our guests and wasn't difficult to make. We've adapted the recipe to using other flavor ice creams too. Used gingersnap crust with vanilla and caramel ice cream - delicious!!
