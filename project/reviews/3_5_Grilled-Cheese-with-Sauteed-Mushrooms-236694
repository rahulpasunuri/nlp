I added 1 clove of garlic and some parmesean and added the truffle oil into the mix (a must for flavor). I also used the packaged mushroom mix at my grocery store instead of all cremini. I did not cut off the crusts. These are supurb!

I made this with manchego cheese. I also added a little bit of onion powder to the mushroom sauté. Delicious.

I don't even rate this 1 fork. A complete waste of time, money, effort and even gas to go to the store to buy the ingredients. Bland, tasteless and greesy.

I made these for our holiday party and they were a HUGE hit. People raved about them and gobbled them up. Excellent recipe. They key is to find the Pepperidge Farm Very Thin Sandwich bread. I don't think anything thicker would work very well if serving them for an appetizer. I'm going to make this recipe again for a party this weekend, but am going to use the mushroom and cheese filling to top baguette slices for crostini. Then sprinkle the truffle oil.
