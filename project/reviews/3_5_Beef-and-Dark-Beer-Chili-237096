WAY too much heat here for us. I used really good medium hot chili powder from Penzey's and half the amount written, thank goodness or it would not have been edible. I will not be making this again.

Only make this recipe as specified if you have a HUGE pot. I used 4.5lbs of ground beef plus two extra cans of beans as previously suggested. I also added the whole can of chilpote with adobo sauce and used two more jalapeno's plus lots of garlic. The consistency was "dry" so I also added an extra bottle of stout. Make sure you cook this for about 4 hours to meld the flavors together if not it will turn out with a sharp bite. Also adjust the spices to your taste and don't complain about how your chili doesn't have any "flavor".

P.S. That is I hope to make the chili if the ICE ever clears.

Tthis sound fabulous, but does anyone ever just cube the meat instead of ground beef? IO'm making this for the weekend, but would love to use pieces of meat insteadof hamburger meat. Thanks

I'm making a very similar chili as I speak. I didn't follow this recipe exactly but I do want to point out that I think 5 lbs of meat is way too much. I usually use 1 lbs with the same amount of tomatoes and add 4 cans of beans. Much healthier and just as delicious!

This recipe was certainly good, but nothing extraordinary. Next time I'd use lots more chipotle in adobo, a different beer besides the Guinness Extra Stout I used this time, and lots and lots more beans. It still was a hit a super bowl party but I wasn't totally impressed.

This is such a crowd pleaser. I have madei t for a few superbowls. I always think I've made too much, but it somehow gets finished.

Better than I expected. Had to make a few minor adjustments but it didn't seem to matter. I used an extra 28 oz. can of tomato, the whole can of chipotle chiles with liquids, 90 minute IPA (instead of dark beer), less chile powder (about half), green peppers (instead of yellow) and 4 jalapenos (instead of 2). Sounds like a lot, but I don't think it drastically changed anything. It is a hearty chile with a low gas factor! I would make it again...and again.

I'm not sure what all the raves were about for this chili recipe. It wasn't anything special in my opinion - just tasted like regular chili. The beer did not add any distinct flavour. Also way too much onion.

My new favorite chili recipe! Wonderful flavors. I don't like kidney bean so I substituted frozen corn. YUMMY!

Here's how I've tweaked the recipe & find it VERY flavorful w/out a lot of extra work. I use the Cumin & Coriander called for, 3 Tbs (vs 7) of chili powder, 3 packets of McCormick chili seasoning, and lots of S&P. I also keep the bell peppers out of the cooking & add to individual bowls for nice color & crunch. I add a 3rd can of kidney beans & a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. After I brown the beef, I take it out to drain the fat & then saute the onions & jalapenos in the same pot & then add the beef back in. I also let it simmer for quite a while. Don't skip the chipotles as they add a nice smokey flavor. I think I used a Rogue Chocolate Stout last time which was delish (both in & out of the chili!)

Very very bland. I used 2 of the largest jalapenos I could find, added extra chili powder, and doubled the chipotle, but it was still too bland for me. I guess I like my chili a lot spicier.

Rating: 3
Delish! Love the flavor of the Stout (we used Guinness) in the chili -- it gave it a deep, rich flavor. Since a few reviewers thought it was a little bland, I added a few cloves garlic + a little garlic salt + a smidge of fresh cilantro at the end. Turned out great!!

Rating: 2
Chili is suppose to be a one-pot type of thing. Here's how I would do it: One pot and one pot only. Cook with salt and olive oil until soft. Then cook the meat while mixing with the onions until it's not pink. Pour your veggies, beans, sauces, etc and bring it to a slow simmer for the next hour while stirring.

Made this for a holiday party on a snowy night. Took forever! Used more pans than my normal recipe and not a lot of pay-off. Tasted good, but sort of mushy in the end. Might consider adding stout to my other recipe, though.

Loved this recipe, I got compliments and recipe requests from people at my husband's work as he took it for left overs the next day.

Delicious! I don't like red meat & 5 lbs is too much for my boyfriend and me. So, I substituted the 5 lbs of beef with 1 lb of ground turkey and it was perfect! It was a bit too spicy for my boyfriend who is sensitive to 'hot' foods but it was perfect for me!

Wonderful chili recipe. The sweetness of the red and yellow peppers goes nicely with the smoky spiciness of the chipotles and the beer flavor. I also used Guiness. I doubled the amount of beer and chipotles called for in the recipe. I don't like beans, so I subbed with a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes. I also had to increase the amount of chili powder, but I think that may have been due to the quality of what I had. I just bought some really good chili powder online and can't wait to try again.

Made this for a winter afternoon party after searching for just the right chili. Made the day before and kept warm in the crockpot as another reviewer did. Works great. Used Hockley's stout. Subtle taste. Did not want smoky taste so left out chipotles. I think this recipe will tolerate more beans - I added another can and a can of diced tomatoes. Delicious.

This is a beautiful recipe. Very colorful. My only complaint is that the stock was a little thin on the front taste, though complex on the back. To compensate I added some garlic and a dash of worchestshire and some cajun salt. Used an oatmeal stout for the beer. Next time I might go darker to also alleviate the thinner taste. At the end of the day, my friends all raved so it was a huge success.

I cut the recipe down to make about 5 servings. Used a whole bottle of Guinness Draught, more cumin and more peppers and it came out great!

This was such a hit!! I used about 4 1/2 lbs. ground chuck (had my butcher grind it for me), used extra chipotle chiles, used Guiness stout, did add one can of yellow corn, and also used 2 small cans of tomato paste to add a little thickness. Really fantastic - everyone raved about it!! Made it the night before in a hugh pot, then for the party the next day kept it in a big crock-pot on low. Perfect!!

Great recipe! I must have extremely fresh jalepenos and chili powder because mine came out SPICY. I love it that way, but my husband couldn't eat it. I added a few more cans of beans and a can of diced tomatoes. That seemed to even it out. Need a HUGE pot. very good -- used a 16 oz bottle of oatmeal stout. Delicious.

I love this recipe and yes, it does benefit from extra spice and salt. I've also used ground venison instead of the beef. Excellent!

Even better with a whole can of chilies in adobo and extra fresh chilis (habeneros, etc).

My family LOVES chili so I am always trying new recipes. This one has become the standard- I make a few changes to suit our taste. This makes a ton of food, so I always scale it back to about 1 lb. beef. I use one 28 oz can of tomatoes, additional chipotles in adobo (I use the chilies and sauce for more heat), cumin, garlic, and then stir in a bag of frozen corn at the end. I have had a hard time finding the cream stout, so I usually use Guinness. Its delicious!

This makes a HUGE amount of food! Make sure you have an extra large pot. I added some fresh chopped cilantro...really gave it another layer of flavour.

This was so good... but only because I read the reviews first. I added a lot more tomatoes, tomato paste, and beer, and I upped the spices, and salted quite a bit. I also cooked it for about two hours, adding more liquid as it cooked until it was the consistency I liked. I also used Guinness. BF and I both give it four forks with these additions, but I'm giving it three because as written... can be improved. I also didn't add any extra oil. I cooked the beef, drained all but what I needed of the fat, and cooked the veggies in that. Yum!

Made this tonight, I used Guinness stout and had the butcher grind the meat for me. It made a ton and I froze a lot. It was very good (spicy, I added extra chipotle) but the cheese and sour cream cuts the spiciness. The extras are a must with this recipe and so is a lot of salt! A keeper!

This was a good recipe but benefitted from a few changes. I doubled the amount of beans, doubled the amount of chipotle, added more chili powder and cooked it for a total of 2 hours. Then it was great!

I made this recipe as specified. I can't figure out why reviewers are calling it watery. There is not much liquid in the dish, and it turns out super thick, with almost no liquid, and very meaty. Adjust heat to your preference.

While the stout was a great addition, cooking this chili left my kitchen smelling for a few days. It was so unappealing that no one could bare to eat the leftovers. Next time I will try adding the stout to some of my favorite chili recipies.

Forgot to mention that I halved the recipe and made it in a crockpot - let it go for 8+ hours. I think that makes a huge difference.

LOVED the flavor of this chili, but 5 lbs. is too much red meat for me, so I did 1.25 ground beef and 1.25 ground turkey. My husband raved and raved and ate leftovers for days (which he never does). This will be our new standard chili recipe. yum.

I agree with the comments stating the recipe is bland. I added garlic, salt and two heaping tablespoons of beef soup base paste. Even with those additions, it needed to sit in the refrigerator overnight for the full flavors to come out. It ended up winning first place in the Super Bowl chili cook-off I attended. I probably will not make it again though.

This chili was not very good. I prefer a heartier chili - this one was very watery. I even let it simmer for about an hour more than the recipe calls for. It had a good spiceness, but I added hot sauce and red cayenne pepper. I would not make this again.

This is not a very good chili recipe. It was way too bland and I ended up having to add a bunch of spices to give it flavor including ancho chili powder, mexican oregano, passila chili powder, garlic powder, more cumin, more chipotles, tomato paste, etc.) I do like the idea of using the stout; however i would just add it to your standard favorite chili recipe.

This dish had more meat than chili I'm used to eating. I halved the recipe and used a full 14 oz. can of Guinness. I bumped up the ground cumin and coriander some and added in my own mix of chopped jalapeno and habanero. I drained the fatty jucies off the cooked meat before combining the veggies (less fat this way).

I followed the recipe exactly, including the Sam Adams Cream Stout. I agree with the previous posts about cooking time. I took a taste test at about 25 minutes; not enough time. I just let it simmer until dinner (about 2 1/2 hours and it definitely improved the flavor and thickness. I might make it again as a nice change from the tried and true family recipe, as I have never used the chipotle chilis or adobo sauce in my cooking before. My husband liked it and suggested next time adding a few noodles or even using it for a base for a chili dip.

Rating: 4
This chili was great with a few changes -I used almost one pint of Guiness Extra Stout instead of Sam Adams, 4 lbs of ground chuck, 1/2 the cumin, none of the coriander, and 1/2 of the rest of the ingredients. I cooked the chili for 45 minutes instead of 20 minutes. I shared some of the chili with the guy from the liquor store that recommended I use the Guiness Extra Stout!

Made this for "dessert" at a Patriots party last weekend...sigh. Halved the recipe. I, too, wondered where the garlic was, but pressed on. I had never seen a chili recipe simmered for 20 minutes. I simmered it covered for 1 hour and then uncovered for 45 minutes to let it thicken a bit. Folks seemed to like it better than the outcome of the game.

I cut this recipe in half, which could account for the fact that the "chili" flavors are lacking. I'm going to buy one of those stouffers seasoning packets and throw it in to give the (huge amount of) leftovers some more flavor. Otherwise, great texture, great foundation.

My husband just ate this and said, "This is the best chili you;ve ever made...don't throw the recipe away"....So I guess it's a keeper! You will need a 12 qt pot for sure, more chili powder than recomended and I also added some tomato paste. Even my 5 & 7 year old ate it up. Enjoy! Very hearty for a cold winter night.

I've been making chili for more than 30 years and this is one of the best recipes I've ever encountered. Using fresh, coarsely ground chuck instead of hamburger is a big improvement and the flavors are just great. I'll be making a big pot for Super Bowl Sunday!

I made this recipe directly from Bon Appetit, before reading this website. I was very happy with this dish. I was skeptical at first because of the large amount of bell peppers used, but found it to be about right. The recipe was plenty spicy for me...but my jalapenos may have been hotter than others. I generally like some fire, but not ear smoking fire. But then, I don't live in New Mexico! Mine was also not acidic...again the tomatoes are the source of that. I also used Guiness Stout, another flavor factor. There are alot of variables in this recipe and personal preference has alot to do with it. I would make this again. P.S. Don't let the Virginia fool you, I've lived in California.

found the taste too sweet and acid tasting, because of crushed canned tomatoes. The red and yellow bell peppers are sweet enough by themselves. Then Kidney beans overpower the flavors of the chili and should be served as a side dish which can be added by diner. I would replace the tomatoes with El Pato' salsa de chile fresco and add ground cummins to increase the chili flavor. then increase the beef flavor with a little Better Than Bullion beef paste. Good real chili is a hard thing to find, so I alway cook my own. Here in the Land Of Chantment, New Mexico. Chef Robert

Yeah, my basic chili recipe uses 1/4 cup chili powder per 2 pounds ground beef so spices seem quite light here. And where's the garlic?

This recipe is entirely too bland. Like the previous reviewer, I like the base and the beer adds much flavor. The peppers add to the eye appeal. Next time, I'll add more spices and more salt.

I made this recipe last night (halved this recipe for the amount of guests we had) Overall, a really good base recipe, but we felt the spices were a bit off as it tasted too bland. Added more of the top three (chili powder, cumin, coridander) to taste and it ended up great. Everyone loved it! I will defintely make again (just with more spices next time!)
