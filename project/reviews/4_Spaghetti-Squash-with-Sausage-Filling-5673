I used swiss chard instead of green pepper and my squash was half the size recommended with the same amount of everything else. (feeds 3) It was delicious. A complete meal! Don't forget the cheese topping.

I increased the bell peppers, and increased the proportion of squash to meat sauce, then assembled a "pizza" on a large cookie sheet, with squash as the crust. Topped the squash with meat sauce, then light sprinkle of panko for crunch, then parmesan. It was pretty, reasonably healthy, and a big hit!

But definitely better with double or triple the sausage!

I followed the same process, but with a ground beef filling. I also avoided the plastic wrap as a previous reviewer did, and cooked cut squash halves, one at a time, in a covered casserole with a bit of water in the bottom, which took about 10 minutes each half on high in m/w. I used perhaps 1/3 c left-over pizza sauce to moisten the beef/veg mixture. It was still pretty dry but when cooked in the squash moistened up nicely. Very nice, and the other half reheated well another day.

This was so good. I mixed in some italian blend cheese and placed the whole thing into a lightly sprayed baking dish. Heated for 25 minutes at 350. A wonderful healthier option. My husband raved about this dish.

Recipe is a good start. You can really add anything you would normally put in spaghetti, that's the point, to sub the squash for the noodles. The real point of this review is to address some of the concerns/input about how to cook the squash. The Cook's Illustrated cookbook (an excellent guide to technique) says to cook spaghetti squash in the microwave (I always do), if you don't want to heat plastic (I don't), put it cut side down in a glass casserole dish with a lid (pyrex style) with 1/4 c. of water. Microwaving gives you a better texture than baking.

I have attained the ripe old age of 57 and have never prepared or eaten a spaghetti squash. My wife and I belong to an organic produce delivery group. A spaghetti squash showed up in it this week. I looked up this dish and made it. It was easy and delicious. I stuck to the recipe and will be preparing this again.

Rating: 4
Everyone is right. I am always skeptical, and tend to try more complicated things. But I had all these ingredients and went for it, and I just loved it. I did the squash in the microwave just like the recipe says and it was flawless. I love the texture of the spaghetti squash. I made a quick marinara with the last of this summer's basil and used turkey sausage, draining it before adding in the rest of the filling. I topped the plates with Romano cheese upon serving because I like it to be throughout. My squash-hesitant boyfriend was ecstatic.

Rating: 4
This was so simple and delicious! I followed the recipe almost to a "T". However, I peeled the squash and cut it into pieces and then steamed it on the stove while browned the sausage and veggies. It saved time and really made the squash nice and soft. Delish!

Rating: 4
I really liked the idea of using Spqghetti Squash this way. The changes I made were to bake the squash and instead of the green pepper and onion, I added some cooked and chopped kale. One important tip is to drain the cooked spaghetti squash very well. I emptied the flesh/strands into a colander and a cup of liquid drained out.

Very excited to try this recipe. I finally joined so I can post a comment as I love reading from everyone. A note on the microwave - great advice from others on the pvc plastic issues. But if you get safe microwave stuff, be advised it can be a fantastic way to to steam - very very good at retaining nutrients (better than boiling that's for sure). I was always a skeptic but the evidence is turning.

Rating: 4
What an awesome dish this was! I have to admit, my husband was less than enthused to try this one, but sure enough he was back for 2nds! I took everyones advise and halved the squash lengthwise and baked it face down for 50 minutes- which was perfect timing on a 3.5 squash. After the sausage was about done cooking, I added onions, lots o' garlic and mushrooms and 3/4 jar marinara, then I tossed in the strands of squash and added a little water. I served it up with fresh parsley and lots of parmesan cheese, a nice salad and a french baguette w/olive oil for dipping. Fabulous!

My family loved this recipe. I added mushrooms and cut the sauce to 1/2 cup. (I used my own marinara.) It is not the most beautiful side dish in the world to look at, but it is delicious and packed full of veggies. Perfect for a winter meal. I served it with Fried Flounder, Mac n' Cheese and a salad. A big hit and I will make it again. It is great because you can make it ahead and let it sit, then reheat it in the oven for 20 minutes.

I've now made this twice. A few months ago, I wound up with a spaghetti squash and kind of freaked. I didn't understand it. It was confusing and weird. So I looked up recipes, and found this, knowing that you can't go wrong with sausage in a recipe. So I made it for myself and my boyfriend (who is one picky dude) and we almost died with happiness. He actually requested that I make it again, so I did last week and we devoured. It's SO easy to make, and so hearty and delicious that it feels like you've used a ton of ingredients and spent hours on dinner. I like to use a spicy Italian sausage and a sweet sauce. For some reason the combo of spicy and sweet make me a very happy girl. If you've got a spaghetti squash and you feel confused, stop right here. I promise you will not be disappointed.

This was my first time making spaghetti squash, and I followed some suggestions from other reviewers. I baked the whole squash for 1 hour at 350. I substituted chicken sausage for the regular sausage, and I added low-fat mozz to the top for the last part of the recipe. So healthy but so good.

We loved this recipe. I recommend baking the squash whole at 375 until tender. It is easy to half after being cooked and it is more healthy being cooked in the oven rather than the microwave.

Got immediate raves with this one. No bell peppers (allergy), plus I had to sub a jar of porcini tomato sauce and some sliced italian sausage - it proved to take substitutes well. Hearty without being heavy. Leftovers reheat well, too.

Wonderful! We add mushrooms and ground beef but it would be great without too! We also had trouble with it storing too much water so we cut off one end off of each half to let some of the moisture escape. We make this often!

Absolute YUM however, please please PLEASE don't cook your squash in anything plastic as suggested by this recipe. PVC-based films contain plasticizers (toxins) that can migrate into your foods via heat. Even the newer low density polyethylenes (LDPE)'s are of concern. Also, please never microwave your foods in tuperware for the same reason. Other than my adversion to the plastic wrap, the squash turned out fab. Thanks!

Just made this for dinner, it's fall in Quebec so squash is everywhere :) I made my own sauce from fresh tomatoes (also in season). I never measure anything so I didn't follow the exact amounts, and I also used half spicy italian sausage and half extra lean ground beef, just 'cause I wanted to try to be a bit healthier. I also didn't add any green pepper as I had added roasted peppers to the sauce I made. I followed a few other reviewers and cooked the squash in the oven and I added a sprinkling of bread crumbs with the parmesan (fresh grated). It was VERY TASTY :)

Add me to the list of converted skeptics. This dish was easy and tasty. My meat loving husband actually called me as he was eating left overs for lunch today to once again reiterate his shock that I made him a meal that was almost entirely vegetables that he wants to eat over and over again! I also used spicy sausage and red instead of green peppers. My squash shells also fell apart too much to use for the baking piece, so I baked in a baking dish for 25 mins and it turned out great.

My husband and I daydream about this recipe. Very easy, and with phenomenal results. I always through in some extra basil and tend to use sweet instead of spicy sausage.

I made this on Monday following recipe almost exactly with exception of using vegetarian spicy chorizo (Soyrizo) in place of the meat. My squash-ambivalent, meat-eating, leftovers-averse boyfriend loved it and suggested we eat the 2nd half of it on Wednesday! Awesome. I took advice of other reviewers and baked squash whole, pierced, at 375 for an hour, rather than microwaving. I used the time to make a salad and prepare the sausage filling. I will definitely make this again.

DELICIOUS! I'm a college student who enjoys a low-carb, healthy diet and it's been difficult to find easy recipes to quickly make. This one takes the cake, hands down. I made it in 30 minutes between classes and then popped it back into the oven for dinner that night. Next time, I think I might mix a little shredded cheese in with the sausage mix and use a spicier sausage (I like the heat). Overall though, awesome! This is a recipe I'll be emailing to my mom!

Great recipe, especially when low carbing! Ingredients sound boring but it all comes together into something delicious. I mostly stuck to the recipe as written. No problem microwaving the squash. I used Owens brand spicy pork sausage in the tube (it has an excellent flavor) Because I had them on hand, I added sauteed mushrooms, fresh rosemary and fresh italian parsley. I mixed a good dose of parm reggiano into the mixture, filled the shell, then topped with shredded mixed italian cheeses (mozz, provalone, etc). I think this really helped it all come together. Baked for a little longer than called for. It's important to use a baking sheet, not a casserole. This allows more drying during baking. The BF loved it as well and he's not that into squash.

This is probably the best spaghetti squash recipe that I've come across so far. I followed the advice of baking the squash whole at 375 for 1 hr. I used 4 cloves of garlic and sliced mushrooms. I only used 1/2 lb ground turkey and added a oregano, s/p, and chili flakes. I added Prego mushroom and basil sauce to the meat mix. Then I sprinkled with 1 cup parmesean/asiago cheese and baked for 20 minutes. The dish came out very flavorful and was better than I had thought it would be. I will definately make again.

OMG- that was so amazing! My first experience cooking spaghetti squash, so I followed the recipe almost to a T and it was absolutely perfect. Used spicy pork sausage, but any kind of bulk flavorful saugage would work well. Using the microwave to cook the squash saved tons of time, so the entire recipe was made start to finish and on the table in less than 45 minutes (because ours was only about a 2 lb squash, I was able to microwave both halves at once). YUM!!

I haven't tried this yet, but certainly will as we are very fond of spaghetti squash. In response to Amanda, I have successfully frozen baked spaghetti squash. It gives off a lot of liquid after thawing which I drain off and add to soups or stock. In my experience, the best spaghetti squash is organically grown and cooked soon after harvest.

OMG - how yummy, total comfort food! Have to admit I was a little bit doubtful, could it really be as good as everyone was saying? Used hot lower fat sausage, red bell pepper & mushrooms with just a little bit more seasoning. Baked it in a casserole dish as my squash halves were messed up. Even better is that I'm on Weight Watchers and converted the recipe on their online tool....only 7 points per serving! Will be making this often. Does anyone know if you can freeze it?

I used half mild Italian sausage and half hot Italian sausage. I also used red bell pepper instead of green. Was generous with the garlic and added basil & thyme. After cooking the squash(I cut it in half, put it open side down in some water in a casserole dish and cooked it in the oven for an hour), I mixed it with the sausage mixture and just put it in a baking dish (My squash shell was broken)and then added freshly grated Parmesan (I'm pretty generous with it.). It was yummy. Served it with some good bread and a salad. And, the nice thing is, you can make it ahead. Definitely a keeper!

Very tasty and satisfying! I usually avoid spaghetti squash recipes that use any sort of tomato sauce but in this case it was a great combo especially with the sausage. After reading the other reviews I decided to bake the squash instead of microwaving it, doubled the garlic, used turkey sausage, substituted red bell pepper for the green, added about a half-cup of fresh basil, used a whole jar of Classico tomato and basil sauce, bumped up the cheese by a quarter cup, and placed it all in a casserole dish. Thanks to all the reviewers who submit their feedback. This dish was perfect the first time.

While this was baking in the oven, it smelled like pizza! but much better for me. I chopped up the green pepper and instead of cooking it with the meat, I mixed it in with the squash before beaking it so that it would retain some crunchiness.

I never cooked spagetti squash before, so I had no idea what to expect when I cut it open. I had 1/2 a med eggplant that I cubed and added to sausage and used 5 garlic cloves. I had 1/2 jar of Classico spicy red pepper sauce and added enough chicken to extend sauce. I baked the squash like one reviewer said, but I found that it was hard to get the seeds to separate from the squash, losing some of the squash. I mixed it all together and put in a casserole. Perfect make ahead meal. Next time I will cut in half, seed, then bake. It was soooooo good. Better than putting the sauce over spaghetti.

Have made this several times, usually with chicken italian sausage and my own marinara. One of the best tips I've ever read on this site is from the cook from New York who said to pierce the squash and cook it whole @ 375 for an hour.

I thought this recipe was a great way to get vegetables into my very picky fiancee. I liked it a lot; my fiancee liked it ok (not enough to want to eat it the next day). I made it with turkey sausage and just cooked it in a casserole dish. I thought it came out kind of watery. Also, I didn't like having to pick out the seeds from the squash (it was my 1st time cooking with spaghetti squash). Is there such a thing as seedless spaghetti squash?I'll probably try it again, but next time with ground beef..maybe he'll like it better with what he'd call "real meat."

My husband has always hated spaghetti squash until I made this recipe.

I've made this recipe as written (except one thing which I'll get to) and it was excellent. Have made it using hot sausage and it's really excellent, and have made it using ground turkey, you guessed it, excellent AND healthy! Now for my other thing...big suggestion....instead of nearly cutting your arm off hacking the thing in half, just pop the whole thing in a 375 degree oven for one hour, and then you can cut through it like it's butter! Just use an oven mit to cradle one half as you scoop out the squash. This may take longer than microwaving, but it's way easier.

I used bulk italian sausage. It was incredibly full of flavor.

This is one smashing recipe! As always, I heeded my fellow cooks and doubled the garlic, and added basil, oregano, bay leaf, and 2 stalks of diced celery. I used good quality hot Italian sausage without the skin, and did not need to drain the grease.

Here's what I did: browned crumbled italian hot sausage; added to the recipe 2 stalks of celery, chopped, 1 can of diced tomatoes, basil, oregano and salt and eliminated the store-bought marinara - let simmer for a bit. I loved cooking the squash this way - it wasn't 'watery' at all.

Very enjoyable to eat and fun to look at. I imagine this would make quite an entrance at a dinner club meeting.

i substituted ground buffalo for the sausage and added extra garlic. although i forgot to "spaghetti" the squash before i baked it, it still tasted great and was a hit with my squash -hating family.
