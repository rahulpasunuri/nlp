I give it 4 forks for the raw version. I skipped the cooking of the cranberries altogether. Let syrup cool, soak cranberries 24 hours, drain, dust liberally with sugar, let dry. Crunchy, tart, sweet, and so delicious. (Just make sure to discard soft ones -- they have a funny taste).

Hey, these are good! They remind me of those chewy gumdrops, but they're healthy. Well, as healthy as something with a cup of sugar can be. They look like little jewels, they taste delicious and they won't pull your crowns out. What's not to love? You definitely have to watch the heat to make sure they don't fall apart. Next time I'm going to experiment with cinnamon and orange rind to flavor the syrup.

These were incredible! Very easy -- the secret is to keep the temp down while the cranberries are in the double boiler. I will make these every year!

This is very festive looking. The problem I had was the cranberries began to fall apart after 20 minutes. Was the 45 minutes a misprint or did I do something wrong. The taste was great but I didn't know what to do with the ones that fell apart.
