I meant to give this 3 forks, I don't know why it ended up with 21/2

This was very good and refreshing on a hot summer day. My husband even liked it! I used a semi-sweet Gewurztraminer and zero sugar. With a ripe watermelon, it was not necessary to add sweetness. At the end, I added some sparkling water. The feta was a wonderful foil to the sweetness. I would add extra chunks of watermelon and pass the feta --we all wanted to add a little more.

Great. the mint was over powering. Will only use 1/2-1/4 of the mint next time.

I took a que from the other reviewers and increased the ratio of the chopped watermelon/mint mixture to double what the recipe cites and went a little heavier on the mint and ginger. This recipe relies on the flavor of your wine. If you don't like wine, don't try this recipe. If you do like wine, choose it carefully because the soup will be served colder than you would normally serve the wine. I chose a very flavorful Alsatian Gewurztraminer (Dom. Zind Humbrecht). We enjoyed it outside on a very hot evening and decided we had to have this again! I rated this recipe based upon the published recipe. But with the modifications I mentioned, I think it rates four forks.

I love this soup! It is light and refreshing. It doesn't even need the sugar. Everyone loves this soup!

Made on hot day in July. A cold broth-yes;a soup, no. You may as well call it punch or juice with extra flavour - quite a disappointment.

This was a sickly-sweet mess with an obnoxiously unpalatable flavor. Stay far away from this disaster.

All my guests enjoyed this. I used this recipe as a base. I had some ginger simple syrup already. So, I boiled the mint, lemon, and wine in it. I served it with a scoop of mango sorbet, and it was fabulous!

very easy to make, but complex taste. Everyone loved it.

What about the sparkling wine or water? I assume it goes in the soup just before it is served.

This dish is quite tasty, although I'm not sure where Self gets off saying it could be a meal. It's really like a chilled broth once it's strained. I was afraid I'd burned the ginger with the brown sugar and lime, but it turned out to make an excellent flavor. The soup is pretty tart, which I loved as a first course. I will make this again, but I might leave in some of the pulp to give it a bit more body next time. This would be great with a salad of spinach and caramalized walnuts, perhaps some goat cheese. Now that's a meal!
