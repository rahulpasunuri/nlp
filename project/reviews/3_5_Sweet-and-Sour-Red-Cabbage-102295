This was good. I would definitely make it again if it were just for me. My husband didn't like it though; he said it tasted like raisins. It kind of did, but it didn't bother me though. Like some other reviewers, I used maple syrup instead of sugar, and olive oil instead of butter. I really like red cabbage though so I would make this again just for me.

This was awesome,I added one small onion and used Vermont Readl Maple Syrup instead of the sugar. I only cooked it for a total of around 18 minutes total. YUMMY!!!

Great recipe - will make again. I have tried other red cabbage recipes that included wine, spices and other ingredients but was never satisfied -- this was exactly the recipe that I have been looking for.

Easy and a delicious accompaniment to grilled pork chops.

This is delicious. I use olive oil instead of the butter. Add a bit of apple and onion too.

Delicious and easy, I used brown sugan and added a half sweet onion. I think I might add apple also next time. I also want to add that I love this site, I can almost always find a great recipe for any occasion.

Good recipe. My husband liked it and isn't a sweet & sour cabbage fan. Good accompaniment to the Veal with Gorgonzola.

Very mediocre. It was easy to make and very nice color, but the taste left a lot to be desired.

I had this dish at the restaurant and then made it at home from the directions the chef gave me - but it is even better from this recipe. The cabbage is a great side dish with tenderloin of beef or any other red meat. Yum! I, too, have family in Lansing and have eaten at Cafe Borgia many times - the chef is incredible. Try out the veal recipe, too...

Addictively delicious and so easy to make -- and really does complement pork. Will definitely make this again and again.

Easy to make and delicious! Goes great with pork dishes.

Very very very good. Make it right before you serve it so that the cabbage is still crisp. Fabulous side dish! Good with veal & pork.
