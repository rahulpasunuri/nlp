Spectacular cookies; I'd been looking a long, long time for the perfect spice cookie recipe. I usually (but not always) cut the cloves to around a tablespoon and a half, and I also add a half teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of cardamom. And since I never seem to have mace, I either omit it or substitute allspice. I love the soft, chewy texture.

These are one of my favourite cookies (and I'm rather picky)! I just made them even though it's August and they smell like Christmas ;) I substituted Ener-G egg replacers for the eggs this time (my brother is allergic) and they still worked perfectly. My whole family adores them.

These came out beautifully, but I had read some of the reviews and cut the cloves down to 1 T. Next time I'll add the full amount. I bought fresh spices for this recipe, but it wasn't as spicy as I had anticipated.

Frightened by the previous reviewers, I cut the amount of cloves in half, but next time I'll use the whole 2 tablespoons. These are great spice cookies with a nice texture. I'll surely work these into my Christmas rotation.

These cookies are wonderful! I have had many compliments on them. However, I have reduced the spices greatly. I use 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1 teaspoon ginger, and one of cloves. I also add about a half teaspoon of nutmeg. And, I do omitt the mace. It is just the kind of spice cookie that I have been looking for! Not too spicey, but wonderful!

These cookies were wonderful. The amount of cloves is NOT a typo. Everyone loved them at Christmas and they have asked that these become a regular addition to the holidays. These are a great cookie to make with your kids. My younger son really enjoyed rolling them in the sugar. I didn't have any ginger so I added nutmeg instead. It was great! A double batch was gone in a day.

The quantity of cloves is a typo--it should be 2 teaspoons.

These are the BEST cookies! I have made these for years and my husband craves them--not too spicy, but spicy enough to have flavor. Try them I PROMISE you will NOT be disappointed!!

This is one of my favorite cookies. BEWARE there is enough spice in here to NUMB YOUR TONGUE. If you dont want your tongue numb, reduce the amount of spices. But made as is, this is very spicy, chewy, delicious cookie.

I adore spices and strong flavors, but two tablespoons of cloves in a cookie? Perhaps the spice quantities are a misprint, since I followed the recipe as is and the taste was truly revolting.

I have made these many times since the recipe first appeated. They are wonderful, especially if you like a ginger cookie with truly spicy flavor. Several years ago I sent in this recipe in exchage for other people's spice/molasses cookie recipe and I tried all the others (about 12). This one was still the best - by far.

Excellent recipe! They are delicious and picture-perfect. I found that my oven required a good 12-13 minutes. Definitely chill overnite and if you have white sugar crystals (bigger granules than regular sugar) they are even prettier.

These cookies are really good. They get nice and crunchy on the outside but stay chewy inside, my favorite! Make sure you chill them sufficiently, that seems to help develop the crunchieness of the outside.
