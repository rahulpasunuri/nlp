I was a little disappointed after reading so many good reviews. This wasn't bad, but wasn't anything I would make again. I am sure that it didn't help that the radishes I picked up were very mild. I felt the salad was missing something - croutons, nuts or dried fruit, maybe.

The dressing is different and really good. My radishes were on the milder side for some reason so would love to try it with some radishes with more bite. I would make it again.

I made this salad for a Thanksgiving potluck last year and it was a big hit! especially the radish dressing...everyone kept asking me for the recipe.

After a trip to the farmer's market (without a list in hand), I came home with a bag of goodies and was looking for a great side dish to make with the funky-looking radishes, beautiful and thin green beans, and red onion that looked kind of like a scallion. This recipe was the perfect match and after tweeking the dressing a little (I added much more honey mustard and sherry), it turned out great! I used bibb and raddichio lettuce and I thought they worked great.

Awesome flavors! Easy to prepare, beautiful to present. This one is another keeper!

This a great side salad or first course. It helped me use up some radishes that I couldn't seem to get rid of. I substituted Congac vinegar for the Sherry vinegar. I used Spinach for the greens. Pretty, very healthy and great with my feta quiche.

A grest change from the "standard" green salad. The dressing was oh-so-good. It would be great with griiled chicken or shrimp too. I only had Boston lettuce and radiccio in the fridge. A heartier blend of greens (as suggested in the recipe!) would have been better.

Absolutely delicious! I would use more radishes in the sauce. I only had regular mustard so I added 1 teaspoon honey. Marvelous!

This was delicious. The first time I made it my guests asked for the recipe, and I've made it several times since, always receiving compliments. (Note that the dressing only lasts a couple of days.)
