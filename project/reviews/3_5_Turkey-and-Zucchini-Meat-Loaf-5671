Good healthier meatloaf, moist & flavorful. Made this a few times, the most memorable on Halloween when I shaped it into a hand. Was scary but yummy.

Dry. Bland. Potentially a good recipe if favors were intensified. Hubby ate one slice - by my forcing!

I've been making this for years and it is a favorite. After the first time we replaced the glaze with marinara sauce and like that better. I also add grated carrot and celery and use gluten free subs for the breadcrumbs,(a sometimes guest has a gluten intolerance !) everything from ground cheerios to rice krispies to crumbed gluten free bread. This is a forgiving and delicious recipe.

I make this at least once a month and have turned several people onto it. It's so good. I even had to use strawberry jam once and it was still delicious.

Best meatloaf ever! Added some fresh chopped rosemary, some chopped elephant garlic (I did not have any regular) and and for the glaze, I used a mustard/vinegar salad dressing left over from last night. YUM!

I meant to say 1/2 teaspoon poultry seasoning!

Rating: 4
This is my go-to dish. I've only made one change after making it so often. Instead of using seasoned breadcrumbs, I use whole wheat breadcrumbs and add 2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning. I've made it with both dried and fresh parsley without much noticeable difference. To keep the ingredients from clumping, I add everything except the turkey and egg, and mix well. Then add the turkey and lastly the egg. Let the meatloaf stand in the pan for at least 15 minutes after baking to reabsorb all the juices, it will not be a dried out meatloaf!

Edible, but not a taste sensation. I might make it again but it would need some improvement.

Super yummy! I added minced garlic in place of powder, worcestershire sauce and also used orange marmealade istead of peach preserves. Excellent. My kiddos loved it and had several helpings :) I served sauteed red and yellow bell peppers with crimini.

Delicious! Kids and husband both loved it. Made it exactly as stated, except used orange marmalade instead of peach preserves since that's what I had on hand. This will definitely go in our "have again" rotation.

This is great! I didn't like the sweetness of the glaze initially, so I cooked it on top of the loaf for ten minutes, and mellowed nicely! Next time I will add carrots and garlic.

I am not a meatloaf fan, but my kids liked this one. It is quick and easy and includes veggies (always a plus). Next time I might have to grate the zucchini finer to sneak it past my son, who was a little suspicious of it. I used the extra glaze on some steamed baby carrots.

Rating: 1
I don't know if it's because I skipped using the peach preserves or what but this didn't turn out to be very good (at least for me). It was very bland...just didn't have a good flavor. I'm wondering if the peach preserves is the key that gives it the "zing" that it needed.

Rating: 4
Hands down the best meatloaf I've ever had. I sauteed the onions and minced garlic ahead of time, like other reviewers suggested. And since I just had plain breadcrumbs I added in some seasoning -- oregano, basil, a little sage. Otherwise followed as directed. Absolutely delicious. Served with potatoes and peas. Felt very 1950s -- in a good way!

Rating: 3
This was indeed very good. I used plain bread crumbs and omitted the parsley(I had none). For the glaze I also used what I had on hand, orange marmalade and a balsamic herb mustard. Yummy! A great use for extra zucchini.

best meatloaf i've ever had. hands down.

Like some other reviewers, I added a shredded carrot and finely chopped celery to the mixture. I'd have to say the outcome was fantastic. I honestly think the glaze made it. Even my "I'd rather eat a frozen burrito" brother-in-law dug it. I've made other turkey meat loaves before, but I'm definitely sticking to this one from now on.

Very tasty and moist meatloaf. I didn't have peach (or apricot) preserves, but I did have a ripe white summer peach on hand. I cooked that down with brown sugar and added dijon. No complaints around these parts.

What a pleasant surprise! This meatloaf was really flavorful and moist. So tasty! Hate to say, it is better than my typical beef meatloaf recipe. It will become a regular at the dinner table for sure! Loved the glaze and everything as-is, but can't wait to experiment with more additions next time, like maybe grated carrots and red pepper? Like the idea of some of the glazes mentioned in the comments, but so enjoyed the peach/dijon it will be hard to switch.

Rating: 4
this recipe was incredible. my husband and i ate 3/4 of the loaf ourselves. i used a pound of ground white turkey meat and mixed in 1/4 pound dark meat. like others i added chopped carrots and fresh chopped garlic. also added some italian seasoning. skipped the glaze and topped with a spicy marinara sauce. the loaf came out moist...i will definitely be making it again!

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly and did like the meatloaf itself but not the glaze. It was ok same day cooked but tasted awful cold and I love leftover cold meatloaf! Will make again but use a different glaze. Really love the one on Lish Nelson's Meatloaf so that's what I'll try next.

Rating: 3
I read several reviews before making the meat loaf and followed some of the suggestions: added grated carrots, cooked the onion and fresh garlic before adding... also added fresh oregano and basil. Instead of a glaze, I served it with a fresh tomato\basil\garlic sauce. Delicious.

Rating: 2
good, not great - I added a shredded carrot as others have mentioned. It still is missing a "kick" though. I will play with the spice next time. Maybe add a diced pepper? A little more flavor is all it needs to make it great. But this recipe is a keeper.

Love this simple recipe! My kids aren't fond of the dijon spiciness in the glaze so I do their end with just the preserves. I do substitute 1-2 minced garlic for the garlic powder.

I have been making this for 10 years, and it's always great. Sometimes I use the glaze in the recipe, but sometimes just a mixture of ketchup and brown sugar baked on for 20-25 minutes at the end is great too. Everyone loves this recipe--and it's also good cold. This is an internet classic!

Rating: 0
I think the whole point of this receipe is because you are trying to have a healhier meal by using turkey. Everyone seems to be missing the whole point that it is only healthier if you use a low percent fat product. I have seen turkey higher in fat than beef so pay attention to the fat content. Why bother eating the turkey if a beef product is lower in calories and fat, and we all know beef tastes better than fat!

This is a delicious meatloaf! I have tried a number of recipes and this is so flavorful. I didn't use the glaze and just cooked it for 65 minutes.

This was excellent. I also sauteed the onions in some olive oil before adding them to the mix. I also used whole wheat couscous instead of breadcrumbs, and it worked out great. A delicious way to get in some veggies. Perfect blend of flavors.

This is our new favorite, since we're watching our fat grams. Make sure to chop the onions really fine. As others have mentioned, the most important item is the glaze. It would be bland without it. My husband loves it even more as leftovers, cold.

The glaze for sure really works on this meatloaf. It is very easy to make and very tasty, but it needs a bit more spices to jazz it up a bit. I made it true to the recipe, but next time will play with the spices a bit.

This is a delicious basic recipe. I changed and added a few things...I only had useasoned breadcrumbs so I added 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese, thyme and oregano. I also sauteed the onion, garlic and celery and then added it to the turkey mixture, which I added grated carrot and basil to. My boyfriend and I loved it. Definitely a new favorite!

Rating: 4
I added BBQ sauce to the meat mixture, and made a little extra glaze to go on top. Also used fresh garlic and sauted the onions first. This is the most delicious meat loaf I have ever had. It is a tad on the sweet side, but that's what makes this so good.

Rating: 3
This is a variation of a meatloaf recipe in "Healthy in a Hurry" which I am including because it is very quick and delicious - goodflavor. Into a food processor, first 3 cloves garlic, then 1 onion, 1 red bell pepper and 1 zucchini until finely chopped. In a bowl, vegetable mixture, 1 lb turkey, 1 beaten egg, 2 tbsp worcestershire sauce, 1 tbsp dijon mustard and salt and pepper -- also 1/3 cup whole wheat couscous instead of bread crumbs (I've also used bulghur wheat).

Rating: 4
This is spectacular! its so delicious ^^ I do not eat wheat, so instead, I used a mixture of Millet and Quinoa flour I got from the health food store. I added celery, Carrots, Basil, Sage, and used fresh pressed garlic instead of garlic salt. I think the extra veggies where deffinitally a good idea. It was so good, by the next day, the entire thing had be gobbled up, something very uncommon in our house, usually, leftovers sit in the fridge until we throw them out. simply delicious! and not very difficult, only very time consuming thing was waiting for it to cook ^^

Incredible! I grew up eating Mom's meat loaf made w/beef - this turkdy meat loaf blows hers away!!! I used about 1 3/4 llbs meat - so I used a little extra of everything and used 1 egg + 1/2 of an egg white. I also used a whole garlic clove and a quarter of a large, sweet onion and 1 stalk of celery - sliced thin - sauteed all of this in some EVOO before mixing it with meat mixture . I Added fresh chopped sage leaves from the garden, fresh parsley (not dried), seasoned salt, and some basil - used 1/2 C seasoned bread crumbs + 1/4 C oats - Used Apricot preserves instead of peach...WONDERFUL! Molded it into an oval and cooked it for the first 45 min. on 365, then the last 25 min. on 350. ` Tossed the rest of the zucchini in w/some boiling potatoes and mixed them w/the rest of the sage and parsley, milk, butter, gar.powder, seas.salt, and pepper w/hand mixer to make AMAZING potatoes. Of couse, serve with ketchup! Even my 3 year old ate up the both the meat loaf and the potatoes! She didn't even know she was eating tons of veggies! It's my husband's new FAVORITE meal. Mine too!

Excellent. Best meatloaf i've ever had. LOTS of flavor. However, I made some changes. I added carrot and substituted fresh garlic for powder and basil for parsley. I also added BBQ sauce. I served with rainbow swiss chard.

I'm not a big meat loaf fan, but this worked for me (boyfriend eats anything so he doesn't count). I used all dark meat turkey, which I think really helped with flavor. I grated 2 small zucchinis, which came to a litte over a cup and half total. Used it all and worked well. Fresh garlic, oregano, parsley. Plated on top of mashed buttered potatos which was perfect... on its own I was not as impressed.

Ever since I made this a couple of years ago, it's the only meatloaf I make. My son begs for it, my husband loves it, it's really good. I add a little bbq sauce, fresh garlic instead of powder and some sundried tomatoes for zip. The zucchini is the secret-makes it really moist. And make sure you use the mustard/jam glaze, that's what makes it really special! Makes the best sandwiches ever!

I was very skeptical of the peach/mustard glaze and almost didn't use it, but must agree that it was a nice complement to the meatloaf. I took other's advice and added fresh garlic and fines herbes to the meat and it was very flavorful (and I'm a flavor junky) This will be my standard turkey meatloaf from now on.

I make turkey meatloaf all the time and this was a nice change from my other recipe. My Husband liked it with the zucchini. However next time I would add fresh garlic, & fresh parsley. I did add green pepper to this and it was good. I didn't have peach preserves, but used apricot preserves and the glaze was awful. I won't use this glaze again but will use my old stand by of bar-b-q sauce, but I will make the meatloaf again. Can't wait to have it again tonight for dinner!!

This was delicious. I have a wheat and refined sugar allergy, so I substituted oat bran for bread crumbs and used dijon and freshly mashed mango for the glaze! I would add fresh garlic, and ample sage, marjoram, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. (per another reviewers recommendation)

Rating: 3
This came out great for me. My husband really liked it; he kept saying how great it was. This was a good use for all the extra zucchini we are getting in the garden and a nice change from zucchini bread (really, how much zucchini bread can a person eat!). Since the other reviews warned of blandness, I did use fresh garlic instead of powdered and I also added quite a bit (small handfuls actually) of fresh marjoram, sage, oregano, and basil.

Rating: 1
I really wanted to like this recipe since we've given up regular beef-pork meatloaf in our house. The only good thing about this recipe was the peach sauce, which I'll use again on chicken. The loaf was so bland - no one would eat it, including my 2 1/2 year old. A far cry from regular meat loaf. I'd like to try some of the other turkey loaves on this site to see if a turkey loaf can ever be edible.

I found it a light and refreshing recipe and not as heavy as the beef meat loaf I am used to. We paired it with a Mommessin Cote du Rhone and the peppery tones with grapefruit overtones matched bautifully with the Meat Loaf.

It was good, but nothing special. It was very moist, but just not flavorful enough. The glaze was good but the loaf itself needed more, perhaps some more spices. It made about 4 servings for us.

Made this recipe as directed. I liked it--but it doesn't begin to hold a candle to a meat loaf made with beef. However, for a turkey/zuchinni loaf, it was very good. Loved the sauce--I will use the sauce for pork chops and chicken breasts in the future. (I added dried apricots to the glaze, and used Grey Poupon Country Dijon and apricot preserves--yum! sauce is best part of the dish). My husband absolutely loathed this recipe with every fiber of his being--said it was so bland, it took massive amounts of tabasco to make it edible. (And he usually loves anything I cook). Won't be making the loaf again, as both of us like beef meatloaf much better. One reviewer says that you've got to be a real ground turkey lover to really appriciate this recipe. I think that reviewer is right-on. Thank you for the recipe, though.

Rating: 4
I thought this was one of the best things I've ever made. I made the glaze with apricot jelly and usded 1/4 cup of oatmeal and 1/4 cup of bread crumbs as someone else did. This is my boyfriends favorite dinner. I will definetly be making it often.

Rating: 4
"Best Meatloaf Ever!" It's all about the glaze. I used the peach preserves and it was great - look forward to trying apricot next time. You could add some extra spices to the meat, but it really didn't need it. The serving size is a little off - this fed 3 people with no leftovers.

Rating: 3
Very tasty and light. I used a peach, apricot and passion fruit preserve instead and the extra tanginess really helped. I think that a little grated lemon zest in the meat mixture or glaze would make it perfect.

Good recipe, but a bit bland as written. I made it for my toddlers, so it is right up their alley. I think the peach/dijon glaze really helps.

The meatloaf is delicious and moist - a winner. I have made the recipe as printed (except I used a large clove of fresh garlic vs. the powder) and liked it a lot. I prefer it with the following changes: use 2 chopped leeks instead of onions, add 1 t. crumbled fines herbes, use 1/4 c. oatmeal and 1/4 c. seasoned dry breadcrumbs instead of all bread crumbs. Great, healthy comfort food -- and the mixture makes great turkey burgers too!

Rating: 2
Found this recipe and liked the look of it because it included vegtables and seemed to be low fat. At the store, picked up by mistake ground chicken instead of turkey. Followed the rest of recipe as written. It was pretty good, but nothing special...a little too bland for my taste and I suspect it was not just because of the chicken. It was healthful however, and I plan to make it again...but will spice it up with something zingy the next time.

This dish is wonderful. I had a sudden craving for turkey meatloaf, searched the web for a special recipe and found this one. I was very glad I found it. I'll be making it again soon.

Rating: 4
Excellent, easy, healthy comfort food. Great for weeknights. My husband always finishes the loaf, so unfortunately we never have leftovers. Like other reviewers, I saute the onions and fresh garlic before adding them to the meat mixture. I usually substitute 1/2 cup of quick oatmeal for the breadcrumbs - this may sound strange, but it blends in and binds the loaf, and is more nutritious than breadcrumbs. I recommend a spicy mustard (or the addition of a little hot sauce) to balance the sweet jam in the glaze. Yum!

Rating: 3
My husband made this today and we just loved it. We used plain brown mustard instead of dijon and will use dijon next time. I agree with previous reviewers -- there is no way this recipe makes 8 servings. We cut the loaf into 6 slices. Our two-year-old loved it. This will be a staple in our recipe collection!

OUTSTANDING!!!!! Whoever would stand up this recipe by replacing beef, is doing themselves and their family a great disservice. My family never knew turkey could taste so good.

Rating: 3
This meatloaf has won over my husband - FABULOUS! My only suggestion (which I'm sure I got from previous reviewers) is to cook the onions and garlic in a non-stick pan with a little olive oil until translucent - it takes the bitter edge off the onion and ensures that it is thoroughly cooked rather than raw when served. I am also impressed with how well this meatloaf freezes - after baking, cool and cut into slices; wrap in wax paper and freeze. Then, you can pull out single servings to be reheated in the mircowave. This is now a staple in our house!!!

Rating: 3
Made this last week, substituting one 10 oz. pkg. of chopped spinach (thawed, squuezed to remove moisture) for the zucchini. Everyone loved it. I agree with a previous reviewer, though, that eight servings is a bit optomistic - four or five is more realistic.

OH YUM! I made this last night for dinner and the 12 year-old and 8 year-old each had seconds! That's a sign of a great meatloaf! I accidentally forgot to add the parsely and it wasn't missed. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I will definetely make it again and again.

I am the sole contrarian here. . . but I thought this recipe was rather mediocre. I added apricot preserves and fresh garlic, but was not terribly impressed. I think that catsup makes a more tangy and delectable topping than the preserves in this case.

WOW!!!! words fail... This was, bar none, far and away the BEST meat loaf I have ever eaten and, in 40+ years of cooking, one of the best dishes I have ever made... Moist and excellent hot, cold, reheated, you name it. Had to substitute chopped leftover broccoli for zucchini; used homemade fresh breadcrumbs moistened with LOL fat-free heavy cream. Amen to apricot preserves in glaze. Forgot onion and never missed it -- a real testament to this recipe. Everyone in family was competing for the leftovers :-) Thanks to all the reviewers before me, whose reviews I actually printed out and studied (never did that before!)

This is great. I would say it serves more like 4 or 5 rather than 8, however. Also good day #2 on sandwiches with a little mayo, dijon mustard, and some of the peach preserves. I used Progresso italian breadcrumbs and they seemed to work great!

I followed this recipe to the last detail, except I substituted chopped spinach for the zucchini, apricot preserves instead of peach, and plain deli mustard--not Dijon. But it was GREAT! (And festive-looking, with the chopped spinach throughout it.) Next time I'll use the proper ingredients, but I don't think it can get much better. I served it with mashed potatoes, salad, and a huge glass of milk. Delicious winter fare!

A very moist hearty meatloaf with a sweet tangy glaze which was great for a Christmas lunch. I used plain breadcrumbs and added a good pinch of some dried Italian herbs before mixing them in.

I confess to having augmented the recipe and haven't tried it exactly as written. But it was "the best meat loaf I've ever had" according to my gourmet best friend. Added sauteed mushrooms, tiny bit of sun dried tomatoes, green onions and fresh garlic (all sauteed w/ sweet onions). Mistakedly bought cilantro instead of parsley but threw it in anyway. Put "Spike" seasoning in everything I cook. Used sea salt. It was unbelievably delicious. Just received home-made peach jam the night before and used that. My children also loved it with my 12 year old son still talking about it today!

This is a delicious meat loaf. I am no fan of meatloaf but saw this recipe when I was looking for a way to use up a huge zucchini. Am I ever glad I tried it. WOW! It was so tasty that I could practically eat the whole thing myself! The only substitutions I made were Fresh minced garlic instead of powder, my own dried plain breadcrumbs instead of seasoned ones, and apricot jam instead of peach. I will definitely make this one again. I baked mine on a non stick baking sheet and it came right off. GIVE IT A TRY--YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!

This dish was superb! I took some other people's advice and also made a few of my own modifications. I also used apricot preserves and fresh garlic - please.... garlic powder!!!! As for my modifications, I sauteed mushrooms with the onions and added a little bit of worcheshire sauce to it. I used my own bread crumb mixture which includes some sesame seeds and Kellog corn flake crumbs. I also added some chopped green onions. I spread the turkey mixture into a square on a piece of wax paper and then spread the onions and mushrooms on top. Then I rolled it up and put it in the loaf pan. The mushrooms and onions made it very moist and added a lot of flavor. It was a really great low fat dish which I'm always looking for.

Superb! This is definitely the very best meat loaf I've ever had, especially with the non-traditional glaze. It's not too "meaty", with the zucchini, and a generous portion of home-made breadcrumbs. However, I would give it "four forks" if it weren't for the modifications. For instance, I used 2 cloves of fresh garlic instead of the powder. Plus, I added dried mixed Italian herbs to the breadcrumbs. Rather than using peach preserves, I used apricot jam and it was divine. Make these minor changes and you won't think of meat loaf in the same (boring) way ever again!

Rating: 3
Probably the best meatloaf recipe I've tried. The combination of zucchini kept meatloaf moist and added another dimension. The sauce made the normal loaf with tomato sauce a lighter, more interesting dish. My husband loved the dish which barely made it to the leftover status. Great the next day as well.
