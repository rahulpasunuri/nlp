Excellent! Used rice wine vinegar but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I served these room temp and they were enjoyed by all. A great do- ahead dish with great results. The chilled leftovers are terrific as well.

We really enjoy these. It's a great do-ahead dish since it is served at room temperature.

So good! I cut the recipe in half because there were only three of us for dinner and the result was just great. A keeper!

This is my "gold standard" for green beans. I've often made these for company and they always disappear. However, the beans must be fresh. Frozen don't turn out very well. Make sure to toast the sesame seeds for the best flavor.

Maybe I was expecting something different.... it turned out to be "okay." The color made me think miso and instead I got mustard.

Made as per recipe. Our whole family really liked these [ my husband loved them my twelve year old daughter says they are amazing ]. May need more salt to your taste.

I used rice wine as well and would make again, didn't have the seeds which I think would have been nice.

Another great way to prepare green beans! In my house green beans are like chicken....always showing up on the menu. So, I am constantly on the lookout for new and different ways to prepare them ~ this is a perfect accompaniment dish.

I just made this for company. It was a hit! Used champagne vinegar instead. The sesame flavor and dijon were a nice and unique pairing. Everyone had thirds!

Even non vegetable eaters had seconds on these green beans!

I have made this recipe probably 8 times, always for company. It has been a hit! Many people have asked for the recipe.

I used rice wine vinegar instead of white whine vinegar and a dash of soy instead of salt and pepper. Also ended up stir frying the green beans in olive oil instead of boiling them. Pretty good and very easy.

Tasted like green beans with mustard. The other ingredients were not strong enough flavors to balance it out.

Very good and easy. Great that it can be made ahead.

Delicious. The toasted sesame seeds add a wonderful crunchiness & flavor.

Ehhh, I wouldn't make this again. The vinegar taste was a bit overpowering even after I had added sugar to cut the tanginess. I should've just stuck with sauting the beans with a bit of olive oil & butter & then adding some sliced almonds. It's the way to go.

Very Good. Easy but tasty.

This is OK...not spectacular. Maybe some garlic would help?

I made this dish for the first time last night to serve to my husband and our elderly aunt and uncle. Everyone had seconds. It was quick, easy, and we loved the crunchiness of the green beans. I served it with grilled Teriaki Flank Steak, for which I make my own Teriaki sauce, and some grilled zucchini, yellow squash and red bell pepper. Excellent combination. My husband says this should be rated four forks and a spoon! Will definitely make this often.

This is a fun and easy way to eat green beans. It gives them a taste similar to a seaweed salad one would get at a sushi restaurant. I like the fact that you can eat the left over beans cold out of the fridge and they taste fine.

Easy and quick, also quite tasty. It's not the best thing I've ever eaten, but I would definitely make it again.

A very good way to make green beans, and very easy.

Very nice change of pace for green beans. I also served them at room temp. The dressing is excellent. Thinking next time to double it & serve the beans over greens.

Served these last night to company and everyone loved them! So easy and because they're served at room temperature (at least that's what I did) it's a great make-ahead dish.
