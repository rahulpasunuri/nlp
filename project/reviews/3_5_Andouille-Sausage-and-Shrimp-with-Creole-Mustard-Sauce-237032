Pretty good. Not mind blowing but easy week night dish with decent flavor

I made this last night with chicken thighs instead of shrimp, no creole seasoning, and I added 1/2 cup heavy cream at the end. It was delicious! The amount of meat and the ratio of peppers and onions was just right. It was even better as leftovers today. I will definitely make this again.

I made this tonight and definitely too much salt in the creole seasoning. I will make it again but will probably use the cajun seasoning. Served with brown rice and spinach on the side.

This was just fantastic! Easy to make, so tasty. Made it for dinner for two, kept the rest for later. Perfect. The mache salad was a nice accompaniment, too! Will absolutely make again.

This is a keeper. Just like my grandmother used to make. Only thing I did differently was to add a few dashes of worchestershire sauce and a splash of heavy cream to smooth out the mustard.

I agree with "tcayer". Try the recipe first as written comment and then change and comment.

I agree; if prepared as written this recipe is superb! I served with a nice crusty bread to mop up all the delicious sauce.

I'm a big fan of spicy food, but this was good anyway. I wish you people would rate the actual recipe before adding all your substitutions. Every good cook can change up a recipe to their liking, but you shouldn't rate THIS recipe based on what YOU changed about it if you haven't tried it as is first! Having said that- next time I'll kick it up a notch with cayenne or red pepper (or both!)

Definitely keeping this recipe. While I couldn't find the proper mustard (which was suprising considering how diverse the grocery stores are in my area), I used a hot and sweet pepper mustard mixed with a little dijon. It was pretty spicy, but we like it like that. Served it with manchego cheese grits and my husband loved it.

As some other reviewers have pointed out, this dish has the potential to be too salty. Maybe it was the Creole seasoning I used. I would certainly leave out the salt that it calls for. Even with the saltiness aside, the dish was just OK. I won't bother to make it again.

After reading the reviews I made some changes. I used 1 Tablsp. Olive oil. After browning sausage(Savoie's Venison & Pork)I tossed in the onion & red bell pepper(which I chopped)& sauted. Then I added I Tablsp. Capers. Let simmer for a few minutes. I seasoned shrimp with Greek seasoning. I omited the vinegar from the dressing and added a pinch of Italian seasoning,gave it a whirl with the hand held blender. I reinterduced the sausage to the skillet gave everything a stir.Increased the heat to meduim-low.I drained 1 cup of quartered, marinated artichokes then added the shrimp. Poured Mustard sauce over the sauce and served over pasta.

Good recipe and my girlfriend loved it. Here's what I did differently: 1. didn't add the vinegar (are you serious, vinegar?) 2. less onions 3. slightly more Cajun seasoning 4. large non-stick skillet is sufficient 5. I added roughly chopped spinach in the final step (when shrimp and sausage added) 6. Substitute andouille for spicy Italian sausage. (Remember to remove the casings.) 7. Sauce needs about 5 minutes to thicken, not 2. 8. Added 2 chopped garlic cloves with vegetables. 9. Shelled and de-tailed shrimp before using.

OK, I'm the only reviewer I've seen who is actually from Louisiana, so let me start by saying that this is NOT Cajun food at all but something fusion. That being the case, feel free to go ahead and change it at will, as I did. I used fresh hot Italian sausage since the quality is much more important than the name on the package. I left out the red pepper, used WAY more Cajun seasoning than called for, added Tabasco sauce, brown peas, a few green beans, fresh artichoke, garlic powder, dried onion flakes, and oregano. I cooked everything quite dry and added the chicken broth at the last and cooked it down, and the spices thickened it quite nicely. I served it over rice. It was delicious and tasted quite like something that I would have had in Louisiana if anyone there had ever thought of it.

The boyfriend and I both enjoyed this recipe. We swapped out the sausage for turkey andouille, but that was the only change. Next time I will probably use half as much sausage and add more shrimp, to lighten the dish. Served with brown rice and sauteed spinach, but I recommend a green veggie with more crunch, like asparagus.

Rating: 3
Good recipe, dependent on the quality of the shrimp and the sausage. I used real andouille instead of the poultry-based sausage, it really makes a difference. I added some sliced garlic with the vegetables and served it with rice, everyone really liked it. Also served a pear and avocado salad with walnut oil and raspberry vinegar, an excellent complement.

Quick and easy for a weeknight supper. Strong flavors though, so I recommend smoothing it out with a salad or some bread. Also served it on rice, but wished I had thought to stir some red kidney beans into the rice.

We enjoyed this for an easy and quick meal. Used chicken andouille and roasted red peppers. Didn't have cajun mustard and thought the red vinegar sounded a bit strange so left it out. Found it had plenty of flavor served over rice. Would definitely make again.

I used 1/2 pound shrimp 1/2 pound chicken andouille sausage and same amt of sauce for two of us. could not find creole mustard. used spicy mustard and a bit of creole seasoning. served with sauteed spinach and mushrooms and brown, jasmine rice. Enjoyed it but wouldn't be top of my list to make again

Perfect for a change of pace! Serve with fresh spinach and over rice or bread to soak up sauce . . . makes home smell delicious . . .

Great recipe. Easy to make. I have trouble finding this sausage so I just substitute some other interesting spicy sausages. Always works out well.

Rating: 3
This was great. Fairly hot, but not unbearable at all. Didn't give it 4 forks because it's quite salty, and the sausage was fatty. Perhaps next time i'll look for ways to reduce the salt (seasoning?) and a lower fat sausage, if it's available. Was a hit at home though and I'd definitely make it again.

Rating: 2
This was good; it's hard to go wrong combining shrimp with real andouille sausage. However, I don't think it compares to the Spicy Shrimp with Andouille on Grits recipe on this site.

Rating: 4
I thought this recipe was fantastic. I substituted chicken andouille sausage to cut down on the fat count and the only add-in was some garlic that I minced and tossed in with the onion and peppers. My husband has already asked me to make this again...twice!

Turkey Andouille sausage was the only variation I made on this recipe.My boyfriend really loved this dish! It was mildly spicy and the sauce is nicely thick. Next time Ill try adding some veggies to the sauce itself. I served it with some steamed okra to keep with the Southern flair.

Rating: 4
This was a wonderful recipe. My husband being somewhat of a picky eater even said so. Instead of buying creole seasoning, I used the spice mix from the Chicken and Shrimp Jambalaya recipe here http://neworleanscuisine.blogspot.com. Also, not having creole mustard, I used Dijon, a 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and more of the same spice mix. The sauce was smooth and flavored the shrimp wonderfully.

although I followed the recipe exactly, I must have done something wrong and if I didn't then one fork rating is generous. IT WAS TERRIBLE.

Not bad, but I couldn't find any creole mustard, so I used another mustard I found that had tobasco in it. The andouille I used was very spicy, but overall I liked it. Served with brown rice, will make again.

Everyone loved this! What flavors! We served it over long grain white rice. You must use Zatarain's Creole mustard, it's milder & sweeter tasting. Dijon is too strong and creates a whole different flavor. Also, use a Creole or Cajun Seasoning that doesn't have salt. You can always add it later, if needed. And finally, buy a premium Andouille Sausage from a gourmet or organic market. You won't regret it!

Rating: 3
We served this over rice. It was good but we suspect that it could have been better. We would recommend a little less mustard and a lot more Cajun seasoning to ensure the dish has a real impact. To be sure, this was definitely tasty and is rather impressive looking. Still, the recipe as described in the magazine rendered a potentially great dish a bit bland for our taste.

Rating: 3
I made this dish the first time as per the recipe and didn't care for the taste of the andoille sausage (I don't know if it was the brand that I bought or the nature of the sausage but it had a strange taste). Anyway, I made this dish again and substituted chicken tenders instead of the shrimp (my husband isn't a huge fan of shrimp) and smoked sausage instead of andouille. It was very good. I couldn't find the Zatarans mustard so I substituted some whole grain dijon and added some molasses to it(based on a recipe I saw for cajun mustard). It worked well. I also served it with white rice. I would definitely make this again for a nice easy dish.

Rating: 4
We loved this! I'm glad I read the reviews though as I also cut the seasoning and mustard [2 tsp seasoning and 2 tblsp. mustard was plenty for our taste]. I also doubled the sauce and even if it is thin if you serve it over rice in a bowl it doesn't have to be thick. One thing I did do that I think would help is that I didn't cook the shrimp first then add them later to the sauce to reheat. That makes them rubbery. I coated the shrimp with the seasoning and added them last [after the sausage reheated in the sauce] and let them cook for maybe 2 to 3 minutes and they were nice and tender.

Sorry, but this was just not good. Decent reviews are reasons that I make new recipes from this site. Just not sure how this one gets the good reviews. I definitely wanted to like it but couldn't fine a reason to.

The sauce had the wierdest flavor... can't put my finger on it, but there was something that gave the dish an off taste. I ended up picking out the sausage (which was delicious, and, unfortunately wasted on this) and eating them with rice.

When I saw the pic. in the magazine I went out and bought sausage just to make it. My grocery store did not have creole mustard so I used a good stone ground one. I will be making this again and again! Even my husband who does not like mustard loved this!

Yuck! I reduced the mustard to 3 tablespoons and it was still too much. Maybe it's supposed to be 5 teaspoons, not 5 tablespoons. My husband liked it, but I won't try it again. There are too many other recipes to try out there.

Rating: 4
This was great! If it wasn't so rich, there wouldn't have been leftovers (which made for great sandwiches). I couldn't find creole mustard here, so used Dijon with no problem. Also couldn't find Andouille sausage, so got french Tolouse (sp?) instead, and drizzled the slices with liquid smoke for a decent approximation. All in all, not very difficult, nor very time consuming, considering the end result.

We loved this for a fast weeknight meal. The only change I made was dijon mustard instead of cajun. I make my own cajun seasoning with out salt so I can use quite a bit of it. I didn't think the sauce was too thin but then I didn't pay attention to the cooking time for the sauce. I always just reduce it until it looks right. Delicious!

Really easy to prepare and delicious. Agree with previous reviewers that grainy dijon or plain dijon works fine. Invest the time to find good andouille sausage though; that flavor was more important to me. Would not put in the vinegar next time. Served with rice. A great weeknight meal!

Very quick and easy--I made it in 45 minutes including chopping and making rice to serve with it. Sauce was a little thin. Yummy!

Rating: 3
This was delicious, easy, and quick, and a change from the usual tomato-based shrimp recipes of this type. I would add more red bell peppers next time. Unlike another reader, I'm not convinced the lengthy (and expensive) search for Zatarain's was worth it--in a taste test, store-brand grainy dijon was pretty close, and a third the price. High quality andouille was well worth it, however. I served it with white rice, but also with real, Southern corn bread made from scratch (not sweet, no flour) and it was terrific.

I agree with the overpowering of the creole seasonings. I reheated the dish the next day on the stove and it seemed better once all the flavors came out.

Rating: 2
I had no problem with the mustard/cajun seasoning ratios, but we felt the andouille (I used Aidells')was overpowering. I would cut the andouille in smaller pieces like 1/2 inch dice and use half as much sausage as shrimp relegating it to a supporting role to give a better balance. We felt the shrimp were superflous, they couldn't be tasted, just added another texture.

Rating: 4
This dish is amazingly simple and delicious. One note: the search for Zatarain's mustard will be worth the effort (although I agree with others that 4 TBSPS. may be enough). It makes it an authentic creole dish. Grey Poupon doesn't cut it.

Rating: 3
We cut the amount of Cajun seasoning (Penzey's) down to 2t., only used 3 of the 4 Andouille sausages in the 13 oz. Aidell's pkg., and used only 3 T. of Creole mustard. Served it with white rice, and it was wonderful. Just the right amount of heat and spiciness for us.

1st time, I used dijon mustard came out great. I made this a 2nd time with twice the ingedience of mustard, broth and vinegar then used tis dish as a topping over pasta, that cut the sharpness and was fantastic, my neighbors loved it.

Rating: 3
Tasty, and seriously spicy. I didn't add all 5 tablespoons of the mustard, but stopped at 4 b/c it just seemed like a TON of mustard. I'll probably ease up on the creole seasoning next time, as the kind I bought was very salty. Might try to toss in some okra next time.

Rating: 3
Not bad. I'm tempted to go with the rest of the reviews here and wonder if the 5 tablespoons of mustard were intentional. I used 5 heaping teaspoons and that pretty much hit my mustard quota. Typo? Other than that question, this made a good, quick (without deveining the shrimp by hand) weeknight meal.

Rating: 1
I found this recipe so strong with FIVE TABLESPOONS of Creole mustard that it overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients. Shrimp has a delicate flavor but it was gone and I couldn't tell what I was eating. I know Creole cooking calls for very spicy ingredients but all I could taste was very acidic mustard.

Rating: 2
I wasn't really wowed by this dish, and given all the other 4-fork ratings, I am clearly in the minority. I prepared it for a friend's birthday and my guests seemed to like it quite a bit. I couldn't find Creole mustard so I used good old Grey Poupon, and I also used chicken andouille sausage, and that may have had something to do with it. I will make it again using the exact ingredients called for and serve it over rice next time. Everyone else loved this dish, so evidently I need to try again. Would probably make a great ski weekend meal.

Very easy. We served this over white rice and that worked well. We also used brown mustard instead of Creole mustard because the latter was not easily available, and doubled the recommended amount of cajun seasoning. That produced a very nice dish, but perhaps the Creole mustard, and less cajun spice, would have made it even better.
