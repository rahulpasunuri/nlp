I continue to love this cake and make it for my husband's birthday every year. This year, I documented the process on my website. http://makinglifedelicious.com/2010/12/08/chocolate-sheet-cake-with-toasted-pecans/. Happy baking!

We took the advice one reviewer gave and used a 9x13 brownie pan. We used some coffee liquer as part of the cup of water for the cake. We also used the tablespoon of instant coffee. We only made half the frosting recipe and used some of the coffee liquer as part of the milk in the frosting. It wasn't done in 20 minutes, so we baked for about 28 minutes(till the toothpick came out clean.)It was wonderful and enough to serve about 15 people a generous portion. It was easy and pretty fast, moist and rich and it had lots of mocha flavor. We will make this again.

Excellent cake. Very moist and chocolatey. I used Dutch Process Cocoa for both the cake and the frosting. I also added a pinch of salt to the frosting. A big hit with my husband and he is hard to please in a chocolate way.

Why did my powered suger not fully blend!? It's kind of lumpy. I'm assuming it was something I did and not the recipe though. But I also used a 9x13... can't see how it wouldn't overflow in a jelly roll pan. Excellent overall though!

I make this cake all the time. I do NOT use a jelly roll pan, because the edges tend to overbake. The cake recipe as it stands is ideal for either 30 cupcakes or a 9x13 brownie pan. Doubled, it is ideal for a 15x11x2 rectangular pan.

I made this for my son's birthday cake and it was a hit all the way around. Loved it! I changed the frosting to a chocolate buttercream frosting. It finished it off well. It will be one we keep for a long time.

This cake is perfect for a pot luck bring along. It is easy, very quick to throw together and I will definitely be making it again. My husband loved it. I did not get much of a coffee taste but it was lovely anyway.

This is exactly what I have been searching for under another name: Texas sheet cake. I remember using margarine and plain water instead. This is indeed a wonderful cake, which is why I have been searching for it. It is easy,tasty and keeps well for days. I love how easy the frosting is.

A really delcious, moist cake. The coffee flavor is very subtle. I don't think anyone really noticed it but it made the cake very flavorful. I will make it again, especially for a large group.
