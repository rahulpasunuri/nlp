This recipe is ravishing! I made it last week and am ready to do it again. The soup is excellent even hot or warm. I bought frozen peas and didn't notice that the bag had 16 oz of peas, but it didn't seem to matter. Also, didn't pulverize the ingredients, juost used my majic wand. This is DROP DEAD DELISH!

Made this as a started for a dinner party last Sat. evening and it was met with rave reviews. Even my Mister (who claims the only way to eat soup is hot, hot, hot) loved it! Very light, refreshing and not a bit of bother to put together.

Fantastic for spring and summer meals as it is light and filling. Used yogurt instead of sour cream chives istead of tarragon. I also topped it with some chive blossoms. Beautiful.

This soup was a perfect starter for an elaborate dinner party; not too heavy, but quite delicious. I made it with vegetable broth rather than chicken stock, which worked fine, and with fresh peas. Two notes: First, the recipe as written doesn't in fact serve 6 -- more like 4. Second, at least for me 1 pound of fresh English peas produced somewhat less than 10 ounces once shelled -- I'd estimate closer to 1.5 pounds are needed if you use fresh peas...

I make this soup every summer and it never fails to delight everyone, and guests always want the recipe. It is delicious and one of the easiest soups I make.
