In my previous review I forgot to mention two things: as written I did find this too sweet, and reducing the sugar to 1/3 was perfect. The vanilla extract worked great, no need to go get a bean if you don't have one.

This is really delicious and easy to make, but the result was much more of a cream than a pourable sauce, which is what I was looking for. To make it into a sauce (to pour over bread pudding, apple pie, or poached pears for example) reduce the cornstarch to just 1 TBSPS. If it's still too thick when you remove it from heat, just whisk in a little whole milk or half and half, a small bit at a time until you have it as saucy as you wanted. Even though mine turned into a cream it was delicious served alongside a cranberry almond torte.

I made this sauce to serve over a chocolate pound cake and thought it was quite good and easy to make. It is on the sweet side.
