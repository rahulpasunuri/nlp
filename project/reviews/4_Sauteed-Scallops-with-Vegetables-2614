I made this just as the recipe instructed and loved it! Delicous, and easier than it appeared to be....

I made a few adjustments - because I did not have tomatoes. I used a couple of canned tomatoes, added yellow peppers and a few sprouts, and cooked it longer than recommended. Delicious.

This was great and so easy to do! My husband loved it. I did not have green onions, so I used a small portion of a vidalia onion. Used red wine vinegar and left out the cilantro. I took another reviewer's advice and used less oil and deglazed the pan with white wine. Gave it a great flavor. Served over rice pilaf/orzo mix (from Near East) and some side veggies (zucchini, asparagus) that I bought at Whole Foods--just needed to heat them up. Overall, a great meal!

Good. Fast, easy, I had all the ingredients except green onions (used regular). I forgot the vinegar and I think that was a mistake. I probably overcooked the scallops a little, too (I have trouble telling when they're done). Nevertheless, I'll save it to my recipe box because it is fast, healthy and tasty - all good things.

I love this recipe...so easy...and tasty too...I have used zuchinni and yellow squash in the vegetable mix...no need to use as much oil as recipe calls for...I also serve over couscous...it's a keeper...especially when you can find some nice sea scallops!

This dish was fair - nothing exciting. Scallops are pretty pricey, so I was a little disappointed & felt like I could find much better uses for the scallops.

My wife loves this. I matchstick some zucchini and serve over basmati rice as others suggested.

Delicious! Added some sliced mushrooms and used much less oil. Served over a bed of couscous and with a side of sauteed spinach with toasted pine nuts. A definite keeper

A+++. I can't wait to make this again - for company next time! Easy and elegant. Carrots gave lots of color served alongside wilted spinach. I sauteed the scallops in butter instead of olive oil. I omitted tomatoes and cilantro and increased the carrots. Next time I would add maybe zuchini or another subtle vegetable that would give the dish more body but not overpower the scallops. The balsamic vinegar I used was almost too much for the scallops but came off fine.

Very simple and yummy! I can't wait to make it again and add other vegetables. I think it would be good with shrimp added too.

Excellent! Who would have thought that a dish with such simple ingredients would be so good? I added zucchini cut in matchstick strips and it made it even better. I highly recommend this dish, for casual company or a family dinner.

This has been one of my favorite recipes since it was first published. I keep frozen scallops in the freezer and so its an easy meal to throw together at short notice.

I served three with this recipe and it was a big hit. I'm making it again today, but adding more veggies. I had it over bowties, but will try a smaller pasta this time. Great taste with the Balsamic.

I took Denver's advice and served this over basmati rice. It was absolutely fabulous! Super easy to make, all the ingredients on hand if you keep scallops in the freezer. Will definitely make this again.

This was a very easy dinner to make. The only change I would make would be cut the amount o oil in half. I found that I didn't need that much. I used fresh scallops and they were wonderful. The balsamic vinegar adds a nice touch.

Quick, easy and yummy. We make this with frozen scallops and we tend to have the rest of the ingredients on hand. So this is a "I'm tired of everything we usually eat but want to have dinner in a half hour". We have it with rice cooker basmati. No sweat.
