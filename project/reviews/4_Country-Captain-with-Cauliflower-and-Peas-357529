I used the slow cooker version listed in previous reviews. Skipped the roasting of the spices and still got the FULL effect. My entire family loves this recipe (11+). My 11 year old's only complaint was that there wasn't more.

I left out the fennel seeds, cloves and cardamom seeds because I did not have them. Also, I substituted sultan raisins for the dried cheeries. Despite some of the spices missing this recipe was still exceptional. I dished it over basmati rice as well. Very yummy. Highly recommned this recipe

This is tasty. We enjoyed it last night and it will make a great lunch today. I don't love cauliflower, so this is a good way to eat it. I will say that the time and effort of this recipe is a bit much for this result-- lots of dirty bowls (with setting the ingredients aside), lots of chopping, and lots of steps that adds up to almost an hour of cooking time. Not a great weekday recipe.

Wonderful. For lack of time, I pureed a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with the spices, garlic [doubled], ginger [doubled], golden raisins [didn't have cherries] and peanut butter [doubled]. Also added a can of garbanzo beans, coarsely chopped [some whole beans remaining] for thickening purposes. Added to sauteed onions and let simmer for the stated 15 min. Placed the sauteed cauliflower florets and chicken thighs in a slow cooker, covered with sauce and set to low for 4 hours. Tossed in frozen peas 5 minutes before serving. Served with quinoa and naan. 2-yr old and 4-yr old both ate it. Husband loved it. Can't wait to devour the leftovers tonight.

This was a relatively quick and easy recipe. I added about a teaspoon of garam masala in addition to the spice mix I prepared according to the recipe, as I felt it lacked some flavor. It could be my spices are a bit old. I used 1/2 thighs and 1/2 breasts and added some leftover roasted eggplant and red pepper. Served it with chutney and basmati rice.

This is a great dish. I've made it twice in the last year. It keeps really well so is suitable to use for take-to-work-lunches for the week.

O Captain, my captain. This is one of my favorite casual epicurious recipes. It's delicious and also customizable. Like Nick from DC, I use brown tofu in lieu of chicken. I also throw in some chick peas sometimes. I've made it with toasted spices and with jarred and since the toasted isn't amazingly better, I save the time and use the prepared version. It makes a ton of food. Make it early in the week so you'll have a couple of lunches. Serve it over brown rice and you will not be hungry again for a minimum of 6 hours.

Took previous reviewers advice and used untoasted pre-ground spices and doubled the peanut butter. I used chunky peanut butter and really liked the texture variation. Wanted a vegetarian dish so subbed a large can of chickpeas for the chicken - quick, easy, delicious. My non-cauliflower-loving hubby enjoyed it too!

This recipe has become a regular for me. I do it a little differently each time, and often use my favorite prepared curry powder rather than the spice blend. But even with short cuts, it's always good. Tonight, the larder was pretty bare, because we've been traveling. I was thinking--What can I do with a head of cauliflower and a package of extra-firm tofu?-which was about all we had in the fridge. I thought of this recipe. Substituted the tofu--cut in cubes and browned in oil--for the chicken. Result was a quick, delicious vegetarian dish. And I didn't have to make a trip to the grocery!

I used all pre-ground spices and didn't toast them and it was still amazing.

I made this almost exactly as written. My few exceptions being that I used ground cumin (1/2 tsp) and ground cardamom (1/2 tsp) as well as about half turkey broth in place of chicken bouillion. I served it with some basmati rice and some fresh pappadums. This folks, will be a repeat performer. It's a wee bit time consuming to make, about 1&1/2 hours start to finish but well worth it, a yummy non hot Indian dish.

One of my new favorite recipes! Not difficult, and it tastes so rich and satisfying. I like to add a little bit of extra peanut butter- and I've been using crunchy which doesn't seem to make a difference. Don't skip the toasted coconut- it's one of the best parts.

Yummy! Per other review, made ahead and let sit in the fridge for two days, and the flavors of the spices really did "mature". Used dried cranberries in lieu of cherries. The toasting of the spices makes all the difference! Would add more cauliflower next time. Good dish for company (mine raved!) and nice because you can make ahead and then simply re-heat. Served over jasmine rice, per other reviewer's suggestion, and that proved to be a great pairing.

This one is a keeper. Toasting and grinding your own spices is definitely worth the few minutes' effort to do it. I was out of a few ingredients and so I made several substitutions: miso paste instead of peanut butter; currants instead of dried cherries; white wine & water instead of chicken broth; powdered ginger instead of fresh; 1 lb. chicken breast instead of 2 lbs thighs. It still worked great!

This is really good. Doubled the amount of peas. This is going to be a standard in my Indian kitchen.

Delicious! I used tenderized, diced chicken breast instead of chicken thighs, and dried cranberries instead of cherriese (just because I had them). For simplicity (and kid-friendliness), I did not add the coconut. I did not have every spice in "whole" form (cumin & cardamom), so I added them, in ground form. Still came out fabulous! I served it over Jasmine rice. I'll definitely make again!!

This was absolutely delicious. The toasting of spices really makes the dish, and the house was so fragrant. My guests really enjoyed this, too, both the aroma while it was cooking, and then the final product. You will really impress because although it seems kind of time consuming, it is still a one-pot dish with great flavor without being overpowering, and leftovers I bet will be even better. I served it over rice.

This was very good and the kids ate it up, cauliflower and all. The dried cherries got a little lost, and I think the peanut butter was more for thickening than flavor. Substituted cinnamon powder for the stick, added some raisins, sauteed sliced onion, and a bit more broth, but otherwise followed the recipe. (I went easy on the cayenne because of the kids). Leftovers were good too. Will definitely make again.

Make this on Saturday and eat on Sunday. Let me explain. I made this for my Sunday dinner and thought, "eh, it's okay, kinda tastes ho-hum". I put the leftovers in the fridge, thinking I'd use it some time for lunch. I gently reheated it for an emergency dinner a couple of days later and it tasted amazing. I had three servings, which I never do. I differed from the recipe by not adding coconut (not a fan), and reducing the cooking time for the cauliflower to keep it crunchy. Served over Israeli couscous which added some additional texture.

Wonderful dish! The spices were very delicious in combination with the little bit of peanut butter and sweet fruits (I substituted yellow raisins for dried cherries). Absolutely will make again, and I'm looking forward!

This is excellent! Picky husband loved it! The only modifications I made: dark chicken instead of breast, double cayenne and garlic, and added 1/4 cup of cream at the end to soften it up. Used shredded coconut, and it worked well. Served with rice.

This dish has great flavor. It is very time consuming and I suggest that the chicken, ginger, etc. be done the day before. It makes a lot so after two meals I decided to freeze the leftovers. It is well worth the time involved.

This recipe was really good. I didn't change a thing, except I couldn't find shaved coconut, so I left it out. I served it over jasmine thai rice and even my picky 10 year old liked it, in spite of the fact it included cauliflower.

My husband and I love the recipe; it was familiar to me from church picnics (neat history given by earlier reviewer). As written up here, a bit more time consuming than I prefer. But here are some modifications, including a brief time saver, that I used 2nd time around: Add a full head of cauliflower; do not worry about a "small" head. Used nearly a quart of organic chicken broth, substantially more than specified. Substitute ground cinnamon for stick. Time saver: Run cooled spices through mini-processor (cannot use cinnamon stick here) and wash out with small amount of broth.

I especially liked that this was a one pot dish. Next time I will omit the chicken and add extra vegetables. Great flavor, though I don't know that I'll process the spices next time...might just use powders. Left out the dried cherries. Makes a lot of food!

WOW! I'm glad everyone else enjoyed this dish as much as I did. I used fresh tumeric and ground cumin, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. I agree that the toasted spices really make the dish shine. As I was making it my roommate's boyfriend, who just traveled for 2 months in the middle east, walked in the house and said the smell instantly transported him back. This is definitely a keeper!

I love to cook but don't, by any means, consider myself a great cook. This recipe made me look like a chef! Incredibly easy and incredibly delicious My husband and I loved it. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

Loved it...company loved it. Didn't have cuminseed, but used ground cumin. Also used ground coriander. I do believe the toasting and grinding of the whole spices contributes to the amazing flavor. I thought the spice in this was perfect. I didn't find the cauliflower overdone at all as in previous reviews. Served over basmati rice cooked in chicken broth with chopped green scallions.

I'm joining the chorus on this one! Just loved it! Two slight changes - fresh turmeric instead of powdered (double the amount of powdered), and tahini in lieu of peanut butter. I had my doubts up until the time I dished it up - the sauce seemed to be lacking something, but I didn't know what. Maybe it was the toasted coconut, because when I put it over the quinoa, it all came together. Delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as specified and served it to guests who were wowed! I looked up other "Country Captain" recipes and saw some by Bobby Flay, Rachel Ray and Emeril that had bell peppers and onions and blond raisins and a different set of spices. I much preferred the sound of ingredients in this recipe and was not disappointed. I, too, cooked mine for less time to be sure the cauliflower didn't get mushy. I served it over brown Basmati rice with chopped cilantro added to it! YUM!

Delicious, and fun to make. I used 1/4 tsp. ground coriander instead of whole, and omitted the coconut, but thought the flavors blended well. Next time I'll up the cayenne for a little more heat

I thought this was fabulous. I followed this recipe as written with the exception of adding an extra 1/2 cup of chicken broth. A bit more labour intensive that I usually prefer, but easy all the same. This is a wonderfully mild curry that I will likely jazz up a bit in the future by adding some chilli. Unlike another reviewer, I actually found the peanut butter made quite a noticeable contribution overall and suggest using a good quality natural peanut butter. This is a keeper!

I have never had (or heard of) Country Captain so I can't compare it to other recipes. However, this was fabulous. I followed the recipe almost exactly...I used veg broth instead of chicken and omitted the coconut as I couldn't find any. Very easy, very satisfying.

I love this spice combination. It tastes like the definition of complex. I decided I wanted more of a soup since by the recipe, it was a bit thick, so I added probably six cups of chicken broth or maybe a little more. I also used chunky peanut butter because it's what I had, and I'm thinking about simmering in some actual raw peanuts or maybe cashews next time. And I used dried blueberries since I discovered at the last minute I didn't have cherries, which worked well, too. The sweetness adds something with the spice, and I'm thinking raisins would work well too, though would like to actually try the cherries next time around. This is a keeper.

I'll not give it any stars, because although I've made this very old recipe many times, and have fiddled with it a lot, I haven't tried this particular version. To A Cook from Novato CA, here's something on it from a food history site, which adds to its charm: "This delicious dish, known throughout Georgia, dates to the early 1800s. It is thought that this dish was brought to Georgia by a British sea captain who had been stationed in Bengali, India and shared the recipe with some friends in the port city of Savannah, Georgia. Savannah was then a major shipping port for the spice trade. The dish was named for the officers in India called Country Captains.

Very tasty and easy to make... no idea what the peanut butter and cherries do, but the whole dish was a lovely combination of flavors. Added roughly 1/2c more stock toward the end as the sauce does tighten up as it reduces. Didn't need the whole cooking time... only simmered tomatoes for 10 minutes and halved the rest of the time suggestions.

Wow. Super good! The prep time was a bit lenghty (to me) but more than worth it. Because I was pressed for time I used a pre-mixed red curry in my version. So delicious! Now, how about thinking up a better name? "Country Captain" sounds so provincial but maybe that's its charm.

I had never heard of this dish before so I have no idea how it compares to its traditional form, but this version was very tasty. I followed the recipe as written. I had the spices on hand already, which simplified things. Prep was not difficult or terribly time-consuming.
