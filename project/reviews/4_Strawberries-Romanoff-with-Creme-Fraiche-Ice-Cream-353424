Absolutely postitively delicious!!!!!!!!!!!! I used sour cream first time....creme fraiche the second. Must better with creme fraiche. This was a smash. Ice cream is indeed like lemon cheesecake. This is a 10++.

I made this dessert for my friend's wedding shower and it was wonderful! I also made my own creme fraiche, like the other reviewer. I highly recommend this recipe!

Absolutely delicious. Esp. the ice cream. I tried making my own creme fraiche (google recipes it's astoundingly easy and while not reaally the real thing, it's delicious) which made it cheaper. Like eating lemon cheesecake ice cream. Looking forward to leftovers tonight, though I'll probably have to fight my kids for them.

I served this to my gourmet group and got rave reviews. It was absolutely delicious. I added some almond cookies to the dish.
