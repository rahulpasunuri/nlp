Very delicious and a big hit at our family Christmas gathering. I used Idaho's instead of Russets and it was still very good. Several have requested the recipe.

I used unpeeled, cubed red potatoes (much easier) and doubled the bacon. I also used a combination of smoked gouda and havarti. Prepared it early in the day and then baked it just before dinner. It was fabulous with grilled steak.

We did not use smoked gouda, just regular. I'd like to see how much difference it would make. As it was, it was absolutely fantastic. Perfect comfort food.

I am curious as to whether everyone used scallions (green onions). I am unfamiliar with them. This recipe sounds fabulous and I do not want to use a regular onion if the scallions are the way to go. Also, did everyone just use the Gouda?

This was fabulous, I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the bacon and scallions. Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit, although the smoky taste of the gouda can be overpowering, next time I might halve it with havarti on someone else's suggestion.

I made this for a family gathering and now this is my "dish" any time my family has a special meal. Luckily, it is very easy to make, delicious. Unfortunately, I don't get to bring home leftovers. In fact, I'm making it for our family Easter dinner - yum.

A great and easy mashed potato dish. Felt like eating the inside of a good baked potato with all the toppings.

I made this recipe for a party, and the good news is that it received rave reviews from everyone. Bad news is none of it was left over to bring back home! I got multiple requests to send out the recipe in time for Thanksgiving--seriously, there were people who wouldn't leave until I wrote it down. My only change was to add more bacon and onions, since doubling the original amount didn't yield enough to sprinkle any on the top after baking. There is no question I will be making this time and time again.

Holy cow, this is great! We used half regular gouda and half smoked as all smoked can have a strong flavor. The whole pan was gone between five of us. Absolutely fantastic! This is a keeper.

Excellent dish - did not change anything except I halved it and even then the mix of ingredients was perfect.

To begin with, this is an award winning casserole. We have titled it 'Gooda Gouda'. It won us 1st price and a trophy at a casserole contest. Out of 25 we baked our way to the top!!! Not only is it a real winner, it is simple and afordable and can be made at a drop of a hat. One recommendation: don't get bacon shy.

The best potato casserole I've ever made!! I'm not much of a smoked cheese fan but thought I'd go with it and I'm glad I did. One thing that stands out - 6 strips of cooked and crumbled thick bacon and 3 large green onions (scallions) did not amount to over a cup!! I reduced the recipe using 2 pounds of potatoes but still used 3 larger green onions (they are never huge)and 5 strips of bacon and it came to about 1/3 to 1/2 cup. I don't know what I missed on that. Didn't matter the result was fabulous. Make sure your potatoes are real creamy before adding the other ingredients and baking.

This seemed like WAY too much onion for me. Did I do something incorrectly? Because my 3 green onions ended up being almost the same volume as the potatoes. I took the bacon pieces out of the mixture and only used some of the onion. I didn't have any problems with dryness though.

I made these for Easter and last night when I talked to my dad about Christmas dinner he asked if we were having these potatoes again. Naturally I had to come back to get the recipe. Here's a great hint - if you have any left over thin them with skim milk until they are soup consistency. Very yummy!

I used all of the suggested ingredients but had no time to chill the mixture. Instead, I put the casserole in the oven as soon as everything was mixed and baked it at 375 for 30 minutes. The mixture was not dry and was a hit!

This one was a bit of a smoke bomb for me - smoked bacon, smoked Gouda in the dish, smoked Gouda gratine', the entire 'fridge smells like a smokehouse. I haven't tried it yet but I think making this with plain Gouda would make a much better dish. Good applewood smoked bacon provides plenty smokiness. This is a case of too much of a good thing (smokiness) totally overriding a dish.

this is a great dish. i made made the potato mixture in the morning and cooked it about 6 hours later. it was great, very moist and savory. leftovers warm up nicely in the microwave. i think this is my boyfriend's favorite dish i make.

These are the best cheesy mashed potatoes I have ever eaten and were a huge success with our family - my mother-in-law declared them the "ultimate comfort food". I used whole fat Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, regular gouda because I had it on hand, and threw in some extra onions. I mixed all of the cheese, bacon, and onions in with the potatoes since our oven tends to burn the tops of things. They were PERFECT. I had made a pork loin to go with them but after one bite of the potatoes we put the pork in the fridge for another meal - we didn't want anything to distract from the experience of these potatoes. This was easy, with a wonderful blend of flavors, and not too heavy (as far as cheese-potatoes go).

I used skim milk instead of whole, and I used low- fat sour cream. I added a lot more bacon and I skipped the green onion. It was the best recipe for potatoes I have ever tasted. I also added a little minced garlic. It was amazing. Everyone loved and the smoked gouda was amazing. Definitely making this again!!

I prepared half the recipe a few hours ahead and parked it in the fridge. It baked off in 40 minutes with no bubbling and no cheese melting on top. Very dry. There are better recipes.

Very easy to make. Did this slightly ahead of time & then traveled to a friend's -- the dish travels well. Absolutely need to double the bacon & green onion.

So delicious and easy to make. Very hearty potatoes, goes great with roasted chicken or steak!

I followed Bethlehem's suggestions except made half a recipe. The havarti-gouda combo was really good! Wasn't dry -- I was a tad more generous with the milk/sour cream. Made it with chicken but would be good with anything. Husband wants it again!

I followed the recipe fairly closely, except that I used a combination of aged gouda and smoked havarti that was kick-ass! I also used 3 extra green onions and 2 extra slices of applewood bacon. Additionally, I used heavy cream instead of whole milk, (why not add some extra deliciousness?)and salted and peppered GENEROUSLY. It wasn't one bit dry like other reviewers said. And it was a fabulous and well worth-it way to blow my diet, served along with juicy grilled rib- eye steaks!

I halved the recipe and I thought it was terrific! I certainly did not have any problems with it being dry and I used low-fat sour cream.

This turned out a little dry. I'm eager to hear if others experienced the same result. I'd like to use it for a dinner party.
