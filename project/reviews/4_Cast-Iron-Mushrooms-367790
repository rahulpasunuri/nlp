Really good, a richer and deeper flavor than sauteed mushrooms and less hands'-on. I used 1 1/2 lbs of a combination of button, portabello and shitake mushrooms. I cooked for an additional 10 minutes, there was a lot of liquid released, probably because I added the salt and pepper in the beginning. I added the garlic with the shallots because I didn't want a raw garlic taste, the garlic didn't burn and it worked well. Make sure not to take them out until they start sizzling around the edges of the pan.

Yum. I loved that this was so good and used so little fat. I heated my cast iron skillet for about 20 minutes - it was starting to smoke. I used shiitakes, creminis, and white mushrooms, one large shallot, etc. It's a great way to cook mushrooms and frees up the stove top.

This was a huge hit! Never going to saute mushrooms again. Don't be afraid to fill the pan full. I was and they cooked down so much I could have used more...

Amazing. I will only cook mushrooms like this from now on. Used baby bellas and shiitake (for a pizza) and the flavor and texture were out of this world.

Very good. I think I will try to make the recipe using only Crimini, white button and baby portobello mushrooms. Only because I can buy those close to home but the asian market is a long drive to get the others.

Sometimes the best things in life are the simplest ones :). I love my cast iron skillet; I'll make this again.

Hardly a new recipe, a variant of one my parents taught me decades ago. I'm sure their parents taught them.

I haven't made this exactly as printed, but have been making my own version, sometimes with steak, not in the oven, for years, and it's delicious. Same cast-iron pan, a bit of oil, kosher salt in the pan on high, toss the steak on top of the salt and wait until the steak releases from the pan before turning it, and finishing up over a slightly lower flame. After you turn the steak, add any mushroom pieces you have (including this year our own morels!) and other seasonings. The mushrooms generally need only one or two stirs after that. The steak juices flavor the mushrooms and vice- versa. I've used the same carefree method with just mushrooms, usually served over crusty bread with some soft cheese sprinkled on top. I usually season with tarragon, as neither of us like parsley.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly because I didn't have a cast-iron skillet or all the different types of mushrooms it called for. I basically just cooked some sliced crimini mushrooms with the butter and herbs over the stovetop, and it still turned out great!

These were extremely delicious! I had to substitute a little more of the other mushrooms since I couldn't find king oyster, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Simple but good. I might almost add a little more butter, but that is because I like butter.

I made this with assorted mushrooms but I thought it needed a few more minutes in the oven because the 'shrums gave off a lot of liquid and the pan was sort of tall to let boil off. But the result wonderful. Very low maintenance since you don't have to pay attention to the dish unlike sautéing mushrooms. It was wonderful. I am making it again to go with the Christmas beef tenderloin.
