My sister recently served this during breakfast and I liked it enough to add more to my eggs and ask for the recipe. I'll definitely be making a batch to keep in the fridge. It IS very hot and it will light you up, but it's very tasty, too. I suggest serving another milder hot sauce along with it to add a little more depth, but with a few tweaks, this could be a real winner.

This stuff was nasty. I love hot and spicy food, but this stuff is hotter than heck! My husband spent two years with Hmong refugees and loves hot food, even he couldn't eat this sauce. It is not only spicy, but it has a nasty bitter taste that wouldn't be good even if it wasn't so spicy.

I like spicy food, but this is spicier than any hot sauce you can buy. It tastes very good for about 2 seconds but than the burn sets in. Be careful and make sure you have some ice cream ready to tame the heat...

Far, far, far too hot to really enjoy the flavor but it was fun to watch my hulking varsity football player eat a spoonful and try to maintain his "nothing is too tough for me" demeanor.

I was really looking forward to this salsa. I frequently work with Habaneros and dry them to grind to pepper flake. I followed the recipe exactly as presented. I tasted along with my boyfriend and it was inedible, I had to throw it out. I thought perhaps I could salvage it by adding tomatoes and turning into a very spicy salsa but I didn't even try. My mouth and taste buds were shot after this. I did go back and review the recipe and I wonder if removing the seeds from the peppers would have produced a better result. Unfortunately, I don't want to try again.

I was looking forward to this, I frequently cook with Habaneros and dry/crush them into flake. This was inedible. I followed recipe exactly and tasted and it was awful. After reviewing the recipe again after preparing, I'm curious to know if removing the seeds would yield a better result, however I have no interest in trying again.

If I could give this "zero" forks, I would. Followed the recipe exactly and was looking forward to a spicy, but flavorful accompaniment to chicken tacos. But it was spicy to the point of being inedible. I am certainly used to high heat in many of the foods I eat, but my boyfriend and I were both reduced to coughing fits when we tried just a small taste. Very disappointing.
