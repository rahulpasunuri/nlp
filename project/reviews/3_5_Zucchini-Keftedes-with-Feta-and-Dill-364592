Given the ingredients, I thought we'd love these. They came out beautifully, but were underwhelming.

This were again well received for our Greek Easter feast menu. Did use an egg wash before frying to help the rounds bind together. Absolutely delicious with a dash of yogurt/dill on top. B.J. Harrick

I added an extra egg, because one didn't seem to bind the mixture at all, but I still had trouble keeping the patties together while frying. Not sure why. Maybe more Panko would help also. I thought the delicate flavor might improve with baking as some here have suggested. A nice recipe but I have to work on it.

These fritters were absolutely delightful and loved by all the carnivores in our home. I followed the recipie as written, and the blend of fresh herbs with the cheese and zucchini was an explosion of flavor on the palate. Serve fresh out of the pan so the cool yogurt can melt on top of the crisp, browned crust. Yum!

I have made this several times as an appy and my guests loved it. The first time I made it I did not have Greek yogurt on hand but did have Tzatziki which I used in place and topped off with a sliver of lox and fresh dill weed. Next time I will try and cook it in the oven as frying them in the pan is tedious and uses up a lot of oil.

Made this recipe a few times. Put in 4-5 cloves garlic and the whole grated lemon peel. Used 3 eggs, about 1/2 cup panko. Instead of frying, I lined a sheet pan with foil and sprayed with Pam then put the formed patties on the pan, sprayed with a little olive oil and added some lemon pepper. Baked at 375 for about 45 minutes. Delicious and easier than frying - plus healthier.

These are a family favourite for our Greek night! I just add a bit of extra salt to the mix and half a lemon's juice.

These keftedes were great appetizers, and despite the active/total time, where very simple to make. First of all, I shredded the zucchini on a dish towel rather than paper towels, and after letting it sit, folded it up like a package and wringed it out THOROUGHLY over the sink. There's a lot more water than it seems. I substituted dried herbs for fresh ones, just 1 tsp for each tbsp, and that worked great. Definitely respect the feta limit. I am so glad I didn't add more. The only problem I had was with frying, as they tended to crumble, but they still turned out amazing in the end. If using one egg, make sure the side is thoroughly fried before flipping it, as premature flipping will cause it to break apart. And those tiny dabs of Greek yogurt turned this dish from excellent into drop dead amazing. Just three little dots or so on each was all it needed.

Very easy to make and very delicious. They are light and tasty and make a nice accompaniment to many main dishes, especially fish!

For me this was not very flavorful despite the herbs, garlic, feta. It was just ok. I felt that for the amount of work, shredding, chopping and frying this was a tremendous disappointment. I did not serve it to the guests. It did smell great but was not something I was proud to serve. Sorry.

Best zucchini recipe ever ~ absolutely delicious! I've tried other zucchini patty recipes in the past and they pale in comparison. We pretty much followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding an extra egg as per previous reviewers and had no problems with the keftedes crumbling. We also used half feta cheese and half queso fresco which added a nice creaminess. This is one recipe we'll be making often!

I had a huge zucchini that a neighbor gave me and decided to make these with it. The only thing I changed was using parmesan cheese instead of feta. I topped them with marinara sauce and served them as a meatless meal. My son had no idea what they were but loved them. The leftovers were just as good the next day for lunch.

It felt like some of them weren't cooked enough; perhaps the flatter the patties the better. I also added more panko and egg because it was clear that the patties were too moist to hold together in the oil, as some of the other reviewers mentioned. Overall, I give it a 3/4. With a little tweaking, the recipe could be a 4. My boyfriend liked them, though, and he's picky.

This recipe is fantastically good. Make this dish! It didn't take as long as it says. The combination of flavors is so fresh it tastes like there is so much more in it. I made my own bread crumbs, used 2 eggs, fried in olive oil, and I didn't have the mint, but I can only imagine that other component of flavor.

These looked so sexy in the photo, I immediately wanted to make them. A bit more preparation than I bargained for - chopping herbs,zesting and grating - but so worthwhile in the end. These were absolutely delicious! They're even great cold.

I used more feta than called for, and they fell apart while frying. Next time, I'll respect the limit on the feta and try the extra egg Doris suggested. I will be making them again; I put them out as a first course at Easter, and they were a big hit, even if they totally fell apart.

Oops, wish I had read the review from Doris before I prepared these for yesterday's Greek Easter feast. Grating the zucchini in the food processor was a breeze. However, the first batch didn't hold up well when I began frying them so I added an egg wash to the others and they turned out fine. Next time will use 2 eggs to bind the shredded zucchini patties together more firmly. Our guests raved about these! B.J. Harrick

Very tasty treats! I added a hint of cumin and nutmeg to mine and they were great. I had a slight problem with the zucchini on the paper towels. It made more of a mess than necessary. Instead, next time I would let them sit in a colander and squeeze the gratings very well.

We make this often. You can use your food processor with a grating disc. But zukes are soft enought that I just use a handheld Salad Shooter to makes quick work of the grating. My husband loves it!

Coming from a Greek, these were fantastic. I did find that they could benefit from one more egg to help hold them together and fried per the recipe. Had some tzatziki on hand so used that on the side. Can't wait to eat the leftovers. Are also delicious chilled or room temp -- I see great picnic potential here.

These were delicious. I served them as a side dish with some simple marinated grilled chicken. I skipped the frying, opted for non stick spray and had no issues.

Huge hit. Made these without any alterations (except that I didn't have any mint on hand), and they were delicious. Dipping them into the dilly yogurt was a joy. As with most things that I fry, I try to do it in as little oil as possible, and then I blot them as much as possible. Awesome vegetarian, low-cal treat, for sure. That, and grating zucchini is so much fun.
