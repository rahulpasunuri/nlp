The turkey was beautiful and had a good taste. I thought the stuffing was okay, my family disliked it and begged me to make traditional stuffing next time.

We made the entire meal from Gourmet magazine in 2002. Loved every bite! We are having guests for Thanksgiving this year and will make it again. Anyone have a suggestion on a good wine pairing for this meal?

This was an exceptional recipe IMO. The bird was picture perfect and the stuffing is a new addiction to a number of my guests. I did not feel the plum preserves in the gravy made it too sweet given the proportions (1/4 c. jam to 1 qt. of stock/wine). This will be a classic in our household for years to come!

We loved the turkey, but hated the stuffing. The following year I replaced this stuffing with one of my own (basically, a traditional stuffing where the American herbs are replaced with a bit of five spice powder and some reconstituted and chopped chinese mushrooms). Now we love it. The bird is beautiful and easy. Note: I suspect that the reviewers who complained of a jam-like taste didn't have a fine enough strainer.

Tasty and beautiful bird! I also leave the plum jelly out of the gravy, too sweet. The turkey is so flavorful. Everyone loves it and ask for it for Thanksgiving. The stuffing is fabulous! I've done it in the scooped out onions which is a lot of work, but an awesome presentation. The stuffing is just as good baked, less work and still looks great too.

We have been making this turkey every year since its been published in Gourmet. It is delicious, beautiful, not too difficult to make... we make it with chestnut stuffing, and dream about it for the rest of the year.

Wow! this was the most stunning turkey I have ever made. Mouthwateringly juicy, tasty - different. the stuffing is sublime. I accidentally glazed the turkey when I first put it in so had to reglaze half way through. Didn't hurt it one bit. Really sensational.

I wish Epicurious had an option for "I'd think about making it again" because this wasn't bad...and I'd probably make it again but not the way the recipe states. Pros: The glaze is great. This was the best looking, best tasting skin I've ever had on a turkey. Bar none. Keep a close eye on it for the last hour. The glaze can burn. Cons: If I ever make it again I'll definitely leave the jam out of the gravy. WAY too sweet, more like syrup than gravy.

I prepare Thanksgiving dinner for a large family gathering each year. Included in this group are several professional chefs with over 120 years of experience both in the US and Europe. I always do two turkeys, a traditional New England perparation and one other. Since this recipe first appeared in Gourmet, this has been the second preparation. The stuffing has to be the finest we have ever tasted, and the plum glaze, just perfect!

The link 'stuffed onions' next to the '5 to 7 cups spinach, bacon, and cashew stuffing' has the stuffing recipe.

I made this for my 2003 Thanksgiving dinner. I had about 20 people total. This Turkey was total hit. The combination of Glaze, Brine, Stuffing and PLUM GRAVEY make this dish a must try. I will make it again this year. I had the recipe laminated and is now part of my perm. collection.

This was the first turkey I ever prepared for Thanksgiving, and it turned out beyond expectation. I brined the turkey for 24 hours, used a Brownberry nut bread for the stuffing (I don't see the stuffing recipe on the site, but it's great), made the glaze with red currant jelly, and used an electronic thermometer to gauge the temperature of the turkey. The turkey was perfect - juicy, well brined, and beautiful. The stuffing was complex and flavorful, with the bacon and the nut bread providing richness,depth, and luxury. I made this dish later that year for Christmas dinner, and it turned out deliciously the same. I highly recommend that you prepare this recipe as the center dish for your next special event, as it is too good to be solely reserved for one holiday.

As I was making out the grocery list for the turkey and stuffing, I suddenly remembered seeing a few jars of my grandmother's heavenly plum preserves in the pantry. I decided to use those instead. Once it came time to add the plum jam to the glaze, I opened the jars to find . . . grape?? What the heck? Homemade grape jam. (I found out later my sister had brought by some jars of her mother-in-law's preserves.) No time to go to the store, so I made the recipe with grape jelly, and it was really good. You should try it too. Easily the best gravy I ever had, even with grape instead of plum. The sweetness complemented the mild meat well. And the stuffing, as most have said, was outstanding.

We hosted Thanksgiving dinner last year for the first time and I decided to try this recipe for my first turkey ever! We brined the turkey overnight in kosher salt, used the chinese 5 start spice and the plum jam. It was excellent. In fact we made the entire gourmet recipe for the meal including the soup, herb infused mashed potatos and butternut squash and green beans. Our guests are requesting more of the same for Christmas dinner this year!

The turkey was absolute perfection, very juicy and flavorful. I did have to assemble the Chinese 5-spice from scratch since the store was sold out. I was so happy with the outcome that I will do this again. I covered the turkey after the first 30 minutes because it was browning too quickly. The glaze gave the turkey the most amazing color. Be sure to make the gravy even if you normally do not---it was the best I ever had. My company and I also enjoyed the accompanying stuffing and left very little. However, my daughters and husband were a bit disappointed so next time I will pass on the stuffing. I will make the Turkey again for Christmas and I think I will try the glaze on a roast chicken or a pork loin.

My partner and I made this recipe for Thanksgiving for our families and were very impressed with the results. Though we did not brine the turkey we still ended up with a moist and flavorful turkey. We ran out of time so didn't get to make the gravy as directed; his grandmother, however, turned the existing pan juices into a tasty and savory gravy on its own. Well worth the time and effort for an elegant and sophisticated take on a traditional recipe. P.S. The stuffing is to DIE for, either with the recipe or without. Really -- it's that good!

I brined the turkey, which was worth doing. I used the damson plum, but was not that impressed with the flavor--the appearance, however, was beautiful. I would, possibly, use the glaze again. I was not a fan of the plum gravy because of, I think, its sweetness or the stuffing. Others liked it though. Needless to say, I did not keep the leftovers and would probably not make this again.

I couldn't find a kosher turkey big enough so I brined my 24lb. bird. Delicious and beautiful!I also couldn't find the plum so used the currant jelly.Doubled the glaze...and that stuffing!!!! There were 20 of us in all with not many left overs!! Great Thanksgiving had by all!!!

This recipe was AMAZING! Made it with currant jelly since I couldn't find plum and still good. Guests were raving the entire night. People who did not usually enjoy turkey even loved it. Time consuming, but well worth it.

I probably would have given this four forks if I really LIKED turkey, but I've never been a huge fan. That said, we hosted thanksgiving this year and had to cook a turkey, and everyone loved it. We let our bird soak in brine overnight and that made a big difference. The gravy is delicious. The stuffing is also excellent, and I would emphasize the importance of using really good quality bread.

Although the instructions in this recipe could use some editing for clarity, the results are simply fabulous. I'd recommend also purchasing a few fresh plums (or cranberries), saving a couple handfuls of the baby spinach and saving some whole cashews for decorating the turkey platter after cooking. I've never received the number of compliments for a dish as I did for this one....

I made this for recipe for a gathering, at my home, of 26 people. There were 4 generations at the many tables. Everyone loved it. They fought over doing the dishes; they wanted to pick at the leftovers in the kitchen. I'm making dinner again this year for an intimate group of 10. I will attempt to recreate the magic. Mmmmmmmm

I used this recipe last Thanksgiving and it was the best turkey I have ever had. The whole crowd loved it. The salty sweetness was fabulous. My family usually makes a different meal each year for Thanksgiving, but I have been looking forward to this week since the same time last year so I can make it again! Well, well worth the effort if you enjoy cooking.

My son saw this recipe on the cover of the magazine and asked if I would make it for Thanksgiving...I was skeptical but I did it anyway...IT WAS AWESOME! So good that it is the recipe we are using again this year...The turkey was delicious and the gravy was delightfully flavored by the plum jam in the pan juices of the turkey. Bravo!

If you want your guests to talk about your Thanksgiving Dinner, make this Turkey. Absolutely FABULOUS!!! I made it last year for the first time and througout the year, my son couldn't stop thinking about the turkey and stuffing. I was asked to make it again this year! Fine with me...I love to be praised for my wonderful turkey!!!

I have never, ever in my life had something so perfect and delicious in all of the Thanksgivings in my memory. It was the quintessentially perfect Turkey both visually and in taste, and the stuffing was so revealing and surprising and different -- the garlic giving it a real kick against the plum -- and the raves were endless. This is my permanent turkey. And worth every moment of tending.

I was hosting an early Thanksgiving dinner for 6 people, and a turkey seemed like too much bird. Since goose (Martini Gansl) is a November tradition in Austria, I made this recipe with goose. It was delicious, but leftovers were even better. I served it with the kumquat-cranberry compote (Gourmet Thanksgiving menu 2002) and roasted Hokkaido pumpkin. WONDERFUL!

A lot of work but absolutely fabulous...I went for seconds on the stuffing and it was all gone. I did not brine the turkey as it seemed too much work, that didn't hurt the recipe at all. What made this a little easier was making the stock the day before and the stuffing early in the morning.

I made this last night for a dinner party and everyone loved it. The flavor of the glaze really permeates the whole bird and the gravy is delicious. Didn't change anything.

This recipe came out so well...and to anyone who said it was bland..how so?? It was completely flavorful, hearty meal, esp. with the stuffing. It was delectable by all standards. Even to my very picky brother-in-law! So I know for sure it was a hit..he ate 3rds! Hurrah!

I made the turkey with no stuffing for a Thanksgiving buffet and it was the only turkey at the buffet eaten down to the bones. (I was hoping to take a few leftovers home.) I used a German plum marmalade.

This was a big hit. Especially the stuffing. I couldn't find plum jam for the glaze so I used the red current, and it worked just fine. Smelled a bit like a duck from a Chinese restaurant -- next time I think I will substitute allspice.

I made this turkey and stuffing for an Italian thanksgiving, everyone simply loved it! They have all been asking for translated recipes, I would surely make it again!

The glaze created a picture perfect turkey. I just tented the bird as soon as it turned the hue I desired. But it was all looks and little substance. The flavor of the glaze on the bird (made exactly to the recommended specs) was disappointing to this cook. I'm no big fan of blow-your-doors-off spicy food, but this bird needed some heat -- at least an undertone. Maybe one or two hot dried Asian peppers added to then retrieved from the sauce during the initial cooking would do the trick.

This was an awesome turkey recipe and I would definitely make it again. It doesn't come easy, though: I basted that bird every 20 minutes and cooked it slowly (325 degrees) before adding the glaze to ensure it remained tender and juicy. I was a little concerned about the flavor getting all the way through the turkey, but the glaze penetrated the bird beautifully. The color was outstanding and my Thanksgiving guests commented extensively on the turkey's lovely gold brown hue. In fact, I'm planning to try the glaze on chicken, cornish hens, and turkey breast in the future. The gravy totally rocks. I "cheated" and bought turkey giblet stock from Williams-Sonoma because I couldn't be bothered making stock from scratch. For the stuffing, I substituted turkey bacon since I don't eat pork, and I prepared a vegetarian version for my husband and another guest and they both turned out great. It's a nice alternative to traditional cornbread stuffings, for sure.

This was absolutely the best turkey I've ever eaten or prepared. I did go to the trouble (not such a big deal) of brining the turkey the night before. The turkey was incredibly succulent and flavorful. The stuffing was unusual and delicious, and the gravy awesome! I may be convinced to make the same turkey recipe each year, after finding this recipe. Heidi Mayer Park Ridge, IL
