As noted by other cooks, this recipe is bland as written. This not one to make more than an hour ahead, since the cabbage gets mushy.

As mentioned by the other reviewers, this is a little bland on its own. However, if you add a handful of toasted walnuts, and some raisins soaked in the red wine vinegar, it is quite tasty.

I made it the first time per directions (you really shouldnt rate untill you follow directions)It was good and easy, but not great. When I made it the second time I added some celery seed and some onions. Was much better.

Not enough taste. Just a cabbage salad. If I try it again, I would double the dressing.

A wonderful foible to the Chinese Five-Spice Shredded Pork "hoagies" we are having along with it! Very subtle flavors and the sweetness of the cabbage and carrots are not ruined by alot of heavy, spicy sauce. Perfect for this Super Bowl party I am having down here in sunny Tampa! KIMBER
