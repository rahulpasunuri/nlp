While Linzer cookies always "take a bit of doing," this dough was extremely difficult to work with - I had to put it on a cookie sheet in the freezer and then frantically cut out about 4 shapes before it was too warm to hold together. I much prefer the Gourmet recipe on this same site. Also, shortcutting with hazelnut flour (expensive but worth it) is much easier than trying to get the skins off hazelnuts without burning yourself. If you do toast them yourself, don't bother trying to get ALL the skins off - it'll never happen.

Not worth the effort!
