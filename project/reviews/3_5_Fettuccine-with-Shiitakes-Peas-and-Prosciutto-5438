Not a bad recipe, but made many others that were more tasty. I'll move on....

I won't rate this because I substituted quite a bit, but this was my base and it was quite tasty. I subbed olive oil for half the butter, added half a cup of chicken stock (should please the 'not enough sauce' people), one clove of minced garlic, and used half and half instead of cream. I had brocolli and snow peas as the veg, and excluded the proscuitto because I didn't have any. Had bowtie pasta on hand, and added about half a cup of freshly grated parmesan at the end, which gave it a nice bite. The chicken stock and parm added depth of flavor, which I think would solve some of the problems other reviewers had.

Tasty, simple, with a few changes based on what was on hand. Used fresh, native peas, 2 lbs mixed shrooms (crimini & button), and subbed pancetta for prosciutto (sauteed w/ shallots and 2 cloves minced garlic), dry sherry instead of white wine. Didn't use whipping cream either served with fresh Parm-Reggiano instead.

This is probably the 4th time I've made this. It always comes out well. Quick and easy, at least if you're using frozen peas! I've used other pastas -- last night a mafalda, but my favorite was called riccia (i think -- it was back in 98!). It was expensive, but the BEST!

Very bland - a waste of shelling peas for 45 minutes.

This dish was so light and tasty. I used it for a party at my home and used regular mushrooms instead of shitakes as they can get expensive, and it was still delicious!

Delicious is really close to "beyond compare." As did other reviewers, I substituted a little, omitting the green onions, using dried porcini mushrooms and the water. No fat "cream" now available is a guilt- free substitute. The prosciutto and peas only need be heated, not cooked. One of the very best recipes I have ever tried!

I took a few liberties, but the results were spectacular for a mid-week (45 minutes or less) kind of dish. Used crimini mushrooms, and egg fettuccinne. Used 1 clove garlic, ommitted the peas (hubby doesn't like 'em), and was quite generous with the parsely. I also added more cream and a bit of water to further the sauce, which I agree, was on the skimpy side. At any rate, it was Fantastic, with a capital F.

Delicious pasta dish. Don't make the sauce ahead, as I tried to--it dries out quickly because so little liquid is used. Next time I will add a little more butter, more wine, and more cream.

Don't cook too much pasta on this, use less if anything. We added garlic and it was appreciated. Fresh peas would have been better as well. Great dish!

I didn't stick too close to the recipe, using crimini mushrooms, Pernod instead of wine, and I added in a large tblsp of pesto into the sauce. THe results were spectacular. The Pernod-pesto combination rounded out the flavors, complimented the proscuitto wonderfully.

Beyond compare? Not much is, hence the three forks. BUT... the first dish I ever found via this service and possibly the best. It tasted even better fried up in a little olive oil the next day.
