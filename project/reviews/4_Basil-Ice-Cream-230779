While I thought this was interesting, it just wasn't something I wanted to grab from the freezer and eat. A couple of spoonfulls was enough.

So, maybe it's my tendency to overcook everything, and maybe a defective thermometer, but I ended up with a pot full of scrambled basil eggs when my thermometer read 160 degrees. So beware the temp and potential for overcooking!

Divine. I have a two-quart ice cream maker, and tripling this recipe fit inside the freezer bowl perfectly.

This was very good! Everyone enjoyed it. I spread a thin amount of dark chocolate ganache between layers of the ice cream before freezing.

Yes, with the right mindset it does taste somewhat like marijuana, but that's okay. This is an excellent ice cream! It has a beautiful pistachio green color and a lot of delicious, creamy flavor without being overly sweet.

this is not only a dessert. I was just in lisbon: new spin on caprese salad served with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.

This ice cream is great with fresh berries. If you reduce any zinfindel until you havve about one cup and then sweeten with honey. Only add about a spoonful on the berries and then the ice cream. If you have lavender blossoms, you can add this to the honey. This is a great combination.....

Funny thing about this ice cream: a few of my guests and I agreed that it tasted like marijuana! Added two teaspoons of good vanilla extract, as wanted it for a nice unique pairing with chocolate cake. Very creamy, great texture. As someone else commented here, it doesn't make much; the full recipe made enough for seven guests to each have one smallish scoop.

Delicious. I discovered the recipe last week and have already made it twice. Who would have though basil could be so good in ice cream!

Yum... I used lemon basil right out of the garden and milk and eggs from our own cows and chickens, which I think really makes a difference. I would maybe cut down on the sugar a bit and add some more basil, I thought that it was a bit sweet and could have had a slightly stronger basil flavor.

bravo. I added some dark chocolate with espresso bean shavings, not so much to over whelm the subtle basil flavor. awsome.

I've made this twice in the last week, first with regular bail, then with thai basil. Delicious, different, nice paired with the mango coconut ice cream on this site.

Wonderful, definitely a hit. Served with honey rosemary ice cream as well.

I had just gotten back from Argentina where I loved the basil daiquiris. Since I couldn't find a recipe for that I tried this instead. I called it Surprise Ice Cream so everyone would try it without prejudice. It was a hit! I Keep getting asked when I'm making it next.

This ice cream was surprisingly good as I had this notion of the final product being not as sweet and would have a strong herb flavor. It has a good soothing effect when you first taste it.

Delicious and refreshing! I used significantly more basil than the recipe called for and ended up with excellent flavor.

Outstanding. Well worth the effort -- the taste is amazing. Serve with a garnish of thinly julliened candied ginger.

Outstanding! Tested this recipe tonight on dinner guests & all raved about it. As a result, I will be serving this at a special party next weekend. To get the basil finely ground in all that milk, I gave up on my blender & ended up using a sieve to get out all the chopped basil & putting it in a food processor, along with about 1/2 cup of the cooked milk, & just letting it run, then adding that back to the rest of the cooked milk. Thank you for this unusual recipe! Not something I can run to the grocery store to buy, which makes it even more special to make at home.

We loved this recipe and have made it many times this summer. We added toasted hazelnuts and dark chocolate which really made it incredible -- I am addicted to it!

Wonderful and perfect on a hot summer day. If you like this also try the lychee or rosemary icecream.

Made this to take to a barbecue - everyone was skeptical, but LOVED it! Served it with strawberries in balsamic vinegar - but the ice cream was best all by itself. It was very creamy for me, maybe the previous rater didn't churn it long enough?

I thought the ice cream had a strange texture. I was expecting it to be creamier, though to me it had a texture more similar to sorbet. I thought the flavor was really interesting though, very refreshing.

Fabulous! This is a rich, creamy ice cream. We used fresh basil just picked from the garden and will definitely make this recipe again.

pretty good - but excellent the next day along with some balsamic macerated peaches...the sweet vinegar is the perfect match for the basil flavor in the ice cream.

Hey, this recipe tasted pretty good. Not only will I make it again, I'm going to experiment with the spices used in Indian Thandai.

This was a nice way to end a splendid dinner of spicy Thai food. I'm looking forward to tweaking the recipe by using all types of other herbs in place of the basil.
