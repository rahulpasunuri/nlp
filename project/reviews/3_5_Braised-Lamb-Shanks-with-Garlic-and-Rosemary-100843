This was fantastically good for a valentines day dinner; paired it with a Shiraz, had the cardamom and lemon rice pudding on this site for desert. Similar to the other modifications here: I first browned the onions, garlic and lamb, doubled the wine, added more carrots and some canned tomatoes and a potato. Couldn't get enough lamb shank so I also had some leg in there, so there was a ton of meat at just 3 lbs instead of 6.

I made this for a dinner party, and my guests enjoyed it. I added lemon juice, potatoes, and extra carrots. Tripled the red wine & mustard (not the salt). I cooked it on high for 5 hours and left it on warm another 4 or so before I got home. The meat fell off the bones as I was ladling out the fat. Easy, tender and delicious... would definitely make again.

Good recipe, but a few modifications: Instead of whole cloves, chop garlic coarsely. In a frying pan or Dutch oven, pour a few tablespoons of olive oil and brown lamb shanks, onion, and garlic. Remove shanks from pan when browned and deglaze pan with red wine (more than what recipe calls for), adding mustard (grainy dijon) as well. In addition to vegetables shown, add some chopped fennel bulb if desired. Recipe could use more vegetables than what's called for. Also add 1 small can (about 15 oz) diced chopped tomatoes into the slow cooker (I prefer Muir Glen fire-roasted diced tomato). 6 hours on high is more than enough time. Could probably go 4 hours high, 2 hours low. Serve over couscous or polenta.

Great recipe, but I agree with previous comments that it needs more liquids: one full cup of wine, more stock, and half the meat. I would also brown the meat with the onions and garlic first. One more suggestion: a few whole peeled tomatoes, fresh or canned, would enhance the sauce. And definitely cooking this for 6 hours on high is plenty.

The only reason I didn't give this 4 stars is. like many other reviewers, i've altered the recipe by increasing the wine and decreasing the cooking time and browning the onion, garlic, and lamb first to get an ultimately amazing dish. so the recipe itself is 3 stars because it's off, but the dish itself approaches 4--lovely fall off the bone lamb, a beautiful gravy (i made 1/2 the meat but made the full gravy to ladle tomorrow over egg noodles ala stroganoff), and lovely vegetables. easy peasy too!

I make a lot of lamb and found this recipe to only be so-so. It is a little salty and one dimentional, rather than layers of flavor. But if you have never made shanks before and were looking for something really easy this would be a good starting point.

Dear lord of lamb, this was incredible. The meat is so velvety and rich, you need a bank account for it.

First, I cut the recipe in half to feed two people with big appetites. Then, as with most slow cooker recipes, I sauteed the onions and garlic to add depth of flavor. I then browned the shanks in the same pan. I did this the night before, placed everything in the slow cooker at 7AM - on high - left and came back at 1PM. I made garlic mashed potatoes and was serving by 2PM. Prepared in this manner it did not need all that cooking time. It was perfectly tender and delicious. I did not measure the wine, so I'm sure I added extra. The friend I shared this with absolutely loves lamb shanks and said these were the best he ever had.

Recipe has been overated. Would not make again. Only needed 4 hours on high. Let's save those "4's" for ONLY those recipes that are the BEST you have EVER eaten

I also browned the shanks and doubled the red wine to 1 cup as suggested and added baby carrots about 3 hours before serving. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and everyone loved it. Served it with risotto and green beans and baked apples for dessert. This was an easy, make ahead meal and a perfect choice if you don't have much time to spend in the kitchen before dinner.

I loved this recipe. At 6.99/# for lamb shanks, I decided to try the 2.99/# lamb stew meat with bone in. Maybe it's less expensive in the spring. I browned the meat and cooked the onion separately as well until the onion was slightly browned. I didn't have to crock-pot it as long either because of the smaller pieces of meat. I too added one cup of red wine and two cups of chicken broth. Served with mashed potatoes. Deelish!

I browned the lamb shank, then cooked it in the crock pot. 4 hours on high, then 10-12 hours on low. I added extra carrots and celery. I also added turnips, and a half head of garlic (skin included) Added much beef and chicken broth. (should have added more.) Cook overnight with 2 wet towels between the crock and the lid to keep in teh moisture and heat. Wonderful Xmas dinner!

I've been interested to see that people added MORE liquid to this recipe - I've made this dish a few times, followed it to the letter, and while it's always delicious it's very WET!! I've even thought of thickening some of the sauce with some cornstarch/water, or even adding a little tomato purée for color, and which also helps to thicken. Agree wholeheartedly with the other reviewers - it doesn't look very attractive, but, the flavor.... Anyone have any ideas, please?

This is absolutely the best Lamb Shank recipe Ive cooed and I done a few. I followed the recipe as is with the exception of the cooking juices. I removed all pieces of bone from the cooking juice pored them into a pot then used a hand blender until smooth. This process created the best gravy I have ever tasted then pored over the shanks. Thanks to the author. Kris

I inaugurated my slow cooker with this dish for Valentine's Day, and I'm so glad that I did -- it was excellent, and now I feel brave about more slow cooking experiments. Per other reviews, I doubled the red wine to one cup, and added 1 cup of low sodium organic chicken broth. I cooked the dish on high for 6 hours, and on low for only 4, adding baby carrots for only the last 2 hours of cooking; they were a perfect consistency -- not mushy at all.

Rating: 0
Glad I read the reviews before I started this recipe. I took the advice to: add the extra chicken stock; double up to 1 cup of red wine; sear the meat gently under the broiler first. I also omitted the salt as I was using stock powder. I would definitely make this again, it was delicious! Liz

Rating: 3
the other posters are right that the liquid amounts and cooking times are off here - but with some tweaking the flavours are delicious and this is a keeper. I used 4 shanks (total 3 pounds), salt and peppered them, and browned them in oil. I doubled the wine to 1 cup but didn't need more liquid than that. My shanks were falling off the bone after 4 hours on high heat. I served mine over polenta.

Agree with earlier reviewers that it's not very attractive to look at when it comes out of the slow cooker but it's tasty and tender. I made this twice, the second time w/2Tablespoons of coarse sea salt and it got better reviews that way so I'll probably make it that way from now on. Good for family but not for company, I think. Easy, too.

This recipe was great. I took some other users' advice and increased the red wine to 1 cup and added 2 cups of chicken stock as well. I cooked it on high for 6 hours and on low for 4 hours. The meat was falling off the bone tender. I would definitely make this again.

Great. Lamb was fall apart tender, veggies were perfect. I added some thyme, and used white wine instead of red (had no red). I think if I had used red wine it would have been even better. The drawback of this recipe, like all that come out of a slow cooker, was that it wasn't pretty.

To quickly and easily remove fat from juices there are a couple kitchen tools you can purchase. One is a cup that has a spout, it's like a measuring cup. The spout comes from the very bottom of the cup. Pour the juices in there and wait 2 minutes for the fat the separate to the top. Then when you pour the juices out the spout, the fat stays at the top. Simply stop pouring when the juices are gone and the fat gets down to the spout. I also have seen (but have never tried) these brushes you can buy which supposedly absorb fat and you keep skimming the brush over the top of the juices I suppose. This recipe is YUMMY.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and it was perfect. Not much to look at really, but then again I made it for an informal lunch so everyone just dug in as opposed to putting it on a nice serving platter. I didn't sear the shanks or add extra liquid (it does look like it's not enough) and it turned out great. So easy too. I had the cooker on high for 3 hours, then on low for about 12 hours, and it was perfect and falling off of the bone. Served it with a salad and a crusty baguette. My only complaint is that this dish kept me up all night because I could smell the delicious aromas as it cooked.

Rating: 3
Excellent! I also added double the amount of wine and ensured there was enough broth to cover the shanks. I cooked mine in the slow cooker on high for 2 hrs and then low for 5 1/2. The meat was so delicious and fell right off the bone. It sis very important to sear the shanks before adding to the slow cooker. I also added some pancentta for flavor. Definetly restaraunt quality!

I usually read all the reviews before cooking but this time it wouldn't have helped. Everyone loved it but me, I guess. It is the flavor I dislike, and I like lamb shanks, braised is good for me- just this recipe had a bitter edge that I didn't care for. The texture and tenderness were all fine, just that taste didn't live up to the wonderful aromas that were coming out of the cooker in the first 12 hrs. Maybe less time would have been better. I don't care for beef cooked with wine either, so that's probably the case- just not my thing.

Excellent! I have been making this recipe for years (I guess I forgot to rate this when I first tried it!!!) This is comfort food at its best! I would have no problems serving this to company. I make the recipe up the night before, plop them into the crock put and let them cook on low all day....they turn out perfect each time. I remove them to a cutting board....reove the fat and cut them into serving portions along with the wonderful braised veggies. In regards to the person who complained that her crock pot gave off the same smell....I found that happened to my first crockpot too. It is not the recipe.....it is the pot! This recipe is simple, easy to prepare and wonderful to serve. I would highly recommend this recipe

Yummmmmm! I loved this recipe. Definately sear the shanks first! I also suggest using more liquid. I used 1cup wine and 2 cups chicken stock. Don't skip the lemon zest or garlic. The zest adds a refreshing brightness to the braising juices and I left the garlic cloves whole in their skins which keeps them firm and doesn't overpower the dish with garlic flavor. Then spread the garlic on crusty bread! Served this dish with creamy bleu cheese polenta and a mixed spring greens salad. So Good!

First recipe made with my new (hand-me-down) slow cooker, and I loved it. I wouldn't expect my veggies to hold up under slow cooking -- they're just for flavor. I seared the meat before placing in the pot, cooked on high 2 hours and on low overnight. I served it with mixed greens and that was all I needed. The lamb was tender and nicely flavored by the wine, mustard and rosemary. And talk about easy!

Why don't I like ANYTHING that comes out of my slow-cooker? It doesn't matter what I seem to make it always always always has the same flavour. Whatever spices or seasonings I've added have dissipated by the time cooking is done. When all is finished the fat is impossible to separate from the contents just before serving. The carrots are mushy after 12 hours. From now on I use my slow cooker for Split Pea and Black Bean soups. Not meat (with the exception of Pulled Pork). I am never happy and this recipe was no exception. (maybe it's MY slow cooker)

This is the first slow cooker recipe that I have really liked. I did broil the lamb first (next time I think I will just sear them) which I think made them look even better. I also added a bit more wine and some chicken broth for more liquid. I only cooked two racks (2lbs) and when I cook more I will most likely double the liquid (adding also more wine and chicken broth). Also, I cooked them on high for 3 1/2 hours and then on low for 5 hours -- anymore and they would have been dry. The flavor is outstanding! Try it over some buttered egg noodles for the carb lovers. Enjoy!

I made this dish and it was delicious. Meat was falling off after 6 hours. I think the 12 hours is unnecessary. I will make it again, but with less time and a little more wine.

This was a delicious meal! Of course, the small town where I live didn't have the Lamb shanks, in fact, we don't even have a grocery store... so I used lamb chops I had in the freezer instead. Just as tasty, just a little more expensive!

Within the last year I re-discovered the enjoyment of slow cooking. Braising the meat makes a world of difference in taste. I do not use a slow cooker - the temps for slow cooking are : slow 180 degress. medium 200 degress. fast 225 degress. My Dutch oven may become attached to the inside of the oven. Great reciepe.

Lamb shanks and slow cookers are a great combination. I made this fairly close to the recipe but, only made 2 lamb shanks, didn't have fresh rosemary so used dried herbs du provence, used pearl onions and less garlic since I was only making 2 shanks. I browned the shanks and onions first as I only had 6 hours to cook. It did need more liquid (next time I will add more). In the end it looked very dry so I added about 1/2 (heaping) cup of reduced fat sour cream and just warmed a bit which worked out great! Served with quinoa was a big hit!

Rating: 4
Absolutely beautiful dish. Browned shanks before starting the slow cooking. Only included 1/2 of the garlic and omitted lemon. Added about twice the quantity of red wine. Made a thicker sauce by adding flour to the remaining juices after removing the shanks. Strained before serving.

I love this recipe, quick and delicious . My family who said they didnt like lamb all came back for second and even 3rds! I browned the shanks under the broiler and assembled the night before. I did omit the lemon peel and slightly reduced the garlic. The meat fell off the bone. What a great smell to walk into after work!!

I made this with only 2 shanks, and I added chicken stock and 2 fresh tomatoes. I didn't add as much zest also. I only cooked it for 6 hours on low and the meat fell off the bone, it was delicious, I will definately make this again. I served them with creamy mashed potatoes.

This recipe was amazing. I, too, browned the shanks and arranged everything in the crock pot the night before. I cooked the meat for about 8 hours on low heat and added mushrooms for the last 2 hours. I served the meat with a Caesar Salad and Polenta and it all turned out great.

This recipe did not work in my crockpot at all. I followed it almost exactly, except did all of the cooking on low, and it burned very badly, making a royal pain to clean up and tasting not bad. Nonetheless, I will try it again, significantly inreasing the liquid (and perhaps adding chicken stock). I can tell it has potential. But as others have said, perhaps too little liquid, especially if cooking the whole 12 hours.

After trying several slow-cooker recipes for lamb shanks, this is my favorite. I wouldn't bother buying an expensive cut for this dish. I reduced the quantity for my 3-qt cooker & took the suggestion of other reviewers and browned the meat under the broiler. Better flavor, better appearance, and a slightly shorter cooking time (but that may be due to my cooker). I cooked it overnight, then refrigerated, removed fat, and reheated. Served with rice, salad, and tangerines for dessert. Definitely a recipe I'll repeat regularly.

I made this dish without changing the recipe at all (except for the cooking time) and it was delicious! I set my crock pot on high for the first 4 hours and then cooked 6 more hours on low. I thought that 12 hours of cooking was going to be too much but it would have been fine. The meat falls off the bone and the flavor was great.

I feel like I missed something in this recipte. 1/2 cup of liguid for 12 hours of cooking? I re-read the instructions and all the reviews and no one mentioned this. I had to add wine. I love lamb and this this recipe has potential. Less mustard, less salt, more liquid -- wine cut with beef broth.

We like lamb, and loved this recipe. 4 forks: delicious, easy and best of all - it was ready to eat after work. My husband, the carnivore, proclaimed it the "best ever." We browned the shanks last night and assembled it all in the crockpot insert, so it was ready to plug in this a.m. Cooked 4 hours on low, added mushrooms, and let it cook 2 more hours on low, and it was perfect. Our kids, 5 & 8, had seconds and thirds. I thickened the gravy - which was rich and flavorful - w/ a bit of cornstarch. Next time, I might reduce the salt slightly to 1 1/2 tsp. To make it look more attractive, I topped the shanks w/ fresh chopped parsley before serving.

My adult family rated this delicious. I browned the shanks before cooking and added a stick of celery to the vegetables I cooked with the shanks. An hour before the end I added mushrooms. I cooked it for under 4 hours on high and only 3 hours on low. In future I will cook entirely on low, or use high for no more than an hour, unless I want to eat in less than 4-5 hours..

Cooked this 6 hrs. on high and about 4 on low. The meat fell off the bones. Lemon zest gave it kind of a funky taste that we didn't care for. Will do again without lemon and maybe throw in some tomato paste.

I took the advice of another reviewer and browned the lamb shanks under the broiler ahead of time. I cut the recipe in half, and it more than fed 2 of us. I think it would have fed 3 perfectly. I assembled it on sunday night, and pulled it out of the fridge and let it cook all day on low while I was at work. I didn't turn it half way through. It came out fine. I served it over riced potatoes (I did those the night before and nuked them before serving). It made Monday night very easy. I served the same Australian Shiraz-grenache with it that I put in the pot.

I made this with six lamb chops, used one tsp of salt instead of two, and browned the chops on high heat before putting in the cooker on low for 7 hours (no turning). It turned out great and wasn't very greasy because the cops have less fat. Two chops per person is about right and it was great with roasted sweet potato chunks dusted with my good friend's special sweet potato spices!

This was great! But I always have a hard time reducing a recipe to just two servings. I wanted to use my crock pot that's why I chose it - plus I'd never cooked lamb before. The meat was amazing! I cooked it on high 4 hours, came home from church and added carrots and cooked on low for 4 more hours and it was VERY done without being burned. The only problem was i used too much rosemary (and didn't have wine on hand so used cheap red cooking wine and some port) I think all these together left a bitter aftertaste that's hard to get rid of. Had to add honey and water to the sauce. Served on top of mashed potatoes. I'll make it again with less rosemary and a better wine. (Browning the meat first was an excellent idea and worked well!)

This recipe sounded delicious, and had so many rave reviews: I couldn't wait to try it. Unfortunately I came home tonight to a disappointment. Like one of the less than great reviews, I too found the meat overpowering the more delicate flavours. Not trimming the fat led to an overly rich and greasy dish. I may use the ingredients again in a marinade or some other way with lamb, but not with a slow cooker. I was really disapointed.

Very yummy and easy to make. After looking at other crock pot recipes, I decided to brown the lamb first under the broiler as others here suggested, then I cooked it in the crockpot on LOW for 8 hours. The meat came out perfectly tender and falling off the bones. No messing around with turning things over after 6 hours!

Loved this! I made it the day before & reheated on top of the stove. I removed most of the fat. The meat fell off the bones, so I was able to shred it. Perfect for casual company!

This dish was really good. I followed the suggestion to brown the meat under the broiler and used lamb chops instead of shanks. I didn't cook it as long as it said. I think it was more like 3 hours on high and 6 hours on low. But next time I might try cooking it on low for the entire time. The meat fell apart but doesn't it always in a crockpot? And the flavor was worth eating the meat in pieces. I served this with roasted sweet and white potatoes with brussel sprouts. It was an excellent meal with minimal effort which is always nice to find.

For the 3/07/03 cook: I've made a recipe very similar to this one for years. I do the prep work the evening before, put it in the removable insert and refrigerate overnight. I take it out when I first get up in the morning to let it come to room temperature, and plug it in as I'm going out the door to work. It's done in 10-12 hours on low or "auto-shift". PS: Brown shanks under broiler; browning is where the flavor is at!

Has anyone tried this with less cooking time? I just don't see getting up in the wee hours of the morning for food prep, just to get 12 hours of cooking in before dinner! (Perhaps this needs to be only for late night dinner? Or can it sit in the crock in the fridge overnight?)
