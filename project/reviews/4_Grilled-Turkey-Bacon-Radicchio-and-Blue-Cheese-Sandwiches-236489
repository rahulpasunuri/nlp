Wow- made this last night and it was the best sandwich I have ever eaten. Made as written, except used spinach instead of radicchio since that's what I had in the fridge. Will be making again very soon!

Day 4 of thanksgiving leftovers. A package of applewood bacon newly cooked and stashed in the fridge. This sandwich was a surprise- I would never have combined all that but it was soooo good, and so unlike any other turkey combos. I used plain uyogurt instead of mayo (can't stand mayo; don't know why). Next time I'll whirl the spread in a mini prep processor to make it more smooth. Yum.

I added a little more hellman's than what the recipe called for. The my customers loved it!

These sandwiches were simply amazing! I didn't change a thing from the ingredients, although we did grill these sandwiches on the grill. Rave reviews from friends at the baby shower where we served these.

This is a great alternative to the usual turkey sandwich. I typically buy carving station turkey from the deli counter so this was a great way to change it up. I used Stilton cheese (I had that on hand).

I agree - a great use for T'giving leftovers. I made it without the radicchio, and altho it was good, it was missing something. I'll make sure I have radicchio next time.

Easy, quick and delicious. Don't skip any of the steps and don't substitute! I tried with once with blue cheese and any time with gorgonzola, blue cheese had more flavor.
