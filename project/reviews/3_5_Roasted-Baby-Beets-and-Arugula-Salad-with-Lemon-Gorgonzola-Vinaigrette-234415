I have made this recipe several times but with a couple time saving modifications. I used canned tiny whole beets rinsed well and packaged croutons. It was still very delicious!

Just okay, and not worth the trouble. I have to admit that as per the other reviewer, I used romaine instead of the argula (my family doesn't like arugula). Glad I roasted the beets - I may do that again.

this sound fantastic you may wish to use goat cheese instead of the gorgonzola for a more robust flavor!

This was delish. I am lucky to have arugula by the pound at my local grocery store, and have been using it a ton lately in everything from crepe filling to salads. I added just one thing to this salad -- half a chopped preserved meyer lemon.

This was incredibly tasty. I didn't use baby beets, I used normal sized beets from the farmer's market, used Borough Market Stilton, and used a mesclun mix. I also used the only herb we have on hand, mint (what can I say, we like mojitos!). The mint imparted a nice brightness that countered the more heavy flavours of the beets and Stilton. It probably would have been even better with arugula, but the mesclun was just fine, too!

I've made this at least 10 times and have done 2 things that make (to me) a big difference: 1. I peel the beets before cooking them. I find that cooking peeled beets allows the sugars to emerge and brown nicely; while cooking and then peeling them after cooking (while still good and easier to peel) isn't as deep a flavor. 2. I put all the dressing ingredients into a mini food processor so the cheese combines thoroughly. After dressing the salad I throw a few crumbles over it for bonus. I also do what a previous reviewer did, which was throw the croutons on after dressing the salad. For me the combination of lemon and arugula is heavenly and cannot imagine that substituting romaine would be as good, but not having tried it...?

What a delicious way to eat such healthy foods. I love arugula, which was terrific with the mellow beets and cheesy dressing. Great combination of flavors. I find that seasoning the arugula and dressing perfectly before adding the beets and croutons really makes the difference betweeen a so-so salad a really good salad.

I expected to love this salad as the ingredients are among my favorite foods, but founds the combination lackluster.

I really think that using the word fussy to describe arugula is totally inadequate if not downright wrong. I find arugula to be a nice break in the monotony of mesclun green salads.

made for 4: Couldn't find baby beets so used one whole beet per person, baked over an hour. I peeled and cut into 1/8's. Reduced the amount of arugula accordingly. Definitely liked the arugula flavor. This goes in the family cookbook!

I took the advice below when I couldn't get to arugula (couldn't stop at one more market on my way home from work) and used romaine. Fab!!! A handy tip - I used the pre steamed and peeled beets from Trader Joe's to save time and hassle! It was great. What I did was put the beets out of the package and the bread mixture into a Pyrex and put that in a very hot oven for 15 minutes - just to heat the beets through. It was great. I think that I could use goat or blue cheese too. Really good!

The dressing was fabulous!!! I would serve this over a less fussy green, like romaine, especially with all the flavors added by the gorgonzola and beets. After I roasted the beets, I sprinkled a little Tarragon vinegar over them to add some extra flavor (let them sit about an hour). With regards to the croutons, I had half a loaf of italian herb slab bread on hand which I literally tore into pieces. I just added the garlic and a little chopped rosemary from the yard. I cooked these according to the recipe and they were delicious! I did peel the beets, it was a chore (because they were so small). I could only find red beets at the produce stand...next time I will make sure I get white and red!
