I just tried this recipe to make homemade caramel and hot fudge sundaes and it turned out great! It was just sweet enough and the bitterness from using bitter-sweet chocolate went nicely with the super sweet caramel sauce. I noticed some reviews complaining of a grainy result, this could have many causes but in my experience with fudge its usually for one of the following ideas: is that it's usually from not combining all of the sugar with the cream and chocolate mixture before it starts to boil; (usually this happens when some gets stuck on the spoon or side of the saucepan) if the sugar gets added after the boil it can make your sauce grainy because it crystallizes and doesn't get combined with the other ingredients. Or another reason is because you get water into your melted mixture and the chocolate seizes (this doesn't take a lot of water, even a couple of droplets can do it). Other reasons can be quality of ingredients (cream too light, not using a good quality chocolate and it melts funny etc.). I hope this helps :D

This is an amazing hot fudge sauce! I made it with Ghirardelli cocoa powder and Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. It was raved about by a bunch of chocolate lovers.

This is the BEST hot fudge sauce! Freezes well and does not get sugary.

Excellent. Lovely texture as well as flavor. and reheat well. This will become my go-to fudge sauce. You can prevent graininess by being sure that the sauce is completely cool before covering and refrigerating. Easy to make except for the always-messy process of chopping chocolate finely. Someone suggested putting a small cutting board in a rimmed baking sheet that has been lined with parchment. That way the shards that tend to fly around when you chop with a chef's knife or cleaver are contained. I'm going to try that next time.

This is so easy and delicious! I didn't change a thing but make sure to use good chocolate and cocoa as it makes all the difference.

This is a silky smooth sauce that has just the right balance of sweetness to dark chocolate. I made it this evening and am so wowed by it that I had to come back to add a review -- I'd almost been persuaded by the critics not to try. Ignore the 2 fork reviews and make this sauce! I used an inexpensive dark chocolate (Cadbury's) and it still tastes great, so I am sure it would be fantastic with something finer. I am serving this with profiteroles tomorrow night and know that it will be a big hit.

I thought this was a very yummy sauce. Very easy to put together and I like that it's easy to control the sweetness by adjusting the sugar amount and type of chocolate used. I wanted to amp up the bittersweetness,so I added a touch of espresso powder and coffee liqueur in place of the vanilla. Served over homemade peanut butter ice cream and it was super -- I'll never buy store-bought fudge sauce again!

Really good, but a bit moody. I've made it several times; sometimes it's perfect but sometimes it turns out a little grainy. I think the key is the cream - my best results were when I used a really, really high quality cream from a local micro-dairy. It's also important to not overcook it. I brought it to a very slow boil, then turned it down to barely a simmer for the last five minutes. It is pretty sweet. Next time I'll decrease the brown sugar and see what happens.

Too sweet for my taste. I added espresso powder and some unsweetened chocolate to compensate but still was not impressed.

Hmm... while perfectly lovely, I found this sauce to be lacking. My measuring sticks are the hot fudge at the Boston area ice cream shops Herrell's and Christina's. I halved this recipe, so perhaps I made an error, but the consistency was a bit hard when it cooled, and the flavor, above all, didn't have the depth or complexity I was looking for. Somehow, with all the chocolate, it didn't taste chocolatey enough.

PS If you don't have fresh whipping cream on hand, you can totally make this with evaporated milk. I guarantee you'll still get rave reviews and the pot will be licked clean.

This recipe makes the perfect hot fudge sauce. I get asked for it every time I make it, and someone is always found with a spoon in hand dipping out of the refrigerated leftovers. It chills into a true fudge and is fantastic plain, on ice cream or brownies or just about anything. High quality chocolate I am certain is fabulous, but I've made it with plain old Nestle's semi-sweet chocolate chips and it's to die for. Quality vanilla is essential for fantastic flavor. Can't go wrong with this one!

Easy to make, delicious result. I used Ghiradelli bittersweet chocolate chips which gave the sauce a deep, rich flavor.

Fantastic! Just like the hot fudge sauce my mom made when I was a kid. We make brownies (use the snowdrop brownie recipe), top with vanilla ice cream and this. Wonderful dessert!

I loved this recipe! After a test run, I multipled the recipe by X 6 Must say I was a bit nervous it wouldn't come out as well but Phew, perfect!!! poured it into small jars, tied up with a ribbon and it was a great holiday gift. Of course important to use a high quality chocolate but also I think it is essential to use 100% pure Vanilla. I used "Baldwin's Vanilla" which is from a small town in the Berkshires (Western Massachusetts) and I think it makes a huge difference. For those of you who are major Bakers.. def worth ordering a bottle.. expensive but worth it!

To minimize the sugar content, I substituted Brown Sugar Splenda for the regular brown sugar and Maple Crest's Old Fashioned sugar free maple syrup for the corn syrup. I used 70% chocolate from Trader Joe's. Next time I would sift the cocoa powder to ensure no lumps. I added 1 teaspoon of expresso powder to the hot mixture to intensify the chocolate flavor & minimize the maple. Great stuff!

Used Trader Joes 72% dark chocolate and 1/2 & 1/2. Probably not as rich as would be with heavy cream...but still amazing!

This is my staple hot fudge recipe - have made it over a dozen times. I now stick to Trader Joe's 72% big bar and Spice House Dutch-process cocoa powder. Great for any use - sundaes, topping a chocolate bread pudding, with fruit, in mason jars with ribbons for gifts.

This is a standard in our house. It's super easy to make, and it's fast, too, which is great for when we suddenly get a hankering for something sweet in the evening and have nothing special on hand.

I don't have much to add to the previous reviews of this sauce. The flavor is dead on, the consistency and texture are perfect and it has that beautiful gloss that you want hot fudge to have. The only thing I would stress is the importance of using high quality bittersweet chocolate. I used Baker's brand chocolate (not the most prestigious) because I couldn't find a better one at the grocery store I was at. Even though this sauce has a lot of ingredients, the chocolate that you use ends up being the predominant taste, so the better the chocolate you use, the better it's going to taste. But even so, with the Baker's chocolate, it tasted pretty amazing.

To die for. Instead of Dutch-process cocoa powder, I used organic, raw cacao powder. (Absurdly expensive, but a splurge with excellent results. And makes a mean hot chocolate!) Please make this! Seriously.

Not only did I win first prize in the "condiment sauce" category of the county fair with this recipe, I also won "best in canning"! It takes less than 20 minutes to make and is SO simple that you'd be crazy not to give it a try. Don't monkey with the recipe. It's perfect.

This is truly yummy with a rich undertaste of the cocoa. Instead of wasting any of the heavy cream I adapted the recipe to using the whole 8 oz carton-- used 1/2 c. brown sugar and the other ingredients are easier to adjust. Definitely a keeper!

I've tried hot fudge recipes before, but I've never found one I like better than the Smuckers sauce i buy. Until this recipe. this is fantastic hot fudge. I made this to drizzle over ice cream, but we ended up dipping cookies and spoons into this too. It is wonderful.

Hands down, this is the best hot fudge sauce around, and it's easy to make. It's absolutely delicious. Made it for the in-laws who are chocolate lovers -- my mother-in-law wanted to eat it straight.

I call this my "celebrity" hot fudge and here's why: A while back when I was living in Santa Monica, I had a few friends over for a dessert party (for which I made this recipe for the first time). A girlfriend of mine asked if she could bring this new guy she was dating and I said "Sure!" Well, that night she showed up with her date, but she had neglected to mention that he was a very handsome, very famous actor (who unfortunately must remain nameless)!! I was so awestruck to have him in my home, but I instantly thought "Oh, he's probably on some diet and won't be able to eat a thing." He surprised me by not only trying the hot fudge (served over brownies and ice cream), but also, after making sure everyone else was done with it, eating it straight out of the serving dish!! He just raved about it! Later he kissed me on the cheek and told me it was the best hot fudge he's ever had... Sigh... If I could give this recipe eight forks, I would! Not only is it delicious, it attracts celebrity hunks...
