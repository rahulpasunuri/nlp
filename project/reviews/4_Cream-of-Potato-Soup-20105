So very good!!!! Love that it is so simple. Have made this recipe 3 times now and am passing it on to a couple of my customers. Did add extra potatoes in the blender and then added a few diced potatoes into the soup. Added some garlic powder to the mix and this last time added a slice of swiss cheese, which my husband said took it over the top. Since we are vegetarian I did use..Better Than Bouillon, vegetable base.

Forgot to mention, I used vegetable bouillon paste instead of the chicken bouillon cube to keep it vegetarian.

This is very good as base recipe as others have said. I added an extra 1/2 cup of potatoes and 1/4 cup of chopped celery AFTER blending because I like a chunkier potato soup. I doubled the onion and sauteed them with a bit of garlic for a few minutes before adding them. I also added a half teaspoon of cayenne pepper, a bay leaf, and used smoked salt in place of regular.

This is a favorite soup recipe. So good, so easy. I use more potato - about 2 cups- and keep half to add as chunks after pureeing. Also brown some extra onion. Also add some shredded cheddar when I return it to the pot. I skip the boullion cube to keep it vegetarian. It's amazing that something so simple and easy can be so very good.

Just wonderful, but I did doctor this recipe up a bit. Added a little cayenne pepper, used beef bouillon instead of chicken bouillon, sauteed more onions (& added them in at the end), added about 2/3 cup cheddar, took out the chives, and put in 2 bay leaves for about ten minutes while the soup was heating. -Also just a touch of garlic powder. It was wonderful- hearty and flavorful. I essentially used this recipe as a base for a new, kicked-up soup- and I'm sure it would be a great base for other flavor profiles as well.

I would suggest using cream instead of milk. Skip the puree step. I cooked the diced potatoes about 45 minutes with chicken drippings from a rotisserie cooked chicken instead of chicken broth. I sauteed 1/2 cup onions (which added a sweet taste), Next time I will add or substitute the potatoes with wild mushrooms. Otherwise, it was good and easy. The date of this recipe tells me I need to start looking for OLD cookbooks for easy and good recipes. No more processed foods! Thanks, Epicurious!

Excellent!! I cooked the potatoes in chicken stock and left out the boullion because that is what I had in the house. Very easy and tastey!

I loved this just as is. The second and third time I made this I added some extra chunks of boiled potato before serving.

I have to echo the last reviewer...this was amazingly tasty for such a simple dish. I like my potato soup chunky so I cooked an extra cup of potato to add in afterwards. I'm also a big onion fan so I used more (1/2 cup) and browned them in a bit of butter for added flavour. Added them in after as well so they wouldn't be pureed. Delicious! I'll be adding this to my collection of "Tried and True" recipes.

I needed something quick one night and I came across this recipe. Absolutely delicious.. have made it three times since then. First time the soup came out a little on the salty side for my husband so I put a pinch of salt the next couple of times. Will definitely make it again. Served it with turkey sandwiches.

I used low fat milk, half a cup of cream, and then added a few sprinkles of flour to thicken it up at the end when it was heating. Mild taste, not overally potato..but good.

Great recipe! I added chunks of cooked potato and cheddar cheese and bacon bits on top to make it more of a "baked potato soup".

I love this recipe. I made this last night for my husband who initially wanted soup from a can. I couldn't believe it! I found this recipe and said, 'Give me a minute or two honey and you can have fresh soup". He loved it! I recommend adding chopped cooked bacon as well!

My SO has been undergoing chemo and radiation for esophageal cancer, and has been on a feeding tube for the past month. Finally, a couple of nights ago he said that he felt he could eat some soup, something nice and thick and creamy. As I had no canned soup that would fit that bill, I did a search here and decided to try this. After reading the reviews, I cooked the potato in chicken broth, and instead of the onion used a little chopped leek, sautéed in butter. Excellent! He ate a large bowl of it, and our daughter and I enjoyed it very much as well. Thank you, Epicurious!

Soooo easy and delicious! I cooked the diced potatoes in water & chicken bouillon. Added remaining ingredients and only blended about 3/4 of mixture. (I tend to like some lumps in my potato soup.) Didn't add parsley. Sprinkled dried chives and grated cheddar cheese. Served as an accompaniment to Reubens! Big Hit!!

oh so simple and comforting.

A really simple recipe. After I blended it, I thought it was a bit thin, so cooked up one more diced potato and mashed it with a fork before mixing it into the soup by hand. This thickened it up just enough. I also used beef stock rather than chicken. This added nice colour as well as a slightly heartier taste.

This recipe is great because it is so simple. It tastes wonderful, and my three children loved it! Most people have all the ingredients in their home, so it is a good throw together meal if you haven't been to the grocery store in a while.

This is a GREAT recipe. I have made it at least 3 dozen times and it never fails to be wonderful. If you remotely like potatoes you'll love this soup.

My 10-year-old son is one of the PICKIEST eaters on the planet. My 12-year-old daughter is a HUGE fan of cream of potato soup. This recipe was truly enjoyed by both of them! I tripled the batch...and it tasted wonderful. We added shredded cheddar cheese and bacon on top...yummy!

My family loved this soup. My 6 yr old who is very picky loves it. I added butter, used powdered bouillon, and used minced onions, also added diced onion for texture. When serving I added bacon bits and cheddar cheese. Wonderful! Have made twice and will make many time again.

This is white. with a grilled cheese sandwich and some crudite on the side they're all happy! Its quick, easy and inexpensive for a cool crisp fall nite.

As usual with the epicurious recipes...YUM! I've always loved potatoes and soup, but I had always had a lot of trouble trying to find a good recipe as most either too runny and thin or else too thick, fatty, and almost had a taste of ham in them. This one was so delcious- rich, yet the perfect texture. I boiled a little too many potatoes so I added some extra diced potatoes to the finished soup and I really liked the extra texture. However, as another person had said, I also noticed that the onion was a little too pungent...I'd recommend sauteed minced scallions instead (maybe???). Either way it was very tasty, a big hit, and a permanent addition to my cookbook.

Simple and delicious. I needed an easy recipe for potato soup for my sick husband and this was wonderful. I may have added a bit more butter, though. I will make again.

This recipe has potential. Next time, I would boil the onion with the potatoes. Otherwise, their crunch stand out too much. Good comfort food.
