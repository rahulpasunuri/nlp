Tried various suggestions here. My thoughts: more beans, no taco seasoning -- these rules would apply to any nacho sort. Spicy ranch with carrots (lots of carrots) as a side is more of a meal highlight.

Delicious, easy and looks great! I used a mini food chopper to speed up the process...

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's family, and everyone raved about it. It was gone in 10 minutes. I made my own salsa, though, and my own guacamole to give it flavor. I added lime juice to the avocados before adding the salsa to it. For the salsa, I diced 4 tomatoes, 2 jalapenos, added diced onion, fresh chopped cilantro, lime juice, and a little dry chicken broth for flavor. I always get compliments on the salsa. Will make again for a crowd.

Yummy and different. Might want to halve the recipe tho if you are making for the family, it is huge!

Everyone loves this salad and a spicy ranch is a great accompaniment. I made Hidden Valley Ranch dressing from scratch and added chipotle paste, but at the store today I saw that there is a bottled spicy ranch which would save you time. A nice twist on your layered salad.

My guests love this salad. The only downside is that leftovers are not salvagable.

I had this dish at a party and I could not stop eating it! The hostess made a couple of changes to the original recipie, but it was great. Try this substitution as you will fall in love again with this dish - instead of other dressings, use guacamole for the flavor and for the dressing. Yummy and a definate croud pleaser!!!!!

Great recipe. I used baked corn chips and put chipolte ranch on the side for a little kick. It got rave reviews. It was even great the next day after the corn chips lost their crunch.

Yummy! Just the right dish to bring to a potluck/hayride picnic. I marinaded the chicken in taco seasonings & olive oil and grilled it. The grill marks look great in the salad. I served it with multi-color nacho chips; blue corn, yellow and red. I brought each item in an individual baggie and assembled it at the picnic, therefore, the nacho chips didn't get soggy. Who wants soggy nacho chips anyhow? Brought lots of sour cream, buttermilk dressing and extra salsa to put in bowls and topped the salad with black olives. My dish seemed to go first and there were no seconds..no firsts either for people who took to long to fill their plates up! Its a keeper.

I LOVE this recipe! I used the Old El Paso pre-chicken mix from the grocery store. I made this once for my family and brother, even my father liked it and he is not big on Mexican food! They liked it so much that I decided to make it for a work party. After the party everyone was asking me for the recipe! I will be making this again!

A great crowd pleaser....i grilled the chicken and personally, i think it added a lot of flavor. I put extra salsa and a bowl of tortilla chips on the table to serve with it, since the chips within the salad gets soft and not crunchy. Makes a lot....probably feeds 8 or 10 adults with a couple of leftover lunch portions. Great with the Corn Chive muffins on this site too!

Excellent for parties or pot lucks. Looks great and tastes like a little bit of Mexico. Quite simple to prepare and doesn't take much time (15 mins.). I will use more avocados and more cheese next time.

I was looking for a green salad to accompany my Mexican main dish for Super Bowl and this recipe was perfect! Colorful, fast, and delicious, even without the chicken! I was crunched for time, so mashing the avocado with the salsa worked fine for a quickie guacamole. Next time, though, homemade. With the chicken or some grilled flank steak, it would make a great light supper. Definitely a thumbs up!

Added a layer of sour cream and some sliced ripe olives and took it to a class reunion cookout. It makes a BIG salad. Everyone said they loved it (but they're a friendly bunch). Will serve the nachos on the side next time.

This salad definitely goes into my recipe box. My family enjoyed it and found it satisfying as a main dish on a warm summer evening. If you are watching your calories you can leave out the tortilla chips. I used a lime cumin vinegrette which nicely compliments the other ingredients.

Wonderful and easy dish! I used this as a side to enchiladas and although the enchiladas got rave reviews I received even more praise for this dish as well as an empty bowl.

You can't beat recipies like this for ease and taste! I made it for a guest, but it's easy enough for a light, quick dinner too. I kept the chips separate so they would stay crisp. I also made my own guacamole recipe and used this instead of the recommendation above. The guac was also kept separate so we could eat leftovers the next day with fresh avacado.

Great, fast and easy! Especially since I also used prepared marinated and grilled chicken strips. Loved the avocado and salsa dressing and thought it needed no other dressing. I crunched chips on top, My guests loved it.

Great quick recipie. I was a bit short on time so I purchased a rotisserie chicken from the supermarket which really turned out great since the chicken was so moist. Like the idea of using the tortilla chips to scoop the salad but we added ours and didn't have a problem - the salad was gone before they got soggy!

This is delicious. My guests loved it! I boiled the chicken, shredded it, and sauteed it with taco seasoning. I used romaine lettuce, red beans, sour cream and didn't crush the tortillas into the salad for fear of them getting soggy (as other readers have said). Instead, everyone scooped up the salad with the tortillas which worked out great. This is a keeper.

This dish is a definite crowd pleaser. Delicios! I made it twice in one week, and got positive feedback from everyone who tried it. I boiled and shredded the chicken, and bought medium hot salsa from our favorite mexican restaurant, and mixed about 1/3 cup with the chicken before layering. I also added onion powder, sour cream, and oregano to the avacado. I also tried using ground turkey meat, and added taco seasoning to the meat. It tasted great both times. The full recipe feeds approximately 12 healthy size side dish portions. I will definitely make it again.

I made half this for just my husband and me. Still way too much. But my step-son came over and saved the day. It is delicious. I used b-b-qued chicken breasts cut up into chunks instead of shredded. I've made it twice this summer and will definately make it over and over. Good for a family potluck.

A pleasant change of pace from my good old standby, Lawry's Taco Salad. Used spicy Southwestern chicken strips. Served Cold Cucumber Mint Soup with it, a soothing contrast to the spice of the salad.

I made this for a neighbor's birthday and it was a hit. Several suggestions from previous reviews helped in tweaking it a bit. I too did the chicken in the skillet and added a pkt of taco seasoning while cooking then pulled it off the bone and shredded. and instead of all the layers, I just did one of each. I too did the guac,and sour cream and i did pico de guillo instead of salsa DIVINE! Word of caution if you are expecting to have left overs,or arent serving immediately, save the chips layer and serve those seperately as they do get soggy. also if you are serving kids set some stuff aside UNcombined as little ones tend not to eat foods once all mixed up. If they can identify each item they are much more inclined to eat it. My kids made little pigs of themselves when i served them each item seperately vs. once it was layered in the bowl--GO figure. Have had numerous requests to make again. Cost for the whole dish was around $18 and served 8 easily.

This salad is just fantastic and so simple to make. To cut down on prep time, I used prepared guacamole, pre-roasted chicken strips (the kind you buy already cooked - pricey, but saves time!), and a bag of the pre-cut salad. The lazy way, but it still turned out delicious! Definitely will make it again.

I loved this recipe. I had a birthday luncheon for a couple of friends at my house and I prepared this. It was delicious and the presentation was colorful. We made extra guacamole to dip our chips. Tonight, I am making for the family.

I absolutely love this recipe. I made it as an app for Easter. I did make some changes. I cooked the chicken in a skillet and then when it was 3 qtr. of the way cooked through, added a packet of taco seasoning. Then I shredded with 2 forks. I also added some sour cream as an additional layer, diced, seeded tomatoes, and extra salsa/avocados. It was so good! I'll definitely make again. Perfect to bring to a party - maybe Cinco de Mayo?? :)

This is more like 3.5 forks. I get rave reviews every time I make it even from picky eaters. It really doesn't need dressing because of the salsa but I provide a lime vinagrette for those who want one.

As a previous reviewer suggested this is a great recipe for a potluck. I brought it to a holiday luncheon today and not only did it taste great, the colors/presentation were very festive.

I agree with all the other cooks. This recipe was fantastic! In addition to the leafy red lettuce, I also used Boston lettuce and raddicio. Everyone at my dinner party loved this salad. It is both beautiful and delicious.
