Blech!!! Would have given it 0 forks if that was an option. We put it in the trash and ate salad and potatoes

This is a great way to prepare swordfish. Sword is probably my favorite fish to eat from the North Atlantic. My second favorite seafood is grilled sea turtle, which is very low in fat and cholesterol. Bon Appetit!

WARNING: Not only does long-line fishing for swordfish result in the bycatch deaths of many endangered sea turtles, but the FDA has said that children and women of child-bearing age should not eat swordfish because they contain toxic levels of mercury. For more info, check out www.gotmercury.org.
