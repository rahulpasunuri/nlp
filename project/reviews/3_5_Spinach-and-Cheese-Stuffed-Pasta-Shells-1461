This is a great, basic recipe. I prepared this dish last night & it isn't at all time consuming & is delicious. Change I made: Fresh spinach + 1/4 grated onion + garlic + pine nuts + golden raisins sautéed in olive oil for 5 minutes... Then, I followed the recipe & LOVED it!

I agree with a majority of the reviewers...needs an egg and more herbs, salt and pepper. Fennel overpowers rather than enhances. It's a great vegetarian recipe idea but I'd make it again more in the Italian style.

I used 2lbs of ricotta cheese and filled 36 shells. The true Italian secret to a fluffy cheese filling is to add one egg per pound of ricotta cheese. Blend ricotta cheese and egg first, then hand stir in the spinach, romano (my preference), garlic, fresh or dry basil, salt & pepper. You don't need to fill shells so full because they will fluff up when cooking. This is a great recipe to get the basic stuffed shell process going. Mangia!

This recipe is a great weekday recipe. Agreed with previous reviewers that it needs a little more salt in the filling (might be because I used low fat ricotta). I also skipped the fennel, but added portobellos and chili pepper. Then, I topped it with a spicy marinara sauce. Delicious!

Needed a vegetarian entree--This filled the bill. Used a small ice cream scoop to fill shells, which was a fast process. Added herbs and red pepper for more dash.

Easy and tasty! I skipped the original recipe, however, and went straight for the reviewer's suggestions. Added a pinch of nutmeg, red pepper flakes, quite a lot of an Italian Seasoning mix, extra garlic, extra fresh basil, lots of salt and pepper, and mozzarella in the filling and on top of the dish. I left off the fennel (not a huge fan). STILL a little bit bland... I think maybe I'll add chopped onion next time. Fresh parsley? The key really is to KEEP TASTING the filling 'til you got it the way you like it. I would definitely make this again, with some more spice additions!

Excellent. I have made this twice. Once keeping completely true to the recipe and changing nothing; it was excellent but was certainly missing a dash of nutmeg to enhance the spinach. The second time I made it, I used a trick I learned from Vegetarian Times to make the recipe more figure friendly: I subbed low-fat, large curd cottage cheese (rinsed and drained) for the ricotta and added the needed freshly-grated nutmeg. The combination of fennel and the nutmeg was interesting and complimentary - though, perhaps, counterintuitive. Superb. We are a family of three (two adults, one active, hungry teen) and this made enough for two meals when served with a salad and a slice of garlic bread for each.

Way too much fennel seeds!! Probably 1/4 of the 2 tbl spoons and grounded would be better. Use a lot of salt. I our oven 350 was not enough to heat it up well 370 is better. Overall a disappointment!

Rating: 3
MMMMM - also added shredded Mozz. as suggested to filling - maybe 1.5 cups and topped with some too after sauce. Ground fennel with mortar and pestle before adding - can't imagine it would be near as good without it. Made my own marinara and had closer to 4 or 5 cups but a good jarred sauce would be fine. Huge hit with the vegetarian and meat-eating guests alike.

This dish needs a LOT of salt! Taste and keep on adding. That helped it a lot; but I would omit the fennel seeds - don't think they added anything good. Some red pepper flakes would be nice, though. And MOZZARELLA! I shredded at least a cup on top, and can't imagine eating this dish without it. Use part-skim ricotta and add the mozzarella, you won't be sorry. Also, I totally found it needed more cooking time just to get the filling warm!

Rating: 3
I used only 10oz. of spinach, added 1 C shredded mozzarella but otherwise made the recipe as written. I only filled 20 shells with about 1.5 T of filling each. I thought the filling flavor was a little bland but homemade marinara dresses it up. I will definitely make again but will experiment more with the spices and/or types of cheese used.

Rating: 4
I quarupled the recipe to freeze some, used a 3-cheese mix, and used homemade sauce w/hot Italian sausage (to me, its the key ingredient). Superb! Time consuming but, when made in large batches, well worth the effort! Although I would normally make lasagne instead to omit so much work, if you want change, this recipe is a definite keeper!! Two thumbs up!

Rating: 3
I doubled the filling, added 2C shredded mozzarella and used shredded Romano instead of grated Parmesan. It made a 9x13 (42 shells) and 8x8 (20 shells), with a little leftover filling. A great basic dish, easy to dress up if/when needed. Would be great for a pot luck.

Hubby made this recently and it was very good. We had plenty of filling. Also, I would recommend grinding up the fennel seeds. I enjoy the taste, but I did not enjoy biting into the seeds themselves.

Rating: 3
There has been some debate over whether the quantity of filling is sufficient to the suggested number of shells. I found that the recipe as written will fill 32 shells only if each contains about a Tsp of filling, which may indeed be some people' s preference. In order to generously fill the shells, the filling portions would have to be increased to at least one and a half, if not doubled. It is nice to note too, that the recipe as written has conveniently standard proportions: one 15oz container of ricotta, 3.5 cups of sauce is a quart size jar, and a 1lb box of shells has about 32 shells. Also, I agree with others that very finely chopped spinach has a nicer consistency. I used fresh spinach and put it (cooked) in the food processor after I chopped the garlic.

I add 1/4 - 1/2 lb. hot italian sausage in lieu of fennel - gives it a good zip. Otherwise I follow the recipe and people love this dish when I serve it.

Fabulous flavors. Added sauteed onion to stuffing. Fennel a must. Kids (all 20- somethings used to Mom's presentations), mused that the stuffing resembled baby food and would prefer something chunkier - I agree. Will experiment with a combination of chopped fresh spinach, cottage cheese, ricotta. Oh, covered everything with grated, smoked mozarella; homemade sauce contained mild salsiccia.

Rating: 4
I would add no less spinach. I have tried it with varying amounts of cheese and spinach, and just do what is called for. It's healthier that way, and with so much cheese, you need all of the spinach you can get. Also, I have read the complaints about not enough filling, and I don't understand them. I filled my shells generously and filled 12 extra shells. Delicious, I've never had a single complaint about this dish.

We used fresh spinach and a little nutmeg. Very yummy.

I think this is a good staple dish to have in one's repertoire -- it's filling, and makes for great leftovers and even frozen and heated up later on. Perfect for me b/c I'm in college and don't have time to cook every day. At the same time though, I agree with some of the reviewers that it was a little bland in flavor. I used the recipe as listed on the site w/out any substitutions.

First time I made this it was only so-so, but had lots of potential. I think one of the problems is not necessarily the amount of spinach, but that even the "chopped" spinach is still too "chunky". A Dutch brand available here is called "chopped" but is really minced - that change made a big difference but I still used only about 3/4 of the called-for amount. I added a 'good' half-cup grated Parmesan and a bit of nutmeg as well. First-rate, home-made marinara is essential. I've never been able to buy one although in NYC, London etc., I'm sure such is not the case. In spite of this wordy review, these changes were minor and made this recipe very, very good. Inexpensive and probably freezable. My children's friends might be eating this for years to come!

Made this for myself one evening when I happened to have the ingredients on hand. Even using homemade marinara and fresh spinach, I found the flavor bland. I really wasn't impressed.

Excellent recipe - though it took a good amount of time to fill the shells. I doubled the recipe (and still had a good amount of filling left over after filling more than 70 shells) and omitted the fennel as I couldn't find any at the store. I also substituted marscapone for the ricotta, which was not available at the store, either. The shells are delicious with a rich, lovely flavor. Beautiful presentation as well. My kids just loved it, as did my in-laws and husband. Definitely a keeper, and hopefully I'll be able to get some fennel and ricotta to see how it tastes according to the original recipe.

i doubled this recipe and used a pesto sauce instead of a tomato based one, which may have been the source of my problem. the pasta shells were tough and undercooked, but the cheese filling was amazing. i added more spinach and garlic and another cup or so of others cheeses- romano, cacio de roma, etc. it still got a lot of compliments at the party though.

I honestly don't know what most of the other reviewers are talking about here...I used the called-for amount of spinach and ricotta, and did NOT omit the fennel - it really flavours the dish - and I made my own marinara sauce. Using twice as much ricotta sounds like a choice for people who like the idea of eating spinach more than actually eating it...god forbid you actually *taste* a vegetable in a dish. If you wanted cheese-rich shells, you could have used another recipe. Not to mention that twice the amount of ricotta has an obscenely high amount of saturated fat...but I guess some people don't seem to think about that. The fennel is a definite must-add - the dish would be much duller without it. I wonder if some people actually realize that it doesn't make your food "taste like licorice". Oh well. Maybe dd some mozz on the top, or make your own sauce, but...its a winner as written.

There isn't anything special about the taste of these shells, but they are easy and fun to make. The ricotta mixture could use a little spicing up, and I halved the spinach - but next time I will use the full amount.

I skipped the fennel seeds and otherwise followed the instructions. I used the frozen spinich and used the pre-minced garlic that comes in a jar. We didn't have any problems with the flavor being too strong or the garlic being noticed in the stuffing. (we do LOVE garlic tho!) I have noticed that the size of the shells depends on the brand. No matter the number of shells I get enough stuffing from 1 of this recpipe to stuff shells that fill a 9x13 pan. I doubled the recipie, we fed 3 children all under the age of 4 and 4 adults, everyone had seconds and there were enough leftovers for 2 adults. Fantastic - my husband requests it and the kids never know they're eating spinach!! The kids devoured it with out a complaint! Marvelous texture and flavor. I did top with some shredded mozzerella at the end of baking for some extra ooze. It's so simple and not at all time consuming for the cook! Another bonus is that it can be kept warm in the oven for at least another hour and a half without damaging them in the least!

Rating: 2
The amount of stuffing this makes only filled 15 shells for me. I halved the spinach because that was all I had on hand - used one bunch fresh spinach, cooked, and that was good, but I think the called-for amount would be better, if you're looking for a spinach-y taste. I always use more garlic than a recipe calls for, so I used 7 small cloves, and surprisingly (for me, b/c I LOVE garlic) this was too much garlic - as it doesn't really soften up in the filling, it's still crunchy and kind of raw-tasting when the dish is done. So I won't do that again! I didn't adjust the amount of fennel but wish I had - it was really overpowering. Put some mozzarella on top and ran it all under the broiler for a couple minutes at the end, which made it look nice. Not the best stuffed shells I've ever had but not bad either, for an impromptu dinner.

Contrary to other reviews, I think the proportion of spinach to ricotta, though greater than most other stuffed shells recipes, is just right. It's not too spinach-y at all. I've made this recipe exactly as written many times, and it's a family favorite.

I went with the advice of previous reviewers and changed the proportion of ricotta to spinach. I was making this for 8 people, so I used 3 - 15 oz. tubs of ricotta and 1 - 15 oz. package of frozen chopped spinach. It worked out very well. I needed about 1.5 boxes of jumbo shells and it filled up 2 - 10x13 pans. I also added the mozzarella another reviewer suggested (1 c. mixed in with the ricotta and 1 c. spread on top) and used 2 Tbsp. of fennel. I also used 1.5 jars of Barilla marinara sauce. This got rave reviews and was a perfect make-ahead dish. Served with a simple caesar salad and crusty fresh bread - excellent dish for a crowd.

This recipe was GREAT and so easy!! I only used half of the spinach because I wanted the ricotta to be the principal ingredient and I think the creamy texture and flavor would have been hidden if I had added the extra spinach. I also omitted the fennel entirely. I used Parmeggiano Reggiano as my parmesan- you may as well go all out if you want good flavor. Also, be sure to cook the pasta to the al dente stage only especially since you have to bake the dish in the oven. Polly-o's Original New York Ricotta was used which I think is the best-so VERY creamy. I put the filling in a pastry bag and stuffed the shells that way so I was able to finish the job quickly. The result tasted just like our favorite Italian restaurant's version. I can see that this dish will be a big hit with company! Footnote: I only had enough stuffing for 14 shells with the omission of the second box of spinach (and even if I had used it, I wouldn't have been able to fill that many more shells). This was a filling dinner for 3 or 4 people when I was all done, not 6 like the recipe claims.

I love this recipe! Have made it for years. Its a great make ahead recipe for company-put it together the night before-bake it the night of and serve it w/ salad and garlic bread.Easy and GOOD!

I don't even like stuffed shells, and these were great! Per other cooks' suggestions, did not use fennel. Also, I like mozzerella, so, I put some of that in the filling, and sprinkled some on the top of the shells. Would be a really nice and EASY dinner party dish.

My company thought these were delicious. I added chopped proscuitto just to give them a little more "oomph", but I'm sure they would be just as good without it. I left out the fennel (yuk, can't stand it!). Also, I doubled it and froze them for a week in advance and it worked out great. Served it with the caesar salad recipe out of one of the Barefoot Contessa cookbooks, and the artichoke bruschetta off of this site. Great meal, enjoyed by all!

A keeper. Followed the advice of others and used half the spinach, only 1 and 1/2 T fennel, an extra t. of basil and 5 cloves of garlic (a mild, organic variety). Go ahead and use the full amount of fennel...it's the note of flavor that really makes this dish sing. I didn't have quite enough cheese mixture for all the shells, but then I like to have them stuffed generously. The change I plan to make next time? More cheese topping....maybe another variety for fun. I served this with foccacia, a medley of peppers, onions and spicy sausage and a green salad. A great meal for colder weather.

Excellent! My fennel seed had gone bad, so I wasn't able to use it. Might be one reason why some people have a problem with it. It should be stored in the freezer. I also used 10oz of frozen spinach. Added some shredded mozz. I grated some fontina on top. I think next time I will double the ricotta. Great dish! And it can be made ahead of time! Leftovers 2 days later were just as good!

I also omitted the fennel and halved the spinach (was still almost too much!), but also used whole milk ricotta. I agree that using fat-free ricotta would be a real shame - you'd lose a lot of taste. Others called this recipe bland without the fennel, but I disagree - the flavors blend together nicely, very mild and subtle, especially the basil. A great dish, and I had fun stuffing the shells!

I made this for dinner last night and it was delicious. I only used half of the spinach since too much would ruin it for me. We had some guests at the spur of the moment and I wanted to make sure there was enough filler (since I left out some spinach) so I added some cottage cheese and mozorella to the filling. I also added mozorella to the top. It came out great!

I too omitted the fennel seeds and added mozarella cheese. I reduced the amount of spinach to 1 1/2 10oz packages and it was perfect. I stuffed 26 shells with the filling instead of 32 and found them to be nice and plump. The dish went over well at my dinner party!
