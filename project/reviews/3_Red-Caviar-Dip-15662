It's totally about the kind of caviar you use. I used to make this in one city, and it would get gobbled up and people would ask for the recipe. When I would list the five ingredients, they'd say, "yeah, and...?" No one could believe that something so simple could be so fantastic. When I moved to a smaller city, though, there was only really, really cheap caviar and really, really expensive caviar, nothing mid-range. I couldn't afford the really, really expensive so tried the really cheap and it was just not the same at all. Truly boring and very disappointing, after what I'd had before. We're moving to a bigger city soon, though, and this will go back on my list of stand-bys.

Try serving this as an hors d'oeuvres instead of a dip. I pipe the mixture into premade bite size phyllo cups and garnish with caviar and dill. I prepare some with red and some with black caviar. It's very festive looking and it always gets rave reviews.

I can't believe the mediocre reviews this recipe has received. It is a party standard of mine and I just love it. I tend to use dill instead of chives but other than that follow the recipe exactly. I have always gotten raves about it. Go figure.

Here is how I made a cake with this recipe: layer graham crackers, spread the dip, repeat a few times. Chill for a few hours. Cut into triangles. Delicious!

I don't usually download recipes that have received only fair reviews; this one slipped through the cracks as I only read them after I prepared it. I was able to save it by doubling the amount of caviar.

Super boring and everyone avoided it when it got to room temperature. All the colorful ingredients got hidden within the sour cream - if you do make this, use the least amount of sour cream possible. Won't be making this one again.

I think the success of this recipe depends on the quality of the caviar that you use. It's a great way to stretch the caviar if you can't afford enough for the whole crowd, but it's not a good way to get away with serving inferior caviar. That's what I tried to do, and I noticed. My family, on the other hand -- salty-fish lovers anyway -- loved it. Next time I make it, I'll splurge for better caviar.

Easy to make, pretty to look at, but not overly exciting to eat. If you need a colorful Xmas dip, this one will do the trick, but don't expect rave reviews.

I served this at a holiday cocktail party and it was a hit--with those who enjoy the taste of caviar. You could probably skimp a bit on the caviar as this spread has a very strong taste. The color was great and made for an excellent presentation.

I didn't put quite as much sour cream as called for and you could really taste the caviar. A beautiful color and gret on sourdough baguette!
