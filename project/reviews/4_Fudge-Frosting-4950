This is the easiest fudge frosting I have ever made. I made it with the Cappuccino Chocolate Cake, so the cinnamon and coffee were essential. Problem was I remembered the cinnamon after the cake was iced. My solution was to sift cinnamon over the top of the cake. I used about 1 tsp and everyone loved it. I'm making it again today and will put 1 1/2 tsp in the frosting.

My favorite frosting EVER! I like my chocolate pure so I didn't add the coffe powder or the cinnamon.

Sweet Lord Jesus on high! This is the finest chocolate icing I've ever had  that was relatively simple to make. I left out the cinnamon and coffee (which I'm sure would make this extra delish) this time, but regardless, this baby is a keeper.

Delicious!! Might cut back on the cinnamon next time.

Wow, this is the perfect fudge frosting! More than one person referred to it as "adult", and it really is - super-fudgey, not too sweet, and the coffee taste is subtle but definitely detectable. I doubled the recipe to frost 72 cupcakes, but it made a ton - I think one batch would have been enough. The only changes I made were to reduce the granulated sugar to a 1/2 cup (per batch), and to use instant espresso powder for the coffee powder. (Maybe that doesn't even count as a change.) I considered the 4 tsp of cinnamon to be a typo and used 1/4 tsp per batch as other reviewers suggested, but I think it could have used just a little more. I used this for the Devil's Food Cupcakes on this site - it was an amazing combination, but for serious lovers of chocolate only.

Like other reviewers suggested, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 C and used about 1 C of powdered sugar, which is probably necessary because I omitted the coffee and cinn. I also added about 1/4 C of sour cream and an additional 1/4 C of half and half. This is a good base recipe and is easy to adjust to your own liking.

So very disappointing... I prepared this frosting exactly as the recipe indicated with the exception of the cinnamon. Massive typo in the recipe indicates 4 teaspoons of cinnamon and that is a ridiculous amount! I left it out entirely as I don't want cinnamon in my chocolate frosting. I used high quality ingredients, top notch chocolate and followed as indicated. The frosting came out slightly gritty (yes, I cooked it to perfection) and once on the cake, it did not hold up well. Granted it was a warm day, but I don't want pools of frosting dripping from my cake nor do I want it seeping into the layers.

Great recipe. Used 1/4 tsp cinnamon, no coffee. We like our frosting sweet--I used 7 oz semisweet and 3 oz unsweetened. Texture is really nice, not like a ganache. I whipped the frosting after it chilled and then came back to room temperature. Great fudgy, smooth frosting.

YUM!!! I love sweet chocolate frostings and this was perfect and wonderfully chocolatey.

Wow - "fudge frosting" is definitely an appropriate name for this delicious and chocolatey icing. Licking the spatula was like eating a chocolate bar! I used a little over 1 cup of powdered sugar and can't imagine using much more than that. YUM!

Beware: There is a typo! It should be 1/4 tsp. cinnamon. Other than the above, it's delicious. Very popular with the kids and grown-ups alike :) Enjoy

Loved this. Perfect - with these modifications: Used only 1 cup powdered sugar (I like my chocolate not too sweet), 1 tsp espresso powder (husband hates mocha when he thinks he's getting straight chocolate) and no cinnamin. Whole family loved.

easy and yummy. I used 10oz. of Trader Joe's 72% cacao Belgian chocolate and reduced the sugar to 1/2c. which produced a perfectly chocolaty, not-too-sweet frosting. After a couple of hours in the fridge, a great consistency for getting a really gorgeous looking cake!

Rich and chocolatey but I did find it a bit sweet and had already reduced the sugar to half a cup. I used Scharffenberger semisweet and unsweetened chocolates. Also didn't add the instant coffee b/c it was a kid's party and added only 1 tsp cinnamon. I might add coffee next time to cut the sweetness.

We made this frosting for vanilla cupcakes and it's exceptional. Smooth, rich - it easily could be a dessert on its own. We did not use all the powdered sugar - add it slowly and taste until you get the sweetness you are looking for.

I made this frosting without reading the other reviews, and the cinnamon was extremely overpowering. I will make it again, but reduce the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp

I threw away two other batches of chocolate frostings before trying this one. It was great. I cut down the coffee to 1 t (since I didn't want a "mocha frosting") and I reduced the cinnamon to 1.5 teaspoons. I thought it still had a pretty strong cinnamon taste, and next time I would reduce it to 1 t., at most. Very good frosting consistency and chocolate flavor. Also, to speed up the "cool down" time, put the frosting bowl over another bowl filled with ice water and whisk--it will cool down very quickly.

When I made this my guests went wild! Great mocha/fudge flavor, and the consistency was perfect for a vanilla bean cake! I will make it a hundred times more, and it will never get old.

I made this today. The cinnamom is overwhelming, The recipe calls for 4 tsp. Next time I will use 1/2 tsp and that should be plenty. Good consistency.

This frosting was fabulous, and I am not a frosting fan. Loved the mocha flavor. I made it to top brownies for a co-worker's b- day and for a 4th of July party. Both times I got rave reviews and it was the frosting that was the hit.

After being a pastry chef for 2 years, I've made lots of icings and this is hands down one of the best. If your looking for a great mocha frosting this is it. If you want a basic fudge flavor, leave out the coffee and you have that too. Do not skip the cinnamon though. Excellent!!

Rating: 3
The frosting is pretty good. The reason I'm giving it 3 forks is that the coffee is a little too overpowering & I only added 1/2 the amount stated. I didn't use any cinnamon. Frosting has a great spreading consistency after cooling - it sets up nicely after being refrigerated, too. I used it on a Devil's Food cake with a raspberry truffle filling.

I used this frosting for chocolate cupcakes and thought it was really good. I only used 1 teaspoon of the cinnamon but barely noticed it. Try this one out, it's yummy.

MMM, so so so good, i made 1/3 of the recipe and used dark chocolte and some hersheys kisses! it turned out so good! the coffe flavor was very strong but i liked it. i did not add the cinnimon though. it had a gread texture. i will diffinatly be making this again and putting it on anything, and everything that needs fudgy frosting! i put it on the 'fudgy chocolate brownies' it was a grand combo! (sorry for posting this on the other one, im very sleepy!)

Oh my! Delicious frosting and you get a good amount to spread all over your cake! I like cinnamon - I put it in my hot cocoa - but I saw 4 teaspoons and nearly choked at the thought. A typo, perhaps? I used a quarter teaspoon and it was perfect. The second perfection was using an eighth teaspoon which gave a wonderful depth to the flavour without anybody quite knowing why!

I also left out the cinnamon and coffee powder, used 10 oz of good bittersweet chocolate and reduced the granulated sugar to 1/2 cup. Better than expected! Deep, dark, rich and chocolate-y, easy to work with.

The first time I made this, I added the cinnamon and it was absolutely disgusting. I made it again today and added NO cinnamon and it was fabulous. I used it on a banana layer cake and it was a great success. I used all bittersweet chocolate and no semi sweet or unsweetened. I have found that if you put the leftovers in the microwave for a few seconds, it makes a marvelous chocolate sauce for ice cream, pound cake, cheesecake and fruit.

very tasty. i too, left out cinnamon. also made half recipe as jennifer in melbourne suggested, was enough to adequately cover 2 layers (we dont like a ton of frosting). only took 35 minutes in fridge for frosting to get too stiff to spread, could've just left it out at cool room temperature and it wouldve been fine... but its pretty cool in my house. solid recipe, will definetly make again. maybe cinnamon is 1/4 teaspoon.. who cares.. dont need it...

I found this frosting too strong and I only added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, I can't imagine what the flavour would be with 4 teaspoons. I would make this one again, but I would omit the cinnamon and I would half the quantities, far too much frosting for one cake

My family loved this frosting - it's rich and creamy just like fudge! But I would suggest getting rid of the cinammon because it's too strong for the chocolate.
