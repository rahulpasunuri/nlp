Made this for Easter brunch. There was very little left over and someone took the leftovers home. Nothing but raves, requests for the recipe, and orders for the next family gathering.

Delicious! A great classic French asparagus presentation. I like to skip putting the asparagus in ice water and just put the vinaigrette on the warm spears. I then serve it at room temperature. This is also fabulous with white asparagus which is defintely worth the splurge.

This IS a fabulous recipe! The dressing is delicious and a snap to make. I took one cooks advice and doubled the dressing and marinated over night. A keeper for sure!

No matter what else I am bringing, my family always asks me to bring this dish to dinner parties. I've tried making it with extra sauce a day ahead and refrigerating it - the asparagus soaks up the sauce and tastes even more delicious.

This is the dish that made me like asparagus :-) Have made it a couple times now and have finally figured out that asparagus only takes *seconds* to cook - anything more can make it too flabby. The vinaigrette is great with other veggies too, like green beans, even brussel sprouts. Makes a lovely Easter side dish!

Yum, Yum, Yum! I used regular onion and dried taragon with a little fresh chives and it was unbelievable! This is definitely a keeper!

Delicious. Didn't have tarragon or shallots at home, so I omitted the shallots and used basil in lieu of tarragon. Turned out great! I'll definately make this again soon.

Wonderful flavor! I substituted scallions for the shallots and used dried tarragon (1/4 t) b/c I didn't have any fresh tarragon and it turned out delicious. Will become a staple around my house.

Very easy to make and the vinaigrette will keep in the fridge for several days. I don't bother with the egg any more.

I'm not a huge asparagus fan, but I this wasn't half bad. My guests raved about it, though, so I gave it four forks on their behalf. I couldn't find sherry vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. We felt that the hard boiled egg was lost in the dish and was really unnecessary.

I'm in love with the vinagrette sauce. I definitely recommend using fresh herbs on this one.

I would actually give it 10 forks...not just 4! Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe and I've made it for many people! I always forget the egg but after reading the reviews, I will try it next time.

This recipe actually made asparagus taste good! My picky husband like it, too, and it was also delicious the next day. I don't have steamer utensils, so I microwaved as per microwave cookbook instructions and the asparagus came out perfectly.

I made this exactly as directed and was thrilled. Fabulous taste and great presentation just as another rater commented. Two local markets had no fresh tarragon. I added a very small amount of dried tarragon, and it was fine.

Made this last night. It is excellent - my husband really loved it. The vinaigrette is wonderful (especially with the tarragon) and the eggs just taste great with the whole mixture. This would probably be good served cold. Anyone tried it that way?

Wonderful recipe. Great for company. I just chopped the egg instead of pushing through the seive. Great spring flavors!!!

This has become a family favorite. It presents beautifully and the taste is incredible. Don't be turned off by the egg. We made two dishes the first time one with and one without and we all agreed it was better with the egg. I would also encourage using the fresh tarragon; dried works but it lacks a bit in flavor. We'll be having this...again...this holiday and no one is complaining; it was requested :)

WOW!! This was so easy to make and was absolutely wonderful. The sauce is an excellent complement to Asparagus. STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE.

WONDERFUL RECIPE, SINCE I DID NOT HAVE SHERRY VINEGAR I SUBSTITED WINE VINEGAR. VERY REFRESHING TASTE, WE LOVED IT

Wonderful! God eats His asparagus with tarragon and so should we. The seived egg is the crowning touch. Wonderful!

This was very good. I served it at a dinner party and only one person didn't care for it because she doesn't like tarragon. If you like asparagus, you must try this one. It's easy to prepare the sauce in advance and cook the asparagus at the last minute - perfect for entertaining.

Delicious flavors that serve to accentuate the delicacy of the asparagus

What a great change from hollandaise sauce!!! The tarragon really makes the difference! I made this for a small family Sunday dinner to try it out and will definetly use this as a side dish for an elegant dinner party!! Thanks.

I served this recipe to my vegan parents on their anniversary. They absolutely loved it! My mom wanted to steam it in a steamer instead of on a steamer rack. Don't do that. It came out "over-steamed." But, the flavor was still amazing!

Made this, exactly as recipe shows, for Christmas dinner buffet. Everyone loved it. Served this along with Lamb w/ Olive and Rosemary, Duck with Prunes and Red Cabbage and the Trio of Roasted Potatoes, all from this site--and some sauteed broccoli. One of my best holiday diiners yet.

I made this dish for some "non" asparagus people, and they loved it. It was very easy to make the sauce, 5 minutes, but make sure the aspatagus is cold. Also for a nice touch I tied up the asparagus on each plate with a chive for a nice touch. I will make this dish many more times.

Very good. Very French. Delicious with white or green asparagus. The chopped egg balances the dish.

YUMMY! Made this recipe for Ladie's Night Out, and everyone requested the recipe! The taste is light, without overpowering the asparagus, and the egg is a MUST DO, as it helps absorb the vinaigrette and adds flavor to the dish and color to the presentation. A new favorite!

Delightful...the egg is a nice touch. Even better as leftovers.

a good basic idea for asparagus, which really needs very little adornment. The egg was a nice touch. Simple and elegant. Served this at easter dinner with roast prime rib of beef and garlic mashed potatoes. Simple, easy and fast.
