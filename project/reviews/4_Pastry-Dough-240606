I've always been intimedated about making doughs or pastries because I've always thought that it's to difficult for me to make. So I never really tried. I finally got the nerve to do it and made this dough and it came out right. I'm so proud of myself.Probably not a big deal to most of the cooks on here but I'm not a great cook, a good cook yes, but not great. thanks for this recipe.

Tasty, flaky...better than store bought!

Very flaky. I would recommend using pie weights, as it puffed and melted a bit during cooking.

Best crust recipe I've found so far! And I've done a lot of pie making, always with homemade crusts. The directions are nicely written, too, so I think even if you haven't made a ton of crusts on your own you can get this one right on the first try! I use this recipe for all my pies.

I have always had issues with making pie crust. It falls apart, it breaks, it doesn't hold together, among other issues, but this dough is nothing like those problem recipes I've made in the past. Help together beautifully, didn't break apart when I picked it up to press it into the tart pan, and it bakes up so buttery and flaky, almost like puff pastry! This is my new standard for making pie crust!

This makes a great dough-Perfect for a last minute tart!

Easy and flaky. I especially like the technique of smearing the dough to make it stick together (one of my bug-a-boos).

Perfect results and easy if done in food processor.
