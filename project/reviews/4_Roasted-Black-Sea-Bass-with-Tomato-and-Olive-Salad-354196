So easy and delicious, but great tomatoes are key here. I used a combination of various cherry tomatoes and heirloom tomatoes from my garden and it was out of this world good. I'd definitely make this for a casual summer dinner party or a regular family meal.

3 1/2 forks. Very good, added extra garlic and some white wine while roasting. Great dish, and so easy!!

This was easy, quick and delicious. We served on a weeknight for a casual dinner with friends. Used halibut as it was all we could buy fresh. I didn't have kitchen string but no problem just placing one fillet on top of the other. Yum!

I rarely cook and this, for me, was a "fancy" recipe -- something I have to be feeling ambitious to bother with. It ended up so well, the SO and I were thrilled! A few changes: I added a little extra garlic, substituted roasted red peppers for sundried tomatoes (because I don't really like sundried tomatoes), used white balsamic vinegar (because I felt like it), no anchovy paste, and tied it together with beading string (no kitchen string in my house - I briefly considered dental floss!). I also threw the tomato salad in the pan for the last 5 minutes or something, because I preferred the idea of a warmed accompaniment. I highly recommend the bit of extra effort -- this dish not only tastes fantastic, it looks fancy and exciting in the end, as if you're a real cook!!

Great recipe! I made the tomato-olive salad in a pan to make it a warm salad. Served this with crusty bread using basil rouille from another recipe on this site. It was delicious. Healthy, light, and satisfying.

I used tilapia instead and it was great (no other changes). Easy and rave reviews...I love it!

This was amazing -- I did use Black Cod instead of sea bass but that was the only change I made. The tomato/olive salad was fantastic -- I sliced stuffed olives and used sun dried black olives along with red grape tomatoes and yellow cherry tomatoes for a very colorful plate. Served with Asiago potatoes. Let's see SO said Best Fish Ever, Best Salad Ever, Best Potatoes Ever -- hmmm definitely a hit! Will definitely make again.

Excellent! Made this last night with halibut fillets and got rave reviews. The salad was a great match with the fish. I omitted the anchovies and made a balsamic vinaigrette for the tomato salad. Served with the Rice with Fennel and Raisin. Top notch and quick. One of the best recipes I've found from Epi in a while!

This was excellent with steelhead trout. Made it exactly as described and got rave reviews - the salad is great, too.

Excellent dish, hubby loved! Sea bass wasn't available so I used Haddock. Eliminated anchovy paste and garlic in salad and substituted Balsamic Vinegar for the red wine vinegar. Wonderful, rich and interesting flavors. Would be great with any mild white fish.

So, a couple of things: I had no anchovy paste or red-wine vinegar for the salad. I instead used some smoked fish in oil called 'Riga Smokies' that come from Lativa ... not sure of the fish that is in them, it is not the overpowering nasty fish taste that comes from can'd fish, the taste is equal to smoked tuna - not heavy, and very nice. You can find these in Germany in your local Real. I also used some gourmet salad vinegar, 3/4 of which to replace the red-wine, and the last 1/4 of apple cider. And I added a cucumber to the salad. The salad came out very nice. The grouper filets had no skin. Instead I folded/tied a single filet across the oregano sprigs, and a diced shallot, and baked, flipping in the glassware so it would cook evenly. Pepper with Love dancing and singing and nip'n on tequilla while in the kitchen. The end reslult was great. Served with some White Magic seasoned-butter fried sea scallops, steamed brussel sprouts (salt and vinegar on the table to enchance), and rosemary potatoes. Even the 3 year- old ate it :-) ~ NCF

Made this with a striped bass I caught the day before and used toothpicks to hold the halves together instead of string. Like the cook from Berkley, I tossed in capers, and went heavier on the olives. Also made the Fennel and Golden Raisin Salad. Big hit with friends! One of the best I've made in a while. Trying extra hard to catch another striper so I can make this again. Great recipe.

Made the salad and served it with steamed cod to save time. It was wonderful!

Beautiful presentation and yummy with the suggested "Rice with Fennel and Golden Raisin" recipe from the magazine article. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and would suggest the rich , slightly sweet vinegar over the red wine vinegar with the flavor of the suggested rice dish.

This was delicious and super easy. I actually poached the sea bass on the grill in tin foil with some white wine, olive oil, lemon, and oregano. I kept the salad and added some grilled red onion and capers. It was very fresh and a perfect summer meal that took no time at all. I will definitely make this again.
