Wow! This is a great recipe. I also added zucchini to the kebabs. I think it would have been a little light on substance without it. I thought shrimp would make a nice addition, but that was a mistake; the swordfish was so tender and delicious and paired so well with the bacon... No sense mixing mediocrity with greatness! Next time I'll use only swordfish. An excellent recipe!

This is a great way to have swordfish! You would think the bacon would overpower it, but it really tastes great. I made skewers of fish, par boiled mini potatoes, grape tomatoes, pearl onions and bacon and it was outstanding. My relatives can't wait for me to make this again!

These were delicious and very simple! Brushing with bacon fat really added a good flavor! I also added zuchinni chunks as I had a bunch to use up. Very good, simple recipe!

This recipe was amazing! I substituted some of the tomatoes for red and orange peppers and much preferred the peppers over the tom's. They tend to get a little mushy on the bbq. Served with brown basmati rice..yummmers!

Excellent! I interwove the par-cooked bacon with the chunks of swordfish and used chunks of roma tomatos. First, I tossed the tomato and fish in olive oil with 1/2 tsp minced garlic and a bit of pepper. Skewered and placed on BBQ grill for 3-4 minutes on each side. Turned off grill and let them sit for 5 min. I took reserve bacon grease and mixed with remains of marinade and 2 tsps melted butter. Heated that mix and poured over skewers and served. It was FABULOUS!!! Would be great served over pilaf or pasta. My 10 yr old gobbled it!

Guests RAVED. they would probably say 4 forks! I made a few changes, added about 3 T of Flat leaf parsley and 1 t of lemon thyme, and the kosher salt a pepper and I made it for 6, so more garlic too (4 cloves). I did have to cook a lot longer than the 4 min a side, malybe close the grill cover and that would work?? I cooked the bacon about 4 min a side! ANd I also threaded the bacon like a ribbon around the swordfish. that really seamed to keep it moist. Was even good reheated! Not too many fish recipes can say that!

Delicious. I added a sprinkle of rosemary and ground sage to the olive oil, lemon juice, garlic mixture.

Thought this was a great *basic* recipe. I made it with halibut and used rosemary sprigs as skewers. Thinking that the bacon and rosemary would flavor it, I went against my instinct to throw on some kosher salt and pepper. Next time I will. I also used only four slices of bacon (I don't know what I would have done with more). I cut the bacon in 1 1/2 inch pieces. I guess if I had used the 8 strips, I would have cut them in much larger pieces so they would practically *wrap* around the fish. I'm excited to try it again with changes - it will be a summer regular. Served it with boiled new potatoes tossed in olive oil and rosemary, and a minted peach salad with brie.

OH MY GOD, MY HUSBAND COOKED DINNER! This was fabulous, great pure flavors. It would be perfect for the midweek dinner party or for a large group. The bacon was cut into 1-2" pieces before being threaded and mushrooms were added. I could eat this once a week and its relatively low fat!

If you like bacon, this recipe is excellent. The hardest part is frying the bacon to the right consistency, don't over do it. It will cook on the grill. Otherwise, very easy and very good.
