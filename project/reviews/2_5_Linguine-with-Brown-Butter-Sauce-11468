Perfectly dependable; nothing special, but I could tell that from the ingredients and preparation. It's a great way to use up leftover yogurt, though!

It tasted fine, but for what it is ... you would be better just to toss butter and herbs with hot linguini and save yourself the trouble (and the clean-up) of going through the steps.

This is a great week night dish! It comes together very quickly with ingredients that are commonly found in the pantry. Have to admit I used dried parsley instead of fresh, but the flavor was wonderful. I put off a little with the yogurt in the recipe, but you really don't taste it, and it adds a richness to the dish. My kids loved it, and I will defintely be making this again!

Made this recipe while on vacation with 10 friends. All of them raved about it!
