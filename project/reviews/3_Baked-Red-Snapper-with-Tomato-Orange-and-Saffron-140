Easy, easy, easy and very good...a winner! I thought I had saffron, but alas...the cupboard was bare, so I went without, but added a few capers to the pan sauce before spooning over and serving with Jasmine rice/asperagus.

Really liked this dish. Added an extra pinch of saffron. Quick, easy, no fuss. Served it over rice. This dish has a great sauce, and is likely completely different if you leave out the saffron.

I loved the flavor of the sauce, and the fish, but not together. I made rice and served the sauce with that. It sounded really good on paper, but just didn't do it for me in reality. With all the wonderful snapper recipes out there, I wouldn't make this again.

To cook from Atlanta: How do I access the recipe "fish filets dijon"? It is not at this site under that name.

I would give this one a 2.5 if I had the choice. The dish was good -- but not as good as most other fish recipes I've found on this site......and considering the price of saffron -- well, it just wasn't THAT tasty. I probably won't make this one a "regular". My favorite easy "fish dish" is "Fish Filets Dijon" -- everyone should try it!

Oh my gosh, I just made this for dinner because I bought red snapper at the store today and it is fabulous! This is the easiest and best recipe I've ever gotten off of here, plus I happened to have all the ingredients on hand which is nothing short of miraculous!!

Nice light dish for a weekday. I made the sauce first on the stovetop and let it stand for half an hour or so so the flavors could mingle. We ate it with a salad made of grated carrots, olive oil, sherry vinegar, honey, and toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on top.

I like this because it was quick and easy to make as well as healthful. I added two garlic cloves, used mostly shallot combined with onion to equal 1/4 c total. If you season the sauce with sea salt and freshly ground pepper after it cooks 15 minutes and season the fish well with the same before cooking (and some after),it is much better. I can see how the other reviewers did not like it if they did not season well.

I followed this recipe exactly and it was ghastly. We took about two bites and tossed it in the garbage. Seriously. Everything was fresh, we love seafood but this was horrid.

I was quite disappointed in this dish. It lacked flavor. I think instead of baking this dish, it may be beter to pan sear the fish and simmer the ingredients on top of the stove. For example, I would coat the fish in flour, then add a little bit of olive oil to the pan. Cook both side about 50% done. Then I would add the above ingredients, and simmer for about 5 minutes. Then add the fish back in. The flour will make the sauce a little thicker and I think a bit more tasty.

I have made this dish twice in a week! This is a definite success. Wonderful fresh flavors all together, and try not to forget the saffron. The orange zest is also very important for the bit of perk that it adds. This is easy because of the one dish and oven time - no baby-sitting the stove top! Definitely must have some bread to soak up the juices when you're done! Beautiful, delicious and very impressive dish.

This recipe made a fish eater out of my girlfriend, who HATES anything that even looks like fish. I made it without the Saffron, as I forgot to put it in, and added a tablespoon of some good quality garlic-chili paste. This is a great recipe for a lowfat meal, and even if you make it for someone who doesn't like fish, they'll like this one. Will be making this again, and often!

this had to be one of the most boring dishes i've ever made. really quite bland. i took someone else's suggestion and added a jalapeno during the cooking, which helped a bit. seems a fair choice if you're looking for really light, healthful dishes, but, even then, i think there are more flavorful recipes to be tried.

An excelent dish for the fish lover! Substituted green onions for normal onion and did not use saffron. Perfect served with Jasmine rice. Also included Epicurious' recipe for Green Beans with Lemon as a second side. The blend of the citrus flavors was extremely pleasurable to the palete.

I really liked the recipe. However, I agree with your other reviewers that it needs to be spicier. I jazzed it up a bit with a few dashes of Tabasco Sauce and about 1/2 tablespoon of creole seasoning.

Very light, colorful fish dish. We made it with Walleye Pike because Red Snapper is hard to come by in this part of the world. I thought that the dish could use a little more garlic and/or maybe some cayenne or other hot pepper to make it a little spicer. Most others liked it just the way it was. A definite keeper.

A dish beyond compare... Trying to eat healthy these days is more challenging then ever. This recipe is definetely for keeps especially because my husband kept praising my cooking talents - little does he know it was so easy to make ;-)

we used halibut steaks instead of snapper fillets and I expect orange roughy would be good too.also, more garlic would be good but only if you're staying home.....alone.

What a great easy dish that tastes wonderful! and is low-cal.

very quick and simple. next time, i'd add a little more garlic & onion. also try a pinch of crushed red pepper. my husband suggested throwing in a whole jalapeno pepper during the first baking period, then removing it before adding fish. yum!
