A wonderful recipe! Especially when made with homemade stocks. I had some truffle butter so I used it to finish the sauce. Fabulous! 01/10/11

Excellent recipe. Great stock for the sauce. Truly wonderful use of black truffles. Paired with an appetizer of omlette with truffle, and made truffled mashed potatoes and truffled gravy as the side. It was a truffle feast with the duck as the star of the show.

I have not made this recipe yet - but just to confirm - did you all use wild rice? Any particular additions or recommendations?

My husband is a huge duck fan. I made this for him for his birthday in 2006 and he has requested it for his birthday dinner every year since then. I'm usually making the recipe for at least 8 people and it all comes together very easily. It's a must to make the dish with the rest of the menu (rice and carrots). The flavors all meld together beautifully.

I am a vegetarian and decided to surprise my boyfriend with this for valentines day. Made it exactly according to recipe (as couldn't taste it!). My boyfriend went nuts over this! He has been asking for it every night since V-day. He called his Mom and told her how wonderful it was! For duck lovers, this is a must!

The flavor explodes in your mouth. One of the best dishes I have ever made.

Oue dinner group made the entire red wine pairing menu from the Feb. '06 issue of B.A. and this duck recipe was stellar. I used the Moulard breasts from www.dartagnan.com and would definitely buy from them again. The sauce was beautiful. I would definitely recommend serving with the accompanying recipes (lentils and wild rice and the roasted carrots with thyme). Everything went together so well. We served different wines at dinner, with my personal fav. being a 200 Testarossa Pinot Noir. All in all...a memorable evening!
