I've been making this for a few years now. Easy to make, always a hit. You can skip the tablespoon of sugar :)

I made a few changes to this recipe as I didn't like the Fuji apples at the store, used Gala apples in place, also instead of sugar used splenda and added cinnamon. Turned out great, there is hardly anything left

Just returned from an orchard with my boys and wanted to make something fresh with our apples. This applesauce was perfect! So easy. I like the low sugar content and the chunky bits of fresh apple. I am going to try freezing some. We also made the apple pear crostata w/ five spice whipped cream. WOW!

This is the only applesauce recipe I make. I use whatever apple's we have on hand or when we have purchased to much. I freeze it in containers, so it's always on hand

i think this recipe was good for a lite snack when you don't want to be filled up. You should add some cinnamon to the apple sauce to give it a needed spice. It's good to be spread lightly on pancakes or toast, but it shouldn't be eaten plain.

I made this recipe a while ago, and now that i found it again i will definately do it again, it was very refreshing.

This recipe is so easy and tasty. I also like the fact that there is little sugar added to it.

I could not believe how easy it was to make this (and my family was so impressed that I made applesauce from scratch). I did not add any sugar as one of my dinner guests is diabetic, but found that the apples were sweet enough on their own anyway. I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top before serving - everyone liked it!

This was very simple and very good. I used a couple of pears instead of 2 apples, also added some cinnamen. It tasted better cold.

I've enhanced the flavors by eliminating water and sugar. Simply adding 1/2 tsp. salt contributes to a more complex sauce. It's wonderful in both savory and sweet recipes. Idyllic!

This is my second time making this recipe, and I just used up a bunch of old apples I had ... maybe 10 or so. I don't even know what kind they were. It's SO SIMPLE. My mother takes a whole day and does the canning thing.... I just make this whenever I feel like having fresh applesauce. (Who works harder? Definitely HER!) Highly recommended.

Much better than any store-bought applesauce. It was absolutely delicious--not too sweet. Definitely a dish beyond compare.

Nice and chunky and not too sweet. I prepared it on the stove with a little more water. Really good!

This is the most simple, yet delicious applesauce. I eliminated all sugar and it was still sweet.
