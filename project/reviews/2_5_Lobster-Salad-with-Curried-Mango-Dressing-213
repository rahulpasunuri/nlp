I took the other's advice and also cut the curry down to about 1/2 tsp. but I thought it wasn't enough so I guess all have their individual tastes. I also had the challenge of a wife that doesn't like lobster and a guest that can't eat seafood of any kind which I didn't know until she got there. So I set out the salad with a bowl of grilled shrimp, the lobster and a grilled sliced portobello mushroom and all 3 were a huge hit! Next time I'll still likely cut down on the curry but not all the way down to 1/2 tsp.

This dressing sounded so good, that I skipped the lobster and simply served the dressing on a salad of greens. I also thought there was too much curry in the recipe, so I decreased it to 1/2 tsp and it was perfect. Now I'll try this on some lobster!

This was a summery and fresh idea. I didn't think I could go wrong with these ingredients but there was TOO MUCH CURRY POWDER. It overpowered the lobster - and what's the point of that? I may try it again with 1 tsp of curry powder - and maybe shrimp just in case I still don't love it. I used orange juice instead of mango juice and I used the tail and the claws.
