Great "new" way to do baked potatos. Was serving a fish entree that had a complex sauce and wanted simpler sides. I did use less butter and only topped with grated parmesan.

I added parmesan to the breadcrumbs, and they turned out great! Hint: really make sure you get the butter and salt in between each section, otherwise they fuse together! This also helps to flavour the entire potato.

This recipe is similar to one in Gourmet in the mid 90's where the potatoes were prepared the same but braised in chicken stock and butter. I took enough sliver off so the potato was flat on the board ene to end. Then used bamboo skewers 1/8" dia. Also I used buttered fresh breadcrumbs. Delicious!!

An older version of this recipe that I have used includes placing the potatoe on a large spoon to facilitate the cuts. Fresh grated parm or similar cheese is used to top the potatoe. Simple, and with a few fresh herbs added at the end, a good side for roasted meats or fish.

Easy to prepare but very boring. Needed extra baking time and less time under the broiler. The presentation was nice, however.

This recipe was easy, but not very interesting. I needed a longer cook time to get my potatoes soft and a shorter broil time to keep my bread crumbs from burning. I would add more bread crumbs next time because the add much of the texture and the flavor to the potatoes (the crumbs do a better job absorbing the butter than the potatoes do). One nice thing about the recipe is that it's easy to make for any number of people without too much mental mathematics.
