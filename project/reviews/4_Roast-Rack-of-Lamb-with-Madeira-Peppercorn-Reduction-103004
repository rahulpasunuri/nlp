Quite good. Made with chicken. Used half of peppercorn.

Love the recipe!! Although I changed it around a bit. I like browning the rack of lamb before putting it in the oven. This way I can guarantee a crispy exterior. I also use a heavy skillet. It was a bit messy to get the shallots to go through the press and I did not think it really added that much additional taste. I get the New Zealand rack of lamb for this and it is always fabulous!

This is a delicious rack of lamb recipe. Easy to make - the sauce is wonderful!

Excellent and very easy to make. The sauce is fabulous. I cooked it in my cast iron frying pan which I think works better than a cookie sheet/shallow pan especially when it comes to raising the temp. to 500 degrees. This is the best rack of lamb we've made and we'll definitely make it again. The sauce would be delicious with steak.

Very delicious and very easy to prepare. We made the whole amount of sauce for a single rack. One of my favorite lamb recipes.

Excellent recipe! I've made it 3 times! The last time I had dinner guests on a weekday, so I cooked the lamb in the crock-pot for 7 hrs. with a can of beef broth and made twice the sauce, I could not believe how tender and juicy it was! Prep time was: 10 min. to season the rack and put it in the crock pot and 15 min. to make the sauce. By far the best lamb recipe ever!

Fabulous and easy. Like other reviewers I made the same amount of sauce for just one rack. I also used more shallots and cooked a few minutes longer because I live at 9000 feet. Was like a $35.00 entree at a fine French restaurant.

WONDERFUL DISH! I made this for my boyfriend and he was very impressed and raved about it for days. It was easy and the presentation was beautiful on the plate....restaurant quality for sure. Definitely double the sauce and make it ahead of time so you are not rushing in the end.

excellent and so easy to prepare . Notice that the recipe says boil 12 minutes to "reduce to cup"..I think it must mean 1/2 or 1/3 cup. 12 minutes of boiling will reduce 1 1/4 cup of liquid way below 1 cup. I did 1/2 cup and it seemed just right

I used only one rack (to serve 2) but made the full sauce recipe and had only a bit leftover. I could not find peppercorns in brine (after 3 epicurean type stores) and just used a mixed peppered blend. Very good.

Knew I wanted to use lamb and found this great recipe for Valentines day 2002. I used chops and did them on the grill and held them in othe oven till ready. I did the madeira reduction early and had to add more before serving. My wife loved it and we will have it again.

Excellent! I made the full sauce recipe and one rack for 2 people. There was a little sauce leftover - it was soo good and really makes the lamb special. I used 1 less tablespoon butter and could probably have used even less and still gotten the rich flavor. I served this with the Warm Onion-Potato Gratin and Haricot Verts which were part of the menu. Definitely company worthy.

So easy! Sauce was rich and interesting with the lamb. Enjoyed by all. I love recipes I can prepare ahead and cook the last step at the time of serving.Served goat cheese potatoe gratin-also perfectly delicious & easy!

Very good, but not my favorite lamb dish. With all the other great recipes for lamb out there, I probably would not make again. It did impress my dinner guests though.

This was my first time preparing lamb and it was a hit for Valentine's. What a great alternative for all the lamb dishes with mint! Next time I may use more peppercorns.
