Super easy and delicious. The beet glaze makes it. The hardest part is finding the beet juice and a good ashed goat cheese.

The sandwich style assembly didn't make sense so we did one layer of red on top golden. We also didn't quite get the powder effect described. With those two qualifications, this recipe was fantastic. The reduction sauce (which did form large bubbles) was utterly magnificent. The mix of flavors and colors elicited rave reviews, and the "powder" which was more like a light grating, added to the sheer beauty of the dish.

I tried this recipe but preferred the beet salad with pistacios also found on epicurious. I tried making the beet powder and jiuce - take my advice and skip this part - not worth the effort for some plate beautification.

beets have never tasted so amazing... and so simple in its goal of tasting the flavor and nuances of the main ingrediant.

The recipe was good and simple to follow (especially for a Keller recipe). EXCEPT - the directions to make the beet glaze are obscure - i am trying it again, reducing the beet juice down to a 1/4, then adding the vinegar, then finishing the reduction - i never saw 'large bubbles'...
