I used this recipe as a springboard, since I had other veggies and opted not to use the balsamic vinegar in sauce and "underseasoned" for a sensitive relative. It came out really well using broccoli, cauliflower (poached in broth, then set aside) and red bell peppers. Got rave reviews all around, including how moist the chicken was. I think think that though it might not be the most aesthetic dish that I would still serve it to family and friends for a sit-down dinner.

Delicious sauce! We gobbled this right up. This was a last minute dish, so I didn't have many of the ingredients. I used only broccoli and scallions, and I pan-fried the polenta that comes in the tube. I'll definitely make it again.

This is a fabulous chicken dish. It may be a bit time consuming, but I love to cook so I don't mind as the result is soooo good. I also add other spring vegetables such as asparagus and baby squash with good results. The sauce is exceptional but once when I skimped on a lesser balsamic vinegar it was too strong as one reviewer claimed. Use a good balsamic vinegar and you will love the results. I have made this many, many times especially for company. Everyone always raves and asks for the recipe.

I used fresh fennel bulb instead of seed since I had it left over from another recipe. This was a great addition(saute with the onion and bell pepper). One reviewer took some heat for saying that this recipe took a lot of prep time and I have to agree. I love to cook, so am not put off by recipes that are time consuming, but realize going in that it will take a few hours to prepare (certainly more time than a stir fry). The flavors of this dish were excellent, although the gray sauce leaves a little something to be desired in presentation. If I were to make this dish again, I would drizzle the polenta cake with the sauce and top it with the chicken-vegetable mixture. Then I would sprinkle the dish with parsley. I don't think this is a dish for company because of the lack of inspiration in plating, but my husband loved the dish. My two year old turned his face away from his plate when I gave it to him, but he's in a fish-stick-or-nothing phase, so I didn't take that as a snub.

I couldn't disagree more with the last review; I've made this numerous times and get raves without fail. The amount of squash did look daunting the first time I made it, but it cooks down so much, I find the balance just right. As for the sauce--which makes the dish completely--it may not be the prettiest sauce, but it's absorbed so quickly, it hardly makes an aesthetic dent. Make this dish!

The balsamic sauce completely overwhelmed the dish. The cooking times were inaccurate and the amount of squash disproportionate. Also, the saute had a nice bright look to it until it was covered with the really unattractive brown sauce.

Wonderful combination of flavors. My husband loved it. I like recipes that I can make ahead and warm before serving. Although I agree that it was more work than some recipes, since I could make most of it ahead of time, it didn't seem so time consuming. It is well worth the time.

This dish was fantastic! My husband loved it. The dusting of flour on the chicken helped it to absorb the delicious basalmic vinegar sauce that had just the right balance of sweet and spicy.

The combination of flavors is great and dredging the chicken in flour gives it the perfect texture and moisture. My balsamic drizzle turned out a bit too liquid and I used the exact measure. I might thicken it next time by boiling/reducing the vinegar for a longer time. Unlike another reviewer, I think the preparation time was minimal -- about the same as doing a stir fry. I would serve this to guests.

Delicious! I broiled the polenta before serving it to give it a little bit of a crunchy texture (tasted good). I found that melting the flour with the butter before adding it to the vinegar sauce reduced the chance of it being lumpy. I will definitely make this recipe again!

Great flavors. Betty Rosbottom rarely fails. More time consuming than I would have thought. Didn't have any squash - it was fine. Made it for my husband and I - would definately make it for guests - if they could take strong flavors

Delicious! I added a "salad" of mushrooms and used Butter squash instead of crookneck squash (pre-cooked). Everybody loved it!

This was a delicious combination of flavors, with a savory sauce. Hearty without being overwhelming.

I am a Personal Chef, and I have made this for several of my clients, everyone loved it and most have asked me to make if for them again, I think the fennel seeds add a unique touch. Worth making!

Good flavor, a somewhat unique flavor with the fennel seed. Our guests said they really enjoyed it.
