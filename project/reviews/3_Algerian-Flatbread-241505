Perhaps I did something wrong, but this was a failure. 1. 1 1/2 cups of water was way too much liquid. I added one cup and then had to add another 1/2 cup of flour to make it (barely) kneadable. 2. The bread was tough, resembling cardboard. 3. The spiced oil had no flavor. 4. I fried up only have of the dough before giving up and turning the remaining dough over to the chickens.

I was excited to find a msemen recipe (although I had never had a spiced msemen in Morocco - we just ate them with honey or olive oil for breakfast)! I set out following this one to the letter, but had to add about 1/2 cup flour to get from sticky paste to a soft dough. I rolled them thin, spread the oil, and coiled them up, but to no avail - no flakes. The msemen I was used to in al Maghreb were fairly greasy, so next time I'll let the oil flow more freely.

my standard issue flat bread now. it was pretty easy to make. i've been eating with indian dishes too, better than paratha. i love olive oil.

This bread reminds me a bit of an Indian paratha. I used a combination of butter and olive oil and added a bit of cayenne. I followed the technique, which was very easy and it came out perfectly.

These were very good. They came out flakey and light with a gentle kiss of spices.

I am Algerian born and raised. My family didn't make msemen with spices, but this is very nice version. To the two Algerians who complained that it didn't seem authentic, typical Algerian griping, I say. If you see a recipe that's different what your mom made in the village or town you come from you claim that it's not "Algerian". Funny too, the chef already anticipated how opinionated we are. Excellent recipe, I will make it again.

Good, enough to have made an impression on me. They weren't so hard to make as they were to clean up after.

These are actually quite good. I'm not sure why other reviewers got a raw flour taste unless it's due to the addition of too much flour when rolling out. I agree with the other reviewer that oil is a better way to go. I simply used a large cutting board to roll them out on and the brushed on oil was enough to roll them out. I used a cast iron skillet to cook them, but you have to watch the temp. Because cast iron is such an efficient heat conductor, I did have to lower the heat so that the flatbreads wouldn't brown to quickly and not cook through thoroughly. Cooking them is not a far cry from cooking handmade tortillas. We ate these with the shrimp charmoula and it was quite lovely. My children (9 and 5) loved them as well. Whether or not these are "authentic" Algerian flatbreads, I don't know, but we thought they were tasty and not at all difficult to make.

I followed this recipe to a T and it was terribly disappointing--like eating browned raw flour.

I have to agree 100% with the girl form Florida. I am Algerian (born and raised there) and judging by the picture, it looks like a m'semen which isn't considered to be a bread. It is served for breakast or tea, with a drizzle of honey or butter. I was very pleased to see a whole section in this month's Gourmet issue devoted to Algerian cuisine. But I am desapointed that chef Ziadi is trying to make m'semen look like an Indian flatbread. I don't know why Chef Zadi did that as he usually present fairely authentic Algerian recipes on his blog. I am desapointed with this recipe. Let's be true to our culinary heritage Chef Zadi, please!

This bread is fantastic. It is so easy to make and so aromatic. I love to wrap greens and grains with this.

I can't rate this recipe, as I haven't made it, but I know how to make msemmen--the Moroccan kind, anyway--and in Morocco, it's NEVER made with cumin, paprika, or tumeric! I have a very good Algerian friend, and she's never heard of it made this way, either. Secondly, it is never served as a traditional "bread". By that, I mean that it isn't usually an accompaniment to a meal. It's usually eaten as a snack or at breakfast--with honey and butter, not spicy shrimp. Finally: I've never had success making msemmen on a floured surface-- oil is the way to go. It's not considered a low- calorie food. An amply oiled work surface is the only way to keep the dough from breaking as you stretch it out--which I do with my (oily) hands, not a rolling pin. That said, it could be this is a variant of msemmen that I've never heard of (especially since it's Algerian and my point of reference is Morocco), but I really don't think there's much of a difference between Moroccan and Algerian msemmen. (I don't mean to sound like a food snob, but when it comes to North African food, I tend to be very sensitive, having been to far too many "Moroccan" restaurants where I was served falafel and hummus bi tahini--NOT MOROCCAN, MIDDLE EASTERN!) :) Just trying to "keep it real".

The most labor intensive and least appealing of the recipes in this otherwise excellent Gourmet feature. It tasted more like raw dough than bread. If you have a child around (or an inner child) who loves to play with dough you might want to try it anyway.
