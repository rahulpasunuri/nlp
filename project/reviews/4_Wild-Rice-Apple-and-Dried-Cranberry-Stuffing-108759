Perfect. Everyone loved it. Peeled the apple and used 1-1/2 C chicken broth as others did. We had many side dishes so it was enough for 16 servings.

The fam insisted I return to this recipe after I veered from the true meaning of Thanksgiving and tried some cockamamie bacon-fennel-leek dressing last year.. This is the recipe that shall not be changed. Doubled it made 2 9X13's and enough to stuff a 20 pounder, but my measurements are always a bit off. I used 3 boxes of prepared bread cubes, because I'm lazy that way, but otherwise followed pretty exactly. YUM!

Was looking for a recipe for stuffing that was reduced bread (carbs) and not fully rice to try and please my Thanksgiving guests. This is a nice combination. Made the rice 3 days before and kept refrigerated. Made the rest the day before so it really came together with seemingly little effort. Once assembled I tasted it and found it to be very bland and I started to get worried. I added an additional apple (Granny Smith), an additional cup of rice, some sauted mushrooms, and ended up tripling the herbs. This really seemed to perk it up. The mushrooms added an earthy flavor that helped to balance the sweet. Because mine had a heavy rice component it did not bind well. I added an egg with the broth just before cooking to try to counter this but it didn't seem to do much. We found the stuffing to taste good, a nice balance of sweet and savory--it disappeared so I'm happy. I would make this again with my above adjustments. And maybe add bacon (everything's better with bacon).

I really enjoyed making this recipe. I used olive oil instead of butter. Also added sausages from Trader Joe's to it. I will definitly make it again.

Only 2-3 forks as written--that is how I made this the first time. The second time I used shallots instead of onions and diced dried apricot (natural/unsulphured) intead of dried cranberries. We liked it better this way--more interesting/less sweet.

Great base recipe for stuffing. For a gluten free variation, we eliminated the bread and used an extra half cup of rice instead. We also added 1 lb of Italian Sausage cooked separately and put in at the mixing bowl stage. Sage is a key ingredient for this recipe, so you can even bump it up a 1/4. Finally, you can also use just one onion and add an extra apple in its place. My kids loved this recipe so much that the stuffing is the leftover they want the most!

This is a fantastic stuffing for the holidays or weekend. It is a very lengthy process so start early. Flavors are perfect. Will consider adding crumbled, cooked sage sausage next time.

BTW, as the reviewer below noted, this is a very economical recipe to prepare. The most expensive part was the canned wild rice; and even that was not much more than the boxed kind. It fed a good 15 people. Even if I doubled the recipe, it wouldn't have cost more than $25.

I made this for Thanksgiving last week, and every bit was eaten! Sourdough bread proved a good choice for the crumbs. Also, I found canned prepared wild rice (who knew?) which cut down on prep time. Added chopped dried apricots instead of cranberries. This is not a stuffing that sticks together or gets gloppy. Since my husband likes his stuffing "bound," next time I might make an extra batch with a couple of eggs mixed in to keep it together. A delicious combination of flavors!

Yum! My mom and I don't like sausage stuffing and our menfolk do, so we always make 2 stuffings. This will be our new non-sausage stuffing. All the right flavors, not too sweet, delicious.

I was really happy with how this recipe turned out.. I made this up a day in advance to the point before adding the broth.. I added in the Jimmy Dean sage sausage- made a big difference! So fragrant and yummy! I used Trader Joe's Artisan whole grain bread for the best bread crumbs and "croutons" ever.. Can't wait for the leftovers tomorrow!!

I was looking for the perfect stuffing that could be baked outside the turkey, as we love the grilled brined turkey from Gourmet magazine. I use 1/2 the apples and cranberries, as it makes the recipe a bit sweet (my family prefers savory stuffing). Great Harvest Bread Company makes stuffing bread that I use every year for the bread cubes. I add 1 tube of Jimmy Dean sage sausage (browned before adding to other ingredients), and this is now the best stuffing Ive ever had. It could actually be a main dish casserole.

This recipe is really good. I cooked it in a slow-cooker and added 2 chopped red bell peppers and 1 can water chestnuts. I baked it for my family last year at Thanksgiving and it was plenty for over 30 people to try seconds!

Very good stuffing. At first, I thought that the sage might be a bit overpowering, but once the dish was cooked, it blended very well. The only thing that I changed was to add buttered bread crumbs to the top for presentation and crunch. The apples got a bit lost in the mix and next time I would add a bit more and maybe use Granny smiths for more tartness. A definite make again.

Made a double batch. Added mushrooms to the celery and onion saute. The mushrooms gave a nice meaty earthiness. After reading the other reviews I added some extra stock and it was a little wetter than I would've preferred. But My guests thought it was amazing. Will certainly make this again.

Pretty good. I used this to accompany a goose on Tday, with the cranberry and apple flavors a good complement to the prunes in the goose. Like others, I added the extra cup of broth, but since I did not put this stuffing in the bird, concluded it still might need a 1/2 c to a cup more than that. Mine turned out drier than I would like even with the extra cup of broth. I also added 1/2 lb of chopped pancetta and 3/4 cup of pinenuts for added flavor and texture. Probably a redo...

Like many have noted, this dish was well recieved. I have had requests to make it for this Thanksgiving (08). I added the extra cup of stock the first time I made it and I will do so again. I am also adding at least one additional cup of bread crumbs (sourdough is excellent-the flavor compliments the cranberries and herbs) since some did find the recipe to be a bit heavy on the rice. I agree. However, I have been looking forward to making it again since last year. I thank whomever shared it to begin with!

This was really wonderful. The bread is crisp and buttery and the rice adds a nutty depth to the stuffing.

Yummy! This recipe was a big hit with even the pickiest ones at my table! A bit different than your usual stuffing, but a nice way to enjoy the tastes of the season. I also liked the way it "tied" everything together, from the dried cranberry/nut cups I served as appetizers, to the seasonings used with the main dish (turkey) all the way through to the apple pie for dessert!

This is the best stuffing ever. We have a local bread store that makes a "stuffing bread" (a sage and onion heavy bread), that is the perfect bread for this dish. I also add a pound of browned Jimmy Dean's Sage sausage, which really enhances the earthy flavor. I use a whole 15 ounce can of chicken broth to combat dryness. WOW!!!

I made this last year and it went down a treat. I reduced the quantity of bread crumbs and added some roasted chestnuts for a nice christmassy feel; plus i THINK THEY HELPED WITH THE POTENTIAL DRYNESS.

Hands down the best item on the Thanksgiving table this year and best stuffing I've ever had. Used a whole wheat loaf and Smart Balance for a healthier dish. Excellent! Will be making this again next year.....

I have been making this stuffing recipe for the past four Thanksgivings. Everyone loves it and the leftovers are good for days. This year I am going to try adding an extra cup of stock since I also find that it comes out dry... always thought it was because I live in the desert.

I didn't think this was very good - it wasn't really a bread stuffing, but wasn't really a rice stuffing. I wouldn't make it again...

Made this a couple years in a row now. Even pick eaters or traditionalists love it.( I'd make it anyway cause I love it.) I think I needed to add abit more broth since we're a mile high, I think it was a bit dry the first time.

We used prepared stuffing cubes from a bag and added an extra cup of wild rice. The flavors hold together well and its still being eaten 6 days after Thanksgiving.

This tasted much better the next day - the cranberry flavor was more apparent, and the bread cubes were softer. If I make this again, I'll bake it the day before and just reheat it. I also had family members tell me that it needed more bread.

This was really tasty, and plentiful! We too used a multigrain bread, and cut the recipe in half, but still ended up with lots left over (but not because it wasn't nice). By the way, we peeled our apple, don't know if anyone else did as it's not called for in the recipe, and I would recommend others do the same.

We have made this dish three years in a row and love it more every year. It is the perfect stuffing recipe! The only thing we change is to use vegetable stock instead of turkey. And this year we used thick Texas style bread and it worked perfectly.

I used multigrain bread and cooked Quinoa instead of wild rice - this makes it a higher protein dish - and if you switch to vegetable broth, it's suitable for vegetarians.

Incredible! I received many compliments. I used a multigrain bread, Lundberg wild rice and mutsu (tart) apples. The pieces all need to be cut quite small.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe--I am still remembering how flavourful it was one year later as I look it up again. Received many compliments from it! I served it with Roast Turkey with Apple Cider gravy and it was a perfect complement.

No, not up to the hype. It wasn't set together like stuffing (I think) should be; it was like having 5 searate flavers that didn't gel.

Could you use this to stuff a pork crown roast? If so, would you add it to the roast for the last half hour or so of cooking time?

We used 2c of stock instead of one, and added an egg to the stock to minimize sogginess reported by others here. We used French bread with a poppy- and sesame-seeded crust. We baked the bread the day before as directed, and left it dry in the warm oven overnight. This stuffing was even better the next day after it was reheated - the apple and cranberry flavors had a chance to soak into the bread.

A great change from bread-based stuffing. The wild rice provides a wonderful flavor and chewiness that compliments both meat and fowl. Very well-received by my guests. I used sourdough bread, and the cubes did not "blend" into the stuffing as did the rest of the ingredients. This doesn't really affect the taste, but next time I'll either use less bread, or 1.5 cups of broth.

I chose this as it was not too risky but more interesting than the average stuffing. I stuffed the bird with it, and my guests voted it as their favorite dish of the day. Nice complexity without being too fancy pants. We'll use this with roast chicken too.

I like the texture of this stuffing, a bit chewy from the wild rice and sweet/sour from apply and cranberries. I substitute all butter w/ olive oil and cut them to 2/3 of the original recipe calls for. I also used 2 cups of chicken stock instead of 1 cup. Came out great. Since you can cook the wild rice and dried the bread ahead of time, it really makes it easier to make. Will make it again soon.

A most fabulous start to what will be a great recipe. The white bread is mushy. Not pleasing to eye because it looks like fat and has similar consistency. Next time I will cut down the amt of bread and substitute with a dark crusty loaf, like squaw or wheat. Also I'll chop the bread into tiny pieces to avoid the squishy texture. The flavors of the dish blend beautifully making a great addition to a holiday meal, especially Thanksgiving.

My mother and I made this recipe last night for an early Thanksgiving dinner. It was very good - everyone enjoyed it. We made only one change to the recipe - which we highly recommend - add 2 cups of broth to the mix rather than 1. We think it would have been too dry with 1 cup - and 2 did not make it "soggy". The cranberries and apples added a nice sweetness - and color. We both agree that this recipe is a keeper!
