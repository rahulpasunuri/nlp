Was good enough, but nothing special. I am SURE that there are other, better recipes out there for pumpkin pie. For all people considering making a pumpkin pie, keep looking.

It is almost too solid of a recipe. I like how McCracken calls it "the perfect starter recipe" as it is the baseline from which I will judge all pumpkin pies in the future. This recipe does for pumpkin pie what Starbucks did to the Foldger's standard. (Starbucks is far from the best coffee, imho, but needs to be respected as a game changer.)

I made this pie in like 10 minutes, cooked for 55. The smell of the maple syrup as I pulled the pie out of the oven was amazing. Easy, tasty and excellent. I used a pre-made pie crust, so easy! Loved it, will make it again.

This pie was a real disappointment. It wasn't nearly sweet enough and tasted vaguely eggy. Won't be making this again!

I made this for a party. It was delicious, the whole thing was gone before it was cool. I served it with homemade whip cream without the bourbon, which was delicious and I would do it again, but I'd love to try the bourbon whipped cream. I used fresh pumpkin instead of canned, but for the amount of work if you're in a crunch for time canned is so much easier. The pie tasted more like an oatmeal pie than pumpkin, but I was asked to make it again at the next get together. So overall, big hit!
