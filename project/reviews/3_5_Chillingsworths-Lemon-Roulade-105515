I've made this for years, ever since it was first published. Don't overcook the sponge, and missing from this recipe is the necessary instruction to cut off any hard edges and to roll up the warm sponge in its paper to cool before filling. Otherwise it cracks. Filling is rich and yummy!

Served it at a dinner party to rave reviews. This serves six generously, could easily serve eight. I cut slices sparingly at first, and everyone came back for seconds. Three people came back for thirds. It tastes wonderfully light and citrusy -- nobody asked, and I didn't confess, how much butter was in the filling! The edges of my cake were a little hard, which made rolling difficult -- trimming them off greatly expedited the assembly. Will make this again when my arteries have recovered.

The lemon filling was great, but the cake was too eggy.

This desert is fantastic. It is light and lemony and perfect after a big meal.
