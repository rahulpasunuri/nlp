This is an excellent sponge recipe. I use this one as the base to any flavored tiramisu type desert. Just flavor the yokes during the mixing but before the four. I've done lemon, vanilla & orange by using zest or fresh vanilla bean. I also don't bother with piping the batter - just place batter over lined baking sheet and gently level out the batter. Cooks in the same amount of time. I cut the sponge to size with cut side up in dish so it soaks up the maximum amount of flavor from the flavors/syrups I apply re. chocolate, coffee, banana etc.

Having recently graduated from Culinary Institue LeNotre and having Gaston's book, I found this interesting and similar to the recipe used in class. Since these are soft, I'm wondering if the tiramisu makers here are brushing or soaking them?

Few ingredients, easy to make, and helps to make a darn good tiramisu. Yum.

I love this recipe. It's so simple, and has made "from scratch" tiramisu a regular staple in my house. I used to have so much trouble finding store bought lady fingers, it almost wasn't worth the hassle. So thanks!!!

I follow the recipe to the exact the first time. The second and third batch I blended the yellows with the flour a little. It seems the ones that I blended flattened out a lot. The ones that I spoon mixed seemed to keep their height. They taste fine. Recipe easy but time consuming. I really like the lack of ingredients in it too.

These came out exactly as I remember them as a little girl from Seesel's bakery in Memphis.
