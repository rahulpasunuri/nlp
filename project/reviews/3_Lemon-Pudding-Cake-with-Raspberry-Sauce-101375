My four forks are for the recipe below, from Tony of Fresno also. I had been waiting for years to make a Lemon Pudding Cake recipe I clipped from Gourmet. Instead, I made Tony's below, which was very similar. Couple of changes: I used 1/2 cup of flour vs. 1/4 and it was fabulous. I also did not use cream of tartar. I substituted regular lemons for Meyer lemons. House guests RAVED about this dish.

I too used Tony from Fresno's recipe and it was delicious and very easy. Cake- like on top, and pudding on the bottom. His recipe filled seven 3/4 cup ramekins.

Made recipe as written. It was okay but nothing to write home about, hence the two forks. However, used Tony's, and wow! Have made it with both lemon and orange, garnished with candied rind, and it never fails to please anyone that tastes it. Thanks Tony!

When I read this I realized my bad experience with a similar recipe (Raspberry Pudding Cake) was not unusual. Maybe it is the nature of the Pudding Cake. I was looking for a successful recipe for Pudding Cake, so I think I will take your advice and try Tony fm Fresno's Lemon Pudding Cake. I will top it with a fresh raspberry sauce.

I too am rating Tony from Fresno's recipe below, not the one above. Super simple and delicious! I used regular lemons. It was a bit sweet for me, but not for my boyfriend, whose sweet tooth is nil compared to mine! Go figure - Tony's recipe is old-fashioned and a comforting dessert. YUM!

My 4 forks rating is NOT for the recipe above, but for the one below from Tony of Fresno, CA, on 1/26/03. This Lemon Pudding Cake is divine! Not having Meyer lemons available, I used standard lemons, and the full amount of juice. It took just 30 minutes to be perfectly done; that may be my oven, and/or the fact I baked it in a glass dish. Bravo and many thanks to Tony and the Echo Restaurant!

This was absolutely delicious! After reading the other reviews and looking at several recipes, I realized the 1 cup of lemon juice was probably intended to be 1 juiced lemon, about 1/4 to 1/3 cup. I kept almost everything else the same, and it worked out great; I substituted strawberries for raspberries and my friend and husband loved it. It's very good and light-tasting, and also very fast to make.

I haven't tried this recipe, but was really sorry to hear how disappointed everyone was with it. I had a really good recipe for Lemon Pudding Cake that when baked, separated into two distinct layers: pudding and cake. Of course, the recipe was lost when my computer crashed last summer, but I found it (compliments of Echo Restaurant in Fresno ,CA)!!! Hope you guys enjoy this recipe: 1 cup sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt 1/4 cup flour 4 tablespoons butter, melted 1/3 cup Meyer lemon juice Grated zest of two lemons 3 eggs, separated 1/8 cup cream 1 cup milk 1/8 teaspoon cream of tartar Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a mixing bowl, combine 3/4 cup of the sugar, the salt and the flour and stir. Add melted butter, lemon juice, lemon zest and egg yolks. Mix until well blended. Stir in cream and milk. Set aside. In a mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar until fluffy. Add 1/4 cup sugar and beat until stiff but still moist. Fold into lemon mixture. Pour batter into a buttered 8-by-8-inch baking pan. Place pan in water bath and bake in oven 40-45 minutes, until top is lightly browned. Serve hot or cold. Serves 6.

I agree with previous rater. There is something terribly wrong with this recipe. Too runny. Can't possibly cut this into puddings. I had someone make it for me at a dinner party and she made it twice with no luck each time. I wish I had read the review 1st.

Much to my surprise (and horror), this is the absolute worst recipe I've ever seen on Epicurious. Be VERY wary of this recipe, as it will NOT work. The mixture is much too liquidy, and lining your baking pan with plastic wrap will make nothing but a melted plastic mess. I've tried other lemon pudding cakes with great success, but this is definitely not one to attempt.
