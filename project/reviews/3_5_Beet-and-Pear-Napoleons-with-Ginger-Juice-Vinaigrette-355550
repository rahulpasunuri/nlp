Came out looking beautifully, but for me it had way too many tastes going on at the same time. Ginger was overpowering for the pear, but did not work well enough on the beets. The ginger + fresh tarragon come out as too much.

I think there is too much ginger. I would add 1/2 the amount to let the flavors be more delicate

I loved this, and I'm not a great beet eater either. I forgot the tarragon, perhaps I will try it tomorrow. I don't have a cookie cutter so I may turn them square...

Made this for Thanksgiving; beautiful and delicious! A superb blend of flavors. However, there is no way you can get six servings from 2 beets & pears, I would definitely double this recipe. I also made my "rounds" wider (almost 2"), 1 inch is way too small.

The presentation was impressive but most of my guests did not finish this and the serving was small. I thought it was fine except a little too much ginger flavor. I would modify the dressing and make again.

I thought this was great. Used Korean or Asian pear and bartlet pears because that is what was available; prefered the Asian pear with it. Didn't take the time to do the cookie cutter thing - with the asian pear the sizes were similar and went together without trimming. Even my 2.5 year old loved it.
