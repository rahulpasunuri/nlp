I used a bottle of sangria for the wine and raspberries in place of the strawberries. As Jell-o salads go, this one was very tasty and more of a grown-up version. I have already had a request for the recipe.

was very murky and to be frank, it looked like congealed blood clo with fruit bits. Granted, it matched the school colors for the party bu was freaky looking. No on dare try it.

I used ramekins for individual servings and the family I cook for went ape over it. Next time I might try a white version...

I plan on making this in individual wine glasses of sorts and garnishing the edge of the glass with sliced fruit.

This was delicious but I had trouble with the mold. Next time, it will go into a pretty glass bowl.

brought this yummy lil salad to a potluck last night and it was a big hit with all who were lucky enough to get a taste before it was all gone. I used mandarin oranges as someone suggested and with the berries it was perfect. I even jazzed it up like the first reviewer suggested (sans the B-Day candles)...what i find most ineresting is that all of us who have tried it and deemed it a keeper...live in Calif...the odd person out may not be odd but here in So Calif life can seem a bit strange at times ... i'm a native and remember normal jello salads of my youth but this one goes hand in hand with what to bring to your election night victory party... sorry i don't plan to be in Arnold's camp that night....but this salad would be perfect for any of those parties!...

This was fabulous!!! As recommended, I subtituted 2 15-ounce cans of mandarin oranges (well-drained). When I tasted the jello without the fruit, I thought it might turn out too tart. But, with the addition of the fruit, it was perfectly balanced. This would be a refreshing and unusual dish for a backyard BBQ. I highly recommend this recipe!!!

This is a fun salad, sort of like jello shots for grown ups. I wouldn't make it every day, but wouldn't hesitate to bring it out when the occasion calls. The idea about mandarin oranges would make it faster and somewhat easier to eat. If I do it again with fresh oranges, I would cut up the segments a bit.

This was not a hit with my family. I'm sorry about it too since it took a while to section the oranges and cut up the rest of the fruit. I would suggest canned mandarin oranges for anyone interested in making this to save on time and energy. I think serving sangria would have won them over rather than the Jell-o.

I served this at my post-Rose Parade brunch and it was a big hit. I used a beaujolais nouveau as the wine; it complemented the other flavors in the salad beautifully. Several of my guests, including the men, told me to save the recipe.

This is a fun fun thing to make. I found a large brass mold at an antique store and it looks really pretty. It's a a bit bigger than a dinner plate, so we had to double the recipe. Pile some fruit in in the middle as garnish, light candles for a birthday, and enjoy. It's festive, fun, yummy and memorable. Just be sure to let it chill for at least 24 hours and pull it out at the last minute. Otherwise, your kitchen will look like a murder scene.
