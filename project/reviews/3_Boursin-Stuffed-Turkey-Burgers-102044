This recipe did not seem like anything special. The red onion in the burger was a good idea, and perhaps it was a little moister than your average turkey burger. But I wouldn't make it again. To be fair, we used herbed cheese rather than peppered.

I made some changes and used ground sirloin instead of ground turkey. I did follow suggestions and added 1/2 packet beefy onion soup mix, soy and worcestershire sauces. For the cheese, I used Cabot garlic and herb white cheddar. These are by far the BEST BURGERS that my boyfriend and I have ever eaten!!!!!!!

At the advice of other reviewers, I also added about half a pack of Lipton beefy onion soup mix and thought these were delish. Also used a grill pan and cooked for the same amount of time.

I thought this was incredibly bland. Maybe the addition of onion soup mix would have helped, but I'm not sure I'd even try given the disappointing first result.

I love Boursin and was very excited to try this recipe (especially given the rave reviews it has received). To my dismay, the turkey was very dry and the Boursin took on a strange grainy texture that oozed from the burger in a rather unsightly way. My advice: Don't waste your Boursin on this awful recipe. Save it for your crackers.

This was great. My husband refuses to eat turkey, but he gobbled these down. When I was preparing it I thought it might not work out because it didnt seem to want to stick together. I cooked it on a George Foreman grill for 4 min- perfection!

Mmmm! Fast, easy and tasty- my kind of recipe. As others suggested, a bit of onion soup mix added a lot of flavor which mixed nicely with the Boursin. This will be one of the rare recipes that I make again and again!

I make this just about every week now...it's so easy and delicious! Though I did use goat cheese instead of Boursin (couldn't find Boursin) and loved it! Also, mixing in the onion soup mix was a great idea, Marianne!

I didn't add the watercress, as I'm not a fan, but followed the rest of the recipe and enjoyed them. I did find them to be a tad dry. Next time I will make them with herb and garlic boursin rather than peppered.

To Victoria, B.C.: Boursin is a triple-cream cheese from France, NOT goat cheese!

I really like goat cheese, but I found that it was slightly overpowering in these burgers. Maybe using the BBQ is integral to developing the necessary balance of flavours (our BBQ is presently out of commission so I used the broiler). But, the recipe shows definite promise, so next time, I'll wait until I can BBQ, or I'll modify the quantities a little.

I love this recipe and make it on a regular basis. I have found that a little soy sauce and worcestershire and sa little dry onion soup mix (1/2 package) enhance the flavor of the ground turkey. I also use different cheeses for variety. Brie and boursin togehter are quite good. My fiance is a big fan of turkey burgers. He loves this recipe so much he doesn't order turkey burgers out anymore - since he says he has been so spoiled.

I have made this recipe at least a half-a-dozen times. Each time I have altered the recipe slightly. For example, I now use ground chicken instead of turkey. I find that the burgers do not dry out as easily. I use red top lettuce instead of watercress, and I do not mix the onions into the meat--I use slices on the sandwich instead. I find the less you handle the meat, the easier they are to work with. A tip: spray your hands with PAM before making the burgers. The meat will not stick to your hands.

We have turkey burgers of some sort once a week. This recipe was easy, tasty and a nice variation for our menu.

I am not generally a big fan of the turkey burger, as I generally find them to be dry and dull, but the cheese in the middle keeps the turkey moist, and the onions really make the meat more flavorful. I used herbed boursin and thought the result was great.

I've already made these burgers twice, and they are very easy and tasty. I didn't have the watercress on hand, but that was no big deal. Also, I didn't use the English muffins, I just used the usual hamburger buns and it was a cinch! I crumble the cheese over the burgers while making them, I think it melts better that way.
