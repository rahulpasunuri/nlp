This was not very good.... It seemed to have potential, but the sugar is way too much. I even reduced it to 1/3 cup based on other reviews and it was still "brown sugary". It really did not have any peach flavor. We will definitely toss this one....

the recipe is a nice place to start, but i altered a few things and would change more in the future. first use good, ripe peaches, and i would add some cinnamon or allspice and maybe some bourbon to the pot. the pureeing is optional if you want smoother ice cream. instead of the three yolks and one egg, i used four whole eggs. after making chocolate ice cream with only yolks recently and having it turn out so badly that the disposal ate it, i went back to my grandmother's style of using whole eggs. this ice cream was a big hit, and i'll definitely make it again, probably trying different fruits, too.

Just made this with some fabulous peaches from the farmer's market and it's a tasty result. It's no more trouble than any custard ice cream recipe (the only extra step is making the brown sugar syrup), but it does taste more of brown sugar than peaches and the directions are horribly written. Do not bother with the "175 degrees on a candy thermometer" -- just cook the custard until it thickens slightly. And, I'd use a few more peaches than it calls for to get a more intense peachy flavor. Otherwise, I think the brown sugar and peach flavors complement each other really well and this is a nice variation on straight peach ice cream!

This is a very easy recipe to prepare, it really takes no more time then any other ice cream, especially if you plan ahead. It took me less then an hour to prepare the custard and peach mixture, and that included a break to go get more half and half. The richness of the brown sugar syrup brings out a wonderful flavor in the peaches. I like to serve this with a penuche sauce and a few sliced strawberries as garnish; it is very elegant. I make the ice cream base early in the day and allow it to sit until right before dinner and then process it while we eat. Remember, if you add the alcohol to the ice cream it will take longer to freeze and will never be as firm as those ice creams without it, liquor inhibits freezing. Be prepared to spend a little more time to make a good homemade ice cream, if you do not have the patience go back to the supermarket!

Much too much work for a mediocre ice cream :(

The ice cream is delicious; however, the recipe takes about 2 hours to prepare the custard and another 1 to 1 1/2 hours to freeze. It's too "putsy" of a recipe for me!
