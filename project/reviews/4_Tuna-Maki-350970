I followed the easy directions and it tasted great! I also used seedless cucumber slivers in the sushi rolls.

I figured out how to make plenty of different rolls by watching the chefs in restaurants with bars. Also, those mats aren't terribly necessary. I make rolls with wax paper and a firm hand. I could never find the bamboo mat in stores...

Making this sushi was a lot of fun, if a little labor intensive. The rice is certainly tricky. In addition to tuna rolls, I also did some with salmon and avocado or cucumber, and veggie ones with lettuce, carrot or cucumber, avocado and cream cheese. Beautiful and delicious!
