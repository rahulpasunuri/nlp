This is super-easy and a good recipe choice if you want to get the stew going before your guests arrive but don't have all day to prep. I used a tasty pinot noir instead of Burgundy, as recommended by my wine shop guy. Do not skip the brandy - it is a key ingredient! I had everything simmering away and took the lid off to thicken it up a bit more about 15 minutes prior to eating. Crusty baguette is a must!

This is my go-to recipe for stew. I add a canned chipoltle pepper and a Tablespoon of the adobo sauce to add some heat. Great with a crusty loaf of french bread.

Rating: 3
I thought this was d-lish! Although, a bit time-consuming for a weekday meal. I skipped the brandy becuase I didn't have any and the nutmeg because I don't like it. I also diced the carrots, celery, & onion and sauted it all together. I did saute the potatoes and mushrooms seperately then added all the veggies to broth for a wee bit longer. I tossed this over egg noodles. This is a keeper!!

Came looking for a recipe for venison and thought this one would work. It does work great. The wine makes the venison wonderfully tender and flavorful. As everyone else says... it is better the second day.

Absolutely delicious. Made for my parents and they raved about it and asked to have it again! Only addition I made was to add some parsnips since I was low on carrots. A great alternative to the standard beef stew.

love this recipe- with a few modifications. i always add the juice and grated zest of an orange near the end (it really brightens the flavors), also i throw in about 4 cloves along with the thyme.

Delicious stew. If it comes down to a choice between drinking the wine or adding it to the stew, I'll add a beer to the stew instead. It's almost as good that way!

I liked this stew, but it was a thumbs down from my kids. It seemed to lack.... something. More recently, I tried the "Beef Stew with Potatoes and Carrots" from this site and it was an overwhelming family favorite. I will use elements from this recipe (e.g., flouring the beef before browning + a bit of butter) in combination with the other recipe in an attempt to reach Beef Stew "nirvana".

An excellent recipe. I used veal stew meat with all fat trimmed off. Leftovers are even better the next day.

I omitted the potatoes and served the 'stew' over egg noodles the way I remember it being served as a child. I also let the 'stew' sit in the fridge overnight instead of serving it right away. My Quebecois boyfriend loved it, and I loved it too. We used good quality Cognac and a dry home-made red wine. I will make this one for guests anytime, it was simply fantastic.

The first time I ever made a Beef Bourguignon, years ago, I found that I didn't like it at all the same day; after overnight in the fridge, it was wonderful! I've found this true of most stews that have a lot of red wine.

My husband and I were completely split in our opinions. To my way of thinking, this was bland and boring. I imagine that after a few days the leftovers will probably improve (as stew tends to do). But my husband LOVED this dish. Go figure!

This is a great foundation for playing and making it your own. I used Zinfandel, which imparts a little sweeter flavor to the meat. I also used Top Sirloin instead of stew meat. In addition, I like it hot, so added 2 chipoltle peppers, plus a tablespoon of adobo sauce to really make a wonderful winter meal.

In a word...delicious. The only changes I made were to add the juice of half an orange and four whole cloves when adding the red wine and beef broth. The beef was tender the vegetables were just carmelized...a very nice winter meal.

Real beef bourguignon does NOT have celery and potatoes in it. That makes it a beef stew.

This is an excellent recipe. For those who argue this point, may I remind you that your result will only be as good as the ingredients you use! I used steak and a good bottle of merlot. I did double the garlic, and I forgot (accidentally) the nutmeg. Served it with homemade French bread right out of the oven. Even the picky eaters had seconds!

Is this what Beef Bourguignon is supposed to taste like?? My family found this reminiscent of cafeteria food. I used a Cabernet, and browned everything in olive oil. Not worth the time and effort, I won't make this recipe again.

Yum! My first time to make beef stew, and this one came out remarkably well. Great depth of flavor. I threw in a few extra veg, which was fine. My only complaint was that it was a little heavy on the butter for my left-coast tastes. Next time, I'll cut that down. Otherwise, a fabulous recipe!

Very delicious beef stew. I cooked the meat longer than called for (but again I live at high altitude and cook everything longer!) and doubled the spices. Used a fairly cheap merlot and it all worked out fine. Made it ahead to keep in the fridge for out-of-town company and they raved!!

What a delicious recipe! This was my first attempt at a stew and it turned out wonderfully. I didn't really brown the vegetables that much, and cut out the carrots and mushrooms. I simmered it for almost an hour, and the delicious was already thickened, so I didn't boil it any more. I will definitely make this again.

This was a bit of work in the timing but the result was excellent. if your using electric stove you may have to mic the veggies after browning but before putting in with meat so everything cooks evenly. but flavour was great and will def make again

Pleasant dish. I reduced the amount of celery and added a parsnip. Next time I'll also increase the amount of garlic and onion and reduce the number of bay leaves.

I made a lower-carb version (substituted green beans and peas for the potatoes) and it was great! Even more important, in my opinion - simmer for at least 60-90 minutes, rather than boil for 7 minutes. We polished it off, and my husband wondered aloud if I would make it again the next day.

I've been making this for almost a year now and it is amazing! I just told my sister I was making a batch and almost had to fight her off with a bat! Made it for a dinner party (all men) and they argued over who would lick out the pot. I'm not a beef stew fan, but this recipe is the exception. I use sirloin steak instead of stewing beef.

I don't care for celery so I didn't add it. I added peas, replaced half of the butter with olive oil but otherwise followed the recipe. It turned out wonderfully. I thought it was thick enough and the flavors are tremendous. I'm glad I bought a good bottle of wine. I'll definitely make this again!

This was a very delicious recipe. I agree with the other reviewers stating that a good wine is very important. To the below reviewer who's whole family and guests became ill, I doubt it was from this recipe. My kids have been eating this since they were two and they've never had a problem. The upset stomachs most likely came from the meat, which may not have been as fresh as you thought. Pizza is always a great slumber party food!! Happy cooking to all!

I've made this recipe 4 times now. I've refined it by doubling the sherry and then using a 750ml bottle of cabernet sauvignon, 1 Cup water and 2 beef boullion cubes instaed of the suggested wine/broth combo. Have always gotten rave reviews

Rating: 3
It's important to use the right meat; I recommend Beef Loin/Top Sirloin. I followed first part of receipe but browned onions,1 carrot separately and added to beef along with wine,broth,etc. No celery in house and added peas and carrots + potatoes last 20 min. Cooked totally in 1 1/2 hr. Good family dinner.

I was excited by this prospect--for me, beef bourguignon has always meant a 2-day extravaganza involving such fun items as cheesecloth and salt pork. It is one of my favorite dishes, so I never minded the time sacrifice, and I thought if this recipe could deliver the goods in a fraction of the time . . . but it doesn't. I don't think bourguignon is a dish that lends itself very well to shortcuts. Interesting premise, but I would not make this version again. :(

Made this yesterday afternoon for a last minute casual dinner party with friends. Followed the recipe with the exception of frying chopped bacon, then using the bacon fat to brown the meat and using small boiling onions instead of one large onion. Sauteing all the vegetables was time consuming, and neither I nor my guests thought that added anything to the flavor. Everyone enjoyed the dinner, but it wasn't fabulous, so I would give it 2+ forks, but not 3.

This recipe is a winner every time. I use a good wine, and try to go with a little less butter, but overall it's excellent. Also, definitely try it with a better cut of steak. I personally use tenderloin tips which are a less expensive way to go than ribeye.

"Best beef stew I've ever tasted" was my husband's comment. I used 1/2 merlot and 1/2 rose as we are not big red wine fans. I would change not one other thing. I made a double batch to share with neighbors but it all disappeared in just two meals!

I loved this recipe, so did my guests. Many said it was the best dish of this type they had ever had--some called it stew, some called it beef bourguignon. I made it for my birthday party which had a "Provance' theme. Several of my guests--myself included, have enjoyed Peter Mayle's books and this was a perfect main course. The few extra steps are wortht he effort. I search through years of Bon Appetit Magazines and reveiwed several different recipes before deciding on this one. I had made it once before and had a note in the page that my husband really liked it.

This is an excellent beef stew (bourguignon) that is a hearty dish for an cool fall or cold winter night. I liked the way that the suated vegetables flavored the dish. I used 2 cans of beef broth instead of 2 cups for I like a lot of gravy. This dish was served with warm crusty french bread and a Talus Cabernet. Everyone at the dinner enjoyed the meal. Definitely a keeper!

I think I agreed with sandra that this recipe is beef stewed in red wine, but not the authentic boef bourguignon. The authentic recipe can only be satisfactory an overnight marination using rather light, non-tannic like a mature burgundy. Where is the garlic?

This dish was raved about by my company. It is a little time-consuming with the sautee procedure for the vegetables, but worth the effort. I added about 1/3 cup of bacon while I prepared the beef for a richer flavor. Had to add little cornstarch at the end, due to the fact that I added 2 cans (28 ozs) instead of 2 cups of the beef broth, but noone was the wiser. Serve this dish over rice, with some crusty buttered bread.

I made this for company before Christmas. Everything I have made that has been rated more than 95 % has been excellent. I was disappointed with this one, however. It was good, but not "Wow!". Considering the extra work of sauteeing the veggies separately and using a very nice merlot, I found the flavor was not as intense as I expected. It certainly was not bad but I have other stew-type dishes I would make before I would do this again.

Excellent beef stew! We loved it! Would be a great "company" dish. I tweeked the recipe a little -- used top sirloin, increased the brandy to about 1/2 cup, added 1 Tbl. brown sugar, and used a good Merlot. I also added extra garlic, a couple of parsnips, and used Yukon Gold potatoes instead of red.

To Sandro from Bidart... I am French. This recipe is good & easy. You do NOT have to marinate a Boeuf Bourguignon in wine for a day (or for any time at all). A full-bodied red wine is generally added after you saute the beef & vegetables in hot oil & bacon fat. Obviously there are variations on the basic recipe but marinating is not required. Refer to 'Mastering the Art of French Cooking' by Simone Beck, L. Bertholle & Julia Child for a really classic Boeuf Bourguignon.

I must admit this is truely a great tasting stew I was a bit nervous with cooking with that amount of wine but we were blown away with how good it really was: I used filet migon instead of stew meat & a very good Merlot,and after letting the meat simmer in the wine for that while I added 1 tlb of tomato paste and 1 tlb of brown sugar it just seemed to give it a little more taste.Serve to company they will think your out of this world !

This was very time consuming! but the flavor was terrific.I added a couple of sweet potato and a parsnip.Both were really good especially the sweet potato, it added a rich complex flavor.

Yes, it does take time to roast the vegetables seperately, but I did it because I thought if I throw them all together in one big batch they wouldn't roast so well (that is also the reason why you divide the meat into smaller portions for roasting!). It is definitely worth the effort. One of the best beef dishes I have ever eaten.

This stew had a delicious flavor and was easy to make. I didn't have brandy so I just used extra red wine. Next time I make it I will cut my vegetables smaller. I just didn't enjoy those large hunks of cooked celery! I also substituted spelt flour since our family avoids wheat. Also, I think I overcooked it a bit and the meat started shredding too much but it still tasted delicious. My 7 and 3 year olds ate it as well. The 7 year old even wanted it in her lunchbox the next day!

This dish was great! Far too much butter was called for in this recipe . . . not necessary. Naturally, added much more garlic and used a better cut of beef. A little time consuming but well worth it. Next time I would not take the time to brown all vegetables separately and would not quite simmer for a full 45 minutes, I prefer the vegetables to be a little firmer.

Rating: 4
I've made this stew about half-dozen times, and it really can't be beat. The flavors are much richer than other stews. Browning the vegetables is a must, but I've adopted this variation: Instead of browning each veggie separately, I use a very large saute pan and brown in two batches: Carrots, celery and parsnips (the latter adds great flavor, and I highly recommend) in batch one, and the rest of the veggies in a second batch. I use a non-stick pan, which allows me to use about half of the butter called for in the recipe. I also use a combination of shallots and onions, and add some fresh peas during the last few minutes of cooking. Finally, I serve it over wide egg noodles. This stew has become a favorite among family and friends...and it's even better the next day!

If you are looking for a gourmet beef stew, here it is! For 3-4 servings, I used 1.5 lbs beef, but same amount of liquid, mixing 1/4 cup sherry with wine. Also used more thyme and dried basil. I cut down veggies by 1/4 and sauteed together starting with longest cooking, adding more butter as I went along. Shitake mushrooms probably helped too.

Rating: 3
This is quite good. Has a distinctive flavor which sets apart from other beef stews & I'll certainly make it again. I don't see any point, however, in browning the meat in batches if it'll all fit comfortably in the pot. Nor do I think its necessary to brown all the vegetables individually. Save yourself some time!

With a medium or incorrect cut of beef, this stew, frankly, stinks. It had all the earmarks of a great regular dish. However, the blade steak cut I used on the advice of my butcher was a huge mistake. I'll try it again only with new meat and will be cautious in that attempt.
