I have made this several times to rave reviews. It is delicious and pretty to serve for company. Once I even added cubed potatoes and smoked sausage to make a meal out of it! Yum!

Great dish for company. Drain the tomatoes well--the longer the better.

Great dish for company, fast and easy to make. I follow the recipe exactly and have never had a complaint. I think it serves more than six -- it's a strong tasting dish, so a little goes a long way, plus not everybody likes cooked tomatoes.

I've made this many times and to address the questions about being runny, throw the tomatoes in a colindar to drain-the recipe says drain well. I also roughly chop the tomatoes with a spoon to get them into several large pieces. For the topping, I add the breadcrumbs and cheddar and shake in a covered bowl to combine. I've also found that the flavor is enhanced if you let the ingrediants mingle for a few hours before baking. This recipe is a nice alternative, and works well with chicken and beef.

We all thought it was delicous. And it looked good too!

This was delicious! I made it for a Thanksgiving dinner & it barely made it to the table, it smelled so good. I was asked for the recipe by almost everyone there. I did use a second can of tomatoes, just one didn't seem to be enough. It seemed like there was plenty of topping for 2 cans, too. I subbed balsamic vinegar for the Marsala, couldn't notice a difference.

This gratin was delicious! I used fresh 4 fresh tomato's instead of canned. The breadcrumb/cheese mixture was the perfect amount when using fresh tomato's It was definitely a hit!

This was absolutely delicious. I didn't have any chives, and I used breadcrumbs from a bakery (but not from fresh bread) and it was wonderful. The only thing is that the 28-oz can of San Marzano tomatoes I used didn't seem like very much once I had drained it, thus making a lot of crumbs to the amount of tomatoes. No matter, delicious all the same!

I made this for my husband who intensely dislikes all green vegetables, and in addition, prefers all fruits uncooked. It was a hit! I made the following changes, however, to add a few extra vegetables in the mix for him: I sauteed some Vidalia onion and chopped portobello mushrooms and added them to the pan; in addition, I used only a 1/2 cup of regular breadcrumbs and used mozzarella and a bit of blue cheese instead of cheddar. We were lucky enough to have some fresh (olive oil packed - no salt) anchovies, so I added a few of these just before serving. As I said, my husband loved it!

I give this 4 forks because it's easy and delicious. I made it for a holiday dinner party, and my guests didn't leave a crumb behind. Everyone loved it, and two people requested the recipe to make it over Christmas. It came together quickly and was a nice accompaniment to the steak au poirve (sp) that I made. I followed a previous cook's advice and as careful not to break open the tomatoes while tossing with ingredients. I will make this again and again. By the way, I got more holiday cooking ideas out of the March 02 issue than I did the Dec. 02 issue.

What a disaster. I was really looking forward to this recipe. I served it as a side dish to our Christmas Day Roast Beef Dinner. There were WAY too many breadcrumbs. They were dry and the cheese didn't melt at all. IF I do make this again, I would halve the breadcrumbs but leave the cheese amount and increase the olive oil. No one ate it. I was very embarassed.

I made this recipe as a side dish with grilled steaks and it got a thumbs-up from all. The previous ratings helped me, because I took care not to break up the tomatoes when I drained them so the final product wasn't runny. I didn't have marsala, I used a splash of balsamic vinegar - yummy. This recipe is a keeper for using ingredients that are always on hand & I think it will lend itself to substitutions - like basil instead of chives or different cheeses.

It was very tasty and even the 8 yr. old liked it.

This is a tasty way to serve tomatoes and is very easy to prepare. My husband really liked it also. Then again, we are from the school that says tomatoes are good any way you slice them.

My husband and I loved this recipe. As a previous reviewer suggested, I used fresh sliced tomatoes. My husband commented that the dish seems to want to be a casserole. Next time I may add some other veggies.

This dish is just wonderful and so easy. We just loved it and cannot wait to do it again

This was VERY good! I added some crushed buttery Club crackers to the bread crumbs and used extra sharp yellow cheddar instead of the white. I also just used small tomatoes, sliced in half and placed in the dish face up. I drizzled the wine/garlic/chive mixture over top. Serve this piping hot - it's best that way!

I made this recipe twice in a week, once for my family & once for company...but with a few changes, and it got great reviews. I used small golden boy & big boy tomatoes from the garden, halved them top to bottom & laid them skin side down. I also added italian seasoning & it was wonderful. The last time, I had no bread to create crumbs, so I used 1/2 of a Boboli pizza crust. That was even better! Will definitely continue to make this!

My husband and I loved this recipe. I used 25 ounces of fresh small vine-ripened tomatoes which I kind of smashed so that they could be mixed with the other ingredients. Wonderful vegetable/side dish that goes with most everything. I agree that it has a similar flavor to stuffed tomatoes.

As the recipe calls for whole tomatoes with no mention of dicing or slicing, it means to leave them whole.

We prepared this side dish for use with lamb chops, and it was excellent. I added an extra garlic clove, but otherwise followed the recipe. We have saved the recipe and will prepare it again.

My husband doesn't usually say much about vegetable recipes - he is much more interested in the main dish. However, he loved this one and so did everyone else. Very easy to prepare.

Do you slice or chop the tomatoes or bake them whole? The recipe gives no clue.

My husband really liked this recipe. Of course, he loved baked tomoatoes, so that his not a big surprise. He has requested it several times since I first made it.

This was okay but kind of boring. The bread crumbs were great but they couldn't really transform canned tomatoes into something spectacular. I would make the bread crumbs again to use with something else, but I wouldn't make this recipe again.
