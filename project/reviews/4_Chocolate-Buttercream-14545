This was the best chocolate buttercream recipe I've tried. Instead of bittersweet chocolate, though, I used half bittersweet chocolate and half milk chocolate, and it came out great. And the consistency is perfect, creamy and spreadable but also with some substance to it. I used it on a yellow cake and it was delicious.

I made this to use as filling for our daughter's birthday cake and it came out wonderfully and stayed firm. It was the perfect moist touch to the cake. I made a triple portion for a 9x13 pan (2 layers of filling), but still had lots left over. It is also possible to freeze it, we discovered.

This is the perfect chocolate frosting. HIGHLY recomend.

Best ever frosting, smooth, light and chocolatey. Reminds me of chocolate whipped cream. Not quite enough for a 3 layer cake, next time I would double the recipe.

Excellent recipe! I only used 3 tbsps of cocoa and I thought it was just perfect!

This came out good but did not blow me away as described in the other reviews. I would have liked for it to be sweeter. Perfect shine and texture just lacking the "oomph" factor for me. No complaints on it. I would say this is a reliable recipe.

We made this to go with a Devil's Food cake for our friend's b-day. Our cake turned out a little too sweet, so I wanted to make the icing a little richer. This wa s PERFECT. I followed the recipe completely except I added all of the melted bittersweet chocolate and then just added the cocoa to taste. Wonderful recipe that makes the perfect amount for 2 9" round cakes and not a tough recipe at all.

This recipe is perfect. I switched out the bittersweet chocolate for milk chocolate and only used 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder (it tastes just like Maltesers). Light, fluffy and not too sweet. I agree with other reviewers though, be sure the sift your cocoa powder otherwise you'll get small clumps of it in your frosting.

Great recipe. A little more difficult than traditional frosting, but well worth the effort.

I made this recipe to go on a dark chocolate cake using espresso instead of water to make the sugar syrup. Now I have only had the thin and uneven slivers from the outside of this cake with small dabs of frosting, but may I say, the cake seems like only a vehicle to enjoy more frosting without seeming like a complete pig! :) It is light, luscious, buttery and yet delightfully mocha flavored. My only tip would be to sift your cocoa powder first to insure no little lumps in this frosting! My powder is pretty fresh and didn't turn out too lumpy, but ... the spreading consistency didn't seem quite thick enough and the top layer is sliding even before the car ride I'm about to take! Uh-oh.... anyone tips for next time?

I have to give this 4 forks just because it is such an easy recipe that even a beginner should be able to produce excellent results. I also like the quantity that the recipe made.However, next time I make it I will add either some Raspberry flavored syrup to the syrup or some flavored extract. I agree with the reviewer that didn't like the recipe- it needs some extra flavor other than the creamy chocolate

this is a great recipe..and its a no fail one as well. i didn't have bittersweet choc on hand and used semi sweet. it was unbelieveable.

Now I know why people make frosting from scratch - this was incredible. It was fairly easy to pull together, thanks to the previous reviewers - I knew what to expect. I doubled the recipe and the first half of the butter was a bit cooler than the second half, which I think ended up helping some. Finally, I made this with salted butter and omitted the dash of salt in the recipe. Next time I'll use half salted and half unsalted, but I'm still going to eat every last bite! This is a winner!

Excellent buttercream - the stuff cravings are made of! I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used twice the chocolate (Ghiardelli) and cut back on the butter by 1/4 cup. I also ommited the cocoa powder. This buttercream had great mouthfeel and lovely flavor. I'd make this again without hesitation!

I was expecting this to be very creamy and thick like homemade chocolate icing. I spent all this time making the icing, and all I can say is if you think you would love the taste of bitter chocolate cool whip, then this is the recipe for you. I absolutely hated it.

I made this last night with the old fashioned chocolate cake recipe on this site(www.epicurious.com/recipes/recipe_views/views/755) and it came out great! Everyone raved about how tasty the cake and frosting were together - goes well with a real chocolatey cake. Agree with the others that this is dangerous in that you could end up eating all the frosting before frosting the cake! Will definitely make again and play around with other flavors - maybe mocha?

I made this buttercream yesterday for orange-flavored cupcakes, and it was a huge hit! I love *real* buttercream like this, and I had to keep myself from eating it straight. Yum.

I didn't have a candy thermometer, but I went forward anyway with a regular food thermometer and a little guesstimating. Perhaps this is why, when I was first mixing it, it seemed to be sort of chunky. I also think it may have been because the butter was a little too cold. Next time, I will use room temperature butter. Anyway, when I added the chocolate at the end, it was still warm enough to make everything blend just fine and the buttercream was delicious and rich (Dangerous to have sitting in my fridge for several hours!) I used it as frosting for dark chocolate cake. Mmmm.... the moral of my story...even someone who is not entirely buttercream savvy can make this recipe and succeed. It is pretty straightforward.

This chocolate buttercream icing is to die for! I omitted the cocoa powder and added 8 ozs of melted bittersweet chocolate. I've also tried the vanilla buttercream on this site and it was wonderful too. Both came out perfect the first time. Beware! Don't make this when you're in a rush! And be sure to have a stand mixer or your arm might fall off!

Excellent chocolate buttercream! Very easy to make and absolutely delicious on a dark chocolate cake. A good candy thermometer is essential. Lots of rave reviews on this and will definitely be making this one again.

This is the perfect chocolate buttercream recipe. I didn't edit it at all. I used ghirardelli Chocolate. It was quite easy, but a candy thermometer is essential.

This recipe was delicious although I added more cocoa and used salted butter adding no extra salt. It is a very light chocolate in taste and texture even with the extra cocoa, not at all heavy or cloyingly sweet. Smooth and lovely, no problems at all in the making. If you are looking for a recipe that is dense and dark this is not it, but do try it, I'm sure you will love it.
