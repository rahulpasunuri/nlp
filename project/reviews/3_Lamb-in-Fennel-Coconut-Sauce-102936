Pretty good! We used leftover cooked lamb and it turned out quite tender. It was a bit bland; we'll make it again but might add some type of pepper.

I added about a tbsp of panang curry paste to this and used coconut milk rather than the coconut. Yum!

Delisious! Sunset - try the Asian grocers for curry leaves (used in many Thai or Vietnamese cooking; Southern Indian cooking as well). I added a few drops of pure coconut flavoring to the sauce to enhance the coconut flavor.

I prepared this dish using all of the ingredients, exactly as called for. Despite using fresh coconut, I didn't pick up much coconut flavor in the sauce and will add more next time or, perhaps better, coconut milk. For those without quick access to an Indian grocery, substitute bay leaves in a lesser number unless fresh)for the curry leaves. Anyone living in the Sunset shouldn't have to do that, but a regular grocery (even the Andronicos on Funston) won't carry them. I really don't understand where the bitter flavor came from that one respondent described unless she used Black cardamom which is much stronger than green. Overall, this is a very fine lamb curry with many subtle flavors.

The coconut spice mixture was good. The final product was awful, one of the ingredients was very bitter,maybe it was the cardamom. I don't think I used GREEN cardamom. I also did not have any curry leaves. With the price of lamb nowadays, this recipe is a pricey risk. I might make it again using the coconut spice mixture, adding it to a basic curry.

This was a real hit1 It only took about ten minutes to thicken the sauce at a fast boil once the lamb was removed. My son's ultimate compliment: "Wow - this is as good as a restaurant". Obtaining all ingredients was a bit of a challenge.

Yummy!!! But the picture doesn't do it justice. Amexican dessert with Indian cusine. Opps.

This was pretty good, but I have other lamb recipes that I like much better. I guess I'm just not crazy about the coconut. I didn't bother to remove the lamb before thickening the sauce, and the thickening took quite some time. (I think it would take a long time no matter what.)

Recipe sounds great, but in clicking to the picture, think there might be a mix-up... Picture appears to be a flan???
