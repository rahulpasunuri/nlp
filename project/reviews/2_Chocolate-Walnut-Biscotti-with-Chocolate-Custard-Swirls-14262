I haven't made this recipe, but I have made others like it and had the same problem with crumbling. To avoid this almost completely, try a butterless biscotti recipe like the cinnamon- raisin or chocolate-hazelnut ones on this site. Both are excellent basic recipes which can be changed with your own additions,and they slice beautifully (I do bake them for a bit less than the recommended time).I believe traditional biscotti recipes do not have butter, as it does make for a more crumbly, soft cookie.

i found this recipe absolutely delicious. i was hesitant at first to try this because of a soured review but i didn't find it too bitter at all. in fact i found it on the sweet side and doubled up on the rind.

What a waste of time. Unless of course you like bitter, tasteless cookies this recipe's for you. Add another pound of sugar and some glue to actually make it resemble a cookie and it cannot diminish the taste because anything would be better. Dunking them in coffee does'nt even disguise the bitterness.
