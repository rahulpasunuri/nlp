The olive taste was pretty strong, but the dish was very colorful and interesting -- a nice way to spice up plain mashed potatoes.

A friend actually made this recipe, a forgot to mash the potatoes!, so this is not actually a review of the exact recipe. The flavors were terrific together, and the consistency of the dish was great.
