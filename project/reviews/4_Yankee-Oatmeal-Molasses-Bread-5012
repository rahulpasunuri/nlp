Excellent! I alo omitted the glaze and used half honey/half molasses. The bread was a hit, even on a cooler summer day. This recipe is a keeper.

Simple recipe with great results, one of the reasons why I love this website! The only thing I might alter next time is omitting the glaze or using honey instead of molasses for the glaze.

(I changed the recipe somewhat, so I won't rate it.) This was very good. My husband prefers whole wheat bread, and as I only had whole wheat pastry flour on hand, I made the recipe substituting 2 cups of WW pastry flour. I needed to use up some honey, so I also used 2 tablespoons of honey and 4 Tblsp. molasses.I also used 1 cup of oats with one and a quarter cups of boiling water which I "stole" from the yeast. I proofed the yeast with 1/2 cup water. (BTW: using my instant read thermometer, the water was very warm when it finally registered at 108 degrees. This is very different from my Home-Ec days of tepid water. Maybe this is why some have had trouble with their yeast.) Couldn't find my loaf pan, so I just formed it into a ball on a cookie sheet. To top off the loaf, (10 mins. before it was done), I made an egg wash, using 1 egg, (way too much, use a T of egg substitute if you have it), a t of water, and some maple syrup. The oats stuck on, and it dried in the oven. Wonderful bread, with lots of flavor.

Really good! I used mostly bread flour and a cup of whole wheat. The rises were a bit slow and the top popped a lot in the oven - I think this could benefit from a good slashing before the baking. I am not sold on the glaze; not sure it's really necessary. But the bread is lovely! Great flavor and overall not a timeconsuming recipe. I'd like some more right now, in fact; I only took one piece with me to work.

We love this bread and its a no-fail loaf as well. My hubby isn't a huge fan of molasses so we use half and half with honey with great results. Its a nice hearty loaf thats easy (and with quick yeast fairly fast) that is amazing with soup or stews (or fresh with butter).

Delicious bread recipe. I made it like otehrs suggested using 3 Tbsp of Honey and 3 Tbsp of unsulphured molasses. I also substituted about 1 1/2 c. of the unbleached all purpose flour with stone ground whole wheat flour. And...I did my second rising in the refrigerator overnight. Took the risen dough out of the refrigerator in the morning, punched it down, shaped it into two ovals, let it rise again on the pans and baked as directed. That morning rise took awhile since the dough was cold. By letting the dough rise in the refrigertaor overnight the bread ended up with a beautiful crust and soft interior. When I made it as per the recipe the bread was tougher. The slow rise in the refrigerator let more enzyme action take place and I ended up with a softer better flavored loaf in my opinion.

This is a good recipe that never lets me down. You can easily use as much wheat in place of white flour as you want. I usually do one or two tbs. molasses and the remainder as honey or brown rice syrup.

This is an especially wonderful bread for Thanksgiving. And to seeka34 from Madison, perhaps your yeast was not fresh enough. Try another package, be sure to check the date, and keep it in the fridge until you're ready to use it. Then just use warm water, not hot, to activate it. Sometimes a touch (1/2 tsp) of sugar helps too, so I've heard. Good luck! It's yummy bread.

Wonderful bread. It's easy, and everyone loves it. I use a very dark molasses so I cut the molasses to 3 tbs and use 3 tbs honey or brown rice syrup. This may vary, however, on how much molasses taste I (or whatever lucky sap I bake this bread for) want(s). I also soak 1 cup of oats instead of 1/2 cup because I love oats, and use some wheat flour as well to make the bread heartier.

I love this bread, but I cannot get it to rise. Does anyone have suggestions on how to not kill yeast? I'm trying to overcome an inherited bread-(non)baking trait.

Wonderful! This bread is a breeze to make, and the flavor and texture are perfect. I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour in place of some of the white, just to boost the health quotient.

I just made this and it came out great. I used 3 T. of honey and 3 T. of molasses as suggested and it did not have a strong molasses flavor.

I have made this bread about ten times now and it has been perfect every time. I just got a new oven and can't wait to see how it turns ooout now.

Really a yummy and foolproof bread. I have used either the full 6T of molasses or 3T molasses and 3T of honey and either way its delicious. We make this all the time.

I really liked the sweetness and the spongy texture. It was a nice change from the rougher breads I usually made. I used dark molasses (when I use an ingrediant, I like to know it's in there). I forgot to put oats on top of the glaze; that may be why my glaze is still sticky 5 days later! I've been eating it plain or with honey and butter; next time I make it I hope to use some for a brown betty or other dessert. It's very soft, so if you're looking for a bread that's dense or "artisanal", this is not it.

This bread would have turned out pretty well, except it was pretty raw when I took it out. I don't know if my oven is off, but the bread was completely doughy, and I baked it for as long as the directions said. Bummer.

SUPERB! This bread is excellent, even in volume. I live in a vegan house with 13 other people and so I made 5 loaves. I used all whole wheat flour when I discovered we had no unbleached white, and added about a tablespoon of wheat gluten per loaf. The loaves came out fluffy and full of flavor! (Perhaps because of the oats.)

The texture and flavor of this bread was great! I am very used to making homemade bread that is so dense it is best for toasting-this one was different. I will make this bread again soon.

Wonderful! Had only dark molasses on hand so I used it and it turned out great. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. If you enjoy making bread, you need to make this recipe!

In spite of goofily glazing the loaf at the start of baking (and filling the house with a lovely burnt-sugar smell), this bread came out divine. I just reduced the molasses to 5 Tbs. and found it just right. Chewy, complex, just sweet enough: this is going to become a regular rotation. One note: be sure to bake the loaf completely--I reduced the time and as a result got a gooey center--such a shame to waste even a crumb! Mmm, think I'll go eat some now . . .

This is definitely my new favorite bread -- so delicious! I added a handful of toasted walnuts and a little wheat germ, and made a free-form loaf rather than using a loaf pan. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautifully. I didn't find the molasses taste overwhelming at all.

My husband loves this bread, and requests it over the many homemade breads I like to make. I think the glaze really makes it different and tasty, and we love the molasses taste.

This bread was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner and will be made again in my family.

The bread turned out beautifully, but I agree with others that the molasses can be a bit overpowering. I would consider using honey in place of some if not all the molasses next time. Overall though, very nice textured bread.

Rating: 3
The bread is very good, but, in my honest opinion, there's just a tad bit too much molasses in there. The taste overpowered the bread a little too much for my taste. Other than that, it's a wonderful bread that I will certainly be trying again soon! P.S. My husband's comment - he was unhappily surprised that the glaze is sticky after baking - other than that (and "THAT" has nothing to do with the taste, as he says)- wonderful!

Terrific recipe. Easy to make and tasted great! Especially loved the glaze. Will be making this regularly.

I MADE THIS BREAD FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND IT IS VERY NICE,IT MORE THAN DOUBLED IN SIZE, AND WHEN I MADE IT THE SECOND TIME, I USED ONE REGULAR LOAF PAN AND A MUCH SMALLER PAN AND MADE A TINY LOAF AS AN EXTRA. I AM ANXIOUS TO TRY IT TOASTED.LOOKS GOOD TO WITH THE GLAZE.

I tend to be very shy about breadmaking, but this loaf was a delight to make, and eat. Very easy for the novice breadmaker. Everyone loved it, and I earned extra points for making homemade bread. Sure it's more work than picking up a loaf at the nearest bakery or store, but well worth the extra effort.

Heavenly!! Very easy process that makes a beautiful loaf. It was the first of the three breads to go at my Thanksgiving dinner. I'm "afraid" of making yeast bread, but I've always had good luck with this one.

Easy to make & one of the best bread recipes I have. My husband, the bread lover, wants it all the time. It has a very old-fashioned taste to it. It would be great served with chili or stew.

This is a wonderful bread - I have been making this recipe since it was published and everyone loves it!
