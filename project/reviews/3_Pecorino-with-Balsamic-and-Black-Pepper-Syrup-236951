Very easy and beautiful appetizer that goes much farther than the effort involved. Delicious, different and not too filling.I sliced the cheese in small thin triangles and arranged them alternating up and down on a white square plate, drizzling a small amount of syrup across each row of cheese.There were no leftovers.I'd give this 3 1/2 forks if that was an option.

You can't go wrong with Pecorino and the recipe was easy enough, just nothing special.
