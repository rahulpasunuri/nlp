The tomatoes are the stars of this salad, so they need to be really fresh and ripe. I followed the recipe and alternated red and yellow tomato slices for visual effect and it was wonderful. Very easy and delicious. A perfect way to use summer tomatoes.

Like many other reviewer, I too used a combo of balsamic and red wine vinegar mainly because I just didn't have the sherry vinegar. I cut my tomatoes in wedges also and used fresh basil, tarragon and parsley as my herbs. My dinner guests were quite impressed and raved about the wonderful depth of the different flavors. I served this with Shrimp w/ shallot- Tarragon sauce on wilted spinach and a simple risotto and some rosemary focaccia that I got at the farmers market. Complimented with a nice mellow chardonnay. My dinner guests were quite impressed, especially with the salad.

I make this in the summer when herbs and veggies are plentiful. I also add cucumber slices and top with feta cheese. Great summer side when grilling.

Delicious! Tastes fresh and looks very pretty with the herbs and red onions. I used parsley and thyme, because it's all I had on hand, and it was perfect.

Great light recipe. Easy to make the only thing I changed was I used yellow and red tomato for color and added feta cheese. For anyone on weight watchers it's perfect.

Very good; sugar makes the dressing; shallot not necessary.

This is a fabulous recipe. It's the dressing that makes it so exceptional. I substituted red wine vinegar with about a half teaspoon of sherry and sprinkled Parmesan cheese over the salad just before serving.

Better than any restaurant salad of its kind that I've had. Only addition: sprinkled on some Parmesan cheese just before serving. Also used red wine vinegar with a touch of sherry.

This is the best dressing recipe I found for tomato salad. I wedged the tomatoes and then halved and made in bowl instead of flat dish. Also used Balsamic rather than Sherry vinegar and worked great.

I made this for a late summer cookout. The dressing was different. No leftovers!

Very summery and light. Although I cut the tomatoes into wedges, great presentation and flavor. A sure fire recipe for my next barbecue.
