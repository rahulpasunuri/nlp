I concur with the past two reviewers. Bleck! A very disappointing end to what would have been a perfect dinner....

blahyuck! I had such high hopes for this. (I love mascarpone). It was tasteless and kind of embarrassing.

It's hard to say where this recipe went wrong or what Flay was thinking . . . too much butter, bland marscapone . . . I would write my recommendations for correction - but I think the place to start is with another recipe.

pineapples turned out great! they needed a bit more roasting time, though. probably about 6 minutes each. i tried halving the glaze, but it turned out i'd needed the full amount. mascarpone is pretty tricky to work with, though. this recipe should point out that it should be brought to room temperature before mixing it. mine curdled very quickly. served pineapples with whipped creme instead. great success!

My variation of this was excellent. I was in the mood, so made some vanilla ice cream instead of the mascarpone. When visiting friends who had underripe pineapple, I thought of this recipe and suggested grilling it sliced. Worked a treat, tender, sweet pineapple!

I used fresh strawberries instead of blueberries and it tastes better and goes well with pineapple.

I loved the "grilled" flavor of the pineapple with vanilla ice cream. The sauce easily curdles, so take straight from stove top to grill. Will try with mascarpone next time. LOVED IT!!!!!!

It's okay if you like to eat a little pineapple with your butter. It was awful.

this was a huge hit. My vanilla beans didn't have seeds, so I used a high quality vanilla extract and a teaspon of powered sugar to offset any bitterness. The guests raved about this. Getting the rind off is a bit of work and took steak knives, you may want to trim them before you serve them.

Very easy dessert. Warm pineapple tastes wonderful with the marscapone. Whipped cream or ice cream would be a good accompanyment with the pineapple, too.

As my husband is lactaid intolarant, I made this without the mascapone. My family still loved it and this will be a keeper for the summer.
