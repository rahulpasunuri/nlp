This was horrible. Dry. Bland. It's a rubbery, chewy mess once it cools.

As others have said, pretty bland. It's so eh, it's not worth making--now I know. I had to try for myself. It's just a crispy disk of oats...I'd rather just make baked oatmeal.

Very boring recipe. I topped mine with almond butter and fig butter.

This is a pretty flavorless recipe but it's simple and has a nice texture. I cooked it in salted butter then used the egg yolks to make clotted cream. Served the pancake with clotted cream and cherry compote. It was OK.

I thought this was a fantastic idea! I quartered the recipe for one, 6 inch oat cake and that felt like plenty for one serving. I didn't have strawberries or applesauce, so I garnished with sliced cherries and a little bit of maple syrup, which was delicious!
