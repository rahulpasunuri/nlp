didn't love this soup. made some modifications and that may have made it less tasty. i added carrots, celery and stringbeans as i wanted more fiber and to use up veggies. i didn't puree as i wasn't sure how the green beans would color the soup. my husband thought it had too much tomato base. i will look for another soup recipe.

It is kind of silly how good this simple recipe is! I always have these ingredients on hand and can now whip up something delicious in just a few minutes.

I broke my food processor and covered my kitchen in half of this soup, but what remained was tasty despite that! I think blended would have been even better, combined the flavours a little more successfully. Will try again when my new one arrives...

When it's seasoned well with any combination of dried herbs and S&P, this soup is delicious and comforting on a cold winter day. I also added half a bag of fresh spinach at the end of cooking the soup, and it made it even better

This recipe was surprisingly easy to make and absolutely delicious! The blended chickpeas make this hearty and toothsome...and still healthy! I made it on a cold Friday night for my boyfriend and I and we finished the entire pot.

So easy to make when you don't have much in the fridge or pantry. Great suggestion from the reviewer that used herbs de provence - made it so fragrant and delicious.

This has definitely become a favorite at our house - and a healthy, tasty stand-by for times where I do not have much in the cupboard/fridge. My minor tweaks include using herbes de provence (in place of sage and rosemary) and adding a dash of red pepper flakes, a generous splash of red wine before adding tomatoes, and chicken broth (instead of beef broth). I also puree only half of the garbanzo beans. Delicious!

I loved the soup; great consistency, wonderful flavor, and you can use your pantry. I like the idea of adding red pepper flakes, but it very good as it stands.

I was pleasantly surprised by this soup. The rosemary and sage was what did it for me. I used a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes with their juice and only 2.5 cups of broth (veggie broth) It came out great! A filling and satisfying soup!

Who would have thought such a simple recipe would be so delicious? I served it as a first course for a special birthday dinner, and it was more popular than the main dish. I pureed about half the soup and left the rest for a little texture. I'm making it again in a crockpot, and I expect it to be just as good.

So I wanted a quick soup with ingredients that are in my pantry and I find this one. I had no rosemary so used basil and oregano instead. My husband went nuts and I've made it at least 5 times in 3 weeks.

I really like this recipe. It's easy and great for lunch. I usually keep the beans whole and add a splash of red wine with the tomatoes. I also like to add a little 1/2 and 1/2.

I don't understand all the negative reviews. This is a nice simple tasty soup with ingredients probably already in your pantry. I double the recipe since I usually buy 28 oz. toms. Our toddler can't get enough of it.

This was just OK. I prefer similar easy soup recipes on this site like Pasta e Fagioli. The flavors just didn't come together for me on this one.

My children adore this soup. I use petite diced tomatoes and I do not puree. I use alphabets instead of orzo :)

My whole family enjoys this soup. It's one of those dishes I make when I don't know what to serve - it's quick and the ingredients are always on hand. I use canned chicken broth and tiny pasta shells. For my 5 year old, I sometimes add a slice of American cheese to the hot soup and stir until it melts. This gives the soup a creamy consistency and rich flavor that may be more popular with kids.

The dried herbs called for in the recipe do a terrible disservice to a terrific soup. Fresh herbs make all the difference in the world. Also, I like to leave some beans whole.

This was quick and tasty enough for a weekday night dinner for the family, but not that special. It did remind me of the Tuscan minestone soup that I do love.

I love this soup & often make it without the pasta. I use chicken broth, and use more than 3 cups -- I just keep adding broth while blending until it's smooth. Also, a pinch or two of crushed red pepper flakes gives it a nice kick.

Have made this soup many times and love it. But you must use much more than 3 cups of broth, and I would definately suggest chicken broth. I puree only half of the garbanzo beans to keep some texture and use tubetti instead of orzo.

Not a fan of this soup at all. After tasting the final result my husband and I agreed and poured it down the sink. What a waste.

a yummy, quick soup that's nice to have around for lunch and light dinners.

A delicious and easy to make soup. I did not add the required amount of oil and used fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce instead of stewed tomatoes. I will definitely make it again.

I make this soup all the time in fall and winter. It's very satisying, my kids like it, and it's easy to make!

I really liked this soup. Pureeing garbanzo beans makes them very creamy tasting. I used Tubettini pasta instead of orzo - you can really use any small pasta!
