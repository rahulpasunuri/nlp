This was a huge hit on Christmas-in fact it kind of stole the show. I made the leeks and mushroom together after the leeks cooked down with great results. This is not a quick recipe to make however, so don't expect it to be done in less than 30 minutes.

This recipe was great but I refrained from giving it 4 forks since it was so time-consuming to prepare. Delicious overall though! Check out my blog for a more in-depth review - http://randomactsoffood.blogspot.com/

Overall a winner - But beware - its fussier than it looks. Makes a huge mess. Will make again, though there are simpler dishes that taste just as good. I was ready to give a negative review on the mess alone till I tasted it. I reduced the amount of stock to a cup and used veggie stock ( I just prefer it to chicken), and added a bit more lemon zest and nutmeg. I made my own breadcrumbs and used button mushrooms. The dish took me and hour and a half. and I served it as a main in a bowl with some baguette and butter. My wife and I ate the whole pan for dinner. Can see how it would go with poultry.

This was quite good although I found the topping rather overpowered the more delicate flavours of the mushrooms and leeks. Also I used quite a lot of utensils in the making. I will make this again but with some adjustment to the topping.

My husband loves this when he wants a vegetarian dinner. It would also make a grea luncheon/brunch dish as well.

I made this as a side for Christmas dinner and it was one the stars. Sadly, there were no leftovers to be had.

A fantastic side dish; very different. Can be used as a vegetarian main dish!

From a straight-up, "how many dishes do you have to wash after making this" standpoint, this dish is fussy. (Why can't you saute the mushrooms and leeks together? What difference does the parchment paper make?) That said, the finished product is excellent. A terrific side dish for a plain roast meat. A little on the salty side; I will probably back off on added salt when I make this next.

Excellent! I only deviated from the recipe by making my own breadcrumbs and used vegetable stock. Reheated the leftovers in the oven,,,and, it was still great.

I made this with baby bella mushrooms and threw in some cauliflower when I sauted the leeks (I did use the parchement paper, which is very easy to do if you have it, just tear some off). Used panko breadcrumbs that I had on hand. The dish was delicious, but I did find the prep a little involved, spent more than 40 minutes on it, including the grating. I sauted the mushrooms first, then took them out and used the same pan for the leeks. You still need a saucepan for the sauce (which was quick, but I cheated on the grated lemon peel and just pared some off and chopped it a little), and I used my mini-Cuisinart to chop the parsley and garlic. You can make it ahead and cook it at the last minute, which helps a lot.

This was fantastic! I made my own breadcrumbs from whole wheat bread and def would not recommend the Italian ones from the canister. My guests devoured the dish. I feel like so many people change up recipes, whereas I really followed this one pretty exact. The one thing which I would say is you probably just need to saute the leeks vs going through the trouble of using the parchment paper.
