This was so good. If you like smoke, I used chipotle powder instead of regular chili powder. Add a little mango or pineapple and some onion to the salsa. A real crowd-pleaser and pretty healthy as well.

Wow-was this great! Only change I made was to add more avocados just 'cuz I had them on hand. Served it in martini glasses at a small cocktail party -- it was the hit of the party!

Whooo-wee! This is awesome. Doubled corn for more of a side salad. I don't know about all that fancy cocktail glass buidness, but I'm making this now with jumbo shrimp, regula shrimp, frozen shrimp, pan fried shrimp...

they turned out great I added a little less garlic due to the previous reviews. They turned out great

If you like the taste of shrimp, this is not for you. It masks the flavor of the shellfish with pungent spices. The spices are a bit overpowering. On the other hand, the Avocado-Corn salsa has a neutralizing and softening effect on the shrimp which is complimentary.

What a truly wonderful series of sensory contrasts! Hot shrimp vs cool salsa, perfectly spiced rub (incl slight variations) vs sweet flesh of jumbo shrimp and natural sweetness of salsa, firm bite of *just* done grilled shrimp vs the creamy avocado base of the salsa. This recipe was a launching pad for our household to find other alternatives to the tired, pedestrian boiled shrimp with ketchup and horseradish. Man, I think I can still feel my tastebuds dancing from the party that was in my mouth from last night's tapas dinner! :-D

Wow this was extremely salty....Can't imagine why this was not a factor with any other reviewers.......1 1/2 tsp.of garlic salt was just too much....I could reduce this to half the amount....

One of my favorite recipes! I roast some onions and peppers and make tacos/fajitas with it as well. do yourself a favor and add a chopped fresh mango to the salsa. You'll thank me!

Made exactly as described. Had to use canned corn. My jalapeño was hot!

These were excellent. I didn't have garlic salt so used 2 cloves minced garlic and some salt - seemed to work fine. Cooked the shrimp in a contact grill, they were done in no time. As other reviewers had advised, increased the corn in the salsa (to 2 cobs). Served for dinner as tacos, with homemade corn tortillas, lettuce, grated cheddar, and a chipotle crema (blended garlic, chipotle in adobo, mayo, yogurt,a squeeze of lime, salt and pepper). Outstanding.

I made this as a main course for friends accompanied by grilled vegetables with panko on this site. Everyone had rave reviews for this. The rub is fantastic even if you decide not to make the salsa (which is also fantastic!) Definitely 4 stars.

Wow!! My guests raved about this! I added the 1/2 tsp brown sugar others recommended. I couldn't find ancho chili powder so I used chipotle chili powder but reduced to 1 and 1/2 tsp. It had just enough kick. I kept the garlic salt instead of powder. I also used a fresh farm stand ear of corn..out of this world!

This was so delicious! Made it as a first course for a party of 10 and it was a huge hit. Now, my husband and I have had this as a main course twice and we can't get over how good it is. The fresh corn crispness is they key. Wouldn't change a thing, it's great!

Excellent shrimp, made it with the avocado corn salsa. I have made quite a few different guacamole/salsa's and this one is very good. I made the recipe using Chipotle chili powder rather than ancho. It was fantastic, although a little hot for my guests. I served this with a few tortilla chips and cut the shrimps into 1/4s and ate on a chip with the salsa. This recipe was a huge hit. definite make again.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. Excellent results and many compliments from my guests. I did grill the shrimp and served them warm with the cold salsa. The little bit that was left over tasted good the next day too.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I was excited, because our family loves hot food and grilled shrimp. DO NOT waste your shrimp on this one. It is WAY TOO HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It really overpowers the wonderful taste of grilled shrimp. I thought the salsa was NOT so hot, if you get my drift.

This is a fabulous recipe as is. The grilled chile-rubbed shrimp over the cool avocado corn salsa was exceptional!

This is the perfect summer grill recipe. Good with a Sovignon Blanc. Satisfying degree of spice and very healthy too. I added it to the "rotation" and it's an every-20-days item throughout the summer. Cheers!

This was simple, elegant and delicious. Despite adding the oil to the spices before the shrimp (oops), I just tubbed the paste into each shrimp, it was an exceptional blend of flavors that melded wonderfully with the avocado corn salsa. I'm not even the biggest fan of avocado but with the raw, sweet corn the combination of smooth and crunchy was amazing. I served the salsa in margarita glasses with the shrimp around the rim and my guests were dazzled. It's a must try for any summer party.

Loved this recipe! Unfortunately our grill wasn't functioning so I cooked these under the broiler. They were delicious, but I bet with the charl of the grill would be even better. The Avocado & Corn Salsa really complimented the heat of the shrimp. So easy too.

A great take on this is to use medium sized shrimp and place the salsa and shrimp on top of a piece of melba toast. Great little bite size appetizer for a party.

Great recipe! My guests always love it. I have used frozen corn when fresh isn't available - it still tastes great but it is much better with the fresh raw corn.

Love the avocado corn salsa - very good!

Very good and easy. Next time I would either puree the salsa as it was difficult to dip the shrimp in it without a spoon or just skip the salsa, the shrimp were delicious without it.

My husband is not especially fond of shrimp --- until I prepared this dish. So easy and such a beautiful presentation. Since I had approximately 2 1/4 lbs shrimp, I doubled the amount of the spices and made twice the amount of the avocado and corn salsa --- with the exception of the jalapenos. It's simply fabulous dish and was wonderful as an entree for the two of us with leftovers. I highly recommend this dish to anyone who loves spicy shrimp.

The combination of the chili-rubbed shrimp with the avocado and corn salsa is absolutely perfect! I served them at a party recently - everyone loved it! I have made it several times already and anticipate it will be an appetizer that I will be serving for many more parties!

Made this tonight and it was AMAZING. Didn't have chile powder, so mixed chili powder and cajun seasoning with a bit of extra cayenne, and it was perfect. Served on warm corn tortillas and topped with grilled yellow peppers and sour cream. The salsa is absolutely fantastic even by itself. Will be making everything again, but will double the recipe!

Great for entertaining. Everything can be prepped ahead of time and coked in minutes.

Great recipe. Added 1/2 tsp brown sugar as other reviewers suggested and garlic powder in place of the garlic salt. Used 1 lb extra large shrimp and put on skewers for grilling. Would also be great over a salad or as an appetizer.

So good and so easy. I did the brown sugar addition as well and really loved it. I also used a roasted poblano and extra lime! Yummy!

Made this tonight - at the last minute remembered the brown sugar note and added a couple of tsp molasses to the marinade. I've never cooked shrimp for such a short time over such high heat - this will definitely be the way we do it from now on. Doubled salsa recipe and threw in a can of black beans, and with the shrimp and some tortilla chips that was dinner for 4. Quick and delicious and, if only we hadn't boiled and eaten all the farmers' market corn yesterday (used frozen thawed), plenty good enough for company. Especially with heidi4's grilled pineapple recommendation :)

Really good. I got a lot of compliments on it--Father's Day Brunch! I thought it was going to be hotter because of the other reviews, it was probably medium hot. I added 1/2 packed teaspoon of brown sugar and I am so glad I did! Little bit of spice, a little bit of sweet. Crowd pleaser. I served with the Avacado/Corn Salsa and some Sangria!

Rating: 4
Fantastic! My entire family loved this. I agree with the raw corn bringing it up a notch. I added pineapple to the grilled shrimp and fresh pineapple as a topping option. It was a nice counter to the heat of the pepper. Delicious, will make again for sure.

I served this as a first course. Great presentation. The rub is a little on the spicy side and should be used sparingly. The salsa is a must.

Made this and the avocado corn salsa for dinner and both were fabulous. I had to substitute for the ancho chili powder as well. We skewered the shrimp and grilled them outside. I will make this for my next party, and it was so easy.

Really yummy. A cool dinner for for a hot summer night. As long as you have the grill going make the grilled pineapple with tequila brown sugar glaze for dessert.

What a great recipe! I made this for a very large party - it was easy to make 4 batches and had a ton of requests for the recipe. I cooked the shrimp in a grill basket, which made it that much easier. The avocado salsa was easy and delicious, too.

This recipe was awesome. the cool thing is-you can really play with the ingredients and still make a great dish. i used shrimp and scallops wrapped in bacon over the top of the salsa!

Awesome! We really enjoyed this dish and I would definately make it again! The giant shrimp draped over martini glasses was such a great presentation and the salsal was amazing - I've never used fresh corn in a recipe before - really nice. I will definately make this again! (PS: I used the George Foreman Grill (worked great)!

Great sauce! I tested 4 recipes last night on my husband and two friends in preparation for my neighbors 75th birthday celebration (Im grilling a main dish for 20). All were huge hits and Ill mention the other recipes later. Because I had so many things going on, I prepared the spice rub earlier in the day, as well as peeled the shrimp. Then, I threw it all into the Ziploc bag and let marinade. My guests loved this combination but mentioned that I may have to use less spice for those with sensitive palates. Looking back, I think I accidentally doubled the chile powder (I halved the recipe, but forgot to halve the chile powder). But they LOVE spicy so they were crying for more. The other experiments last night: Grilled jumbo shrimp with lemon and oregano, Grill roasted clam linguine, BBQ beef ribs with molasses-bourbon sauce. My guests raved about all!

Didn't have ancho chile powder but used smoked jalapeno powder with a dash of cayenne - excellent!! Served it with fresh corn, cherry tomato, green bean, bleu cheese salad for oohs-and-ahs.

I don't fix shrimp very often and decided to make this for a small party at the last minute. Good choice. Very tasty. I followed the spice directions exactly. Shrimp was perfectly seasoned and not too salty. I didn't add much salt to the salsa and should have used a bit more. Even my husband, who generally likes shrimp, but only deep fried, loved this one. I must agree with the author. I prefer the shrimp hot. Tasted much better than at room temperature. Not quite sure why the salsa directions said to add the cilantro and jalapeño just prior to serving. I added mine and chilled it for a couple of hours, as I do with regular salsa, and it was fine.

What a wonderful first course for a gourmet meal. You can serve it at the table or in the backyard. It was sooo good, my guests all said they would make it...even for a main course. The hot shrimp and cold salsa are wonderful together.

I didn't have garlic salt on hand so I substituted fresh garlic which I combined with course sea salt and ground into a paste using a mortar and pestle. Other than this one change, I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. The Corn Salsa was the perfect compliment to the spicy shrimp

Not only is this dish great looking, but it tastes GREAT too! At the last minute, I started with 1/2tsp of Cajon spice rub, then added the rest of the ingreds using garlic pdr instead of salt.(I rarely use!) And it was great! the cool Avo-Corn salsa was a sensa-tional match with the spicy shrimp! The entire group loved it! Another keeper for sure! ~: )

A great kick with the chili powder. However, the garlic salt made the dish way too salty. Next time, I'd use garlic powder instead of the garlic salt and then add kosher salt so I can have control over how much salt I want. Otherwise, a very good dish.
