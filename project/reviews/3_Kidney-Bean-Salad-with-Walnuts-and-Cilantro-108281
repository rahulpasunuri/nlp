Not sure why so many have given this such good reviews. It is by far not one of the better bean salads I have had. It is a nice quick salad, but it lacking.

Nice, simple recipe. Tried it with chickpeas instead! Great lunch idea.

There are better bean salad recipes on epicurious - like the three bean salads with black beans in them. The romaine also didn't add anything to this recipe. Rather bland compared to the options out there.

hmmm... this looks suspiciously like a staple salad eaten in the Republic of Georgia... delicious, though, by any name.

I have to say that this was good. I ran low on red wine vinegar so we used 3tbl spoon evvo to 1 1/2tbl sp of red wine vinegar. I also only used 2 cans of beans because I only had five people eating this. I would make this again because it is good and easy to make.

Really delicious, cool and filling. I used ground cumin instead of cumin seeds, adding it to the dressing to taste. I also added a touch of honey to the dressing, to balance out the very sharp red wine vinegar I had on hand. A great summer dinner.

This is a great recipe that goes well with chicken or burgers. It is a healthy substitute for baked beans. I used balsamic vinegar instead of wine vinegar and added cayenne pepper and kosher salt to taste. I also used 3 kinds of beans: kidney, black, and pinto. You should only stir in the walnuts right before serving so the nuts don't get soggy. Everyone I make this for loves it! Give it a try!

This was amazing! If you like Indian food and are a fan of chaat you will go ape over this one. I made it as outlined, and as we were eating, I realized that I had forgotten to add in the beans. Beanless, it was ok as a lighter side dish served with the baked wrapped tilapia on this site. Next time, and I definitely envision many next times, I will use chickpeas and serve on the side a dollop of plain yougurt dusted with paprika. Yumm.

I really enjoyed this, but I'm a huge fan of dried beans. I reduced this for my family of 4 and reduced everything proportionately except the onions. To 2 cans of beans I added about 2 Tbsp. of finely chopped red onion. I didn't have cumin seeds and just used ground cumin. Over red leaf lettuce this was a simple, enjoyable salad with grilled garlic chicken and spicy mango salsa. I thought it was fine left over.

This makes a very big batch, at least twice what my ten friends could eat, even though it is very good. The walnuts added a nice crunch, but they didn't work really well as leftovers because they got soggy. Next time, I'll make a bit less and also add some chopped celery for a bit of extra crunch. I am one of those unfortunate people to whom cilantro tastes like soap, so I substituted flat leaf parsley, which was perfect.

I hate kidney beans so I substituted pinto beans because I knew they would be tasty with cilantro. We are also allergic to walnuts so I used pecans instead! It was fabulous and everyone in this household loved it!

Very tasty. Nice to have the crunch of the walnuts in there, and the toasted cumin seeds give it a lovely, almost smokey flavor.
