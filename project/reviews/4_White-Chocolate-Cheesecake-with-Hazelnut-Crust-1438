Excellent. I made two changes though: used pecans instead of hazelnuts in the crust and used a different sort of cookies as we can't get graham crackers here. I also replaced the hazelnut liquor in the cake with some Bailey's (though I think this step could have been skipped altogether). Texture and taste of the cake were lovely. I may increase the white chocolate to 150 grams next time around. Cake was baked in about an hour and I served it the same evening to rave reviews.

While this is an very good cheesecake, I did think that the hazelnut liquor,nor the white chocolate were tastable after the first day. The cheesecake sits beautifully as most do and the texture is very good, too. However, I've made a number of cheesecakes with equal texture and taste yumminess that did not include expensive extra ingredients such as the white chocolate and hazelnut liquor and will not make this version again.

Wonderful. Made for a dinner party and it was a big hit!

This was my first ever cheesecake. I had to throw out the first batch because it was completely overcooked and looked terrible. Now I pay more attention to how the cake actually looks than to the cook times in the recipe. Second batch came out great. Not sure all the work with the hazelnuts was worth it-I couldn't really taste them and it seems using the extract would be simpler if you just want a hint of the flavor. I found the blocks of white chocolate at Trader Joe's.

What a great basic cheesecake recipe. I used this as a jumping off point-- because I didn't have Frangelico, I used peppermint schnapps & a drop of peppermint oil, and made a plain graham crust. Used vanilla sugar instead of regular. Yum! Vanilla Mint cheesecake! Next time, will use a dark chocolate base. I am sure that as is, the recipe would be great-- since it was fab my way. Rich but not forklift heavy. My new base recipe.

This was my first time making a cheesecake and it came out awesome. Decadent as my aunt described it. I've made it twice now and it even got good reviews from people who aren't big cheesecake fans!!! The only problem I came across was that I had to bake it for and extra 45 minutes, but it came out perfect afterwards.

Does anyone know how well this will freeze? I want to bake it off then thaw it and serve for Christmas. Please advise. Thank you!

I made this for a Thanksgiving gathering and although it was one of many desserts, it was devoured completely in about 10 minutes. Delicious and very rich.

This is a recipe that will become a favorite of everyone. Serve it at a dinner party and it will be the conversation for the evening. You will not make this recipe just once. It is definitely a four fork recipe.

Awesome cheesecake base recipe. Made it low carb and lower fat. Used more hazelnuts and less crackers for the crust. Used Neaufchatel cheese instead of the cream cheese and Splenda instead of sugar. Also sugar free chocolate melted and swirled in instead of the chunks.This is a great recipe.

Delicious and simple! I made this to get rid of some excess cream cheese. It came out perfect! Because my husband is allergic to hazelnuts, I omitted the Frangelico and subsituted toasted pecans for the hazelnuts, which added a subtle kick. I am considering using the crust with pecans for all my cheesecakes.

Not a cheesecake lover myself, I made this recipe for guests. I wasn't particularly pleased with the outcome, but this probably stems from the substitutions I made to save some time. I'm noting them here, so you don't make the same mistake. I used store-bought graham cracker crust, white chocolate chips and whipped cream cheese. Overall, the cheesecake was so-so, so I probably won't make it again.

Have been making this cheesecake since 1992 when I first saw it in the magazine. Excellent...and gets better as the days go by..

I have made this cheesecake for Christmas a number of times. My sister (a fanatic for cheesecake) loves this one! I put whipped cream and white chocolate curls on the top before serving.

Fabulous... went so fast that i had to sneak a bite off of someone's plate. one thing... the top got a little dark, but i spread on a thin layer of white chocolate ganache and it looked great!

This one's a keeper. The cracking encountered by others can be minimized by putting a pan of water under the cake while it is baking. If the cake still cracks, cover the top with a little ganache as I did. It also serves as a great platform for the addition of a few white chocolate curls to dress it up a little.

Having never baked a cheesecake before, I was attracted to the ease of this recipe. However, I was not ready for the many requests for the recipe, it was a huge hit. The hazelnut flavor blended well with the Perugina white chocolate. Definitely a keeper!

I made this for my husband's birthday (he's a cheesecake freak - even our wedding cake was cheesecake.) We loved this cake! Excellent flavor, the Frangelico was just strong even not to over power the cake. The toasted hazelnut crust - perfect compliment. My husband's requested that I make this from now on as his birthday cake! I followed the recipe to the letter, it was easy to make, only one little crack that disappeared once the cake settled. If your a cheesecake fan this is definitely a winner.

Terrific cheesecake! I took the comments to heart concerning the not-so- strong hazelnut flavor and made a frangelico sauce (just your basic whisky or rum type butter dessert sauce but substituting frangelico for the other liquor). You just need a dribble of the sauce over the cheescake to make it rich and flovorfull.

Got rave reviews, even though the hazelnut flavor (in crust & filling) was pretty subtle. When I poured the filling into the crust, it reached the top of my 9" springform pan! Luckily, it fell as it cooled on the rack. I placed a 9x13" glass pan with boiling water on the rack below to try to prevent the top from cracking. It still cracked, but after it fell, it was hardly noticeable. Baking time was longer (maybe b/c of the bain marie?) - about 1 hr., 35 min., and the top was a light golden color. I used 4 layers of foil - and some butter did leak out. I'm not a big cheesecake fan, but I DID like it a lot (and so did our friends).

I made this for Christmas two years in a row and everyone loved it. I had plenty of hazelnut and white chocolate flavor even though I just used Bakers brand white chocolate (all I could find). The key to this recipe was to not overcook it so that it comes out creamy and delicious

Very good. Couldn't find imported white chocolate locally and also did not have 24 hours to let it rest (try six hours). Who knows, it might have rated four forks if I was able to make it as written.

This cheesecake is excellent. I've made it several times and it is better than I remembered each time I make it. To the person that said that it was just alright, you need to make it again because you must have done something wrong. This is the best cheesecake I've ever made.

My father is a chef a the Culinary Institue of America and I made this cake for Thanksgiving, when i brought it out they didn't beleive I made it. The only thing I changed is that I added a cherry topping to it and put the cherries in circles going around. It makes it look so proffesional looking it will dazzle all your guests. This recipe is going to be a new tradition every year.

The second time I made the white chocolate cheesecake, I made it without the hazelnut liqueur and used twice as much white chocolate because the first time it didn't taste like white chocolate as much as I wanted it to. I also substiuted an oreo crust, very good!!! I would defintely make it again.

This was delicious. Because we follow a low-carb eating plan, I made the crust entirely with the hazelnuts (skipped the graham crackers) and sweetened both the crust and the filling with Splenda sweetener. I also made a strawberry puree and cooked it down to a thick sauce to serve as a base, passed the extra to spoon over the top. A little whipped cream (splenda again!) and it was as good as any cheesecake I've eaten anywhere! Next time may try with almonds for the crust and Amaretto in the filling...

My husband adores white chocolate. I made this for his birthday when it was first printed (1992) and then lost the recipe! Now that I've found it again, I'll be sure to store it somewhere safe!

This recipe was okay, but not as great as I thought it would be from the previous reviews. I have definitely made better. Although, all of my guests raved about it. I followed the recipe exactly and it didn't have enough hazelnut taste in the cheesecake itself. The crust was delicious though, but I had a hard time getting the husks off the hazelnuts.

I made this for a party and everyone loved it. They thought it was from a bakery. It cracked; so, I took the tip from below and covered it with whipped cream and white chocolate shavings. It looked really impressive and tasted wonderfully creamy. Fresh hazelnuts in the crust gives great flavor too. My husband deems this as a definite "make again"!

I won't give this 4 forks because it has to be something I can't live without. But 3-1/2 is worthy here, and I won't argue with the rest that this is a keeper. I served it with a raspberry coulis and mint leaf for color. I also substituted sugar for Equal (Atkins diet) worked great!!

Delicious! I've made this recipe numerous times and it always gets compliments. I "pretty" it up by heaping white chocolate shavings all over the top and then pipe fresh whipping cream around the border.

I substituted macadamia nuts instead of hazelnuts, and amaretto for frangelico. Very creamy and yummy; not as nutty as I'd expect (next time, no subs!) Got raves at a potluck picnic! Topped with whipped cream b/c it cracked....

This is my all time favorite cheesecake recipe. I have made it at least 10 times and everyone goes crazy for it. I wouldn't change a thing to this recipe - just perfect!

A truely excellent European cheesecake. I have made it several times, and it's always a winner!! The one change that I would suggest is in the crust. Use 1 1/4 cups of vanilla wafer crumbs instead of the graham crackers. Omit the sugar, and reduce the butter to 3 tablespoons, and have it softened instead of melted. Enjoy!!

This recipe is excellent. My family wants me to make it all the time. The Frangelica makes it!
