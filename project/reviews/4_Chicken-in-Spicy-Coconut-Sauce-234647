This is one of the best tasting recipes for chicken that I have found. I brined chicken strips overnight. I substituted fresh cilantro for coriander and dried chilies and a teaspoon of garlic chili sauce for red chilies. I couldn't locate gangal so I omitted it.

It ok for me. It was not bad.

I rarely give 4 forks, but this recipe is fantastic. I sauteed the chicken in peanut oil until a little brown to prevent skin from getting to soggy. I had tamarind concentrate at hand and I used a couple tbs. Did not find Holland, used 6 red jalapenos. Found fresh turmeric. Used good quality thai coconut milk, but only 38oz. Served with rice and cucumber with nuoc cham dressing. YUM!

This dish was fantastic! The sauce beats that of most restaurants - the coconut milk perfectly tempers the spice. I substituted habaneros for the Holland red chiles and soy sauce for the tamarind.

This turned out absolutely delicious! I used two serrano chiles instead of the Holland reds (possibly should have used three) and juiced 1/2 of a lemon instead of using tamarind (possibly should have used a whole one.) The sauce was creamy and gently spicy -- reducing the sauce uncovered definitely made some of the heat steam off which was a good thing. I would definitely make this again. Try serving it with sticky rice!

Great recipe. I didn't have access to fresh tamarind or fresh lemongrass so I used tamarind paste and lemongrass paste instead. Served with plain white rice so as not to conflict with the lovely flavors. Would definitely make again.
