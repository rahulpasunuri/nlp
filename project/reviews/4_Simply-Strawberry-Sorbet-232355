@ Cook from Atlanta - the egg white acts as a binding agent, making the texture smoother and silkier. Same reason you're seeing egg whites in a lot of cocktails lately (that, and the albumen, when shaken up, makes a pretty & stable foam on top of the cocktail). Always a good idea to avoid using factory farmed eggs, though, for the reasons that have been showing up in the news in recent months.

What kismet! I love the Bent Spoon's strawberry sorbet and came to Epicurious looking for something that looked like it would be similar and see that this recipe has been adapted from there. I tried this and indeed, it is delicious.

I'm giving four forks from tasting the sorbet halfway through the freezing process through the feeder tube. So far so good! I want to add the egg white but I am not sure I will follow through. I am daring, but It seems odd to eat raw egg white in one's sorbet without knowing the purpose. Would appreciate any input on that.

Best sorbet I've ever eaten! I found this recipe after doing strawberry picking - was looking for ways to use up a couple of extra pounds. It was surprisingly easy and well worth the effort. I used filtered water and included the egg white as suggested. It was fantastic! (Also made the Strawberry Panna Cotta with Strawberries & Honey from epicurious and it was restaurant quality delicious - would highly recommend it!)

I used fresh-frozen strawberries and substituted limoncello for lemon juice: Wonderfully smooth, tasty and delightful!

This was just okay. Maybe it's my ice cream maker. Since I am a big fan of the Bent Spoon and go there all the time, I much prefer the real deal directly from Gabrielle.

Excellent. I did not have lemon juice at the time so I substituted 2 Tbsps. lime juice. Simple and delicious. Also good with bits of chocolate added.

Having just acquired an ice cream maker, at the request of my children, I set out to find a good strawberry sorbet recipe to use as a test drive. Coincidentally, being a transplant from Princeton, I know the Bent Spoon and their fabulous sorbets. We've all just sampled the results of our labor and have declared this the best strawberry sorbet we've ever tasted - and this was with out of season strawberries!

I just made this and it is delicious! Fortunately, I had frozen strawberries earlier and I didn't have to wait for the sorbet to chill. I pureed it with the cooled syrup and put it right into the ice cream freezer. I didn't use the egg white. I did use bottled water. This is a keeper!

Wow, this is outstanding. Would really recommend, especially using fresh/organic ingredients if possible.
