Fantastic recipe. I've made this 5 times now and is a staple for all my barBQs or when I need to bring a salad. Once I did not have zuchini so I used eggplant another time I used a mix of zuchini and roasted fennel. They both worked amazingly well.

No rating because I didn't make the whole recipe yet. However I did use the dressing for a pasta salad with 6-7 different vegetables and some basil and it worked great.

I substituted sun dried tomatoes and replaced the zucchini with peas

Very good... I really like whole wheat pasta in general, so this was great. I cut the zucchini in rounds (about 2/3" thick) and then cut the rounds in half and skewered - much easier than watching them fall threw the grill. I took the suggestion of others and cold rinsed the pasta. I added a orange bell pepper diced (just because I had it). This could be a meal within itself. This actually kept fine for a couple days in the fridge... I would actually say it got better. Good picnic dish.

I served this at a cook out we had at the rest home where I work. All 54 residents loved it. I used regular pasta instead of the whole-wheat and ground basil instead of whole leaves since that was all I could get a hold of in such a large quantity. I'm definatly looking foward to making this for the boyfriend and myself.

My husband and I loved this. I used cherry tomatoes and green onion as those were what I had. I will definitely be making this again.

made this with regular (not whole-wheat) pasta. it was good, but pretty obvious--nothing exciting or unusual about it. could be a good staring point for something more interesting. don't let the pasta sit hot--rinse it in cold water to stop it cooking. i used balsamic, but a fairly acidic balsamic. corn would be a good addition. the way they have you do the zucchini is weird--the shape is wrong for the salad. i would maybe do it in cubes instead. if the slices are too thin, the flavor is just lost. feta was too strong and wrong for italian dish--you could skip the cheese and it would be fine (olives and olive oil give it enough fat).

I read the reviews on this recipe before I made it and saw a few that said it was bland....this was anything but! It definitely tastes great and I will make this over and over. I had a few changes:extra basil, balsamic vinegar and tomato-basil feta. It was delish.

The flavors in this were very good...but I would seriously rethink the directions. Rather than toss the pasta with the vinegar mixture while still hot, I would shock the pasta in cold water first and rinse it until cool, then add it. By adding the hot pasta to the vinegar, the acids are absorbed and result in a "mushy" overcooked pasta. A change I made: Grate the zucchini and saute it rather than slice and grill.

I made this for my mother's 50th birthday party and it was a big hit. Everyone loved it. I altered it using white wine vinegar, ricotta cheese and more basil. Everyone loved it.

I thought I would try this in order to use up some of my bounty of zucchini. I was not thrilled. I agree with another cook who said that it lacked flavor. I added extra salt, pepper, and hot pepper in order to preempt this, but the salad was still a bit on the blah side. Also, definitely NOT tasty when cold, so if you want to try it, beware of the large volume that it makes and plan accordingly.

LOVED this recipe. Made it for (picky) guests and they loved it too! Added a few more vegetables (grilled red pepper, mushrooms and red onion) and used balsamic instead of the red wine vinegar. I will make this again and again.

We seem to be happiest when cooking something involving a cornucopia of veggies. While looking for something new to do with zucchini, we chanced upon this one. To add flavor, we included crooknecked squash, eggplant, roasted red and yellow peppers, increased the basil per another review, used tomato-basil feta instead of plain, and subbed white balsamic vinegar for the red wine, resulting in a rich complement of vegetables. Grilling the veggies the night before saved time, too. Thanks for another great recipe!

I've made this several times, it's always a hit. I think it's best served at room temperature; I've made with and w/out the feta, both are good.

I've got to wonder what everyone is raving about. This salad is bland and really needs more herbs and/or spices. The basil is a good start, and there are plenty of salty ingredients (olives, cheese), but the overall effect is blah. It does look great, though.

excellent! i double the zucchini b/c it's the grilled zucchini that makes this dish so great

Very good. Took some time to grill the zuchinni though. But other than that, it was pretty easy. Made it for an outdoor, boat party, it was perfect.

This was delicious. I would recommend peeling and seeding the tomatoes before adding them to the hot pasta. Also, I like to dry roast my garlic before adding it to a salad. It takes off the harsh edge and leaves just the yummy garlic flavor. (Just add as many cloves as you will be using (still in the skin) to a dry skillet and cook for about 10 minutes, turning the cloves periodically. They will give off a nice aroma and get quite soft.) My family loved this and it's a great dish to take to a picnic.

Wow! My family loves this recipe! I make this sometimes as the main meal cuz it makes so much! I add a little bit more balsamic vinegar cuz it seemed a little bit dry, other than that this is one of the best pasta salads I've ever eaten!

Very good combination of late-Summer flavors.

I used regular spaghetti for this. I grilled slices of yellow crook neck and zucchini, the red onion and garlic on my grill pan for the carmelized flavor. I didn't use vinegar. Instead I heated up the vegs and feta at the last minute with 1/2 cup chicken broth and the olive oil. Tossed the hot pasta in there and loved it!

A wonderful recipe to serve! Made as written but this time I added shrimp to the mixture for more of a main course meal. High praise from the family!

We loved this dish! Had no whole wheat pasta so used regular penne with great results. Also used a combination of feta and ricotta. Simply delish!

This one is a winner. It is a classic mix of ingrediants that taste terrific in the summertime: zukes, feta, basil, etc. The balance of the flavors is wonderful. It looks very lush when tossed togather. Many times I've been proud to take this recipe to a picnic, or serve it to friends.
