Facing a glut of lettuce from my CSA share and having been curious about grilling, broiling or otherwise cooking lettuce, I have this recipe a shot. Delicious, simple, and surprisingly flavorful. I tried some plain (very good) then added some spring onion, a few parmesan shavings and some pepper flakes for garnish (also tasty).

This was a quick, easy, and delicious side dish. Frying them on medium-high heat until really brown gives them a sweet, smoky taste.

Really tasty! I was just looking for an easy way to use up romaine, and this was much better than I expected. I like a well seasoned dish as much as the next food lover, but I have to appreciate a recipe that provides great flavor from just three ingredients.

I prefer to grill this. I also like it with crumbled bleu cheese on top. Added near the end of grilling, it softens and adds a lot of flavor.

I've done this in the pan and on the grill. Like mine with salt and pepper and once one side is done, I sprinkle with freshly grated parm cheese.
