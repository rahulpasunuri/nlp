Very nice & tasty, but used only half of the piment as a I thought it may be too spicy for us.

Don't know why I was surprised, but this popcorn is delicious (though to be honest I did not find Marcona almonds and used slivered instead that I happened to have in the pantry).

Piment D'Espelette, a mild chili pepper, is grown and used by the Basques of the Espellette region in place of pepper. As I am allergic to peppercorn, I use it often. It gives a more savory and less floral flavor than pepper, and is quite delicious. I buy mine at Williams-Sonoma. Due to my allergies, I often make substitutions. The key is knowing how ingredients taste and how they might affect the dish. You know how some people can read music, and "hear" it? Some of us can read recipes and "taste" them. Think back to when you first were learning to read, and that life-changing moment when your skills allowed you to read the story rather than just the words.

I tried a cook from L.A.'s version but added powdered sugar for the paprika that was used instead of the french stuff. I enjoyed the result but my friends said it tasted nothing like popcorn
