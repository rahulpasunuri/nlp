These bars are great! Made these twice now and were great both times. THe first time I baked the crust 15 min and I thought it was overdone at first, the sides looked a little too brown for me, but I went ahead and assembled the cookie and by the end it ended up being perfect. The second time I baked the crust 12 minutes and it looked a lot better and tasted great. I read in a couple reviews they increased the cherry filling so I added the whole 18 oz jar of cherry preserves instead of stopping at the 1 cup because it was so close anyway, and I thought it was a little too much. The second time I went with the recipe (1 cup) and I thought it was perfect. The crust and topping are really universal so you could use this with a variety of fruit fillings. Also be sure to spray the foil, it really sticks on the sides. I cut off the edges anyway, but the spray makes it a lot easier. Also, I couldn't find the cherry brandy so I just omitted it and the flavor was great! I got rave reviews!

These are delicious. I've made them twice. The first time I made the cherry filling as outlined in the recipe and the second time I made an apricot filling omitting the dried fruit. The apricot was good; the cherry was great! I made the crust gluten free using 274 grams original rice flour mix, 30 grams sweet rice flour and 1/4 heaping teaspoon xanthan gum in place of the all purpose flour.

EXCELLENT! Changed it a bit..used raspberry jam instead of the cherry jam and used unsweetened coconut instead. The bottom crust got me worried b/c it was a bit more moist than I'm used to but after cooking, it came out delicious, almost cookie like. Biting into a piece is a melding of sweet and sour with a bit of a cookie crunch. Will definitely make it again.

These have been a huge hit in my christmas cookie collection for a couple years now. With all bar cookies I line my pans with double thick foil and then a layer of parchment sprayed with non-stick spray. This allows you to pull the whole bar from the pan to make cutting and clean up easier. I always go heavy on the filling and the topping and have no problems with them holding together.

These are excellent. However, there are a few changes I would recommend for the directions. For example, if you make the filling ahead and refrigerate, you will want to bring it to room temp, or warmer so it will be spreadable over the base. Also, I think you could use a little more jam, as there is very little filling to cover the base. I do not see why you have to form the dough for the crust into a ball; just put the clumps in the pan and push it into the bottom. Also, I am not sure you need to line pan with foil. I have made other bars with a crumb type crust, and no foil is needed. Finally, if there is more filling, perhaps the topping will adhere better. I would push the streusel down onto the jam so there is a better chance it will not fall off the finished bars. All in all, a great recipe and well received.

This recipe went over very well at a Wine Tasting Party that I catered. I used regular brandy because that is what I had on hand. I also used unsweetened coconut because I was using it in another recipe. I did not add any additional sugar and it helped to reduce the sweetness of the bars. I used my mini food processor for the filling, but I mixed the dough and streusel by hand using a pastry blender and my fingers. I only baked the bottom crust for 15 minutes and checked and turned it often until it was a light golden brown. I also reduced the cooking time for the whole bars to about 20 minutes. My oven heats from the bottom so I put an overturned cookie sheet on the lower rack to distribute the heat well and not burn the bottom crust.

Excellent - a sure winner - I will be making this one again and again.

These were good. However, they were a bit difficult to cut and have them stay in one piece. Also slightly too sweet for me.

These bars were excellent and kept well over several days. Since I did not have kirsch, I substituted amaretto, which worked well. When I took some of these bars to work, my co-workers wanted the recipe.

These were absolutely delicious. They were the hit of a cookie party I went to. I only cooked base for 15 minutes and used dried bing cherries and cherry preserves from Trader Joes. I learned the hard way that the aluminum foil must be sprayed well and the cherry filling cannot be spread right up to the edge. It sticks!!

These were quite good. I was pretty sure that there wouldn't be enough dough for the base and took maybe 1/3 cup back from the topping to put into the pan. After tasting them, though, we've discovered that we like the thinner spots in the base, so will not do that again. Also, watch the baking time -- I was prepping another pastry while this crust was baking and didn't watch it carefully enough. The thinner spots were overbrowned at 22 minutes. I'd have to agree with another reviewer in reducing the baking time to maybe 15 minutes. Additionally, since I'm giving these as gifts to folks who don't use alcohol in any way, I left out the Kirsch. Next batch, I'll add a little bit of almond extract to the filling. The filling, by the way, also didn't look like it would cover, but keep working it -- it will!

I've made this cookie a few times now, and every time I like them more and more. For a little change I made them with cranberries and orange marmalade in place of the cherries and preserves. I also added a tablespoon of limoncello in place of the alchohol called for in the recipe. The orange cranberry flavor was perfect for the holidays, and the color contrast was nice too!!

I couldn't find the cherry flavored brandy, so I used regular brandy. I also had to used unsweetened, dried coconut because sweetened flaked is not available here. Made no other substitutions or changes. I am not a big fan of cherries, but these bars are great!! They are in the file of Christmas cookies for sure and I would probably make them on different occasions as well. I am gifting these, so I will update with the public response.

I made this for a dessert potluck - every last morsel was eaten to rave reviews. My boyfriend (who hates coconut and doesn't tend to like nuts) ate three pieces. The coconut really blends well with the other flavors, and almonds and cherries are a truly wonderful combination. I didn't use the kirsch in the cherry filling - I added about 1/4 tsp of almond extract instead. I was short on time, so I only baked the crust for 15 minutes and didn't let it cool. I also put the bars in the freezer straight out of the oven to cool enough to make it into the car ten minutes later. Any recipe that can survive those indignities and still taste absolutely fabulous is a definite keeper.

I have no food processor, and it was still pretty easy to make. I just whisked the dry ingredients together well, then used a pastry blender to work in the butter. At the coarse meal stage, I made a small well in the center, and added the extracts and milk all together. From there on, I just blended the dough with a fork, and later my hands. I found there was just barely enough dough to make the base after the streusel dough was reserved. Next time, I'll probably reserve 3/4 cup packed of the dough for the streusel. Maybe because the base was so thin, I didn't need to bake it for the time specified either - I took at least five minutes off both the base baking and the whole cookie baking. These cookies do grow on you - you have one, then you get a hankering for another one. Texture and flavour were great - my co-workers were quite happy with these. Since there's a significant amount of fruit and nuts involved, you can rationalize them as healthy too :-)

Made it for an office Christmas party. It's easier than it sounds (and looks). It got lots of compliments. I just used whatever cherries I could fine, and substituted apple cider for the kirsch.

Easy, festive and delicious! These were a great addition to my Christmas Cookie collection. They are a nice contrast to the other traditional cookies I make each year.

Delicious and easy. Don't be afraid of the coconut-it's a compliment, not dominant. Like a previous cook, I used cherry preserves and dried Bings from Trader Joe's. Tart filling, sweet and crisp crust. I'm glad I pressed the topping down a little; kept it from falling off.

These were a big hit when I brought them to a party.

These were very good and so easy to make. I omitted the liquor from the filling. The topping was a bit too crumbly so I might try pressing it down a bit harder next time. I got both the dried bing cherries and the tart cherry preserves at Trader Joe's.

Delicious! Since this gets made in the food processor, it's pretty easy. I don't know that I would bake the crust alone for the time allotted again--it was a touch overdone to my taste, but overall very good! I still rated it 4 forks because it's STILL delicious and now I know to slightly underbake the crust for the future, and I will be making this in the future, probably as a Christmas cookie tray item.

These were wonderfully moist and tasty - I got rave reviews when I made them - definitely will make them again!

I just won my company holiday baking contest with this recipe. I followed the directions precisely except that I only baked the lower crust for 10 min instead of 22 (22 min made the crust burn). For decoration I dusted the finished cut product with icing sugar and created a "winter snowy wonderland" scene.

These cookies are really excellent. Wonderful flavor. I couldn't find ingredients exactly as specified...used dried tart cherries and bing cherry preserves. Had some of the streusel topping fall off at cutting, but plenty remained on the bars. Found a little overdone on the edges at the recommended baking time. Might reduce the oven temp. next time.

These were easy and delicious and I will definitely make them again. All I did differently was to leave out the coconut and cut the amount of cinnamon in half.

I made these bars last year for the holidays and what a response i got.Everyone has been asking me to make them again this year. They are by far one of the better recipes that I have made over the years.

Very easy no brainer recipe with wonderful flavors. I get requests for the recipe whenever I serve them. Don't stress out about finding tart preserves or dried bing cherries - I use what I find wherever I happen to be shopping and the bars still come out great. (Although my favorite preserves so far are the Swiss brand "Hero" Black Cherry flavor.) When I make these for kids I increase the filling by 50%, they seem to think gooier is better!

I don't normally give 4 stars, but because these are so easy to prepare and so good, this recipe is a winner. I agree that there is not quite enough dough for the base, I borrowed some from the topping to cover the bottom of the dish. Also, in a pinch - you can use a can of cherry pie filling. It's still declicious!

This is a very tasty recipe. However, I find that making a double batch so the cookie dough fully fits a standard sheet pan is the best way to go. I also don't bake the cookie as long as recommended-I bake it 15 min. maximum it browns too much at 22 min. (that may be because I live at 6,000 ft. in altitude). I also hate coconut so I make the streusel with just the almonds and drizzle a powder sugar glaze over the top of the bars before I cut them.

These were excellent cookies! Tart, yet sweet with a light almond flavor. Easier to make than I thought when I first read the recipe.

Excellent for the holidays...very pretty for giving to others. But I did this without the cherrys. But only because I had cransins and plum jelly on hand. It worked well, as they still added the tart flavor. I'm making another batch tonight.

I made these as a dessert for a Greek dinner (instead of super-sweet baklava)and we all devoured them! They're really delicious! Reasonably easy to prepare, but I made the mistake of using 3 strips of medium weight foil to line the pan instead of 1 strip of heavy foil. I won't do that again. Made it hard to lift out and hard to peel foil off. Went to three large, St. Paul area grocery stores looking for dried cherries, which proved to be impossible to find, though I did find cherry-flavored cranberries! Those sounded disgusting, so I substituted rinsed and well-drained sweet cherries for pie, along with sour cherry preserves. I'm making them again for Christmas!
