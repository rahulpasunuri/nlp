I altered this recipe at the recommendation of others, added lots of pepper, garlic and lemon juice to finish off the recipe. I also ended up using quite a bit more liquid (5 cups unsalted chicken broth, a little organic vegetable broth, and a cup or two of water). I cooked my entire soup 10 minutes longer, and didn't add the chicken until the last 5. It turned out fantastic. The caraway was absolutely lovely, I might add a little more next time because I loved the flavor.

Well, I followed a lot of the other reviews that said the soup was too bland if you followed the recipe exactly. So, I used 5 cups chicken broth, 1 cup water, and added an 1/8 cup fresh lemon juice. Also, I added fresh fennel chopped up, and used tequila lime chicken sausage instead of chicken breast. I removed the casing. The soup turned out sooo awesome. The caraway seeds are important. The really amplify the flavor. My boyfriend loved it. I would definitely make this again.

This is a respectable mild soup recipe. I made it as-is, but because some folks complained it lacked flavor I threw in a vegetable bouillion cube (Rapunzel brand). The caraway seeds add fun little touch. It was more STEW than soup. A nice humble fare for a snowy Sunday afternoon lunch.

I loved this soup. It was easy to make and I added salt and pepper to give it some more flavor. I didn't mind the flavor not being so bold as it is an easy and healthy thing to eat any time. Next time I might try subbing some sausage as other's suggested and subbing some whole grains instead of orzo.

Chose this recipe because I had chard and chicken that needed to be cooked. Yes, this soup is very healthy, but oh so bland. Would not make this again.

The subtle flavor would be enhanced by using all chicken broth rather than half broth & half water. I used a bit more caraway seeds, which also helped.

This recipe is a winner. It's just a wonderful combination of comforting ingredients. I didn't have any caraway on hand so I used a generous tablespoon of cumin seeds. I substituted orzo with a cup of previously prepared grains (a mix of rice, millet, barley w/cardamom seeds). I also needed to add more water. The hints of cumin & cardamom really partnered well with the cauliflower, grains, greens & chicken ...yum!

This is one of our go to soups for health and taste. We use boneless chicken thighs (cook a little longer) and more caraway then called for but otherwise make as is. Love it.

Well, blandness wasn't a problem. I added smoked sausage (pork andouille) instead of chicken and it really dressed it up. The sausage taste comes through in the broth (I left it in for approx 4 minutes, diced). Finished it up with the juice of a small lemon. I added white pepper but found that it combined with the sausage for a little too much punch. If you add sausage, trust the sausage, stay away from add'l salt or pepper. Taken as a whole, this is a good recipe with lots of tinkering potential.

I liked the idea of subbing fully- cooked sausage instead of chicken, so I used an uncured pork polska kielbasa. Instead of just slicing it, I opted for a large dice & decided to lightly brown the sausage as the first step. This was removed & kept warm before adding the onions & caraway seeds. Since I wanted the chard to be softer, it was added at the same time as the orzo & cauliflower. I wouldn't recommend using the red chard unless you like your broth to have a purple/pink hue. It seemed a little plain, so I topped it off with some parmesan cheese. The soup was STILL bland and lacked depth of flavor. A bit of a dissapointment!

I added celery and garlic to the onions, and lots of black pepper at the end. It made a very flavorful soup! Good-quality broth makes a difference, too....Half of the broth I used was turkey stock I froze after Thanksgiving (great recipe for turkey stock on this site, too!).

This was pretty good. I made some adjustments based on others' reviews: used wild rice instead of orzo and used a mix of collard greens & spinach since the store was out of Swiss chard. I also upped the chicken broth to water ratio. It's a nice, clean soup. I wasn't swooning, but I was happy to eat it on a Wednesday night.

This was delicious--I substituted organic wild rice for the orzo and it blended perfectly. I cooked the wild rice separately beforehand in chicken broth, as it takes a lot longer to cook than orzo. I received a lot of compliments on it!

Pretty decent soup. Would likely lend well to carefully chosen amendments.

This soup was excellent. I added fresh basil leaves, approx 1/2 cup chopped just because they were available. My husband 's comment was "the soup was excellent". I would serve this to guests as a special treat they have never tasted, the caraway seed makes it special.

A healthful soup that tastes good. I cut the stem and center rib out of chard (used leaves only) & followed the exact recipe. Next time I'll slice the stem & center rib, then add along with the cauliflower. Although orzo is good here, I like the idea of playing around with other options--maybe wild rice.

I have made this soup over and over and find it to be a good basic recipe. I don't really like caraway seed but in this recipe it is delicious. My kids love this soup too.

Rating: 2
Maybe I did something wrong, but my chicken wound up not cooking through. I would recommend cooking the chicken in advance, or else maybe cutting it into *really* small / thin strips. Aside from that, it was a very average chicken soup, and I'll probably never make it again, just because there are so many other chicken soups out there. It'd be like going on a second date with Dave Coulier.

I've made this soup many times now and love it with the following changes: double the caraway seeds, four cups broth and 2 cups water, use boneless thigh meat instead of breast (put it in a little earlier as it takes longer) and I add juice of half a lemon or lime after soup is cooked and then pass cut lemons for bowls.

I've been making this soup for several years now. Variations inlcude adding "southern greens" (a mix of turnip, collard and spinach) as well as the chard. Last night I used barley instead of orzo. You can sub/mix broccoli with cauliflower. Whatever you try it doesn't alter the basic flavour. Add a good wholegrain rye and there's dinner.

Not bad. Deserves 2.5 forks. If you've got leftover cauliflower and chicken kicking around, it's definitely worth making. Caraway seed adds a new twist and elevates soup from bland to "delicate".

This soup has become a staple at our house. I do make one fairly significant substitution though - I use a smoked turkey sausage in place of the chicken. The flavors in this soup are addictive and perfect for Fall and Winter suppers.

Very simple and delicous results. Would only double the recipe because we loved it!

I agree with the cook from Baltimore. It was OK but nothing to do backflips over. The caraway is a must. Without it, the soup is bland.

Wow! Never would have made this recipe based on the ingredients, but after reading the review, I gave it a shot. Absolutley outstanding, definitely don't skip the caraway seeds, they made the flavor complex and yummy. We did spinach instead of swiss chard; otherwise stuck to the recipe, and will definitely make it again!

Rating: 2
Simple to prepare and the ingredients go nicely together; I just wasn't doing backflips over it. I would suggest trimming the leaves from the stems in the chard, chopping the stems, and adding them with the cauliflower step, or they may be tough. I agree that the caraway seeds add a lot. I don't care for orzo so chopped up 2 medium red potatoes in 1-cm pieces instead, which I liked a lot.

I am a soup freak and this is one of my husband's favorites. It is wonderful! Serve with crusty bred and brie and a cold, dry white wine and you are in heaven. The only change I make is to double the recipe and I use chicken broth I buy at Trader Joe's and it becomes easy enough to make after a day at work.

AMAZING! Don't let the caraway seed scare you away. The soup is a complex, delicious and healthy one. Easy, and if use of homemade broth makes it all the more incredible. THIS IS A MUST!!!

Not bad, but nothing spectacular either. I would not make it again because there are plenty of other soup recipes out there to try, maybe some of them a little more flavorful.

Very good and very easy. Agree that it could use a little more zip but extra salt and pepper brought out the flavor nicely. My husband definitely wants more.

I couldn't BELIEVE that this simple recipe would taste so wonderful. The caraway seeds and swiss chard are an unusual combination but it works. My two dining companions loved it. I'll most definitely make this soup often.

Think I threw in mustard greens instead of chard. Seasoned w/soy sauce rather than salt. Added strips of non-fat cheese (cholesterol restriction), and it's just great!
