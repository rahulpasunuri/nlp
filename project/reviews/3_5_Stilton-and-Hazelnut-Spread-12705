love stilton, or any blue - and this was a different way to present the flavors that I so love. Have done the blue drizzled w/ port reduction so many times - so I welcomed a bit of a change. Served in ramekin along side various crackers and pretzel rods, and dried figs and apricots. Was a hit! Especially liked the dry fruit/cheese combo washed down w/ a very yummy cabernet...... will make again.

My British father-in-law, who is obsessed with stilton said this was only o.k. and I have to agree. I made it exactly as written, even bought port especially for this, and we shouldn't have bothered. I won't make this again.

Tired of the same old onion or ranch dips/spreads, I tried this one. I LOVE any type of blue cheese. This was fantastic! The strong flavor of the cheese is offset by the flavor of the port. Not everyone liked it, but those who did couldn't get enough!

I think the results will depend on the quality and age of your stilton. A bold-flavored one, as mine was, will overwhelm the other flavors. In that case you may want to increase the cream cheese and/or port. I'm going to try this again with a milder stilton, or else increase the other ingredients.

Instant Classic! This has been added to my file of favorites, my mom now has a copy as well, and the next holiday party I am invited to, I know exactly what to take! Classy enough for entertaining, and yummy enough to nibble with wine while standing at the kitchen counter cooking dinner.

This was SUCH a hit at my party. Really, the only thing I adjusted was the amount of port, I tripled the amount...I just couldn't taste it otherwise. I also made it two days early to let the flavors meld. Not for the meek and not for the boring, this is great food.

I used the best Stilton I could get, much to the chagrin of the cheese manager (making a spread from a Neal's Yard cheese??!), and it was wonderful. A nice addition to a mixed cheese platter for hors d'oeuvres.

This spread was very flavorful. Because I found the taste of the port tawny overwhelming I cut in almost twice the amount of cream cheese in the end. It has kind of a sweet taste, but it is quite good. While I probably wouldn't make it twice, I suggest trying it out for yourselves.

This was a big hit as a pre-Thanksgiving dinner hors d'oeuvre. Not for the faint of palate, with big, bold flavor from both the stilton and the port. This is a nice break from crudite and boring dips/spreads.

I prepared this recently for hors d'oeuvres and wine before going out for dinner, and it was thoroughly enjoyed by all, one of whom is from a restaurant family. I served it with rice sesame crackers and a rose wine. The Stilton was too ripe for my taste when I purchased the cheese, and the bleu cheese and very dry sherry were excellent in this recipe. It's on my permanent hors d'oeuvres list!
