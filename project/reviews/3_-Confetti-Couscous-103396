This recipe appeared in Gourmet as part of a complete menu featuring the Fennel-Crusted Roast Pork. The ingredients in this recipe gave me some concern, particularly the fennel bulb and the prunes, but I'll tell you we thought the end result was wonderful. It did not taste like licorice (which I was afraid of), was so easy to make, and tasted terrific. Will definitely make it again.
