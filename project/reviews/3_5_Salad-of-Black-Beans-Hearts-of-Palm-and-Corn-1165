I made this to serve with tamales and it was pretty good but nothing special in my opinion. I used fresh corn, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It is an adequate side dish but I'm not sure if I will make it again when there are better recipes out there.

This was so good. Even my husband who says he dislikes cilantro ate every bit. It will be one of my regulars!

I liked the recipe but like some of the other reviews state, it's not that exciting. I think the dressing needs something else, not sure what...

I like all the ingredients here but thought the salad was uninteresting and not that flavorful. I wouldn't make this again.

I thought this simple and easy to prepare salad was delicious. I added chopped avocado to the mixture, doubled the recipe and served it with chicken enchiladas. Everyone loved it.

This is a great little salad to know about. Keeps beautifully, colors and textures are great, flavor great, and it's easy to make, plus different to boot! The dressing is subtle and a bit smoky in flavor. It works really well, letting the ingredients shine through. Tip: Olives are also good in this.

Great recipe - I added a drained can of Rotel tomatoes for a bit of spice. Also Trader Joe has frozen already roasted corn kernels that add even more flavor.

I'm not sure if I adored this because I was famished tonight -- but with that caveat allow me to say that this is delicious. I didn't have red onion, so I used green onions. When I tasted the dressing, I thought the coriander was a little too much and considered dumping it for a plain oil and vinegar dressing. Glad I didn't. It worked extremely well with the ingredients. My 17 year old son is taking leftovers to school tomorrow for lunch.

Originally, I got this recipe from a friend who used fresh cut strawberries (in season) or blueberries INSTEAD of the tomatoes. It's really really delicious that way too. She also suggested soaking the beans overnight (or for several hours at least) in the dressing. The remaining ingredients can be added before serving. A crowd favorite

I having been making this recipe for years! I am always asked to make this for potlucks. I often used it as a salsa for Grilled Chicken or Pork Loin. I do add more cumin and coriander to taste. I sometimes will add a jalenpeno as well.

Recently I became a vegan and when I did I realized that this recipe which I have been making for over 15 years, is vegan. It is delicious and whenever I take it to a pot luck everyone raves. How nice to have a vegan recipe that everyone likes!

I made this exactly as is and it is delicious!! Subsequent times I have found it infinitely variable. It definitely improves with time and chilling, and feeds at least six side servings, perhaps 8. I have taken it to several gatherings, and am always asked for the recipe. This is now a summer favorite at our home!

I made this salad a few weeks after making another similar salad featured in my local weekly newspaper, and I find I like the salad from the paper much better, so thought I would pass it along. It seems to incorporate many of the previous reviews as to less oil, addition of sugar, etc., but I think one of the key ingredients is the chopped garlic. The Salad: 1 can whole kernel corn, drained; 1 can black beans, rinsed and drained; 15 grape tomatoes, each cut in half; 1 small red onion, peeled and diced; 1/4 cup minced fresh cilantro; 2 cloves garlic, peeled and minced. For the Dressing: 1 Tbl. sugar; 2 tsp. white vinegar; 1/2 tsp. salt; 1/4 tsp. ground cumin; 1/4 tsp. freshly ground black pepper; 2 Tbl. canola oil. This salad does improve with some time on it, so give it at least 2-3 hours before tasting to adjust seasonings. The salad is great with either fresh or canned corn. I usually double it, and if using canned corn do a mixture of yellow, cream and white - it is very colorful as well as delicious. If adding avocado, dice it up and add it in just before serving. The hearts of palm also work nicely here.

I've been making this salad since I clipped it from the magazine in 1992. For those who think the salad is bland - let it sit in the fridge for a few hours before serving. Hearts of palm need to absorb the flavors. Also, why add avocado? It only turns brown and mealy when it sits out or is stirred into a salad. I'm sticking with the original.

Rating: 3
I have made the recipe 2x and found it better with these changes, most suggested by previous reviewers: Add the zest of one lime. Omit the hearts of palm & use an avocado instead. Substitute cumin for the coriander. Omit olive oil & salt & pepper. Sustitute 2 cans mild Ro-Tel canned tomatoes w/ chiles for tomatoes. Cut red onion back to about a third rather than a half.

Like some other reviewers, I made this salad and thought it lacked zazz. I needed a vegetarian option to go along with the slow-roasted Cuban pork I was serving to my book club, though, so I thought I'd give it another try. This time I used a 1/2 tsp. cumin and 1/2 tsp. coriander (as others had suggested), but I also added the grated zest of one lime. I made the dressing separately, and after tasting it, I drizzled in a little baking sugar (about 1/2 tsp.), and that made *all* the difference. It really seemed to bring out the lime flavor. Instead of throwing out the remainder of the salad three days later, there was only a half cup left, which I eagerly ate for lunch the next day...

Tasty. I used fresh corn, cut off the cob, and sauteed it first with garlic and a little jalapeno until it was slightly browned. Think this probably made a big difference in flavor. I also used a 1/2 teaspoon coriandor, 1 teaspoon cumin, and some very good sea salt.

I made this on a hot summer day just because it seemed refreshing and light and full of veggies. I omited the corn just because it isn't my favorite and I thought that the dish was just okay. It looks very pretty with all the beautiful different colors but the taste was only okay. I'd make it again but it isn't one of my top faves.

This was simple and good for a summer day. Hearts of palm have a strong taste on their own, but the flavors in this salad came together very well. I added both cumin and coriander powder and some onion salt.

I didn't have corn one time I made this so I substituted with avocado - also yummy.

Added some cumin as well as the coriander, let it marinate overnight, and got rave reviews. YUM.

I really enjoyed this salad, as did many at our party. The only changes were to use cumin instead of coriander and splitting in half the amount of tomato and adding chopped red bell pepper. A simple summer salad of heart of palm and sliced tomatoes drizzled with olive oil and lime juice has been a favorite for years. I love the additional ingredients.

My wife made this for a BBQ party we had and it was a big hit. The best thing was that it was very easy to make. You have to play with the salt, pepper, cilantro and lime juice to make it work. Needed some work but was very good at the end. Very quick to make as well.

Unlike most, we love the heart of palm in there! I just added a bit of extra lime juice. Very refreshing and a part of our Cinco de Mayo party for years! We've even put any leftover in a quesadilla with some cheese.

Great salad, dump hearts of palm. Several variations possible: 1. Add uncooked zucchinin and tomatoes. Adds color and crunch helps. 2. Try cumin or coriender-cumin powder. 3. Try fresh grated ginger instead of coriender powder.

I loved this, although made a few adjustments: fesh corn (instead of frozen), eliminated the hearts of palm, used grape tomatoes, scallion (instead of red onion) and cumin (instead of coriander). A great addition to a menu with a southwestern theme.

Wonderful salad! I used grape tomatoes, and I added 1 t. cumin and a dash of ancho chile powder. I will defiantly make this salad again!

This has become one of my staple salads that everybody loves. If possible use fresh corn, cut from about two ears. I omit the hearts of palm and add a diced roasted, peeled red bell pepper or more tomato. I also cut down on the red onion. Sun Vista brand black beans are seasoned and make the salad that much better.

The variety and freshness of flavors is really great. Dump the hearts of palm and add avocado and sweet red bell pepper to the other veggies. I also used both cumin and coriander (about 1/2 t coriander and 3/4 t cumin. Lime juice is essential.

Wonderful Salad! Loved the combination of ingredients!

Delicious, and I am not crazy about black beans! They are not overwhelming in this salad however. I just made a couple of adjustments to my taste: cumin instead of coriander and chopped parsley instead of cilantro...simply because cilantro tastes "soapy" to me! The lime flavor in this sald is very refreshing!

Rating: 4
This is a very tasty salad! Instead of the teaspoon of coriander, I used a bit more than a half teaspoon coriander and ground cumin. I also added less onion as I could tell my onion was quite potent. This is the first time I've had hearts of palm, and I must say that the next time I make this salad I will leave them out. They added nothing to the dish and cost a good bit. Maybe I got substandard ones, but they were sort of mushy and pretty much tasteless.

I've made this salad several times, and while it is fine as written, I sometimes add diced avocado (just before serving)instead of hearts of palm, and have used ground cumin instead of ground coriander, or a pinch of both. I think some diced red pepper would be a nice addition, and I plan to incorporate other reviewers' suggestions from time to time. A very flexible recipe for a most tasty salad.

What a wonderful salad. I make it for parties, bbqs, etc. all the time. Everyone raves about it. I add bit more lime juice, coriander, salt and pepper. I also substitute tear drop tomatoes, cut in halves, for the large tomatoes. The bite size tomatoes, with their sweetness, make a nice change. Keep it in the fridge for a few hours before serving and it gets even better.

Rating: 2
Super fast and very good. I used green onion instead of red, and instead of the olive oil, I used a Best Foods citrus-ginger dressing in equal amount. I did add the full amount of lime juice then, and it was perfect for me. I also used twice as many hearts of palm (originally by accident, according to the size of the can, but I really enjoyed them and would add the same amount next time). Great for a party or potluck as something different.

This recipe is so incredibly refreshing! Makes a wonderful appetizer ( served with nacho chips) or great as a summertime vegetable side dish. I have to make it at least once a week in the summer. Can't go wrong with this one. I do omit the hearts of palm though; not much flavor, doesn't add color, and do not care for the texture.

Rating: 4
This is one of my favorite salads and I didn't think it could be improved, but over the weekend I made it leaving out the hearts of palm, which I find have little flavor and an uninteresting texture, and substituting a smallish jicama, cut into about half-inch cubes. Wow! The jicama is so sweet, juicy and crunchy that we think the salad tastes much better with it.

Doubled this recipe and matched it with grilled pork tenderloins and quesadillas (w/ cheese, chorizo and tomatillos) for a summer get-together. Worked great. The salad is easy, looks great, and can be done well ahead of time. I did add a little honey, a little soy and a tiny bit of cayenne to the dressing, plus a nice dose of salt and pepper. Think it helped a lot. Guests ate every bite!

This was delicious when made with a different dressing. This dressing is way, way too tart. I made one with chili honey, lime juice, oil, cumin, salt, pepper, and a dash of ancho chili powder. Then it was delicious!

This is one of our favorite recipes! My two kids (10 & 22 years old) are always begging for it. I made it for a crowd yesterday for a 4th of July gathering and got quite a few requests for the recipe. Light, healthy and very pretty with all the different colors and textures. Only thing I did a little differently this time was, instead of ground coriander I used freshly ground cumin seed, but I've used the corinder in the past and that was good too. I also always use more lime juice than called for just because we love the tangy taste it gives this!

Great colors, tastes good (even without the cilantro). If you layer the ingredients by color in a circle (like a bullseye), rather than mixing all together, the initial presentation is striking.
