The sauce was really good but the cardamon was strong and I thought it gave the chicken a really odd taste with the lemon. If I make this again, I'll cut it way back and probably just include it in the sauce, and omit the lemon peel.

Great way to kick up the old chicken breast. Overall moist, succulent, uniquely flavored chicken. I would double the amount of mint (roughly two fresh bunches) and the amount of cardamom. My sauce was never brown - but its still damn tasty. Oh, do yourself a favor - buy a can of pineapple chunks in pineapple juice. And to those people who thought it was a quick recipe - you are far more skilled than I am! Lemongrass rice - perfect sidedish.

Just made this tonight - we forgot to get lemons/lemon peel, so we sprinkled a little juice on after the chicken hit the pan. Just made it by the instructions and served over rice - fantastic! Best recipe for boneless skinless chicken breast in quite some time. Husband hates coconut, but am thinking cilantro and lime in the rice next time will work very well. So fast!

Shaking up the weeknight, this recipe offers a nice change from the mundane. The flavors are sweet and crisp, and the lemon zest adds a subtle highlight to the mellow spice. Like other cooks, I also used cilantro in place of mint, and it turned out great!

Served with the coconut rice. Prepared the dish as directed. Good but not great. Very simple preparation which is a big plus and its a nice change of pace.

This makes a fas,t easy and special dinner for during the week. While I followed the recipe as stated, the next time I might had a hot spicy red chili pepper and some garlic at the end for more of a flavor explosion.

YUM!!! Was that ever good! I have to admit that I did have to tweak it a bit, only because I was missing a couple of things... One may think my changes would make it another dish, but I think it may be even better. I used the Cilantro Coconut Rice recipe on this site to go with it, sooo, I put cilantro in this dish instead of mint! Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm! Delicious And...I didn't have any cardamom... but I did have allspice...really, it was just a dash to give it something...Ha ha ha But it was so good! I promise to buy some cardamom and make it again soon...

I took other's advice and didn't add the last bit of butter. I didn't add garlic as suggested by other cooks. I served with coconut rice. I used the same amount of ingredients for half the amount of chicken and I rubbed the cardamom on the chicken and put the citrus peelings on it for about 3 hours before cooking. I would make it again, but it wouldn't hurt if there was more flavor, but adding garlic doesn't interest me. Cinnamon and cloves are recommended to compliment cardamom or I'll see if I can find it in seed form and grind it myself. The article says much of the flavor is lost when bought pre-ground. This may be a spice worth finding whole to truly experience its light flavor.

Loved this recipe. Great flavor. Added red pepper and bok choy (when adding pineapple) -- and decided at the last minute to add fresh garlic. Glad I did. Will make again.

Tasty and easy...(except I had to extract the cardamom from the pods)...even though I didn't have any mint whatsoever. Per other reviewers, I did add garlic.

This was the best meal I've made in a long time (served over coconut rice as others suggested). Always looking for a short cut, I used a bag of frozen pineapple bits which worked very well and had enough juice once thawed.

This was a good dish. My wife is not a huge fan of mint, but she liked this dish. I served it over coconut rice and it was great. I would deviate from the recipe by browning the chicken a different way. Go ahead and season it as directed, but then dredge in flour (lightly), brown the chicken for about 10 minutes, flipping halfway. Put the chicken on a plate and place in a preheated oven at 200. This would prevent the chicken from becoming soggy. It's a good dish, but searing chicken requires a hot pan - not one on medium.

Dont know about bland, this dish was awesome from begining to end. My boyfriend and I loved every bite. I did do something different, I used bone in thighs it did increase the cooking time but i perfer thighs over breast. I am going to try it with boneless thighs to speed up cooking time. I added cayanne pepper to give it a little kick. It was so sweet and savory with the coconut rice. As long as you can cook chicken you can prepare this dish.

This recipe is one of my staples. Dont' feel you need to have fresh mint; I have used dried mint and even mint jelly in a pinch with great success. You can definitely cut down on the butter to make it healthier. I always serve it with coconut rice.

I read another review that said that this dish was plain, so I added a bit extra lemon zest, cardamom and mint. I also omitted the last Tbsp. butter. My wife and I were very pleased. Went well with coconut rice and Simi Chardonnay. One thing: the pepper quantity wasn't mentioned, so I just ground some in.

was really looking forward to this one...ended up rather disappointed. a bit plain considering all the potential for great flavor, but i like the citrus + cardamom combination w/the chicken. i plan to experiment w/that for a marinade for grilled chicken. won't make again as written.

The kids loved this chicken recipe (but not the coconut rice side dish). I must have used large chicken breasts, because they were done in the time specified by recipe. Had to cook about 10 minutes longer after adding the pineapple chunks.

Pretty tasty weeknight meal. Added garlic and served with rice.
