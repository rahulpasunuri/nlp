I've made this recipe on several occassions with exceptional results every time. Although the vinaigrette can be overpowering for some, almost everyone, ever time, has had nothing but rave reviews for this dish. It's one of my favorites and I will continue to keep this as part of my "best of" repertoire.

With all due respect to A Cook, who gave this a negative rating because he/she didn't like killing lobsters, that is a personal statement. Not a review of the recipe. I have made this recipe about a dozen times, and I have my fish monger half cook and split the lobsters for me. Saves much time and mess in the kitchen. I have used cilantro instead of basil for a change, and have also used grapefruit rind with the orange juice for a change. Everyone who has had this dish has loved it. Have plenty of bread for the sauce.

Sorry, I can't advocate a recipe where you toss live lobsters into a pot of boiling water and have to listen to them scratching at the pot to get out while they slowly die. I would think epicurious would be a little more civilized...

I didn't find the vinaigrette as good as others seem to have. However, it was a good complement to the lobster. I drizzled it on tails before broiling with good results.

The flavor of the vinaigrette was wonderful. Be careful about the cooking time of the lobsters; ours were about 2 lb and therefore we had undercooked. Also, next time I will heat up the vinaigrette a bit. It cooked the lobster down quickly. Except for some small changes, it was a wonderful recipe

Wonderful. (Lighten the salt a bit, though.)

The chipotle vinaigrette is special. Makes a great combo with lobster. I've also made the vinaigrette with grilled shrimp. I'm not a total lobster lover, but this would have to be my favorite way to eat lobster. By the way, I used a food processor instead of blender and it was fine.
