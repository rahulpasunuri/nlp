Tasty, quick and easy. These did not stick to the pan for me... which may have been luck. Next time I will bake 2 minutes more and add a dash more salt. Wonderful texture.

I have at least 4 popover recipes and this one is superior in taste and ease of preparation. To the cook asking for a solutions to the popovers sticking to the tin, try greasing and then lightly flouring the tin cups first.

Tasty -- but they all stuck to the popover pan so the presentation was subpar.

Not sure what I did wrong, but when I was trying to take them out of the custard cups, they got stuck and deflated. Anyone have a suggestion on how to avoid that? They tasted amazing though, even deflated.

Easy and delicious! I use a little less butter and have also found that skim milk works fine.

These were incredibly easy and tasty -- they look just like the photo in the recipe. I used custard cups because the cups of a muffin tin seemed too small. Leftovers reheated in the oven the next day and were fine. With the butter in the bottom of the cups, these taste a little like croissants.

This is a fantastic recipe! So easy, and really yummy because you can pull them out of the oven as soon as they are golden enough for your taste. I'm not a big fan of really dark popovers, so I just take them out right at 20 minutes. I also used less butter in each cup of the pan to cut down on the fat, and they were perfect. Huge hit with my guys at home!

This is a great recipe. My 10 year old made them (under my supervision), followed the recipe exactly and the result was incredible! Ate them with jam for breakfast.

I've made popovers for the holidays every year for the past 5 years. This is the best recipe yet. Thanks Epicurious.

They were delicious!!! My favorite ones were those from BLT, as many others have mentioned. These are pretty close, simple, eggy, fluffy, and delish!
