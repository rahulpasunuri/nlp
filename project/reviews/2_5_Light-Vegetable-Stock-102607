Very easy and makes a large quantity, but I found that the taste of black pepper overwhelmed the taste of the stock and of the pumpkin soup in which I used it. I would definitely reduce the amount of pepper if I were to make it again -- I like pepper, but that shouldn't be the only flavor one tastes.

A head of garlic is the same thing as a bulb of garlic.

What is meant by "heads" of garlic? I've only heard cloves and bulbs.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, potato peels and all. It made a very nice stock, with good depth of flavor and a light golden color. This easy and inexpensive recipe makes about 4 quarts of stock.
