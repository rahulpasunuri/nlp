I made this and it was a big hit with my greens-hating (usually) husband. I ground up a whole chipotle in adobo sauce using a mortar and pestle, which was kind of inefficient, so next time I will try just chopping it. and I just cooked the damp greens (I hand-squeezed them) along with the bacon, instead of sprinkling the crisp bits on top. But it was very delicious, served with roast chicken and basmati rice.

What a coincidence! This week I received a ton of mustard greens in my CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) box. I went on this site and there it was . What a great recipe! However, be cautious about the amount of chipotle. Actually I just used some of the sauce and it was fine. I do admit to chopping it a little finer and cooking it a little longer at the end, adding a little Wolfgang Puck vegetable broth as needed. Will definitely make again.

My dinner guests enjoyed this side dish; a nice alternative to the standard spinach or salad side dish. The chipotle is a nice touch, but be careful to use the recommended teaspoon- otherwise too much will be overpowering..
