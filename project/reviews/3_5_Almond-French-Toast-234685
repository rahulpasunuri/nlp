Almonds burned before bread was nicely browned.

Its great! I added a bit of cinnamon to the mixture and serve it with coconut, fresh berries and real maple syrup for a real treat.

a nice twist on french toast and incredibly easy to make. i didn't have half and half, so i used the hazelnut creamer that i had in the fridge, skipped the sugar, and added a bit of cinnamon. tasted great.

I own an inn in Nova Scotia and have made this 3 times so far to the rave reviews of our guests. Instead of the vanilla I use almond extract to give it an extra almondy flavor.

This was a delicious recipe and I would make it again, especially for a special occasion. Be careful not to burn the almonds as they cook faster than the bread. Adding blueberries and strawberries made it very pretty and enhanced the french toast.
