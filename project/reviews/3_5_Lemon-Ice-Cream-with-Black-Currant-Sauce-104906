I made this exactly as the recipe called but slightly reduced the salt. It has a smooth lemony taste. I served it over a fresh black berry cobbler and the two were perfect together. My teenage sons were very appreciative.

Unfortunately I didn't read the other reviews regarding the salt before I made this recipe. The salt was so overwhelming that we threw out the whole batch of ice cream. Other than that, it was creamy and lemony. I'd definitely make it again, keeping all ingredients the same except for the salt.

I would make this recipe again. However, I found the final product created by this recipe to be too salty for my taste. In the future I will delete the salt.

I made the ice cream according to the recipe, and it was fabulous. I enjoy the tart lemon and usually have to add more, but not here. The salt is used to bring out the bright flavors. I wouldn't omit it. Nice texture.

I have seen icecream made with a stand mixer and dry ice... you litterally toss in some dry ice (doesn't take much). it evaporates away as carbon dioxide (same stuff we exhale) and is extremely fast. You keep adding more and letting it blend and evaporate until it is as thick as you'd like.

Excellent flavor. I really like the lemony-custard effect. Made exactly (except for the salt correction) and skipped the sauce. very, very good. Made the mistake of not letting it chill enough before putting it in the ice cream maker, and it was too soft. Transferred to a bowl and let sit in the freezer and was good in a few hours.....

This is tasty stuff. I'll note for the record that I made it as directed the first time, and then I'll tell you the modifications I tried the next time. Since I don't really have a use for leftover cream, I went ahead and used the whole pint instead of just 1.5 cups, then a little extra juice because that was how many lemons I had (about 3/4 cup). The rest I didn't alter, and it still works fine. Next, I made a batch of raspberry sauce (see Rose Beranbaum's Cake Bible) and put generous squirts of it into the finished ice cream container in between spoonfuls of the ice cream. I highly recommend this over any preserve- or jam-based sauce -- those always taste too "cooked." Anyway, this ice cream is indeed very tasty and a very nice change from lemon sorbet. Who says citrus can't play with dairy? Certainly not this recipe.

Wonderful, and to the reviewer below me, an ice cream machine is a necessity. It incorporates air into the cream while it freezes it, making the difference between a solid block of frozen cream and ice cream.

Does anyone know if you can skip the ice cream machine? I don't have one.

There is a typo in the ingredient list with the salt. Try just 1/8 teaspoon. This is a delicious, creamy dessert that is fabulous with the berry topping. Just cut the salt and you'll love it.

I used fat-free heavy cream and skim milk. I thought the ice cream was light, but the egg taste is strong and slightly unpleasant. Also, the salt is a little weird. I think I'd use less eggs and maybe add some vanilla flavor to smooth out the tartness of the ice cream.

I have a tendency to add more lemon than is called for. That was a mistake with this recipe. I only added a little lemon zest, but my ice cream turned out very, VERY tart. So next time I will probably use one tablespoon lemon zest instead of two. Otherwise, the texture of the ice cream was exactly as I like it. I'll definitely use it again and adapt it for other flavors. I served it with a raspberry-blackberry sauce I found on this site.

Sorry to disagree with the other reviewers, but the six egg yolks made this far too heavy. I make a lot of ice cream and this was more like frozen lemon mayonnaise. The pre-freezing texture and flavor of the custard was, however, excellent so perhaps, without freezing, it could sauce a hot dessert. Since I liked the flavor, I might adapt it to my vanilla ice cream recipe, using a more typical two eggs. JK, New York City

what a delicious summer treat! have made it 2 ways - once straining to remove the zest and once left it in - reviews were split - husband liked it smooth and i prefer the zest in - matter of tast - the sauce is great - have used raspberry instead of black currant and just delicious as well -

Great ice cream--a little labor intensive but worth it. I used a huckleberry marmalade I had instead of the black currant and I did not put it in the food processor. I liked the crunch of the little huckleberries left whole--maybe the black currants would produce the same effect.
