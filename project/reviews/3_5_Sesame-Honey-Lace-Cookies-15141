These work out well if the instructions are followed. My first pan crumbled up because I failed to use parchment - I sprayed the cookie sheets with Pam instead. Once I got the hang of it they came out perfectly. They are fussy to make, but are delicious with vanilla ice cream.

Following the others' advice: " Left mixture warm on stove " Cooked 7 minutes at 350 " 1/2 tsp is plenty " Removed cookies when golden brown Greased sheet pans with butter and had no trouble removing them ... provided it was between 2-5 minutes after they were out of the oven. Too fast and they are still sticky and liquid; too long and they harden and stick. Easy to make as long as you can devote the attention to them - not great if you're trying to multitask.

So delicious and easy to make! May need to reheat the mixture while forming each batch - the cooler it gets, the harder it is to pry from the saucepan. I found it easier to keep it at a very, very low heat instead of leaving it to cool to room temperature.

These cookies are great!! Do not use wax paper. Just really grease the cookie sheets heavily with Pam & they will slide off when totally cool. Oh, and 7 - 8 minutes is all they need & they will be perfect little confections.

OMG! These are amazing cookies. There is no need to wait until the batter is cooled - I used a half tsp measure and placed the batter onto the parchment paper 4 inches apart because they do spread out very thin. The result is a thin lacey brittle like cookies that tastes heavenly! Takes some time to make these but the end result is very impressive.

Made these today, not exactly a "cookie", more like a thin, sesame brittle candy. Too sweet for my liking but my better half loves them, would make them again for him, but I didn't care for them.

It took me a couple batches to get it right. I baked mine at 300 degrees for 9 minutes. Take them out of the oven when they are just starting to turn golden. Any longer and they might taste bitter. Next time I am going to experiment with adding some dried coconut into the dough.

Delicious! These tastey treats are not only delicious, but are pretty too. I found that baking them for 7-8 minutes in the oven is just perfect(10 minutes is too long.) These wafer thin cookies are ideal for inserting into a scoop of ice cream when serving a pie ala mode or any other desert. Very impressive.

These remind me of those sesame honey candies found in health food stores, but a very delicate and crisp version. I found baking them 7-8 minutes was plenty. Also, the dough did not form balls, it scraped out of the 1/2 tsp just fine with a butter knife - and no kidding on the 1/2 tsp per cookie.

Excellent! No need to toast sesame seeds first. Important to keep at least 4 inches between cookies, as they really spread! Watch the time, as they can over cook easily.
