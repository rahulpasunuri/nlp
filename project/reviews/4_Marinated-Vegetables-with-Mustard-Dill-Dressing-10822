Super delish and makes a beautiful platter. I made it exactly as directed, preparing all the vegetables the day before, so it was a snap to get ready on the day of the party.

I made this without the beets, which is why only three forks. It's yummy and I like that it can be served at room temperature.

An excellent salad: could have made twice as much and it still would have disappeared as quickly! Prepped all the day before except for the beans: those were done as close to serving time as possible, shocked in real ice water (in a snowbank), and added 10 min before guests arrived just to maximize the green color.

This is great for beet lovers (like my husband), and pretty good for the beet- challenged (like me) too.

The dressing amount needs to be doubled. I used zucchini, carrots, radishes, potatoes, cauliflower,and green beans. bebe beans.

This is a great make ahead salad that is a little different from the usual fare. The dill makes it. I can't wait to do it again with the fresh vegetables out of the garden as mine aren't quite ready yet. A definate keeper.

Fresh and flavorsome, a very pleasing summer recipe. I used herbs de provence instead of dill seed for the marinade, and left the dill out of the dressing. For vegetables, I used asparagus, carrots, squash, and new potatoes, and it was a good mixture.

This recipe was a surprising hit! Even the teenagers like it. Some of my Easter guests had salt and sugar dietary restrictions, so finding something that everyone could eat and would like was tricky. I left the salt out of the marinade, but everyone loved it and had seconds! My dad craves salt but can't have any and the vinegar in the recipe seemed to do the trick for him.

this recipe tasted great. I added cauliflower instead of carrots.

Terrific substitute for a lettuce salad, very colorful and flavorful. I would, however, add salt and pepper to the green beans before serving. I have passed this along to many friends and relatives and will absolutely make this again and again.

Yummy, but many steps to achieve your basic marinated salad and dressing. Nice colour combinations though, make for a pretty platter.

This is a great party dish because it must be made one day ahead except for the final dressing and it makes a beautiful presentation. I first served it for Easter with a fresh ham. Then I served it again for a baby shower luncheon. My one addition was to sprinkle crumbled feta cheese between the vegetables right before serving.
