These are one of the best brownies. It's a bit different from the usual brownie but it's one of the best I've had. Cut them in little cubes and roll them in powdered sugar and pop them in the freezer and have them ready for company or sneak one for yourself once in a while.

These brownies are excellent! I love them! I used Ghiradelli hot choc mix & hershey's choc chips. Luckily I made a double batch & used a 11x14 pyrex baking pan because my husband loved them too! More than once he said that these are the best brownies he ever had. I cut them & wrapped them in plastic wrap & put them in a freezer bag in the freezer. We just heat them in the microwave an enjoy them whenever. I joined epicurious specifically to write this review & to thank Christina for publishing the recipe - thank you!!!

I am surprised the reviews of this recipe aren't more positive. I have made this recipe several times, always to rave reviews. Just last night a "foodie" friend that was over for dinner rated them the best brownies he had ever tasted. I will say, though, that I tried varying the recipe, and they didn't come out well. I recommend following it to the letter. Yummy yummy brownies!

I must say, this is a great recipe. I cook with my small girls on a regular basis, so I try not to use box mixes of any kind,hoping they will grow up knowing how to do something in the kitchen. We use whole wheat flour for everything and this was no exception. I thought it was simple and delicious. I did add a few more choc. chips though. If you just want brownies and don't have a mix, this will certainly do the trick.

These brownies were very easy to make! They had a very gooey texture (which we liked) but did not taste as chocolately or sweet as other brownie recipes. These are great to make if you run out of cocoa.

Very quick & easy! Substituted half the chocolate chips for peanut butter chips and they were so yummy! Will definitely make them again!

Did not make so I can't rate, but wouldn't a box mix be the quickest, just brownie mix and water? Sometimes I even throw in a handful of chocolate chips, when I have time!

This was a tasty and easy to make recipe. The brownie could have been moister but overall I would make it again as everyone enjoyed them.

True, these aren't the most delicious brownies ever, but they are very good and very easy. And true to their name, they are very quick! I have made them multiple times always with good results. A great recipe to have on hand when you need something yummy fast. Be very careful not to overcook.

This recipe was a bit unconventional, but in the end, they were good brownies. I would definately make them again.

This was terrible. They were mushy and soupy. They tasted like cardboard
