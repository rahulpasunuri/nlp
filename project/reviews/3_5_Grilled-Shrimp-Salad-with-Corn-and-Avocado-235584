Absolutely delicious: the entire family loved it. The only changes I made was substituting lime juice for the O.J. and omitting the orange peel, then using wedges of Vidalia onion instead of fiddling around with pearl onions. Just be sure to leave the root end intact and lay them directly on the grill rack. I did use truffle oil, but it's not essential for this recipe.

A great summer salad. I followed other's advice and substituted about 3 T of lime juice for the orange in the dressing and grilled red onion instead of pearl onions. Marinated large shrimp in a bbq rub, minced garlic and olive oil. I poured a bit of the vinegarette over the chopped avocado, then added to salad. Delicious.

I made this for a special lunch. I grilled vidalia onions rather than using pearl onions. I also used smoked paprika that wasn't specifically labelled as "hot" and found the shrimp could have been spicier. I did use the orange dresssing and everyone loved it and would definitely make this again.

A new favorite! Used arugula and canned corn (didn't have corn on the cob). The shrimp is really good with the smoked paprika. Excellent for a light and healthy lunch.

Made this a few times - love it. My friends keep on requesting this dish. The truffle makes a big difference. I prefer to keep the shrimp, corn (cut into smaller pieces), onions and dressing seperate from the rest of the salad and then to assemble as you eat. I always make more of the grilled ingrdients and then if seperate it makes great left over's for the next day.

Made only the dressing and portions of the salad. It was very good. Should make the complete salad next time.

Not enough payoff for the work. Dressing looked great but really didn't have a lot of flavor. Cannot recommend.

We skipped the truffle oil and this was still delicious.

This was a really flavorful and pretty easy recipe. I used lime instead of orange juice and zest in the dressing and added a pinch of sugar to cut the tartness. It went wonderfully with the sweet roasted corn. I also used raw swiss chard as my green (it's what I had) with some lime juice, evoo and salt on it and it really held up in the salad. Even as leftovers the next day.

This is a very tasty, light salad. The orange dressing is good, but I'd be interested to try variations with more herbs and possibly some garlic.

Delicious combination! The only thing, I made the dressing and did not like it. I used a balsamic vinagrette instead. Made it as an appetizer for a dinner party and everyone said it was the best salad they have ever had. The paprika on the shrimp is amazing!

I thought the mix of vegetables and the seasoning on the shrimp was incredible, but I was disappointed in the dressing... a little to orangish for our taste. I decided to use a balsamic vinegrette and it was amazing. Will definitely keep in my recipe box!

Like many we used onion wedge s not pearl onion. Also 'cheated' and used a fish grilling container no skewers and it worked out fine. Because of the orange will pair with chicken too.

This salad is an amazing summer dinner, perfect after a day at the beach. The grill brings out the sweetness of the corn which the citrusy dressing counterbalances. I too grilled yellow onion wedges rather than using the pearl onions, which worked well. I served it without the bread and it was still plenty satisfying. I can't wait to make it again!

I am not a huge grill guy, but this was fun. Used shrimp and salad mix from Trader Joes, bought smoked paprika from Safeway (also got individual loaves of bread from Safeway), used girlfriend's truffle oil, switched to red onions, and used lime instead of orange. Shrimp grilled quickly and perfectly. Yes, a nice glass of white wine would have made it perfect.

This was labor intensive, but well worth it. Found some beautiful organic arugula, which really made the dish, substituted red onion for pearl, and added more seasoning. Took it to a beach picnic and it was fabulous. Leftovers great, too

Loved it. We make the recipe using lime instead of orange. Next time we will have guests over with a crisp pinot gris or tart apple chardonnay. I'm giving it 4 stars because it is fresh, light and the seasoning is perfect for el fresco dining

I thought this was delicious. The combination of flavors was nice, and grilling everything gave it a great smokey flavor. I grilled vidalia onions instead of doing the pearl onion thing and used baby arugula b/c Publix didn't have mache. My husband liked it too, though he inexplicably and incorrectly suggested it might be even better with chicken :) I found the shrimp/corn/avocado combo to be scrumptious. When I make it again I might try lime juice/peel instead of orange in the dressing.

I was just a little disappointed with this salad after all the great reviews...guess I was expecting more from it. Corn and avacados were perfect and I liked the citrus notes in the dressing, but it just didn't quite gel for me. Will try again, as it is easy and light; may have just been me that night!

My husband and I love this salad. The first time I made it I prepared as written, but found that the pearl onions were a royal pain so I used grilled vidalia onions the last time and we both enjoyed the smokey sweet flavor. For a busy couple this makes an easy, delicious meal!

I love this recipe. Beware not to over dress the salad.

This is a very delicious as well as impressive looking dish. We've made it twice and it was great both times. Make sure you use good, sweet corn on the cob. We made the recipe as printed the first time and found that peeling the pearl onions was a waste of time. We used a large red onion the second time and not only was it easier, but the dish tasted better. I would rate this recipe 3.5 stars, but that's not an option. Add a little extra smoked paprika to the finished salad for a little more depth of taste. I'm not sure what a previous reviewer thought was boring about the salad and why he/she thought that it required a lot of work. Skewering two pounds of shrimp takes less than five minutes and cutting the kernels off of three ears of corn takes about one minute. If you don't like spending that much time in the kitchen, there's always Chef Boyardee.

We really enjoyed this salad. I used whole red onions that I just quartered and grilled, in place of the pearl onions. Also, instead of using smoked paprika on shrimp, I used a chili rub for the shrimp that can be found under a recipe entitled "chili smoked prawns with barbeque hollandaise".

Booooooring! Lots of work for a very mediocre salad. Great idea, but lacked pizzazz. Broil the bread, broil the corn, cut the kernals off, skewer the shrimp...Just lots of little things to do and not fabulous. Looked good, though!

I love this salad! You don't have to boil and peel the onions, just buy frozen ones and microwave to defrost.
