Very tasty, quick, and easy. I also just used instant coffee and it turned out just fine. I found it just a little too sweet, so next time will use more whipped cream.

This was OK, only just made 2 serves as another reviewer said. Needed a bit more "kick" maybe a dash of alcohol or something else, but was a nice plain coffee dessert. Very easy to make.

OMFG this was good! And fairly easy. To cool the coffee mixture, I put the pot straight into the sink of cold water with an ice cube tray in it. And I put a little Frangelico (hazelnut liqueur) in with the whipped cream. I'm glad that I put the mousse in the glasses before I tried it, otherwise I probably would have eaten it all right from the bowl!

Well, I didn't make it EXACTLY as dictated... used instant coffee instead of espresso powder and only had 1/2 the whip cream on hand so I made up for it by using 1/2 and 1/2 and thickened with a little vanilla instant pudding mix. I think the overall flavour was there, just lacked the "moussey" texture but no bother... still really good. Served with whole chocolate wafers stuck in the centre for an impressive finish.

I used the amaretto flavored sweetened condensed milk, was all I had. Served this after a summer b-b-q dinner and everyone loved it. Put a bit of shaved chocolate on top and a dash of cinnamon

My guests and I loved the flavor. Note that the recipe makes only 2 small servings! The second time that I made it I added a little extra condensed milk before heating to thin the coffee mixture so that it would fold more easily and consistently into the whipped cream. It is very quick and easy to make (much less than 45 minutes!)
