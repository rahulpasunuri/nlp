THEY FORGOT AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS RECIPE! Here's how you do the "boiling water" part: take a large pot over to the sink and fill it with water --about 3/4 of the way up to the brim. Put it on the stove and turn on the heat. Add about 1 T salt. When the water boils, it's time to add the zucchini. Honestly, how do they expect us to execute these complicated recipes if they leave out steps???

The good thing about this recipe is that it gave my son and I a good laugh! My printer is broken right now and, call me crazy but, I don't think I need to write it down to remember it. My only suggestion, since it is quick and easy, add stuff to it!

If you make this EXACTLY as written, it's pretty boring, but it's a good basic way to cook zucchini before doing something else with it. Sprinkling with parmesean and garlic in addition to the salt helps keep it simple and doesn't add too much fat.
