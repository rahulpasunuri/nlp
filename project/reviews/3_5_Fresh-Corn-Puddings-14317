I had only 2 ears of corn but off the cob it made one full cup so I cut the recipe in half although I did use 2 eggs as they were small. Following recommendations of other cooks, I made a crispy topping using Panko mixed with some grated parmesan cheese and a little butter. Halved recipe resulted in 2 very full ramekins and was delicious. I didn't think the sweet corn needed additional sugar at all and the crispness of the topping was a lovely contrast, I'm glad it was suggested.. This is a recipe I will make again.

my fiance and i made this for thanksgiving and it was just okay. i agree that it's a bit boring. if i made it again i'd add at least cheese, as per some of the other cooks suggestions. i did like that the corn was grated off the cob, the texture was more interesting than whole kernels.

I baked this in a casserole dish for 1-1/2 hrs. and it came out great. I added another couple teaspoons of sugar . It was easy and delicious. I paired it with the Chile and Sage Rubbed Salmon recipe on this site and my own stuffed zucchini recipe w/ roasted red bell peppers and monterrey jack. This is an excellent side dish for Southwestern themed menus.

i thought this was good, if a little boring. some of my guests were not cheese-friendly, otherwise i would have used the previous suggestion and made a breadcrumb/cheese topping, which i think would improve it (mozzarella, maybe provolone or even cheddar for cheese-lovers). b/c it's the end of corn season, i did add just a little more sugar, just under 3 tbs. i baked one pudding in a large dish and it came out just fine (don't remember how long it cooked for...i just kept my eye on it).

Incredibly easy--took only ten minutes to whip up, but I found I needed an extra 10-15 minutes on cooking time. Also, I only needed 3 ears of corn to make 2 cups. Just don't forget to chop the corn after you de-cob it! I did, and it would have been much nicer if it was finer ground. Also, I took the previous advice and increased the sugar to 3 Tablespoons. I thought it was the perfect amount of sweetness.

Extraordinarily easy and a great presentation. I think this would be even better with a touch more sugar (depending on corn sweetness) and a topping of a buttered bread crumb/parmesan cheese mixture.
