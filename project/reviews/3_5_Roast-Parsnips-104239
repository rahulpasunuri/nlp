deelish and oh, so easy. I roasted the parsnips then chopped them to almost a paste in the food processor, added some sauteed mushrooms, garlic and sage, and stuffed zucchini with the mix.

I make roasted parsnips all the time (it's one of the few veggies my husband will eat), and this is a great basic recipe. Try some variations on it: add some crumbled cooked bacon (you can even use the drippings instead of oil, if fat isn't an issue); glaze them with a little maple syrup; or add some fresh grated ginger or some curry powder. I use both curry and maple, which is a surprisingly tasty combination. I like to serve roasted parsnips with pork or lamb.

As another reviewer pointed out, this is healthy because it uses oil rather than animal fat. But, when you feel your arteries can take it, try this with melted duck fat. Awesome!

Everyone I have served this dish to raves about it. A good variation is to roast the parsnips with some brown sugar and butter to carmelize them.

Very good, but just as good,and somewhat shorter:cut parsnips across in c. 1.5" pieces & half or quarter to keep size approx uniform. Do not peel - scrub only*. Saute in minimum butter, over med-high heat, turning occasionally, until browned. (Unnecessary additions: a dollop of honey & a squeeze of lemon) Salt

I make this often and add carrots in with the parsnips!

I have always roasted the Parsnips along with the Sunday roast, basting them with the fat from the meat. This recipe though is more healthy, as olive oil is cholesterol free!
