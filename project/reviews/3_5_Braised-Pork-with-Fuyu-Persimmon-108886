I made this with a whole pork shoulder--browned on all sides and removed it from pan, then carried on with onions, celery, etc.--and substituted 1/2 cup of wine for some of the water. Braised it at 225 degrees for 5 hours. I used the scallions as the garnish in the serving dish. Great flavor, and great use of fall persimmons.

Delicious. I added the persimmons, put the lid back on, put it back in the oven, turned the oven off and left it for 2 hours. When we returned, all the flavors melded so wonderfully with each other. The persimmons added a nice sweet twist. We substituted some wine for the water and used pork country style ribs.

Note: Fuju persimmons are to be eaten and cooked at the firm stage of ripening. If they aren't the flavors will be off.

This dish has great potential! It was really good, but next time I would make a few changes. 1. Use less water in the dish or drain out the water and boil into a gravy-like consistency after cooking. 2. If the persimmons are not super soft, cook for 30 minutes instead of 10. 3. Serve with couscous instead of rice. If persimmons are more the $1/lb in your region, I don't think they are worth including in the dish.

My local supermarkets were both out of persimmons so I substituted mangoes. The dish was delicious -- very flavorful, tender meat and a nice sauce. I served it over saffron-infused basmati to soak up some of the extra sauce, which was a bit runny. Definitely worth the effort.

This recipe is fantastic. I substitute the pork with hot Italian sausage and served it over saffron rice.

I used chicken instead of pork and it was wonderful.

I made this dish once about a year ago for my birthday and loved it... Fuyu Persimmons are a favorite fall/ winter fruit of mine. I've been waiting for the fuyu trees in Claremont to come into season so I could harvest a lot of fruit. I'm planning to make it for a pot-luck next week now that there are ripe fruits available to pick!!

This is our 24 year old son's favorite cold weather dinner. I use apples when persimmons are not available and typically omit the corriander.

I used pork roast since there was no shoulder left, cut it up and followed the recipe minus the persimmons. We prefer this very pricey fruit on it's own. Loved the result; and yes, as others noted it was like a tagine/byriani: the meat very soft and the sauce delicious. A keeper for our family!

Thick, tagine-y sauce. I'd never tried fuyu persimmons before and was very impressed with their taste and texture here. Might add some earlier in the braising process next time.

I used a small boneless pork roast instead of pieces. Nobody ate the tomato-persimmon stew part, so I won't bother with it again. It was pretty bland.

Excellent dish. It doesn't need quite so many persimmons. I found four to be plenty--about a pound. Served it with the accompanying rice pilaf recipe minus the persimmons and made a side of sauteed snow peas with sesame seeds. Lovely winter meal!
