Given some past reviewers' comments about blandness, I added about a tablespoon of sambal and a quarter cup of fresh miso to the marinate. That, plus fresh garlic, made the recipe quite delicious.

I made this for my Mom on Mother's Day and we both loved it. I used minced garlic from a jar instead of powder, and added a tablespoon of wasabi paste to give the marinade some extra kick. The swordfish marinated for about 90 minutes. I didn't bother to baste it while broiling (it cooks so quickly!), and instead reduced the marinade to make a glaze and poured that over the fish after plating. I also cooked wild rice with diced oranges and slivered almonds to serve as a side instead of white rice.

I know there are a lot of fish recipes out there that can be somewhat bland tasting, and some of the reviews of this dish stated the recipe was bland, however I don't get it. This recipe was delicious. My husband hates bland tasting food and is quick to comment when I make something new that has no pizzazz. I did change it up slightly by using Peach Papaya Mango juice called Tropicana Pure. I also used fresh garlic and fresh ginger and added chili oil like others suggested and it turned out great. I'm sure the more you marinate the fish the better it tastes. I marinated it for one hour as the recipe called for. I heated up the sauce afterwards so we could pour some extra on top. We also added a little of the sauce to our rice, just to add some flavor. Would definitely make again, in fact my husband insists we could use the sauce as a dressing on a salad. Yum Yum

It sure looks & sounds good. But the taste is bland. I followed the receipe (using real garlic plus added sesame oil) and marinated for about 1 hour. Would definitely not make this again. Wasted my swordfish.

Excellent combination of flavor in the marinade. I added about a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil and would, in the future, substitute fresh garlic and ginger for a more dominant flavor. This recipe is perfection!

Easy to make and yummy with tuna or salmon as well

Nice, flavourful sauce. The orange is a nice change from the standard lemon sauce for fish. Good weeknight dinner. I also serve with a green vegetable to round out the meal.

I have made this recipe many times and it earns rave reviews every time.

We love this recipe, but use wild salmon instead of swordfish (due to swordfish's high mercury level). The salmon was delicious -- and so easy!

"Scrumptious" my guests said. I followed the recipe as given and will make it again.

This was delicious and easy. I too added about a teaspoon of chili oil to it and reduced the marinade just a little longer than called for in order to really intensify the flavors. I also used fresh minced garlic rather than powdered. It was fantastic.

We thoroughly enjoyed this. I used minced garlic and ginger instead of the suggested powders, and added a touch of chili oil. Very easy to prepare so would be excellent for company. We'll try this with salmon and tuna as well.

This..was a hit! Doubled the marinade and let it sit for about three hours..turning every 30 minutes. Broiled fish entirely. As side dish I cooked rice with orange juice and water. This rice with a bit of the sauce was amazing!

I think this is a great recipe! I've made it for two and for ten and it is always a HIT! But I substitute the swordfish for halibut and I broil it. We love it in Portland!

Need to add ketchup so bring flavor closer to teriyaki. Also browns nicely

If a recipe could earn a ranking of zero this would be the one. Blah is a good description.

I used fresh Marlin instead. It came out nice and flakey, but the sauce was all cooked away while broiling it. The reserved sauce was blah too. Not as good as I was expecting.

OTHER THAN THE FISH COMING OUT MOIST, I TASTED NO REDEEMING QUALITY IN THIS RECIPE. I MADE IT TWICE TO MAKE SURE I HADN'T MESSED UP THE RECIPE BUT BOTH TIMES IT WAS BLAH!

I made it with shark and it was great! The ginger really makes the difference. I would serve it with strong greens like broccoli rabe.

One of the most delicious recipes for fish I have ever made. Wonderful subtle blend of flavours. Great with marlin and fresh tuna too. Very easy and earns the chef a ton of compliments.

The swordfish absorbed this delicious and easy marinade, giving excellent flavor. My only regret was that I had bought such a small piece of swordfish. We tried this on salmon, but it didn't compare to the swordfish. Try this!

I grilled the swordfish steak on the grill outside. It was delicious. The marinade kept it from being fishy or dry. It is a good blend of ingredients in the marinade. It was easy to make and good to eat. Good flavor. Non-fish eaters would like this one.
