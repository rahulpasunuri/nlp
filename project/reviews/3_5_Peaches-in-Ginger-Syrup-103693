I thought this was good and very simple. The syrup was delicious. My peaches were a little less ripe than I'd have preferred; nevertheless, I plan to make again.

Very easy, beautiful dish. I put the peaches in a small bowl as part of a cheese plate and they were excellent. If you like a little more spice than most, double the ginger!

This was a delicious way to enhance our superb Western Slope Colorado peaches! I served them over a light unfrosted buttermilk cake, with whipped cream. Everyone thought it was the essense of summer dessert! My dinner guest suggested that the ginger syrup would be marvelous over ice with sparkling water -- like fancy ginger ale. I'll try that another time.

I had 12 lbs. of fresh picked peaches that were ripening fast- this recipe is so good I just may have to go pick some more! Made this for a party, made syrup day before & let cool in fridge, then poured over peaches & let sit in fridge again for 2 hours or so - everyone loved it!

I peeled the peaches but I guess it wasn't necessary. Wow! Of course it all depends on the quality of your peaches, but mine were nice and ripe and tasted delicious after soaking in the syrup for an hour. I'm always looking for easy ways to enhance the taste of fresh fruit and this certainly fit the bill.

When you find an easy desert that is this good you feel like you have hit the jackpot! I added freshly whipped cream to the top and was in heaven.

This is the second year I have made this recipe with fresh peaches and canned them. I enjoyed them all last winter and am looking forward to doing so again this year. I'm not sure what the quantity of ginger is in the recipe "3/4(2 inch) piece"??? I made the recipe times 6 this year and used about 1/3 cup of grated ginger and that was very good.

Spicey and flavorful. A nice alternative to traditional fruit salad. The syrup did not really reduced much -- even after 40 minutes of simmering. But that is certainly not a problem.

It was good enough the first time to repeat for company. Its simplicity will make it a favorite.
