Delicious. Total comfort food. I added little bits of reconstituted wakame seaweed to the finished soup and then proceeded to eat almost the entire pot of soup.

One of my favorite miso soups my Mom used to make is with potato and onion. Before adding Miso and Tofu, cook 1 cup of cubed boiling or sweet potato, 1/2 cup of sliced yellow onions (1/4 thick), and a little bit of minced pork in dashi for an additional flavor. Then after adding tofu and miso, I add 1 package of Enoki mushrooms at the end with green onions. Chopped garlic chives are also great in stead of green onions. As for miso, I prefer Aka (red) miso or a mixture of both white and red in stead of just white miso as some of the white miso tend to give a very sweet flavor to the soup. It is very comforting and delicious!

I was skeptical about the flavor after reading the reviews prior to making this recipe. However, mine turned our great! It was a little on the salty side and the only thing I added was udon noodles for more heft. This one is now in my recipe box and will be a standby recipe.

Pretty tasteless.

Just ok to me. Too expensive to make for the outcome. Just but it./

There are many ways to make Miso Soup but this one listed is bullet proof, If You Do It Right.. (and assuming you like Miso Soup to begin with..) Just to clarify.. 1) Kombu+water.. turn the heat off right after reaching boiling, then discard the Kombu. 1B) add Katsuo Bushi and let set for said time and then discard that (I just fish it out using a fine-mesh ladel. you don't need a cheesecloth and seperate bowl) 2) turn heat back on. medium-low. NEVER BRING THE SOUP TO A BOIL AFTER THIS STEP. 2B) add miso with mesh ladel to avoid chunks. add tofu 3) add scallions near end before serving. END. People should ignore the comment from Scottsdale AZ. Garlic?? Deglazing?? Assuming it is even edible, It IS NOT Miso Soup by that point. Sorry, I'm passionate about Miso Soup. Keep it Real.

After a hard days work, miso soup is much more satisfying than a lean cuisine and almost as easy to make. If you're not accustomed to Japanese cuisine, don't be intimidated by the unfamilliar ingredients; finding them is worth it.

Very tasty, I saute a little garlic, onion, and ginger for added flavor, deglazed with a bit of Mirin and then added about four ounces of black fungus. Even my mom liked this, who is usually not adventurous with her palate.

I don't understand the excitement about this recipe,it was so bad I threw it out. Waste of time, money and effort.

True comfort food -soothes the tattered soul - the fresher and more organically prepared the tofu the better I think. My Asian grocery tells me that they have never heard of white miso - they sold me light miso -delicious. I have made this soup several times since I first tried it last week.

Great recipe; Next time I will start with vegtable stock as a variation. I added soy sauce for more taste and will also add spinish and crab meat to spruce it up a bit.

Delicious. Definitely a keeper.

This is curiously similar to my recipe that just pours kettle water over the bonito in a wire colander. You can leave the colander in the pot like a teaball. Does starting with cold water make a difference? I'll give it a try. ---- as for *Vancouver Cook*. Check the name of the loser that you were referring to...

I made this for my husband. We both liked it. It was yummy. I would recommend it to you. Why are these reviews written on a third grade reading level? What a joke...

I haven't made this, but have made the Rice with Soy-Glazed Bonito Flakes, as someone mentioned previously. This is a use for the used bonito. It is very tasty and savory.

For a quick vegetarian version, I usually start an "instant" stock with re-hydrated shitake mushrooms and some finely sliced onions.

There's also granulated bonito broth (hon-dashi) that works really well. It keeps forever, is very concentrated, and isn't too salty. For vegetarian miso, you might try making an onion or vegetable broth. I honestly can't think of anything else.

Miso is an aged, fermented product. I have had tubs of miso in my refrigerator for over a year and the product has remained in good condition!

Great recipe, nice body. If you didn't like it quite so fishy or wanted to substitute the bonito flakes for something vegetarian, what would you use?

Don't add the Kombu or the Bonito back to the soup. For a possible use for the Bonito take a look at RICE WITH SOY-GLAZED BONITO FLAKES AND SESAME SEEDS.

Miso paste lasts a long time in general. If it's a couple months old, I wouldn't worry about it. (Remember, it's really just fermented soybeans!) If it's in individual packets, it lasts even longer.

Does anyone know how long miso paste stays good in the refrigerator after opening? I'd like to make this tonight, but I suspect the miso paste in our fridge has been there for a while...

The recipe says that the kombu can be reserved for another use. Can it be re-used to make more dashi? How is it stored? Thank you.

This is a great, simple, classic recipe. By the way, "Dashi" is the Japanese broth of Bonito Flakes and Kombu (tasty kelp, really, and I don't care for strong fishy flavours). Think of Dashi as the Japanese equiv of chicken stock, and Miso Soup is made from the Dashi base.
