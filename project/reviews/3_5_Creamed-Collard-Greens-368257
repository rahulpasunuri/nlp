I made this for Thanksgiving and clearly I did something wrong...the cream came out very chalky and I had to keep adding salt to make the overwhelming bacon flavor make sense. I was really disappointed and the calories are no where close to worth consuming this dish. That being said, there were others at the table who claimed to enjoy it but did not go back for seconds.

Everyone loved these. Went really well with the rest of the Cajun Thanksgiving dinner.

This was the star of Thanksgiving dinner, especially for my southern guests. Made it as written, except stirred the bacon in, and kept it in the oven til serving time. Not an everyday dish, but yummy!

It generally drives me crazy when people substitute so much that it no longer is the recipe, however, i wanted to let you know that the bones of this recipe still work great without the bacon (had none), and with half & half. i added nutmeg instead of paprika, 'cause that's what i like with greens, and i used lacinato (it's what i had). Delicious.

Really good! My husband (formerly from the South) said they were the best collards he has had anywhere.

I made this recipe as written (bacon, cream, and all), and it was delicious. My new favorite collard green recipe!

This dish is part of a Cajun Thanksgiving menu. I made 4 of the 10 dishes in the cholesterol-heavy menu (featuring 1.5 pounds of bacon and more than a quart of cream). In an effort to reduce fat and calories, in this dish I replaced the cream and whole milk with 2% and omitted the bacon topping. We liked the dish--I think cream would have been too heavy in any case, and I certainly did not miss the bacon topping. (But I did use bacon drippings for the initial saute.)
