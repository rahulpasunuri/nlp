This recipe marks the first time I've ever made brittle, and I thought it was very easy! I used the broken up pieces in a spinach leaf salad with strawberry slices and a red-wine vinagrette. Tasted wonderful! My only suggestion would be to salt and toast the pine nuts first for a more complex, and slightly less sweet, flavor. I will do that next time.
