Very disappointing. Very little flavor. Would not make this again.

I thought the dressing was way too sweet, even after adding extra cooking broth. However the concept is good, and I enjoyed poaching the chicken!

This is an excellent, easy to prepare salad. The dressing is so flavorful and the chicken tender. I hated to throw away the remainder of the great tasting poaching liquid. I used radish sprouts on top of each serving. This is a keeper and I plan on making it for dinner guests soon. Low fat to boot!!

This is a great, light, summer salad. The dressing is nice and spicy.
