This is good, but I don't recommend the serving suggestion in the recipe. This is a really hard/dry variety of gelatin dessert, and I think it's ideal for a tartlet, but not on its own. Rather than serving it with a lemon slice, I did this (which my guests loved): Dollop of lemon whipped cream (1 c heavy cream, 1 Tbsp superfine sugar, 1/2 tsp lemon extract) topped with a few blackberries, curly lemon zest, and mint sprig. It was too much volume of custard to serve, in my opinion. What would've made it better is if it were a smaller serving size and accompanied by something crunchy (like a Nilla Wafer or as a filling in a not-too-sweet cookie crust in a tartlet size).

Delicious and great luncheon dessert. Second time I made it, used 1% milk and added fresh blueberries on top with dollop of whipped cream. Not as light but surely was good.

Not bad. Would have liked it a little more creamy. Also, I realized (too late) that I should have used better quality wine--cheap cooking wine leaves a BAD aftertaste!

very easy to prepare. for those who don't want to use wine, white grape soda is a good substitute.
