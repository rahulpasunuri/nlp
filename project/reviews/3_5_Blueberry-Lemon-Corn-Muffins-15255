I made similar to how Katewawa did (less butter and subbed some whole wheat pastry flour for some of the AP flour). I also cut the sugar. After they baked, I spooned some lemon sugar syrup I had leftover from another recipe. This added some good moisture. If I make this again, I'll do it similarly, but will probably add more than the 1T of lemon zest that's called for. In response to someone else's question, if you add lemon juice to the batter, I'd expect it to curdle.

I hosted a breakfast for 15 business associates & these muffins were a huge hit. I added lemon zest and fresh lemon juice to the batter and the citrusy flavor was scrumptious. Loved the cornmeal crunch. Will definitely be making again. Soon!!

Made these for a spring brunch and they were gorgeous!!! The blueberries studded on top were a nice touch. I went ahead and used double the amount of blueberries and the zest of one whole lemon. The lemon was a great complement and will probably add some lemon juice, too. Love the corn meal... the texture was great and really moist!

Love this! I also changed some of the ingredients to make it a little healthier - 1/4 cup of oil for the butter and I used raw cane sugar instead of white sugar. It also works really well to swap blueberries for raspberries and use orange zest instead of lemon.

Rating: 3
This is a wonderful muffin recipe. I followed it to the letter, although I would agree with others that you really do need to bake it closer to 25 minutes than 15.

I made as Katewawa suggests, and substituted 1/2 the butter with coconut oil. They were GREAT! Will definitely make regularly

I have made this recipe for years, tweaking it along the way to try to make it a little less greasy and a little more healthy. I have finally hit upon what I think is the end of these tweaks: subbed 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour and 1/4 unbleached AP for the flour called for here, reduced the butter to 2T, used only 1/4 c plus 2T granulated sugar, used 2% milk in place of the whole, and used one whole egg instead of the two egg yolks. This works, tastes great, and makes for a much healthier muffin. The texture is great, not too dense or crumbly or dry - the muffin holds together well. It also lets the lemon flavor shine through!

Rating: 3
Love this recipe because it is so easy and yummy. I didn't have any lemon juice or zest in the house so I used orange zest and some juice and it was great. Also I substituted gluten-free flour and xantham gum for regular flour and the muffins still had a nice texture. My 1 1/2 year old ate several and she's very picky :)

These are my absolute go-to muffins when I have guests coming, when I need to take something somewhere, or when my husband has been particularly kind. They are so fast, so tasty, and do well over a couple of days. I use a bit more lemon zest and a little less corn meal to lighten them up. They are awesome.

These muffins were great! I used brown sugar per another reviewers suggestion and doubled the blueberries. My cooking time was also more like 25 minutes.The family loved them, time to make more!

Rating: 3
A nice variation on the standard blueberry muffins. I added the zest of a whole lemon as well as the juice and they came out nice and lemony. It seemed like they could have used a little salt to me, but that could just be my affinity for salt.

It's difficult to find a good blueberry muffin recipe. When you do, it's worthwhile to stick with it, which is what I should have done. Martha Stewart's recipe for Blueberry Corn Muffins is far better than this one. I could have just added lemon zest...lesson learned.

Rating: 3
I doubled this recipe and got 12 really good sized muffins. I actually had a little bit of batter left over that I couldn't squeeze into anymore cups or it would've spilled over. Like a lot of reviewers, I cut the amount of butter used. I used 1/2 the amount of butter and substituted the rest of the butter with applesauce. I did wish there was more lemon flavor and would probably use some lemon juice in addition to the zest next time. Another recommendation would be to really press the last half of the blueberries into the batter before baking. Some of my berries weren't pressed into the batter enough and fell off the top when I took them out of the pan. These were a big hit at a brunch I went to today, so I'd definitely make them again.

Rating: 3
Very good and would definitely make them again. I used brown sugar and it gave them a nice extra flavor. My cooking time was closer to 20-mins.

I absolutely love these muffins following the recipe exactly! If you love the texture of cornbread, love lemon flavour and blueberries, the combination is just wonderful!

Rating: 4
Blueberries are just coming into season and I had some waiting for me that I hadn't got to yet, so they were a little soft. When it came time to add them to batter I ending up mashing them and adding a bit more than required, with only a few for decor on the top. This created more of a 'bluEberry infusion' that was wonderful! That combined with lowfat milk (in house), zest of 2 lemons (with a bit of juice dripping in) and masa instead of cornmeal (corn flour) created a fantastic muffin! P.S. My egg yolks were from the farm down the road and that helped too!

Rating: 2
The taste is okay. Good way to use blueberries that are getting old. And the recipe is really very simple and doesn't get a lot of dishes dirty. I doubled the recipe and used an 8oz container of nonfat yogurt instead of butter. I squeezed lemon juice into the batter but cannot really taste it. I think more lemon zest would be great.

Rating: 0
I thought these came out really well. Per several other cooks' suggestions, I used whole eggs, reduced the sugar by several tablespoons, and added extra zest and lemon juice. I also used a scant half cup extra berries, half of which I tossed with a tablespoon or so of flour before folding in (the rest were added on top, which made the muffins pretty). The lemon was subtle, but went really well with the crunchy cornmeal and juicy blueberries. Would definitely make again and would consider glazing with confectioners' sugar and lemon juice.

Rating: 2
These were decent. Make sure you use fine grain cornmeal. The lemon flavor was subtle not strong.

Rating: 3
Based on other reviewers' complaints about lack of lemon flavor, I added the juice of one lemon along with the lemon zest. I also used frozen blueberries (yay for Trader Joe's!) and skim milk (that's all we had). I would recommend using a fine grind of cornmeal, since mine was a course grind and is a bit crunchy. Overall, very tasty muffin for a quick breakfast/snack.

Rating: 2
These were OK. A bit sweet for my taste, even though I reduced the sugar a bit. I couldn't taste the lemon zest at all, although perhaps it helped the flavor without me really recognizing it. One doesn't need the muffin cups if you have an appropriately greased pan (I used a silicone muffin pan with no grease). I used frozen blueberries without a problem.

Rating: 4
This was a great muffin recipe. The lemony flavor and crunchy cornmeal texture is fabulous. As other reviewers mentioned, this recipe could do with a LOT less butter. I was doubling the recipe and I only used 5 tablespoons of butter and it was still too oily. 4 tablespoons or even 3 might be better. Also I used 2 eggs instead of four yolks and it seemed like a fine substitution.

These were too sweet and rich for me.

Delicious & quick. Used orange zest, as I didn't have any lemons in the fridge. Frozen berries too. It was way too cold to go the store, so I was baking from a bare cupboard! Read: don't be shy to improvise and have confidence in stellar results. Everyone enjoyed -- from age 1 to 87! They were gone in a flash. So tasty you may want to double.

This muffin recipe is terrific. I made a few minor changes - which is why I didn't rate the recipe. It's not really the same is it? I used fat free milk - since that's what I had in my frig. I used one egg rather than two yolks. These two changes lowered the fat content a fair amount. I put all the blueberries in the batter - rather than 1/2 on top. Added 1/2-cup of raspberries and the juice of half a lemon along with the lemon zest. A really clean, fresh-tasting muffin. And the crunch of cornmeal is great, too.

Rating: 4
I used frozen bluberries as the fresh ones are currently out of season and they came out great! Only suggestion is do not fill up the cups all the way with batter unless you want the muffin tops stuck together. Mine were slightly less than full and I filled 7 cups, and they still baked far over their alloted space.

These were just delicious. I followed others' advice and used buttermilk and half whole wheat flour. Very moist and tasty.

I thought these were very good, but next time I will decrease the sugar and add more blueberries. Also, I used a medium grind corn meal and a finer ground would clearly be better. I made them as mini-muffins, which is a size I prefer.

Check out this recipe. I used 1/2 the amount of butter and used lowfat yogurt in place of the rest of the butter. I used lowfat buttermilk in place of the milk and used spelt flour in place of regular flour. I used a little lemon zest and 1 T lemon extract. They were delicious!

I "one-and-a-halved" this recipe and it made six large muffins. I used two whole eggs, buttermilk for milk, and polenta-grade corn meal. They took over 30 minutes to cook, though that could be due to my craptastic oven. Overall, I liked these muffins, especially the crunchiness of the cornmeal. However, next time I will add more lemon and less sugar as I prefer a tarter muffin. I think these would be great with raspberries, too.

- Delicious and tasty breakfest corn muffins - My freinds who usually dislike corn muffins like them ! - the bluberries gave a twist to its taste.. not very sweet, which i likes - I did by the suggestion of other reviewers, I used 1/4 of stick of butter + 3tbs of plain fat free yoghurt - next time I will use a softer corn meal as another reviewer sugested

If you like cornbread, then this is the muffin for you. I cut the butter in half and added 1/4 cup plain yogurt and twice the amount of blueberries. The muffins came out perfect and not greasy. I didn't have a lemon so left it out -- I think it would be a better muffin with the lemon, though.

Rating: 3
Very tasty though a bit oily. Will make again but reduce the butter. Not a cake-y muffin - larger crumbs. I used big, fresh blueberries. Enjoyed the slight crunch of the corn and the smooth blueberries. Do press extra blueberries into tops. I sprinkled with raw sugar adding a nice sparkle.

Rating: 4
I make these muffins on a regular basis and they have become a staple in our house. I've made them at least a dozen times, so some things I've learned: - don't use coarse-ground cornmeal, they come out gritty and almost inedible - I always use more cornmeal than flour, reversing the ratio (I use 3/4 cup cornmeal and 1/2 cup flour) - with or without the lemon zest they are very good, it's fine to leave it out - I've varied the amount of butter I use and often go with just a quarter stick and add some plain yogurt or vegetable oil in place of the extra butter

It is a perfect mixt with sweet blueberres, zesty lemon and crispy corn. However, it is a little too sweet for muffins, I prefer to cut 30% of the sugar.

Rating: 1
First off, I must admit that I don't bake a lot. There, that being said...we didn't care for these muffins. The cornmeal texture is strange & gritty, the blueberries sunk to the bottom, and to say that they were not sweet is an understatement!!! I don't mind baking when the reward is a nice product, but these were a waste of time.

Rating: 3
These are great muffins. Kids love them and they're not too sweet. I started to make them before I realized I didn't have any cornmeal! I substituted whole wheat flour and then only had one egg for a double recipe. I increased the blueberries to a scant two cups for a double recipe and baked for about 1/2 hour. Wonderful!

Rating: 3
These were very good. I think the people who didn't like them probably just don't like cornbread in general. Yes, they're a bit 'sandy'-textured, but then, that's what one should expect of good cornbread. You could change the flour to cornmeal ratio if you're not a big cornmeal fan-- it'll increase the rise and reduce the granular texture, if that's what you want. I didn't use liners, and so the tops spread a bit across the top of the pan (s'okay). Loved the lemon, loved the texture, loved (of course!) the blueberries.

This is now my favorite muffin recipe. The cornmeal gives the muffins a wonderful texture and structure that you just can't create with wheat flour. Coating the berries with flour is a must, otherwise they sink to the bottom.

I too was fooled by some of the reviews. Trust me; this is not a good recipe. I am a gourmet cook and was upset that I not only doubled the recipe, as many reviewers suggested, but that I wasted precious organic ingredients doing so! Don't waste your time on this one.

I made these twice. The first time I followed the recipe to a tee (except for a little less lemon rind) and they were delicious. The second time, I attempted to lighten them up-- used less butter, buttermilk instead of milk, and they were still very good, but less decadent than the first batch.

Yummy, yummy, yummy. I made a few miner changes. 1 tsp. of lemon oil instead of lemon rind. This was very lemony tasting. 2 whole large eggs instead of just the egg yolk. (Next time I will use egg beaters). 1 tsp. of oil. Yummy results

Made one batch, thought they were so good, made a second before they cooled. Took other reviewer's suggestions: dusted blueberries with flour first, increased berries to 3/4 c., decreased butter to 3 T, dusted tops with large crystal sugar. I also put in a teaspoon of lemon juice in addition to the 1 tablespoon zest. Made 8 moderate sized muffins. Still very fresh after storing overnight. Will definitely make again.

excellent recipe, but took 25 min to bake, not 15. that may be caused by the fact that i used free standing muffin cups and fresh large blueberries. overall, wonderful.

I have to disagree with the last two reviewers. I thought these muffins were the best I've ever made and I've made a lot of muffins. If you want a cakelike muffin these are not what you are looking for, but if you want a delicious, slightly crunchy muffin with loads of flavor then you must try these. I made them with medium grain corn meal and they had just the right amount of crunch for me. I will most definitely make these again. They were easy to make (I, too, did not use paper muffin cups. I just sprayed the tin with a vegetable spray) and they came out beautifully in a short time. Perfect for a fast, easy breakfast!

The idea sounded great, the reviews were promising. But I followed this recipe to the dot and got muffins with a crunchy texture (i.e., the corn meal was not absorbed). My boyfriend said it was like eating good blueberry muffins with sand in them, without the taste of sand. Yuck!

Rating: 1
This recipe sounded good, and I got sucked in by all the other reviewers who loved it. The flavor is fine, but I'm not big on the cornmeal in there: it adds texture, yes, but I'm not sure that was what I was going for in a blueberry muffin. Maybe I'm a purist. I agree that you must fill the cups full; they don't puff that much. My husband liked them, but... he likes most baked goods. ;) I thought they were okay, but wouldn't make them again.

Rating: 4
I thought this was one of the best blueberry muffin recipes I have tried. The cornmeal is a great addition and I wouldn't go back to a traditional recipe. I didn't have quite enough lemon zest so I added a bit of almond extract, 1/4tsp. It wasn't enough to be able to identify the almond but it did enrich the flavor. I would use it again. I also used raw sugar sprinkled on the top, I think it looks nicer and I like the larger crunchy crystals.

Really quick and easy muffins. The lemon and cornmeal add interest to the everyday blueberry muffin. I too skipped the paper and sprayed the tin with canola oil. Definitely a keeper.

These were fabulous muffins. I did not decrease sugar or flour but did increase blueberries (frozen) to 3/4 cup (per prior feedback). They were light and airy and the lemon zest gave it a perfect zing. I did coat the blueberries and they did not fall to the bottom. (Good feedback from reviewer!)

Rating: 4
I have made these fabulous muffins around five or six times and each time I seem to get better at making them, mainly due to other people's tips - thank you! I coated my blueberries with flour and they did not sink - it makes the muffins look even better and you are guaranteed a blueberry with every mouthfull! I doubled the mixture (except for the sugar which I kept at 1/2 cup - my Grandmother is diabetic) and there was no loss of sweetness!

Rating: 3
Good recipe - I cut the sugar a bit because of recommendations, though I really don't think it was necessary...the muffins would have been good either way. I used more like 3/4 cup of blueberries, because I never think blueberry muffins can really have too many bluberries. :) I did not use papers - just gave a light spritz of canola to the muffin tin before pouring the batter in - they came out very easily. I do wish I had floured the blueberries before putting them in to keep them from sinking as much, but otherwise these came out really well. A light, lemony muffin; they're good for a snack or breakfast. I'd make them again.

Per the suggestion of others, I lowered the amount of sugar and butter, floured my frozen berries, baked without muffin cups and added a bit of lemon juice. Very yummy! I doubled the recipe and am glad that I did.

I too reduced the butter by 1/3 and in addition to using the lemon zest, I also added one T of lemon juice to the mix. I also did not add sugar to the top of the muffins because I thought it would be too sweet. As it is, I think you would be fine to reduce it by 1/3 of the required amount. I doubled the recipe, which is perfect for a family of four!

This has become our all-time favorite blueberry muffin. The cornmeal gives it a great texture! I followed other reviewers advice and decreased the butter to 3 tablespoons; they weren't greasy at all. I also used less lemon zest (used 1 teaspoon zest + 1 tablespoon lemon juice) and upped the blueberries to 3/4 cup. I also substituted skim milk for the whole and divided the batter among 8 muffin cups rather than 6. Great recipe -- can't wait for autumn to try them with cranberries and orange!

My family enjoyed these muffins. The cornmeal gives them an interesting texture and a rich flavor. I took reviewers' advice and slightly reduced the amount of sugar called for. After making the first batch I decided to add just a pinch of salt. I also found that they took longer than 15 minutes to cook. I look forward to making these again soon.

Good recipe, with the exception that it's a little sweet for my taste, so I'll cut down on the sugar next time. Love that lemony taste (just used zest of 1 lemon). For a healthier alternative, I replaced the butter with 3 T olive oil, and used wholemeal flour over all-purpose flour. Because I used the whole eggs, I cut down on the rice milk (my son has dairy allergies) to 1/4 cup. Greased the muffin tin with olive oil, and only filled to 3/4 full. No mess at all as others have commented. The lemon zest really gives it a nice twist. Delicious!

This was an easy "just for the heck of it" Sunday morning recipe. The only thing that did not work out as per the instructions was the baking time.

This is a great recipe! I doubled it, which made only four muffins, but that is in my 8 oz muffin tins. I added more blueberries, too. I think you could reduce the butter a tablespoon or so, because my muffin tops spread more than I like them to. Also, sprinkling some cinnamon&sugar on top prior to baking gave it a nice taste. The texture was very very moist and tasty. Easy to make!

Rating: 3
Tasty! I doubled this recipe and made some substitutions. I was out of milk, so I used 1/4 cup buttermilk powder, and used egg whites and water to make up the volume of liquid. I also added a quarter cup of part-skim ricotta cheese. The doubled recipe yielded 15 muffins, with the cups filled 3/4 full. They rose above the top of the cups but didn't overflow and browned nicely. They have a nice texture and aren't too sweet. FYI, I used frozen blueberries and the baking time was not affected. Next time I think I'll try adding lemon juice as others have recommended, and I'll try cutting the butter since I did experience the unpleasantly greasy paper cups.

Rating: 3
These came out great and they are very easy. I omitted the lemon zest since I didn't have any. Also, I never use paper liners for muffins; cupcakes-yes, muffins-no. They came out fine, you just need to be a little careful and grease the tins before you put the batter in. For the sugar sprinkled on top, use the hole tablespoon or more, imho.

My first attempt was not superb but I blame myself. I followed Leisa's lead and substituted something for the milk: I used 3/4 nonfat cottage cheese blended in the blender with 1/4 c milk (I doubled the recipe because I wanted to take them to a potluck). And because I read that they wouldn't rise much and I needed to fill the tins full, I did. Big mistake! Even 25 minutes wasn't quite enough. I thought they were done but actually they needed more time in the oven. Next time I will try the recipe as printed. Go strictly by the book. These overflowed the tops of the pan. Didn't get quite done. But they taste superb! So as soon as I can dispose of this batch, I'm ready to try it again. We have fresh blackberries now on bushes in our area, so I may try making one batch with blackberries instead. And I will not fill the tins so much, but rather about 2/3.

Rating: 3
Good, but nothing special. I had to increase the baking time, but everything else was fine. I didn't find the texture too crumbly at all; the muffins held together well. They fit perfectly in the tins, rising an inch above but without overflowing at all. The papers were not greasy. The sugar on top was perfect. What I do want, however, is a lot more flavor. Increase the both the blueberries and the lemon flavor (maybe lemon extract?).

Rating: 4
Have made these many times. The recipe as printed makes 6 muffins. I increase the flour to 1 cup and decrease the corn meal to 1/4 cup. Also, in addition to the zest of 1 lemon I also add the juice of the lemon. Very good - mine have never been greasy.

Fantastic. After readig the reviews and in an effort to use some perishing ingredients on hand I doubled the recipe with these substitutions: Omitted the whole milk completely. Used 3/4 cup of whole milk ricotta cheese and 1/4 cup of buttermilk to replace the 1 cup of whole milk and 1/2 stick of butter for the doubling). I substituted 1/2 cup (in base) of yellow cornmeal completely and used 1/2 cup (in the doubling) of white cornmeal and 1/2 cup of instant polenta. I also added 1 teaspoon of baking soda (in addition to the doubled baking powder) These were the VERY best muffins I have ever made. The batter was very thick. Doesn't rise much, so fill tin full. The muffin was not greasy, but moist, dense and delicious. It made 18. Delicious cold as leftovers from refrigerator.

Rating: 2
These are a mess! The directions tell you to fill the cups, but they don't tell you that the batter will then overflow the cups and get all over your oven! These muffins taste good, but they fall apart and don't look very nice. I won't make these again.

I made these for Mother's Day and they were VERY popular. I was a little turned off by the greasy papers. Next time I think I will cut the butter by a few tablespoons, but I will definitely make these again, it would make my husband so sad if I didn't!

I made these for mother's day and thought they were good, but a little bit greasy. I used an egg rather than just yolks and 2% milk rather than whole, but I still had some grease on the muffin cup. also, i skipped the sugar on top - i didn't think it was really needed.

I made these for my family and we all loved them. Made them as is, except I used white corn meal (That was all I had in the pantry) and I doubled the recipe - why bother unless you make a dozen? I thought they were the best blueberry muffins I've ever made. Remember the "muffin tops" from Seinfeld? With the sugar on top they got really good and kind of crunchy - Yum, Yum! I could have just eaten those tops and would have been happy. Will definitely make these again

These muffins definetly have potential. They are a little too much like cornbread and not enough like a muffin. I am going to try less corn meal and more flour. When I made them I stirred in all the blueberries, and I used lemon juice instead of zest, which was fine. Overall good.

Doubled recipe, made 12 muffins, used paper cups. Added about a tablespoon of lemon juice. Used frozen blueberries, just put them in all at once. Wow!

I tripled the recipe to take to work (it yielded 22), and the muffins were a huge hit.

I would stick with these changes in the future.

I gave it a four, although I modified the recipe so much that I guess I don't know what it would have been. My results were amazing, though! I had no cornmeal, so I just used all white flour. I have only skim milk, that didn't seem to cause a problem. And I thought I had a lemon to zest, but I was wrong. Instead I added about 2T of lemon juice, which gave a nice flavor and I think also made the muffins a bit lighter than others have reported. If you're looking for a fluffier version of this recipe, I would recommend the lemon juice. Oh, and I put in extra blueberries just for personal taste. I ate one fresh out of the oven and loved it. I'm going back for another as soon as they cool!

good and simple to make. I added a bit of lemon extract to zip up lemon flavor as I was in a hurry and running out of lemon peel. Do not omit the sugar on the top - the sweetness was pleasant to an otherwise unsweet muffin.

These are moist, delicious muffins. I added at least double the amount of zest (it's impossible to have too much, as far as I'm concerned). Perfect for a brunch, or to pop in the freezer and eat throughout the week. They donj't need butter, they are fruity and delicious on their own. I did not use muffin liners, I just used a non-stick muffin pan and they came out fine. You can also use strawberrys instead of the blueberries (or any other berry, for that matter).

I must have done something wrong. These muffins were way too crumbly. Maybe I filled the muffin tin too full or cooked them too long. One way or another, they didn't turn out to meet the expectations I had. I will not waste my time or calories on them again.

These are delicious -- moist, lemony, small and sweet. A perfect tea muffin. These are NOT for folks wanting a big fluffy muffin found in some bakeries and cafes. I filled the muffin papers to almost 3/4 and they barely rose above the paper.

I added coconut & white chocolate chips, then baked it in a buttered 8 inch square pan for 30 minutes. Really good!!! and very easy.

Absolutely delicious! I made this for brunch for a group of friends and it was a hit!

These muffins were great! What I enjoyed about them was the addition of the cornmeal and lemon. The cornmeal added substance that regular dessert muffins are lacking, and the lemon lent that zing to accentuate the muffin and blueberries. Great for breakfast, brunch, or snack. I mixed all of the berries into the batter and doubled the recipe. The yield was 16 muffins. I baked them directly in tins that I sprayed with a non-stick product with good results. I also skipped the sugar topping and didn't miss it at all. Ready with french butter and anxious to sample a hot one right away, I took a bite and sighed. Will make another batch and see how well they freeze. I highly recommend these!

Wonderfully different cross between corn muffins and sweet breakfast muffins. Doubled the recipe and would definitely make this again.

Delicious!! Will definately make again. After reading all the comments I decided to increase it 4 times-- no problems. Got 27 muffins in all. Already gave some away to family. My next step is to see how well they freeze for a quick morning bite. Used sanding sugar for tops instead, it made for a crunchy sweet top. My youngest child helped me make these yesterday morning and just loves them!!

Light, good-flavored muffin. I wouldn't decrease the sugar at all. Corn meal adds interesting texture. I would add all the blueberries at once if using frozen (I followed the directions and using frozen blueberries, they just sank down into the muffin anyway). Also, may need to adjust cooking time (longer). I would make it again. I don't think I added enough lemon zest (scant 1T.) and I couldn't taste it in the muffin. I would make this muffin again.

I have been on the search for 6 months for the perfect blueberry muffin - THIS IS IT! I made some modifications (1-1/4 c. blueberries, 2 teaspoons lemon zest) and had to bake them almost 25 minutes. These modifications produced 7 perfect muffins - next time I will double it because my husband and I ate 5 of them within 30 minutes of coming out of the oven. I read one cook's suggestion of NOT using the lemon zest and feel this would be a real mistake. Possibly their lemon zest had the pith (white part) attached which would impart a sour flavor - make absolutely sure no pitch is attached to the zest and you will LOVE the taste. I'm happy I didn't use a full tablespoon because it would have overwhelmed the blueberry taste. Enjoy!

I made most changes suggested by others & this was melt-in-your-mouth great. But next time I'll use just 1/2 to 1 TEASPOON fresh grated lemon peel; I used less than the 1 tablespoon the recipe called for & the lemon flavor really overwhelmed the blueberry and muffin flavors. Also next time I'd like to try less butter as the amount indicated seems like an unhealthy dose (any advice about this?).

These were delicious. I used frozen blueberries (thawed and patted dry) - not as good as fresh, but worked well. Moist, tender and all of the flavors - blueberry, lemon, and corn come through. A scant teaspoon of sugar on top give them a slightly crunchy crown. In doubling the recipe, I used two yolks and one whole egg. A real keeper.

We just love it! My boy friend just rave aobut that and asked for more. I replace blueberry with raspberry and get exactly six muffins. It is crunchy and absolutely delicious. Thanks again to share this recipes with us!

Like everybody said before, the recipe was excellent ! I followed Jaz's modifications and got a lovely light muffin, indeed one of the best I have ever made. Is this because of the cornmeal? I'll certainly make this again.

Also made 8 great muffins with a scant cup of blueberries, 2/3 added to the mix and 1/3 reserved for the tops of the muffins. I would skip the lemon zest next time, because they impart a sour, rather than lemony, taste to the muffins.

I followed the advice of several others and made 8 perfect muffins using 1 cup of blueberries and baking 20 min. I loved them but two of my family didn't( they like burnt food). Next time I'll make it and hoard them for myself!

WOW!!! Terrifically YUMMY!!! I agree with the previous reveiwers about the extra baking time, and the 8 muffins instead of 6. Although the tops were golden after 15 minutes, the tester didn't come out clean until about 20 - 22 minutes. Also, even though they didn't rise much, they overflowed a bit, and that was when I divided the batter into 8 cups! I think, though, that was because I added so much more fruit (see MODIFICATIONS) below. In general, I have been disappointed in most fruit-corn muffin recipes, because they end up gritty. This recipe is a delightful exception! I think it is because the ratio of white flour to cornmeal is 3:2 in favor of the white flour. MODIFICATIONS: (1)I happen to like my muffins sweeter than most, so I added 3/4 C sugar instead of the 1/2 C listed. Nice and sweet but not too much (for me) (2)I also love my muffins chock-full of fruit, so I used about 1 C (maybe 1 1/4 C) of frozen blueberries. If you DO add lots of fruit, then you should definitely let the muffins cool IN the pan before removing. Otherwise they will simply fall apart, and you'll end up spooning them out of the pan (and into your mouth, if you're anything like me). (3) I topped half of them with sugar, per the recipe, and I topped the other half with cinnamon-sugar. Both ways are delicious!!! (4) I only had one lemon to zest, so I ended up with less than 1 T of lemon zest (I think). But, the taste was perfect - not overly lemony, but a generous hint of lemon that was perfect with everything else.

Excellent receipe. Easy and quick. I increased the quantity of the blueberries to 3/4 cups and it was fine. The baking time was 20 minutes in my oven and the muffins were moist, golden and delicious. I also made 8 muffins instead of 6 and it was better.

Makes a beautiful muffin. I used regular sized muffin cups and got 8 beautifully risen muffins. I forgot to sprinkle top with sugar, so I quickly iced tops with an icing made of powdered sugar and enough lime juice to moisten. Excellent.
