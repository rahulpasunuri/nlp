Wow. Big time YUM. I followed both recipes for the most part, only changes were using vegetable stock instead of chicken and followed reviewers' advice to use beer in the cheese soup (I replaced 1/2 of the stock with Guinness), and used a little less of the cream and milk than called for in the cheese soup. Black bean soup was good, but next time I will try the Spicy Bean Soup recommended in the reviews. Added lime zest and juice to the sour cream and made a tomato salsa. Presentation was amazing. Guests raved. Highly recommend!

Excellent flavor. Actually used the Black Bean with Cumin and Jalapeno Soup because I did not have time to soak the beans overnight.

Cute presentation. Great taste. I made this with a spicy black bean soup from epicurious also. We had vegetarian guests, so I substituted the chicken stock with vegetable. Delicious.

The flavors both of this and of the accompanying black been soup were good but a little weak. Next time, I'll use extra-sharp cheddar and three garlic cloves and probably substitute beer for half the chicken broth. I wonder what herbs or spices I could mix in -- coriander and white pepper, perhaps? It was also a bit too thin, so I'll use less milk and and maybe a bit more cheese. Finally, I think the texture would be better if the vegetables were diced instead of julienned.

My husband really liked this. As previous reviewers said, the bean soup is fairly blah. I did the Spicy Black Bean Soup recipe instead and it was fine. The cheese soup really could stand alone.

I have been making this soup for years and my kids love it!!! I love that it's quick and easy to pull off both soups at the same time. I do make some changes... I use the Spicy Black Bean soup (omitting the chilies and jalapeno and adding one can of Rotel, blending with a hand blender). For the Chedder Cheese soup, I use 2 cups of skim milk in place of the whole milk and whipping cream. I use vegetable broth in both soups. Adjust the amount of broth in both soups as necessary to get a similar consistancy in the two soups.

These recipes are a lot of work, but the results are spectacular. A very memorable meal. Not as hard to pour in the same bowl as you might think. Even my kids got a kick out of the two-tone soup. Fun and yummy.

I made the Cheddar Cheese Soup with the Black Bean & Roasted Tomato Soup also from this sitevs the one listed. It was excellant.

Since there are so many great recipes on epicurious, I don't make many a second time, but this is a soup that I return to often. I use this for potlucks because hardly anyone is not a fan of cheese. Plus, by using store bought veggie broth and cheddar cheese, and no salt, it's something that most pallets enjoy. It's fun. I made this with the black bean cilantro soup for a 'transfiguration' themed party. Love it.

Combining the soups did not work for me at all! Any suggestions? The bean soup was a lot thinner than the cheddar soup (which is amazing!) The sediment just sinks to the bottom and left the broth on the top despite constant mixing. I even took some of the broth out. Each soup individually is nice. The black bean soup is not bland which has been my experience w/ b.b. soup. Even though the soups mixed together right away, together, the hybrid soup was really good.

I have to agree with the previous reviewer. The recipe for BLACK BEAN SOUP WITH CILANTRO-LIME SOUR CREAM is absolutely awesome. This recipe for the cheddar cheese soup however was a disappointment, bland and the texture was grainy (which may be my fault since I used olive oil instead of butter to saute the vegetables and added beer instead of just chicken stock. Even my least critical cooking audience, my partner, mentioned that it "needed something". I think that's the concensus here. It's boring. I used 3/4 cup dark beer and 3/4 cup chicken broth, and extra sharp aged cheddar, but it didn't help enough to make me want to try this one again.

Holy cow, was this good. I used the recipe for "BLACK BEAN SOUP WITH CILANTRO-LIME SOUR CREAM" (excellent) for the black part of the soup because it seemed that other reviewers weren't fond of the one given. For the cheese soup, I used 7 oz pepper jack cheese and 2 or 3 oz white cheddar to spice it up a bit, and next time I might stick with pepper jack only. Lastly, on the advice of other reviewers I substituted half of the broth with beer, which seemed to give it a nice depth. Definitely a new staple "wow" dish to server to company.

I liked the bean side of the soup which was good. The cheese side didn't have much flavor at all even after adding the salsa. I would make it again if I could figure out how to make the white side better. Maybe more cheese than what it calls for? It does look pretty cool in the bowl though whith one side being white and the other being dark it is a little ying and yang thing happen so it looks impressive!

I needed to double the recipie, but was short of whipping cream and had to sub yellow cheese for white. That's no problem. This soup is wonderful! I'm still in the tasting phase (haven't even served it yet) and I had to get online to review it! I didn't make the black bean soup, only the cheddar cheese soup.

I gave this four forks because the cheddar soup and presentation are wonderful. Based on reviews, I DID use a different black bean soup recipe - Spicy Black Bean Soup (BA, 7/2002). Oh so good and it dazzles guests.

I used to work at Boudro's years ago, and had this soup whenever I could. What a fab dish!! Serve it with hot Ciabatta bread like at Boudro's and it's a perfect meal. YUMMY! Now only if I could get the recipe for their Duck and Sausage Gumbo...

I also only made the cheddar cheese soup and it was very good. I definitely will make it again with a few changes. I used half beer and half chicken stock and next time I'll use more beer for a little more depth of flavor. In spite of the cream and milk and cheese, this is a surprisingly light and mild soup. I did use nonfat milk instead of the whole milk. Next time I'll use the darkest beer I can find (and more of it) and the sharpest cheddar there is for a little more ompfh. I made this during the Christmas holiday and used only red and green peppers and it was so pretty!

I didn't rate this because I didn't make it as listed. I used the recipe for the cheddar cheese soup as a starting point and it was AWESOME. First, I love onions and peppers, so I almost doubled the amounts listed here. Also, I added about one cup of a good local microbrew to the broth and (of course) used Tillamook sharp cheddar. Homemade beer cheese soup in under an hour??!!! This is a keeper.

This soup is fabulous. I think they are just as good separately as they are together. I make the cheddar portion very often. I don't always have white cheddar, so I've used regular yellow sharp cheddar and it comes out great. We don't get too many cold days here, but when it's cold or rainy this soup is just perfect!

Lovely presentation. I tried to get it as black and white as possible, so I used only yellow bell peppers in the cheese soup, and added some soy sauce to the black bean soup. To get a nice straight line down the middle, try to get both soups equally thick, and pour them really slowly so you have time to compensate if they don't flow evenly.

This is a delicious soup! Took one of the reviewers advice and made it with munster jalapeno cheese, (pepper jack)since we had no white cheddar. We had some leftover cilantro sour cream from a roasted veg. soup from the weekend, and it could not have been better. Did not make the black bean soup after the luke warm reviews, but will look for a good one to make the soup as described in the actual recipe. Very very good!

Quite good and makes an impressive presentation. I served this at a luncheon and everyone raved. I took the advice of others and only pureed about half of the black beans in order to maintain texture. I served with the sour cream herb muffins also on this site.

WONDERFUL! I had this at the restaurant years ago and was thrilled to find it here! It was great to taste it again without having to go all the way to Texas!

A work of art! I have been looking for this recipe for a long, long time and here it is. (THANKS!) It's more chunky than I've had in the past, but it's still fantastic. I would suggest finely chopping the peppers. Try habanero jack cheese instead of cheddar. Makes for a very smooth and mildly spicy soup.

Rating: 4
Beautiful soups! The cheese soup I added a small amount of cayenne which gave it a really nice bite. The black bean soup I toasted whole cumin seed and then ground it, that also was a nice addition. Fresh chicken or vegetable stock is a must. I would without a doubt make this again and again. It's wonderful having a recipe site that you can trust. Thanks to everyone who rates these recipes.

This soup combined with Black Bean soup drew raves from the guests. I used yellow cheddar, which combined with the red, yellow, and green peppers made the presentation just beautiful.

My kids thought this soup was "cool" and asked for seconds. It wasn't as flavorful as I thought it would be. It could use spicing up a bit. But then we're from Texas, and we're used to the heat. Overall, I thought it was quite good and made a nice meal with tortilla chips and guacamole.

The only changes I made were to use only red bell pepper and to use yellow sharp chedder cheese. My husband and I LOVED the creamy taste and texture of the broth and the slightly crunchy texture of the onions and bell peppers. It is great both on it's own and next to the bean soup.

Great flavor. I served it with crunchy french bread. It's a huge meal without anything else.

Wonderful Cheese soup - I added a 1/2 cup of beer reducing the other liquids a bit. Would reccomend using very small pieces of bell pepper then garnishing with matchstick sized.

Visually, this dish is amazing--dinner guests will probably gape a bit when served. Both soups are easy to prepare and undeniably tasty (I would gladly make either or both again), but when push comes to shove, the taste doesn't pack quite the punch that the appearance does. Too bad. Still, definitely recommended.

We served this soup as a part of a larger meal, but it easily should have been served on its own. The black bean soup, prepared with the white soup, is elegant, delicious, and perfect all by itself. I heartily recommend using the tomatillo/sour cream garnish. It blended perfectly with the flavours.

A really beautiful, impressive soup. My husband's eyes about popped out of his head when he looked in the bowl. And better yet, both soups actually tasted better the next day.

I found this recipe very easy to make, it was not time consuming and could be made ahead of time. I served it in black and white bowls and piped the sour cream on with a star tip to make it a little more elegant. The soup was very filling and would recomend a lite main course. I served it before a roast tenderloin of beef served with two side dishes and found my guests were full half way through dinner.

For the cheese soup, I substituted olive oil for butter, the new "Land O Lakes" fat free half and half for the milk and cream, and reduced (by half) fat white cheddar for the cheese. It turned out great and tasted rich. For the black bean I used a can of black beans rinsed to save time. For presentation, use a shallow wide bowl to create a better swirl pattern when mixing. Both soups are very good.

Rating: 3
We used low-fat milk and a high-quality cheddar, and we tripled the recipe. The results were great. The combined soup creates a very showy effect, and the flavours complement each other very well. In our opinion the two garnishes aren't necessary. Both soups are also good on their own, especially the cheese soup, though it's extremely rich. Recommended for anybody who likes earthy flavours and attractive presentation.

This is a yummy cheese soup and a good compliment to the black bean soup. It is really pretty when placed half and half in a soup bowl with the bean soup. I happen to be a Boudro's Restaurant lover! So thrilled to get this recipe! Soups are great!
