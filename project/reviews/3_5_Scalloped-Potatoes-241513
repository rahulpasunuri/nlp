These scalloped potatoes come out perfectly just as the recipe is written except that I halved the milk quantity. I also substituted black-truffle butter for reg butter and served alongside the "Roast Turkey w/Black-Truffle Butter & White-Wine Gravy" (from this site) and my Thanksgiving guests raved. Used a mandeleine to very thinly slice the potatoes and used russets as "boiling potatoes" were not available. Great recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I didn't add any other ingredients, just those listed. Used freshly ground nutmeg. Also used 4mm blade on food processor and thought slices might be too thin, but end result was great. Was still soupy after 1 1/4 hours, so I baked it maybe another 1/2 hour.

Made these potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner and was amazed at how everyone RAVED. I mean, c'mon...it's not like the regular ones were bad, but the freshly grated nutmeg added SO much that I was surprised, too! Delicious! I used Yukon Gold potatoes. This will be the standard at all the holiday dinners from here out!

+ baked covered @ 400 degrees for 45 minutes, pushed down, and then baked an additional 45 minutes uncovered.

Incorporated others' suggestions, resulting in very delicious dish: Additional ingredients: green onions & shallots, flour, shredded cheddar cheese. Also omitted nutmeg, used 2C half and half (no other milk/cream), and full cube unsalted butter (could have used salted). Mistakenly shredded 1/2 the potatoes--worked out fine by alternating layers, starting with shredded on bottom.

Tweaking first time recipes is a "NO- No" for me, however I have not made scalloped potatoes for years....don't know why.... and needed a refresher recipe close to what mine was. This is as close to mine except for a few minor things. No nutmeg, and no broiler. Also, we sprinkle each layer with a few tablespoons of AP flour [prevents soupyness] and add either sliced yellow onions [or shallots which was my choice this time]for more flavor. We use all Half & Half. I cranked the heat up to 400 x's 45 min, uncover, press down, put back in oven, uncovered for another 45 min to complete cooking/brown a little [being careful to watch for over browning]. At that point it was "My recipe". The use of a mandolin/food processor is a wonderful point by one reviewer. Sometimes we also layer with deli ham off the bone. So good that way as well and just add a salad or veggie to make a complete meal.

Oh, and one more thing! Mine looked much lovelier than the photo here. The 4mm blade produced those perfect slices that fanned around the oval baking dish in true "scallop" fashion. Would be a winner to bring to a pot luck.

Fantastique! I made this for 12 people by doubling the recipe. I used the 4mm Cuisinart blade - perfect. I layered salt, pepper, dried thyme and sauteed shallots for flavor and a dusting of potato starch (insted of flour for my gluten-free friend) to compensate for the soupiness others reported. I might have used more of the milk/cream mixture. It did bubble over but OMG, it was worth scraping out the oven for. So magnificent that my guests put it on their "last meal" list.

This is my favourite recipe for scalloped potatoes. It's simple and delicious, I use it at every major holiday and it never ceases to impress!

These potatoes tasted awesome. Like some other comments, my potatoes also were a little runny, but I made the dish again with the potatoes shaved rather than sliced and the dish turned out much better.

This recipe didn`t work out for me. The taste was fine, the nutmeg worked well, and how could potatoes drowned in cream not taste good? But it was far too liquid-y and never came together as it should have. I need to find another recipe.

I hate to burst everyone's bubble, but au gratin does NOT mean with cheese. I think the confusion started when the big companies started marketing packaged dried potatoes. The name actually comes from the name of the pan in which they're cooked, shallow and usually oval. You can cook any vegetable "au gratin'. Potatoes cooked with cheese would be "les pomme de terre avec frommage', or apples of the ground with cheese. Take it from the brother of a chef, and the mother of a chef. By the way, asparagus and leeks make especially nice gratins. Also, I usually skip both the milk and cream and use all half and half. Much easier, although nothing ever beats heavy cream. Happy cooking!

These potatoes were good, except they needed some flour to make the sauce thicker. It was a bit too soupy. Also, I grated cheddar cheese on top and everyone liked that.

When I was looking for a recipe for scalloped potatoes and found this, I thought, nutmeg? Really? I didn't know that's how they were made. This was the most delicious scalloped potatoes I ever had. I'm made it twice already with no adjustments, additions, or substitutions. It's really easy to make, regardless of the time it takes to bake.

Oops, meant to say adding a crumb topping and cheese makes it an au gratin dish.

Will be making today; wanted to note that this is a scalloped potatoes recipe. When you add cheese, it's considered au gratin potatoes.

On each layer of sliced potatoes, I sprinkled the nutmeg, salt, pepper, and small cubes of butter. I also added to each layer: grated parmesan cheese (not measured), very thinly sliced onion (slightly sautéed  1 medium onion total), and sliced baby bella mushrooms (slightly sautéed  8 oz total). Before I was finished assembling the layers of potatoes, I ran out of the nutmeg and salt (which I did not stir together as per the recipe) and had to use more. I also ran out of butter as I was layering the potatoes and used at least an additional tablespoon. I used 1-1/2 cups (12 oz) heavy cream but did not use milk at all. Potatoes were tender after about 1- 1/4 hours...but very soupy. After putting it under the boiler for a few minutes, the consistency stiffened up beautifully. End result: delicious, rich, and creamy...except that it was way too salty. Being that the parmesan is salty, I should have used less salt or none at all. And with the creaminess of the parmesan and the heavy cream, I think the butter may have been an overkill. Next time, Ill experiment by using less (or no) salt and butter...but leaving everything else the same.

I made a roux with butter and 2% milk in lieu of the cream. I also added garlic, and old cheddar cheese. I broiled the entire thing for about 5 minutes to get the cheese nice and crispy. All in all, a good dish, once doctored.

Certainly better than I thought it would be. Took the advice of many of the reviewers. Used half&half and 1%milk instead of whole and cream.

Delicious! The only thing I did was add a bit more cream to cover but I used a bigger dish. Before browning I put fresh parmesan on top. Will do this one many more times.

I took the advice of a chef from Toronto and added cheese - Cheddar is what I had on hand, and a large onion. I only scrubbed, not peeled my potatoes and sliced them and the onion with my food processor, which is such a breeze. I topped it with bread crumbs and it was such a hit - absolutely delicious comfort food. We all agreed that the cheese and onions were a must!

3.5 forks, with modifications. The dish is perfectly structured and the nutmeg/salt/pepper combination actually becomes the centerpiece of the flavours in the dish. Do not hold back on that. Because I personally believe that heart disease and high cholesterol are myths, I felt quite comfortable in adding shredded gruyere between each level. I think I would understand why people would consider this to be "cream-potato soup" absent the cheese. Put it in, you can always go for a jog later on to work it off.

Good basic dish I omitted whole milk used skim and sprinlkled flour between layers along with raw thinly sliced cooking onion and topped with a lil Asiago. Mozza cheese between layers also creams this dish out if sat fats not an issue, Fresh nutmeg a must dusted only top.

Rating: 3
Very good, but I added 1 med. white onion halved/sliced, 2-3 cloves minced garlic, and grated parmesan cheese. I spread those items in between each layer with kosher salt and fresh black pepper. Bake per recipe, then topped with fresh chives and/or fresh parsley. Now it's REALLY GOOOOOD. Will be making again for friends/family.

These are delicious. Simple in flavor but that is what scalloped potatoes are supposed to be. If you have to have cheese with your potatoes, there is a wonderful "scalloped potatoes with 3 cheeses" recipe on Epicurious that is really good. I just used the heavy cream for this one, didn't use any milk. I threw in one finely chopped vidalia onion.

Fast, easy, elegant. Definitely not diet food! These were part of a trout dinner I did, and they were the perfect side dish...offset that healthy fish but good! I followed the recipe exactly, would not change a thing. I think these are great for special occasions with lots of people.

Based on previous reviews, I omitted the whole milk completely. Instead, I added 6 oz. shredded Swiss cheese, divided into thirds. I layered the cheese with the salt mixture and butter, saving a third for the topping. When it was time to broil the baked dish, I sprinkled the remaining cheese on top. The final result was flavorful and not at all soupy.

I found the dish to be quite bland and very runny. As one reviewer said, it was basically potatoes soaked in cream.

Great basic recipe, a keeper with a few suggestions. I usually add grated onion, salt, plenty of pepper and butter to the top and less cream, more milk (50- 50). I also rub the baking pan with fresh garlic.

it was pretty ok... if you like sliced potatoes soaked in whipping cream... Not exactly rivoting in flavor but fairly tasty.

Oh. My. Goodness. This was so good I found myself just eating these directly out of the pan. I'm definitely going to try adding some parmesan or gruyere next time. I don't think it needs cheese, but how could that possibly be bad?

I also added parmesan cheese and slices of onion to each layer, plus plenty of salt and pepper. I liked using the heavy cream instead of whole milk. Very good. Will definitely make again.

Good, solid, classic recipe. Nothing spectacular or exceptional about it, so a solid 3 stars, but not 4. I sometimes add procini mushrooms which play well with the cream and nutmeg... Just reconstitute 3/4 oz in salted boiling water and scatter along with the layers of potatoes.

This has been my tried and true method for scalloped potatoes forever. I add super-thinly sliced onion and thyme. If serving with fish, try adding some shaved fennel and tarragon-perfect accompaniment. Adding a nutty, flavorful cheese, like Parmesan and/or Gruyere puts it over the top... but then you'd have to call it au gratin, n'est-ce pas?
