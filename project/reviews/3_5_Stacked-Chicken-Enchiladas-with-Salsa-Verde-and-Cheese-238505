First, this will be one of those reviews that I hate to read but please note I gave it 4 forks. I made all kinds of changes to use what I had on hand (and what DH mistakenly brought home) and my point is don't be afraid to make changes to this one. Used 2 large flour tortillas in place of the 12 small corn tortillas, Pepper Jack cheese, roasted hatch chiles and used both red and green salsas, the last because DH didn't know what salsa verde was. I pretty much cut the recipe in half and made only 2 layers and this still would have fed 3 hungry people. If I haven't lost you yet, I did a couple of technique changes that I will definitely do again. I brushed my tortillas with oil and warmed them in a 12" skillet; then assembled and baked my enchiladas in the same skillet. This cut down on oil and dirtying up a separate baking pan.

The recipe is decent, but not great. It is a bit bland. It needs more of a roasted / smokey flavor. And a little more bite wouldn't hurt either. And some lime would be great. If you make this, suggest you follow other reviewers recommendations about roasting the tomatillos and peppers, instead of boiling. Also, might cut back on the cilantro a bit. I love cilantro, but this has a lot.

Wowie! Such fresh flavor! Husband and I happily ate leftovers the next two days. Followed recipe exactly - but didn't plan ahead to make the Pickled Red Onion accompaniment - next time!! And there will be a next time.

I loved the flavor of this dish, although my tortillas were still soggy even though I fried them first. Should I fry them to the point where they are super crispy?

I agree that homemade salsa verde is the way to go and roasted tomatillos are superior to boiled. On the other hand, I found this salsa receipe time consuming. Instead, I use the following and I think it is just as good. 3lbs. tomatillos husked and rinsed; cut in half; placed on a foil-lined baking sheet and roasted under the broiler for 5-7 minutes until moderately blackened. (No need to brush them with oil!) Place roasted tomatillos in blender with 2 T lime juice; 1 c. white onion; 1 c. cilantro leaves; 2-4 jalapenos or serrano peppers seeded and sliced; salt and pepper to taste. Store in refrigerator until ready to put the layers together. Next time I will roast the serrano or jalapenos per another reviewer's suggestion. I love the pickeled red onions. The enchiladas can be a tad dry and it is a great accompaniment.

First of all, I highly recommend that you take the time to make your own fresh Salsa Verde...it is so worth the extra effort and the depth of flavor cannot be matched by any commercial salsa verde...I have adjusted the salsa verde recipe to my own taste and I also highly recommend roasting or broiling the tomatillos, peppers, onion etc before blending...then simmer on stovetop for an hour or so to let the flavors deepen...I also add cumin and coriander as well as some dried chili powder and salt and pepper. As for the enchiladas...definitely do fry the tortillas first like the recipe says...it seems to seal in the corn tortilla flavor and keeps them from turning into mush from absorbing the salsa...I also used monterey jack cheese and some Xoacaca (sp?) mexican cheese (a sharp, dry, crumbly cheese) in between the layers and left out the sour cream (served that on the top). I roasted some chicken breasts (after I rubbed them with mexican spices) and made sure I did not over cook them...then just put layers together...I and my family and company were extremely impressed with the depth and layers of flavor and I will definitely make this again. To those who have said they were disappointed or didn't like it...don't be afraid of tweaking the recipe but do not take the shortcut of using commercial salsa verde...once you have made the effort and made your own you will understand why this dish is so wonderful!

One suggestion for the salsa verde: instead of cooking in water, broil peppers and tomatillos with olive oil until tender-- adds a sweet smokiness that you don't get by simmering. And throw in blender-- no need to reheat with oil.

This is a fantastic recipe if you make the "salsa verde" from scratch using the link from the ingredients section. Once you do it this way you'll never go back; it packs a whallop of flavor. The second time we made it, we were in a hurry so we used a jar of "Salsa Lisa Tomatillo and Green Chile" (love their salsas right out of the jar), however, it turned out kind of bland and tasteless. Having the right salsa verde makes all the difference!

I made this for the first time last night. I used Rick Balyless'Frontera Kitchens tomatillo salsa which is made with serrano chiles. The heat level is rated as medium, which for me added just the right kick. I happened to have a roasted chicken that I had frozen earlier. I try to stay away from the supermarket roast chickens because the tend to have a lot of sodium. I used a mexican cheese blend which made things easier. I probably used less salsa than the recipe recommended because Frontera Kitchens salsa is not cheap. The result was cheesy, and delicious and with the shortcuts, very quick to put together. When the supermarket tomatillos look better than they did during my last trip to the store, I may try making my own salsa. I think this should serve more than six depending on how hungry they are and if you serve rice or a salad with it. Yum!

I make this for my family and friends quite often as it is one of their favorites. The only part that takes a little time is roasting the chilis and I do that in advance and store them in the fridge. I use store bought salsa verde and I find the amount of chili heat in this dish depends on what type of salsa verde you use. LaVicotria Salsa Verde is fairly mild as it is made with jalapeno chilis. The Herdez brand, however, is much hotter as it is made with serrano chilis. So if you are concerned about heat, or want more of it, check the ingredients in the salsa verde. The hotter the chili used, the hotter the sauce. Sometimes I combine different salsa verde sauces to get the thickness and heat I want. I use Costco roasted chickens since they are always tasty and easy for me to pick up. I have added jack cheese to the internal layers as well as the top and it turned out great. It reheates beautifully and you can make it and bake it later. All in all this is a delicious dish and difficult to mess up.

Easy and delicious- had restaurant quality flavor. I used pre-made salsa verde from Trader Joe's, lowfat sour cream and six, 8 inch corn tortillas . I cut these in quarters after heating them up. Also I reduced total salsa used by about 1/2 cup per previous previews,

We really enjoyed this dish (although, for two of us, it made a ton and we've been eating it for 4 days!). I used Creme Fraiche instead of regular sour cream, and I made the salsa verde by blitzing all the ingredients in the food processor and then simmering it for about half an hour (as per another review). The only problem that I have is I can't find corn tortillas anywhere around here anymore, so I had to use tortillas that were made with corn flour, which were a little too big. The ingredients barely fit in an 8 x 11 baking dish! The flavors, I thought, were all really great together. It wasn't bland or boring at all. I would definitely make this again!

Rating: 3
Simple and tasty. I was in a rush and used pre-made salsa verde and pre-cooked chicken slices, but it was still good. I decreased the amount of salsa used according to some reviews here. I think it might be even better with jalapeno flavored softened cream cheese instead of sour cream...

Mmmmm, enchilasagne! I fudged this a bit by using pre-fab chile verde sauce, which I doctored up with 2 fresh anaheim chiles and 2 japenos, charred, peeled, seeded & chopped. And I used regular ol Jack cheese. But in defense of my kitchen work ethic, I simmered the chicken breasts in stock, fresh crushed garlic, lime juice and minced red chiles rather than just chuckin em in the oven and roasting. Turned out awesome! The beau thought that it could have been a bit spicier, so maybe next time Ill use the poblanos if theyre easily procured, or a couple more jalapenos. But maybe not. It was pretty darn good just the way it was! I love a recipe that yields tasty leftovers for a couple of days, and this one didnt disappoint.

This recipe is really delicious and fairly easy to make. I made a few changes that result in a lighter enchilada in less time. 1) For salsa verde, put all raw ingredients in food processor and puree. Then put all into large pan and cook on medium heat for about 30 minutes. 2) Double the amount of mint and 2 additional cloves of garlic. 3) Use nonfat sour cream. 4) Use "extra-thin" yellow corn tortillas. Took me about 1 hour total prep time including cooking the chicken. Yum!

Easy and delicious. I have made the salsa a couple of times - twice with fresh and once with canned tomatillos. Results were very similar....be careful to not add too much salt if using canned. I brushed bothed sides of the corn tortillas with olive oil and only used about a tablespoon - plenty. Used roasted chicken from the grocery store. Would probably be great with leftover turkey from thanksgiving. Will make again. Double it and it would be great for a crowd.

Made this dish with GREAT success, will make again! Tangy with just the right amount of heat but beware, most will consider this too spicy......not my wife and I. I recommend using Asadero cheese instead of their recommendations and also I used Cotija cheese in place of the sour cream..........FANTASTIC.

This was possibly one of the worst enchilada dishes I've tasted. It was too soggy and would not make again. Way too much salsa, do not put this much if you do make this. Also, Emmenthal, does not go with the enchiladas, I suggest you use a mexican cheese! The attached recipe, salsa verde, on the other hand, as well as the pickled red onions is EXCELLENT.

Great recipe... my garden didn't produce enuff tomatillios, so I made 1/2 the amout of Salsa Verde so I only made 1 layer .. but it was great anyway, very authentic. Will def. make again with enuff' tomatillios. Also I omitted the peppers to avoid eating the whole jar of TUMS later in the evening! LOL Everyone loved them!

I made this with success - picky teenagers thought it was worthy of a repeat. I had 1/2 the tomatillos needed, thus half chile verde amount requested, and it still was very good. Kids suggested the sour cream was not necessary, which agreed with some reviews. Chile verde was easy to make - it's basically simmering stuff, then grinding it with some ingredients in the food processor. I don't really know what the complaints about it being complicated were about. One major question: has anyone made this in advance (one day or so) and then cooked it? I'm looking to bring it to a friend's weekend house and want to do it ahead of time. Any advice appreciated.

This is my girlfriend's favorite thing I have EVER made for her. I change it up a bit by putting fake 'veggie' chicken instead because she (my girlfriend) is a vegetarian. We make it for friends all the time now and everyone loves it. They don't even know that there isn't chicken really in it.

I made this yesterday. We found it too spicy. Even my husband, who likes very spicy food, thought it was too hot. I think two jalapeno peppers were too much. Next time I will use only one jalapeno. The pablano chilis also added quite a bit of spiciness. I used the 4 cheese mexican combo and sprinkled it between the layers.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and his mother, who is from Mexico-- she absolutely loved the salsa verde! High marks from a self-proclaimed salsa connoisseur! The dish turned out great. I did the chicken the day before and had originally planned to do the salsa the day before (didn't happen that way, but would have helped). I also added cheese in the layers, which I thought was a great touch. Looking forward to left overs tonight and will definately make this again!

good basic recipe - i did not see the need to dip the tortillas in oil though since i was not rolling them up. i just layered them with the salsa and shredded chicken and they were fine (tortillas softened up anyway with the salsa). also i cooked some chicken breasts with cumin and chili powder before i shredded them.

Made this last night for company. I used more cheese than recipe states. I used a combo of Ementhal and Chihuaha (sp?) Add some extra cheese in the layers. Store-bought roasted chicken makes the recipe much easier. Next time, I'll make the salsa ahead of time. This is a recipe I'll make again for sure -- maybe with seafood? Anyone try that?

I thought this dish was a great, simple dish and don't understand the negative comments in the reviews. For the Salsa Verde, I made a day in advance and did omit the mint (in magazine, it has been omitted online). I thought it was good, my first attempt at salsa verde, but I assume there is a better recipe out there. The enchiladas were very tasty - I used muenster cheese and a roasted chicken from the grocery store. I didn't think the prep took a crazy amount of time, but I did make the salsa in advance.

The Cook from Oakland was exactly right. This dish is OUTSTANDING and the salsa verde is the key. I made the dish the first time with prepared salsa verde and it paled by comparison with the "full" version WITH the Red Pickled Onions. The combination of flavors and textures was exceptional. I bought more fresh tomatillos at the farmstand market today to make the recipe again!

Not as fantastic as I had anticipated; the pickled onions were probably the best part! It was a little too dry and, using muenster cheese, it didn't have alot of cheese flavour.

This was exceptional. I used about twice as much cheese including it in the layers. And I probably doubled the chicken (I just kept adding it until it was spread out). I used a 9x13 deep dish and it fed 12 people. It was the rave of the party (it was a potluck sort of thing). Although it took time making the salsa verde that was the key to a huge success. I can't beieve everyone doesn't love it.

The flavor of these was simply delicious but it's a fair amount of work for a pretty basic dish if you make the tomatillo sauce from scratch. I used a rotisserie chicken, which was great, but I think I'll try it again with some purchased tomatillo sauce to see if I can spped up preparation for busy weeknights. If not, I'd still probably make it again, but when I had more time to kill.

I used store bought salsa verde, so my review is only a half review. I thought this was just OK, a little too acidic for me without the depth of flavor I'd hoped for. I think may I don't love tomatillas, so making with the homemade salsa may be a mute point.

Simple, delicious, casual meal. I actually made it while we were camping in our trailer, so I made it even easier by getting a pre-made rotisserie chicken from the store and buying four cans of my favorite chile verde sauce. But to add the uniques of the salsa verde recipe here, I added the mint and cilantro to the pre-made salsa verde and it made it stellar! Frying the tortillas in oil is a must, otherwise they will absorb the salsa. I bought serrano instead of poblano peppers, and I only recommend that if you want it HOTTER! Perfect meal to bring to a potluck. EASY...I MADE IT CAMPING!

This recipe was fantastic and to the ones that rated it low, I really wonder what happened? All I can say is this one now replaces the recipe I used to use. I only made a few slight changes. I used my own Salsa Verde recipe because it is killer good, I used bagged 4 cheese mexican blend and also added some to the layers, and for the chicken I could not find roasted chicken anywhere so I grilled 2 chicken breasts on the grill with a roasted chicken rub that I made myself. I did not add the pickled red onions because I forget to buy them but I did add to the tops of our servings sour cream, diced tomatoes, sliced black olives and fresh cilantro. Thank you for a wonderful recipe. It is a keeper!!

Don't shy away from using the habanero pepper in the pickling marinade--the taste is a blast!

I made these enchiladas last night for dinner....yes a little time consuming, but it's worth the time. We thought it didn't lack any flavor. Everyone loved it. I agree with other reviewers when at all possible ALWAYS use fresh ingredients. It's always better than out of a can. I used jack cheese because I couldn't find the Chihuahua and I used 3/4 lb. and added it between the layers along with more sour cream. It was very moist and held together. Absoutely delicious.....Try it you'll like it.

I returned from Mexican vacation and was inspired to cook a Mexican dish. The magazine cover photo looked great and the recipe sounded great. After reading the reviews, I went for it anyway. I'm not a big fan of mint in cooking, but included it. The only things I did differently is to roast the tomatillos and jalapenos in the oven and add cheese in each layer. I used organic hand-made tortillas, and everything came together great. I will reduce the amount of mint and probably use serrano chilies next time. I prefer the heat and taste of serranos over jalapenos.

The pickled onions were wonderful and the tomatillo salsa was really good. I used the very freshest ingredients to make this. Still it was ok. It smelled great when it was in the oven but the tortillas soaked up all the sauce and it seemed a little dry.

I also had to use canned tomatillos and added a can of hot salsa verde with the jalepenos; used leftover grilled chicken legs that had a jerk seasoning on skin but that helped up the heat level a little as well. Loved the pickled onions and still have plenty left over from last week when I made this. Have made other variation of stacked enchilladas and they are much easier than all that rolling for traditional style! Served with green salad and margaritas. Husband upped the heat quotiant with hot sauce as always; I thought they were just fine as is.

I am surprised after reading the some of other reviews...kinda negative. I made this recipe and because of our nutty schedule took some short cuts - I used purchased salsa - and a purchased roasted chicken, which was great. Yes roasting the peppers took some time - next time I will try onions. I thought the recipe came together quickly I only put cheese on the top and it was very cheesy. I put the "enchiladas" in the oven - drove an hour to pick up my daughter and returned to find my son and his girlfriend devouring the enchiladas! I thought it was really good - my son had 3 helpings! Next time I will make a larger batch. I suggested this recipe to my sister. Much easier than traditional enchiladas!!!

This was just alright. It looked beautiful and smelled great while it was cooking so it was a little dissapointing when it was just ok.

The onions on the other hand were fantastic!

I followed the suggestions below and added muenster cheese to the layers (after the chicken and poblanos) and was generous with the sour cream. The enchiladas were simply wonderful.

I made this recipe using whole canned tomatillos (no heat) mixed with most of a small can of tomatillo salsa (hot) I didn't have any mint, so I just used cilantro and Italian parsley.

This recipe took a lot of time to make, but came out looking as beautiful and appetizing as the cover photo. However, we didn't really enjoy eating it. We both love salsa verde, but this salsa came out very tart and "citrusy" and no one wanted seconds because the tart taste was so cloying. It also would have been better with cheese between all the layers. I could not find Chihuahua cheese and substituted Machego, which was quite tasty.

This recipe was very time consuming, but not difficult to make. I did make the salsa as per the recipe and it was excellent. I didn't find the overall flavor to be bland given the poblanos added spice as did the 2 jalepenos in the salsa. Will definitely make again.

I loved this recipe; I have to say though that I changed it around a little. I made the salsa according to the directions and the results were excellent. I highly recommend using the mint in the salsa because it really goes well with the rest of the flavors. I made a no-carb version and I actually used the Poblano chiles as the layering component instead of the tortillas. I also added cheese within each layer. I used shredded cheddar cheese because thats what I had. The result was really really good. This dish does take a couple of hours to make, but it is very easy and it is totally worth the time.
