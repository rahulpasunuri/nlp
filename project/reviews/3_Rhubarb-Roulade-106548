some people said it was too dry. Instead of one pound of rhubarb I used two ( but I did not quite doubled the amount of sugar): the result was very moist. You can also serve it with a strawberry coulis on the side

Just as the other reviewer said, the cake was too dry. Maybe I overbaked it?

Very easy recipe even for a reluctant baker. Reminds me of summers on the North Sea in Germany.

This dish was wonderful, but a little dry. My family loved it and i'm sure that you will too!
