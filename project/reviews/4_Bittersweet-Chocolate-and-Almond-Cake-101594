Like others, I reduced the sugar. 3/4c in my case, because I was using sweeter chocolate than the recipe calls for. The balance was perfect. I also decided to see if reducing the butter to 1.5 sticks would impact the recipe, and it didn't at all. This will definitely be my go-to torte recipe in the future.

By far the best chocolate torte I have ever made. Very, very easy. Be sure to beat the eggs enough so they are foamy. Baking time was only 40 minutes, so watch for that. I followed other readers' suggestions and used only 1 cup of sugar and didn't serve with cream on top. Instead, I topped with a little bit of powdered sugar and served with vanilla ice cream on the side. Got rave reviews at a dinner party and it looks very fancy. This is a keeper!

Great recipe, easy to make and delicious. I also reduced the sugar to just under one cup, and that was perfect, would've been too sweet other wise. I dusted the top with cocoa to give it a truffle effect instead of the cream topping. My only comment, my URGENT comment is to REDUCE the baking time! I took my cake out at 40 minutes and it was almost overbaked.

Was very easy and delicious! I used a little less sugar (1 cup), and 70% bittersweet chocolate. My guests really liked it and asked for the recipe. I will definitely make this again - simple to make and a great way to end a meal.

Not life changing, but delivers the chocolate and is quick and easy to prepare. The bittersweet chocolate I used had almonds in it, so it was a nice surprise to occasionally bite into a whole almond. I didn't find the whipped topping necessary.

I made this when looking for a chocolate fix. It was easy and delicious and keeps well (without the topping) for several days. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup, and that was fine, also I used 70% Lindt chocolate. I think high quality chocolate is a must for this cake. Serve it warm with icecream and the toasted almonds or from the fridge with cream topping. Both options are yummy! Next time I might experiment with less butter and applesauce as a sub.

This recipe's fantastic, easy, and foolproof. I even substituted skim milk for the cream, and it turned out beautifully. Dinner party guests loved it! I did add a tsp of almond extract to enhance the almond flavor. Delicious!

A little less sugar is just fine. :) Also forget the whipped cream. I just added Trader Joe's cocoa hazelnut spread as frosting. AMAZING.

Delicious, perfect ending for a dinner party for 8. Used 1/2t vanilla and 1/2t almond extract to bring out almond flavor, and left in fridge overnight. I would take it out of the oven 10 min earlier next time. Served with ball of vanilla ice cream and fresh raspberry sauce with chambord (also on the site). Our guests were almost licking the plates!

This was so easy to prepare and very well received by our guests. It wasn't very 'almondy' though. Next time I'll sub almond extract for the vanilla. My cake didn't fall that much in the center so I didn't have to press the edges down with a fork...maybe because I'm at 7000 feet altitude?? It was still nicely fudgy in the center and wonderfully yummy. A definite keeper!

Amazing!! I had only four eggs at home, and I also made the preparation easier by using pre-ground almonds for the batter and pre-slivered almonds for the top. I served it with a small ball of vanilla ice cream on the side (and only almond slivers on top). Also, I baked it for only 50 minutes, leaving the center gooey, and served it warm. A real treat!!!

This is a wonderful cake, and so easy to make. It's a little difficult to cut because the knife gets stuck, but otherwise it won raves from my nephew. Regarding prepared pans; it varies from recipe to recipe. In this case, the 2nd sentence states "Butter 9-inch-diameter springform pan", so that's all you have to do.

On my review below... Full disclosure, we did forget to add about 10% of the nut/flour mixture. Also, can someone tell me if a "prepared pan" is greased and floured, or just greased?

This was pretty easy to make, even for a non-baker. But I wasn't too impressed with the results. It was rich and chocolatey, but pretty much tasted like and had the texture of a big brownie. Full disclosure, we did forget to add about 10% of the nut/flour mixture. The unsweetened whipped cream was a good complement. Can someone tell me if a "prepared pan" is greased and floured, or just greased?

I will say we accidentally put in about 10% less of the nut/flour mixture. The unsweetened whipped cream was a good complement. Can someone tell me if "prepared pan" means it should be greased and floured or just greased?

Oop's I reviewed the wrong recipe. I meant to review CHOCOLATE-GLAZED COCONUT-ALMOND CAKE. My bad! This may be as good, but trust me you can't get much better then the other one!!

Incredible!!! The only thing I changed is I used milk chocolate, because that is what I like. It worked well. This does take some time. If you make the cake part the night before, it is no big deal. It just takes time to let things cool. I would even make it in a sheet pan and just use the filling for frosting. I think you would need to double the filling if doing that. Yummy!

This is really great. I am not a chocoholic enough to appreciate it fully-very fudgy, more so than cakelike.

This is a true keeper. I have made this several times and everyone goes crazy over it and it's very elegant to look at. Not too hard to make either. My 13 year old niece made it under my supervision.

Definately a must! Rave reviews and not a big time investment!

I'm big on the chocolate flourless torte concept. This particular recipe rates high on the valuemeter---that is, the ratio between taste and the time spent in preparing the dessert is extremely high. You can get it into the oven in less than half an hour and the taste is comparable to tortes requiring a number of more steps. The most timeconsuming thing is toasting the slivered almonds, but if you live near a Trader Joe's, voila!

Received rave reviews from friends! Next time I wouldn't put the cream all over the cake (looks messy) and instead just add a dollup with a sprinkle of almonds.

Wonderful, wonderful! Have made several times. Have plenty of sweetened cream on the side and careful not to overbake. Use the best chocolate you can find, it makes a huge difference.

very rich, very easy, and a very very big hit. would be perfect for a passover cake, just change the cake flour to cake meal.

I've made this cake for a friend's birthday, a wedding shower and several dinner parties and it always gets rave reviews. For a true chocolate lovers delight, top with chocolate ganache and serve whipped cream on the side.

Excellent, chocolatey, and very easy. A big hit!

anything that doesn't require the creaming of butter and sugar is a delight. This cake is easy to make and tasty.
