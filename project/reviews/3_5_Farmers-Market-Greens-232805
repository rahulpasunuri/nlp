Just ok. I'm not a big kale fan but I had some from my organic box to use and mixed it with other greens. I added some shaved parmigiano for some more taste. I also didn't have edible flowers.

I've made many, many vinaigrettes but the one for this salad is now my favorite for its simplicity. It reminded me of those perfectly dressed greens you get in French bistros.
