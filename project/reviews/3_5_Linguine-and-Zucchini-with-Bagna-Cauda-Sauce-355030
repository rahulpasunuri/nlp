So simple and tasty. Sauteed the zucchini in the olive oil, and meanwhile added the anchovy and garlic. Used half and half, and much less than a cup, with excellent results.

I wanted to like this one a lot more than I actually did. It was pretty bland. My husband ate it - but completely without comment and no seconds. That told me not to try this one again.

Absolutely wonderful! I used a whole can (8-10?) of anchovies rolled with capers -- the capers added nice extra flavor. I was able to julienne the zucchini easily by laying sidewise chunks cut to fit the wide- mouth tube of my Cuisinart combined with the coarse shredding disc. Perhaps even easier would be to simply saute thinly-sliced zucchini in olive oil and combine at the end instead of adding the zucchini to the water.

Totally shoulda used the whole can of anchovies. Other than that, delish! And waaaay too easy (hardest part was matchsticking the zuke).

Not being one for anchovies, but having them on hand for caesar dressing, I made this recipe in a heartbeat, added in some of my own home grown heirloom tomatoes, a few mushrooms and basil with the zucchini and pasta.. and let me tell you, thank goodness my girlfriend came over for dinner because I would have eaten the entire thing, and I rarely make pasta for dinner!! This is on the top of my New favorites! Definitely will make this again!

This is delicious and easy. The only change I would make is to add more anchovies. Maybe keep them whole and then place them on top of each plate of pasta right before serving.
