Fabulous recipe. I used fresh baked pie pumpkin which also makes it even more special. Lovely flavour!!!!!

This was a relatively tasty cake, but is a huge amount of work. The best tasting part is the caramel icing, but as others have pointed out, it ends up as more of a caramel sauce that droops down the side.

The flavor of the cake itself was OK (I used pecans instead of walnuts), but overall, this recipe is not worth the time it takes. Also, I don't understand how a recipe with serious flaws regarding the icing can be given 4 forks. In general, this cake is a seasonal variation of German's Sweet Chocolate cake. The icing is very tricky to make, and I wonder if it really can be all things: gooey enough for a filling, smooth enough for the top of the cake, and firm enough to adhere to the sides without running down. At first I thought I had gotten my "amber syrup" too dark, and I was going to end up with caramel candy in my icing. I beat in the cream cheese mixture furiously, and I ended up with a warm, gooey icing that flowed nicely over the top of the cake and down the sides in a few places. (It would have been helpful if the directions had included a target temperature or a "ball" stage.) I should have just poured more icing over the top and covered all of the sides in this manner, because the icing never did firm up sufficiently in the refrigerator to coat the sides well--or cover up the gap between the two layers, due to the thick filling (note gap in photo). The strips of orange people sprinkled on top add visual appeal and flavor, but if you follow the directions, the freshly cut orange strips are put on at the last minute. After a few hours, they wither and no longer look appetizing. I think the strips should bathe in some kind of a syrup in order to preserve them. This cake has so much goo, I didn't serve it with the warmed, reserved caramel icing.

I just made the cake part of this recipe and thought it was great/very moist. I made the batter into cupcakes and made a few changes. Used whole wheat pastry flour instead of cake flour, subbed Agave syrup for the sugar, reduced oil to 2/3 C. Baked at 325 for about 22 minutes. The cupcakes rose nicely and have a lovely pumpkin flavor. I used a standard cream cheese frosting, since they are for a 4 yr. old birthday party.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving. Absolutely delicious! Please follow recipe exactly. I have made the pumpkin cake with caramel cream cheese frosting from Bon Appetit Nov 2008 also, and I think this cake trumps that one - better textural contrast and the pure caramel icing enhances the pumpkin flavor more than the cream cheese version dose. The second time I made this cake I accidentally let my dried fruit sit in the rum for over an hour - DONT let this happen to you. The dried fruit ended up tasting like shots of rum - not appetizing.

I love this cake! It is so moist and delicious! I will make it again, however I used my own cream cheese frosting recipe on the outside and the caramel on the inside. It all worked out great!

Absolutely delicious! I would definitely make it again. The frosting was a bit difficult to frost and would recommend trimming the edges of the cake layers to make sure they are level as well as chilling the frosting for more than an hour to thicken. I got rave reviews!

4 cups of sugar!!! I tried to reduce a bit (maybe half cup less in cake, and half less in frosting). I got reactions like: "The best cake I've ever eaten." It takes a loooong time to make, but it's a fun project if you enjoy baking. Highly recommend.

I only made the cake part of the recipe, but it was exceptionally delicious and received rave reviews. I made it in cupcake form, baking them for 25 minutes. I used regular flour instead of cake flour, because it was all we had, and a cup of softened salted butter instead of the oil because we only had olive and sesame oil. Kosher salt. Ground cardamom instead of the allspice and 1/4 tsp of ground cloves instead of 1/8 by accident. 2 tsps of vanilla instead of one. 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of light brown sugar, like I do in pumpkin pie. I mixed the flour, spices, soda, and powder together in a bowl, and then creamed the sugars and butter in the food processor and added the eggs and vanilla, and then the pumpkin. I mixed the wet into the dry by hand with a spatula and was worried about overbeating it, but they rose really high and had a great texture, even with opening the door 10 minutes before they were done. Very easy recipe and intensely flavorful. I was really craving pumpkin for fall and this was perfect.

i made this exactly as stated for christmas and it was AWESOME! I repeated it for a cocktail party and made it into cupcakes. i filled about 25 muffin cups till 1/2 full and baked them. i then cut them into half in and added a layer of caramel with cranberries and walnuts before icing them. it was great! i had no problem with the consistency of the icing even when making the cake.

I made this cake but used the ginger cream cheese icing (from this site). It was delicious! The cake was very moist and flavorful. My guests could not get enough!

I served this to 15 friends to celebrate October birthdays. It was a huge hit. The caramel icing was so scrumptious! I followed the tip given by the cook from Tallahassee, FL in 2004. I, too, added a little powdered sugar and cream, just enough to get it to a good spreadable consistency. I did this for the sides only. The top of the cake had the icing as shown in the picture. Everyone loved the taste of the rum as well.

this has to be the most beautiful cake i've ever made; however, i had a lot of trouble with the caramel icing. first, i think 10 minutes is too long--the icing tastes a little "boiled." and no matter how much i stirred it, i ended up with little tiny lumps in it that wouldn't come out no matter what. i ended up putting the cranberry topping all over the top because there was simply too much for a ring around the edge. all in all, though, it's a gorgeous cake. one more thing--i baked it for 25 minutes and should have checked it sooner, so watch the cooking time.

First of all,I must say that pumpkin cake has never been heard of where I live, so I decided to try it for the very first time - and it was AWESOME! We don't have canned pumpkin(!) here, so I steamed something we call 'Japanese pumpkin' and used it instead. I also used 1/2 cup corn oil and 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, which added a very exotic taste and texture. I added some ground cardamom to all the spices the recipe called for, and the resulting cake was absolutely wonderful. Its deep orange color, the great spicy taste, everything was so yummy! Ah, I was forgetting - I only made the cake, no icing or syrup was necessary. My friends were so surprised when I told them the cake they were trying had pumpkin as one of the main ingredients - but all of them definitely loved it. A real keeper!

To the cook from Australia. Yes, you can certainly use cooked pumpkin in lieu of canned.

I loved this cake and it tasted great! But like others I had a problem with the icing. The second time I made the cake it ran all over the cake and plate and even when I put it in the refrigerator, it still ran. I want to make it againl, but I want a non-runny carmel icing.

It seems that pumpkin cakes are popular in the US- its pratically unheard of in Australia. I would love to try this cake but we dont have "canned pumpkin" here.Can I just use cooked pumpkin instead?Or is there a special way to prepare it? Also Im guessing that because this cake is made with oil it is very moist and has good keeping qualities?Is it likely to dry out in the fridge after a few days?Can anyone help? Ta

I too baked this cake for the holiday season. The caramel icing was gorgeous and the cake was moist... a tad too moist. In fact, it was moist to the point of density. And the icing, while glistening and beautiful, drooped. It also seemed far too sticky and sugary (well, duh, its caramel) for a cake. It was more like I was eating a confection. On the night I served it approximately 1/4 of the cake was eaten. The rest was pitched the next day. I probably won't be making this cake again, unless it is out of sheer desparation.

I made this cake for Christmas Dinner, and it was a huge hit, especially the caramel icing! I made this in lieu of pumpkin pie, and made this into a sheet cake instead of a double-layer. The only thing I found wrong in this recipe is that I had to make extra rum sauce because the initial batch I cooked with the cranberries and raisins had evaporated too quickly with the dried fruit in the sauce absorbing most of the liquid. It was still a big hit and I will make it again for a special occasion.

Rating: 4
I LOVED this cake, as did everyone who tasted it. I made it as written, except used golden raisins and cranberries sweetened with apple juice(no sugar). I think that was a key element because they stayed fairly sour and offered a perfect contrast to the super sweet caramel sauce. Also, pecans instead of walnuts. The caramel sauce is divine. I had some extra and laughed as my mother and sister spooned extra sauce over the already decadent cake. Make the caramel sauce... it's work but totally worth it.

This is the perfect pumpkin fix. Cake was moist and flavorful. I played around with the icing a little--I put the caramel icing on the outside--studded with plumped cherries instead of cranberries--and used a maple frosting, without nuts or berries, for the inside. I also halved the recipe and it worked great.

Rating: 3
It was a hit, looked very festive, got a lot of compliments. But I agree with previous reviewers - frosting was tough to handle. So don't stress out about it. Do as one of folks suggested - let it run down the sides and puddle around the cake, then cover up with the mixed fruit. It tastes so good, they won't mind.

Rating: 3
While the cake itself was delicious, I personally did not like the caramel icing even though my sister loved it. I may make the cake again someday but not the icing. I should have just used the cream cheese icing as other reviewers had done. I also found it (the caramel) very messy and sticky.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it! The most important thing with the frosting is not to over cook it and to let it chill enough to be somewhat solid when poured.

Excellent recipe. I use walnut oil (Spectrum is a good brand). The cake can be filled with with pumpkin butter (American Spoon Foods or Trader Joe's brand) and iced with cream cheese frosting or just dusted with powdered sugar.

This recipe is much too time consuming. What made it disappointing is that the pieces did not slice cleanly but crumbled as you were lifting them onto the plate. I would not make it again.

Oh Yeah, I almost forgot.. About the icing, it was thin for me, too, but really didn't cause that much of a problem. I had no problem with the filling, that held together nicely. However, instead of frosting the cake like the recipe described, I just took about a cup of the icing and poured it on top of the cake. It covered the top of the cake and ran down the sides, giving it a 'glazed' look. Some of the icing puddled on the cake plate, but instead of placing the remainng nuts/rasins/cranberries on top of the cake, I placed them along the bottom of the cake with the puddled icing. I topped the cake with a 'dolop' of the filling and an orange spiral. It was a real hit!

I have made this recipe at least half a dozen times. It turns out moist and delicious every time(and I am NOT an experienced baker!!). It also has a nice presentation that increases its appeal. Great for Christmas get-togethers!!

This recipe was the hit of a dinner party. It is incredbly beautiful and extremely flavorfull and fun to make. Some said the icing was too runny... I just put it in the fridge for about 1 hour before frosting and it was perfect. After frosting it stayed on the cake solidly at room temperature for a couple of days.

This is wonderful. I adapted it for high-altitude baking -- 5,280 feet -- by cutting the sugar to 1 2/3 cup sugar and the oil to 3/4 cup. It was perfect.

This cake was so wonderful. I made it yesterday for my mom's Oct birthday. The cake is very dense, but super-moist and very flavorful. The icing was fun to make because I'd never done anything that way before, but it didn't set-up as well as I was expecting. I didn't have trouble with the cake layers sliding, and the icing on the top of the cake set to a perfectly smooth consistency, but it kept running down the sides and the layers showed through. With the fruit/nut decoration on top, it was still quite lovely and relatively professional looking, but when I make this again, I might beat the cream cheese without the whipped cream, and then fold in the caramel when it's cooled more and won't melt the cream cheese. I don't know if that would work. The icing was just so delicious that I can't imagine this cake without it.

Lots of steps and lots of pots to wash, but this came out beautifully, in terms of both taste and presentation. No problems with the icing on my end. Delicious fall flavors--would be a great Thanksgiving dessert, if you're sick of the old standards.

Wonderful recipe that filled the home with a lovely wafting fragrance. A "must make" for one's honey. Was daunted by the scary reviews of the icing, hence did not attempt to make the icing. Try this recipe with 2 tablespoons of molasses. Yum, and delish.

This cake was marvelous. I didn't have any trouble with the frosting. I poured the caramel into the cream cheese mixture away from any heat. Don't know if that made a difference or not. It was even better the next day with coffee for breakfast. It is time consuming but worth it!

Maybe this cake tastes good- but the recipe was just too complicated for my amateur baking skills. The frosting was impossible to get right, even in three attempts. The cake itself felt too dense- I didn't even try it, but wound up buying a spice cake mix and doctoring it with some real pumpkin. Unless you are a baker- don't attempt this recipe as part of a holiday meal- you'll have enought work on your plate without it.

This cake was a big hit. It looked professional and tasted great. Rave reviews! Re the icing thanks to whomever suggested BASIC CREAM CHEESE ICING BASE WITH CARMEL ADDED. It worked fine. No sliding. For the filling I did it as recipe called w/o incident. Not much rum left for spreading on cakes so had to add extra.

Good cake but I couldn't use the icing. It tasted like pure melted butter which was quite disgusting. I used an orange-flavored whipped cream topping and filling. It looked great and got rave reviews but I was disappointed I couldn't use the original icing as I had to throw half the cake away as it was frosted with real cream and wouldn't keep. Would anyone care to re-vamp this recipe with a do-able icing and filling?

This is a fantastic and beautiful cake that I would be proud to serve to company. I chilled the icing overnight and it still slid a little bit - but it didn't matter at all -it was still beautiful (my husband took a picture!) and tasted great. It is time consuming if made all at once, but it can be made in stages and assembled later. It is dense, so serve small slices.

This might work better as cupcakes. The icing was just impossible to use. The cake was really good, but no amount of freezing the icing made it worthwhile

The cake was absolutely fantastic. I didn't read the recipe through (my bad) and didn't have enough time to make and chill the frosting. So, I mixed some of the caramel mixture into a basic cream cheese frosting recipe. Yum. Raves all around. Would make the cake again in a heartbeat.

This was so yummy! I got lots of great compliments. I will make again for Thanksgiving. Thre recipie worked very well. Icing needs to cool longer than an hour to stick to sides though. You should make this on a day you have a lot of time on your hands, it is time consuming, but then again, I am a very new cook, so Im kinda slow... :)

I was concerned about the icing on the sides sliding, so I chilled the frosting a little longer. It worked very well. I served this at a large party and it was the centerpiece without a doubt. The frosting is incredible. The cakes very moist. It is time consuming, but really a wonderful cake.

I agree that this cake tasted wonderful. The frosting is luscious. But I'm curious as to what other cooks did to keep the frosting on the sides of the cake. I thought the slow slide would stop once the cake was in the refrigerator, but a great deal of the frosting ended up puddled on the cake plate. Any suggestions?

I am only 14, and I was able to make this cake for the family, during fall because its such a holiday cake. It was so good that my mom had me make it again for her neighborhood party! This is pretty time consuming, but totally worth it. I swear you could eat the pumpkin cakes alone too!!

This cake is delicious! I had a little trouble with the caramel icing dripping off the side of the cake, but it didn't matter since it tasted so good. I made the cake again, this time with a cream cheese frosting (the caramel icing was better but the cream cheese frosting took less time).
