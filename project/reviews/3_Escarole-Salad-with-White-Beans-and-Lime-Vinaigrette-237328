Used mixed greens, but otherwise followed recipe. Delicious salad!

Made this to take to a buffet party. Used recipe as shown, but added 1/2 c crumbled cotija (dry mexican cheese) and 1 lb. cooked shrimp. Rave reviews from all partygoers! Have added this to my list of favorites.

Really liked this a lot. Used spring greens instead of the escarole, everything else as written. So easy and a great salad. Goes well with the posole.

Generally do not like making salads, as they taste better when someone else makes them; however, liked the combination of ingredients in this recipe and made it for my supper club - wonderfully easy and enjoyable to prepare. I recommend using pitted olives in jar, as tasty and require no handling. Also, I was too shy with serrano and left out pulp and seeds - don't be shy! Made it second time and much better with the spiciness. Loved the pumpkin seeds on top!

I was surprised by the low rating that this recipe got! I really enjoyed it--the olives and pumpkin seeds and lime juice gave it lots of zing. I couldn't find an escarole mix so I added some escarole to a mache mix. Made for a really satisfying lunch salad. I'll definitely make it again.

I served this with the Shrimp & Scallop Posole - they definitely complement each other. Escarole was hard to find so I used mixed salad greens with bitter greens added. The Kalamata olives are really important - throw in a few extra! Oh, make sure that you use FRESH lime juice and taste and season your dressing. Nice layers of flavor enhanced by the crunch of the pepitas!

very boring with very little flavor.
