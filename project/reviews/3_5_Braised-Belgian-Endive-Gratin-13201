My first attempt at endive, and I quite liked it! I realized near the end that I didn't have a suitable cheese for the gratin, so I just sprinkled plain breadcrumbs from a slice of crusty white bread, and drizzled about 2 teaspoons of heavy cream on top. I don't know if endive is supposed to be this savory, maybe next time I will cut the broth with some water.

I made this dish last night with 40-garlic chicken and it was a great accompaniment. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to include some of the braising liquid in the gratin dish - the endive were not dry but I think it would have been a little more flavorful with just a tablespoon or so of the liquid.

I was looking for a way to use a couple of endives I found in the bottom of the fridgerator, and this was just right. I substituted parmesan and put a little cream on the top - yum.

This was my first endive preparation. I substituted a less flavorful cheese for Gruyere. Will not make that mistake again. In my opinion, simmering the endive in chicken stock is key -- beats other endive dishes I've made since then.

My favorite vegetable. This is an easy way to prepare the Belgian endives and excellent with mashed potatoes and pork chops or fillet mignon. This recipe is not new to me as I have prepared them this way for more than 40 years! How about that?
