Way to sweet, but lots of potential for these ingredients. I doubled the quantity of apples, halved the quantity of sugar and butter, and it was still a bit heavy. Everyone liked the combination of flavors--prunes and hazelnuts with apples. Play with it according to your taste. Too bad there's not a wine suggestion from the Willamette Valley with this one.

I've made this twice, once with hazelnuts and once with almonds instead. It's terrific! It does come out sweeter than the usual crisp, because of the prunes. But it's a great way to eat prunes. And even with more apples than it calls for, it's a nice twist on apple crisps. Not my favorite crisp, but one of the best and with it's own distinct tast.

I just made this crisp, and I'm extremely disappointed with it. In general, I thought it was too sweet - and I have quite a high tolerance for sweet desserts! I don't think the prunes added much to the flavor except to make it overly cloying. There are much better apple crisp recipes on this site. Try the Apple and Cranberry Crisp with Pecan-Ginger Topping instead. It's too die for - the best crisp I've ever had.

My new favorite dessert. And it lends itself perfectly to a low fat alteration of substituting the butter with 1/4 c. of prune puree (soak pitted prunes in boiling water to rehydrate & then puree in food processor to the consistency of soft butter). Makes for a guilt-free & delicious dessert.

The topping is delicious! and if you happen to forget to put in the prunes it's still fabulous, and really easy to make. A winner.

YUM! Used walnuts instead of hazelnuts and omitted the prunes, but that was because of the guests to whom we served it. It was so good I'd have no reservations about varying it for the occasion.

I used walnuts instead of the hazelnuts - it was delicious - even though we didn't have any ice cream to go with it. Next time I will make sure I have some ice cream - can hardly wait.
