this was great and easy. we found that our ice cream maker was defunct, so before freezing, just gave it some extra time in the blender to aerate it, then when it was frozen, gave it another quickblender spin. it was delicious- my 4 year old loved it.

My 5 year old daughter has proclaimed this the best dessert ever, better than candy. It couldn't have been easier. I guessed on the timing of the simple syrup (no candy thermometer), used a bag of frozen raspberries, guessed on the amount of plums, used a hand mixer and voila! I agree wtih the previous reviewer; this is a beautiful pink/purple color, has a smooth texture and tastes wonderful. Some might find it a tad sweet. That's easy enough to deal with, just cut down on the syrup or change the ratio of plums to raspberries. Again, very easy. A great summertime treat. And what else are you going to do with the basketful of ripe plums from your neighbor's tree?

This sorbet is delicious, has wonderful texture, and is such a beautiful color. The recipe was simple and straightforward; we have a plum tree, and I used the windfall fruit for this recipe, so no need for perfect plums.
