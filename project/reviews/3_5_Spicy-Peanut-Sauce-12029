Wow was this salty! Even with reduced sodium soy sauce and natural peanut butter made of just peanuts. I am someone who loves salt on my food. I prefer a visible layer of salt on each bite of food. Seriously. But this was CRAZY salty. I think I know why. I'm very sensitive to sweetness in non-dessert food(I can't buy bread in the grocery store because it's always noticeably sweet - gross) so I cut the sugar back to one teaspoon. Without the sugar to balance all the salt from the soy sauce this was like liquidy salty peanut butter. Even having used full-fat coconut milk instead of water like others suggested. If you are sugar conscious and want to reduce the sugar, you will need to cut way back on the soy sauce too. I ended up adding some lemongrass and upping the ginger to brighten the flavor, which helped, but if I make this again, I'll use half the soy sauce.

this is probably the best spicy peanut sauce i've ever made, and i've tried at least half a dozen recipe before this. i find that the balance of flavors is nearly perfect -- while most recipes are a bit heavy on the peanut taste, no one particular flavor dominates this sauce. the only caveat i will note is that it's really not that spicy. i personally ended up using about a full teaspoon of red pepper flakes and, IMO, it was still only mildly spicy. but i like my food REALLY spicy. so i just ended up putting some sriracha in my lettuce wraps as well. :) also, i used probably 3 cloves of garlic vs one, but i still didn't really taste it. i didn't have any scallions, having used all of mine in the recipe i'll share below, but this sauce was still great and i can't wait to make it with either scallions or shallots next time. i used this sauce for thai lettuce wraps, which i prepared as follows: - 4 fileted chicken breasts, slow-cooked in the crock pot or oven with ginger, tamari, sesame oil, minced fresh garlic, and a bit of olive oil - a thai salad containing: 1 seedless cucumber, peeled, halved lengthwise, and thinly sliced on an angle 2 cups bean sprouts (which you can find bagged in the produce department of most grocery stores) 1 cup shredded carrots (which can also be found bagged in most produce departments) 3 scallions, sliced on an angle 12 fresh basil leaves, chopped 4 sprigs' worth of fresh mint leaves, chopped 1 tbsp sesame seeds 2 tsp sugar 1 tbsp white vinegar and then i wrapped it all up in chard leaves. NOM NOM!!! however, the salad is so outstandingly delicious, that this would be just as good without the chard. you could just as easily take the shredded chicken and put it atop a bed of the salad drizzled with sauce. YUMMO!

This is my once a week go to recipe for a good vegetarian meal. I use it over any vegetable stir fry and rice. It is an excellent sauce over boiled collard greens. I use Braggs Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce and fresh hot peppers whenever possible instead of dried red peppers. I use only peanut butter ground from fresh peanuts. Fantastic!

After trying at least 10 different peanut sauce recipes from different Thai cookbooks and other internet sources, this is our absolute favorite. I have been making this recipe since 1999 and still get wonderful comments from guests. The only thing I do differently is that I use shallot instead of scallions. Enjoy.

I am still not satisfied in my search for the ultimate peanut sauce. This was good, though I don't know that it needed the brown sugar. I followed the recipe exactly and was surprised that so many people complained about the addition of water. Without water (or some sort of liquid) it would've been like toothpaste... way too thick! I agree that coconut milk or chicken broth could be used as a thinning agent, but I always (almost always) try the recipe as written first before I modify. I used it as a sauce for a noodle dish with veggies and chicken and it worked nicely. The thicker version would be great as a dip or for chicken satay.

This recipe provides a great framework for a wonderful rich sauce. Adjust it to your liking. Double the recipe - it's wonderful on salads, veggies, protein as well as noodles. I use broth instead of water and amount depends on style of peanut butter used. A keeper!

I don't what I was thinking when I followed the recipe's instructions for 1 cup of water--that's way too much! The flavor was good, but if I make it again I will add water a little bit at a time until it's perfect, as I have in the past.

I rarely give a recipe a bad review, but the white vinegar ruins the flavor in this sauce and there is no fixing this after the fact. I am always trying new recipes for peanut sauce, and this was a serious disappointment. I agree with other reviewers: half the liquid, white wine as opposed to water, and a rice wine viengar would have produced a better result.

Hard to mess this up if you use good/authentic ingredients. I used Thai fish sauce (nam pla) instead of soy sauce. Definitely don't use a cup of water. I used HOT water, less than half a cup. You can always thin a final dish out, but it's hard to "thick it up". Remember, when anything calls for plain vinegar, you can always use lemon or lime juice. Tastes much better.

Rating: 4
I made this for a potluck. It was extremely well received. I have made a similar sauce but without 'cooking' ir. It is just blending all the ingredients very well using 'hot water' or my mom (she grew up with this dish) would use 'diluted hot tea'. I think the cooking does make all the ingredients blend better. The only suggestion is that start with half of the vinegar and add it if needed after tasting.

When I read the review that said "Help, can't stop licking spoon!" I knew I had the right recipe. I made it for a party to go with grilled chicken skewers that I'd brushed with a soy/fresh ginger mixture. The next day, my husband and I were fighting over the leftovers! I used Peter Pan peanut butter and didn't add the brown sugar. I also used Kikkoman Thai Style Chili Sauce (1 Tablespoon) instead of the chili flakes. That leant perfect heat and just the right sweetness without the sugar. It is best served at room temperature.

Superb. Searched this site only since I wanted to make a peanut sauce for the Asian turkey wraps (which I highly recommend). Number of raves persuaded me, including excellent suggestions for changes: Coconut milk is a great sub for water; rice vinegar vs. distilled white (if seasoned, decrease soy sauce). I also recommend using chili paste w/ garlic vs. flakes, 1 T or possibly more. Because I used seasoned rice vinegar, even 1 T of brown sugar was too much. Used remainder of coconut milk for rice.

I really liked this recipe. I used it as a sauce for a stir-fry type meal with two half chicken breast, one red bell pepper, one green pepper and some basmati rice. I also used fresh thai chilies instead of dry flakes which turned out well. (Beware of chilies! Wear gloves or avoid touching eyes for about a day!) Overall, it was very rich and filling. I'll certainly make it again, but I'll have to wait a few weeks.

This is oh-so-great over spaghetti and well-chilled. Tastes just like Cold Sesame Noodles from Chinese restaurants. I cut down the oil and the red pepper flakes by almost but not quite half. I liked the vinegar taste it had but some of my guests felt that it should have been cut down also.

I liked this, but it tastes very similar to the Thai peanut sauce you can get in the supermarket. I will make again, but probably add more peanut butter since the sauce wasn't as thick as I'd like.

Using other reviewers suggestions (substituted coconut milk, sesame oil, rice wine vinegar and a squeeze of fresh lime jce) plus used Splenda due to nutritional requirements. This was GREAT!! Served it over some Thai Dumplings I bought at Sam's Club, along with steamed spinach. Very very good. This recipe will be laminated before dusk.

Not sure where I went wrong. Followed the instructions without any substitutions or additions. Doesn't taste very peanut buttery or sweet (the way that I've had it at Thai restaurants) and the consistency seems really runny. Maybe it needs time for the flavors to meld? If not, I guess I'll add more peanut butter and brown sugar.

Rating: 3
Wow. Just... wow. I used coconut milk instead of water and skipped the brown sugar (I don't like a sweet peanut sauce.) I added the juice of a lime and a dribble of sesame oil. Also went with the chili-garlic paste -- we're all heat-mad in my house, and I used about two and a half tablespoons. This is not, however, one of THOSE reviews, as I know that even if I had adhered slavishly to the recipe as written it still would have been great. I doubled the recipe for the sauce and mixed in lots of sauteed beef strips, sauteed bell peppers and onions and green beans, and let the whole arrangement simmer for a bit so it became more like a curry than a sauce. Aded some chopped basil and cilantro at the lastt Served with rice. Divine.

I'd actually give it a 3.5. Made the recipe to the letter. My husband is a very discerning critic of peanut sauces and absolutely loved this one. Said it was the best he ever had. Served it with another dipping sauce (nam pla) and fresh shrimp rolls for a first course. Very nice

Very Nice flavor; perfect for my Thai stir-fry over rice. I did substitute rice vinegar for the apple and coconut milk for water just to make it a little more Thai oriented. Next time I would add more pepper flakes or a asian pepper paste just to kick it up a little. This recipe will go into my permenant collection.

Yummy. With a couple of changes and substitutions. Use sesame oil instead of vegetable, rice vinegar instead of the other, and coconut milk instead of water. Also, I skip the red pepper flakes since I have young children who don't care for food too spicy yet. It will still have some kick with a little extra garlic. After it is finished on the stove, let cool and then use an immersible blender to make the whole thing smooth and creamy. Dee-lish. Keeps well in the fridge, too. Made it for Trader Joe's frozen pot stickers and chow mein noodles tonight and will be making chicken and beef sate this weekend to go with it. Would also be tasty with a little fresh lime juice, but not too much so as to not overpower. Enjoy.

I thought this might be too vinegary, but that was not the case. This sauce is excellent! I added some cubed deep fried tofu and simmered it for 10 minutes (I added extra liquid to keep the consistancy right.) I served it with panfried chinese noodles and steamed broccoli. My dinner guests raved! I must say that I did not find it to be very spicy. If you want your mouth to burn, you'll need to add more chili.

Delicious. I, too, used sesame oil and rice vinegar. And, I dramatically increased the amount of heat by adding a finely minced fresh cayenne and quite a bit of Korean style coarsely ground red pepper. Without, I would hardly categorize this as spicy. Oddly, I had to add salt to keep it from tasting like, well, a big glob of peanut butter. Maybe it was the brand of PB I used. Other than needing more heat and a pinch of salt, it was right on the money. I thinned it a bit and tossed it with noodles and some stir-fried chicken and bell peppers. I plan to use what's left to baste some skewers.

This peanut sauce was wonderful! I used a bit extra rice vinegar to make it thinner, used half water and half cocunut milk for liquid, and added just a touch of sambal to give it an extra bite. Don't look any further - this is delicious!

This sauce is fantastic! It only took about 20 minutes to prepare. I substitutes the green onions with white, added sesame oil, more than quadrupled the chili peppers (and threw them in with the oil in the beginning,) used rice wine vinegar instead of white and slightly decreased the soy sauce. I threw it over rice noodles and topped it with pan-fried tofu and veggies. Suprisingly light meal. Yum!

Omit the brown sugar or significantly reduce it to 1 tsp. This sauce was far too sweet and not savory enough.

This is the best peanut sauce ever. It definitely doesn't take like a big glob of peanut butter. It is excellent. The only problem was that it was a bit too salty. I recommend starting with about half the amount of soy sauce and adding more to taste. I ended up having to add more of the other ingredients to reduce the salty taste. After doing so, it was excellent.

Wow! This is a great one! Very easy to tweak to your own taste. I added a bit more peanut butter, used sesame oil and rice vinegar instead and added a little fresh lime juice for some higher notes. I thinned a couple of Tbls. with some veg. oil and lime juice to dress an oriental salad of julienned pea pods, jicama, red/green cabbage, red bell pepper, sliced gr. onion, blanched bean sprouts and a bit of mesclun. Over top I put slices of cold, baked chicken breast marinated in minced garlic, minced ginger and olive oil. I served the peanut sauce on the side to spoon over. It made a deliciuos light supper with loads of flavor!

replace vegetable oil with sesame oil, replace water with coconut milk , replace white vinegar with rice vinegar, use chili-garlic sauce instead of or in addition to pepper flakes, and this is a stellar recipe. you can also use dark sweet or seasoned soy sauce and cut back on the brown sugar. i use this on fish filets with lots of grilled onions.

Wow!! This was fantastic! I did alter the recipe a little though- used toasted sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, rice vinegar instead of regular, and added an extra tablespoon of brown sugar. I also used chunky peanut butter and liked finding little bits of peanut in the sauce (but that's just personal preference). It was great on Chinese noodles with some grilled chicken and snow pea pods.

HELLO!! Is this good or what? This is exactly what I've been looking for in a peanut sauce. Doubting son thought it delicious. Easy! Quick! And didn't taste like a spoonful of peanut butter! I did use peanut oil instead of vegetable, drizzled toasted sesame oil on the cooked noodles to prevent them from sticking, & rice vinegar instead of the other. Nummy!

Yippee! The perfect peanut sauce! I used low fat peanut butter to cut fat and doubled the red pepper flakes (we like heat). I also didn't have scallions on hand, and added a small handful of sauteed shallots. Even with the reduced fat peanut butter, STILL it was delicious. My family was putting the sauce on everything on their plates...I was glad I hid a small container of it in the back of the fridge LOL. I will definitely be making this again and again.

Er where do I start? First that I ate four HUGE spoons of this right after I made it?? It is a really good easy peanut sauce :) Next time I will put more heat into it. I used it to marniade pork chops before I grilled them. That is all the recipe made I ate the rest :)
