I tried this recipe Friday night. My husband is intolerant to wheat so I made a gluten free loaf of bread for the base of this recipe. I also subbed splenda for half of the sugar. This recipe was enjoyed by all!

This was really delicious. I'm not a big bread pudding fan, but enjoyed this dish a lot - as did everyone else who tried it. The only change I made was to use challah instead of white bread. Also, I didn't skip the water bath, and I didn't have a problem with the custard breaking, like some other reviewers did. I'd definitely make this again.

I loved it. looked beautiful and had great taste. I added one more egg and used whole milk instead. made it nice and thick. i also used golden rasins.

I also had trouble with the custard breaking up, regardless the taste was delicious! I used skim milk and Splenda substitute for the sugar. I also added nutmeg, allspice and cloves to the apples as they were cooking. I will definitely be making this again!

Please advise: I followed the recipe faithfully... but the custard "broke up". (It resembled rice pudding). It was easy, healthy, and tasty, and I would like try it again someday. Any tips?

This is a phenomenal dessert especially for the health conscious. I used super healthy and hearty whole wheat & grain bread and very little brown sugar. It turned out beautiful and delicious. Everyone raved--health conscious or not. Delicious!

This set up beautifully and made for a delightful presentation, but it tasted bland, almost like apple-flavored paste, even though I used cinnamon raisin bread and added liberal amounts of additional cinnamon. I served it with Calvados-whipped cream, and that was the saving grace. Hopefully some crystallized ginger and maybe some maple syrup will make the leftovers taste better.

Well, it's probably not fair for me to rate this recipe b/c of how I altered it but I think that the story that goes with it is worth sharing. I baked the apple bundt cake that's on this site. As I was taking my beautiful cake out of the oven, it slipped from hands and landed upside-down on the oven rack! The cake popped out of the pan, fell apart... disaster. I didn't want to waste the cake so I crumbled it into pieces, made the custard from this recipe (doubled it), and converted my damaged cake to "bread" pudding. From disaster came something that was quite delicious. Total serendipity.

Made this tonight, pretty much doubled it. I used day old hearty rolls and cut them (and the apples) into bite size chunks and tossed it all together in a 13x9 dish. Added extra cinnamon and pecans. Everyone loved it. Skipped the water bath and baked for nearly an hour.

I forgot to add one thing - used dried cranberries instead of raisins - a great addition.

Rating: 3
Made this for a party - increased the amounts by 50% and the four of us ate it all! The only changes I made were to use whole wheat bread and brown sugar. I also used less sugar to make it less sweet, and browned it under the broiler to make it crisper. Also made some very soft whipped cream with just a bit of orange zest to drizzle over it. Raves all around.

This was an excempltinally delisous and easy recipe. I tried it on my hubby last evening and he thought it one of the best tha he has ever tasted. I used only 1 tablespoon sugar when I sauted the apples and than 1 mor tablespoon + artificial sweetener for the remainder and he never could tell the difference. There was no after taste or anything that would tell on me.LOL! I guess one could use egg subustute but I think the whole eggs are part of the taste. I don't use substutes any more than I have to, I would use egg whites before using commercial products.

This recipe is wonderful! I used homemade bread and dried cranberries-- yum! There was not a bite left by the end of the night!

This was a delicious low-calorie substitute for typical heavy bread pudding. I didn't even miss a whiskey/buttery sauce it usually comes with. I cubed the bread at the other reviewer's suggestion. I could see maybe using a third slice of bread, because it seemed like there was a lot of the egg/milk mixture, but the whole thing firmed up just fine, so maybe it's perfect as is. and i used splenda to make it more diabetic-friendly for the hubby. you really can't beat a bread pudding that clocks in at around 250 calories (oh yeah, used skim milk) per quarter of a pie plate!

Rating: 3
I really liked the lightness of this recipe--my previous venture into apple bread pudding with another recipe was too buttery-greasy. I used an old bread loaf, with crust. Next time I will cube the bread and mix it in, rather than layering: top layer was too dry. Since I used Fuji apples, I only used 3 tbs. of sugar in egg-milk mixture--and that was just perfect. To upgrade it to a dessert for company, I'll serve it with whipped cream.

Like others, I used cinnamon raisin bread in place of the white bread . . . yum! Served it warm, sprinkled with confectioners sugar and topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it!

This is a delicious (and simple as well as healthy) apple bread pudding. All my friends have loved it. Before baking, I top it with grated orange rind -- it adds a nice citrusy flavour. I also substitute cinnamon raisin bread in place of the white bread. Tasty!

This will sound a bit strange, but as i only had a round pie dishes, i actually used cranberry raisin bagels for one batch and blueberry for another. (we all know how a fresh bagel gets stale fast!) turned out great! also added a bit more spices as recommended by previous reviewers. simple, good, and warming. i wonder how chocolate chip bagels would do?

Very easy. Impressive results for the minimum effort required to make this. I followed below reviewer's advice and used the Pepperidge Farm Toasting Bread. I was very happy with it.

I used Pepperidge Farm Toasting bread, and it came out beautifully. The Toasting bread is slightly more dense and soaked up the liquid well. My husband gave rave reviews and this is definitely going to be a repeat in our house!

A wonderfully light and fluffy dessert! Substituted "Egg Beaters" and "Equal" to make it lighter and topped it with light whipped cream. Also used dried cranberries instead of raisins.

Okay, substituted wheat bread for white, pears and bananas for apples and it was delicious. Hubby and I gobbled it up and it got the vote for another try.

This recipe is great...This time, I tweeked it and used a pumpkin yeast bread (instead of white bread) and dried sweetened cranberries (instead of raisins). I used slightly less sugar (about 20%) and used Macintosh apples. Also, I used more cinnamon and nutmeg as well. It was fabulous! "Comfort" food without too much guilt.

Rating: 2
My hungry dog gobbled up this dish as it was sitting on the kitchen counter absorbing the milk, but I made it again a few nights later just because of all the rave reviews. Anyway, I didn't have a big enough roasting pan, so I just baked the pudding as-is, so that may have contributed to its needing much more than 40 minutes baking time and a persistent sogginess afterwards. I keep forgetting I don't like egg-y desserts -- my fault, not Epicurious'.

I love this dessert, and it really is healthy too! I substituted Land o Lakes Fat Free Half and Half for the milk, and dried blueberries and cherries for the raisins. It was a hit!

Wow I finally get to review a recipe! I liked this recipe. I forgot to add the currents but it tasted just fine. I added more cinnamon and nutmeg than required, I also used low calorie bread. I served this pudding warm with vanilla frozen yogurt---yummy! For all you weight watcher people 1/6th of the pudding is 4 points.

This was excellent. Substitued skim milk, dark maple syrup for 6 tablespoons of the sugar, calvados for the vanilla, eliminated the cinnamon and added chopped crystallized ginger.

Another great bread pudding recipe.I swear I could live off of the stuff. I used Granny Smith apples & golden raisins.Gastrogasmic!!

I like this recipe because it is easy and taste good. The recipe called for peeled apples. I found that leaving the apple peels on gives the apple wedges better textures.

I get requests to make this all the time - definitely an easy and pleasing dessert. I use vanilla-flavored soy milk instead of regular milk and also French or Pioneer bread, which provides a wonderful texture. The freshly whipped cream on top is definitely a must!

I thought this was a good one. It was easy to make and everyone probably already has all the ingredients for this recipe in their kitchen already.

mine wasn't good. followed recipe exactly. apples not soft. custard not smooth. watery on bottom. what went wrong?

Rating: 3
A very good dessert for those who don't want to overindulge. I used cinnamon raisin bread (8 slices) and a few currants sprinkled on top. I sliced the apples pretty thinly and it came out just right. I think I liked the texture better after it was cooled; right out of the oven it's beautiful and souffle-like, but at room temperature (or the next day) it's a little denser and richer.

Rating: 3
I really liked this recipe! it was easy, light and very comforting! I did think that the flavor was just a little bland, though. When I warmed up the oeftovers the next day, I topped the dessert with just a little orange marmalade and that really gave it the little extra that it needed. The next time I make this, I am going to sprinkle a little chopped crystalized ginger on the apple layer and drizzle with a bit of orange marmalade.

I have made this several times, and it always turns out delicious. I like it with a little more bread, and I leave out the raisins.

I had some raspberries and used them instead of the raisins. My guests swore they had gone to heaven.

Made this two ways, both very good. First I followed the recipe with apples sliced very thin, not in the recommended 1/2inch wedges. The second time I omitted the apples and raisins and in their place added melted brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and used skim milk. Next time will use apples and lowfat milk but keep the brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. All combinations were tasty.

Rating: 3
Delcious and easy to prepare. I followed the suggesting of using cinnamon raisin bread (6 pieces total) and left out the additional raisins. Good choice. The type of apples used makes a difference - I used Golden Spy (Northern Spy x Golden Delicious - my favorite for pies) and Melrose (an antique baking apple that is slightly firm). The difference in apple texture was evident, but did not detract from the dish at all. I also used skim milk (Hood Smart Choice) and the pudding set up fine.

Rating: 3
I made this two nights in a row. The first time I used dried cranberries for the raisins (not a fan or raisins) and brown sugar instead of white. Very good results and no problems with custard setting. The second night I left the dried fruit out, and only used the 2 T brown sugar to saute the apples (forgot to add more to the custard). Served with caramel sauce and it was fabulous!

Rating: 3
I think I liked the pudding part better than the apples which never got soft enough to mesh with very soft pudding. Maybe I shouln't have used Fuji apples. I thik next time I will use more bread, a little less apple, and cut the apple into smaller pieces.

Recipe as is has the blahs, BUT the inspiration is good and suggested the following changes/additions: fresh lemon juice and turbinado and/or brown sugar for the apples; grated lemon rind and more cinnanmon; cubed raisin bread, and more of it, as the base.

Well, my guest left with my copy of the recipe. Good sign. I used cinnamon bread and more of it than the recipe specified. It was definitely yummy but not as rich as the real stuff. Probably since I used skim milk since that was all that was in the house. It was still tasty.

Rating: 3
The pudding needed extra cooking time and removal from steam bath after full baking time recommended. Otherwise, quite yummy. The cupboards were bare of raisans so the chopped pecans were a great substitute. My husband didn't notice the pear I slipped in (he doesn't like pears) But, he loved this pudding as it reminded him of his childhood in England. I used granny smith and an Empire Red apple with the pear. Would like to try it with demerara sugar. Texas toast was thick enough to accomodate but I'd be generous with the amount of bread you use.

This is my new favorite dessert recipe. It looks appetizing and tastes great. I also tried it using pears and was delightfully surprised at how well it turned out - the pears needed less cooking than the apples.

THIS APPLE-BREAD PUDDING RECIPE IS QUITE DELICIOUS AND REMINDS ME OF THE PUDDING MY ENGLISH GRANDMOTHER WOULD MAKE. BUT WHERE DO YOU FIND BREAD THIS BIG ?.. I HAD TO ADD EXTRA SLICES (8 IN TOTAL) TO MAKE IT WORK. I ALSO ADDED A LOT MORE RAISINS THAN THE RECIPE CALLS FOR (GOLDEN RAISINS ARE GREAT!).. WHEN IT WAS DONE I TOPPED IT OFF WITH A GENEROUS HELPING OF WARM CUSTARD. THE LEFTOVERS WERE GOBBLED UP BY MY HUSBAND AND I THE NEXT DAY!..

I used a hard crusty baguette instead of white bread. And because my family has a sweet tooth, I used what we call here in the Philippines as "muscovado" sugar, a kind of concentrated brown sugar. Also put in a whole lot of raisins. Everything worked out fine.

Quick & easy.Items usually on hand. I baked it in a 9x9 square pan and put 1/2 slices of bread along the sides, worked good. Agree with reader that firmer bread should be used, (challah would be good) mine was a little mushy so I removed it from the pan of water and baked an additional 15 minutes or so, Puffed up nice, but center still not done.Good flavor though. Worth trying again with some alterations.

Very easy to put together, and what a flavor! I might suggest using day-old French bread for the sandwich bread, though; I think it would hold up better during the cooking process. The consistency when using sandwich bread is a little spongy.
