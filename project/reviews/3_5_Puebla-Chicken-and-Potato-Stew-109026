Made this dish yesterday and we loved it. I only used 2 tsp. of the chipotle and it was perfect for us. I also added some corn and black beans.

I have made this numerous times and will continue to because it is so delicious and satisfying. For personal preference I use 3 cans of chicken broth rather than water for more flavor, stewed tomatoes instead of whole canned tomatoes for a richer taste. I also substitute keibasa for chorizo and I use baby red potatoes cut in quarters. I believe the preparation directions are unnecessarily complicated and use too many pans and dishes. I saute the (boned, skinned)chicken, chopped half onion and sausage together in a large pot and then set aside on a plate to cool. In the same pot saute the onion, garlic, oregano, chipotles and stewed tomatoes. Transfer all in batches to the blender and return to pot. Shred cooled chicken and add with sausage and onions to pot. Add chicken broth and red potatoes and bring to boil. Return to simmer until potates are cooked thru. I cut the cheese into bite sized pieces. You might want to try panela cheese. Very similar to queso fresco but has a wonderfully smooth texture and taste....such a pleasant surprise after it has been added to the bowl of hot stew and is just partially melted. Just thinking about it makes me hungry !

This is a great dish! I used leftover chicken, diced, chicken stock to thin the soup, and I added frozen corn at the end. I also added 1 teaspoon cumin, and 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika for more depth of flavor.

Delicious! I made only one change...I used only ONE tsp of the chipotles. I have a lot of experience with these peppers and was alarmed by the recipe's recommendation of 4 tsp. 1 tsp was perfect; spicy and smoky but not painful. I will definitely make this again.

I thought that this was a excellent dish. At the suggestion of others, I only added a cup of broth at a time to lossen the stew without making it too soupy. I also used fresh chorizo and corn which added a sweetness to the dish which was great with the heat of the pepper. Delicious! Also, the corn chips at the end adds a great crunch.

I doubled this recipe - it was great. I did add quite a bit more chipotles than called for, and also added a bit more Mexican oregano. Yum.

Very tasty, I'll definitely make it again with a few variations. 1- less peppers! This way way too hot. 2- more garlic. 3- I would have liked this a little thicker, I may have used too much broth. I definitely recommend serving it with coriander, lime and sliced avocado. It compliments it so well. Tortilla chips also made this fun, and helped tame the spice. I do suggest you get salt-free (or low salt) tortilla chips if you can. Loads of sodium is the last think your mouth wants when it's all spiced up. I didn't have queso fresco, but I did try it with a dollop of sour cream which was really nice to dip into.

A great meal for spicy-food lovers. I used a rotisserie chicken as well, and substituted goat cheese for the queso fresco, which was great. I also cut down on the number of potatoes and added a can of corn instead. I found that 2 cups of broth (in the last step) wasn't enough - i almost doubled that. Enjoy!

Very good, quick. I agree about directions being overly complicated. I didn't have chorizo so used diced tasso instead.

Holy Cow that was HOT! This is one of those recipes that on first taste you're not "quite" sure you like but by the time you are on your thirds your thinking this is awesome! Avacodo and lime make it sparkle. I will definately make this again :)

Great for those who like some heat in their seasonings. I added a bit of cilantro and upped the chipotles to 5 teaspoons. I also used half chicken broth and half water in the initial step.

Rating: 4
To simplify I: 1)cooked the chicken in 3-1/3 cups of water the night before so I could remove the fat layer the next day; 2)used all of the broth produced (minus the fat) for the stew (no dividing it at the end); 3)sauted and then mashed the chopped garlic, onion, tomatoes, chipotles, and oregano (no blender); 4)added the veggies and the chicken to the broth when the potatoes were almost soft; 5)simmered it all about 15 minutes. It was EXCELLENT, and probably richer than the writer intended, but a lot easier!!!

I use Epicurious all the time and have never rated a recipe before. this dish is amazing! If there were more than a four fork rating I would have given it a ten! Used chicken stock instead of water, cotija cheese and diced cilantro and onions for a garnish. This recipe is a keeper and plan to work it into my monthly rotation. Dinner was fantastic tonight and I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow!

This dish was super great

Rating: 4
Absolutely great! Yes, there are alot of pans. I had never thought of pan roasting unpeeled garlic cloves & was happily surprised. I will do that more often. I tried to follow the recipe exactly, but added 4 scraped chilis from the can without measuring & it was hotter than I expected. A little spicey for my 89 year old mother. With the avacado, queso fresca, tortillas & a squeeze of lime per comments, It looked spectacular. I served the tiny amount left over with a dollop of sour cream and that was delicious. Next time will double the recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. It was even better as leftovers. I wasn't able to find the Spanish style chorizo so am looking forward to trying it again with the correct ingredient! I'm also going to try it with some of my frozen turkey leftover from Thanksgiving!

To Pacifica: Spanish is Spanish style not Mexican as a result the carniceria did not have a clue.

Excellent. Added a LOT of New Mexico Green Chiles (Bueno) and a bit of bacon. Doubling the recipe somehow made enough for twenty five. Good for winter.

Liked the receipe, but what the heck is "dried Spanish chorizo?" The guy at my local carnicerria didn't have a clue.

Rating: 3
I made it using boneless, skinless chicken breast (poached in canned broth) and mexican (uncured) chorizo, which is admittedly quite different from the Spanish sausage. Also doubled the amount of garlic and chipotles in adobo. The first day, it was so-so, but the second day it was fantastic. Really benefits from a night in the fridge and reheating.

My parents have several farm workers from Mexico for dinner every Friday night for fellowship and language practice (for both my parents Spanish and our guests English). When I am there I make this dish for our guests and not only do they compliment the dish but have seconds (even thirds). It is much spicier with chorizo but can be made with regular Italian sausage in a pinch with equally enjoyable results.

My family loves this: my son is asking to have it for his birthday meal. I'll have to make it again!

Because this dish comes together so quickly, I didn't find the preparation daunting at all. It just takes a little multitasking - completely worth it, because it's delicious. A deep, wide frying pan is quite useful.

My wife has eaten this for 2 days now - it keeps very well, needless to say, and tastes great, even more needless to say. I agree with many of the reviewers: simplify simplify simplify. I rewrote the recipe so that it can be done using 2 dishes; otherwise, I can see the prep being a little insane...

I would loved to give this 4 forks but I am not sure there is "A dish beyond compare". This one comes close on a snowy west Texas February night. We loved it. Terrific Mexican food. Better than any Mexican eatery we have around here. Though, to be fair, I don't recall ordering any stew at a Mexican eatery.

Rating: 3
I loved making this dish, even though it required quite a few different things going on at once. The ingredients are simple but the next time I make it, I may try to simplify the process - too many dirty pans! Queso fresco and tortillas really tied it together nicely; next time I may also try to add lime and corn to jazz it up a bit more.

Rating: 3
The prep seemed overly complicated so I streamlined.First I browned the thighs in 2 T of oil over med-high heat(about 5 minutes per side.)Remove. Next I sauteed the onion(chopped) and garlic (minced)for a few minutes. Deglaze,dislodge flavorful chucks stuck to pan, with 2 cups of chicken broth and a wooden spoon. Return chicken to the pan and add the remaining ingredients except the potatoes and sausage. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes.Add the potatoes and sausage and cook for another 15 minutes. I stirred in 2 cups of thawed frozen corn just before serving. Garnished with fresh cilantro and lime wedges.

I made this dish last night, and although it was quite a bit of work for a weekday, I was pleased with the result. I added my own spices here and there to jazz up the recipe along the way, but overall thought it was a great (and pretty healthy) alternative to our weekly jaunt a cheap mexican eatery. The avocado and cheese (I used ricotta salata) helped the flavor, and the visual appeal, and the corn tortillas add that earthy flavor that makes food like this so appealing. Will make it again, but maybe streamline the process somehow.

After reading what some previous reviewers had to say, I doubled the amount of poblanos called for. This stew was good, not quite hot enough, but the flavor was rather one-dimensional. Next time I will triple the amount of poblanos and boil the chicken with spices. I will also add some cilantro and maybe some red and yellow peppers.

Very good & comforting stew. Used more garlic & chipotles. Will add more chipotles next time, as it will was not hot enough. Served w/corn tortillas, feta, cilantro & lime.

Made this for my Belizean husband a few weeks ago and you should have see his face when he had his first bite! Cheek splitting smile and his eyes popped open in a big WOW. We LOVE this stew and I've made it several times since. He's gotta have hot,spicy food (puts Belize's own Marie Sharpe's Fiery Hot Habenaro sauce on EVERYTHING) so we eat meals like this ALOT. This flavor packed recipe is one of our absolute favorites. We up the garlic, use 1 and a half lbs of ground chorizo(grease drained),and triple the amount of chipotle chilies in the stew, giving it enough heat that my husband doesn't put his hot sauce in it. Makes FABULOUS tacos!Avocados and queso fresco are the perfect compliment. A definite must try!

Even though I followed the directions I found this dish utterly boring. It was completely mono-flavoured with zero depth. I added some lime juice in desparation, but it still was a complete loser. I would never make this again. Gourmet has an earlier recipe for a Mexican Chicken stew that includes hominy that is far superior.

Outstanding!! Will definitely make again.

This stew is incredibly good! I have made it almost every week since the recipe came out. I use spicy pork chorizo and about 4 chipolte chiles with a tablespoon of adobe sauce. I have used all kinds of chicken, but find that boneless chicken breasts work well, and make a less fatty broth. I serve it with some crunchy tortilla chips, avocado slices and a sprinkle of feta cheese on top (haven't been able to find queso fresca). A satisfying and spicy one-dish dinner.

Terrific recipe; great depth and complexity of flavor, and that flavor continues to develop overnight. We loved it.

We love this recipe. The chipotles add such a wonderful depth of flavor and just enough heat to keep it interesting. If there were 1/2 forks I'd give it 3 1/2, but just can't quite give it four.

Fantastic recipie. I will be making a large batch of this for a ski trip. It's the pefrect thing to warm you up on a cold day. The spice is just the right balance of heat and flavor.

This is a keeper. My picky husband, worried that he wouldn't like the stew, finished his bowl and asked for seconds. To save a little time, I cooked the chicken the night before and finished the recipe the next day. I wasn't able to get to the Mexican store, so I had to use about 1/2 link (4oz) of La Preferida Mild Chorizo which ended up being a good amount. For heat, I used one chipotle chile which I rinsed of seeds. I then added a couple of teaspoons of adobo. The heat intensity was hot enough for my hubby and not too hot for the more mild me. Because I was running ahead of schedule, I added about 3 cups of broth to the chorizo-chicken-potato mixture and allowed to simmer for about hour. I served with pita rounds brushed with a mixture of olive oil, dried cilantro, southwestern spice mixture, salt and pepper, and baked for 10 minutes.

I used four chicken breasts and doubled the rest of the recipe. Served with warm corn tortillas, avocado and the queso fresco, this is just a perfect recipe. My husband LOVED it, but the kids thought it was too spicy so we're going to add one chipotle and then serve adobo on the side for those that want it hotter.

Rating: 4
I accidently used 4 large chipotle chilis rather than 4 tsps and the spice was unbearable for some however the flavor was DELICIOUS! I know that had I used less spice it would have been perfect. I will definately make again and most likely use even less than the 4 tsps called for.

Good, not great. I will make again but will use a whole chicken instead of thighs.

Rating: 4
A definite keeper! I did find that there was a huge difference in the level of spiciness from the nite I made it to the leftovers the next day. The next day it was much more mild, my guess being that the potatos absorbed some of the spice. Only changes were that I cooked the chicken a little longer, would definitely consider chicken breasts for it and also cooked the onion and garlic in a wee bit of olive oil. I also kept back about 1/3 of the onions to add back in after the puree. Was yummy

Rating: 3
Thought this was a delicious soup. However, I would change a couple of things next time around -maybe use chicken breasts (just b/c we prefer that type of meat) and use 3 tsp of the chipolte b/c it was just a tad too hot for us (not unbearable, though).

Rating: 4
This was great! Ok I made some changes. After reading the reviews I researched Tinga and found that it is a pretty simple recipe, basics are here, but usually served over rice: I skipped the potatoes, scraped seeds from the chipotles (used 3 of them) added 2 hefty teaspoons of the adobo too. Used a cut up fryer. Biggest pain was to shred the darn chicken, but my cats love that part. I also cooked it longer after adding the shredded chicken back in. Finally I served it over a bed of rice in each bowl, with good quality shredded cheese (nothing even similar to the cheese called for could be found) and everyone loved it! My daughter went back for 3rds and took some with her for school the next day! No one but me would eat the avocado, but I loved avocado in this dish and would state they are an essential part. Really, this one is a recipe worth all the effort of making.

A good, spicy dish. Be careful with the chipotles and add more salt. A couple of cooling side dishes work well, such as guacamole and maybe some equatorial fruits.

Most all liked it but I added a bit of extra peppers since we like a bit more bite. We also thought more salt was needed - but using salted chips helped too. I actually made it again and doubled it for guests. It was good!

Scrape the seeds and veins out of the chipotle's if you like the flavor but can't handle the spice. Also, I garnished like a tortilla soup (avocado, cilantro, lime, onions, chees) and it made a nice balance of flavors.

Excellent recipe! Great choice for a cold January night - very filling, and early-season Haas avocados are beginning to appear in produce sections locally - great accompaniment. Only change I made was to add a little vegetable oil to skillet when browning onion and garlic - I liked the mellow flavor from both as they carmelized a bit in the oil - preferable to the "scorched" flavor from a dry skillet. Note to cooks in the Northeast: Stop and Shop regularly stocks the queso blanco (dairy section), chorizo, and poblanos in adobo.

Rating: 4
Followed recipe exactly, adding a bit more salt at the end. When I served it to my husband, who's from Mexico, he took seconds and said, "If you made this, you can make tinga." I informed him that it WAS tinga. Very authentic, and delicious. The amount of time given for a recipe is, I think, estimated from after all the ingredients are measured and prepared,i.e. the onion already quartered, the chicken out of the package, the tomatoes out of the can, the chipotles and chorizo already chopped, etc.

Served this tonight and it is EXCELLENT!!! Did make some changes, though. Cooked up the chicken and de-boned it last night. Refrigerated it overnight so that I could peel off and discard the fat layer on top of the broth. Didn't use a blender, just used a potato masher on all but the chicken and potatoes, and the texture was good. Fried a mild Italian sausage (casing removed) instead of chorizo. Used a can of no-salt added tomatoes and did not have to add any extra salt. Felt that 4 tsp. of chipotle chilies was excessive, so subbed 1/2 of that amount with 1 tsp. mild green chili and 1 tsp. hot green chili peppers (both canned). There was plenty of heat for us!!! Do try it--it is GOOD!!! (P.S. My chicken thighs did not cook in the stated time--took more like 30 minutes. Even though I had prepped the chicky last night, it still took about 1 hr. in the kitchen tonight. How come most recipe writers underestimate the amount of time a recipe really takes? Have they got 2 cooks in the kitchen, or have they never made it??? Food for thought. Thanks for letting me vent.)

Just a few points: If the chorizo is pre-cooked, 2 mins. is OK. If fresh, brown it which should take at least 20 min. In the last step, increase the time to simmer the entire assembled dish to at least 40 min. This will help develope the overall flavor. I used goat cheese and it worked, but I'm sure the queso fresco (fresh cheese?)is good, if I could find it. If you're a WW Point person, I calculated 11 pts/serving.

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. Instead of simply offering avocado slices I made a simple guacamole with shallots, avocado, some chipotle, cilantro and meyer lemon. Overall, it was fantastic! I will definitely make this again.

Took a bit of time, but was worth it. Great dish for winter -- filling and economical. You might want to poach the chicken a day in advance to make sure it cools down completely. It might be bit too "tame" -- next time, I will probably add more chipotle chilies. The leftover chicken broth is an added plus, and can be easily used in the future.

Made a double batch. Did not measure the chipotle and would say I might have used a little over 3 tb. It came out "hot" but everyone loved it! Going to try rice next time instead of potato and tone down the chipotle. Found the spanish chorizo.

Everybody in the family loved it. Had to make it low fat, kid friendly so... chared a bell pepper to replaced the chiplote and used a chicken chorizo (mild) insted of the regular one. I know it is probably better if you follow the original recipe but it was a deliciuos even with this cuts.

A very great and easy recipe. I did not change anything. I did not have the queso fresco so used sour cream instead which added a perfect creaminess.
