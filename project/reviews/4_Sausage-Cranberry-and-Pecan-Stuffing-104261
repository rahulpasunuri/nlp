This stuffing is amazing and relatively easy to make....like all stuffing, it takes some chopping and assembly, but well worth it! I made as directed but added an extra apple; I felt that one wasn't going to be enough, and used sweet (vidalia) onion to add some sweetness to counter the tartness. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing! It was very well received by all my Christmas guests. Yum.

This recipe is truly amazing. The flavors will not let you down. I cut the sausage to 1 lb as well (just because that was what I purchased) and it works out great. I do, however, use the Jimmy Dean Sage sausage and it is amazing. I make this the day before and leave out the pecans until I bake it. Truly, the best stuffing recipe I have ever made. This is our third year using it. I also use it with a crown pork roast on New Years Eve, it is beautiful stuffed in the middle of the crown roast. Enjoy!

I have made this several times over the years and it is always a great hit! The combination of sausage, apples, cranberries and pecans gives this a hearty, flavorful, harvesty flavor. Like others, I use 2 apples. I also increase the dried cranberries to 1 1/2 cups, and double the sage. The amount of broth depends on the bread, but I start with 2 cups, then add more if needed at 30 mins when removing the foil. I want to try it one time with diced country ham instead of sausage. Seems like that would go well with the apples, pecans & cranberries.

Awesome just the way it was. Nothing needing to be added or taken out. Thank you !

I tested this recipe for our Thanksgiving menu last week. Instead of using white bread, I used cornbread and instead of dried cranberries, I used Craisins, it was wonderful. My husband and all 5 children loved it. Its even better stuffed into the turkey!!!

Wow! This was so good! I made it a few years ago when we were stationed up in NY. My parents came, and we all couldn't get enough of it! It was even better the next day! Mmmm... I made it the next year too and plan on making it again this year! Yum!

I took the advice to make it moist and added too much broth. I also used italian chicken sausage which had not fat - so a bad choice. I also did not think the flavors had the wow factor - they kind of were just there and did not blend. But it could have been me!

This a stuffing I make every year for Thanksgiving. I double the apple but do not change anything else.

This will be my 7th year making this stuffing with the Roast Turkey with Porcini Mushroom Recipe. I always substitute herbed chicken sausages with extra olive oil and butter for flavoring and Michigan dried cherries for a little authentic flavor! It ALWAYS receives rave reviews and I can never seem to make enough of it.

2006 is our 4th or 5th year using this unusual and strong stuffing. A good seeded rye bread one year was fun. 2 apples always. And 2 cups of fresh Cranberries helps a lot. Lots of turkey stock instead of chicken broth is a sublte shift. This year we used medium Italian sausage. We seasoned the whole enchilada with about 2 Tbs fennel seed. It was 4/5ths gone this year on Thursday.

I make this one every year...and what a treat. Minor modifications are that I deglaze the pan with some sherry wine after sausage, celery, apple, etc. cook. I always make this a day ahead, but add an extra cup of milk and an extra cup of chicken stock to keep it moist.

I've made my stuffing similar to this for years and always get rave reviews. I use good sour dough and toss the bread with Olive Oil & seasoning prior to toasting (like making croutons, but less seasoning). Also, I haven't used the apple, but I do use a spicy Sausage which adds a great kick to it.

I made this with veggie sausage and vegetable stock to suit my vegetarian Thanksgiving, and it was great! It seemed very dry before baking and I had to nearly triple the amount of stock to deliver it sufficiently moist. On another occasion I substituted dried cherries for cranberries and that was pretty smashing as well. I heard later that most of my guests didn't know they'd had meat-free stuffing, and I'll certainly make this again.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and it was unbelievable!! Living in Texas we usually make a cornbread stuffing, but I thought this would be a nice change. I will make this recipe for many years to come!! I too reduced the sausage to 1 pound and added an additional 1/2 cup of chicken broth.

This recipe falls under the okay category. Firstly, I would use less bread. I think it calls for too much. If I ever made it again, I would use breakfast sausage. I would also add more seasoning. To me, it was a bit plain. Also, even with the 2 1/2 cups of chicken broth, it was still too dry.

This was delicious, but I think it would be even better with Italian sausage rather than plain pork sausage (I, too, used Jimmy Dean sausage).

I made this dish for my daughter's Thanksgiving feast at school and the kids gobbled it up. I used one tube (1 lb) of the Jimmy Dean sage sausage and four patties (approximately 8 oz) of the Farmer John pork sausage. Per the suggestion of a previous reviewer, I added a red-skinned apple for color. I also included fresh thyme and rosemary in addition to the sage and an extra 1/2 c of broth because I was worried it might get too dry. The stuffing was so flavorful and delicious that I'll be making more for our family Thanksgving dinner tomorrow. Even though our family's not big on stuffing, I think they'll enjoy this one.

We stuffed a turkey it, and it was nonpareil. We left out the stock because the turkey provided the moisture. We overlooked the pecans by mistake. And, instead of plain sausage we used chorizo to make it a little bite. Still, makeshift though it was, it was terrific.

Loved this! What great flavors. I added more broth because it seemed dry before I baked it. Also, I used Jimmy Dean Regular sausage, and used just 1 tube (less 2 patties for ME!). That was sufficient sausage. Not greasy, great blend of flavors. My new favorite stuffing!

Everyone agreed this was the best stuffing they ever had! It was easy, had a wonderful combination of flavors, and delicious!

Great stuffing and easy - I made it the day ahead. A couple minor changes...I deglazed the pan with some sherry wine after sauteeing veggies and sausage. I also added a cup of chicken stock and a cup of milk to stuffing before putting in fridge for the night (was worried it might dry out.) It was perfectly moist the next day and a huge hit with all my guests. I will make it again next year for sure.

Best dressing for holiday meal ever! I have made it several times, with rave reviews each time. The cranberries make it different and add a holiday touch.

After experimenting through the years with different stuffings (cooked both in and out of the turkey), this is hands-down THE most delicious one I've ever made or tasted. The first time I used the 1.5 cups of broth recommended to make it moist, but it was crunchy and did not stick together at all. The second time I doubled that and it was perfect!

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving EXACTLY the way the recipes states. It was FANTASTIC! The die hard traditionalists even asked for more. I heard my cousin's leftovers never made it home--she ate it with her fingers right out of the Tupperware on her ride back to Indiana! The best compliment I can think of!

I made this for Thanksgiving and the family gobbled it up! I made a few changes that made the stuffing much healthier, and the flavor was still terrific. I used whole wheat bread instead of white bread and sweet Italian turkey sausage instead of pork. I also added a red delicious apple in addition to the granny smith, and I left the skin on both apples for added color. This will definitely become a staple at my family's Thanksgiving!

I used a challah or egg bread for a richer flavor and really liked the results. I have omitted the apples before and didn't feel the flavor suffered. Terrific for turkey, but I use this during the holidays with crown roast of pork, too. Really love it with a nice Pinot Noir or softer red Burgundy.

I forgot to buy the dried cranberries, but went ahead with the recipe anyway. DELICIOUS!!! The best stuffing I've ever had, and stuffing is my favorite part of the Thanksgiving meal.

Fantastic! Made this for Christmas and was asked for the recipe by several folks. A couple things: 1) cut the sausage to 1 lb - I just used one "tube" of Jimmy Dean maple flavor, 2) used Brownberry Country White bread, 3) used dried sage since the market was out of fresh. It was scrumptious.

This stuffing had great flavor. However, I think it called for way too much sausage. I will make it again, but with only half the sausage the recipe calls for.

I used packaged stuffing mix and everyone loved it. I also added chopped chestnuts and used orange flavored dried cranberries. I don't know if that is much different from regular cranberries. But I would definitely make this again. Yummy!!

I made this recipe again, substituting packaged bread crumbs for real bread. Don't do it!! It ended up very mushy, even though I followed the directions as always. Everyone still loved it though; claiming it was the best stuffing ever.

Even the picky ones liked this dish. I did not have dried cranberries so I used fresh ones. 1/2 bag boiled for 5 min in 1/2 cup of water then added the cranberries to the stuffing. Will be making this again.

I can not even begin to describe the reaction that this dish got. We had an early Thanksgiving this year and I made it for the first time and it was so good that my family had to have some packed up and put in their suitcase for the short ride home on the plane. It is a beautiful presentation and wonderfully flavorful. I usually hate stuffing and I loved this. We had it for breakfast the day after it was so good!

I made this for Thanksgiving 2001 and it was a hit. We had it again at Christmas. It makes a very pretty presentation The only alteration I made was skipping the sage and using Sausage with the sage already in it.

I made this stuffing for Christmas dinner and it was a HUGE hit. Like the other reviews say -- very easy and beautifully presented. I made a different sausage stuffing from Epicurious last Thanksgiving, but this one was better. I'm sending it to my recipe file to make it again and again.

This recipe was VERY easy and my guests loved it. My 14 year old neice actually made it for me while I was busy with other dishes. My brother said that he ate the leftovers with everything for days. On sandwiches, for breakfast.....

Should've trusted my instincts on this one. Pork and turkey have no business being on the same plate unless you've got a club sandwich. We wound up eating around the sausage, and will leave it out entirely this year...but the cranberries and pecans made this a yummy stuffing base.

This was a Thanksgiving hit. I made it the day before Thansgiving. In the morning I let it get room temp., and added 1 more cup of chicken stock to make it moist. Then I bake it at room temp. It was great to make it the day before. Happy Holidays!!

This was great. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I would probably use Jimmy Dean Spicy Sausage next time or Sage Sausage. I used plain pork sausage and I think it could have used an extra kick.

I made this for my first Northeast Thanksgiving. Not only was the recipe incredibly easy to make, it was absolutely delicious! My beau really enjoyed it (and the leftovers). It was also nice that you could make it the day before, thus leaving us more time to spend at the Macy's T-Day Parade in NYC! I would definitely make this again.

This dressing was a big hit at our Thanksgiving celebration. Sausage definately needs to be seasoned and I added more sage than the recipe called for.

I made this stuffing for Thanksgiving and it received rave reviews from my entire family. I used sourdough bread, which worked nicely with the cranberries and apples. I also used mild Italian sausage which added a nice spice to the stuffing. I will definitely make this stuffing again.

This was a wonderful sausage stuffing recipe...lots of nice comments. Sausage stuffing can be greasy, but this one is nicely balanced by the cranberries, apples, and nuts. In order to prevent greasy stuffing, I only used a little bit of the sausage grease for cooking the onions - the rest was butter. I moistened it with additional broth that I stirred into the stuffing prior to baking (rather than just drizzling it on the top). In addition - be sure to use bread that has no sourdough taste. Some of the rustic white breads that use starter rather than yeast can be a little sour. I mixed it the day before, and added the nuts at the end. It worked out well.
