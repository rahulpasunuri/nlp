Absolutely delicious! For me, the best part wasn't even the tenderloin - it was the sauce (and the leftovers...read below!). I didn't have marsala, so I used a decent quality pinot noir for both wine measurements. Also, I couldn't find demi-glace, so I used a basic beef broth which I reduced down to the correct amount. I also sauteed the extra pancetta in the pan with the shallots before adding the rest of the ingredients. The sauce was the most delicious sauce I have ever tasted! Here's a tip - set aside the shallots when you strain the sauce, and then add any leftover sauce back to them. I stored this in the fridge overnight and it made this ridiculous shallot "jam." With the tenderloin leftovers the next day, I made sandwiches on crusty baguettes spread with that shallot jam, sliced tenderloin, melted brie and fresh arugula. I think we enjoyed the leftovers as much as the original dinner!

Oooooh I just made this last night. My daughter was home from school for the weekend and I wanted to cook something out of the ordinary for her and her high school best friend who was visiting. I had some pancetta left over after prepping the tenderloin so I chopped it up and put in in the pan with the oil before browning the tenderloin. It added a nice flavor to the sauce. I served this with asparugus risotto and green beans with pine nuts and lemon (inspired by the reviewer below!). It was fabulous though the timing was tricky.

We served this for Christmas dinner and it was wonderful. As another reviewer suggested, we slid slices of garlic into the slits with the pancetta. The beef was excellent and elegant. The sauce was simple to prepare and tasted delicious. We served this with roasted parsnips, fennel and carrot gratin, salad, and green beans with pine nuts and lemon. This is a very simple recipe that yields impressive results.

I made this dish for our Christmas Eve supper. It received rave reviews from the whole family. I was unable to obtain demi-glace so I reduced a good quality beef stock by 2/3's and made a roux to thicken the sauce. I also added some chopped fresh thyme. It was great!

I'm getting ready to make this a third time this evening. Really simple but quite elegant. I too, add the garlic slivers. I am serving this tonight with asparagus and a wild mushroom risotto.

Our family thought this was fabulous! I served it with Mashed Potatoes w/Sage and Cheddar Cheese and a cold asparagus salad. The sauce was tricky but not impossible. I thinned it w/warm water and used less demiglace than the recipe calls for and it turned out great. These are very rich dishes, but it sure makes a great special occasion meal.

I have made this twice. First time I coated the meat in a mixture of flour, course salt, and pepper, then pan seared it before placing it in the oven. Second time I cooked it on the grill. I used thick cut Pancetta, and also put a garlic sliver in with each piece. The Demi Glace is a bit much, I made a peppercorn sauce that also complemented well. Everyone loved this both times.

this was great! I paid attention to the demi-glace, doubled the marsala and it was very well received. I do agree that thick pancetta would be easier to work with. Paired this with sauteed green beans and a Washington State Merlot.

BEWARE OF DEMI-GLACE. Oops. I wish I had read the review that mentioned that some purchased demi-glace needs to be diluted. My sauce had the consistency of cement and tasted terrible. I am sure that was the mistake... But also, aside from the fact that we had a spectacular cut of meat, this beef recipe was nothing special. If I were to try it again, I would order the pancetta thickly sliced so it would have a chance of adding flavor to the meat.

Wow! was this dish ever great! However, I think the main thing to do is to have a very good cut of meat. Once you have that the sauce and meat are so fabulous together that you simply could not go wrong. I reduced quite a bit more wine than asked for and was glad I did. Served it with potatoes gratin and sugar snap peas in a burnt butter and roasted hazel nuts. My guest absolutely loved this dinner. Definately a winner!

I have made this several times and it turned out wonderful each time. It's a great entree for a small dinner party, since tenderloin roasts are usually relatively small -- I had a hard time finding one over 2 lbs. To the cook with the demiglace problem: Although I didn't use the Williams-Sonoma demiglace, the one I did use required it to be diluted - one part demiglace to four parts hot water. I fear that you may have followed the recipe too literally, and simply added the requisite amount of concentrated demiglace, without diluting it first. Please try again; this is wonderful!

As a vegetarian I judge the dish by my guests reactions. When my father-in-law asked to take some home I knwe it was a keeper. No one remembers him ever asking for a doggy bag.

This is one delicious dish! The sauce really makes it special -- sends it over the top. I used a 4-lb. eye-of-the-round roast and followed the recipe exactly. I, too, used Demi-Glace Gold, mixing about 2 Tbsp. enough added warm water to equal 3/4 cup total. This couldn't be improved upon; it's absolutely seductive, and made my Fathers' Day meal for my stepdad something to remember.

Awesome. I halved the recipe and it turned out great.

An oustanding and easy beef recipe. The pancetta lent such a wonderful flavor to the beef, and the sauce complimented both extrememly well. Easy and a keeper!

I feel bad for the cook from Illinois who wasted all that expensive Williams-Sonoma demiglace. Theirs is superconcentrated, and it's a shame she didn't realize that before it was too late.

I made it exactly as the recipe called and it came out amazing. I got rave reviews including one saying it was the best beef recipe they ever had!

When I made this recipe I used a beef demiglace that I bought from Williams-Sonoma. I used the recipe-recommended amount of 3/4 cup and it was almost inedible. I ended up diluting the sauce, re-thickening it with a roux, and readjusting all the seasonings. I suggest that anyone making this sauce for the first time, use a minimum of 1/4 cup demiglace, taste, and proceed according to your individual taste. At $30.00 per jar, it was a waste of demiglace.

This is a fabulous recipe.Easy to make and a wonderful taste. We made it with the entire dinner suggested in the March 2000 issue (wild rice and almond pilaf, snow peas with lemon herb butter and rum current ice cream). We started with the roasted tomato and red pepper soup with chilled mint from the August 2000 Gourmet. Everyone was really impressed.

This was one of best meals I have ever had! It turned out perfect and there were oohs and aahs all around the table. It is SIMPLE and yet looks so professional. The tastes combine to give you a taste of heaven.

Cooking the meat to a perfect medium rare and preparing the sauce yield an amazing dish with lots of flavor. I prefer black currant jelly to red currant jelly, so I used that instead. I served the tenderloin with truffle oil-sauteed leek mashed potatoes and roasted baby vegetables. Indescribably delicious.
