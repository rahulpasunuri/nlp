Since when is pancetta "on a budget"?

I used bacon and omitted the eggs when I made this for my husband. It was fast and easy, and I was able to make it a little healthier but using less butter and low fat cheese. He said it was the best sandwich he's ever had. I will definitely make it again!

Wow...this was fabulous! Worth evey calorie. Made as written...except I forgot the parmesan. I don't even like fried eggs but this was oh so wonderful! Now...to go walk it off!

Just finished my sandwich. These are delicious for an occasional indulgence! Definitely the least healthy thing I've ever made at home, but I'd say they're worth the calories. Followed the recipe pretty closely. I found it helped to pop the bread in the oven on broil for about 30 seconds after the bottoms have toasted just to get the cheese nice and melty. I also went heavy on the basil, and think I'll add basil AND arugula next time. The bite of arugula would be a great contrast to the richness of the eggs/cheese, as is the sweetness of the basil.

Great Sandwich - just as in the recipe! I don't understand everyone worrying about the "nutrition"! Eat ONE! Why do you read Bon Apetit! If you don't like these recipes read "Cooking Healthy" or "How to Serve Your Shoe"! Some of the worst dinners I've EVER eaten were served under the guise of healthful cooking.

It is an aswesome gourmet egg sandwich. I made mine a bit lighter without the pancetta and cooked the egg in olive oil. I made my husband's the suggested way. We were both very happy.

I am a bit confused about directions.Can someone explain the 4 slices of bread, but it feeds 4?

Cook from Vienna, poached eggs make a mess? Water and vinegar in a pan? How the heck are you poaching? I think poached are a great idea, a bit less flavor, but I find it easier than frying eggs.

To "A cook from Berkeley:" With all due respect, if you "switch the pancetta to applewood smoked bacon and the provolone to cheddar, not to mention the eggs to eggplant," you end up with a sandwhich not even remotely related to the given recipe. Did you or did you not get Bulgogi's joke? This sandwhich is obviously meant to be an occasional indulgence, not your everyday breakfast. And haven't you heard? The latest studies show that moderate amounts of animal fat are good for you.

No, I haven't made this, but it sounds wonderful. I'd have to diet for 2 years after eating this. This is really a plea to the cook from Bulgogi - I was having a rotten day and you made me really laugh out loud. Please write more - we need you.

I thought this sandwich was great. Used bacon but otherwise followed the recipe. Will definitely add this to my rotation. Surprised but all the nutritional questions. This is one you should just indulge in. Just not everyday.

Under "find out more," you can learn that this meal is 480 calories, and 32 g fat. That may change after you switch the pancetta to applewood smoked bacon and the provolone to cheddar, not to mention the eggs to eggplant. I apologize for an earlier--Bulgogi is in the heart of AR, not AK.

Nutritional evaluation??? This recipe is clearly an indulgence and not something you should eat every day...bacon, cheese, butter. This is like asking for a nutritional evaluation of a candy bar. The Bon Appetit Test kitchen should not have to tell you that this isn't exactly good for you.

Bulgogi is one of maybe two Korean dishes that are really good. Bulgogi, AK? It's a place in the heart.

Very yummy. By nature fried eggs sandwiches are mild manner foodie food. I did have to change a few things cause I didn't have panchetta on hand (used thin rosemary ham) and no sour dough (used really great whole grain bread. Also my favorite hot sauce sauce blend cause I like spice. My hubby said it was the best fried egg sandwich he ever had and it sure did satisfy my letch. :)

This sandwich sounds too yummy! But I would so appreciate a more thorough nutritional evaluation that includes: protein, carbohydrate, fiber and sugar.

This is one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I have ever made. We made them twice in one week! The first time we did not use provolone, and they were good. The second time we made with an aged provolone which totally made the sandwich. Easy to prepare and very flavorful!

Why can't I see the review from Bulgogi?!?! I'm gonna make this no matter what, but I so do appreciate a rapier wit!!!!

TOO funny cook from Bulgogi, AK !!!! Seems every recipe on here some idiot will make changes and then complain about how bad it is. (I think your version sounds scrumptious, maybe accompanied by some vintage grape Kool-Aid?)

@ Bulgogi,AK. I was curious about where Bulgogi is located and after not finding it, I noticed the I-go-glub. Whether intended or not, I like the symetry. Also, have not tried the orginal sandwich but it looks very tasty.

To the Cook from Bulgogi, Arkansas: Thank you for making my day. I laughed so hard I cried! That was one of the funniest reviews ever! Kudos!

I have tried this twice and plan to make it again. It's a simple but satisfying recipe that is great for busy weeknights. Two tips: First, avoid thick slices of bread. This isn't a sandwich you can compress in your hands without mess. Second, pierce each egg yolk a few times after placing it on the bottom piece of bread. This will keep the egg yolk from squirting out the sides when you bite into the sandwich.

This sandwich was perfect! The crunch from the grilled sourdough with the creamy cheese, soft egg, salty pancetta and bright basil - great combination of texture and flavor!

To: A Cook from Bulgogi, AK: I recommend that you substitute some winter-matted leaves from your backyard for the bread, and your old dish sponge for the eggs. That'll add some complexity and aromas. Some people just can't take a joke, huh?

@Bulgogi - Too funny!! Thanks for the laugh, I really needed it this morning.

To the witty "A Cook from Bulgogi" -- Thank you for making me laugh. I understand cooking is a creative endeavor, but I find it bizarre when reviewers on epicurious.com change the given recipe and then review their own creation. I have nothing against some creative license in the kitchen, but don't give the original recipe a bad review!

People! Do you seriously think Bulgogi made the recipe? Surely this review was made to make all the folks who review based on their changes, to stop and think about reviewing their version instead of the printed version.

Great sandwich, if you make as per recipe. In future I wish ones that did not make the RECIPE as printed refrain from making ridiculous comments.

It amazes me when people say the recipe is awful, then go on about how they substituted this for that and that for this.

What an awful recipe. I substituted some leftover Tofurky for the pancetta. I don't use butter, so I swapped that out for some Nutella that's been sitting in the cupboard for about a year. My wife doesn't like eggs so I used eggplant (same thing basically, right?) and I hate cheese so I opted for some Miracle Whip. The basil or arugula would have been a nice touch, but I'm too lazy to run out to the store so I used some dill pickle chips I had in the fridge. Put it all together in some taco shells (didn't have any bread, either) and, man, it was disgusting. How do they come up with these recipes, anyway?

This is awesome! Don't let the review below fool you. Make it as is, and you won't be disappointed. Served with farmstand tomato soup.

This was a delicious sandwich. The pancetta and basil give it tons of flavor. I urge the reviewer below to rethink their rating considering they completely changed the recipe. Canadian bacon and spinach?! That's a totally different sandwich. This recipe was so good that I made it two days in a row.

Rating: 4
More time and effort than your average grilled cheese, but so good! I wouldn't mess with ingredients listed here, the cheese and pancetta were so great together. I used arugula instead of basil, but otherwise made no changes. The cheese and fried egg were really spectacular together. My only critique is that I think the recipe may have an error: it was unclear if it was actually supposed to make 4 sandwiches out of only 4 pieces of bread or if at some point you slice the bread in half and then put the eggs on--at any rate, if you want 4 sandwiches, I would use 4 eggs and 8 pieces of bread, don't try to slice through the sandwiches or you'll lose all the great yolk.

I made this twice, hoping it would be better the second time. I don't have easy access to pancetta; which may be the problem. The first time the only thing I substituted was Canadian bacon for the pancetta. The sandwiches were extremely bland. The next day, I used applewood smoked bacon, substituted cheddar for the provolone and substituted spinach for the basil. Also poached the eggs instead of frying them..you need to fry them as the poached eggs make a big mess. Anyway, it was better; but still nothing to rave about. I think these are too much work for the outcome. I'm sorry Bon Appetit and fellow reviewers...I've never given a recipe one fork before.
