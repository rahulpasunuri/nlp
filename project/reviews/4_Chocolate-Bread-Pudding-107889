I was looking for an easy bread pudding recipe, and this fit the bill. It was so easy and delicious!! It was super rich, but I will definitely make this again. Some variations I made: I used leftover croissant (and didn't have a "soggy" problem)and 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy cream. I also put them in individual ramekins instead of a big dish. Delightful!

I made this last New Year's Eve for a cozy dinner and just remembered it. I will make it again this holiday season-- it was delicious and easy. I agree with other reviews that it isn't the prettiest dish, but when it tastes like this who cares? I think I may substitute plain croissant for the french bread this time. The only complaint I had, if you can call it one, is that some of the crust from the french bread was a little dry.

My children LOVE this dish as I do. It is easy and tasty. Serve warm with good old vanilla ice cream...heavenly

This is without a doubt one of the best bread pudding recipes out there. I took a dish of this to our favorite gourmet restaurant and the chef's and staff devoured it before we even left. One chef was calling me the next Paula Dean!

I'm going to reiterate what has been said below - this is delicious, so quick and easy but it is by no means elegant! It's more like a chocolate volcano. I used callebaut chocolate and served it with a salted caramel ice cream - everyone raved about it!

I am not talented in the kitchen so look for recipes that make me shine but are still within my capabilities. This fits the bill. Love it and so did my guests and family.

Excellent. Even takes great when I made it with the leftover ends I collect from loaves of wholegrain bread. Love the sugar topping and I often use tubinado sugar.

I used 2% milk instead of whole milk and baked it in a long baking dish to ensure the bread wouldn't be soggy, and it was absolutely delicious. This recipe is one of my favorites, and I will make this again.

I wanted to love this recipie because it's so easy. I made it for my husband for father's day yesterday, and he liked it...he's actually eating a bowl of leftovers right now, but I just couldn't get past the texture. It was just a soggy mess.

This is excellent and really quick. A standard in our household. We use half bittersweet and half semisweet chocolate and put the chips on top.

Rating: 3
Very good. I used bittersweet chips for a richer flavor. The only thing we didn't like was the texture at the top--maybe I used too much bread? I found it really hard to estimate how many slices that was from a bakery loaf so the top was crunchy.

Yum! My 14-year old daughter made this and it turned out great!

This was delicious. We baked in late afternoon and served to our guest after dinner. We made it per the directions, full-fat and all. My wife added a white-chocolate sauce on top for serving and the dish was terrific. We will absolutely make this again!

Excellent recipe, but I recommend tearing the bread into smaller pieces. I also think letting the bread sit for an hour in the chocolate mixture yields better results. Then it's outstanding

I made this for family yesterday, and everyone loved it. I even cut down on the whipping cream a bit; used 1 C. cream and 1 C. whole milk. I don't think I would serve this for fancy guest meal b/c it doesn't make a very pretty presentation. I would describe it as "homey and good".

We make this as often as our consciences will permit--the first few times abiding strictly by the recipe. Culinary crisis a year or so required me to use cheap grocery store cinnamon bread, and I've never gone back! I cut back the sugar a bit to compensate for the sweetness of the cinnamon bread. Try it!

A huge hit on Christmas. I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9 1/2 x 13 inch pan and cooked it a little over an hour. It turned out perfect.

Wonderful! Very rich and choclatey. I made this last night for a New Year's Eve dinner and my guests were asking for seconds. I used all half-and-half instead of milk and cream, and poured the remainder of the bag of chocolate chips over the top before baking. I left off the sugar topping b/c I used the extra chocolate chips. Rich, creamy, and deeply chocolatey. Yum!!

Rating: 3
Very yummy, and intensely chocolately. I used Ghirardelli bittersweet chips, about a quarter less sugar than called for, and divided the liquid between half-and-half and skim milk, since that's all I had. I used a very fresh, dense bread, and had extra chocolate custard left over. Would definitely make again.

Have made this many times with rave reviews by all who have eaten it. I have added more chocolate than required as well as more bread. Even have added fresh raspberries just prior to putting the pan. It is also great cold - has a completely different flavor than warm!

I've made this a few times and it combines two very comforting ingredients: bread and chocolate. It is great if you aren't picky about the appearance and want simple flavors. A raspberry coulis might liven it up and add depth, but it is great on its own.

Wonderful recipe very chewy like a rich brownie. I got a lots compliments for the rich chocolate taste. I have made it twice and my husband just loves it.

I agree with the cook from Louisiana. Good chocolate taste, but the texture is too much like soggy chocolate bread. Also, definitely needs a sauce of some sort. I will keep searching for a better recipe.

Wow! Since this dish was so easy to prepare, I was skeptical that it would measure up. It tastes just like it does at Redfish Grill. Fantastic!

Quite tasty. Used to break Atkins diet :) My husband licked the baking dish. No recipe modifications needed and very easy to make.

This is so easy it's my husband's bread and butter dessert. He's has made this 3 times now for company and it gets gobbled up by 4 people in a jiffy. It comes out in a great consistency-- moist, but chewy and also crunchy on top.We prefer it without the sugar topping which makes it too crunchy.

Easy and fantastic for chocolate lovers. The sugar on top is wonderful. Very different. And its GREAT the next day in the microwave.

This was a wonderful and very easy desert. I took the advice of one of the previous reviews and put the mixture in individual ramekins and baked for 30 minutes. Iafter cooking, I removed the pudding from the ramekins and placed them on desert plates just before serving and topped with a brandy hard sauce. Everyone raved about it!

I brought this dish to a party and it received rave reviews. Not too rich, and a nice change from cakes/brownies. The only problem I encountered was presentation--it looked kind of messy. I think powdered sugar may have helped.

Delicious! I used Callebaut chocolate chips since it was for a special occasion--our anniversary. I used about 1 1/2 cups 2% milk and 1/2 cup heavy cream, and it was plenty rich. I baked it in individual ramekins, so for only about 30-35 minutes. Very easy and outstanding results.

Delicious and easy. I have been making over and over again. Other reviewers note the more expensive chocolate, of which I am often a fan, but in this recipe plain old chocolate chips do just as well.

This is such a wonderful recipe. It's decadent and easy.

This recipe is very forgiving/flexible. I made substitutions with what I had on hand. I used 1 c. of half and half and 1 c. of 1% milk for the wet ingredients, and I only had 1/2 c. of chocolate chips, so I added a tablespoon of cocoa powder to boost the chocolate content. Also, my baguette was so old it was practically croutons, but I let the pudding sit in the fridge for the afternoon before baking, and the bread softened. The recipe came out fine!

It's a little tricky for me converting to metric, but I thought I had everything correct. All the cutard was absorbed by only some of the bread - next time I'll make 50% more custard. Afte rbaking it, I had some cream left over and added about 1 more cup, then reheated for approx. 30 minutes at a slightly lower temp and that helped the situation.

I made this for a dinner party and served it with homemade caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. It was a hit. I have had 2 attendees call me this week for the recipe.

A co-worker (a die-hard foodie and fabulous cook) made this and brought it to work. Closer to a 4 fork than a 3. Phenomenally rich and lovely texture, and the sugar adds another great textural component to the top. Softer (below) than a "typical" bread pudding. I'd seen the recipe before and wanted to make it - now it's in my recipe box.

One of my favorite chocolate recipes that I've ever tried. Truly for the chocoholic at heart. I used french bread (cut up and left out overnight), doubled the recipe and cooked in a 9x13 pan. Easily served 12 people, topped with vanilla ice cream. Amazing how the room went completely silent as we were eating it. Would like to try to lower the fat so I can make it more often. Either way, this recipe (as written) will be a regular for my dinner parties.

I made this for a Valentine's Day dinner party and it was an absolute hit. I served it warm with some vanilla bean ice cream. I prepared the dish (minus the sprinkling of sugar on top) and refrigerated it for a few hours beforehand. Before baking I sprinkled the sugar on top. It baked wonderfully. Everyone gave it rave reviews.

Being from the South, I've tried many bread puddings and often find the experience to be hit or miss. I had not previously tried chocolate bread pudding. For me, this was a miss. The custard had a nice chocolate taste, but the completed dish just seemed like soggy chocolate bread. Next time I want a hot, decadent chocolate dessert, I'll go with a molten chocolate cake.

Excellent!! Very easy to make. I agree with cook from Calgary, it's better when warm but had no problem eating it cold!

Better than you know what!!!!!! I mixed about a cup of whole frozen raspberries left over from summer with the bread cubes and used Bernard Callebaut chocolate. Next time I will try it plain. Boy oh boy is it yuuuuummmmyyyy! -- best eaten warm from the oven, but leftovers are still great, just a tich not as good.

My partner made this wonderful recipe for me and it was the BEST chocolate bread pudding I've ever had! He replaced 1/4 of the chocolate chips with white chocolate chips. This reicpe is very elegant and easy to prepare, and it would be great with a little vanilla ice cream or whipped cream on the side. We will be serving this again and again - a chocolate lover's dream!
