This is my families fav with just a couple changes. After cooking bacon or pancetta I pour off all but about 2 tbsp fat. Circle pan once or twice with good balsamic vinegar and a drizzle of good quality honey. Cook till bubbly/ salt/ cracked pepper and pour over salad with eggs. My husband like croutons and dry cranberries over top! Also works well with sunny side up egg cooked on olive oil until edges are crispy and curled. Making me hungry....

Loved this recipe. The dressing was just right. We had it with a homemade veggie "creamed" soup that that had not cream. Baby spinach was all I had for greens and poached two poached eggs since it was our main course. Felt like I was back in Paris.

Easy and tasty dinner! Reserved 1 T bacon drippings for dressing and crumbled bacon on top of salad for crunch. Definitely makes it into our weeknight repertoire. Enjoyed with a Cotes-du-Rhone.

Great recipe wiith the following changes. French lardon is not smoked so instead of bacon, I used salted pork (Hormel). It was scary to use all the drippings from the pork fat as the base of the dressing so I used 1/3 and replace it with olive oil. Added shallots and red wine vinegar as per recipe, and also added 1/2t of Dijon mustard and a pinch of sugar. Served it with French onion soup gratinee and it was the perfect bistro dinner.

I've had this salad twice at Mon Ami Gabi in the Paris Hotel in Vegas. After thinking about it non-stop, I made it myself and LOVED it! It's such a great salad, I probably won't make any other salad. I agree with previous posters, don't use anything but poached eggs.

Very easy to make with ingredients you have on hand (other than frisee.) I didn't have red wine vinegar on hand, so I used white balsamic vinegar, and it was still delicious.

this is a fabulous salad ... the best we have had is at FIG in Charleston, SC. Chef Lata, a James Beard award winner, uses fresh duck eggs and Benton's Bacon. Benton's Bacon is the BEST!

Love it! Next time smoked trout or salmon instead of bacon with maybe fresh dill or tarragon and capers.

I have also added young dandelion greens and arugula to the frisee. I love to serve it with a few toasted baguette slices spread with soft goat cheese or creamy blue cheese.

Have had this salad in France several tomes and this is an exceptional recipe! My husband is not fond of poached eggs so I sometimes use a quality crumbled gorganzola or roquefurt on top instead - also very good.

Fabulous and worth buying very good slab bacon.

Absolutely fabulous! Wouldn't change a thing (don't overcook the eggs). Better than Brasserie Beck in DC.

A gorgeous salad. The best version I've had in a restaurant is at Bouchon in Las Vegas (chef Thomas Keller of French Laundry). I've been trying to replicate it and this gets close! One tip& toss the salad and the dressing in a bowl to coat it well, then shake off excess and transfer to plates. Do NOT let the vinegar pool at the bottom of the plate; once the egg breaks over it it'll be a mess if you do.

Add a light drizzle of white truffle oil, like they do at Balthazar in SoHo, for an extra- heavenly French twist. Yum.

Food does not get much better than this: simple, flavorful, easy to replicate, adaptable to alternative ingredients...I could go on. Yes, make it like it is. Yes, make a great balsamic instead of the red wine vinaigrette. We love to have this as a second course after French onion soup. Bon appetit!

My wife and I make this incredible dish at least once a week. Pancetta works well instead of bacon, and you can make a vinegarette with shallots for the dressing. Home-made croutons and a sprinkle of freshly grated parmesan are great additions as well.

A couple tips. One classic version calls for poaching the eggs in red wine, which is wonderful. And I really don't recommend hardcooking the eggs; the runny yolk mixing with the greens and dressing is what makes the dish what it is.

This turned out exactly like the Frisee Salad served at a restaurant (The Left Bank) near us. I've craved it ever since I had it there the first time and have been back for it numerous times. Now I can make it at home! I didn't have any red wine vinegar so I substituted champagne vinegar (about 2 Tbs + 1 tsp) and balsamic vinegar (about 2 tsp). They worked well together...the salad was heavenly.

Reminds me of a salad I had at a bistro in Paris. Have made versions of it several times over the years. This was the best. If you're unsure of the freshness of your eggs, use hard-boiled instead of poached. Not quite authentic, nor as interesting, but still very good.

Delicious-- we just served this as part of a brunch to some friends with very discerning palates, one of whom is a travel writer currently writing a book about France. It was a hit! Great for guests, because you can do practically everything in advance. Just poach the eggs the night before and slip them into an ice bath, then store covered in the fridge. Reheat in simmering water 1 min, then serve!

I made this for dinner last night, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since! Don't be fooled by the simplicity of the recipe -- the flavors are full and in perfect balance. I'm just glad I ate this alone, because I practically licked my plate! This wonderfully classic recipe isn't just a meal, it's an experience!

Vive la France! This is the perfect recipe for that French favorite. Good bacon is key.
