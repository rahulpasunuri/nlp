This recipe isn't bad, but it wasn't what I had expected or hoped for. I made the ice cream but served it on profiterols. I followed the instructions to the letter, and am a trained pastry chef, but the ice cream didn't set up in the machine (cuisineart ice cream maker). After stirring every 1/2 hour in the freezer it finally set up, but it was a huge pain to finish. I believe the acidity of the juices broke down the custard to the point where it didn't freeze properly. It also had a puckery aftertaste that was tough to get over. Proceed with caution...
