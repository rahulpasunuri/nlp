I had such high hopes for this bread. (I made it when it first appeared in Bon Appetit, so there were no reviews.) But I found the bread to be terribly dry and lacking in flavor. I didn't have walnuts or pears, which could have added to the problem. But still, I expected more cheese flavor from this recipe and instead it was just flat. Do take the suggestions provided by others to improve the texture and moisture of the bread. Otherwise, it's not worth the trouble.

I would give this recipe 4 forks if it had been written as I substituted. This recipe includes so many extra ingredients that I didn't feel that I could make it as is, given other reviews. I made the following substitutions: I used about 8 oz of bacon, doubled the dried pears, omitted the walnuts, used a bit of fresh rosemary and dried thyme for the sage, and tossed in some sauteed onions (about 1/2c). I added 1/4c dark brown sugar to balance out the savory stuff, and to ensure moistness, I upped the milk to 1/2c, added 1/3c yogurt, and 1/2c melted butter in lieu of the olive oil. The resulting bread had a soft, moist crumb and a delightfully golden-brown crisp crust, and did not lack for flavor at all. make sure to use good bacon - I used niman ranch. Given these substitutions - which basically make it a completely different recipe - I would definitely make it again. Oh, also - all of my substitutions made a volume of batter that filled two loaf pans.

I added 3 shallots, sauted in the bacon grease; plumped dried apples, some rosemary with the sage and used smoked almonds for the walnuts. I baked it in an 8x8 glass pan, for 40 mins. I've only tried a small piece, but it seems to be borderline dry. Next time I'll bake it a little less and add more apples/pears. The sweetness of the shallots and apples is very nice but a bit lost with all the savory bits.

This looked so good I tried it despite the many disappointed reviewers here--and I'm glad I did. Very happy with this recipe! My changes: Instead of olive oil, used a roughly equal mix of bacon grease, olive oil, and melted butter. (Total 1/3 cup) Salted pecans (stolen out of the Planters Mixed Nuts can) instead of toasted walnuts. Baked in jumbo muffin tins --well buttered--instead of a loaf pan. I baked them for 20 minutes. It made 9 muffins.

Like most reviewers I too was very disappointed in how this recipe turned out the first time I made it. But I liked the concept so much I kept playing with it, and the fourth time was an enormous hit with my whole family. I stuck to the preparation method with the exception of cooking it a good 10 minutes less  the cake tester still had a tiny bit of stuff on it at that point, but it was a gorgeous golden brown. The ingredients I changed a lot: upped the bacon to 7 slices, added ½ large onion that I diced and sautéed until tender in some of the bacon fat, substituted melted butter for the olive oil, substituted 1 teaspoon of dried thyme for the sage, upped the cheese amount to 1¾ cup (1 cup of it was grated), upped the milk to ½ cup, and used 2 whole eggs and one egg yolk (whites are drying so I eliminated one that the original recipe called for). The icing on the cake however, was that I served it with roasted garlic and onion jam. Now I think its time to start experimenting with combos like green olives, sun-dried tomatoes, gruyere, Parmesan and toasted almonds&&..Can hardly wait!

I expected this to be richer and more savory. It was rather bland despite all the yummy ingredients. I used sundried tomatoes instead of pears, otherwise followed the recipe. However -- I did find myself going to the kitchen to filch pieces over and over so I guess it had some appeal.

Like so many others that have written, I really wanted this bread to be wonderful but my guest and I found it dry and bland. Thanks to all who made it with other ingredients and posted suggestions. I will try these for my next get together.

I really wanted to like this given the seemingly wonderful combination of ingredients but I just couldn't taste the pear in the final product. It was very bland and the leftovers lingered in the house for a week. If I were to try it again I might use fresh pears or apples, increase the cheese, herbs and reduce the bacon.

RECOMMEND, but with substitutions. It was super easy and made for a fabulous munchie before dinner. I'd highly recommend it. I substituted chopped kalamata olives and rosemary for the pears and sage. I think that the salt in the olives added some extra seasoning that may not have been present with the pears (that may account for others citing a lack of flavor). I think that it would be great toasted as an open face sandwich or as a pseudo-crouton.

Very dissapointing for all the great ingredients. Dry and bland even though it was taken out early and extra pears and cheese had been added.

Very disappointing...especially given the wonderful ingredients. I don't know how it could miss-but it did!--I just threw it out.

My husband and friends loved this bread. I did substitute whole wheat flour instead - so the bread had a nice toothiness. I do agree with the other reviews that I will make this again but with some substitutes - more cheese, and I love the sun dried tomato idea. Perhaps some rosemary too.

Brilliant! Whisk your dries separately; all wets together and quickly whisk in those dries! Fold in everything else. Do not forget the toothpick test for done-ness. time 1 used: organic bacon (Applegate Farms), organic walnuts, sharp cheddar, organic dried apricots, fresh herbs (from my garden) time 2 used: prosciutto, smoked houda, organic walnuts, organic dried apples, fresh herbs

Third time is a charm! I've made this three times, but with different ingredients than the recipe. I like this combo: sun dried tomatoes in oil - drained, chopped kalamatas, chopped fresh basil, cubed and shredded low moisture mozzarella (7-8 oz). The third time was the best because I baked for only 40 min. I also tried with a combo of 2% milk and low fat half and half. It's fine, no need to use whole milk. I bake these for 40 minutes in a pan with 4 compartments for mini loaves - this fills three compartments, the 4th I fill with water. They turn our beautifully and are moist and delicious. They freeze well and make nice hostess gifts. Great with wine!

I must agree with all other reviews - it was absolutely shocking how bland this taste was - especially after the tormentingly lovely aroma while baking! My girlfriend (the chef) and I discussed this receipe in detail and decided that the basics were great, it was the ingredients that didn't live up to expectations, so we mixed things up. This time we used canned Green Chiles (4 oz), canned Hot Jalapenos (4 oz), Cilantro, Lots of Sharp Cheddar (more than the original receipe called for - after all, there's no such thing as too much cheese), Sun Dried Tomatos (drained, 4 oz) and Roasted Pepitas. The results were MARVELOUS - bold flavors and a complete hit! I toasted some the next morning and spread a little whipped cream cheese - wonderful! So, the trick is the ingredients. Obviously we were all looking for more taste than this receipe provided!

I really wanted this to be good, but it is too dry and crumbly. I took it out 15 minutes early as well because it does cook quickly. The timing on this has to be wrong. I hope to find a recipe that is better because I love the idea of the bacon and pear together, but the bread part just was not good.

I liked this. I used some cooked bacon I had left over, some nubs of gruyere I had lying around and low fat cheddar (an abomination, I know, but it was what was in the house). I thought it was good, but it was definitely better warm just out of the oven than it was the next day. It got sort of bland as it sat. I don't know if I'll make this again, but if I do, I think I'll increase the pears - I think those were the best part. I was also thinking I might do this as muffins instead of bread, since the crusty outside part was the tastiest part.

I used tart apples the second time and added extra baking soda..that made the difference. Pears tend to be mild tasting.

I used extra sharp cheddar, maple bacon, chives, and rosemary. It smelled wonderful baking, however was tasteless and disappointing in it's lackluster flavor.

This was awful. So many wonderful ingredients wasted. I also added additional bacon and sage, used Vermont White Chedder and Gruyere, the aroma was fabulous, tasted extremely blah!

Yes, it smelled nice cooking but I agree with the other reviewers that it was not as flavorful as it should have been. What went wrong? With all of the cheese I would have expected better.

This bread emits such a wonderful aroma as it cooks! I can hardly wait to try it. I made my version with ingredients lying around -- parmesan, Prosciutto, dried figs, walnuts and anise seed. We'll see if it makes a difference.

I made this recipe the first time exactly as written and was disappointed. It was very bland. Hard to believe given the ingredients. It also cooked about 10 minutes faster than the recipe stated. The second day I increased the pears (they were soft and plump) to about 4.5 oz, increased the sage to 1.5 tbsp, used better extra sharp cheddar (the first batch was made with a national grocery store brand), added 3 tbsp. Hormel bacon bits (in addition to the 5 slices)and substituted half and half for the milk (the first batch was dry but that could have been because it was done ahead of time). I also chopped up two large shallots and sauteed them in canola oil, then drained, and added to the recipe. The bread was much improved but could probably still use more shallots. Or perhaps just a bit of sugar to bring everything into balance. At any rate, I sliced it thin and served it with plain baked brie, pear chutney and pear preserves on the side. It's an impressive appetizer that way. I'll still be tweaking the recipe if I make it again. Maybe pistachios for the walnuts? FYI, the ingredients need to be chopped large enough to see and taste, but not so large that you will have trouble slicing the bread.

This recipe was very disappointing. With all the cheese, bacon and fruit I expected a flavorful savory bread. The reality is that it was bland and boring.
