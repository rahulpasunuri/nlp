I have been enjoying this dessert ever since I was a school kid some 50 years ago. My mother didn't use lime in it, but the next time we make avacado mousse at home, I'll ask my wife to try it with a squeeze of lime.

I tried this recipe after my boyfriend and I had some KILLER avocado mousse at a restaurant called Yi Cuisine in Los Angeles. I made it according to the recipe and found the avocado taste more overpowering than we remembered, so I added another 1/2 cup of whipped cream and folded it in. The resulting taste was perfect, but the consistency was not quite right- a bit too dense. Next time I will make it with double whipped cream and also add some egg whites to make it fluffier.

Indeed, the people who didn't like it are most likely culturally biased. This was absolutely delicious. Filipinos make a very similar dish, except using sweetened condensed milk instead of whole milk. The Vietnamese avocado shake is delicious, as well.

Those of you who didn't like it are most likely culturally biased because in the US we don't eat sweetened avocados. When I lived in brazil this was a very common dessert and it was made in almost the exact same manner. Have an open mind when trying this, and if it turns out poorly, it's probably you, not the recipie.

I didn't think it was that bad and neither did my cousins or my mom. of course, we go to this vietnamese pho house where they make avocado milkshakes and this one was very similar except that you eat it with a spoon. an interesting dessert although i can see why most americans might not like it.

OK here's how we do this. And you should make it just before eating. Take out the pulp and sweeten it with sugar and mix with fork (or in food processor). Add coconut milk (a good brand) so its a bit creamier. If you like coconut and avocado this is heaven. It is like a mousse and it will brown on the top due to oxidization. I often just take the pulp and fork mix it with some sugar and pour some cream or mlik in and have it for breakfast.

This is without a doubt the most DIGUSTING mess ever to be passed off as a recipe.

Although it's not the best dessert I've ever tried, I don't agree that it was terrible. Those I served it to liked it because it was different. I recommend everyone try it to make your own judgment. Easy recipe. Tends to be a bit sweet, I advise cutting the sugar a bit.

This was just terrible. I served it to some pretty adventuresome people, and we all agreed not to mention it again.
