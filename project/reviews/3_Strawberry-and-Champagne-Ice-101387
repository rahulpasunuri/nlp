After reading the previous comment, I added two tablespoons of lime juice to cut down on the sweetness; the ice turned out wonderful and no one at the party found it to be too sweet.

The strawberry flavor of the ice was delicious, but it was too sweet. Next time I would cut the sugar by almost half.

Beautiful presentation! I added a tablespoon of whipped cream to the top of each dessert.
