I just want to say, this recipe also works as cupcakes - the tops come out with a beautiful superthin crust that when combined with the chocolate icing boosts the overall awesomeness of the whole treat.

While I was making the cake I assumed it was going to be very light b/c of the egg whites. After I put the frosting on it became extremely dense, almost fudge like. Nevertheless, this cake is a winner! Not what I expected but pleasantly surprised.

Excellent! I made this without the icing, and it was definitely rich enough. I just sprinkled some powdered sugar on top to give it a more finished look. Big hit, very moist, delicious orange flavor, and not too heavy. A winner all around!

started making it at my cottage before the power went off and i realized i had no cake pan to cook it in. so i used an big pot and cooked it over a fire. needless to say it turned out so well that i believe this to be the magic cake recipe.

Excellent rich chocolate cake. The orange flavor is wonderful. Great suggestion to add Grand Marnier to the icing. I will definitely make this cake again.

I made this recipe and the dough looked and smelled beautiful when I was putting it together. However, the overall effect was blah. We spent the money for excellent chocolate and used Grand Marnier,but overall I think the effect was mediocre. I wouldn't make it again. I think that you have to be a real fan of flourless chocolate cake to like this recipe. Was kind of a dud at my dinner party - which was too bad because everyone was looking forward to it.

Absolutely fantastic, and so easy to make! This one is definitely going into my regular rotation.

This was great--I did skip making the icing because the cake looked (and was) rich enough on its own. I sprinkled with icing sugar and served with whipped cream and a glass of Grand Marnier and coffee. Also, I used silicon mini pans to get individual sized portions. (Mine were the shape of roses and came out perfectly--I just oiled the pan before use to make sure they didn't stick.)

This was delicious. Wwhen it came out of the oven it was beautiful but fell to about an inch high all around. Did i miss something?

This was amazing. Rich, but moist and the orange-chocolate flavor was wonderful. Would definitely suggest adding grand marnier to frosting...gave it a little extra kick.Everyone devoured it.

Delicious. The bottom of mine burned slightly, so I just carved off the bottom 0.5 centimeter. I might reduce the cooking time by 10 minutes next time. Adding Grand Marnier to the icing was a great idea.

This cake is so good. I added 2 tbs of Grand Marnier to the icing. Served with whipped cream and candied orange rinds. Chocolate with a hint of orange. Excellent.

This cake was so good, very moist, and very rich. I served it with fresh berries covered with sugar to offset the richness. I am making again for a work birthday. Definitely try this one!
