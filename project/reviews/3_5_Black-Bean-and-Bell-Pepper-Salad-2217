Very yummy, although I missed the note about FOUR cans of beans - that's a lot of beans! Guesstimated the ratios instead since I'd already cut the recipes amt of peppers. Still delicious! Def. repeat.

Great salad, but makes way more than 8 servings. We made the full menu this was a part of, and had almost half left over. Very interesting mix, and the sweetness of the dates was unexpected.

This was delicious! I wasn't sure about the dates beforehand, but I loved it!

What a wonderful recipe! The dressing is amazing. I admit I had my doubts about dates and black beans together, but as another reviewer said it is the perfect balace of sweet (dates) and warmth (cumin and coriander). The honey balances it all out. This is an easy, colorful dish which would be a great potluck/picnic dish. The serving size is 1 cup, 400 calories, 12 g fat, 60 g carb, 18 g protein and 16 g fiber.

I frequently cook with black beans and peppers, and many of the other flavors in this salad. However, the dates add another dimension to the rest of the ingredients, giving it a unique balance of flavors and a perfect combination of tangy and not-too-sweet sweet. This was a hit with even my pickiest friends.

I'm back to retrieve this old favorite of mine! Lost and not quite memorized. It is the best black bean salad I've made.

I made this recipe on a student's budget and left out some ingredients--the dates and the coriander. I also left out the onion--it seemed like too many strong tastes together. Both my vegetarian and non-veggie guests ate it. It was even better the second day, so I suggest making it ahead of time.

Disappointed with this recipe.

I came across this dish during a hectic search for a bean-salad recipe, on the eve of a potluck dinner. The interesting blend of flavors in the vinaigrette caught my eye... the salad was a stupendous hit! Even among the guests who did not savor the taste of raw bell peppers. Now everytime there is a party, I'm specially requested to prepare this dish. I left out the ground corriander in the dressing, and reduced lime-juice to 2 tablespoons.

Delicious. It is definitely not necessary to add more lime, as others have suggested--it just depends on your taste. Also, note that it is VERY important to let it marinate before eating it--I made the mistake of preparing it an hour before serving it and I was appalled by the taste and texture, however, the next day it was fantastic. Also, as long as you don't use more than half of the dressing, the dressing does not really affect the color (i.e. you could halve the dressing recipe and still have plenty.

This was so yummy....the dressing is so unique and delicious. LOved the sweet taste along with the cumin flavor. Used dried beans, not canned as I prefer the consistency. The only thing I added was a little kosher salt to up the flavor and a tiny bit more oil so it wasn't too sweet. Easily one of the best black bean recipes I've made.

This was very tasty. As to the color - make sure you rinse the beans before adding them so that they have minimal impact on the color of the salad. Although the dish was OK as a leftover it is best eaten fresh.

Great tasting side dish. A little more lime juice in the dressing would be helpful, perhaps. If the dressing was thinner and not as cloudy, the presentation of this salad would be much more appetizing.

This dish had a wonderful combination of flavors and color, I added a touch of chopped cilantro. I was a hit at the party.

This was okay, and a (seemingly) healthy carbohydrate. I would use more lime next time. The dates are quite sweet, and need the contrast. The salad did not look as nice as I thought it would, with all those colorful peppers. The dressing is a grey-brown that dulls down the colors. I served it on Bibb lettuce leaves, a good choice of flavor and texture.

This salad is easy and soooooooooo good!! I only had red bell peppers when I made it, so maybe it wasn't quite as colorful as it could have been. I had shallots on hand, so that's the onion I used. I took it to work for lunch one day and shared it with my co-workers. They loved it and wanted the recipe. How often do co-workers want to eat someone else's brown-bag lunch?!

I had this at a BBQ recently, and thought it was excellent, wonderful mix of sweet and savory. The chef told me it was a "secret" recipe. Thank god for Epicurious! Next BBQ I'm bringing the black bean salad.

Post Note: I have been unable to locate the spicy bean salad listed below either in here or in 1993. The email address listed is NOT! The email address I listed IS...if anyone locates that recipe let me know? I thought if I put this in here it would save someone else from doing the same..Thanks

One of the best vinaigrette's I've EVER had! The lime goes great with the black beans, but I bet you can use this vinaigrette on any number of veggies and get great results! Yum.

This was one of the better "Black Bean" salads that I have made. Some of our dinner guest used the beans on their tacos as well. I also used raisins instead of dates in the dressing, no one asked, so why tell?

My opinion is that this is a satisfactory bean salad. I prefer the recipe in BA Dec 1993 titled SPICY BLACK BEAN SALAD IN PAPAYA SHELLS as it incorporates fresh cilantro and sambal olek. Try both and decide...........

My husband loved this salad - and originally he didn't want me to make it because he "hates" bean salads. It has a great flavor, texture, and appearance. I used a variety of beans (black, red, pinto) for more interest, and it was fabulous.

I've made this several times for guests and a block party. There has yet to be leftovers. It has a very unique taste. The amount of the vinaigrette can be reduced.

This is a great, easy potluck salad. I brought it to a potluck BBQ and everyone RAVED! It was completely devoured... It has a great sweet, crunchy, fresh taste. (*I ended up needing only half of the vinaigrette dressing, so next time I will probably only make half of the recommended amount.)

Delicious. We didn't have dates, so we used raisins. Worked great. That sweet touch definitely makes the difference.

It's a simple summery salad - very tropical looking and tasting! The dressing is quite sweet, with a fruity flavor. I would only use 2 cans of black beans - 4 seems too much of a bean thing. Plus, the flavors of the vinaigrette can be easily adjusted to suit your preference. Enjoy!
