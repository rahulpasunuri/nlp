I, too, had to substitute five spice powder for that other stuff. I used ground chicken and I had to form it into meatballs. The chicken was warm and I couldn't get the skewer-thing going. However, though I literally had to put toothpicks in them, they were a big hit. Well, every dinner party should have a 50s housewife tribute. Good flavor though. I'd be curious how to do these with a miso soup. It would be like matzoh ball, but for the Asian. Hmm...

I cheated my way through this and was STILL impressed. I minced pickled ginger slices and used 5 spice powder. If I'd done it properly I'd probably have to give up the fourth fork.

Never mind .. I read through the whole recipe this time, it's already explained!

What is "Sansho powder" ?

Excellent - I didn't have the bricks (used grill rack to suspend them) and just used dark meat only, but the flavor was great.
