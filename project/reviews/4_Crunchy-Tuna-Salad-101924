I used leftover grilled tuna and it was great. Didn't have jicama so I substituted chopped turnip and it added a good flavor and just as much crunch.

My boyfriend kept asking if I could find a good tuna salad recipe so I tried several out. This one takes the cake by far...its fantastic! Made it exactly as stated in the recipe and it turned out perfectly. Gave 4 stars because in addition to being delish the recipe is super simple.

Gave 3 forks as I had to manipulate the recipe a bit to fit what I had on hand. Didn't have Jicama so added a diced granny smith for crunch which was nice. It had a slightly bitter taste which I can only attribute to me adding the zest of the lime as well and I may have accidentally zested part of the pith which we all know is a big No No!. I will try again with the recipes exact ingredients the next tine around.

Very good. I absolutely hate mayo, so I used the bare minimum and added more mustard. Perfect warm weather meal.

Really good as written (and super easy). We're jicama fans so prepared it as written. Served the salad on a bed of mixed greens with halved baby boy tomatoes, sliced avocado, and jicama sticks. Fine warm weather dinner.

This is an amazing recipe! I didn't get to add the jicama or Dijon mustard because I didn't have it, but with the rest of the recipe and my own added half-can of corn to add sweetness, it was sublime, and I make it about once every couple of weeks! (As is the life of a college student. :])

I use nayonaise (a low fat mayo alternative) to make this low-fat. Love it!

We really enjoyed this. Like others, I eliminated the jicama (not a fan); and I added chopped scallions. Served it over a bed of mixed greens surrounded by sliced avocado and tomatoes. Lovely and delicious!

Wow! This is my favorite tuna salad now! The lime and cilantro give it a fresh clean taste. I prefer to exclude the jicama and celery, as I'm into the punch of flavor with out the punch of the crunch. Delicious

Like other reviewers, I didn't have jicama, I used tuna in spring water, and the lime and cilantro are *wonderful*. However, I don't recommend substituting canned chicken for tuna.

Well, it's a great recipe, but I agree with the cook who said the jicama is not necessary but the lime and cilantro are. I added a pinch of salt and a splash of white wine to further bring out the flavors. As for the jicama, its contribution to the flavors is minimal and I will leave it out next time. Crunchy is good, but it makes the salad way too crunchy.

Very good--for being made with vile canned tuna. However, I could overcome that fact and eat more of this salad. The cilantro is the star without overpowering.

This is good. As one reviewer said, it would be great in a pita with some alfalfa sprouts and a slice of tomato.

Terrific! Didn't have jicama or cilantro but still very good and very easy. Lime juice is a refreshing addition to tuna salad!

I used leftover salmon and it was great. The lime juice is a must!

This was great just between two pieces of bread, but I'm betting it would be delicious stuffed in a pita with shredded carrots and alfalfa sprouts.

I expanded on this by adding some Wasabi, capers, chopped cucumber, and diced Walla Walla (sweet) onion. To reduce the fat I used albacore tuna packed in water. Then I chilled it and served it on a bed of lettuce and topped the salad with crunchy chow mein noodles. Served with bread and fruit it made a simple, quick and great dinner on a sunny summer day.
