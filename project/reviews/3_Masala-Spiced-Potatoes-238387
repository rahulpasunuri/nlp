I made these potatoes with the Tandori Chicken recipe from 2007. Both were quite good and prep was easy and took under 15 minutes for both dishes prior to popping them in the oven.

These potatoes are delicious and a cube version of Belgian frites. I think the cubes should be slightly smaller than the recipe calls for, to increase flavor. Also, serving these with mayonnaise or a butter sauce (or roasted chicken drippings) is a decadent way to go.

Bland and disappointing. As easy as it is to make roasted potatoes, you would think this recipe would have more flavor. I actually liked the spice combination, it was just way too faint. Will probably make again, because it was easy, but will certainly add more spice and maybe a little heat, or add 1/2 oil and 1/2 butter for more flavor.
