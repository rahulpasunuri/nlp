Very delicious. Didn't have any problems with blandness, just made sure to salt gnocchi, the water and that the sauce had plenty of flavor. Replaced 2 tablespoons of flour with cornmeal. I am going to try making ahead and then baking gnocchi in the oven with sauce to serve.

giving it 2.5 forks. Agree with others -bland, even with tons of salted water - and i added a pureed mixed f garlic/shallot/parlsley to ricotta mix. Just OK

Well, I think I'm one of the few dissenters here. I found the gnocchi to be pretty heavy. After about five, I couldn't eat any more (this made about 30 for me). They were fun to make and I liked the process, so I think I'll try my hand at a traditional potato gnocchi recipe. I thought the sauce was OK; it could have benefitted from salt at the end. Also, there was no way I could have seeded the tomatoes--the roasting nearly melted them.

I didn't like the consistency of these dumplings - sort of like a soft polenta - but the taste was quite good.

I quite liked this dish when I made it many years ago. I couldn't help but notice though, that the recipe for "Gnudi" Dish of the Year, in January 2007 Bon Appetit is almost identical - not the sauce mind you, but the dumpling itself. I'll try that one as well since I liked this one so much! Cheers and happy holidays to all.

This was easier than I thought it would be, and my husband and guest loved it--for being light and flavorful. I am very grateful for the advice from Cary, NC. I didn't fuss with skinning and seeding the tomatoes; in fact, I didn't make a sauce per se at all, just put the roasted tomatoes in a bowl, used kitchen shears to dice them, and ladeled it over the gnocchi to serve. Lowering the boil to drop in the gnocchi, then raising it, worked very well. I also made sure to serve them, as recommended, with fresh italian parsley and parmesan. Ready to do it again!

I would most definitely listen to the reviewer who said to add lots of salt to the water. I thought I added a lot, it still needed more. Also the roasted tomatoes - could have used a whole lot more of them. I ended up using sauce I had made the night before. Parmesan cheese is a must. In all it was intriguing, I'll try it again.

Makes a taty lunch! I used low-fat ricotta and i chopped fresh basil and parsley to sprinkle on top of it all. Also, I put a glug of olive oil on the tomatoes before roasting them. Well worth the effort, but sprinkling basil and parsley on it is a must!

This is a great recipe, if only for the novelty of it -- it might be a bit too much effort for an everyday meal, but great for entertaining. The two problems other reviewers have pointed out are easy to fix, and this recipe is really worth it. With a few tweaks, you can make it really healthy as well! First, the problem of the batter being too thin and the gnocchi falling apart in the water: the batter is not too thin, but the gnocchi will fall apart if you drop the batter in rapidly boiling water. Instead, bring the water to a boil, then reduce to a gentle simmer before dropping in the batter. You can increase the temperature after a minute or so to a rapid simmer, but not a boil. Keep the gnocchi small and neat, which will also help them hold together. The gnocchi may sink at first and stick to the bottom; after a couple of minutes, just gently scrape them loose, and they'll float to the top. Second, the problem of the gnocchi being bland: the fix for this is to heavily salt the water, and I do mean heavily -- a couple of tablespoons of salt in a 6qt pot should do it. If you do this, you can decrease or eliminate the salt from the batter itself, because the exterior of the dumpling will be salty enough, and that's the part that hits your tongue first anyway. But don't forget the fresh-ground pepper in the batter! I also sprinkle some pepper over the tomatoes, and instead of adding water to the tomatoes, add white wine for extra flavor. And lastly, a few other tips: You can save yourself some effort by not bothering to remove the skins and seeds from the tomatoes. It's a little less elegant, but no less tasty (and a bit more nutritious). Also, do your heart a favor and use a good-quality olive oil instead of butter! You can even use fat-free ricotta (Really! I've tried it!) and whole wheat flour (I suggest whole white wheat if you can find it) to make it even more heathy.

I didn't make the tomato sauce and used a gorgonzola sauce instead. So I can't speak to the tomato sauce. However, the ricotta gnocchi was terribly bland. I would not recommend this recipe for the gnocchi.

The gnocchi tasted ok. However, they were a lot of work for tasting just ok, and more like dumplings than gnocchi. I also had to add about 3-4 more tablespoons of flour because the dough was way too thin and the gnocchi were falling apart in the water. The sauce, however, was quite good and fairly easy. To make things go faster, I seeded and peeled the tomatoes first so I wouldn't have to handle hot and/or slimy tomatoes. I roasted them a day ahead, and just mashed them up the next day (I didn't have a seive big enough). I may do the sauce again, but if I do, I'll have to double or triple the recipe because it didn't make much.

This dish was easy to make and delicious! I followed the suggestion and cooked the tomatoes up the day ahead to save time. Be sure to use ripe, flavorful tomatoes or the end result will suffer. My family raved about both the gnocchi and the sauce. Being used to potato gnocchi, we couldn't believe how light and tasty the ricotta ones were.

This dish is simple, elegant, and delicious. I made it with part-skim ricotta and reduced the butter used to saute the gnocchi. Don't be shy with the salt and pepper in the gnocchi- the seasoning is neccessary to bring out the savory flavor. Excellent!

The gnocchi did not have much taste to them but the roasted tomato! The sauce was amazing! I will use it instead of any other tomato sauce.

I followed the recipe to the letter and results were great. Gnocchi were shapeless as noted below but texture was pillowy - better than I expected. My husband liked it too. A minor complaint is that the servings were a little small - I cut the amounts in half to make two servings but next time I will make more because we agreed we could have eaten more.

So quick and easy. I had pesto on hand so did not do the tomatoe, but will try next time. Much easier than gnocchi made with potatoe although I don't know if it could be frozen.

Don't forget to add the little notches on the gnocchi before you boil them so they can 'hold' the sauce. You can buy a special gadget or just slide them over the tines of a fork.

The tomato sauce on its own is wonderful, to be used on other dishes

Gnocchi were very easy to make, but came out shapeless. The tomato souce was time consuming so you can use any other tomato souce you like. The combination was very tasty and even those who don't like cheese loved it.

The roasted tomatoes were wonderful. I added garlic, basil, and oregano, and that was perfect. However, my gnocchi also turned out less than perfect. I may try them again, although odds are I'll just make the sauce and add it to some other type of pasta. It seemed like a waste of perfectly good ricotta to me!

Excellent! Made it twice already and my family loves it! The tomato sauce is perfect but I'll add roasted garlic next time.

Made this Fri. night for supper. It was perfect - not much fuss and great flavor and comfort food value. I roasted onions, peppers and a couple of diced garlic cloves with the tomatoes. Think I will add eggplant to the mix next. Be sure to saute the gnocchi until browned and slightly crusty - that takes care of the soggy factor. It goes on our company food menu as well as the list of what to make when there are lots of tomatoes left from the garden at the end of the season. I will make this again and again.

I found the recipe VERY bland and found it difficult to make the dumplings come out to a nice shape. I used a tomato press to make the seeding and peeling of the tomatoes easier, but even so, it seemed like this was a lot of work for very little flavor.

Gnocchi was soggy, reminded me of little dumplings. Sauce was very good.

Great recipe. The sauce, even without any herbs, was wonderful. Since the batter is thinner than any other gnocchi I have ever made before, next time rather than cooking them in a deep pot I am going to try poaching them in a shallow pan for a little more control over their shape.

The idea of cooking only 10 gnocchi at a time seems excessively cautious, but the smell of roasting tomatoes makes up for such absurdities (if indeed you intend to indulge them)! A delightfully quick meal - and so easy to remember that it will definitely join the repretoire of meals you can just whip up at a friend's house and look like you have made them all your life!

A great recipe.My grand mother made it either way,with ricotta or with the potatoes.This one has finally caught on. Good Show!

Spectacular! My younger son is vegetarian, so I;m always looking for new vegetarian dishes. We all loved this very easy dish. I added some fresh oregano to the sauce, as well as a sprinking of chopped basil and Parmesan when I served it. Next time I'll probably saute a bit of garlic before adding the tomatoes. I'm also thinking of serving some grilled shrimp for a non-vegetarian version.

Delicious! The gnocchi were so light and easy to prepare. I sauteed garlic in olive oil before adding the tomatoes for the sauce and I added basil. We'll definitely make this again.

Yummy!Very light-not at all like gnocchi but very delicious & soo easy. Will definitely make again. I changed the sauce quite a bit. I added fresh cherry tomatoes(yellow) cooked down, some onion garlic & fresh basil & served with a sprinkling of romano. Try it you'll like it!
