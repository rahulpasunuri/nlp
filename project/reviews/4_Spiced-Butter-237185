Fabulous. Made with filets as written, loved, the next week made with buffalo steaks which also rocked!

Made this to go with filets mingons with spiced butter, glazed artichokes, and haricots verts. LOVED it. I did not have caraway seeds on hand but it was still wonderful. I will be using it in the future for added flavor to my veggies.
