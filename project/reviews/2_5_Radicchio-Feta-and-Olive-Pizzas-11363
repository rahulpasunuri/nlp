Outstanding and unusual flavors appeal yet they do not appeal to everyone. Made this as one of 4 specialty pizzas for a party and the guests gobbled it up. Would not suggest serving this pizza as a single main course because of its very opinionated flavors.

This recipe was radic-culous. Radicchio is way too bitter to use to this degree. It overpowered the dish! This pizza wasn't touched by any of our guests after the first bite.
