Despite reservations this was a hit - perfect with sauvingon blanc

Delicious. Super easy and inexpensive to make, it even reheats well for lunch the next day. What could be finer?

This is a great side dish as written and a super main dish with the addition of sauteed shrimp, scallops or vegetables like asparagus, broccoli or peppers. I've made it six or eight times, alone and with additions. It's the food snob equivalent of macaroni & cheese. Easy, filling, goes with everything, everyone loves it.

This was great! I live in paris with my very picky boyfriend and he loved it. So simple and easy to prepare, I did follow another reviewer and added tomatoes for an extra kick, double the cumin and garlic...excellent idea. This is a keeper and plan on making this again!

So simple and so satisfying! I had everything for this meal in my pantry/fridge and made it quickly for dinner with a side salad. My husband loved it! I think we might add a little more heat next time...otherwise perfect and definitely going into my stand-by recipe collection

Very simple and a nice twist on a spaghetti dish. I chopped a tomato into chunks and threw that in there because I thought it would work well, and it definitely provides an occasional tangy treat. A must with good Parmesan.

This recipe was very good and very easy. We will make this again.

Great flavor and level of spice. The cheese on top is key, too.

Excellent flavor to this one. The cumin really adds an interesting kick. I made one change that I found worthwhile: heat the oil over medium-low and gently heat everything but the parsley in it. It really blends the flavors and accents them.

My fiancé and I found this recipe exceptional! I added a few modifications I wanted to share in case anyone wanted to try them. First of all I doubled the amount of cumin and tripled the amount of garlic in the main part of the recipe. I also used 1/2 cilantro and 1/2 Italian parsley instead of all parsley. Also, while I was boiling the water I chopped up 1 red bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper, and 4 small cloves of garlic - sautéing the peppers first for about 8 minutes in drizzled olive oil, then adding the garlic for 2 minutes, and then about 1/3 cup of low sodium chicken broth and 1 pound of cooked shrimp (tails removed). I let this simmer until the water was almost at a boil and then took it off the heat and put it aside. Then added it later when I added the oil mixture. I found I only needed to add a little less than 3/4's of a cup of the reserved pasta liquid in 1/4 increments to make sure everything mixed together perfectly. This is such a keeper for us!

One day I bought a bottle of cumin by mistake and not knowing what to use it for I did a search here and found this recipe. It's GREAT! I made it several times since. I did add more cumin the second time though. If you're a garlic and olive oil lover, you should definitely try this.

This comment isn't really about this recipe but about some of the comments overall. It amazes me when some write they would not make a recipe again as they didn't like the way it tasted or the texture when cooked and then in the next line they tell you that they didn't follow the recipe. It is okay to experiment don't get me wrong but if you are going to rate a recipe follow it and then we will all have an honest comment to go by.

I've made this twice now--the first time was so-so, but the boyfriend liked it and it was so simple that I decided to give it another shot. Like the previous reviewer, I added firm tofu for protein: I just crumbled it in. I also about tripled the garlic, added some cilantro in addition to the parsley, and chopped half a red bell pepper into it--what an improvement. The red pepper flakes give the recipe the right amount of zing--I forgot this ingredient the first time 'round and regretted it.

Very fast, very easy and very good. I did make two changes, wanted a bit more protein so I added half a cup of cubed extra firm tofu. Also added a handful of chopped walnuts for some extra depth. Great vegetarian meal!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to prepare. I tend to add a little more garlic than called for in the recipe. Everyone who has tasted this has LOVED it!

This was good but not outstanding maybe I did not put enough cumin...my boyfriend loved it.

Quick and easy. However, I added some shrimp to this dish to give it a little more substance. My husband loved the dish and probably thought I spent all night making it.

If you're looking to build up a repertoire of yummy, fast, easy recipes - try this! It's definitely on my list of keepers.

I thought the whole was greater than the sum of the parts. Very simple to make, yet surprisingly addictive. I use cumin all the time in Indian and Mexican dishes, but was apprehensive how it would be in a pasta dish. I works just fine. (Note: it is always helpful to lightly roast cumin seeds before grinding. Then keep in jar in fridge for a few months.)

I used curly rotini pasta instead of spaghetti because that's what we had. My overly picky boyfriend liked it, which is really saying something!

My kids raved about this one.

Very easy, simple and good. I would try to substitute chopped cilantro instead of parsley next time.

I really like this recipe. It is simple yet has good flavor. This is a nice twist to pasta aglio e olio - (garlic and olive oil) which I love so much. I have made this a few times and my family really enjoys it. Since there are so few ingredients - the quality of the ingredients used is key.
