I love, love, love this sauce. I am always trying out new recipes so there are only a few recipes that I make over and over again...this is one of them.

Made it for family gathering. Everyone raved about the sauce. Made it according to recipe and it was wonderful.

this was definitely an unusual recipe- the flavors were surprisingly good together, i too used apple cider instead of apple juice.

My goodness this was good. I had my doubts but after reading the reviews decided to stray from my breaded- dijon-baked-chop recipe. The flavors, after a bite or two, truly proved to compliment each other. My chops were maybe an inch thick and took much more time to saute but were nice and juicy. My boyfriend said that I always make nice dinners, but that I hit this one 'out of the ballpark'. The sauce was awesome.

This was good, I'm not sure if I would make it again but I am glad to have tried it.

This was such a unique recipe and I wasn't sure the flavours would mesh well. But it was delicious! The sauce was to die for..the perfect sauce for pork chops.

Enjoyed the sauce. I'd add more liquid next time. I also added garlic and white wine.

I am eager to make this again, the family loved it and it was easy to make. I served it with a creamy risotto and green beans.

Loved this dish. Very rich and unique. Didn't change a thing.

Made this the other evening and it turned out superbly. The only deviation from the recipe was that I had a box of pork stock that I used in place of the chicken, and the apple juice was replaced with cider. The sauce was rich beyond my wildest dreams and even Mr. Picky-Eater, a.k.a. my husband liked it.

Everyone licked the plate. Seriously. This was very easy, made on a weeknight. I used boneless porkchops and the only other substitution was beef broth instead of chicken broth. It was that good! And I have 3 kids!

Delicious. I omitted the cornichons mainly because my fiance hates pickles. BUT! it was still FANTASTIC!!

The flavor combination of this dish was so wonderful...mustard, sweetness from the apple juice, vinegar from the cornichons. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it. I used boneless pork chops, which still turned out great. just adjust the cook time accordingly.

This received the ultimate accolade - the wish that there were larger portions. This is likely to become a regular to our table.

This is a very easy and elegant recipe. For the reviewer from SLC, cornichons are sour pickles; you might want to substitute dill pickles for the sweet ones. I think this makes for a more complex and interesting taste since there is already sweetness in the dish with the apple juice and shallots.

My husband and I liked this recipe. It's a nice, quick and seemingly elegant dinner without the fuss. I used 1/2 inch thick pork rib chops instead of the 3/4 inch thick ones. I served it with a simple spinach salad with pomegranate seeds and vinaigrette dressing. My only change was more out of necessity than desire. I didn't have whole grain (or even dijon) mustard. Also I couldn't find cornichons, so I substituted very small sweet pickles. The mustard dilemma was fixed by using 1 tbls yellow mustard, 1/8 tsp horseradish and a splash of white wine. Even with the substitutions it tasted great. I do plan to make it again this time using whole grain mustard. I think I"ll continue to use the sweet pickles unless some cornichons happen to fall in my lap.

Delicious. Just the right combo of tangy from the cornichons and creamy from the butter. Used regular Dijon mustard and it tasted just fine.

Super easy and fast. Followed the recipe exactly. Perhaps a little more sauce for each chop would be nice.
