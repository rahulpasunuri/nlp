Simple and easy to prepare. I've also added a couple of bay leaves as well a star anise as suggested by a reviewer.

I made this last night and it was fantastic!! It was a little bit fiddly but well worth the effort!!!I added the star anise as suggested, and also transferred the pork to my slow cooker, for the three hour cooking period so I could go out for the afternoon. The ouse smelt lovely when I came home.

This is wonderful, I added 2 star anise and served it up to my family, including my daughter's Chinese boyfriend. It dissappeared with no leftovers. I will make this again.

This was a really good dish. I live in Spain and could not find bok choy, so stir fried bean shoots, sweet peppers and chopped scallions. This made a good accompaniment. I added a piece of star anis suggested by another cook. Good idea. Why is it called red pork? Mine was not red! George

Why on earth would ome substitute ribs for pork belly? Also, this is most decidedly not teriyaki pork. Teriyaki is not Chinese.

FYI - DO NOT substitute ribs for pork belly. They are entirely different cuts of meat! It's like substituting top round for filet mignon; if you do something like that, you shouldn't be suprised when you fail to achieve the desired result.

Wow. The ease and quality of this dish are both astounding. I made it for someone who grew up with Chinese cooking and he loved it. Perfect, he said.

This recipe is very good and very close to the one my parents made when I was little. I used this one, because I had a hard time translating the one my father gave me. Now my husband and children can taste the memories I had as a child. Remember you can use any fresh green vegetable (not green peas though)lightly steamed.

I have made this dish several times now and I have enjoyed it everytime. One suggestion: add a couple of whole star anise along with the soy, garlic and ginger. It gives the pork another dimension.

This is a great recipe for red cooked pork! In response to the "teriyaki" comment, this dish is actually a very traditional chinese dish eaten at around new year's time. "Teriyaki" is actually Japanese.

Sure, I used country ribs instead of uncured bacon, but the sauce was too sweet. Too much effort for teriyaki pork.

This is a great dish, in both taste and easiness to prepare. If you're a fan of pork, I suggest you try this one at least once :) One thing worth mentioning though, it is a fatty dish so... watch that you don't eat this every day if you like it so... :)
