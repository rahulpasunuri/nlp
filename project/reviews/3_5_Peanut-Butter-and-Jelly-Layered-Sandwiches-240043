What a wonderful traditional recipe. For an exciting twist, how about cutting the crust off!

I am cracking up at all these reviews. Cookie magazine is a kids' magazine so of course the recipes are going to be simple. I think it's a great way to introduce kids to the kitchen and it certainly beats fast food.

my son asked me to include this recipe into my recipe box as I was perusing vegetarian options. He has been a vegetarian since he was 6 years old and lives on PB& J. The other review made me laugh out loud!!

Isn't this a slight variation on James Beard's preparation from "Theory and Practice"?

I cannot believe that Epicurious has listed this "recipe". What a joke!

I am so excited to find this recipe again I had lost my original. My kids loved it. My grandkids asked me to make these & I had to disappoint them. Inviting them over tomorrow for lunch!

Tried to review this earlier, but looks like the site has lost my review. I'll keep this one brief: I made this hors d'ouvres precisely as written, and it disappeared within minutes. I'm bringing it to my sister's bridal shower.

Wonderful! This recipe is definitely a keeper. I will be making this regularly. Can't wait to try substituting strawberry jelly for the grape or raspberry-and-apple next time, and perhaps using just 2 slices of bread, rather than 3. But really, this recipe is excellent just the way it's written: perfection!

This has to be a joke right? Epicurious is now posting recipes on how to make PB and J sandwiches? Really this is a joke right? OMG this is for real.
