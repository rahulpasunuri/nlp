Just made this yesterday for a book club and it was an unqualified hit. Got the recipe many years ago in the same way as another reviewer (Betty Crocker) then couldn't find it when I needed it. After I did find it, I noticed that it did call for the shorter cooking time. Back in the day when I was a purist, I made up my own "cake mix" from fresh ingredients, and that way you skip the artificiality of the commercial mix. But, using the mix is much faster! We love it. Used 2 1/2 c. Jonathan apples off our tree.

I'm surprised to see the bad reviews - while the yellow cake is artificial and full of preservatives - not my favorite, this is a favorite recipe that has been passed through my family for years....I finally made it for myself and overdid the crust a bit, but other than that it is delicious!

This was the worst thing I have ever made from an Epicurious Recipe. I was in a rush and wanted something easy. The crust was so sweet that when I tasted it I got nauseous. The topping wasn't bad as I had used fresh apples, but it didn't look too appetizing.

I was so excited to find this recipe. I used to make it many years ago. I had to make a quick dessert and it was perfect. It just took about 20-25 min to bake not the 40 suggested.

Kids threw up, husband faked a heart attack and the dog burried what was left in the yard. Need I say more?

This is a recipe my mom originally tore out of a magazine 25 years ago. It was included with a Betty Crocker advertisement. This has been a favorite of ours for a long time. The only difference between this recipe and the one from the magazine is that my recipe calls for 1/2 cup of sugar. In addition, the cooking time is only 25 minutes, were it is 40 here. That could account for the hard crust. We have always loved this easy dessert. Just adjust the sugar to the sweetness or tartness of the apples, and it comes out perfect everytime.

I have one word for this recipe - Awful! As a previous reviewer wrote, the cake part was terribly hard. The topping with the sour cream was, for want of a better word, bizarre. I made this yesterday for my husband and I and we both ate one piece each then I threw the entire thing out. I guess I should have known with something that was that quick to make. I really would have liked to give this "no forks" because it will go down in my "cooking history" as being one of the worst. Save yourself some time and find something else to make.

Great dessert. Be careful to not burn the bottom half...yellow cake

Fast and easy. The crust was kind of hard but tasted sweet and rich. Went great with coffee. Every person who ate it asked for the recipe.

Great recipe when time is short! I served this at my puppy shower and everyone loved it. Don't leave out the sour cream topping - its what really makes this special!
