How wonderful that such a simple recipe rates a unanimous 4 forks! I was so embarrassed about not knowing how to make a grilled cheese sandwich. Thank you Epicurious for not making this recipe into something it shouldn't be. This is perfection in its simplicity.

What this recipe doesn't explain, and what took me a while to figure out, is that to keep the bread from charring before the cheese melts, is to cook over low-medium heat. I wish someone had told me that when I first started cooking. A burnt grilled cheese is a sad, sad thing.

Just got done eating an excellent grilled cheese. I used lightly toasted wheat bread with swiss cheese, raw onion, tomato slices, and bacon. I wish I made a few of them. I buttered both sides of both slices of bread after toasting. Looking forward to doing this again. Was really good, if a little salt and pepper were added it might make it even better.

My Hubby, for the last 30 years, has always made the most EXCELLENT grilled cheese sandwiches. He always butters the exterior of the bread slices, uses sharp cheddar cheese (once we graduated from Velvetta), grills them under the broiler (no need for 2 Tbs. butter per sandwich). Tonight we used the tomato version of this sandwich, and I particularly like the onion-cheese version. I don't think we are too "dumb" to make good toasted cheese sandwiches. I think we are the smart ones who look at additional ingredients to enhance the already good sandwich!!!

You have got to be kidding! If you need a recipe for grilled cheese you should buy frozen dinners and take out.

its true that not many people cant make a decent grilled cheese, but i can offer this one tip 2 assist those who need assistance: apply the butter(softened) to the bread and grill until slightly burnt on both sides. gives it a nice crunch.especially good w/garlic butter... ...(drool,drool)

grilled cheese is always a favorite, and believe it or not some people cannot seem to fix a decent one. if you feel it deserves four forks who cares it is your opinion. rate what you think and move on already

Cheesee But Can Be Made Better

Try it with Jarlsberg cheese, roasted red peppers, sourdough bread, and use extra virgin olive oil instead of butter. Be sure to press with a spatula as the author suggested; I use a second frying pan on top of the sandwich to exert pressure.

People, please! This is not an epicurian feat. It's just a grilled cheese sandwich for goodness sakes. 4 forks? That rating means a dish beyond compare. Somebody is leading a sheltered life.

We made this with American cheese slices from childhood, and took the suggestions to spread mayo on the inside and to butter (using marg spread for ease) on the outsides of the bread, rather than buttering the pan. We made this in a grill pan, for a lovely dark-charred-circle effect. Also added the thin slices of tomato. Simple yet oh, so satisfying!

Grilled cheese IS the best. If you want to make the bread crispy like one other reveiwer mentioned, butter both sides of your sandwich instead of melting the butter in the pan. Ohhhh to die for!

My all time favourite comfort food is a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato. Sometimes, I'll use bologna or ham, but tomato is my favorite. And when you have a great soup to go with it, it can't compare to even a lobster tail. (I have very simple food tastes, I don't need the fancy stuff.) Can't go wrong with a grilled cheese, I wish I can make the bread crispy like they do in the restaurants.

This is a favorite of mine. I always enjoyed going to Grandma's, and having a "Skillet Meltie." Reminds of my grandmother so dearly. Thanks for the memories.

This is a favourite of all those who frequent Bianca's smut shack at the annual Burning Man festival... add a little smut, music, and party people, and it's like you're still on the playa!

One of my favorite sandwiches of all time is my Grilled cheese&Bacon sandwich. Got one word for it Badass

This is the lunch my aunt made nearly 60 years ago when my Mother and I would visit! Truly comfort food, especially with Tomato Soup. Not too often, though - high fat content. Not long ago I passed this on to my aunt's grandchildren, and now they make this occasionally for their children.

Pretty basic sandwich...for less fat, I put in toaster oven at 300 degrees for 10 minutes !
