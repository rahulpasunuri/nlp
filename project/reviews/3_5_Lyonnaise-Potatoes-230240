These are good and very simple. I will certainly add these to my file. Going to try with Yukon Golds and beef broth.

I add 3 scoops of vanilla ice cream and topped it with chocolate sauce. Didn't use the potatoes, onions, or broth. Delicious! Then I came here to rate & review a recipe I didn't make. Such fun!

For just 2 people I used 2 russet potatoes and one half of an onion. I sauteed the onion in butter and olive oil for about 20 minutes, then put them into a 375 degree oven until done, about 30 minutes more. The results was perfect, just like you used to get in the old style steak houses and a perfect portion for 2 people YES I omitted the chicken broth!

This is one of the easiest and tastiest ways to make potatoes! The chicken broth and the onions add a depth of flavor that is unusual when eating potatoes! It is easy and yummy. Sprinkle with a bit of chopped parsley or maybe even chives for a splash of color!

I used red potatoes added added three stalks of celery finely chopped to the onions and caramelized them with celery seed, thyme and a bit of garlic salt. It was excellent

Took previous reviewer's advice and cooked with foil for 45 minutes, then cooked for 20 minutes after foil removed. Last 10 minutes broiled to brown on top. Also added an extra onion and carmelized the onions before adding to the potatoes. Simple, easy, very tasty and low fat.

I caramelized the onions over slow heat for about 20 minutes before adding them to increase the flavor, and also added a sprinkling of thyme. I cooked the potatoes about 15 minutes longer covered and an extra 10 minutes uncovered. Came out very tasty.

I had to bake it a little longer than 30 minutes. Came out great for such simplicity.
