I've made this recipe four times and love it, although I've used salmon or arctic char because I haven't been able to find black cod without special order. I love the lemon and don't find it overwhelming.

Fantastic... Made this with the Quinoa and Asparagus salad. They made a light delicious dinner.The lemon and black olives in the chard went really well.

This was a four fork dish but I would tweek the recipe next time and skip the cooked lemon and substitute fresh lemon juice instead. I had forgotten how much I love sautéed Swiss chard and the olives really kicked it up a notch. It was a nice compliment to the black cod. We served it with a roasted cauliflower steak and parmesan puree. It was the perfect meal.

I would make this again but I agree that there is way too much lemon. I halved the recipe and so used a half lemon and only ended up adding half of that which was still too much. The pith was very bitter even after boiling and that kind of ruined the greens, which were otherwise very good (I used spinach instead of chard). Loved the quinoa! I used northern pike for the fish and it came out perfectly cooked with the times given. I could taste the coriander and cumin just fine. The next time I make this, I will add the lemon pulp and just a little grated zest and forget the diced pith and peel.

I really liked this. I wasn't familiar with using boiled lemon, and it gave a beautiful tasting rind. I wound up using only half of it, and substituted caper berries for olives. The skin on the fish was crispy and absolutley delicious!

Well, it's got a lot of my favorite things in it so I think I'll give it a try, adjusting quantities to taste. As to the fish being underdone, got to put responsibility for that on the cook. Either you know how to cook fish properly to your taste, or you don't. It's not the recipe's fault if you don't.

This recipe was OK but the proportions seemed off. I used a large lemon and after chopping it looked like too much so I only added half in the chard and doubled the olives (both kalamata and green) and it was still WAY too lemony. We had to pick the lemon bits out as best we could. The scant portions of garlic and red pepper flakes were indistinguishable. I seared the black cod for 8-9 minutes on one side and 4-5 on the other, and it was still a little too translucent for my tastes in the middle (it was also cool, which is kind of icky). I used very fresh, wild-caught black cod, and the following day my house smells soo fishyyuck. The coriander and cumin were indistinguishable after searing but did create a lovely crust effect. I served with mashed potatoes and carrots which were beautiful and a hit with everyone, and saved the meal. The flavors were 1 to 2-star, and I won't make this again.
