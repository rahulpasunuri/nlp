Whatever you do, DON'T add any extra egg white-sugar mixture to the baking pan - strain as much off as you can, otherwise you will end up with spongy stuff in between the nuts, then the nuts don't crisp up well. And....I added a tiny bit more sugar to the mix....and the salt is a good thing, too, so don't skip the "pinch."

This is a lovely dessert. The apples poached like a dream and I boiled down the cider to a syrup for decorating the plates. My one concern was the spiked whipped cream since it doesnt always hold up for me and tends not to peak as much as I like. Next time, Ill put the rum in the cider syrup, I think. I also dusted the desserts with cinnamon. I served this to five gourmands, two of whom own a high-end restaurant. One asked if he could lick the plate. Made the apples and syrup ahead and stored them covered in the refrigerator. Rewarmed in the micro before serving.
