The first few bites were amazing and very delicious. But, after about five bites, it was so rich, I couldn't finish it. It probably would make great finger sandwiches for a party.

I am no longer allowed in my house to make plain ol' grilled cheese sandwiches anymore. This is so good. I have made it several times and will change the herbs. Tonight it is marjoram. I also include some very finely minced garlic to the butter and use carmelized onions on the sandwich. Yum! I usually serve this with tomato-pesto bisque.

Mmmm, just ok for me. I think I'll try the left-over compound butter on some chicken breasts.

This was a definite crowd pleaser. All my guests from age 4 to 64 loved it. We grilled the onions and had some mozzarella cheese too. Everyone assembled their sandwiches from a platter and we tossed them on the griddle. The compound butter made the sandwich.

This was good, but almost too much. I like the idea of the flavored butter, and in the future, I will create my own. However, the mustard and butter together was way too pungent, in my humble opinion.

i adore this recipe. i love love love it. i also think that it would be easier if you spread the butter on before assembling the sandwich.

A delicious twist on an old standard. Next time I'll cut amount of cheese in half though. It was a little too rich for my husband's and my taste. I'd also increase the amount of tomato and onion for more intense flavor. But that's just us.

I loved this recipe. It's a very simple meal, dolled up with the herbs to make it taste & look fancier. I used non-fat spray butter (can't believe it's not butter)instead of regular butter & turned out fine. I also ommitted thyme (didn't have any) - still great. Also used reduced fat provolone cheese, rather than cheddar...again, GREAT! Served with low fat frozen french fries & asparagus. YUM!

This is an upscale grilled cheese sandwich and quite delicious at that. The herbed mustard butter is what sets it apart. The method of spreading the butter mixture directly on the bread and then grilling in a hot pan works great and results in even and crispy grilling. The only thing I'd do different next time is spread the butter on the outsides of the bread before assembling the sandwich. I'm all set to have another one of these tasty sandwiches again tonight; this time substituting thinly sliced apple in place of the tomato and onion. Yum.

Excellent lunch sandwich, with tomato and rice soup. It was quick and easy to make and my husband and daughter loved it!

I made these sandwiches to go along with the tomato, dill, and white cheddar soup. It was a great combination. These sandwiches had so much flavor. I made one sandwich for everyone and they made me make more!

I do not like some of the ingredients, therfore I didn't like it very much.

WOW!! So easy and so tasty - even my nieces ( 8 & 7 years old) asked for more! So be prepared for seconds. This will replace the "standard" grilled cheese receipe. I used dried thyme, italian seasoning instead of parsley and black forest ham. The red onion was a nice touch. A real winner!!

I have made this as finger food at many parties. I use the square party rye and leave off the tomatoes. Tasty!!

Wonderful! My husband and I both enjoyed these for a simple Saturday lunch and thought they were great! He's already requesting them again! Terrific variation!

A tasty morsel. You wouldn't think that you'd need a recipe for grilled cheese, but if you're looking for a sterling sandwich, by the numbers, than this is it.
