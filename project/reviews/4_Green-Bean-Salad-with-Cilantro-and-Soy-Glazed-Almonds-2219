Good, not great. I'll be making this again just because it is tasty and simple. Nice family dish, but I'm not going to wax ecstatic about this. I made it as written, but drizzled the tiniest bit of sesame seed oil on it for a little extra depth. It helped.

Wow! My neighbor greeted me this morning with a bag of fresh green beans from his garden. I was hoping to find something special to do with them. And...I found it! I made it exactly as written except I substituted Extra Virgin Olive Oil for the vegetable oil. It is delicious as written and I will definitely make this again!

I made this for my New Year's buffet. Delicious and easy, but five minutes cooking time results in a limp bean.

I want to give this 3.5 forks. It is deee-licious! Served it on the deck with seared albacore tuna, roasted yams with rosemary, and a nice Chardonnay. I wish every summer evening meal was so enjoyable.

Loved the nuts and the yummy dressing.

Easy and very nice change for green beans. For added kick, I added some finely chopped red chili pepper - gave it more of a Thai flavor. Loved the soy almonds - I made extra to snack on. Next time I will puree the dressing with the cilantro before tossing over the beans. Would be nice with a mixture of green and yellow beans a well.

Delicious salad, I've made it several times and people have always loved it. The "easy-to-make" description in the intro is a stretch though - as salads go, this one is time-consuming.

Rating: 4
This dish was pretty easy to prepare and came out great. All the flavors meshed quite well. The soy was subtle enough that it wasn't too salty/overpowering.

This was SO delicious! Served it with Peruvian chicken (from this site) and our guests really liked it. I love the soy-glazed almonds. I think I could just eat those as a snack by themselves, too.

Rating: 3
This was very tasty. I didn't add the almonds or cilantro because I didn't have either but the the vinagrette is very flavourful. I omitted the vegetable oil and used sesame oil as recommended. Was perfect.

Rating: 4
The crowd enjoyed it! Very pretty splash of green amongst the other BBQ dishes: and so tasty, especially at room temp as instructed. Only one issue for my double-recipe effort: the time it takes to cut and chop so many items. In a time crunch, I would opt for purchasing tamari almonds and ginger paste.

These were O.K., but the flavors didn't blend enough for my taste.

Wonderful. I took it for a Christmas dinner and the asian tangy flavors were very refreshing and a great compliment to the traditional Christmas dinner. Got rave reviews and will definitely make it again.

Simple and delicious. I added some fresh mint which was also a nice touch.

What a fine recipe. Who would have thought of combining cilantro and green beans?! Confession - I should not have rated it 4-forks because I did modify the recipe a little as I made it. My husband and guests loved it.

I've made this recipe several times and each time I can't believe how easy and tasty it is. Great summer veggy ideal for picnics and BBQ's

Super. I did not have very many fresh beans, so I tossed in frozen peas (defrosted of course). The home made tamari almonds were a treat, something I will use as a garnish for many dishes.

Rating: 4
For fellow lazy cooks out there: This worked well using Trader Joe's Frozen Organic Green Beans and TJ's Tamari Almonds, which I had on hand. I did have garden fresh cilantro and green onions. I'll try it again later in the summer with fresh green beans and almonds I prepare myself and report how it compares.

Delicious, would not change a thing. The soy-almonds would make a great vegan substitute for bacon bits.

Absolutely a snap to make and it tastes so yummy!

Wow, I can't get enough of this, and I am generally not a a green bean fan. Even better a day or two later after the flavours have had more time to meld. Not your typical cold bean salad which so often has a vinegary-acidic spin. Delicious!!!

This is a great dish, and so easy. I use other green vegies too when in season. Snow Peas, Beans, Asparagus all good

Wow! My new favorite green bean dish ever, I could eat an entire bowl of these for a meal! Everyone LOVES them!

Rating: 4
Very tasty! Served it with Grilled-Asian Style Salmon which also used ginger, sesame oil, rice vinegar and soy sauce. The tastes melded well.

Rating: 4
I must agree with everyone here. This is very different and tasty. I get so many beans from my garden this is a nice way to shake them up. The sesame oil is the better oil for this.

Rating: 4
This amazing! While I was making it, my husband seemed a little nervous that I wasn't cooking the beans long enough, not sure he'd like the crisp-tender texture. Then when he realized it would be served at room temp was quite concerned it would be a turn off for our guests. But once everyone tasted it, the LOVED it! Will definitely do this again. (p.s., I used sliced almonds, which soaked up too much of the soy sauce and were just a little too salty. Be sure to use the whole almonds, then chop them up before serving)

Rating: 4
Absolutely wonderful! The combination of soy, crunchy almonds, cilantro and ginger with the fresh green beans is fantastic.This will certainly be a repeat in our house when I need a side dish or salad to complement an Asian themed meal.

Rating: 4
YUM! When I saw this recipe had a 4 fork rating with 98% making it again I knew I had a winner. Took it to a cookout and everyone was asking "who made the green beans?" Only change I made was to use slivered almonds and didn't chop them.

Rating: 4
I can't get enough of this salad. Very strong flavours but so yummy. The soy glazed almonds are great for snacking as well.

So easy and delish! Use the sesame oil if you have it. Great way to get kids to eat veggies, and adults too!

Rating: 4
Only problem was that there were no leftovers! Next time I'll use at least 2 pounds of green beans!

Rating: 3
This was terrific ... a great way to use local beans in season. I love the Asian flavors. I made a mistake in starting the almonds in a cast-iron pan, though -- use a nonstick or you'll get burning soy sauce.

Rating: 4
Excellent! Some of my favorite flavors--soy, ginger and cilantro. I chopped the almonds prior to the soy-glaze which I would recommend if you would like a more soy-infused flavor.

Rating: 4
This was faboo!! I definitely recommend adding broccoli - in fact I think it would be great with JUST broccoli! I doubled the dressing - other than that - I didn't change a thing. YUM! This is a keeper for sure! :)

Rating: 4
I thought I had more green beans than I did so I threw in some broccoli as well. And I thought that a red pepper chopped would add nice crunch and color, and was I right! Very delicious with bbq fare. I loved the ginger and cilantro combo. A tip: I should have squeezed or patted dry the veggies. I had a bit too much water going on in the bottom of my bowl b/c I was anxious to try it!

Rating: 4
This was fabulous! So fresh tasting and so many yummy flavours - I've been raving about it to everyone ever since, I'd definitely make this one again

Rating: 4
This one made it into the "company good" file! My husband started eating the soy almonds before they went into the salad! He was also disappointed that I halved this recipe for two people. I followed everything exactly but I did not use whole almonds. I bought sliced almond slivers from the baking isle and they worked just fine. Will definitely make again!

Rating: 3
This was very good. The only change I made was to use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil - I think it would have been lacking in flavor otherwise. I thought about adding more ginger, but luckily I added what the recipe called for b/c it just right (may have something to do with freshness of the ginger - mine was pretty strong).

Rating: 4
Such a WONDERFUL way to spice up green beans. The nuts were tasty and added a nice crunch to the green beans. And the flavor - just delicious! My husband who isn't too big on green beans loved it and ate every last bean in the serving dish! I made this with the Mahimahi with Ginger-Soy Sauce recipe on this website. (This took the place of making the stir fry veggies.) This is a must for any dinner party.

We really enjoyed this salad. It was light, but bursting with flavor. I used yellow beans, and they worked well with the cilantro.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was an incredible mix of flavors. Guests had second helpings. Easy to make, and can be prepared in advance.

We liked this. I doubled the almonds and added salt before serving. Be sure to use skinny green beans. Also, I cut them longer than 1 inch, which I think made for better presentation.

Rating: 3
Who knew what a nice mix of flavors this would bring? I only had sliced almonds in the house, so I used them, rather than starting with whole almonds. It worked just fine, although I used less soy sauce than the recipe calls for (just enough to coat each slice). I'd also steamed the beans the night before, and "day old" worked just fine. This is a perfect complement for cold poached salmon on a hot summer night.

Rating: 3
Great summer recipe. Light with lots of flavor. I was concerned the almonds would be too salty, but once added to the dish they are great. I used sliced almonds instead of whole and also boiled some red potatoes, marinated them in olive oil and rice wine vinegar. Great addition. I also think you could add chicken if you wanted to make this a full lunch. Great dish!

Rating: 4
This was great! The dressing is great for green beans. I used 1/2 toasted sesame oil and 1/2 olive oil which enhanced the oriental flavors without being too powerful.

Rating: 4
This dish is fantastic, takes ordinary green beans to a whole new level! I added a little bit of sesame oil, which gave it even more of an oriental flavor. I have made it 4 times for four different groups of people, all of them loved it!

Splendid! Perfect use of my favorite vegetable. Goes nicely with seafood and / or oriental flavors.

Love this.. great flavours. Add the almonds just before serving so that they stay crisp and maintain the soy glaze.

I was skeptical despite the rave reviews but took it to a potluck and everyone raved. A Taiwanese friends said it tasted like something her mother would make! I gave it 4 forks because it was so easy, especially since I used sliced almonds. Red onions worked fine in place of scallions and added color.

I have made this recipe twice in 2 weeks. Very good. The second time I made it I used asparagus instead of green beans. My husband couldn't get enough. I also used Sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, like others have said.

I don't know what the last person did with this recipe, but I thought it was fabulous. I suggest increasing the dressing by 1/2 and you get a nice kick. The cilantro also really adds to the dish. I brought this to a potluck recently and people scraped the bowl clean.

I don't know. Maybe sense of taste was off or something, but I found this salad to be pretty awful. I made it because I love every ingredient in it, but I found it dry and not a bit palatable. I actually threw it away. Oh well! You win some, you lose some.

I followed the user recommendation with the sesame / canola substitute for the vegetable oil. I also added a little extra minced ginger and a few extra almonds. This salad was the only one eaten to the bottom of the serving dish at the party! Rave reviews from my friends and family!

Excellent find! We added bow tie pasta to stretch it, and also agree that using sesame oil perfected it. We have added this to our personal recipe files.

I'm on my way to a 4th of July picnic...I am reviewing this before I have people even try it... But I have to say that the plate I put aside to try was fantastic.!!! Wow what a blend of flavors! Simple, yet SO flavorful and a fun way to prepare green beans. So if your looking for a fun twist on a side dish.....PLEASE go ahead and try----you wont be disappointed!!! p.s. the only thing I changed was by a previous review was to use sesame oil...I used 1/2 sesame and 1/2 canola..I dont believe it compromised the dish but only made it more flavorful!

This is why I love Epicurious. This plain-looking recipe didn't look special, but the rave reviews tempted me to try it. And it's addictive! I omitted the oil to cut down on the fat and didn't miss it at all. I used sliced almonds because that's what I had, and it worked great -- no chopping needed! Finally, as a biased cilantro lover, I highly recommend that you not replace it with parsley :)

Rating: 4
I brought this dish as my Thanksgiving contribution based on the rave reviews...and it was a big hit. However, I caution against adding more cilantro, garlic and ginger if you only are doubling the recipe. I put way too much in and I thought the salad had too much bite after melding for awhile. Luckily that was just at the bottom. I used canola oil, which was fine but will mix with sesame next time to see if it helps. Hard to think this recipe needs embellishment. I've had three requests for it already. A keeper!

Rating: 4
A trully excellent way to prepare green beans. I, like a few others, did add more ginger than was called for. I catered a wedding and used this as a side, everyone went crazy for it.

Rating: 3
This dish is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. Delicious! I took the advice of other reviewers and used sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil, but made no other substitutions. I can't imagine that it would have tasted so good with regular oil. This is going to become a regular--all that great taste, and low-cal, lo-fat to boot. Can't beat it!

Absolutely fabulous and great to prep ahead of time!

Rating: 4
Wow! We have made this three times in one week. The almonds make this dish. One word of warning -- remove the almonds IMMEDIATELY from the pan when the soy evaporates, or they will stick. Can't wait to try this in the late wummer with fresh beans from our garden...

This is our favorite Bon Appetit recipe. We have served it to company, carried it to "pitch in" dinners and have always received rave reviews. My husband has modified the recipe over the past five years by substituting sesame oil and by adding more almonds, garlic, and ginger.

Simplicity with incredible results is always a sign of a successful recipe, no matter what is involved. This recipe meets all of the above requirements. Like other reviewers I increased the ginger and garlic by at least double. This is purely a matter of taste. No pun intended.

I have already made this a few times - both as a quick side dish for home meals and to take to gatherings and parties. The flavors are well balanced, and the prep time is so minimal.
