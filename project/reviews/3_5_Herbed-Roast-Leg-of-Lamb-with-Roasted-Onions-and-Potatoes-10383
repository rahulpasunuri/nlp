Yum. This is my go to recipe for lamb. Always turns out good.

Not a difficult recipe, and very rewarding. The whole family loved it, kids, teens, adult friends, and my hubby too. I have passed this recipe on to many friends. Sure is an improvement over the roast beast I grew up with!

Very good-I am not a lamb lover and I liked it-my partner, a lamb lover-stated delicious!

Quite good. We used a three pound leg of lamb. Since we had lots of extra marinade, we brushed it on every hour before cooking, and then every 20 minutes after putting it in the oven. I forgot to turn the oven down for quite some time but the lamb was none the worse for the wear! Very impressive, nicely dark gravy.

Wow, what a tasty way to do lamb! The trick seems to be to let the onions cook as long as possible without having them burn. They add a wonderful flavor.

This was very tasty, and I did not get a particularly good cut of lamb and it still was very delicious. I do concur with others who said 140 degree internal temp was too rare. Also, my pan was too crowded with potatoes and onions--you should use a really large pan or fewer veggies. The carrot did not get soft enough to put through a sieve for the sauce--(I ended up using one of the those handheld processors to puree it) perhaps they should have been parboiled ahead of time but the sauce was just divine, very dark and rich. I think this would make a nice recipe for lamb on the grill as well--minus the veggies.

This was very good and I may make again. So many other recipes to try. You definitely need a meat thermometer and you will definitely have to cook it longer than required. I had a 4lb. leg deboned and at 2 hrs. it was still pink in the middle which was fine. My company didn't like it pink but I did so it worked out okay as the outside slices were cooked enough. The potatoes as small as they were took a bit more than an hour to cook. I did not parboil them. I did take the skins off the onions and they could have used another 15 minutes. All in All I would make this again. The gravy was very dark but good...I would not say fantastic. The carrots are hard to mash to you might want to have your food processor ready to grind them up. By the way, my 4 lb bonesless roast was more than enough for 4 people so I dare say that 8 lbs of meat would feed 10 easy.

I make this for Easter every year and people who don't normally like lamb love it. Suggestions..I like New Zealand 3-5 lb lambs better than American lamb. I marinated lamb in Pinot Noir wine (because that's what we were having with dinner) with herbs, 6 -8 cloves garlic, mustard etc for 24 hours. I also toss potatoes and veggies in marinade. To get the lamb to come out perfectly, I use Taylor's digital thermometer that beeps me when it is at 140 degrees so I don't overcook it (you can find at Target for about $20). This is an easy meal to make and lets the hostess relax with guests while it is cooking.

The lamb was succulent and delicious. It was enjoyed by all for Easter dinner.

I made it for Easter luncheon and it was a big hit. I forgot to marinate the lamb the night before, so I just put all the marinade on the lamb at once. It was still tasty. Cooking the potatoes, onions, and carrots along with the meat saved the trouble of having to make a separate vegetable dish. A couple of suggestions: I put some white wine in the pan at the outset, since I was afraid it would otherwise be too dry. Also, I agree with the reviewer who said the cooking time is way too little unless you want the meat REALLY rare.

Nice and easy. I found it needed a bit more than 1.25hrs in the oven though. Also toss the veggies with some herbs as it ends up really just being roasted vegetables in oil.

The mustard mix adds a nice flavor to the lamb, but is not nearly as potent as you might think. Two bits of advice: -get the butcher to trim & debone the lamb for you if at all possible! -note that the onions are listed in ingredients as already blanched & peeled. That's because this is a colossal PAIN. Buy a bag of frozen pearl onions and be done!

Made this for New Year's Eve dinner and it was delicious! I had some mild changes - used 1 large onion and cut it into large pieces, and I did not blanch the onions or boil the potatoes. However, I did overcook it because I was nervous about the lamb being too rare. 140 degrees is probably the perfect temp; I cooked until it was 160. Way too much.

Excellent. I added a bit more garlic because one clove seemed too little. Otherwise, I followed recipe to the letter. The recipe is really easy and my family raved. We are looking forward to the leftovers for tonight.

Wow this was good. Made it for Easter dinner. Also served spring vegetables with shallots and lemon, asparagus and leek soup for a starter and key lime pie with almond crumb crust for dessert. Kids and adults all raved.

This was fabulous! Our lamb was so tasty...I didn't roast potatoes (did a gratin instead) but roasted veggies underneath the lamb and used the juices for the gravy. Wonderful! Big hit at our Easter dinner this year.

The best lamb I have ever made. The recommended time for roasting is perfect for rosy meat. The vegetables are fantastic, just adjust the amounts specified. Two ten oz. packages of pearl onions are sufficient and all the potatoes don't fit in a normal roasting pan with the lamb.

I prepared this dish on Palm Sunday for my family. I never had so many compliments on my lamb roast before. There were no leftovers. It was delicious.

The marinade and gravy technique in this recipe are identical to the one I've been using since 1980 from Julia's "The French Chef" cookbook (Pages 406-408). It was the first leg of lamb I ever had, at the home of a friend, and have been making it at least twice a year ever since. I tried this version yesterday for Sunday dinner for four and loved it even more. Marinated a 4.5 lb. boneless leg overnight in ziploc bag, tossed the parboiled onions in the marinade too, and used whole baby new potatoes precooked for just 5 minutes. No need to mash the carrots - just strain them out of the gravy. Used madeira instead of a dry red wine - the sauce was fabulous. The four of us ate heartily and have enough leftover for just two sandwiches.

Being a huge fan of lamb I've tried many different recipes over the years and this one is my new favorite. The ooh's and aah's are the table went on all through the dinner; the veggies coming out so tasty is a bonus I didn't expect. The only thing I found difficult was the idea of mashing the carrots, which were still firm, through a sieve. Decided instead to serve the carrots on the side - the gravy was still excellent.

My boyfriend and I love lamb and this was one of the most flavorful marinade's I've had. Made according to the recipe - I did use the dried herbs and it seemed just fine. It was even better as leftovers the next day!

I made this dish for only 5 people for dinner. There wasn't a potatoe or onion left!! The marinade flavors these vegetable wonderfully. Definately marinate it overnight.

I've made this several times. For a casual dinner I use a boned leg and marinate the lamb in a ziploc bag overnight. One of my favorite meals is Shepherds Pie and I sometimes make this just for the leftover gravy and meat for Shepherd's Pie. I like it with the bone for Easter Dinner. I think its really easy and foolproof.

The marinade smelled good, but even after marinating for 3 straight days the lamb still tasted like farmyard. If you really like lamb, you'll like this, but if you're at all iffy about lamb, when you're done with this recipe you'll never want lamb again.

I was pleased with the flavour of the lamb, but I kept brushing on the rosemary-Dijon paste well into the cooking time, as a baste. Next time I will use a boned leg because it carves better. The potatoes weren't as roasted as I like, probably because there is so much in the roasting pan, it is difficult to stir the veggies around. A cheff friend that was at dinner did the gravy by mashing the carrots with a potato masher while still in the pan, then adding the wine and stock, then straining. I served the lamb with three onion couscous (from the braised shank recipe on this site) and spooned the gravy over both. Not spectacular considering the cost, but I would make it again.

I made this for X'mas dinner and everyone loved it! It's simple to make, very flavourful and the gravy was great!

This was ok. Nothing spectacular. My family didn't rave. I was disappointed with the flavor of the potatoes, very bland and watery. I can't honestly figure out what everyone is raving over.

I used this recipe for the preparation of the lamb only. I omitted the vegetables, except that I added 2 bunches of baby carrots at the end of the roasting. I used a boned leg of lamb and served it carved over a bed of the Curried Couscous (substituted currants for the raisins and added slivered almonds)and the Green Beans with Persimmons (great right now while they are in season). **See recipes for the Couscous and Green Beans. Keep tabs on the lamb and be sure not to cook past 140 degrees for picture perfect pink meat. I used the gravy recipe and served it on the side. I served this meal over the Christmas holiday and my guests raved! Even my pickiest dinner guest gobbled up two plates. The lamb was succulent and tender and the combination of all three recipes' flavors and textures was just wonderful! These recipes were not complicated and with a little advance work, it was a pleasure to cook and serve.

I served this dish for Christmas, and it received rave reviews from everyone, even my husband who dislikes lamb. I added another clove of garlic to the rub with excellent results. Very aromatic, juicy, flavorful.

I made this dish for Passover and everyone raved about it. I just substituted potato starch instead of the flour to thicken the gravy, so it was OK for Passover. It didn't affect the flavor at all. I will definately make this again for other holiday meals.

The roasted vegetables really complemented the excellent lamb. Served with a nice rosemary-mint jelly.
