I forgot. I also add a very good amount of cayenne, and use about 4 bay leaves, as well.

I use this recipe as a standard "base" for the dish, which is excellent. I just doctor it up a bit: two lg. peppers, double the celery, chopped full head of flat parsley, half a head of garlic. I also seriously ramp up the spice: full T of cumin, full heaping T of cajun seasoning, full T or more of paprika, additions of garlic and onion powder, heaping t of Aleppo red pepper, t of red pepper flakes. In addition, I omit the chic broth, and use a bottle of clam juice. Once the vegetables are cooked soft, add a couple of T of tomato paste, fry to dissolved w/ veg. Then add tomatoes. Don't drain the tomatoes. Add clam broth. Also add can of chopped green chiles, and a can of "hot" Goya tomato sauce. Reduce sauce on high simmer for about 1/2 hour b/f I add shrimp. Serve w/ hot rice and crusty good bread, tossed salad. I find that a lovely medium red (tonight it was a Seattle pinot noir) complements it well.

I eliminated the bell peppers because I don't like them and added 1 can of el pato tomatoe sauce (sm can), I can rotel tomatoes,onions and chile peppers. Instead of whole tomates, I used crushed. For more flavor, 1 Tbl cumin and creole seasoning to taste. This then became the shrimp creole I remember as a child that my mother used to make. It is wonderful over rice and the added cumin adds the flavor others were missing in their reviews

Quite good, but skip the chicken broth and don't drain tomatos- thyme and paprika (about 1 tsp each) perk things up. I like to make a broth from the shrimp shells to cook the rice in.

This reciepe made to specs is no where near what I have expected from Cajun Shrimp Creole. Way to bland. After making it I spiced it up with more jalapenos, Cajun seasoning, cayanne pepper. I will not make it again and will be looking for other receipes.

Very satisfying and tasty! I just added a 1/4 cup of freshly chopped parsley as a garnish.

This was ok, but I keep looking for other shrimp creole recipes.

Loved this! My modifications: I used one can of Fire Roasted diced tomatoes and one can of regular diced tomatoes. Also added about 1/2 of a small can of green chilies. Used one cup of chicken broth and left all the juice in from the tomatoes. When I make this again, I'll spice it up a little more by adding some Cayenne pepper. Served with green salad, crusty bread and wine.

Made this for our Asian exchange student who wanted something veggie/ricey/spicy. I subbed cayenne pepper for the black pepper and then put the cayenne shaker on the table. My son and him doused it with hot pepper and gobbled up two large helpings happily. I made a generous portion of this, used extra veggies, seafood stock and organic crushed can tomatoes and one homegrown diced tomato as well. Very satisfying meal.

great recipe; better the second day. I used a whole red and green pepper, added a minced jalapeno, used 1 8oz. bottle of clam juice instead of chicken broth, added 1T. of chipotle Tabasco, and 1T. lemon zest. Served with cheddar corn muffins.

This was good but like others, I think I was expecting a bit more..creole, I don't know. After reading reviews I added more garlic, parsley, and hot sauce. It was good (my husband had seconds) and I'll make it again, but will probably continue to tweak it.

This is a great recipe.. the taste is fresh..Not filled with flour, and not hot! This is a regular at our home now...

This is good, but it definitely needs GARLIC and also some cayenne.....

I followed the recipe to the letter until time to add the shrimp, and found it quite dull. I added a tablespoon of Creole seasoning and a cup of chopped parsley, which helped. Next time I will cut the chicken broth to 1 cup, add the juices along with the tomatoes, and add a tablespoon or two of tomato paste.

I added a fresh jalepeno when I added the peppers and it gave the dish the kick it needed...will definately make a again

This is a great vegetarian dish to serve to guests. Great flavor!! I substituted 1 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes with garlic and 1 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes with mild green chilies...both undrained. And used crab meat and shrimp...VERY GOOD TOO!

This was truly a delicious meal. I reduced the chicken broth to 1 cup and added two tablespoons of tomato paste to the sauce, it turned out perfect, no need for additional thickening. Glad I read the reviews before making the recipe, thanks for the tips!

Although this recipe is attributed to me, I never submitted this recipe. I did, however, submit an original recipe for paella which was published in Gourmet around the same time. I would never make a shrimp creole without garlic!!

I thought that it was quite good and very easy to make. However, I added garlic and a little parsley. My family adored it.

A good recipe and easy depending if you wanted to buy frozen shrimp. (We have all done this at some time.) I added 4 Tbsp of cornstarch, creole seasoning, fresh parsley, and some tabasco.

A delicious meal! I did make a few changes, though -- I used a whole green bell pepper, added 4 green onions, a handful of chopped parsley, can of tomato paste, and a whole lot of Emeril's Essence and cayenne pepper. (I also coated the shrimp with the Essence and let them sit while the rest of the dish was cooking.) Also, I threw the shrimp heads and shells into the boiling water I used to make the chicken stock (then strained it, of course) -- it added more flavor to the dish. I loved it the night I cooked it, but it tasted even better the next day.

I served this at my Bunco party and received lots of compliments! I was running behind, so I left out the celery and really didn't miss it. After 30 minutes of simmering it was still a bit soupy for my taste (probably because I doubled the recipe), so I added some tomato paste to thicken it up. Next time I'll probably start with 1 c. of broth and add more if it needs it. Very good!

My fiancee asks for this recipie over and over again. His family has copied it and served it to company. I make the recipie according to the directions and put hot sauce on the side so people can tailor the amount of hotness. Also, goes great with an ice cold beer in the summer time!

I made several additions to the recipe to give it more of a spicy cajun flavor. I added "Emerils Essence" to the shrimp prior to adding them to the sauce, and tabasco to the sauce. Gave it just the right amount of heat. I omitted the chicken broth and used vegetable broth instead. Otherwise it was excellent and I will definitely make it again.

This is a fairly easy recipe for a tasty dish. I added some chili powder and hot sauce for some extra kick. I used just one large red bell pepper and canned diced tomatoes to make my life a little easier. I also used frozen shrimp (a crime, i know, but some of us are on a budget).

This is a good recipe for company since you can have so much of the prep work done before hand. I do suggest adding tobasco and/or Tony's (cajun spice) or atleast put a BIG bottle of hot sauce on the table. I doubled the recipe for a party of 8 and had lots of compliments and yet plenty of leftovers.

A nice dish for the minimal prep involved. Not as good as Mom's creole, but few things in life are...

I tripled this recipe for a 15-person dinner party and had enough leftovers for dinner for 4. Everyone loved it! I substituted saffron rice. The bulk of the recipe can be made hours ahead and heating just before serving. Peeling shrimp is tiresome, but the rest of this recipe is easy.

besides peeling shrimp, it's a quick and tasty meal; it's also easy to adjust for more or fewer servings.
