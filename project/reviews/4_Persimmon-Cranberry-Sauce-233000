This was beautiful - easy to do ahead -- and people loved it! I used the lower amount of sugar, which was perfect. I will definitely do this again next Thanksgiving.

I've made this dish the past two Thanksgivings and it is delicious! The blended textures are wonderful and the star anise adds a depth of flavor. I considered making something else this year and my family insisted I bring this again!

Wow - what a pleasant surprise! Turned out delicious and I don't like fresh cranberry sauce. Really like the persimmons in the dish. Was my son's favorite dish at Thanksgiving!

This is really awesome sauce--best I've ever had. I tripled the recipe and added sugar to taste. I have a very sweet tooth but that said, I still don't think I added as much as the recipe calls for. Add sugar to taste!

We thought this was perfect just as written. It does lend itself easily to whatever you wish to stir in. Husband requested pomegranate, and I thought tiny cubes of ripe pear would be good. I tossed those in along with the persimmon. Still wonderful.

We had this for Thanksgiving this year and it was a wonderful addition to a good overall meal prepared by several cooks. One guest felt it was the best dish on the table! It won't disappoint.

I have made this every Thanksgiving since 2006 and get rave reviews every time. I make it exactly as specified and it turns out incredible every time. Last year I tried it with Splenda instead of sugar and it worked out just as well, but the sugar version does taste better.

Couldn't agree more with drahert...the subtle cherry/vanilla flavor was there. Absolutely a highlight side dish to any holiday meal. Made it exactly as specified, if you omit the anise, you are missing the point.

This is hands-down the most delicious recipe for cranberry sauce I have tried. It has a perfectly balanced flavor. The star anise lends an unexpected but welcome dimension to this sauce. I have received many pleasantly surprised reactions to this sauce.

Absolutely delicious!

Made this for Thanksgiving. Absolutely superb! In lieu of star- anise, I bundled up 1/4 tsp of anise seed in cheesecloth. I left the sauce to come to room temperature, then folded in the persimmons just prior to serving. I will make this often and would recommend it without hesitation!

The star anise imparts the sauce a flavor of cherry and vanilla, not at all like licorice. I loved it and am making it again this Thanksgiving.

Lovely cranberry sauce...the aniseed works a treat with cranberry.

This was part of the Thanksgiving dinner this year, and everybody loved it. I don't like anise, so I left it out but it really didn't matter. I used only 1/2 cup of sugar, which made for a nice balance of sweet and tart.

Beautiful jewel like hue is right! This was so beautiful on my thanksgiving table and so so so delicious with my tofurkey (turkey eaters raved as well...). I didn't have any anise, so I substituted maybe an 1/8 of a teaspoon of anise flavoring. I also added a cinnamon stick, and a bit of dried orange peel. I am making this every year...

Wonderful recipes that yielded a beautiful presentaion. Substituted Splenda for sugar and was happy witht he results. Served with roasted chicken and zucchini. The zucchini really absorbs the great sauce.

I used much less sugar. It was good the first day, but sublime the second and third after the persimmons soaked up the cranberry juices.

Just about the best cranberry sauce I have made, receiving loads of praise from our guests.

3+ stars. This was easy and delicious. The berries were soft, but retained their form, and were a perfect compliment to the firm persimmons. I will make it again next year

This is the firsr cranberry sauce I have ever liked! I cut the sugar back just a bit as the persimmons add a LOT of sweetness. No one could identify the persimmons, but all agreed it was delish.

I loved the colors. And I was ready for something delightful and surprising. The surprise turned out to be the disappointing results. The 3 Fuyu persimmon were not at all tasty and thus neither was the sauce.

This is a fantastic cranberry sauce recipe. The persimmons are a great addition. I had never had persimmons, and I am now very glad that I tried them, especially in combination with the tart cranberries. I could not find star anise, so I put about a teaspoon of anise seeds in a tea bag and simmered it with the sauce. Not really sure if it worked...the sauce was awesome none-the-less. I was unsure at first about the amount of liquid to simmer the cranberries in...it didn't seem like enough, but it was and it turned out great. The other sauces I have made had a more blended consistency, but this one had a lot more whole berries left after simmering, which was interesting to me, and very good. Didn't need to add any extra sugar...when I tasted it it was perfectly tart and not overly sweet. Ideal for me. I will most definitely make this one again.

I love persimmons as well as cranberry sauce, so this dish was perfect for me. The star ansie added an almost smoky flavor when combined with the wine. A great addition to my thanksgiving recipies.

Well, I made this dish because I have never eaten a persimmon before, and wanted a cranberry dish to go with turkey. This was so easy to make, and the persimmons were a delicous contrast to the cranberries. I did add the additional sugar to mine. I would probably make this again because it was so quick and easy, but it wasn't the best cranberry sauce I have ever had.
