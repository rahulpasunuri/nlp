I took a chance on this recipe in an attempt to do something different for Easter dinner. It was fabulous. I used beautiful locally raised Wisconsin lamb, followed the recipe exactly as printed, and served the lamb with a wonderful homemade mango chutney. Do try this delicious dish!

Easter 2012. 4-3/4 lb bone-in lamb fed 4 HUNGRY ppl with a bit left over for next day snacking. I'll halve the salt when I make it again, which I most certainly will. Excellent flavor.

This recipe was good, but not quite as good as I expected. I can't imagine what it would have tasted like with 4 teaspoons of salt! I only used 2, and that was plenty. The potatoes turned out well, but the lamb wasn't really that out of the ordinary.

I cannot believe more people haven't made and reviewed this wonderful recipe! This was one of the best lamb dishes I've ever made, and I eat a lot of lamb. I used a boneless, rolled, 4 lb roast and skipped the potatoes. It was amazingly tender, and smelled and tasted divine. Our guests raved about it.

Absolutely delicious. My guests loved it. Because of a screw up at our local market, I only had 3 hours to marinate it, and it was still fabulous. I am too lazy to use a mortar & pestle, so I used a mini cuisinart and it was fine. This was my first time using a bone-in leg of lamb, and it was difficult to slice, so next time I'll try boneless.

Best dish ever. You have to finely chop the rosemary before putting it in the mortar/pestle: my first read of the recipe I thought only the additional 2 tablespoons were minced. Although leg of lamb is expensive we got at least 10 servings out of our 6 lb leg, including some delicious cold lamb sandwiches. This is a new favorite!

I made this for Easter 2010. It was absolutely the best leg of lamb I have ever made. It will be the only leg of lamb recipe I will make from now on.

This was my first attempt at lamb and it was easy & didn't make a big mess. I used the 'Roasted Potatoes with Garlic, Lemon & Oregano' recipe and dumped them into the pan with the lamb. Served them with roasted asparagus with feta. Delicious!

Didn't make the potatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe. It turned out really well. Everyone really enjoyed it, and it came out very juicy. I don't normally like lamb, but this recipe may have converted me. Certainly, will make this again.

Made this as part of an Easter menu and it was a hit! I also used a butterflied boneless leg of lamb. Marinated it for about 5-6 hours, then rolled and tied it up. Baked it at 425 for 20-25 minutes, then decreased oven temp. The marinade flavor was excellent, but not overpowering. My guests raved about it and had second and third helpings of the meat. Didn't make the potatoes as suggested. Instead, I made the roasted potatoes with garlic, lemon and oregano recipe from this site. But instead of using chicken or beef stock, I used the pan drippings from the roast and cooked the potatoes while the roast was resting. (If you do this, pour the drippings into a container from which you can skim the fat.) Will definitely be making this again.

I prepared the lamb exactly as described - but did not do the potato step as I was making lemon roasted potatoes. I served this for a dinner party to some non lamb eaters and it was a hit. Would definitely make again and ensure that you make a day head.

This was delicious, be careful not to overcook the lamb. And the potatoes are scrumptious!
