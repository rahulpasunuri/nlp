I added about 3Tbs of raw sugar, used powdered buttermilk & one cup water. This was one of the best corn breads I've ever made! Will definitely make this recipe again.

A good basic cornbread if you don't like the sweet variety. Works well with the Creamed Oyster Dish and would be a good dense one for cornbread stuffing.

Awful cornbread, dense, pastey, bland, Don't bother.

This is a dense but wonderful cornbread. Nothing I would ever be ashamed to have said that I made the cornbread.

Where y'all from? We never put flour in our cornbread down in Louisiana! We like our cornbread to taste like CORNbread!! Here's an easy recipe: 1 cup cornmeal, 1 cup buttermilk (don't substitute), 1 t. baking powder, 1 t. salt, 2 eggs, 2 T oil. That's it!! That's all. Mixture will be thin and souply. Mix well and bake in non-stick muffin tin or non-stick skillet at 450 deg. for 20 min.

Very dry and not tasty. I made it for guests and was embarrased after I tasted it.

i LOVE THIS RECIPE. vERY MOIST INSIDE, CRISP OUTSIDE. i DO OCCASIONALLY ADD A COUPLE TBS OF SUGAR OR 1/2 CUP GRATED CHEDDAR, BUT IT IS GOOD AS IS.

I found this recipe to be very bland. If I decide to make it again, I'll take the suggestions of the other posts.

I am sure this corn bread would win 4 forks on its own but I could not resist changing the recipe to suit our tastes. I used half of an 8.5 oz can of cream-style corn and only 3/4 c buttermilk -- also added 3 T sugar. It was moist and tender with golden, crispy crust!! This will become part of my recipe file!

Really good corn bread, not sweet like lots of corn bread recipes. Excellent toasted the next day, too.

good texture, tastes like cornbread should. Next time I'll add some jalapenos for a bit of spice
