This is one of my favorites. The flavors mesh perfectly and even people that aren't crazy about lamb loved it. The sauce is great on grilled lamb and equally good on chicken. Yum.

Couldn't be easier. I found the sauce just a little cloying, being lamb and goat together, and will add even more cranberries next time for a bit more of a zing. I had also increased them this time. We both gave it 9 out of 10.

I loved this dish! The sweetness of the sauce went splendidly with the gaminess of the lamb. What made it even better was the remaining sauce will harden in the fridge to give you a scrumptious spread for a good crusty bread, all washed down with a hearty Cotes du Rhone.

Rich & delicious; quick & easy to tinker with. Instead of heavy cream & soft goat cheese, I used cream cheese & hard goat cheese; instead of basil I used rosemary. For my taste, next time I'll use more cranberries. They cut the richness somewhat.

It's very fast for being so fancy. We had it with some steamed asparagus with garlic butter, a great combination.

Amazing!! Perfect for entertaining. The sauce is so delicious that we had the left over with bread the next day as a spread.

For some reason, this sauce came out all wrong--too many conflicting flavors that detracted from the lamb. Mind you, we're generally pretty adventurous about mixing strange things, but even the cream texture didn't seem right.

How do you spell WONDERFUL!! I am so thrilled that I tried this recipe. At first, I thought twice about making the sauce, but decided to go ahead and place it on the side, instead of over the chops. After the first taste, we were going back to add more. It was the perfect entree and goes extremely well with the asparagus with gremolata butter recipe from Bon Appetit March 2003. THX!

this sauce has a great complex texture and such wonderful flavor. it will please anyone who likes goat cheese. it was yummy on this peppered lamb but I think it would be equally as good on peppered steaks or poultry. I am a garlic lover so I did add 1/4t crushed garlic but the sauce was so very tasty even without the garlic
