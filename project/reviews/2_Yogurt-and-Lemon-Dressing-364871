As the comment above the recipe indicates, this is supposed to be a Tahini-Yogurt-Lemon dressing, not just yogurt and lemon juice. The recipe must have been entered incorrectly here, but is available elsewhere. The actual recipe is as BA has it (1/2 c. yogurt, lemon juice) plus the following: 2 plump, moist garlic cloves, peeled, halved, and green germ removed 1/4 cup tahini (sesame paste) You can see how with garlic and tahini, it is much more interesting! Even just the garlic would help.

All I know is that we both had seconds, which didn't leave enough for a second night! Not amazing... but pretty darn good nonetheless.

Ew-- just ew. It's awful. And, if you are making it for the Cobb salad recipe, just DON'T. Use a good ranch or another rich, creamy dressing instead. I was smart enough to taste this before slathering it on my salad. It was sour and lifeless and just plain bad.

Had a 6 oz container of Fage fat freeGreek yogurt,added 3 scant tbsp lemon juice, the zest and salt, then tweaked with about 2 tbsp Helmans low fat mayo and some McCormick grill mate lemon pepper with herbs, will make a great dip for veggies or be good mixed in a chicken salad. maybe a liile humus mixed in would be good as a dip

A Cook: I think she's saying this dressing has replaced the tahini dressing as her favorite. :D
