I had some salmon I planned to grill, lemons, creme fraiche and dill (frozen from fresh dill). I already had pickle relish and used that instead of the cornichons, but in a smaller quantity. It probably made the sauce a bit sweeter but did add some zing and crunch. I was looking for a sauce recipe corresponding to my ingredients and this didn't disappoint. I would use it again with either grilled or poached salmon. Next time I would use the cornichons instead. In similar recipes I have replaced some creme fraiche or sour cream with plain 2% Greek yogurt to reduce the amount of fat. It works well.

used greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Excellent- salmon was super moist and delicious.

I made a simpler poaching liquid with only wine, water, dill and onion. I added horseradish to the sauce which really perked it up! I also used yogurt instead of creme fraiche.

I made this dish as a component of my mother's day feast. I made it the day before and served it cold. I was a little worried about it staying moist, but that was not a problem. It was moist and delicious. I'm not a fan of tartar sauce, sweet pickles or dill (neither is my family) but all raved about the sauce. In all fairness, I probably doubles the amount of lemon juice in it, but besides that followed the recipe. I wish I could post a picture of the platter, because it was just lovely.

The poached salmon itself is just okay, but the sauce makes it really tasty. Mine was done after 9 minutes in the pan. The fish guy at Whole Foods told me to make sure to have the salmon at room temp before dropping it in the pan. Super easy recipe.

Extremely easy and tasty. The clam juice added subtle sea salty flavor. Now I make a big batch, and use a few on salads the next day. Guests are impressed

this is the best! i made it for my boyfriend and he loved it! he said it was the best meal he had in years. I couldn't find the clam juice - despite going to 4 different grocery stores, so i ommitted it - but still delicious and fabulous!

I don't understand the aversion to cornichons...I feel like they really make the dish more interesting than your usual dill and salmon dish. I'm a big fan of this, but I like it better warm. And I'd say definitely include the cornichons, at least some.

I make this each year for New Year's Eve (our annual party averages 40 people). Everyone loves it and appeciates the cornichon sauce because it's different from what you would get most anywhere else. It's also a great dish for a party because it can be prepared in advance and leftovers are easy to use.

I thought I would hate the cornichons in this because they taste so strong. I minced them and served them as an optional topping and they were all gone by the end of the dinner. Everyone, including me, loved them.

Salmon Dill and Creme Fraiche, Can't really mess that up!

My husband and I both thought it was very "blah" and would not make it again.

So easy, tasty and elegant! I left out the cornichons and served the fish warm. I made the dish the night before and served it the next night. Effortless and elegant! A perfect recipe for entertaining. Do give this recipe a try--fabulous. (But I do recommend that the cornichons be omitted). Note: I served it the next night chilled--my husband and I much preferred it served warm.

We didn't like this recipe at all! The combination of flavors overpowered the salmon - way too strong for us.

This is a wonderful buffet dish. It looks great and tastes marvellous.
