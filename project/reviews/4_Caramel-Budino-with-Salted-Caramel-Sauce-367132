Each individual element is very good: the pudding is great and has the perfect boozy hit, the caramel sauce is good & easy but requires a bit more salt. The chocolate cookie clashes with the other components. When combined, it all became much too sweet. I could see making the pudding again and serving it w/ a gingersnap base and no caramel, maybe? My guests enjoyed & complimented it, but for me it was just alright.

I forgot to add that mine set up in less than 5 hours, the quantities produced are surprisingly accurate, and the result was both pretty and delicious. You'll end up with 4 layers of different colors. The first time we had this at the restaurant it reminded me of a fantastic version of a horrible dessert that used to be a very popular potluck dish at my office. It was called "Pail of Worms" or "Pail of Mud" or something like that.

This is the most talked-about dessert in Philadelphia. I've ordered it at the restaurant many times and am very pleased about the results I got from this recipe. It really did taste the same. The cooking time for the various steps took longer than estimated. Perhaps because I have a regular stove, not a professional range? In my case, wherever times are noted, it took 2 - 3 x as long.

This should be made at least a day ahead, 4-5 hours wasn't enough time for it to set. Be sure to press the cookies so that they don't move when the budino is poured on top. The carmel sauce was okay but over all this recipe is just a fancy pudding. My family loved it but I wasn't overly impressed.

This was a great success and I will definitely make it again. All of the components can me made in advance, to one degree or another. I assembled the cookie crumb layer and the budino the night before and made and stored the salted caramel sauce. Whipped the cream in the afternoon of the dinner party and gently heated the caramel sauce just before serving. The pudding set up beautifully and quickly- no thermometer needed. It looks like a casual dessert but it's so much more than that. Yum.

Made this for a dinner party of 15. Doubled the recipe and followed everything to a T. Outcome...simply fabulous. The pudding is silky and rich, perfectly sweet and because I took great care in tempering my eggs, I didn't event have to go through the sieve process. This is a keeper. Easy to make, easy to store and the jars are precious too.

Delish. A must to always be a go to dessert. Love the combo of all the flavors and thought the sauce added an interesting taste. Served mine in dessert dishes which are more shallow than the mason jars. Liked it that way as you could blend all flavors and textures into one spoon full. Did not need to strain but did just in case.

This was a bit time consuming to make since I made a double batch, but it was well worth it. The budino thickens in the saucepan (I ignored the thermometer). It took a few more minutes than expected, but it suddenly thickened and became more pudding-like. Even with the whisking, I recommend filtering with the cheesecloth since there were small coagulated bits remaining. This ensures a completely smooth budino. I overcooked the caramel sauce slightly (very dark amber), but it was still delicious. I would even make the sauce on its own for other desserts too. Everyone (adults and a child) enjoyed this dessert and I would make it again.

Ok, to be fair I have not made this..but I have eaten at Ms. Turney's restaurants and this is my favorite dessert in all of Philadelphia. Hands down. Can't wait to satisfy my budino cravings with my own two hands next time!!

To N. Dakota: you really need to boil corn starch to make it set up (but not for too long or it will break down again!) Forget the thermometer. :) Good luck!

My pudding didn't set up, even though I followed the recipe to the letter and made sure that the custard reached 175 degrees F. The caramel topping, on the other hand, is divine. I plan to try the pudding recipe again tomorrow. Any suggestions out there on how I can make sure my pudding thickens properly?

My pudding didn't set up even though I followednthe recipe to the letter. It is so runny that It cn't support the caramel. The caramel, though, turned out perfectly. I am goung to try again tomorrow with the pudding, any suggestions out there.

Everyone I served this to at dinner party last night really loved it. Also don't panic... when I added the caramel to the pudding mixture, it solidified. It took a few moments of stirring and it melted back into the pudding base. Like another poster mentioned, it was easy to transport because of the mason jars. I just used their original container.

This was a hit with the discerning palates at our dinner party this evening. It was a bit challenging to coordinate, but that is part of the fun when cooking. Get your ingredients ready ahead, measure, and you'll feel successful! The serving in the mason jars made the budino easy to stoe in the fridge and to transport.

Good, but not the life-altering experience I had heard about. The salted caramel sauce verged on being too dairy rich and one dimensional. I would also like more texture; the cookie crumb base and top are good, but don't provide enough contrast to the creaminess of the rest of the elements.

Made this last night for 8 women and it was delicious! A bit time consuming, but i did the cookie and pudding the day before, then made the caramel just before dinner, let cool and heated it up just before serving. I did not strain anything and it came out well. The women left happy adn today have asked for the recipe. Brought some to work today and was cursed by colleagues for killing diets. A MUST!
