I've got a lot of hot peppers (much like Hungarian peppers but without the distinctive taste) that I'd like to use to make harissa. This is not a recipe.

For a number of years I've used the Frugal Gourmet's recipe on page 325 of his cookbook on "Our Immigrant Ancestors." It's an excellent sauce and is a staple in my house. In fact, I'm replenishing it tonight [although I halve the cayenne and double the garlic - my version follows]. Ingredients: 1 Tbs. cayenne; 1 Tbs. ground cumin; 4 garlic cloves, peeled; 1/2 tsp. salt; 1 cup olive oil; Procedure: Using a mortar and pestle, crush the spices, garlic and salt together to form a paste. Heat a frying pan, add the olive oil, and spice mixture [I add them when the pan is cold so they don't spatter]. Cook, stirring constantly over medium heat, for five minutes [I count the five minutes from when it starts bubbling]. Serve with couscous dishes.

This is not a recipe for Harissa. It is an explanation of how to buy a sub standard product and shove some chilli in it!
