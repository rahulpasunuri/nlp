I had some leftover ricotta and this looked simple and delicious and it is! I decided to use Kahlua and I love it! I will make it again.

The first time, I made a half recipe and was sorry I didn't make the full one..it was wonderful. For an extra kick, I used coffee flavoured Brandy the next time and it was even better.

Not as firm as a custard, but delicious when combined with marsala-soaked cake and cherry compote, trifle-style. Probably not a dish we would eat just plain, but makes a good dessert sauce when you have an abundance of ricotta.

Delicious and creamy. Very easy to make and with a good coffee flavor but not too sweet. There wasn't much flavor of brandy, though. I would increase it when I make this again which I definitely will.
