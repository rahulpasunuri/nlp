I thought this dish was excellent! I added garlic powder, and dried thyme.

A melon baller on potatoes? Don't break a nail doing it. Not worth it. Believe me and Boston review. And I tried to jazz it up with a yam and curry powder. Vegetarians may appreciate this recipe however as non-meat eating can make you crave texture and flavors.

This was easy and excellent. Who knew the cauliflower and potatos would work so well together. The shape of the potatos was also a new take and they cooked up great. Try this with any kind of spice that will work with your main dish.

Prepared this dish exactly as written and it was delicious. A nice side to any meat or fish.

I seasoned this dish with garlic powder, crushed rosemary, paprika, salt and pepper. I tossed both potatoes and cauliflower together then roasted the potatoes 1/2 hour before adding the cauliflower. Normally I have a hard time serving cauliflower because it isn't colorful. This made a beautifully golden side dish that could be served with a meat or fish and a bright colored vegetable or salad.

This is simply delicious! We like it with roasted or grilled fish, poultry, beef, and it is especially nice with pork. Grilled sausages and this recipe are out of this world for complimentary flavorings! Once, I tossed the potatoes and cauliflower with some added curry powder and then roasted it according to directions for a spectacular zippy twist. Simple and a true gourmet elegance of "real" food. (Our guests request that I make this often times as well)!!

Clearly not the jazziest dish around--I might add onion powder, garlic powder, and ground coriander next time--but good, healthy, and very fast. I used garlic chives instead of regular for added interest.

This is a fast, easy, but different way to serve potatoes. My children aren't crazy about cauliflower but they enjoyed it in this mixture. I have had many requests from my kids to make this recipe again and again. The recipe can be doubled sucessfully.

This reminded me of a dish my Mom (who was Northern Italian) used to make when I was little...except that it was made with chicken in an oven....for my vegetarian family, this is a GREAT recipe !
