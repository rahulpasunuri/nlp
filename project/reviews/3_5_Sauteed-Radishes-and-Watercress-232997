Used the Radish greens instead of Watercress and added some fennel to saute with the radishes. I think I used a little bit too much butter, but they were tasty, tasty. Loved the mellow root veg taste - reminded me of rutabaga. Served with Salmon Cannelloni in Lemon Cream sauce and Unoaked Chardonnay very Mediterranean.

Surprisingly good. I had received both watercress and radishes in a vegetable box and did not know how to cook either (I am not a fan of raw radishes). This recipe made the radishes very enjoyable and tender. I used 1 bunch of radishes and used both the greens from the radishes and 1 bunch of watercress. Easy side dish with fish or chicken!

An unsung vegetable gets its due! I don't care for raw radishes, but I liked this. Made it as written, only I used some shredded Napa cabbage in place of the watercress. Very nice and out of the ordinary! I'll cut back on the oil and butter next time. Or, on the other hand, if I'm really splurging, I'll use rendered bacon grease instead.

Next time I would use a bit less salt than called for in the recipe. I substituted baby spinach for the watercress and it was absolutely delicious. Next time I will try with the radish greens as other reviewers suggested.

This is absolutely delicious.. While trimming some raw radish to eat as a snack, I wondered about the possibility of cooking the greens, since dark green leafy veggies are the new super food. I tried this recipe, exactly as written except substituting the radish greens for watercress as others have suggested. My 20 yr old son, my husband and I all LOVED it. I'll even make this for company!

This was delicious! I also used the radish greens and picked some baby mustard greens from the garden which added an additional kick. Will definitely make this again!

Surprisingly wonderful. Added a little cumin and red pepper flakes. I'll be eating a lot more radishes now.

My farmer's market is overrun with radishes right now, which I've always enjoyed raw. Never tried them cooked...and liked this preparation. I too used the radish greens instead of watercress but otherwise didn't change a thing. I loved it and can see how those who might not like radishes raw would like this. They lost their bite a bit when sauteed. Definitely will make again - what a pleasant surpise and so easy.

I'll be using this recipe from now on. I don't particularly like raw radishes and had never had cooked ones, but I loved this! I used the radish greens instead of watercress and it was delicious.

Instead of butter and olive oil, I lightly browned three pieces of guanciale, cut into half inch pieces. Then I cooked sliced black Spanish radish in the guanciale fat. Once the radish was toothsome-looking (slightly browned, somewhat translucent), I tossed in a half pound of julienned collard greens. I cooked the collards until they were bright green, and seasoned with salt and black pepper. This was certainly a great base recipe to work with, and I was happy to discover that radish could be cooked so deliciously!

This was very simple and tasty. I deviated from the recipe slightly by using the radish greens instead of watercress. I figured, since I've used radish leaves as a watercress substitute in other dishes that it was silly to discard them here. I also added a lime wedge when serving, which popped the flavors nicely.

This is not for those who like bland food, since both of the main ingredients have a little kick to them. It is, however, delcious on its own or as an accompaniment to a mild fish or poultry main course.
