Delicious! And QUITE flavorful - did Gulf Coast actually use the ingredients specified? I grilled the eggplant in my cast iron grill pan in the kitchen, rather than outside on the grill. Splendid!

My huband is growing lots of eggplant, so I am trying to learn how to use it; without frying, which we love. This is ordinary, blah, a bit of work, and hard to built a meal around. Forget it.

I love this recipe and have had great results serving it to others. I like to put the eggplant in the watercress while it's warm to slightly wilt it.

A change from the ordinary. Very good!
