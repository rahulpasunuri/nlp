You can get Szechuan peppercorns in the US. In fact, I just got some earlier this week. They can be ordered online at penzeys.com (listed as China Szechuan Peppercorns).

Szechuan pepercorns can no longer be i\mported into the USA. Tazaminian peppercorns are a reasonable alternative.

I made this to use in the Szechuan-Flavored Country-Style Spareribs. I really enjoy Szechuan flavored food but this let me down. I did however find a recipe for a Chinese Seasoned Salt on the back of the Szechuan peppercorns which I might use the next time I need Szechuan Salt-Pepper.
