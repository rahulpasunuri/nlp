Was looking for additional recipes (besides taboulleh) using bulgur wheat. So glad we tried these! They are quite tasty and reasonably healthy, and will definitely make them again. Served with the traditional tzaziki dressing. The wrapping goes pretty quickly once you get started, and I didn't have any problems with leaves tearing.

These were work, but great. Some suggestions: Pick grape brand wisely. Luckily my grocer told me that one brand he had was almost all pieces, but the other had really nice leaves for stuffing. I also discovered that if I took the leaves out a little beforehand and put in a paper towel that they separated much more easily. Also, a heaping tablespoon of filling was needed to make the rolls decently, and there still was more than enough filling for 50 rolls.

These were a fair amount of work - but very very tasty. I will never want to eat packaged vine leaves again. My greek husband loved them (even though these were not a greek adaptation of the dish). I would def make again, as I will only get better each time at wrapping

This was my first attempt making stuffed grape leaves before and although it is a bit tedious pulling grape leaves apart and patching, they came out delicious. I followed the recipe exactly except I took out some of the liquid when finished cooking. The tops that were uncovered when water was absorbed was a bit discolored. Worth the effort.
