This is the hit of every Christmas, I do a brunch for my office and then one for my family and this Torta fresh out of the oven is just delicious. I follow the recipe exactly don't change ingredients. I do cook the sausage ahead and the spinach and then mix just before I put in the oven. Wonderful!

I used hot sausage instead to give it a little kick. Next time id also add garlic. Husband enjoyed it. Would make again but wasn't blown away.

Delicious - I love the fontina cheese. Great way to use up leftover bread!

Excellent recipe - I will definitely make this again. I used a sour dough baguette and added some sauteed leek (that I wanted to use up) to the sausage and continued the recipe as written. I used an oval baking dish which is a little larger than the 8x8 called for and I am grateful that I did as it was just large enough to fit the ingredients. It was an attractive dish and just as delicious. This recipe lends itself well to substitutions - I think I will try it with other cheeses next time..

Excellent!!! A huge hit. Wouldn't change a thing. I will also make this in a larger dish so it will be a little thinner and cut into bite size cubes for an appetizer.

Wow, this is really easy and looks beautiful. The taste is fantastic and is really very easy. I have made for my family many times and it is always well recieved.

This is one sexy looking dish that tastes amazing. I added a tsp of grainy mustard to the egg mixture and cut the fat by using low fat cream and 1%. The bread on the sides of dish that stick up above the mixture get really hard so I would be careful that not much more than the crust is exposed. Next time I would try cubing the cheese that's added to the mixture instead of grating just to get those gooey bites.

This was very good - I even left out the cream.

This dish was outstanding!! My daughter had made it and told me about it. She said she thought it was a bit too rich and it had a little too much spinach in it. Instead of using 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of heavy cream, I used 1-3/4 cups of whole milk and just 1/4 cup of cream. I also only used a 7 oz. bag of baby spinach. It was absolutely perfect and totally delicious!! I would also suggest using a slightly larger baking dish as the ingredients almost spilled over the edges when I first poured in the liquids. Also, rather than using jarred roasted red peppers, I roasted my own the day before and used them. Jarred roasted red peppers are OK, but the fresh roasted red peppers really give the dish the ultimate flavor!!

I served this for breakfast during a ski weekend with friends. We all LOVED it! I too swapped the cheese for cheddar and used ff 1/2n1/2 but kept the rest the same. It was wonderful!

Rating: 4
Great recipe. I make this quite often, to rave reviews. My revisions: sharp white cheddar instead of the fontina, regular breakfast sausage, and half a loaf of hawaiian bread, diced, instead of the baguette. The hawaiian bread adds the sweetness this recipe needs and the sharp cheddar, to me, has a better flavor than fontina. I have added sage when I have it on hand. Enjoy!

Delicious as is, although if you like something a little more "strat-ish" you may want to up the bread, otherwise it is festive looking and perfect as is.

I helped my daughter in law make this for Christmas morning the first time. It was definitely a hit. For my liking it would replace her favorite holiday quiche. I am a big fan. I too might add some onion and use fat free half and half.

Made according to directions with the following changes: Substituted chorizo for the sausage; Added 2 onions, 5 cloves of garlic and 1 sweet potato- all chopped fine and roasted; Added 1 tsp each: rosemary, smoked Hungarian paprika and hot Hungarian paprika; Made custard with 9 eggs and added 1/2 marscapone cheese to egg mix; substituted skim milk for whole; Cooked in 9x12 dish. YUM and great as leftovers!

Thanks to all the other reviews, I cut back the amount of spinach but otherwise followed the receipe. This is really good, got great compliments at our New Year brunch, and is different from the usual stratas. Making it the day before is the way to go as well. This one is a keeper for me!

I almost never give 4 forks, so you know it had to be good! Made this for breakfast on Christmas morning and it was a big hit. Followed the directions exactly except I cut the spinach in half and used spicy Italian sausages. It's very colorful and pretty. It made good leftovers as well, so it could be made ahead of time and reheated.

Rating: 4
Great recipe. Easy to make and great to do ahead. It's also a forgiving recipe. I've made it with baguette, and also with a combination of Pepperidge Farm white and wheat.The cheese doesn't have to be Fontina. Use what's around: a combination of cheddar and smoked gouda is great. I back off on the milk to 1/2 cup so it doesn't take so darned long to set in the middle.

Made it exactly as is, and it was a huge hit for very fussy palates at Christmas brunch. The reds and greens make it very festive. I used Trader Joe's Sweet Italian CHICKEN sausages, and just ground them up in my food processor. Fabulous.

Rating: 4
I make this recipe all of the time using spicy beef sausage. Make sure to squeeze the liquid out of the spinach and the roasted red peppers. The leftover ingredients- fontina, spinach, sausage and peppers are great on a pizza!

Rating: 3
Based on the blog advice, I cut the spinach down to 5 oz, used spicy Italian sausage, Gruyere instead of Fontina (it's what I had handy), and whole milk instead of heavy cream. I squeezed as much liquid as possible out of the spinach and roasted peppers, but the torta was still slightly liquidy for me. Perhaps I should have baked it a little longer or in a more shallow pan? I was really worried that the pan was too small, but all of the ingredients (surprisingly) fit and didn't overflow. My guests enjoyed it and I do think the taste was very good without being too heavy. A nice dish for brunch in November!

Rating: 4
Very delicious. I made half the recipe in the same size pan, and it turned out well. Added a little garlic and rosemary, used smoked swiss because I had it on hand, and these were all tasty additions. I will definitely make this again. It would be a great, easy holiday morning breakfast.

Rating: 4
Have made this now at our B&B for a couple of months to rave reviews! I reduce the amount of fresh spinach to 6 oz just because I'm not a fan of spinach and reduce sausage to 12 oz. I also add some fresh basil, but otherwise, follow directions as is. It can also be made the night before, refrigerated and baked in the morning, but allow an additional 15-20 min. due to the coldness (cover with foil towards the end just so bread doesn't get too toasted). This recipe doubles, easily, and place in 9x13 pan.

the recipe was a little lackluster. i couldn't get it all to fit into the 8x8 pan w/o baking over. i wasn't a fan of the dish, my friends thought it was nice.

Excellent! Added mushrooms and used cheddar because I didn't have Fontina. Next time, I might add some more baguette slices around the edge, just wedge as many in there as possible because I thought the crispy bread around the edge was the best part! Yummy!

I doubled this recipe to serve 12 and there was plenty! It was a huge hit and so pretty and puffed when it comes out of the oven. I used 1/2 hot Italian sausage and 1/2 chicken Italian sausage to cut down on the richness. Made it in a 9 x 13 pan.

Rating: 4
I like! Next time: less sausage, or different type (needs a meat, but the Italian sausage flavor was a bit overpowering). I LOVED the roasted peppers, which I also roasted myself - a must over jarred, unless short on time. However, I didn't have enough peppers, so I added some leftover, chopped artichoke - very nice touch. The bread layer, I took someone's advice and baked them a bit, adding a bit of rosemary. I forgot to add the fontina cheese into the dish, and I think I'm glad - it was pretty rich without it. Overall, less sausage, more roasted vegies!

AMAZING...really good with some spicy italian sausage in there as well. I also replaced some of the fontina with smoked gouda, gave it more flavor

I made it with some good kielbasa instead of sausage. It was awesome!

Rating: 3
this was a yummy dish, but if i make it again, i'll definitely incorporate some changes. i used fat free half and half instead of cream (as i usually do now for quiche). i also thought the filling had too much stuff in it--i already had cut the spinach to 5 oz. since my husband doesn't care for it that much, and i'd use only half a pound of sausage and a little less cheese. the baguette crust was a really nice idea, and allowed me to use some leftover stale bread.

This is really wonderful! I doubled the recipe for a 15x10 dish. It worked out beautifully. The brunch crowd loved it and many asked for the recipe. The leftovers are great -- even cold!

Very tasty! The roasted peppers are essential, I roasted my own. Used 50% eggs and 50% egg beaters, used 2 cups of milk and no cream. Used a spicy andioulle sausage and added a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne to liven it up a bit. This is a very forgiving recipe as it came out fine dispite the modifications.

Very easy and delicious. Also very pleasing to the eye! Just curious, how can anyone rate a recipe and then say that they never tried it? Mind boggling.

Nice easy recipe. We made this for a simple Sunday dinner and everyone enjoyed it. We added some kale to the spinach to make up the amount and used aged white cheddar for the cheese. We also sauteed onions and garlic prior to adding the sausage. Yumm...

Very easy to make and a delicious way to use up yesterday's baguette. I used merguez sausage which gave it just the right kick. It's better the day after if there's any left.

It's a keeper! I made this for dinner on a cold winter night. Just fabulous. I used half pound sweet sausage and half pound hot sausage, both drained very well. I used crustless Challah bread, because I had it. I also used 5 eggs and slightly reduced the amount of milk and cream. Perfectly browned and puffed in 55 minutes.

I made this for dinner (with a nice salad) and thought it made a great dinner dish. As another reviewer wrote, I used hot sausage and it was great. This dish is easy, but tastes like it is a lot more work.

This was great. I made it healthier by using chicken sausage (Trader Joe's chipotle chicken sausage was perfect) and whole wheat bread, steaming the spinach, and replacing the cream with milk. I didn't miss the extra calories at all.

Fan-flippin-tastic! Made for Christmas Day brunch and still great the next evening for dinner. My father-in-law would not stop going on about it. The only substitution I made was using all hot Italian sausage - I think it added a nice zest to the dish.

I made this for Christmas brunch and it is so DELICIOUS. I agree with another reviewer that it needs something. I am going to take the advice and use one hot sausage. I will also saute 1/3 cup shallots to add to the mixture. This is a keeper and will be an new tradition at our house.

OMG!!! This was delicious! I made it for Christmas Brunch and it was a HUGE hit. I am going to find an excuse to make this at least one a month. This is just my opinion, but spend a bit more on sausage for the dish and go to Cracker Barrel and purchse a pound of their Smoked Sausage. It really made the dish! FYI...when you cook smoked sausage it stays pink, so don't worry when it doesn't turn brown. Trust me...it is so much better with their Smoked Sausage, so give it a try.

Delicious as Christmas morning breakfast. I made the sausage, spinach pepper mixture the day before to save time Christmas morning. Everyone loved it! Will definitely be making this again. I realized after I made it that we forgot to add the cheese on top, but was not missed at all and probably will continue to cut those last few calories.

I asked my mom to bring this for Christmas Day brunch and it was fantastic! I think she followed the recipe exactly, except I asked her to use fresh bell peppers. This was such a festive dish with the red and green. It also travelled very well - she brought it baked and wrapped in foil then in an insulated cooler and it was still warm and we served it right up - it'd probably been out of her oven for an hour. Definitely a keeper!

Made this for brunch Christmas morning. Doubled the recipe since we had eleven coming. Excellent, excellent flavor! Everybody loved it. Would consider adding mushrooms next time to compliment the other flavors. Only caution is this took forever to bake since the volume was doubled, even in a convection oven at 425. So make sure you allow enough baking time. Already thinking ahead when I will make this again!

So I bought 2 baguettes the night before figuring I'd use one for the fondue I made and the other for this dish. Well, before I knew it both baguettes were gone and no stores were open as it was Xmas eve. What to do? I went to the pantry and found a bag of Musso's Oven Baked Cheese and Garlic Toast (little melba toast bread slices) and used them. Voila! Not only did they add some flavor which I believe the dish needs (I'll use at least one hot sausage next time and a different cheese on top), but also the tops of the toast on the sides stayed nice and crisp which provided a nice crunch to the dish. I also used some red pepper flakes after the torta was cooked. Definitely a keeper and probably a new Xmas morning tradition.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I served for brunch and had a guest who was allergic to gluten. I used gluten free bread which is not nearly a baguette but is more dense than normal bread, and it came out perfect! My guests said the bread was the best part. Also took another cooks advice and added fresh parmesan to the top which made a nice crust. Will definately make again, despite the calories....

Rating: 4
Really, Really Good! I used 3 sweet sausages and one hot italian sausage which gave the torta a little kick. Otherwise, made exactly as written. Great for brunch or a casual evening meal with a salad.

Sorry to skew recipe rating as I have not yet tried this.. but re. other reviewers'concerns about high fat/calorie content..have cooked low fat for years without wanting to sacrifice flavor.. had success with a crustless low-fat corn quiche..very creamy and tastes lots richer than it is using eggbeaters, I Cannot Believe It's Not Butter and 2% milk. For this recipe I suggest these substitutes. Also, micro cook spinach, use lowfat hot Italian turkey sausage and cook it by pricking with a fork and broiling til mostly cooked & fat rendered. Remove from casing, blot w. paper towels, crumble/chop. Will try this recipe with a lower fat cheese as well for Christmas brunch and report back. A nice/easy side for this would be roasted cherry tomatoes with basil.

Liked the idea of the baguette slices. The rest of dish was not so inspiring - and as a previous review mentioned too calorie-laden.

Rating: 4
Delicious! I doubled the recipe (maybe more) and used it as part of a brunch for about 18 people. Also had to run out last minute for cheese (forgot it when shopping) and w/o fontina available nearby I resorted to using gouda, which turned out wonderfully. I made the sausage/pepper/spinach mix the day before, which helped. It came out looking even better than the pic in the magazine, and with all the stuff on the table people couldn't stop talking about how gorgeous and "gourmet" it looked. Not a speck was left... Will probably use it for Christmas morning.

Loved it! Using the baguette to line the casserole is brilliant; it goes great with the casserole and it adds a bit of a gourmet feel to an otherwise basic baked egg dish. I stashed this recipe in "make often" file.

Very tasty and an easy dish to make. I think there would be a difference using another form of bread other than a baguette -- I think you need a solid bread to stand up to the eggs. This dish, obviously, is not particularly a low-fat dish.

Just delicious. I've made this twice. I didn't use as many baguette slices as called for in the recipe. I also think I'll try different bread - maybe a foccacia - next time. Mine took longer than 55 min to cook - I don't know why. I used a 4-cheese Mexican mix the second time because I didn't have Fontina and it still tasted great. I also used olive oil to saute the spinach instead of butter. Make sure to squeeze out all the liquid from the spinach. A very filling dish.

Rating: 0
I think when I make it again, I will use a spicier sausage...it was a bit too bland...a very heavy dish.

Rating: 3
The addition of Fontina in this recipe was absolutely sensational, especially when combined with the whipped egg souffle and the buttery baby spinach. **Notes for next time: I think the baguette slices should be lightly toasted so that they retain some texture when baked, and likely the peppers and spinach should be drained a bit longer to reduce liquidity in this dish.

Rating: 4
Amazing.

This gets a 4 forks Amazing rating!! Its so easy, probably works with any kind of bread in the bottom - I used slices from a portugese salio loaf. The red from the pepper and green from the spinach makes this a centerpiece Christmas brunch dish. Loved it for dinner too w/ a salad & glass of shiraz. I was in a rush, so I cooked it at 400deg. for 1/2 the time & finished the top off under the broiler. Ellen,from York, PA
