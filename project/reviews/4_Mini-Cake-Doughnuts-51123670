Great recipe but I expected that it would make more (1/2 dozen mini). Visually it's very difficult to determine when they're done, checked them at 6 min and figured they needed the full 10 min - at 10 they didn't look done still, but I think were a little overdone. I used AP, wheat, and barley flour - everyone really enjoyed them (toddlers even). Nice change of pace and went together really easily.

Wow - what a great recipe! Nice base you can easily adjust - recipe yielded 30 *mini* doughnuts using apx a heaping teaspoon each. Some I rolled in powdered sugar; others, I brushed with melted butter and then dipped in cinnamon/sugar. I could easily see adding lemon or orange zest for a little more zing. We loved.
