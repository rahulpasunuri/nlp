This dish was excellent! I also eliminated the water, and used just damp mustard greens, which was perfect. The spices I used were a mix of hot & mild Madras curry and Indian cayenne, which all increased the heat level, which hit our spot! The first time I made it I didn't have enough cashews, so used a mix of cashews & peanuts, which was okay, but pure cashews is much better. The second time I made it I added grape tomatoes, mushrooms and water chestnuts to the greens then just served everything over rice and made it a meal. With the added mushroom and tomato liquids it was too watery once again, but was a nice alternative.

I really thought this was outstanding, as did my husband. I made a little extra of the spice mixture and rubbed it on salmon I made to accompany. I loved finding a recipe to use spices I don't usually get around to using.

I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer. THis dish was too watery and not flavorful enough. However, I think it is salvagable. For one thing, the first thing both my fiance and I noticed as that the topping needed a sweet note. I think sauteeing golden raisins at the point where you add the cashews would take care of that. Upping the spice quotient would help as well, definitely increasing the cayenne to at least 1/2 t if not 1 t. Also, I would feel safe in leaving the water out of cooking entierly and just letting the greens wilt in the oil and their own washing dampness. It's the way I've always done it, but I thought I would follow the recipe against my better instincts. What can I say? MY instincts were obviously better. :) I would make this again, with those changes, but my fiance has decided he doesn't like bitter greens. Oh well.

This recipe looked healthy and yummy, but was very disappointing. It was very bland, not enough flavor, and too watery-although that could have been the excess liquid from prewashing the greens. It needs a lot more flavor. The only redeeming factor was the onion mixture-that made it bearable and was actually great.
