I liked the concept of this, but whipping cream plus the mustard just didn't have the right consistency to hang on the vegetables. The method for preparing the veg's up to that point are bang on, although I still have no idea what the proposed dimensions are for the carrots - I basically did carrot sticks. Anyway, it tasted good enough, but it just didn't look very appetizing and it didn't have much of a wow factor. Hence the two forks.

Have made this several times and it's always a hit. Try tarragon in the sauce sometime - yummy!

Delicious and a colorful addition to the plate. I used snap beans because I couldn't find Haricots Verts for some odd reason. It was lovely, and I'll definitely make it again.

The dijon and cream make a delicious sauce for these vegetables, I had to use parsley but I will make this again and again, a great addition to Thanksgiving dinner

We served this at a French dinner we gave for our church service auction, so folks had paid nice restaurant prices to come. Everyone raved over it. I especially liked it because it was easy. I had to use the slimmest green beans available, so it took slightly longer than 8 minutes, but not by much. I also used baby carrots and just cut them in half.

This recipe was a surprise winner at Easter supper. However, I had to make one change, which might be significant. Someone used all my cream and, at the last minute, I had to substitue sour cream. It was wonderful. To make it easy, I also use Green Giant's new bags of young beans and carrots - they worked well and tasted fine. Everyone raved about this, no exaggeration. Enjoy.

Easy and delicious! I made this for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it - even my father-in-law who generally doesn't eat carrots!

I made this for Christmas dinner. It went great with the spiral ham. The mustard/cream sauce is great!

This recipe is great for a nonadventurous crowd. The vegetables have a nice fresh taste and the sauce seemed light. I guess the suggestion to cut back on the butter is a good one.

We used parsley instead of chervil (my kingdom for a good source of chervil) Everyone loved it New Years eve. My wife is working on a better do ahead sequence.

I made these as an accompaniment for Christmas Day dinner and it is an excellent vegetable, great flavor and easy to make. I used baby carrots which were very easy to cut into sticks. I also used Trader Joe's frozen thin green beans which are already trimmed.

This dish was well received at our Christmas dinner. We will serve it again for another holiday. I used a lighter dijon mustard so to not overpower the dish with the dijon flavor. It was very quick and easy to make.

Very pretty on the Christmas dinner table. Used a little less butter than called for. Thought creamy dijon sauce gave the dish an excellent flavor.

Way way way more butter than necessary. Otherwise ok.

I didn't care for this combination at all. The dijon mustard completely took over any other flavors the dish may have had. It looks very pretty though.
