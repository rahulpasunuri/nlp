This is a really great bread stuffing. I like fruit (cranberries, apples) in my stuffing but my husband does not. I liked this very much. The prosciutto adds a nice smokey dimension. The only change I would make would be fewer pine nuts. I think 1/2 to 3/4 cup would be enough. Will make this again.

This works really well with the Italian Herb Turkey with Balsamic Carmelized Onion gravy. Been making them together for 10 years.

This recipe had become a staple in our Thanksgiving tradition before I lost the recipe in 2001. I improvised for a few years until I was pleasantly surpised to find Epicurious. The fennel adds such a wonderful flavor to this stuffing. My family loves this recipe because it is not soggy, it has a variety of flavors, and is a fresh departure from traditional stuffing. Leftovers? What leftovers? Yum!

Excellent. Made this last night to accompany a roast turkey breast and it was a big hit. I did one thing differently which was to reduce the amount of fennel seeds to about one teaspoon.

I have made this stuffing two out of the past three Thanksgivings, an it is just incredible. My only complaint is that the consistency was a little soggy this year, which I attribute to either too much stock, or too little bread-- but it is a definite must-try!!

Stuffing was great. Used chestnuts instead of pine nuts, and stock. Baked in turkey

Tried this stuffing for Thanksgiving '99 - I tried something new & baked it in a baking dish rather than roasting it inside the turkey. Most people were kind in saying it was different, which I interpret as them not liking it. I'm sure it would be best cooked inside the turkey, moister & more flavorful. The basic flavors were indeed different & had possibilities.
