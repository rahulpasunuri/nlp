I did not think this pie was worth the effort at all. It seemed like a good idea, and the texture was nice, but I did not find this to provide a strong enough fruit flavor. I will just use a straight forward fruit pie next time. There were leftovers, which is never a good sign.

Okay - used egg whites in a carton and the recipe turned out great! Have them as close to room temp as possible to get the maximum air into the meringue. Also used "Nilla Wafer" prepared crust. Yummy. A great, light summer dessert!

Is fear of salmonella the only reason for using powdered egg whites? I'm assuming fresh from real eggs will work just fine?

Deliciously light...so much so that I think the next time I make it, I'll try a graham cracker crust instead of pastry. A little bit time-consuming to make but well worth the effort.

This is lovely, light and well worth the time to make it. I'll be making it again as nectarines continue to ripen.

If you are worried about salmonella, you can use pasteurized egg whites.

Not a review a response. It says above under "cooks notes" that real pasturized egg whites won't form a proper merangue. I'm not a good enough baker to know why, but I wish someone would make it for me. Sounds great...I love nectarines, so I give it four forks anyway.

For cooks who would like to use the real thing and avoid any possiblity of salmonella - you can use pasteurized egg whites.

This is an answer for the person asking about the dried egg whites. Dried egg whites, such as Just Whites, is safer to use than fresh egg whites. The drying process destroys the salmonella, which may be found in fresh eggs. The dried egg whites can be used in any merengue or egg white based food that is uncooked. They are great to have on hand for baking, too.

The concern with fresh egg whites in this meringue is that they are not cooked. There is a risk of salmonella with uncooked eggs. This is a fair question, it confused me at first, too.

Not a review - a question! Although I'm almost afraid to, since it seems some people think this space gives them a free ticket to be rude and ugly! I've read some notes that were, to put it mildly, unkind. At any rate, why are dried egg whites called for? Since it uses real cream, why not real egg whites to make meringue? I'm confused! I always try to use the real thing whenever possible (it drives my friends crazy, just a side benefit!) so this makes no sense to me.
