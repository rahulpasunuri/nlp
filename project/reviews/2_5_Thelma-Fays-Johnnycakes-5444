I wanted a simple cornmeal pancake for breakfast, and these did the trick. I used yellow cornmeal. I only had 1/4 cup flour, so I added 1/4 cup ground flax seed meal, and it worked fine while getting my omega 3s for the day. Used soy milk instead of regular and cooked them in a nonstick pan on med-high. A nice comfort food on a cold morning. The recipe doesn't specify output, but I used a 1/4 cup scoop and got ~5 cakes.

I wish I could give this inedible recipe a turkey, but I had to settle for zero stars. Lost all the lids to your Tupperware containers? Just make a batch of these, they're so thin and rubbery you won't know the difference. Or use them to stop the kitchen sink. Sorry Thelma Fay, but these babies won't fly. Unless you throw them like a Frisbee.

I used yellow cornmeal, in the absence of white, and the results were very good. I prefer these cakes to conventional pancakes - the texture and natural sweetness of the cornmeal make them that much more appealing.

I would make this recipe again because I love Johnny cakes.
