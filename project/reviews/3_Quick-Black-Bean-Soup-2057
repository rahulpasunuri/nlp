I changed a couple of things- I used a can of flavored diced tomatoes (basil, garlic, oregano), substituted a jalapeno for diced chiles, added habanero pepper sauces, a fresh chopped tomato, and squeezed a lime into it. Amazing!

I made this as written, and it really was too bland. In the end, I added cumin and chile powder which helped. I used canned diced mild chiles; I think diced jalepenos would have been better, as would have the addition of more garlic. Should I make again (not sure if I would), I might only puree half the soup.

This was a bit bland for my tastes, but I kicked it up with some cilantro and crushed red pepper and then it was REALLY good. Reheats well.

Great for a weeknight meal. Kid friendly too, my two year old ate two bowls! Garnished with the sour cream, green onions, shredded cheddar, and cilantro. Also, I thought it needed some serious salt!

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly, except for the puree part. It was very good...great weeknight meal. I sprinkled chopped cilantro and cheddar cheese on top.

soup turned out great - i used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and added fresh pepper (both red and jalepeno). served it with fresh lime juice as well as sour cream/cilantro. very tasty - everyone liked it!

This was a good, quick soup. I would serve it pureed or not as the mood suits. Will definately serve this to friends at some point. A great starter for a mexican meal

Have made this soup several times and it is excellent. Easy and very tasty. We also slice polish sausage into it to make it more hearty.

made this for a flock of 20... mind-numbingly easy to double, triple, nay even quadruple. extremely tasty, especially given the simplicity of preparation. not quite salty enough, but we are none of us perfect.

This was really quite good. To add just a little more zip I squeezed the juice from 1/2 fresh lime on top of each bowl of soup and then sprinkled some fresh chopped cilantro with the green onions on top. Delicious!

A fast recipe which doesn't taste like one

Not a traditional black bean soup - we loved it anyway.
