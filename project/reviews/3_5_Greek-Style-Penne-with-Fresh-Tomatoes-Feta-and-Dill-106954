This is a definite keeper! I made this for my family and tweaked it with 3 added crushed garlic cloves and the juice of one whole lemon. Everyone loved it and raved about it...will be making this again for sure for my weekly couples group.

I've been making this for years, it's very pretty and goes with a lot of different types of summer menus. I agree that is is missing "something" so it's good to add calamata olives and some lemon juice to make it zestier.

Rating: 3
Very easy to make, and I liked the flavors. Made this for a pot luck. While it was a hit, most people, myself included, thought it needed a little something extra. Both meatballs and lemon chicken got mixed in with my portion on my potluck plate, and both tasted terrific with it. Next time I make it, I'll try cooking the orzo with chicken stock, and perhaps adding some ground turkey.

This is a wonderful and quick stand-by recipe. Simple ingredients come together simply, resulting in a surprisingly refreshing pasta dish that's just as good cold as it is hot (either way, different flavors get highlighted). I like to use cherry tomatoes, which adds to the texture of the dish: chewy penne, soft feta, fluffy dill, leafy parsley, and the nice *pop* of a ripe, sweet cherry tomato, all in one bite. It's summer-on-a-fork." :-)

I have had this recipe for several months in my recipe folder but to tell the truth I only saved it for a vegetarian friend. Well I had to make something to take to a wake and I knew that one of the people there was a vegetarian so I made it and WOW is it good. I added the juice of one lemon and that's it. I served Calamata olives as a condiment to be added as desired. This will be a summer favorite,

This is delicious. I did add some minced garlic and a few chopped black olives. I will make this for guests as well. Really simple to make with tons of flavor. goes nicely with sauvignon blanc!

A wonderful recipe, well suited for many occasions and very versatile. However, I felt that the green onion overpowered the flavor of the dish-- I usually either reduce the amount or use chives, to give it more color and a more muted flavor. As others have said, lemon juice adds a lot to the recipe, and try to find really good greek feta in brine. Would definitely make again!

Though I thought I would like it, I really did not. This is the first recipe on this site that I did not care for. Maybe it was the dill. I can't pinpoint the issue. In my opinion, there is a much better mixed Greek-type pasta recipe using shells with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives on this site. Good luck!

This pasta was absolutely delicious after I made a few mofifications based upon past reviews. I do not enjoy pasta as a rule, but loved this recipe! I used red onions, Italian parsley, high quality feta, lemon juice and the freshest garden tomatoes. I topped the dish with grilled tiger shrimp that I marinated in garlic, olive oil, salt and pepper.

I've made this dish many times for adoring guests during the summer months (with the additions of garlic, some fresh lemon juice, pitted kalamata olives, red pepper flakes -- and red onion instead of green). Recently for a cold winter's day luncheon, I made it (including the above additions) and added sauteed chicken breast (dredged in flour first and sauteed with garlic in olive oil ) and a sauce consisting of chicken broth, white wine and a bit of butter (thickened with a bit of flour). My two italian lunch mates were impressed and wanted the recipe. It was a bright pasta dish for a cold dreary day.

I discovered this recipe 2 summers ago and have been making it ever since. I have probably made this dish a total of 5 times for multiple people this summer. When ever I see those people again they ask me to make it. I use the freshest tomatoes i can find and fresh dill is definitly a key ingredient. Try adding some pitted kalmata olivies.

This dish is terrific--very easy to make, and very flavorful. I used fresh plum tomatoes and saved the work of seeding and coring regular tomatoes. Since it's summer, I have parsley, dill in the garden, and I used the best quality goat's milk feta I could find. I think that is key--it's not dry the way regular feta can sometimes be. I also added some capers at the end. A definite keeper!

Even without the fresh dill, which I couldn't find, this dish is fantastic. And easy. Definitely use the freshest, juiciest tomatoes and the best feta you can afford. The dish doesn't stay hot but it won't last long enmough to worry about.

When the recipe uses simple ingredients, it's time to get the best, heirloom tomatoes, greek feta, fresh dill and good olive oil. The flavors were phenomenal, bright and fresh. The warmth of the cooked pasta heats the tomatoes and softens the feta to meld the flavors together. The sauteed shrimp elevates this recipe to entertaining levels and the preparation could not be easier or faster. I was really impressed.

This was very tasty for being so quick. I took other's advice and added red onion which was a nice flavor. I also added grilled shrimp (marinated in garlic, salt & pepper) and that made it a little more special. Lots of flavor for little work!

I made the pasta last summer, and it was a big hit. While filing away last year's magazines, I realized I had forgotten to make it this summer! I bought home grown tomatoes (key to recipe) at a farmer's market and made it for some friends vacationing with us at the beach. Everyone loved it that night and again the next day. My husband has requested it again, and he's a VERY picky eater. This recipe is definitely a keeper for me. I am so glad I rediscovered it.

I made this for dinner last night, with leftovers today for lunch. The recipe was quick, easy and tasty. I thought I accidentally used too much salt, but it turned out just right with the penne. A keeper.

This was a very delicious, light summer meal. I was a bit concerned about finding tomatoes ripe enough (based on comments in other reviews) so I bought vine-ripened tomatoes and added a generous sprinkle of kosher salt to them. The salt must have done the trick because the dish was full of flavor, and perfect for a hot summer day. Next time I make this I will add the juice of one lemon and some lemon zest. I think that would help round-out the flavors a bit more and add a bit of complexity to the dish. I also like this recipe because it is very versitale. Fresh mint, oregano, cucumber, and even olives would make great substitutions/additions. Enjoy!

Delicious! Best thing about this recipe is that it's very light and fresh. The sweetness of the dill mixes perfectly with the saltiness of the feta cheese and the juiness of the tomatoes. I didn't have green onions so I used a red onion and I imagine that it's actually better, but I'll try it with the green onions next time just to see. You should definitely try this one - and it's so easy to make as well!

Rating: 3
This was VERY easy to make. I took the advice of the previous cooks and added a couple cloves of garlic. The only criticism that I have is that if the tomtatoes are not of excellent flavor and texture, the dish lacks depth of flavor. Make sure you get good tomatoes and carefull with the dill and parsley, they can overpower the dish.

LET ME QUALIFY the "4." I made this twice. The first time, I got small, fresh, sweet tomatoes and not-to-potent green onions. I used a little extra feta, too, which I crumbled myself. It turned out great! Everyone at the party loved it! The second time, it was more like a "2.5" because the green onions were too strong, and the tomatoes and pre-crumbled feta lacked flavor. No one loved it. The success of this recipe depends heavily on the ingredients you have available. But it has enough potential that I will make it again and again!

One of my favorite summer pasta recipes! Use real tomatoes from your garden or some other good source in the summer, not stuff from your grocer in the winter. A very brightly flavored dish. I wish my dad was still alive for alot of reasons, but making this dish for him is at the top of my list. Serve with some good garlic bread and a nice tossed salad. Great date dish too, easy, delicious and impressive in its combinationf of flavor and simplicity.

I really cannot see how this recipe recieved such bad reviews because I found the recipe very delicious. It was simple to put together and all the flavors mixed together very nicely.

This was awful. It had a flat, bitter taste that was only made better with the addition of some ceaser dressing. Will never make it again.

Perhaps the problem with this was that I made it in January using well drained canned stewed tomatoes. It was OK the first day, and pretty gross after that. Perhaps I would try this again in the summer with real tomatoes, but I don't hold out too much hope for the result.

I normally dont like the taste or flavor of feta, but I think it worked great in this salad. This salad is great a long grilled chicken or some other main dish type meat. It looks beautiful too.. good enough to serve somewhere fancy but good for the family also!

I used just a pinch of dill and didn't measure anything as I felt the proportions needed finesse. The first day I made it I left the pasta and olive oil out and had it as a salad. That night I added the pasta and oil and it was a big hit! Added some leftover salmon the following night and my husband loved it. Versitle and light, definately a keeper.

Pleasing to the eye and easy to make, this pasta salad is definitely worth making again. I'm not quite sure how well the green onions went with the dish. I will probably like to add some toasted walnuts or pine nuts the next time I make it. I brought a large bowl of this to a potluck, and it disappeared quickly. Using home-grown variety of tomatoes is very important. That, and the high-quality feta contribute much to the flavor of the dish.

I was a bit dubious about the use of dill in this dish.But was suprised at how it turned out.For me, the trick to this dish is to use the best quality feta that you can find, and which is affordable to you.The difference between the flavour of a feta that comes from cyprus and perhaps a marginally more expensive one from greece is certainly noticable.I found that by using the cypriut feta, the compatability of the other ingredients was compromised.

We have lots of fresh tomatoes from our garden, so this seemed ideal to make. We thoroughly enjoyed it and I have already made it again! We have added a couple of items, such as Greek salad peppers and black olives. I cut back on the the green onions slightly and tried a different pasta. The biggest change is that we chose to have the pasta cold rather than hot, but it was absolutely delicious and very easy to make! Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very, very good and so quick to prepare. The dill and feta combination makes the recipe in my opinion and it reminds me of the fresh, simple food I've had in Greece. Use good olive oil, a fruity one is best. Also, while I can appreciate one's efforts to make a few changes to a recipe, substituting basil for dill changes the whole taste of this dish. I would make the effort to find fresh dill. Bon Apetite!

This recipe wasn't bad, but, my teenager girls thought it had too much "green stuff" in it. I went out especially to buy the dill, where I think I could have got away with parsley, chives and basil that I had in my garden. I will make this again, but will tone down the green onions and herbs. It would be good for a light, fast supper or could be used as a side dish to accompany meat.

Very simple and tastey. Works great as a brunch or on a buffet. BUT, you have to know your tomatoes.. If they didn't come from your garden or a farmers market don't waste your time. I perfer 3-4 tbs parsley and added red pepper flakes to taste. If you add the red pepper flakes for some zip, leave out the olives and serve them as a side.

To the cook from Makefield: Variations on this recipe are a standard part of my summer repertoire, and personally, I think that part of the charm of the dish is that it *isn't* hot. If you do want to keep from cooling, you can follow the Silver Palate suggestion of putting the tomato mixture in a warm place so that all the components are at least warm when you mix them. You can also warm a serving dish (with a lid) and bowls in the oven, although I must admit the prospect of using my oven on the kind of day I'd want to make this pasta is not appealing. :)

Rating: 2
Worth making. A good dish, but I'd cut the parsley in half so it doesn't overpower the dill. I grow my own herbs and having fresh cut parsley may be why it overpowered the dill, although the dill was freshcut too. I also added Kalamata olives and upped the olive oil a bit. Makes a lot of pasta for 4-6.

I thought that was good but my husband really didn't like it. I liked the dill, tomato and feta combo taste but I thought that the green onions were too strong so I cut it half the second time I made it. I think I am gonna completely cut it out next time. Like the comment in the magazine says, having fresh juicy room temperature tomatos(which I didn't quite have) probably brings this dish from good to very good. So, it is not the best pasta recipe, but it is a nice fast and summery alternative.
