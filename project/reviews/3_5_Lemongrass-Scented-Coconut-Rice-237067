Granted I have never had a proper version of this dish as I have not visited SE Asia... I used this recipe as a technique more than a recipe - I replaced the aromatics with cilantro and lime leaves - but as a technique it is nothing short of awesome. I made this to accompany the Chicken Thighs with Creole Mustard-Orange Sauce recipe from epi and to quote a famous chef "bam" - magic. I had considerable leftovers as well which is a huge plus in my book as I also love to make fried rice. Guess what? fantastic fried rice.

To make this more of a Thai dish, add 1 tsp turmeric for color. For flavor, add lime juice, ginger, and some chili sauce. Great rice dish!

I am giving this only 2 forks, for a few reasons. I liked it, but did not love it. I did absolutely follow the instructions to a T. However, in my opinion- it was missing something. I do plan to either make it again, or search other recipes for Lemongrass-scented coconut rice. As it's one of my favorite rice dishes.
