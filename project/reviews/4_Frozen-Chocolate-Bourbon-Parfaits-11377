Made this for Father's Day lunch. Was a big hit. Served them in Sundae cups. Here's what I did different and what I'll do next time: made it with Bailey's instead of bourbon b/c I didn't have any. No time for pralines, so I made sugared pecan pieces by toasting pecans in melted butter and adding sugar until carmelized. NEXT time, if I use Sundae cups, I'll layer the whipped cream and pecans in the middle. OR I'll make in much smaller dishes. It was very rich and a big dessert for me. I think I would like it in smaller cups.

I've made this one a few times from when they first printed this one in Gourmet magazine and lemme tell ya, it is SO GOOD !!!! I made 1/2 the recipe because I didn't need 8, and it was just as excellent. I never garnished w a praline, just because I am very picky about my pralines - they MUST be european, Swiss or German, otherwise forget it. So, a raspberry on top or something is ok, or just a little TINY squirt of whip cream is plenty. Yum. Now I feel like making it right now and it's the crack of dawn! :-)
