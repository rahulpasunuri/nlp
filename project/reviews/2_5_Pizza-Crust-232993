Overly complex and the taste is questionable.

@A cook from 2/13/10 Are you kidding me?? Yeast is not an animal product. It is not sentient. You actually kill yeasts everyday in your body naturally, along with tons of other microorganisms. If you don't eat a unicellular fungi, do you dare eat mushrooms, let alone far more complex living plants! Epicurious has this categorized properly, you have totally lost perspective.

From a Chicagoan with no food allergies/dietary restrictions... this is not the pizza crust for me. Made it once, consistency was good, flavor was not. Maybe I'm spoiled with Lou Malnati's. Wouldn't try this again.

Yeast is alive. Therefore, this recipe should not be classified as vegan. Not to be picky, but it's frustrating when trying to look for wheat AND yeast free crust.

I am just making this now, I wouldn't call the consistency like batter but sticky dough. I had a difficult time getting it moved around the whole pan. I covered it with the oiled plastic wrap and rolled it out with a rolling pin to all the edges. Did I do something wrong?

As a diagnosed celiac of 1 1/2 years, I have had to do without pizza. I just saw this, and decided to go for it. It was delicious--it turned out perfect. It's the best version of pizza I have tried. It's so good I would serve it to people who can eat wheat, which is the true test. Two things--I added a little more cornmeal to the pizza pan for flavor and texture, and this turned out great. Also--once the crust is baked and you have added your toppings, I had to move the pan up a few notches in the oven to get the cheese to melt and to heat the toppings all the way through. Quick rise yeast is what they mean when they call for fast-acting yeast. Don't be intimidated by the ingredient list. I bought standard size bags of all the items, and the total came to $23.00. The most expensive item was the xantham gun, which comes in a large quantity, and is only used a teaspoon or two at a time. This would easily make several good-sized pizzas for less than $25.00. Great for gluten-free appetizers--I would cut the completed pizza out with a small circle cutter and serve warm.

This is the best wheat-free pizzab crust I've had (and I've tried lots) It's crispy and light and easy to make. I'm telling all my wheat-free friends about it.

I found out about 5 years ago that I have an allergy to wheat. Since that time I have been unable to enjoy the dishes that so many of us take for granted, like pasta, muffins, bread, etc. I've had to change my whole life to adapt to this allergy. One of the things I miss most is pizza, so imagine my amazement when I found this recipe in a recent edition of Gourmet. I had tried many, many times, to create my own pizza dough using various recipes, every time I ended up with a hard, cracker-like crust, a total letdown. I admit I was skeptical when I read the recipe, and was totally overwhelmed by the number of flours and ingredients I had to buy. But I did finally try it and the result was amazing. I was able to eat pizza for the first time in 5 years and it was so good I could hardly tell the difference. If you're like me and have a wheat allergy this recipe is heaven sent.
