Surprisingly tasty! I did not have bacon or very much parmasean. And used full cream, partially cut with water. Other than that, all was great.

We would give this a 3.5 forks. A simple and fast recipe that is incredibly tasty. I added a little wine to the broth and did not use dried mushrooms. A great "pantry challenge" recipe.

I made this dish for a dinner party, making the sauce in advance and then just reheating the night of. I thought that using the liquid left over from rehydrating the shitakes gave the sauce a really unique flavour that went well with the bacon. Next time I would use less bacon and maybe try to crisp it up a little more. My guests liked this dish, and I would make it again because of how easy it is.

I made some modifications and I was really happy with the way it turned out. I only used 2 slices of bacon, added white wine after the shallots and let it reduce, 3 gloves of garlic, I used thyme instead of rosemary, and I didn't use any broth I thought the soaking liquid from the mushrooms was enough. Might be nice topped with parsley to add color. Good stuff!!!

Added one small zucchini (julienned) and about a cup of shredded kale near the end. I recommend using a little white wine to deglaze the pan before adding the 1/2 and 1/2. Hubby and I both gave it full forks (even without bacon)

This was ok, but was lacking something I can't put my finger on. It was rather "flat" in flavor, not bad but just not very deep. Unlikely to make it again.

Great dinner. I didn't use any dried mushrooms, only fresh and I diced them in the cuisinart. I made a roux on the side of the pan while the mushrooms cooked. I added a wee touch of chardonnay while the sauce was simmering and subbed 1% milk for cream and didn't put cheese in the sauce, only on top. I put a handful of baby spinach on top of the noodles, added the sauce and garnished with diced tomatoes. As one cooked mentioned previously, asparagus would be exceptional in this.

A very good dish; subtle & tasty. I didn't use the dried mushrooms, but instead used portobellas. also, I used onions & garlic instead of shallots.

Made this recipe years ago when it appeared as part of a Valentine's Day/aphrodisiac foods article. It's absolutely delicious and I've made it again many times. Very special!

I thought it was good+. Used garlic, More fresh mushrooms @7oz. some nutmeg, Less Cheese in dish (-1/3c) but some on plate, and only 1C Half & Half. There was enough sauce. Next time I'll reduce more BUT I had to cook everything longer. I also cooked the bacon fat first then added the meat. I was able to take out the fat that didn't melt.

Recipe seemed too bland so I added 4 cloves of garlic to the shallots. It was good but next time I think I'll add something green like broccoli or peas or maybe asparagus (as susan did). I loved the mushrooms and definately will have it again.

Quick and easy to prepare.I added chopped asparagus for color and texture.I would make this for company.Medium mild but just right for us.
