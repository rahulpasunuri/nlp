This pie is so good. My neighbor's tree was full of sour cherries, so we made this recipe twice in one week! The first time we added a few things to the streusel, but I don't really see how you could go wrong. Not too sweet, just right, and very easy to make.

This was delicious! I added a bit of almond extract and cornstarch to the filling, as I was using frozen cherries which gave off a lot of liquid in the thawing process. Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written, and it came out really well.

My rating reflects the delicious streusel topping only, as I have not made the entire pie. I used this topping on the New Fashioned Apple Pie recipe (on this site) and it was an incredible combination...try it!

Followed recipe to a T, and it was delicious. Highly recommend it! Again SOUR CHERRIES are the key!

Only had 1-1/2 lbs of sour cherries, so I added 1 lb of forzen blackberries (thawed). My mother-in-law said it was the best pie she ever had (she's 93). We all thought it was excellent. The best part was the topping was still crispy the next day. I would definitely make this again. The tartness of the cherries with the sweet topping is great.

The streusel/cherry combination is great, and this streusel recipe works very well indeed. But I've had slightly better cherry fillings; I'd recommend substituting Minute tapioca (not pearl tapioca) for the flour and adding 1/8 t of almond extract. 90 minutes may seem like a long time to bake a pie, but it's exactly what's needed to cook the bottom crust correctly; just be sure to cover the edge of the crust after the first 20 minutes (I didn't cover the whole pie as suggested, and the streusel came out fine).

Easy, delicious pie. I used a few more cherries than asked for; that seemed to take care of the extra juice. Consider lessening the sugar based on the sweetness of the cherries; I cut the sugar in half. Definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful tasty recipe. (I did use prepared Pillsbury pastry on the bottom though.) Used fresh sour cherries. Company raved about it. Would add to recipe that when you transfer cherry filling into crust, would drain it of most its fluid. Streusel top combines the pie with a cobbler. Definitely a keeper.
