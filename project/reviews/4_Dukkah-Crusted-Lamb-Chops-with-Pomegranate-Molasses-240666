I'm not giving a fork rating because I didn't make lamb chops; I used the rest of the recipe on salmon steaks, which I broiled, which were DELICIOUS. I halved the recipe and made 2 steaks, so I had plenty of the dukkah mixture left over... can't wait to find out how it tastes on something else! Definitely will be making this again.

I've served epicurious recipes for most of my dinner parties for more than 10 years. Last night my friends & family agreed that this was the best meal they've ever had. Will make it again & again....was super easy with high style points. Dukkah also good as a salad fixing, or with bread & olive oil.

I make this every year, for the holidays... we substitute fish, as our family doesn't really eat much meat... this preparation is really wonderful as a baked dish with salmon or mahi!

Absolutely delicious! I skipped the salt, sugar and honey--enough salt with the pistachios and sweetness with the pomegranate molasses. I also seared the lamb first in a pan and then put in oven at 400 for about 10-15 minutes--depends on how thick the lamb pieces are. Served with polenta mixed with parmesan and roasted slices of Hokkaido pumpkin. The leftover dukkah (I made extra) tasted great sprinkled on the polenta, too.

This was fantastic. Definitely follow cook from Santa Monica's tips -- I finished slightly faster in oven for a more rare chop. Served with roasted carrots and couscous with lemon zest and mint. People went nuts. Great for a dinner party.

It definitely needs salt. Fortunately I was searing in batches so the second batch was better than the first. I might do half salted pistachios and half unsalted the next time.

I just made this dish for my boss and she LOVED it! I cooked it as suggested by the cook from santa monica. I like that method better because it adds more flavor to the nuts. This is a very simple yet elegant entree. If you live in the sticks like I do, look up a recipe for the pomegranate molasses online. It's really easy to make.

I served this over the holiday they were amazing. Everyone at the party told us they were the best they have ever had. Even the kids loved them. I sprinkled them with finely chopped cilantro before the molasses-the green and red mix looked great.

Excellent recipe - my guests loved absolutely loved it. I did make some adjustments: I pan-seared the frenched rack of lamb (after seasoning with salt, pepper, olive oil) for 4 minutes each side. Then I coated with more olive oil and pressed the dukkah over the rack. Roast in the oven at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes (135 degrees for medium rare) and cut into individual chops. Served with drizzle of molasses/honey and extra dukkah on the side. It was a hit!

So easy and so good. I used loin chps but rib chops would be better.

This recipe was so easy and absolutely delicious. I'd never made Dukkah before, but it's so simple and the flavor is unique and complex. I recommend this recipe to anyone who wants something sophisticated by fast.
