Just had these for dinner and they were a big hit. The butcher convinced me to wrap the rolls in butcher twine, sear it, then cook over indirect medium heat. Not a good idea--should have gone with my instincts and the skewers. As I suspected, the centers were nearly raw. I ended up slicing and searing anyway. I used grated Parmesan instead of provolone. Delicious and VERY easy. Everyone was raving about them.

I was very impressed with this recipe. I made a few moderations, I used London broil instead of flank. London broil is a less expensive cut, and I was pleased with the results. The meat was flavorful and the right "bite", not too chewy, but a pleasant steaky texture. I pounded the meat, which I am certain helped. I used the provolone and broiled the pinwheels. It did make a mess, so next time I will use parm. I broiled for 3 minutes per side, came out great. Fantastic meal. I used spring mix and dressed with 2t vinegar, 2T EVOO and salt and pepper. Just wonderful and easy.

This is a crowd pleaser, the pinwheels are very easy to shape and are a show piece on the table. I prepared them exactly as per the recipe, with the exception of the provolone which I replaced with fresh parmesan reggiano slivers - go generous with the parm, it's a different texture than the prov. Prepared them in the morning for evening BBQ - turned out fine.

Excellent -- have made this three times now, all to rave reviews. The second time I added fresh basil to the prosciutto/provolone filling and that was quite tasty. A go-to entertaining recipe!

This is fantastic! Instead of serving with lemon wedges, I threw my lemon in the charcoal for about 15 minutes while the charcoal was getting to the right temperature. I juiced the lemon, mixed it with the olive oil and a little bit of sea salt, and then tossed the arugula in the mixture. Roasted lemon really adds a new dimension, and complements the flavor of the arugula and steak.

Fantastic recipe. I have been making them for well over a year. These pinwheels can be made in advance and BBQ'd while on vacation or served at a backyard party. Loved by kids and adults equally. I believe the trick is to use a red-hot grill (charcoal) and don't leave them unattended. Also, have prosciutto & provolone cut thin and use a good quality olive oil. Finally, cut them as thin or as thick as you want. This allows the rare and medium well eaters to enjoy. Sláinte

Definitely a household staple. I haven't made the salad to accompany the meat, but it goes well with mash potatoes or risotto.

I made it this past weekend with the fresh parm and pesto and it was a huge hit. Everyone ate every bite. Can't wait to make it again.

This recipe was absolutely perfect. I used parmesean rather than provolone, and also added a spinach pesto within the layers, which added a hint of green that looked and tasted awesome. Because I didn't have access to a grill, I used the oven to broil the pinwheels, and it came out to an excellent medium-rare. Definitely will make it again!

I used both provolone and parm on these and found the parm to be slightly better as well as easier to grill (my grill is a mess from the provolone!) and roll. I also used a generous amoung of freshed cracked pepper Served on spinach but would prefer maybe a mixed baby green salad next time. Made these a day ahead. Also did throw the rolls in the freezer before slicing (good tip-thanks!) Great recipe

These are beautiful! I bought the meat already flattened which made it a lot easier. I also spread a yummy roasted red capsicum pesto on the meat and then put the proscuitto on top. And I used parmesan for the cheese. I made these for a BBQ for some friends, and everyone loved them!

Delicious and big hit at the party! Made them the night before so the next day was pretty stress free. I followed someone's tip to have the butcher butterfly the meat - saved me a lot of time.

i was in a rush tonight and picked up an alternative @ the local Stop 'n Shop ... pinwheels made with flank steak, mozarella cheese and spinach ...

I made this tonight to road-test it for an upcoming dinner party and I'm glad I did. This recipe was unbelievably easy, especially since I had the butcher do the butterflying, and the pinwheels were really pretty and presentable. As easy as they were to make, however, they were also very, very rich -- every bite was loaded with fat and salt, even though I didn't add extra salt because there is so much in the prosciutto. Also, other cooks had warned that the provolone was very rich. Having said that, I will make these again, but next time I'll (1) cook on the grill instead of broiling (which will be MUCH easier anyway), (2) use VERY thinly sliced provolone and (3) maybe spread a teaspoon of finely minced garlic or pesto over the steak before adding the prosciutto. Given all the rave reviews, I want to give this another chance.

So easy to make, so popular with the guests.

I will keep this on file for dinner parties. I doubled the recipe and it turned out fine. Definitely easiest if butcher butterfies meat for you. I might try marinating for an hour next time to add flavor and tenderness. I had the provolone sliced extra thin and used half the recommended amount since it's so rich. Next time I might try a good parmesan. Definitely looked beautiful on the arugula.

I wish all dishes could be this easy! It took me 10 minutes to prepare(as long as you have a sharp knife)looks terribly stylish on the plate, and most of all tastes amazing! A true crowd pleaser! I've tried this with different brands of prosciutto and find some much saltier than others, so my only tip would be to go easy on the salt if you are already using a very salty prosciutto! Enjoy!

I was amazed at how easy this was to make. A very delicious dish with a lovely presentation. Meat was SLIGHTLY tough. I wonder if I can marinade it first? Will definately make this again.

This recipe benefited from others' suggestions of garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and also lots of cracked black pepper. I think parmesan instead of provolone would also be more flavorful. But it still is an impressive and delicious dish that's relatively easy to prepare. Next time I would make sun-dried tomato marinara sauce and serve with pasta on the side.

I guess I don't like provolone that much so it's not too surprising that that was the part of the dish I'm anxious to change. Next time I'll use parmesan but I'm eager to make it again. It's pretty easy, quick, and impressive-looking.

This was really good--I served with grilled vegetables sprinkled with parmesan cheese.

Despite my not reading the directions carefully enough, this turned out wonderfully well. I missed the part about slicing the beef before grilling and ended up grilling these enormous football-shaped pieces of meat. Obviously it took longer than 7 minutes to cook! The taste and presentation were excellent - my guests liked it so much they didn't even mind that dinner was more than an hour late because the cook didn't read carefully.

Loved it!!! Make ahead and easy!!! I did put 2-3 T of Sun Dried Tomato Paste on first then the proscuitto and cheese. Very yummy. My kids even liked it. Didn't serve the arugala. Served it with grilled Romaine lettuce halves (brushed with a little olive oil, grilled for 5 minutes, rest for five) then put 1-2 T Blue Cheese dressing (Both recipes from Fine Cooking)

I have tried this with provolone and parmesan, and I like the parmesan better. The provolone left more mess on the grill and seemed too rich by comparison. Overall, great easy entertaining dish for the summer - impressive presentation!

We enjoyed this recipe, the combination of flavors was very good. I did make a little muffuletta-like sauce to go with it in case it was bit bland...went light on the olives and skipped the capers because of the salt. The sauce was definately a plus though the recipe can stand on it's own. Keep a close eye on the cheese and don't try to serve this to people who eat their steak well done, you just shouldn't cook it that long.

It was quick and easy! I added fresh basil leaves and garlic and cooked over a charcoal grill. It was the best "bbq'd" dish of the summer, so far.

I made this while on vacation and, being in a different kitchen, I didn't have a meat pounder so I skipped that part, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I was able to assemble the pinwheels with some difficulty, but it would have a lot easier and a better result if I'd been able to flatten them. Still, they came out well, and I'll be making them again.

An excellent use for an otherwise difficult piece of meat. I used the broiler on this dish and it came out juicy, flavorful, and not the least bit tough. The pinwheels are the perfect combination of easy prep and beautiful presentation. I evolved the salad a bit with fresh mixed greens, asparagus and sauted yellow bell pepper for color. A definite hit.

Made the pinwheels with spinach salad. Pinwheels were difficult to cook but tasted good. Sort of felt like something was missing though. The flank steak was somewhat flavorless, maybe the entire thing needs some sort of sauce. Presentation is impressive...

My purpose for writing is that I would like to know if this could be tried with a "sandwich steak," very thin already, cut from the round.

This was very easy and very good, however pretty rich. 4 minutes per side was perfect. It looked great and was pretty impressive, especially for how easy it was. I put the roll in the freezer for 1/2 hour to facilitate easier slicing and keeping the pinwheels tight. Absolute dinner party dish.

Substituted parmesan for provolone and was delicious ... easy to prepare and impressive presentation. Butterflying the flank steak wasn't difficult. Even my picky 5 year old loved the meat. I was concerned about the flank steak being tough, but it came out great.

This dish (at least the pinwheel part) needs no help at all, so long as you get good quality steak, proscuitto, and provolone; and make sure you barbeque on grill. If your butcher butterflies for you (they always will), then this is so easy to make and looks very glamorous on the table. My dinner guests loved it: it was delicious.

The dish needs help. Try this: Make a paste of roasted red peppers, sun dried tomatoes, Dijon mustard, olive oil and lemon juice. Rub the meat on the inside then add the prosc. and provolone and roll. Go light on the prosc, it will be too salty otherwise. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours to let the flavors to mingle. Grill to medium well. Can the arugula. Take fresh spinach and toss with the above paste lightened with red vinegar to make a vinaigrette dressing. Just another dish you need to doctor up. Overall concept not bad. Try serving with button mushrooms flash fried in bacon fat and tossed with bacon crumbles. --Chef Darwin (All recipes eventually evolve to higher standards)

My 2 sons(13 & 11) made this and everyone was awed by it.(Dad grilled it.)It tasted and looked great!! Grownups had the arugula and kids had fresh spinach salads. I now have two kids who think they are the greatest chefs in the world! :)

We used this recipe for a dinner party. It got rave reviews. The arugula salad made the presentation outstanding. The salad was also an excellent texture and taste counterpoint for the pinwheels.
