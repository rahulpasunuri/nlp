Disagree with prior reviewer - dind't find this sweet at all. Perhaps because I dialed back on the raspberry liquer in the raspberry brandy mixture? We thought this was nice, refreshing, not sweet, and had a bright pink color (just right for Valentine's day).

Surprised no one has reviewed this. We have a box of mediocre champagne that I've been looking to "liven up" and so I tried this. The raspberry combination was quite nice and I'm now using it in place of raspberry liqueur in other things. The champagne cocktail was VERY sweet, even leaving out the sugar cubes (which I highly recommend) it came out more like punch than a cocktail. The response from my "test crowd" was mixed ... if you love champagne and champagne cocktails I think it is a disappointment. If you want a sweet fizzy drink that's a bit different from the norm, I think a glass of this would go over well.
