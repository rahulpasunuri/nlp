A very retro hors d'oeuvre I thought. Guests loved it and it was quick to do.

The stuffing needed more pizzazz - I added some Old Bay seasoning, but maybe could also have added some tabasco or even minced jalapeno. I used Pepperidge Farm Whole Wheat, cut the crusts off and rolled it out flat - worked really well and made the recipe a little healthy. You definitely could use lobster or crab with this recipe - very flexible and easy.

Awesome. They were eaten in minutes. This time I am going to try cooked, peeled & deveined shrimp as that process is very lengthy.

Made these for a party and they were an absolute hit! I used 1/2 canadian black diamond cheddar and 1/2 monterey jack. I may try substituting lobster for the shrimp next time to make an even bigger splash! Try these - you'll really like them - and will be asked to make them again.

I called the hostess the next day looking for this recipe. Everyone was left wanting more of these delicious appetizers. Our friends served this with a Wasabi mayo dipping sauce. You can find that recipe at this site too. I have been advised that the recipe for the dipping sauce was altered by using less mayo and more Wasabi.

This recipe took time and I thought it was just an okay appetizer. Very mixed reviews.

I had a cocktail party and got three calls the following day for this recipe. They were even delicious when they were cold. (I added more cheese - shame on me :o)

I wanted to make an 'out of the ordinary' dish for a party and decided, after reading the reviews, to try this one. Am I glad I did!!! I decided to roll out puff pastry and wrap the shrimp in that as well as the bread to see which I liked best. They were both great! The entire platter was empty within 5 minutes!!!

This is a great appetizer, but if you want to make it even more amazing, serve it with cayenne aioli (from the recipe for crunchy shrimp w/cayenne aioli) on the side. These 2 were meant to go together. My guest were dipping the sizzlers in the aioli and they were gone in about 2 minutes. I had to advise that "double-dipping" would not be tolerated!

This appetizer is perfect. Sophisticated enough for adults yet enjoyed by all but the under 2 year olds. As a grandmother and a daughter, I have a range of people to please, and this hit most everyone.

I loved these! They took a little time to make, but I, along with all my guests, thought it well worth the effort.

i'm going to have to double this recipe the next time i make it! the shrimp flew off the tray! a couple right out of the oven before i could skewr a toothpick into them! i did add salt [very little so as to not toughen the shrimp]and pepper and used a jarlsburg cheese in place of the jack. delicious!
