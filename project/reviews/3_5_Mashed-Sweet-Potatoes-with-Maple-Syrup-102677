I made this for a Christmas potluck and everyone loved it! I cut the potatoes into cubes, mixed them with a little olive oil and salt and pepper and roasted them at 400F for about 25 minutes, rather than boiling. I will definitely make it again!

I have made this recipe numerous times over the past few years, serving it with garlic mashed potatoes, fresh green beans and the pork tenderloin with balsamic, rosemary and cranberry sauce from this website. All of it can be made ahead of time and reheated for easy entertaining. Last time I made it for a business dinner, I actually cooked the pork ahead (undercooked and then reheated sliced with the sauce). No mess in the kitchen and got to enjoy the company. Rave reviews from guest. It is perfect for a no fuss meal that impresses!

Extremely easy and the maple/cardamom really complemented the sweet potatoes. I made the recipe exactly as written and recommend it.

This was very easy to make,and not too sweet. Still, it was a hit with my very traditional Southern family who are used to sweet potato dishes with much more sugar.

Love how this was so easy! I warn not to over sprinkle the cardamon, but otherwise it is great.

Made by baking the potatoes for an hour at 350, 3 Tbsp maple syrup, and 1/4 tsp cardamom (plus the 1/2 stick butter). My almost-3-year-old LOVES it.

Quick preparation is to follow recipe - it's excellent for a weeknight or when you don't have time to bake etc.

Per suggestions of previous reviewers, 1) baked the potatoes, rather than boiled (400 degrees for 1 hour); 2) added an extra tablespoon of maple syrup; and 3) whipped the potatoes with an electric mixer. Easy and quite good. The cardamom seemed more aromatic and richer than the usual cinnamon. Served as one of the side dishes with PORK TENDERLOIN WITH MAPLE GLAZE from this site. If possible, on taste alone, I'd give it a 2 1/2, because it isn't anything extraordinary. But, because it was so easy and rewarmed well, it deserves the 3.

My husband and I love this recipe! You can taste the subtle flavor of the sweet potatoes, and this side dish goes with everything mashed potatoes would. It also makes good leftovers...just add a dab of butter and microwave. The maple syrup replaces the need for any sugar whatsoever.

Good, simple recipe. I agree with the previous reviewer this isn't the typical Thanksgiving version. I served it as a side to Pork Chops with Wild Mushrooms (Sara Moulton recipe)

This is a great recipe for people who don't want sweet and gooey sweet potatos. If you like lots of brown sugar and butter, don't use this one. This recipe simply enhances the sweet potatos subtley, which is very tasty and not sickly-sweet. YUM!

Perfect accompaniment to the Cardamom-scented Lamb (also on this site). I added some heavy cream to round the flavor out a bit. Tastey and easy to make.

I really liked the cardamom flavor and this dish was great served with a pork loin. Quick and easy to make, too.

I made these last night with the lamb rack and they were delicious. I used the exact ingredients stated and used an electric beater to get them light and fluffy. Will definitely make these again.

Too much cardamom. The second time I made it, I reduced it to 1/4 tsp. cardamom. It was better than the first time, but still not exciting.

I love epicurious and always check the reviews before making a recipe and as a result I generally meet with great success. Unlike the other reviewers I found this recipe to be very bland. I increased the maple syrup, put in a little brown sugar, added butter and some nutmeg, and while my guests liked it, I'll look for another recipe next time.

As a Canadian living in the States, I made this for Canadian Thanksgiving, which coincides with Columbus Day, to give the dinner a Canadian flavour.

I have made this twice since discovering it. My husband and I have roots in the South, and have always liked sweet potatoes. This is, by far, my favorite way to prepare them. I love the simplicity of preparation, the subtle taste of cardamon and maple that does not mask the sweet potato flavor. It works beautifully with pork. I served it along with pork tenderloin with balsamic-cranberry sauce, fresh steamed spinach, a salad consisting of red leaf lettuce, strawberries, avacado, Ruby Red grapefruit and a celery seed dressing. It was a lovely meal, and pretty as well.

I have made this dish several times and everyone loves the sweet flavor. I use a potato ricer for really nice texture.

I cut back on the butter and added more syrup. I also used an electric mixer which made this very creamy and light

This is a great recipe - and easy to prepare. I used freshly ground cardamom. It gave a delicate, elusive taste to the dish. I made this a couple of hours before we ate and kept it warm over very low heat.

We love this recipe. Have made it several times. A great way to serve sweet potatoes.Next time I may add a little Meyers Dark Rum to try a variation.

This was a great recipe!! My inlaws were fighting for the leftovers!! I would and will make it again!

We didn't have any cardamon so we made it without...still great. If you like yams (kind of important) this is wonderful. I cut the butter & increased the light syrup slightly & it was sweet & delicious...without the fat. A keeper for us!

This is a wonderful side dish for turkey and pork. It is relatively quick and easy to prepare and tastes like a million dollars. I have made it without the cardamom...it's deliciuos. Definitely a keeper. Everyone in my family wants the recipe.

A tasty (holiday) sidedish. I doubled the maple syrup for a little more sweetness. Really liked the result, even though I'm not the biggest yam fan.
