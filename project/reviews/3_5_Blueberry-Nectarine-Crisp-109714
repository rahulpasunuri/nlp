I have made this several times for guests and gotten rave reviews. The port adds a delicious flavor but I agree the crisp needs nuts to make it "crisp". Vanilla ice cream is a must. Definitely a keeper.

delicious. Used fruit juice instead of port and cut out 1/2 the sugar from the syrup and it was wonderful.

I've made tons of crisps, and this one was great. However, I almost doubled the topping, and added ground cinnamon to it, and left out the port since I didn't have any. My family loved it! Definitely a keeper.

I don't think the topping rates a "crisp"- when served with ice cream it was completely mushy except for the lucky addition of pecans I added! I have had better luck without a recipe.

I made this crisp 4 times last summer! We followed the recipe the first time and then changed up the berry's/fruit depending on what was available. The port lends a rich and unique flavor.

A super dessert! I was afraid the whole cup of Port might be overwhelming, but the taste was great. Saving this recipe!

The port wine was a pleasant addition, and gave the syrup a more complex flavor than just thick sugary syrup. I messed up the crisp part by putting in half the butter called for, but it was still tasty--especially warm over ice cream.

We just picked over 50 pounds of blueberries and I needed a recipe that uses lots of them. This one worked very well and has a nice flavour. Next time I might use less sugar as it's pretty sweet but I think that depends on the sweetness of the fruit you use.
