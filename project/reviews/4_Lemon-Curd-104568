Turned out really well. I'm surprised directions don't call for the use of a double boiler. This is a recipe that can turn bad as quick as you look away. I too added an extra egg yolk and more zest. And surprised it didn't say to strain. Any curd needs strained!!! Tastes great!!!

This lemon curd is to die for! Used for a lemon meringue pie for the 4th of July. Did have to make 2 batches to fill pie adequately. Despite any cook's best efforts, small bits of egg will accumlate while cooking. This can leave the pudding wtih a somewhat grainy texture. Any homemade pudding should always be strained! Your guests may not be able to put their finger on exactly what's different, but it is for sure that they will rave about how delicious it is.

This was delicious and very quick and easy to make. I followed other reviers' suggestions and used an extra egg yolk and then strained the curd at the end to get rid of bits of cooked egg.

If you click on the words "lemon curd" you will see the recipe. It's also a no-strain version.

This is a delicious and perfect spread. A very standard lemon curd. I had to cook it for almost 15 minutes though to get it to the thickness described; but unlike some other folks, I followed the recipe instead of reviewing my own variation of the recipe. It should definitely be strained though. Other than those two things, it's great!

Tastes really nice and rich. I like that you don't have to separate the yolks.

This turned out perfect. I made this recipe using three whole eggs as well as an extra yolk to stiffen it up a bit without having to resort to starch. I also opted to go with a double boiler to minimize the potential of scrambling. I didn't watch it quite close enough, even with the double boiler I ended up with a bit of scrambled egg. Even if I hadn't scrambled the eggs I would have still run it through a sieve to free the final custard of zest. I highly recommend this recipe. I know I'll be making this again.

Sooo yummy! I'm a professional pastry chef and I usually make this with a little cornstarch to help it thicken up... maybe that's why I thought this may be a little on the runny side for filling a tart or something... but all in all, easy to make and really good flavor! BTW, strain it after you cook it to get rid of the chalazae, zest and any scorched egg you may have.

This recipe is easy and delicious. I will never buy jarred lemon curd again. Spread it on crusty bread and enjoy.

This is a beautiful curd. The flavour is spot on- the balance between sweetness and tartness is just so, and the color is exquisite. Beware, this is not your store- bought curd. It is more tart, not sickly-stick-to-your-teeth sugary. I only varied from the recipe in the cooking time (I whisked for about 7- 8 minutes) and in that I added a final step. Like numerous reviewers, I strained my curd to increase silkiness. The curd does well when refrigerated, but the moisture does tend to evaporate if left too long and the curd loses it's smooth mouthfeel.

This is the best lemon curd recipe I've made...I used it as a cake filling for a wedding cakem and in lemon bars. Make sure you keep stirring the curd while it's cooking or you'll get those eggy bits...but if you keep whisking, there's really no need to strain!

This is definitely a solid lemon curd recipe. And with any curd recipe, it should be strained to avoid unpleasant tactile sensations! There are other methods to eliminating the lumpies, but I've found straining it right after it comes off the stovetop to be the quickest and easiest.

Great taste, but I found that I needed to strain it to get rid of the eggy lumps; I think a recipe where you add a bit of the hot mixture to beaten eggs works best.

Lovely! I cheated a little - I had 4 egg yolks left over from making a pavlova shell, so I decided to use them, plus one whole egg and make lemon curd to layer under the whipped cream. Rave reviews! Try it!

Used this curd as a springboard for a dessert for guests. After making the curd, which is a dream, it's so easy, I chilled it, then added about 1/2 -3/4 cup chilled whipping cream, whipped. Spread this into tart shells (already made with a cream cheese pastry from this site). Fanned fresh strawberries on top and garnish with a fresh mint leaf. Wonderful light end to a summer's dinner party.

Excellent recipe - made it for a ladies tea I hosted. I didn't add any extra yolks, or sieve it - just prepared it in a different manner. I multiplied it six times i.e. 3 cups of lemon juice, 4 tablespoons of zest etc. I put the eggs in a mixing bowl and placed all other ingredients in a pan to bring to the boil. The butter melted in the hot lemonjuice mixture. While the liquid was heating, I whisked the eggs. When it came to the boil, I poured it over the egg mixture, slowly, like making Italian Merinque (beating the eggs on low to prevent splashing) It thickened slightly,then I poured it back in the pan and cooked it till a thick custard formed, stirring continuously. Because it had boiled before adding to eggs, it was not lumpy and did not need stirring for long before it was a rich, creamy curd. I poured it into small 4oz jelly jars and served one on each table with a spoon in it. It was thick when cold, and delicious - a perfect consistency.

I made this to accompany the delicious lemon olive oil cake on this site. This is a solid recipe. I was really satisfied with the results. I took the suggestion of other readers about adding in an extra egg yolk to thicken. I also strained it through a cheesecloth, resulting in a velvety-smooth and creamy texture. YUM! I'll be making this again and again.

I was a bit skeptical about making my own lemon curd to serve to my relatives for Mothers Day. This was the first time for both this and lemon cheesecake cupcakes. I scoured the city and tried in search of store- bought lemon curd and I'm SO GLAD I couldn't find any. This was delicious! A few cooks mentioned straining the mixture prior to refrigerating; this is so important as the eggs turn into chunks. The process was quick, the mess minimal -- overall a fantastic recipe!

I made this to put on top of the Lemon Cheesecake with Hazelnut Crust. It was very lemony, and I was afraid it would be overpowering but everyone loves it! Very easy to make (I made it on a double boiler because my stovetop is very unreliable), but I would recommend straining it.

Yum! Nice and tart! Maybe it would be good in a tart... I made mine in a double boiler over simmering water because I was paranoid about scorching it - it took a bit longer than 6 minutes to thicken, but it was great! Really important to strain it, even if you don't use the zest, since part of the egg whites (chalazae) will form small, unattractive lumps after the protein coagulates!

Amazing! My husband couldn't stop eating it before it even cooled down! I followed the recipe exactly as written for a topping for pound cake. Perfect consistency, nice balance of tart/sweet, and very easy to make. I would recommend straining it to remove the zest - makes for a nicer texture. Also, I used a double boiler to avoid any issues with over heating the mixture.

I'd actually looked through several lemon curd recipes before deciding on this one, primarily because I only had 1/2c juice. But proportions for lemon curd are not hard & fast, & this one works well, even if using less butter than called for. I used hand-held beaters from start to finish, whisking the curd over a very low flame until thickened. No straining or extra fussing is necessary!

I initially added the 3/4 cup lemon juice thinking I would prefer the tartness - but had to add more sugar to remedy this - Did add the extra egg yolk It took exactly six minutes on a gas range on med-low. I did put it through a sieve as prefer the velvety texture. This is a simple and excellent recipe - a keeper.

This is a great way to use my abundant AZ citrus! I added one egg yolk, as another cook suggested and my curd thickened in minutes. I served mine over fresh fruit in waffle cones; we ate them in the pool.

This recipe turned out great. Like the cook from Brussels I continously stirred and didn't feel the need to strain the curd when it was finished cooking. It was beautiful. I did blend everything well to begin with with my hand blender. The one thing that was a pain is that it took about 25 minutes to cook. I am thinking that the recipe was originally prepared on a gas stove and maybe low moderate heat on it is a higher heat. I will up the temp a bit more next time on my electric stove top. Great flavor, and hard not to just eat it by the spoonful.

This is a very good, no-fail lemon curd recipe. I used it to make a lemon napoleon. Used the curd for one layer and then folded whipped cream into half the curd and topped that with fresh strawberries for the second layer. Served with blueberries macerated in amaretto. My BF, who is English and knows his lemon curd, thought it was great. I stirred the curd continuously for a silky texture but didn't bother straining it. If I were going to be serving this on its own, would definitely strain out the bits of lemon peel though. Oh, added an extra egg yolk for a thicker curd--would recommend this if you are using it as a filling for a cake or tart. Overall: easy and yummy!

I made the Lemon Layer Cake with Lemon Cream Frosting which called for this Lemon curd. In searching for a lemon cake with lemon curd many readers complained the curd was to thin.

This is delish. Didn't have quite enough lemons on hand so I had to reduce the zest to one teaspoon and top off the fresh juice with juice from concentrate. It still tasted quite nice. I can't imagine, though, how you could possibly stir it so thoroughly that it wouldn't need to be strained.

This is the best lemon curd that I've made! I am a professional cake designer and use many recipes... and this is the one I always use for fillings for my white cake and lemon cake! Delicious!!

I died and went to Heaven! Perfect mix of sweet and tart, quick, and better than the gourmet stuff you pay an arm and a leg for! Would make great Xmas gift in little jars, along w/ some biscotti or teas.

It doesn't get easier than this unless you buy it in the store! I've used this recipe for just one batch and up to 6x as much and it's been flawless every time. I make a beautiful parfait by mixing some of the curd with whipped cream for a mousse, and then alternating that in layers with the pure lemon curd. top it off with minted strawberries, and you have a light, easy and elegant dessert!

must correct my typos from below: I decreased the zest to one TEASPOON, added after the cooking and straining. While cooking the curd, I added one-half teaspoon of natural lemon extract.

Very good, very simple. I doubled the recipe and it worked just peachy (or lemony). I don't see the need for cornstarch at all, but I suppose if that's the only way you can get yours to stay up then it won't make God angry or anything. Probably not too great on the taste though. I think the key to sucessful lemon curd is to set your range on "easy bake oven" mode...meaning cook it as low as you can and have patience, grasshopper. I started out on medium low and turned it down to "warm" also, when they say stirring constantly, they aren't kidding. Pull up a stool and get to stirrin'. Otherwise you'll have burnt lumpies of not-so-goodness. I continued to stir several minutes after the first bubbles popped up, but this was because I doubled the recipe. Very good indeed.

The cake/frosting that this is linked to are very mediocre, but this curd is out of this world! Creamy with incredible lemon flavor, and really, really easy to prepare.
