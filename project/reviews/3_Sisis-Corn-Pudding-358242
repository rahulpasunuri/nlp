In the previous review I forgot to say that the only butter used was for greasing the casserole.

This recipe is a good start for a really delicious main course corn pudding. Fresh corn from 6 ears cooked in the microwave for 3 minutes with a little water. Sauteed 4 oz. pancetta until it gave up its fat, then added half a chopped big yellow onion. After the onion was translucent, added half a fresh NM green chile, chopped fine, and let it saute awhile. For the milk mixture, replaced the milk with buttermilk and evaporated milk and increased it to 2 cups, half buttermilk and half evaporated milk (both sitting in the refer waiting to be used). Increased the eggs to 6 and the flour to 1/4 c. Used only 1 T. sugar. Sprinkled the top with a little sharp cheddar before sticking in the oven. Convection at 400 for 35 minutes. It was fantastic! I can't wait to eat the leftovers.

Funny enough I saw this recipe, just searching for something different to do with a vegetable for Easter dinner. I loved the sound of it, and decided I was going to make  THEN I read the reviews. I was a little scared and because a lot of the recipes said it was bland I was determined to make it otherwise. Starting with the onions, I cooked them a little longer than 5 minutes, getting them to a semi-caramelized state. After about 5 minutes of frying I added a diced Thai Chili pepper to the mix (just one) to give the onions a little boost plus I peppered the onions liberally again while frying. I made the rest of the pudding as directed and had a taste  definitely no bland  and actually quite corn-y  which is good. Feeling it was lacking a little, I added a ½ teaspoon of curry powder to the mix (this from someone who detests curried meals I will add) just to give it a little distinct flavour. I made the entire recipe and we ended up with 5 adults and 3 kids at the meal  not a drop left for leftovers  I will say this, I was pleasantly surprised at the taste and my wife and the guests absolutely loved it. I think this is one of those recipes you can play with a little to give it some different flavours (next time I will grill fresh cobs of corn on the BBQ to give is that smokey BBQ flavouring.)

I have made this several times because it is always a big hit. Only changes I made were to use yellow onion (I always have them on hand), some green onion (for color) and some shredded cheddar cheese - adds a nice taste as well as consistency

I ignored reviews about the blandness of the pudding because somehow I was thinking corn pudding has a Southern origin, and maybe it was the cooling side dish on a table of hot Southern specialties. But the origin is Native American, and was adopted by European settlers to the New World. It was bland out of necessity - a scarcity of ingredients - that could have given it some punch. With wild abandon, I added red and green pepper, sliced scallions, and cayenne. All the corn puddings on this site use basically the same ingredients, but I was intrigued by a couple that used buttermilk as the custard base, as it's low fat and good for the lactose intolerant, so I used a beautiful organic buttermilk I had hanging around the fridge, with excellent results. I also halved the sugar as my corn was fresh and sweet, and sprinkled the top with two tablespoons grated low fat cheese. The pudding's best when the middle is just set - so resist the urge to leave it in for a couple minutes more. Cool and creamy. I'd like to try a Swiss Chard and Corn combo.

Corn quiche. It's very very soft, light tasting. It doesn't really feel all that good in your mouth. As far as the taste goes, it just might be sublme but it was just so lost amidst the other dishes. Sublimated right out of the running. For the life of me I can't think of a simple way to save this, it's just not worth it,

I really enjoyed this. It was simple ...but with a sublte sweetness that I really liked...which is exactly what I was looking for. Also - on the calorie front..wasn't terrible. Will definitely make again.

Meh -- this was only okay. Wasn't a show stopper but decided to make it as it was in the menu for Easter in bon appetit. I probably wouldn't make it again. Kind of boring.

I made this exactly as written and thought it was lacking in flavor. It definitely needs help - peppers, cheese, spices - something to liven it up.

I had to half this recipe--it would have made too much---I have to admit I cannot leave any recipe alone--I added fresh red and orange bell peppers and a little handful of breadcrumbs---the pudding did come out okay---I will mess with it some more---I like a lot of taste, this was a bit bland---it was good, it just needs a little oomph

Very easy and quick recipe- although I forgot to grease the baking pan. I used whole wheat flower, which gave it a little earthier flavor; but, it still worked. The butter in the custard mixture didn't combine well (it might've been too cold) but it still tasted delicious out of the oven.
