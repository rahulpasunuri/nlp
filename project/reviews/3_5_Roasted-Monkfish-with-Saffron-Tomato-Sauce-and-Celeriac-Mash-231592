I cook monkfish often, but the first time I searched Epicurious for a recipe. I saved 4-5 that struck my fancy, ended up using this one, and made the following changes: added minced garlic and three diced anchovies to the tomato mixture; omitted the sugar and substituted vegetable broth for the wine. I didn't like the look of the soggy, darkened basil so I removed the cherry tomatoes from the sauce and spread them over the fish. Next', I strained the sauce through a sieve, and reduced the contents over high heat, before pouring over the fish. Very pleased with the result, although you may wish not to add salt and pepper to BOTH the sauce and the fish.

I'm right there with RedSoxGirl! The sauce is amazing, tho I did use two pints of cherry tomatoes and didn't halve them. I also added about 6 cloves of unpeeled garlic to the tomato mixture, then peeled them and put them in the pan for the second part of the sauce. I did cook it down until it was quite thick, almost dry. My husband said that he would eat anything I put this sauce on! I used halibut and only rubbed it with olive oil, seasoned with salt and pepper. It was very good. I browned it on one side on the stove, flipped it then put it in the oven for 7 minutes.

Wonderful recipe, will become part of the rotation. My tweaks: used homemade fish stock instead of clam juice (shellfish allergies); omitted the sugar; cooked down stock, wine, saffron and spice before adding tomatoes as suggested by a previous reviewer; and used a thin coat of sort of aioli (mayo, garlic, zest) to coat the fish also as suggested by another. Oh and you definitely want double the sauce if you're going to cook it down which I highly recommend! Yum, yum.

This recipe was AMAZING -- with a few tweaks. While the tomatoes are roasting, combine the clam juice, wine, saffron butter and spices. I cooked down to about 40% of the original volume--about 20 minutes-- until thick, yellow, and fragrant. When the tomatoes were finished roasting, I combined them with the sauce, and let it reduce for another 15 minutes or so without blending or combining the tomatoes with the sauce. They gave up their juices, and combined wonderfully with the rest of the sauce ingredients. I did not use any sugar. The end result was a bit acidic, so I added a splash of cream to even out the flavor. The monkfish was delicious as prepared. I did put it under the broiler to concentrate the flavors a bit, and give a bit of color; and then back into the oven. Served with roasted asparagus. Sublime.

Pan searing the tomatos worked OK for me, and the sauce was very complementary to the monkfish. I felt this dish lacked garlic, so I baked the monkfish with a garlic aoli spread on the fish along with the lemon zest and thyme. Should have thickened the sauce like the other reviewers.

I left the tomatoes whole and made the sauce seperately, using fresh chicken stock for the clam juice. If you find the sauce tart , add a teaspoon sugar or until it tastes right. Reduce down hard until 4 dessertspoons, it will be glossy and delicous. Warm and add the whole cooked tomatoes and serve over the fish. This would suit any white fish or even jumbo shrimp fresh from the grill or pan.

I agree with other reviews that the sauce was runny, however, I used my hand blender, let it simmer longer and added about 1 tsp of cornflour to thicken it - the flavor was great, the consistency just needed some work. I used Chilean Sea Bass and roasted according to instructions - great!

I made this for dinner for my husband and I and we were both disappointed. The sauce, which is runny, is very bland. I cooked it down and let it sit for several hours.... I also made the celeric mash and this recipe is a little too heavy on the celeric. Not a great dinner.

Great dish! I love the texture of monkfish and the thyme/lemon combo was nice. The celeriac mash was really creamy and a welcome variation to my standard mashed potoato dish. The saffron tomato sauce, though fragrant and delicious was too soupy for me; next time I will reduce the liquid more.
