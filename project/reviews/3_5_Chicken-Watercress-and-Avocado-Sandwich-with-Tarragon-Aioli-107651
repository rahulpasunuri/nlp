Has anyone tried this with un-toasted bread?

I was craving tarragon and chicken, just made it, but with lite mayo, and it's waiting in the fridge...tasted it of course, it's fantastic!

I tricked out the aioli considerably (added about 2 tbsp. of chopped cilantro, 2 tsp., of dill, maybe half that much rosemary...), and added about 1 tbsp more tarragon than called for here and let it sit for 60 minutes (chilled, of course). Result was fabulous, NY deli-worthy. Garlic-rubbing the bread is a winning idea.

This sandwich turned out pretty well - we made it with ciabatta as another reviewer did as well, and I think this was a good change. The ciabatta has enough texture and structure to hold up to the soft avocado and the aioli. Using a good quality mayonnaise is key here - remember that "salad dressing" is not the same, no matter how much "zip" they may claim it has. It's also easy enough to find very simple recipes to make your own mayo as well, which might help those like the reviewer from Green Lake who have problems with the aioli flavour to adjust it to their own taste.

This recipe turns a basic chicken salad sandwich into a concoction that is too sweet and super mucky. I was looking for a yummy, refreshing sandwich recipe, but this is not it. Cutting the mayo and tarragon in 1/2 might produce better results, but not enough for me to try to make this again. Blech.

Great sandwich, was gone before I knew it at a party. The only modification was that I smashed the avocado and spread it on the bread as it is easier to handle when eating (instead of sliding out).

Oh my gosh was this a great recipe!!! We loved it and couldn't get enough...I made it on garlic chiabatta bread which we drizzled with olive oil and then placed on our grill with the chicken. I also added slightly more garlic to the aioli which gave it a great taste too. I woke up the next morning craving the sandwhich it was THAT GOOD! This is a must to add to my recipe collection. Easy for a weeknight too, especially if you have leftover chicken or can throw some quick on the grill...YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!

These are yummy! The only change I made was spreading the aioli on the bread as well as tossing it with the chicken. I loved the peppery watercress, it really goes well with the smooth flavor of the avocados. I will be maing this again soon.

This was a very easy, tasty weeknight dinner! My sometimes picky husband scarfed his sandwich in record time, so I consider it a success!

I work in a restuarant and ran this for a special, I sold out of product in just a manner of hours. I'd say the public enjoys it as well.

Made this with the CHICKEN AND ROASTED PEPPER SANDWICHES WITH CILANTRO ALMOND RELISH for the Fourth of July in Riverfront Park in Spokane. It was a huge hit with everyone, especially me. The Aioli was flavorful but not overpowering. You can, of course, tweak it to your personal taste. All of these sandwiches were gone by the time the fireworks flew.

THIS RECIPE WAS GREAT! I BOILED THE CHICKEN INSTEAD OF SAUTE AND AGAIN I USED RED LEAF LETTUCE INSTEAD OF THE PRESCRIBED. I ALSO USED DRIED SPICE INSTEAD OF FRESH. ALSO USED COUNTRY POTATO ROUND INSTEAD OF SUGGESTED. I RECOMMEND SLICING THE BREAD THIN AND DEFINATELY MED TO LIGHT TOASTING. VERY, VERY GOOD.

Very flavorful. Easy to make and serve. Would definitely make it again.
