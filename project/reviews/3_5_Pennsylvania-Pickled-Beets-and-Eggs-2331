I've used this recipe 3-4 times in the last year with very good results. As is, it's pretty close to the one I remember my Pittsburgh grandmother using 30+ years ago. The following tweaks are probably more a matter of personal taste than improvements. In any event, to turn up the flavor a bit, I like to substitute brown sugar for white, toss a couple of peeled garlic gloves into the pickling jar and let the eggs soak for at least 48 hours.

Very good and easy, but I agree with one reviewer that it was a little sweet. I'll use less sugar next time. I also added a small whole fresh chili (cut open and seeds removed) which gave it a good zip.

Asbolutely wonderful! This is a really versatile use of hard boiled eggs. I slice them into wedges and serve with the marinated beets and onions as a side dish, sliced over a salad or steak, or scoop out the yolks and make truly "deviled" eggs. I recommend that you toss in extra onion and beet wedges, and let it marinate for two or three days. Everyone loves the surprise of purple eggs! Really a winner!

I was looking for a way to get beets into my menu and this worked well. Next time will let it sit longer, the eggs had minimal "pickled" flavor. It sat overnight in the fridge. Also, did not have whole allspice so I used powdered, that may have made a difference.

They sound horrible but they taste delicious. Pickled beet eggs are best when the vinegar has pickled and colored the egg white but has not yet penetrated the yolk, in my opinion. So I usually use them about one to two days after they go into the solution. They are marvelous sliced onto a green salad, just as you would use regular hard boiled eggs.

I made this with my dinner club when we did an "egg" theme and it was a hit. Very refreshing taste, and I was pleasantly surpised at how quickly the beets and eggs "pickled" as I didn't make this the day before as instructed. So easy and a nice change of pace to include in a spread of some sort.

Just the right pucker. Good pickled eggs too!

Very good indeed. I have used this recipe to pickle other vegetables as well. And I often use whole small baby beets (canned) instead of sliced. Heartily reccomended.

YUMMY! Just like my mother used to make when I was a kid in Ohio 50+ years ago. I let my eggs marinate for several days. They just keep getting darker and tastier. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful reminder of my childhood and my Pennsylvania Dutch grandma!

I missed these when I moved from Pa. They were everywhere. Glad to find it again. I love these eggs!

Excellent. Satisfies that particular craving for pickled things, and the eggs are ever so pretty, too. I have made this 3 times so far, and will recommend this without exception.

Mmmm....had a craving for this - what is it about food from your childhood (yes, in Pennsylvania, of course) that makes it so special? Well, even my Dutch (as in from the Netherlands, not Pennsylvania sort) boyfriend liked this! But next time I'd reduce the sugar - I prefer a more sour taste. I also used different seasonings: 2 bay leaves and 12 cloves. And I used fresh beets, cooked whole in the microwave which keeps the flavor and vitamins in, added 1 cup of water instead of reserved liquid. And red onions were good in this.

Liking 'zesty' tastes, try the following: substitute brown for white sugaar, and add 3 or 4 Jalepeno peppers, (sliced in quarters) or a tablespoon or two of 'red' chile flakes!

I made these for my Pennsylvania-Dutch parents...they loved them! I let them sit in the pickleliquid for about 10 days...Delicious!

I hate this rating system because I love pickled beets & eggs, just not the way it's done here. My mother and grandmother always made these (both were Pennsylvania German). The recipe is basically a good recipe, but use light brown sugar instead of white and forget about using canned beets. Use Fresh! Peel a bunch of beets, slice them, cover with just enough cold water to barely cover, bring to a simmer and cook until tender. Drain, reserving the cooking liquid. Then proceed with the recipe. A bit more work but well worth it! One last item - for Easter, make deviled eggs with the pickled eggs and lay them in a bed of the pickled beets. Great Easter dish.

Great traditional recipe.

Haven't even made them yet; but I brought home from Harrisburg yesterday in carry-on luggage 9 pickled eggs made and bought at Don's ShopRite in Lykens, Pennsylvania, because you sure can't get them in Boise, Idaho, and am delighted to find a recipe for just what I want.

A wonderful innovation that I just made up: This time I made them _before_ Easter. I made three batches: one with red beets, one with golden beets, and one with peperoncini (an authentic PA variation -- just use the liquid mixed with some water to taste). Voila: gorgeous magenta, egg-yolk yellow, and chartreuse pickled eggs! They look great sliced in half and arranged on a plate of lettuce and dill, cut side down. Next time, I'll try varying the spices -- fennel's obvious. Garlic instead of onion? (I knew how good pickled eggs were 'cause I ate them as a kid -- until now I didn't know they were a Pennsylvania phenom, even tho' since then no one has known what I was raving about.)

Thanks for the childhood memory! Mom made these every summer for picnics and also after the Easter egg hunt each year.

I grew up on these eggs, too. Years later, I still crave them during the summer months. You've not had a good hard-boiled egg until you've had a Red-Beet Egg!

1) Like a prior reviewer I use whole beats which I roast in a 350°F oven for 30-45 minutes (this intensifies the flavor) and then slice them. 2) My mother, a pioneer woman, insisted upon using cidar vinegar when pickling.

GREW UP EATING THESE. THIS IS A GREAT VERSION OF A VERY OLD STANDARD. PERFECT FOR SUMMER PICNICS.
