Wow!! This was a very good recipe. Really you just throw everything in a pot (I did them in my cocotte) and let it go. The pork was tender love and the spices delicious. Definitely a grand recipe to try!!

Having travelled to Wuxi on two occassions and having this dish offerred to me by my hosts, I was determine to find a recipe to share this dish with my family back home. All I can say this recipe is fantastic. 95% as good as what I had in China - (the other 5% relates to the fact when I had it previously it was made by a Chinese chef in Wuxi). A bit of work and time in the preparation, sourcing the ingredients, and the cooking but definitely well worth it.

This is a fantastic recipe, I've made it several times now and it is easy, makes the house smell wonderful, and is very flavorful.

Considering how wonderful and fragrant the entire house smelled like while I was making these ribs, they were very mild tasting, borderline bland. They were extremely tender, falling off of the bone and very attractive when presented the right way but a bit disappointing for the amount of time and energy I put into it. I may not know what authentic Chinese ribs should taste like, so maybe I'm not the best judge.

I can't believe no one has made this incredible dish yet! You can easily find all of the ingredients in an Asian market, then cooking it is very easy. This is the best Chinese dish I have ever made and it is definitely authentic. I served it over plain white steamed rice. Absolutely delicious!
