I omitted fennel and parsley and added 6 green onions (white/light green parts only). I also couldn't find olive oil-packed tuna, so I used a common brand canned tuna packed in vegetable oil. Taking previous reviewers' advice, I added lemon juice to taste instead of the full 1/2 cup. Threw the tuna salad between two slices of wheat Tuscan bread with some lite cheddar. It was delish! HELLO, new healthy lunch staple.

Delicious but too much lemon juice. I used this salad to put inside the wrap with mixed greens. I will use less lemon juice next time

I loved this recipe! Since I was making it for a panini instead of a salad, I used canned tuna in water and added the olive oil and lemon to taste- just enough to give it the right consistency. I didn't have the tarragon or fresh fennel so I used fennel seeds instead and that worked very well. Put it on a sandwich with some specialty cheddar it is wonderful. Goodbye mayo and pickles!

Yuuummm! This was balanced well; great for a hot summer dinner...and such a nice change of pace from mayo-based tuna salads :-)

Fantastic, my first review. I did not have any fennel but this was great without it.

I've made this recipe twice and loved it both times! Use a mandoline to get the fennel sliced really thinly. I added sliced mushrooms and that was a great addition. Love it!

I really liked this recipe. I added half the liquid called for, as someone else had recommended. Glad I did, because anymore would have been too much. This is also really good grilled on sourdough bread with cheddar cheese.

if you're not putting it on mixed greens, it definitely benefits from a spin in the food processor

Underwhelmed. This was OK and that is being generous. The lemon and olive oil was too dominant. My husband LOVES salads and he was as unexcited as I was.

Simple and delicious! I made this recipe for an impromptu picnic that my fiance requested for his birthday. I had everything EXCEPT fennel and salad greens. So...I made the tuna salad as directed (minus fennel) and decided to make sandwiches. Accordingly, I reduced the amount of olive oil and lemon juice so that it would not be runny. I used Arnold whole wheat sandwich thins and placed a large fresh basil leaf on the bottom slice. I spooned the tuna salad on top of the basil and placed a thick slice of red bell pepper on top of the tuna for crunch. I finished the sandwich with Maille brand dijon mustard on the top bun. Yum, yum, and YUMMY! The basil takes the flavors to a new level! I may eventually get around to trying the salad, but it will DEFINITELY have basil incorporated.

Far too much oil and lemon juice, the tuna was floating in it. I added 2 more cans of tuna, essentially doubled the recipe, and still too much liquid. Otherwise a good recipe.

I came back from vacation to a fridge with only a few useable items and stumbled onto this recipe that would make use of them. It ended up being my best meal of the week! Loved the flavors and will definitely make this again. The only change that I made was the onion- I don't tend to like raw onion so I quickly pickled fine slices in white wine tarragon vinegar. Loved it this way. My husband thought it looked too meager for a meal so he put this on top of a bowl of pasta- it tasted great like that as well!

Very good salad. I made it with water-packed albacore tuna and used a lot less olive oil. I also added a can of great northern beans. My husband and daughters thought it was too sour, but they tend not to like lemon juice. I thought this was a very nice flavor combination, the fennel and tarragon added a pleasant complexity. I will definitely make this again.

Honestly I don't understand why it got such good reviews...

Great recipe. I also like to use water-packed tuna, or will drain the oil from the tuna and use for part of the oil in the dressing to lighten it up a bit. To make it heartier, I like to add some cannelini beans, and if I have some roasted red pepper or shaved carrot in the fridge, I throw that in for some color. Always gets rave reviews!

I'm a caterer and we did a party outside in the summer because I wanted a tuna salad without mayo. I just did the tuna salad part. It has been the biggest hit and we have used it a number of times since. My family loves it too. This is a GREAT recipe.

This is the most delicious tuna salad I've ever made. I use much less olive oil to lighten it up. Holds up well for lunch the next day.

Just made this a second time. This recipe is the best use of tuna fish that I have ever seen!

Wonderfully crunchy and refreshing. I made w/water packed tuna and went light on the dressing to keep the calories down. Also used shallots instead of red onion. Less would be OK.

The best tuna salad ever! I could eat this every day.

Amazing, awesome, great recipe. Am used to the traditional mayo based tuna salad--this was SUCH a refreshing change. I am officially a convert. Followed recipe to a t, wouldn't change anything. Would be a fabulous lunch for guests atop a bed of spinach or other greens.

Delicious and easy. Served it to friends with rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I used shallots instead of red onions and added lemon zest to the tuna.

Nice refreshing Tuna Salad. I will be cutting back on the red onion next time I make it as it was overpowering the other flavors.

Used leeks and lime juice instead, what a wonderful delicate flavor this had! Excellent for a hot day, perfect with a sauvignon.

Both my partner and evil step-son gave it 10/10. Very tasty. Wouldn't change a thing!

I'd never used the Italian-style tuna, packed in oil, before. This was a great recipe to try it out, because the taste of the tuna is very important. This is a light and very flavorful tuna salad. A great change from the usual mayo-based type. Fennel, tarragon, celery, and lemon combine beautifully.
