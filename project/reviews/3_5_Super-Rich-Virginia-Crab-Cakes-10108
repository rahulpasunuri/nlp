My husband thinks this recipe is very good and I do too, but I'm looking for a crab cake that basically has no filler but still holds together. I'm not sure how the some restaurants do it where it seems the cakes are just crab and a few seasonings. This is the best crab cake recipe I've had so far but I'll keep looking :).

Very good and easy to make. I did make a few changes though. I substituted crushed ritz crackers for the bread crumbs, added Old Bay seasoning and added diced peppers to the recipe.

This recipe was okay. I added Old Bay seasoning (necessary with crab cakes) and extra hot sauce. The taste was just okay, but the mix seemed very dry and I had to add extra milk. It was okay, but not great. I've had much better in New England.

Not bad, but not great. Having grown up in Maryland, and with family still there, I consider myself a bit of a crab cake connoisseur (okay, snob). While good, these don't compare to some of the cakes I've had in some small, seafood restaurants back in Maryland. I think the filling has a bit too much bread. Additionally, if I made them in the future, I'd probably try to either beat the egg whites for a lighter texture or whip the cream a bit. Last, and perhaps it was the Worcestshire sauce I used, I found the cakes to be a bit salty - without the addition of additional salt. Having said that, my husband at them and declared them "good". But we both agreed that they needed a bit of work.

Quick, easy, tasty and (believe it or not) relatively inexpensive, when using one of those big cans of crabmeat from my local warehouse store. I used half-and-half instead of heavy cream, which worked well. Next time, I'd add a little bit of diced red and green peppers, and more onion.

I love this recipe and have made it many times. I add Old Bay as well, but use evaporated milk instead of cream. Served with lemon risotto also from this site.

These are delicious! I add a little Old Bay-a necessity with crab! To accompany, I use the sauce from the Crabcakes with Creamy Caper Sauce, also on this website. For my Super Bowl parties, I make them about 3". Awesome!

Everyone loves this recipe. I am a broke grad student so I substitute imitation crab for the expensive stuff and just add a little more hot sauce and they turn out great.

My fiance doesn't like crab cakes.But he sure liked these! A LOT! I couldn't believe it! This is a grown man who is taken to whining when he knows I am making seafood of any kind. I added 2 tbls. hot sauce, and used shallots instead of onions. I used half the cream called for and they were moist without being too soupy.I refrigerated the mixture for 1 hour. I then rolled it in japanese bread crumbs(panko). I served these little crab bites on a bed of romaine and spinach, and piled on top of them a relish I made of diced squash, red bell pepper, asparagus, and green onions, which I sauteed in olive oil and white whine. Spritzed with lemon and pepper, garnished with lemon wedge. Served with the chardonney cream sauce also found on this site. Not only was my dish delicious, my fiance said it looked like gourmet! Ch-Ching!!

This is a great crab cakes recipe... and blissfully free of mayonaisse. We substituted the heavy cream with lo-fat sour cream, and used chopped chives instead of regular onions. We also found through trial and error that you should really double the breadcrumbs. I'm no fan of extra filler, but these didn't hold together without 2 cups of crumbs.

What an interesting recipe. I made this as is, and it was a hit.

The crab cakes are very good prepared as the recipe states. However adding a little lemon juice and either more hot sauce or cayenne would be a good addition. I made them slightly larger than the recipe calls for. They were a big hit with my chef boyfriend who is from Alaska.

Rating: 3
Didn't use all the cream, but found the cakes nevertheless packed together nicely when set in the pan of melted butter. Added some Worcestershire, lemon juice, cayenne, Tabasco and Old Bay to taste (obviously everyone has their own seasoning preferences!). Found the ratio of crab to breadcrumb was great -- not too much filler, plenty of crab, and (perhaps partly due to my additions) plenty of taste. Will make again this weekend for the family!

My husband insists that I make these crab cakes everytime we have guests. The best thing about them is the ease of preparation. Delicious, impressive and easy. What more could you want?

Rating: 4
I decided to make these based on the other reviews and boy we were not dissappointed! This recipe is SIMPLY FABULOUS! Easy, easy, easy! YUM!(Unlike other crabcakes that get their taste from filler)My parents loved them & did I mention they were easy? Use the spicy chipotle sauce from the other recipe on this site, it is better than any horseradish/mayo/ketchup dip. Get your crab in a can from Costco! Tip: didn't make as much as anticipated and I didn't add all of the egg/cream because they were a little runny. Oh, and use Hawaiian bread for the crumbs!

Rating: 3
Easy and delicious. Friends always ask for these at my dinner parties. I add more than a dash of hot sauce and some Old Bay and serve with a Remoulade sauce I found in Southern Living and the Creamy Caper sauce found on this site with a different crab cake recipe. Excellent!

Rating: 1
These crab cakes were more like crab pancakes, than traditional crab cakes. They were way too eggy and spongy. Also they were very hard to form, even after chilling the mix for 2 hours. They also had next to no flavor. I would not recommend making these again. Try a recipe that has more crunch on the outside like a crab cake to me should taste.

These are definitely the best crab cakes I have ever made, or had for that matter! This recipe contains so little fillers that the end result is a crabcake full of crab rather than bread crumbs as usually happens. I added the juice of 1/2 large lemon to the mixture but otherwise kept exactly as described. The last time I made these I placed the cakes on a cookie sheet and broiled them until the turned a nice golden brown; magnificent. I also paired them with the chardonnay cream sauce from a different crab cake recipe; exquisite. Plan to make again tomorrow for a romantic dinner with my man!

A huge hit. I served them with the chipotle sauce that someone else recommended and it was perfect. I used green onion and added a little old bay. But I'm sure it would taste great either way.

These crab cakes were a big hit - they turned out perfectly!! I added Panko crumbs to the fresh white bread crumbs and then pressed the prepared cakes in additional panko before frying them. I added 1 t. of Old Bay as suggested by reviewers and made the patties ahead of time so that they wouldn't break apart. What a wonderful dish!!! I can't wait to make them again!

This recipe has become a standard for us. Very easy and so tasty. Our friends always beg us to make them for parties and events. I do, however just eyeball the bread crumbs not always using the suggested amount. I also substitute scallions for the onions. We just prefer their milder flavor.

This was the first time I made crab cakes and they turned out EXCELLENT! I used some Blue Crab that I picked up in Maryland on vacation. I also just dropped the mixture into the pan, flattened with my spatula and they turned out fine - no need bothering to form cakes. I refrigerated for 2 hours, and had no problem with them falling apart. I served them with a Creamy Chipotle Sauce I found on this site, and it was really really really good! My son ate 4! I'll definately make these again.

I highly recommend this recipe. They were easily the best crab cakes that I've ever had and so delicious. I made the mix 5 hours ahead and refrigerated it in bulk. I formed 8 large crabcakes when I was ready to cook them and browned them on a griddle. I also made a sauce that was recommended - mayonaise, red peppers (jarred) plus lemon jiuce in a food processor - heavenly. Thanks for the tip!

These are delicious & very easy! I substituted Old Bay for onion and added a tiny bit of tarragon. This is the second time I made them and this time did not refrigerate beforehand--they turned out great! Also, just drop in pan--don't worry about forming "cakes"; pour extra juice from mix on top of each. Excellent!

The recipe is great (especially for a 1st timer). I used a pound of canned backfin crabmeat (Thanks you Costco!) and it came out well. I did refrigerate it for a half hour, like the other reviews said, and I formed it ino 8 patties. Worked beautifully.

These were part of a Valentine's Dinner menu, and they were such a hit! Good crab and fresh bread crumbs are crucial to the overall taste, which was excellent. My husband said they were the best he'd ever had, and he orders them at every restaurant we go to. A hint for special occasion preparation; using a flat griddle, lay greased metal cookie cutters (heart shaped for example) on the griddle and fill with the crab cake mixture. When it's time to turn them over, turn the cookie cutters with them. When they are completely done, remove the whole thing from the griddle, run a knife around the inside of the cutters, and carefully remove with tongs. You will end up with perfectly shaped crab cakes!

Bland and bready tasting. The horseradish sauce helped some, but yuck!

It was great....As a first timer making these, I was very happy with the outcome. Taking the advice of some of the other comments, I used 1 teaspoon of Old Bay instead of Onion, 2 teaspoons of Worshestershire sauce, no hot sauce and I refridgerated it for an hour before I made them. They were a real winnder and will now be on permanent rotation on my list of things to make for company.

Delicious! The only problem I had was trying to keep the crab cakes from falling apart - this problem might of been solved if I chilled the crab cakes for a little while before cooking.

Rating: 4
These are excellent. I also add 1/4 tsp. of Old Bay Seasoning and use onion powder rather than grated onion. Also, since they are soupy when first made, I form the crab cakes (I get about 8 regular sized from this recipe) and chill them for about 1/2 hour in the refrigerator. They hold together better when transferring to the pan and cooking.

So far these are the best crab cakes I've had. Used this recipe yesterday, with some modifications, for a dinner party and they were delicious. I doubled the recipe and added a cup or so of panko to the mixture as I felt it was too wet. Instead of parsley I used tarragon, instead of worstershire, I used lemon juice. I substituted some Dijon mustard for the hot sauce. Before frying, I coated each cake with panko. Since the mixture falls apart quite easily, I held the cake in my hand, and patted the panko onto the cake. I prepared and fried these ahead, and re-heated them on a cookie sheet for about 15 minutes, before serving. The doubled recipe yielded 13 large crabcakes. I think next time I would make the cakes smaller so that I could put three on a plate, instead of one big one. Makes for a better presentation. Used a mustard mayonnaise sauce from another crab cake recipe on this site. Would try the Chardonnay Cream Sauce from another crab cake recipe next time, as the mustard one was unremarkable. Definately a keeper.

Can you say "Yummy?" I was so surprised how great these turned out for such an easy receipe. I served two large crab cakes on top of some baby greens and drizzled a little vinegerette over each plate. I'll be keeping this around for many years to come.

Greatest crab cakes EVER! I added cilantro, jalapeno, old bay, a touch of grainy mustard and they were pure heaven. We are crab cake mavens and these were among, if not THE very best. We made them with the caper sauce that's in another recipe and also with the mustard mayo sauce...the caper sauce ruled!. We are having these again just two nights later because they were THAT good. Oh, and simple to prepare. You have to let the mix chill in the fridge for an hour and they scoop and form very nicely, I had perfect tablespoon cakes. Absolute YUM!

Superb! This was the first course of an eight course meal. I prepared the cakes mid afternoon, and refridgerated....doing this, I think they were easier to handle when it came time to cook them. I made them on the spicy side and served with a nice buttery sauvignion blanc.

Oooh, maaan! These are CRAB cakes! The creamy custard and simple seasonings compliment the crab just right. Don't add any more junk or sauce. Prepare the recipe as written. Use FRESH bread crumbs (2 slices of WW bread in the food processor). Don't be shy with the hot sauce, salt or pepper. There's no handling involved and no need to drain the custard off (heaven forbid!); drop the mixture into the pan with tablespoons like the recipe says and the custard sets up as it cooks. If you want CRAB cakes, this is the recipe for you. If you want a lot of seasonings and junk with some crab meat, keep looking.

Made the crab cakes using one pound of canned pasteurized, refrigerated crab (lovely big pieces!). Served atop your Fettuccine with Red Pepper and Basil Sauce, a delightful combination. Incidentally, having a jar of roasted red peppers on hand, I substituted them for the red bells -- a great choice and shorter cooking time for the sauce. Topped with grated Asiago. Yum!

I made these crab cakes and served as appetizers at a dinner party. FANTASTIC! Raves all around. I followed the previous suggestions and added Old Bay, minced red peppers and cayenne.

These were some of the BEST crabcakes I've ever had!! I noticed I had to mix more bread crumbs than the cup called for so the mixture would hold together. The mixture definitely needs to chill before cooking. The extra breadcrumbs in no way made the cakes more " bready". I also mixed in a roasted red bell pepper, diced. These crabcakes were so good, they can stand on their own without the tartar or cocktail sauce. A real winner!

I've been following this recipe for a couple of years now and it is the best recipe I've come across for crab cakes. Like other reviewers I add extras. Especially like finely chopped red bell pepper added to mixture. The most important step I've found in making any crab cake is to chill it for an hour before cooking. Definitly helps to hold the crab cake together.

This was a good basic recipe. I added another cup of crab. I found it took a little longer to cook, but maybe I made my cakes a little larger. I also added more onion and seasoning. I made a sauce of 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/4 cup of roasted red peppers and 2 tablespoons lemon blended in a blender to top it off.

Rating: 4
The basic recipe is very good. I added a bit more onion, flavored the bread crumbs and added Old Bay seasoning. I also increased the amount of crab meat to 1 pound. Definitely use fresh lump crab meat. I served the crab cakes with a very light lemon butter cream sauce, angel hair pasta with a four cheese alfredo sauce and a caesar salad. A very rich meal, but very good.

I have made these crab cakes several times and I'm always happy with the results. This recipe is fast and easy. It is one of the few crab cake recipes I've tried that didn't overwhelm you with unnecessary spices. I prefer to cook these without butter and I always use fresh lump crab meat.

I used 3 cans of crabmeat in the recipe due to the cost of fresh lump crabmeat in our area. Instead of hot sauce to season I used blackened redfish seasoning in the breadcrumb mixture. Next time I make these I will cut down on the amount of cream because the mixture was a bit too soupy. They were still very good in fact so good that next time I think I will spring for the fresh lump crabmeat!

Quite bland and I think too much breading. I can go to at least five Atlanta restaurants that would put these cakes to shame. (Unfortunately, I don't have their recipes!) I reheated the leftovers and made a roasted red pepper sauce that made them better. Save your time picking over the crab meat!
