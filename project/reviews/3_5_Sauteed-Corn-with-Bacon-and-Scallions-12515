When fresh corn is in season we don't mess with it, so i make this with frozen corn when fesh is no longer available. A great way to dress up corn!

what a great side dish! Family loved it. Incredibly fast to throw together. Maybe next time I will add some crumbled coitija cheese....

This was very good and easy. I made it last night for Halloween dinner for my family and everyone enjoyed it. I think the best part is the aroma while sautéing the corn and scallions. Def make again.

I had three ears of corn and a teenager with braces so I didn't know what I could do with it. Found this recipe, had 1/2 lb of bacon (something not usually in the house) and no scallions but I had two shallots. So....I cooked up the bacon, drained it but reserved 1 TBS of the bacon grease. Sauteed the shallots in the bacon grease, added the corn and finally the crumbled bacon. Didn't add the red pepper flakes but it probably could have used a little S&P although the husband thought it was absolutely wonderful as is. Even mentioned it should be a "company" dish and that's amazing since he has such high standards that he dislikes most wonderful restaurants. Thank you, Bon Appetit and in this case Gourmet!

I thought this was an easy dish, and tasty enough, but certainly nothing special and I won't make it again.

Good fresh corn is so delicious. I felt this recipe muddied the flavor.
