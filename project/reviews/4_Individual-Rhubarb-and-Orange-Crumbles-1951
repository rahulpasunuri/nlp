This was my first time cooking rhubarb. It turned out great! I don't eat refined sugar, so I used 5 Tbsp of honey instead of the sugar in the filling. For the topping I mixed as is without the sugar and then drizzled honey on the top (generously, about 1.5 tbsp). I also skipped the orange peel b/c I didn't have it. And added a handful of chopped strawberries to the rhubarb and cooked it through for the filling. My husband said it was a HIT! And he loves rhubarb.

I don't understand all of the good reviews this turned out mediocre for me. Too mushy and I could taste the flour used for thickening. Why not make this like regular crisp? Mix the rhubarb, sugar, orange and flour together without cooking on the stovetop. Seems like the results will be similar without as much work.

This is a great desert for a winter night. I used frozen organic rhubarb (it doesn't really grow here in TX) and fresh orange and tangerines for the juice. When using frozen rhubarb, skip the step where you precook the rhubarb. Just thicken the orange juice and pour it over the frozen rhubarb in the custard cups. Top and bake per the recipe. Pre chilling the topping also helps give it that perfect texture. I cut the sugar in the fruit mixture by half as the orange/tangerine juice was perfectly sweet. The rhubarb held its shape and the dish was terrific when served with a very small scoop of Blue Bell Vanilla Bean ice cream.

Delicious -- I reduced the sugar a bit, and also prepared everything one day ahead (chilled the filling and topping seperately). It was addictively tart and comforting -- eat this while it's still warm!

Very good. I used only 3 T. sugar in the rhubarb mixture and it was nice and tangy, not too sweet.

WOW! This version of crumble elevated homey comfort food to gourmet. The topping is to die for. When I make this dish again, I will sprinkle the sugar/flour mixture between and over the rhubarb and cook it in the oven or microwave to help preserve the shape of the fruit. It must, of course, be finished in the oven to get that delicious crunchy crust!

I won't rate this because I made so many changes, but perhaps you can learn from my experience. 1)I used thawed frozen rhubarb, which devolved into mush well before 10 minutes were up. 2) Not having custard cups, I used a pie plate. Servings were pretty sloppy. 3)Subbed walnuts for almonds. No problem. Other than that, I thought the rhubarb-orange combo was just ok and the topping was too sweet.

Rhubarb and orange are a lovely combination. The crisp topping is one of the best I've had. I actually put in an extra tablespoon of butter to use up the whole stick, and didn't think it was too buttery even then. It's a great autumn rhubarb dish.

Made this for a quick weeknight dessert. Lovely with the almonds. I actually added about 1/2 cup oatmeal to the topping as I wasn't convinced that the almonds alone would give enough 'substance' to the crumble. Was extra delicious with a good quality french vanilla ice cream on top!
