I literally threw this together from what I had in the house a couple days before payday, so I had to do some substitutions. I had no celery and no marjoram and I had russets instead of boiling potatoes. I substituted thyme for the tarragon, left out the celery and used the potatoes I had. I use olive oil for my "fat of choice" whenever possible, so I sauted the veggies in olive oil, not butter. I also used a heart-healthy margarine in the roux instead of butter. If I had any issues at all with the recipe, it's in the instructions for the roux. Cook a glob of flour smoothly blended into the margarine for 3 minutes while whisking? I gave up after 2 minutes of nothing happening and all the roux inside the balloon of the whisk. Dear hubby liked this recipe. The quantity made is generous and he has leftovers for lunch. When I asked if I should make it again, I got an enthusiastic yes.

I loosely followed the recipe and skipped the thickening part. My husband likes thin broth. We thought it was ok.

I have made this soup many times, each time fiddling with the ingredients. I have added cabbage and kale... both are good but I think the cabbage goes better. I use bulk sausage instead of links and poor off the fat. I have never had an issue with it being too buttery... but I love butter. Double the carrot, celery, and marjoram!

Rating: 3
Used some hot Italian Sausage instead and browned it before as others suggested an also used a total of 3/4 stick of butter and didn't taste overly buttery (I didn't skip on the roux). Also used 3 links of sausage which was key. 1 cup is not enough. Really nice hearty soup which my husband loved and ended up having 3 large bowls of it. Definitely will make again

we loved this recipe but made a few changes. reduced the butter that the veggies were cooked in, doubled all the veggies, cooked sausage until very brown and drained fat off. added garlic salt and italian herb blend. GREAT! for left overs we extended the soup by adding diced ham and some great northern beans- even better!! we are making this for Christmas eve this year

This soup is just okay. Not bad, but not great either. I agree with lots of previous reviewers, wayy too much butter. I cut out a couple Tb in the beginning, and it was still a little greasy. Think this soup would benefit from thickening with another potato or two mashed up. Also could have used more marjoram or another spice.

Rating: 4
Excellent soup! Always a rave when I make it. Would recommend adding the potatoes in when the first broth is added---to give them the full 1/2 hour cooking time. Makes them softer. And I prefer the peel ON the potatoes--so we don't peel them. And also I like to double the celery and carrots in this soup.

Rating: 2
I'm giving the recipe itself only 2 stars because I changed things a slight bit and loved the outcome. But I truly think the changes added to the dish. I cubed the sausage and sauted it until brown. Then added a few tablespoons of butter and a little evoo and sauted the veggies per the recipe. Then I deglazdd the pan with the chicken stock. I didnt use as much of the roux and added parlsy, cream and a squeeze or two of lemon in the end. Turned out really well. Served with herb and cheese buiscuits. I agree that decreasing the butter is key, otherwise it could get too heavy. Adding more sausage and sauteing it is also key for more flavor.

Instead of cabbage, I used a variety of kale's. They're sturdy like cabbage, but have a more interesting color, flavor, and texture. Just added it at the end to the desired doneness.

Excellent and easy soup. Needs additional cup of broth and whole kielbasa sausage (about 2 1/4 cups).

This was a really nice everyday meal. I went ahead and put a whole kielbasa in the recipe instead of saving it for later. Served it with some nice crusty bread and a local Barbera- perfect for a winter night.

I have made this recipe several times over the last couple of years, it is one of our favorites. I use turkey kielbasa (can't even imagine it with any other kind of sausage, as this is perfect with leeks). I also use dried marjoram because I usually have it in the cupboard. Everyone I have served it to raves about it. We have had it for brunch and for dinner, I usually use the whole kielbasa, not just one cup. The soup is wonderfully creamy and rich, but not overpowering.

Rating: 3
I thoroughly enjoyed this soup. It was easy to make and smelled lovely while it was cooking. Like one of the earlier reviewers I added 4 cups of chopped cabbage. Good texture and taste.

Rating: 4
This soup is fantastic, and is always a hit. It's perfect for cold days and great if you need a pick-me-up. Better yet, it's a snap to make! Browning the Kielbasa makes for a more flavourful dish, as does adding a dash of cumin. (I had no marjoram.) I always make sure to add more broth and more veggies and sausage, as I'm not a fan of creamy soups. (But I love chunky soups!) As other posters have mentioned, I definitely recommend reducing the quantity of butter in the recipe - I use a dash of olive oil for the veggies instead of a 1/4 cup. (But I keep the roux the same, of course.) Hope you all enjoy the soup as much as I do!

Rating: 1
I thought this soup was bland, heavy and rather disgusting. It might be good sustenance if you spent the day doing manual labor in sub zero temperatures. Otherwise I would not reccommend it at all. Yuck.

Rating: 4
This soup is absolutely fantastic. I will definitely make it again. Though, like some of the other reviewers I would recommend a few modifications. Firstly, I really can't imagine it without the Kielbasa (which I doubled.) Although I do love Italian sausage too, the Kielbasa really makes this soup aromatic, and penetrates every bite. My boyfriend is French and LOVES his butter, so I didn't pay any attention to the other reviews and I left the recipe as is, but after it simmered for a while, I tasted it ,and did find it to be too greasy. To cut the greasiness, I added a head of cabbage and was delighted with the results. (Though I must admit I come from Western PA and simply adore the combination of cooked cabbage and sausage). Otherwise, I think the next time I make it I will just substitute olive oil int he beginning and then just use the butter for the roux. Enjoy!!

Rating: 3
I used this recipe and referenced another from this site, "Leek, Potato, and Sausage Soup," as well. If you wish to cut the butter in this recipe, just don't do so with the roux, which requires a balance of fat to starch. Taking the time to let the stock reduce was key, I think. We used hot Italian sausage, rolled into tiny balls and browned, as per several previous reviewers. I think next time, I'd cook the potatoes separately -- and account for the liquid they soak up by letting the mixture reduce further -- then puree them before adding to the stock, for a creamier soup (without requiring more butter).

Rating: 3
The first time I had this soup, it was served to me by a gourmet cook whom I KNOW did not skimp on the butter! When she passed the recipe on to me, I was aghast. So I tried it using 2 tbsp in the sauteing process and cut back to 2 in the thickening...I also reduced flour by half. The result is, of course, a thinner soup, but if you can hold back and wait a day, it does thicken up in the fridge...Either way, definitely a keeper.

This has become a holiday tradition. We make it at Thanksgiving, New Years, and Christmas. Everyone loves it. I do cut the butter in halve.

This recipe makes a great autumn dinner. I only made one change, and that was out of necessity. I only had chicken-apple sausage in the freezer and used that in place of the kielbasa or spicy Italian sausage as suggested by the other reviewers. It was fabulous! The apple flavor in combination with the buttery based broth was awesome! I would definetely make this recipe again using the apple sausage.

Rating: 3
I love the taste of this soup. I would just make one comment - I used "Better than Boullion" to make the chicken broth and it very salty. I had to add more water to cut the salt. Oh, and I used dried marjoram because I didn't have fresh. All in all, I love this soup, its just hearty and delicious and I will definitely add it to my soup repertoir.

Rating: 1
even after all the flavor-enhancing techniques suggested below (browned kielbasa, more of the sausage and veggies, add garlic, etc.), i wasn't sold on this soup. i think i just didn't like the roux. to my palate, the soup just had a weirdly soapy taste. i'm unimpressed. (and, of course, i've got way too much of it left over!)

I made this soup for the opening month of my Soup Club and got rave reviews. A great way to warm up and easy to make! I substituted Italian Sausage for the Kielbasa and used 5 potatoes with 4 extra cups of broth. A great, substantial soup.

This is my favorite soup in the world which says a lot because I love soup. The only thing I do differently is used a 1/2 pound of ground Italian sausage instead of the kielbasa. Yummy!

I've made this soup several times now, and I find that it's best with a spicy sausage. Try different sausages though, since it changes the flavour so much and each variation is good. In terms of it's buttery criticisms, I usually cut that down at the beginning of the recipe rather than in the roux. Flava Flav!

I think this recipe is good; there is little I would change about it except to not make it again. Perhaps with vegetables straight from the garden would give it a bolder taste.

Made this last night for dinner. served with bread, cheese and wine. It was good. I would add more carrots and celery. I also found it was very salty, so I added about 1/2 cup white wine near the end of the cooking time. I forgot to cook it the 15 minutes after it boiled, just added the roux, potatoes, etc. It was still very good.

Good flavor, but not being a soup person, I found it was too thin. I will make it again with less butter and much more carrots, celery and Potatoes. Otherwise good.

I made this soup for a Halloween crowd. I browned the kielbasa at my husband's request, browned it very well until it was very crisp, and that made the soup even greater. Cut back on the butter, but used the browned crust and grease in the pan from browning the sausage and deglazed it with the chicken broth. Doubled the sausage, and this soup received RAVES. Great fall/winter fare, you'll want to make it again and again. I served it with cornbread.

Rating: 3
Excellent. Made it just as written (butter and all). Very hearty and tasty. Easy to make too. This one is a keeper

Rating: 3
I made this soup for my family and everybody loved it. I think a lot depends on what kind of sausage you use.It definitely has to be smoked. I used a lot less butter (now you can tell that I am not French!). You can make a roux without fat by just stirring the flour into COLD liquid and then very GRADUALLY adding it to the soup. I will definitely make it again.

Rating: 3
Excellent; I'd make this again in a second. I deviated from the recipe in one small way out of necessity -- I didn't have enough chicken stock (bad assumptions on my part as to what was in the freezer) so although I used about 1/2 the amount suggested, I had to supplement with vegetable broth, plus just a little beef broth for body. I don't think it affected the taste too much (it was fantastic in any case) but next time I'll make sure I follow the ingredient list exactly. Small gripe with the recipe: The "chopped" instructions aren't really all that specific. I took "chopped" with the leeks to mean "sliced thinly after halving lengthwise", but "chopped" for the carrots/celery to mean chopped in the more-traditional sense. That might have been a bad assumption, and I don't think the taste/texture was affected (since leeks cook down so much no matter how they start), but a little more clarity would be great.

Rating: 3
It drives me crazy to read reviews from people criticizing a recipe that they did not follow! This is a wonderful fall dish that is VERY tasty if you use the specified ingredients. The smoked kielbasa infiltrates the entire soup and gives it a warm, smoky flavor that a piece of plain old sausage would never match. Marjoram gives it complexity. Follow the recipe and you will be very happy with this dish. I loved it!

Rating: 1
sorry folks... i made this as written but with italian sausage because i had some to use up. very blah.. so, to salvage, i headed for the fridge and freezer. i added red bell pepper, napa cabbage, frozen basil and roasted tomatoes, garlic, parsley, italian seasoning, and a shot of balsamic vinegar. its definetly better. since i am pretty well into the minestrone zone, i guess i will add beans, pasta, and top with parm cheese.

I am not a cook by any stretch of the imagination, but this recipe looked good and reminded me of the Olive Garden sausage and potato soup that I love, so I gave it a try. I modified the recipe just slightly - Instead of using kielbasa sausage, I used Spolumbo's Spicy Italian sausage. Also, we didn't have any marjoram in the house, so I dumped a nice portion of garlic powder in instead. I served this dish to my boyfriend with parmesan cheese on top. We both give it 4 forks. It's awesome.

Rating: 3
I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added more kielbasa because I had it on hand and wanted to use it up. If you want to use the soup as a main course, it's certainly appropriate to add more sausage, depending on your appetite. The soup can stand on it's own without the sausage if you only want it as a starter. Just to put my 2 cents in, the roux won't do what it's intended to if you don't use all the butter that is called for. That may explain some of the other comments about the substance of the soup. I found that the roux thickened the soup very well. I would just suggest that you stir the soup from time to time after adding the roux to prevent it from sticking on the bottom of the pot. My husband and I had the soup for dinner tonight and it was completely satisfying and filling. I appreciate others' comments about it being a good, hearty soup for a cold, snowy evening and even though this is the "first day of spring", in Lake Placid, NY, it's a cold snowy evening! Although cold is a relative term as the cook from Minnesota can confirm. Spring doesn't really come here until May....but the summmers, short as they may be, are absolutely fabulous, and worth every minute of the wait for them to come! By the way, you can use any herb you want to flavor the soup: you're not tied to marjoram if you don't have it or don't like it. Use whatever herb you prefer.

I just made this soup and it is fantastic, especially on this -5 degree F day. Like others, I modified a bit. I used 1/2 the butter to start. I also substituted Italian sausage and used fresh sage to season. Although the roux worked fine to thicken, next time I think I will puree some of the vegetables and stock and add back into the soup before I add the sausage. I think it will be a little thicker and less fat. I served with some fresh bakery French rolls that provided for a nice hearty weeknight meal.

Rating: 4
This soup was so easy and flavorful, I highly recommend it. The only change I made was to use turkey kielbasa to cut down on fat, so I'm sure it would have tasted even better had I used beef kielbasa. I would definitely make it again, as even my two year old ate this! One other note, I used homemade chicken stock and I think it makes a big difference in the 'blandness' factor.

Excellent! My husband, in particular, loved it and has requested it on a regular basis. I substitued hot Italian sausage for the kielbasa and reduced the butter in the roux. I used olive oil to cook the leeks and drained the sausages well after cooking. I left out the carrots as my husband has an aversion to cooked carrots!

What's the deal? Why are some of you picking on the cook in Ottawa? I found her (his?) experience and modifications to the recipe interesting, whether or not I will take the advice. Isn't that what this site is all about? What's annoying is this harrassing of other people!

I used turkey kilbasa instead of regular and it was perfect and a bit lighter!

I'm going to be one of those annoying reviewers who rate a recipe and proceed to describe all the changes I made to it. I did enjoy the soup, oiliness and all, even though I cut the butter back. Although I did add a little olive oil in with the butter while sautéeing the carrots and celery. Incidentally, I tripled the amount of carrots and celery. I also sautéed the double the amount of sausages (of which I used spicy Italian), which I think is better than just throwing meat in a pot of boiling liquid. It gives the soup extra flavour. I set it aside and then threw it in during the last ten minutes of cooking. Instead of using marjoram, I used dry thyme and oregano, and put the potatoes in earlier than the recipe specified so that it would cook through properly. I was disappointed to find the soup was not as thick as i had anticipated. Perhaps it is because I left the pot covered or partially so for some of the boiling and simmering time, which created more steam and hence more liquid. All of this to say this is a good, basic starter recipe. It stands to see improvements, but is a good basis for creativity and embellishments.

This soup was yummy and I will make it again, though it does needs some tweaking. I felt it had way too much butter and could have been thickened a different way (or not at all).

I agree that the recipe as presented is slightly bland. I nearly doubled the amount of marjoram and also added a healthy amount of fresh italian parsley.
