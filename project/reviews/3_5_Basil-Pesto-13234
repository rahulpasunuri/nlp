blanching the Basil will leach the flavor & oils into the water.....BAD IDEA.

I don't know why you would blanch the basil? I have been making the classic pest from this site from Bon Appetit for years, no blanching no toasting, and it comes out lovely. The toasting of the pine nuts may be a nice touch but I don't know why you would want to blanch out some of the oil from the basil which is what gives it's incredibly flavor....

Definitely would not blanch the basil again. I've made pesto many times without blanching and doing it this time really diminished the flavor. It may stay nice and green but it sure doesn't taste as good!

This a great recipe. DO blanch the basil as it preserves the bright color and pignoli can be found at wholesale clubs for not too bad a price, although the chickpea and sunflower seed subs sound good. We put ours in quart ziplocks, press out the air and freeze so breaking off a chunk is easy.

I took another reviewers advice and used sunflower seeds instead of pine nuts (because I detest pine nuts). Instead of the extra 3T of olive oil, I used lemon juice (to add flavor and make it less oily). I left out the parm cheese because I'm vegan and threw in about a cut of cilantro (because I didn't want it to go bad in my fridge). I guess that's a totally different recipe, but it was pretty darn tasty!

Excellent, basic recipe. I made it with Thai basil and used a goodly handful of fresh-roasted sunflower seeds instead of too costly pine nuts.

Pretty good recipe. Better than some I've had, but I don't know that I would go through the trouble of blanching the basil and cooling it. Added more garlic.

This is a straight forward classic pesto. I wanted to start with a recipe that was basic just to see how it turned out (before I added or changed anything). It was a huge hit. Made a simple pasta pesto with grilled shrimp. Very good and very easy to make. I too froze a portion and used it later. Also spread a bit over crusty bread with melted mozzarella cheese. YUM!

I made this in the magic bullet. You can pack 4 cups of basil leaves into that thing plus pine nuts. I added romano pecorino to the parmesan and that was great. I didn't add garlic as my fiance detests it, but it still turned out great. I froze an extra batch in an ice cube tray and we had little pesto cubes to toss into a pasta dish. That turned out great and we'll enjoy pesto this winter.

I've made pesto many times and this is the best basic recipe I have found. I add 1/8 tsp or so freshly grated nutmeg and 1/4 tsp grated lemon zest. Used the best parmigano reggiano cheese and olive oil I can find. Pure summer in a sauce!

Very nice basic pesto. A note on the measurements: 1/4 cup is 4 tablespoons, not 3, so the total amount of olive oil is 7 tablespoons, or 1/2 cup minus 1 tablespoon.

I've made this pesto many times and it's a HUGE hit in my home. I can't use any tree nuts due to my son's allergy, and instead substitute chickpeas. They have to be well drained and slow roasted.

Very good pesto although I probably won't go to the bother of blanching the basil next time. Someone had a good idea to use tongs to grab a handful of basil and dip it into the boiling water rather than dump it in and retrieve it with a slotted spoon. I used 4 cloves of garlic and half of the additional 3 Tbs. olive oil.

@mackiepoo usually when they separate ingredients like that it's because you use them in separate steps. (i.e step one; add 1/4c .. step 5 use the 3 tbsp) Not sure why they separated them in this recipe, since it's all added at once.

Made this pesto on the weekend and was wonderful. I blanched the basil and had no problems. I used almonds instead of pine nuts due to an allergy. I just wish I had more basil plants in the garden.

I want to give this 3.5 forks. This pesto was very tasty but I feel like it's missing a touch of something. Overall a yummy recipe and definitely better then store bought. I followed the recipe as written. I blanched the basil and it turned out nice and green. For those who are hesitant about blanching the basil, a tip I learned from Jacques Pepins show is to put the basil in a zip- lock bag and microwave for 30 seconds. I personally have not tried it, but this may be an option to those who are not as comfortable with the technique.

I noticed that the recipe called for 1/4 cup of olive oil "plus 3 tablespoons" Since 3 tablespoons equal 1/4 cup, why not just say 1/2 cup of olive oil?

This is the first pesto that I've ever made, and it turned out wonderfully! I halved it by using two cups of fresh basil that we've been growing but kept the garlic and cheese measurements the same. I also used a little lemon juice as previous cooks had suggested. I didn't do the blanching, but I was really impressed with this recipe! Super easy and delicious!

Was looking for a pesto recipe that called for blanching the basil to get an electric green color. This one is FANTASTIC! I blanched the basil for just over one second - literally submerged it in rapidly boiling water, then straight into the ice bath. People have mentioned spoons and tongs, but I just held onto the base of each branch. I found it important to use very fragrant basil, freshly roasted pine nuts (buy them raw, then roast them right before using), and high quality, super-stinky freshly grated Parmesan/Reggiano. I also used a bit of lemon (per earlier review) and 3/4 cup of olive oil. It was still pretty dry, so next time I will use a full cup of oil. Our pesto was PERFECTO! DELICIOUSO! MAGNIFIQUE! Bright green, bursting with flavor and a mouth-watering scent. Beautiful recipe--I will definitely use it again.

Don't blanch the basil! If you do, you will lose most of the volatile oils that give it its wonderful flavour. That's the most important thing. More parmesan is good if you like a stonger-flavoured pesto, but it's not essential. Or if you're counting calories, you can use water instead of some of the oil to give a less rich but healthier result. Also, pesto freezes well for six months or so. I make big quantities in the summer when fresh basil is cheap, and freeze it in ice-cube trays so that during the winter I can just use a cube or two when I need it.

I picked the basil from my garden with no blanching and used 1/4 cup of olive oil for every 2 cups of basil.It was a hit!!

This one was easy to make. Pay extra attention when blanching since if you go over 2 seconds, you are REALLY going to cook the basil. I doubled the cheese and olive oil. Tasted WONDERFUL, will definitely make it again.

Needs more oil and garlic. I took the basil straight from the garden but didn't cook/blanch the basil any. Turned out very good.

When I first mixed up this recipe, it tasted a little bland. So I (almost) doubled the garlic and Parmesan, and added a little lemon juice. It's a little dry, which I don't mind, and very tasty!!

Besides adding extra garlic, we followed the recipe as written. We were a little nervous about the blanching after reading other reviews, so we worked together and our pesto is nice and green. (We think kitchen tongs work better than a slotted spoon for transfering the basil.) We wanted to save some pesto for this winter, so we put some pesto in an ice cube tray to freeze and we will use our foodsaver to seal it. Hopefully the frozen pesto will taste as good as the fresh!

Why blanch? Fresh is best, especially if it is to be frozen. I use fresh local organic growing basil - a pot yields about one handful of leaves, but why not use the stalks as well? Definitely increase the garlic x 2. I also add sliced Kalamata olives to the mix. A fantastic variation of this is to substitute corrianda for the basil, but use the whole plant, leaves, stalks and washed roots. This version needs more salt.

Rating: 4
Fantastic! This is a wonderful recipe to make for yourself and friends. Blanching went just fine..but make it quick! Blanching is what keeps the beautiful brillant green colour; I don't know what went wrong for the others, but I would never skip that part. This recipe doesn't have tons of garlic, but I liked that; it kept the basil the main actor. I did add a bit of lemon as suggested by another. Nice touch. Enjoy!

Just a warning that blanching the basil can be a problem - even when following instructions. Used a timer set for 2 seconds, had a sink of cold water & ice cubes. Looked bright green when I took leaves out of the ice water, but quickly became a sludgy mess. Two beautiful bunches of basil, into the garbage.

I've made this many times and have even given it as part of gift baskets. It's very forgiving if you don't have exact quantities (who ever buys exactly 4 cups of basil?) I thought people might like to know that it freezes well too! Just portion into small containers and pull out of the freezer when you need a quick mid-week dinner. Add some pasta and roma tomatoes and you have a taste of summer in the middle of the winter.

Easy and delicious! My family loved it. Toasting the pine nuts really enhanced the flavor. I do like the idea of adding fresh chopped plum tomatoes over papperdelle

I found the comments from A Cook from East Coast on 09/11/05 and A Cook from Melbourne, Florida on 01/28/06 very helpful. This recipe is exactly what I've been looking for and as you can see, it can go in other directions! I made half of the recipe, and used what I had on hand: 1 ¾ cups of basil, ¼ c. Italian parsley and a few sprigs of mint. 3 Tbsp of pine nuts and 1 Tbsp of pistachios, juice of half a lemon and some finely grated zest. Pecorino Romano, instead of Parmesan. Sea salt, ground pepper to taste. I used a blender, served it on fettucine with some finely diced and seeded Roma tomatoes. It was fabulous!

I have made this pesto several times and it is always beyond compare. I just returned from Italy and my husband said that my pesto is still the best he has had. It is critical to use the best ingredients, especially the pine nuts and cheese. Pine nuts can vary quite a bit in quality, those of poor quality being bitter or rancid. Also, use the best quality cheese you can find and grate it yourself. The blanching is critical to keeping the beautiful green color which adds much to the appeal of this dish. Don't squeeze the basil completely dry after blanching and the consistency should be just right. If not, add a bit of water to the processor to thin it out - don't add more oil, which will just make it too oily.

We usually eat low-fat foods, so I've never even tasted pesto before & really didn't know what consistency it should be. I had only 2 cups of basil, but in typical fashion forgot to halve the other ingredients. Since I wanted it to put over pasta, it came out way too thick. So, I added some water, a drop more oil - and then, not wanting to make it any higher in fat than it already was, I added in maybe 6 oz. of a very good nonfat yogurt. I thought it was extremely good and creamy - but I can't remember the last time my husband has raved this much about something I cooked! When we ate it the next night, I added even more water because it had thickened up in the refrig too much again. I think I must have added a total of 4 - 6 oz. water total. (It was still pretty thick but I didn't need anyway near this much pesto.) Hopefully it will freeze ok!

This is by far the best pesto I have EVER tasted. To combat the "dryness" or the problem with the blender blades not turning, try not squeezing out so much of the water after the blanching. I have made this for years and love it more each time.

I have tried a few recipes for pesto and like this one the best. The blanching if done right is the best way. It stored very well and did not turn a dark color as the other ones did. Very good taste. I will definitely make this again and again. Thanks for the recipe.

There was just too much basil in this recipe. The blades on the food processor even had trouble turning with all the leaves. This led to a very dry and pasty sauce. I had to add extra oil ad then it made the flavor of the pesto too bland. The pesto recipe on the barilla pasta box is mch better than this. Also, don't waste your time blanching the basil.

I wound up with a basil plant as tall as my waist this year! Used this recipe to make a quadrupled batch of pesto that was wonderful. Alas, I skipped the blanching step and so it didn't keep pretty at all. Learn by my mistake, if you aren't going to use this up the first day don't skip the blanching part. You can freeze pesto if you omit the cheese and add it back in before using, but I'm not big on freezing myself. Will definitely use this recipe again.

I tried this simple recipe and was quite pleased with the results. I omitted the blanching step and used a mortar and pestle. I used more garlic (four cloves) and more salt to help puree the garlic by hand in the mortar. Added the pine nuts , then cheese, then hand-chopped basil, then olive oil. Served it over 1/2 pound of DeCecco linguine. Very good. Would definitely use this recipe again.

Very easy-I left out the blanching step and used walnuts instead of pine nuts. A good addition to pasta.

Idea for quick and easy blanching - I used my pasta pot that has a colander that fits into the pot of water. I put the basil in the colander, lowered into the boiling water for two seconds and pulled it up all at once. Couldn't be easier and you don't have to worry about overcooking it because you are having a hard time scooping it up!

This recipe is easy to adapt to your own tastes. Make extra now for that fresh basil pesto taste in February. I made a tactical error when I pulled the tender basil leaves off the stem before blanching. The poor leaves swirled around the boiling pot and were hard to retrieve, so I gave up and didn't blanch the rest of it.

For those of you who are worried about blanching: This process makes your pesto stay greener longer! It is not mant to "cook" the basil. If you exceed the time it will cook the basil and turn it into mush. You don't have to blanch if your serve right away too!

this is the best recipe for pesto that I've come across, and I think the blanching step helps to keep it fresh longer.

To say I was skeptical would be an understatement! BLANCHING basil? Sure enough, after blanching, my four beautiful cups of home-grown, perky basil were reduced to a mass of bruised greens resembling canned spinach. Not wanting to waste my hard-earned greens, I continued with the recipe--and it came out great, in spite of it all. Would I make it again? Not sure. I have other recipes that do not require blanching, and are just as good (I think). Try the three-herb pesto on this site; it's excellent, and a great use of several home-grown herbs!
