Delicious! Used 3 thick slices of bacon instead of salt pork. Ended up with 1/4 c drippings from the bacon which I used for the dressing. Added 1-2 Tbs olive oil, could have used more; the dressing was tart, but it was perfect to me when mixed with the poached egg. Substituted mixed greens for frisee.
