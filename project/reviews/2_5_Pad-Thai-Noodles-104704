We thought this was delicious and quite simple to make. We added more tofu and less shrimp. We worked with what we had in our kitchen. We'd make it again.

This is hilarious... Ketsup? I've read the recipe over 6x and where is the ketsup? What are you SILLY people talking about? Ketsup, no ketsup -- just enjoy the recipe, make it according to the directions, and THEN judge! And... she's right.. don't take yourself so seriously, it's silly... this is just food.

Austin - what are you the food police?? What's with the ketchup problem - if a recipe works - it works. I make a delicious pad thai with ketchup. I also happen to love tamarind - I use it a lot in my indian cooking. But why malign an ingredient just because it's not traditional - geez don't take yourself so seriously - a recipe should be evaluated based on taste, ease of use, perhaps nutritional content - not on some purist ideal!!

Many Pad Thai recipes use ketchup and that IS incorrect. Beware if it does call for ketchup. Buy a Thai cookbook that uses tamarind paste. Also, Pad Thai differs from home to home, just as potato salad or spaghetti. Find a recipe you like and stick with it. You will probabaly never find the same Pad Thai in m,ost restaurants. Just enjoy the variations and stay away from the ketchup.

this recipe is way, way too salty. i think it's the fish sauce. i don't think anyone can salvage this one.

Ketchup??? What is wrong with you people?? Pad thai is made with tamarind paste - that is what gives it its tang and slightly reddish colour. Too much fish sauce and not enough sugar in this recipe. Thai food (and most other asian food) is about a balance of salty, spicy, sweet and sour. This recipe has no balance. Try googling pad thai and find an authentic recipe that has fish sauce, tamarind paste, palm sugar and thai chilies.

I have made this on several occasions. I cut back on the fish sauce (only a few tablespoons )and add mushrooms and a little bit of garlic. It is always a big hit.

I should have read the reviews before making this, but I'd had such good luck with the other Thai recipes! It was truly disgusting... I managed to get it to stop smelling like wet dog by adding a lot of curry to the dish (it was the only thing I could think of) but it was still SO salty and SO bad. It didn't look anything like the rich brown sauce of Pad Thai. I kept trying to fix it, but had to throw it out and eat salad for dinner (my stomach couldn't handle food after smelling this cook). I wouldn't serve this to a dog I didn't like. STAY AWAY.

Truly awful. Much too much fish sauce. Don't you guys test these recipes?

My recipe adds 1/4 ground pork, 2x1 " square ginger, cut into slices, then strips Hoisin sauce is better instead of fish sauce to my taste buds though tonight I substituted soy sauce and rice vinegar (as I had to throw the fish sauce out in the hurricanes when electricity went off for two weeks) and it was tasty too.

I love, love, love Pad Thai and am so glad that I found this recipe. It's very easy to follow and the taste is wonderful. I have to admit, it doesn't taste exactly like the Pad Thai in the restaraunts, but a fusion-type version. It's still a must try!

HOLY COW! 1/4 cup of fish sauce! Most traditional recipes call for a fraction of that. I'd say its an interesting dish, altho Pad Thai it is NOT. I added a handful of fresh basil leaves and it creates a nice flavor. Would I make it again? If I were in a hurry and wanted something pseudo thai. For Pad thai tho, I'm gonna hafta keep on searching for a good traditional recipe.

Watch your fish sauce! I doubled this recipe (using more veggies --e.g. julienned carrots, more mung beans and subbing daikon radish, a pound of shrimp, two eggs and double the noodles) yet kept the fish sauce measurement the same (actually a bit less) to serve 10 people, thus avoiding salty oblivion. Seemed to be well-liked.

I make this dish quite often. One of the charter boat chefs in my area told me to add a spoon of peanut butter and a spoon of tomato catsup to the sauce and it makes all the difference! As well, I add some Sambal (or hot chili paste) for spice and that helps as well. With the additions, I would rate the recipe at 4 forks, and all of my friends bug me to make it for them. Also, I double the sauce recipe so the dish has more moisture to it.

Since this recipe came out, I found a 8oz jar of Pad Thai Sauce from Jack Hua Co. LTD at several oriental markets. It is inexpensive. easy, and very good. You just add the veggies and meat and noodles.

Forget this recipe. I agree, it's nasty. For those who run across a recipe that calls for catsup or ketchup, the reason is that in lots of Asian countries you can buy prepared Kitsap Manis, an Asain sauce that works perfectly in a Pad Thai recipe. It adds the red color, not paprika. Shredded Thai Basil is a nice additon. And of course chiles. And sesame oil. A great way to get chile flavor without the extreme heat is to add whole dried thai chiles (make sure they do not have cracks in them and still have the stem on). The heat is on the inside. Stir fry carefully in the oil and remove with your other sauted ingredients. Then mix everything back in at the end along with the chiles. Very pretty. Serve diced fresh chiles on the side for those who like heat.

This is the oddest version of Pad Thai I've seen, bested only by someone elses suggestion to use Ketchup. An excellent source of authentic Thai recipes is available from Mulalee Pinsuvana or by Nancie McDermott including a fantastic Pad Thai dish.

This recipe doesn't specify specifically enough the type of peanut to use, but we used free airplane peanuts instead of packing peanuts anyway. Came out pretty good. :)

1/4 cup of fish sauce is WAAAAAY too much. 2 tablespoons is more than enough. I had Pad Thai in Thailand a few times when I was there & it's spicy. Where's the chili in this recipe? I recommend decreasing the amount of fish sauce & adding either some chili or a 2-3 tablespoons of sweet chili sauce.

I haven't actually made this dish but I was curious about what the recipe would say. It seems all wrong. Fry the eggs and tofu first, then remove from pan and add later (unless you like your eggs to be orange). Add bean sporuts and green onion at the very end, right before you turn the heat off. And, most importantly, your proportions should go (in descending order): sugar, vinegar, fish sauce. Happy Pad Thai to all.

As others have mentioned in previous reviews the ingredients in this dish seem a little strange. My friend had a recipe that I followed with great results. The sauce is nothing more than fish sauce (I substituted garlic soy sauce-still great salty flavor) ketchup, sugar, lime juice and a few tablespoons of water (and chili sauce for those who like it spicy). Frying the noodles with green onions, egg, shrimp or tufo, and crushed peanuts gave me the pad thai dish I was raving about in my favorite Thai restaurants. While ketchup also seems to be a strange ingredient, I was assured by several Asian cooks that it is a staple ingredient in many asian dishes.

I agree with the Scottfrom CA. Instead of the posted directions, I followed his and the dish came together nicely. Even my husband, who hates seafood, loved it. I may back off slightly on the fish sauce-it is as Scott says, the fish aroma is strong. The marriage of the peanuts, sugar and vinegar is wonderful in this dish. Definitely use the 1/8 inch rice sticks-they will be more delicate than 1/2 inch. The most fun I had making this dish was going to the Asian Markets to get all the ingredients-it was as if I hopped on a plane and travelled 1/2 way around the world.

This recipe has all the right ingredients, but the measurements are all out of whack. The first time I tried this recipe, I tossed it out after one bite because it was so salty. I can't believe the other reviewers didn't mention this. The fish sauce is the culprit, and a local Thai chef laughed out loud when I told her I used 1/4 cup. Use only 2 Tbs. fish sauce, 3-4 Tbs.(not tsp.) sugar, and 4 Tbs. rice wine vinegar. Mix them together and heat slightly in the microwave on low, then stir to dissolve the sugar. Let it cool completely and add 1/4 cup water with 1 Tsp. cornstarch mixed in. Add only 1/2-1 tsp. paprika to this mixture. It's mostly for color, not flavor. The bean sprouts usually aren't cooked, they're used as a garnish on the side of the plate, along with some slivered carrots and the lime wedges, and you'll only need about 1 cup. Stir-fry everything else first, then add the fish sauce mixture, cooking down until the sauce just coats the ingredients , about 1 1/2 - 2 minutes. Toss in the pre-cooked shrimp last to reheat. Use the 1/8 inch rice noodles, and put a little oil in the water to keep them from sticking. This is an outstanding dish when made properly, with a slightly sweet flavor and a VERY distinct aroma from the fish sauce, which may take a little getting used to.

I thought this recipe sounded close to my favorite take-out, but nothing sounded like it was going to make the noodles pink (the color they are when I order it). So, I changed it. If the one you like it pink too, then try this: add about a half cup of Asian Chili Sauce (look for one that's nice & thick and full of pepper chunks) and a little more sugar. I also threw out the radishes and made it with just noodles, bean sprouts, green onion, shrimp, nuts, and egg. It was great! Now I can save the $12, and make it myslf!

I have a favorite Thai restaurant down the street and this wasn't nearly as good as their version. I did use Shark instead of Tofu and more veggies. I probably won't make it again although it did taste good - just doesn't measure up to Sea Siam...

Just a comment: the taste of this dish may not be "authentic" due to some ingredient subsitutions I noticed. I have a recipe that uses a preserved salted radish instead of fresh radish. My recipe also uses some tamarind juice. A suggestion would be to use thai style fish sauce, as other varieties of fish sauce may be saltier than the thai style. The mentioned ingrediants can usually be found at asian food markets

I really liked this dish. I followed the recipe as written except I added additional paprika and some crushed red pepper flakes. (I didn't think the paprika was weird, as a friend told me that many recipes use ketchup in this dish.) I used all of the fish sauce in the recipe as I have used it before and I know how much it adds to the dish. I thought the flavor and appearance of this dish were similar to what we have had in Thai restaurants. I used extra firm tofu which had good texture. The radishes disappear into the dish. I don't think most people would even realize that they are in there. Next time (which will probably be soon), I will use less shrimp - probably about half.

This was the first time I had ever actually eaten pad thai. It was okay, but not quite as good as I had expected. I'm sure there are better recipies out there. Per another reviewer's request I lowered the amount of fish sauce. Coconut gelato was good for desert!

Everything went well as far as making the dish but I would say that there was something lacking in the dish. It is not the best Phad Thai I have had. But then maybe it was the cook. I have never seen a recipe that called for paprika. Didn't know that was a Thai ingredient. I will keep searching for a recipe. I wrote requesting a recipe for a Thai fried rice but I am 0 for 2 in request.

the dish came out pretty well but would have come out much better had I done these things: 1. take care to get rice stick noodles that are the right thickness, 1/8" 2. use care when using the fish sauce -- my pad thai came out saltier than I would have liked -- it could have been my user error but be judicious with this sauce 3. try using baked tofu in lieu of firm tofu -- it has a much better firmness and taste than regular tofu. bon appetit
