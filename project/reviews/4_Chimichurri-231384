Wonderful!!! Made it for a dinner party. Followed recipe except pulsed it in the blender a bit after mixing the ingredients. Everyone loved it... on the steak, on the grilled vegetables, on the rice. Definitely a keeper!

Having being born in Argentina, I vouch for this recipe. It's the real thing. Do not make a lot of it, as it's best fresh (not more than a day old, as the recipe says).

I go to this Argentinian/Italian restaurant by me called The Pasta Connection and they always have the best chimichurri sauce and I am happy to say that I have finally found the recipe! Amazing, wouldn't change a thing. Grilling some chicken tonight and having this as the coup de gras! Enjoy.

Make exactly as is. Great spooned over sliced skirt steak, fish or roasted veggies.

This recipe has become a standard in my kitchen; I almost always now have a container ready for quick pickups.I often switch out the parsley for other herbs, or mix it up, by adding oregon or basil.You can also add a little lemon zest for variety. Great as a salad dressing base (add to basic oil/vinegar), marinade, veggie topper, soup garnish,bread dip..you name it!!

I made this for a chimichurri fanatic and he gave it a rave review. I am not an expert who grew up with the traditional taste, but I've eaten quite a few. This recipe was just as good as, if not better, than any version I've ever tried. (Beat the lemon hands down!)

I pitted this against another Gourmet Chimichurri made with lemons. Both were excellent - some people liked the lemon one better others this, the vinegar one. Both I will make again - if a suggestion at all cut down a bit on the vinegar in this one and cut down a bit on the limon in the other.

Was worried this would be too simple, it's just a vinaigrette with a lot of parsley, but it was really nice over a strip steak, with kemps beans and rice. Very nice flavor.

Sooo gooood!!! I threw it in the food processor for a bit and it was perfect. I even forgot to take out the bay leaf, which I was really worried about, but it turned out great! I also used the chimichurri on roasted potatoes wedges. Tossed wedges with a little EVOO, salt, pepper and chimichurri. Baked at 425 for 40 minutes, turning once. Then drizzled some more chimichurri before serving. Fabulous! Got rave reviews.

Excellent recipe, perfect with skirt steak grilled on the BBQ and some mashed or baked potatoes. Agree with other reviewers that more parley (translate: less liquid) is better. I usually use my food processor to make it faster and it works great (although try not to end up with a parsley vinagrette!)

I've made this several times for hors d'ouevres - cut out bite-size bread rounds with a little cookie cutter; toast them in the oven, pop on a little piece of grilled flank steak, then a dollop of the chimichurri sauce. Always a hit! I always start with less oil and water first and add only as much as needed to get the texture you want. With all the liquid the sauce can be too runny to sit on top of the flank steak. And these are great to sit out on a buffet table at room temp.

Delicious! We used one Tbsp. of dried oregano in place of the bay leaf for a more authentic Argentine recipe. You can't go wrong with extra red pepper flakes and more parsley too. Great on toasted french bread.

WOW!!! I made this for my parents, in-laws and friends and blew them all away!!! I made 2 separate sauces, one mild and one hot. Chopped up some jalepenos for the hot version. Grilled skirt steaks with onions and peppers. I always keep a jar of this in the fridge...great on everything!!!

I made it with regular vinegar + red wine and served it with grilled meat: pork tenderloin and steak. Everybody loved it.

This is an amazingly simple recipe that will enhance the flavor of whatever you put on it. We had it last night on pan seared salmon and it really brought out the flavor. I like to imulsify all of the ingredients together and I come up with this bright green sauce that looks great drizzled over anything. I agree with the previous reviewer that you really can put this on anything! Something else I do is add a couple squeezes of a half a lemon to help brighten it up even more. The acid also helps it keep combined if you imulsify it.

This is so good!! It is really kicking, so, be careful!! We add a little to almost any thing. Spaghetti, potatoes, gumbo, etc. I try to keep this on hand in the refridge. Brings out the flavor in any dish.
