The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly, and all I could taste was SALT. The second time, I used half the fish sauce, black soy, and Golden Mountain sauce, and I used thinly sliced chicken instead of ground, and it was PERFECT. It was so good, I'm about to make it again. Drunken Noodle is one of those dishes I order at every Thai restaurant as a sort of litmus test, and even though they're all a little different, they all have a common flavor that I haven't been able to replicate at home. Until now. I think the secret is the black soy and Golden Mountain sauce (as long as you don't use too much).

Followed this recipe exactly and wasn't disappointed! This was my first attempt at Thai cooking, and I have to say this recipe gives some of my local restaurants a run for their money (at about a 1/4 of the cost for the ingredients, too!). My only criticism would be that my mouth is on FIRE! It's highly possible that I am just a big baby when it comes to heat, but a 1/4 cup of Thai chiles was just way too much for me and my man to handle. Will probably cut the amount of chiles in half next time. Makes a huge portion, so either cook for friends or prepare for left overs.

Fantastic! Very spicy and lots of flavor. Do make sure you use the correct soy sauces--it's not a salty dish, but will be if you use the wrong ingredients. Also make sure your skillet/wok is large enough to contain everything in this dish; it makes a lot! Only variation I made was to use chopped chicken (boneless/skinless thighs) instead of ground chicken. Will make again for sure!

Drunken Noodles is my favorite dish at our local Thai restaurant which prides itself on being fully authentic and having only Thai cooks. The only thing I changed in this recipe was the ground chicken, substituting sliced chicken cutlets instead. I have to say that this turned out amazing and incredibly close to what we get at our favorite place. I cut the recipe in half and used 8 Thai chilies and the flavor and heat were exactly what I was looking for. As previous reviews stated, make sure you get the right ingredients. Black soy sauce is not salty..it's sweet like molasses and golden mountain sauce is not nearly as salty as some of the soy sauces out there.

I've tried this recipe several times now, and frankly I think I just don't like it. Last night's meal was the worst - the flavor was mainly SALT, and although my family ate it, no one really said much. I tried subbing a bit of chicken broth for some of the soy sauce, so maybe that was it (and didn't have Thai basil so subbed Italian, didn't have palm sugar so used brown). I will look for better "Pad See Ew" or "Pad Kee Mai" recipes elsewhere - frankly I'm shocked that there are NONE on Epicurious! Wonder why?

Good recipe. I used half fish sauce and half oyster sauce and would recommend reducing the amount to a Tbsp of each. Also get a half lb pork shoulder and fire up the grill. Marinate it with some black soy sauce and a little salt and pepper and cook it on high for 5 min per side (10 min total). Slice it and add it at the end (to make sure its cooked all the way). Was fantastic!

This is an excellent recipe. I followed it exactly. The reason I give it 3 forks is the ground chicken thing. I did not like this. I would use non-ground pork or chicken next time...or even tofu.

Delicious. I might play around with it next time to get it a bit closer to my favorite Thai restaurant's version. I always order it with pork instead of chicken and that's the way I prepared this recipe. Either way, I recommend that you try it!

The version of this I made was delicious and very authentic, in my opinion, but I took away one fork because my version had little to do with the published recipe. I used 4 Thai peppers chopped with seeds, one package rice noodles, added an entire small cabbage chopped, and two large bell peppers, one red and one green. I used ground chicken in half and crumbled tempeh in the other half for the vegetarians in my group. The sauce was 1/4 cup each of thick soy sauce (black soy sauce), Golden mountain sauce, and tamari/oyster sauce combined. This was absurdly thick and strong, however, so I added one cup vegetable broth and a cup of water to the sauce. Used palm sugar as suggested by another reviewer but found it frustrating--it's very hard so you have to chop it up and even then it didn't want to dissolve (even in hot water). I gave up and used date sugar I had lying around. The final result was fantastic and everyone marveled at my Thai-abilities.

I was so disappointed in this recipe. I went to the Asian grocery store and purchased all the sauces. I ended up at a farmer's market for the veggies, and they didn't have Anaheim chiles or Thai basil, so I used a poblano and regular basil (so sad). Otherwise, I followed the recipe to a T...and it came out soooo salty! All we tasted was salt and heat..no complex flavors. My black soy sauce was not the consistency of molasses, so I don't know if that had something to do with it. But this recipe wasn't good enough to even try again after purchasing a different brand. So disappointing

followed the recipe to a 't'. this dish was a keeper... held true to all other reviews. we like things spicy, though, so the next time we make this, we will double the thai chiles and possibly try over rice... too much delicious broth not to be absorbed by something to eat.

This was delicious! My boyfriend gave it the seal of approval, and he's had the street food in Thailand. He said the smells reminded him of being back there. The sauces are not expensive to purchase, and remember to use fresh noodles! Freshly-made noodles prevents them from breaking up too much and getting mushy when thrown into the mix. Amazing, everyone should give this recipe a whirl! (Quick and easy to prepare too)

This is even better over rice. I've been working on this for while, trying to recreate Sripraphai's chicken with chili and basil. This is one of my favorite dishes in any restaurant in any cuisine. The drunken noodle recipe gave me a few pieces of the puzzle. At this point, I think I've improved on the restaurant version. Here are my suggestions: 1. Reduce the amount of chicken to ¾ lb. This should feed 3-4 if you have a starter. 2. Cut the garlic down to 6 large cloves, about 2 Tbs. 3. Use only 4 Thai chilies in the dish. You can heat up the portions individually. See #8 below. 4. Add a small sliced onion, cut lengthwise into long strips. Use an entire red bell pepper, cut into strips and halved. Saute the onion and bell pepper for a minute or two in a separate pan while the chicken cooks. If you wait to cook it with the chicken and sauce, you'll lose too much liquid. Add them back after the chicken is done. 5. Cook the chicken before you add the sauce. When it is almost done add the sauce. 6. Cut the Magi in half. Magi is pure salt. Use 4 Tbs light soy sauce, 4 Tbs fish sauce, and 2 Tbs Magi. 7. Make sure to use palm sugar. It's essential. You can't get the right flavor otherwise. Use 2 Tbs., a single blob diced up. Dissolve it in the sauce. 8. Triple the amount of Thai basil. Put 1 cup in at the end. Wilt it for a minute. Once you move the serving platter to the table add the remaining ½ cup. 9. Serve with Thai chilies cut up in fish sauce. Cut up 4 and add a couple of tablespoons of fish sauce. Let it sit for at least 10 minutes. You can use this to heat up the portion on your plate. 10. Serve with rice on the side. Enjoy.

NOTE: These "soy sauces" are NOT your regular soy sauce. To those to called this recipe too salty, that's probably because you used the wrong thing. These items are only available at a southeast asian market. Google it first to make sure you understand the difference. The black soy sauce is thick and sweet like molasses. The light soy sauce IS NOT LOW-SODIUM SOY SAUCE. It can, however, be substituted with a 50/50 mix of soy sauce and chicken broth with a touch of sugar added. As for the recipe as intended, this is awesome stuff. I used less garlic and sliced it rather than chopping to make it more mild. Also, be sure to chop your Thai chilis with gloves on. They're mighty spicy! Sambal might work as a substitute.

Rating: 3
We enjoyed this--did not expect it to replace the noodles from our favorite restaurants, though. If you like Thai food don't cut back on the fish sauce but instead you can cut back on some of the soy to reduce saltiness. I used up leftover roast pork rather than ground chicken which I'm not a big fan of. My Thai food experts say "drunken noodles" actually comes from it being a hangover remedy, not what you drink with it!

It took awhile for me to get this right and judging by other reviews, this is a recipe that deals well with customization. The recipe I now use, after 5-6 times + tinkering does not even feel the same as the original (but I think its closer than it looks). Here is my take own it: Ingredients: 1 half package of 1/4-inch-wide flat rice noodles 1/4 cup vegetable oil 3 tbsp. chili-garlic sauce (feel free to use more or less depending on how spicy you want it) 1 pound chicken, sliced or cubed 1/2 tbsp. fish sauce 1/4 cup black soy sauce 1/4 cup light soy sauce 1 tbsp. sugar 1 Red Bell Pepper 1 Anaheim Chili (charred and peeled) Broccoli and/or Sugar Snap Peas Sprinkle of Dried Thai Basil Leaves Preparation " Boil a large pan of water, when it reaches a boil turn off heat and submerge noodles in water for between 45-60 minutes. " Meanwhile, if using Anaheim chili, char over open flame and place in plastic bag to steam; when lukewarm rub, skin off, slice and set aside. " Similarly, if using broccoli or snap peas, blanch and set aside. " Heat oil in Wok over low heat to prevent burning. Add chili-garlic sauce and sauté two-three minutes. " Add sliced bell peppers, sauté for 1-2 minutes " Add chicken and next 4 ingredients; raise heat to medium-high or high and sauté until chicken is cooked through. " Add noodles, Anaheim chills and any blanched vegetables, toss to coat and let simmer 1-2 minutes. " Sprinkle with Thai basil and serve.

The thing that will take this recipe over the top is using fresh rice noodles. They are somewhat difficult to find, I tried a number of dried wide rice noodles and none compare to fresh. They come in sheets and must be used the same day as purchase. I live in Boston and have found them at Cmart asian market downtown in the refrigerated section. They sell out quick - but are SO worth it. The texture of the fresh noodle with the chili basil is exceptional !

This is one of my favourite recipes on Epicurious - I absolutely love it, and I make it whenever I have the opportunity. Generally I use the chicken, but I've made it with out (verdict: pretty good), or with tofu instead (great). I've also on occasion had to swap out the Thai basil for regular basil, I can't say that I can tell the difference, except that Thai basil looks a bit nicer. Also, I generally substitute the "nice cold beer or sparkling wine" for about 8 glasses of milk.

This was great with some changes. First of all, 2 packages of noodles would be too much. Also, I poured boiled water over my noodles and let them sit or about 15 minutes. i've heard you should never boil rice noodles because they can over cook too easily. I took the advice on the sauce and only used 1/4 teaspoon of fish sauce. I used 1/4 cup black soy sauce (crucial for making Thai food in my book) and 1/4 cup low-sodium soy sauce and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Then I add the juice of 1/2 a lemon. It seemed too tart so I added another teaspoon of sugar. I omitted the tomato and used red peppers instead of green and regular basil leaves. It may not be authentic but it's definitely a keeper in our house.

It's been some time since I printed the recipe and 1st read some reviews.....I should have checked back b4 making last nt. Way too much saltiness from the sauces, so next time will reduce those and add a splash of water. I was tasting the fish sauce even this a.m.! I used an 8oz. pkge of rice noodles with 1/2 of recipe and it was a good ratio. I'll also use less Thai chiles next time, it was fiery! Definitely wear plastic gloves when handling these peppers, they're dangerous. Enjoy!

Rating: 4
There is FAAAAAAAR too much nam pla in this recipe- I'd use maybe 1/4 t. Also, it's just too huge a recipe to be made in one sautée; I'd make half at most. Also, the correct type of basil is key- DO NOT USE ITALIAN BAISL- and add toward end of cooking to develop the smokiness. That said, a little tweaking -MUCH less soy and fewer chilies as the Thai variety are quite hot- should yield fantastically fragrant, delicious noodles.

This is nowhere near real Pad Kee Mao. Tomatoes? I think not. In fact, I've never seen a recipe for Pad Kee Mao call for tomatoes and I thought somehow that was a mistake. Also bell peppers? Not authentic. Not even close. This dish is supposed to be *very* spicy hot, and should include thai peppers, green peppercorns, and NOT "Anaheim chiles or Italian frying peppers, or 2 green bell peppers" Using thai basil is critical for the correct flavor. Meat is optional, not required. I'm not sure how this made it's way into a recipe mag like Epicurious, but it should be removed.

My husband has requested this several times. I live in a community that doesn't have some of the ingredients, but online Thai ingredients are easy to find and they are delivered to my door.

Made this dish the other day and it was delicious. I found all the ingredients at a local thai market. The authenticity of the ingredients made all the difference in the world! There were many fish sauces to choose from and the salesman said it's basically sodium content. I chose the one with the lowest sodium since I was using black soy and Golden Mountain sauce. I would recommend adding Thai basil, cilantro, tomatoes, lime and bell pepper to suit your own taste. (It made a huge difference with me) Adjusting the amount of sugar is essential depending on the brand of sauces you buy.

I made this for my family, and it turned out great! I did make a few adjustments though--used two boneless skinless chicken breasts cut up into small pieces (didn't like the idea of ground chicken for some reason) and marinated for a little bit in a mixture of olive oil/rice vinegar/chili paste. i also only used half the amount of chilies because i didn't want it to be overwhelmingly spicy--it turned out to be a perfect level for my taste. finally i added a few more veggies--sliced carrots and some chopped up napa cabbage. everyone loved it.

I've made this recipe now three times. The heat also comes from the Anaheim chiles. Who knew! So I've reduced the Anaheim to just one and use one green (or red) pepper and I also remove 3/4's of the seeds from the thai chilies. And trust me it's still a hot dish. The drunken noodles from the restaurant also add; bean sprouts, chinese broccoli, and large green onions. Which I'll try adding next time. Inexpensive dish to make after you have the required sauces in your fridge.

I love Drunken Noodles and this recipe seemed easy so I tackled it and it turned out amazing the first try. But it does involve a lot of cutting and preparation. I went to a huge Asian store for the 4 required sauces and some of the Asian vegetables. The store was out of Thai Basil so I had to use regular basil but used authentic ingredients otherwise. From comments by others I made the following changes to the recipe. Only get one package of rice noodles and only get one pound (1.5 was too much) of ground meat (chicken or pork - I used pork and would highly recommend it!) I replaced half the golden mtn sauce with oyster sauce and forgot to add 2 scallions with the garlic but will next time. The heat comes from the seeds in the Thai chilies. We left about 80% of the seeds, and it was hot. The recipe was delicious but looks nothing like the Drunken Noodles you are used to getting at the restaurant. Will definitely make this recipe again and again.

I loved this recipe - the flavor tastes exactly like what I order at Thai restaurants without the grease. I took readers' advice to use one pkg of rice noodles and that was enough for 3 big servings. I had trouble with the noodles getting sticky and rolling up so I will add more oil to the boiling water next time. I used 1/8 cup each fish sauce, thick soy sauce and lite soy sauce. For moderate spice I added 2 banana peppers sliced into rectangular pieces with their seeds then used 1 red thai chili (I was nervous about the heat, but could have used another chili). To make it more like a restaurant, I added one small white onion and shrimp - no tomatoes. For flavor, I added 3 stalks of Thai basil and 2 of regular basil from my garden - using half in the sauce during cooking and the rest at the end, plus a few drops of basil oil. Excellent!

I love this recipe. I have prepared it with ground chicken, turkey, deer and elk. I always add lots of fresh basil and the tomatoes (which are wonderful mixed in with all the heat). The proper amount of soy sauces and fish sauce takes some tweaking. I tend to mix light and dark and have experimented with different brands. And oh yes, definitely don't add more than one packet of noodles. This is a favourite at my house and has become one at many of my friends' too.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. Black or dark soy sauce is also called Kecap Manis (interestingly enough, the first word is the source of our word "ketchup") and is definitely worth having on hand. I recommend the 3 Crabs brand of fish sauce, it has the best flavour, and no msg. (also no crabs.) Once you've gotten your collection of bottles and sauces from your Asian Market, this is a very easy dish to buy for and throw together. Cut back a touch on the chiles if you're nervous, but that lingering warmth they give coupled with the cool flavours of basil and tomato really make the dish great. I prefer ground pork with this recipe.

Rating: 3
Would've given this four stars, except that there were no specifics as to whether or not to seed the Thai chiles. I used the full amount, seeds and all, and boy, did the recipe live up to its name! Next time, I'll cut back on the amount of chile seeds I include. (I like spice, but this was a bit much!) Thai chiles (aka bird chiles) are small but deadly...they make jalapenos look wimpy by comparison. (Which is why I was surprised to read reviews where some didn't find this recipe spicy...it's all in the peppers!) You can also use ground turkey (as I did) in place of the chicken. I was doubtful about the tomatoes, but they provide a cooling counterpart to the spiciness of this dish. I also found the flavoring (from the fish, black soy and Golden Mountain sauces) to work nicely and are integral to the dish (FYI:.black soy sauce is more like molasses in consistency and taste.)

We were very excited to see this recipe -- it's one of our favorite dishes at our local Thai restaurant. To match that dish, we did not use the Anaheim chiles, bell peppers or tomatoes, but used a bunch of Chinese Broccoli (stems only) instead. Each diner added hot chile oil to taste, as we do at the restaurant. Our homemade version tasted just like the purchased one! We prefer extra Thai basil, and used 3 oz. We would have been happier with 4 or 5 oz. of basil. Purchased at our local Asian grocery/variety store, the price is reasonable enough to do just that the next time we make this.

After reading the reviews, I had high expectations, but this dish lacks depth of flavor. I used pork instead of chicken, which make it nicely greasy (truly!), added green onions at the end and used the full noodle amount. Didn't seem too salty, although both my soy sauces were bordering on low sodium. Tomatoes were great, as were bean spout and lime slices as condiments. But something is missing here. Plan to feed an army with the full noodle amount.

This is a really great recipe and it goes to 4 forks with some changes (it always pays to read the reviews!) : - As others have stated, the recipe calls for WAY too many noodles - I halved the amount. - My peppers were not that spicy, as some others have noted, but they impart a great pepper flavor. I added crushed red pepper and sriracha sauce to bring up the heat. I also chopped 2 scallions towards the end of the frying. This is a keeper.

This is great. We have omitted the tomatoes because they got a little soggy and didn't seem to add that much flavor to the dish.

A word of warning: Use gloves when chopping and handling the Thai chiles. I didn't, and the fingertips of my left hand were on fire for hours! The recipe is excellent, though. After reading prior suggestions, I added one chopped onion, and skipped the tomatoes. I used one Anahiem chile and two red bell peppers (for color). I used the black soy sauce, but then used 2 T. of oyster sauce and 2 T. of light soy sauce. With 1/4 cup of chopped Thai chiles with their seeds, the noodles were very spicy -- next time, I'll reduce the amount of those fiery little peppers (and wear gloves when I handle them).

This is a keeper, with a few notes--if you use Thai BIRD chiles for the Thai chiles, 1/4 c. will take the top of your head off (but in a very delicious way.)

The only change I made to this recipe was to cut down about 1/3 of the noodles. I used the exact amount of seasonings and spices (the correct type of soy sauce - VERY important), and neither me nor my husband thought it was too salty. Spice wise, I thought it was plenty spicy enough, especially if you chopped up the thai chiles very finely (and kept the seeds in). Plus, the anaheim peppers we used had a kick to them, but would have been bland if you just used bell peppers. I would definitely make this again. We have plenty of leftovers!

I did not have all of the ingredients so I modified the recipe. I used ramen noodles and did not use the broth packets. I added onions. I did not have ground chicken so I used hamburger. I only used the soy sauce, and fish sauce. I increase the sugar to 2 TBS because I used 1/4 cup of chili paste (in place of Thai chilis) to balance out the heat. I did not have fresh basil so I used dried basil instead. My parents loved it. I will keep this recipe and I am going to try the recipe as written.

I would also suggest not salting the water - I never do for pad thai and it worked well for this recipe too. Also, rinse the noodles. My family really enjoyed this recipe with those modifications.

This is a very good recipe, but there are a few thing that you should know. Unless you plan on feeding an army, cut this recipe in half. If you get the exact ingredients that it calls for, it will not be too salty. Golden Mt sauce is lower in salt than regular soy sauce. If you don't live near a Chinatown or have a good Asian market, use reduced sodium sauce. Use ground pork instead of chicken, and skip the tomatoes. They don't belong in this dish. Cut the anaheim peppers in half. Calls for way too much. I will definately make this again.

Very good recipe. Though it can be altered a bit without sacrificing the flavor to make it more heart friendly. Word to the wise: Kittenpurr - MSG and Salt are NOT the same thing. Also, I bet your friend Giog8X is Asian too. Nobody is trying to be racist on a cooking website! Let's keep things civil here!

MSG is the sodium salt of glutamic acid. It is not the same as table salt.

I've ordered this dish often at Sripraphai - the beef version is one of my favorites - and it is not too salty and has very good spice; it is also served with a small dish of chilis in vinegar on the side. I'm disappointed to hear that the recipe is salty. I'm writing to advise that people heed the advice of the others who have tried the recipe and be judicious with the seasonings. Remember that all of the sauces will have salt in them, start with less than recommended and add to taste.

I'm giving this recipe 1 fork because I haven't tried it yet but needed to post on GioX68's racist post. First, salt and MSG are the same thing. Second,"chinese food is not asian food"...uhm, what? I know you correct yourself later but why leave that in your review then? As a Chinese person I find that insulting. Chinese food, as with any food, is as healthy or unhealthy as your cooking style dictates. Third, spelling and punctuation are your friend.

way too much salt here Id make the complete sauce use some for cooking then use some after also add an asian flair to the table put some sauce in ramakins give everyone one to choose their own flavor strength theyll be seasoning to their own taste and still telling you how good it is also asian food is tricky lots of mysterious ingredients and hidden MSG and salt find a good asian cookbook with an emphasis on health chinese food is not asian food well it is but the most unhealthy of all try to find a THAI food cookbook great natural flavors

I made this for a large dinner party and it was a hit. Everyone loved it and asked for the receipe. I didn't thik it was too salty but it didn't quite have enough kick so I added some red chili pepper. I'll definitely make it again.

I agree with the review that said that this recipe is too salty. Additionally, it had no zip to it. I kept adding the chili sauce! I am not sure I even care to tweak it in another try. However, the daughter's boyfriend loved it.

I had to substitute ground turkey for ground chicken. I didn't feel it was too salty but I did feel the sauce lacked a little depth might take others suggestions in the future to zing it up a bit.

Ugh. What a disappointment! Prepared exactly as written, this recipe is way, way, WAY too salty! It resembled the drunken noodles from our fabulous local place in looks alone; the flavor was nowhere near good. Next time, I'll follow Zen Zero's lead by adding onions, using oyster sauce and cutting way back on the soy sauce, probably only using half the light and none of the regular.
