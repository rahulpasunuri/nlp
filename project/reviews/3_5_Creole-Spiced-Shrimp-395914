Great recipe! Very easy. Next time I make it I will omit the salt, though.

There's way too much salt in this recipe. I doublechecked because I only made half the amount of shrimp but 2 tsp of salt for 2 lbs of shrimp is way too much. 1/2 tsp per pound. Trust me. Anyway, I didn't cook it in packets, but in a covered glass baking dish and was very pleased with the results. In fact, I'm going to make my New Orlean BBQ shrimp recipe like that from now on. This recipe attempts to update that classic. It has the onion, lemon, bay, Worcestershire, butter, salt and pepper that you must have to make a true New Orlean BBQ shrimp. However, it omitted any garlic, which is another must. Using sambal oelek was interesting and I liked it in lieu of cayenne, but I much prefer my old recipe and will the baked/steaming technique here.

So good we had to have it two nights in a row. I added grits like someone else suggested (thank you) and though I should have sprayed the aluminum foil with oil it was really good. I mean, how often do you eat lemon slices?!

I need to try this one again. I prepared the packets in aluminum foil as directed. I set my grill at medium-high cooked the packets for 30 minutes. It was too long on my grill. The broth had evaporated and the shrimp was overcooked. The flavor was still good. Served this with garlic bread and a good salad. I may give this one another go at either a shorter cook time or lower heat.

Very tasty. I used a covered baking dish instead of aluminum foil. If I'm grilling I'll use aluminum foil, but otherwise why not use a baking dish and be green? Also,instead of using Old Bay seasoning, I easily added the spices by using the Old Bay recipe online. They are all standard kitchen spices we have on hand.

Excellent! Made as directed except I substituted chicken broth for the water. My husband, who is not a shrimp lover, thought it was fantastic. Toasted sourdough French bread to soak up juices and served with oven roasted asparagus.

Yum Yum! I halved the recipe and used parchment bags and it came out perfect. I also used white wine in place of the water but next time I think I'll leave it out altogether as there was more than enough broth. The flavors were outstanding though.

Great dish. I have made several times on my grill.It is very forgiving on the timing. I have also added cooked grits to the packets as well. A creole shrimp and grits.

This was ridiculously easy to make. I purchased shrimp from Whole Foods that had already been split and deveined, and the only change I made was to use about half the amount of butter in each packet. I placed steamed corn on the cob halves in individual pasta bowls and dumped the packet contents over them. We ate the entire meal with our hands. A great weeknight meal - fabulous!
