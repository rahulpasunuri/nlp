This was disapointing. In the first 25 minutes of baking time, the apples almost burned, but the squash was not cooked through, and the second 5 minutes was not enough additional time. The sauce was interesting by itself, but a little odd with the squash.

The filling, by itself, was tasty, but didn't blend well with the squash. The squash still needed additional cooking time even though I cooked it 10 minutes longer than the recipe suggested. Just not worth the effort.
