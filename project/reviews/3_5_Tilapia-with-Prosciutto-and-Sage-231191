Sage and Prosciutto flavors are spot on. I used the frozen Costco Tilapia fillets. I think I got the Prosciutto to thick because the fish didn't cook evenly... I think I would use thinner prosciutto and more sage. Probably spread a sage, shallot, butter mix on the fish and then wrap the prosciutto. I did add pepper. The parts without prosciutto were under salted... meh. Anyway... maybe add a white wine sauce... there is work to be done!

This was a very easy and flavorful way to make tilapia. I observed the cooking time in the recipe and the fish turned out perfect. The only thing I did differently was chop the sage and sprinkle it onto the fish with black pepper before wrapping it in the prosciutto. Delicious.

Actually I'd give it 2.5 forks. It was very good, just not "delicious" or "exceptional" -- I followed the recipe precisely. I thought it was a nice confluence of flavors and tasted very Northern Italian. I agree with others who say not to add any salt as the prosciutto already adds it. Our prosciutto ended up a little leathery in texture - perhaps it was too thick or thin? I told the deli not to slice paper thin, but I think it was too thin. I may try it again with thicker slices.

This was a big hit... I cut back on the oil as suggested by someone else. We'll be having this again.

Prosciutto and olive oil, how can you go wrong.

I used tilapia and snapper and both were delicious wrapped in the prosciutto. I used dried sage because I made a smaller amount of tilapia and didn't want to waste fresh sage. Black pepper is all it needs and the prosciutto is salty enough..no need for additional salt or spice. I made a garlic/lemon green bean side and it worked well together. Can't wait to make it again!

Easy, yes. But also pretty bland. I was going to make a white wine/caper pan sauce to put over these and wish I had. Tilapia is such a mild fish. It needed something more.

This recipe is quick and easy. I served the finished fish warm over a ceaser salad. The only thing I changed was the sage. I omitted it and added some other spices. I was afraid that the sage would be too strong for the salad

This recipe is very good, extremely easy and simple, but it doesn't "wow" me. We had it for a simple midweek dinner at home, and that is exactly what this recipe is. I made the recipe exactly as written, except using dried sage instead of fresh. Sparing use of dried sage (the same amount as the pepper that you use), gives a nice Sage flavor to the dish. I did not salt the fish at all prior to cooking, and it didn't need any added salt at the table (and I salt everything!). You can definitely cut down on the oil by about half, because the fat from the prosciutto gets added to the pan as you cook. This is a nice, light dish for a midweek supper when you want to do something a little bit different. It's easy and quick.

Made this last night as written. A winner at our house. Next time I will chop the sage instead of just using the leaves whole.

I don't give out four forks very often, but this recipe deserves it. So simple, so delicious. Will become a standard in our house.

Wow, so easy and so tasty. It's a bit on the salty side, but if you like ham/bacon flavors, you'll love this way to enhance a very mild fish.

I'm so sorry I forgot to review this! It is a great recipe: easy, very few ingredients, quick preparation, and delicious flavor! This and the "Tilapia with Chile Lime Butter" are two of the best recipes on the site -- great ways to dress up fish!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was very nice. I would suggest to put about 2 small leaves of sage per filet and regulate the amount of salt because of the prosciutto.

Rating: 3
Followed recipe exactly and it was delish. Don't reach automatically for the salt as the prosciutto is salty to begin with. Will be an excellant company dish if you have fresh sage handy.

surprisingly good and unusual no need for butter just olive oil

This was incredibly easy, had really great flavor and my whole family liked it. Though no one else mentioned doing this, I didn't have fresh sage on hand and so rubbed a modest amount of dried sage onto each fillet. I would definitely do this again - it was subtle and very nice. I used butter this time, but will definitely use olive oil next time around to lighten it up. Served with spinach sauteed with shallots and couscous.

Excellent dish. I personally would skip the butter as the prosciutto adds enough extra fat. We did the butter but I think it would be fine w/o. I too would add more sage and followed the recomendation to add the fresh cracked pepper. I judge a recipe by if I would serve it to guests, this one makes the grade by a long shot.

This is a simply fantastic recipe, one that we keep making over and over again. Complex flavors with an uncomplicated preparation. We've only used olive oil but it's been great. Highly recommended!

Turned out pretty good, and will make it again. Sage is tasty but can be an overpowering herb. Be careful not to overcook the tilapia and prosciutto, especially if you decide to cook it on a grill. It is nice to have the tilapia tender.

As suggested, I also used a bit of butter and some extra sage. I thought that the combination worked well, I liked it, and rounded up 2 1/2 forks to 3. I will definately make this again.

The simplest dishes are always the best. I made this with Orange Roughy and it turned out great. I think the little bit of butter in the pan with the oil made a big difference. Like others, next time I'm using more sage.

i really enjoyed this recipe. I made it exactly as written. the tilapia flavor still showed through the sage and proscuitto, but as a proscuitto lover, I was glad that it took over the meal! I used one/two sage leaves, as the recipe stated, but it could have used more. I will definitely make this again.

Fantastic. Simple. Great amalgam of flavors. Smaller fillets or larger proscuitto slices are best.

Easy and pretty tasty. A nice different way to fix fish. I think I'd even by-pass the sage next time.

Easy to prepare and make and so tasty! I actually used butter instead of the oil, and found that it complemented the fish very well. Next time I will use less of the sage. I will be making this dish again and again.

Very delicious, simple, nice presentation,also. For those who found it lacking in taste, maybe you need to buy a better quality prosciutto. Definitely try it!

I am a newlywed from philly, and also a new cook, so I am always looking for easy recipes. This was definetly easy, however not very flavorful. The sage was an awesome combination with the proscuitto, however not powerful enough to carry the dish. I even added 3times more sage than the recipe called for. It could have used some kind of sauce, maybe hollandase--?

Yum! I loved this recipe! It was delicious and so easy! My husband thought it was a bit too salty but that may have been my fault. I may have sprinkled a bit more salt on than needed. I will be making it again soon (minus the salt for hubby).

I have no idea what Lauri from Austin is talking about. I too think Tilapia is mild, but I found the taste of this dish sublime - the prosciutto provided the saltiness, and the sage was very mild and complimentary. I served this with an orzo and asparagus side dish, and an Italian pinot grigio. Fantastic and well-received!

We loved it! No complaints. We will definately fix this again. Quick, easy and healthful.

Finally -- a fish recipe that my husband and I (neither of whom cares for fish as a general rule) actually enjoy! Quick, easy, presents well and tastes delicious.

While the recipe is quick and easy, I discovered that I simply don't like the flavor combination. Part of tilapia's attraction for me is the mild, light flavor, and the prosciutto overwhelmed it (and added grease besides). Others who are fonder of prosciutto may enjoy this dish more.
