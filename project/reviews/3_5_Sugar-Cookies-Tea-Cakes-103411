I think this was a GREAT recipe! It wasn't "ok" like previous raters said, it was AWESOME. Bow to the cookie!

These are ok, but we have tea cakes in the south 1 c. shortening, 2 cups sugar, 4 eggs, 4-5 c flour, 4 tsp baking powder, 1 Tbs vanilla, the very best real old recipe

The cookies puff up when baking so they lose their fluted edge. Did not have a good flavor. Wouldn't recommend.

I grew up in Alabama too, and these are not the least bit like my Grandmother's Tea Cakes (for which sadly, no one in my family ever got the recipe). In all honesty, these were really no better than slice-and-bake. The tea cakes I know and love are more cakey-my Grandmother would butter them and stick two together like a sandwich cookie. I'll keep looking for a similar recipe...maybe one with yeast.

So close to my great-grandma's recipe. Eating these cookies opened a floodgate of memories. Since she passed this Feb, I 've been obsessed with replicating her little treasures. Now you guys have me on the right track...

I'm not sure how these cookies are suppose to turn out mine were very flat although tasty. I always thought of tea cake as a much thicker and somewhat crumbly type of cookie. We don't have white lily four in our area but I did use self-rising cake flour made the recipe 2xs and both times the same. Any suggestions or is this how they are suppose to look?

Wonderful smells fill the home and happy memories of childhood flood the heart as these cookies come hot from the oven. They work wonderfully when dough is well chilled and the taste is delightful when warm. Still good when cold, but for perfect enjoyment, fresh is the best. Grandma would be proud.

I have been searching for a plain, everyday sugar cookie and used this as the basis for the one I developed. Instead of 1 c. butter, I used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 Crisco, creamed with 3/4 c. sugar, i tsp vanilla, 1 egg, and 2 tbsp milk. I added 1/2 tsp baking soda and 3/4 tsp salt to the 2 1/2 cups of White Lily unbleached all purpose. Rolled walnut sized balls and flattened with glass bottom, dipped in sugar. Baked 3 pans in convection oven for 6-8 min.(350) Bottom pans finished first. Just what I was looking for. Would be good decorated for Holiday cookie.

I have not tried the receipe yet, but I would like to thank the person for putting this on the internet. I have been searching for this recipe for ages. There were 2 people in family with the recipe and they are both deceased. I loved tea cakes as a child and now my children can enjoy them. Thanks so much.

These cookies were delicious. My favorite cookies are sugar cookies and when I saw this recipe, I had to try it. I liked them better when they were warm, though.
