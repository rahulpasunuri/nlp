Followed the directions to a T and they were very blah. My kids wouldn;t touch them and I wasn;t thrilled about eating them either, just not worth the calories, nothing exciting about them at all

I made these muffins because of the majority of positive reviews. I was looking for an easy recipe to bring to a football tailgate. They were horrible... okay maybe not horrible, but definitely not good. At a large table (where lots of people weren't picky) these were leftovers. I would NOT make them again. I am sure there are many other corn muffin recipes that would be better received. In summary.... they are moist because they are greasy but overall they are pretty flavorless.

These were okay but I almost just like plain Jiffy muffins better. They turned out really dense. I didn't use muffin cups and I regretted it. I liked the idea of putting cottage cheese in them and think I'll try this for another corn muffin recipe.

These turned out great! Very moist & tasty without tasting of cottage cheese. I made half the recipe to try it out and they're just great. Did not use papers in muffin cups, just sprayed them and they all just popped out after cool. Next time will add more cheddar cheese and maybe some green onion. Will certainly make again!

Also, I made these in a non-stick muffin pan without paper liners and they just fell out. Save the paper.

These muffins are the bomb! I am planning a dinner for 200+ and corn bread muffings are on the menu. I've tried several recipes over the last few days and these are by far the best! I made exactly as the recipe directs and they are light, rise well, have a sweet flavor and are generally delicious. I used sharp cheddar cheese. As a variation, I also made them adding 1 cup creamed corn and 1 can diced jalapenos, drained. They needed about 10 minutes more in the oven and were heavier, but good. I'd stick with the original however, it doesn't need embelishment. To the cook below, who asked if anyone had tried making this without a mix, I did that as well as I usually don't use mixes either. They were light and okay, but honestly, they're better with the mix. Go ahead and cheat!!!

Has anyone ever tried making this without using a mix? Just curious. I don't use mixes but I've been looking for a good corn/cheese muffin recipe.

These muffins taste really good! But if you don't cool them before you try to eat them, they stick like the dickens to the muffin papers. Next time I'll try spraying the papers with my oil sprayer before adding batter and see if that helps. I also used regular milk and cottage cheese (not low fat) and they worked nicely. Also, I think that my muffin tins are standard size, so the amount of batter could have made 13 or 14 muffins. I did make only 12, but they all sort of oozed out the top and fused to each other in a couple of places... not a problem, just could have had more muffins. Very tasty with tomato soup!

The muffins were moist and delicious. My 3 year old daugther loved them. I used a parmesan cheese from Wisconsin instead of the cheddar, but next time I will try with reggiano.

Nothing to write home about. I was hoping the cheese would add to the flavor, but I believe it only added calories

I thought this was delicious. I had a problem with the paper liners sticking to the muffins but other than that, I would make this again. Went well with tomato soup.

Good. I would add more cheddar cheese the next time, and less cottage.

They are extremely moist and they taste great too. Next time I might use less cottage cheese, as that flavor came through a little stronger than I prefer. I used a honey corn muffin mix so I could incorporate the advice from stefano but not be so wildly creative as to offend the fragile ego of matty.

Not being able to let well enough alone, I added 1/4 cup of real maple syrup the first time. and then 1/2 Cup of honey. Honey rules. Try it with the melted butter. Delish with the spicy chilly recipe also provided on the Wide Wonderful Web by this most honerable web citizen: WWW.EPICURIOUS.COM!

These were very moist and delicious. They stuck to the muffin papers so the next time I make them I'll probably bake them a while longer and let them cool for a longer period of time. They were a real hit with my family. I had them as a side dish to grilled chicken breasts and steamed asparagus. I will definitely make them again.

Forgot to add the eggs, turned out delicious. Would definitely make again.
