Love the earthy taste of mushrooms with the fish. I used a mixed medley of really good quality mushrooms. Used fresh thyme. One of my fave trout recipes.

Used fresh thyme, omitted parsley and prosciutto, reduced onion and halved recipe overall, then cooked fish on top of vegetables, skin side up and drizzled with lemon. Served with green salad, brown rice, and "Pumpkin, Corn, and Lemongrass Soup" from this site. Delicious.

This turned out so well... we made it with both branzino and trout. The branzino was the favorite of the two. Proportionally we used more onion and celery than the recipe called for which we liked and made more of the mixture so to have some extra to spoon on the side.

Delicious! Made trout palatable for even the trout hater in my family. Gives the trout great flavor.

I thought this was delicious. I used a mix of conventional and shitake mushrooms, and added a bit of truffle oil on the fish when closed and in the mushroom mix as well. Omitted the celery and prosciutto, used fresh thyme, and used shallots instead of onion. My significant other dislikes the taste of trout, but this mix completely avoided the typical trout fishy flavor--and good flavor did come through. Delicious!

This is an easy recipe to make, and I had all of the ingredients handy. The fish came out perfectly cooked at 30 minutes. However, I agree with the other reviewers that the mushroom stuffing is far too overpowering for the subtle trout. We dumped the stuffing out and didn't eat it. Next time, I'm going to simply salt and pepper the fish cavity, squeeze a lemon over, and pour melted butter over everything, then bake for slightly less time. I have learned my lesson; this is the third time I've tried to stuff good trout, and each time I swear to just let the fish speak for itself next time.

Terrible! The mushrooms and seasonings were too much for the trout. Also,the cooking time produced a very dry piece of fish.

Was quite good with commercial mushrooms; I expect mixed wild mushrooms would earn 4*.

Although the mushroom filling was delicious, my husband and I felt it overpowered the trout. Don't think it's a matter of reducing the amount of filling or changing proportions. Filling is just too rich for a delicate fish like trout. The filling covers up the flavor of the trout and does not enhance it. I substituted bacon for the proscuito, the only modification.

SUBTLE & SATISFYING. WOULD MAKE AGAIN. NICE COMBINATION OF INGREDIANTS. SUBSTITUTED BACON/ NO CELERY/ SAUTED LET COOL THEN STUFFED TROUT. LINGERING AFTER TASTE/ MY CRITERIA.

To make this recipe healthier, I cut out all butter and veg oil and used some EVOO instead. It came out really flavorful and yummy. I used trout filets and just spooned the mixture over the fish in a baking dish. Substituted button mushrooms for the wild mushrooms and still came out great! Definitely try this recipe!

I didn't have any celery, lemon, or proscuitto. I made anyway and it turned out well. It had a robust but not overpowering flavor which complemented the trout well. Next time, I would probably add more thyme or use fresh thyme as I hardly detected it.

Initially this recipe did not appeal to me since I've never made a stuffing which didn't contain some sort of adherence ingredient. However after preparing and tasting I couldn't get enough. The ingredients blended well with the ambiance of the trout meat, an outdoorsy type smell and taste. I modified the recipe slightly by using a much bigger trout and stuffing its cavity.

I found this recipe to be simple and very yummy. I didn't have any fresh parlsey on hand, so I substituted fresh basil from my garden. Other than that, I didn't modify the recipe and had a quite satisfying meal. I will definitely make it again.

Excellent! Didn't have whole trout, so used filets, but sauteed crimini, portabella and shitake 'rooms with red onion and fresh basil in butter. Put the trout in tinfoil, topped it with the mixture, wrapped it up and let it bake in the oven for 20 minutes. Would make this for company.

Didn't use the prosciutto because I don't eat meat but the stuffing was very good just the same. Although the stuffing seemed a bit overwhelming in taste for delicate trout, it may be better paired with a dark, rich fish like Sockeye Salmon. Quite easy to prepare but I used one trout and it took at least 45 mins. to bake.

I had to substitute talpia for trout because I couldn't find trout, and it turned out dry. I liked the filling. But my husband didn't care for the dish at all.

One of my most requested recipes. I'm a big prosciutto fan, so usually increase that portion. Like other cooks, would like to try this with other fish, but in Colorado, those can be hard to come by!

Very nice.

Delicious! Used one large whole sea trout and with left over stuffing that wouldn't fit I made a creamy sauce served separately which was great. My weekend guests were very impressed and it was really easy to make.

Not only was this the best trout I have made, it's probably the best I've ever eaten. The flavors are luscious and well-balanced. The savory stuffing livens up the mild tasting trout perfectly, but I'd like to try it with other fish as well. A real plate-licker!

This is my new favorite fish recipe! I can't wait to make it for company, having tested it on my husband. I cut back on the butter and oil. Sprayed the skillet with an oil spray. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I always remove the gills from the portobello mushrooms. This is easy to prepare, and delicious.

After dragging myself into the woods for 14 km, I probably would have eaten the trout raw. Fortunately I discovered this recipe and didn't have to. We loved it! Great taste and presentation. Please send any hints on boning a fish while still keeping it whole for presentation.

I cooked it for some friends with some fresh Lake Trout. It was really easy to make and it was right deadly. I got rave reviews on it. I would make it again and i gave away the reipe. Excellent dish

This recipe wins the awards! Absolutely delicious. Instead of trout, I used flounder and kept it rolled together with toothpicks. How flavorful (and it's enhanced by adding parmesan to the mushroom mixture). The rolling effect keeps the fish moist and tender. What a mouth-watering dish.

I brought home two 2 pound yellowtail snappers from two hours away with no idea how I would prepare them for company. This was a great solution! I had to substitute 8 ounces cultivated mushrooms for the wild but I did have 2 ounces prosciutto frozen and used fresh thyme. I cut way back on the fat as suggested, using 1 tsp oil & 1 tsp margarine for the stuffing. I baked a little longer at 375. It was delicious. Next time I'll try trout.

I had never cooked a trout before in my life, but the first time I tried this recipe it came out so great that everyone raved. It was realtively simple, tasty, and even converted a hardcore pan-fried trout fan.....so I'm making it for him again tonight!

"Restaurant quality" my husband told me, although I had substituted the wild mushroom with regular white button mushroom, and I didn't have prosciutto, so I used bacon instead.

My husband, an avid fly fisherman, brings home trout regularly. This is an exceptional way to prepare trout. Definitely restaurant quality. I also use less oil, and I don't hesitate to just use portobello mushrooms. I'm now searching for other trout recipes, and I will be lucky indeed to find one of this splendor.

This is the best Trout dish I have ever tasted, even better than any I have ordered from a restaurant. It was easy to make, few ingredients and delicious. Even my picky teenager raved about it.
