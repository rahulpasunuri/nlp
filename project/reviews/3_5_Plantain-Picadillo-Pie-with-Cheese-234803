I've made this recipe several times now, usually for potlucks, and it's always a big hit. The plantain crust takes some time, but it's really delicious. Plus it's gluten-free! Sometimes I've done it with a regular pastry crust and that works great, too. I've done the basic recipe and lots of variations on it -- different spices (like cilantro or cloves), turkey instead of beef, etc. In general, I add a about 1/2 cup more liquid (tomato sauce, broth or wine) and another tablespoon of corn meal -- that helps it hold together and slice a little better. I also like to add a little red pepper for extra zing.

Excellent! I baked the plantains for a healthier dish. Lovely blend of flavors.

I strayed kinda far from the recipe, in that I made the different but similar recipe the picadillo. I also threw this together without planning, so I did not have the Queso cheese, so I substituted brie and cheddar cheese. It was good, I'd like to try it with the Queso Fresca. On a different note, for those that find the plaintain part time consuming, or too dry (they probably weren't ripe) they sell sliced cooked sweet plantains in the freezer section (I think it is goya). You just nuke them for a few minutes to heat and then you could put them in the recipe...that would make this alot easier to throw together on a week night, and at least you know the plantains are ripe. I would make this again for sure.

I've made this recipe several times for special occasions and wow'd my guests. I actually prefer to make this recipe but use cooked, shredded pork in place of the ground beef - it is AMAZING that way. I've also made single-serving pies in muffin pans that were a big hit. This recipe can be time-consuming, mostly on account of cooking the plantains, but it's worth it. Queso fresco is the cheese to use. I've seen it at WalMart in their supermarket dairy aisle. If you can't find it, you may want to just skip the cheese, or use something like mozzarella. Feta and the like are much stronger and not the same at all. Will definitely make many more times!

I used farmer's cheese instead of queso blanco, which helped make the dish feel less rich, although I don't mind extra cheesy. :) I'll sprinkle some kosher salt on the plantains as they come out of the pan next time too. These flavors reminded me a lot of the stuffed Indian bread recipe from the Sundays at Moosewood cookbook.

delicious meat mixture however the plantain crust was found to be very dry. Substituting feta cheese did not work well and I wonder if some blend of cream/ricotta/cottag e cheese might better provide the texture of quesa fresca

Latino boyfriend loved this. Very hearty and quite easy to prepare. Would make an excellent potluck dish.

This is delicious, but VERY rich. Have a good salad to go along with it. I added some green peas for a little color to the beef mixture. I've made an almost identical beef dish with a cornbread topping that I actually like better. (Which surprises me because I love plantains.) This dish is a little time-consuming and messy with the plantain prep for the crust, but they are so tasty!
