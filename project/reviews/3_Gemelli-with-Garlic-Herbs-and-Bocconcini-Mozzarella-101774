My husband and I both thought this was a great, light, summer pasta dish. I didn't use as much basil, and left the arugula out and we had a ton of roasted veggies on the side. The raw garlic really gives it a punch, so you must love garlic to eat it raw in this recipe.

My husband and I love this recipe! I made a few minor changes- I leave out the arugula, and I saute the garlic just a bit before adding. Sometimes we'll add some cubed grilled chicken, to make it a little heartier. Great recipe!

Healthy, fresh and summery. A delight for our finicky Scandinavian friend.

I too made some adjustments to this recipe. I cut up a small onion in circles, sauteed it with a bit of sugar for about 6 or 7 minutes, added the garlic and then added spinach instead of arugula. Then just to complicate matters, I used a soy mozzarella instead of bocconcini (we're trying to cut down on our dairy). It was very very yummy!

This is really good, and would highly recommend. However I would like to clarify something. In the description of the recipe, boccancini is referred to as small, bite size pieces of mozzarella. While they are small and bite-sized, boccancini also implies that it is fresh mozzarella, as opposed to a dairy case Sargento-type of mozz, which is a lot harder and wouldn't blend well. Fresh mozz is much softer and melts much better than it's dairy case cousin. Find it in speciality cheese shops or the cheese island at your local supermarket. It's readily available, at least where I live.

sounds really good but it's not! Does not blend well together.

Thought the flavors in this dish were great. I would make a couple of adjustments though. First, I would saute the garlic in oil, as the 2 cloves of raw garlic overpowered the herbs. Also, I would add the cheese last b/c as it melted it got very clumpy. Otherwise, it's very tasty dish.

I've made this recipe twice, and love the deeply herbal bite and sheer greenness of it. It tastes much richer than one would expect. I highly recommend it!

This pasta was incredibly delicious. Surprisingly, it was very kid-friendly. It would be great when children would be a part of more up-scale entertaining.
