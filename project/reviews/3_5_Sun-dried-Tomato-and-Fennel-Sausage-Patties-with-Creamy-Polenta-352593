There is a section of the directions missing -- I guessed that after browning the patties, you then saute the onion, garlic and carrot in the leftover oils, then add the liquids. Rather than grind my own sausage meat, I used already ground sausage meat (unseasoned) and pureed the sun-dried tomatoes, water, garlic and basil in the food processor, then mixed that in to the meat with my hands. This definitely needed salt and pepper added at the end. I might salt and pepper the patties before browning them next time. Also, I increased the garlic and the basil, as we like things well seasoned. I used regular cornmeal for the polenta and it was good. However, Emeril Lagasse has a great white cheddar grits recipe that I might use instead of polenta next time. This dish was filling without being too heavy overall. I served it with a green salad and a crusty bread and a shredded parmesan, romano, asiago cheese blend on the table. It was a hit.

We've made this 4 times and have loved it! We use porl loin and do not add the extra fat. Made for a casual dinner with friends and was gobbled up.
