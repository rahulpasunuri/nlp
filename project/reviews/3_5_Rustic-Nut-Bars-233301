This is my 7th year making this recipe. Tips to pass along, be sure to splurge and use whole nuts, makes a big difference. And along the way I discovered Reynolds non-stick foil. I cover the pan with heavy duty foil first layer (no hassle cleaning) then second piece lay the non-stick foil the long way. I butter the non-stick foil. Tried last year skipping buttering on the non-stick foil, no sticking but buttering improved flavor. Removal was very easy. I also use brown sugar. Can make crust day ahead and then the nut part next day. Good make ahead, holds for a week in air- tight contaier, and freezes well. It is continually my most requested recipe.

I make several kinds of Christmas cookies as gifts each year, and almost univerally these nut bars are the favorite. Cleaning the hazelnuts used to be the most difficult and messy part of this recipe until I found the following technique from Rose Levy Beranbaum, who in turn credits Carl Sontheimer. For 1 cup of hazelnuts, bring 2 cups of water to a boil in a two quart saucepan. Add 2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons of baking soda and the nuts and boil them for 3 minutes. Be careful--this foams up quite a bit. The water will turn very dark. Rinse the nuts well under cold running water, then use your fingers to easily slip the skins off. After cleaning the hazelnuts, I toast them with the almonds at 350 degrees for 8 to 10 minutes, per the recipe.

Made for the first time. Had to add a tiny bit of ice water to get the desired result for the doubh. Made no other changes except that my daughter thought we should drizzle chocolate over them so I melted bittersweet chocolate (60%) in a double boiler and drizzled with a whisk over the nuts, placed in fridge for about fifteen minutes to harden. I used a long serrated knife to cut the bars without any problems. No nuts fell off. I did have a little trouble peeling the foil from spots where I didn't overlap the foil as neatly as I should. Even without the chocolate, this is a very decadent, sweet, cookie. Cut your pieces as small as possible. Would I make again? For me? No. For my nut-loving family, Yes.

These are the best nut bars I know. My husband raves over them. Had no problem at all with the crust. Will make every holiday season (and maybe more often!)

One of the most requested recipes I have ever made. Not the easiest thing in the world to make, but these cookies are absolutely delicious and everyone wants the recipe.

I found the crust too dry and cake-like, making it hard to cut and eat. I would think a shortbread would be a better base. The topping is excellent and attractive though very rich. Too much preparation time for the results.

Fell short of my expectations after reading the reviews. The crust was too dry and the nuts did not adhere as I had hoped-- many nuts came tumbling off as I cut the squares.

These are so good, and I agree, prettier than the photo. They freeze like a dream too-- if you can part with them and not eat them immediately. Very rich, very easy. If you have a Trader Joe's nearby, they have all the nuts you need, including the roasted ones. A true keeper.

These are not horrible, but they were much too sweet for me. If you don't normally eat rich carmels or brittle type sweetness, you may not like these.

I have not made these yet, but they sound delicious! I was just wondering: did you roast your pistachios and cashews prior to adding them to the topping (since the recipe calls for roasted cashews and roasted pistachios)?

I made these last Christmas on a recommendation from a friend. Wow! is all i can say. They are so much prettier than the picture, and so easy to make. The house smelled wonderful. I almost kept these all to myself but I really felt the need to share the wealth on this one.

Truly delicious, and so pretty. The green of the pistachios really adds to the appeal. Second year making them---nice to have a recipe where you don't have to get every hazelnut or pistachio skin off.

I agree with all of the reviewers that this was a fabulous recipe. I did substitute macadamia nuts for the hazelnuts and they were even richer tasting!

Beautiful. Simple, delicious, luxurious, buttery and decadent. I didn't substitute any of the nuts - they were all family favorites and worked so well. Thanks!

Beautiful and delicious. Unlike other nut bars, cut very well without crumbling, ie all the rectangles were neat looking. I could only find hazelnut pieces, and didn't bother to take skins off. What I wouldn't substitute is the pistachios: the green color is very decorative.

These were fantastic, the favorite cookie of our holiday season. We cut them into small squares and they were as attractive as they were delicious! Defintely a keeper!

These are absolutely gorgeous and delicious. I agree with one reviewer that the crust may have been a bit too dry--I may bake for less time next time. Also, peeling those hazlenuts is a labor of love! We cut these quite small and they were the hit of the season...their salty nuttiness pairs quite nicely with other sugary sweets.

These were to die for. I brought them to a party and they were a huge hit! I made the recipe just as it was written and wouldn't change a thing.

These are fantastic. They are easy to make and the result looks and tastes absolutely scrumptuous. I am tempted to make another batch before the holidays. This recipe will put away that holiday bowl of mixed nuts forever!!

I bake quite regularly, made two batches and followed the recipe to a T. I find the crust too dry to handle and will reduce the flour to 2 cups next time. I also think it's important to mention that the boiling process should be timed from the point the sugar mixture is at a RAPID boil otherwise the caramel is too gooey and the nuts will not stick together. Otherwise a great recipe for nut lovers.

My oh my, I cannot keep my hands out of the cookie jar, and these are rich! These bars will singularly be the cause of my holiday weight gain. Despite spending more than $13 on nuts, I will make these again and again.

These are wonderful!! Quite easy, impressive looking and taste divine. I used pistachios, pecans, almonds and cashews. They remind me of an extra special praline! Made for teachers gifts, but cannot wait to make again for New Years party!

This is the holiday cookie of the year. They are delicious and so pretty! I used pecans and walnuts instead of pistachios and hazelnuts and they are wonderful. I also used half honey and half corn syrup (was short on honey) and that worked fine, too.

Quick, easy and very, very good.

Excellent bars! Mine came out even prettier than the picture because the green pistachios are very bright. These can be cut very small because they are so rich. I will definitely make these again.

These just came out of my oven and if they taste as great as they smell I have a new favorite bar recipe.
