I love beets and I just started buying fresh beets to cook with this summer. I think this recipe is great for a quick salad. I left the tomatoes out because who needs them when you have beets?

Great salad. I love the sweet/sour aspect of this salad. I used a combination of red and golden beets. They were like candy. I didn't have mustard seeds or alspice so I used cumin, fennel and caraway seeds instead. I will definitely makes this again.

I left out the tomatos and served this over salad greens with fresh goat cheese. YUM!

Without tomatoes, similar to a dish my mother made...she came from the Galicia section of what was once Poland...now may be in the Ukraine!? We enjoyed!!

We love this as a pickled beet recipe, but find the tomatoes to be completely superfluous.

Beautiful and tasty and EZ to make. Next time, I would add more water to the pickling liquid. It was a little stout. A definite keeper.

This dish is impressive in appearance and flavor. Use home-grown beets if you can as they are much sweeter. I find it needs additional salt as it sits (i.e. salt generously, chill, then salt again before serving). I served it for a brunch in a beautiful white serving dish and added crumbled blue cheese to the top just before serving. It was beautiful and added just the right kick to the flavors.

This salad is delicious and beautiful. Flavor is amazing. I only used a half-pint of cherry tomatoes and I also added an additional tablespoon of water to the pickling liquid to tone down the vinegar. I accidentally bought allspice powder instead of whole allspice and 1/2 of what it called for and it was still delicious. A new summer favorite.

I thought the vinegar overpowered the entire receipe.

Yummy salad. Made it for a sunday brunch. The flavors are unusual and refreshing, and the salad is super-healthy too!
