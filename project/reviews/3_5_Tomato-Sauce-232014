I had a ton of cherry tomatoes from the garden and needed a quick and easy recipe that used up lots of them. This more than fit the bill. You end up with a thin marinara that you can use right away or enrich with other flavorings. We even made a meat sauce using this recipe as a base. Best of all-no peeling or seeding!

Added finely diced onions and used a green pepper instead of a hot pepper. Simple sauce but did the trick for pasta night - so tired of buying jarred tomato sauce.

I prepared this sauce to use on a pizza. Quite frankly, I never cease to amaze myself. I prepared the sauce according to the recipe, and I could'nt have been more pleased. Be sure to stir the sauce , and skim the froth, or it may be too bitter. I did some variations, because I generally add things to the mix that I feel I might like to eat. Good sauce
