Excellent. As many people mention, I'm not a fan of Brussels Sprouts but this recipe is outstanding. Prepared exactly as written -- did not add garlic or red pepper flakes as others mention, but there was no need to.

Wow, This was great! The whole family loved it, even my teen daughter. I'll definitely be making it again. While cooking the sprouts, I added the garlic and red pepper flakes others have recommended, and then some fresh lemon juice when I combined everything. Topped with fresh parm.

I love brussels sprouts any way I can get them and this is great. I agree the chili flakes and lemon make it, but I've also added chopped pancetta and garlic. Quick and easy.

I loved this! Like others, added red pepper flakes and lemon. Also threw in some sliced bella mushrooms after the pine nuts and before the sliced sprouts. YUM.

This was the first time I have ever cooked brussel sprouts, and it was delicious. I served it to two guys and they both had seconds and then thirds; one even suggested that I add more brussel sprouts next time! It will make a believer of all those skeptics out there. Adding a squeeze of lemon really rounded out the flavor. Allowing people to grate the parmesan themselves was also helpful.

Rating: 4
This is an easy and delicious weeknight dinner, and meatless too! (Using Trader Joe's toasted pine nuts makes it even faster.) For me trick is using fairly high heat for the brussels sprouts, so they get a little charred in places. I also add the squeeze of lemon recommended by a number of other reviewers.

Very nice combination of flavors. Thanks to the reviewers who suggested lemon and red pepper flakes. Simple and fast.

Rating: 4
OMG! How easy and great tasting is this recipe for so little effort! I had to go back for more just because I loved the flavors so much! This could be a stand alone side dish but we added grilled sliced chicken breasts on top to make it a main course. I followed the suggestions of sqeezing lemon over the top before serving followed by the cheese. Did not add the garlic as others suggested as I loved the flavors just the way they were. Wow!

So good, so healthy, so easy. Made as directed, but used wide egg noodles, as no fettuccini cut were available in my small town. added a squirt of lemon and a shake of red pepper flakes and parm to each plate as a final touch. very delicious & will make again and again.

It's nice that something this easy and quick can be so delicious. Pine nuts are getting pricey and are pretty hard to find sometimes, so I used pecans for their cost-effectiveness and was pleased. So cheap! So delicious! Will be making it again.

I love, LOVE this dish! It is delicious and so simple to make! It made me fall in love with brussels sprouts, which is not something I thought I would ever say! I would also like to note that they can be easily chopped if one does not have a food processor, I ended up quartering small sprouts and they were just fine. I also did not add the suggested cheese, but still found this dish to be flavorful and satisfying.

I made this last night and I have to say that it's pretty darn good, especially for something with such few ingredients, that can be prepared in less than 20 minutes. Going along with other recommendations, the only thing I did differently was I used a different type of pasta, specifically farfalle (I didn't have any fettuccine on hand). I also added one clove of garlic when I sautéed the brussels sprouts. I also topped it with freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Delish! It will be a keeper for me!

This meal is delish, although I made a lot of additions (butternut squash, garlic, grape tomatoes, garlic, etc.). I know that's annoying, but this recipe offers a great base to add to, and would be perfect on its own. For those of you asking about the cost of pine nuts, I bought the Kirkland brand at Costco for 1.5 pounds for $25. It's the only way to go.

My wife says she hates Brussels sprouts, but she really liked this. I followed several suggestions--lemon zest (and juice), garlic, sauteed mushrooms (in vegetable broth), crushed red chile pepper, and also added a few crumbled bacon pieces. Substituted Promise for butter. Really very good, and I think I'd do it the same next time. What's the deal with how expensive pine nuts are these days?

Rating: 4
This was a very tasty way to serve Brussels sprouts but there's one problem: Pine nuts at my local Whole Foods were $50/pound and now are not available at all. So, I toasted some pecan halves and used those instead. Also I used tagliatelle instead of fettuccine. I will use fettuccine next time.

I loved this recipe! Only a couple of modifications and it was wonderful. I sauteed some mushrooms in 1/2 cup of chicken broth and added it to the end instead of pasta water. I also added some crispy pancetta to the whole thing. Finished it off with juice from 1/2 of a lemon for a refreshing finish. YUMMO!!

This was SO good! I did make a few modifications based on the other reviews - I toasted the pine nuts and added them when ready to serve, and I added garlic and red pepper flakes. I also found it took far longer than 4 minutes for the brussels sprouts to be tender. But it was delicious.

Looking to eat more seasonally and healthily, I searched Epicurious for vegetarian and winter, and came across this recipe. I've always hated brussels sprouts, but reviews said it would change my mind... they were right! I made it per the recipe, but used a spinach/garlic fettuccine (yes, it was all very green). AMAZING. I'm a convert and will make again soon. Per others' recommendations I also squeezed a bit of lemon in at the end. Also, surprised at the comment of lightening up on the oil/butter. It's only 1 tbsp per serving, which is fine for health, and makes a huge difference in flavor. Remember, there's no meat so you're saving on cholesterol/fat there... enjoy!

Rating: 4
We were surprised at how good this recipe was-- we were licking our bowls clean. If you let the butter brown slightly while you saute the pine nuts you get a wonderful nutty/caramel flavor. I took the cue of a prior reviewer and added some lemon zest at the end, which lightens it up nicely; also we tossed with some strips of prosciutto at the end.

Rating: 4
This is surprisingly delicious. It is simple, quick, healthy comfort food and easy on the bank account! My changes: I make this with Gluten Free pasta (Tinkyada brown rice pasta),and slice the brussels sprouts in the food processor first. I also use salted butter and I toast the pine nuts prior to adding them to the dish. Good parmigiano-reggiano really kicks this up notch. This is in our regular rotation of weekday favorites.

What a simple and delicious dish! When I told my boyfriend what we were having, he uttered an unenthusiastic 'meh'. Once he tried it, though, he practically licked his plate clean. I used cast iron to brown my pine nuts and brussels sprouts, and added just a touch of fresh lemon zest and grated parmesan-reggiano at the end. Wow. I do think that this would work without the pasta, although it makes for an incredibly filling meal as is. You could probably also cut back a bit on the oil and butter and make it a touch more low-calorie, but really, it is very tasty and flavorful as is.

Rating: 0
I love this recipe. I like to toast the pine nuts beforehand, and then add them to the dish when tossing the pasta. When I add them in the beginning with the butter, they turn a dark brown. I also add crushed red pepper to the mix. I've tried this recipe with bacon, and with pancetta. i think the pancetta works a bit better - the bacon seemed a bit heavy and fatty at the end. And I love bacon, so... All in all, I prefer the recipe without the added bacon or pancetta. It certainly makes a good dish to pull out for my veggie friends. :)

Rating: 3
Very glad I made this! We would add garlic or onions next time, maybe a bit less butter. The times suggested are great. We chopped by hand - ordinary-size sprouts - chop the end of, pop off any leaves that come off at a touch (they are not fresh/crisp anymore), sliced each sprout into about 3 cross-wise slices. Fills you up!

I found this on someone's blog and it was just delicious! If you haven't tried Brussels sprouts this is one of the recipes I reccommend (either this or roasting them) I think roasted would be another thing to try added to pasta.

the brussels sprouts and almonds together were great, as expected, but the entire time i was eating this, i thought, i should have just made roasted brussels sprouts with almonds. why bother with the pasta, at least as it's done here. filler? this could be good if the pasta was actually sauced with something more interesting that 2 Tbsp of butter and a little cheese. i followed suggestions here by doubling the brussels sprouts and almonds, grating a little lemon zest, and using a smaller pasta, but still, the pasta wasn't worth the five-minute bother. in the future i'll maybe play around with the combination of pasta and brussels sprouts, because it has potential, but i will definitely never make this particular recipe again.

Doubled the recipe. Added 2 cloves garlic, minced. Wanted some meat, so added 1/2 lb. bacon, chopped, cooked crispy. Very good but I feel like it could be GREAT with a little more tweaking. Though I like the egginess and texture of the fettuccine, the shape of the pasta was difficult to eat with the other ingredients. It was almost impossible to get a bite with the correct ratio of pasta, sprouts, bacon. But I can't think right now of an egg pasta in a more appropriate shape. Will dry-roast my pine nuts separately next time, the butter and oil made them soft.

I love love love this. I'm trying not to make it too often so I don't get tired of it, but it is difficult not to overindulge as I love brussels sprouts and pine nuts. The combination is fantastic. At first it does taste simple, but with each forkful the flavors bloom and you find yourself eating faster! A few things: I use more sprouts and pine nuts than the recipe calls for and echo other's calls for the juice of one lemon, one minced clove of garlic, and a dash of white wine at the end. Careful to buy raw pine nuts rather than toasted. Toasted pine nuts will burn if sauteed as recipe calls for. Raw nuts are fine. If you buy toasted pine nuts by mistake (as I found out the hard way), just sautee them with the sprouts rather than before, and you should be fine.

Really enjoyed it. even the kids ate it.

So good! Since I first made this recipe, I've made it about once a week. A few things to note. The Pine Nuts are essential. The more the better. I tried making this without pine nuts, and it wasn't very good. If you are all out of pine nuts, try it with a couple drops white truffle oil -- that seemed to save the day for me. The recipe is about 100x better with the addition of a little lemon zest. If you don't have zest, add a little bit of lemon juice, but zest is better! Fettuccini is the wrong shape pasta for this recipe, I think. Any shape that's more compact seems to work better (orrichette, fusilli, shells, macaroni, etc). Double the brussel sprouts and this is a standalone weeknight meal, sure to please!

Rating: 4
What a great weeknight dinner. I went heavy on the sprouts and lighter on the pasta than the recipe recommends, and as a result, I thought mine looked better than the photo here! I was glad I used the half butter/half EVOO in the recipe (sometimes I prefer to just use all EVOO) because the light butter flavor on the sprouts and pine nuts was lovely. Will try the lemon with it next time. This is the second brussels sprouts-based dish that my husband will now eat (and not just eat, but enjoy and even rave about. Yahoo, because I love brussels sprouts)!

I took this recipe and ran with it - anything to get my Italian boyfriend to eat brussels sprouts (which I love). I saute diced gammon bacon and add the sliced sprouts which ssute nicely in the oil (add a little chicken stock if it's too dry - you can also use less oil to finish if you're concerned it will be dry). I finish wish slivered sun-dried tomatoes (drained), the toasted pine nuts and, of course, reggiano. Fabulous! Course ground pepper over at the end is a nice touch too!

Really good. I like having pasta without garlic for a change. I didn't have a food processor to slice the brussels sprouts so they were too thick. Next time I'll cut back on the salt a bit and add the sprouts at the same time I add the pine nuts, giving them a bit longer to cook.

Use canned roasted/salted almonds that I chop. Sometimes add garlic, but not necessary. Extra brussels sprouts (1lb). Really a great dish. If you don't add noodles, it's a great veg for chicken/duck/steak (although we definitely prefer washed, raw arugla under our steaks-YUMMY). Anyway, this is a great dish!

This recipe was incredible. It was very quick and easy... and the ingredients were minimal.

I'd definitely suggest going with whole wheat pasta. I didn't, but I could imagine that it would add something lovely. Also, don't skimp on the cheese you use!

quick, light and easy. i used whole grain angel hair instead of egg fettuccini and only 1/4 t salt. (1/2 t salt is WAY too much for this palate!) keep an eye on the nuts and keep them moving in the pan. you may think it's taking a bit for them to brown but it happens quickly once they get to temp!

This recipe is very good and extremely easy and quick to make. Pasta, brussel sprouts and pine nuts are all light in flavor so don't expect fireworks, but together in this recipe they blend quite nicely and delicately and I was surprised at how much I liked it. There was no bitterness whatsoever to the sprouts. I cooked them lightly so they were tender but not browned. The dominant flavor is the roasted pine nuts, which would have been a little too one-toned for me were it not for a heavy dose of parmigiano reggiano on top - not sure I would have liked it as much without that accompaniment. (I did not have the food processor blade the recipe called for, nor a mandoline so it was a bit of work to slice the sprouts by hand but it worked out just fine) It's not a recipe that will blow your mind, but it's certainly simple and satisfying.

This was easy and delicious. I made it with whole wheat spaghetti because that's what I had in the pantry and I thought the whole wheat pasta added some nuttiness to the dish.

I liked this recipe, but I don't feel that I made it as well as I could have. I used too much pasta compared to the veggies, and found that it would have been nice to have as much brussels sprout mass as pasta mass. It will look like A LOT of sprouts when they're prepped, but they cook down. A mandoline worked very well for slicing the sprouts. I used garlic per some reviewer's suggetions, but I found it to actually be rather overwhelming. I can see why people said that the dish was bland without it, but I actually though that it had a nice earthiness, and a subtlety of flavor. One thing--don't let the pine nuts take on too much color by themselves, because they will continue to cook with the sprouts. Also, I think that the amount of fat can be reuced while sauteeing, and then replaced in the form of olive oil drizzled over the pasta.

Have made this recipe several times. Very good as is. If I am feeling really decadent, I also toss the pasta with a couple of Tbsp of browned butter to add even more 'nutty flavor'. Adding lemon at the end is also another good variation.

Love, love, love this dish! Simple, elegant and so tastey. Have used both fresh and Dried pasta - both work equally well but give a different mouth feel to the end result. Fresh for winter warmth, dried for summer lightness.

A little broth, a squeeze of lime and you're ready to go for an encore.

This is quite good - even better with fresh lemon juice just before serving, to brighten the flavors. Substituting walnuts for pine nuts works well - and the addition of bacon (minus the cooking fat) is REALLY good. Slicing the brussels finely so you get a confetti effect is important. Fun recipe to play with....

Excellent flavor and couldn't be easier. This recipe instantly entered the regular rotation in our household. When my vegetarian girlfriend needs a quick, easy meal, we make this one. When my meat hungry roommate wants a quick meal, we make this and add pancetta or prosciutto cotto before cooking the sprouts. We've added other produce lying around in the fridge and it's impossible to mess this one up (leeks, squash). A little garlic gives it a better profile, but is not essential. Works well with penne or cheese ravioli as well.

This is a great weekday meal. My very finicky boys loved it...and I got them to eat a veggie they'd never ever try!

My new go to recipe when you want something quick and impressive. Only substitution made was in the type of pasta, used bowties. Had to make again the next night because it is so good.

We loved this recipe, my husband agrees that it is a keeper, the next time we make will add more brussel sprouts

WOW. This was truly delicious. Made as directed, except added a squeeze of lemon juice and a pinch of pepper flakes. It sounds weird, but this one's a keeper.

Healthy and quick. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. Added garlic and a 1/4 cup of white wine.

Saute 1/4 pound of chopped pancetta until crisp to really kick up the flavor. Good left over too.

Good nutty flavor.

I made this using 1 lg clove garlic minced, thin strips of pancetta and 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes. I cut the brussels sprouts in half, removed the core from each half (bitter) and sliced them very thinly. Sprouts were cooked a little less than the recipe. Dee- licious - would not have served 4 as my husband and I loved them so much.

This recipe is delicious as is. I loved the pine nuts and just a little cheese sprinkled on top. Everyone is suggesting additions but I love the simplicity of this recipe. Keep the sprouts nice and green and just cooked.

Good receipe...we took your advices and we added garlic, hot pepper flakes, lemon zest, chicken broth (otherwise too dry), more parmesan and topped with italian parsley!

The pasta was pretty dry with little flavor. Maybe try with some sauce or soft cheese.

Excellent and easy! Even my husband who doesn't like brussel sprouts likes it!

Okay, I have to jump on the bandwagon here. Add the pancetta and it is crazy good. Don't skimp on the parmesan at the end. I also agree with a previous reviewer, it is easy to eat too much...

As earlier suggested, I cooked some chopped bacon and added some red pepper flakes,then browned the pine nuts, etc. No need for salt or pepper. My husband and I both loved it! Will serve again soon.

Fabulous! Used imported egg pappardelle & thick sliced chopped cooked bacon. Don't cook sprouts too long.

Rating: 3
The flavors worked wonderfully with each other...I added some lemon zest which brightened the whole thing beautifully. My only suggestion for the next time I make this is I'll add pancetta or bggested by other reviewers and I will use a pound of sprouts. Really yumy!

This is outstanding. I followed the recipe exactly except used Trader Joe's sprouted wheat pappardelle pasta. Best pasta dish I've had in a long time!

I have made this twice in the past week. It is delicious and has finally convinced me that brussels sprouts are not horrific.

This is so tasty and easy to make! As a college student with not much money to spare I am always on the lookout for tasty cheap recipes and this is my new favorite...its embarrassing how many times I've already eaten it this week!

I made it as is and really loved it! Very easy, very tasty. I had the same idea as other reviewers: pancetta or bacon would work wonderfully with this! Very satisfying and yet simple!

This was a great dinner! Could have served in a restaurant! I added some sliced, sautéed, Pancetta to it to give add a little more protein. I also drizzled some of the pancetta grease from the pant to the brussel sprout mix. My husband and I ate the whole thing! It was supposed to serve 4, oops! Super easy to make!

I read the reviews and they were pretty much on par. So simple to make and has a great taste and equally as quick. Really enjoyed this one.

I chopped up a few slices of thick sliced bacon and cooked it until crisp and chewy (pancetta or prosciutto would probably be great, too), poured most of the greas, then added the pine nuts and brussels sprouts. It was a huge hit with kids and grownups alike.

I was afraid that the small amount of ingredients and seasonings would make this dish bland, but it was surprisingly flavorful! Really quick and easy to make, too.

Deceptively simple dish -- very tasty considering how little time it takes. DO NOT cook brussels sprouts til browned, however -- this is why they taste cabbage-y to some. Cook them only until they are bright green and barely tender -- they will taste fresh and even non-sprout eaters will like them. It looks like a lot of sprouts when you have them all sliced, but they cook down, so don't skimp.
