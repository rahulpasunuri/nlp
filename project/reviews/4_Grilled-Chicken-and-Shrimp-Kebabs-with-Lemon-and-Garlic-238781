While the chicken was OK, the shrimp were fantastic! I made then using small "appetizer" bamboo skewers, and it was perfect for a dinner - each guest could grab their our mini-kabob with 4 shrimp on it!

I made this for ages 5 on up, and everyone liked it. I was disappointed that I didn't have any leftovers! The key it to be attentive to your grill and do not overcook.

Easy preparation. The tasty marinade kept both the shrimp and the chicken moist and flavorful. I was feeding a number of hungry people and used chicken breasts cut into quarters rather than tenders. Make both the salsa and aioli: the aioli, in particular, was a nice change of pace.

My new Go To Recipe for shrimp. Perfect lemon to oil proportions and I would be liberal with the pepper in the salt to pepper to taste.

Simple to make, and enjoyable. Marinated chicken overnight, and it came out wonderful and juicy.

Very good! I made this for a summer grill out. Some comments thought the marinade was too bland which is why I gave it only 3 forks. But, most absolutely loved it. I did and I will make it again.

Wonderful! Very flavorful, especially after marinating for a while. Have used marinade with peeled shrimp, as well as lobster tails on the grill. This marinade would be great on anything.

Great dish that worked for the younger (picky) crowd - yet had enough flavor (via the dips) to please the adults.

easy and yummy! I love the aioli sauce with it and even my mayo hating husband likes it. Definitely one to add to the rotation and would be great for a party.

Use Wild Gulf Shrimp and not Tiger Prawns for beter falvor - or Alaskan Spot Prawns. Marinate for at least two hours... this is a pretty good fast meal.

Maybe it was my chicken, but I found this pretty blah. It was easy and ok, but not great.

I got rave reviews for this dish! I quadrupled the recipe and it fed a dinner party of 15 (mostly college boys!). I added veggies (sweet onions, red and green bell peppers, and cherry tomatoes) to the skewers; everything turned out great. I'll definitely make this again!

I had my doubts about this one at first, but decided to try it because I was in a bit of a time crunch. Wow! Simple and delicious! I made this for a small dinner party of adults (2) and children (3). Everyone loved it! My 9 year old, picky-eater son secretly ate the very few leftovers for his breakfast the next morning!! I made the salsa, not the chipotle aioli (not a fan of mayonnaise). Neither sauce was necessary as far as I am concerned. Amazing that such a simple marinade came out so well! I'm making it again today. My one comment would be to follow the suggestion of others and double the recipe because I think I would have run out of food if I were trying to feed 6 adults.

Pleasing to the eye and the pallete. As another reviewer recommends - the sauces are a must! The tomato salsa is good, and, the chipotle aioli outstanding!

Really good! Great advice from others cooking the chicken in advance and just finishing up quickly later. I added some lime rind to the shrimp and a little ginger. I served it with an orzo casserole. Everyone had seconds.

This is such a wonderful dish on a hot summer's night. I marinated the chicken and shrimp separately for 2 hours before placing them on the skewers which gave them exceptional flavor.

Very good. We especially liked the salsa and aioli, which really made the recipe. As far as I can tell, deveined, unpeeled shrimp don't exist, but it's easy enough to devein them yourself. Would make it again.

Delicious, quick and simple. Plus it uses ingredients I always have on hand - a bonus! I marinate in a bowl and then skewer the meat - I feel the marinade soaks in better that way.

I did just the chicken. Used less oil and marinated it for 2 hours. Grilled it untill half done, about 3 min a side, several hours before finishing it off on the grill. Easy, tender, great.

This was great! Loved the salsa, aioli, everything. Easy and tasty. I cut it in half for two people. Just right.

I give this 4 stars if you use the chipotle aioli and tomato avocado salsa as dipping sauces. Received raves at latest dinner party. The chipotle aioli should be made using canned adobo chilies for maximum flavor. Grilled the marinated chicken tenders several hours before the party, leaving them slightly undercooked and then re-heated them just prior to serving alongside the freshly grilled shrimp. Fabulous!

this was very good and easy to make. the sauces, i think, are necessary to the dish's success. we, too, rolled some of it up in tortilla. i will make it again. i don't think the tomato and arugula salad that they suggest went so well with this dish. a fresh black bean and corn type dish would be much better.

This is a wonderful easy and delicious recipe. I only cokked the shrimp 2 minutes per side which was perfect.

This is so easy and delicious for a quick company meal! Definitely double the recipe; the serving size is not enough for six adults.

This was really good - though I could taste the lemon marinade more on the shrimp than the chicken. Made the accompaniments to go along - and wrapped everything up burrito style in a whole wheat tortilla (just because I like to make sandwiches out of everything). Perfect combination.

Easy and delicious. I saved time by using grill pan instead of kabobs. Good flavor.
