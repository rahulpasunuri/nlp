I have made this for 4 years ...maple sugar is a favorite of mine & can be found in bulk at many natural food stores...& it is a key factor in this recipie - I skip the meringue as the crust is already sooo rich - a wonderful recipie -

I used granulated brown sugar instead of maple sugar and it worked well in this recipe. The crust was more high-maintenance than I'm used to making, but it also tasted and handled better than any crust I've ever made. I made the traditional cream of tartar/granulated sugar meringue and it complimented the pie well. Great for a change of pace for Thanksgiving dessert!

This is excellent. I could not find maple sugar, so I bought a good thick maple syrup and slowly boiled it down over a low flame, and then put it into a tupperware container overnight. Next day it was hard as basalt, but softened up just fine in the microwave.

this was sensational .. I crumbled some coarsely chopped pecans over the pastry before adding pumpkin filling, and also substituted maple syrup & brown sugar for maple sugar. Mine took 1 1/4 hours to set but worth the wait. I cut back on the sugar in the meringue somewhat, and added cream of tartar. Usually I leave meringue for 4-5 hours at 200 .. makes for a drier, crisper meringue .. and next time I will do that with this recipe. Added a few orange & black sprinkles for Canadian Thanksgiving - and this will become my annual Thanksgiving dessert. My fellow diners and I loved it!

Ummm...I sure hope that those who complained that the meringue was too sweet didn't put 4 cups of powdered sugar (12/3 as the recipie is written) as opposed to 1 and 2/3 cups of powdered sugar!!!! Haven't made it yet, but I am planning to do so this Thanksgiving. (Yeah, I'm trying to be an early bird!!) :)

I'm a big pumpkin pie fan & I really enjoyed this pie. I loved the maple addition, it gave the pie a beautifully deep flavor. The merengue topping was excellent.

This was the best! I made this pie on Thanksgiving, and everyone, including my husband who does not like pumpkin pie, and my gourmet frieds absolutely loved it. I did not have maple sugar, so I used maple syrup instead. This is definitely a keeper!!

I made two of these for Thanksgiving. They were delicious! The pumpkin recipe was one of the best I have ever tasted and the meringue gave it a nice little twist. I use frozen Pillsbury deep dish pie crusts which I think are the best to use if you don't want to make the pastry yourself.

My husband, who doesn't like meringue at all, liked the meringue while I was making it but on the pie, it was way too sweet. The crust was great and easy to make and rolled out beautifully.
