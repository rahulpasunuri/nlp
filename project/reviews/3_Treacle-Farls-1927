A note on the previous comment - Lyons brand makes Golden Syrup and Treacle -- they are *not* the same. Golden syrup is light, similar (but not the same) in taste to corn syrup in the US. Treacle is dark and slightly bitter, like molasses. They'd add extremely different flavors to these farls.

Definitely use real treacle instead of molasses - the treacle has a totally different flavor. I use Lyon's Golden Syrup which is what my British mother has always used for any of her treacle recipes. You can find golden syrup in most grocery stores and certainly any import store carries it.

I have used this recipe several times, and have really enjoyed the unusual taste, especially as a complement to other Irish or British breads and scones. I would make sure to watch the baking time, esp. over the last few minutes or it will be over-done. The dark molasses is a good substitute for treacle (which I have found in international food stores), but I would use the "real stuff" if you have it.
