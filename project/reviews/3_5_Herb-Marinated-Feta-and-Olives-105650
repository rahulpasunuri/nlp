So tasty and easy to prepare. It has to be done with good quality greek feta. I like to serve this on top of a half roasted pepper, or over tomato slices. Otherwise, no change to the recipe.

Absolutely amazing! I used very little olive oil and mixed green with kalamata olives. My family loved it!

Fabulous as an appetizer the first night of company...even better the second night: browned some chicken breasts, topped them with the olive mixture and baked until done. WOW!

This was a real treat! The flavors blend wonderfully and the slight saltiness is perfect. My guests raved about it. As an added bonus, I mixed the leftovers the next day with cooked penne for a delicious cold side dish. I will make this one again.

This was feta-nstic! I also cut down on the olive oil. Making it at least 1 day in advance definitely makes it better! I brought it to a party and everyone loved it!

This is delicious. I do agree with previous reviewers' comments about the amount of oil--do drain some of it off before serving.

Exceptional recipe with lots of intriguing flavors. However, I did make a few alterations: I halved the amount of oil...simply too much! I also added minced red onion and diced red bell peppers.

this dish is extremely tasty! its perfumed herb scent and diversified colors make it a fantastic dish for guests. I made it with less olive oil than the recipe about 3/4 cup so the guests could add more oil if they wanted to. If you like feta/olives/herbs this is a clear winner.

I've made this recipe many times for large events, people love it. I use a wide assortment of olives. I do drain off the oil right before serving.

Though some of my guests raved about this, I was less than thrilled. It is probably quite authentic, but wow... that's a lot of oil! I intend to drain the oil and use it for another dish, and crumble some of the cheese into yet other dishes...

This appetizer was a hit at a recent party we went to!. Everyone asked for the recipe. The combination of flavors was excellent with the slight bit of orange and cumin/corriander combination. I can't wait to make it again for my daughters christening. Best part it can be made ahead of time.

This is a love or hate recipe- my dinner guests were split down the middle. It is a little oily and you need excellent bread to mop up the oil. Keeps well.
