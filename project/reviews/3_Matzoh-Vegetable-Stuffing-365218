This dish turned out awful and I don't plan to make it again.

I tried this recipe recently and agree with the previous reviewer. After greasing the pan, I rinsed the matzoh and mixed it in with the other ingredients and baked all the ingredients together in one step. It tasted very good and the consistency was appropriate. I would emphasize rinsing the matzoh a good 30 seconds so it doesn't come out hard. I did continue baking the dish for 5 minutes without foil and found it to be just right. I am wondering if it might be advisable to lightly mix the matzoh with the egg and then add the other ingredients.

I am pretty sure that this recipe has an error. I am in the process of making it and there are TWO baking steps. But I believe that after you saute the mushrooms and veggies, you DON'T bake them, but mix them with the matzoh, parsley and egg and THEN bake. Why else would it say that you can assemble and NOT bake ahead of time. I will report back after I finish and let you all know
