I made this as one of the appetizers for a Southern style barbecue last weekend. The prep was straight forward and easy and a friend helping me assemble them at the last minute came up with the great idea of using the same cookie cutter that I had used on the cornbread to cut the same size rounds out of the ham slices. Our friends and family devoured them all and the dogs loved the ham scraps from cutting the rounds. The chutney is what makes this recipe exceptional. I did find that one batch of cornbread didn't make enough and I quickly made another one. I got about 20 rounds out of each batch. The trick with the cornbread is to make sure it is baked long enough so that it is slightly crispy and not soggy in the middle. The edges may look a little brown but they don't get used once you start cutting the rounds. Next time I might try another fun shaped cookie cutter; diamond, leaf, etc.

The presentation of this recipe is fantastic. However, the cornbread didn't turn out right. It wasn't sweet enough for some reason. Of all the appetizers I made (dates wrapped in bacon are amazing), this one was still there after the party.

We loved this one. Used Black Forest ham. You don't get a lot of rounds from this cornbread recipe -- may need to make 2 of them. I got 14 or so rounds. The chutney is fantastic! I used half cantaloupe, half honeydew. It tastes a lot like apple butter.

This is a terrific appetizer, very easy to make. I substituted mango for the melon, as we do not get great melons any time of year in my neck of the woods. The chutney has a wonderful sweet and sour taste, that goes well with the cornbread, mustard and ham.
