This recipe is spectacular- better than any tomatillo salsa I've ever eaten! I omitted the cilantro, and added several cloves of garlic, squeezing out the roasted paste before blending it all up. It was really good warm as well as refrigerated- will make a larger recipe the next time I make it, and freeze it.

once again, having one supplier in a country outside of the US seems to have an effect. to reach the amount i had to use some 30 small units cause that's all i could find. nothing a did took the bitterness out and it damages the effect of the overall flavor. anyone wanna make this in the US and email the jar to me? :)

Extremely easy to make. My first time cooking tomatillos! Don't know why I waited so long. My salsa came out on the sweet side. I may add 3 serrano chiles to heat it up a notch. Everyone gobbled it up! Delicious.

Loved how easy this was and how it made my house smell! I use two serano & two jalapeno peppers and that seems to kick it up a bit and I definitely also agree about adding some garlic to it. So good with the pork tacos or just chips!

Try it with roasted habaneros for very spicy taste the longer it sits the hotter it gets....

Yummy. I like hot salsa so, based on what others said about this being mild, I doubled the serrano chiles, and used all other ingredients exactly as specified. It was as hot as I like it and very good.

Excellent pork compliment! I substituted salt with garlic salt the second time I prepared this salsa and it was just as glorious.

this was very easy to make, and really yummy. It wasn't very hot, and I even used 3 chiles, I guess if you want it to be spicy you should leave some seeds in. Was a lot creamier than I expected.

It was really easy and super yummy. Next time I will add a jalapeno...it is a mild salsa but great flavor

I make this salsa or sauce all the time and freeze half. Use a whole onion and add 3-4 cloves of garlic and fresh ground pepper. This is wonderful blended with sour cream and served over avocados and tomatoes as a garnish!

Super easy and delicious. I use the Trader Joe's Salsa Verde, which makes this a cinch.

To the reviewer who'd like to can this...I am uncertain of the acid content of tomatillos so canning may be a bit risky if you don't use a pressure canner. Freezing would be a much safer option.

I have not tried this recipe, but has anyone tried canning this in jars? What do I need to do? Thanks

For a more authentic tomatillo salsa, dry roast the tomatillos, serranos, and some garlic (in peel) in a cast iron skillet on the stove until things have a nice amount of black on them (don't be scared of it!). Throw it in a blender w/ a little salt, and maybe add fresh chopped onion and cilantro to finish. Not QUITE as easy as this recipe, but much more delicious.

this was delicious! there will be less store bought salsa in my house from now on. i have wanted to cook with tomatillos for a long time and this recipe was fun and easy. do watch the roasting time - it only to 30 min for me on a metal sheet pan. i used 3 serrano chiles and had just enough heat.

Not spicy enough for my Mexican husband, but that didn't stop him from eating it. Easy to make.

Really good and really easy. I substituted jalepeno for serano as we don't like too spicy hear. Was really flavorful and worked great with the pork carnitas.
