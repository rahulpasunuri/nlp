Did not love this at all, I thought it really lacked flavor, very bland. There are way too many good recipes out there to waste your time on this...keep looking.

This was a popular dessert at a summer barbecue party. So nice because you make it ahead. There was just enough strawberry flavour. Very nice ending to a dinner.

I have never been more disappointed in a dessert. Horrible.

Really good and refreshing summer dessert. I used a 9-inch springform and didn't use all the filling.

This pie is a little too rich for me, but I am asked to make it for just about every gathering because my family loves it. I have substituted rum for the tequila when that is what I have on hand, and its equally tasty. I also sometimes use a pre-made graham cracker crust to save on time.

This was amazing!! I made it for a backyard barbeque where most of the guests were meeting for the first time. I served it in the kitchen, and there was more than enough for the eight or so guests. After everyone devoured their slice, the guests looked longingly at the pie remaining. So everyone went back for seconds! Great flavor, nice and tart, and pretty easy if you give yourself the time. I made it in a nine-inch springform pan as suggested at the bottom of the recipe. It made for a lovely presentation. Next time I would love to try a pretzel crust as one of the reviewers suggested, maybe with a little chocolate sauce?

Excellent pie! I made this for a pie contest at my work... AND I WON! This pie beat out lemon meringue, cherry, blueberry, and several cream pies. To add to the "appearance" I filled two margarita glasses - one with limes and one with strawberries - and sat them next to the pie. It tastes just like a frozen strawberry margarita.

Made this for a cookout and everyone RAVED! Deliciously light and flavorful. I was short on time and used a premade crust (sorry) but it turned out fine. I had extra filling even after mounding so I made kid sized ones too with crumbled graham crackers on top. I served with a little fresh whipped cream. Will definately make again, maybe for a girl's nite...

I have made this pie on two occasions. It has been a great hit both times. I prepared it in a pie pan and also in individual cheecake pans with outstanding results. Extra portions store well in the freezer. Have garnished the plate with lime slices and strawberries. All my guests have asked for the recipe.

I recently made this for a staff gathering at work and everyone loved it and asked for the recipe. One note regarding size of pie pan - I used a pre-made crumb crust by Keebler - the one that is 10 inches vs. 9 inches and it fit perfectly. Garnished it with beautiful strawberry halves and whipped cream -great presentation.

I made this a couple of weeks ago. Igive it a shoulder shrug for a rating. It was nothing special, but not bad either. I used a springform pan based on previous reviewers comments that pie pans were overflowing. This was just so-so, so I don't think I'll make again.

Have made this in past without the strawberries and used pretzels instead of graham crackers...YUM!!

This recipe was a disaster--did not come even close to fitting into my 9" 4 cup pie plate, was loose even with whipping the cream to firmer than recommended consistency, and is not setting up enough to mound the remainder of the filling on top in spite of being in the freezer...an absolute waste of ingredients.

This was very simple to prepare. I followed the recipe as printed but divided the ingredients among individual tart pans to create separate servings (remove for service). For presentation I drizzled each tart/plate with melted chocolate & added one attractive strawberry thinly sliced but left intact at the root end and gently spread open. While the pie looks as though it will be very rich it's actually light and refreshing. Be sure to let it thaw a bit before serving.

Too much effort for something that taste no different from frozen strawberry yoghurt in a pie crust. The liqueurs are not detectable. If you do plan to make it, don't beat the cream till it's too stiff or it will be impossible to fold into the strawberry mix. That happened to me so I had to whisk it in.

This was the perfect summer-time dessert, I served it after it only had 3.5 hours freezing time and it was at this most amazing soft consistency. Everyone at the party loved it.

I doubled strawberries and tequilla with mediocre results. It was kinda a waste of fresh berries. I'll try it again because it was soooo simple but might try the rum idea instead.

The first bite was a little questionable for my guests, but by the time they finished their serving... Now my friends request this for their birthdays! It's a refreshing change-of-pace dessert.

pretty good - delicious on a hot summer afternoon - would probably add a little more tequila next time as you couldn't really taste it because of the strawberries and lime.

Easy and nice light dessert. I made it in a springfrorm pan and froze overnight - the filling set up well as written.

I actually did Daquiri pie - I used Rum instead. Brought it to a party and everyone loved it. www.pietherapy.blogspot.com

Not nearly as good as the "regular" margarita pie.

Just got the pie in the freezer. Flavor is excellent, but there was too much filling for the 9" pan. Next time I make it, I'll use a spring form pan. We'll see how the guests like it!

I just made two of these pies for a work luncheon and they were a smash hit! I even had men telling me how great they were. The lime and lime zest really punches up the flavor of the filling. I made them 3 days ahead and they kept beautifully in the freezer. Used store bought graham cracker crust using the deeper dish version. Did an egg wash and brushed on the crust, baked for 5 mins at 375. It gave the crust a beautiful sheen and it keep it from getting soggy. A must try for any party especially a Mexican themed food party.

This pie was a delightful light dessert which I served at lunch. However the next time I make it I will increase the quantity of crumb base, because the filling was more than a 9' pie plate could take. Better made in a springform tin. I also think this would be excellent without the crumb base and set in a loaf tin, served in slices like ice cream and topped with fresh berries.

I made this exactly as directed and found that it did not set up very well, so the next time I made it, I added a bit of softened gelatin to the strawberry mixture and it held its shape much better. I also used a shortdough crust, much like a Linzer dough instead of the graham cracker crust, which I find has a much nicer flavor than graham crackers. I also garnished it with fresh limes and lime peel which I had soaked in Cointreau - great addition to the presentation.

Delicious and easy. I layered sliced strawberries in overlapping concentric circles then glazed with apricot preserves. Greated a very upscale presentation. My guests loved it, although one commented on how it tasted more like key lime pie but visually looked like strawberry. So, next time I may garnish with lime slices to help people "get it." High in calories, so next time I may cheat and use lower sugar condensed milk and perhaps light cool whip in place of the whipped cream. I know its almost sacreligious, but I love fitting into my bikini, as do my guests I am sure.

enjoyed this tremendously! Perfect for a summer grillout party - light and refreshing!

Excellent recipe. I forgot to remove it from the freezer as the recipe recommends so I left it on the counter for 5 minutes before slicing and it was fine. Cool and refreshing, perfect for summer.
