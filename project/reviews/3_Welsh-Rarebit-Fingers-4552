I thought there is nothing to top Marmite on Toast -- and my "rare" efforts at making this from an old Ceylon cook book were never particularly memorable. Made this today when I hunted down this recipe. Did not stick to everything the recipe said but the general idea of it and in combination with my memory of the Ceylon cook book recipe produced something miraculous. A walk back down memory lane. Amazing! A gem of a recipe marvellous in its simplicity - and now one of my top ten comfort foods! Will try it with the Lancashire cheese. I wonder if the brand of beer affects the taste though.

I agree on limiting the mustard, unless you are a mustard hound like me! I use a whole grained mustard, but limit it because of the bite it has. I also love using leftover artisan breads for this. I recommend that you use a hearty good bread and not like the puffy Wonder type bread. Using a good beer is a plus too. I like the creamy tartness of a dark ale or even a good stout. This is a rocking delicious meal using rye bread too. And, I usually add a few drops of worcestershire sauce in mine too.

Loved this! We served it late in the evening at our Annual Christmas party and all I heard the next day was how good the cheesy-beer-mustrad bread was!

On a side note, while delicious on its own, try this for a great change and a good use of "Turkey leftovers" Make the recipe as noted cover toast points with warmed turkey, two slices of bacon per point. and then broil....wow !!! Enjoy

This is a super appetizer recipe for picky eaters and kids minus at least half of the mustard and beer. I make it whenever there are little ones joining us for dinner. It makes them feel special to have their very own appetizer.

This is a pretty ordinary dish, but it's a super easy and satisfying comfort food. I, too, would use less mustard or a milder one; I'd also use a flavorful beer instead of the run-of-the-mill lager I had on hand this time.

My mother cooked this frequently for Saturday lunches when I was a child. She replaced the mustard with a mild curry and added chopped boiled eggs.

I thought that the mustard was overpowering. If I were to make it again, I would use less mustard. But, I don't think I'll be making it again. We were disappointed.

Make this quick dish often Suggestion: If you can get Tasty Lancashire Cheese (the one that burns on your tongue) you will never take Cheddar again. See dictionary for qualities but do choose "tasty" if you can get it.

This is a quick and easy recipe. Viewed, perhaps, as nothing more than glorified grilled cheese, the Dijon mustard, and preparation method gives this treat a lovely flavour. I've made it several times, always to great reception.
