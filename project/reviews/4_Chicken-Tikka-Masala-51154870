Very tasty. I made it for my Punjabi husband and he enjoyed it too. Although, he added more chilies to his bowl.

Very tasty! Loved the flavor. Used part evaporated milk and part whipping cream to decrease the fat content without sacrificing flavor. Followed the suggestion to grill the chicken--much easier than broiling. I highly, highly recommend this recipe!

Outstanding. Just be careful not to over cook the chicken in the over. It needs to be grilled at high enough heat to slightly char to outside whilst not fully cooking the centre.

Absolutely loved this dish. Made the sauce the day ahead and marinated the chicken overnight in the yoghurt. All I had to do was grill and cook the chicken the day of the party. Easy! Delicious with the onion naan and the cilantro- yogurt sauce.
