Huh. From a Hostess cookbook? Looks ike the obnoxious pop-ups aren't providing Epi with a wide enough revenue stream.

I'm ashamed to admit that I tried this..I let the kids try it and we all agreed that we would rather eat a twinkie alone...or just have a reg. milkshake...I can't believe that this is someone's favorite...it tastes like a grainy milkshake and thats all
