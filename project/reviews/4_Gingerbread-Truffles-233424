These truffles are definitely good as 2 forks indicate, but not superb. I followed the recipe to a tee, except I heeded the advice to rewarm the steeped cream in order to strain it. Two reasons why I am not rating this higher: 1)the gingerbread flavor was not that strong; 2)it was hard to form perfectly round balls and to coat the balls with chocolate without creating a puddle or "base" when placed on the parchment paper. Perhaps I should have doubled the spices as other reviewers have suggested. I do not feel these are "gift-worthy." However, despite the appearance, the truffles are still a good chocolate "fix" for the chocolate lovers of the world.

Fabulous recipe. Doubled all the spices and added powered ginger. Decided to temper the chocolate so that they would travel better (see instructions on this site.) Once I figured out the technique of working in small batches these turned out beautifully. Made three batches, one coated in white chocolate and the others in dark and milk. They look spectacular and taste even better. Was a bit of work, but definitely upped my cooking reputation.

This was my first time to make candy and I will note a couple of things about this recipe: 1) Do not try to do it all in one day and be careful about firming time needed for the base truffles. 2) I found that 12 ounces was too much chocolate for the coating and that the same holds true for the white chocolate volume. Straining the ginger mixture was easiest by using a small cup screen and mashing it with a spoon until all was left was pulp. Overall, I like this recipe a lot! It all looks very nice.

I made these for a holiday party at work and am already planning on making at least three batches for new years eve and a dinner party I am hosting the day afterwards. I wouldn't say that this is an extremely easy recipe - I'm used to just mixing together heavy cream, butter, and chocolate and letting it set - but it's totally worth the time and effort. I had to make this in one night (never doing that again) so I had to skimp on the refrigeration time. I did not reheat the cream before adding it to the chocolate, although I'm sure that would have made it easier to strain. I only chilled the cream and chocolate mixture for 3 hours which made it very easy to roll the chocolate into balls - it did get really messy towards the end and I had to stick the mixture in the freezer for a few minutes so I could roll out the rest. I also skipped the white chocolate and just dipped the truffles in melted semi-sweet. Everyone who tried these truffles raved about them. They were a huge hit and I can't wait to make them again in a few days.

I'd never made truffles before, but these turned out great. I did add extra cream--almost 1/4 cup--and mixed everything while warm; the filling set up very nicely. Easy to shape and not too sticky. Put in a little extra ginger as well, but they didn't need it. These are a huge hit and I will make them again without a doubt.

These are exceptionally tasty. I doubled the amount of allspice and cloves, used 1 tablespoon of fresh ginger, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, omitted the white chocolate final step, and topped them with bits of crystallized ginger.

If you can make or find crystalized ginger, these are yummy. In order to make life easier on myself, I melted the cholocate toppings in a ziplock, cut off the corner, then drizzled half the truffles with white chocolate the others with the bittersweet rather than trying to dip them. This was quick and so much less messy and looked nice too!

Though ultimately this recipe generated some tasty truffles, I wanted to share some notes. The first batch I made was a failure. I think partly due to a poor white chocolate choice, but also in part because the recipe does not instruct you to reheat the cream mixture after it's steeped for an hour. I believe this is essential! I reheated it until just starting to simmer. As noted by others, the ganache firms up to be ridiculously hard. I think this can be addressed by adding more cream, perhaps as much as 1/4 cup more. This will make the ganache much easier to scoop. Happy truffling!

I started making these every year for Christmas when the recipe was first printed. I always get rave reviews! I do not cover them with the chocolate but roll them in good quality cocoa powder- cuts out a bit of time and I use light corn syrup instead of molasses.

These truffles were everything I wanted them to be. Rich, delicious and impressive. It was a ton of work, but well worth it. When scooping the chocolate use the small jagged end of the melon scoop. It is much easier. And I left out the crystallized ginger, but add a bit more fresh ginger. It was perfect and not over powering at all.

Started making these this evening, but... Everyone who's said that the cream is really, really hard after being refrigerated, is really, really right. So hard, in fact, that as I was trying to scoop it out with my melon baller, I just about sliced off my index finger knuckle with the seemingly dull edge of the melon baller! Seriously, I'm having trouble typing this review because I have a it all bandaged up, in hopes that I'll be dexterous enough to complete the recipe in time for Christmas brunch in 36 hours. My advice: let the cream filling warm up a little (probably for about 30 min) before scooping. I was impatient and now I'm paying the price.. I've rated theses truffles 3 of 4 forks because what I've got at this early stage is delicious, and if the coating is as good as the cream; wow!

Ever since reading this recipe in the magazine, this has been a go-to for all our holiday gatherings. People start asking when I'll make them before Halloween. Go slow and take your time. Also, I bought a tiny cookie dough scoop and it works really, really well at making perfect little spheres.

Or try a Greek market, they use it a lot - it is called baHAria

If you can't find them in the supermarket, try an Asian or South Asian grocery. Or order online from Penzeys... good luck!

This recipe sounds tasty & interesting, but I am having trouble gathering the ingredients. Can someone please explain where to find whole allspice?

Great, easy recipe with serious "wow" factor. Refrigeration is the key to success- chilling overnight is key. Also, use the smaller end of the melon baller

These truffles were delicious, beautiful, and fairly easy. I did not alter the directions at all, and couldn't have been happier with the results. Very impressive.

These are delicious. I have made them twice now. The second time I did not use the crystalized ginger, and they were loved by all. Without the crystallized ginger they are more smooth and subtle. I also used a better quality, darker higher percent cocoa (60%)--( I wish I could find a better quality white, but few regular stores carry it). I reccommend doing the whole process over 2 days, take your time, lots of fridge (and freezer) time between steps.

I made these as part of a Holiday Gift Basket for friends, and they received rave reviews from both foodies, non-foodies and even the children! Forming teh perfect truffle ball was next to impossible, but I allowed the ganache to chill overnight, scooped the ganache out with a melon baller and formed the balls from there. The heat of my hands required that I take a break every now and then and let the ganache chill more in the fridge before proceeding. They are definitely time consuming, but you can put them together in stages. Well worth the effort if you have the time and inclination. Best quality chocolate and crystallized ginger is a must.

These were a hit at our holiday party last year. No one could believe that we made them as they were so good. Although, they were hard to form in to pretty balls.

I had high hopes after reading this recipe and the previous comments about it. I would not make them again because I found the crystallized ginger overpowered the truffle both in gingery spiciness and in sweetness (since its coated in sugar). It may have been enough to have just the fresh ginger that was steeped in cream. I also found it tedious waiting for all the cooling times. Lastly, although the melon scoop worked to scoop out the hard chocolate, I needed to roll them quite a bit to achieve the photo. All in all I was dissapointed. Good luck everybody.

The gingerbread spices in these truffles are delicious! I, too, had trouble forming them into nice-looking balls with the melon scoop. It was my first time making truffles, so I'm chalking it up to inexperience.

i loved this recipe but had a question for others - did you find it hard to scoop the chocolate out with the melon baller to form the trufflfes? my chocolate was very hard. suggestions? also, fyi, i dipped some in coconut. de-lish!

I made these as Holiday gifts and everyone LOVED them. After coating the truffles in chocolate, I dusted them in gold luster dust and placed them in a nice box. Nobody even realized they were homemade until we told them. A wonderful recipe.

I, as "Bon- Appetite" suggested, gave these truffles as gifts (along with the CARAMEL-DARK CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES WITH FLEUR DE SEL) and everyone LOVED them. I was pleasantly suprised when I found that they actually tasted like gingerbread. These will definitely become a holiday staple in my house.

I loved these! Everyone who tried these love these. I have always loved recipes that pair chocolate with cinammon and spices and this recipe really makes the most of both flavors. I skipped the crystalized ginger in the recipe and instead garnished each truffle with a small piece of candied ginger. I got more compliments on these than anything I have made in a long time.

I made these truffles for a craft-fair at work. Not only were they easy (though time-consuming, with all the waiting for things to cool), but they looked fantastic. After the fair, I received several comments and even phone calls from people who had bought them, they thought the truffles were that good! I just made them again as treats for my co-workers, and used zante currants instead of crystalized ginger ... it's a really nice substitution. Next time I'll add some pecans or almonds. Also, when you strain the cream/spice mixture into the chocolate, make sure to smash as much of it as you can against the strainer, don't just stop with what naturally comes through. It's so very thick and dense that it needs some coaxing through that strainer. Enjoy!
