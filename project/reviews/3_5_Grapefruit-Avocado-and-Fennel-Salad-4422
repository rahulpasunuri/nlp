For me, the whole salad was just context for the grapefruit. You take a bite of grapefruit and woah! Never tasted like that before. Just a beautiful idea. Thanks!

I loved the dressing!

Enjoyed! Substitued oranges for Grapefruit since my hussband takes statins. I served with spinach instead of arugula. Nice winter salad.

Terrific! Couldn't find arugula so I served it over a bed of baby greens. Worked great, wouldn't change a thing, went great with marinated, seared Ahi.

So refreshing! We loved the flavors and the textures. Dressing is also great on regular, every day salad.

Wonderful recipe with a refreshing mix of flavors. Like the reviewer from Toronto, the textures of each individual ingredient really added to this salad. I will try this next with arugula. The only minor change that I made was the use of a tarragon mustard in the dressing, which made it excellent!

I only wanted enough for 2 people, but I made the entire dressing recipe and used it to marinate chicken and also some shrimp. It was really great as a marinade! Also Shrimp on the salad itself was great

Loved this! Fresh and light without any sacrifice of taste. Mix of textures with crisp fennel (which I normally don't even like because of the anise quality), juicy citrus fruit and velvety avocado was excellent. I served this with grilled shrimp and scallop, and also put the arugula (rocket to those in the UK) on the bottom so the lovely colours of the salad weren't hidden.

I'm usually in agreement with majority of reviews on this site, but for some reason, this salad just didn't do it for us. It wasn't bad, just not the standout I was hoping for.

Great dish. I served it for Thanksgiving brunch. I added sea scallops to top the salad. Was a big crowd pleaser.

We just made this for Thanksgiving 2005. It was really a hit with the adventurous eaters -- of course some folks just won't touch the "non-traditional." The salad was a much-needed reprive from the heavier foods. The crunch of the fennel and tartness of dressing was perfect. I wouldn't change a thing!

This is such a great salad. I use some of the dressing to marinade skewered scallops for about 15-20 minutes and then grilled. The flavors of the scallops and the grapefruit are a great combination. I did not use arugula but mixed spring greens instead. Also you can buy fresh grapefuit sections already prepped in some supermarkets and that saves alot of time.

I made this for thanksgiving since we needed a fresh something to lighten the meal. It was a huge hit especially with my Grandfather and Aunt. Those looking for a new fresh option will love this.

I made this salad for Thanksgiving 2000. It was a huge hit and everyone wanted the recipe. Thus, I'm now on the hit list to bring to every party where I'm the designated "bringer of the salad"

Pretty and yummy, although I was the only one at our dinner party of 3 who really gobbled it up. Taking those grapefruit segments out of the membranes is also pretty tedious.

Served this at a dinner party & everyone enjoyed it. The dressing was great. I used mixed greens, as I couldn't find arugula.

Certainly a pretty salad--used it for a brunch but substituted a spring mix for the fennel, since that's a flavor that people either love or hate. Didn't use all the dressing, though it was yummy. Sprinkled the top with toasted walnuts and omitted the arugula just because my grocery store was out.
