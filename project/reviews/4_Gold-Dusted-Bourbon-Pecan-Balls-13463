I mixed the 2T cocoa in with the 3/4 C sifted confect. sugar and used light corn syrup instead of honey...this brought me back to my Christmases in KY...they are soooo good!

Mostly followed the recipe, except I substituted dark corn syrup for the honey, left out the gold powder, and threw in 1 and 1/3 cup pecans. I let the mixture firm up overnight in the fridge before forming into balls and rolling in extra dark cocoa. Left in the fridge until the party, then pulled them out. People raved. Very nice for a KY derby party!

Well, more bourbon sounded like a good idea, but made the dough too sticky. I had to add in enough additional cookie crumbs and powdered sugar that I really ended up just doubling the recipe. I'll try a different recipe next time, though I'm sure these will disappear. Smells like a distillery in here!

Yummy and simple to make. I did not come close to 4 1/2 dozen, more like 2 but perhaps I made extra large ones.

These little balls of happiness are just divine. I passed on the gold powder and ground the cookies in the food processor. I also found that 1 box of Nila Wafers was the appropriate amount for the desired consistency (a bit more than called for). The royal rum balls on this site are delish as well.

I haven't tried this recipe yet; I was looking for one from a long time ago which used finely crumbled gingersnap cookies instead of vanilla wafers (much better that I recall). Also, the old recipe required dropping spoonsful of the mixture on cookie sheets, freezing for 15 minutes, THEN forming into balls, then rolling in cocoa. FABULOUS if I recall correctly!

Our family recipe calls for refrigerating the formed balls, then dipping them in melted chocolate. And more (much more) bourbon.

Great Holiday gift-giving treat. I made no changes to the recipe, just eliminated the gold.

I followed the instructions of the cook from Houston, Tx exactly. Best recipe on the site. Don't skip the extra bourbon!

Excellent recipe. Easy, always gets rave reviews. Finding the Gold Dust powder is a problem, so substitute colored sugar crystals.

Quick and easy. I substituted chocolate cookie crumbs and rum. Yum

I knocked this recipe out quickly. These delectable little balls are the answer for holiday grazing. Keep them in the fridge-Open the door, pop one into your mouth and viola! craving extinguished. It doesn't hurt having a few shots of the remaining bourbon for pure baking pleasure while making my inlaws more tolerable. Perfect for a drunk who likes a good snack.

I have made bourbon balls for years-My children are adults now and ask for it each christmas holiday. I make mine with condensed milk, the vanilla wafers, lots of pecans and 1/2 cup bourbon. Roll into quarter size balls, then roll in powered sugar and chill. Keeps ups to weeks in the refrig. Great for mailing. This is so easy a dummy could do it.-I know I am one.

My daughter called me for this recipe to make with her children, I originally made this 30 years ago with original Gourmet -also used light corn syrup, increased the bourbon & sometimes used rum. I don't know how folks fell now about alchol & using it with & for cchildren--thats is an indiviual decision & other substitutes may/can be found like coffee?

rEALLY GREAT! I MAKE THIS WITH LEFT OVER COOKIE CRUMBS, MAKING THEM CHOCOLATE ONE TIME, THEN OATMEAL OR VANILLA THE NEXT. AN EXCELLENT WAY TO USE LEFT OVER COOKIES...

I added a little cocoa to the actual cookies and they were wonderful! Could have done without the cocoa dusting. Just like grandma used to make.

This has room for improvement. I add raisins (soaked in the bourbon), use walnuts instead of pecans, and corn syrup instead of honey. That seems to get them to hold together better. Also, a touch of powdered instant coffee (or very finely ground beans) in the cocoa mixture adds a nice bitter touch.

I found them to be oddly dry (considering the 'dough' was initially quite wet) and mealy. Perhaps upping the nut to crumb ratio would help, as would adding some corn syrup. The biggest disappointment was the gold dust; I actually had some and used it...to absolutely no effect!
