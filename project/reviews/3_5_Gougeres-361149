They are delicious but simple. They would do better on a platter of various appetizers than alone.

5 eggs is definitely too many. The taste is good (you cannot go wrong there) but the dough is a tad too runny so they tend to be on the flat side (unless you make tiny ones). Also as another reviewer said they need to be baked till they are deep golden/brown to retain the shape.

Boohoo! Mine did not turn out. They were pretty much flat discs and did not have much of a taste! Damn, there goes a waste of my range free farmer's market eggs. The directions on getting the dough just right in the sauce pan were really not specific enough. I thought I had "dry" dough, but maybe not. I enjoyed the writing and the article though.

I made these with 1 less egg and just 1 cup of cheese and they turned out nicely. My French relatives told me that gougeres really need about 1/4 tsp of ground nutmeg, and it is true. It makes them delicious. I baked mine in well greased muffin tins to ensure they hold their shape and look better on a serving tray.

These are truly perfect to have around for a cocktail party or a long evening.....new years?... because they're delicious cold and warm. I like the slight blandness of the Gougeres in this recipe. They have a certain sophistication which combines well with wine, champagne or cocktails. But..... if they're too bland, then give them an italian flair with a handful of pecorino and a good sprinkle of cayenne. Still, I'm not sure that strong flavors are always better... though i'm going against my own natural preference here. The French (original) version should not be underrated!

I just put mine in the freezer to get solid so I can serve for Xmas Eve. Mine were SO sticky I could barely get them onto the baking sheet. Did I not get enough of the moisture out of the dough before adding the egggs?

I thought these were really good. I made them as an appetizer last Thanksgiving and they were absolutely gobbled up. I'm going to make them again this year with the addition of crab. Should be delicious.

These were't bad, but they were boring and bland. Not worth it. Won't make again.

While tasty, I found these way too eggy....more akin to a puffed crepe. The directions were wonderful though and they came out beautifully. I would make them again, but perhaps 3 eggs and the addition of some cayenne or some other spice for a little something extra.

After they are completely done and out of the oven I always stick the tip of a sharp knife in the top to let out the steam and they won't get soggy and collapse.

This is a perfectly good, standard recipe for gougeres. It is important to make sure that the gougeres are thoroughly baked or they will deflate. I usually take one out of the oven and test it before I take the entire pan out. They must be very well browned before they will retain their shape.

This recipe is terrible. I've made gougeres before (in France no less) and had them turn out perfectly. These came out of the oven looking like flat blinis. They did not rise at all and are not tasty.

My gougeres just came out of the oven, and taste great, however they too deflated immediatley. I did make larger portions - slightly smaller than dinner roll sized. Does anyone have any tips to keep them puffed?

To the cook in India - No need for baking powder or yeast. The eggs do the puffing. These are wonderful and easy to make and store.

Can someone please tell me if this recipe needs baking powder/yeast or not? I'm wondering how it would rise otherwise. Thanks.

Check out this chart from Pie In The Sky for altitude adjustment...it might help the ABQ cook http://www.highaltitudebaking.com/adj_recipes.htm

Wondering if your altitude had anything to do with the deflating? I want to try these, but want to allow for our 6300' elevation.

I loved how easy this recipe was! I split the batter in half, adding a Gruyere/Cheddar mixture to one half, and Roquefort and walnuts to the other half. I used a small ice-cream scoop to portion out the dough, and that worked beautifully. I was a bit disappointed that the gougeres deflated quite shortly after coming out of the oven, but both sets were delicious.
