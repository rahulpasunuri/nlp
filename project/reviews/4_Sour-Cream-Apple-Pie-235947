I used my standard crust recipe, and a mixture of 7 different apples. Otherwise, I made the recipe as is, and served it at Thanksgiving dinner. Yum!! This pie was heavenly, especially the next day when it was served cold. I actually liked it better the second day, so will plan to make it a day ahead next year. That will also help as there are always too many things to fit in the oven on Thanksgiving day!

Delicious! Everyone said we MUST have it every year at Thanksgiving. I guess it's not in the rotation. I used local apples.

Delicious. Used store-bought crust and variety of apples. Seven apples was a little much. Added cinnamon and a little nutmeg to filling. Recipe makes too much topping. Great right after baking. Can't wait to try tomorrow as several reviewers mentioned it's even better next day.

Fantastic ! I made this pie to take to a Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit. I messed up and put the topping on the pie before baking it first but it turned out ok. I just covered it with foil during the last 20 minutes of baking to avoid burning the topping. I will make this again and again.

I LOVE this pie. Made it on Saturday for the first pie. Friends lucky enough to have partaken are begging me to make them one of their own. Serve it chilled for optimum results.

i can't say this is _the best_ pie recipe ever, but it did go over well at thanksgiving this year (it and the 9 other pies we ended up with!) it seemed to bake strangely - like it took forEVER, and the filling still looks a bit curdled even though it wasn't; just not the most lovely pie on the inside. most people liked the tartness and that it was unique.

Slap my mama this is a great recipe. Definitely worth it to use cider in the crust. It is a beautiful pie (the slice looks like stained glass with the apples in the sour cream custard) and holds together very well. The flavor is remarkable. Hard to believe a home cook can make something so impressive and delicious.

This was absolutely fantastic. A great twist on the classic. I used a 9 inch springform pan and 7 apples and everything fit perfectly.

I used 7 Granny Smith Apples in the filling, and it was still a little too much, but my pie pan isn't a deep-dish. I tried to flute the crust up high, but it fell over during cooking and overflowed some. Other than that it was great. Love the flavor and love the crust. I caught my sister-in-law take a piece of the crust that fell off and eat it plain, so I'd say it's a hit.

This was an AMAZING twist on apple pie. I subbed creme fraiche for the sour cream, and used half Braeburn and half Granny Smith apples but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It got rave reviews at Thanksgiving and several people said it was the best pie they have ever had. As several other reviewers suggested, I made a day before serving. Delicious!

This was delicious!!! I used a store-bought frozen crust and it still turned out fabulously. The topping really adds a lot to the pie and balances the sour cream out. I did add 1 tsp cinnamon to the sour cream mixture and felt that the extra spice worked well with the topping. Better after setting up for a while. Served warm with vanilla ice cream.

This pie is absolutely wonderful. It's the best apple pie I've ever had. I used a store bought deep dish pie crust. Like the other reviewers, I found that six apples was plent. I used granny smith b/c that's what I had on hand. I also added the 1 teaspoon of cinnamon that was supposed to go into the crust into the sour cream mixture. I don't think I'll ever make a different apple pie - this was so wonderful. My husband and kids devoured it.

3.5 forks. Wonderful. I made a few variations, based on what I had on hand, my limitations as a baker, and other reviews: I used a frozen prefab pie crust (I'm not so good with the hand-made crusts), and I used 6 Granny Smith apples, which still produced enough filling to overflow and necessitate that I bake the pie on a sheet. Also, per another reviewer, I added some extra spices I had on hand to the crumb topping---nutmeg, mace, ginger, etc. Not imperative, but a nice touch. I bungled the baking temp, not noticing for quite some time that I was supposed to reduce the temp after the first ten minutes of baking. Though some of the apples' edges were dark brown by the time I corrected things, the pie was none the worse for wear. The pie was just lovely after it came out of the oven and cooled. Absolutely worth it. But the next day the leftovers were even better; it's true. And a slice of this pie is just a gorgeous photo op. The crumb topping makes this a very sweet pie, which I like, so people who don't have such a sweet tooth probably could cut back on the filling sugar significantly and still create a thing of beauty.

This pie is amazing! Rave reviews from everybody, even non-pie people. I made a few ajustments though: added lemon juice and lemon zest, ground ginger, lots of cinnamon and some nutmeg. Tastes even better the next day!

Phenomenal!! Plan ahead to make the day prior to serving. It had a unique and just okay flavor a few hours after baking. The next day it was positively heavenly!

I used a frozen crust from Whole Foods to save time. Also substituted chopped slivered almonds for teh walnuts. This pie tasted *almost good* a few hours after I made it, but *FABULOUS* the following day. A great make-ahead recipe.

This was simple to make and had a wonderful custard like texture. It had a slight tang of sour cream, but it mellowed nicely. Served it with a caramel drizzle. Took it to a school bake sale where it was sold by the slice and had a ton of recipe requests.

A very tasty pie, but too sweet! I'd cut down on the sugar next time, in both the filling and the topping, but especially in the topping.

I, too, made this pie several times in 1981, and after moving, never found the recipe again. It's always been a pie I talked about when remembering great hits! I'm SO happy to see it again & can't wait to serve it up at the next gathering. A beautiful step above the old traditional version of apple pie!

This was a hit. I like the other reviewer had this in the early 80's and made it a few times but then forgot about it. When I saw it this week I couldn't wait to make it again and was not disappointed. The guests loved it and my family loved it the next. day

I've been searching for a copy of this recipe for years. My high school boyfriend's mom had a subscription to Bon Appetit, and she served this one year at a dinner party. I admit I haven't made it yet, but if you've remembered it for 27 years, it must be pretty good. I'm going to try it for Thanksgiving.

amazing. I used mexican crema instead of sour cream to give it a slightly richer, nuttier flavor. This is my next entry into my friends' pie contests.

A hit at a recent dinner party. I ended up using a store-bought pie dough and brushing a little apple cider on it, but otherwise followed the recipe. Delicious!

Followed the recipe exactly and found the crust heavy (poor handling on my part?) and the filling runny (let the pie sit for five hours prior to serving so that's not the problem). Not sure what I did wrong. Tasty filling though.

This is one of the best apple pies I have ever made. Delicious! Made it on two separate occasions this week for company and both times it was a hit. Used two different kinds of apples and definitely did not need 8. I used a pre-made pie crust, which worked great.

Given the fourth of July celebrations last week, I thought an apple pie would be a nice treat for my American hubby. Now, he does like Irish style tarts (we don't do deep dish pies really) but I thought this recipe looked like a nice twist on a classic pie. I upped the amount of cinnamon, but that was the only change I made. Because this pie bakes in stages, make sure you have enough time to bake it...it's definitely not a throw it in and forget about it pie. That said, hubby devoured it, loved the kitsch factor of apple pie on fourth of July and has nominated it into his top two favorite recipes ever! Yep, of course the downside is that right now I have two more of the pies in the oven - one for home and one for his workmates. I heart this recipe!

a big hit at the potluck! Absolutely delicious!

This was the most amazing apple pie I've ever eaten. I used a combo of mcintosh, gala, granny smith. I cut them all the same size and, because of the different textures of each type of apple, some were still crisp, others more cooked, making each bite a bit different. There was a lot of topping, but it was so delicious that it could be a dessert in itself. Apple cider in the crust was great too.

This was good - but not great - I gave it a good b/c i did not follow the recipe exactly - the sour cream made an interesting texture and i would try it again - but it was not an instant winner

Wonderful apple pie. I used Gala and Crispins and the combination created lots of flavour and firm apple texture. Also used more than the 8 called for. Thought there was too much topping so will reduce in the future. Fortunately for me our guests didn't show and I ate this pie all week. It was just as good a couple of days later as the day it was made.
