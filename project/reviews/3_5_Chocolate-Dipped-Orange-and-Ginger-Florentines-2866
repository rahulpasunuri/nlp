These are wonderful! The difficulties cited by others who have reviewed this recipe are caused by underbaking. Give the foil a good spritz of pan spray - easier and more even than butter, and won't affect the flavor. Bake until the edges are a nice, deep amber, as if you're making caramel. Once you've got them out of the oven, slide the foil onto a flat surface and use a round cutter of your desired size and press down firmly WITHOUT ROTATING to score each cookie. Resist the temptation to muck around with them too much, and just let them cool on the foil. Once they're cool, if you've baked them long enough, they'll practically jump off the foil, and you can use your fingers to break off the edges very neatly along your score line, yeilding nice, round cookies. You'll have a little pile of florentine trimmings left over. These are delicious crumbled over ice cream, or equally good covertly shovelled directly into your mouth as a reward for all the work you've invested in the process... I prefer to spread the back of each cookie with a thin coat of tempered chocolate rather than dipping half, so you get chocolate in every bite.

I have made this recipe a couple of times now and it continues to be a hit. My husband has just requested a batch to take to work. I substituted hazelnuts for the almonds. Chopped dried cherries taste delicious with the hazelnuts. I don't find them at all hard to make or work with and like the idea one reviewer had of rolling them into tubes. The messy part is the chocolate dipping, but what a great excuse to lick your fingers!

I baked these cookies for 8 minutes, as instructed. They looked and felt exactly the same as when I put them in. I baked them for 2 more minutes. Same result. I cooled them and attempted to take them off the foil. They stuck tenaciously to the foil and refused to let go, also somehow falling apart in the process. At this point, I read the description of the recipe: "chewy, candylike". This is NOT my idea of a florentine cookie. They should be crisp and thin and buttery. These cookies did not spread at all, and remained thick and soft. I am now looking for a better recipe!

Don't be scared by the other reviews! These aren't for beginners, but for any semi-experienced cook they are not hard, and they are delicious and beautiful. I used cooking spray instead of butter, following one of the other reviewers, and it worked out very well.

WOW! This is wonderful! I pour them into large teflon rings (2 at a time) on a buttered baking sheet. I then hold the rings down until the bottom of the cookie is set and won't spread anymore. Before they cool I wrap around a cannoli form and slip off to cool to room temp. VARIATIOPON: After all the cookies are made, I fill with a hazelnut and cream cheese fondant and line them up for dipping in chocolate. Using Shokinag 71% bittersweet chocolate, I dip first one end on every cookie; let it dry on a rack, then dip the other end. Dip only two inches up from ends. These freeze very well, the "cigar" shape is perfect for the fondant filling and they are perfect for high tea or along with a cup of espresso following dinner. NOTE: I don't use a recipe for my fondant I just play around with hazelnut cream, cream cheese, powdered sugar, hazelnut extract and sometimes with minced hazelnuts. If I use the hazelnuts, I don't use the ginger and orange.

This was a lot of work and time. While they did taste good, after spending so much time getting them right I couldn't stand to look at them anymore.

These were hard. They were very thin and hard to peel off the foil. I think they were easier to peel if they were cooked long enough, so don't undercook. Mine turned into a mess, so I piled all the pieces together and poured the chocolate on top, and made squares. Still tasted great!

I have made these cookies for a few years now and today when I searched for my holiday recipies, much to my horror (and especially my husbands!) that recipe was missing. You can imagine how happy I was to log on to this site and find it quickly! Thank you so much.

These are really wonderful florentines. The ginger and orange are perfect. Thanks to Sean for the suggestions. Here are a couple more: I make small (half dollar size) cookies which are a pain in the neck (but well worth it). To shape them before they harden, I keep them on the open oven door. Probably bad for the oven, but since in my kitchen this is counter height, I am able to shape them while keeping them reasonably warm. I use a non-stick spatula rather than a cookie cutter, and just nudge them into a circle. They aren't perfect, but they are good enough. And the batter refrigerates beautifully if you want to break the process down into smaller steps (it's also a bit easier to work with when it's cold and not runny). Also, if the cookies are hard to remove from the foil, be sure they are thoroughly cooked (they stay sticky if they haven't started to brown) and that they are completely cool. Then they should peel right off.

This is the best recipe for florentine's I've ever found. I didn't bother to make my own candied oranges though.

I feel for the cook from Milwaukee. These cookies are a challenge, but the reward is oh so worth it! I've been making them since 1990 when I used to subscribe to Bon Apetit so here are my suggestions: First, you only need two good sized navel oranges, one for zest and one for the candy strips. Second, spray the foil with nonstick spray before dropping the cookies. Third, make only four cookies at a time as you have to reshape them while hot and you might not have enough time to work with more than four cookies. Finally, add some melted shortening to the melted chocolate if you think the chocolate for dipping is too thick and then let the cookies cool (uncovered) in the refrigerator. These cookies are labor intensive, but always impressive. My mother just asked me if I made them for Christmas again this year and she was very pleased when I said yes.

These cookies are a bit sticky after baking; in order to solve this dilemma I stuck them in the freezer for 10 minutes and then peeled them off of the aluminum foil. They freeze well too - up to a month.

This recipe turned into a disaster for me. The cookies did not harden enough and they were impossible to remove from the foil. They were unsalvageable.
