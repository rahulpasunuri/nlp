Wow, great combination. The only change is that I used 2 kiwis. Make sure to do BOTH the salsa and the curry mayo.

Another great version of 'how to get in your fruits and vegetables without even trying'. I just took stuff out of my fridge that were 'salsa-y'; everything on the ingredients list minus the kiwi, plus radishes, cilantro and cut up grape tomatoes. Chopped, diced and mixed it all up and it turned out really great. I used chopped up, cooked chicken I always have in my freezer and a whole wheat/flax seed tortilla. The curry aioli was great. Pair it with Lays Classic potato chips and an ice cold soda and you've got winner!

Though one person liked this, I found it an odd and unpleasant combination of flavors. I would not make it again, nor would I eat it if someone else made it!

I love trying new recipes especially if the ingredients don't jive with my flavor combo expectation. I had saved this recipe to try, and went to work. When I came back, to my suprise, the husband had actually put this together! He too was fascinated and obviously didn't notice the "healthy" side note on it. It was a fabulously refreshing change from our usual choices. Spicy and sweet work well together with fragrant curry. We decided to roll these up in some health nut wraps for easier handling though...great recipe!

Just learning to make healthy things and this one is by far the best. Very easy to make, Used walla walla sweet onions instead of red onions, I diced the blueberrys into 4ths so it was easier to wrap. Added some spicy smoked cheddar cheese, also used flatbread wraps instead of just the lettuce.

These were great! I made for a party because I wanted something light and healthy but still out of the ordinary. The only thing I changed was using green onion to tie the roll-up together. They do taste healthy, but are a nice change on the appetizer table!

These were fantastic. I made them for myself and my fireman boyfriend, who has a healthy appetite. I added whole wheat tortillas to wrap them and used red leaf instead of butter lettuce. I also added some cilantro to the mix. After dinner he asked me to stay the night with him, he was that impressed. Very easy to make and so delicious.

This salsa is incredible--I actually recommend not chopping the blueberries like some other blueberry salsa recipes recommend because it will make your mixture a bit watery. The first time I made this (for a picnic) I substituted spinach for the butter lettuce and it worked well, but making the wraps was a bit time consuming. I ended up taking along a package of deli turkey my boyfriend and I used like injera bread to eat the salsa and it was delicious! He just asked me to make an enormous batch of it (modified, see below) for him to take to Burning Man. Burning Man Blueberry Salsa: For a healthier alternative, you can make the salsa itself and sprinkle on the curry powder to taste. It still goes great with deli turkey and no mayo means you don't have to worry about it spoiling quickly (or additional calories).

This blueberry salsa is amazing!!! As is the curried mayo. Great little roll-ups, light and refreshing.
