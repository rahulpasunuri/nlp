A light and tasty dessert. Increased the measurement of the five spice, after sampling, to 1/2 teaspoon. It needed a bit more zing.

I adhered to the recipe completely and I didn't care for the grape compote, but I think that was just a matter of personal taste. The pistachio crisps and the mascarpone spread were quite nice and I will probably make them again, to combine with something else. Chopped dates, maybe?

Wow - a fabulous finish, especially if your guests are not big 'heavy' dessert fans. I love that it could all be made the day before. I didn't have the grape juice concentrate, so added 5 tablespoons of white wine instead which was great. The crispness of the pistachio biscuits and the zing from the 5-spice was perfect with the mascarpone cheese. A definite keeper!!! My husband is a very 'choosy' dessert eater, and he raved about this recipe.

This is a "hands down" elegant, flavorful and beautiful dessert. My opinion is that many desserts are too sweet or predictable. If your sweet tooth is raging, this may not be your pick of the week. When a dessert has balance, as this one does, it deserves recognition. I have made it a few times and received compliments from fellow foodies. It shows and tastes extremely well.

Overall, this was good, but not GREAT! I thought this was more work than what the finished product resulted in...esp. the crisps. I would like to try this recipe again perhaps with Peaches and almonds and Amaretto!

I also made the complete dinner that this was part of and it was hands-down a perfect end to the wine pairing dinner.

A show stopper. Guest licked their plates. A lovely presentation. Very easy to make and great flavor. Only one suggestion-remember to buy a few clusters of grapes a darker color for garnish or they blend in with the compote.

This is a sophisticated dessert that looks much more complicated than it is to make. The recipe got rave reviews from my new years party. I put the marscapone and grape compote in separate bowls and let the guests build their own desserts. My husband and I were happy there were some left overs for the next day. Yummy.

I did the complete menu that this desert was a part of. Every dish was wonderful, the desert will definitely be one of my staples for a sophisticated dinner party. My guests loved it, and of course it was one of those "what is in this dish- fabulous"

What a great dessert! It's actually fun to make, can be prepared in advance and, best of all, it's elegant and delicious. My guests raved!
