My first quiche ever and it came out fantastically well. This was incredibly fast and easy. I used 10oz of fresh spinach, chopped up. I used cheddar cheese and parmasean. Put the cheddar on the bottom and mixed the parma with the eggs. Rave reviews at Easter brunch!

Delicious and not too rich- healthy for a quiche. I made the following changes: added 10 oz. crimini mushrooms to the sauteed veggies (after the onions but before the spinach); used 5 eggs; used 1/2 t. pepper and 1/4 t. nutmeg and omitted dill. I used a shredded cheese blend in place of the cheeses and put some on the bottom of the crust, some after the spinach layer, and some on top.

I loved this recipe, so easy and so tasty. I made my own shell and like many others commented; used 5 eggs. I also threw in some goat cheese and added 1/2 the Parmesan to the egg mixture rather than putting it all at the bottom. Will definitely be making this one again.

Good flavors and easy week-night dinner! I made my own crust; I also used fresh spinach that I chopped before adding to the sauteed onion. That was great -- no liquid to deal with. I also switched out the cheese to a jalapeno cheddar. Used a 10-inch tart pan with removable bottom, so it set up a little faster than 50 minutes.

It's true, men will eat this quiche! I served this for my husband who is a meat lover, and he loved it! I agree with all the changes made to this recipe. I added 5 eggs, 1 small red pepper (diced), and mixed all the ingredients together before putting it in the (deep dish) pie shell. Enjoy!

I have made this recipe countless times with various ingredient variations and it always turns out beautifully. I like to add cheddar cheese instead of monterey jack because it adds some much needed color and gives the quiche a little pop. I would recommend this recipe to anyone in need of a quick, easy, and light dinner. It also goes over well with kids because what kid doesn't like pie shaped food?

Everyone loved this quiche. I added 5 eggs instead of 4 as suggested in previous reviews. I used a 9" deep dish pie crust to fit the amount of filling. I added 1 teaspoon chopped fresh red pepper and sauteed with the onions, which adds some nice color against the green spinach, especially for the holidays. I mixed all of the ingredients together instead of layering them and the end result was beautiful and delicious. Baking 50 minutes at 375 was perfect.

My Go-to Generic Quiche recipe from now on. We are awaiting Hurricane Irene right now and going out for ingredients is not an option. I was looking for a different quiche recipe as my other one tends to be a little rich with the cream and softer cheeses. No spinach so cooked some turkey bacon and a small can of mushrooms. Used shredded colby/monterey jack cheese. Added 1/2 cup (a little more maybe, we love cheese) to bottom, then crumbled bacon and mushroom mixture followed with eggs/cottage cheese/rest of cheese folded in and spices. I used 5 eggs and Lactaid brand cottage cheese. Excellant and not as rich. Will use as a basic recipe and substitute.

This was the first quiche I have ever made, and it was delicious! I added a 1/2 cup of low moisture mozzarella and cut the parmasean down to 1/4 cup. I think this recipe would work with any number of cheeses! I love this recipe! Great intro to quiche making

This recipe is fantastic. Not too eggy, but still holds together well. The second time I made this, I substituted Phyllo pastry (5 layers) for the pie crust. I didn't have any cottage cheese on hand, so I crumbled goat cheese on the bottom with the other cheeses, and added an extra egg on top. These substitutions turned out wonderfully. I would definitely recommend this!

I made this for vegetarian friends and everyone loved it! I did add one extra egg as some suggested. I also used the mushroom filing and spices (with Swiss vs fontina) from the Mushroom and Fontina Cheese Quiche recipe (also on this site) with the eggs and low fat cottage cheese mixture here vs the heavy cream in that recipe and it was delicious as well. This is not as soft or eggy as some of the other recipes I have tried but my husband, who is not a huge quiche fan raved- asked how hard it was to make, which is a sure sign he wants me to add it to my weekly rotation!

This is my go to quiche recipe. I prebake the crust for about 10 minutes and use 8 eggs instead of the recommended 4 because I use an 8" deep dish pie plate. I've also made it with liquid egg whites in place of some of the eggs. Sauteeing a little red bell pepper with the onions give a nice color and flavor to the quiche as well

Really is easy and delicious. I have a recipe I've always used that has more ingredients and is more complicated and this tastes just as good. I also used 5 eggs, which was perfect and I just mixed the ingredients instead of layering them. For "garnish" I sliced a tomato thinly and put the slices on top while the quiche is cooking. Ideally you would put a bread crumb/parmesan topping at the end that would bake into a very thin crust but I wasn't motivated to do that. My guests loved it.

This was my first time making quiche and it turned out great. I followed some of the other suggestions and added an additional egg, baked it for only 40 minutes, and mixed the spinach w/the rest of the ingredients instead of layering. I topped it with a light layer of grated cheese and dusted the crust w/parmesan prior to adding the egg mixture. Would definitely make again, great consistency!

Delicious! I substituted the Monterey Jack with grated swiss instead. Also, it was ready in about 42 minutes, instead of the 50 like it says. The best spinach quiche I have ever had. It is not as eggy as a lot of quiches but seems to have more substance.

This became one of my favorite recipes last summer when we had a bumper crop of spinach. I like using Marie Calandar pie crusts, pre-bake them 5 minutes, and then part way through it's baking time I cover the edges with foil to keep them from browning too much. Have added and subbed many ingedients - ricotta for the cottage cheese and sliced mushrooms have become our norm. But if you REALLY want to wow your family or guests, flake some smoked sockeye salmon in it. Turns an already elegant meal into a showstopper! Made several last summer for neighbors and company, and already have requests for more when this year's garden gives up it's spinach.

I made changes to using what I had on hand one "meal emergency" night. I used 1/2 of an onion, 1 cup of grated Emmentaler, and used 1/2 cup sour cream instead of cottage cheese. I upped it to 5 eggs. Turned out great. If you have teen boys you might need to make one a piece for them!

Good. The dill, nutmeg, and cottage cheese gave the filling a spanakopita-like taste. Mine had a little too much onion. I would recommend using a small onion and dicing it versus chopping it.

This is my first quiche. I made a few changes to the recipe and it came out pretty tasty. I used cheddar and swiss, which I had on hand. I added some garlic and took out the dill. I also baked it right in the store bought pans, and the crust was a little soggy. Other than that I'm happy with the results.

Rating: 4
I gave this 4 forks because it tastes good and was simple to make. I will take others advice next time and add an additional egg and maybe stir the ingredients together instead of layering them. This was essentially a layer of cheese, spinach and onion, and egg on top. The flavors came together well, but if you really want an egg dish, I would add an extra one. Four eggs isn't much. Having said that, I went back for seconds and will be making it again!

Great quick recipe. Use fresh spinach and add some mushrooms to the onion mix. Sautee the spinach for 1 minute until slightly wilted. To prevent the crush from getting soggy mix 1 tsp flour with 3 Tbsp of parmesan and sprinkle over each side of the crust. Definitely pre-bake the crust for 5 minutes.

Rating: 4
For a more classic French flavor, I substituted shallots for the onion, grated gruyere for the shredded cheeses, and heavy cream for the cottage cheese. I eliminated the dill weed. Made one day ahead, stored in refrigerator, and served at room temperature to allow the flavors meld better. My guests raved about it and were surprised at the simplicity of preparation. I recommend this recipe highly as it also lends itself well as a foundation for other flavor combinations.

I thought this was good and easy, perfect for the church potluck (yes they still exist!). I bought two frozen crusts and thawed them a bit before putting down the cheese. I didn't consider it salty, but may add next time two more eggs (I doubled the recipe). It was a bit dry, but the flavor was great! Oh, I added a bit more onion, too.

This is a great dinner party main course, especially for the vegetarian crowd. Nice presentation and quick to prep, it's easy on the hostess. I used smoked alder sea salt and added a 1/4 cup of fresh shaved parmesan to the egg mixture to add a little oomph to the flavors. My oven may run a bit warm, but I recommend checking at 40 minutes, and again at 45.

Easy, delicious and light. I also used fresh spinach and baked the crust for 5 min before adding the filling, both good suggestions. Mine was done after 40 minutes, but my oven runs hot. A good recipe for using up whatever ingredients are in your fridge - I added leftover roasted garlic and tomatoes.

This was a bit too salty as written, I think, with the parmesan cheese AND the other salty cheeses--we used conte and cheddar. I'd add less parmesan next time. Maybe we just used too many cheeses but we just had a tiny amount of each. LOVED the cottage cheese. What a great idea.

this is a good recipe for healthy quiche. i omitted nutmeg b/c i don't like it, used a bag of fresh spinach, used fresh dill b/c i like fresh ingredients, and used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese b/c i don't care for cottage cheese. i also used 2 eggs and substituted the other 2 eggs w/egg beaters. i followed some of the tips given by the other reviewers-baking the pie for 5 minutes before adding the filling and mixing the whole mixture together instead of layering. it tasted delicious, the bottom of the pie wasn't soggy. the only thing i'd recommend is to use less salt and i only ended up baking it for about 30 minutes instead of 50. this is a quiche that tastes good and also tastes light. if you're looking for a rich tasting quiche this isn't it, but if you're looking for a healthier quiche and a lighter tasting one this is it.

Maybe not the classic that Julia would have made but a great "speedy" version that works. Like many others before me I substituted with the cheeses I had on hand Tête de Moine(similar to a gruyere or good swiss)and feta to make the cup of grated cheese and low fat ricotta. Omitted the dill(seems like it would fight with the nutmeg and my husband only likes this flavor in pickles)It was also great as leftovers (room temp or slightly rewarmed in oven or microwave).

VERY good, considering my expectations. I sauteed the entire 10oz of frozen chopped spinach with a vidalia onion and mushrooms. Grated a mixture of asiago and romano, aged hard cheddar, and colby cheeses equalling one cup, maybe a little more. sprinkled a fourth of the cheeses onto the crust and mixed the rest into the egg/ricotta mixture. Left out the dill... used nutmeg, and added a generous amount of herbes de provence (not sure exactly what's in that jar). Baked it for 30-35 minutes, and it was perfect. could have possibly used a little more of the egg mixture, as it was a very thin layer, but flavoring was just right. Next time, I would possibly increase the egg mixture, or maybe add milk to it. Otherwise, highly recommend!!

I followed others hints and used ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I made 2 quiches, on as the recipe and one with peameal bacon and mushrooms instead of spinach. Didn't precook the crust and baking for 40 minutes in my oven was just right. Everyone loved them.

Very good! Based on other people's comments about it being a bit too egg-y and thick, I used 3 eggs, 1 egg white, 1/2 cup scalded milk along with the 1/2 cup of cottage cheese. I also mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering, and I used Asiago and Gruyere. Definitely bake the crust alone before adding the ingredients, as I did not do this, and the bottom crust was undercooked and a little doughy.

This quiche really is simple. I substituted ricotta cheese for cottage cheese because that's what I had in the fridge. I left out the Parmesan and used colby jack. I made it a day ahead of time for a cocktail party and served it at room temp and it still tasted great. Cheap, good and easy!

Very good. I layered it as the recipe called for---with cheeses on the bottom, but I also added some of both of the cheeses on the top as well. Mine was done in about 30 minutes, not 50 minutes.

Unfortunatey, I used a 9 in. deep-dish pie shell. (Instructions weren't clear on depth of shell. ) Followed the rest of recipe except used 2 cups of Monterey Jack instead of adding the Cottage Cheese. Baked at indicated tempurature, but it came out VERy dry. I'll try 40 minutes bake time if I make it again. I would increase the custard ingredients X2. Didn't like the cheese-at-the-bottom idea. YUCK! My sister always mixed ALL ingredients together then poured them into the shell. This one was not light and fluffy and homogenous at all. It seemed to call for too much spinach (I used 10 oz. frozen chopped spinach). If I'd used a regular crust, there would have been FAR too much spinach. This quiche wasn't appetizing nor fit to serve to others.

This is a delicious and easy to prepare dish/meal. I took the advice from another reviewer from France and substituted ricotta cheese versus the cottage cheese and used a blender to mix the eggs with the cheese. I also used 1 cup of egg substitute versus the 4 whole eggs the recipe lists. To enhance the flavor of the quiche and also to utilize this as a breakfast recipe, I sauteed 4 ounces of chopped lean ham in olive oil, then added chopped shallots versus the onion listed in the recipe, then added the spinach. I layered the cheeses, putting Monterey Jack on the bottom of the crust, and added the Parmesan on the spinach/ham/shallot mixture. This is my family's favorite "special" breakfast meal. This recipe is a keeper!

I wonder what Alton Brown would think, but here's my two cents on incorporating the cheese vs. layering it on the bottom: I read the reviews and thought it would be a good idea to prebake the crust, but I ran short on time and decided, "To heck with it," and layered it on the bottom per instructions. The crust ended up nice and crisp. My theory is that the cheese melts first (aided by the heat from the warm - and non-soggy - filling on top) and creates a moisture barrier, therefore ensuring browning and crisping of the crust. I think this explains the "speedy" part of the recipe - this method eliminates the need to prebake the crust.

Given that I'm not really a fan of either cottage cheese or spinach, I love this recipe. I made my own crust (Easy Pie Crust -- which is not all that easy, but wonderful). I found that I needed to make a bit more custard for the quiche (I tripled the recipe so it was quite dramatic) but I probably ended up needed at least 1 or 2 additional eggs/more cottage cheese per quiche. I omitted the dill, but loved the nutmeg in the background. Great!

This was very versatile. I made it as a crustless quiche (sprayed an 8" square pan with PAM) and got raves. It's better with at least one extra egg (or eggbeaters) and more cottage or ricotta cheese. Basically, you can't ruin it. Don't overbake.

Rating: 1
There are so many easy recipes for spinach quiche...that actually taste good. This one however, is not really that easy and tastes like nothing special. The problem is that instead of mixing the ingredients all together, like most quiches, this recipe instructs you to layer the ingredients in the pie pan resulting in a flavorless layered pie. Quiche should be creamy with a hint of onion flavor. The nutmeg in the top is too overpowering. Overall, this recipe is a loser.

Rating: 3
Delicious and quick if you use a pre-made crust. This *is* lighter than a traditional quiche and I liked using part-skim ricotta better than cottage cheese. Next time I might add just a little milk to the egg/cheese mixture - the top of this was just a touch too eggy for my taste.

Rating: 3
This was my first quiche, and it was so much better than I thought it would be. It tasted great and was filling without being so rich that you couldn't go back for more. I actually prefer it to heavier 'real' quiche. I made my own crust from another quiche recipe on this site (I don't remember which) instead of going out and buying one, and it came out perfectly. It did take more time than I thought, but it also got my boyfriend to eat his spinach with a happy smile.Now that it's getting colder, I'll be sure to make it more often.

Followed recipe as-is, came out great. Best advice from reviews was to plan on making two- the piecrusts I bought come in pairs anyway! Unsure about the cheese on the bottom vs. cheese throughout debate. Kind of nice to have all the strong cheese flavor close to the crust- will try the other way today.

This really deserves more than 3 forks, maybe 3 and a half. It was very good and very easy to make: my only beef is that I wouldn't call this speedy quiche. The only thing speedy about it is that it calls for pre-made crust. Nothing else about the recipe is extraordinarily quick. I liked the cheese on the bottom: it wasn't too much as in many quiche recipes (though I guess it depends upon your own tastes.) This is one of the better quiche fillings I've ever made and I will use this recipe again.

I have adapted this recipe in many different ways. I've used mushrooms, onions, zucchini and peppers in varying degrees and have always had wonderful results. This recipe is a great base & fool proof. Just add whatever veggies & spices you want, sticking to the cheese, cottage cheese and egg base. Just ask my neighbor, Michelle! She's a self-acclaimed non-cook and she calls this one of her best recipes since we cooked it together on a beautiful Sunday morning! Mangia!

I followed the advice of a couple other reviews when I made this: slightly precook the crust, mix all the filling ingredients together before filling the crust.

This quiche was delicious and easy. I followed the recipe exactly except I added pre-cooked chopped bacon. It only took 30 minutes to cook the quiche though. Also, I precooked the crust for about 7 minutes so it wouldn't come out doughy in the middle. I will definetly make this quiche again.

my husband loved it and it got favorable reviews at a recent brunch, but i wasn't in love with it. my crust on the bottom never crisped, and honestly, i think i would like to try a creamier (albeit, fattening), richer quiche. i didn't really taste the cheese even though i used good quality and probably even added a little more than the receipe called for.

I try to keep my cooking fairly healthy, therefore I made a few changes to this recipe and it turned out wonderful. I made a crust out of shredded sweet potato and zucchini, 2 egg whites, 1 minced garlic and salt & pepper(bake at 450 about 10 minutes). Instead of 4 eggs, I used 2 whole eggs and 3 egg whites. I used olive oil in place of butter. I also used all natural swiss and romano cheeses and omitted the monterey and parmesan. I brought it to a lady's meeting at church--It was a huge success.

I made this dish for a picnic before going to a play. I was very disappointed in it. I followed the recipe, added chopped ham for additional flavor. It was like a brick.

I threw away the recipe in case I forgot how awful it is.

I've made far more complicated quiche recipes before, but this one turned out amazingly good, despite the lack of cream, homemade crust and it was so easy to throw together. I really liked the addition of cottage cheese too (I used the 1% lowfat kind.) I thought this recipe was great and in fact, was making it primarily for a 3.5 and 5 year old. They absolutely loved it ad did I. I used about a cup of swiss instead of the other cheeses and mixed it through the cheese and spinach mixture instead. I found that the cooking time was off on the recipe and mine was set and firm in about 35 minutes and I did put foil around the edges of the piecrust so they wouldn't get too dark. This will become one of our staple recipes for sure.

I replaced 1/4 of the spinach with fine chopped bok choy. Added a few chopped water chestnuts, 2 tablespoons chopped celery, 2 tablespoons chopped mushrooms and 1 teaspoon soy sauce to eggs. Use a mild white cheese. Delicate but very tasty at the same time.

This was the first quiche I had ever made, although I frequently cook. I tried to make this a bit healthier by substituting eggbeaters for the eggs and also added several of my own items. I sauteed minced garlic & fresh sliced mushrooms with the onion (I used 1/2 of a small vidalia). I also added about 6 oz additional spinach & some chopped (canned) red peppers. I used italian seasoning instead of dill, omited the salt & used some cheddar instead of the jack cheese. Good thing I used a deep pie crust or all of this wouldn't have fit into the quiche. The overall flavor was good, but I would have prefered the cheese to be all through the quiche - seemed to not work well with the shredded cheese on the bottom. Next time I will mix it throughout, probably with the spinach mixture..........or possibly layer the spinach & the cheeses. Mine also was a bit too firm on the top - maybe I will cover it with foil next time during part of the cooking. Otherwise, great recipe. Will definately try it again.

Really easy and very good. Co-workers gave me thumbs up on the recipe. I cheated and used a frozen pie crust. I also added chopped ham and decided to use a blend of herbs instead of the dill. Will make again considering ease and few ingredients.

Rating: 3
Very good. I may have added a little too much spinach, the texture was very firm, but the flavor was very good. I also added diced cooked bacon and a small can of mushrooms. I don't think the dill added anything, I'll omit it the next time and see if there is a difference.

It's not exactly beyond compare but it's great for what it is. It is easy and fast....practically failsafe...If you want interesting, unusual taste...experiment. Try adding roasted red peppers from a jar and use a puff pastry crust on top instead of bottom. FabULus.

Very good! I'm making these for the second time today. I make them crustless, by baking in muffin top tins. Great for folks on the Atkins diet plan. Just darned good with or without a crust.

This is fabulous! A friend of mine also adds 5-6 pieces of bacon as well. It's wonderful the next day too!

I used a 9 1/2" torte pan instead, so the eggs mixture had to be increased to double the size. I also used fresh spinach (10 oz. package), fresh dill weed, a couple of diced mushrooms (Added with the onions) and four slices of bacon (cooked ahead of time and laid cris cross under the egg layer). It was awesome, my guests loved it for brunch.

Good, but not too intersting. I am in search of a tasty spinach quiche; this one was a bit bland.

Very easy and a definite crowd pleaser!

I also used fresh spinach (about 15 ounces)sauteed in a very light amount of garlic. It is a wonderful, light dish. Made it New Year's Day served with Bloody Mary's! I like the idea of adding asiago cheese as I felt it wasn't quite cheesy enough as well (although it is quite good as it stands in the recipe). Will make again for a quick dinner along with a green salad.

Rating: 3
I, too, like the simplicity of this recipe. I used half and half instead of the cottage cheese and next time I will use asiago in place of the parmesan (and possibly sprinkle some on top of the spinach.)

This was a delicious quiche for Christmas brunch, and very easy to make. I also used 1/2&1/2 instead of cottage cheese and I will do this when I make it again tomorrow. I used frozen spinach which was good, but will use fresh baby spinach next time.

This was a very good dish and very easy to prepare. I used shallots instead of onion which made it perhaps a bit more interesting.

Great basic, easy quiche recipe. Can make in a few minutes after getting home from work and have a quality product. Was wondering about mushrooms last night. Will definitely try next time. (non-cook husband can make also)

Good recipe. I agree with some of the other reviewers here, in that next time i will use this recipe more as a base and not follow it exactly. (Turned out well, but next time I'll vary ingredients.) Fresh basil was a great idea, and I used ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese.

Rating: 3
I used this recipe in making quiche for the first time ever & was delighted with the results. I took the advice of other reviewers substituting shallots for onion, using fresh spinach, using 1/2 & 1/2 in place of cottage cheese and adding mushrooms. I also mixed the vegetables and cheese into the egg mixture, then poured the whole mixture into my pie crust. My pie crust did not fully cook in the center of the quiche, and I'm wondering if anyone else had this problem. Also, I would like the quiche to be a bit taller (maybe mine just didn't rise?) so next time I make it I will increase the egg/cream mixture.

Rating: 3
Very easy recipe. Everyone loved it. I almost twice the amount of spinach the recipe called for and increased the egg and milk a little. Delicious!!

Rating: 3
Thanks to the other reviewers this recipe was delicious. I followed all the previous suggestions and substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese, and fresh basil for the dill. I also used fresh spinach and mushrooms for the filling and finally sprinkled the Parmesan on top and garnished with fresh tomato. The results were fabulous.

Rating: 3
This is a great basic Quiche recipe and it is to the purpose of what the quiche was first developed. Use the spinache as a medium and at all the leftovers from your fridge. I have been looking for a simple easy use recipe like this to use up leftovers. I think we all end up throwing out too much food and recipes like this help to prevent that waste.

Rating: 2
I made this the first time exactly to the recipe. I didn't like the cottage cheese and thought that there wasn't enough cheesy flavor. I used the recipe as a base the second time and reduced the parmesan to 1/4c but added 1/2c asiago cheese and used fresh spinich. I substituted half & half for the cottage cheese and added sauteed mushrooms. Also, used fresh basil instead of dill. Topped it with slices of tomato and it was delicious.

I have already made this twice, but with what ever was left over. I used ham and spinach with swiss cheese then ham and mushroom with cheddar. Both times I left out the 1/2 c Parm, but sprinkled it over the top. This was a huge hit in my house, and so easy to make!

I have made this recipe about a dozen times for buffet brunches. Big hit every time. I always substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese (I think it makes it smoother) and I play around with which veggies and cheeses I include. Suggestion: always make two!

This was easy and delicious as a base recipe. I altered it a lot however and it still turned out great. I did not have cottage cheese or ricotta, so used 1 cup half and half. I used frozen broccoli instead of spinach. I used cheddar and mozzarella for the grated cheese and sprinkled the top w parmesan. I made it for dinner tonight and it is gone!

Rating: 3
Definitely a winner. Easy, and with a convection oven, it cooks in 20 minutes! I added mushrooms and did shallots instead of onions, and it was delicious. My only negative is that it needed a bit more flavor--I will probably add garlic next time (though I did not use dillweed because I didn't have it, but I can't imagine that would make that much of a difference).

Rating: 4
I made the recipe exactly as shown and it turned out great! The only difference was that I used a 9 inch ready made crust in a 10 inch quiche pan...it didn't seem to make a difference. It was the first quiche I have ever made and was quite impressed with the results. I am going to try it again today and add a little ham or bacon as suggested by others.

Rating: 3
Tasted very good, I went lighter on the onion. I also added a 1/2C of half & half to make it creamier. I also blended eggs, cream & cottage cheese in blender so mixture would look smoother.

I've made this a dozen times or more, with fresh spinach or kale, usually adding a little more of each of the cheeses and doubling spices. It's a standby pleaser.

Great recipe for quiche. Very quick and easy. I substituted different cheeses with great success. I also used fresh spinach, I simple ripped it and then sauted it with the butter and onion.. very tasty.

Great base recipe-Used fresh spinach and followed the recipe. The next time I made it I but the cottage cheese on the bottom-didn't like the lumps on the top. Also added some milk-needed more moisture and egg substitute. This base can be used for any variety of ingredients.

This was my first time making quiche and the results were good. I used low fat cream cheese as another reviewer suggested but it was hard to mix up properly so if I try it again I will use the cottage cheese. Perhaps next time I will mix up the cheese with the spinach???

I thought this was a great recipe, compared to the Puff Pastry Spinach Quiche I had made last week for Easter Sunday. This crust (a store-bought one) worked perfectly, as it always does. And I found the filling to be terrific. I did add a dollop of half-and-half to the filling, as the cottage cheese and eggs looked a little dry. I used the nutmeg, dill, salt and pepper, but I added some cayenne pepper to the mix as well. I always like a touch of piquancy in a quiche. I will continue to use this recipe, and I'll have fun playing with the ingredients: veggies, meats, different types of cheeses. The scent of the quiche baking is a great greeting when guests walk in the house--they'll think you're a chef extraordinaire!

I have yet to try this recipe because every single quiche recipe that I make comes out runny. I end up having to put it in the fridge and eating it the next day when it's a bit stiffer. What am I doing wrong?

Rating: 3
This is the standard quickie quiche recipe that you can make tons of alterations with that's been around for at least 25 years and GLAD people know about it. When I'm in a hurry I simply use the frozen chopped spinach (get all water out), use bacon, or sausage. I then add the eggs and you can add cream OR cottage cheese. Top with mozzarella, cheddar, or a few combinations of cheese. When in season be sure and tried vine ripe and sweet sliced tomatoes on top of cheese. Great blend of flavors. Nutmeg, etc are the key to the layering of flavors here. Just a matter of knowing the basics and tweaking it how you want it. You don't ever need to view a recipe.

I used frozen spinach and maybe I didn't dry it out enough. I also added some pre-cooked sausage. It ended up being too juicy and the crust didn't cook. We each ate part of a piece and the rest is still in my freezer.

This quiche is so simple to prepare. I've used the basic recipe substituting different cheese, vegetables and even adding some bacon, sausage or ham with great results. I even make this recipe without a crust to cut down on carbohydrates!! If you make the recipe as above I recommend cutting down on the amount of spinach by 1/2.

Nixed the dillweed and nutmeg. Then we replaced the Monterey Jack cheese with feta, and added black olives. It was wonderful. Our first quiche, but maybe the last recipe we'll ever need! Easy to make and delicious!

For my brunch this weekend, I made three different quiches. This quiche is the only quiche that no-one really eat. The spinach was very dry and bland tasting. I would not bother with this particular receipe again and would search for a better spinach quiche receipe. I thought the cottage cheese for this dish was an unique idea.

This recipe was great! This was my very first quiche and I made it for my mom for Mother's Day. I added sundried tomatoes with the spinach and arranged additional sundried tomatoes in the shape of a flower on the top of the quiche before cooking. My one concern/suggestion is that the crust got very dark by the time the center was set... next time I would cook at 350 degrees to protect the crust.

I really liked this recipe once I added some half and half which seems to be missing from the recipe. There was not enough liquid in it when I first made it. Maybe I missed something. However once I added the cream, it was a big hit with my family - 3 kids and spinach-loving husband.

The quiche is good... however, I made the mistake of using canned spinach. I would definately recommend using frozen spinach. Next time I think I may also add some mushrooms.

Fantastic quiche! Great for potlucks. I added red pepper and mushrooms (cooked in frying pan with onions) for some extra colour and taste. Also, I used a combination of cheddar and mozzarella cheese. Fresh spinach worked well (just make sure you blanch in saucepan and drain off excess water before using).

Very good. I would substitute egg beaters or any egg equivalent for cholesterol reasons. Very tasty;because of the salt already contained in the cottage cheese, I did not add the 1/2 tsp. called for in the recipe.

This recipe was fast and easy to make. I took the advice of critics and used the ready bake crust. I would advise against that because the crust was too sweet. I also doubled the spices and it was very tasty.

Easy to make using refrigerated pie crusts. Do NOT use a deep dish pie pan, as I did, because the quiche ends up just 1" high will overcook easily. I used feta cheese instead of Monterey cheese, which gave it more of a Greek spinach pie flavor.

I made this quiche for my office. It got great reviews. I liked it because it could be served hot, cold or room temperature. I subsituted ricotta for cottage cheese, use formaggio (4 cheeses), added fresh rosemary instead of dill, and 1/4 cup half and half. It turned out great, the rosemary and cheeses really set it off. Thanks. Now I need one for mushroom quiche.

I'm still learning to cook, so I love how easy this is to make. And it tastes wonderful!! I'll probably make this dish often! Next time, I'll experiment with using egg whites instead. And I'm sticking with the ready-bake pie crusts mentioned by another reviewer - that makes it even easier.
