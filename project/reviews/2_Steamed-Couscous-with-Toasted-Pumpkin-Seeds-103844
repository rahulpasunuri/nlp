This steaming method makes really good couscous - nice and tender and no clumps. The aroma of fennel does come through, very subtly. The pumpkin seeds add nice crunch. Like most basic couscous dishes, this is probably not meant as a stand-alone.

This was one of those "did I do something wrong?" recipes? It had virtually no flavor at all (1/2 tsp fennel for 2 cups of dried cous cous?) this isnt really a recipe at all.
