I reviewed quite a few recipes for Tortilla Soup before settling on this one. I LOVED the simplicity of the recipe. I did use the spicier Rotelle brand tomatoes - doubled the recipe used 2 cans of Original Rotelle diced tomatoes (did not measure 1 1/2 cups). And followed the advice of other comments - I added 4 carots sliced, 1/2 a vidalia onion diced and approx 3/4 cup frozen corn. The flavor was amazing! Topped it with diced avacado, chopped cilantro and shredded Jack Cheese!

Very yummy. My first attempt at tortilla soup. I added oregano while cooking and avocado slices and cheddar cheese when I served it. I would definitely make it again. Super easy and fast.

My husband loved this recipe and he is of Mexican descent. He said the soup reminded him of his Grandmother's soup. I took some of the reviewer's advice and added a can of sweet corn and a can of red kidney beans. I also added a 48 oz. carton of low sodium chicken broth instead of adding water. I used a healthy corn/whole wheat tortilla and topped the soup with crumbled Queso Fresco. I used diced tomatoes instead of the Mexican stewed tomatoes as I did not want my soup to be too spicy. Next time I may try shredding a rotisserie chicken instead of slicing chicken breasts. The chicken pieces were a little too thick for my taste although my husband liked it :)

When I told my kids that we were having tortilla soup for dinner, they groaned.Then they loved it!!! Made as directed. Topped it with some Mexican cheese blend. Whole crowd really enjoyed it.Now need something to do with the rest of the bunch of cilantro.

I will definitely make this soup again. This was the perfect solution for left over chicken (from a whole roasted chicken). To avoid drying out the chicken, I added the meat at the end until it was heated through. I added kidney beans and frozen corn kernels. Next time I'll add more veggies such as zucchini and carrots. I didn't have Mexican style stewed tomatoes so I used just regular canned tomatoes with basil and it worked out just fine.

This soup is excellent. I have always made this soup according to the recipe and it comes out very good every time. The only thing I do differently is instead of canned broth (which is somewhat bland), I use the granules. It is a bit more saltier than the canned but it comes out very good everytime. I also leave out the crushed red pepper and I also use two cans of the mexican stewed tomatoes. I use Del Monte, if you dont like or can't tolerate spicy, do not use Rotele (it is extremely spicy). For an added kick, I will sprinkle the top with shredded pepper jack or colby cheese.

Very thin and bland, even with additions of many suggested flavors, including fresh chiles, some roasted green chiles, leftover sauteed corn, chile powder, extra veggies, and a bit more lime. I did use broth instead of the 2 cups of water. Just okay.

This soup was incredible. It cooked up so quickly and tasted delicious. It would have been excellent without any additions, but I added 3T sofrito, a small can of black beans, and corn. Served it with sour cream (no Queso Fresco available), shredded cheese, and avocado on top in addition to the tortilla strips. Yum. My guest could not get enough. I will definitely make this again.

My husband & I both loved this soup! We followed reviewers' tips and used pure chicken broth (instead of cutting with water), avocados, and plain yogurt as a garnish. We also tried it without the tortilla chips and found it to be better without them. Delicious!

This is a great base recipe. I enhanced it a little by adding three table spoons for Goya Sofrito tomatoe base, 1 can red kidney beans, and a I rubed the chicken in taco seasoning. My boyfriend loved it and almost ate the whole pot in one night!

My skeptical family LOVED this soup. I used leftover brodo instead of store bought broth which I think enhanced the end result. I also ended up adding more lime juice than the recipe called for because I liked the taste. Took a cue from other reviewers and garnished with avocado, crema and queso fresco. It's a keeper.

this was the funniest recipe because as i was making it, it seemed like there were hardly any ingredients. i thought it couldnt possibly taste like anything BUT it came out great. i pureed the tomatoes and added beans and corn and simmered it for a bit longer. other than that will definitely make again!

This recipe is delicious, but a bit incomplete. You should serve with shredded Oaxaca and Crema Mexicana for authenticity. If you can't get those, Mozzarella will substitute, and natural sour cream thinned with milk. Also, it tastes better if you'll save a chicken carcass and cook it off for your own stock instead of canned. Part of the "bland" people are getting is from bought stock or broth vs homemade.

So good and so easy. I used vegetable broth and 2 cans of tomatoes (one was fire roasted).

My wife is from San Antonio, TX, and grew up with torilla soup (there is a terrific little restaurant down there, "Twin Sisters," which does a nice version). I have made this recipe a few times, and would consider it excellent. I often make a few changes, which add maybe a little time, but result in a terrific dish. Rather than cooking the chicken into the broth, I salted/peppered/olive oiled a couple of boneless chicken breasts and baked them ahead of time. When cooled, I hand-shredded them in 1/2" chunks. Mexican stewed tomatoes are not readily available here, and Rotels are too tangy, so I used Italian stewed tomatoes, crushed by hand. Also, I just used all stock rather than 1/2 stock, 1/2 water. Finally, we also fried the tortilla strips in canola and drained them thoroughly. The strips tend to curl a little, which is neat for the texture. Garnish with avocado.

Muy bueno! Such a great starter recipe for the chicken tortilla soup I've been craving. Followed the recipe as is, and - as per the suggestion of some other Helpful Hannahs writing these reviews - I added a can of black beans and a bit o' corn. Even after letting this simmer for a while, though, I found it a bit more "brothy" than I would have liked, so whisked in 1-2 tablespoonfuls of masa corn flour, and then (before adding in the chicken, for which I subbed rotisserie chicken), I pureed about half of the soup. Cilantro, lime juice and green onion are KEY to finish this off and kick up the flavour. Looking forward to a repeat performance!

As stated by others, this is a good base but on it's own is very bland. Had to add corn and black beans to thicken it up a bit.

Delicious, easy soup. I used 8 oz. of leftover chicken from a roast I made the previous evening. I used 1/2 broth, 1/2 water, but added a can of corn and half a can of Pink Beans. I also added 1/8 tsp oregano and culantro instead of cilantro. My favorite addition,however, was a sprinkle of chili powder into the olive oil before I brushed it onto the tortillas. Gave them just the right kick. My kids didn't love it, but they're so picky anyway. I can't wait to eat it again tomorrow!

I made this for my family, and we really liked it. It was quick and easy but I used some ingredients that might have compromised the flavor just a bit. Regardless, we loved it and I will make it again. I made 1.5 times the recipe on the first attempt but will double it next time. I used dried cilantro so I think 1/4 cup is too much. Next time I will use much less or try using the fresh cilantro. I added two cans of cooked chicken instead of cooking the chicken breast. I added Spanish rice. I debated the rice but it turned out to be a hit with my family. I also added a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and chiles. I added finely ground white pepper as well as fresh ground black pepper. I used sea salt instead of table salt. We loved the tanginess that the fresh lime added.

Rating: 4
I agree with the other reviewers: this recipe is a great start. I added frozen corn, red bell pepper, 1/2 onion, a cup of black beans, and jalapenos. Instead of the raw chicken, I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store. Topped with avocado slices and shredded cheese. This was a surprisingly quick and tasty meal.

Rating: 4
All the reviews seem to agree: this is a great base recipe. I used rotissery chicken, home-made stock and fresh corn, carrots and onion. Omitted tomatoes: my daughter won't eat them. Garnished with pan-fried flour tortilla strips, limes, cilantro, seeded chopped jalapano, diced avacado and sour cream. It was FABULOUS! Light and filling at the same time. I will made this again!

This recipe is a keeper! My husband gobbled it up. He loves burritos, and this is what I would say was like a burrito in a soup form. I took previous advice and added corn and blackbeans to give it some umph, worked out great. I also omitted the water and substituted broth. I will be making this again, and very soon!

I'm not sure what I'm rating here. I did add the water and wouldn't do that again. As I cooked, I realized the base was flavored water with specks of veggies and chicken and I started improvising big time.I doubled the chicken and added every ingredient mentioned by reviewers both in and on top of the soup. I added two 14 oz cans of black beans,cup of corn, doubled the cumin,threw in some cajun seasoning and tried to refrain from a need to salt it to death. When I'm looking at salt as a main flavor, I figure it's not much of a recipe.

Rating: 4
I used store bought chips and added corn, black beans, a 32 ounce box of chicken broth (skipped the plain water), a couple of chopped carrots and the whole 14 oz can of tomatoes. Turned out great! My kids (20 mos and 3 yrs) are very picky eaters and they loved it. I mixed some leftover brown rice in their bowls (figured it was a healthy alternative to the chips) and it worked really well. A complete meal! And so quick!

Excellent! This brothy soup is the way tortilla soup is supposed to be - it is all the toppings that make it yummy, fresh, and chunky. Made it for a party with family and got rave reviews. Used all chicken broth - no water - and used a roasted chicken from the grocery to make the chicken part easy. Served with fried tortilla strips, cheddar cheese, fresh tomatoes, cilantro, green onions, avocado, and sour cream. Tripled the recipe - wish I had made more for leftovers.

I'm giving this recipe three forks only because it has a lot of potential. I keep it in my recipe folder as a starting off point. As is, the soup is entirely too watery. As others mention, sub chicken broth for H20, and add lots of chunky stuff - zucchini, corn, beans... I like a LOT of lime, too. Definitely worth experimenting with.

So I've used Epicurious for several years now and haven't been compelled to write a review until now, although certainly we've made many delicious meals from this website. My husband made this recipe and it is DELICIOUS! The only changes we made, per suggestions on this forum, were to add black beans and corn, and to use a store-bought rotisserie chicken to save time. For toppings we had cheddar cheese and onions in addition to the lime, cilantro, green onions and tortilla strips. This is going into the rotation, Nummskers!

This can be adapted to give 2 different kinds of tortilla soup: Soup #1 is basically a clear thin broth heavily lime flavored. The changes to the recipe can be altered with omitting the water (or not) and adding the equivalent amount of additional chicken broth. I choose to also increase the cumin to 1/2 teaspoon and omitting the crushed red pepper and adding 1/8-1/4 tsp of cayenne instead. Left over shredded baked chicken works great in this. My family is not particularly fond of the cilantro spice so this is omitted. I also use the juice of an entire lime (or approximately 4 Tablespoons). The bay leaf can be omitted as well without much of a deficit. Soup #2: For a heartier soup, I include all the same changes as listed above, but I saute' a large onion with my garlic 1-2 cloves first and then add to the ingredients and bring to a boil. I add a 14 1/2 oz can of black beans (drained and rinsed) and an 8.5-11 oz can of corn or corn with chilis. This definitely makes the soup more filling. Both can be served with a platter of topping choices that your guests/family can put on top: avacado (diced), Oaxaca or Queso Fresco cheese (or just 4-5 Cheese Mexican shredded), sour cream, grilled/crispy onions, and jalapeno pepppers. The tortilla strips can be a good quality bagged chip from the store if you don't have the time to make your own fresh strips from tortillas. This is fast and quite good when you feel like soup but don't have a lot of time to get it on the table (The story of my life).

I make a big pot of soup every sunday for my husband and i to have for lunch all week and this is our FAVORITE recipe. I usually saute minced garlic in about a tablespoon of vegetable oil before adding the liquids and spices and then add a bag of frozen fire roasted corn and a big can of black beans. My husband likes it if the chicken is poached with some cumin and cajun seasoning as well. GREAT recipe!

Awesome soup! I make soup each weekend once Fall begins and this is a keeper! I sauted onion and garlic first in oil. I also added a can of corn and a can of black beans. I didn't do the green onions. Making your own tortillas is a must. My kids said we will make these all the time!

This is a great soup! I too added some onion and garlic in the beginning. I also added a can of black beans and a can of corn. My husband and I also like spicy, so I threw in some chili powder and jalapeno. My husband says he no longer wants to go out to our fav mexican restaurant for tortilla soup, so maybe making this wasn't such a good idea! :)

I also, as others suggested, sauteed an onion and the garlic in olive oil before adding the broth, etc... I didn't cook the tortillas, I just cut them up and added them just before the chicken. I used a store bought rotisserie chicken, which added flavor. Served it with shredded cheddar, avocado and tortilla chips. Wonderful!

I have been making this recipe for years and decided to make a few changes: To start off, I fried 4 corn tortillia in the stock pot in olive oil before I started the stock. before I added the chicken I prured the broth so it was a thicker soup. I added rotisserie roasted chicken instead of raw. Also added about a cup of chopped carrots potatoes and zuccini. I also added dried oragano to the broth. I topped with avocado, cheese.

I love this soup with a few changes: add onion, carrots & zucchini and a handful of frozen corn or peas to give it more vegies. I also add dried oregano and more crushed red pepper. It's a hearty cold-buster! I think the cooking time should be greatly increased though - it gets better the longer it simmers! I leave it going for over an hour and it's amazing... enjoy!

Made this with some big changes: I subbed 16 oz of Pico de Gallo for the tomatoes and garlic and used all broth and a rotisserie roasted chicken instead of raw. Also added about a cup of chopped carrots and a bit of coriander with the spices. I topped with avocado and store bought tortilla chips and this was awesome. I'll definitely make again, especially since it was so easy and quick.

Like others have suggested, I sauteed garlic and diced yellow onions in the pot before adding broth, tomatoes, etc. Also used rotisserie chicken...gave it awesome flavor. I'm sure the baked tortillas are great, but I just used chips. Really good and easy, and makes enough for lunch the next day.

Look no further! This is a fantastic recipe. I made the following changes based on the recommendations of the past reviewers: Add 1 cup chopped onions, 1 tbsp chopped jalapeno, 1 tbsp chopped green chiles and one chopped zucchini and saute with garlic before adding broth (use broth instead of water). Use hand mixer to blend before adding chicken (rotisserie). Wonderful!

This soup was outstanding. I followed the advice of others - began with yellow onion, sliced jalapeno and garlice - then add spices -- then added other ingredients. I added corn and black beans.

I'm new to the soup making world but, to my standards, this is a great tortilla soup. At first I was a bit skeptical at the minimal amount of ingredients but to my surprise this soup was full of flavor. I did, however, make some alterations: Instead of using 1/4 teaspoon of cumin I used 1/2. I precooked the chicken and sprinkled it with cayenne pepper before adding it to the soup. Finally, I added 1 diced jalapeño. All and all it was a good soup to make on a cold wyoming day. I loved the baked tortillas!

With some modification, this soup was very close to one I had in a restaurant last week! First I sauteed 1 cup chopped onion and 1 jalapeno pepper in oil. Added bay leaf, 2 garlic cloves, 1 tsp. cumin, and crushed red pepper. I used 6 cups of chicken broth, no water. Skipped the stewed tomatoes-- instead, I added 2 cups of diced vegetables: tomato, zucchini, and yellow squash. And I garnished the soup with sliced avocado and shredded Mexican cheese blend. Yum!

This is such an easy soup to make- its really fool proof. The combination of flavors are just right. I served with fresh cilantro, sour cream, shredded Monterey jack cheese, lime quarters, and tobasco. I let people add whatever they wanted. It was SOO tasty! I left out the bay leaf and the green onions and added a 14 oz. can of corn and a 14 oz. can of black beans, drained and rinsed. I also used store bought rotisserie chicken and tortilla chips and it was great!

I took the suggestions of others: sauteed a pablano and jalepeno peppers with onion and garlic before adding all chicken broth. I boiled the chicken on hand ahead of time in chicken broth with bay leaf. I can see the store-bought ready cooked chicken being an efficient alternative. I also added corn and black beans flakes. I processed half the soup to give it the creamy consistentcy. Added store-bought tortilla chips as other cook suggsted; once they are in the soup I doubt many would know the difference.Family like it and will make it again.

Just made this and followed previous suggestions to add corn, black beans, and substitute more broth instead of the water. It turned out great!

I made this for Sunday Night Football. It was very easy and received rave reviews from my guests. This is a great base recipe but I did make many of the changes recommended by the previous reviewers: sauteed garlic and onion. Added cumin and the other spices. Then added can of Rotel diced tomatoes with jalapenos in place of Mexican stewed toms. I added frozen corn too. I also shredded a pre-roasted chicken from the grocery store. This was probably the greatest move because my guests commented on how tasty and tender the chicken was. I used 6 cups of broth in place of water and broth. The lime was awesome. Served with avocado, cilantro, Mexican cream, mexican cheese, crushed chips, and diced jalapenos. This is a keeper.

Soup is very tasty but made these changes: Used rotisserie-style chicken from Trade Joe's, added lots of fresh chopped cilantro (along with the called parsley), added fresh lime juice and added kaffir lime leaves that I had on hand. The kaffer lime leaves are like Bay leaves and should be removed before serving. Like many others, I doubled the amount of vegetables.

So very easy and yummy. Easily open to options. I used all low salt chicken broth instead of water. I did not make the tortilla chips, I just used store bought chips. I also added 1 cup of sauteed chopped onion (I made a jalepeno cornbread along with the soup and had extra onions), sliced zuchinni and new potatoes to make it even more hearty. Next time I'll make it even more faster with a roasted chicken from CostCo.

Definitely add corn. I just made this for the second time (this time adding canned corn from T.J.'s) and my fiancee said it was the best soup I have ever made. An excellent, easy and relatively healthy weeknight meal...I will add this one into the rotation!

Like other reviewers...I didn't have %100 of the ingredients, but liked the soup none-the-less. I made my own broth with chicken thighs, celery, onion. I added a can of Rotel Tomatoes (didn't need the red pepper flakes after that.) I also added corn and I think the black bean addition that another reviewer recommended would be nice. This is a recipe which can pretty much be made to the diner's taste and not loose too much of it's beauty. Serve with a nice homemade corn bread and a salad with avocado, onion and orange and you will have a winner.

A wonderful light supper that's quick to toss together and full of zingy flavors. I used homemade chicken stock: 3.5 cups did the trick. I would advise waiting until the ABSOLUTE last second to add the green onions and cilantro, as they quickly turned brown and mushy while I dressed my side salad. I served a green salad on the side with avocados, orange segments and pomegranite seeds and a simple olive oil, cider vinegar, salt and pepper dressing.

My girlfriend is a pretty picky eater and she loved this one! Like others, I added about a cup of frozen corn. I didn't have stewed tomatoes on hand, so I used diced instead. I also used all broth instead of water and broth. I didn't have lime or cilantro, but I thought it was fine without it. I also added a bit of Oaxaca cheese. It is the wonderful salty and stringy Mexican cheese. It turned out perfect! This was a simple dish to make and one that I will definitely make again!

I made my own broth, using chicken (4 thighs) and 2 quarts of water (more or less) in a large pot using onion, celery, carrots,garlic and seaconed with spices. Takes about 30 minutes to cook the meat. Remove the chicken, shred the meat and set aside. Strain the broth and spoon off as much fat as possible. Make the soup as directed. I used 3 garlic cloves, added a little onion and one can of garbonzo beans (drained) Put the tortilla strips and shredded cheese in the bowl, then added the soup. Delicious!

Very yummy! I used Muir Glen Fire Roasted tomatoes w/ green chiles. Just a small dash of cayenne, no pepper flakes--tomatoes should be hot enough. I also added a handful of frozen corn, used NO water, just more stock, poached the chicken breast in the soup for 15 minutes, then removed to shred. I also added avacado on the top. I forgot the tortillas, but it was great all the same!

Four forks because this one exemplifies the best of Epicurious - a great starting recipe with loads of good suggestions for making it even better! I've made it twice so far starting with a 49.5 oz can of chicken broth each time and then broth from poaching chicken-combo of breast and thighs(no water please). The first time I used a whole can of Rotel tomatoes and then with a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of diced green chiles (both worked well). As usual I increased the amount of garlic each time and on the second time started with a diced onion, garlic and red sauteed lightly in a little oil before adding broth. Both times I added some Mexican Oregano (an idea from some other recipes on this site). I omitted the cilantro because my daughter hates it's flavor, but will likely add to subsequent batches after she is away at college. I also lightly fried the tortilla strips in oil and provided bowls of diced avocado,crumbled queso frsco or shredded Mexican cheese blend and sour cream or crema Mexicano for toppings (be sure to have the soup piping hot as these will cool it down considerably). The tortilla soups in Mexico city tend to be thicker,less brothy so will try out alternatives as suggested with addition of tortillas or crushed corn chip and pureeing of the tomatos for a different style soup. Ideas of addition of black beans, corn, carrots, zucchini, roasted poblano chilies, shrimp and roast pork and some dried Ancho chili strips are also great ideas I can't wait to try. Thanks Epicureans

Okay, is it just me or did anyone else think, "why would I add water to this?" Instead, I added more chicken broth. Also, I was out of green onion so I sauteed 1 lg. yellow onion with garlic and cumin and about a t. of ground coriander and a T. tomato paste. Then added this to broth and stewed tomatoes. This is a quick, delicious recipe and makes great use of that leftover chicken no one wants to eat otherwise.

This soup is delicious and so easy to make! I simplified it even more by using chicken stock that already had garlic in it. Also used nacho chips from the store. My variations probably killed the health aspects of this soup. If you use nachos from the store, be careful when adding the lime. I think the salt on the nachos combined with the lime might be a little too salty tasting for some people. Rice, corn, or black beans would also be good in this soup. !Buen provecho!

I used diced tomatoes, which didn't blend as well into the soup. I don't know how much heat is in the Mexican tomatoes, but I added a LOT of spice to mine to get it as hot as I wanted it.

What a simple, quick, and satisfying soup recipe. I made two slight alterations: I used the entire can of Mexican style tomatoes (rather than 3/4 c. of it) and applied a pinch of cayenne powder (rather than 1/8 t. red pepper flakes). Will prepare it the same way next time. This is a very pleasing and tasty bowl of comfort on a chilly day. Muchas gracias!

I've made this dish twice: once w/ chicken and once with shrimp. With chicken it is good; with shrimp it is VERY good. I used half a pound of shrimp. I also used Red Pack Tomatoes Petite Diced with Green Chilis (Hot/Picante). They really make it good and spicy. I threw in a jalepeno as well because I like things really spicy.

This was a very easy soup to prepare, no fuss at all. Flavor was out of this world. I was very surprised at how simple it was to make it and how flavorful it turned out. The cilantro and lime really give it that special flavor. I would totally make it again.

This soup was absolutely fabulous, just like one you would find in a restaurant. The lime juice and cumin give it the perfect balance of flavor. I made extras to have leftovers, but my boyfriend and I each had 4 bowls because it was so good! Very healthy as well.

Really terrific, this. Delicate yet spicy and even with a tin of creamed corn tossed in, an amazing caloric bargain. This is going into regular rotation at this house.

This was very good and VERY easy. I made this on a weeknight to go with tacos. The baked tortillas were also easy and a great touch. I just put the remaining tortilla strips into a ziplock bag and took the leftovers to work for lunch the next day. I made a slight mistake by putting adding too much lime. (Sometimes I add a little extra of my favorite ingredients). It was just a bit too sour. Otherwise, it was great.

Rating: 3
The flavor of this soup is fabulous but it turned out a little on the thin side. I added some chopped corn tortillas and some Mexican Blend grated cheese to thicked it up. If I had a can of creamed corn I would add that also. Definitley worth making but it's much better if thickened some

Rating: 3
Easy and good. Added Mexican blend cheese on top of tortilla strips along with a bit of sour cream and salsa. Put in a bit more chicken than recipe calls out. Next time I will add vegies etc to make it a bit heartier. It's a keeper.

Wonderful soup. Light and refreshing. I make soup at least once or twice a week, and my boyfriend said this is his new favorite. I did add 2 cups cooked rice, 1 cup frozen corn and for the tomatoes, substituted Red Gold spicy tomatoes.

Excellent recipe. I didn't use the cilantro because I can't tolerate it, but still found the soup delicious. We kept it light rather than hearty by only adding frozen corn. Upped the garlic and lime juice and added shredded pepper jack cheese on top with the tortilla strips (which I found to be yummy and well worth the effort.) I shredded my chicken and instead of using water, I added my own chicken stock to supplement the canned stuff. Everyone in the family enjoyed it. Always a good thing!

Nice soup for a cold night - like tonight. I followed the advice of others by adding to the recipe. Started with a chopped white onion and two cloves of garlic cooked until just soft in a tiny amount of olive oil. Added ingredients including a cup of chopped carrots, a cup of frozen corn, and 14 oz can of Mexican stewed tomatoes,which I first chopped. Also added extra cumin with chili powder and a small can of chopped green chili's. I shredded the chicken after cooking it a bit. Served with chopped avocado, Mexican blend cheese, cilantro, and sour cream. Will definitely make this again.

Perfect soup for a chilly night after a long day of work. Easy to make and very satisfying. I did not find it as spicy as some of the other reviewers. I added an extra 1/4 tsp. of cumin and thought it could use even more. I would have added chili powder, but I was out of it. I will add it next time and perhaps a chopped jalapeno. Followed others suggestions to add a chopped onion, an extra clove of garlic, a full can of the tomatoes, a small can of chopped green chili peppers,a cup of corn, and a cup of chopped carrots. I also cooked the chicken breasts in large chunks for about 25 minutes, then I shredded the pieces and returned it to the cooking pot. I crumbled tortilla chips on top and added some Mexican blend cheese, chopped avocado, and a dollop of sour cream to serve. Can't wait for the leftovers tonight!

Rating: 4
Great and easy recipe. I added some canned pinto and black beans as well as some frozen corn. I've also added sauteed diced red peppers and onions at the start of the recipe. I serve it with bowls of monterey jack and sliced avocado so people can add their own garnishes.

This was simple and a big hit. I used a roasted chicken from the grocery store. Also added corn and used the Tostito Gold chips. Using the Mexican style tomatoes was a good addtion as well. Added extra broth and tomatoes to stretch it and froze the remainder. Served with corn bread. Yum!

Rating: 3
I largely followed the advice of one previous reviewer and changed the recipe like this: I first sauteed onions and garlic, then added diced chicken tenderloin meat and browned that for a couple minutes, removed the chicken and set aside, then added a 14 oz can of tomatoes with jalapenos to the pot, then the cumin, then the chicken broth and water. I added some crushed (store bought) tortilla chips at that point and let them dissolve into the broth as the soup simmered. After about a half hour of simmering, I added the chicken back to the soup to finish cooking along with a can of corn (drained) and a can of black beans (drained), then finished it off with lime juice and cilantro. The first night I used avocados as a topping along with cheese, scallions, and tortilla chips, but I felt the flavor of the avocados got lost. The next night, I added rice to the soup to make the leftovers stretch, and this was a very nice addition (next time I will add the rice straight away), and topped it with tortilla chips, jack cheese, and scallions. Wonderful!

Been making for years and is always a crowd pleaser. I add a can of corn and dice up a couple jalepeno's. If I'm really looking to bulk it up I aldo add green beans.

Spicy and fantastic!

I have been making this tortilla soup for years and it is great with whatever you happen to have on hand. I usually add zuchini, carrots, corn and black beans...the cilantro is a must. Makes a great meal in a hurry. I buy roasted chickens, bone them and put small portions in freezer just for this recipe. Top off with avacado slices, a little cheese and a dollop of FF sour cream. Tastes even better the next day.

Rating: 4
Wonderful without alteration as a light starter. I feed teenaged boys, so I add most of the things listed in other reveiws - aromatic veg to the stock, corn and squash to the soup, and rice to bulk it up a bit. I offer Avocado, green onion, cilantro, sour cream, cheese, and the tortilla strips on the side. That way I can eat the healthy version, and let the boys load up on the goodies. A favorite at my house.

I made this for our cooking club and it turned out great. I added 2 jalepenos, diced, with the cilanto and topped with slice of avacado and a dollop of sour cream.

Loved this one, I used a jar of my homemade salsa instead of the stewed tomatoes, and I made broth by using chicken thighs first and then using the meat in the soup. I added a can of corn niblets and pureed a can of kidney beans and added that(made it a little thicker). Topped with an avacado salsa, shredded jalepeno Monteray Jack cheese, and used crumbled Lime Nachos instead of the corn tortillas. Delicious!

Rating: 4
Loved it! The fresh cilantro and lime juice are the keys to this soup's great flavour. I did change a couple of things about the recipe: 1) I used leftover roast chicken (mostly dark meat) instead of boneless; 2) I realized at the last minute that I had no cumin, so I used 1/2 tsp of chili powder instead; 3) I added a can of kidney beans; 4) I topped the soup with crushed tortilla chips and marble cheese; 5) instead of Mexican stewed tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes with green chilies, since that's what I had on hand. The soup turned out very, very spicy, so I would likely cut down or omit the red pepper flakes next time.

Rating: 4
My family loved this soup. I left out the cilantro because I dislike it and added a can of corn otherwise made the soup as written--the lime made a huge difference in the taste--it was good before adding the lime but great after adding it.

Excellent tortilla soup with a few minor tweaks. Was thinking to add oregano to the recipe but am glad that I didn't. For ease in preparation I used store bought tortilla strips that were baked, and a lemon herb baked chicken from the local market's deli that I shredded. I prepared 1.5 times the recipe to have leftovers for next day lunch. Sub'd 14 oz. can of whole plum tomatoes that I pulsed in the food processor. Equal to 2t. of cumin, and 4T. of lime juice. Sauteed 1 medium diced onion along with the garlic (always more garlic), added tomatoes, and small can of diced green chilies, then cumin. Added broth and 1/2c. of crushed tortilla chips. Simmered until chips were absorbed into the broth then added chicken, 1 can of corn, and 1 can of drained and rinsed black beans. Lastly added lime juice. Ladled soup into bowls and topped with crushed tortilla strips then garnished with chopped cilantro, green onions, diced avocado, grated jack cheese, and a dollop of sour cream. Served with cucumber slices dressed simply with lime juice and a sprinkle of chili powder. Chili's enchilada soup pales in comparison to this recipe. Family LOVED this soup!

This was great. I added more lime juice and it definately needed the mexican tomatoes pureed a bit. I added the corn as well. It was wonderful. We will be making this again. It was so easy.

Simply great! We substituted leftover chicken fajita meat and added corn. You really don't need the red pepper flakes. The soup is tangy without the additional heat. Also, added cheese quesadilla to complete the meal

Rating: 4
This soup is great, especially when you take some of the tips the reviewers suggested and doctor it up. I added just a little bit of diced jalepeno, slightly more lime juice than the recipe originally called for, corn, and also just a teaspoon or so of sour cream on top. I also think its a must to have fresh cilantro. Definitely will try this one again! It was so easy to make.

Rating: 3
This is a good, easy starting point; it's much better with some doctoring. I added a whole 14-oz. can of stewed tomatoes and pureed them slightly with a hand blender to give the soup more body. I added a minced fresh jalapeno pepper (two would have been even better); diced the chicken breast instead of cutting into strips; and topped the soup with Jack cheese. Next time I'd add a handful of the tortilla strips to the soup and let them cook down to release some starch (for thickness), and increase the lime from 2 to 3 tbsp. I agree with other reviewers who say it needs corn or beans or both to round it out. Also, seasoned roasted chicken would give it better flavor than plain.

Wow! My husband and I love tortilla soup but most recipes call for things we don't always have at home. This recipe is not only quick and easy but it is very delicious! It is just the thing I need to warm me up on a cool day, or pick me up on those blah days! A must for soup lovers!

Rating: 4
It was cool and rainy here in the Northwest and I wanted my mom's tortilla soup! I was a little skeptical about this recipe but it's too easy not to try. It was perfect with a little tweaking. I used my whole can of tomatoes with green chilies (fire-roasted, yum) as well as a can of corn. I also used left over roast chicken instead of chicken breast. Finally, Monterey jack cheese, avocado and tortilla chips to top it off. You don't need to salt the soup because of the salted chips. It is my new favorite quick weeknight meal.

Rating: 4
I have made this soup many times already. It's already become one of our "regulars." Easy enough to make for a quiet evening, and good enough for company. I always add corn and black beans (I can't imagine it without them!) and top it with cheese, avocado, and sour cream. DELICIOUS!

Rating: 4
WOW, THIS WAS GREAT! My husband asked me to make tortilla soup, and after reviewing all the recipes on this site, we're both glad I chose this one! I made the following adjustments thanks to previous reviews: Used 1 whole 14oz can Rotel, added about 1/4 cup of salsa, cut the chicken breasts into large pieces and after it was cooked, removed it and shredded it, doubled the lime juice (do not omit the lime juice, it adds such a great element!), I omitted the cilantro (I don't care for it) and omitted the crushed red pepper (didn't have any, plus it was spicy enough due to the Rotel). At the end I added a can of black beans and a can of hominy (pozole) which I thought was better than corn. To serve, I put the tortilla strips in bowl and ladled the soup over it, and garnished with a few tortilla strips, jack cheese and diced avacado. A definite keeper!

Rating: 4
I had never made a soup before and this was so very easy! My husband LOVED it and said it was the best he'd ever had. I jazzed it up a little with Monterray Jack cheese and lots of avacado as toppers. I have been craving it ever sence. It is a wonderfully hearty summer soup.

I have made this recipe dozens of times over the last two years. This has been a guest pleaser and highly sought after soup since I made some changes. To make this a four fork soup I changed the following. Use pork roast instead of chicken. Throw it in a slow cooker over nite (I've also roasted it in the oven in a clay pot) then let in cool and shred it by hand (remove all fat as shredding). Add the juice from the slow cooker or oven roasting in the soup later. Roast a couple pablano peppers, peel the skin, dice up, and add to soup. Double or triple the lime juice. Add an ounce of fresh squeezed OJ. I use a couple large cans of Rotel dice tomatoes. Skip the chips. This has been a guest pleaser and highly sought after soup since I made the changes. For the absolute best results, use homemade chicken broth. If you need a large batch, just shred the chicken from the broth preparation and add it to the pork. This freezes very well.

Rating: 4
This is a fabulous recipe that I have made at least 20 times and been asked for repeatedly. Over time I have perfected it by adding 1 chopped avocado, 1/2 cup corn, 1/2 cup shaved carrot, 1/4 cup celery, and a pinch of salt and cayenne pepper (instead of the 1/8 tsp dried crushed red pepper). Serve it with monterey jack cheese over the tortilla strips and you'll want to eat it every night for a week!

This soup is incredible! I never made something so easy, that tasted so good. I used a can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and added some salsa too.

Topped the soup with tostitos tortilla chips. Make it!

This was very easy to make and really delicious. I used a little more garlic and lime juice than the recipe calls for and added corn, black beans, and celery. For the tomatoes, I substitued Muir Glen organic fire-roasted diced tomatoes. They were fabulous in this recipe. I bought tortilla chips instead of making them as directed in the recipe. Lastly, when serving it the second time around, I put the chips in the bottom of the bowl, grated a small amount of monterey jack cheese on top, then poured the soup over that. It was great that way.

I also topped with cheese and my husband used sour cream. Fabulous for being so quick and easy!

I've made this soup, I top mine off with grated cheese, a dolop of sour cream, garnished with a slice of avacado. It is the best.

This soup is delicious! I added some white sweet corn to it which made it even better. I had made extra to have leftovers, but my guests ate it all.

I've received nothing but rave reviews when serving this dish. It's light, fresh and better than any restaurant version. I grate Mexican cheese and sprinkle over the top- yum!

While visiting San Antonio I had the most delicious tortilla soup. I was anxious to recreate it and based on the reviews of others I selected this recipe -- and it was delicious! I toasted different flavoured flour tortillas (regular, basil and sun-dried tomato) to add colour and added some cheese to the bowl to serve. It was wonderful!

I first found this recipe about a year ago. It is, without a doubt, the best tortilla soup in the world. I tried many restaurants here in Houston...but there is no comparison. I think it is the fresh lime that does it, along with the cilantro. IT is beyond compare.

I've tried lots of tortilla soups but there was always something I didn't care for in them. I couldn't put my finger on it till I tried this recipe. The others had too much of a tomato base and not enough or no cilantro. This broth was clear and YUMMY! Sometimes I add a handful of Minute rice for added texture and to make it a little more filling. I also sprinkle a small amount of three cheese mexican blend on top.
