Instead of cooking the asparagus in the orzo, I roasted it in the oven. Also, I used olive oil instead of the butter. It was wonderful, we will definitely have this again.

House favorite - I've made this countless times now. I always double the batch because it is delicious reheated for an easy take-to-work lunch. Confession: I have a meat/cheese problem and usually double the parmesan and prosciutto.

Made this the other night and wasn't too impressed. Expected much more from a four fork recipe. A little bland for me.

Very tasty. I wasn't pleased with the appearance, it looked a little "sticky" to me but my guests loved it and asked for the recipe. The prosciutto and asparagus flavors complement one another nicely.

This is fantastic and easy, and tastes like it was alot harder to make! We used slightly less asparagus than the recipe called for (about 100g less) both times we've made it and didn't feel like it was lacking anything.

This was super easy, and turned out to be incredibly delicious and hearty. Great comfort food. I won't lie, I did add a little extra grated parmesan, though!

My three-year-old daughter loved this. She asked for three servings. It took longer than a minute for the liquid to absorb at the end; I might cook it longer next time before adding the asparagus.

This is a FANTASTIC orzo, it looks beautiful because of the saffron, and the flavours blend beautifuly (especially that delicious prosciutto!) The best orzo I've ever made. And cooks quite quickly and with ease! Great for company.

This side dish gets rave reviews. Everyone seems to love it, even those who aren't fond of saffron. I have done this dish with many substitutions. Here are my versions, separately--although the original is still the best. 1. TAke out the prosciutto completely for a veggie side 2. Use water instead of broth 3. Use peas instead of asparagus.

Rating: 4
This has become a staple in my home. Although, I add different veggies sometimes and omit the prosciutto as my husband and kid don't eat meat. Have also made for a dinner party with broiled fish and herb butter and it got rave reviews.

Added one shallot, omitted butter, added 1/2 C white wine and substituted bacon for prosciutto. Cook bacon and added shallot before bacon was totally browned. Remove. Deglazed pan with 1/2 C white wine. Meanwhile simmer chicken broth and cook the asparagus in it 'til crisp tender about 4 minutes. Remove. Add broth where deglazed pan with wine and add saffron and orzo. Cook orzo til almost tender about 8 minutes, adding the asparagus back in about 1 minute before done. Add the Parm. and the cooked bacon/shallot mixture towards the end. Terrific served with Spanish style chicken - Chicken Marbella from Silver Palatte which I removed skin and broiled for a few minutes to brown the top....

Added some aromatics by sauteéing some finely chopped onion until softened and some garlic before adding the orzo, also added some white wine before the broth as suggested. I used the same amount of prosiutto but halved both the 1/4 cup of cheese and the saffron. It was lovely like this - will definitely make this again, in fact, I think it may become a weeknight regular!

This is a fantastic side dish. I added a little more cheese and proscuitto as suggested and otherwise didn't change a thing. I can't wait to serve it to company.

Rating: 4
Extremely easy to make and quick. I didn't use butter to fry the prosciutto--used nonstick spray instead and didn't miss it. All the flavors work so well together in this dish. It's hearty, but in a "light" tasting way--does that make sense? I made it for ten people at a dinner party--it followed the carrot cumin soup. Nice pairing, if I do say so myself :)

added sliced sun dried tomatoes when i added the asparagus. simple and elegant recipe. served with pepper steak with mushroom, port and zinfandel sauce (from this site) to a group of friends, and there wasn't a bite left. will make this recipe again.

Very rich and decadent. I will certainly make again. I think I will try to add more saffron (or a different brand) next time because I couldn't even taste it.

Rating: 3
Good, solid, and pretty easy. I followed the tips to add sauteed onion and garlic at the beginning, and I brought the broth to a boil before adding the orzo. Used vegetable broth, and added cooked shrimp at the end instead of using the prosciutto. My boyfriend the pescatarian really loved it as a main dish.

Rating: 3
Perfect for a dinner party as it didn't require 1/2 hour of constant stirring like a risotto. Recipe as written was fit for company, but it needed some more aromatics like onion and garlic, and definately add a generous lug of dry white wine or dry vermouth before adding the broth. Also thought the prosciutto was a little lost in the saffron. So next time will make it more like a spanish paella (sub the prosciutto for a spicey sausage like chorizo)or make it more like an italian risotto by nixing the saffron.

I tried this both with risoni (rice-shaped pasta) and orzo. Delicious on both counts and the color from the saffron is beautiful!

Rating: 4
I made this a side dish to serve with lamb for Easter, but this could easily make a great main dish, too. Everyone raved about it. The saffron really adds something special, taking the dish from merely good to divine. The strong, contrasting flavors of the vegetal asparagus and the salty prosciutto work really well together, too. I will definitely be making this often during asparagus season.

Rating: 4
Absolutely beautiful to look at and delicious tasting. Like a risotto but easier.

Rating: 3
Tasty, albeit with a few modifications: Halved the amount of butter, and brought chicken stock to a simmer (as you would for risotto) before adding it to the orzo. Also blanched asparagus in simmering stock for 2 min and only added to orzo for last minute of cooking - this allows more precise control of doneness so that it remains crisp. Omitted parmesan because was serving it with grilled salmon.

Terrifically simple recipe with great smoky prosciutto flavor. We used no butter at all and didn't miss it. We'll try it with turkey bacon and a bit of olive oil next time to cut the fat.

Rating: 3
I've made this a few times. I've used both prosciutto and bacon and both work well. I would use less butter and saffron because one, not that much is needed, and two, the saffron flavor is almost overpowering on the palate when using that much. I used mushrooms last night, which I sauteed after removing the bacon, and I added them in again after the asparagus. Company-worthy.

Very quick and easy to make. Made as a vegetarian dish by omitting the meat and using veggie stock.

I've been looking for a good, relatively easy orzo recipe for years. I've finally found it! The combination of flavors is simple yet elegant and satisfying. Good as either a side dish to a simple main course, or as the main dish itself. Simply marvelous!

Rating: 3
I made this as a main dish but used 2 chicken breasts cut into chunks instead of prosciutto (have to cut back on sale for blood pressure). I also added 1/2 of a chopped, sauteed onion at the start of the recipe, and then added the chicken. After the chicken was cooked, I did not remove it but instead added the rest of the ingredients as directed in the recipe. The family enjoyed it and there were no leftovers.

Made this wonderful side dish with the roast lamb with fennel butter. Absolutely delicious and incredibly simple. 3 out of the 5 children enjoyed it as well!

Rating: 3
This was just wonderful---so flavorful and so easy. It would be lovely with salmon---all those great colors! I always have to guess at how much Parmesan to use because I use a ribbon microplane grater. (I am not patient enough to use a grater that produces "finer" shreds). Is there a way to equate a weight with volume---e.g. does 2 ounces = 1/2 cup? Can anyone advise?

Rating: 3
Let me begin by saying my review should be taken with a grain of salt. For some reason when I saw the ingredient proscuitto, I thought pancetta. So I used a couple of slices of bacon, since I didn't have pancetta. Even with that boo boo, I still really enjoyed this dish. It was simple, but elegant and quite flavorful (the bacon was actually pretty good!)

Good enough to serve for company, and fast! If you want to make this a "pantry" dish, use frozen asparagus and just add them about 1 minute before the orzo is done.

This dish was so scrumptuous that it became our dinner with a crisp white wine. I didn't even make the fish I had as my main course. So easy and quick. And you can easily add more asparagus and proscuitto to bulk it up further.

Good, but very flavorful and rich. Served it with grilled salmon. Added the lower cuts of asparagus just after the orzo hit the boil. Next time will try it as a main course by adding shrimp or chicken.

This dish was just average. I would make it again because it was easy. However, I think there is too much asparagus, which gives a slightly bitter taste to the dish. I would omit the vegetable or use something less bitter. I think you can also add shrimp, chicken or even fish, but don't omit the fried prosciutto. The crisp flakes of ham give a nice texture and the necessary salt to this recipe.

The flavors work really well together. I didn't use any butter (sauteed both the prosciutto and orzo in Pam) and I didn't miss it a bit. Husband is not really big on saffron or asparagus but even he really liked it.

I made this recipe hours in advance by bringing all but one cup of the stock to a boil then turned off the heat. Just before serving, I added the last of the stock, asparagus which was microwaved for one minute and prosciutto. This turned out well and all the dinner guests loved it.

This is delicious - although next time, I think we will half the saffron and add a little more prosciutto, as someone else said they did. Also, this recipe makes enough for several people, and there are only 2 of us.

This recipe was fantastic! A real hit with my savvy gourmet friends--with whom I never seem to 'measure up'! I added 1/2 of grated parmesan and doubled the amount of prosciutto--you can't have enough of a good thing. I will definitely keep this recipe on hand for special events.

I used olive oil instead of butter and the dish was still delicious. I also left out the prosciutto ham and reduced the saffron in half. Excellent with broiled chicken breasts that have been rubbed with rosemary, garlic, salt and paprika.

We made as is except for cutting in half. This recipe is very, very good and we will surely make often. We make our own broth and keep it on hand it is very rich, dark and flavorful, so that was a plus for us, versus something like canned broth. But the asparagus and prosciutto flavors work so well with the orzo and parmesan ... it just makes for a very delicious dish. Highly recommended from our neck of the woods!

I, for one, like the recipes to be very exact. I always measure everything. For cheese, I usually weigh it. One cup would be 4 ounces. This ensures that my meals come out the same every time.

FOR FUTURE REVIEWERS or EPICURIOUS STAFF - If it seems significant, would you please note approx. how much cheese you used? -Just curious, since the list of ingredients calls for one-quarter cup of parmesan, while the text instructions talks about adding one-HALF cup of cheese, unless I'm missing something. Either way, in the meantime I'll probably use what seems reasonable.

Made this exactly the way it was written. Next time I would not use quite so much saffron (a little heavy for our tastes). However, the aspargus and the prosciutto were just wonderful compliments to the saffron and the parmesan pulled it together nicely. So easy too, the lazy cooks' risotto!

This has become one of our favorite side dishes for Spring. It has a wonderful blend of flavors topped off by the crisp prosciutto. Needs no extra salt.
