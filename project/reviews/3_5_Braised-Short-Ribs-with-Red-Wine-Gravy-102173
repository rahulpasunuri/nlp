I made this for dinner last night, used local beef, both short ribs and some shank pieces as the short ribs were smaller in size than those you might purchase at the grocery. Added sliced mushrooms to the vegetables. I skimmed very little fat off it, there wasn't much. It was fantastic!!!! I refrigerated the left overs but there was no fat to remove from it even after a night in the fridge. Excellent on a cold blustery Vermont day.

This recipe was the best short rib recipe I have made, served with yukon gold mashed potatoes. I had friends over for dinner they could not stop raving about the dinner. This is a home run!

I followed the recipe rather faithfully, with the exception that I used the boneless kind of beef short ribs that come with most of the fat trimmed off, in an attempt to go for a slightly leaner result. What I didn't realize was that, in order to achieve the desired tenderness with the boneless short ribs choice, I had to simmer for a lot longer time than the original recipe called for. The final result, however, was quite flavorful. I served with mashed potatoes and steamed baby green peas. Very comforting meal on a chilly winter day!

I don't eat much red meat anymore, but this was worth splurging on. Served it at a Cabernet tasting, so I used Cab in the recipe. Was even better the next day. My 1 suggestion is that to trim the grisle from the meat after it's done cooking (even if it falls off the bone - there may be some tough parts still on the meat.)

Even though this recipe requires some time and patience it is well worth it. Wow!

This is a very good sort ribs recipe. The meat turned out tender after cooling, reheating and cooking the stew for 2 hours the next day. The vegetables were glossy, melty and delicious. I didn't, however percieve any unique flavor from the cardamom and caraway.

makes a good beef stew, but not work the time or effort. would be much better with a cut other than shortribs.

Very good. My dinner guests raved. I found it a bit laborous, but maybe because I was juggling side dishes & a children's menu too. I served this with Mashed Yukon Gold Potatoes w/ Crimini Mushrooms and Sauteed Broccolini w/ Garlic. A lovely Argentinian Malbec paired nicely with the food.

Thought it was just ok; it was tasty, but not something I have a craving for. I prefer the lamb stew I make instead. The bones fell out of most of the bones; I also chilled it and skimmed the fat off the day after. Served the meat and some sauce (which was really hard to thicken) over mashed potatoes. You'd think w/ all the veggies I added, it'd have more taste :-(

THE ABSOLUTE BEST IN SHORT RIBS! USE ALL THE INGRED.LISTED...BE BOLD!!!! YOU'LL NEVER FORGET THE ALLSPICE AND CARAWAY SEEDS AS A WONDERFUL COMPLIMENT TO THE BEEF. MY HUSBAND ASKS FOR THIS DISH OVER AND OVER AGAIN!

Kudos to the reviewer who suggested stowing the dish overnight to aid in separating the fat! We didn't but will do so next time. This dish got better the longer you simmered it on very low heat. This was delicious--don't let the bad review dissuade you. Our first time cooking short ribs and we cut off all exposed fat. We look forward to making it again on a bitter cold day.

Very good! I was able to get most of the grease off the top, so that was not a problem. Will make this again!! As a previous cook noted. Will keep the allspice in mind for future recipes.

I made it one night and reheated it, so the flavors were even more intense. I forgot the celery leaves at the end, but no one cared! Served with raddiatore pasta to catch the sauce. Family asked me to be sure and make it again.

This is the first recipe from this site that turned out awful. I made the recipe exactly as stated. Even though I cut off the membrane and quite a bit of the fat and I kept skimming the fat as it cooked, it was GREASY. My son (who loves sauces and gravies) threw it away.

I was hesitant to use allspice, however it turned out wonderful. I omitted the tomatoes, because we are low carbing. Easy and delicious recipe.

A WONDERFUL Fall dish. Do it the day before, refrigerate overnight, skim the fat off in the morning and let it sit on the stove all day long. Serve with a nice red wine, a simple salad, and a good polenta or mashed potato and you've got autumnal heaven.

Allspice. The magic ingredient that brings out the flavor of the beef. After tasting this recipe, I will use a pinch of allspice everytime I slow cook beef. (I have also found it brings out the flavor in braised lamb shanks as well.)

This was great recipe and so much fun to make; so very easy and tasty. I omitted the seeds and tomatoes. The aroma this dish created throughout the house was a true TURN-ON and made a beautiful presentation.

Excellent dish! Very easy to prepare and well worth the time monitoring the slow-cook process. I left out the caraway seeds because of taste preference. We saved the remaining juices to use as gravy to put on rice for another meal. I debated on using a Merlot, but settled with a Shiraz.

This recipe was easy to prepare and delicous. I chopped all the veggies in food chopper and it took no time at all. I also trmmed the fat from the ribs before cooking and ended up with almost no fat when the dish was done.

This was a delicious recipe! Everyone loved it. It does take a while to cook, but is worth it. It's also important to find nice meaty, trimmed ribs....

A lot of work and a lot of time for a not so great cut of meat. This took so long to cook, I left it for the next day. The meat was just not tender enough. The next day I scooped out the thick fat that accumulated on the top, and served it over rice. It was tasty, but not tasty enough to warrant all that time. A simple boef bourguignone, chili or even ox-tail soup is much easier and less time-consuming.

i usually don't cook so heavy, but this dish is well worth it. my husband couldn't wait for the next days lunch so he could have the leftovers. i didn't have canned tomatoes, so i used fresh chopped. delicious

After trying a few recipes for short ribs, I've settled on this one. It got high marks from short rib lovers and was very easy to prepare. One change to make it even easier: after browning the meat, bake all in a roasting pan covered w/foil at 350F for 2hrs. The meat will cook evenly and you don't need to saute the vegetables.

Great flavor due to the unique blend of herbs and spices. Next time I'll make this dish in a slow cooker/crock pot. I'm sure it will be just as delicious.

This was just what we needed after 3 nights of Thanksgiving turkey. Our guests loved it too.

Pretty easy and great flavor. It's too bad that the ribs are so fatty. I served mashed potatoes for the gravy.

I've made this twice so far. The allspice adds an element of surprise but is not overpowering. The gravy is so good over rice. This is something unusual that even picky eaters will like.

Fantastic. The allspice makes this dish wonderfully aromatic.

Absolutely fantastic. The gravy over mashed potatoes or old fashioned potato dumplings is the ticket.

Not to difficult to prepare and absolutely delicious.
