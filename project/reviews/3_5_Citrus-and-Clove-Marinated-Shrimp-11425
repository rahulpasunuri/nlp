Dead easy to make with a few shortcuts for time (esp. I used Cholula sauce instead of the chile)and wildly popular, even my 4 year old son liked it.

I've now tried this twice because it just sounds so good. I won't make it again - when I used boiled shrimp the acidic marinade made them very tough. The I tried just blanching and then marinading (a la ceviche). The texture of the shrimp was much better, but the overall dish was disappointing. There are too many better and simpler ways to prepare shrimp :)

I read the other reviews before I made this and took note that some people said it was bland and we like spicy food... I used about 10 dried whole chilies, 1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons of cloves and the same of black peppercorns and mashed them in the morter and pestal before using them and broke each chili in half so the seeds were exposed first. I also used two onions. For shrimp I used two bags of 12 oz frozen peeled large shrimp (with tails on)... And for the marinade I used about 6 cloves of garlic (almost half a large bulb) and left all the bits in that it was boiled in... it tasted great about 8 hours later, and even better 24 hours later... I served the schrimp, garlic and some of the onions onions in a bowl and edged it with lime and lemon slivers alternated... Very easy to make, great a night in advance and will definately do it again and experiment more with the flavours...

I think the key here is to maridane overnight (at least 8 hours). As an experiment, I made the recipe as is and tasted the shrimp every few hours. The flavor didn't seem to stand out until after about 8 hours. After that, it just kept getting better. Very nice recipe. Simple and quick to prepare, and delicious.

I make this every christmas and have yet to find a better shrimp boil. Everyone comments on them and wants the recipe. For those who found it flavorless - try again - must have been a bad day - come to think of it I think I usually throw a couple of extra chilie peppers in....

Listen... I made this with great care. I, too, went with large shrimp. This was a terrible disapointment. It was very bland..... sure, people ate them but I contend that anything with shrimp in it will be eaten. No, skip this one, it really tastes like nothing special at all. I won't be making it again.

The reveiws sold me on this one ... plus the recipe read really well. So I was a little surprised at how lifeless the final result was. I served my Mom and sister (big fans both of shrimp and my cooking) and we all agreed the recipe needed a whole lot more of everything. I'll try this again -- I could have been having a bad day -- but I'll increase all the hot and sharp flavours just to be on the safe side.

I must say, this should be a five star also. Yum Yum.

This was fabulous! Four forks, HA! Five Stars!! There wasn't a shrimp left in the house. I Prepared a day ahead, and I exchanged the small shrimp with Large Gulf Shrimp (11-12 per lb.). And doubled the recipe.

I made this for my sister-in-law's wedding reception. I doubled the recipe to 6lbs of shrimp and they were all gone in the space of 10 minutes. This is very easy and guaranteed to please.

I made this for a party and people would not move away from it -- they hovered over it and ate until it was gone!

I used some red pepper flakes instead of the hot chiles and it was a wonderful dish.
