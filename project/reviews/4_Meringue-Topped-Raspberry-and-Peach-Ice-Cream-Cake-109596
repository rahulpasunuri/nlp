Great! I too thought there was too much crust for a 9" pan so upgraded to a 10". I didn't adjust the amounts of ice cream. Instead I put thin layers of chocolate genoise in between the ice cream layers. It looked absolutely beautiful when cut.

Fabulous dessert and beautiful presentation!! Couldn't find peach ice cream so used mango ice cream, and raspberry gelato - delicious! The crust recipe was way too big for a 9 inch pan, so put it into a 10 inch, and adjusted ice creams accordingly. I cut back on the butter too--1/2 cup or less was fine. I also used 5 egg whites to ensure the meringue was enough, and it was perfect. I served it with raspberry puree as well. Will definately make this one again--everyone raved about it!!

I made it with a few modifications. I used strawberry ice cream instead of raspberry and I topped the cake with whip cream. I used it for a summer birthday cake, so I placed a chocolate plaque on top with writing on it. It was amazing, especially with the raspberry, peach compote on top. A beautiful presentation. The only problem I encountered was cutting it. The crust was so frozen, it wouldn't cut easily. It took some muscle, but likely would have been easier if I would have left it out of the freezer for a few minutes, before I cut it. Great summer treat!!!

I adapted this recipie using whipped cream and fresh fruit and the compote on top rather than the meringue. It was a huge hit at a summer party. The crust recipie was the perfect amount for a medium thick crust. I also made it in a 3 inch tall pan that held three pints of ice cream very well. The compote was also very good. I may use layers of it in between the ice cream layers next time. I am certain to make this recipie several times this summer.
