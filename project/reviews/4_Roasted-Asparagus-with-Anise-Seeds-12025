This was an interesting taste combination -- nice change from the usual roasted asparagus with balsamic vinegar. Wouldn't make this my 'go to' recipe, but will definitely make again.

I made this specifically because it seemed so simple, and I was already making two other more complicated dishes for dinner guests. I figured this would be okay - not great, but better than plain steamed asparagus. I was mistaken. Roasted asparagus and ground anise seed are made for each other. It's one of those magical pairings of flavors.

I second the kudos from previous reviewers. Have used fennel seeds with equally nice results.

This was a quick and simple way to use the last asparagus of the season, and excellent as well. Definitely will become a standard way to cook asparagus in my house. I roasted my asparagus for 12 minutes, unshaken. It didn't seem to call for any pepper to me, but I did sprinkle on some coarse sea salt.

My husband and I liked this one. I didn't cut up the asparagus because I like the presentation of whole spears. The anise gives it a different, subtle flavor.

strangely, i can't stand the taste of anise in other recipes, but i love how subtle and wonderful it is here with fresh asparagus. what an easy way to do something different with such a familiar vegetable!

Oh so good and oh so simple! Served it Friday night and had friends call Chef Cathy today for the asparagus the way you did it the other night!

A very good and easy recipe. Try it!

Simply divine. And I'm not a fan of anything that tastes like licorice. We ate this recipe every other night when fresh asparagus was in season. Never any leftovers. Do yourself a favor and try it.

This is the way I am roasting asparagus from now on as a quick vegetable for weeknights. I agree with the reviewer below that anise has a way of bringing out the great flavor in asparagus. My favorite spin on this is to add some minced garlic and a squeeze of lemon.

My husband said, "This is the best asparagus I've ever had." I liked it very much. It's so easy. (I roasted mine at a lower temp for a longer period of time so it would cook at the same time as the other dishes I made.) Try it. It's easy and GOOD.

Wow, great asparagus recipe and so easy! Who would have thought anise would go so well with asparagus. It's not like an added taste, more like an enhancement of the naturally delicious asparagus flavor.

I really enjoyed this all by myself two nights ago (I meant to save some for my husband, who wasn't home at the time, but I ate it all!) and I am looking forward to making it for a dinner party tomorrow night to be paired with salmon with a horseradish sauce and garlic smashed potatoes. I highly recommend this as a "different" approach to asparagus.

This recipe was incredibly easy, delicious, and the presentation was beautiful. The anise seeds add a delicate and complementary flavour to the crisp, bright asparagus. I would suggest using the skinniest asparagus avaliable, and sprinkle a bit of sea salt on top.

What an easy way to prepare asparagus! I felt like I was eating at a gourmet restaurant, the asparagus was so bright and fresh! The anise adds a nice subtle zing. If you are worried about the amount of oil, you could get away with 2 tsps instead of a tbs, but olive oil is so healthy, who cares!

Delicious, especially if you appreciate the flavor of anise.
