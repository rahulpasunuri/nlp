This recipe is delicious. I would make again for company as the olive chimichurri (more like tepenade) adds complexity to the dish. We grilled it which I would recommend. Great way to prepare strip steaks!

We did the recipe exactly as stated and it was absolutely delicious. Be careful not to let the garlic toast, it completely changes the flavor -- we did two batches and it was significantly different.

Although this recipe was delicious, it's not fair for me to give it a rating since I did tweak it by grilling the steaks outdoors instead of cooking them in the oven. I especially loved the chimichurri accompaniment, and it got rave reviews from my mother-in-law.

This is good. But don't waste your time using it on a good grain fed rib eye. Use on a lesser cut like a sirloin. Fran

one of the best indoor steak recipes ever. did not change one thing. i made it for a small dinner for four and got rave reviews. the amount was perfect as there were two big meat eaters in the crowd.

This is a new way to make steak for me. It is a good in the house winter steak,not on the grill, with added flavor. I will make this again for a dinner party.
