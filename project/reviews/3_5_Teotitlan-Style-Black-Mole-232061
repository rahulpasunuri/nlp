This was a royal pain to make, but it was great. I would make this again in a heartbeat. That said, I think that you'll need (much) more than one cup of chicken stock to thin the sauce. It really does form a paste, and the flavor is intense. Without more stock, it's more a filling than a sauce.

Mole sauces have always intimidated me for the number of ingredients and all the steps. This recipe was no different, but the pain and suffering were well worth it. This sauce, chock full of wonderful and complex flavors, is a perfect addition to any dish that needs depth. I plan to use it in my chili the next time I make it. A++

WHAT A TOTAL AND ABSOLUTE pain in the butt to make! not to mention time-consuming. But OMG! OH SOOOO worth it!!!! Very different, definitely not for all tastes but knocked my socks off. As for the advice of burning the chiles far, far away, take it. Strong & spicy flavors/aromas are the norm here in N.O., esp. after the multitude of intolerable stenches we had to put up with after Katrina, but if you like your neighbors, heed the warning!
