This recipe is delicious and I'm not that fond of beets. The roasting brings out a sweeter, more subtle beet flavor, and the dressing really makes the recipe. I roast double or triple the beets, and double or triple the dressing, tossing some with the beets and storing the rest. The beets keep exceptionally well, so I just toss with fresh lettuce, pear, extra almonds, and goat cheese (amazing in this salad) as needed for up to 2 weeks. The dressing serves as a preservative I figure. I have served this on many occasions to friends and family and everybody loves it, even beet skeptics. Since discovering how well the beets keep though, I am more reluctant to share.

This is an outstanding salad recipe. The almonds really make the difference. I've found that you can just toast the almonds and just put the oil with the other ingredients; it works well both ways. I've used spring onions instead of shallots as a very flavorful alternative. I plan to use the dressing for other salads too.

This was delightful! I used mixed greens instead of arugula, a fuji apple instead of a pear, left out (read: forgot) the sugar and added some goat cheese. All in all, it was great. Not too filling, and a good balance of flavors and texture.

I made this tonight also without the pear and with the blue cheese (equal amount of cheese and almonds). It came out great! Love the roasting of the beets - intensifies the flavor - rather than boiling.

I have made this recipe for 2 parties and even people who generally don't like beets raved about it. I had to accomodate a citrus allergy and just used a pomegranate juice to substitute the lemon juice and because I couldn't get the baby arugula, I just put arugula leaves down as a bed and served the beets, pear and almonds with the dressing drissled over top.

We loved this salad. Which says a lot since my husband usually won't eat beets. The combination of flavors is great and it's really easy to put together. I used blanched, slivered almonds and drained on a paper towel (as suggested by a previous reviewer). I also used sea salt on the almonds.

Nice dish. I used pine nuts and balsamic and left out the sugar and pear. Yummy.

This recipe was a huge hit. I used a bosc pear, as I didn't have an Asian pear-and I julienned the pear. The one thing I would do differently next time is to drain the almonds (after removing them from the oil) on paper towels. And I used arugula, and put the beats and dressing over the arugula, layered the marinated beets, the pear, the almonds, and blue cheese over. Big hit with my guests and was a perfect starter for Julia's Coq au Vin.

Made this and loved it. Didn't have a pear but had feta and that was a great addition. Roasted red and orange beets, kept them separate until serving. Added a hint of truffle oil. Got rave reviews from guests. Picture does not do this justice at all.

I microwaved the beets which saved a lot of time. Also added goat cheese and canned mandarin oranges instead of the pears as I had them on hand - very good!

Served w/ warm goat cheese, it made a nice light meal. (Whisk together egg white and water. Dip goat cheese rounds in egg, letting excess drip off, then dredge in Eng muffin or panko crumbs, pressing lightly to adhere. Chill at least 15 minutes before frying in olive oil.) Substituted pecans instead of almonds and used seasoned rice vinegar instead of red wine vinegar. I made twice as much dressing which was not as sweet as other beet recipes can be but just right for our tastes. Roasting the beets as directed was very easy.

By far the best beet salad I ever had! and roastig the beets were super easy...Im not sure why anyone would try another method. loved them! Thanks!

This was great. I made it as directed, and thought the flavor of the roasted beets was wonderful. I used really little ones and they were just a little sweet. Agree that one could get by with a little less of the pear. Overall, this was a refreshing salad that I will definitely make again. Everyone loved it.

This is a great recipe. I actually boiled my beets which turned out great. You can use less pear it you want. One turns out to be quite a bit. I used watercress instead of mache or baby arugula and it was perfect. I will make this again and again. Easy since you can do the beets ahead.

The dressing was excellent when blended with the beets, and the asian pear and almonds were a great compliment. I put the beets, pears and almonds on a bed of greens, making it more of a green salad with beets, rather than a beet salad with greens. This was a better "sell" for my family at Thanksgiving!

Made this for a work party...the grocery store was out of beets so I actually used canned pickled beets instead. I was distressed about this but I've actually gotten numerous requests for this recipe! Added blue cheese.

I've never purchased beets before - much less, prepared them - but wow wee, all my trepidation flew out the window with the first bite of this salad. Cooked, cooled, sliced,then marinated the beets the night before serving; refrigerated in a single layer, in a glass casserole, covered. Flipped the beets the next morning to continue marinating. Took minutes to put together when serving. Do add some blue cheese crumbles to each serving - it compliments the flavors beautifully.

This is a very good salad. I used toasted walnuts and crumbled goat cheese on top. Great combination of flavors.

This is my go to beet recipe. I have tried many more & always come back to this one. Like others, I always add cheese - either blue cheese or feta cheesee crumbles.

Very good. I'm a big fan of beets and this recipe showcased them nicely. I especially liked the toasted almonds.

Like some of the other reviewers, I added blue cheese. It was delicious. I couldn't find an Asian pear so I substituted a different kind of pear. Both the pear and the cheese made this a marvelous dish. The dressing is unique. I can't say it's perfect, but it fits well with all the other ingredients.

Wonderful contrast between sweet beets, salty tart dressing, bitter arugula, and crisp almonds. Tried on spinach too, but the arugula was best.

I made this salad for a party on the 4th and it was a big hit. I definitely would make it again.

I used this salad just for the dressing, cause I make my own version of the roasted beet salad. But what I liked about this salad is the addition of the pear. I used candied walnuts instead of almonds and added blue cheese crumbles and it came out great!

Made this for my family who loves beets fixed almost anyway. This was a little disappointing in that it lacked zip. Maybe a little more vinegar would add the lift it needed.

as recently converted lover of beets, I thought this was awesome. AND my 20 month old baby liked it. what more could you ask for? I skipped the lettuce & subbed peaches for the pear. yum!

I had seen this recipe, and decided to make it for july 4, but the epicurious search engine was down for the weekend. I made it anyway, from what I remembered, and the main difference was that I used no vinegar or sugar, and didn't bother with the greens. Everyone loved this salad. One person said she dreamed about that nite. The combination of the beets and the asian pear is truly inspired and delicious.

Absolutely loved this salad. Was simple to make and presentation was great as well. I did add a little dijon mustard to the dressing. Would definitely serve it again.

amazing!! people were asking for more. my husband (who up 'till now did not eat beets) LOVED this salad. the mixture of sweet and salty, soft and crunchy is sublime! we've made it several times now, sometimes with the addition of a little crumbled blue cheese. yum!

I made this for our Book Club Dinner (Jitterbug Perfume by Tom Robbins--if you read the book, you'll know why I picked this recipe). First time I have served beets, also first time I ate an entire serving of beets--excellent balance of sweet & sour & salt. Other members enjoyed them as well.

This is a great salad! I used mixed field greens and some endive. I bet it would be great with some goat cheese!

We made this recipe tonight as a trial for Christmas Dinner. We thought it would be beautiful as a "red and green" salad. We thought it was fabulous and will definately make it again. We used a variety of beets both large and small and different colors, and a since we didn't have an asian pear on hand we used a bartlett. Our kids loved it! Oh, we also substituted roasted pecans for the almonds! YUM!

I wish I could rate this with 5 forks. It was the hit of our dinner party this past Saturday night. I served it as the first course of a meal followed by Daniel Bouldoud's short ribs, garlic mashed potatoes, carrots vichy and lemon meringue pie for dessert - all from this web site. The beets were a welcome and delicious (make ahead) surprise for everyone.

Glad I read the reviews and forgot to look at the picture. This salad is not only delicious it's so beautiful it could be on the cover! I don't know how they have such a horrible picture of it. I used golden beets and red too and it was great.

This recipe looked beautiful, but was boring. I would use regular pears, instead of Asian pears, which are just trendy, rather than flavorful. The whole thing could use more zip.

This is a truly great recipe. Made this for my wife (who is not crazy about beets) and I and we both finished the entire dish. I used baby arugala for the greens. Highly recommend this to anyone who wants a very refreshing dinner salad.

The presentation of this salad is so wonderful, I wanted each person to have their own salad plate. Next time, I think I'll make a sweet oil and vinegar dressing such as raspberry or others I make from Napa Valley CA vinegars... and drizzle ONLY about 1/2 tbls over the top of the finished salad. Just barely enough to work with the sweet flavor of the pear. This is really a WOW recipe!

I happened to have asian pears on hand and wow! My husband who is not a fan of beets really enjoyed this salad and would like it again. I used arugula and the flavors blended together very well! Delicious!
