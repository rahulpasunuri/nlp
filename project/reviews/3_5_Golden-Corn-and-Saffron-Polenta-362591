I thought this was a wonderful dish!! I used fresh corn and served it with the pork roast with black bean sauce. Really, really good and easy.

This was okay. A little thick, a little funky tasting on its own. It goes super well with a protein with an accompanying sauce, like the Veal with Sherry Gastrique as it thinned it down and gave it an added taste. Maybe I'd cut down the saffron a bit next time. It is quite elegant though.

My husband and I love this! Made twice so far, served once with faux fried chicken that was crusted with a cormmeal/breadcrumb/dried chipotle chili mixture, and once with grilled Louisiana hot links and steamed apples.

Made the recipe as is, was smooth and flavorful. Served it with beef short ribs in chipotle and green chili sauce from this site and it was an outstanding combination.
