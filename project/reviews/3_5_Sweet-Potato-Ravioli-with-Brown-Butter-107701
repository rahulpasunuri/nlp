amazing recipe, tried this with other sauces i.e. alfredo and it was equally good. The best however was serving the raviolis over spinach with an alfredo sauce spiked with a little orange liqour

Easy to make. I prefer this dish with sage leaves fried in the brown butter sauce and topped with chopped toasted walnuts. My husband said it was restaurant quality. Good recipe. I basically do the same with butternut squash as well. For this recipe, I roasted the potatoes earlier in the day when I had the oven going.

I have made these several times, delicious. I also make them with butternut squash and sage and a brown sage butter. And YES they freeze very well.

Can someone please tell me if these freeze well? I look forward to making them per all the reviews, but because many of you said it is tedious, I'd like to make more at once. Thanks.

Easy and really satisfying. The smell of browned butter is so enticing you could eat an old leather shoe if is was sauced with this. I couldn't find wonton wrappers in my rural grocery store so I used eggroll wrappers and made four raviolis at a time with two wrappers. I coated the wrapper with the egg white, placed four dollops of sweet potato in each corner. Placed another wrapper on top of all, pressed down around dollops and then cut into four squares. Worked excellently. Used fresh french tarragon as well as a little fresh thyme. Tarragon was very nice with the sweet potato. I omitted the nutmeg.

My family and I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I've made it four or five times and have a few tips/suggestions though. Cooking each potato in the microwave will take just as long but more effort than just throwing them all in the oven for 40 minutes at 400. Get a bunch of small potatoes and they may cook faster, but either way, 3 big potatoes times 15+min each in the microwave is worse. For the sauce, I cut it down to 1 stick of butter, but with 2.5T balsamic, the thyme, plus 1.5T of brown sugar. I keep it on the heat till it caramelizes a bit. It's a lot of manual labor assembling all the raviolis, so make sure you have enough time because it will be well worth it!

Very, very good! Would ease up on the brown sugar next time. Will also try it with butternut squash, that would be a great variation.

This was the first recipe I ever tried on Epicurious and it did not disappoint! In fact, one year after making it for the first time, my sister insisted that the only thing I needed to get her for her birthday was 4 servings of this to eat at her birthday dinner. The brown butter sauce brings it all together and it's very easy to make!

absolutely loved this recipe! made it for a bunch of friends tonight and everyone was raving about it. i've been looking for a brown butter recipe as amazing as many restaurant dishes, and i think my search ends here! Variances from the original recipe: used yellow sweet potatoes rather than yams; added 1 tsp cinnamon to the sweet potato mix; used one wonton wrapper per ravioli rather than two; cut butter to just 1/2 cup; used sage rather than thyme; and topped it all off with the suggested pecans. i think this recipe could be just as good with the yams, pumpkin, butternut squash, etc.

This is delicious. I used butternut squash instead of sweet potato. I did use a few pine nuts and the fresh sage. This is very good!!!

This recipe came out very well. It works well with a mixture of sweet potato and butternut squash, I've also had it elsewhere with pumpkin. I agree with whoever recommended sage butter sauce, it is delicious. I personally recommend seasoning the filling with more than just nutmeg - personally used cinnamon, cumin and fresh ground pepper. I also pureed the filling in the blender with a little bit of water and milk (about 1/2 cup total) to make it a smoother consistency. Like others I prefer using only 1 wonton wrapper per ravioli, and served it over a bed of mixed greens.

I love the sauce for this recipe, but I like the filling to be a bit more savory, si I mash cream cheese into the sweet potatoes and leave out the other filling ingredients.

Great tasting ravioli - easy with wonton skins - advice: use adequete egg white to make them stick. ?I made the brown butter - but a bit too fatty, the ravioli had an excellent taste without the butter. Would be good with a wine-cheese sauce instead.

I made these for thanksgiving they were wonderful. I wanted something different from the norm and this was just right. There was still the delicious sweet flavour, but it mixed so well with the savory. I also added pumpkin seeds in the sauce for some crunch. I did have problem with them all sticking together, but I think that was myown fault. I think I may need to make these next year...

This was really yummy!! I used 1 wonton wrapper folded over for each ravioli, rather than two wrappers and served over Arugula.

I loved this dish. I am by no means the experienced cook but I'm learning and this was a fun, delicious recipe. I will definately make it again.

I added a French-Asian fusion twist to this recipe by including minced garlic, ginger and spring onion to the filling, then topping it with the brown butter sauce cooked with tons of additional spring onion. It was delicious! Next time I might add a bit of peanut butter to the sauce.

This recipe is one of the simplest and best tasting. Be careful when rewarming the butter sauce, and use the best balsamic vinegar.

Try the SWEET POTATO RAVIOLI WITH SAGE BUTTER SAUCE! It is so much better than this. The sage makes a huge difference.

Made this dish tonight, I loved the taste of the ravioli.Butter taste ok but bland and didnt look right to me, so that might of made it less appealing. My brown butter had brown flecs in it. I'm not sure if I made it right. I made a butter in a skillet, maybe a sauce pan would be better.Tried it over spinach, wilted in olive oil, salt and pepper. Could the flavors been all mixed up. If anyone has any suggestions, email me at eohm56@aol.com Thanks Ed

I made this tonight and since its the season, I substituted pumpkin for sweet potato. I also added some ground pine nuts, and a cup of ricotta. I made my own dough vs wontons, and added a bit of pumpkin to that dough too. I served it over sauteed spinach. Added whole pine nuts to the sauce. My kids almost ate the plates.

This recipe was delicious! Everyone loved it. I had never worked with won ton wrappers before and was delighted to find how easy it was. I probably should have used a bit more egg white to seal them together because I "lost" a few. I prepared the sweet potatoes the day prior and that saved time. I served this with ciabatta to soak up the wonderful butter.

Tedious, but not difficult to make, and quite good. The wonton wrappers make making the raviolis a snap. Will use them with other stuffings. Froze them before boiling; we'll see how they turn out!

This has become a week night favorite. I put a few frozen cheese ravioli on lots and lots of fresh spinach, and the sauce makes a quick supper taste like something special.

This recipe was very bland. The ravioli were too large and the presentation was lacking. I found the sweetness of the potatoes combined with the richness of all that butter to be a little overwhelming.

I was suprise how little we liked this. It did not present well and was just so very average.

I thought this was delicious. However, the "ravioli" were too large after cooking. I tried goyza wrappers (round) and just used one wrapper folded over and the size was more manageable but no longer the shape of a ravioli. These also froze very well.

It was okay. I wouldn't say that it knocked your socks off. Too much work for a so-so result.

I am so pleased that I found and tried this recipe. The ravioli was delicious! It was surprisingly easy too. I served it on top of a bed of spinach so that I didn't have to serve anything else with dinner. Makes a great presentation. I highly recommend it!
