Had friends over for dinner and they loved it. My husband doesn't love bleu cheese, but he liked this risotto with it enough to want the leftovers the next day. I doubled the recipe and added the liquid 1/2 cup at a time as it is done traditionally and nearly used 1 cup of crumbled bleu cheese and only 1 1/2 tablespoon sage because that was all we had from the garden. Yum!! This one is definitely a keeper.

Very tasty IF you can find really ripe pears. I have had mixed results and found it bland if the pears are not perfect. A full- flavored bleu cheese is essential as well. I often add a shallot with the rice in the saute stage. When the pears are good this a great recipe!

This is a great and very easy recipe, it was my first risotto and I can't wait to make it again. Next time I will use a little less sage and will add baby spinach or arugula in the last few minutes.

I thought this had no flavor and I was very disappointed. I did add the broth slowly as the other reviewers said and added extra cheese. Still no good. It also looks like wallpaper paste. The dish on this site with linguine pears and blue cheese is much better!

I took the other cooks' suggestion to add the liquid a half cup at a time (and to add more gorgonzola) and it was fabulous. I nearly ate the whole pot by myself. Even with the pears in it, it was still delicious reheated the next day.

We thought this was delicious but lacking that extra something. Next time I'll add a touch more cheese. I also added the broth mixture at a 1/2 cup at a time to get that lovely creamy texture. The pears were a sweet, flavorful addition. I forgot to "crackle" the rice and just heated in oil for two minutes. Next time I'll do it right!

This recipe is incredible. I halved the sage and was quite pleased with the results. It will definitely become a staple in my kitchen.

Risotto should ONLY have all of it's broth introduced 1/2 cup at a time. This recipe ads nearly all the broth up front, which ruins the delicate texture and infusion of flavor that the risotto should have.

Super risotto. I made the risotto as I always do with 1/2 cup wine/chicken broth at a time - add more once liquid is absorbed. Then added cheese and pear during the last two minutes. I used all the recipe amounts and measurements. Fabulous with roast tenderloin we had for Christmas dinner.

Shocked that we didn't love this recipe; the ingredients sounded to die for. It was bland, colorless, and boring. Mushrooms might have saved it.

This dish makes an impressive vegetarian entree. It is simple to prepare yet looks and tastes quite elegant. It has become one of my special event staples!

A wonderful addtion to this recipe is shiitake mushrooms; I add them just before all of the liquid has been evaporated.

The mix of flavors is a good idea; I might use those ingredients in a regular basic risotto as a sidedish for steak, but as a main course for 2 with a salad, this flopped hugely. I don't like the half-risotto method, and would alter it to use onion with the rice and to add the liquid a little bit at a time thoughout to achieve a better final consistency. This was only okay, at best.

I would use more sage next time.

This is quick, easy and excellent as a main dish. I cut up tomatoes, green pepper, and cucumber and sprinkled it with a honey-mustard balsamic vinegar dressing, and drank the rest of the bottle of wine. Perfect meal for two!

This is a fun risotto. I love the pears. It was easy and tasty. I make this often when I have friends over for dinner. They always rave. Some have even gone on to make it for their friends.
