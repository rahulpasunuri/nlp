Made this recently, substituting King Crab for the lobster and adding cilantro. Easy to cook and had a great flavor and lots of appealing color.

Are you kidding? Lobsters are at least $12-14 per pound here in Merion! This is a very expensive meal. Howerver, I will substitute something else, and I think it will be just as fabulous. I'll get back to you.

This is an excellent dinner for a warm summer night. Great flavor and very eye appealing. I was very reluctant to try any recipe without a review, but this was outstanding and a great hit with guest. I did add scallons the same time of the tomatoes for a little extra flavor and eye appeal.
