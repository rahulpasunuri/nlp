The beef skewers were excellent -- what a wonderful marinade. But the dipping sauce was just OK in my opinion. I would have preferred something with more kick.

Made this on the stove-top, seared the beef without skewers in a very hot pan. Yummm!!

Skirt steak is NOT flank steak. Skirt steak is the diaphragm muscle and is a very unique cut of beef (actually my favorite cut--bar none). VERY flavorful but still tender when cut on the bias and cooked quickly. I thought this recipe was great - cooked it for a big group at a tapas-style wedding reception. So many requests for more that we actually ran out!

Am I the only person who learned the cuts of meat? if you have any questions ask your butcher and stay out of the supermarkets! This was an easy recipe to make but slightly time consuming, you may want to take a little more time to thicken the hoisin sauce slightly

Skirt steak is similiar to but NOT flank steak. Flank steak is a better and more expensive cut.

As Sates go this is great. For those who don't know what skirt steak/beef is - it is flank. Flank works very well and its always tender. Chinese use Flank in their cooking.

You really need to use skirt steak for this recipe. Use very hot coals so the steak gets a crispy outer surface......like arrachera. The lime and garlic create a tartness on skirt steak that doesn't occur with other cuts.

The sauce was good, nice and tangy. The beef was so-so though, even with all the garlic and ginger which I love. We used sirloin, I hate to admit I don't know what skirt steak is. I guess the lime taste and the beef didn't go together well, just a matter of personal preference. I might try it again with chicken.
