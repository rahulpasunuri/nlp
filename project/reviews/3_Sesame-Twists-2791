Made this for "Greek Day" at middle school and my kids and the others loved them. Definitely use the butter. Made them into smaller cookies by making the ropes half as long as recipe says and they were more manageable. Dough was very easy to work with. They cooked in half the allotted time. Start at 12 minutes and watch for browning. Otherwise a nice alternative cookie--great with tea. Kids would like me to try it with some mini chocolate chips--not traditional I'm sure but I will try it next time.

No duh. No self respecting Greek even has margarine in the house.

The first time I tried to make this, I was unable to keep the dough together when shaping the twists, which was very frustrating. On the suggestion of my husband (who informed me that Greek dishes should never call for margarine) I substituted butter for the margarine and it worked like a dream. These were a huge hit with my family over the holidays.
