Interesting flavor. The cactus was quite good after being cooked. I would consider skipping the chile pumpkin sauce next time. I would also make the sauce first. It took longer than the veggies.

If you've never made cactus before, really get the eyes (and spines) off of there with a potato peeler. Hold the leaf by one end to better spare your fingers. Then wash the leaf well to make sure. This recipe is better by far than what you get in a can, but not quite as good as my favorite restaurant makes it.

I did not like this recipe at all, neither did any of my guests. I was very excited to try it, because I love nopales, but it took a long time for bad results.

I have made this 4 times. If planning to add the eggs, I found it more flavorful to omit water and double the chile puree.

Fantastic!! Nice southwestern flair. I have a menu item quite similar, yet a touch more south american than this recipe. I will definitely make it again.
