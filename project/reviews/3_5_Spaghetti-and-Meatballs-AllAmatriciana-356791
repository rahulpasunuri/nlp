All'amatrciana says it all, so expect spicy. I made the full recipe for the meatballs (froze half) and halved the sauce recipe. My husband loved everything about this, but I felt the meatballs turned out a bit chewy, and I did keep questioning myself each time I measured out the crushed pepper flakes. And I'm not sure what the bacon added to either the meatballs or the sauce. There so many great spaghetti and meatball recipes out there. If I were to make this again I would use a combination of ground beef and pork, and cut back on the crushed red pepper flakes. It's all a matter of preference. I love to cook so the prep time did not bother me.

Lovely recipe! It's one of those ones that seems a bit complicated the first go, but once you've stepped through it a couple of times you can streamline it quite a bit. For ease of cleanup, pureeing the tomatoes before mincing the bacon in the food processor (or blender, as I used) helps a lot. Also, I've found that lightly browning the meatballs on the stovetop and then finishing off in the oven (while you start browning the onions for the sauce) reduces the overall prep time. The bacon, the wine, and the garlic make for a gorgeous sauce. Delicious!

This recipe IS labor intensive and time consuming. Well worth it! A bit on the spicey side,adjust the amounts of dried peppers to your taste. The meatballs should be assembled well ahead of time. They fall apart when frying, so I took the advice of experienced Italian cooks and roasted them in the oven while prepping the sauce. They stay together very well if chilled before roasting. Add all drippings and crumbs to sauce with the maetballs and simmer a few minutes.Love to cook this on a lazy Saturday or Sunday!

Holy work:) It was good, just not sure good enough for all of the work. My husband loved it but he did have to make it;) I followed the recipe pretty closely only reducing roasted peppers and crushed red pepper after I read other reviews. I think the sauce lacked spices so I added some italian seasoning but still thought rather bland. I agree with another review, it tasted much better as leftovers. I may make the meatballs again but will look for another sauce.

Two flaws with this: (1) Too labor intensive for what's ultimately a peasant dish; might be OK if you have an Italian grandmother to work on it, but I wouldn't think it fair to put even her through it. (2) I'm a guy who orders "vindaloo" in Indian restaurants and "4 chiles hot" in Thai restaurants, but following the directions here yielded a dish that was too spicy not just my for wife but also for me.

I have NEVER attempted making spaghetti & meatballs from scratch before, but I wanted to pull out all the stops for my husband & make him an awesome pasta dinner the night before his 120-mile bike ride up in the Rocky Mountains. ANYWAY--I will NEVER cheat again & use jarred sauces. This sauce was SO delish!! I did omit the roasted red peppers & I only used 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes, otherwise I think it would have been too spicy for our girls. Also, I did not have marjoram on hand so I used some kind of Italian seasoning blend. Lastly, I found parmesan garlic Panko in the grocery, so I bought those. It still turned out fabulous with the changes I made!! Being up in altitude though, I had to let the sauce simmer for about 45 min.-1 hour in order for the sauce to thicken. It was WELL worth the wait!

The recipe actually gets 3 1/2 forks, but I went with 3 since we can't give 1/2 forks, and this is not as good as recipes I've rated 4. Don't get me wrong, it's really delicious and well worth making for a change from the usual spag and meatballs. I did modify a couple of things, based on reviews and our taste. I used: minced jar garlic instead of fresh, 2 pinches of cayenne pepper instead of roasted red peppers from jar, bottled grated Parm cheese, slightly less crushed red pepper (did not want overkill on spicy factor), linguine instead of spaghetti. At the end, I did not add any oil or additional marjoram to the pasta, but did use fresh shredded parm to top (yum!) I also only cooked half the meatballs (it's only me and hubby here eating), plan to freeze other half along with leftovers. We both really enjoyed it, but think it will be better leftover when the flavors have a chance to blend more. I will make again. One more thing--I have no idea why it has you go through putting the meatballs on a plastic lined baking sheet, nor why to put them on yet another sheet when you finish cooking them? I did the first one, but put them back in the bowl to chill (as did not have enough room in fridge for long baking sheet), and after cooking them (before adding to sauce), I put them in a bowl--did not seem to affect the outcome if you ask me :)

Love this recipe for meatballs. I often use a bit less bacon (12 slices total is a bit overkill) but think they could use a bit more garlic. Just be aware this recipe makes a heck of a lot of meatballs so make some room in the fridge for leftovers (although they won't last too long!)

I gave this recipe only 2 forks because it was too hot for even my spicy eaters to enjoy.I should not have added the required crushed red pepper. I spent quite a lot of time on this and no one could eat it!

I love these meatballs! Don't eat beef or pork so use ground dark turkey and turkey bacon and they turn out great. The red peppers keep them moist and the turkey bacon gives them a nice smokiness. It is a little heavy on bacon flavor but I just made more tomato sauce and added chopped fresh rosemary and that mellowed it. Next time will try with unsmoked turkey bacon.

When I'm thinking about alla'matriciana, I'm thinking something real chunky-like. This is not that. But it's still pretty excellent. The bacon-paste-in-the-meatball strategy is a good one- might try it in burgers or meatloaf in the future. As others noted, the sauce was a little thin, but a big ol' handful of grated parmesan remedied that. It was a nice change from the usual spaghetti and meatballs.

These meatballs are soooo yummy!!! My entire family ate them down in nothing flat. It was a great switch up to the same old speghetti and meatballs that we have all the time. I did have to amend the recipe to what I had in the pantry and the sauce was half the recipe half a jar b/c of that and no crushed red pepper b/c my girls hate hot spices (but a dash of cayanne) and no fresh herbs, sadly but next time they'll make it in. Also I didn't brown the meatballs in the bacon fat b/c I didn't have enough bacon to fry as well as put into the meatballs. Still hands down the best meatballs I've ever made.

Worth the extra work...very flavorful and even froze the extras for a later date. Didn't change a thing.

The meatballs are excellent, but I might put them in a different sauce. I found the bacon and red pepper too much. The second time I left the bacon out of the sauce altogether, and the flavor of the meatballs came through more fully. Crushed tomatoes are just fine too. Took about an hour.

Rating: 3
This was my first attempt at making meatballs and I see little reason to explore other recipes, these were a hit. I used bacon for the meatballs and pancetta for the sauce. I chopped the bacon fine with a knife instead of using food processor. I added a third egg. I used a small ice cream scooper to measure and make balls without handling too much. I was very short on time so I baked them at 375 for about 25 minutes, then deglazed the baking pans with wine and added it to the sauce.

I think I missed up on the sauce. It just wouldn't get thick enough. I don't really change peoples recipes when trying them for the first time.I don't know where I missed up. I'm sure it's great when made right

This Recipe was good in general, i used half italian sausage and half ground beef. Used full 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and then one can 14.5oz of diced tomatoes and did not blend in processer, why waste another step you get the same garlic and tomato taste anyway so i dont really understand why it was written that way. I missed the step for the red peppers when making my shopping list but those were omitted as well. But those were the only modifications I made. I dont really agree that this was too much bacon taste. the meatballs were easy and tender. I have to say the only down side I had to this was that it did take me about an hour start to finsh. Over all great dish. Would make again and again.

This was the last of the marathon of meatball recipes I tried. The Moroccan Beef Meatball Tagine was definitly the winner among them, but this one is a unique and good twist on the standard meatballs in tomato sauce! If you don't like bacon this is definitely not the recipe for you. Agree with many of the reviewers that these are a very loose meatball formula that tend to fall apart in the browning if not gently handled (be careful not to crowd).

Rating: 2
Definitely use pancetta in this recipe, you won't have the bacon flavor overcome everything else. It took forever to cook the meatballs, as I scraped out the pot after each batch to avoid burned bit. Took me 2 1/2 hours start to finish. The results were okay. Meatballs were not that fantastic, everyone really liked the sauce though. I used red wine instead of white and less onions.

Rating: 4
Loved it! It's my new "Spaghetti and Meatballs" receipt. I didn't have a lot of success sauteeing the meatballs and about half way through transfered them to a baking sheet and baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes. They held together better this way and since they are bathed in the sauce didn't loose anything visually.

I made this saturday for hubby's birthday party but substituted Jimmy Dean's ground sausage for the bacon. However I fried up the bacon and cooked the meatballs in the fat with olive oil as the recipe suggested. I then crunched up the bacon over the sauce. Added a little Italian seasonings, basil, anise, in the meatballs and the sauce. Cooking the meatballs in the bacon fat (horrors) imparted a nice flavor without quite as much fat. I liked using panko crumbs instead of breadcrumbs...made them more tender and they seemed to brown better.

Rating: 0
Well, I liked it a lot. It was certainly not "flat", and managed to be sensational even if the bacon was smoked as most american bacons are. Can't quite figure out what got everyone riled up with this recipe! We enjoyed it very much, and will be having it again and again as the house standard for spaghetti & meatballs. The bacon, cheese, red peppers all worked together for a wonderful winter meal.

Rating: 2
I thought the flavor was flat- it was just meat and bacon. I would have liked more herbs. Even my husband who is a bacon fanatic (and requested I make this dish in the first place) didn't care for it. He agreed with me, too much bacon, not enough of other flavors. I thought the pureed bacon made for an odd texture for the meatballs as well.

I am not sure what the title of the recipe means, but this was great! As for using bacon, my favorite Italian chefs (you know them all!) suggest bacon if Italian products are not readily available. I used "peppered bacon". Everyone loved it!

Shame on Bon Appetit for using bacon in this recipe. The original recipe calls for cured pig jowl and says use pancetta if you can't locate the cured pig jowl. The jowl is readily available in large urban areas eg N.Y.C, and pancetta anywhere. I have had fileto sauce made with bacon. E, Brown

Sometimes when I read the reviews of one of my favorite recipes I wonder if we're all cooking the same recipe? This has become my new go to meatball recipe. Made it last week with turkey as burgers. Delicious. It makes so much that I make as many meatballs as I need and shape the rest into meatloaf and freeze. I didn't have any of the burning issues other reviewers had. Maybe because I made fewer balls and cooked on medium heat? Fabulous sauce too!

Rating: 4
This seemed to me to be a lot of work, but it was worth it. The meatballs browned up without breaking up or sticking. I got really good bacon and I think it really aided the flavor. My husband was begging for the leftovers that made it to the freezer. I used 1.5 t red pepper and 1 t. red pepper and it had a bit of zing. Certainly go no lower, maybe more would be fine.

Rating: 4
My hubby thought this was the best meal I've ever made. I substituted regular breadcrumbs for the panko, and made a few meatballs with gluten free flour as well. Both worked very well. The sauce tasted way too spicy when I tasted it in the pot, but once you toss it with the pasta and meatballs this is perfect. One negative is how long it took to prep and cook the entire dish from start to finish. Next time, I will definitely do some prepping in advance.

Rating: 3
This recipe was good with a few modifications. Bake the meatballs in a 425 degree oven for 20 mins, turn all of them over, and bake another 15 minutes. Once you remove the bacon, continue with the recipe as if you had already fried the meatballs in the pan. (Be sure not to overcook the bacon). Cut the onion to two cups and the wine to one. Simmer the sauce a little longer than the recipe calls for to thicken it up and meld the flavors a bit more. This way it has good flavor, less grease and clingier sauce. Oh and clove from York, PA - the recipe has two eggs in the meatballs so I'm not sure what you're preaching about?

Awesome recipe - next time we will add less red pepper to meatballs (they really had a bite!). Also to save time consider broiling meatballs to brown and transfer drippings to pan instead of cooking in batches. Will make this again!

I make a version of this dish but use the techniques and ingredients I was taught in Italy. First, I use guanciale because it is not smoked as are most American bacons. Then, and MOST importantly, I add 2 eggs to the meatball mixture. That will keep them from falling apart when cooked in the sauce. Thirdly, I never serve the meatballs WITH the spaghetti. Spaghetti is the Primo course and the meatballs or "Polpettine") are the Scondo course. Make sure you use a reasonable amount of red pepper flakes or don't call the red sauce All'Amatriciana.

Turned out more like a meat sauce than meatballs. The balls stuck to the pan and then fell apart in the sauce. Tasted good but not spaghetti and meatballs.

Rating: 3
In spite of the fact that it was difficult to keep the meatballs from falling apart, and the burnt, black bits on the bottom of the pot by the time the meatballs were done had no place in the sauce, I thought the end result was pretty good and worth making again. Next time I'll try baking the meatballs and dicing the red peppers much more finely.

Super yummy. I halved the recipe, as it was just my husband and I. We were able to make 24 meatballs, and we were only able to eat four meatballs a piece. I didn't measure the amount of breadcrumbs, but I would assume I used close to a half-cup. The meatballs stuck to the bottom of the pan, but I also may have overcrowded the pan. I like my food spicy, so I didn't halve the pepper or garlic amounts. The sauce was't too spicy, and had a good flavor. It was a little thin, but most sauces for stringy pasta is supposed to be. I guess it would have thickened more if I simmered it longer.

I made this on a Sunday night since I figured it would take awhile. I made a few subs to fit in our diets. We don't drink wine so I used beef broth and left out the red peppers since we don't like them. Otherwise it was enjoyed by our tween daughter and ourselves. Will make again.

Wow! Best meatballs ever! My husband has made me promise to never use another meatball recipe! Minor substitutions: uncured hickory smoked bacon since the only uncured apple smoked also had cinnamon (which didn't sound like it would be a good fit); cut back on the red pepper, and my husband, who normally dumps chile picante over everything didn't even notice that it wasn't very hot. Leftovers the next night for meatball subs on ciabatta - really good!

I made this recipe for my mom last night. I followed the recipe exactly, but before I made the sauce,I scraped and wiped out the pan to remove the burned pieces. I also used organic, grass-fed hamburger and Nieman Ranch, uncured, apple-wood smoked bacon. I used a nice Sauvignon Blanc for the white wine. After simmering the meatballs for a half an hour the taste was wonderful. Not too spicy (but we love spicy food.) Even my one year granddaughter liked the meatballs. I served it with crusty bread for soaking up the juice and a lemony salad. I would definitely make this again.

This was delicious. I had not made meatballs for a long, long time and this recipe inspired me to try them again. I used some suggestions from reviewers with good results, like pureeing the red peppers and cutting down on the wine and the onions in the sauce. I also upped the panko to one cup as was suggested and happy I did, thank you. The sauce was excellent. My husband and son loved it! It was fun making this on a cold,snowy Sunday in January. I will absolutely make this again. Soon I hope!

I made this for a dinner party last night and everyone loved it, but I think it could have been a little better. I got 55 meatballs out of this so it took 3 batches to fry them all, and by the end the "browned" bits were closer to black. I think it had a bit of a burned taste from using the same oil that the meatballs were fried in for the sauce. I will try making it again but will fry the meatballs in a separate pot. Also, I tasted the sauce for seasoning before adding the meatballs and bacon and it was quite bland. I added a lot of salt and a little sugar but it was still bland...but after adding the bacon & meatballs and simmering for a while it was quite flavorful.

I loved this dish. Made it for a few friends who came over on New Years Day. Not spicy but really flavorful. Had to cook the sauce longer than the recipe called, but my friends were running late anyway, so it turned out perfect!! Only problem was the meatballs fell apart a bit in the sauteeing - maybe I'll bake them instead.

This is a great dish but as other comments have said the ingredients need to be altered. My complaints are way to hot spicy, meatballs fell apart while cooking, and sauce too watery. The changes to make are: Reduce dried crushed red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon, at most. On the roasted red peppers from the jar, squeeze all the water out that you can. The meatballs fell apart when sauteing. The meatball mixture needs needs better binding. Increase breadcrumbs to 1 cup (?). Cook meatballs in skillet so they can be turned more easily. We used 2 large skillets so it went faster. Use 1 cup of wine instead of 2 cups to make sauce thicker. I will make it again with these alterations.

One word describes this recipe NASTY. Watery sauce, bland no flavor except for the overwhelming heat from the red pepper flakes.

This recipe was one hot mess and I am being kind.I made it as written with the exception of using dried marjoram.It's a mystery how a sauce can be bland and yet be hot with the nauseating taste of too much onion. Grate the onion so it will integrate with the meat,really? and then put in diced red pepper that sticks out of the meatball making it look like some sort of beserk Christmas ornament. It seems like the only ones who liked this dish were the ones who didn't follow the recipe. They are very smart people!

Ok meatballs but my god that sauce is nasty. Thin, watery (even after adding tomato paste to try to thicken it up a bit), greasy like nobody's business and it tastes like barbecue sauce. I'll keep the meatballs and use my standard marinara. This is simply inedible.

Made on New Years Day. I liked it ok but the sauce was a little to spicy. Meatballs were great though. I think I will make the meatballs next time and use a standard marinara instead. I would also half the meatball recipe as it made more meat than my family of 4 needed. Not my favorite, but fun to make. It was a lot more time consuming than I thought but I'm ok with that! Happy New Year!

We have a monthly cook-off where my sdaughter, her boyfriend and I choose a recipe from the monthly issue of Bonappetit and subject the family to choosing the winning recipe. I chose this, they chose Lamb Kofte. I followed this exactly as written, with the inclusion from the reviewer who said 3 cups of onions were too much. (They would have been.) If anyone in your family is hankering for classic spaghetti & meatballs this is easy and elegant. Even in a chaotic kitchen I was done in 40 minutes. When I make it again, I think I will add Syrah wine instead of white, I like a little bit more flavor. Oh and puree the red pepper, or dice it extremely fine. Use a stainless steel spatula (why did I start with tongs?) and it will look just like the cover.

My husband made this last night for dinner. We halved the recipe & it still made enough for 3 meals for the two of us. There was a fair bit of work involved, but the results were worth it. He subbed cayenne for the red pepper flakes in the meat, which gave it a nice hint of heat. He also stepped up the garlic in both the meat & sauce. The biggest thing to be careful with is to be gentle with the meat & not over work it. Lovely flavor!

RUN, do not walk, to your kitchen, to make this recipe!!! Shoot, you probably already have everything you need in your pantry to make this tasty dish :) The meatballs were, in a word, heavenly. The inclusion of the roasted red peppers (I pureed the contents of one small jar of roasted red peppers, as I did not have time to roast my own) and bacon took them to the next level. I made a few small tweaks based on what I had on hand, which included using 1 teaspoon dried marjoram (not fresh), and I also only had 1 1/4 cups dry white wine, so I substituted dry sherry for the rest to add up to 2 cups. I also added 1 teaspoon each dried rosemary and dried oregano to the sauce mixture. The sauce tasted very fresh and light. I served it with liberal doses of grated parmesan, the saltiness of which helped cut the natural sweetness of the tomato sauce. In all, it was absolutely amazing! Be warned: I'm also glad I only used 1 teaspoon of dried red pepper flakes when cooking the sauce, because I thought the sauce was pretty darn zippy with just that (and I like spicy foods!). I think it would have been too spicy if I had used the full amount... remember, you can always add more spice, but you can't take it away so easily :)

Made this for Christams eve, and it was a huge hit. It's wonderful and very easy to make. I cut the recipe in half and that's plenty for four people. I roasted my own red bell pepper and didn't have enough fresh marjorum so I substituted italian seasoning in the meatballs only and no herbs or olive oil in the sauce. I also used ground sirloin to make it a little lighter. The meatballs were very moist and tender. One writer noted that they are not cooked through on browning, which is intentional in the recipe as you will finish them by simmering them in the sauce for 10-15 minutes. I also think you could omit the pasta and serve these on hoagie rolls with shredded mozarella for a great superbowl party sandwich!

I prepared this recipe and we agreed the meatballs are the BEST we've ever had! I didn't have marjoram on hand so used the same amount of Italian seasoning. I also baked them at 375 for about 45 minutes -- fabulous! This recipe would also make a terrific meatloaf, and incredibly decadent burgers.

I made the recipe as written except my local store did not have uncured bacon or marjoram so I used their best quality bacon and oregano. It was very time-consuming to make. My husband thought the sauce was very spicy (I disagreed) and I found the meatballs somewhat dry. However, our guests loved it and asked for the recipe. I will make it again with the correct bacon and maybe figure out some shortcuts.

Very good recipe...the only downside was that the sauce was too heavy on the onions. Don't get me wrong...I LOVE onions, but they overwhelmed the sauce. I will try it again, but cut the amount of onion in half. The meatballs were to die for. Can't go wrong with BACON!

I made this last night and LOVED it. I substituted the roasted peppers for sun dried tomatoes in the meatballs and they turned out great, added a bit of a sweet touch. The meatballs were flavorful and tender with a delicious crust on the outside, I didn't add any marjoram to the recipe at all because I didn't have any and it still turned out well. The recipe suggests to cook the meatballs for 9 minutes, but after 9 minutes they were still quite raw. I would suggest 11-12 minutes. I served this with pinot noir and a crusty loaf of rustic olive bread and it was fantastic!
