I marinate the cheese in brandy or cognac for at least an hour. Then cover it in flour. I find it much better tasting and of course do not forget the ouzo flambe!

I'm Greek and my favorite Greek dish to have when I visit is Saganaki. Dont listen to the review saying Pecorino Romano is no good, its easier to come by and also in my opinion the best Saganaki is made with Kefalotyri, and the highly salty taste of Pecorino Romano is much closer to that of Kefalotyri. Anyway this recipe turned out great and the only reason it didn't get 4 stars is because it set of the smoke alarm in my tiny apartment hahaha.

I made an error in the previous review, BRANDY is the best flambe liquour as Ouzo is a too sweet.

Do NOT use Pecorino Romano. I did as I could not find Kasseri cheese. It does not melt and is very salty and does not taste at all like 'real' saganaki. I have made this with Kasseri and it turns out perfectly. One key step that is missing from this recipe is to flambe the just fried cheese while still in the pan with a little ouzo and then douse the flames with the lemon juice - shouting "oopa" as you do it!

This dish must be served right off the pan. It cannot be made ahead. It is best to douse the melted cheese with Ouzo. flambe it and then douse it with lemon. I plan to make this tomorrow but thought I should answer the question below in case it was an urgent need to know.

Is it possible to fry the cheese ahead of time (say 1 hour?) or does it have to be served straight from the pan?

This was a big hit. Totally artery-clogging, of course. A non-stick pan and not too much oil worked best. I finished it off with Ouzo as suggested. Added cold artichokes and hummus to the platter. It was a party, but there wasn't much room left in our bellies for dinner!

Basic recipe, but you can use kefalotyri or haloumi instead of kasseri cheese for a more dynamic flavor. The flamed ouzo at the end is always a must, but you can also try some Metaxa as well.

This recipe is a great start. I prefer to use kefalotiri cheese. It melts better and has a better consistency in my opinion. I lightly brown both sides and make sure the cheese is melting. Then I flame with brandy or 151 proof rum and extinguish with lemon. Goes great with warm pitas, olive oil and fried zucchini.

I thought the recipe was very easy to duplicate, I had great results. The only thing I would change is the cooking time to 3 minutes a side.

Great recipe. Can you substitute Gruyee Cheese for the kasseri cheese? How about extending this recipe to include using brandy to flame the cheese and then use lemon to put out the flame?

I've made this recipe for a gourmet group dinner and twice more. It's so so simple and absolutely delish! Use the Kasseri cheese; feta is too salty. I also flame ouzo before serving. A must if your theme is Greek!

I was taught by a Greek chef that the Kasseri cheese was dipped in beaten egg prior to the flour, cooked until brown and runny (3-4 min), flamed with brandy, and then the flames were put out with the juice from fresh lemon wedges squeezed over the pan. I also prefer it with no other seasonings (really doesn't need any!) and served with a crusty bread.

Super easy, super good. I always flame with brandy. For the cook with trouble browning the cheese, I am guessing that you are not using hot enough a pan. It should sizzle when you add the cheese (flick in a drop of water to see if it bounces). 1 minute a side isn't enough and as with all things you are trying to brown, again make sure the pan & oil are hot, and don't move it around till you are ready to flip it. I'd do 3-4 minutes a side. I've always just dredged the cheese in flour w/o wetting it first.

I cannot seem to get this right... the outside starts to melt and the inside is still hard.. the crust doesnt form on the outside of it.... dont know what I am doing wrong. Please, any suggestions

I am a native Greek and although I haven't tried the specific recipe I make saganaki all the time. My suggestion is, instead of rinsing the cheese under water dip it in some beer and then put the flour. You can also add some paprika. I do not believe that one minute is enough time to brown your cheese and make a nice crust. You need at least 3-4 minutes.

This is a great appetizer. However, a Greek chief taught me how to make this many years ago and he told me the classic way to serve it was flamed with a shot of brandy. I have seen it done with Ouzo in the US or Greece.

A little variation on this recipe it to cut the cheese into cubes, dredge them ab all sides with flour and fresh ground black pepper. When they are browned, pour one oz of fresh lemon juice over the cheese and let it reduce almost completely. Then flambe with Metaxa Brandy. serve on grape leaves with grapes, olives and pita chips.

Fabulous for the little prep time it takes! A little ouzo sprinkled on top makes it extra special.

Worth the little bit of work it takes!
