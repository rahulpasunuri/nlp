Overall this was a fantastic dish, I've made it twice already. I made some changes as well. I also added more garlic and marinated the shrimp in the time it took me to cook the dish, about 20-30 min. I added some onion in the beginning with the garlic and I liked the sweetness it added with the heat. I used dried Thai red peppers because I couldn't find the other ones, and my dish was pretty spicy.

This was really good and easy. I used 1Tb of red pepper flakes instead of dried chilis and i doubled the garlic. It had a really nice kick to it.

Fantastic Recipe! I have made this several times over the last few months! We all love it.

Great recipe! I made it for the first time tonight and it was super easy and delicious. The only ingredient I couldn't find and had to substitute was the chile de arbol. My dish had only a hint of heat, and I would have preferred a little more. I agree with the other reviewers that the shrimp should be marinated for an hour -- it was really flavorful that way.

I give it 4 forks up. It was one of those great simple meals with a lot of flavor that will easily go into the rotation and become a favorite. I didn't make any substitutions - pretty straightforward recipe; didn't need to.

Easy, flavorful weeknight dish. Based on the reviews, I doubled the garlic and let the shrimp marinade for roughly an hour. Didn't have fresh parsley on hand and will try to be sure to include it next time as fresh herbs are the best. Putting this in the rotation!

Super easy and super tasty with just some toasted garlic bread on the side!

I just made this, following the recipe to the letter. It turned out great. Good flavor and easy to put together. I will be making it again. A very good weeknight meal.

I followed others' recommendations and doubled the garlic, marinated the shrimp for an hour or so in the recipe's ingredients along with a splash of lime juice and used Hungarian paprika rather than smoked due to lack of it in the spice cabinet. I also substituted a couple of pinches of crushed red pepper in place of the chiles. was good and received compliments from the family! will try again in the future with ingredients as written, but would definitely keep the increased garlic.

We really loved this - it was simple and delicious. I used crushed red pepper instead of the chiles (in a pinch) and it worked well. I will definitely be making this again, great for a weeknight dinner after work.

I doubled the garlic, added half an onion and 1/2 t smoked paprika to the beans, and used a mix of hominy and white beans. I doubled the chiles as the flavors didn't seep into the sauce so quickly, but I think one could sub crushed red pepper without any real loss of flavor. I also used dried white beans cooked in chicken broth which may help make the sauce a little richer. The end result is a paella-like dish of shrimp and beans that is perfect for a cozy meal. It was pretty easy and would be a great dinner party as the prep work can all be done ahead and just throw it under the broiler when guests walk in. The dish is so easy once the beans are cooked and so cozy I think it will be a keeper.

Loved it. Gave it four stars because besides being good, a friend cooked it for me.

Really liked it. Followed the recipe but I had to substitute a New Mexico chile ( which is pretty large) for the two Arbols, which I could not find. I removed seeds and stem. I also let the shrimp marinate for an hour or two, while I was preparing other courses. Loved it , as did my sweetie and our guest!

Wow, this was really tasty! I doubled the garlic and substituted crushed red pepper for the 2 dried chiles de arbol (don't even know what those are!). I would definitely make this again!!

Loved this. Added extra garlic per everyone's suggestion and purely by accident I had to let the shrimp sit in the paprika/garlic/olive oil mixture (also added a big squeeze of lime juice) for a couple hours and they came out *amazingly flavorful*, in contrast to some of the other reviews. One pot/pan meals are the best! This def goes into my monthly rotation!

Perfect for weeknight dinner. I used fire roasted canned tomatoes (all I had) and reduced the amount of stock as I used the juice from the tomatoes. Would make again.

I have never written a review....but this was fantastic! I added lots of extra garlic and I added a little bacon! This will be a keeper for sure at our house!

My 15 year old daughter and I loved it. We changed it a bit: no chiles, extra garlic in the first step, no bay leaf (didn't have one), and no smoked paprika(forgot to add, so ate it without but tried by sprinkling some on top. Found the smokiness to be overwhelming, and the flavor better without it). Surprisingly delicious.

Dissapointing. All the flavor is in the sauce-which is rather spicy.The shrimp and beans are blah. Maybe some crumbled bacon would help.

This was very simple and really good. My entire family enjoyed it.

Bought fresh shrimp from fish market. Followed recipe exactly. Used canned beans. That was my first mistake. They we're mushy and flavorless. Whole family was underwhelmed by what was suppose to be a special dinner. Everyone agreed it gets kicked out of recipe box. I have to add that it was a simple cook and I really liked the concept - the flavours just missed.

Made without any modifications and I thought it was so-so. Nothing offensive, but nothing special either. It just seemed too "dense" for our taste. Could really use some Spanish rice to lighten it up.

Was looking for something fast and easy, but tastey and this recipe was perfect. Delicious flavor, great comfort food. Only change was to use 1 tsp dried peperoncino pepper flakes and added a squeeze of lemon juice. If I made this for guests I would use extra-large (18-24 count) shrimp. My husband loved this, but suggested added a little bacon for more flavoring -- will give that a try, but the recipe is great without any changes.

This was phenomenal. I doubled the recipe so it took a little longer to reduce, but well worth the wait. Highly recommend this one!

yummy yummy yummy!!!! i added some lime juice, skipped the chiles (so my 2 yr old would eat it!), and added an extra garlic clove. fabulous!!! we served it with socca (chick-pea flatbread-- gluten free!)

This is simply terrific! Wonderful flavors that allow you to enjoy a taste of Spain in a richly satisfying dish that's a snap to make. They chiles bring heat and the tomatoes bring flavor to the beans. The Garlic Shrimp are not overpowering and the Smoked Paprika is a must. Fortunately, while Smoked Paprika used to be a fairly difficult spice to find, Trader Joe's now stocks it for just 1.99 ! I would recommend using larger than Medium Shrimp. I used Costco's 11-15 count size and they were superb. Bravo Bon Appetit!

This is a delicious and unique way to have shrimp and beans! I used 4 garlic cloves, and because my 9-year-old hates spicy food, I had to leave out the chiles. I used fresh heirloom tomatoes (though canned would be just as good I think), doubled the tomato paste, and did everything else as directed. You can easily add a third can of beans or serve this over rice. The result is a flavorful delight. Garlic bread is the perfect complement.
