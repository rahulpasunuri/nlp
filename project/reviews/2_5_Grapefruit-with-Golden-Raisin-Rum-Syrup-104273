This was really good over vanilla ice cream. Next time I'd leave out the raisins but the almonds are a must.

I made this around Thanksgiving when grapefruit was in season. I intended to serve it to guests as a morning eye-opener but it was consumed as an after-dinner treat when all the guests were gone. It is refreshing and I used the left-over syrup to devour with vanilla ice cream.
