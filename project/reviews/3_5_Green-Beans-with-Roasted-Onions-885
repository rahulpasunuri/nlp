The dish was very easy to make and delicious. The onions took only 6 minutes to bake in my oven- luckily I burned only the edges and was able to save the rest. My guests had seconds!

Yum Yum Yum....Made these for my dinner party last night. What a hit. Everyone RAVED about them. I used balsamic instead of red wine vinegar. I used "Texas Sweet" onions. Roasted onions at 375 as others suggested. Thanks....that was a great tip! This is definitely a winner and worth the effort.

Now, if only I could keep my brother from nibbling on the roasted onion sauce..... Have been making since first appearance and we love these beans! If desired, just cut back on sugar as suggested by others. Garlic is wonderful addition! Not Christmas without these beans!

I have made this dish every Thanksgiving for years and it is always a hit with all my guests. I follow the directios and it always turns out wonderfully and the onions can be done a day ahead and retain allthe flavor. Who would open a can of stale dried onions wehn this is so easy??

Rating: 4
I make this recipe all the time! I would agree with the comment made on the oven temp being around 325 as the onions will burn. I always use balsamic vinegar and I combine the green bens with the sauce for at least 5 minutes. This way they absorb some of the sauce and are amazing! I hate making green beans any other way now.

Rating: 3
I love this recipe..but I have read the reviews and made some of the suggested changes. I have a small oven so I have to reduce the temperature to 325 and go slowly. I also do not use as much butter..I put some olive oil on the onions and I too prefer balsamic vinegar....simple and good

This recipe was alot of work for a mediocre result. The roasting phase went on and on (not 30 minutes or so, as stated, in my case.) I liked the sauce but would consider for another use as it did not enhance the green beans in my view.

I have been making this recipe for Thanksgiving for years, with excellent results, just following the recipe. Can't imagine anyone not loving it. The delicious, caramelized onions combine so well with the turkey. Just be sure not to slice them too thinly or they will burn. This year I am going to add the sliced garlic to the onions when I roast them. Yum-O !

Used the helpful hints from prior reviewers (melting butter and adding garlic). Really enjoyed the dish.

Rating: 4
I've made this many times and have adujsted the recipe as I've gone along to suit my family's taste (and thanks to all the reviewers for help in this!). I put the cut onion in a bowl with 1 head of garlic, sliced. Then I melt the butter in a saucepan and add it to the bowl and toss. Then I spread it on the sheets. This makes it soo much easier. I lower the temperature to 375 and cook until mostly brown (I remove really burned ends). I've tried veggie broth - not yummy. I add only 1 tbsp of sugar, use balsamic instead of red wine vinegar, and have noticed that the flavor gets noticably better if I allow the sauce to reduce all the way down to 1/2 cup. I always make it a day in advance and just pop it in the microwave while I'm boiling the beans - and I only boil the beans about 3 minutes because we love super crisp beans. Last thing - I throw the cooked beans and the sauce in a big bowl and toss them - this ensures that the beans at the bottom of the bowl have sauce on them as well as the ones at the top. I get raves on this every time I make it!!

Rating: 2
To me, this recipe is seriously over-rated. I loved the onion part, but it just didn't seem to meld that well with the green beans--could hardly taste anything BUT onion mix. I made a big batch for Thanksgiving dinner for 14 and it was the only thing we had left-overs of. LOTS of leftovers.

Rating: 4
Maybe the best green beans ever, Be sure the onions are really deeply carmelized and the sauce is reduced to the level mentioned in the recipe.

Rating: 3
It seems to me that this dish would be better if you just boiled the green beans in the sauce rather than in a separate pot of water. It seemed disjointed to me-like I just randomly took some roasted onions and threw them on top of some green beans.

I roasted brussels sprouts instead of using green beans, and they were perfect with the strong flavors of the onion. Delicious!! Also used balsamic vinegar.

Very good. I used french green beans as another reviewer suggested. They were excellent! I also browned the onions on the skillet instead of in the oven. That worked out really well. Will do this again.

I made these for a party and everyone raved about them and I was asked for the recipe many times. They are wonderful and so simple. I made the onions the night before and it took no time at all to whip them together for a party of 25. I doubled the recipe. Terrific!!!!

I combined this with the "green beans and roasted squash" recipe also on this site. Too fabulous. The roasted squash makes this dish come alive. I substituted sherry for red wine vinegar in the sauce. Also, roasted the onions and beans in a little olive oil (instead of butter or non-stick spray), to match how the squash was roasted. Served in an oblong dish with squash on one side, beans on the other (both just drizzled with a little sauce), then drained onions in the middle. Too fabulous.

So simple & delicious. I use balsamic & cut back on the sugar. Always a favorite at Thanksgiving (anytime, really). I'd like to add some toasted nuts next time (maybe pine nuts, almonds, or walnuts, depending on what else is being served).

This dish, with minor adjustments, has become a Thanksgiving tradition in our home. For my vegetarian offspring I substitute vegetable broth for the chicken, and we prefer the sauce made with balsamic vinegar. We always double it to guarantee leftovers and guests invariably ask for the recipe.

If you love onions like my family does, this dish will be a hit.

The chicken broth does not have to be reduced as much as indicated -- this only makes it more salty. Reducing it to 1 cup is plenty (add more vinegar and sugar, accordingly). I also slowly sauteed the onions in a large skillet on the stovetop rather than in the oven. Only other note of improvement is to add a cornstarch slurry to the sauce to thicken it up; that way the green beans are nicely glazed with the sauce. A really yummy dish.

Made this both for Thanksgiving and for my book group. All attendees loved it and asked for the recipe. It's easy to make and easily halved (or 2/3). Don't be afraid to make the onion topping the day before, refrigerate, then heat (even in microwave) when the beans are ready. Really tasty.

I was really dissapointed with this dish. There were so many rave reviews about it and I guess the person who wrote a review before me was also looking for a Thanksgiving dish. I thought the sauce was too sweet even though I cut the sugar down. I also thought the roasted onions did nothing but stink up my kitchen and they were not that great and I LOVE onions which is why I made this. I also had lots of leftovers. GROSS!

Rating: 1
I didn't care for this dish. The onions weren't as good as in other roasted onion dishes I have made, and the vinegar sauce didn't seem to go very well with Thanksgiving dinner. Sorry to say, the leftovers are still sitting in my fridge, untouched. I won't be making this again.

I really loved the onions and sauce for this dish. Wow! Cooking them was a whole lot of fun -- the kitchen smelled wonderful. However, I made this dish for Thanksgiving and didn't feel that it went with the rest of the meal. Maybe it was the balsamic vinegar that I used instead of wine vinegar. I would pair this veggie up with beef and/or portobello mushrooms instead. The onions and sauce alone would be fantastic served over a steak. Mmmm!

I thought this was great, but I guess my expectations were a little too high as it wasn't the earth-shattering experience several of the other reviewers had noted. It was indeed very good, and the onion mixture is quite tasty, but I certainly won't make it an entertaining or holiday staple.

WOW! I did mess up the wedges & stirred them every 10 minutes. At 450, I let them go for 45 minutes. Perfect! I cooked frozen beans & added everything including toasted almonds the day before serving. Brought to room temp. WOW! It is going to be my bean recipe of the summer!

Rating: 2
I thought that it was good, but was not as wowed as other revewiers. I roasted the onions at 400 and they did not get done--had to turn it up to 450 and they were blackened at the edges but seemed more steamed than roasted--if I had to do it again, I'd not roast them whole but rather take them apart so more surface area was exposed so they could brown better...I realized after reviewing the recipe here that I was probably meant to do so, and misread the recipe to say that I should slice the onions through (like an onion blossom) yet leave them whole. So I will try it again the *right* way! The sauce *was* tasty, though.

The onions really enhance the green beans and make this recipe special and memorable. I took this to a dinner with a bunch of friends last week and got lots of compliments. I am thinking about adding it to my list of exceptionally good "company" recipes. When Vidalia onion season starts here in Georgia I will use them but for this first attempt I used a sweet onion from Chile. Also, I cut the sugar back by about half. I used regular green beans and had to cook them a little more than 5 minutes. Be sure to use a rimmed cookie sheet to roast the onions...the liquid spilling from the roasting onions made a huge mess in my oven!

WOW. This was delicious. And...so easy. I will gladly make this dish again and again. I made this with the recipe for chicken breasts with parsley pan gravy and tiny potatoes with lemon & parsley...yum yum yum. The whole meal took no time to cook. This is a keeper.

I made this for a luncheon recently and got rave reviews. The onions are to-die-for! You can do lots with the wonderful onions alone. In my oven,450 degrees was too hot, though. I cut the temp down to 400 degrees and the time to about 28 minutes for the onions to roast. Try this one!

Made it last week-end and plan to repeat it this week-end. I really dig this. Thanks for the hints on cutting down the sugar. Was yummy! If you decide to make it I hope you enjoy as I much as our group did. Monitor the onions - you can remove as need be from the oven. I had read the caution on reducing sixe and cutting oven temp; tried it with not much success. Follow the leader here.

Used regular green beans for this recipe. Turned out pretty good. As another reader suggested used 350 degree oven temperature for grilling the onions but this did not turn out right. I had to cook much longer and eventually turned the temperature upto 450. But this was a pretty good recipe.

Rating: 4
These beans were so good they passed the "leftover" test. In our house I usually consume ninety percent of the leftovers, because the others don't necessarily care for them. However, the competition was intense for these beans even on the second day. In our family, that is a sign of a keeper recipe.

Really, really yummy -- however, if you're cooking for fewer than the recipe calls for (the recipe is for 12 people) then you should adjust and reduce the roasting time/temp for the onions. I halved the quantities since it was for just a few people, and most of my onions were burned black. I was able to salvage some of them, and it turned out alright after all. This side dish was the most delicious part of my Christmas meal, in my opinion, and I will definitely make it again. Just have to remember to reduce the oven temp and roasting time for the onions!

An easy wonderful way to prepare green beans. Next time I will reduce the sugar by 1 TBS., as they were just a little too sweet for my taste. The red wine vinegar blends well and doesn't stand out in the flavors. I prepared these on Christmas with a prime rib, all my guests loved them!

Every Thanksgiving I try a new vegetable recipe hoping that someday one will be so good that it will become part of the tradition. This recipe hit the mark. Everybody loved it! Obviously, the onion sauce is what makes it. I used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine, but that is just because I prefer balsamic. I put some leftover sauce on baked potatoes with a dab of sour cream the next night. Incredible! I can't wait to make just the sauce again. I think it would also be good over steak or chops.

Very, very good - and easy. I also over-roasted the onions, but the sauce did make up for the problem. They seem to start burning very quickly in the end, and it's hard to distinguish between "dark brown" and "black" sometimes... I was in a crunch, so I had to use frozen green beans. Had I used fresh, I probably would have given the recipe four forks. Will definately make this again soon!

I took this dish to a New Years Eve dinner party . It got raves. It is beautiful to look at, the beans retain their green and the onions in the vinegar sauce are purple. It is sweet and savory at the same time and the soft buttery texture of the onions and the crispness of the bean are a wonderful contrast.

I cut the recipe in half and was very happy with the results. I used balsalmic vinegar, because I like the taste. I also found that 450 degrees was a bit to high to roast the onions without burning them a bit. So, I roasted them at 350, and extended the roasting time. This is a dish I would definitely make again.

I also covered the cookie sheets with aluminum foil for easy clean-up after roasting the onions. Word of caution: for a dinner like Thanksgiving this recipe made way too much for a crowd of 18 (even though the recipe says it serves 12). Remember that people take a little of everything at Thanksgiving!

We made this dish for my husbands 40th birthday and thought it was so good, we served again the next day for Thanksgiving. Everyone just loved it. It is also very easy to prepare. I added a bit of fresh thyme to the viniger sauce.

It is hard to destroy vegetables but this recipe gave it a good try!

a hit at thanksgiving dinner with v. picky eaters and a great make-ahead dish. the onions were browned in 15mins instead of the recommended 25mins. this one's a keeper.

This was the hit of our Thanksgiving dinner! I cut the onions to 4. And made 2 pounds of beans.

Okay, what did I do wrong?? Cooking the onions, most were back as opposed to dark brown, too crisp or overcooked.

I too made this for Thanksgiving for the first time ,can't wait to make it again soon. I prepared it in two steps like others said and it was easy with every thing else that is pulled together at the last minute on Thanksgiving. Sent my son home with the remaining. Really a great dish.

Yummy. Made it yesterday for Thanksgiving, and everyone raved. For once, the veggie didn't get ignored in favor of the sweet potatoes.

Seemed lacking, but maybe that's because I forgot the butter. It was, however, very popular.

We've made this over sveral Thanksgivings. People usualy ignore vegetable in the face of so many other, more tempting dishes on Thanksgiving. These stringbeans have always been a hit, and usualy get finished.

The onions are divine. I'm not crazy about beans, but the onions make them more than palatable

I have made this recipe many times since I found it a few years ago. It has always been great! It has become a traditional dish on my Thanksgiving table.

I've made this several times and it has always been delicious. One time I ran out of red wine vinegar so I used balsamic vinegar. I think it was better!

For a while, I was making or bringing this to every dinner party we held or went to. I could just sit and eat the onions! There isn't a thing I would change to this recipe. It's never failed me.

Loved this dish. We cooked up the onions one day in advance and just reheated. It turned out great very easy and tasty. We will probably do just the onion's with mushrooms over steaks next time. You will really enjoy this one.

I added a few butter toasted almonds to the top. But the recipe stands alone. A freguently requested family favorite

This is a really good side dish. I think it would better to say onions w/ green beans. I have made this twice & the type of onion & beans make the difference. Careful not to over cook the onions!

We made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving 2 years ago and it is now a family favourite. Even those who think they don't like green beans, ask for seconds of this wonderful recipe.

This recipe was sublime. A very delicious treatment of green beans. The fragrance of the buttery roasted onions was in itself incredible and mouthwatering. Very yummy. Definitely recommend this!

I served it with the Roasted Garlic and Horseradish crusted Prime Rib and Parmesan scalloped potatoes, and it was fabulous. I definitely will make this again. I added a touch more sugar since I like things and the sweeter side.

This dish has become a family favorite. I have served it twice to company and they loved it too. In fact, one guest from out of town returned a year later saying he thinks often of these beans and the turkey with hazel nut butter (another Bon Appetit recipe) we ate that Thankgiving. I roast the onions and make the sauce the night before serving this so the final preparation isn't that much work -- in fact it's quite easy.

This recipe was given to me with rave reviews by my mom, and I tried it for the first time on company! It was a huge success, and they want the recipe. Anyone would love green beans prepared like this!

Flavor was good, but the prep time was too long to make it really worthwhile.

Great flavor, but onions should be crisp. Following the recipe, the onions were limp.
