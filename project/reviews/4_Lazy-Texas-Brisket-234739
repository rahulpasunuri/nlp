I took a big shortcut and used a premade rub, so I'm really only reviewing the technique -- which was great! This was effortless. I think this will become my "go to" brisket recipe.

A keeper.

OMG this was unbelievably easy and sooo good and tender. I used some pretty expensive grass fed beef and hpped for the best - it exceeded all expectations. This is now my go to recipe - oh I didn't use the sauce since I have one we like.

Made this today following the recommendation to cook for 8hrs at 250. I used a 3lb brisket. It was sealed in HD foil & I rather expected it to be dry but it was very moist & just fell apart - no way to slice it! The rub was great. I didn't make the sauce. Next time I'll up the sugar in the rub or add brown sugar, probably double the rub & add apple juice halfway through. Then reduce the apple juice/rub liquid for a sauce. Very easy for what it produced!

Very good! I skipped the red pepper and used 3 lbs of meat. I set the oven to 250 and cooked it for maybe 8 hours or so. I also skipped the bbq sauce.

question - I've never made a barbecued brisket. How would you suggest serving it? Sliced and eaten with a knife and fork? Sliced (or shredded?) on a roll and eaten like a sandwich? Sorry to be so clueless - would love advice & suggestions.

so easy and amazingly good

The original recipe in the magazine called for using a 250° oven and cooking the brisket for 8 hours. This insures that the meat will be tender.

Very good and very easy. I couldn't find the BBQ sauce recommended, but found other sauce that was equally delicious. I cooked the meat slow and long... didn't need a knife as it was so tender.

Made this for my British friends for a supper party and they loved it and asked for the recipe. Very easy to make - just put it in the oven. Must have the sauce with it to pass around....served it with cornbread and fixings. Yum

I thought this was good. I grew up in Texas and while it certainly isn't a true smoked brisket, it satisfied my craving given that I dont' have access to a grill. I did not like the sauce though - too vinegary.

Lives up to its name...really easy to make. The meat was very tender and tasty but the flavor of the spice rub didn't penetrate the meat as deeply as I thought it would.

This was so easy, and the meat was incredibly moist and tender. I reduced the heat to 300 and cooked the brisket for 3 1/2 to 4 hours and it was just perfect. To be honest, I skipped the sauce because we don't care for vinegary sauce. Instead, I placed sliced onions on the foil, added 1/2 cup beef stock, and placed the meat on top before sealing the foil pouch. The onions softened during cooking and created a wonderful sauce-topping that I poured over the sliced brisket.

I made this for a picnic in 1982 and have been making it ever since. It is alway delicious and my most requested dish at family parties. The Bronc Buster barbecue sauce is a crucial element and equally delicious.

I've been preparing this recipe, since the 80's. One of my biggest hits, even without the sauce.

This a is perfect recipe for a large group. We make this every summer at our lakehouse. Throw it in the oven, go out on the boat. And come back to a perfect meal.

Meat was nothing special. The sauce is terrific!

Meat came out very tender and flavourful. Pleased with the spice rub and how much interest it gave the meat. I would not make the sauce again, preferring to substitute for something with less vinegar.

I grew up in Texas in a family where the men always made great brisket, but this was my first. It was very simple to make and came out beautifully. I really soaked the meat in the pan juices and barbecue sauce when serving, and it was nice and moist. I used Powdrell's barbecue sauce (from a local BBQ place) instead of the Broncbuster's, but it sounds like real Texas BBQ sauce, and I'll make it next time.

This recipe was delicious! It was simple and quick. The juice the brisket made was so flavorful, and the brisket was tender. I will definitely make this my only brisket recipe. I didn't have time for the Broncbuster's Barbecue Sauce, but will try it soon.

My family loves this dish, I make it just as called for, the meat has never been dry and the sauce is awesome. My 14 yr. old son requests it weekly.

Absolutely delicious; rave reviews. I used a 7 lb. brisket. You don't have to use these spices; one of the cool cajun rubs or other spice mixtures works and is much faster! Also, I checked the internal temp after 2.5 hrs and it was done, tender and juicy. The sauce is addictive; truly the best BBQ I've had. My kids and hubby want me to make it every week!

Both the brisket and sauce were delicious. I used a boneless chuck roast and it was wonderful. I shredded it with a fork when it was done and added the sauce immediately to make BBQ beef for sandwiches - but it would have been great alone - very juicy. I used a smaller roast (2.5 lbs) and still used the full amount of spices/seasonings because I wanted lots of flavor.

I also felt the meat was dry, but did taste better with the bbq sauce. BBQ sauce was just mediocre for me, nothing special. While the brisket was good did not love it enough to make again.

This is a keeper! I omitted the cumin in the spice rub and cooked it in my crockpot with a small amount of water which created a nice juice to drizzle over the sliced meat to serve ~

This is the first time I've cooked a beef brisket, and the results were fabulous, especially when accompanied by the Bronchbuster BBQ Sauce. Had I know how easy this was, I would have added it to my go-to list a long time ago. Thanks Epicurious.

Followed directions exactly. Juices apparently leaked to the bottom of the brisket, leaving the meat relatively dry and forming a crust at the bottom that was so tough it couldn't be cut. Am wondering about cooking the meat and the barbecue sauce together in a slow cooker, since I've had success with another recipe done this way, though not in barbecue sauce. At any rate, this was edible but doesn't bear cooking again.

I have been making this since it was published in 1982 and love it. The barbeque sauce is wonderful too. This is a great dish to take to pot lucks or picnics since it is excellant at room temperature. The leftovers are good as sandwiches with the sauce. I am glad to see it in your database of recipes.

this was wonderful. I made it for 4 adults and 2 children, and they all loved it. I am making it for the holiday. I did use more spices than the recipe called for.
