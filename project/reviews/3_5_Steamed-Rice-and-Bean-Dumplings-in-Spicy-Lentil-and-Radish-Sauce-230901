This sauce was delicious - especially the first night I made it. I also made the dumplings (wow what a feat!) and loved them, but preferred them on their own with sesame oil, as the recipe says, rather than in this sauce. The sauce I will love over some rice, or even noodles. I didn't have sambaar powder so searched online and easily found a recipe for it. Would not have thought I would like radishes in this but it was great!

As a South Indian who was brought up on Idly Sambar, I find this threcipe ridiculous, esp the sambar. My suggestion to any one intending to try this is - DONT!
