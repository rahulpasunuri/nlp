The rice had little texture, and the curry taste was overwhelming. Perhaps I did something wrong (curry mixtures vary by manufacturer) but this didn't do it for us.

I thought this sounded weird, but I had a bag of frozen limas to use up and thought what the hey. This is not weird at all, it's delicious. The rice and beans, tomato topping and garlic yogurt come together beautifully, and the salad also looks just gorgeous. Perfect for summer. This one is going in the rotation for sure.

My hubby and I love salads and needing to use canned lima beans I gave this a try. OH MY GOODNESS. I knew it was a success when I heard the sounds he was making while eating it. This one is a keeper and will be added to our repetoire.

After picking up some lima beans from the local farmers market, I made this dish for supper. I used a spicy curry powder which was a good fold to the garlic yogurt. The rice picks up the juices from the tomato/onion topping. This would be a nice potluck dish.

Good vegetarian recipe: Especially for lima lovers.

I loved this dish. It was delicious, different and easy. If you like curry dishes you will like this. Be careful on how much garlic you add to the yogurt. Also I made a mistake and used regular yogurt instead of lowfat however it made it taste really rich and yummy. This is a great summer dish.
