Wonderful in the Butternut Squash Soup. Just perfect. I had to up the red pepper flakes to get some heat & it was sublime.

I roasted my own peppers and added roasted eggplant in addition. It came out just a little on the 'soft' side, not as dense as I might have liked. I would have added some Romano or Parmesan cheese for bulk (maybe) but have a guest coming who cannot eat dairy. Even so, the flavor was awesome. Serving this in addition to pesto, hummus and flat bread as accompaniments with the Sausage, bean and kale soup I made last night. Yummers.

I followed the recipe exactly and the red pepper pure was fine but the soup was not edible.

I made this 2 years ago to the recipe and has been a demanded item since! It accomodates the vegetarians and satisfies the meatetarians!

This is so simple and wonderful. I roasted red peppers in the oven instead of using pre-made. Makes a great condiment on hamburgers, especially veggie burgers. Great in squash soup.

Outstanding flavor and a crowd pleaser! A soup with easy to find ingredients,(I used chicken broth) few steps to put it together, ready in an hour and a half, and even better the next day. What more could I want?
