I followed this recipe exactly. It was absolutely, hands down, the best ice cream recipe I've ever made. It was so smooth and creamy. Amazing! I'm making it again 48 hours later to give away to friends.

Super delicious! I cut out the chilling time by doing an immersion bath (small bowl in a larger bowl filled with water and ice). I stirred it for about ten minutes or until it's temperature was near my fridges temp. This allowed me to almost immediately transfer the batch to my ice cream maker and not worry about waiting around for it to chill. I'm planning on serving it with an ounce of Cream Sherry and fresh nutmeg on top.

Made this with egg substitue, so I didn't have to cook the egg yolks and it turned out wonderful. Everybody loved it, nice and creamy.

A Big HIT for Christmas. I hate eggnog and even I couldn't resist this rich and silky ice cream. I served it with a Spiced Rum Sauce at the bottom of a small bowl (about a 1 1/2 tsp) and it was a nice compliment to this desert. Would make this again.

Oh is this good! I used less rum (maybe a tablespoon total) because I was making it for kids and well, it's just not the holidays yet! Loved this ice cream and I'm about to make it again. Rich, creamy, perfect.

This ice cream is delicious and tastes just like frozen egg nog (and who doesn't like that?!) I even used some skim milk and decreased the egg slightly, and it was still fabulous and froze with no problem. To increase the eggnog flavor, I added extra ground nutmeg and ground cloves. Yummy!

This was awfully rich so I did tinker with it and it still came out great. Used only half the whipping cream and doubled the milk and used 3 whole eggs + 1 yolk instead of 7 yolks. Lovely in profiteroles too!

Rich and delicious. My Christmas guests devoured it, including a few who said they didn't care for eggnog.

Wonderful, custard-y and eggnogg-y ice cream. Followed instructions except for measuring nutmeg and the taste was wonderful. Used chicken-fresh egg yolks, which resulted in a beautiful golden color.

Great ice cream, I've already made this twice. It is a very soft ice cream, even after two days in my 0 degree freezer it was not the usual rock hard consistency. Because this is such a soft ice cream I suggest you chill very thoroughly in the freezer before putting it into your ice cream maker. I also made the hot buttered rum sauce found with the other eggnog recipe on this site. It was OK nothing to rave about.

Great recipe, however, I find it just as easy to pour your favorite store-bought egg nog in to the ice-cream maker. It works! I swear!

Made the ice cream and the sauce. Both are great. The ice cream can stand on its own, though. Very rich and creamy. Delicious.

This was a hit. Half of the first batch was gone before the holiday party!

This is an excellent ice cream recipe. It is very creamy (and stays creamy in the freezer) and has a very nice balance of flavors.

Great recipe and easy to make! I made this for a holiday party and everyone, even the people who claimed not to like eggnog loved this.
