Good but I thought it was slightly dry. I would add a little more purchased salsa to the red salsa next time and maybe some lime juice to the green salsa.

Beautiful and tasty. Recommend using only 1 can of black beans and 1 1/2 cups rice to fill the standard size trifle bowl sold by Williams-Sonoma

This recipe was a huge hit at my grandfather's birthday party. Plenty of food for everyone, and the fresh tomatillos add a great crispy flavor.

Pretty to look at but not substantial/hearty enough for my family's taste.

This salad was fantastic and a big hit at our office Christmas party. I used canned tomatillos and it worked out great. The only problem I had was that the water quantity for the rice was too much - I only used a 4 1/2 cups. I had to throw the first batch out - too mushy.

Great dish for a hot summer day. Even making half of a recipe, it still feeds a bunch. I use salsa verde in place of the green salsa -- watch out, it comes in mild and very hot versions. Also replace basil with cilantro and cooked rice in stock. Drained low-fat yoghurt is a good replacement for the sour cream.

My dinner guests went nuts over this salad! It is so pretty and tasted phenominal! It took quite a bit of time to make...but it was definitely worth the effort. If you use a food processor to chop the veggies it will cut down on the prep time. I wonder if you could replace the tomatillos with a purchased green salsa (salsa verde) to cut down the prep time even more... I followed the recipe with a few exceptions: I used chicken stock instead of water for cooking the rice. and I used cilantro ONLY when the recipe called for basil or parsley. It did not overpower the dish at all. The salad easily serves 10 - 12 people. Try it...you won't be disapointed

I took this salad to an office Cinco De Mayo potluck and it was a smash hit; everyone raved about it. It looks good and tastes good. And I've shared it with at least 20 others since, who have shared, etc. The only suggestion I have is to drain excess juice from the salsas because it soaks downward into the rice.

This recipe is really pretty and great to take to a party as it makes quite a bit. I added more salsa (1 1/2 cups) and used cillantro instead of the parsley when making the red salsa.

This salad is always really well received at parties. It looks great and everyone, even picky eaters love it. It has been the vegetarian entree at work luncheons too. I do use a little more red salsa (11/2 cups), but otherwise no changes!
