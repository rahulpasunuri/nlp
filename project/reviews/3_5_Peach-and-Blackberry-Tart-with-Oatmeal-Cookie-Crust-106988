Love this recipe!! I make it all the time for work and family parties. Everyone raves about it. I use a slightly larger tart pan and need to double the filling. I think it's key to let the pie filling cool completely and also to let it set for at least 6 hours. I usually try to make it the night before and bring it up to room temperature in the morning. I think it is easy to make and looks beautiful on the table!!

This recipe came out terribly because the cornstarch never made the filling thick enough. I even added more after I found that the tart was just a soupy mixture with peach chunks in it. Gelatin or agar-agar would have been a much better idea. I used trader joe's pistachio cookies (1 tub) for the crust and that was good but the tart itself, though somewhat tasty, was a frustrating failure in texture and presentation, since it just oozed all over the plate once serve and was a huge waste of time and ingredients. I think this recipe was NOT tested and Epicurious is now publishing UN-tested recipes which is a real shame!

Wonderful! Amazing flavor and it set up perfectly. I let the "custard" bubble away in the saucepan for a few minutes, stirring constantly, and then chilled it for a good 8 hours. This is so easy to make and delicious.

This tart was delicious and presented beautifully. No drips and the crust was perfect. I did change the recipe however to suit what I had in the cupboard. I didn't have any apricot juice but I did have some old dried apricots. I boiled those on the stove for awhile, then added about 1/4 cup of sugar to them. I also used arrowroot instead of cornstarch. It set in the fridge in less than 3 hours. I used homemade coookies (from the Quaker Oats can)for the crust. The flavor was delicious and was wonderful with Breyer's vanilla.

just not that good. crust did not really form and so pieces were falling apart, due to crust. Had wonderful peaches and felt there are much better recipes out there, would not make again.

I served this at a dinner party and it won rave reviews. It's not too sweet, and beautiful if you have good peaches. If not, you can cook all the peaches for the filling. I added 1/8 cup of minced hazelnuts to the crust (which you can chill in less than 30 minutes in the refrigerator to speed prep time). You can also chill the filling and have it ready to serve in less than 2 hours. A dollop of whipped cream for the dairy fans won't go amiss either.

I couldn't find apricot nectar so I used apricot jelly instead, the flavor is a bit overpowering but it helps the peaches set up perfectly. I imagine that if I were to use the nectar I would use more cornstarch.

I wouldn't make THIS version again. Too messy. I changed the lemon juice to orange juice. I added 1/2 tsp. orange peel and 1/4 tsp.of ground ginger.I deleted the sugar completely because the necter is very sweet already. I also deleted the cornstarch. I took about 1/8 cup of the necter and sprinkled 1 tsp.unflavored gelatin on top to disolve. In the mean time I simmered the remaining necter and OJ, orange peel,and ginger to reduce it slightly. Allow this to cool somewhat before stirring in the gelatin mixture and the remaining peaches. Spread evenly in the crust and then chill several hours. This sets up nicely and tastes MUCH better.

i'm a chef at a major hotel in seattle and i serve a version of this to acclaim reviews at this time of year with yakima valley peaches and western cascade blackberries. i use apricot nappage which is different from apricot nectar and i think that maybe the author used the wrong word. mine always turns out divine................

After hearing that this recipe was wet I omitted the nectar. I purreed 2/3rds of the peaches and mixed that with the sugar and corn starch. I then added the remaining fruit. I also used Hob Nob's, although I would not use as many, It made the crust quite thick. In all a rustic, easy dessert.

Absolutely delicious--the flavors are perfect, especially when the peaches are in their prime. I used HobNob oatmeal cookies--delicious crust. My only complaint is that the crust went from soggy to soggier as it set out. After an hour or so, my guests were shoving it in their mouths before it could crumble! But all thought it was delicious!

This dessert is a real crowd pleaser, not to mention easy to make. Here in Georgia we are always looking for new peach recipies and this is my current favorite!

This was a great summer dessert. I didn't find it to be too runny, although the filling was soft. I would definitely make it again- it was delicious!

The crust was good but the filling was runny. Too dissapointing. My guests said the flavor was great but I was embarrassed by the runny filling spilling out all over the place. Proceed with caution.

This was delicious, but it was a big mess. It looked beautiful in the pan, but even after refrigerating for over 10 hours, when I cut it, it became an upside-down peach crisp. I mashed the right amount of peaches, but the rest I sliced, and arranged in a spiral with a half peach in the center, but I doubt that had anything to do with the consistency. The flavors were so wonderful - I sprinkled cinnamon over the crust after baking, and garnished with defrosted frozen blackberries. But I just don't see how this thing could set. I cooked it on the stove longer than suggested trying to thicken in the fear that it would be too runny, but it was hopeless. Everyone loved the taste, but don't serve this to company if you want them to be impressed by the presentation. P.S. For those wondering about how many cookies to use, 2 cups equals about 21 cookies that are 2 1/2" in diameter, or 9.7 oz. Also, only need 3 medium peaches.

I really enjoyed this and the best part is that all you have to bake is the crust! I used a previous suggestion and added some tapioca to the the peach mixture prior to heating up on the stove and the texture came out very nice. I also used a tart pan and used blueberries on the top.

Yes, would make again because it's so easy to make and a nice summer dessert. The only thing I would do differently are: (1) buy cookies that are not too dark, because when you bake it, it will only get darker (I used "Mothers" cookies and found that not only are they too dark, they are also too sweet) . Also check the crust at 7 minutes. I found the temp to be too high, and yes, I always use an oven thermometer. (2) use good quality sweet peaches---like what you would find at the farmers market; otherwise, add more sugar if your peaches are not sweet. (3) I used one additional tsp of cornstarch and had no problems with my filling being too runny. (4) Allow at least 6 hours to set for better results. Also added a touch of cinnamon and replaced half of the granulated sugar with light brown sugar, as recommended by previous reviewers. I sprinkled fresh blueberries on top and served w/whipped cream.

A tart for a picture perfect presentation. Wonderful served with whipped cream and extra backberries. The taste/texture is wonderful when refrigerated long enough.

i was alittle disappointed in this as i was looking for a tart and this would make a great pie with the cinnamon and tapoica i added. i used nectarines and blackberries which were a good combo...filling was just not what i'll fill my tart pan with next time.

This was excellent. I added some cinnamon and vanilla. After 6 hrs of refrigeration it seemed set, but when sliced did not hold together as well as I would like. Next time I will add one or two tsps. of tapioca to see if it corrects the problem. The crust, of course, is what makes this !

A beautiful, relatively healthy dessert! I made it in a 9 in tart pan and it came out perfectly. 32 cookies was way too much though.

A refreshing, light dessert for hot summer days! Sweet, fresh fruit definitely improves the quality of the tart and the crust is addictive. Taking the advice of other cooks, I substituted blueberries for the blackberries and the result was delicious. I also added brown sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon (I like things sweet). After ten minutes, my crust was burnt, but that may be my wacky oven. Despite a burnt crust, my roommate and I gobbled the tart up.

In reply to the post below - apricot nectar is apricot juice, any grocery store that carries Hansen's products should have it. Look in the juice aisle.

I was wondering, what is apricot nectar and where can it be purchased? Thanks,

Fantastic recipe and very easy to make, my guests thought I must have picked the peaches off a tree that morning. The crust was a major hit.

I used nectarines instead of peaches. It was fantastic, and my guests all wanted seconds. I served it with softly whipped cream...

I would recommend making the peach filling a day in advance. I was rushing to try and get it all done and felt like we did not refrigerate the tart long enough (4.5 hrs). I would make the crust and filling in advance and combine the rest of the ingredients the day you want to serve. Then refrigerate for a couple hours> It was phenomenal on the 2nd day however!

I made this for my husband two friends and we were so full after dinner (we all had a really late lunch) that we never got to try it. We were leaving the next morning to go out of town so I gave the untouched tart to another friend who served it to guests and everyone loved it and wanted the recipe. I can't personally review the quality/flavor but I can say that it was very easy to prepare. I WILL be making it again.

An excellent way to serve peaches that's a bit more elegant than peach cobbler. I had to doctor my peaches a bit with vanilla, brown sugar, peach schnapps, and cinnamon (I'm from the south, where peaches are AMAZING this time of year, and so far the New Jersey peaches available at the greenmarkets up here just aren't cutting it, but maybe I'm a little too early), but other than that this is an incredibly easy, pretty pie. I used a regular springform pan rather than tart pan. It probably would have been prettier in a tart pan, but sometimes you've just got to use what you have...

This was yummy! The oatmeal cookie crust was quite distinctive, and no one could guess what it was made of. I used blueberries instead of blackberries, and everyone asked for seconds!
