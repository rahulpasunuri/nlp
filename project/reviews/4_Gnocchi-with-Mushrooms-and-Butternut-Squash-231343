We loved this- my variation: twice the butternut squash, no gnocchi, sautéed half box of firm tofu with mushrooms and served over full plate of warmed arugula. Lovely vegetarian!

The only problem that I have with this recipe is that its not healthy;too much butter and using a healthier butter substitute would not give it the flavor. Having said that, the flavors were fantastic and even my husband, who is difficult to please really liked this. I used my recipe for gnocchi using ricotta, flour and egg, then added the herbs.....very good! I agree with others, that this is not a quick weeknight meal, but if you have the time; try it!

Great. This may be become a regular. Used store bought gnocchi and more sage, skipped the parsley. So. Good.

I made a half-recipe (there were just two of us). After the gnocchi was made (I used the linked recipe), it was probably a 45min-1hr endeavour. The only thing is I would cut back on the salt in the mushrooms. It was waaaayyyy too salty! Next time I'll just sprinkle some on from my salt grinder instead of following the recipe's suggestion.

This is just divine! It is my husband's new favorite meal. It does take a lot of hands-on prep and cooking time, which makes it a huge time suck. But the flavors are so amazing that it's worth it for a special occasion. Not a weeknight, throw- together supper though.

@ A Cook from MN. For the gnocchi recipe, simply click on the words "Herb Gnocchi" on the ingredient list included in this recipe. This will take you to Thomas Keller's recipe for the gnocchi, also on Epicurious. You'll note that these cross references always have a slightly altered font...that's how you know that they are a link.

Great, but where's the recipe for the gnocchi?

Think this makes way more than 4 servings. Really nice flavors. Used as a side dish and alternate vegetarian entrée for a dinner party. Big hit with everyone.

This dish provided a great combination of flavors but was just a little bit too rich to be a main dish. The balance of savory and tarness of lemon worked very well and the ingredients provided a great excuse to use farmer's market butternut squash and mushrooms. However, we thought the starchiness of the squash and the gnocchi was a bit too much together. In addition every step of the recipe start with butter or oil which added to the richness of the dish and in the end made it all a bit too much. We would make this again but as a side to roast poultry for a special meal.

I still can't get over this dish. I used what ever herbs I had available for the gnocchi. I doubled the chives, a little fresh oregano, some rosemary, parsley and substituted dried tarragon. I used a gallon ziplock bag and snipped the corner instead of a pastry bag. I had some roasted duck legs in my fridge. So I used the duck fat to cook the squash and mushrooms. I picked the meat off the bones and tossed it in the pan with the squash and mushrooms, last minute. It was to die for!

Wow- got rave reviews by my dinner guests! Perfect for fall. Made exactly as directed with the exception of the mushroom quantity- used less as the shitakes were expensive this week. No one noticed however. Time consuming but way worth the investment! I made the gnocchi ahead of time- just put on the iTunes and it was a very relaxing Sunday morning. I will be making this again!

Made this for my boyfriend who does not like squash or mushrooms, and it was a success! He loved it & wants me to make it again. I didn't make the gnocchi, but maybe next time. The dish is rustic and very hearty.

Great, easy, simple recipe! I topped with parmesan and crushed toasted walnut as well. I used store bought gnocchi as I didn't have the time to make them from scratch. I used Cucina Fresca in the refrigerated section and they were delicious. I highly recommend this recipe for a dinner party for make ahead and ease of preparation and taste. Quick and delicious!

This was just outstanding! While time consuming, the end product was delectable. I messed with the herbs a bit in the gnocchi --couldn't find chevril fresh and hate tarragon, so I just left them out-- but the result was just great. For the amount of gnocchi used, I found that there was too much of the mushroom-squash mixture, but not to worry...just use it with the leftover gnocchi.

This was one of those veggie combos you could not stop enjoying. Yes ... it was that good. "Heavenly", best describes it. My better half said, "Honey, this is the best vegetable I have ever eaten".

I didn't have all the spices available so I substituted; thyme for rosemary, shallots for red onions + chopped garlic. I'm allergic to sage so that was out of the question. The tweaked outcome was extremely savory.

Just tried this recipe, which I found when trying to decide how to use some butternut squash from a friend's garden. Delicious! We used store-bought gnocchi, but did everything else as described. The flavors were amazing together. Here is how it looked... http://flickr.com/photos/hilabean/3094931376/

Excellent recipe! I used smart balance light butter and regular italian gnochi and it came out amazing! I have already passed this on to several friends.

The flavors were all really incredible, however I felt the dish was too greasy even after adding the lemon. I will make it again, just with a lot less butter and oil. The gnocchi itself is awesome. I wish I had gotten to try this when I ate at Bouchon is Las Vegas, but we had a fixed menu. The best recipe that I have made of his is the roast chicken and potato puree.

My husband and I were excited to find a use for the abundance of chervil and other fresh herbs in our garden. We followed the recipe to the letter, but found that it only turned out okay, not amazing. Perhaps our expectations were too high given the long preparation time and the celebrity chef. We agree with the reviewer from Switzerland that the texture of the butternut squash doesn't work all that well with the gnocchi. We will plan on experimenting with a cream, pea, and pancetta sauce with the leftover gnocchi. We agree with other reviewers that a cream sauce might make more sense than the vegetables in the original recipe, although the lemon in the sauce does have the advantage of cutting through the considerable amounts of butter used throughout the recipe. We're not sure if we'll make this recipe again.

The gnocchi were excellent, light and airy, though they were a bit time-consuming to make. Herbs were wonderful. The mustard didn't have much bite, though, but that may have been because our jar was already a few months old. Only thing I didn't love was the sauce. Flavors were great, but somehow the textures didn't work together for me. The vegetables were too heavy. Next time I will cut the mushrooms into smaller pieces and even consider pureeing some of the vegetables into a sauce.

I used another gnocchi recipe (Mario Batali) but the mushrooms from this recipe are FABULOUS! I can't recommend them highly enough. They are amazing and will make anything taste fantastic.

The gnocchi recipe came out more doughy than I had ever expected. Would not be making this again.

This recipe took a lot of time -- I spent several hours making and parboiling the gnocci -- but it was absolutely wonderful! And the gnocci freeze well so at least the most time consuming part can be done well in advance.

The gnocchi is a lot of work, but this is the most delicious dish I have ever prepared.

An unbelievable and easy sauce that compliments this well is a walnut sage cream sauce. Start with butter and a small amount of flour in a saute pan to make a rue. Add a couple of table spoons of brown sugar and a handful of crushed walnuts. Stir until carmelized. Wisk in cream and steap the sage leaves for a few minutes. Remove sage leaves and pour over gnocchi. This sauce is incredible and only takes a few minutes!

An excellent dish, though to compliment the winter flavors, I think a cream sauce works much better than the zesty lemon sauce. Also, rosemary works better than sage for flavoring.

We have made this over and over again. The gnocchi are heaven and this compliments it perfectly!

This was fantastic, though time-consuming. I made the recipe almost exactly as directed (I left out the chervil). The flavor of the gnocchi themselves is exceptional; however, I did not think the squash contributed much to to the recipe. Would make with mushrooms and herbed brown butter alone next time. Incidentally, I just had this dish at Bouchon and was given a tip by our server. Refrigerate the gnocchi on a baking sheet overnight (not touching each other, uncovered) so they develop a "skin". This makes sauteeing easier the following day.

Sounds great. However, the gnocchi recipe is gone. Can someone email it to me at kdunn4@nc.rr.com? Thanks! (I gave the recipe 4 forks because I didn't want this note to drive the average down.)

Delicious. The sauce was simple, yet robust. The gnocchi were light and fluffy. I usually make potato gnocchi, but from now on I'm going to use this technique.

We had this dish for an early Valentine meal and it was perfect. Subtle and rustic, my husband said it was better than any restaurant we've been in. And I used Trader Joes' gnocchi...next time I'll make the herbed recipe. Wonderful!! Make this dish!!

I made them twice, adding some purée soubise the first time. And when you heat them in the micro-wave from the refrigerator,they get bigger end lighter. It is really great! Thank you for renewing this traditional recipe.

Time consuming, but well worth it. I followed the recipe and was rewarded with a wonderfully flavorful dish. My husband complimented the meal several times, as did my picky 15 yr. old daughter! We discussed trying the remaining gnocchi with a different sauce but agreed that the purpose here is not to mask the wonderful taste of these little gems, but to enhance with the conrasting taste of the vegetable mixture. A tip on making the gnocchi - I didn't have a 5/8 pastry tip so I used a heavy 1 qt. zip-lock bag with a hole in one corner. Take his advice on having a tall pan next to the pot of boiling water.

This recipe is incredible. I much prefer these gnocchi to the Italian potato dumplings. All of the flavors come together perfectly. The brown butter is very interesting with the adding of the lemon at the end. The combination of greyure, mustard and tarragon in the gnocchi is good enough to stand on its own with a simple sauce and none of the vegetables. I will make again soon but with a gorgonzola cream sauce.

if i use store bought gnocchi (the vacume sealed kind), do i need to poach it first? or just straight from the container.

The flavors come together perfectly in this dish. Would make an excellent vegetarian entree. It is also quite attractive. I will make it again for company. I didn't change any ingredients but I did pre-cook the squash a little bit in the microwave. It may not have been necessary. Do watch the skillet, however, the sauteed gnocchi and squash brown faster than you might think.
