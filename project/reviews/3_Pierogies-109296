Pierogi are my favorite Polish dish. I am Czech but spent several summers in the Polish town of Krakow. The dough is easy to make; it´s just like pasta dough. I prefer a sweet version though. They are really yummy filled with blueberries.....Never miss the opportunity to have them! :)

This recipe is an easy version of an extremely dynamic food. "Russian" pierogies typically have some sort of potato filling, which is otherwise uncommon in most of Poland. Polish pierogies are typically filled with cabbage, onion, sauerkraut, mushroom, pork, or even sausage in every combination. What truly sets Traditional Polish pierogies apart from Russian ones, as well as this recipe, is the outer shell. A traditional recipe will create a softer texture, with more flavor. The dough is extremely difficult to work with, and can require years of practice to master. What to look for: a darker color in the shell. The outside should be smooth, while the inside noticeably softer. Lastly, if small droplets of oil form on the surface, you know you have a good recipe.

As a kid I remember my immigrant grandmother from Czeckoslovakia make a batch of pierogi. Her filling was very simple: potato, cheddar, and tumeric. I've made them myself and it's the tumeric that really flavors this recipe.

I'm sorry but I didn't care for these at all. In Bialystok where I'm from we use sour cream in the dough and a variety of fillings, but never cheddar. I gave the recipe a fair chance but I have to say that this one reminds me of the American version you could easily pick up in any freezer section in the supermarket and save yourself the work if these are to your taste.

this recipe is not as rich or as tasty as it should be. Pierogi dough made with sour cream is the best, and I agree with other reviewers, cheddar cheese would never be used in Europe for this recipe. Our Lithuanian family recipe uses sour cream in the dough and the filling is mashed potato with salt, pepper, garlic and cream cheese. (Cream cheese was a new treat for my grandmother when she came to the US in 1912 and found it easier to use that farmer's cheese which is quite hard. After the pierogi are formed and cooked (in boiling water). They should then be sauteed in butter and diced salt pork, and served with sour cream.

I was looking forward to making this dish with my sister as it is coming down to autumn and was feeling squirrly and needed some comfort food. We doubled the recipe and followed the directions to a turn. What a fussy, fiddly, waste of time and enthusiasm!! The dough was unworkable and although the filling was nice it is now sitting in my freezer waiting for inspiration to hit.

Dad was Polish, Mom a Czech. Dad died. A Friday meal was Peirogi with potato and cheddar as the main dish. These were slathered in butter with dill weed. Dessert was more pierogi with lekvar. These were coated with browned buttered bread crumbs. These claims about which is authentic or not are crap. Each area had their own style as do other ethnic classes on food. There is no one way - there is however that way you enjoy them most. I would agree that trying to stay as authentic as possible is better than Americanizing such dishes.

You don´t have to be polish to know about pierogies. man i have eaten my share of them, and i can say that this recipie was great! easy to fallow!!! turned out just like the photo!!!! thanks! and by the way, it´s okay that this recipie didn´t turn out like all your grandmothers, cuase it does not have to be the same, change is good!!!!!!!! if you want it to be like your grandmas, then ask her to give you the recipie, but accept this one for what it is. good! yummy! and easy! p.s. i can´t find cheddar en buenos aires, for get about white cheddar, so i used provolone, and it was great!

Highly Americanized, and while the cheddar cheese is ok (my grandmother would turn over in her grave), I prefer the original ones I've been making with my mother. A few things, "pierogi" is already plural in Polish, so to me it's a bit funny when people say pierogies. Like dumplingses, lol. It's better to use farmer's cheese that's been placed in a towel so the excess water can drip away to prevent soggy pierogi. Also use some fried onions in the potato filling, and LOTS of pepper, no nutmeg, that just tastes weird to me. Also, for the dough, as the other reviewers said, no egg white, and hot water is a must. I mean after boiling water wait two minutes, pour into the flour, and start mixing with a fork like you mean it, then when it's lukewarm add the egg yolk. My mom does this complicated thing where she adds the egg with the hot water but doesn't scramble the egg. I have no idea how she does it. She also makes hundreds at a time, which to me seems crazy until I'm the one a week later poking around in the freezer wishing I had some, even though I live in Poland and could just walk to any store and buy them. There's just something really special about my mother's pierogi.

The dough was one of the simplest "pasta-type" doughs I have ever made and worked with. The simple flavors make this such a comforting dish. The recipe created pierogies as good as I've had anywhere, and they were quite fun to make.

To A Cook: Not very polite on your part to call something gross just because you wouldn't enjoy it. And the health issue taken to an extreme can be quite silly. Would you suggest Americans stop eating ribs? Or hamburger? Hot dogs? Just as "gross", isn't it? This site is not devoted to "health foods" and bacon police is not welcome in every home. If YOU do not like something, don't eat it - but please stay out of other people's traditional dishes.

@kotbury, A Cook and the reviewer from Australia :) I am STILL in Poland and yes, we do use mashed potatoes in pierogi, but mixed with farmer cheese (plus some fried onions and pepper). They are, indeed, called "ruskie" and - cooked properly - are the best thing under the sun. Not bland at all. The secret is to use good farmer cheese with a sour note to it - not an easy thing to find in the U.S. Oh, and forget the cream on top - the thing to use is bacon fat.

My own Polish grandma used to just buy the things at a Polish shop and pass them off as her own cooking, only we tiny children, snoopy as we were, privy to the ruse. I still store buy my own, from a small shop, and after pan-frying in butter or bacon fat with onions, no one knows the difference. Except one Dad, who was sworn to secrecy after I served them on game day and he asked for the recipe!

I was also born and raised in Poland and I often had potato pierogies. They are as popular as those with other fillings, e.g., fruit, sauerkraut and mushroom, etc., They're called "ruskie" (Russian), I think the receipe was originally from Russia. In any case, they are popular in Poland, it all depends what region you're from.

I've not tried this recipe either but it is very different from what I grew up eating. My Polish grandmother would make 3 different fillings--potatoe with a little cottage cheese added (I'm guessing that got started as a cheaper alternative to farmer's cheese), ground beef with mushrooms and onion (everyone's favorite!) and sauerkraut which also contained a little cottage cheese in it. I'm calling my mother for the recipe right now. Reading all this has me in the mood for them.

Have not tried this recipe to date. Just wanted to comment that my Russian grandmother made these and for the filling she used the sharpest cheese. She would also grate an onion on a box grater and fry it in a little butter and add it to the potato / cheese mixture. Some people commented that the filling was not flavorful. Try this.

I was born and raised in Poland and never heard of pierogies with potato filing. We use a lot of different fillings like farmer cheese, sour craft and mushrooms, blackberry, strawberry and many others but never potato.

I've had pierogies many times and loved them so decided to give this a shot, but I found that the inside was not nearly cheesy enough for cheese-loving me. Also, the consistency of boiled dough is kind of gross (especially since I had it too thick, I think), but I found that frying in oil after cooking helped make the outside pleasantly crispy.

The dough receipe was perfect! However the mashed potatoes needed more of a flavor and felt kind of bland against the pasta. I would use butter and sour cream or maybe a sharper tasting cheese to add some flare to the dish.

Hi, my parents were from eastern Europe. I used to eat these things and all varieties I thought were bland - apologies to all. However, if the magic "parsnip" grew in Ukraine I bet you the people would use it as Australians do in their traditional "pastie". Modeled on the same principle as the vareniki but baked instead of boiled, and parsnips, carrots, onions etc instead of the usual suspects of cabbabage, fried onion and potatoe etc. I think the trick with all of them is a generous dollop of course black pepper. What about you, what do you think?

Workable, but the pierogi/vareniki dough is better. First, the pierogi/vareniki recipe uses salt so it is not bland. Second, it uses cake flour so gluten is reduced - it rolls out easier and does not toughen when the scraps are rolled out a second time.

I felt so accomplished after making these. Though they were really a lot simpler to make than I anticipated. My husband and I made these together and our verdict was that these were better than the ones that his Polish grandmother makes. Shh, don't tell her!

Pierogies, Pyrohy as my Mom called them, I have been trying to master these delicacies for my family as although I grew up in a family that made these frequently, I hated them!! In my quest for that prefect dough recipe, since my Mom is deceased, I have found that every one of my relatives makes the dough different, whether it has to be only lukewarm water, to cold water, to including sour cream, to adding whole egg, to only egg white, or no eggs, to letting the dough sit for a couple of hours, to kneading. No wonder it is so difficult to master! So what is the secret? I think its the correct mix of liquid to flour, and having the patience to try to learn what that is! This takes practice and lots of it to learn this skill and doing them once a year like I do certainly doesnt help me!!!

Fantastic recipe! I accidently used 2T oil in the dough rather than 2t, but the dough was perfectly elastic and rolled paper thin so I will be sure to repeat that mistake. We also added diced browned onions to the potato filling and served with brown butter.

I didn't make the recipe. I make my Ukrainian mother in law's recipe that calls for farmer cheese and american cheese instead of cheddar. I'm willing to bet that I would like these, though. I can understand that the Polish lady who was mad about recipes being "Americanized" was frustrated, however, if she is so unhappy with the Polish recipes that she sees, why does she look on American websites? Doesn't make sense.

I agree with the previous reviewer - these are bland and not very good at all. Yes, I am Polish and have eaten "real" traditional Polish perogies made by my Polish grandmother and these do not compare. That is not to say they are to be dissed just because they are not the "real" Polish perogy. They are to be dissed just because they suck and are bland. I suggest using unripened farmer's cheese in the filling in addition to the cheddar cheese (by the way, cheddar cheese has never been sold in Poland...I have never ever seen it there when I lived there or since I've been back). The "real" Polish perogy would omit the cheddar cheese entirely BUT would definitely add fried onion to the filling. Other suggestions would be to use only egg yolks in the dough (whites toughen it, as noted by another reviewer) and use warm water - makes the dough easier to work with. Boiling then frying is a must. Serve with diced cooked bacon and fried onion. BTW, you wouldn't fry the onion in butter but in bacon fat. You can also use this dough and fill it with stone fruits or berries with a bit of sugar - boil and serve with sweet cream poured over top.

These were not very good...the filling is bland and it isn't authentic tasting and the onions swim in butter. My babci used to use farmers cheese as well as a sharper cheese and she would fry an onion to add some flavor to the potatoes (leeks or shallots would work fine in the modern day). I would suggest others to do the same...as I will do that when I make them again. Otherwise, I think it is cool everyone is debating who is more eastern european...if you are going to go thru the trouble of actually making these, I say everyone is a Pole for a day (or a Russian or a Slovak or whatever you want to be...).

I'm on the board with the past two reviewers. This is a great recipe, I also grew up in Winnipeg (4th generation diehard ukranian family so I know pierogies) I live in the Southwest now where you wouldn't think this comfort food is desired. Little did I know when I was feeling nostagic for some eastern european homecooking and came across this recipe. I have made this recipe of pierogies for all my other northern friends who relocated to live in this neck of the woods (or tumbleweeds for that matter). Sorry Mrs. Z. that you feel your idea of a widely regional traditonal food has been blasphemised, but by the mmmmmm's and ahhhhh's of my loved ones and friends who ate the pieroiges I made, many from who come from russian, ukrainian, polish, and even hungarian backgrounds have nevee had a single complaint about the "americanization" of this. to sum it up a great recipe and i will be using to make a traditional ukranian (and russian and polish) easter dinner!

A note about Polish & Russian, in this case what seem to be Ukranian...and Czech pierogies....they are ALL SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT !!! My grandmother was from Austria-Hungary. (The new Czech.) Her pierogies were somewhat different from the Ukranian style that everyone made when I lived in Winnipeg, Canada, where there are thousands of folks of Ukranian heritage. The family next door in Winnipeg was a Polish wife & a Ukranian husband, first generation Canadians. The pierogies she made were almost exactly like this recipe....Russian style. The Polish lady who dissed this recipe forgot that each ethnic group has variations of recipes, and this recipe IS NOT Polish, nor does it pretend to be. Frankly, I like the Ukranian version a bit better that my grandmother's as the onions, fried in butter till they are quite brown, make a great accompanyment. Also, the Canadian Uke's always had sour cream on the side too. Absolutely great! Now I'm hungry for pierogies!!!

These pierogi are a joke. They are not even close to being authentic! I am Polish and am quite shocked every time I see a "Polish" recipe on any American website. These recipes are so Americanized that they no longer taste close to the real thing. It is amazing that people feel free to take such liberties with Polish recipes when it would be unthinkable to Americanize a recipe for a tarte tatin.

Having learned from my Ukrainian "Baba" never add egg white to the dough only the yolk. Egg whites toughen it.

This recipe works but instead of adding a cup of water I add an extra large egg. I find this makes the dough lighter. Also, I usually boil, dry and then freeze. They are the perfect comfort food.

Jusst a cultural note -- while pierogies are Polish, the Russians do eat a similar dish called Vareniki (actually Ukrainian in origin) - which are like pierogies, but smaller in size and more round. Pelmeni - which are similar in size to Vareniki - but filled with a ground meat -- are the most Russian.

This is an old family dish, now on its 4th generation. We cook in tandem: one to roll, one to fill and cook. We do the potato mixture but also fill with fruit: half an Italian plum with a bit of sugar and cinnamon, a few blueberries tossed with sugar and cinnamon, a few sour cherries with a bit of sugar and lemon juice. We follow a boil-fry lightly in bacon fat-bake with chopped bacon process. Make ahead and freeze -- and then serve with sour cream. For us, peroghies are so special they're the entire meal; the peroghie fans love it when someone passes on them for a steak! Enjoy --

This is a great recipe. I prefer to brown the boiled perogies in butter with the onions. The crispness is a delicious contrast to the wonderful potato filling. Adding some jalapeno to the filling and deep frying the boiled perogies is another variation I love. You definitely want to make the filling a day ahead if you try that, to allow the flavors to meld.
