I used chicken stock instead of water and added cumin to the mix. Didn't really pay attention to measurements for yogurt etc., went more by taste and it was delicious!

Just a comment to the previous person, next time try omitting the mint, use creme fraiche instead of the yogurt and saute the veggies in butter instead of oil. Maybe adding a little fresh basil would be nice too.
