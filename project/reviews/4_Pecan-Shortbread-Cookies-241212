these pecans are fairly adult cookies, meaning they are barely as sweet as graham crackers. the toasted pecans make these cookies, i used nuts from my neighbor's family in georgia - they were awesome! i pressed these cookies 1/4" thick, lowered the oven temperature to 325, and baked for 15mins. we have a professional type oven, and that was still too hot for this cookie, because the edges and bottom of the cookie were quite dark, while the centers were barely set. however, this is a great cookie to bring to a cookie swap as it's a nice savory change from your standard sugar cookie.

I love these pecan shortbread cookies, but I would reduce the butter to 1 1/2 sticks, there was a buttery residue on your tongue after eating them with 2 sticks. The flavor is fabulous and the consistency is perfect. Enjoy these with coffee, tea or a glass of milk.

I made these for my Christmas cookie exchange. The cookie is deliciously buttery and rich, yet very light considering the amount of butter in them. The first batch I made burned at the bottom and I had to remove them from the oven before the recommended 20 minutes baking time. For the next batch, I turned down the oven to 300 degrees and watched them very carefully. They were perfectly crisp and golden. I would definitely make these again; they were a big hit, but I would keep the oven low at 300 instead of the 350.

LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!It is absolutely delicious, I didn't have brown sugar so used all raw sugar.It turned out to be the best shortbread ever!!!Also I've made it not as a regular cookie I did Russian popular treat called "oreshki" or "nuts", you bake cookie half's in a form of pecan's for that you will need special mold and then you fill them with "dulce de leche" (take sweetened condensed milk in a can and boil it for 3 hours make sure it is always covered with water or it will blow up!!!)Then put two half's together and enjoy!!!!

These are luscious! Very rich, and full of pecan flavor. I used my trusty KitchenAid hand mixer instead of a fork, but was careful not to overmix. The cookies couldn't have been more tender. Well worth the effort to make them.

I make these as almond shortbread cookies, substituting the pecans for blanched, then toasted almonds, reserving a whole one for the top. They keep beautifully for up to a month -- providing you don't raid them every day.

These were delicious! I made them as the recipe states, but instead of baking them with the pecan half on top, I baked them plain. When they cooled a bit, I put a dollop of Nutella hazelnut cream on the bottom of each pecan half and "glued" them to the top of each cookie. My family loved them.

Probably the best shortbread I've ever tasted. Toasting the pecans creates a great flavor. Watch these while baking- - the high amount of fat in the batter and the potential for nuts to burn because of their fat content can pose a problem if you don't watch the baking time.

I liked this recipe. Not too sweet. A bit crumbly. Perhaps could use more butter. They are cute and make nice treats for your friends.

I made these cookies and they are absolutely delicious! I only had a cup of pecans, so I didn't top the cookies. I do think they need something on top to make them prettier, but they are incredibly tasty. Will be perfect with coffee. A few notes.. 20 minutes is way too long.. it took 12 in our oven. Definitely chill the cookies before rolling them into balls. I had to chill them again after they were in balls because they stuck to the glass and destroyed the cookie.

Inspired by a wonderful brown butter pecan ice cream, I browned half the butter and cooled it until just solid before doing the rest of the recipe. I also used Trader Joe's roasted chopped and salted pecans but cut down on the salt in the recipe. The teens love this cookie. Because I froze them before using, I also only used a cup of pecans and skipped topping the cookies with the pecan half because they just end up falling off when stored.

Dough needs to be chilled before forming, for sure. VERY tasty and easy, easy, easy.

Made twice: first as written, with pecans, and the next time with almonds and only 1/2 teaspoon salt. Liked 'em better with less salt and baked for less time (13-14 minutes seems ideal for the size given).

I was excited to try these cookies but I found them not sweet enough and too salty by half. There are much better recipes on this site.

Great cookie! Not overly sweet. Perfect for tea or coffee. 36 cookies are definately possible if you keep the size to a true 1-1 1/2 inch.

A great cookie. The cooking time as noted by several previous reviewers is precisely whats required at SEA LEVEL. Up here in the mountains though, 20 minutes is just about right.

Very nice cookie and very easy to make. As most of the other reviewers said 12-15 mins is about right.

Very nice cookie. I guess I made them slightly smaller than 1" balls so I ended up with 53 cookies. Also I think 20 minutes is way too long, check at 12 mins, 15 is almost too much.

Made this twice. The first time, I read the recipe wrong and added only 3/4 cup flour. The second time, I added the 1-3/4 cups that the recipe calls for. The first batch was much better. I think the next time I make it, I will try adding 1 cup of flour.

Great tasting, but 20 minutes cooking time IS TOO LONG. I pulled mine out at 15 minutes and they were still a little browner than I would have liked. I suggest a 12-15 minute range. Oh, I also added a dollop of melted chocolate on top of the cookie. Delicious&.

Very easy. My cookies were perfect after 17 minutes - I suggest checking them after 15 minutes to prevent them from becoming too golden.

Fabulous and so easy. I made full recipe and it made 35 cookies (contrary to BMills who halved it and got only 10 cookies).

I halved this recipe, and it made 10 delicious cookies, so I don't know how making the full recipe would have made 3 dozen. I would definitely make these again
