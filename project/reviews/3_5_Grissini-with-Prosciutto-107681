These were okay. . took some practice to get the right butter/cheese/arugula ratio. Great presentation but not a huge hit with my guests.

These are good and look nice. If you use butter, make sure it's very soft. I used softened Boursin cheese and then rolled the grissini in fresh grated parm. Had no problem with the prosciutto sticking, but made sure I had it sliced thin, so that probably helped. Guests enjoyed them.

Attractive, fast and easily made at the last minute for drop in guests. I found it helpful to also spread a bit of the butter on one side of the prosciutto, sprinkle the cheese on THAT and then roll onto lightly buttered grissini. I skipped the arugula ... it wasn't missed.

I made these for a cocktail party and they were terrific! They look just fabulous - the presentation is the really special part. It takes a bit of effort not to break the grissini and to get the parm to stick, though the fridge time definitely helps everything stay together. Fabulous and easy, a great addition to any hors d'eouvres party.

I make these without the butter, cheese and arugula. I do the sticks and the prosciuotto. My family loves them, as do teh kids. Simple taste of grissini and ham...lovely, easy and yummy. I have my guests make them while we chat.

It was ok. I made it for a family celebration. Only my mom seemed to like it, and I'm not sure if she was doing that because she really liked it or because she didn't want to make me feel bad (or waste the prosciutto!) The parm didn't stick to the butter - maybe that's why it wasn't so spectacular for me. The grissini broke easily, but there were more than enough in one box for the recipe, even with breakage. It was so very easy I'll probably make it again though.

This was very easy, looked so elegant, tasty and definitely impressed our guests! I would make this again, no question. Make sure you buy a couple of boxes of Grissini though since half of the ones in the boxees i bought were broken. Also, buy more meat than you think you'll need because the thin slices (the thinner cut the stickier, which is what you want here) tend to tear when you are separating them from one another.

They cost too much too make but they were beautiful. I used cold, semi-hard olive oil instead of butter. I won't make it again because it was too distinctive and everyone will remember.

I'd make it again, but it's not a ground shaker. It is what it says: prosciutto wrapped around a breadstick!

I just made this recipe last night, and Wow was it ever great! I don't normally enjoy preparing appetizers as they seem so "fiddly" for so little food, but this was so simple and easy to prepare. The presentation, standing up in a clear glass/jug with small cherry tomatoes, looked so impressive. And the grape tomatoes tasted really good along with the grissini. Just don't use too much pressure when rolling them, otherwise the grissini will break.

I made this for an Oscar party last year and it was a success. Great presentation, and just the right amount of saltiness.

A mistake to use traditional Grissini which broke under the weight of the rolled up prosciutto. The broken result was quite salty-we used imported prosciutto and imported freshly grated Parmesan. The combination of the prosciutto, parmesan, butter and arugula is better suited to a hearty slice of Italian bread.

Awesome--so easy and so pretty! The only trick is not breaking the Grissini.

I made this at Christmas before seeing this recipe. But I just wrapped some prosciutto round very thin grissini - the result was the grissini went soft after about 30 mins. Maybe the butter and parmesan will keep this crispy - I must give it a go!

I have made this twice for guests and they have raved both time. Do use the thinnest breadsticks you can find and soft butter. I added a basil leaf to each and it was a great addition. The amount of arugala to use depends on the size of the leaves.

These were very good and got rave reviews by my guests. I did not use as much arugula as the recipe called for and make sure the butter is soft because the breadsticks break.
