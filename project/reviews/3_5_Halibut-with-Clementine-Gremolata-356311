I applied the Gremolata before cooking. Worked great. I was afraid the uncooked galic and orange might be too strong.

Loved the clementine flavor with the halibut. Followed the recipe exactly. Next time I would halve the amount of salt.

Terribly bland. Waste of good fish. Best part was eating the clementines that were peeled.
