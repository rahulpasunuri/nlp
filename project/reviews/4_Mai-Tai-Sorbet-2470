Really delicious sorbet. Sugar could have been reduced by half, possibly taken out altogether depending on your sweet-tooth, as the nectars are sweet to start with. Wasn't too boozy at all, in fact I think it could've taken half-again more rum, though that might influence freezing point. Grenadine while traditional to the drink, adds quite a bit of unneeded food dye & not much else & can easily be taken out. Needs those 2-3 hours of freezing after making, but mine set fine.

Had to increase recipe size by 5! Found a site to increase or decrease any recipe fruitfromwashington.com, you have to look for the conversion link, but well worth it! Anyway, back to the sorbet, AWESOME! The ice cream maker didn't perform as I would have liked, but after a night in the freezer it was perfect! Served it at a Hawaiian themed party in dixie cups, tried the coconut tuile cups, but they were a miserable failure. Only problem...needed to make even more!

This was pretty good. The sorbet didn't quite set up (I didn't have time for firming it up in the freezer afterwords), so it was more like an blended margarita type consistancy. I would half the rum.

Booze! Very tasty and fun for a party. As recommended previously, serve in small portions.

This is a wonderful, easy recipe. I've made it many times now, and my favorite presentation is in coconut tuile cones (or cups), another recipe on this site. Continues the "tropical" theme and couldn't be tastier. The cones are kind of fussy to make (the "cups" are easier), but are awfully cute.

During the summer, my daughter and I look for interesting sorbet or gelato recipes to make for a cool dessert. This one was just what we were looking for - cool, crisp and the perfect ending for a summer meal. We followed the reciped closely - we just used half the amount of rum called for. I served it with some Belgian vanilla crisp wafers. My wife is hosting her bunko group next month, and insists that I make this for dessert for the group.

I make this recipe regularly. It is soooo good and always a crowd pleaser! You can't eat it in quantity--I recommend serving it in very small dessert glasses (limoncello glasses).

Woohoo! This is excellent. Served this tonight at our gourmet club and got rave reviews. I also doubled the recipe. I politely asked the hostess if she wanted to keep the tiny bit that was left and she said yes, darn it! I'm going to make another batch tomorrow.

FANTASTIC!!!! Cool, refreshing and so easy to make. I will definitely make this again served with some kind of crisp cookie or tart. Any suggestions?

This is GOOD, I mean really GOOD! Being a retired bartender, this recipe really intrigued me because the ingredients are exactly the same as for the drink. I used a Cuisinart ice cream frezzer and it worked beautifully. From now on I'll be having my Mai Tai's in the frozen form thank you very much!

This was SENSATIONAL ... deserves more than four forks! (Definitely not for kids, though ... way too boozy). I couldn't find peach-passion fruit nectar so I substituted Tropicana orange-peach-mango juice. I doubled the recipe, adding an extra tablespoon of lime juice, and froze it in my Donvier ice cream maker. It came out pretty slushy, but a couple of hours in a plastic container in the freezer firmed it up nicely. I'm going to be making this one again ... and again ... and again ... Thank you, Bon Appetit!
