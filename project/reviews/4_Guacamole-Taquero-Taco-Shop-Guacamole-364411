Make some Pico de Gallo, mash the avacods with a fork, add in the Pico. Presto great Guac.

Tastes just like the taqueria style guacamole my Mexican co-worker makes for parties. Love it!

This salsa was simply sublime! The spiciness provided by the jalapenos really made the dish for me, and the lime and cilantro complemented the spicy flavors extremely well.

Amazing! Easy and delicious on everything.

This is pure gold!! Not sure what the silly debate about whether this is a salsa or guacamole is about. For what it's worth, Iived in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood where this was sold at the Latin grocer labelled "guacamole."

Fantastic. This is a go-to recipe for taco night. Everyone raves about it.

The other hit at the Cinco de Mayo party. My friends loved this along with the chipotle salsa. Made a nice combo as an appetizer and was great on the tamales and chili. Add a couple of margaritas and you have the perfect Cinco de Mayo dinner party...with the right friends and music, of course.

I usually don't mind spicy, but with 2 jalapenos this was HOT. I wanted more of a guac recipe than a salsa, so after reading reviews I used 3 avocados instead of 1. It was yummy, but too hot for those with milder tastes.

great on all types of tacos. To joshwall $65.00? Did you make a 55 gallon barrel of this sauce or is the produce that high in New York

No, maybe the editors should stop calling something guacamole that is clearly a salsa.

Maybe you should read the directions before you make a dish. It clearly states: Add a little water, if necessary, to achieve a pourable texture. This salsa tastes best the day it's made... Pourable and salsa should have been clues. Understanding the recipe might save you some heartache in the future.

Wow Epicurious, thanks for doing a terrible editing job with this recipe. THIS IS NOT GUACAMOLE, it's a salsa. Wasted $65 on this for a Super Bowl party and then had to go out and purchase store bought guacamole, which is exactly what I wanted to avoid.

Fantastic. I may not make regular guacamole for a long time. I'm busy thinking up things I can cook so I can serve this along with it. I've so far enjoyed it with chips and on veggie quesadillas. It tastes primarily of tomatillos with a subtle avocado flavor and a slight chili heat. So tasty.

This is a great salsa to have in one's repertoire. It has a clean, bright, fresh flavor that is so good on tacos, eggs, chicken, etc., but as others have said it is not guacamole. My son, who loves the food in Baja California, says this is exactly like the green salsa he gets at taco stands there.

This guacamole will knock your socks off. It was a huge hit and I will definitely make it again. The heat is just right. The cilantro and tomatillos lend fresh and green notes.

This sauce is outstanding. It's tart and tangy and with a bit more jalepeno, nice and spicy. This is going to be a regular in my house. Huge hit at work with all my coworkers as well.

Made it without onions as I am not a fan and had to add a little water because my blender couldn't handle the tomatillas. That said, very good, nice and creamy and leaves a nice tangy, spicy after taste. I tried it with some chips and it is really amazing.

I've made this a couple of times now and think it is outstanding. Great on tacos and even better on grilled corn on the cob. I doubled the lime juice and diced the ingredients smaller and found that helped to get the puree going in the blender. Stored in a standard squeeze bottle it lasts for several days.

This was great!!! I will make this every time from now on. Super easy and full of flavor. Love it.

Cook from Denver hit it on the head. This is not the chunky guacamole for serving with chips (though it is good w/chips too). It is the traditional Mexican taqueria sauce - it's often placed, in a bottle, at the table, alongside the Tabasco Sauce (or something more authentic). The recipe is incredibly easy to whiz up - I did it in a mini food processor (no blender) and it came out perfect. You can tweak the amount of heat.

Dont expect traditional guac. That is not what this is. Its really a sauce for tacos and it made ours amazing! The perfect amount of heat. I thought it was better the 2nd day.

Meh. More like a salsa. A good salsa, but not a guacamole in my opinion. I even put in two avocados... Tasty though!
