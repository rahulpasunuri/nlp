Excellent, I had seven for dinner and only 1 cup (not 1 1/4 cup) ramekins. Filled them 2/3 - 3/4 of the way up and they puffed nicely in the oven. Served the souffles with vanilla ice cream. Everyone loved it.

I have made this recipe twice now and it is absolutely delicious! The first time I only had 5 people for tea so just divided the mix up into 5 but found that meant it did not rise quite as high and took longer to cook than when I made it into 6 dishes the second time.

Very good! The only thing I will do next time is chop the 2oz. of Toblerone finer...when I put the pieces in after the first 1/2 of the batter I noticed the bigger chunks sank to the bottom, whereas the small pieces stayed floating in the middle.

I have made this recipe many times; frozen, frozen longer than they suggest, freshly made. Although it may not puff as well, it is always delicious and remarkably (for a souffle) resilient. I have even cooked it in a toaster oven. It is great and easy.

This was great! However,the batch I made was barely enough to fill four 1&1/4 cup ramekins to the top, not six. I wonder if there is a typo or if I just made an error in the prep. Also, I'm not sure how high souffles should rise but these only rose about 1 inch above the rim. FYI, they were in the fridg for 3 hours before I put them in the oven so that may have been a factor. Very tasty, in any event and I wioll make again!

I was hesitant about taking it straight from the freezer into the oven but what a huge success! The souffle rose to its fullest possible height and stayed there long enough for my impressed lunch guests to snap a picture of it!

Pretty easy for what is normally a daunting dessert for me. The advance preparation was great. I made this the night before and just brought it out and put it in the oven as we put the coffee on to brew. Quite delicious and a definite hit with my guests. Tho, make sure your oven heats eavenly. I forgot and should have rotated the souffles in the oven at half time.

A delicious and easy souffle recipe. Is even better with ice cream. I've made this recipe several times and it's always a hit.
