Super easy and really delicious. I left the garlic in the pan and ate them. I love garlic.

A little bland for me, but my guests all thought it was delicious. Very different with pinenuts and raisins. I'd try it again!

This was delicious. I left the garlic in after smashing it up with a wooden spoon while it cooked. Served it tossed with spaghettini.

Ultra easy to make. The liquid didn't evaporate enough for me, so I just drained it and served the dish without the leftover liquid. Everyone loved this dish and were really keen to eat it again!

I have been craving this since a trip to Barcelona in May. I highly recommend this recipe! Fantastic!

This recipe is not the traditional catalan recipe, as it is lacking "pernil", the catalan name for spanish cured ham. The spinach is always washed up in water before boiling it, no matter the dish you're preparing, and must be well drained. The garlic is fried and taken away from the pan when it gets coloured, so all you get is the hint of its flavour. Then add the ham, later the raisins, then the pines, finally the spinach, salt and pepper. Cover, and cook very slowly.

Fantastic recipe, as is. BUT - I usually drizzle some balsamic vinegar right at the last minute to add a little kick. When I don't have balsamic, I use lemon juice. This is one of my favorite side-dishes. I had it at a spanish restaurant years ago and immediately had to come home and re-create it. Surprisingly, this recipe is almost to the letter as my own preparation!

Delicious! Served it at a wine tasting party over the weekend, and it was a hit! I toasted the pine nuts, soaked the raisins in dessert wine, and added two small sweet onions. My only problem was that the spinach gave off so much liquid, it never cooked off. From now on, I'll probably cook the spinach first, squeeze it dry, and then toss it back in with all the other ingredients. One of my favorite spinach preparations ever!

Love this spinach recipe. I've been making it for years. Used sliced almonds as I didn't have pine nuts - great substitute.

So easy! And it tastes more complicated. Hardest part was peeling and sauteing the garlic. I used 5 large cloves garlic and kept pressing on them while they were cooking to all the garlic juice into the oil. I used 30 oz of frozen, chopped spinach, defrosted. I would use less raisins. I used an adjustable mill and coarse ground the pepper. I also used coarse sea salt. I saved the liquid from the raisins to pour over grapefruit the next morning.

Delicious recipe, and since I used bagged and washed baby spinach, it was a piece of cake.

This is one of my favourite Catalan dishes. My mother has cooked this for as long as I can remember, either in this form or as a filling to an omelette (to which I add some bread rubbed with tomato and olive oil). Yet other people, in some villages, people make crusty crepes out of this and it is also traditional to make caneloni filled with this kind of spinach in special ocasions!

This is one of my favorite recipes. To add a little bit more flavor I like to add some pancetta which I cook after the garlic. Delicious.

A friend made this side-dish for a small gathering of 5 and we all asked for the recipe. Not only was delicious, but the bright green spinach and golden raisins made it beautiful as well. Very interesting and tasty flavor combination.

Absolutely wonderful--received tons of compliments. I sauteed a small sweet onion with the olive oil after removing the garlic and before adding the spinach--I think it was a good addition. I made the dish in advance and it was fine. I let it sit at room temp for a couple of hours prior to serving and at the last minute rewarmed in microwave. If time allows would be best to make just before serving.

This recipe is similar to Spinach with Pine Nuts and Raisins, but lacks the onions. I have not tried the Catalan recipe, but highly recommend adding sweet onions!

This recipe was delicious and very easy to make. I will definitely make it again. We served it for company and it was a hit.

Not sorry to try something new, but we'll continue to eat our spinach raw--so far, the only way we like it.

One of our traditional all-times-dish. At home we do a variation when the spinaches are already boiled (a recycling technique!). Chop garlic and fry it slowly on a large pan with soft olive oil. When it's golden, add the spinaches and fry them slowly allowing them to be very warm. Just 1 minute before finishing, add the pine nuts and the raisins. That's the only way for my little brother to eat healthy spinach!

This side dish is simply delicious. My husband does not enjoy cooked spinach but loved this dish.

I made this for a dinner party and got the best compliment from a friend who said, "I don't even like spinach and I want seconds of this dish." It is really easy and yummy.
