Sorry, the first time I forgot to give it the 4 fork rating it deserves!

These are unbelievably delish - don't omit a thing - the flavors meld perfectly, and were devoured by even my raisin-phobic kids who are fans of "normal" food (quesadillas with just cheese and tortillas, for example). My husband loves them too, even though I doubt he'd ever eaten a raisin in his entire life up til these. Trust me - this is a ham and cheese sandwich par excellence. Yum!

I made this dish as part of a Super Bowl spread for familes with kids and they were a rousing success. Easy and delicious!

This is a great recipe, and the whole family loved it. I'd urge you to omit the raisins, and replace them with some spoonfuls of salsa (either storebought or homemade) and fresh chopped cilantro. This can also be done under the broiler on cookie sheets instead of in a skillet. Simply place the filled quesadillas on a cookie sheet, brush with melted butter, place 5 inches under the broiler, broil for 3 minutes, then turn and broil for an addition 2-3 minutes, or until golden on each side.

We thought this was a great way to use up leftover ham--instead of the raisins and onions I used the Fresh Peach Chutney from the "Ham and Fresh Peach Chutney on Corn Bread" recipe. It was fabulous!!

Definately leave out the raisins. Use Olive Oil instead of butter,Colby-Jack instead of plain Jack and top with chopped Lettuce and store-bought salsa. It's a Fiesta!

Great without the raisins and fried in olive oil instead of butter! Makes a great appetizer when made with small-sized tortillas. Serve on a heated platter.
