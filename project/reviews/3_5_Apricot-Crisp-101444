Made times 4 in a small baking dish. Cooked only about 20 minutes so the apricots do not get mushy! Sooooo good!

Delicious! Do not overcook or apricots will get mushy. Best eaten while it is still warm so that the topping is crisp. Made a large batch in a 9x12 baking pan using about 3lbs (prox 30 apricots).

We were able to use fresh apricots of the tree in our back yard! This recipe is delicious and easy to double! Great with whipped topping.

This recipe was so delicious! I think I'm now going to use it as my standard crisp recipe. We loved it and definitely will make it again. Plus, it's super easy.

This was TART! And I typically like tart things... I added a ripe peach (white flesh, very sweet) and a bit more brown sugar to the apricots, plus some extra oats (per another reviewer's suggestion) then divided everything into three ramekins, not two. Next time, I'll use two - once they cooled a bit, they sank half-way down the ramekin. Also, they could have used more topping on each to compensate for the juices and the excessive tartness. For my tastes, this could have used double the amount of crisp topping, 1/3 - 1/2 less apricot! Then the tartness of the apricots would have gone nicely with the sweetness of the topping and the excessive juices wouldn't have un-crisped the topping (it still tasted good, though!). Maybe I'll just try the topping alone...

Loved it ~ doubled and baked in an 8x8 casserole dish. Decreased brown sugar by 1/2, added white sugar and mixed in chopped crystalized ginger. Yumm. Would be great over ice cream. Quinn, Personal Chef in the Seattle area

I tried this first with apricots, following the instructions carefully. It was good, but the next few times I played with the recipe. Adding a little nutmeg and a few more oats helped a lot. The crisp seems to work best with blueberries, but raspberries and blackberries have been delicious, too. I use this crisp recipe at least once a month, and always with wonderful results!

I really did not like this recipe. I thought the brown sugar added an unpleasant flavor to the topping after it had boiled with the apricot juice while baking. I also did not care for the taste of the baked apricots. I doubled the recipe because I wanted to bake this in a small casserole, so I added one large ripe peach, and when eating it I found myself seeking out the peach pieces as they had a much nicer flavor. Also, the topping was never really "crisp".

Excellent!!! And so quick!!!I tripled it for a square baker, and also added some plums and some Peach Schnapps to ensure it would be juicy enough.

This is a great, quick recipe. I increase the quantity of the ingredients and bake it in a square baker. I buy lots of apricots when they're on sale then make several of these for family and friends. Never fail...I ALWAYS eat half of the crisp as it's cooling in the baking dish! Let's hear it for Apricots! They're so cute! Buy some today!

We had a bunch of apricots on the tree so we increased the recipe four-fold and baked it in a 9x13 baking dish. The result was absolutely delicious, in no small part due to the delicious apricots we started out with. I don't think I would change anything about the recipe, although we used quick oats instead of old-fashioned oats and although the results were great, I think I would use the old fashioned aots next time. The brown sugar in the filling and the topping is a real winner. Eating it with ice cream is also a no-brainer.

This was so yummy. It was quick and easy to make as well. It was the perfect summer dessert.

I added a handful of blueberries for color. The individual servings made for the perfect dessert for a romantic dinner. I served it with Haagen Daaz's Dulce de Leche ice cream. Wonderful!
