i added some parmesan cheese and salt because otherwise the flavor is a little flat, otherwise good recipe - make sure you like lemon! if you just want a hint of it, i'd say the amount of zest should be halved.

I will definitely keep this on my quick dinner list as it is tasty, quick, and flexible. Most of the ingredients are in people's pantry or can be substituted and it is easily adaptable if an ingredient is unavailable. One thing I would add is toasted pine nuts. The crunch would make a nice addition.

This is definitely a simple set of flavors, but I was shocked at how good it was! I used whole wheat pasta (chiocciole) and a peppery olive oil. I think good olive oil really makes the dish. Nice spring meal for one. I made it twice this week.

Very good side dish to accompany a BOLD main dish. It is better after sitting overnight or maybe several hours. Don't stint on lemon.

Excellent quick lunch!

I love this recipe, and I make it exactly as it is printed, except substituting a Meyer lemon (when they're in season) and sometimes adding more cheese. It's entirely dependent upon high-quality cheese, olive oil, basil and tarragon, so I can see how it would go wrong if any of those ingredients weren't up to par. If you're looking for a bold, spicy, full-bodied pasta recipe, this isn't for you (no onions, no garlic, no red pepper flakes!). But if you love peas and ricotta salata, you can't go wrong here.

sounds better than it tastes. I followed everything except I used dried tarragon instead of fresh. Found the ricotta salata to be bland - my father in law asked if it was tofu after tasting it! may try it again with feta, or perhaps a whole grain pasta for more flavor.

I thought this was fantastic. I used parsley instead of basil, as it's what I had on hand, and used a little less oil. It was simple, tasty, and pretty. I will definitely make this again. I used a penne-sized pasta, but I'm sure this would work well with capellini as well.

This dish is incredible, easy, and I crave it constantly. I do however make a few substitutes which may interest others. Instead of Ricotta Salata, I use regural ricotta which is creamier. I go easy on the oil and a little heavier on the lemon juice. And I've tried with my many types of pasta but Rigatoni noodles were my favorite. I'm planning on making this dish tonight!

I added shrimp, pancetta and summer squash. I think the pancetta made the dish so wonderfull. Great summer pasta. Really nice change from the typical pasta with ricotta and tomato sauces.

I first made this receipe from the original printing in 1998 and my husband and I make it often. I just looked online to double check the ingredients since I misplaced my copy of the receipe. It is simple, but we love it. Perfect for spring, but also perfect for a houseful of guests the night before thanksgiving. Yum!

Very refreshing, and a quick recipe for weekday meals.

My wife and I enjoyed this recipe a lot as a weeknight summer dish. We seem to like lemony type pastas quite a bit. I added some prosciutto to the leftovers and that was good, as well.

I found this recipe to just fine. Nothing great but certainly not bad. It is what it is: a simple pasta dish. Maybe the cook from Virginia had some poor Ricotta Salata as I found the cheese I bought to be nice and dry yet rich and flavorful as one would expect it to be. I also found that the amount of oil/lemon was just right for flavor although I will try adding a very small amount of the pasta cooking water next time to slightly make the sauce a bit more lengthy. All in all a good dish and one for the dorm room and budget!

Sometimes a few simple ingredients combine in spectacular ways, but not this time. The ricotta was like cardboard, stiff and tasteless, and there was nowhere near enough of the oil and lemon juice mixture to come close to even thinly coating the pasta.

This was fantastic! Easy to make and very flavorful, but richer than it sounds! I increased the recipe by half and had more than enough left over for lunch the next day.
