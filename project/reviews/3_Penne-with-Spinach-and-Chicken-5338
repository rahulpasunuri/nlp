Very tasty as made with the enhancements suggested by reviewer lmjNY: extra garlic, lemon juice, extra zest, white wine, and red peppers. Also used feta instead of parmesan.

the dish was a disapointment. i expected a lot more flavor considering the ingredients required. even after adding the extra liquid at the end it was still not saucy enough. we will more than likely never use this recipe again.

I upped the garlic and lemon zest, used the lemon and white wine as suggested below. I didn't have rosemary, so used some Herbs de Provence. I also add sun dried tomatoes right before the spinach. I didn't add the cheese, just a sprinkle after done.

Very tasty and easy....just added a little extra garlic

Okay - here is how to make this dish with the best of all the reviewers' suggestions: Double the lemon zest and double the garlic. When adding the chicken I also threw in a jar of drained roasted red peppers, then a splash of white wine and a squeeze of lemon juice. Use only 1 bag of spinach. Use about 1/2 lb of Feta. I left out the parm but my husband sprinkled some on top of his dish. With those additions it is 4 forks, but it is also a different recipe!

As per some of the other reviews, I added a couple splashes of chicken broth (instead of the reserved water), as well as a few sliced roma tomatoes, half a small zucchini (sliced and sauteed with the onions) and a squeeze of lemon juice over the cooked chicken. It turned out great & looked pretty, too.

Basic idea is very good. I like a lot of flavor in a dish like this, so I used chicken broth, not pasta cooking water, to keep pan moist, and added red peper flakes to up the attitude level. Also, per another reviewers suggestion, I did add roasted red peper to the dish at the end. Great idea.

Easy and quick--a good weeknight meal. I roasted a red pepper and 5 cloves of garlic while the pasta was cooking. Gave it nice flavor and color. Def add pepper flakes.

Flavors are nice and subtle. Next time I make it, I'll double the seasonings and add a bit of hot pepper flakes to finish.

I made this last night--after reading the notes, I was concerned that it might be bland, so I also added pepper flakes, but then I squeezed the lemon over the chicken after it had sauteed and before adding the spinach--this was delicious, so flavorful and fresh. We loved it, and its now on my list of easy favorites.

I love this combination, but I prefer Feta cheese and I add roasted red peppers for flavor and color!

After reading past reviews, I added a little red pepper, basil and more oil. I also substituted the penne for linguini. My mom really liked it, I thought it was okay. I agree that it was a bit bland and it's just not for everyone.

I used .75 lbs. of fresh spinach instead of frozen and a little chicken broth before putting the spinach into the pot.

I used frozen spinach, tons of spices, cheddar jack cheese, this helped with the flavor

At first glance, this recipe looked quite promising but the end result was a disappointment. I agree w/ those who thought this recipe was very bland. I too increased the amount of garlic, lemon zest...etc..but to no avail. Don't waste your time w/ this one.

I agree with others who suggested chicken stock instead of pasta water. Also substituted fresh basil & oregano for the rosemary. Surprising good for so few ingredients.

Rating: 1
Despite all the wonderful recipe suggestions by the other reviewers (and I used almost all of them), this was the most surprisingly bland meal. Nobody wanted to eat it, including me, so we scraped it into the garbage and ate cereal. I just can't understand why it had no flavor.

Rating: 3
This recipe was a winner with a few improvements. I used a whole red onion instead of a half, and 2 bags of spinach was 1 bag too many. I didn't chop the garlic, but smashed it with my knife. I did this to keep it from burning up while the onions carmelized. I used about half a head of garlic. As my sauce dried up I added about 1/3 cup of chicken broth instead of the pasta water. It was delicious! I will definately add this to my recipe collection!

This dish is delicious with modifications. Halve the amount of spinach used. Add sauted mushrooms in wine and butter sauce. Also increase the number of garlic cloves to 5-6 for greater flavour!!

Great basic recipe, but be prepared to add more garlic and lemon zest to increase the flavor. We enjoyed the dish and will it cook again, although I agree with the earlier comment that this recipe doesn't make for a great presentation.

Rating: 1
Doesn't make for a good presentation at all. As other reviewers mentioned, was begging for more flavour... even with more garlic and three times the lemon zest, this was a yawner.

My husband and I loved this one . Increased the lemon rind and the garlic. Next time I'll saute mushrooms in white wine and some more garlic. . My onions were quite brown when I added the chicken. 4 forks please.

This was an easy and very tasty recipe. The prep time was about the same as the cooking time. The only thing I wasn't prepared for was the size of teh pot needed. They aren't kidding about using a large pot.

I used a package of frozen spinach as I didn't have fresh on hand. I also increased the garlic by two cloves. Even my kids loved it!

Before making this recipe I read the review's and was a little hesitant, however, I added white wine to the spinach combination, what a great transformation!!! My family loved it.

Rating: 3
I used only about 2/3 of the pasta called for, 1/2 of the spinach called for, and added a few teaspoons of red pepper flakes. It was much "peppier", and very tasty. I think the next time I make it, I'll use white wine instead of the reserved pasta water, and put the cheese in at the very end.

Rating: 3
My spin on this recipe: I used 10 oz. of spinach and 12 oz. of chicken; I reconstituted an ounce of dried sliced portabello mushrooms and added those along with the chicken, reserving the liquid in which I reconstituted them (I strained it through cheesecloth before using it in the next step); I made about 1/2 cup of a creamy sauce, using half & half, a little Wondra flour, some white pepper, a bit of the reserved mushroom liquid, and a generous pinch of the grated parmesan; and then I blended that sauce into the pasta-spinach-chicken mixture just before serving. It was a huge success!

I agree that it was bland and too much spinach.

Rating: 3
The best part of this recipe is that it is easy to make, although I left some of the spinach leaves whole and it would have been much better if I had broken the leaves up more. I agree the spinach makes it somewhat bland, I'm not sure what to do to jazz it up some more.

I tried this recipe based on the ingredients and comments from other viewers. Unfortunately, it did not taste very good to me or my family. I thought it was too much spiniach and very, very bland.

Rating: 3
I really enjoyed it. If you prepare it just as it says, it turns out really well. The only thing that I would add a red bell pepper and mushrooms when you put the chicken into cook. I did top it off with soy parmesean cheese and it actually added more flavor than regular parmesean cheese. Pretty good, even my two year old loved it...

This dish is very good. As I was making it I felt that the recipe was calling for too much spinach, but it worked out fine. The spinach really shrinks.

I always consider a recipe a success when all the guests ask for a copy of it and today, when I made this dish for the first time, all my guests were very impressed. Served with a salad and some hot, crusty garlic bread, it was also a very easy meal to prepare. I will definitely make again!

I made this for friends and we loved it!!!! in fact i am making it again tomorrow for a party i am catering - that is what i do for a living. it is light and delicious. one thing that i did add was some chicken stock/base to the pasta water and it gave it tremdous added flavor.

I concur with this dish being bland. I paid attention to the directions and cooked on medium high. This did not improve the flavor. Tastes like unseasoned chicken with plain pasta.

This dish was too bland, I tried adding a little bit of lemon juice but it didn't make a difference. I love spinach but I would rather make it as a side dish not include it in this recipe.

Rating: 3
I almost didn't make this dish because of the negative reviews. I'm glad I went ahead with it. It was really quite good. I have a theory for those who were dissatisfied. In making this dish, and any other at this website for that matter, you have to pay attention to the cooking temperatures. If you don't, you will get a much different result than the recipe intends. When this one says to cook at medium high, that's what you have to do to get the right flavor. Trust the recipe! I did add a few red pepper flakes and a splash of dry white wine as other reviewers suggested, but I think the really important thing is the cooking temp.

This recipe is great with leftover chicken and is great for the summer. Very easy to make.

Rating: 1
It read dull. It tasted dull. A much better variation is cut out the chicken. Instead fry some sliced shallots (scallions)and small chilli, in the same pan crisp fry bacon, remove and add half cup breadcrumbs till brown - remove from stove and mix in spinach. Stir the lot with a few chopped basil leaved into the pasta. Now there is a recipe!

This dish is good, light. I make a variation of this by adding a can of whole tomatoes that i chop, and then sprinkle feta cheese on top of the dish at the finish (it adds a wonderful flavor)I do not use Parm.

Unfortunately, I don't can't rave about this one. It was very disappointing for both myself and hubbie. On the bright side, it was definitely different!

This recipe was fine for a weeknight meal but not a keeper. I took the advice of other reviewers and doubled the red onion and garlic and added mushrooms and red pepper flakes. It was good but, in general, didn't have a lot of flavor. If you're making this for the first time I would also use additional spinach.
