HOLY WOW! I'm from the north so when I moved down south and had my boyfriend's mom continuously make canned collard's - oh my lord. SO GROSS AND TASTELESS. I had NO taste for collards whatsoever. With this recipe, not only am I eating collards, my boyfriend and his sister adore the recipe as well! When I tasted the sauce, I thought, "why would I put something sweet over a spicy, tasteless, ick food?" IT COMPLIMENTS SO WELL!! The sauce makes the dish. It's a caramel sauce and very sweet. This is the only way I'll ever eat collards!

Best collards recipe ever! I tossed the shallots with corn meal, but otherwise the recipe is perfect!

This was decent, but after the rave reviews, I guess I was a little disappointed. First of all, deep frying the shallots was extremely messy and time consuming, and for all that mess and effort, I ended up with lots of very greasy shallots, almost none of which were actually crispy. Maybe I did something wrong - I am new to deep frying. But the shallots were simply not worth it IMO. That being said, I DID end up with some flavorful greens. Not so tasty that they totally blew my socks off, but tasty. I might make them again and either saute or roast the shallots instead of deep frying.

Collard greens cooked down beautifully with this recipe, and I like the peanut oil & bacon dripping flavor. For my taste, the gastrique could have been sweeter & thicker. I'm not sure the effort of frying shallots was worth the return, other than the beauty as a garnish.Next time, I will saute.

Super tasty! Even my 1 and 4 year old kids love it. I have made it with out the bacon and is equally delicious.

This dish is fantastic! The 2nd time I made it, I also added 3 cooked and cooled and diced yellow fleshed potatoes to the 1/3 lb. of diced bacon that was fried with the onion,'til crispy. Then added my organic kale and collards....amazing with the vinegar/pepper reduction...served along side hot Italian sausage

Great recipe! I had a mix of chard, collards and added spinach at the end. Delicious and surprisingly light for greens!

WOW! My new go to recipe for tough greens I get in my CSA box. Had my sister and bro-in-law over for Christmas Eve and made this using Collards. My bro-in-law loves Collards and said these are the best he has ever had. Got call this AM, still talking about them! I sauteed the shallots with the collards, the Gastrique makes the dish!

Tasty kale recipe. You can skip the bacon drippings and saute the shallots along with the kale, instead of frying them in oil, and it still tastes great. Have made this several times, and will make it again.

This was delicious! My dad makes greens every year so I knew I had to do something special as the torch was passed to me. I didn't have any bacon fat on hand for the greens and just used basic veggie oil, but it still turned out great. I used kale and mustard greens. This was super easy to make and ended up being a hit!

Personally, I think frying the shallots is a good way to go; it doesn't have to be blobby like fried onion rings. Instead of cider vinegar, I used balsamic vinegar, which I felt deepened the complexity of the gastrique.

Delicious earthy greens, tangy gastrique, crunchy savory shallots - what's not to like? I fluffed the shallots in flour before putting in the hot oil and made extra for the quality assurance testing. Husband who doesn't like greens said this was 'good.'

Okay, I cheated. I used swiss chard, which doesn't have to be cooked quite so long to become tender, and I used (gasp!) fried onions in a can. It was still delicious (and I'm sure it would have been even better if I had done it the "right" way). But for a quick side dish to go with some delicious trout, fantastic.

I have a garden and collards always give us SO much for the effort. I'm always looking for new ways to prepare them and I've found a winner! Vinegar is a must and this might be the best use of it yet!

Served this for a casual party along with braised beef with leeks and Ad Hoc's leek bread pudding...all devoured. Agree that sauteeing the shallots is the way to go. Really nice flavor melding. Kale, particularly, and collard sometimes get a bad rap as bitter. Proving otherwise, I had no slightly uncertain questions (even from the kids) like "uh, what is this?' It just comes off as delicious flavorful greens!

Even people who don't normally like collard greens have said this was great! It is now my standard new year's day recipe. If you can find the mixed greens already washed and cut up (Sam's Club, Trader Joe's), it really makes this so quick to prepare!

Tend to make this recipe several times in the fall since I get a lot of chard & kale in my CSA deliveries. I really enjoy this dish, especially the gastrique - it has a nice bite & tanginess. Keep an eye on the gastrique because you really don't want it to boil and it cooks very quickly. I tend to leave off the crispy shallots since it's a lot of extra work. I might try and buy something pre-packaged next time (I wonder if those french fried onions would be good).

This recipe sounded great and I wanted to try it, but had no cider vinegar. Rather than make another run out, I used balsamic vinegar. I also simplified by merely sauteing the shallots until crisp. Even with these changes, it was delicious. I never loved collard greens until now.

My favorite recipe so far for collard greens/swiss chard/kale thus far. I had three pieces of bacon in the fridge, so I just tore those up and used them (plus the oil) in the saucepan. Also, I didn't want to fry the shallots, so I just sauteed them in the pan with the bacon.

I liked this recipe very much and would make it again. I did not have 2 cups of oil to deep fry the shallots, so I just sauteed them instead until they were crispy. I know some other reviewers skipped the bacon grease, but I thought it added a nice dimension to the finished product.

Outstanding. Wonderful combination of flavors and easy.

if there was some way i could give this recipe five forks, I would do it.

Delicious, gastrique was awesome. I didn't feel that the bacon fat was essential part so will skip next time. Braising time was less.

Can anyone comment on the possibility of advance preparation for this dish? Since the instructions say to rewarm before adding the topping, it seems the greens could be done ahead, but I am interested to know if any have experience with it. Thanks.

This was a great recipe! I made it for Xmas eve dinner, and although it had a lot of components to make, it tasted delicious. My greens did not take nearly as long to braise as the recipe suggests. I loved the spicy gastrique and the crispy shallots (I could eat a whole bowl of them!) and I threw in some crispy bacon. I will definitely be making this again.

This is a perfect recipe! I am making it agian, although I did use more pepper flakes then it called for and I got a really nice back of the mouth heat! Yeah another winner from epicurious.

I made this dish without the bacon drippings and it still came out very well, it all melded together, a great dish. despite the red pepper flakes it did not have a lot of spice, so if you like spicy you might want to increase this ingredient.
