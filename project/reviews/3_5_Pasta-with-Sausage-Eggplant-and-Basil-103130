I made this with ground turkey meatballs (to avoid using sausage) with hot pepper flakes and it added add'l zest. Very good!

This recipe seems a little dated. Too much pasta and meat to vegetable ratio. It is hearty and my dinner companion who loves meat sauce pasta dishes liked it. Too rich for me and the flavors were one dimensional.

I think this recipe as is deserves three forks, but with a few minor adjustments it became an outstanding 4 forks recipe. After following the recipe the first time, here's what I did to improve it: (1) I used freshly made egg pasta, rather than dried pasta. (2) I used a good quality mild Italian sausage instead of the spicy Italian sausage. (3) I decreased the amount of meat to 0.4 lbs. This may just be a personal preference for me, but I don't really enjoy dishes with this much meat in them. (4) I used twice the amount of eggplant. Yum! (5) I decreased the amount of pine nuts to just a small sprinkle per plate. I thought the pine nuts overpowered the dish the first time I made it. (6) I browned the sausage first and cooked the eggplant in partial sausage grease, along with olive oil. I also did not drain the sausage on a paper towel either. I think every bit of extra sausage grease adds a lot of flavor, so I left it in wherever I could. However, this might have only worked because I used less meat. (7) I also used cayenne because that's what I had on hand. It was absolutely delicious!

This is an awesome pasta dish! I added baby bella mushrooms and then reduced the sausage to just 1 pound. The sauce it makes it outstanding! A definate keeper!

This is a family fave!! I went shopping for all the stuff today and come home & couldn't find the recipe. I've been making this for years. I'm so glad that I found it!!!! I now use italian peppers so it's not too hot for the kids and I like to put in my tomatoes the last couple minutes. I also add an onion. Seriously me and hubby crave this dish.

This was soooo yummy!! My parents loved and of course, my five year-old sister hated it. I took out the chilies, because my family and I aren't huge hot fans (the sausage was enough). I also used different tomatoes. Next time I will probably use less eggplant.

Before he had even finished, my husband was begging me to make it again. I did make a few adjustments however, mostly because of what I had on hand. Cut down slightly on the garlic, used half & half at suggestion of other other reviews, and used some 'gourmet' chicken sausages with sundried tomato and basil were in the fridge. Absolutely delicious.

This recipe is really incredible- it is easy and satisfying!!! It makes a whole bunch though, just fyi.

Skip the serranos. The spicy Italian sausage from my farmers market gave this plenty of heat. I also subbed half & half for the cream, so the sauce was a little lighter, which I enjoyed. I used eggplant and cherry tomatoes from my garden and cooked the eggplant the day before to save time the day I made it, which made this a 30 minute meal the day I cooked it. I also left out the pine nuts because I didn't have them and felt that adding them would be too much going on in this dish. I will make this a regular summer dish, especially when I grow eggplant.

Delicious. Rather time consuming, but once all the parts come together, the pasta is creamy and flavorful and still tastes great reheated as leftovers. I substituted turkey meat for the meatballs and think I will do this again in the future.

Opted for mild sausage and only red pepper flakes instead of chili to allow for kids tastes. Great recipe.

Definitely a keeper. Nice flavors. Reminds me of a dish from our favorite Italian restaurant. Used canned tomatoes instead of cherry because that's what I had. Still was great!

OK but not great, I don't think the flavors really went together. Maybe I'll try it again without the sausage, but now I think it's not a keeper.

Substituted squash for eggplant and cut the garlic in half. We definitely enjoyed this dish!

Very good recipe. I made half the recipe using 7 ounces of sausage. I made 3/4" meatballs which worked out great. I subbed vine ripened tomatoes for the cherry because I had them on hand. I used 3 large cloves of garlic and thought it was too much. Served this with a simple salad.

A very tasty dish. I made this recipe to use eggplant, Serrano chilies and purple basil from my autumn garden. The cherry tomatoes were picked long ago, however, so I used 2 14.5 oz. cans of whole tomatoes, cut up, and it worked well. I also used fat free half-and-half instead of the cream, adding it last and cooking just until warmed so that it did not clump or become stringy. I also substituted 99% fat free broth since there was enough fat from the sausage. I agree with the comments of others that this is a good dish to play with and change based on what is available. Next time I will peel the eggplant first and add seasoning when frying the eggplant, maybe red pepper flakes and some Italian seasoning. Oh, and I omitted the pine nuts. The flavor of pine nuts is delicate and would get lost in this dish.

My sister made this dish for me a few years ago. I was recently thinking about it and asked her for the recipe so that I could make it at home. My husband and roomate loved it. I did add some red pepper flakes and used spicy sausage. But next time I will not overcook the eggplant (which I did do this time) and I will add some green veggie to go with it as well.

I loved this recipe as is. However, when I make it again I will omit the sausage (doesn't need it) and use diced canned tomatoes. My perfect little cherry tomatoes were much better raw.

This is one of my favorite recipes. Everyone always raves about it. I take some shortcuts depending on the season and what's available fresh, like using chunky pureed tomatoes and leaving out the chicken broth and cream, or adding mushrooms. I sometimes use hot Italian sausage and just cut up the links--easier than the meatballs and fine for friends and family.

I did change the recipe a little. instead of cherry tomatoes i used pomi chopped tomatoes and eliminated the cream, everything else i left the same. my wnole family really liked it including 7, 6 and 2 year old.

I have made this twice to rave reviews. The 2nd time I omitted the sausage and used 1/2 pound ground veal and 1 pound ground pork. The subtler flavors were much more evident this way.

Very good although lacked something. I added a little hot sauce, soy sauce, pepper, and a little more salt. Next time I will add a bouillon cube to the water, and maybe add an onion?

My boyfriend and I made this together. He is a private chef and thought it was very good. We would make it again. We made it with spicy sausage instead of the meatballs.

This dish wasn't that great. Even my boyfriend, who normally inhales everything I make, left this one sitting in the fridge.

Very good recipe. The tomatos, pine nuts and basil are terrific together. We didn't think that both eggplant and sausage were necessary - either would work well on its own. We used 1/2 and 1/2 and crushed red pepper as suggested; they both worked well. Good with Zin.

This dish is delicious - great combination of flavors. Takes a little time, but is basically easy to prepare. I couldn't find spicy italian sausage, so I added garlic and a couple serrano chilis to the meat when I removed it from th casing, and it was great. Also added a little more garlic and a few more chilis than the recipe called for. Really good.

Rating: 4
My guests and husband were impressed (considering I made this by candlelight in a power outage). Nice combination of ingredients. I think next time I will substitute half and half and use a little less cheese and less olive oil to cut back on the fat. I only added 1 chili thinking it would be too hot, but the dish could have easily taken 2.

I didn't have eggplant, so I substituted fresh mushrooms and zucchini. It was wonderful! I have made this dish twice. It is easy to prepare, doesn't take much time or many ingredients, and tastes great! My husband, who is not a pasta fan, loved it.

Cut down on the fat by reducing the olive oil and using skim milk. I had to add flour to thicken the sauce. This was my first time using eggplant in anything. What a great dish! Both my husband and I loved it!

My husband and I liked this. My kids hated it. The next day the eggplant skin was kinda gross, but the rest was still great.

Great meal. Since I made the recipe when tomatoes are not in season I used a can of Rotel diced tomatoes and deleted the chilis. Just the right touch of heat. Thought I could use less liquid to keep from having to thicken with cornstarch. No such luck.

LOVE this!! Made it after a day of skiing. My boyfriend did all the meatballs, and chopping, while I did the assembly. Used 3 T of olive oil, roasted garlic chicken stock, zuccini instead of eggplant and half and half instead of whipping cream (had to use a little flour to thinken). We both loved it (great with a Zinfandel).

Rating: 3
I used crushed red pepper instead of the chile, Italian seasoned chicken broth and half and half instead of whipping cream. I also thickened up the sauce with some flour. I used about 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil instead of 7. I thought the dish turned out okay, (2 forks) good enough to make again, but my husband loved it (4 forks).

I am just now experimenting with eggplant. This was well received, but I made a couple of changes. I roasted a full head of garlic and roasted the eggplant. This gave the overall dish a rather smoky, milder taste. I also added 1 cp. of golden Italian mushrooms. I used light cream to save calories and fat. The sauce was a little thin, so I used cornstarch for thickening. It didn't take as long as I thought it would to prepare it, and my husband, (also not that close to eggplant) liked it alot.

I made this dish last night for dinner and I took everyones comments into consideration. I thought it came out quite well. Here's what I did: I used the crushed red pepper instead of the chile, I used 1 cup low sodium chicken broth and 1/4 cup wine (zinfandel in this case), I used half and half instead of whipping cream to save on some calories, and I only used as much oil as I needed to cook the eggplant and meatballs (probably used about half of the 7 Tbs.). I noticed the sauce seemed a little thin, so I mixed some flour with warm water and added to the sauce to thicken it. My husband really liked it and so did I. I will definitely make this again.

I read the reviews first so I took some of the advise given. I used roma tomatoes, 1 lb of turkey italian sausage, but had the serranos in my garden. I also used roasted garlic chicken broth and added flour to thicken the sauce. While labor intensive - all the chopping - it was a solid dish. Very similar to a cover dish from Bon Appetit about a year or so ago, which is one we make each summer when the basil, tomatoes and peppers are easily available in the garden.

I make recipes exactly as written the first time, to get a feel for them. I did the same with this one. I mmust admit, I was disappointed. The sauce didn't come together for me; I didn't think the chiles (in such small quantity) added enough zip; it didn't 'gel'. It wasn't bad, and I'm going to try it again with spicier sausage (I think the brand I used was disappointing too), and red chile flakes.

Excellent! As other reviwers suggested, I also halved the amount of sausage and substituted red pepper flakes for the chilies. In addition, I used chopped roma tomatoes instead of cherry, added a minced shallot a half pound of sliced mushrooms, and thickened the sauce with some flour. Finally, I used rotini instead of penne, and after cooking & draining the pasta, I added it to the sauce, mixed well, and let the whole thing simmer together for an extra ten minutes. Great with a salad and some bruschetta on the side.

Yummy! I did not use the chilis, but used 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper. I cut the sausage down to 1 pound (THERE WAS PLENTY OF IT). I couldn't find cherry tomatoes, so I used Roma tomatoes instead. I cored and seeded them...the taste was great, presentation colorful and reviews forthcoming!!!

This pasta dish was really wonderful. Despite having so many ingredients, the flavors melded together nicely. I agree with the other reviewers - no need for the serrano chile, especially when using a hot sausage. I also agree with cutting down on the olive oil. It can become too greasy. We will keep this in our rotation!

To die for! I didn't use the serrano chile; I just used 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes. I also think you can cut the amount of sausage used by half.

My husband and I thought this was delicious - even the next day. I ran out of fresh Parmesan and rather than use the grated stuff, I used a little fresh mozzarella the next day... equally delicious. Also, I think the serrano was unnecessary - a little crushed red pepper would do the trick nicely. Definitely something I'd make for a casual get-together with friends.

I thought this was okay, not great, but my husband liked it a lot. I added the eggplant back to the sauce sooner to make it softer and creamier. You don't need olive oil to cook the sausage balls (a somewhat time-consuming but very nice touch; I used spicy italian turkey sausage to be lower in fat). The eggplant, basil, and nuts (I used walnuts) really make the pasta--otherwise, it's just another tomato cream sauce with sausage. I might make it again--think it would be nicer with rigatoni.
