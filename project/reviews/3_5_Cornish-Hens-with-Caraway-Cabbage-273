Well worth the time it takes to make. Excellent sauce and everyone loved the cabbage. Served with roast goose!

so maybe i am not qualified to review this because i only used this recipe as a way to use up some cabbage i had around. but i loved the cabbage (didn't use cheesecloth, sprinkled the caraway seeds right in- delicious)and so i will gladly try the rest of the recipe sometime soon. in case anyone is interested, i served the caraway cabbage with "pork chops with mustard crust" found on this site, sour cream mashed potatoes, and dark beer. mmm. fall.

This recipe uses too many pots,pans and utensils for me to repeat it. I probably will modify only because my husband raved about how delicious it was. I did use Kelli's suggestions and also seasoned bird with garlic salt and rubbed with duck fat.

The recipe turned out better than I thought it would in the tasting. The cabbage was so blah that I thought this was going to be a loser in the tasting of the parts. But when you toss in the prosutto and put it all together it comes out OK. I guess the bottom line is don't use faith - the sauce and the whole package saves all.

Okay, here's how you do this recipe: add way more chicken broth to cabbage and let simmer longer. I used 1/4 of a regular cabbage. Use regular salty, fatty broth, just don't add extra salt. Add red wine instead of white wine. Roast the hens in a roaster, not a cookie sheet. After you've reduced the sauce, add it to the juices at the bottom of the roaster--yummy. Fed it to 5 jet lagged Brits who vacuumed it up.

For the expense and trouble of this dish, I just didn't think it was anything special. I was particularly disappointed in it as a way to use the lovely Savoy cabbage from my garden, which is the reason I had tried it in the beginning. The sauce was delicious, but the rest is just so-so.

any thing that has to do with cabbage, is yummy for your tummy!
