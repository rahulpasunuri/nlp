Tastes just like the tzatziki they serve at our favorite Greek restaurant. I followed the recipe exactly.

I really enjoyed the taste of this tzatziki. It complemented the falafel nicely. Followed the recipe exactly.

Didn't add tomato, but did add cumin. Delish and simple. Better the next day.

A lovely and simple version of Tzatziki. Having recently returned from Istanbul, it doesn't quite measure up but if you slowly add more garlic and put it through a press instead of mincing; I think you will enjoy it.

I have made this twice from my Bon Appetit cookbook; very disappointed both times. It just doesn't taste good. I used Greek yogurt instead of straining. Looked up another tzatziki recipe online and realized that this was missing the olive oil and lemon juice. I also felt that it wasn't garlicky enough. Added 2 tbsp olive oil, 2 tsp fresh lemon juice (or juice from one lemon) and another two garlic cloves. Bingo! I have made the changes in ink in my cookbook. Ate it with fishcakes and fries instead of tartar sauce. Yum! (p.s., 3 cups of yogurt is A LOT. Even 1 1/2 cups is a lot. Just FYI).

I made this tzatziki to accompany some pork souvlaki that I had grilled up...it was wonderful despite the garlic that I used being not so fresh. I loved that it was so easy and yet tasted so fresh!

I have reviewed this recipe previously. Check 10/21/03 for my comments. In addition, I have a new comment. Serve with toasted pita bread. I brush the whole pita with olive oil, sprinkle with kosher salt, and then cut into 8 wedges with a pizza cutter. Toast at 350º until crispy. So delicious!

Greek yoghurt is made from cow's milk and is already strained, so you can omit this step. The fat-free version is incredibly thick and rich, so you can eat as much as you want with no guilt. I also omitted the tomato and adjusted the quantity of ingredients to suit a small container of yoghurt. It was delicious!

I used a goat full milk yogurt, upped the garlic, left the rest, omitted tomato as it goes on the sandwich I was making. I do have a ?? - is all Greek yogurt goat milk? I do not tolerate cow's milk or beef products can someone let me know as we have a wonderful Mediterrean market here in Mpls. that carries it and the label did not distinguish what kind of milk.

It was dill-icious. However, for maximum awesome put in yellow heirloom tomatoes and 2 cloves of garlic. P.S. Instead of straining the yoghurt for 3 hours, we just dumped it in. This technique maximizes awesome while minimizing time.

OMG, this is sooo good! I had left over shish kabob from a really great Mediteranean restaurant and wanted a sauce for it. I made this recipe using extra garlic and real Greek yogurt. I also added a little lemon juice. (No olive oil as suggested by others. No need for the extra calories) I also did not add tomato- not authentic. The taste is so fresh with the grated cucumber and so incredibly easy to make. Tip- salt your cucumber as it's draining for added flavor. Delish!

Great recipe! I omitted the sour cream, used Greek yogurt instead of regular to eliminate having to drain, and omitted the tomato. Other than that, the spices and everything were perfect. Plenty of garlic! If you use non fat yogurt (Trader Joe's carries it), it is fat free!

This needed to sit after prep for about 1 hour, because the flavors had to meld. Right after I made it, it still tasted way too "yogurt-y."

Easy recipe. I did not strain the yogurt, it was fine. I added way more dill and more garlic. I also skipped the tomato, but added a bit more cucmbers. So maybe I didn't use this recipe after all! But it was delicous!

This is an excellent version of tzatziki! We omit the tomato and increased the dill to probably 1/2 cup because we LOVE dill. Strain your yogurt on paper towel rather than cheesecloth (much easier to come by here) and make the whole recipe in the food processor for ease. Ours kept well for about one week in the fridge and is better the next day. This is definitely a keeper!

I like garlic, so I too added more than the recipe indicated. Unfortunately, I didn't have the luxury of leaving it overnight, so I left it out at room temperature for a couple of hours and it seemed like the flavors mixed pretty well, although I'm sure it'll be better today. I just realized I forgot the tomato, but it can't be that much of a loss because my guests didn't complain!

I followed others suggestions and added extra garlic, salt and pepper. We found it a little bland and used a stick blender to really blend the flavors together. It made all the difference. It also helped to let it sit overnight. Definitely a keeper, especially good because Germans know how to make yogurt.

I did not use any tomato and more garlic as per the other reviews. It was good, but it was a little bit bland. I was wondering if I would have salted the cucumbers when draining that the dip would have had a bit more flavour? And I bet it tastes better the next day - mine only sat for a couple of hours. Draining the yoghurt and cucumbers is a must (cheesecloth costs next to nothing) - I couldn't believe how much liquid came out!! And this made the dip really nice and thick and rich.

I was really looking fwd to this tzatziki, but it didn't turn out well at all. Mine was bland and unexciting. I would definitely take the advice of the others and add PLENTY of garlic. Other than that, I'm not sure where I went wrong...

Refreshing. Sliced the tomatoes about a half an inch thick and then topped with the Tzatziki. Salad-like. Terrific with lamb.

I made this for company with a chicken dish. The chicken went over ok, but I had to wrestle the tzatziki away from the guests to have some for the leftover chicken. Like the previous cooks, I also omitted the tomatoes and upped the garlic. It's a fantastic summer side, really refreshing.

Tzatziki is not typically made with tomatoes, in Greece or anywhere. I would recommend Nigella Lawson's tzatziki with mint & garlic - it's awesome & typical of what you'd find in Greece.

I made the best tzatziki from this recipe... i omitted the tomatos... just didn't seem right... i doubled the garlic and added 2 tsp of olive oil, because i am a garlic and olive oil lover and some of the reviews suggested it... it was wonderful... the first taste made me think the garlic was too much... but the following day it was perfect... my suggestion, double the garlic, while the yogurt and cucumbers are straining on cheescloth, marinade the garlic in the salt, white pepper and olive oil, and allow the prepared tzatziki to "marinade" overnight... delicious...

We just returned from Greece where we enjoyed Tzatziki at every dinner. This recipe is great, especially the tips on straining the cuccumber and yogurt. I skipped the tomato (not authentic) and on the advice from several adorable elderly Greek chefs added 1 tablespoon olive oil to the garlic and finish with 1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano. Serve with fresh bread cubes and crudites. Yummy!

Great summer side sauce with anything spicy! I used more garlic and more dill (but then I always use more garlic than standard recipes call for). Guests loved it!

I rarely make a roast leg of lamb because my husband refuses to eat leftover lamb. I made the tzatziki sauce to go with the roast and we were fighting over the lamb leftovers for the first time in 38 years. I would make it again, but I'm going to have to buy a bigger roast next time.

I loooove tzatziki and don't get to my favorite greek restaurant very often. I think this recipe is great, especially if you triple the amount of garlic. If you let it sit overnight, the yogurt absorbs the garlic and it's just delicious.

I first tried the recipe using what I thought was a good store bought tzatziki, but when I finally gave this recipe a try it has changed my outlook on time consuming recipes. I will now make the time to do it right. Awesome taste. My guests are always amazed.

A note to those looking for whole yogurt (not fat free or lowfat) ...try checking a natural (health) foods store. I get gorgeous Stonyfield Farm brand there which is organic and has the layer of cream on the top.

If you have trouble finding plain yogurt that is not fat-free or non-fat, look for labling marked "baltic style" yogurt. It is usually found at shops specializing in middle-eastern products and in some supermarkets in Canada and the US. JT

Make it like they do in Greece and add olive oil (good virgin highest quality) and either lemon juice or a touch of vinegar. You can make it with the lowfat yogurt if you add the oil. We use it on lamb, as a salad dressing, and I like it on sandwiches. My kids eat it over chopped cucumbers.

Having lived in Greece for 18 years, it is difficult to return to the States and NOT find good plain, thick yogurt...So, I make my own! Here is an easy recipe that can be used in many different ways:1/3 cup powdered skim milk; 1 quart fresh milk, whole or skim, 1/4 cup prepared yogurt, room-temperature, to use as starter. Mix powdered milk into fresh milk and heat to 112 degrees F. which is hot enough to stick a finger in . Remove from heat. Pour into small individual jelly/jam canning jars and cover with lids or put entire mixture into a covered bowl. Wrap jars or bowl in a heavy towel. Set in a warm place away from drafts for 6-8 hours (overnight). A gas oven with pilot is often just right. Otherwise, place a saucepan filled with hot water in the oven to raise the temperature. When prepared, store in refrigerator. For an authentic "Greek" version, try making with "Goat's milk."

This turned out great. I did add olive oil, thought it needed it.

I learned to make tzatziki in Greece, from a native. They add olive oil and vinegar to theirs. I find it a wonderful dip. The tomatoes are a great addition as long as they are the fresh, homegrown kind, not the kind you usually find in the supermarket. Also-it is difficult to "de-seed" the tomatoe, although it, of course, can be done. Also-I find if I use two 32oz containers of yogurt, I make a good quantity. I must note, however, that I have a great difficulty finding plain yogurt that is not fat-free or low-fat.
