Added lemon, feta instead of Parmesan, crushed red pepper for some heat. Excellent weeknight farmers market meal. I actually really liked the boiled beets- roasted are delicious but I liked the different taste of the boiled since every restaurant seems to roast. Also I added black beans because I wanted some protein and it was all we had- they were surprisingly good.

Following others' suggestions I roasted my beets--tossed them in olive oil and roasted on a baking tray until soft, after about half an hour at 325. I also replaced the parmesan with goat cheese and caramelized the onions over low heat for about 2 hours. The result was truly delicious--worth four forks with the changes.

my 7yo and 4yo loved this pasta. i didn't add goat cheese and did not miss it. however, i did add lemon and subbed swiss chard for the beet greens. the carmelized onions and garlic take this pasta dish over the top!

This was shockingly good; it really deserved the four forks after the adaptions mentioned in the comments. I roasted my beets (and used a mix of red and gold from the CSA box). I used spinach instead of beet greens as I'd already eaten the greens earlier in the week. When seasoning, I added the juice and zest of one lemon and a sprinkling of aleppo pepper. And I used some goat cheese, some parm. While it was very good with the goat cheese, it wasn't nearly as essential as I'd been led to believe! The dish was beautiful and much tastier than expected.

This is a fantastic recipe. Of course, everything I used was super fresh: I pulled five healthy golden beets from our garden, used fresh onions from the farmer's market, and also had fresh garlic from our garden. I roasted the beets as a few readers suggested, and put the liquid at the bottom of the foil in the pasta at the end. The flavours were just perfect, with a nice balance between the greens and the sweet beets. Also, the pine nuts added a nice texture. Can't wait to make it again with our remaining beets.

I like this. I made the recipe with just one onion and deglazed the pan with a little balsamic vinegar before adding the beet greens. I also used whole wheat fusilli that I had on hand. The finished product is simple but good. Seems like it could benefit from sitting in the fridge overnight to let flavors blend. I suppose I see what others mean about it not having that special oomph, and I might not make it for company, for me it's great -- just the sort of simple, healthy meal I enjoy.

Good base recipe, but it could benefit from some of the punchier ingredients that other reviewers added: goat cheese, lemon zest or a squeeze, maybe a little vinegar for deglazing, etc. The dish was filling and tasted great, but on its own it lacks the umami and balance required of a one-dish meal.

So I've made this twice, once with some subs as suggested: goat cheese, roasted beets, chard for beet greens and my husband raved. Tonight I made it pretty straight except for subbing whole wheat penne for farfalle, Edible but not the WOW I got the first time. Thanks all for the suggestions and thanks Epicurious for providing the root recipe.

I wrote the review just below this one. I meant to say that I roasted the beets before making this dish. Wrap beets in foil, put in 400 to 450 oven for 60 to 90 minutes, then remove and peel off skin.

Superb dish. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of subbing goat cheese for parmesan and pistachios for pine nuts. This was the hit of a pot luck dinner.

Excellent. I usually hate everything I make with beets but this was superb! I used my farm share mix of gold, candy stripe, and red beets. No beet greens or pine nuts so I subbed kale and pistachios. I also added 4 oz goat cheese to the 1/2 oz Parmesan I had on hand. I know this isn't the prescribed recipe but I loved it enough to actually comment and I definitely intend to make it again as written!

So fresh, delicious, and satisfying! I would give it 3.5 forks. I picked up golden beets from the farmers' market and asked for the extra greens; so I had a mixture of red and golden beet greens which gave a beautiful rosy gold color to the dish. I made a few additional adjustments -- after caramelizing the onions I deglazed the pot with a little white balsamic vinegar. Then once I mixed the pasta in with the veggies, I mixed in lemon zest and juice from half a small lemon. Topped it with a little Grana Padano and a few crumbles of goat cheese on the beets. Otherwise, I followed the recipe pretty closely. I will make this again and again, for guests too as it is a beautiful and tasty dish!

Rating: 3
This was good, not great. The golden beets were VERY mild, maybe I would try roasting instead of boiling them, which I think makes them lose some of their flavor. The onions were really really good- I used half sweet onion, half shallot, and added a little butter with the OO. Added some arugula in with the beet greens. I think it had a nice flavor, but needs a little punch. I was thinking of replacing the beets with roasted heirloom cherry tomatoes next time, to add a little acid to the sweetness of the onions and cheese. Would make again, but not with beets.

Delicious way to use up beets from CSA! I would omit the "pasta water" next time, ours was a bit too wet. I always like to add a little spice with red pepper flakes too!

I love the fact that you can use every part of the beet in this recipe--beet greens are truly delicious. I think the quality of the beets is really what makes this recipe--my beets did not have the intensity of flavor that I was hoping for, but I'll be sure to get fresh and juicy beets next time.

This is a perfect fall farmer's market dish. I broke my own epi rule by making a lot of substitutions: red beets for golden beets, walnuts for pine nuts, creamy goat cheese instead of parmesan, and linguini for farfalle pasta. The technique of caramelizing the onions and boiling the pasta in the beet water built great flavor. The pasta tinted to a beautiful pumpkin orange (instead of the pink mentioned by other reviewwers) creating a vibrant orange, red, and green presentation. The rest is up to your preferencces. I don't think you can go wrong with this one.

I've made this one a couple of times. It's great if you want something homey, sweet and warm. I've had a few friends request me to make this for them when they stay over as well, so it's not just my own word that this is good stuff! As it states in the recipe you can make this a "pink" dish by using red beets instead of golden, which is great if you've got a little girl in your family.

Rating: 3
This recipe was a great intro for me to the wonderful world of golden beets; all of the beet yumminess, none of the beet mess! And adding the beet cooking water to the dish is a great way to preserve some of the nutrients otherwise lost by boiling. I used whole wheat shells instead of farfalle and walnuts instead of pine nuts.

Rating: 4
This recipe was so quick, easy and yummy! We got golden, but mostly red beets in our CSA this week. I cooked the pasta in the beet water and it turned out a beautiful pink. My husband, who doesn't like beets at all, said this pasta was delicious. The only thing I changed was I used fettucini instead of the farfalle because I didn't have any. This is a definite keeper!

THIS RECIPE IS FABULOUS . I added peas fresh from the garden and used toasted pecans as well as part shallots and part onions and it was amazing. I usually roast beets but boiled them as the recipe said and I think it was a great idea: the water was flavored wonderfully and then adding that water to the sauce was great. this was much better than I expected.

Made this last night with organic beets and pasta from farmers' market. Very tasty. To cook beets - make a large packet out of tin foil (I know, I know, this is a wasteful use of resources), toss in beets, a little olive oil and pepper, seal and bake for 60-90 minutes. Beets come out meltingly tender.

This is tasty. There are similar recipes that are also good. I will put this one in the rotation. I always chop the stems and saute them with the onions. Why waste good fiber and vitamins? It doesn't appreciable change the flavor.

I've made this a few times, and it's always been pretty good, but tonight it was amazing. I was out of onion so used shallots, which might have made the difference. They became quite sweet, which got me to thinking that some golden raisins could be really good in this too. I always throw some chevre on at the end for extra goodness. A tasty, healthy way to use beet greens!

I liked this quite a lot--the pasta takes a nice mellow flavor from the beets. I made it exactly as the recipe specified, except that I used red beets rather than golden ones. Very tasty, although I think it probably could use a bit more salt than I used.

I was skeptical about the boiled beets, but this was delicious. I used red beets (pasta turns a pretty orange color) and added arugula to beet greens (gave it a nice spicy taste). Also I added leeks with onions and tossed with feta cheese. My whole family liked this -- and it was really easy and toothsome.

Would be exceptional if the beets were roasted. Boiling the beets takes out so much of the flavor. I also used spinach instead of beet greens (my beets did not have greens).

My husband and I loved this recipe, but the kids did not. Both kids do not tend to like beets, although they love beet greens, so not a huge surprise. I plan on freezing some of the leftovers for lunches during the week. You can easily peel beets after you roast the beets whole, or cut in half in they are large. Just let them cool and the peel slides off.

This is delicious and I like it best with golden beets. I have made this four times and never found the beet greens to be bitter when they are fresh. Though it does need both onions, I tried one tonight and it wasn't quite enough!

Delisch! I found one very large onion to be quite enough and used the great carmelizing suggestion from Ellie_B below. Worked great! Also, roasted and peeled beets in advance and heated in microwave when ready to add. Used 1 - 2 T. of olive oil and it was plenty. Husband doesn't like beets, so added some roasted red and yellow peppers to his - loved it. Also -- used goat cheese instead of parm which lended a lovely creaminess to the dish. Can't wait to eat the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.

Love it. (Pink pasta is so much fun.) Every time my CSA gives me beets, I make this dish. I don't find the greens bitter at all. Carmelizing the onions does take a bit of time, but it adds flavor. This is delicious!

This was really really good! I loved it, my husband loved it and my three year old son, who usually takes an hour and a half to eat dinner, ate it all up and asked for more! I used some Parmesan cheese but also added a bit of feta which went really well. I also used whole wheat thin spaghetti because I didn't have farfalle on hand. Otherwise I made as directed. YUM! I will be making this again.

This was quite easy but I did not like the beet greens as much as I thought I would. I even made it a second time (I love golden beets) with gorganzola cheese and walnuts instead of pine nuts and parmesan, and I still though the greens were a bit bitter.

This was great. We cut up and roasted red beets and added goat cheese as recommended. Also threw in some chick peas for protein. Delicious and easy, plus we felt virtuous for eating up the beet greens.

Delicious! Thanks to other reviewers for the tips - I roasted the beets and served this without the pasta with an ounce of goat cheese melting over each serving instead of the parmesan (or whatever the recipe called for). Maybe my beets were extra-large but I would probably cut them smaller next time as some pieces were far more than a mouthful. Will definitely be making this again in all sorts of ways. I really want to try it on a wood-fired white pizza!

This is a ridiculously delicious and healthy meal, fit for everyday dinners or weekend company. I've used baby spinach or rainbow chard instead of beet greens when the greens don't look that hot, and I grill the beets rather than boil them, and use chicken broth in place of the cooking liquid. Great on whole wheat pasta of any size and shape. This is a definite keeper.

This was so so not fab but we had some golden beets we wanted to use. I would make it again but would definately add some spice. Maybe some spicy chicken sausage and change out the cheese to some goat cheese.

Following up on my resolution to eat more like a Mediterranean (see also Tunisian Soup with Chard, Chick Peas, and Egg Noodles), I jumped at the chance to try this unusual veggie/pasta/nut combination. As a bonus for those trying to be extra- virtuous in the kitchen, this recipe features an eco-friendly "snout to tail" approach to beets, using both the greens and the beets themselves. In my hands, there was no need to add a full cup of pasta cooking liquid -- a few splashes sufficed. My carnivore husband was slow to warm to this recipe, and so I had the leftovers for lunch the following day. These were greatly enhanced by the addition of crumbled aged goat cheese (Boucheron), which added creaminess and complemented the beets beautifully -- I will be sure to add these when I make the recipe again. I also modified the onion caramelization steps, using Mark Bittman's foolproof trick of placing thinly sliced onions directly in a dry med-high pan, with the lid on, for 5 minutes -- butter/oil is added after the onions have wilted and browned. I have come to believe that this is the quickest and most consistent way of caramelizing onions. Overall, a great, healthy recipe!

I really enjoyed this. I didn't have pine nuts, but think they would be a good addition. I also used goat cheese and think next time I'd try feta. Don't be afraid to salt and roasting the beets would take longer, but might give it more flavor.

This was tasty! We especially loved that it turned red with red beets-a happy Valentine's Day coincidence since I couldn't find golden beets. I might try feta next time instead of Parmesan for some extra flavor. I'll make this again in the summer when beets are plentiful!

This is delicious! I omitted the onion, just sauteed the garlic and a half a shallot in the oil before adding the beet greens, added some chopped kale and one crumbled browned italian sausage (which sort of spoils the vegetarian aspect but was very yummy)...oh yes, I also used fettucine instead of farfalle.

A very unique dish that we really liked! Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change anything except would add more greens next time -- the greens from 2 bunches of beets were not enough for us. Also, did not need any of the pasta water -- it was plenty moist already. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

Like many of the other reviewers, I decided to roast the beets (and then used chicken broth since I didnt have any beet water). I was hesitant to sauté the onions as long as the recipe called for  and to use TWO large ones  but it turned out perfectly! I chopped three garlic cloves, again as the recipe called for, but used two of them and would probably reduce even that (and Im a garlic lover). I felt the amount of greens was fine  and love the idea of adding chicken to increase the protein. Ill try that another time.

I used whole wheat pasta and also roasted the golden beets. I also did not add the second 2 TBL olive oil it called for when adding the beet greens to the onions, as mine had enough oil. Added a touch of fresh nutmeg and red pepper flakes when sauteeing greens, and added 2 cubed, skinless chiken breasts to up the protein. Recipe was delicious and unique and easy to prepare! Next time I'll add more greens (chard, kale, or spinach) because I didn't think there were enough from just the beets.

Really good, and even better the next day. I didn't know if I liked beets, but they're good: like carrots' more flamboyant cousin. I roasted the beets (used 4 red) and garlic cause I had time to spare.

Great flavors and textures. I don't know if it had anything to do with having boiled the beets in the pasta water before putting the pasta in, but when dried pasta was added to the water it immediately boiled over, so go slow when adding pasta.

We boiled the beets whole first to speed the peeling process. Otherwise we followed the recipe with substitution of walnut oil. The garlic was properly a background flavor. If you buy the beets with nice looking greens, be sure to use them! They have a great flavor and are exceedingly nutritious. I used red beets because their greens looked better than the golden ones.

Rating: 4
delicious and healthy! the flavors from the ingredients went together so well, we were very surprised. i didn't use the beet greens because they had to sit in the fridge for a couple days longer than planned - the dish was great nonetheless. don't worry about using red beets - it does turn the pasta pink but who cares. i plan to omit the garlic next time, i thought it detracted from the other flavors (but if you love it, keep it in). i second the other reviewers who roasted the beets - keeps the nutrients and peeling was simple. one question - when you roast them, are you supposed to dose them with olive oil first? enjoy!

My partner and I agree that this is by far the best vegetarian dish that we have ever tasted! We eliminated the beet greens but may try them in this dish the next time. Golden beets are essential to this recipe to maintain the beautiful warm yellow color of the pasta. We served with additional Parmesan cheese and it was great.

I made this with two other girl friends for a girl's night dinner. We followed the other reviewer's suggestion and roasted the beets and garlic for approx. 35 min at 425 degrees. We also finished the dish with Hawaiian Black sea salt and white truffle oil. It was AMAZING! Enjoy!

This is a great winter recipe. My husband loved it. I also found peeling all the beets quite a chore and wished I had roasted them mostly to save my fingers. Overall, more time consuming than I hoped but what great flavors! Stick with Parmesan.

I liked this, but if I were to make it again, I would do a few things differently. First, while I think that boiling the beets was a quick and easy way to cook them, I would probably roast them in order to get a better flavor. The onions take 40 minutes to cook, so what's 50 for the beets to roast? I would then cut them into smaller pieces. I might roast the garlic along with it, but I might do it the same way as I did this time. This time, by the way, was not exactly how the recipe said to do it. I felt that the garlic would have burned had I added the beet greens and then covered the pan, so I deglazed with white whine first, and I figure that probably helped to tenderize the beet greens. The pine nuts were perfect, particularly if you manage not to burn them like I ALWAYS do. I think that goat cheese would probably be a better cheese than Parmesan, and I might try it next time. This dish might even be really yummy with some bacon, prosciutto or pancetta, but that would turn a relatively healthy dish into a not-so-healthy one.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish. It makes a simple, tasty vegetarian main or would work in small portions alongside a meat. I used baby beets and thought the peeling process was too tedious. Next time I will roast the beets and just pop them out of their skins.
