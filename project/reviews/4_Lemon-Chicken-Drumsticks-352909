Great weeknight recipe! the lemon sauce is such a stand-out, especially in winter when bright flavors are great for waking up the pallette!

This was a quick and easy recipe. I only marinated the chicken for an hour and it had plenty of flavor. I used 3 drumsticks and 3 thighs, but kept the maridade recipe the same. I didn't have fresh thyme, so I used 2 tsp of dried thyme. I'm happy I did not cut the maridade recipe in half as the reduced pan juices were so good. I cooked it at 400 degrees for 1 hour and then broiled it for 8 mins, 4 mins on each side to brown the skin. The chicken was very moist. This was great!

Always room for an easy, tasty chicken dish and this is one. Usually I try to marinate overnight and find chicken browns well and stays moist when cooked at a highish temp in the middle of the oven, turned once half way. Gets a bit smokey, but hey, that's what browning chicken skin does! Happily adaptable recipe, great for adults and children, great cold, travels well. If that is a genre, it probably deserves 4 forks.
