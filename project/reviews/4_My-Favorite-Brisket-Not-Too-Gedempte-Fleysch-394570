This recipe is delicious. I think I used a shoulder roast and was a little nervous about it because my boyfriend is Jewish and tends to rave about a particular brisket made by a friend. I made this recipe on a whim, pretty much following instructions except I substituted dried rosemary and it all got eaten, which in this house is a true achievement!
