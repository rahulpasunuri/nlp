My family loves this recipe! I have made it for years. It's easy for a quick dinner next to some sautéed green beans on a weekday night or for company with the ginger fried rice recipe they give on the weekend - not being stuck in the kitchen slaving away! The only suggestion I have is to double the sauce.

No fail, easy and tastes delicious. Produces a very impressive end result. We use this recipe often.

Good and easy. I would say that I'm partial to teriyaki, which is similar to this, but more complex in flavor

OK recipe. There are much more interesting and flavorful recipes for salmon out there. I will say it is quick. The sauce burnt on the bottom of my broiler pan setting of the smoke detector and making my house smell like burnt food.You could probably put parchment paper or even foil under the salmon to stop this.

This is one of my favorites recipes to use in the firehouse. So simple and quick it is one of the guys favorites. I add a little garlic and crushed red pepper to give just a tad amount of heat. Makes me look like super chef, little do they know.

THE BEST SALMON IV'E EVER HAD!! I made this for my mom and aunt on christmas eve and both of them said it was amazing!! I hope Bon Appetit gives epicurious more great recipies like this.

This was tasty and easy to make. The glaze tasted more like soy sauce than maple to me. So, my suggestion would be to increase the proportion of maple syrup a bit in the glaze to get more of that maple taste.

I have a go-to salmon glaze that calls for hoisin sauce and honey and a few other things. I went to make it and found out I was out of both the hoisin and the honey. Whoops. Found maple syrup and soy in the cabinet, and did a quick search to see what Epicurious would give me and - presto! Almost comically perfect. There should be a button where you can enter the ingredients you have on hand and Epicurious gives you a recipe.

I made this in a one portion size, with an added squeeze of lemon juice and a bit of crushed red pepper in the glaze. The glaze tastes really nice, not too sweet. However, the salmon itself was not the best, and I think it's because today's typical salmon cannot withstand this dry, high heat style of cooking; it's just not tasty enough. I purchased wild alaskan salmon, not farmed, paying a premium, but not from a fancy store--from trader joe's. It was $10.99 a pound. I think this recipe would have been great using a really expensive, high quality wild salmon from a high end store like gelson's or whole foods, but that typically costs $25-$30 a pound. If that kind of expense is what's necessary to make this recipe taste good, I don't think it warrants a good rating. That is especially because I think the glaze, while very tasty, is too unrefined to put on something that expensive.

I love this simple, delicious recipe! For me, cooked salmon must be moist and must not have all sorts of herbs and seeds. The simpler the better, in fact. On that front this recipe is perfect. On the other hand, your salmon may come out a tad under cooked if your salmon is thicker than 1 1/2 inches but you still follow the timing provided. So, pay attention to the size of your salmon fillet.

Very simple and nice. I cooked it in a plain glass dish with the salmon placed on top of several thick lemon slices. Like others, I added some ginger toward the end of reducing. A friend from Japan was visiting and loved it.

Rating: 3
This is a great quick/easy meal that can be "dressed-up". I added garlic & crushed red pepper to the marinade for an extra little "love" & it turned out awesome! the key is to save some sauce to brush on after it's broiled. It's a paired up with a wonderful spinach salad!

Didn't have any maple syrup left, so I substituted with brown sugar syrup(1/4c butter, 1/4c brown sugar).I don't know how it tastes with maple syrup but, WOW! The wife and kids gobbled it up.

This is very good if you add some lime juice. I think i used about a teaspoon, and it makes all the difference.

I was expecting more, I guess. Maybe the syrup I used wasn't tasty enough because this just came out bland. I would try throwing different ingredients in the glaze next time to spice it up a bit.

Very nice! BUT -- I make double the amount of glaze, and I slice up the fillet into serving sizes, then brush with glaze multiple times before cooking.Always turns out great.

Rating: 2
Very quick. Tasted pretty good on its own but didn't stick to the fish, so didn't add much flavor to the fish itself. Did add garlic and ginger, but still needs a little tweaking.

Rating: 2
It was ok... I would have liked it much more if the glaze wasn't so watery. It was watery and thin, deffinitally lacking. A little more soy taste, and a crisper thicker glaze would have made this better, but after many tries it still came out inconsistantly the same. This recipe needs work

So simple yet so yummy! I served this with steamed veggies, rice and a lovely Santa Barbara viogner. Just lovely! However, I wonder if you really need to broil it at the end. Hmmm...

Complimentary flavors:maple syrup,soya and salmon but would score salmon fillets next time to allow glaze to absorb into the fish more.

No big deal. I have had much better soy glazes before.

Rating: 3
The maple syrup and soy sauce combination is a good and unusual one, but the addition of pressed garlic, grated ginger and cayenne pepper improves the flavour dramatically (as suggested by previous reviewers). I marinated the fish slightly longer than recommended and skipped the glaze reduction step, with excellent results (NOTE: Be cautious in your use of both the maple syrup and the soy sauce, since too much of either can be overpowering- I recommend adjusting the amounts used slowly, tasting the glaze as you go until you find the balance that suits you). The "returns to effort" ratio is unbeatable!

Rating: 4
I make this salmon frequently on the special request of my 11 year old daughter (who is often very picky). I have added chopped garlic and ginger and i prefer to use low sodium soy sauce. I would definitly recommend this recipe.

Rating: 4
I made this dish with only 2 small filets, so that may have accounted for some of the excessive smoke and burning of the glaze during the brioling phase. Still, the fish did not burn and it was quite good. My husband enjoyed it too. I added cayenne pepper ('another notch') which I think balanced the sweetness of the syrup. I will make this again.

World's Fastest Dinner - I too had a lovely Copper River salmon portion, though a slim fellow, so I omitted the bake and went directly to broil. I also added a touch more soy sauce and barely waved the cayenne pepper over it in the end. Served with the wonderfully quick Fall River wild rice and a spinach salad featuring Mandarin orange slices and cashews, a peanut oil/white Balsamic/orange juice dressing; it was ALL ready in less than 15 minutes.

I'm a realtor who values recipes that taste good and don't take a lot of time (I don't have) or ingredients (I don't have) and the grill is my first choice for dinner. As suggested, at the end of reduction, I added 1/2 tsp. ea. fresh ginger and garlic to the glaze, grilled the salmon 4 minutes/side, finishing with the skin side down. Glazed after the first turn. When cooked, slid a spatula between skin and flesh and plated, drizzling remaining glaze over filets. A keeper!

I made this last night, and it was very good. I added some grated ginger to the sauce, but I still think it need a little something else. Garlic? My boyfriend thought it was fabulous, though. It was very easy to make, and I'll definitely cook it again. I just need to tweak it somehow...

I've made this three times and have found my own winning version. I double the glaze (though I use a larger fillet), but change the ratio to 2/3 soy 1/3 maple syrup and add a little ginger and garlic near the end of the reduction. I then brush the fillet several times over the course of 2 hours prior to cooking. It's been well-received each time, but this last time was the best!

A family favorite, have made it over 3 times, and the children (2,5,9) LOVE IT!!!! I make no variations as I see so often on epicurious. We will make it again. Simple, delicious, and I cook fish 2x per week......this is a keeper.

My dad loves salmon and asks for this again and again. It is great with something nice and green and sushi rice on the side (it's a nice sweet-tart compliment to the glaze). I do add more soy than maple (taste it begore you use it!!) and fresh ginger. I also marinade the salmon with it about 10 minutes each side, and bake it in the oven sitting in the glaze, which I don't reduce. Yum.

Rating: 2
I don't know. It seems that the receipe is missing that extra something. Next time I will try making the sauce with less honey, lemon, and wasabi power. Did anyone trying marinating the fish first? I prefer Dave's Marinated Salmon receipe for an asian style salmon dinner.

Good.But prefer the recipe in the Jan'03 issue. Here the glaze gets thick/sticky very fast. Need more glaze when done than before cooking.

This was a quick and easy way to make a flavorful dish. I found the cooking times to be off so the second time I cooked it I wrapped the fish in an aluminum foil pouch and baked it for 30 minutes, then stuck it under the broiler uncovered for 10 more minutes. This kept the fish moist and absolutely delicious. Definately make more glaze for dipping. (A little garlic helps too.)

i made this last night for dinner. i followed the recipe exactly, and the only problem was that the glaze that dripped off of the fish into the broiler pan began to burn in the hot oven WAY before the fish was close to being done (it was about 114 degrees in the center when my smoke alarm went off. :) i had to turn off the broiler and let it sit in a 350 degree oven to complete cooking. it tasted great though with lemon juice squeezed over the top!

This has become one of our staples at home, since my husband loves salmon and I love Asian food. The sauce is like a sweeter Teriyaki, and the maple adds nice complexity.

This is a four-star recipe because it is easy, it is good, it is healthy, it is attractive - everything you need. I've used a number of the salmon recipes on this site that have the sweet-sour-salty combinations (the balsamic glazed salmon, the honey and wasabi salmon). They are all very good. This one wins in the "ease" category. I made one change to the sauce. I thought it needed just a bit of acid so I added lemon juice to taste. We had leftover salmon and sauce - my husband added wasabi powder to the leftover sauce and it was unbelieveable! Had it the next day for lunch.

The cooking times were definitely off; I cooked a cute of salmon big enough for 2 and had to broil it for about 10 min after baking for 12-15; still moist and juicy. I also sauted a little finely chopped ginger in unsalted butter before pouring in the soy and maple to glaze. Served this with mashed potatoes and kale sauteed in garlic - wonderful Monday meal! Will definitely make again.
