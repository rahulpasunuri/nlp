To settle the semantics debate: 1lb red peppers 'comma' tender roasted means 1lb before. If 1lb 'already roasted' it would be written 1lb tender roasted red peppers, without a comma. Hope this helps and with many other recipes that could be confusing

To the cooks below: by the time you take out the seeds and ribs before roasting...then rub off the skin after roasting, you're left with a lot less pepper. Having said that, I agree that it is probably still too much for just 1/4 cup of mayo. I suspect this is one of those recipes where you'll need to eyeball the amount of roasted red pepper. Fortunately, leftover roasted red pepper is yummy! Just drizzle with olive oil and balsamic and devour.

I haven't made this either, but it looks good. It appears that the way the recipe is writte (1lb...peppers, roasted) means using one pound before roasting.

I just made this, have yet to use it, will rate it later. But the 1 lb. roasted red peppers is confusing: is that 1 lb. before roasting (which would be two of the peppers I bought at Costco) or 1 lb. after roasting (which is 4 peppers)? It seems too liquid to be called a mayonnaise using a lb. of the already roasted peppers.
