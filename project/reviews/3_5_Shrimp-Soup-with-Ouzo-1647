This soup had very good flavor. I added half of the sauteed shrimp (used brandy) to the pot for the last 45 minutes of reduction, pureed the whole batch, then added the other half of the shrimp after chopping them. Nice complex flavor. I made half the recipe.

very good. if you don't like tomatos, don't put tomatos in because it will become the base. also, put in more ouzo.

I have been making this soup since it was published in 1996. It has great depth of flavour and our guests always love it.

The soup was good but the flavor was too subtle. I added some ouzo to the soup and some marjoram and a little hot sauce.

On sucessive days, I made this soup and the spiced shrimp. The latter was far superior. This soup had a decent flavor, but was fairly thin.It needs to be thickened, maybe by being served over rice. The flavors of the ouzo and fennel were lost.
