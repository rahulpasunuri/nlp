This was my first attempt at pastry cream. Used it as a filling for boston cream pie. I took the other reviewers' advice and used 3T of corn starch. Also the first time I've cooked with a dry vanilla bean. The cream turned out beautifully, was delicious and the recipe yielded more than enough to do the trick. I know I will come back to this recipe again and again.

The most delicious pastry cream I have ever tasted. It tastes like pastry cream you would purchase at the best bakeries in NYC. I have used this pastry cream as a filler in rum cake and it is quite a big hit!

Mediocre at best. Way too much cornstarch, you can even taste it. Cooking time was very inaccurate for me, and the instructions could have been written clearer. I would have thrown it away and tried another recipe instead except that the vanilla bean was so expensive. Won't ever make this recipe again.

Easy and delicious. I used 3 rounded Tbsp. of cornstarch and it came out just right. It made a wonderful filling for a sweet pastry crust, topped with fresh ollalieberries. Yum!

Good flavor and a very simple recipe. There is too much cornstarch in the recipe, I needed to add more milk and cook the pastry cream a little longer than directed to get rid of the cornstarch taste.

I have made this twice, and believe this is too much cornstarch to use. Thickened way too much,tasted "cornstarchy", had to add half and half to save it! Next time I will cut cornstarch in half and see.

Excellent pastry cream! I even used pure vanilla extract in place of the vanilla bean (in a pinch) and whisked it over an ice bath to cool it more quickly. It turned out perfectly.

Very easy to prepare. Perfect color and texture. Sweet, great for a lge fruit tart or many mini tarts. Made first batch with vanilla bean; second batch without. You'll notice a BIG difference in perfume and aroma of the cream as it cooks-use the vanilla if you can.
