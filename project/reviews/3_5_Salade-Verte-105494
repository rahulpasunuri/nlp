I made this without the anisette, it was wonderful. This will hit the spot if you're craving a very green salad and a mighty punch of flavor in the dressing. Next trip to the package store will include some anisette to see if I like it even better.

I have tried many recipes for salad dressings, this I consider one of the finest.
