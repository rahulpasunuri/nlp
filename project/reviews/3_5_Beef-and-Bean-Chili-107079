Very good as we made it, but I made about 1/2 recipe replacing beef broth with 1 pack Knorr Homestyle beef stock and 12 oz. good lager beer; used "Chili Ready" diced tomatoes; 1/2 red onion & 1/2 white onion and smoked sweet paprika (pimenton). We like chunky chili with a thinner broth so I added water as needed.

Great easy recipe for chili con carne with beans. I cook the onions, garlic, jalapenos and beef along with the spices then transfer it to a crock pot and add the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer without the worry of anything burning to the bottom of a pot on the stove.

My friend Darren says this is the best chili he has ever had. I did make a few changes. I used one bottle of Guiness stout in lieu of the the beef broth. Also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Used ground sirloin and it was much better. Did not have to skim any grease. Also added 1 tsp salt. A real keeper. Don't forget the garnishes!

This was pretty good. I used 5 jalapeños instead of 5 tbs. I added 1 cup frozen corn and 2 tsp salt (I used low sodium beans and tomatoes). I made it in slow cooker, cooked on low for 9 hours (browning the meat first). I thought there was a LOT of meat. The ratio of meat to beans seemed off. I might use 1.5 lbs meat next time. I thought it would be soupy in the slow cooker, but not at all. Nice texture.

This is a very good and simple recipe just as is and it lends itself well to your personal additions. The second time around I used Hatch Green Chili instead of the jalapeno and I like mine more saucy so added more tomato - sauce and chopped. I also used a variety of chili powder, ancho and chipoltle with the regular chili powder. Rave reviews all around with little effort overall.

Really good, yet basic recipe. Need to add a little salt. I think topping it with cilantro and green onions adds an excellent punch. Don't be afraid of the jalapeños.

As others have noted, this is a great base recipe. I made it several times exactly as written and have found a couple of tweaks to make it even tastier. 1) When sauteeing the onions, put your dry spices in right away. This "blooms" the spices and brings out a much richer flavor. 2) I found the spice profile still a little lacking, so pureed up a small can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. Add a couple healthy tablespoons of the pureed chipotle in adobo with your wet ingredients and beans. This adds another layer of flavor and a gentle smokiness that enhances the dish noticeably. Trust me on this!

Great base recipe... as I often do, I changed it some. I substituted 4 whole jalapenos, sliced, for "5 taplespoons" and did about 10 garlic cloves, drained half of the tomato juice and substituted 6 of the 14 oz of beef broth for newcastle with a dash of balsamic. I also added some bay leaves and a few other herbs. Added one can of black beans to the pre-existing 2 cans of kidney beans in the recipe, which were also added. It's killer great.

I just made this and it's a good starting point. I used yellow and red onions, because that's all I had. I used canned green chiles, instead of jalapeno's, because that's all I had. I added an extra can of black beans, because I had them......and after letting it simmer for about 40 minutes, I tried it and it was a little bland. I then added 1 chipotle pepper and about a spoonful of adobo sauce, stirred it, tasted it and said, "WAY TOO SPICY FOR ME", so I added some beer. Let it simmer for another 40 minutes and the heat was tolerable. Then I added a little more beer, just because I like beer. I did find that I needed to add salt, and that helped a lot. I'll be making this again and using a good mexican lager, as I've used in my low fat chili making experience. I think that will give it a very nice depth.

A Great Chile! I used used short rib strips pre cut for stir fry instead of ground beef, I let simmer 3 hours before serving to make sure beef was tender. I also streached the batch with a 3rd can of beans & 14 more ounces diced mexican tomatoes. The seasoning still had a great punch! I will make again.

This is a great recipe. I made it almost as written, except I used leftover grilled steak instead of ground beef. My husband loves steak, and I save the leftovers and freeze them until I have enough to make something with them. This gave a great grilled flavor to the chili. I also added 1/2 can of beer. Can't wait to try it with the adobo chilis.

An excellent go-to chili recipe with room for improvisation but also great as written. I usually add more vegies - like a couple of bell peppers, and have also used black beans instead of kidney beans. I've made this chili several times and have stopped looking around for a better recipe because I don't think there is one.

Loved this simple recipe for my first time making chili. Chose to use freshly diced tomatoes, red onions, and jalapenos [no seeds]; black beans instead of kidney. Halved the recipe since it's just me and my fiance' - sure wish I hadn't because it was delicious and we wanted leftovers for our lunches!

My thanks to momneedsideas from Toronto,Canada. I substituted chipotle chilies in adobo sauce for the jalapenos resulting in the deepest most flavorful chili I have ever had. I used somewhere between 1 and 2 Tb of the chopped chilies mixed with adobo sauce adding incrementally to taste, I also made the following changes: yellow onions instead of red, 2 tsp sweet paprika instead of 1, added 2 tsp of ground oregano,2 cans of black beans instead of kidney beans, 1 cup chicken broth in place of beef broth.

I love this recipe because it lends itself to tinkering-you decide how you like it and adjust accordingly. I use only 1lb of lean beef,2 cans of tomato (1 crushed 1 diced) one can each of red kidney,white kidney and black beans. I never have jalapenos on hand, but I always keep a tin of green chilis and chilpotles on hand. One chilpotle diced with about a teaspoon of the adobo sauce it comes in adds a lovely smoky heat-I freeze the rest for the next time.A teaspoon of cocoa as others have suggested adds a nice earthy depth to it. I call this my pantry chili because all the ingredients are usually there!

Made this today for friends. Everyone loved it. I did leave most of the seeds out since we had kids eating too, but put some sliced jalapenos out for the grown ups to add. I also made it with Bison since that's what I had. I will definitely make again!

Good basic recipe. Hold the seeds or you'll pay later. I add a dash or two of Liquid Smoke. I served with white rice, slices of velvetta, diced white onion,saltine crackers, dill pickles, ice cold beer and ice cold sangria. Provide serrano pepper slices for people that want a little more fire. It ain't chile unless you sweat!

I just made this chili and thought it was very good. Great on it's own or also as a good jumping off point for alterations. I used the suggested amount of fresh jalapeno but without the seeds. This gave the chili good flavor and temp but not so hot my 9 yr old was excluded. I think smoked paprika would be good.

Doubled this recipe for a recent football party - it was amazing. Need to use a large skillet when browning onion and the beef to get maxiumum surface area. Tough when doubling so use two pans! Served this in mini-bread boules and folks couldn't get enough!! And this was a tough crowd!

I have been searching for a chili recipe that came out thick and had good flavor and I finally found it! This was delicious. I didn't use the seeds of the chilies for fear of it being too hot, but it didn't have much "kick", so when I make it again I won't be such a wuss and I'll use the seeds. The only other alteration I did was I added red peppers and I let the onion, red pepper, jalapeño mixture cook for longer than suggested. I let everything get a little brown before adding liquids. Did this in my Le Creuset pot and cooked uncovered and it came out nice and thick. Will definitely make again.

This is the best chili recipe! I have tried many over the years (including family recipes) and I think this is a great balance of beans & meat -- but here are my "alterations/additions": *****add 1 14 oz can of TOMATO SAUCE to this and this solves the issue of it not being thick enough! If you want it thicker add a 28 oz can. *****I added additional beans to mine...1 can chili beans, 1 can navy beans to this as well... It is delicious!

Very good basic recipe that my kids loved, although I omitted the jalapenos for their sake. I also added a 6 oz can of tomoto paste to thicken it up, which it really needed -- IMHO I like a more stew- like chili. Served with buttermilk biscuits and salad - yum!

Rating: 3
I have made this three times now with good reviews. We really like the flavor, but it lacks thickness. Most of the ingredients are solid chunks; there's nothing much to simmer down into a sauce. One time I added 1/2 c. potato flakes and 1 small can of tomato paste with success; another I added one can of refried beans blended to a pulp in the food processor. Each worked fine. Also, the last time, I used TVP (1 c., 1 c. hot water + 2 tsp. beef base) instead of hamburger with success.

I'm only giving the recipe 3 forks, but the way we had it, it was 4! Added a lot of extra jalapeno because some people complained about the heat. Also used white beans instead of pinto because of what was available. Served with cilantro, chopped spring onions, creme fraiche (no sour cream in France), and grated cheese. Also took one of the other reviewer's advice and used beer instead of broth, but I doubled the tomatoes and the beer amounts because of the complaints that it wasn't soupy enough. Cooked it for a long time until the liquid became a thick gravy. It was amazing... I'll definitely make it again.

This was fine as a very basic chili recipe, but I found it quite bland. It would be fine if you were serving a group that might not be used to spicy food. I won't make it again. I think you could just as good results (or maybe better) using a basic chili seasoning packet from the grocery store.

Rating: 3
I used this as the base for the chili that's since become my recipe. For one thing, I use less meat and no beef broth (unless I'm making it with ground turkey, chicken or bison). I used one large white or yellow onion, and one or more bell peppers, which I soften with the onion. I keep the spicing about the same. My secret ingredient is balsamic vinegar (about two - four tablespoons), which I pour in about halfway through. Oh, and a bay leaf. As with all chili, cooking it a day ahead and simmering it as long as possible is the best way.

I have been making this for a while, and I love it! I always make a few changes, however- I use groung turkey, sub beer for the beef broth, add a couple chipotle peppers and halve the jalepenos, and add about 1 1/2 cups frozen corn. Very tasty & spicy, & excellent leftovers too.

This chili needs more tomato flavor and the one can of diced tomatos does add enough tomato flavor. Also-the chili is not really a soup but really thick but more like taco filling or hamburger. Not exactly what I envision when I think of chili-but my husband liked it.

I halved the recipe except for the olive oil. I used a 3 1/2 qt. Le Creuset and felt the veg needed 2 tablespoons so they would brown, not burn. Also, I subbed mild hungarian green chiles, lightly oven roasted, for the jalapeno. I subbed pintos for the kidneys per husband. This was a great recipe. Very simple. Room for alterations/additions.The cooking times were exact and the flavor was superb. I did miss the salt, so next time I will top with cheddar. Served with sweet cornbread with chives.

Great basic chili recipe. Based on other reviewers' comments, I cut the cumin down to 1 Tbsp. I found that the chili was very flavorful and had just the right amount of spiciness (spicy but not setting your mouth on fire). I did not find it too meaty, myself. I used 90% lean ground sirloin. Even after simmering for 45 min the chili is quite thin. I might add a can of tomato paste next time. I have also made the 'halftime chili' on this site, and I found this recipe to be tastier.

I have made this dish several times and my fiancé loves it! When adding the kidney beans I do not drain them, I add the whole can to give the chili more liquid.

This is a good, basic recipe. I also really thought it was too meaty so I added a 15oz can of tomatoes w/some extra seasonings. I didn't have fresh jalapeños so I tossed in a few of the pickled kind and it worked out wonderfully. Really don't think it's necessary to use 85% meat if you don't want so much fat. 93% will work out just fine. Yum! Next time I'd do even less meat, with black beans and corn.

This recipe had a good flavor but was too meaty. In contrast to the reviewer who disliked the cumin, I used the quantities of spices as directed (plus some red pepper) and found the spices to be just fine. However, I thought the recipe was very heavy on the beef. I doubled the amount of tomatoes and the meat was still too much. I'd like to try it again with half the amount of meat called for, double the tomatoes, and perhaps three cans of beans instead of two.

you really have to like the flavor and aroma of cumin to like this recipe. chili powder consists of cumin and other spices therefore, i cut the suggested amount of straight cumin in half.

This was a good basic chili recipe. It was very meaty and I was concerned about the fat. I made the chili then chilled it, and skimmed off all the fat that way. When I heated it up 2 days later it was great.I followed the recipe exactly and it was spicy but not overly so.
