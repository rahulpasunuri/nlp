This is a time consuming and expensive dish to make, and the results were unimpressive. I definitely would not make it again.

We enjoyed this recipe and will make it again. It was easy and had a great depth of flavor. I also made the basmati rice with mustard seeds and golden raisins. I halved the recipes and my husband and I each had 2 meals.

Excellent dish. Also made it with the accompanying rice recipe and it has always gotten raves when served for guests. It's got a great sophisticated flavor and super easy to make. The ingredient list looks daunting, but well worth the effort. Any well stocked liquor cabinet should already have the Angostura bitters in it.

Tasty and spicy but not good enough to make again.

my parents abolutely loved this. i made the basmati rice with mustard seeds as well. i skipped the bitters, as we didn't have any, and i used diced tomatoes instead of sauce because that is what we had. i put some of the onion/tomato mixture in the food processor to thicken the sauce. also, used veg. stock instead of water. spicy and very good. highly recommended.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish, but I probably won't make it again because (1) it wasn't worth the effort, and (2) my 10-year old didn't like it (and he loves spicy food, shrimp and tomato based sauces).

Can't go wrong with this recipe. Always popular.

We serve this dish over pasta (spaghetti) instead of rice. Make sure the sauce is thick enough to stick to the pasta. Everyone we've served this to has loved it. We prefer it quite spicy but ofcourse you can govern the degree of spice yourself.

Great flavor and it IS spicy!! I served it with the suggested Basmati Rice with Mustard Seeds & Golden Raisins, and Spinach Salad with Leeks, Mushrooms, and Feta Cheese for an excellent menu. The only change that I made was to use half low-sodium chicken broth with the water.

I made this for a Valentine's Day dinner party and it was a big hit. Served it over orzo. The sauce is just fantastic; so much more interesting than a regular tomato sauce. Two very enthusiastic oven-mitt thumbs up.

Really good; spicy enough for those who like a little extra something in their food.

To the previous reviewer: Roux is the oil/flour mix you just made; angostura bitters can be purchased at any grocery or liquor store.

I'd like to make it nut what the heck are roux and bitters?

I made this with salad size shrimp and it was delicious. Served it over plain white rice because that's what was in the house! Even my kids - ages 9 and 4 ate it, although the 9 year old thought it was a little too spicy. Yummy with a salad on the side!

Wonderful. If you halve the recipie as I did, be sure to cut the simmer time down to about 20 minutes. We loved it.

We enjoyed this shrimp dish. We accompanied it with plain rice, and the sauce on the rice was really good.
