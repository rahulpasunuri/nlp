The description was exactly the way this dish presented: The way cinnamon expands the dimensions of brown butter means that you won't overtly taste the spice here, just pasta with deep, rich, nutty undertones. Chopped parsley freshens every bite. I think that pairing is very important with this, it is absolutely amazing sidedish with the proper pairing.

I thought this was pretty good...a nice simple dish and a quick dinner. To those who thought this was bland...ain't no such thing as bland food if you know how to season. Also: the feta and pine nut idea is great, I only had feta on hand but it went really well with the dish.

1.5 forks--I'm very sensitive to smell and found the fragrance of the butter and cinnamon lovely. My husband found it totally bland though. Neither one of us liked the parsley--maybe in a fraction of that amount--as it is, its like adding glass shards to the pasta...

I've made this several times and my entire family loves it. Sometimes I add toasted pinenuts and feta.

Really simple to make and a good standard side-dish for meats and rich, spicy stews.

unexceptional dish. I thought the parsley was overpowering and masked the cinnamon flavor. I might try this again without the parsley, and sub a small amount of fresh sage

Okay, but probably won't make it again. The cinnamon adds depth to the dish, but overall, it was still too bland for my taste.

Delicious! My husband loved it. I added some walnuts at the end and used less cinnamon than called for. Nice nutty flavor.

I was hesitant about the cinnamon here but went ahead with it anyway, exactly as prescribed in the recipe and it was delicious. The cinnamon is very subtle. This has a nice nutty taste from the brown-butter. Big hit.
