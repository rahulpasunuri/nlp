My husband the cannoli lover did not like this recipe. He said it was grainy/gritty and the flavor wasn't very good but mostly didn't like the texture.I couldn't find the candied orange peel or flower water so used 1 teaspoon of orange extract (Cointreau would have worked!.)I did not make the shells.

Regarding whether pastry cream is authentic; it is in a very similar dessert: Cannoncini. "Little Cannons" are usually made with puffy pastry for the shell and filled with pastry cream. Regardless, people get way too worked up about what is authentic. Is every chicken noodle soup exactly same? Does anyone honestly think every Sicilian family makes their cannolis exactly the same?

Haven't tried recipe yet, but the dough recipe only calls for 2 tbsp. of lard. The remaining lard is for frying (so it's not all those cups of lard in the dough). Just wanted to clarify Las Vegas' confusion... =)

Goat cheese was easy to find and I doubled up on it, liked the texture. Substituted Contreau for orange flower water. Recipe for the shells needed a little help, used a whole egg (and an oops! dash of marsala) to get a good dough consistency. I stopped my pasta roller at the 3rd stop so the dough was thinner than a dime. Frying in canola oil worked well enough and the pastry thickness was sturdy for stacking. All I needed was a pink box with a string tying it closed to remind me of previous cannoli hunting trophies.

Forget using goat cheese. I used mascarpone. Also, no need for orange blossom water. If you really have time, try making the shells. Otherwise purchased shells are fine. Sprinking chocolate chips on the ends of the filled cannolis make them pretty. Nuts are a personal preference but I think they ruin the texture of the filling.

Epicurious won't let me fit this in one review, so here's Two. I haven't had cannoli for years and years, so made these tonight for the first time for a group of friends and they came out very nicely indeed. For the filling, I did substitute mascarpone for the goat's cheese, and used far more sugar than this calls for as the recipe I have from an old Italian cannoli forms box said 2:1 ricotta to conf. sugar by weight. I also left out the peel, orange water and pistachios, but used a few drops of vanilla extract, a little cocoa powder, and mini chocolate chips; fewer inside and plenty for dipping the ends of the finished pastries. A necessity in my opinion, with pistachios on the end a possible option. I did try to follow this recipe for the dough, as it is identical to the old recipe I have, save for the baking soda. However, the dough did need a fair bit more liquid to make it the right consistency, so I used more wine, and a few very liberal sprinkles of water. It just wouldn't come together for me otherwise. I found it much easier to handle the dough in thirds, rather than halves for the rolling stage. I too used the trick of gently rolling the rounds to make ovals, and fried the shells in Veg oil, no lard. After the first batch where it got too hot and slightly scorched them, they came out nice, very delicate compared to any cannoli I've ever had. If I were to make any change in the future, I might reduce the fat and/or increase the water/egg in the dough to make the shells that little bit little firmer.

Two tips I can pass on which I haven't seen posted is to make sure your dough doesn't go anywhere near the end of the tubes when you wrap them. If it does, as the dough expands when it fries, you'll have to break the shell to get it off. Also, make sure to wrap the dough snugly around the form, any gap there will encourage the oil in and make the shell into more of a horn than a tube. All round success as made, everyone was thoroughly satisfied, and a few people had to be cut off as they were eating so many they would exclude others from getting any. As I mentioned the shells came out very delicate, so that the shell broke where you bit it, as opposed to my previous experiences where they always seemed to break where they liked. And the 2:1 by weight for the filling came out how I remember cannoli, both in texture and taste. I have to say, much as I might love it on it's own, or as a filling or sauce, custard does just seem wrong here...

Custard in a cannoli? The one from Detroit and his 100+ relatives must be 100th generation italians. Would not say the recipe is authentic, but has most of the basic components of a traditional cannoli.

I think Las Vegas is reading the receipt wrong it only calls for 2TBS of lard which is not enough

Something is not right with this recipe... I think the recipe need to be re checked. 1 cup of flour to 2 cups of shortening is too much. I have several cannoli shell recipes and this is too much shortening. I also know someone one from Sicily and she tells me she has been making cannolis all her life. She said you don't use that much shortening and they never use baking soda or baking powder. As for myself I find the recipe works better if you use 4 tablespoons of shortening and 1 whole egg and no baking soda or baking powder. But if you want to experiment I would use the baking powder instead of baking soda.

The filling was mighty tasty but I took out the pistachios and used mini chocolate chips on the ends. Also didn't use any orange-blossom water because I couldn't find any. The shells were a real pain to make if you don't have a pasta maker. They kept wanting to rip apart when rolling them. I would suggest getting rid of all that lard and just use vegetable oil in a deep fryer, like I did. Overall, though, very tasty.

Not sure what I did wrong, my shells fell apart completely in the oil. I really messed up. They had this recipe on the Today show and a chef showed a bit of how he did it, his dough seemed a lot drying than mine, maybe I need to dust more flour. Might try again, or might just stick to store bought shells.

I have eaten cannoli with my cousins in Sicily - they have both kinds: ricotta and cream. The cream ones are just as "authentic" as the ricotta. I also think the goat cheese overwhelms the mixture. Adding the marscapone cheese does improve the texture of american style ricotta. For a really quick dessert, I like the filling on its own with amaretto cookies - not traditional, but tasty!

ricotta cheese, fresh whipped cream (sweetened), amaretto, a large Hershey's w/ almond chopped, pistachios (chopped, optional)... this is the recipe I've had passed down to me from Northern Italy for cannoli. (the Hershey w/ almond is an 'American' thing, of course)

I live near the Philly area and I am sure the Cannoli here have some boiled and hardend milk mixed in with the ricotta. Isgros pastries in the italian market has some great cannolis and the shells have to be top secret. I have never had a such a semi-soft thick shell anywhere. I know of 1 other place that has this type of shell.

I was curious as to how other people make cannoli. And my family makes it with ricotta (haven't heard of the goat cheese), but definitely not custard. My mom is from Sicily and this recipe is close...I must agree with previous bloggers about adding chocolate chips and cinnamon in the filling only. But another tradition we've had is putting cotton in the mix and seeing who gets it. But we had to change that (in case a little someone chokes) to a banana or boiled egg white.

I have searched high and low for an authentic cannoli recipe. Just one thing I remember mini chocolate chips, and powdered sugar, don't remember any nuts in the ones I grew up on in little Italy. Also I can't understand what kind of cannoli would be custard based....ugh!

I am a New York Sicilian...grew up eating the best cannolis and they were never ever custard based, always ricotta cream. My family also makes them, so whatever the reviewer from Detroit was eating, and I'm sure they were yummy, it was not traditional cannoli. An important tip: try to get "Italian Style" ricotta. In my area the Hawk Dairy brand is sold not in regular supermarkets but in Italian or specialty markets, and it is a much smoother, less "liquidy" ricotta. Cow's milk ricotta just does not have the correct texture. Also, I would sub mascarpone cheese for the goat cheese and I agree with the reviewer who spent summers in Sicily...just a touch of cinnamon and mini chocolate chips mixed in with the filling. If you want nuts, dab the already filled pastry in a bowl of chopped pistachios so they get only on the outside of the shell.

Wow! If I could give this recipe zero or negative forks, I would. Terrible shells-too heavy and oily tasting, plus most of mine completely fell apart at some point during or immediately after the cooking process. The filling sounds like it should be wonderful and although I adore goat cheese, I think it totally overpowered the other flavors. The orange is delicious but too faint and I prefer a sprinkling of chopped nuts on the finished dessert as opposed to mixed throughout the filling. Rarely have I been so completely disappointed and frustrated by time wasted working on a recipe

First of all, the shells are the best. (I had made another recipe for shells, and this recipe far surpasses the other). You could eat them plain, they're that good, and they are not finicky to make. I didn't have a pasta machine to flatten it out, I simply used a rolling pin, very easy doing it in a few segments at a time. I used shortening only for the shell mixture itself, used light oil to fry them in, not shortening (lard). Turned out fine. If you have time, let the ricotta drip out excess moisture. It makes a better, firmer texture you'll be happy with. You do NOT want a loose mixture. I used miniature choc chips for filling, eliminated nuts. Dusted w/powdered sugar. A lot of fun to make.

I would imagine this to be delicious providing you buy the shells and add an ounce or 2 of Bacardi as I have always had. Always a hit.

They must not know how to make cannoli in Detroit (see review from enigmafmc from Albuquerque NM). No offense, but custard filled connoli just aren't Italian! I grew up in an Italian town in NJ and this is very similar to the cannoli there. The goat chees is a different take on it. I prefer the ricotta sans goat cheese. Also, I think that it's worth buying the shells already made and making a fresh stuffing for them.

I have spent the last 4 vacations in Sicily and have prepared cannoli there with Sicilian cooks. They indeed use sheep's milk ricotta (I even went to the farm to watch them make it and ate it hot and fresh!). This recipe is close but they do not add orange peel or flavoring or nuts to the filling and use the nuts only as decoration on the ends of the filled shells. They add vanilla and cannele(cinnamon)and mini chocolate chips to the filling. I did go to a town that boasts winning the award for the best cannoli, it's called Dattilo. And they were outstanding! Never saw a cannoli filled with custard there!

I'm from NY and the cheese filling is kinda what we use, but the lard etc is way over the top. The filling is okay but the shells are way too greasy.

I am Scilian and grew up in Detroit eating Sicilian cannolis...this recipe isn't any where close to what we eat. We have a custard base filling (no cheese..either ricotta or goat) and use semi sweet chocolate chips and ground pistachio nuts. Who came up with this one? I wouldn't touch a cannoli like this...and neither would any of my 100+ relatives!

Havent made this iteration but looks great. Have been making cannoli 30+ years, so goat cheese is a new element for me. My dad, a WWI Italian army vet who emigrated to States said at his first "buonissimo, like I'm back home." This recipe is just as good. &to No. Ontario, dont work about chosesterol, you don't drink the oil; most can be save & reuse.

To the cook in Ontario: If you read through the recipe you'll see that the lard & oil are used for frying.
