We really liked this. Yet another vegan hit in our house! But definitely will try with poached shredded chicken and maybe some chiles for heat.

Loved this recipe. Stir fried Chinese mustard greens instead of the cucumber and fresh red peppers in place of radishes. A very satisfying lunch.

Made this salad for a BBQ and it was a hit. I used whole wheat linguine instead of soba because they didn't have any at the store, and it was perfect.

Very straightforward to make, healthy and delicious. I julienned everything by hand; wish I had the right tools to do that. Probably won't make again until I can get a mandolin slicer.

This is good! I make this every summer with fresh Armenian cucumbers from my garden. I've prepared this for office parties and it is always a hit.

This is a super simple and unpretentious noodle dish that is very delicious and satisfying, especially in hot weather. I made it with mint, cucumbers, and red pepper.

Very easy to make but there are many better noodle salad recipes on this site

I didn't have all the ingredients this time around, but I added some fried tofu and a bit of soy sauce with sugar and it turned out quite tasty. Nice and simple, and especially good during the summer since it's a cool, relatively light dish.

To the Cook from Virginia who complained about the lack of salt in the recipe, you probably didn't use SEASONED rice vinegar. There's a big difference! SEASONED rice vinegar has about 500 mg of sodium per tbs, along with some sugar!!!

To make my work easy and have a nice presentation, I shredded the carrot, cucumber and radish in the food processor. It looked lovely. The only trouble was the noodles taste. I don't know if that was the specific noodles type I bought or not but they had some unpleasant texture. I may try it next time with a different type of soba.

This is wonderful...a recipe that can stand on its own or be a springboard for one's own tastes. We have changed the recipe by adding and subtracting ingredients. Subtracting vegetables and/or adding chicken or tofu has made this extremely versatile and its just great, every time. It's easy and it can be made ahead of time for dinner or entertaining.

I would recommend replacing the soy with braggs amino acids and adding some tofu for a balanced meal

This was bland, a fault I attribute to inadequate instructions about salt. I added salt at the end, but by then it was too late to really do much good. The salt should have been incorporated into the rice vinegar. It would have been nice to have a clue as to how much, but the Gourmet and Bon Appetit editorial staff seems to be reluctant to give even a hint on salt measurements these days.

Quick, easy and tasty. My husband likes it more than I do (he's Asian) but it's a cinch to make for him. Refreshing in the summer.

This is so fresh, easy and healthy! It receives rave reviews every time I serve it. Makes a great side accompaniment for asian-marinated grilled tuna, salmon, or chicken. I also make this salad the main course by mixing the flaked salmon or shredded chicken directly with the noodles. I also throw in beansprouts, snow peas, red pepper flakes, etc. to jazz it up.

Haven't made this one, but LOVE my recipe which omits cukes and adds snow peas, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, honey and red pepper flakes. Try it!

Very tasty and extremely easy. Make sure to get the vegetables as dry as possible before mixing.

Very tasty and even kept well enough for leftovers the next day.

Nice! Maybe I'll use a touch of hot sesame oil next time to give the salad more punch. Used the Benriner (plastic Japanese mandoline slicer - very nifty) to shred the vegetables into long, skinny strips to match the noodles.

yum, I had never had soba noodles, but in a shopping frenzy at the asian supermarket I impulsively bought a bunch of noodles and then had to find recipes to use them in... and this recipe is a winner! I'll make it often.

I have made this many times and it is wonderful!

This is really nice and light, but it makes a lot. I think I would reduce the amount of vegetables a little. The sauce is a great match for the Soba noodles (which I love and am always looking for new ways to prepare them).

This is a nice summer pasta salad, a hit at my daughter's birthday party when I made it for the adults. A nice luncheon menu item.
