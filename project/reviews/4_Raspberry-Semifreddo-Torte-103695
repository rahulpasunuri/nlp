I tried 1 cup of mango puree in place of the raspberry and it turned out great. Yummy!!!

Super!!! My boss called me to the table and explained to the guests this very delicious dessert. I drizzle low fat chocolate sauce topped with raspberry and Mint. Crowd pleasing!!!!

Wonderfully light! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe. I was skeptical, but the butter in the shortbread cookies held the crust together perfectly. Used my stand mixer for the filling, and was grateful for it! Wanted to keep the dessert light, so I replaced the Mixed-Berry Compote with a Lemon Whip Cream (with additional raspberries on top). A chocolate sauce would work well too. Rave reviews from all tasters!

Four forks (five really) with two changes. 1. There is no need to make the crust. Just make the semifreddo. 2. My husband makes a chocolate sauce that guests pour over it - semi-sweet chocolate, butter, and cream. The result is a fabulous dessert that everyone we have served it to just adores!

You'll get a good arm workout with the 15 minutes of hand beating and then pushing raspberries through a sieve .... but it's worth it. I was worried about the crust being too crumbly and added a little extra butter at another reviewer's suggestion, but I think it would have been fine without it. Mine set up beautifully in only four hours and was not runny at all. I think next time I would skip the fresh berry compote and do something chocolate on top instead.

I thought the rasberry flavour was a bit muted. If I make it again I will use more raspberries and worry about it setting.

This was a great recipe. My only issue was a lot of the crust falling off when I sliced the torte. I used a serrated knife but it still didn't work that well.

I served this at a 5 course fancy dinner with some hesitation due to a few low ratings. My guests went wild for it. The texture was luxurious and the flavor bright and full. The mixed berry compote received less enthusiastic but still favorable comments.

this looks delicious, but consisting mainly of shortbread and cream, i don't think it can really be called "healthy". but then sometimes that's exactly what you want in a dessert! :-)

This is an absolutely delicious, healthy dessert. If you can't find Walkers in a local store, most of their products are available to buy on their US web site: http://www.walkersus.com

Was it just me? I thought this tasted like one of those so-called "whipped yogurts" you get in a supermarket. Or maybe a cross between that and a so-so icecream. Family on the other hand, seemed to think it was alright - maybe they were just being polite. Either way, I won't be making this one again.

Excellent. My only question is this: is this supposed to be a frozen desert, or soft? After freezing it, I then put it in the refrigerator and it turned to soup...frozen or soupy is tastes great but I'm not sure how it's "meant" to be.

This is one of my favorite desserts! I highly recomend it!I made absolutely NO changes! What more can I say?

This was easy and attractive, but it didn't have much flavor. Next time I will double the amount of raspberries and perhaps add a tablespoon of Chambourd. The crust was great.

I have to concur with all the 4-fork reviews. This is a luscious summer dessert when berries are fresh. It is easy enough to make. I was skeptical about the crust with just the shortbread and almonds, but it came together just as promised. It's great to have a delicious dessert that could be made days in advance and frozen and then served with the berry compote.

This was delicious! I brought it to a dinner party and everyone raved. It's a light yet flavorful summer dessert. The recipe was a little more involved than I thought it would be, but it wasn't difficult. The berry compote adds extra dimension - I definitely recommend making it to go along with this.

Light, elegant, simple to make (although it seemed to me that it took longer than five minutes to reach 140 degrees while cooking, however maybe it was my thermometer). Nevertheless, it turned out perfectly, the berry flavor comes through nicely and that crust is so yummy! A lovely summer dessert!

This is a great dessert for a dinner party. It's delicious, beautiful, impressive and, equally important, easy to make a day or two ahead of time. Highly recommended!

This is the perfect summer dessert for raspberries.

When I was making this recipe, I thought that it was a bit complex, but the results were so worth it. With the mixed berry compote, it was just wonderful. I would definitely make it again.

Wonderfully light and just scrumptious
