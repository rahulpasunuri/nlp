This was an expensive pie to make. I ended up burning the crust, even though I followed the directions to the letter. I'm not 100% sure that the crust needs to be baked then baked again with the filling. Overall, it was just OK.

Wow! I just found this recipe a few days ago and decided to take it to a potluck. I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra effort, but I was not disappointed! Everyone raved about it and I came home with only a tiny sliver. I made no changes and followed the recipe exactly.

I made this as one of the desserts for Thanksgiving last year. If you're looking for a light, fluffy cheesecake then this isn't it. It's more of on the denser/thicker side that makes you want a drink with it. Maybe it's because I beat it too much [Seriously doubt it]. Everyone raved about it but I wasn't feeling it. The topping was very good, though.

This was a winner of a cheesecake - I also reviewed the Bourbon Pumpkin Cheesecake and added bourbon to this recipe. I did not add the marshmallow topping but made whipped cream with bourbon in it and topped slices of cheesecake with the spiked whipped cream. Grown men licked their plates from this dessert - it's now a classic for my family!

This is fantastic! I make a different Pumpkin Cheesecake recipe every year... The Pumpkin Bourbon Cheesecake from here was last year. Each year they are good, this one is the best so far! Followed the recipe exactly, but added a little more of each spice. The batter filled the pan to the top and it cooked perfectly. The crust is amazing, if nothing else, make this crust for your next cheesecake. The topping looked funny after the marshmallows melted but once I let it cool and added the sour cream it was perfect!

Loved this recipe! Definitely a keeper for next year's Thanksgiving. Everyone ate it up. I used a 10" pan and still had extra batter so I used the extra to make a couple cupcakes, as was suggested. For the cupcakes I simply put a gingersnap in the bottom of the paper cup and watched them in the oven for a few minutes. If I had to guess I would say about 12 min. Next time I will probably add more spices and try increasing the pumpkin a bit. All in all.. very good.

I didn't have ginger snaps for the crust so I used regular graham crackers and a teaspoon of ground ginger instead. It's the second year in a row that I make this for Thanksgiving and it is truly wonderful! Everybody loves it and the acidity in the cream cheese with the sweetness of the crust and the marshmallows is just amazing. So much better than your plain ole pumpkin pie.

The sweetness of this pie overpowered and of the potentially tasty flavors.

Fantastic! As other reviewers have noted, the recipe makes a LOT of batter! I used a 10 inch pan and was worried there'd be no room for the topping, but it turned out fine. I forgot the crystallized ginger in the crust, but the ginger snaps I used were very ginger-y, so it wasn't a problem. The filling is delicious, and the textures of the crust, filling, and topping provide wonderful contrast. I brought leftovers to work and they were devoured!

Rating: 2
I would have to agree with the cook from Oakland, this was all right, but nothing to write home about. Everyone ate it, but how often is cheesecake refused? The crust could have been more gingery, the custard more pumpkin-y and spiced, and the topping more tangy. Don't get me wrong; the leftovers will still be eaten, but this is not going on my repeat list.

Fun to make and absolutely delicious. This recipe could easily fill a 10" pan (or bigger). I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect. This cheesecake is so good, in fact, I had to share it with my neighbors before I ate the entire thing myself. Made my second one for Thanksgiving, which we'll enjoy tomorrow. Be sure to cream the cheese when it's nice and warm, so it'll blend with the other ingredients entirely, otherwise, you'll get little cheese lumps in your pie. I don't mind that it takes two days to make, but if you're impatient, try a different recipe.

Now that I've made this a second time, I can confirm that the recipe will make 48 cupcake sized cheesecakes. Use cupcake tins with paper liners with a a spoonful of crust in each, bake for five minutes. Then bake the mini cheesecakes at 300 for 25 minutes. My only modification is to double the topping and use an entire 19 ounce can of pumpkin. I also up the spices and decorate the minis with chopped candied ginger and pecans.

This cheesecake was exceptional! I made this for a party and it was devoured! I made it exactly as written and I don't think it needs any changes. The topping was the perfect accompaniment to the sweetness and density of the cake. I was afraid it would taste like marshmallows, but it was perfectly tart and light. Will definitely make this again!

Rating: 4
I was a professional baker for a few years and I made this without any changes except I placed a roasting pan of hot water on the bottom rack of the oven during baking and I didn't make the topping. Instead, I simply whisked together sour cream and powdered sugar to taste and spread it with an off-set spatula to create that effortlessly textured wave look. I thought it was fantastic as did family and friends. Definitely a keeper even though the filling is plentiful and made a 10" AND 6" cake.

Rating: 4
By far the most delicious and impressive dessert I have ever made! The combination of the sour cream topping with the sweet pumpkin filling and gingersnap crust was a huge hit - it even won an award at a local company baking contest! If you have the time, I would highly recommend trying this recipe; 4 years later and people are still raving over this cheesecake!

Rating: 4
This is lovely on all counts! Beautiful presentation (which is not always easy with an iced dessert). Incredible taste. But to get the quantity right and put your mind at ease given all of the previous reviews.... use the 10" pan, reduce filling to 3 x 8ounce packages cream cheese and 1 1/2cups sugar and increase pumpkin by 8 ounces to approx 23 ounces. There is just enough batter to fill the pan, great pumpkin flavour and more than enough sweetness! It is a keeper... if you can!

I made a GLUTEN FREE version for Canadian Thanksgiving this weekend and everybody loved it. [I am the only one on a gluten free diet - I just didn't tell the others it was gluten free and they certainly didn't complain!) I used Mi-Del brand GF ginger snaps, added spices, 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup brown sugar for the crust. I just omitted the flour from the recipe and it didn't seem to make any difference in the consistency, although the cake did require quite a bit of bake time. There were so many conflicting ideas about the topping. It seemed like a lot of work and I didn't really have the time so I made some ginger whipped cream and the cake didn't seem to suffer at all. Everybody loved it and I'm afraid there will be no more whipping up easy pumpkin pies at thanksgiving!

I made this recipe as mini cheesecakes in cupcake tins. I don't have a food processor, so crushed the gingersnaps in a baggie and added in very finely chopped crystalized ginger and pecans - which worked just fine. I put a spoonful of crust into the bottom of each cupcake liner and baked the crusts in the oven about 8 minutes. I upped the spices - but followed the recipe otherwise. The batter was very generous - it filled 24 cupcake tins 80% of the way up, a pie tin AND a pyrex bowl! I did put a bain marie in the oven to prevent cracking. Based on another recipe - I baked the cupcake sized cheesecakes at 300 degrees for 22 - 25 minutes, they didn't crack and worked beautifully. I just left the larger sized containers in longer. They sat overnight in the fridge and I did the topping about 2 hours before serving and sprinkled them with chopped pecans and crystalized ginger (looked pretty and served as a warning to people allergic to nuts at the party) Everyone loved them and they disappeared quickly. I thought initially the sour cream in the topping was competing with the cheesecake flavor - but discovered with the back up that it mellowed and developed beautifully the next day tasting more marshmallow than sour cream. Oh because i did 1 1/2 of the topping to cover the minis and extra pies! The flavors are very complex and rich - I will absolutely make it again and may try upping the pumpkin

I have made this 2 years in a row for thanksgiving and it's the biggest hit out of everything. It's very sweet, but counterbalanced by the topping. I find there is too much batter, and I need to throw some out before baking it, but other than that the recipe is perfect. I would definitely make this again

Haven't eaten the cake yet but looks great! Just had a question...my marshmallow topping got too firm when cooled. I couldn't fold in my sour cream. It doesn't look like anyone else had this problem so I'm not sure what I did...anyone suggestions?

I have made this for the past two (2) Thanksgiving and everyone loves it! Thanks for the advice to place it in a bath as I followed it and it didn't crack. I omitted the marshmallow topping because when I fist tried to do it, the consistency was not what I was trying to achieve and the color of the cheesecake was just so glorious, it would be a shame to cover it! I've just decided to make this part of our Thanksgiving. Thanks!

Rating: 4
Simply incredible... I brought this to a dinner party and have never received so many complements on something I've made. The crust makes this really stand out because of the crystallized ginger. I was surprised by the light texture of the filling but everyone said they preferred this after a big meal. The only thing I changed was to increase the spices in the filling and added pumpkin pie spice as some other reviewers suggested. Definitely use a 10" pan.

I made this cheesecake for Thanksgiving last year and was pleased with the result. I think the gingersnap cookie crust really creates the balance of texture that you need with a cheesecake. I have to admit that I am not sure I would add the crystallized ginger next time; it is a bit expensive and I didn't particularly think it heightened the flavor as I expected. It did take me three days to make, what with making the crust, then the filling and then the topping, so I don't think I would make it again for Thanksgiving--there are just too many components when you have to make several dishes. It would be good to take to an Autumn dinner party though.

I've made this cheesecake twice now and love it. It definitely needs a 10 inch pan though. I used a 9 inch the first time around which worked out okay, I just had leftover filling. This time, I just loaded the filling in and I had a hard time getting the center to set properly. The only changes that I made to this recipe so far were that I added a bit more ginger to the crust to give it more bite, and I sprinkled some nutmeg and cinnamon on top to give it a more festive look and feel.

This was a huge hit at our Christmas dinner last night. I live at high altitude, but made no modifications to the recipe and it turned out great. I decided not to bother with a waterbath, and it turned out creamy and luscious, with very little cracking on the top of the cheesecake (which was easily covered up with the topping.) After baking, I turned off the oven, opened it slightly, and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for about an hour before removing it to cool on a rack. As several previous reviewers noted, this must be made in a 10-inch pan - a 9-inch pan isn't nearly big enough. After the marshmallow sour cream topping set, I decorated the top with a few whole toasted pecans, some thin strips of crystallized ginger that I twisted and arranged decoratively around the pecans, and then some nutmeg dusted around that. It was really beautiful and soooo good. This one's a keeper!

Ok, I wasn't that excited about pumpkin cheesecake but my friends have been begging me to try one (I'm their cheesecake go-to girl). I baked this up for a Christmas party. This is the first time I took leftovers home but I didn't take them because there was any left, I snagged a piece while it was on it's way out because it was downright incredible. I pretty much made it exactly as the recipe suggested except that I only have a nine inch pan so this made one 9" cheesecake and 12 cheesecake muffins. I also believe I overbaked it a bit and it was still one of the best cheesecakes I've ever had! It's very light and pumpkiny and the ginger isn't overwhelming at all. I may never eat pumpkin pie again. It's very easy to make so don't let anything daunt you. Make the whole thing - the crust, the topping, the whole thing! They combine to make a cheesecake that is out of this world.

I made this for a work potluck to spectacular reviews. The crust is a winner and the consistency divine. I, too, increased the spices quite a bit and included cloves. I also added 1.5 cans of organic pumpkin. Definitely a winner! My husband is asking for it again for our Christmas gatherings.

I followed the recipe to a tee. This cake was so easy to make and absolutely delicious. I was a little concerned making it for the first time (actually my first cream cheese cheesecake ever made) to take to a women's group holiday meeting. It was fantastic. People asked for the recipe. The crust is amazing. The crystalized ginger is key. The cake is almost a mousse-like consistency, but still sliceable. The topping is yummy...the marshmallows take a little sour out of the sour cream. The pumpkin is subtle and the spices are also subtle but noticeable. I'm making it again in a few days for Christmas dinner dessert. Don't hesitate to make this. It's absolutely delictable.

I'm a little early in reviewing, as my cheesecake is still in the oven.. but the smell that is filling my kitchen is amazing!! I couldn't believe how simple this was to put together, and how much filling would be made! I used a smaller pie pan, but had leftovers for 6 mini cheesecakes, and then some which I turned into pumpkin cheesecake muffins. I can't wait to hear what people at my work pot luck say about this, as well as my roommate who has already sent me text messages about having some set aside just for her! Too bad everyone has to wait one more day for things to settle and the topping added. (Which I have some crumbled cinnamon toast crunch to add as a decorative topper on the marshmallow crust!!)

LOVE this cheesecake! I've made it twice and had rave reviews both times. I brought leftovers into work and my boss ate 2 pieces and then took a 3rd home! I used reduced fat cream cheese, reduced fat sour cream, and Splenda sugar blend for baking the second time around and didn't miss the extra calories. I decorated the edge around the top with extra cookie crumbs. The crust really makes this one special.

I have never made a cheesecake before, so I was a little apprehensive about trying this recipe. But it turned out amazing! I increased the spices and pumpkin by 1.5x and decreased the sour cream, as several people suggested. Also added some toasted pecans dusted with cinnamon, allspice & brown sugar on top. Made this for Thanksgiving and had four different people tell me "that was the best cheesecake I've ever had!"

I found that having made the cheesecake rather late the night before, it was not as solid as it should have been by the next evening's dinner. The dessert tasted better the next day when it was more solid and more tangy. I didn't use the marshmallow topping as it's hard to get marshmallows here in Jordan. Everyone loved it but I knew it didn't taste like it should. Those who took home leftovers probably got a better version the next day.

The cheesecake flavor mellows the pumpkin spice. Easy to make and delicious.

Really, really good. The cheesecake comes out kind of fluffy,which was nicer than a traditional dense cheesecake after a heavy dinner. I used triple gingersnap cookies that were made with crystalized ginger so didn't have to purchase a $10 bottle of it since I wouldn't probably ever use it again. Also substituted 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie seasoning for the spices in the filling. I'm not entirely sold on the topping because it had an odd texture (kind of spongy) but it made the cake look really nice and it tasted fine. Will make this again next year.

Rating: 3
Excellent for show-stopping but not difficult Thanksgiving dessert. It does make an awful lot of cheesecake, however, and I ended up with the 10" springform cake and 6 individual cheesecakes that I could play with - like extra ginger and cloves, marshmallow and mascarpone, etc. Those were for me the next few days. Our dinner guests loved it as did my husband - and he's not a fan of anything but plain pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. I placed whole pecans and candied ginger "swirls" in a decorative pattern on top for visual impact, as well as a little freshly grated nutmeg as suggested in another review, and everyone thought it was much more difficult than it was.

This cake is EXCELLENT. I rarely follow recipes exactly but I did for this since previous reviewers were impressed. It turned out to be the best cheesecake I've ever made, with a flavorful crust, smooth pumpkin filling, and a silky but not-too-sweet topping. As a bonus, it also turned out to be as beautiful as the slice in the picture. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

To keep any cheesecake from cracking cook it in a water bath. Be sure to cover the bottom of your sprinform with foil to keep the water out. Use hot watete for the bath and fill it up about halfway on your springform. After the cake is cooked, turn off you stove and leave the cake in the water bath for one hour and then put it in the fridge. Cheesecakes are not a true "cake" but more of a custard due to the amount of eggs, thus the water bath.

After fooling around with a couple of other pumpkin cheesecake recipes, (I now consider myself a "pro"!), this is the one I love the best. I think the gingersnap cookie crust is to do die for, and I think it would taste good with any kind of cheesecake. A 10" springform pan is a must, recipe won't fit in a 9". The topping is excellent as well. I do not understand why all the pumpkin cheesecake recipes call for a sour cream topping, but this marshmallow/sour cream topping is the best one I've found. Have received raves from friends and relatives alike. One friend, a police officer, said that I would be making one for his family for Thanksgiving 2010 or else! All in all, a great recipe find.

This cake was delicious! We followed the recipe exactly and it turned out really well. The topping was creamy but not too sweet.

After making this for the first time for Thanksgiving 2008, it has become our signature family dessert for the fall and winter.

This was awesome, awesome, awesome!!! I put it in the water bath like some had suggested, and baked it for an additional 10 minutes. I think it could have used another ten minutes, but we've noticed that my new oven is a bit off.

Oh... my! Took this cheesecake to a neighborhood gathering tonight and, by request, have already emailed a link to several cheesecake enthusiasts.

This could replace the traditional pumpkin pie next Thanksgiving. Absolutely a keeper!

This is an exceptional cheesecake! The only addition I made was 1/8 tsp. ground cloves to the cheesecake and I dusted the topping with some pumpkin pie spice for color.

Delicious!! My fiance won't stop raving! Like everyone else said, I had extra filling, but I just put in some ramekins and make a small version, which was great because I always like to try new recipes before I serve it to people! As my love for cooking definitely outweighs my skill, my cheesecake had huge cracks, so... instead of filling the cracks with the liquid topping, I put some saranwrap on a plate, sprayed it with a little cooking oil and poured the topping on the plate. I let it set and then inverted into onto the cake, the result was flawless! So, if you're a novice like me, you might want to try it to get a perfect looking cheesecake!

Fantastic dessert and great ending to Thanksgiving dinner. Per previous reviews, you do end up with extra filling. I also made additional crust and went a bit higher up the sides of the pan. Cooled beautifully and came easily off the pan (even the bottom with slight help with a knive). Crust is a must as it brings dessert to new level. I also only used half the sour cream for topping. Like many other reviews, this is a new tradition!

DON'T USE A 9" PAN, USE A 10" SPRINGFORM! I just made this recipe this afternoon and I can tell you that the directions incorrectly state that you should use a 9" springform pan.

When I read the reviews for this recipe I noticed that some cooks mentioned that there was way too much filling for a 10" springform pan. Through an error on my part I found the perfect amount of filling. When I started this recipe i realized that I had only purchased 2- 8oz. pkgs. of cream cheese when the recipe called for four. I had an additional 4 oz. of cream cheese in the fridge so I decided to go ahead with what I had...20 oz. of cream cheese. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and the eggs to 3 but keep all the other ingred.s (including spices) at the stated amounts. The amount of filling I ended up with was perfect for the pan. Baked it in a "water bath" and had no fractures. As Will said: "All's well that ends well."

I thought this was delicious. The cake was velvety and creamy and the spices were just right. I made it as written although I did put a pan of water under the cake as it baked.

I can't believe I'm saying this but I think we have discovered a new tradition: this will definitely replace pumpkin pie on the family menu from now on!! I made some modifications, with wild success: no crystallized ginger in the crumb/crust for fear of the kids' reaction, but I added a 1/4 tsp of powdered ginger to oomph the flavor. I could have added a bit more. I also really like intense pumpkin/spice flavors; nothing wimpy. So I used the seasonally available pumpkin spice cream cheese from the supermarket, I doubled all the spice measurements and I increased the amount of pumpkin itself to about 1.5 times stated in the recipe. Also: I try to cut back sugar amts wherever I can so I experimented with 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup Splenda as another recipe alteration. Result: huge luscious deeply pumpkin cheesecake that everyone kept digging into for days; even the kids requested it! We hate marshmallows in the family but I gritted my teeth and actually tried the topping exactly as directed by the recipe and it was a perfect topping for the spiced-up cheesecake; didn't taste marshmallow-y at all... just had a lovely not-overly-sweet creamy texture. I'm glad the other reviews warned about baking time. This cheesecake filled up a deep 10" springform pan and took only 40 minutes to bake... outer edges began slightly cracking at 30 minutes. Watch the baking time carefully and remove when center becomes just slightly ready! It was perfect. Next time I will also reduce crust baking time by a minute or two. I yanked it out after 4 minutes or so when I noticed it beginning to get too brown.

I wrap the bottom of the springform pan with tin foil, then place the whole thing in a shallow pan of water. Helps immensely with the cracking, and I think color consistency. Don't even bother to cut the cake from the pan, when you cool it, it pulls away from the pan itself. I didn't make the topping, it's a great combination of flavors, not too sweet, without it.

This was one of the best cheesecakes I've ever made! My son's friend said I had the skills of an angel. ;) Anyway, I used a 10" pan, otherwise made it according to the directions, and it was fabulous.

i used a 10 in. springform pan, and it came out beautifully. and, instead of a water bath, i filled a sheet pan with water and placed it on the rack underneath. the last change i made was that i didn't use all of the sour cream in the topping. i loved this cheesecake, and it was light and the perfect amount of pumpkin to cheesecake ratio. it is worth all the work.

This cheesecake was amazing. I had people say "I love you more for making this cheesecake" during our Thanksgiving meal. I have been brainstorming what to make for Christmas and cannot come up with something to beat this cheesecake! I do agree with some other reviews to increase amount of crust, and I also increase amount of topping by about 1/3. I also did not cook it as long as the recipe called for, but it just depends on your oven. Be sure to use a water bath as the cake is thick and heavy and will most likely have one or two cracks :)

Excellent cheesecake for a festive meal - especially Thanksgiving. I followed the recipe exactly and all of my guests thought it was the best pumpkin cheesecake ever!

This cheesecake was delicious! Everyone loved it on Thanksgiving day. There were tons of pies left but none of my cheesecake!!! I followed the recipe exactly and I thought it was perfect. The only thing people should be aware of is that the pan will drip and cause the oven to smoke if you don't put something underneath it. I have already had requests to make 3 of these for Christmas! Will definitely make again!

This is a wonderful light cheesecake. Yummy! The only thing missing in the recipe was that it did not say to place cheesecake on a baking sheet in the oven...which I will do next time to catch to drips.

This was big success! Even a family member who does not like pumpkin pie loved it. I too had way more filling and topping than I needed, will probably cut back next time. Delicious!

This recipe is awesome and a huge crowd pleaser. Excellent. Shared recipe with many already. Not to miss. Doesn't get better than this. Try to use best quality ginger snaps.

Big Hit for Thanksgiving! Everyone loved it, even folks who don't dig cheesecake! Baked slightly longer than recommended and omited crystalized and increased spices as suggested! Plan to make a tradition to our table!

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! Followed the recipe exactly, used fresh spices, and I have no complaints. It was done about ten minutes ahead of suggested time in my oven. Rave reviews from my kids and everyone at the table. No leftovers. This is a keeper.

This was a very good cheesecake, though I did need to add additional spices. I also added a few dollops of dulce de leche before cooking, and sprinkled the top with additional cinnamon. I didn't feel like the topping added anything, and mine didn't set well. I would definitely make the cheesecake again, but maybe change the topping.

I have made this cheesecake twice now, both with amazing results. The first time I used the crystalized ginger and made the topping and it was good but there was too much left over topping and I didnt feel like it was necessary. The second time I didnt bother making the topping at all and didnt have crystalized ginger on hand so I just used 1/2 a teaspoon of ground ginger. Turned out just fine.

This cheesecake was a huge hit at Thanksgiving (we Canadians have ours in October). I didn't bother with the topping because I like the pure flavor of the cheesecake. The ginger/pecan crust was amazing. This will be on the dessert table at Christmas for sure!!

This cheesecake made an elegant substitute for pumpkin pie. I agree with the review to increase the spices slightly. I would also suggest making the topping, as it tempered the very sweet cake. I used the crystallized ginger in the crust and received several compliments, althought I don't know if I would use it again, perhaps just the gingersnaps and pecans. I made a bit more crust than called for and put it into muffin tins into which I poured the batter that didn't fit into my pan (I used a 10-inch and still had leftover batter). It made 7 generous-sized mini cheesecakes that cooked in about 20 minutes. I noticed that the cake was set and only giggly in the center 3" after 1 hour. It turned out very creamy and I definitely think the time called for would have resulted in an overcooked cake. Overall a delicious cake that I will definitely be making for Thanksgiving.

Unlike many of the reviewers, I didn't have an overflow of filling - it was just the perfect amount. I did find however, that the filling was sort of bland and not pumpkin-spicy enough. So I added more cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. I agree that the marshmallow topping doesn't really have much flavor, but it was well received by my taste testers. The end result cracked big time, which isn't desirable in a cheesecake. I turned the oven off much earlier than the recipe suggested and let the cheesecake rest, and it was creamy and not overdone. But I think it might have been dry if I let it bake per the recommended instructions. I might make this recipe again, but I'll have to make adjustments. On second thought, because of that, I might just look for another option...life is too short.

I made two of these a few days ago. I took one with me on a visit to my high school where they devoured it and I left one at home. I can not stop eating it. However, I did make some changes that I felt were necessary. Maybe not to you, but. First, I used a basic graham cracker crust because I've never had gingersnaps and I don't like ginger. But I do like graham cracker crusts. I used a ten-inch springform pan because that's what I have. The batter came almost to the top of the pan. I decreased the amount of sugar to 1 1/3 cups and used firmly packed brown sugar instead of white. I also used two cups of fresh roasted pumpkin instead of canned. The second cheesecake I used butternut squash because I was no longer able to locate some fresh pumpkins. It still tastes like pumpkin to me. I decreased the vanilla to 1 tablespoon because I didn't want to use so much vanilla for a pumpkin cheesecake. Then, I left out the water-bath. Instead, I placed a pan filled about two-thirds with boiling water on the rack beneath the cheesecake. Also, I baked it for twenty minutes at 350ºF, then I lowered the oven to 250ºF and baked it for another hour and a half. Then I left off the marshmallow topping and just served each slice with a drizzle of homemade dulce de leche.

I don't even like cheesecake, and I couldn't stop eating this. Unlike the other reviewers, I liked the marshmallow topping, and I would suggest making it. I had only about 8 oz of leftover filling, and I used someone else's suggestion of putting it in little souffle cups, which worked nicely. Make sure to use enough cookie crumbs-I don't think that my butter-to-crumb ratio was quite right, and my crust came out really hard. Also--don'e be afraid of the ginger. I don't like ginger, and I thought that it worked nicely in this recipe. I can't say that this will be replacing pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving, but it's a nice seasonally appropriate dessert for those nights where pumpkin sounds nice, but pumpkin pie is not quite right. I definitely think that I'll be making this again.

I tested this recipe today in advance of thanksgiving. Use 10in springform pan. Topping is okay but doesn't really add anything. If i make the topping again I might use less sour cream - i didn't taste the marshmallow at all. Also, I cooked this for 1 hour 10 mins and it was perfect. If it had cooked longer it may have been too dry. Even the kids like it.

I found this to be a very good cheesecake, a nice mix between a pumpkin pie and a traditional cheesecake. Has the flavor and even the texture a bit of pumpkin pie, but is dressed up in cheesecake clothes. I found the crust to be fantastic...the cookies plus pecans made me wonder why I hadn't thought of such a thing before. I cooked mine in a water bath and still had some cracks and a little darkness on top. I agree that the topping is not necessary for flavor, but it was good to have to cover up some of the ugliness on the top of the cake. You can halve the recipe of the topping, however...I threw most of mine away. The filling will be too much for your pan...simply pour the leftover into a pie pan and have a little extra. A question for South Haven - if you noticed you had too much filling, why did you keep pouring? Is your review for the quality of the finished product or for the fact that it overflowed on you?

this was made for my cooking group and was absolutely delicious! the topping is definately not necessary, (in fact, detracts from the cake) the cake is beautiful and w/the ginger a wonderful end to any meal

This recipe is excellent but you definitely need a 10 inch springform pan. Didn't have crystalized ginger . . fine without.

I made this for a dinner party last night to rave reviews. I am not a big fan of pumpkin cheescake but this one was outstanding.

Although I used the pan size specified, there was too much filling. It went from runny to overdone and unevenly puffed very quickly. Did I mention that I failed to wrap the pan in foil and am still trying to clean the oven spillage? I've made many far superior cheesecakes over the years and definitely won't bother with this one again.

I've been making this recipe for years. It is always a favorite among Thanksgiving guests. People talk about it all year. Sorry pumpkin pie, you've been replaced. I always omit the ginger as I'm not a fan, no one seems to mind.

This is a superb cheesecake! I was concerned about the amount of vanilla, but it was delicious. And it is a huge cake, so it is a generous 12 servings.
