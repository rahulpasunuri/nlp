These were pretty good. My husband loved them though and would like to try them dusted with cinmon sugar and served with ice cream. Tonight we used them as a garnish for soup and on the side. They shrunk considerably and were quite delicate.

I won't assign this an official rating because as a newbie to deep-frying, I'm not sure I did this right. The edges of the chips instantly turned dark brown, while the middle stayed orange. I thought I sliced/peeled them reasonably evenly, though.

These chips are terrific. Using a peeler is much easier than slicing the potatoes. I've done the same with parsnips.

We liked this so much, I make it as a side dish to steak and salad instead of a baked potato. Very good, a bit of work but not hard to do at all.
