I used more pineapple when I made this. And instead of lard or plain oil I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 sesame seed oil. THose small changes made this an absolutely delicious dish.

After reading the other reviews I added more pineapple and celery along with some Chinese 5 spice. My husband and daughter say it is a definite make again. I might add a dash of crushed pepper next time also.

Good, not great. I expected a more robust flavor combo. Only changes were 3 boneless chix breasts, 1 lg can chunk pineapple, & subbed diced yellow pepper for chestnuts. Probably won't make again, but if I did maybe I would try a more flavorful oil.

IF not using pineapple syrup add almost double or even triple the amount of pineapple juice instead. It was like there was a party in my mouth....and everyone inside was wearing fancy clothes and drinking expensive champagne.

Very simple recipe to follow. Nice light flavor. My husband commented it was a great summer dish.

I am not a fan of water chestnuts or celery in "Chinese food" (in quotes because this 60's rendition is hardly the real thing), but with a few adaptations this was a good quick meal. First I sauteed the onions in peanut oil then removed them from the pan. Then I sauteed 2 cubed boneless chicken breasts cooked through. I finished by adding chunk pineaple in natural juices, 1 tsp. cornstarch, 1 Tbs. water, 1 Tbs. soy sauce (mixed as directed) and sauteed until thick. Salt was added to taste.

It was absolutely wonderful. I used fresh pineapple because I had some, but too little juice. I would use a little less of the cornstarch and definately the specified amount of pineapple juice. But I like my food saucy!!! Definately will do it again.
