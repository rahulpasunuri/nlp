I've been making this sandwich since it first appeared in the magazine. It's a nice template. I use any cured meats I have on hand. Also, any cheeses and I even experiment with spices, spreads (pickled cherry peppers, etc.) and lettuces (arugula is particularly good). Enjoy!

I used ciabbata from my freezer. Even though it was getting a little hard, when I pressed the sandwiches on a grill with a top (in lieu of the skillets), the bread worked wonderfully. These resemble muffelettas. It' a great quick sandwich if you have the ingredients on hand.

Used foccacia, worked great. Painted the inside of the sandwich with mayo, added little dots of goat cheese, which had been marinating in garlic, rosemary and olive oil. Wonderful touch. Left out the pepperoncini and added a little chopped pimiento for color. Delish and well appreciated.

THIS WAS YUMMY! I USED CIBATTA ROLLS PURCHASED AT COSTCO. WOULD MAKE ADDITIONAL OLIVE MIX NEXT TIME. I USED SWISS CHEESE (ALL I HAD IN FRIDGE) AND LEFTOVERS FROM A BAKED PAGAN (VA BRAND) HAM, ALONG WITH THE SALAMI, ETC. BECAUSE I USED ROLLS, I WARMED THE SANDWICHES IN THE OVEN TIL THE CHEESE MELTED. WE ALL LOVED IT AND WILL DEFINATELY MAKE IT AGAIN.

What a great and easy recipe.Although it sounded like it would be salty, the mix was great. Even held up to the microwave for lunch the next day at the office. Have already made it a number of times since I came upon the recipe

It was good the first time I made it and even better the 2nd time. I added more genoa salami and ham and skipped the pepperonicini. Easy and delicious. My husband loved it.

Nice bunch of tastes. We'll make it again occasionally.

My wife and I love this recipe. We have had guests over who love it too. I like many have a hard time finding Ciabatta, so I use Fucacia(sp?)for the bread. It may be a little airy but it soaks up the oil dressing and tastes great. I also mix the Kalamati and green olives.

This is a great sandwich! I've already made it three times. I've tried both of the cheeses recommended, of the two the fontina is better.

Sandwich was good, but expensive to make and relish was salty. To Alamagordo, ignore the food snobs, pity them. They can't get the great Mexican food that you can. At least you can get all the great chile from Hatch.

Clearly, some of you folks have never lived in a small town, or shopped at a small town grocer. They generally carry VERY basic stuff(wonder bread and bologna). I enjoy some of the cutting wit I've seen on Epicurious, but some of you guys are being just ugly, nasty and mean. To the person from NM, many grocers, (and I would think Wal-Mart Super Center would be one) will start stocking an item just because you ask them to. It might be worth a talk with the store manager. To the cook from Ottawa--I don't hear anyone calling you sane.

Call me sane - but if you don't have the ingredients, then try out another dish. I don't think any of us are particularly interested in your local grocery problems....i mean, really.

Whoa. Was going to make this tonight. Am now afraid I will be shot if I try.

Dear Epicurious, This is that stupid cook from Alamogordo, NM that doesn't know enough to go into a grocery store to find ingredients for this recipe. I want to thank all the people who thought that the cook from Seattle, WA was just plain mean. Thank you all, esp. the cook from Farmington Hills, MI. I was raised in a suburb of Chicago (Oak Park), so I am very familiar with Kroger's, A&P, Dominick's, Jewel. So when I say some of the stuff called for in this recipe is not available in Alamo, I am not kidding. We have 3 grocery stores in this town of about 30,000. They are: Wal-Mart Super Center, Lowe's, Albertson's. (Of course there is always your local Allsup's--not even a 7/11) Thank you reviewers again for your understanding. (Boy, I sure did generate a lot of dialogue with my original comments!!!) I find a lot of French bread in this town, and maybe I haven't looked hard enough for Italian (I generally make my own bread in my West Bend breadmaker.) Also, since we didn't move here until 1981, I will presume that I am not brain dead due to the previous nuclear tests. Thank you.

Granted, I could be perceived as being a little harsh with my sarcasm, but come on. The only thing that would be hard to come by in even the most remote community would be the Ciabatta bread, and even then, you could expect to find an alternative if you asked a couple of questions at the grocer or even just guessed and selected a hard roll.

Did I miss somethng? What do you do with the dressing? Put it on the bread? Before or after grilling? And cut Alomogordo some slack. They've had so many Nuclear tests there that the townsfolks are a little strange.

This is a great sandwich. Make a double batch of the relish because you will want to make this sandwich again...very soon after the first time! I used kalamata olives. To the issue over ingredients, you probably can find all of them in your local supermarket, except for the cheeses (Teleme and Fontina). You can substitute swiss or jack for the Fontina. Teleme would be a tough one to substitute for (and in my experience, tough to grate, anyway). If you can't find Ciabatta bread, but sourdough slices. Capers, pepperoncini, kalamata olives in the salad dressing, condiment aisle.

I did enjoy this recipe very much. I also moved from a city close to Boston to the mid west where I couldn't find a lot of ingredients I needed. I just started ordering them on line or through mail order catalogs. This way you can get anything at all delivered to your door.

To the cook in Seattle, WA,you don't need to be so sarcastic, arrogant and cocky in your post to other cooks. You were downright nasty with: You are kidding aren't you? Please say you were just kidding. They have these neat things called grocery stores, you could easily find these items or an alternative at one in your town, but you have to go inside to find them. :) To the cook from NM, I have found capers, pepperoncini and fontina cheese in my local Kroger grocery store. I believe hard salami is hard salami no matter how you slice or dice it so I would try that. Some butcher stores may have that ham. Good luck on your shopping venture.

Great sandwich, nice tang. Some of the taste of a muffulata only grilled. Experiment with the cheese, try horseradish cheddar. To the cook in Seattle, you no doubt spend a lot of time in the grocery because your weather is so lousy who would want to be outside. Give Almagordo a break.

This is a great little sandwich. I agree that the caper relish is what makes it. And folks, please, Alamogordo MUST be joking. That's a small town, but not THAT small. Heck, you can't even order a pizza in this state without it coming with pepperoncini on the side...

loved this sandwich, the caper relish is an awesome touch...to new mexico: make sure that you really check out your grocery store, some have hidden little sections, but, these ingredients are pretty basic. these ingredients can be found everywhere except a 7-11...

Thought this was a wonderful sandwich. Will definitely make it again. To Alamogordo, NM...I understand living in a small area & not being able to find ingredients (been there before) BUT this really is not "weird" stuff - maybe just not available where you live. A food dictionary may help - I use mine all the time.

As a cook who lived for five long years in a small, remote town on the north shore of Lake Superior, I'd be inclined to give Alamogordo a bit of a break. Many small-town groceries do not have the space to stock lots of specialty items, nor is there a demand for them. On the other hand, there are plenty of excellent mail-order sources on the Internet. Or you can find recipes for ciabatta and peperoncini and make them yourself.

I loved this sandwich. I made half last night and I'm making the other tonight. Served it with the "Spicy Roasted Vegetable Soup with Toasted Tortillas" from your web site. A great combo for a cold night. I am fortunate to live where all the ingredients are available, but I understand the cook from Almagordo's complaint. I know alternatives i.e. Italian bread,plain salami, and a good melting cheese won't make the same recipe, but the techniques for grilling the bread and the sharpness of the olive and capers still make it a good sandwhich.

I made this recipe for our Christmas day buffet. I cut the sandwich into single serving bites and skewered with toothpicks. Of all the yummy food on the table, it was the first to be devoured...by a long shot. The flavors are perfect together.

This sandwich is awesome! The flavors are layered and each compliments the others. Especially like the last min addition of shredded lettuce w/the vinaigrette. Also, I substituted hot banana wax peppers for the peperoncini as that is what I had on hand. We made this twice in one week!
