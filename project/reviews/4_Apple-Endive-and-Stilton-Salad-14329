Easy, inexpensive, and delicious! We decided to make this at home to try to replicate an apple and endive salad we love at a local restaurant. They use a buttermilk dressing though, and seeing that we didn't have any sour cream or mayo, we tried this dressing. It was even better! The spiciness and tanginess of the dressing makes a great contrast to the sweet apple and candied walnuts. We didn't have shalot or red wine vinegar so I just skipped the shallot and used apple cider vinegar instead. This is going into the regular rotation!

Guests loved it! I added a red grapes to give it some color and it added the perfect bit of fresh sweetness.

I've made this salad now for several parties, and everyone always loves it. Several have asked for the recipe. I make it exactly as indicated. I do agree that it is not a colorful salad, so serving it on raddichio, as a previous poster suggested, is a great idea if you are looking for a fancy presentation.

This was quite good. I used the endive leaves as "little spoons" and dropped a dollop of the mixture onto each. It was a great finger food, quite yummy.

This salad is so good. I couldn't find endives, so I used romaine instead and regular blue cheese instead of stilton. Wonderful! The candied walnuts are awesome! (I don't even like walnuts that well..) Next time I might back off on the apples a bit and add more blue cheese. Personal preference.

I used red lettuce instead of endive, and regular blue cheese instead of the stronger stilton. Really excellent.

Great salad. I had small heads of endive so supplemented the salad with mixed baby greens which also added color. I didn't realize there was such a variety of Stilton cheeses. I bought English Stilton. Among them there was also a Blue Stilton which may be more flavorful??

This is absolutely delicious. My only concern was the color which is quite bland. It is nice served on a leaf of radicchio or something colorful to give it the attention it deserves!

A perfect summer salad when it's just too hot to cook. Of course I made a few substitutions... My lovely suburban grocery did not carry Stilton so I tried it with Blue cheese. I also mixed some mixed greens with the endive. Will try another store next time with hopes that it will make the salad even more delicious.

This salad is a huge hit with everyone I've made it for. It's simple to make yet is so much more elegant than an ordinary dinner salad. I use a mixture of red and white endives for a little more color and have been served variations on this salad that substitute hazelnuts and hazelnut oil for the walnuts and olive oil.

This was a big hit at dinner the other night. I didn't have time to saute the walnuts, just shook the skins off as much as possible before sprinkling them on the salad and this was still a great salad. Very nice change from greens or mesclun, spinach, etc. The dressing is excellent.

A wonderful winter salad. I modified somewhat. Added some additional baby greens and a clove of garlic to vinagrette. Had a Christmas dinner party the other night. Everyone raved about the salad!, scraped the bowl and wanted more. I love it when a recipe is such a hit! Thanks Epicurious

One of my favorite salads. I like to add dried cranberries and other fruit.

This sald is delicious and The Dining Room at The Berkeley Hotel, in Richmond, VA, is a wonderful place to have an exceptional dinner. The hotel is a small European style and is a great place to stay.
