I made this for Easter dinner and while it was acceptable, I have other ham recipes we have enjoyed more. I tried to make a gravy from the mango mush, onions and drippings and it just didn't have much flavor. I won't bother with this recipe again, but will go back to my other "tried and true's".

Easiest dish ever, and GREAT tasting. I had a bag of frozen mango from Trader Joe's, a bottle of Looza Mango Nectar from Jewel and a bunch of onions. Added it to a cheap ham shank, and it was a glorious meal. No, the meat didn't overly camerlize/burn (i can't explain the photo). It was tender, and the flavors of the onion/mango were delish. I'd give it five stars if I could. My guests went gonzo for it.

This dish turned our brunch into the Easter edition of Christmas Vacation. Sadly, I followed the recipe exactly as it was written, but the outcome was overcooked and dry. High altitude, length of cooking time and not having the foil tightly secured may have contributed to the poor "overcooked" quality of the meat. Based on other reviews, I'll attempt again with hopefully better results.

This is quite easy and the ham looks more appetizing when it is placed on platter surrounded by the bright mangoes. But do not use orange juice as the "juice." Creates a very strange flavor, I had to add sugar, and honey to fix it. Really, don't.

I made this recipe for Easter this year and it was terrific. We marinated the ham in the peach nectar overnight - I have never had such a juicy ham. The mangos and onions were a terrific complement to one another. Definite gets filed under the "make again" category.

Made this for Easter and mine was not burnt. The flavour was a hit and we will definately have it again.

This recipe was so easy and delicious. I changed the recipe a little by taking two roasted heads of garlic and rub the ham completely before adding the onions, mango and nector.

Made this for Easter and it was quite good. A hit with the family that looked lovely sliced on the platter surrounded by the mango cubes. The mangos do get soft (but not mushy) and are a great compliment to the ham. I cooked it at 350 degrees until the internal temp was 115. I did add about a cup of water to the roasting pan in the last 30 minutes of cooking to keep it moist. It didn't dry out and it did not develop the charred look of the photo. A super easy main dish.

Made this for Easter dinner, and it was a hit. The mango and onion turns to mush, but it's like an instant chutney to serve over the meat. I did have to reduce the cooking time a little, since it was beginning to dry out .

I made this yesterday for Easter dinner and it was disappointing. The onions overpowered the mangoes and it was not good. I doubt I would ever make this again, no one liked it. But if I did, I might try vidallia onions and add some brown sugar. It needed much less onion flavor and more sweetness. Not good at all.

Cooking time is too long and temps too high. Outside got too dry and burnt. The vegetables disintegrated with this length of cooking time. Flavor is nice, but veg/fruit and ham cooking time and temp needs to be cut back.

Cooked on a "Big Green Egg" in a dutch oven with a lid instead of foil. Oh my, how delightful! Add more mango and onion as they cook down and you'll want more!

It might havwe just been my ham, I suppose, but I made this last Easter and the mango and onions were so salty they were inedible. Disappointing since the recipe sounded great and looked delicious (not burnt :) Looks like other people had better luck so I maybe I need to try it again...

I have made and tried the ham, as long as you don't bake it too long, it is delicious!

Note that the food styling was done by Susan SUGARman, which may explain the carmelization.

Has anybody ever TASTED the ham?

Now that we're over the burnt issue, i have a pressing question for those of you have made this. Baking a ham can dry it out. how MOIST was your ham ? Curious minds seek to know ... B 4 Sunday.

I'm wondering if any of the people who are complaining that this looks burnt have either tried or at least read the recipe. It says bake until ham is lightly browned. And when was the last time any recipe any of you tried looked exactly like the picture on a website? This was delicious when prepared as directed

I find it interesting that you have repeatedly deleted my opinion that this recipe APPEARS BURNT & unsuitable for presentation by a professional photographer with a fine pallet!

Whether burnt or not, bottom-line, IT LOOKS BURNT & DISGUISTING! I always valued Epicurious, but now I have to wonder why in the world they would tarnish their reputaion with such a HORRIBLE example of a ham at the glorious time of year! I WOULD NEVER SERVE ANYTHING THAT APPEARED BURNT ... great tasting or NOT!

The ham is carmelized, not burnt - I love the way it looks and better yet the way it tastes - if you any basting with a sugar base - it will carmelize. But then again this America and we all are entitled to our opinions.

I think it looks burnt also. In fact, I began reading the reviews to see how many other people would enjoy an obviously charred ham.

Made this for Easter and a big hit. I cheated and used frozen mango bits (from Whole Foods) which I had on hand. Not sure much of a difference from fresh after all the roasting. Put the pan juices in freezer for an hour and skimmed off the fat before reducing.

My family loved this recipe. We were surprised how good the mangos and onions went together and that they did not take on the taste of ham. I used a partially cooked ham so baked the ham one hour then added the fruit and onion and continued on with the recipe. Next time I will buy the mangos a few days earlier as some of them were not so ripe.

I can't believe I am only the 2nd person to review this great and utterly simple recipe. I made it for an easter buffet party and it was a smash hit. My ham was 15 lbs and I used 2 cups of mango nectar, 4 mangos, and 4 onions. EXCELLENT!

My family and I just finished eating Easter dinner.This ham was very good! The mango and onions were a wonderful complement to the ham. I followed this recipe to the word and will definetly use it again.
