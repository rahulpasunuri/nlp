Wow! I love any opportunity to 'remake' my leftovers. This was the perfect way to serve leftover corn on the cob. I followed most of the instructions, but as it was getting late and I didn't want to brave the grocery store I modified it some. I used dried herbs and omitted the peppers (my husband isn't a fan anyway) and added a little extra butter. Wow! What a tasty and easy dish; I want to eat it all myself!

I did not make this recipe, but I reaped the rewards of being a dinner guest of someone who did. Delicious!!!! It's in my recipe box now for future reference.

This is one of my all-time favorite side dishes which I have also made as a main course by the addition of shrimp. For a subtle sweet twist, add a 14oz can of creamed corn. This is a very good recipe, as is, but the sweet corn tweak makes it pop!

Delicious combination of ingredients. I converted this into a "cassarole" and used generous portions of the vegetables. Added a serrano pepper for additional heat and minced garlic. Instead of the heavy cream I used three eggs and 1 1/4 cup milk. Baked at 350 for 35-40 minutes (or until the middle is set.)

so incredibly good my husband asked me to make it 2 nights in a row... The rave reviews are spot on.

this dish was perfect as a side to a seafood gumbo and a dish of simmered kale and dandelion greens in sauteed garlic and oil. we all thought it was so different and so delicious. i have to admit that i cheated and used 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 cream. it was still amazing! if you're a foodie you won't be disappointed, i promise. kathy lyness

Followed recipe as is and received raves. My husband turned up his nose when I described the recipe and ingred. He just about licked the bowl and is asking for more.

Delicious & easy to make! I served this at a creole/cajun dinner party, and this was the recipe most requested. All of my guests LOVED it.

What a wonderful dish.The only change was to add two cloves of minced garlic when the onions were just about done. I use the Corn Maque Choux as a base for some pan fried seasoned 8/10 scallops and 21/25 prawns.Some fresh sourdough bread and a crisp organic salad.

I have made plain as a side dish, and also mixed shrimp in it and had on top of cheese quesadillas. It's versatile and delicious.

I made this last Thanksgiving and now it's a requested dish! I added another step that seems to make my family happy: After the last step, pour all of it into a deep baking dish and cover with buttered bread crumbs...bake at 350 till bubbly. YUM!

i add 3/4 # shrimp with the corn and saute. This makes it a nice main course

People wolfed this down. One unsuspecting eater asked for seconds, then thirds, claiming to like it because it was so "healthy." Little did he know that it is so delicious because it has thousands of dairy fat calories in it. The presentation was also very nice, very colorful. I made it with Memphis Spare Ribs and Annapolis Crab Cakes. (During my Whirlwind Tour of the South themed dinner party.) I might thicken the sauce with a few tsps of cornstarch in the future, just to make it a bit thicker. The cream runs through the spoon.

You lick the beaters when you make a good frosting...you lick the spoon when you're done making a great cookie dough -- this recipe is no different. After pouring the maque choux into a storage dish, I grabbed a spoon and scraped out the rest of the pot directly to my salivating mouth. This stuff is AMAZING! A vegetable dish that you crave has got to be a special one indeed.

I made this for Easter along with the cornish hens and it was wonderful. My guests demanded the recipe. I don't particularly like spicy food, but found myself doubling the hot sauce (I used Frank's extra spicy). I also couldn't find fresh corn, so used frozen organic from Whole Foods. It wasn't as sweet as I would've liked, so I threw in a little bit of sugar. It livened the dish up considerably. Leftovers (if there are any) would make an awesome frittata!!

Surprisingly delicious! The only thing I changed was to make it with thawed sweet corn kernals (made it in the winter) - will make again for sure.

We love this tasty corn side. It tastes equally good with celery instead of onion. I also double both the fresh basil and hot sauce.

This dish was great--I made it with the Cornish game hens and it was fantastic. Simple and quick--I used frozen corn and leeks instead of onions.

This was awesome! I'm not being sarcastic here, but this is an amazingly delicious way to turn something relatively healthy (basically corn) into something decadent (add tons of cream!). The kick from the Tabasco (er, I mean non-specific hot pepper sauce) is a great addition. I had never heard of Macque Choux before, but I am ready to experiment now because this is a new favorite side dish!

Fabulous! When I saw this as the side dish to a meal that I was making I was worried that it would be my least favorite part. What a surprise! Not only did it steal the show, but I plan on replacing my Christmas creamed corn with this recipe. Loved it!

I have to admit that when I saw this as a side dish for a dish I was making I fully expected it to be my least favorite part. What a surprise! It not only was my favorite part but it will become a permanant part of my repertoire! Wonderful and surprising. I'm going to replace my Christmas creamed corn with this recipe. Fabulous!
