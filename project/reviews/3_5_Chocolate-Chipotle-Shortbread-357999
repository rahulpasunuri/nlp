I like a thicker shortbread, so I pressed the whole batch of dough into a 9" springform cake pan and baked it for 18 minutes. Perfect! Served with cinnamon ice cream: incredibly easy crowd pleaser.

For superfine sugar, just put regular sugar in the food processor and give it about 5 one-second pulses. Added 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and upped the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. Loved how the flavors turned out. The dough was fairly dry but I let my Kitchenaid mixer do the work and it combined the dough so that it was pliable and easy to work with. Next time, I would probably double the recipe. I like my shortbread a little thicker so I didn't give this recipe four stars.

Super easy and delicious. Tastes great, even the first day! Followed recipe exactly...although I do believe my rounds were a bit thicker than 1/4 inch. Perhaps more like 1/3.

I made two batches of this as well. I was unable to find superfine sugar, but didn't notice any difference. I also had trouble finding a chipotle chili powder so I substituted a Southwestern powder rub (with chili and cayenne)-I actually would add a bit more next time. Had no trouble with it being too crumbly, it is so delicious! I don't think I will ever make it in just one batch!

This dough was a little too dry and crumbly which made it difficult to roll. Next time I'd reduce the flour a bit. The taste is great though.

I doubled the recipe and might not have used soft enough butter so the mix was crumbly. I worked it with my hands into hamburger-sized "patties" and then scored those in 4 and gently poked holes. After 13 minutes of baking they were done and they were delicious! Love the chocolate-smoky taste that lingers in your mouth!

I made this last night and it was easy and turned out well. Cutting the shortbread the second time requires some care. I think the recipe is light on cinnamon, so I added a little extra.

This shortbread is very good. The consistency is perfect (moist but still crumbly). When you first bite into it you taste the chocolate and the cinnamon, but as you swallow you begin tasting the chipotle. Since I'm not the hugest fan of chipotle I used 1/4 teaspoon as opposed to a half. And, it is true that the flavor becomes a little more pleasing a day after baking. Yum!
