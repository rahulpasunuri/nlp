Really delicious, fresh, and light. I replaced baked tofu for the calamari. Also, I used more interesting oils like peanut, olive, and walnut to add more flavors. I bet some toasted sesame oil would be even better.

We love this dish and being in a hot climate finding a nice cool refreshing dinner is such a treat! Just make sure to cut the noodles as instructed.

This recipe is quick, easy and delicious. I've made it for friends several times and have always been asked for the recipe. It is especially good on a warm evening. I use frozen vacuum packed calamari and slice it when it is not quite thawed. At first I thought it called for too much lime juice, but that is not the case.

After reading the previous review, I decided to try to put some additional Asian flair into this recipe, and it came out delicious. The most significant change I made was to use 4 tablespoons toasted sesame oil and 2 tablespoons of olive oil, instead of vegetable oil. I also added a shake of garlic powder to the dressing, maybe 1/4 teaspoon or so. I also made some other simple changes, mostly out of convenience. After juicing 2 limes I only had 5 tbsp. lime juice, so I added 1 tbsp of mirin wine. Instead of sugar, I added a heaping teaspoon of honey. Finally, to give it some finish, I grated a little lemon zest over the top, then did a couple shakes of black sesame seeds, which added a unique texture and appearance. The first time I made it I served guests, and everyone raved.

Seafood night at the game and, Well, this one was a tough sell. It was eaten but no one was smiling and they didnt ask for seconds. It tasted great, Calamari done just right, it just missed on the acceptance. Oh Well, it is a good cold buffet bar dish for a group not as critical as a bunch of Poker Guys.
