I'm not a great fan of Japanese soups, but as far a as miso soup goes, this is good. I agree with the other reviewer--some hot oil or toasted sesame oil would be good in it. This tastes exactly like the traditional miso soups that I've eaten in Japanese restaurants. I've saved it in my recipe box--good healing soup for an upset tummy.

Loved this dish! It has a lot of flavor and it felt very healing to eat. The only changes I made were that I added a few enoki mushrooms that I found in the store where I bought the kombu, and a tiny bit of hot chili oil which added a slight kick.
