also, i used dried oregano since I don't like the flavor of fresh oregano and it was still delicious.

YUM! i made with sardines and served at a cocktail party with a cheese plate and charcuterie and it was a hit! I will cut back on the salad dressing next time since the marinade is is essentially a dressing in itself. But this is a keeper for guests who are afraid of bold flavors.

I made this salad for a new year's eve Italian celebration. Everyone LOVED it, and wanted the recipe. I only used 1 can of anchovies, knowing some don't like the taste, but I can see how it really adds to the flavor. I am making it again tonight!

What are we using, anchovies or sardines?

I made this with boneless skinless sardines and loved it. I especially love the marinade, which I also use as a salad dressing. Very light and lemony with a bit of elegance. I only wish the site showed a picture.

I wanted to make something special to go with my wild mushroom risotto and found this wonderful recipe. Being a greens and anchovies fan, I was pleased with how well the flavours worked together and my guests were enthralled, to say the least. Give it a go and I don't believe you'll be disappointed. I'll be making this again and again and again.
