This is fabulous. Changes depending on the cider you choose. Use Santa Cruz Organic Sweet Apple Cider from California if you can get it. It was so much better than the really good, internationally acclaimed, local cider. Sigh...

Yummy twist on regular caramel. Wonderful over baked apples, too.

Sauce needs longer to thicken, too much apple-cider, needs to stand longer . . . if I made it again I would reduce the cider by a third.
