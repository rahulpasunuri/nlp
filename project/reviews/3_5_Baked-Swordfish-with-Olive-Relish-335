This has been a family favorite for years. I omit the anchovies - if you have any left over, it's great the next day without them, but fishy if you've used them.

We just made the tapanad to go with a piece of marlin we grilled. It was perfect. I did use the anchovies, and it really adds a nice depth without making it taste "fishy." Didn't have red pepper, so used sun dried tomatoes, which I think work even better. The idea of including some fresh tomatoes is also intriguing. Will try that next time.

This was easy to prepare & delicious. I actually had a huge jar of Paisana olive & roasted pepper mix, which provided most of ingredients for the relish, except that I had to pit all of the olives. I left out the anchovies & the topping was piquant enough with the remaining ingredients. Served this with cauliflower leek puree, since we eat low-carb. Speaking of which, this is a great low-carb dish!

Skipped the anchovies, added a couple of halved cherry tomatoes and plan to do it again and again. This is a keeper.

Excellent recipe. Just go easy when serving; the olives could make the dish a little salty for those on a salt restricted diet.

this was good, but I think I used olives that were too strong. I had only oil cured kalamatas which have a VERY strong taste and they overpowered the fish a little. I also used balsalmic not red wine vinegar which has a stronger taste. I tossed in some tomatoes as I had some "grape" cherry tomatoes about to go bad, and they were delicious. Served with couscous and asparagus. I used the left over olive relish, asparagus and couscous to make a salad inspired by TOMATO, BASIL AND COUSCOUS SALAD (on epicurious) and it was delicious as well.

This recipe was incredible!! My fiance and I love olives, so we found the relish delicious...we wished we had more for a brushetta topping! It is really a restaurant quality meal.

FANTASTIC! This might be the tastiest, easiest fish dish I ever prepared. I didn't have anchovies for the relish but I just left them out and it was still delicious. Amazing, I can't wait to serve this at my next dinner party.

This was great- and easy! My dinner guest loved it. I didn't use swordfish. I used another type of white fish and it was still wonderful.

An easy to follow recipe with a very colorful result. The relish is wonderful with pasta as suggested! (We were sure to double it and were happy we did.) My husband has said that I will definately need to make this again.

This was a terrific recipe, easy to make and the flavors were good match for the richness of the swordfish. I used anchovy paste instead of whole anchovies, and added some regular black olives because we had them in the fridge. Will definitely make this again and again.

This is really an excellent dish! I ave made it at least every 10 days.

I substituted the parsley with cilantro, and barbecued the swordfish steaks; served with garbanzos (chick peas) cooked in pot, and bbq'd potato slices, plus 1 or 2 prawns (shrimp), and bottle of chardonnay. Very nice combination, and I look forward to trying the olive relish with pasta shells. My main field(s) of culinary interest is Mexican/seafood.
