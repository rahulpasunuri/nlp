Fab-u-lious! Easy to make. I took the suggestion of others and made with 47 nilla cookies. Also served with a touch of whip cream. And like so many others totally agree that you would never put food coloring in this. My guests loved it too. I will make this a regular on the menu. Yum!

Everyone raves for this pie! This recipe is so quick and simple. I like to use about 46 vanilla wafers and 6 Tbls. butter for a thicker crust, and serve it with whipped cream with a bit of sugar whipped in, since the pie is so tart. Fantastic recipe.

Actually, got my math wrong on the below review; thought the crust had 6 T of butter but it's only 4. I guess maybe I'll use 45 wafers and 5 tablespoon of butter for the crust next time(although that might be a little too much).

This took like 15 minutes to put together and was delicious. I made the crust with Nilla wafers and found it was a tiny bit too thin. I think I would increase to 42 wafers and 7 T of butter next time. And I thought it was beautiful as is--doesn't need food coloring. Served it with home-made whipped cream.

I increased the lime juice to a full cup and used a ready-made graham cracker crust that I had on hand. This pie is so creamy, so smooth, bursting with tart-sweet flavor, I am embarrassed to admit that I personally have consumed half the pie myself since I made it last night.

This is one of the best lime pies ever and a favorite of family and friends. I skip the lime slices on top but add the extra lime peel for contrast. Adding food coloring would ruin it. Every time I make it-I've made it many times-I get requests for the recipe. The last request was from good friends visiting from France.

Made this for my husband and he raves it is the best key lime pie he has ever had ( and he grew up Florida). I did use the crust from another epicurious recipe "key lime pie with almond crust" to make it alittle fancier. Easy to make and great reviews!

I've been making this pie for year's to rave reviews. I use store bought limes (not bottled or concentrate). Real key lime pie is not true green. Adding food coloring is absurd. THis is a tart pie with a sweet crust. Not to be beat! :)

I agree with the cook from Wayne, NJ that this is not the prettiest dessert in the world. However, I used fresh lime juice and made my own vanilla wafer crust and it was quite good but a little too tart. Next time I will use whipped cream as a topping to mellow out the tartness of the pie.

yum, but honestly the ugliest dessert I ever made. I placed a layer of mango on top, but still, I would suggest the food coloring as pie is the blandest yellow/beige color. I used bottled key lime juice and a purchased vanilla wafer crust, so just about as quick and easy as they come. Nice tart flavor which went great with mango.

This pie is very good (a little on the tart side), but if you like lime pie with a whipped cream layer on top there is a wonderful recipe on the martha stewart web site for key lime pie that does not require much more work.

This pie would not set, though I cooked it for almost 40 minutes. Tasted WONDERFUL, but had a most unpleasant-looking curdled-custard looking texture. I'm not sure where I went wrong.

This pie was very tasty and very simple to make. I made a graham cracker crust because I had a box of graham crackers in the cupboard. Additionally I used fat free sweetened condensed milk and a little extra lime juice (made the pie a little less sweet).

This pie was great! I used a graham-cracker crust, though. I thought the lime flavor was just right. The pie was tart but sweet also.

It's so simple to keep the ingredients for this delicious pie on-hand that it's become my standard contribution to dinner parties. I recently made the pie for someone who cannot physically tolerate egg yolks and excess fat (digestive problems), so I also used fat-free sweetened condensed milk and egg beaters. Guess what...it was every bit as delicious.

The BEST lime pie I've ever had! I used a graham cracker crust - It really was superb!

So delicious. So easy. A great summertime dessert. I used a homemade graham cracker crust, which worked well.

So, so easy! I also added the juice from one tangerine to mellow out the tartness (I'm lucky enough to have a tree in my backyard.) After I had chilled the pie, I realized the "presentation" wasn't really polished, so I mixed together some sour cream and a small amount of brown sugar for a topping. This topping ended up working out nicely because the pie would have been way too sweet as it was. I then thinly sliced lime rounds and placed them in the center of each potential slice. It looked so professional my friends thought I bought it from a restaurant.

This is a fabulous and easy to make pie. I lowered the fat by using fat free condensed milk and egg beaters. It was delicious. Next time I'll try using lowfat vanilla wafers and soy margarine/butter.

Easy, delicious. The only thing about the recipe is that it comes out yellow and not that typical green shade that I expected. I guess you can add food coloring if that's important to you. I also skipped the Nilla Wafers and opted for a Keebler 9" ready-made shortbread pie crust. I topped the pie with whipped cream before serving, offsetting the tartness and making it look pretty.

I love this straightforward lime pie--great flavor and textures. There's nothing I hate more than to order an "old fashioned" lime pie and get one made with cream cheese! This is the way it should be. It's easy and yummy. We like the crust made with gingersnaps.

I was hoping that my Thanksgiving guests would prefer the pumpkin pie to the lime so I'd have leftovers, but no such luck!

THIS WAS SO EASY & QUICK TO MAKE. IT HAS A TART-LIKE TEXTURE WHICH WENT PERFECT WITH A PASTRY SHELL. NEXT TIME I'LL MAKE SURE TO HAVE FRESH RASBERRIES & KIWI TO TOP IT WITH, MMMMM.

This is an extremely easy recipe to make. I substituted graham crackers for the vanilla wafers and it worked out well. My family enjoyed it immensely. It's a great change-of-pace dessert.

This pie features an excellent crust and tangy, creamy filling. It is easy to make and my book group loved it!
