My kids ate these up! I did add 2 more eggs and more flour, based on the previous review. A small price to pay for yummy fried sweet potato goodness! Stop complaining and eat!

I read the reviews and planned accordingly. I used only one HUGE sweet potato for 3 people.(I did not use the Jalapenos and didn't make the salsa) I did use 2 eggs and the 2 T of flour, mixed it up and then added a little more flour and even a little corn meal (I'm a Texas girl) until the raw potato stuck together before I put them in the hot oil. I also drained them very well before I cooked them. I whipped up some sour cream and lemon zest to dip them in. They were scrumdiliumpcious

The below reviewer is absolutely correct. These do not bind at all. Hahbrowns, not a great Chanukkah latke.

I halved the recipe because it was only for two people. There is not nearly enough to bind the potatoes together so I ended up with more of a hash brown situation. They didn't taste bad (they weren't great either), but it was also not at all what we were interested in cooking.
