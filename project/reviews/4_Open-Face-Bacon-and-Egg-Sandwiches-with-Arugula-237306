So delicious and simple. A perfect blend of tastes and looks great too. I would make this and serve it to guests. I cooked by bacon in the oven between parchment to make it even easier.

The flavors in this dish are Amazing. I made it for Mother's Day brunch and it had the guests begging for more and dreaming about arugula. Made it exatly as is. No one could believe how good it was. Simple and easy. Will make again and again.

As another reviewer said I first used this recipe to use up leftover arugula but now arugula cries out to me at the market reminding me of this delicious gem!

Wow. The recipe didn't sound like anything special, but with all these rave reviews, I had to try it. I'm so glad I did! The shallots and peppery arugula add an intense complexity to the humble McMuffin, for a fabulous mid-week dinner or brunch. And quick - took me longer to clean up than to make it.

I needed a recipe to use up some arugula (which isn't one of my favorite things to begin with.) This sounded OK if a bit different. I would never imagined that it would be SO good! I'd go out of my way to get arugula to make this again.

We make it exactly as described, and LOVE it. We've made this sandwich for guests many many times. The dressing is now a staple on all of our dinner salads.

All Hail Nick! This is an instant favorite. Used English muffin halves because we didn't have anything else. Sublime. Never knew eggs could be this good. I will dream about this combination.

We loved this dish. Made it just as written, and both DH and I practically licked the plate.

Very good. We used prosciutto in place of bacon, perfect.

Used Challah left over from Rosh Hashanah, and added a bit of fresh mozzarella on top of the warm bread. The best breakfast ever.

Perfect. Don't change a thing. This is good for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, I didn't serve it with anything because it already has bread, meat, and vegetables.

yum! easy and delicious! I made this for dinner and served it with a side of baked sweet potato fries. I used thick cut applewood smoked bacon which added a subtle smokey flavor. I didn't have ciabatta, but instead used slices of asiago sourdough. Will definitely make again

so good and so easy for a weeknight dinner. all the ingredients were in perfect proportion.

Great recipe, but to make it easier on a weekend morning with a hangover (which is why we make the eggs in the first place, right?), use a fresh salsa rather than the shallot vinaigrette. Ready to go!

The combination of all ingrediants makes this an outstanding breakfast dish.

A very good sandwich. Used baby greens instead of arugula. I used top and a bottom of ciabatta, cutting the top half thinner, about 1/4 of the bun and bottom half thicker, about 3/4 of the bun.Used LaBrea ciabatta from Costco. Super.
