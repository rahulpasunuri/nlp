I'm not much of a fan of layered pate, and omitted the ham but added 200g of minced pork liver to the mix in order to make up the weight. I also added both the green peppercorns and the pestachios suggested by other reviewers and served the result for an Easter Lunch together with a cold roast turkey, pickles and various salads. It was such a hit, we've added it to our list of 'things to serve as cold cuts'. The recipe does produce A LOT of pate, but that hasn't seemed to present us with any problems so far. I've used the same mixture to form burgers, which hold together well when fried in just a very little oil. My teenagers like these as much as they like the cold pate, which is saying something.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a hit! I did not put in as much ham fearing that it would become too salty. Next time I will add the 6 oz. of ham. I added white peppercorns (partially crushed with mortar & pestle). I am happy that there are leftovers!

I agree that this makes A LOT of the pork mixture, so I made two. I followed the recipe exactly for the first but added a layer of salt capers and pine nuts under the ham for the second one. The first is in the oven so we will have to see if the flavours end up as good as they smell right now!

I love this recipe. I eliminated the bacon and allspice and added 12oz. of Jimmy Dean bulk sage sausage to the mix. Also, I cut the ham into 1/2" cubes and added this to the mix. I found that warming, then lightly grilling the pate', greatly enhances the flavor.

Delicious, classic pate de campagne. I wouldn't change a thing. I like the idea of adding pistachios. But this recipe is terrific. Don't need to change a thing.

Took this to a new year's eve party and got rave reviews. I did add pistachios as I love them in pate. Next time I think I will also add green peppercorns as I like a little more umph to my pate.

Forgive the question, but shouldn't the internal temperature register 185 degrees? The Joy of Cooking, p406.

So I made this dish today, for a weekly "Family" dinner. Everyone really liked it. A couple things, I swapped out the Ham Steak for chicken Livers (very nice touch). The Pate was not too rich but had great flavor. Make sure to stir it up quite well, and also pack it in to the "meatloaf pan" tightly. Mine was a little crumbly, because I did not pack it tightly. That being said, it still was wonderful and maybe added a little more "country" to it. Everythign was wonderful and I will make this again.

Delicious but very rich, and I even omitted the ham as another reviewer suggested. I did not add the full amount of spices but would follow the recipe exactly next time. Even though I cooked it the exact time, the bacon covering it looked a bit pale when it was done. However, it looked much more atractive after it was sliced. I had taken it to my book club which is full of "foodies", and the recipe was requested.

I have made this twice, once following the recipe, more recently improving it. After reading through Julia Child's recipes (almost all the same), I reduced the pork to 2 pounds, added chicken breast I ground and used pork belly instead of the bacon. In addition I added diced chicken liver, skipped the ham, and added pistachios and peppercorns. One useful tip from JC is to fry up a good tablespoon of the mix to test the seasonings, remembering that it will be much less tasty the colder your serve it. Second batch -- and it makes a ton -- was tastier by far, particularly if you let it come closer to room temperature. If you are going to serve it cold, consider upping the spices. Certainly reminded me of many slices I've had in Paris.

I made this last July for a friend's Bastille Day party and it got a warm reception all around. Being vegetarian I cannot speak for the taste and texture, but these aspects won big points with the guests, who were initially a bit wary of the giant bacon-wrapped brick. Next time, I would leave out the ham steak layer; it didn't seem to enhance the texture and to be honest- there's plenty of meat in there already. I will caution a) This is traditional rustic pate as opposed to the smoother spreadable kind. It's rich and kind of heavy for crackers. One slice on some baguette with Dijon and a cornichon is a meal in itself, and b) While construction and prep are actually quite easy, cleanup is not. This created more melted meat fat than any other recipe I have ever made. I went through two sponges and my loaf pan and kitchen smelled of bacon for some time. That said, it was a fruitful adventure in French country cooking and I'd be up for it again soon.

This was tasty- but kind of big and weird looking. Would def make several smaller sizes next time. Spices were nice, but sort of faint. Tastes like a very fancy lunch meat, but yummy! Also, added the pistachios. Unfortunately, my guests were not that crazy about it. Will serve with pickled shallots from F & W if I make again. I thought the mustard or pickles overpowered it.

This is really a great pate. I served it at a Christmas party and converted a lot of newbies. It does make a huge amount but freezes well. Perfect with the salt and a little Dijon and pickles.

My first time making this dish and I will be making it MANY more times in my lifetime. I followed the recipe as written but also added two more ingredients, pistachios and chicken livers (the livers being added in a neat row down the middle). I found it really important to weight it down to make it compact. This makes a LOT so, after it was completely cooled down I put it in the fridge. The next morning I inverted it and cut it into 1 1/2 inch slices. I individually wrapped those slices in parchment, then foil and put them all into a freezer ziplock bag and froze what I didn't need immediately. They freeze beautifully! A gem of a recipe served along side some crusty french bread dijon and pickles.

This is the first recipe that I have made from epicurious and I loved it. The problem is that I made too much and fear a coronary if I eat it all in one sitting. Can I freeze this for a party a couple weeks from now?

I confess that I was initially intimidated by this recipe, being a new comer to the world of pates. This recipe was simple to make, and turned out beautifully. This is now my standard contribution to any cheese and wine party, and there is never a morsel left. My friends think that I am an accomplished cook, and I don't want to tell them how simple this is to make and shatter thier illusions.

As the others have said this is easy and turns out great. I added the pistachios which gave it a very nice look on the buffet table. It does make way too much, I had enough left to make a second one but did not have another loaf pan, so you can reduce the amount or prepare a second pan.

By far, one of the best pates I have ever made, and I have made (and tasted)a lot. Definitely a classic pate de compagne one would find in any charcuterie in France. There is a lot of filling; use a sheet pan under your loaf pan. When you finish cooking and weigh this down, it compresses and the texture is amazing. I do agree with other reviewers that the addition of pistachios would add good flavor and crunch. Don't be afraid to make this, it's simple, and simply divine. I converted non-pate eaters with this recipe.

Simply the BEST Pate I have ever made. I can't wait to make it for our annual Christmas Party. I think I'll have to make 2 loaves. One for the party and one for Us!

Before making this recipe it is a good idea to look at some alternative recipes. I found the end result a little too fatty. It would be an idea to replace the bacon in the pork mixture with maybe ham trimmed of its fat. I think a small amount of pork or chicken liver would give it an extra edge. Use a pinch of Thyme rather than 1 and half Tsp. Definately add some pistachios and something like cranberries would be visually interesting (and tastey). Breadcrumbs might be useful for body and texture. The recipe here is ok but it is a little simplified. Also, cooking time is a lot less than the time stated here at the temperature stated. At 300F it will cook in about an hour. If you leave it longer you will get a very dry pate. Good luck!

Delicious and not difficult to make. I could not find ground pork, so I ground my own boneless country-style ribs in the food processor. I think the end result was too dry because of overworking the mixture, but everyone else loved it. I also baked it in two smaller loaf pans. Definitely try it!

As another reviewer noted, there's way too much pork mixture for the loaf pan specified; I made a second one in a smaller pan (cooked for about an hour less - let the thermometer be your guide) and still had meat left over . This isn't a complaint, just a warning! In future, I'll use about three-quarters the quantity of pork. I'll also reduce the salt by about two-thirds - the bacon seems to provide plenty. But it's a delicious and authentic paté, somehow both rustic and sophisticated, easy to prepare and a great starter for a dinner party, especially when the main course is something relatively light, like fish.

We have been looking for a country pate and this is delicious. Another cook suggested it needed something more and we agree it could use the brined green peppercorns or pistachios. I don't enjoy a strong allspice flavor, so we used only 1 tsp. This is a new favorite.

This recipe was a big hit for a recent brunch! Very easy (if you can make a meatloaf, you can make this) This recipe will be added to my favorites!

Top notch pate, but there is way too much filling. Either cut back on the amount, or make pan fried patties with the remainder like I did. Also, there is no need for 14 slices of bacon. I think I only needed 8 to line a loaf pan. Delicious.

I would make this again but go lighter on the garlic cloves or consider using roasted garlic instead.

My husband, who is from and loves pate, made it and it turned out GREAT! Much better than he expected. Now he wants to make it with chicken livers...

Thought it was amazing. I'm offended when people DO NOT follow the recipe or use common sense and rate recipes. Was fabulous!

This is incredible. I had eaten a country pate many times before but never even considered making it. I followed the recipe to the letter, but added some decoration. Before layering the bacon into the pan, i put a few sage leaves and thyme sprigs in a simple pattern- it looks very professional when you finally invert the pate and serve it. My guests devoured this, seriously. Make sure you have enough bread!!

This was the first pate / terrine I've ever made. Was really easy to prepare and turned out wonderfully! Agree that it needs one other ingredient (pistachios, peppercorn or something else) but current recipe makes a fantastic dish

So easy and really good! I made this before the holidays and served it at quite a few cocktail gatherings and it won rave reviews. I am a very accomplished cook and no one could believe I made this myself! I will definitely make it again, and agree with the previous review that the addition of some pistachios would be nice.

My family loves a good pate. This was fairly easy to make, although I did use fresh pork belly slices from the Asian market,(instead of the bacon) which I ground myself in my food processor. The author is right in the comment that it needs the fat! The chief comment from the eaters was that country pate should be coarser in texture. Otherwise, the flavor was okay. I think some pistachios and peppercorns might be a nice addition. The technique was very helpful. I weighted the cooked pate down with two bricks covered with aluminum foil. Definitely eat in the French manner with the cornichons and mustard!
