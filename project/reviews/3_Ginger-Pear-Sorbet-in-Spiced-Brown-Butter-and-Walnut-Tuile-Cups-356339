I actually thought this was easy and delicious. The only change I made was to use Absolut Pear Vodka instead of the Pear Liquor and it worked out perfectly. When I make it again, I'll probably add more ginger or maybe some candied ginger for an added kick.

Sorbet problematic but salvageable - and WAY too much sugar! I made this to serve between courses at our Thanksgiving dinner. I didn't make the walnut tuile cups, so can't speak to that part of the recipe. For sorbet, I immediately cut the sugar in the recipe to 1 cup, but were I to make it again, would use less- maybe just 1/2 cup. I doubled the amount of lemon peel and ginger and still found it bland after pureeing. Ended up correcting it by adding some freshly grated ginger directly to puree and the juice of a whole lemon. Then it was good. Froze very hard in the container after processing in the ice cream maker, so had to thaw before scooping out. It was good, but my fork rating reflects the amount of adjustment I needed to make to the recipe. After making it, I wondered if a much easier route to same result would be to simply the poach the pears is a high-quality strong ginger beer, maybe adding some lemon, though there might be enough in the beverage to begin with, and then puree and process in the ice cream maker. Used leftover sorbet to make nice cocktail in food processor w/vodka, more lemon juice, and a bit of pear liquor.
