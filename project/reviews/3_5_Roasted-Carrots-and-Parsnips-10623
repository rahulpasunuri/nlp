I have made this every year for Thanksgiving since it was published in Gourmet. Everyone loves it! What a tragedy that Gourmet magazine is gone now! No cooking magazine compares!

I tried this for the first time today, and it was a big hit! The vegetables roast nicely, getting slightly sweet and carmelized. Somehow they come out tasting like sweet potato fries. I will definitely make these again.

Actually disagree with the last reviewer. As a balanced and uncomplicated side this works great. I subsituted some fennel for the parsnips, but the carrots, simply roasted, were the star of the show. Love the chili oil idea further down and will try that next time

This is a fine recipe but a bit dull, even with garlic and chili oil added. I was looking for an elegant and simple vegetable side for Thanksgiving. I am still looking.

The home page called this Balsamic Carrots. Where is the Balsamic in this recipe? Selma P.

I love roasted veggies like this. Oftentimes, I also include yams/sweet potatoes cut into a steak fry shape. They're a big hit with everyone. For an interesting twist, coat the veggies in olive oil and chili powder. Delish!

I make this dish a lot in the winter, but I toss the veggies in a little butter and add some cinnamon and brown sugar. Excellent with pork chops.

Perfect dish to any roast meat or poultry. A regular at an Irish Sunday dinner. Try adding onions and garlic and even celery. Lash in some herbs too. If you want it more flavorful, add juice from the meat you are roasting. Irish in Iowa.

I make this recipe with Roast Turkey or a large roast beef, allowing 2 hr. minimum for veggies to cook. They soak up some of the juices, end up being caramelized by them and are oh so yummy. All former parsip haters love this. Just don't tell them its parsnips!

So easy. So yummy. Why didn't I think of it before? I'll definitely make these again.

the carrots were well-received (i hate parsnips) by people who claim to hate carrots. cooking time was a bit too long, though. reduce to 10 minutes for more crunch. add a touch of garlic powder or use lemon pepper for variation.

Excellent dish. I made it for Christmas and had rave reviews. Even the kids liked it!
