Followed other versions as well... with a little alteration: 1 onion thinly sliced, 2 lg garlic cloves minced, 1/2 cup sliced baby bellas, 3 T of butter, 2t herbs de provence, 1t thyme, 1t rosemary, 1.5 cups cubed leftover lamb, 1 cup rice, 1 cup red wine, 2 1/2 cups beef broth and 1 cup fresh peas. I sauteed onions and mushrooms for about 8 minutes and then added garlic for another 5 minutes over medium heat in a cast iron skillet until golden. At the same time, brought to a boil, 1 1/2 cups beef broth and same amount of water, then added rice and simmered for about 15 minutes. I then combined everything prior and remaining for about 5-7 minutes into the skillet. Funny color, but great flavor.

I prefer the classic shepherd's pie recipe, i use my grandmothers, but i noticed http://feastonthecheap.wordpress.com has a very delicious-sounding lamb Shepherd's pie recipe too

my version....2 onions thinly sliced, 1 lg garlic clove minced, 2 T of butter, 1t herbs de provence, 1.5 cups cubed leftover lamb, 1 cup rice, 1 cup red wine, 1 cup beef broth. I sauteed onions and garlic in butter 10 minutes over high heat until golden, added rice, then added lamb, then herbes and wine and broth cooking on stove top until rice was tender (adding a little water and salt) and it was a very savory dish. would definitely make again.

After reading the reviews I used red wine instead of the broth, rice pasta spirals instead of regular rice and about 1 Tsp of herbes de provence and it was delicious. I had 3 helpings. My husband really liked it too.

After reading the mixed reviews, I wasn't sure what to expect. I used onions, mushrooms, dried thyme, worcestershire, peas, and the leftover Easter lamb cut into chunks in a cup of beef stock (didn't have any gravy). At first it was pretty liquid, but when I added the rice, everything came together. As with another reviewer, I didn't even bake it. Just warmed everything together in a Dutch oven. My teenage son had two helpings and even my non-lamb loving husband said it was good. I thought the thyme added a nice flavor and will definitely make it again next year. It was quick and easy with a good flavor.

This was just ok-- it pretty much just tasted like heated, leftover lamb with rice. It was fine to eat, but nothing special. Maybe I needed to doctor it up more.

Anything is better than leftover lamb! Followed other reviewers' suggestions including brown rice, Worcestershire, peas, chicken broth and it produced a reasonably tasty alternative to throwing leftover BBQ lamb away.

This recipe was surprisingly good for the few ingredients it used. I read all the other reviews and added thyme, peas, worcestershire, a mix of white and wild rice, and the leftover pinot noir instead of gravy. I don't really like reheated lamb, but even my 14 year old said it was really good.

After reading the reviews of this recipe, I was expecting much more. It was OK, but nothing special. My husband and I kept putting a mildish hot sauce on it to spark it up a bit. I might try it again using mint and pine nuts for contrast, and a middle-eastern spin. The kids hated it.

this was just as the other (positive) reviewers promised:easy, quick, forgiving, and delicious. my husband said he wasn't very hungry before he sat down, then had 4 helpings! he ate almost half the dish by himself! not a "pretty" dish, but when i reheat it, i think i'll grate some parmesan on top & brown it like another reviewer suggested. i, too, used worcester (a bunch), some brown seasoning liquid, red wine (which we were drinking as i cooked, just threw some in;) ), condensed cream of mushroom soup, and thyme & cilantro. also tossed in some celery i wanted to use up. very homey & comforting.

This just wasn't that good, which surprised me after all the great reviews. I might make it again (what else do you do with leftover lamb?) and change a couple of things to see how I missed the first time.

I thought this recipe was too simple to be really good, but it was...so good I had to have seconds. The gravy makes this extra creamy and just perfect for a cold night. I added some steak sauce, wine, and wostershire sauce to spice up the lamb a bit, and used chicken broth as a base to my gravy, and warmed the lamb in it for a while and it tasted just like lamb gravy. Cooked the quick rice in the onions to give it a little extra flavor. all in all really yum:)

This is an inspirational recipe. It enabled me to use leftovers from a dinner party! I added a (leftover)red wine-port reduction sauce to the mix as well as coarsley chopped (leftover) grilled portobello mushroom. I used leftover toasted orzo pilaf with peas and parmesan in place of the rice. Great dish and will definitely do it again.

I added a tablespoon of spicey brown steak sauce. Worchestershire sauce would be good too. Some type of chopped green herb is important, but more rosemary was too harsh. Steamed beet greens were great. During my childhood, James Beard and Julia Child were the epitome of 60s food, modern and American for all the French style and tradition. My mother nursed her children to Julia's cooking show on PBS. I was delighted to find this recipe after Easter this year, when "leftover lamb" was the only thing I could think to search under.

Great way to use left-over lamb! I sauteed both red and white onions, extra garlic, sliced mushrooms and artichoke hearts. I used a can of cream of mushroom soup (Healthy Request) instead of the gravy and added left-over rice pilaf and a few spears of left-over asparagus. It was so good bubbling in the pan after it was all thrown together, I didn't bother to bake it. My husband had thirds!

WOW, whata suprise this one was! I used what I had around the house which wasn't much, so the dish was seasoned with fresh sage and fresh mint. Used lots of garlic and a mix of white and brown rice. No lamb broth, so a mixture of beef broth and red wine sufficed. Delicious!!

This was a hit with my picky family. I used pork instead of Lamb because I had the leftovers. I used pork gravy from a can and I also included thyme. It was delicious. I served it with tomato salad.

I added fried diced eggplant and cr. of mushroom and cr. of celey soup. I didn't mix the rice into the lamb mix, I spooned the rice into a casserole dish and spread the lamb mixture over it. mmm mmm delicious.

Very good, and easy though I changed the recipe a bit. Used long grain wild rice and put a rosemary twig while cooking the rice and removed before mixing the whole mess up, used 3 garlic cloves, sauteing them with the onions. Lost the lamb broth (found it later) so used Condensed cream of mushroom soup instead, added some peas because I wanted to get rid of them, and about 2 tbs of red wine vinegar. For show I sprinkled on a 1/2 cup of parmesean cheese and broiled it about 5 minutes before serving to get that cool bubbly brown thing happening. Will definately make it again!

Delicious...and far better than the roast lamb that I used to make this recipe! I, too, added lots of thyme and an extra clove of garlic.

I made a variation. I omitted the rice from the main casserole, and I added tons of thyme. After baking, I served it over white rice. Delicious! Much better than reheated lamb.

Quick and easy to make. My husband, who is not crazy about rice or left over lamb, raved about it. Excellent flavor -- perhaps because I used the "Green olive, lemon and garlic roast lamb" recipe to begin with.
