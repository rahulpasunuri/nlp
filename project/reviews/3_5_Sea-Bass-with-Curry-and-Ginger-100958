Great for entertaining! I substituted coconut milk for the nonfat milek as well and simmered the fish in the marinade! No need for arrowroot, the sauce thickened nicely without it - served over brown rice. This is spicey and delicious.

Huge hit with my husband and other adult friends. The kids didn't really like it. I hate when people change the recipe and then review it, however...I skipped the turmeric because I didn't have any, we didn't miss it. And since I served it over coconut rice, I skipped the extract. I didn't have skim milk, so I decided to use coconut milk, AMAZING. Like another reviewer, when I made it another time with 1% milk, it curdled.

As my wife and I prepared the recipe we were very concerned because it appeared the curry was separating as it cook and the presentation was going to be poor. When we removed the fish from the sauces we both thought that there was too much of the curry spices stuck to the fillets. Once we followed thru we were very pleased. The presentation was ok...not great....but the taste was outstanding. Very authentic. We added shrimp and used fresh Sea Trout that I had caught the previous day instead of Sea Bass. Very spicy....you need to make sure your guests like it "hot". I would give this 4 forks.

This is a fabulous dish. I always use coconut milk and when sea bass isn't available use grouper. This is a keeper!

A really great dish on lots of counts -- easy and fast for weekday dinners, yet flavorful and attractive to make it seem special. I used halibut which worked great (and cut marinade time down to 60 minutes). There is a definite spicy kick, but I served it with jasmine rice cooked in lowfat coconut milk which helped temper the heat. Definiter keeper.

I don't know what went wrong - I followed the recipe as laid out but the milk curdled and I ended up with a very unattractive watery sauce with curds throughout - a big flop. I did use 1% milk instead of non-fat but I doubt that was the culprit. I'll stick to the tried and true recipes for Thai curries using real coconut milk and save the fat somewhere else. Good luck!

I couldn't get Sea Bass and didn't have time to marinade for 2 hours. So, I purchased Skate and it worked wonderfully. It only needed 30 minutes in the curry sauce. My boyfriend was SO impressed by this simple yet flavorful dish. He thinks I can cook now!

Divine recipe - but I forced it to be flexible. I made this with green curry base because when I went to the fridge I found that I run out of red (oops!). It actually turned out fantastically. I left out the tumeric and sugar and substituted a bit of real cocunut cream for extract because I preferred the idea. It was a treat even if it was exactly what I had planned. Thank goodness for flexibility.

This delicious dish is in my top-ten favorites from Epicurious, with its subtle coconut flavor and rich sauce. Wonderful over Koda rice, we will have it often. Easy to prepare, too!

This has become a regular dish for company. It is really, really good and not at all over the top if you like flavorful food. It's very easy and healthy too. I serve with jasmine rice and salad with toasted cashews and mandarin oranges.

What can you use instead of clam juice? I don't eat any shellfish.

Very tasty, and saves a lot of calories by not using coconut milk. My wife and I love Thai food and this is a very nice low cal/low fat version. We used sea bass and also artic char, but the next time I think I will try it with skinless chicken breast or sliced pork or sirloin. BTW, it was just as good reheated the nxt day.

This is an absolutely wonderful and super easy dish to fix. Oh yes, very spicy, so you really need some ice tea (or a cucumber/sour cream salad) for a cool down. I used orange roughy and cooked it just a tad less. Didn't have fresh basil; dried did just fine.

While my guests and I like spicy food, this was a bit over the top. I suggest reducing the Thai red curry base to 3/4s of tablespoon or less. The "heat" grew on us, but toning down the sauce would make it more flavorful. It's simple to prepare and elegant looking and the sea bass (with a touch more cooking) was buttery and wonderful.
