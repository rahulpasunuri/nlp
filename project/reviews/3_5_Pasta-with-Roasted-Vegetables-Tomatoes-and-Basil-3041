So I did not have all the required veg.for roasting but being the roasting Queen I mixed it up a bit. I add sliced parsnips, Broccoli and onions. Tossed in pre-cook green peas, chives and fresh parsley. umm fresh tomatoes and fresh garlic with the hot pasta, oil and vinegar. Still killer as per recipe.

Easy to make and pretty tasty. I roasted red pepper, squash, eggplant, mushroom, tomatoes, onion and garlic in the oven with olive oil, salt & pepper. I didn't have basil and I used only one tablespoon of balsamic. I skipped the parmesan cheese. It tasted better at room temperature. I enjoyed it very much. It is healthy and I will definitely make it again.

I have made this recipie several times, both for family and friends, and everyone agrees it is great. I substitute zuchinni for the butternut squash and usually use extra tomatoes. Very easy to make and highly recommend it. A great way to eat egglplant without frying it.

I prepared this with the addition of red onion and string beans. I skipped the fresh tomatoes and used sun dried in olive oil. I cut the garlic into slivers and roasted it with the veggies. I served this with grilled Italian sausages. Yummy! It makes a massive amount.

Delicious..an excellent combination of flavors and textures.

Loved this recipe! The only changes I made were grilling the vegetables on our outdoor grill. I didn't cut the vegetables as small, so they wouldn't fall through the grill, until after they were done. I also left the squash out, simply because I didn't have any - will try it next time. Friends and family loved this salad also!

I was a little skeptical, especially looking at the finished dish, because I find roasted vegetables and pasta a little unsatisfying. It tasted much better than I expected -- the flavor's all in the fresh tomatoes and the garlic. I blanched the garlic very briefly to cut a little of the bite, then used four cloves. Probably would have been even better with fresh basil.

Healthy, very tasty, and fairly quick to make. These are the slight changes I made... tossed the vegetables with the oil in a large bowl before putting them on the pan to roast... and I used a can of stewed tomatoes in place of the tomatoes and basil (I drained, then chopped and roasted them for a few minutes before adding them and the rest of the vegetables to the pasta)... I find they always add a nice flavor, but would also try the recipe as written at some point!

I haven't tried this recipe, but just noticed its on this site twice! Same name and ingredients but the other one appears to be 1-1/2 times this one (i.e. 3 red peppers, 1-1/2 lbs pasta, etc.) The credit is from Bon Appetit Outdoor Entertaining, April 2000. Different reviews - you might look at that one for additional comments and suggestions. Sounds worth making!!

Good hot weather dish -- very refreshing. It was perfect when it was done, but after sitting for a while (made 4-6 hours ahead of time) it lost some of it's flavor. Also, I used tri-color pasta -- added a bit of extra color and flavor. Serve when hot and ready...

This recipe was okay. It was kinda bland even after adding the onions and letting the tomatoes marinate in the vinegar. I think next time I would add a few more spices (other than salt and pepper) and herbs.

I read the previous readers tips and incorporated them into my own plan. I marinated the tomatoes as suggested and cooked the rest of the veggies on the barbie. After they were grilled to perfection I mixed them with the marinated tomatoes and put it all on a pizza crust,added parmesan & put it all into the oven. It was superb! I had to make some substitutions on the veggies, but it was a real hit at the table. Thanks!

A bit bland--but then again I couldn't get fresh basil or the butternut squash (substituted yellow squash.) Either one of those factors or the red onion suggestion probably would have made it quite tasty. I'll definitely try it again.

This is an excellent tasting recipe that is easy to prepare as is or with substitutions! I didn't have any squash so I added more peppers and red onion. We served this over tortellini for a truly satisfying dinner. For next time, I think I would also add mushrooms and follow the suggestion of marinating the tomatoes in the balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

I agree -- this is a terrific summer pasta dish. I followed the suggestions put forth by Joe of Austin -- adding a red onion, marinating the tomatoes, etc. In addition, I substituted zucchini for the butternut squash. I also increased the tomato-basil-vinegar portion of the recipe by 50 percent because this recipe makes a ton!

This is really a very good pasta dish and relatively easy to make. My family likes it very much. I made only 3 small changes to the basic recipe: 1)added to the vegetables one medium size red onion cut into large chunks; 2)raised the oven roasting temp from the prescribed 400 degrees to 450 degrees to help the vegetables char a bit; 3)mixed the cut fresh tomatoes, basil, garlic and balsamic vinegar early on and let set together awhile before mixing in with the pasta.
