My family raved about this bread. The only problem I have with the recipe is the bake time, which is way to long. It only took 35 minutes per loaf, and they could easily have taken a little less time. I think golden raisins would make a nice addition for the next time I make this recipe.

I almost killed my 95 year old Carpatho- Russian grandmother last year when I told her I baked this for an hour...it came out like a rock! An hour of baking was too long. I'm going to make this same recipe tomorrow and at twenty minutes into it I'm going to keep my eye on it.

I think every family of eastern european decent has a version of this bread (of course each thinks theirs is the best). Just for consideration, the tradition of using saffron originated a very long time ago, and was used to impart the desired yellow colour. If you do not have, or do not want to spend the money on saffron, it won't hurt one bit, but i would advise adding a few extra yolks to get the golden colour.

Made this bread again this year and it was just as delicious. Since the crust browns so quickly, I have two hints for a nicer crust: first, cover it with foil as soon as it starts to brown, and second, cover the loaves with a damp dish towel for 10 minutes as soon as they come out of the oven. We found out this year it makes great toast, too. This bread (in my Carpatho-Rusyn family) is called a babka. Since recipes vary by household, much less by region or country, let's agree that this bread can have different names but still be an Eastern European Easter bread. Enjoy!

Regardless of what it's called, it was very good for Easter breakfast - lovely smell to wake up to - and gone by mid-afternoon. I made a half recipe in my Panasonic bread machine on the Lite setting, with 1 scant tsp Saf-Instant yeast, and no braids, though I've thought of how next time to incorporate them too. It was a bit too big and too light - I had to pop it in the oven to finish - next time I'll use a 1/3 recipe and the Regular Bake setting. So, get out your rotten tomatoes over that apostasy.... If people can get this worked up over a bread recipe, the fulfillment of the promise of Easter is a long way off.

I absolutely love this bread, and I will be making it again this Easter. I have a passion for Russian recipes and look forward to sharing this particular recipe with friends.

To Cooks fom RSA regarding metric conversions: there is help on this very web site. Go to "Learn" (top of page)click "reference" then on the metric conversion link from there. There is a drop down menu on that page with options for conversion tables. It should help.

A note to the South African cooks: If you can find them where you are, there exist measuring cups, etc. that are marked in both U.S. and metric that are very helpful in these situations. If you can´t find one, and someone you know visits the US, Canada or Mexico, ask them to bring some back for you. Oven temps: 200C is roughly 400F, 180C is about 350F. A pound is a little less than half a kilo. But the best thing is to stick to recipes that don´t involve baking when there are conversions involved unless you are both mathematically inclined and fearless!

I'm from Hungary. I haven't mad this recipe yet, but it really sounds and looks like kalacs, a traditional Easter bread-type of thing. You can try "marbleizing" it by mixing cocoa powder with a portion of the dough, and gently stir it (with a knife or a brush) to create that marbly look.

To the cook from central PA: Here is a family recipe for Paska(pronounced puska) that may be similar to the one you lost: Scald 1 cup whole milk, add 1/3 cup butter or margarine, stir & cool to lukewarm. Add 1 small cake yeast, crumbled, 1/4 cup sugar, 1 tsp. salt, 3 large beaten eggs, and 1 cup flour. Use mixer to combine and disolve yeast. Cover and set aside until light and bubbly(45min). Put in large bowl, gradually add 3 cups flour to form soft dough that can be kneaded. Knead until blisters form in dough(10-15 min)-don't use a dough hook-and place in greased bowl, turning dough so all is greased. Cover & raise til doubled(2-3 hours). Punch dough down, knead lightly(add 1/2 pound re-hydrated and lightly floured golden raisins if desired)and place in 2 greased round 1-1/2 qt.GLASS pans. Let rise until dough is 1-2 inches above pan. Bake at 350 until mahogany brown, about 45 min. Brush crusts with melted margarine. Do NOT use metal pans! Loaf is OK, round is better.

Great Russian bread. Just like my mother's. I did use the Kitchen Aid to kneed, mine did not rise above the top and it was done at about 35 MINUTES cooking time. Taste better the next day. Could there be a typo in this recipe? Should it be 2 1 lb coffee cans instead of 2 2lb coffee cans? 2 lb cans are very large. That would explain why when I baked this on 2 occasions it did not rise above the can. Or does it only rise to the top when you are using a souffle dish? I don't care what you call this bread, it was a real treat.

Me and my husband are food lovers and amateur cooks from South Africa.However we live and work in the Middle East ... we discovered this website and it's great.... but sometimes we get stuck with the american "lbs, oz, fharenheit" instructions .... also no "active yeast" available here - only instant yeast... Anybody got some advice for us?

From one of Carpatho-Rusyn and Polish roots, I have to add that in our family, this bread is not what we call kulich; my older relatives call this a babka or a paska (not to be confused with the sweet cheese that some call pashka. Truly, it depends on the region of your roots!) In any event, it is an Easter bread and I made it for Easter. It is a traditional bread and it is delicious! We ate it with the sweet almond flavored cheese. I shaped mine into 2 loaves and topped them with a braid; baked each in a buttered 9X12 pan. It does brown too quickly so watch and cover with foil as needed. Also, 350 for one hour is too long; adjust baking times as previous poster suggested. I did not use the saffron and wonder if anyone who baked this bread did use it. None of my "family" recipes for traditional Eastern European breads (whatever you call them!) call for saffron and I wonder what region your family comes from if saffron is a traditional ingredient in your breads. Just curious!

I actually made it and ate it. It was very good, whatever it should be called. It rose and baked as directed.

I think all we can agree on is that there is a little variation in the terms that people use. My family is from the Ukraine, my husband is Russian and we all had different ideas of what babka, baba, paska and pashka were supposed to resemble. Our babas resembled cake in texture and the babka was brioche like. We also made the sweet cheese paska. No matter how much everyone argues, we will never come to an agreement and that is fine. I think that the most important thing about culture is to be proud of it. Pride can be manifested in respect for others. If people from Eastern Europe do not respect others, there is no way our respective cultures will get the respect that is due. I don't think it's worth insulting others over Easter bread. In fact, it's pretty ironic.

I actually made the bread.I gave one as a hostess gift for our Easter dinner and kept the other.It came out fantastic and tasted great too.I followed the recipe although I used my Kitchenaid to mix the dough.I used the coffee cans and the bread slid right out .Don't expect the dough to rise above the cans until after they are in the oven.I did cover the cans with a sheet of foil halfway through baking as the tops were browning quickly.Beautiful loaves and delicious,too.

The addition of saffron makes for a fragrant and more complex flavor. I added some raisins and cnadied fruit and drizzled a confectioner's sugar glaze over the top to give it a nice finish. I believe I'm the only one who reviewed the recipe. I, too, could add some irrelevant comments since I lived in Russian and know the cuisine, but I think most people read the reviews to find out if the recipe is worth making and what suggestions people have for enhancements. This is a great service and it would be nice if people could keep things in perspective. There are many opportunities to be contentious, but cooking shouldn't be one of them!

Being of Russian heritage myself - This recipe sounds/looks more like a babka NOT a kulich!! I would correct this error. Also, would recommend adding other dishes like a baked ham, Salad Olivier and Vinegrette (Radish salad) to take the place of dumplings!!! I've never seen dumplings at the Easter table.

To answer anonymous cook: No! To Seattle: The authenticity is overwhelming relevant, and your statement is insulting to the cultures involved. The description is heavy on would-be cultural "facts" about the bread. If the name of the bread and the cultural facts are erroneous, why trust the recipe. It offends people familiar with the tradition of the bread, and misinforms newcomers like myself. A wise baker often evaluates, and rejects, recipes without trying them.

Well, even Epicurious can pick a dud. One out of 15,000+ recipes is not bad.

I am from Russia, and for the not so long 21 years that I remember (I am 21) my family has been making Kulich, or Pasha as we call it. For the past 6 years I have been making it with my mother and the recipe we left almost unchanged except for adding raising in it. The dough is not like bread or cake or as one of you said challah, it is abit crumby and very moist, especially the first day. Sugar is the only thing that might be changed from time to time, depending on the family and of course the amount of eegs, the eggs can make the biggest difference of all. The more eggs you add the more yelllow the Kulich will be and tastier. I've had experience with putting too little of the egs and it does not taste the same!

This is NOT kulich. This is babka. Babka is brioche- or challah like. Kulich is denser, with more crumb and contains either raisins, candied fruit or almonds -- depending on your family tradition and geographic heritage. Kulich is a unique baked good -- not bread, not cake. NEVER braided or formed into shapes. It's always presented tall with an iced and decorated top. Babka, which is a Ukranian Easter tradition, is braided and Panetone like. Kulich is very tough to describe and variations on recipes are much debated over the lenten season ending in feverish competitive bake offs between Russian families. Recipes are guarded, cherished and passed on from generation to generation like a prized heirloom. For a better recipe, unearth the Time Life series of cookbooks on cultural cooking from the 70s, and the Russian one has a pretty good version along with accurate photos. Not like this one.

Actually, we call this Babka and some of the ladies at the church decorate the tops of the breads with icing and candies while others do braids and crosses with dough. I think it depends on what part of eastern Europe your family is from originally. We're more Ukranian.

To cut this type of bread cut off top (often decorated) and cut into "rounds" across the loaf instead of top to bottom to eliminate the "problem cutting" described in previous message.

Rating: 1
Kulich is commonly made in this formerly Russian town and this recipe does not reflect what we know and do. We would use white raisins in the batter and sometimes candied fruit. Most importantly, the bread rises out of the coffee can and makes a knob on the top. This top is carefully frosted and decorated with little eggs, jelly beans and the like. Rose water is sometimes used for flavoring as is cardamom and orange rind. Slicing it is always a problem.
