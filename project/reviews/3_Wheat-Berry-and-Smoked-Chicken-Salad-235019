This is a good basic recipe. My substitution was cashew nuts instead of hazelnuts. I used jarred roasted peppers also. It was a fairly quick, once the wheat was cooked, easy, yummy meal. By the way, I used left over beer can chicken for the recipe.

Tasty, healthy, and easy--except for roasting and peeling the peppers, which is my least favorite kitchen chore. Next time, I'll just use bottled peppers. Like the previous reviewer, I couldn't find smoked chicken either so I just brushed chicken breasts with a little liquid smoke and baked them.

they should have 3.5 forks. this was very good and extremely healthy. though i live in the grocery shoppers' paradise of l.a. - no stores had smoked chicken. so i bought a little liquid smoke and grilled myself. worked out fine and was probably a lot healthier. only other changes i made were: I put in a few garlic/cheese croutons, a few shavings of premium parmesean, and a few sprinkles of yummy red sea salt from hawaii. i'll make again. it was pretty easy as well. great for summer.
