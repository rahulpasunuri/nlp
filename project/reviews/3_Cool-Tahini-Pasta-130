Simple to make. I like to serve it with julienned fresh cucumber. One comment: it's not quite sesame-y enough for my taste, so I add half again as much tahini and a teaspoon of sesame oil. I also add a bit of dried asian peppers occasionally, when I'm feeling spicy.

Mark Bittman "How to Cook Everything" has a similar, but better recipe. I thought this had too much vinegar relative to tahini. I used udon noodles which worked very well. I would decrease or eliminate the water -- sauce was too runny.

I added left over cold chicken and romaine lettuce. Made a great summer supper.

Not my thing - too much like other "peanut" inspired pasta dishes. There are similar, yet better and more interesting, ones to be found.

Worth trying, definitely.

This is one of my favorite summertime dishes. Its easy to make and really flavorful. Everytime I have it, I wonder why I don't make it more often.
