I chose this recipe because I wanted a classic coleslaw. I wasn't sure the folks I was cooking for would want "nouvelle" slaw. I doubled the recipe, dealt with the large quantities, cabbage flying all over the kitchen... The end result tasted just like store bought! Now, there are two ways of looking at that. This recipe produces a coleslaw as good as you get at a deli. But I could have just gone to a deli.

The sour cream was the fix I needed for my usual recipe. The method of letting sit & tossing was an improvement too. This lets the cabbage soften up a bit, which is a good thing for us. From my recipe,I added a squirt of ketchup and a dash or 2 of Worcestershire to the dressing; taste & adjust til delicious. Also, we prefer Napa cabbage. Worked fabulously with a pulled pork BBQ sandwich.

Really good basic coleslaw. I added some horseradish, and listened to the other reviewers so doubled the recipe. I also cut down the amount of cider vinegar by 1/4.

This is a delicious classic coleslaw. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and doubled the dressing which ended up being just a bit too much, so I just added a little more cabbage and an extra carrot, and it came out just right. I also added a little extra sugar and some sesame seeds. I received so many compliments, and will definitely make it again.

I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw..especially creamy coleslaw that calls for mayonaise but I must say that this recipe was very good. I would encourage you to double the sauce (or half the cabbage) as other reviewers suggested. Maybe a tad more sugar, or to taste. Minor adjustments can be made but this is a great simple recipe. Definitely better the longer it has a chance to marinate.

My first time making cole slaw. I read the reviews first and took everyones opinion into consideration for my recipe. I like pepper so i doubled the amount, went with half a Tbl less vinegar, grated my carrots and double the sauce ingredients. turned out awsome!

There's too much vinegar for my liking!

Made this for broham sandwiches using the BBQ tri-tip and caramelized onion recipe from Epicurious.com. Also made Root Beer Baked Beans and BBQ corn on the cob to round out the menu. The coleslaw is perfect for adding to sandwiches as it is dressing heavy. The only addition to the coleslaw was to add celery seed to taste and more salt & pepper.

Pretty good basic recipe, but I changed a few things to take it up a notch. First, I doubled the dressing, then I used half plain yogurt. I added a bit more sugar, added a bulb of fennel and finally added some celery seed, probably a rounded teaspoon. Oh right, zest from a lemon and juice from half of it. Really good...

Great recipe but make sure you either halve the cabbage or double the dressing!

This recipe is the classic coleslaw! I made a few small changes: I always use 2% fat fage greek yogurt instead of sour cream (it tastes almost the same), and I halved the pepper as I'm not the biggest fan of black pepper. I also used only one bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix (about a pound's worth, I think). The flavor of the coleslaw is amazing. Mine was a little dressing heavy, but that makes sense because I should have had about twice as many veggies as I did. Anyway, I highly recommend this recipe. Everyone loved it and it's definitely my new standby!

This is a really simple, basic recipe for 'slaw that went really well with the ribs, beans and potato salad also on the evening's menu. I don't like sweet slaw and there was plenty of sugar in the other dishes so I went just a little lighter on that ingredient. Next time I make this I will add a little horseradish since I like a little heat in this type of dish. Or, I might add apple and or raisins if sweeter works better with a different menu.

This is a good recipe for a dressing base. If you are looking to zip things up a bit, instead of an onion, try grating in some fresh horseradish (I added about 1/4 cup). Fresh is key, as the stuff in a jar comes with all kinds of additives that you don't need. It now reminds me of slaw from my favorite local deli, amazing!

I really liked this! I doubled both the vinegar and pepper, added a dash of Trappey's as well as celery seeds. I was wary of adding onions, but since I had the mandoline out anyway I grated some red onion and added it to the dressing before mixing so it would be more evenly distributed. I added half a julienned apple instead of doubling the sugar. Delicious!

When I made this recipe, I used red cabbage and added ginger as well. I thought that adding sliced apple would also be a good addition.

To this recipe I added celery seed and a bit more sugar. It was hugely disappointing, actually embarrassing; we'd brought it to a picnic to share.

Good, basic recipe that is quick to make and beats store-purchased cole slaw in quality and price. I used Greek yogurt in place of sour cream. I omitted the sugar.

Easy & Delicious Coleslaw Recipe! Tastes just like restaurant style slaw. I used a pre-prepped bag of slaw mix and reduced the amount of mayo. I added equal parts mayo and sour cream (about a 1/3 c. each) and swapped them for the light versions instead of the full-fat varieties. I also added an extra teaspoon of sugar while I was waiting for the slaw to wilt. This was excellent on top of pulled pork sandwiches! Yum Yum!

There just isn't enough sauce to make this a "Creamy Coleslaw" but try this it works. Triple the sauce ingredients except the salt & pepper. You can s & p to your taste. Use Greek yogurt instead of sour cream & use a low fat mayo.(Using the yogurt & low fat mayo reduces the caloric intake.) Don't forget the celery seeds, a must in coleslaw. Keep the cabbage & carrot amounts the same as in the original recipe but cut the cabbage up a little smaller. Now you have a nice tasty creamy coleslaw. (Use half red & half green cabbage, it makes it a little more colorful.)

Quite Bland as is; needs some kick; next time I will increase the vinegar

This is also a perfect dressing for potato salad. Make a big batch and keep on hand. Lasts for a couple of weeks.

This is almost the same recipe I have been making for years. Only difference is I don't use sour cream, but a little half & half. Also add some yellow mustard and celery seeds. It is an old southern recipe. In fact, just made some for "slaw dogs" tonight.

You can add shredded apples and it will gain a lot.

I love this recipe. It is simple and sublime. My only addition is some onion and maybe some celery salt. Depending on my taste at the time, I might not use all of the dressing.

I found bok choi superior to ordinary green cabbage in a slaw recipe. It's much more tender and sweeter too. Try adding thinly sliced almonds and using a champagne vinegar, cutting back on the sugar a wee bit.

omitting the sugar and adding some celery seeds might pep it up a bit.

This was nothing special. I used a great head of cabbage from the farmer's market but was underwhelmed by the bland dressing.

OMG!!! This was just the best coleslaw that I have ever made. It got rave reviews at the funtion that I made it for. The sour cream really added a nice zip.
