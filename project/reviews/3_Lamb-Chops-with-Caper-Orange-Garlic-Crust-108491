Absolutely delicious! I will be using this recipe again and will also try on other meats. Great, unusual combination of flavors. Big hit with the family - even my 20 month old loved it.

This was easy and delicious. The chops were tender, and the flavor combination provided by the crust was surprisingly compatible with the taste of the meat and of the red zinfandel that we had with it. A keeper.

This was strictly OK, not good enough to make again. I think the lamb would be improved by marinading for a few hours first. Also - the caper/orange coating will burn if the heat is too high so it's really important to keep the heat at medium. And, I tried to be super careful (after reading reviews) to keep the coating on the chops, but to no avail. It basically becomes something you sprinkle over the lamb when serving, it won't stay on while cooking.

We loved this recipe - my first shot at cooking lamb. I put the crust on both sides of the chops and finished them in the oven. Also, I deglazed the pan and made a nice sauce. We served it with dinasour greens and mushrooms, all over brown rice. It made for a great meal.

Uneventful meal. Caper/organge didnt add a lot to the overall flavor. It was less of a crust and more of a saute as it all falls off. I would not make it again.

i have to agree with the previous cook, the capers and orange zest did not add anything to the chops. they still tasted good, but it was just the salt, pepper, and garlic.

The capers and orange zest were incongruous and unappealing. I scraped them off my chop and would not use again. My guests were polite, but described the topping as "OK".

Excellent. Delicious. Would definitely make again. Will try the crust on others meats. Best lamb I've ever had.

I used thin-cut high quality pork chops- more affordable, and really tasty. Tastes like it was marinated. Dinner came together in less than 10 minutes.

Liked it quite a bit, had some trouble with the crust on the chops burning. Still would make it again.

I pounced on this recipe tonight (despite a lot of reservations at the combination of ingredients) as I had everything in the pantry and wanted something new and a little different for my lambchops. I tasted the topping prior to cooking, and was pretty skeptical. Despite my skepticism, it was absolutely delicious on the lamb when cooked. I made a pan sauce by deglazing the pan with Marsala, which was pretty scrumptious over this. The orange flavor came through loud and clear. We had a nice Syrah with this-great wine, but not the best pairing with the orange flavor.

This dish was fantastic! When placed in the pan-seasoned side down, the orange zest penetrates the meat. The citrus, capers and garlic work well together and compliment the lamb nicely! In only 20 minutes, a perfect week-night meal! I served this with steamed asparagus with a Saffron Aioli, (also found on www.gourmet.com) and a nice salad w/ a Balsamic Vinaigrette!

The lamb tasted great. It was a little greasy so watch the amount of oil you put in the pan initially.

I had to review this since it was so low-rated! My fiance made it and it was absolutely delicious. I'm not even a big lamb fan, but really enjoyed this preparation as well as the novel idea of a caper crust. May try with salmon tonight.

This was a good recipe and I served it to friends, all of whom loved it. However, the portions are really small (take this into account) and I might pick a more creative style next time - a little tired of the caper/citrus combination, although my guests weren't. I served it with the beet, carmelized onion, feta salad and it was a great combo.

I was a bit concerned that this unusual combination wouldn't work very well, but it was terrific. I served it with "couscous timbales with pistachios, scallions and currents" and asparagus with "maltaise" sauce. My husband told me that although I have made a lot of good meals in our 25 years together, this was one of the best. My only criticism of the lamb recipe is that the cooking times are way too long, at least if you use meat that has been brought close to room temperature before cooking.
