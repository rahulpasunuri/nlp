I also followed this recipe exactly, and found both the flavor and the consistency to be vile. For me, pureed soups can't be mild -- they have to have a depth of flavor that is interesting enough to overcome the lack of interesting bite. Sadly, this soup was flavorless, so tasted like warm paste.

I have wasted time reading reviews from cooks who didn't puree the soup, didn't use lemon juice or cream and didn't use chicken stock (WHAT was it that they cooked???). So here's a review from someone who actually followed the recipe. The soup turned out thick, creamy and delicious. The tarragon was subtle but clearly discernible. The leeks were soft and sweet from being caramelized first and then cooked in the soup. Frankly, this recipe seemed too easy to be good, yet the soup turned out quite delicious. No sieving necessary. I don't think it needs any changes.

great winter soup. three changes I did. 1/ cook some back bacon in water for stock and after all the beans/leeks are pureed, add the shredded pork. 2/ reduce the cream to half. 3/ when cooking the leeks, let them caramelize a bit and deglaze the pan with some white wine instead of using the lemon juice.

good and tasty. two changes... 1/ prepare some stock from cooking some back bacon for the liquid. 2/ reduce the halfNhalf to half what's called for. Food processor works great, but agree with other comments, let the leeks caramelize a bit to get that rich sweet taste.

This was a good hearty winter meal in itself. I didn't strain the beans, and it was certainly more 'rustic' for it. I did gently sweat the leeks before uncovering them to brown them, and they didn't quite take over the dish as others have said, but they were certainly prominent. I also felt that the cream could have been reduced or left out without too much being lost if you wanted to cut down on some fat/calories.

Excellent! I love this soup and have told many of my friends about it. But, you really do have to follow the recipe for it to turn out tasty!

I was surprised how good this is, considering how simple the recipe is. I omitted the tarragon but otherwise made as is with excellent results.

I was not impressed with this soup. I think I should have let the leek carmalize, or something because my creamy, mellow soup was interupted by mouthfuls of stringy, crunchiness! I liked it much better after I fished all the leek out of my bowl.

I love this soup and have made it several times; every time, someone asks for the recipes. I don't strain it; the food processor yields a thick, satisfying soup. The bean cans in my markets are 15 ounces and the amount is just fine.

Made it with real, home-cooked white beans (I hate canned beans), cutting the recipe in half. Pureed it but didn't put it through sieve. Used evap as I didn't have cream. Was too much liquid, too thin. Don't know how much better it would be following the recipe exactly. I threw the recipe away.

I have made many soups with white beans and this one has to be my least favorite.

I followed the recipe for this soup pretty much as given except that I didn't bother to strain it. It was good but not great, although my husband really enjoyed it. It was better the next day.

Easy and delicious. Was a big hit at last nights dinner party. Besides a drizzle of truffle oil, I deep fried some chopped leaks and put just a teaspoon in the center of the soup when serving. Yum! I will make this over and over.

This soup was very easy and so delicious! My husband told me that I was "brilliant" upon tasting it...and I absolutely took the credit!

All my guests loved this soup. It is an incredibly easy dish to prepare and makes a wonderful first dish presentation. I too always add the truffle oil at the end and do not sieve the beans - the blender purees them well enough. Also, I don't happen to like tarragon so I use herbes de provence instead. Delicious. I will make this again and again.

easy, easy, easy!!! and very yummy... you must puree the beans!!! this is a lovely soup....very much like the white bean soups i enjoyed while living in France. i like to spinkle swiss cheese on top just before serving....gives it a gooey, by the fire texture. i make this all the time!! simmer the chicken broth with some chopped leeks for half an hour first...just for more flavor. also...this is a perect first course for a lamb dinner. mmmmmmmm......so good.

I did not puree this soup since I like bean soup with the beans whole. Perhaps that was a mistake because I felt the creamy broth was a bit watery and the beans were not cooked enough. The leeks really took over the soup.

I'm new to making soups and thought this one was fabulous. I followed the instructions to the letter and was very impressed at how easy and quick it was to make. My family loved it!

I know I am in the minority here, but I really did not like this soup. My husband thought it was ok, but wasn't wild about it either. I kept wishing I had made cream of mushroom the whole time I was eating it! I am sure that I have had bean soup before and liked it. I thought it was boring even though I was liberal with the garlic! Usually, I like things that others have really liked, but not this time.

This soup is delicious. It can definitely be a meal if served with a salad. I drizzled with truffle oil too (I didn't know which kind so I used dark). Yummy. And tossed in some garlic croutons. I thought the leeks were too big for it to be creamy soup so I put it all back in the blender for a minute and reheated, then it was real SMOOTH.

very good and easy. use more tarragon and hot pepper to taste. i didn't puree it - it's good as it is - and i forgot to add the lemon and cream but those don't seem necessary. i made a variation days later with lentils since that's all i had - wasn't bad but white beans are better with tarragon. i also use veg cubes instead of chicken broth.

I make this all the time, now... We absolutely love it. The consistency and flavor can't be beat. The truffle-oil garnish is an excellent idea!

My advice: Use more tarragon, about 1 ts or so. I cooked the beans from scratch (about 1 lb, some veggie broth & bay leaf).

A great winter soup. Serve this with a mixed salad and hot crusty bread for a delicious filling meal.

Yummy! I prepared the soup exactly how the recipe indicates, except I topped with truffle oil. So goooooood!

I doubled the garlic in this recipe to add a more intense flavor, as beans can be quite bland. As well I served the soup with chopped fresh parsley and parmesan cheese, along with garlic croutons. It was extremely delicious and could be made with few ingredients on hand

I love this soup. I only put two cans of beans and did not puree them. My husband really enjoyed it.

This soup is quite easy to make, tasty, and also very elegant. However, I found the consistency too thick so added extra cream and milk.

Good if you have the ingredients on hand like I did and only made one third recipe for a quick lunch. I liked it. And, I also did not seive the bean mixture.
