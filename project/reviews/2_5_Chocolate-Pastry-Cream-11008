This recipe is excellant if mixed with heavy cream the way the chocolate praline croquembouche recipe meabs it to be. I've made it for years and never had a problem.

If you wait to add the sugar, cornstarch, cocoa powder, and salt to the eggs until the milk comes to simmer, the cream won't be thick. Pour a little hot milk into the egg mixture while adding the dry ingredients then add the entire egg mixture to the milk and stir til it thickens.

In itself, this pastry cream is too thick and practically useless. However, when folded into heavy cream such as in the recipe for Chocolate Praline Croquembouche it is sublime! I've used it several times and with excellent results.

This was too dense and heavy. Not a good recipe AT ALL!! The cornstarch didn't have an option but to clot!! I made this recipe to fill mini-eclairs and I had to remake another recipe.. I used Richard Sax's recipe for Double Chocolate Pudding out of his Classic Home Desserts cookbook and it was a winner and a keeper. It is the same idea of the one I made that was a disaster, but uses different quantities of liquids and starch. The result was professional and delicious. This cookbook is my bible for desserts, I should have trusted it in the first place!

how do you expect to cook the flour if you do not cook it

Yech! Bitter. Burned extremely easily. I would just bring it to a boil - not boil it for a minute.
