I halved the recipe, and it made enough for 6 first-course servings - it's a big salad! I subbed pecans for the hazelnuts, and at the advice of another reviewer, added some shaved parmesan (I TOTALLY recommend this). It was divine. I love the contrast and balance in flavours. This is a great salad - looks snazzy and tastes great. I think I would add the cauliflower warm next time though, as I didn't love it at room temp.

One more thing to add from my previous review..I did not use any romaine lettuce and can't see how it would enhance this in any way. Just go with the arugula and you will be genius and loved.

I made a lot of subtle changes, but kept the essence of this salad, and I love it. I roasted one head of cauliflower, used 2 heads of thinly sliced radiccho and used about 2 cups of arugula instead of parsley. I didn't have shallot, so I used very thinly sliced sweet onion and used white balsamic vinegar instead of white vinegar. This was an important change, as the sweetness of this white balsamic was fantastic with the peppery arugula and bitter radicchio. I didn't use any nuts..instead I tossed the salad with the cauliflower and added fresh shaved parmesan. It was delicious, and very beautiful with the white, green, ruby red and the flavors were epic. Will def serve this with Christmas dinner as it is so beautiful and the veggie eaters in the crowd will LOVE it.

What a great flavor combination! I also had a bit of arugula and added that also, and served alongside salmon. Everyone loved it.

This is a fabulous recipe. Family really liked it. The toasted hazelnuts work really well with the roasted and somewhat caramelized cauliflower. I used only one head of romaine so as to not imbalance the dish (IMO). Otherwise, it was great as is.

This was really good. The second time I made it I substituted roasted pecans for hazelnuts and it was a lot better.

Love it - combination works really well, though I found the proportions had too much lettuce and not enough cauliflower. Agree with the 2 heads of cauliflower and will use less romaine next time.

This is a wonderful salad. I made it for a dinner party and my guests loved it, and even asked for the recipe. I also used wild arugula on place of parsley. Other than that, I followed the recipe.

This salad was a big hit with my dinner party. I also want to mention that the leftovers were really good the next day with feta cheese on top. It went really well with the other flavors.

This is a delicious salad. I LOVE the roasted cauliflower so much, it's hard to not snack on it before it gets added to the salad. This has become a Thanksgiving staple in our family.

Delicious interesting salad. I did not dress the cauliflower separately first, as the recipe suggests. I added all salad ingredients together, except the nuts, and then added the dressing right before serving. And then tossed in the hazelnuts. The dressing was nice and light. Loved this.

I just made this for a party and it was quite a hit. I substituted arugula for the romaine, used two heads of cauliflower, and kept the dressing amount the same (I used two shallots) b/c I like my salads lightly dressed. It was nice to make a salad that was different than anything I normally make. The roasted cauliflower has such amazing flavor. I plan to try more recipes using it.

Absolutely wonderful. I would have two heads of cauliflower on hand...it's rare to yield nine cups of florets from one head, and you DEFINITELY want the full cauliflower amount....because it's delicious!!!!!!!! The only item with no leftovers for thanksgiving.

Absolutely delicious. I skipped the parsley and used a large bunch of arugula instead of the radicchio. YUM!

Fantastic! Will certainly be making this one again, particularly as I like cauliflower but never really knew what more I could do with it. The roasting gives it a nutty flavour which I hadn't expected. Highly recommend. Oh, you can leav out the romaine all together and simple add more parley - 1 large bunch - instead. Gives an added freshness.

Delicious. The hazelnuts and roasted cauliflower play off each other beautifully. I doubled the dressing. This was enough salad for about 20.

Delicious, but the quantities were off: it was enough for 20 people, though it ended up light on dressing. I'd cut back on the amount of romaine, radicchio and parsley by half, keep all else the same.

Wonderful. Next time I'll use less radicchio - but I'll definitely do this one again.
