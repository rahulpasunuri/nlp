Absolutely delicious!!! Great alternative to making a whole turkey. We've had this for several ocassions (Easter, Thanksgiving, bday party). I love that it doesn't require the oven and leftovers keep very well in the refrigerator.

Delisioso! This was easy to prepare. Left out the raisins but otherwise prepared as directed. Loved the escarole. I could not bear to discard the leftover stuffing from the strained sauce -- it was deliecious. The cooking time is really 35 minutes -- turn it over after 17 min!

I've been making this recipe at least once a year since I first saw it in Gourmet in 1995. It's fantastic, nearly failure proof, easy yet elegant, and sure to please. Just finished it now, actually, for Easter dinner!

This recipe was not only easy but it was impressive looking and tasting! I used spinach instead of escarole and loved the pine nuts in the recipe. My husband even commented on the special meal and was surprised to hear that it was easy to make. I will definitely make this again and think it worthy of company.

I belong to a gourmet group and made it when I was hostess. I doubled the recipe and made extra escarole filling and served the stuffd turkey on top of the extra filling. I cut the rolls on a slant. I received rave reviews.

Excellent - I used the spinach as recommended by others as it was what I had on hand, substituted shallots for onions for elegant touch. This recipe was fairly easy considering the delicious and elegant result. Recommend omitting seasoning rolled turkey breast with salt, prosciutto added enough.

I prepared this dish for a special occasion, having previously enjoyed great success with new recipes from this site. I substituted spinach as other reviewers suggested, but found the whole thing a little bland, and missing something I can't quite determine. If I try it again, I will use a different cut of meat - the turkey breast I used didn't pound well, didn't roll well, and unfortunately the whole thing required far more effort than the end product was worth.

I came back after many years to copy this recipe, or at least modify it for Christmas! It was amazing the first time, and 10 years later, I suspect will be again.

I love this recipe, but I usually substitute one package of frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry, for the escarole - I prefer the flavor and texture.

This is the 2nd time I have made this dish in 5 years for another buffet. I purchased a whole boneless turkey and made 4 rolls. I roasted the rolls in the wine and broth..My house had a beautiful aroma thru it. I will have rave reviews again

I made this without the filling, simply using the braising technique for turkey breast. It came out so moist and delicious that this will become a regular in my home, where we like to eat lean meats regularly.

This was served as part of a buffet and the guests raved about it. I would definitely make it again.

This dish turned out to be decent - but I would recommend making some pretty big changes to it before trying it again. Maybe adding an entirely new ingredient, or taking one away. It just needs something new to make it better.

I really loved this and so did my party guests. I couldn't find escarole so I substituted witloof. It was a wonderful addition to a buffet on a warm Christmas Day.

I don't care for escarole so I made it with spinach and roasted the turkey instead of the braising. Guests were impressed and I'm making it a second time.

This recipe is not so great. I really expected a better product. After so much work! I don't recommend.
