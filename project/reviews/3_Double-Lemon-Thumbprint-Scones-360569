I think these would have been delicious, except for my major error in using all-purpose flour instead of self rising. Who has self-rising??? I realize that the reason they use self-rising is because the title of the section it appeared in is "5 ingredient recipes." Would have been better if they had a note in the recipe with the very simple substitution for self-rising flour. Will try again and be more on my toes!!

Excellent. You have to appreciate a recipe so simple with such a delicious payoff. These were light and fluffy with a delicious lemon/sugar crust on the outside. I went with raspberry jam and it was perfection. These scones really puff up when they cook so give them lots of room on the baking sheet. I found that they did need a bit more flour added when I was rolling them out. I made sure to use more of the self-rising flour for this. This was my first time working with self- rising flour and what a pleasant surprise. Try these with a latte next saturday morning. You will start the weekend right.

Good but not as good as other scone recipes on this site.

These are delightful tasting: the exterior is really lemony with some crunch, and the interior is lighter than most scones...which I happen to like. To be a little picky (and why I didn't give it 4 forks)...the yield was not stated in the magazine, but did appear online. Also, these are BIG cookies. I would think guests would like something more manageable, say a 1 1/2-2 inch cookie rather than 2 1/2+. Third, I would always recommend adding the word "divided" when an ingredient is used in two different places in a recipe. Lastly, I would counsel to use two large baking sheets so the cookies don't run together. That just lets you have more surfaces to get that beautiful lemony crunch! And that crunch does soften after 4 hours, so eat them up by then or reheat the next day as suggested wrapped in foil.
