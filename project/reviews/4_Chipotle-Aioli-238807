Very very good. I used canned adobe chilis as well, and it made for a great flavor.

Perfect condiment for grilled burgers!

Ridiculously easy to make. I would add a little more chile powder next time. I also used half mayo and half greek yogurt to cut down on calories and fat.

Takes about 2 seconds to make and tastes fantastic!, i would actually recommend throwing in a pinch of curry powder too.

Made this tonight for a cookout with some friends and it was a hit... it ended up on the burgers AND the potato chips. I did as other reviewers suggested and used the juice of a whole lime and multiple chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. VERY delicious!

Perfect! Not super spicy either. I'm using this aioli to make B.L.A.'s (bacon, lettuce, avocado) tomorrow.

One word: Duh. More words, this is the easiest way to add some flavor to any dish. Try it on sandwiches, crab cakes, latkes, appetizers of any kind, just too easy and too awesome not to try.

This is absolutely delicious. I serve this with chicken and shrimp marinated in lemon juice, olive oil and garlic. I also use more lime juice than the recipe calls for.

Awesome, easy, tasty! I make this with a vegan mayo and it is fast and delicious every time!

Also, I used the juice from one small lime... so way more than this recipe calls for! :)

I made this chipotle aioli to top crab cakes. It was delicious!! I used Cholula Chipotle Sauce, and I probably used more like 3 Tablespoons. The hubby and I like spicy foods and this came out to be just the right topping for the crab cakes.

This is amazing on toasted sandwiches. After reading the reviews, I'll be trying it on tacos and tuna steaks next. I made mine with Chipotle Tabasco sauce and it was excellent.

A wonderful and versatile dressing/sauce that can be modified in any number of ways for a variety of purposes. Last night I made it using half mayo and half plain yogurt to which I added the following: 1 T minced fresh tarragon, 1/4 cup finely diced mango, 1/2 pureed mango. I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and used canned chipotle in adobo sauce. My family loved this on grilled shrimp and asparagus. This will be a regular part of the repertoire around here and I plan to make it with other additions as well...some ideas: peaches, mint, molasses, kalamata olives, cilantro, parsley, tomatoes (sundried or fresh), asiago, roasted corn...not all at once, of course, but I'll be trying all of them.

This is the type of sauce that elevates everything it touches. I made a pretty simple meal of marinated grilled chicken, waffle fries and salad with some garlic bread tonight and people were literally drizzing this on everything (including salad)! Delicious, simple, perfect. I used Tabasco Chiotle sauce (about 2 teaspoons) and it was just perfect. This is my new go-to recipe for grilled anything. Try it, you'll LOVE it!

really good, really easy. Subbed in a little yogurt for the mayo. Great on grilled chicken.

Love this aioli recipe. Makes my fish tacos taste just like the ones at my very popular local tacquria

I made this with grilled tuna sandwiches and it was outstanding. Grilled the tuna to medium rare, toasted the buns and added arugula. A totally scrumptious meal. This sauce can go with anything.

This aioli was outstanding! Be sure to use any leftovers as a substitute for plain mayo on sandwiches (especially tuna)!

For a much more intense, spicer/smokier flavor, use canned chipotle pepper (in adobo sauce). Just mince one pepper (or more if you're brave) instead of using the powdered or chipotle hot sauce. Also, I second Phyl124's suggestion for fat-free mayo. With all the flavor from the chipotle, you won't miss the fat (and neither will your heart).

I tried with regular and fat-free mayo. Did not notice a difference.l It looking to cut on calories give it a try
