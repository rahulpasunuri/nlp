My husband made this last night for me and it was delicious, different, satisfying and easy to make. We used chicken sausages: spinach and garlic / italian mozzarella. We used panko instead of making bread crumbs to save a step and it seemed like a great substitution to us. The sauce was good ... overall delicious, quick and super satisfying!

I was sooo ready for something different and this was sooo good! Made just as written and used chicken and apple smoked sausage and smoked Italian.Next time I'll use just the chick and apple. I cut them into slices on the diagonal so they got nicely browned. Also double the vinagrette. My Cuban hubby had seconds!

This is a great alternative to sausage, potatoes, and sauerkraut...a winter staple in our house. This recipe isn't heavy, it's fresh and light tasting.

This was easy to make and really really delicious. I'd never had savoy cabbage before but wanted to make it because I saw it in the grocery and it was so pretty. I loved the way it tasted and was perfect with the breadcrumbs and the dressing. So good!

this was great. made it with vegetarian sausage, would have been even better with real meat. vinaigrette worked really well and the fresh tarragon was delicious. have already made this again.
