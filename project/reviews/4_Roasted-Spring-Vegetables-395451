Painfully easy and, when made with vegetables fresh from the farmer or garden, just outstanding. Cutting the vegetables to similar size for even roasting and not crowding the sheet are the keys, but some vegetables cook more quickly, like tomatoes -- don't be afraid to throw the smaller or quicker-cooking vegetables in part way through the roasting. Serve on a bed of tasty raw vegetable tops like carrottops for an easy, attractive presentation.
