Wow, wow, WOW! My mother-in-law made these cookies this Christmas, and they are the BEST cookie I have ever had. I definitely plan to make these at home on special occasions.

We made these as part of our christmas baking. Used the high-fat cocoa powder from Penzey's. They were the higlight of the cookie platters!

I agree with a previous reviewer... outstanding Oreo substitute. I've filled them with a yummy vanilla french buttercream, with a traditional american peanut butter buttercream and today with salted caramel buttercream with a salted caramel center. Delightful!

These were okay, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that this just wasn't worth the effort. I think they might have been better if I rolled the cookies thinner. BUT, the white chocolate ganache was phenomenal, and I'm not generally a fan of white chocolate. Used it with other cookie recipes that turned out much better.

Good chocolatey taste, but could have a little more oomph. I loved the white chocolate ganache! It stayed a little too gooey, but it tasted great! I made a dark chocolate ganache and peanut butter filling for half of them and that combination tasted even better!

Big hit with my cookie exchange group - they were disappointed when I didn't bring them this year. Try adding peppermint to the filling, then coating the sandwich in chocolate. YUM

Yummy, but a lot of work! I used heart shape forms and red sugar sprinkles. The dough does need to be warmer than the instructions note to be workable. Very tasty. Only worth the effort as an xmas cookie. Still though, I give it 3.5 forks.

You have to accept that these cookies are a labor of love and not for the feint of heart. That being said they are fantastic. I really took my time with these and found, like hungrylizzy that working with the dough while soft then freezing them worked well for me. Don't try to make these when you are pressed for time, but they are soooooo worth the effort. I made them for a cookie exchange last year and people are still talking about them. I am not the greatest baker, but these cookies definately made it look like I am. Will make them again this year for sure.

Awesome, Cookie Recipe for entertaining. The trick to make easier is to make sure you freeze the dough long enough;)

I have made this recipe a couple of times now, once for Christmas, and once today for Valentine's Day. In both cases the cookies turned out wonderful. People at Christmas were literally hiding them to take home, and today I brought them into the office and have been getting all kinds of great comments. They are definitely worth the effort, but much easier if you split it up and make the dough and gnache the night before.

Who needs OREOS? These are the adult version of those cookies and they are fantastic! Try this recipe if you want a piece of your childhood in an adult form!

These are absolutely delicious but caused me so much pain to make. I won't attempt them again until I have proper resources. I live in a tiny flat with a tiny kitchen, along with a tiny oven, fridge and freezer. This made the many steps involved that much more difficult (for example I couldn't freeze or bake more than 1/3 of the batch at a time). In the UK I've had a tough time finding corn syrup, so I substituted with Lyle's Golden Syrup. That plus Green & Black's super vanilla bean white chocolate made the ganache golden and divine...though very thick! I lost patience in the end and tried to whip it up before it had come to room temperature and it was so thick it broke my hand mixer! Still they've come together as a gorgeous cookie that everyone is raving about.

Working with the dough was a bit anxiety-inducing, but with patience it will absolutely come together in the end. The cookies are absolutely delicious - very rich.

i thought these cookies were wonderful, even if they are a little time consuming. i also thought they held up nicely for a couple of days afterwards. they're pretty delicate while you're assembling them, but once you get them together, it's a different story. the ganache is fabulous, and the crunch and salt in the cookie really brings out the creaminess of the ganache. i wouldn't even consider making these again though if i didn't have a stand mixer, plenty of parchment paper, good non-sticky cookie sheets and a paper thin spatula. the first batch i made was on an older cookie sheet, and i tried to get the cookies off a little after the 5 minutes suggested with a regular spatula, and half the cookies turned into a crumbly mess - i nearly cried after all that work. the second batch was on a newer cookie sheet, with a nice thin spatula at the 4 minute mark, and they literally popped right off - they were beautiful.

I'm not sure why it bugs me so much when people declare an amazing recipe 'not worth the time', but it does. These cookies are most absolutely worth the time. They are wonderful. My only advice is take the dough out of the fridge 30 minutes before you want to work with it. I'd also chill the ganache before it's final beating.

Loved these cookies. Very simple - just takes a little time to keep dough cold, and the ganache made them outstanding.

I am not sure if these cookies are worth the time investemnt. I did find them very difficult to roll out after refrigerating the dough, so I had to let it warm up a bit first. The texture was good, I thought the cream filling was delicious, I would use that again in a different recipe. Of course, for all the people who didn't spend so much time in the kitchen baking them, they were a hit!

I thought these cookies were excellent. Once the dough got soft it was to difficult to work with, but I thought they came off the paper pretty quickly while frozen. It was a standard cookie dough involving the rolling, freezing, etc. These are my new Oreo replacement!!!

These are incredible cookies and better than anything you'll find in a bakery! I'm not sure why hungrylizzy's cookies didn't turn out as I had a difference experience. The recipe isn't the most straightforward or quickest for baking cookies, but if you follow the instructions carefuly and are ok with the different steps - freezing, rolling, assembling - you will be rewarded.

These cookies are not worth the trouble. The dough is crumbly and difficult to work with. Strangely, I had better luck letting it warm up to roll and cut it, but then had to re-chill it to transfer the cut cookies to the baking sheet. A huge pain in the neck. Then, I iced them a couple hours before my cookie party, by which time the cookies had absorbed moisture from the ganache, losing their crunch. A guest compared them to ice cream sandwiches. Such a disappointment after hours of struggling with that crumbly, messy dough.

These are destined to become a holiday regular! The cookies are crisp and chocolatey and the white chocolate ganache filling is not overly sweet. This cookie is way better than an Oreo!
