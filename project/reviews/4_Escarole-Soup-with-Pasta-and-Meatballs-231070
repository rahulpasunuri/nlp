This is our new favorite! I just made it for my family for Valentine's Day. It was a hit, so I'll definitely be making it again soon. I made extra meatballs and pasta and will extend it with more chicken stock for another meal.

This is the closest recipe to the one I grew up with in my Italian-American family. Unfortunately, Mom never used written recipes and when she passed, I tried to recreate this using several other recipes for this soup. Believe me, this is the best and only one I use. I substitue ditalini pasta for the orzo.

Excellent! Tasty, needs nothing else. Used ground turkey instead of ground beef.

This soup is amazing! I made it on Christmas Eve and it was gone, nothing leftover. Everyone LOVED it. I doubled the meatballs and the pasta. I added minced garlic and chopped parsley to the meatballs. Absolutely delicious!

This was ok, not the best soup I've made, a little on the bland side. The meatballs were good though, might try those with something else.

This was one of the best soups I have ever made I made it with just picked vegetables which might be why it was so delectable. But wow.

This was so easy. I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic and regular rather then low sodium broth, but it was still great. Absolutely perfect when finished with fresh ground pepper at the table.

Made this last night for my husband and two grown sons. Everyone loved it! It's full of flavor and easy to make. Used Pacific brand organic chicken stock, and followed the recipe exactly. Also made the penne with two cheeses and olives, thinking the soup wouldn't be enough, but it was plenty. Having the penne tonight.
