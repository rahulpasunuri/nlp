Easy, yummy, thumbs up from the Hubs. Came together quickly. Served w/ flatbread as another reviewed suggested, and some quinoa taboule. Good Greek-style flavors.

This was great. I broiled the loin chops. Our grocery store carries naan flatbreads, which we also dipped in the sauce. I also made a red curry sauce recipe to complete the meal with white rice.

This was wonderful. Grilled the lamb on the barbecue. Delicious for something so easy to make.

I tried this for a mid-week dinner and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to make and how delicious it was. I used the barbecue for the lamb. The coolness of the sauce complements the spiciness of the red curry paste. Hint: Freeze the remaining red curry paste by tablespoons in saran wrap for future recipes.
